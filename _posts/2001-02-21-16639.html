I think that you would have to be a somewhat &quot;mindful&quot; parent to choose<br/>
to unschool.<br/>
I don&#39;t think that many people just &quot;fall&quot; into unschooling by some<br/>
accident?<br/>
I have found that as a family we are much happier since we began to<br/>
unschool.<br/>
Just being with my children, paying attention to them and having time for<br/>
what interests us has<br/>
made a complete change on the way we all feel and treat one another. I<br/>
find that I spend more time paying attention because I want to and I have<br/>
the time!<br/>
I think my children are more secure in their being because they know I am<br/>
always accessible to them.<br/>
We spend much of the day each doing our own thing but together. I do find<br/>
that I spend some time analyzing <br/>
events in the day to be sure they were of some &quot;educational&quot; benefit ---<br/>
them I come back and laugh at the <br/>
absurdity of that idea. Experience (LIFE) is &quot;educational&quot;(if you choose<br/>
that term).<br/>
<br/>
I have decided to start documenting (photos,samples, notes) in a<br/>
scrapbook of sort. For comfort and memories.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this was of some help to you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-479133358">Hi, I am not sure of the age of your children, and maybe it does not matter. <br/>
But my kids (11,13,15,17) have learned that even though they know that they <br/>
can come to &quot;old Mom&quot; for answers anytime they have gotten to the place where <br/>
they search out what they need to know on their own.  And they have become <br/>
very good at finding the what they need themselves. When my oldest wanted to <br/>
learn HTML she turned to a friend online for help and she is quickly became <br/>
very good at it. When 2nd daughter wanted to build an agility course for her <br/>
dogs she enlisted her younger brother to help, got out the lumber and saws <br/>
and did a great job. I do take the kids serious and always listen to them and <br/>
we have some great discussions. But when it comes to wanting to learn <br/>
something new or finding answers they have become very good at finding the <br/>
info the need on their own. Sometimes I get a little nostalgic for the days <br/>
when they looked to me for answers, where does time go?<br/>

Unschooling isn&#39;t often a place that people get to by accident.  It takes<br/>
concious choice to get here, and that does seem to imply some thoughtful<br/>
conciousness on the part of unschooling parents/families.<br/>
<br/>
(But I&#39;m NOT implying that everyone who doesn&#39;t chose unschooling isn&#39;t<br/>

<br>I was working on mindfulness before I had children, and tend to have Buddhist 
<br>daily meditations and other short-item Zen books and spiritual encouragement 
<br>around the house as some other people have novels.
<br>
<br>Having children, having my first child, brought me to a higher level of 
<br>understanding than I could have reached without being a mother. &nbsp;I read 
<br>_Whole Parent, Whole Child_ and some of the things I read there helped set 
<br>the tone for my relationship with my firstborn. &nbsp;I went to La Leche League, 
<br>which encouraged me to see my child and myself as partners, as a unit, rather 
<br>than as adversaries. &nbsp;I met families there whose respect for their children 
<br>was like a field of love and light. &nbsp;Two of those families were unschooling. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Unschooling has made it easier for me to see the magic in so many things that 
<br>it is easier to be aware, so the awareness/homeschooling loop creates 
<br>feedback that increases both.

I wish I had set that kind of tone with my first, or<br/>
even my second. I have learned so much in the last 8<br/>
years. <br/>
Any advice for changing the relationship? When I<br/>
started hs-ing, I had no idea how much would change!<br/>
My kids are confused alot, waiting for the catch.<br/>
We&#39;ve talked about the change we are undergoing as a<br/>
family, but I sometimes fall back on old ways.<br/>
Unschooling is the best thing thats happened to our<br/>
family, but old habits die hard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971782649">I hope that if that is the time when one drops the ball, that one can <br/>
pick it up again, cos I&#39;m struggling right now to have the patience <br/>
and energy to do anything with my girls, much less focus <br/>
absolutely every time they ask me something...  I know that the <br/>
mroe I focus (and the more I am part of their activites, even <br/>
(especially) when not asked but welcomed (If I wasn&#39;t welcomed I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t stay)) the elss they would be asking of me, but still...  <br/>
Anyway, one of the things about unschooling for me is the <br/>
knowledge that there isn&#39;t just one time to learn each thing, that we <br/>
can go over stuff again, or forget about it altogether if it isn&#39;t <br/>
interesting or useful.  I&#39;m hoping my theory is right, because I think <br/>
I have a lot of catching up to do anyway, without any additional <br/>
pressure!!<br/>

<br>
<br>I do have ideas.
<br>
<br>Arrange to have time alone with your oldest. &nbsp;Just go and be, in some 
<br>quietish place. &nbsp;Like hike in the mountains, or go to the beach (I don&#39;t know 
<br>where you live)--no high-pressure, big organization thing. &nbsp;Just a picnic or 
<br>a walk. &nbsp;Other times, go to a cafe together for breakfast. &nbsp;Just talk, and 
<br>smile. &nbsp;Tell stories of his birth, of when he was little. &nbsp;Ask what he thinks 
<br>about something specific (a neighbor, a relative, a movie, what cars he 
<br>thinks look neat and why). &nbsp;TALK like you&#39;re takling to a toddler sometimes, 
<br>and sometimes like you&#39;re talking to an adult, and run the range of emotions 
<br>and behaviors until you feel comfortable in several of them and are not stuck 
<br>just acting in the roles you&#39;ve developed. &nbsp;&nbsp;Let him come to know you as a 
<br>person, not just as a parent. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>It&#39;s okay to say to a child &quot;I wish things had been different, when you were 
<br>little. &nbsp;I wish you could be a baby again so I could do things the way I know 
<br>now. &nbsp;I was young, and inexperienced, but I loved you to pieces and was doing 
<br>what I thought was best, but I&#39;d like to change things now.&quot;
