There is an unschooling support group meeting monthly in lower hudson valley area, just north of Manhattan.  One of the realities of homeschooling is the willingness to travel for social activities with other homeschoolers.  I travel south about 45 mins to get together with this group.  Though there are other unschoolers closer and we do things together, i find it satisfying to be a part of this ongoing group of families.  If you want more information contact me off list.  There are several lower westchester families with young children who attend.  It may not be too much of a ride to connect with them on a semi regular basis.<br/>
