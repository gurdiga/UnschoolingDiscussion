<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067076046">Hi group! My name is Carol, I have 4 boys, 3 are unschooling, ages <br/>
12, 9 and 6, my 18 year old is working and going to college. We live <br/>
in Humboldt County in No. California. This is our first year <br/>
homeschooling and like many, we started at the kitchen table with <br/>
workbooks and lots of crying, snapping etc. That lasted a week. My <br/>
kids needed decompression time, thank goodness, because it gave me an <br/>
opportunity to sit back and really look at what we were trying to <br/>
accomplish, and it was NOT school at home. <br/>
<br/>
Since that time we have drifted toward unschooling or what I like to <br/>
call child led learning. I am not sure we have any specific goals, <br/>
except that I want my sons to grow up knowing how to find any <br/>
information they want to learn about. I want them to feel good about <br/>
themselves and their place in the world. I want them to value service <br/>
to others and to the earth. To have the compassion, drive and know <br/>
how to do what makes them happy while serving others in some <br/>
compacity. To contribute to the well being of our world with <br/>
reverance and respect to all people and things. I guess those are my <br/>
goals at the moment...to raise conscious, happy, well adjusted human <br/>
beings. <br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to getting to know others on this site. Carol</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484372778">Just another intro to follow Carol&#39;s. :-)  I live in<br/>
Western MA with my 6yo son (Hollis) and my 4yo<br/>
daughter (Annika).  Hollis would be in first grade<br/>
starting this fall.  We&#39;ve been unschooling since<br/>
Hollis was born, I guess.  He taught himself to read<br/>
when he was two and so far child-led learning seems to<br/>
be working just swell for us.  He knows he can go to<br/>
school if he wants, but so far he doesn&#39;t want to.  My<br/>
goal with unschooling is that my kids learn to think<br/>
for themselves and hopefully become self-starters. <br/>
Although I did really well in school, the latter is<br/>
something I had a problem with.<br/>
