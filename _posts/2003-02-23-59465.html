<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391583701">Did I mention the 3 moving boxes in the living room?  Jackie has been making<br/>
things with boxes for a while and kept saying she needed a bigger box.  It<br/>
finally occurred to me to buy her one.  I took her to a moving place and she<br/>
picked out a wardrobe box.  She was SO happy.  Well worth the $10.  She told<br/>
me I was The Best Mom.<br/>
<br/>
There are three boxes lined up together with various windows and doors.  For<br/>
now, they are mainly a time machine.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think maybe she will end up as an architect.  Or, who knows,<br/>
maybe she will grow up and invent a real time machine.  None of that<br/>
matters, but it&#39;s fun for me to imagine where it may lead.  For now, it<br/>
equals hours of fun.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When the kids were younger, I once made them a castle out of 2 wardrobe <br/>
boxes plus 2 smaller ones. The wardrobes were the tall turrets on either <br/>
end. The other boxes were flattened out and attached in between to be the <br/>
body of the castle. We even had windows, secret passages and a working <br/>
drawbridge.<br/>
<br/>
It was very cool. My kids still love boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
