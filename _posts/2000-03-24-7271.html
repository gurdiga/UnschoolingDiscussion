<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116893574">Hi All, <br/>
My Brother and Sister-in-law have  apice of country property complete<br/>
with chickens.<br/>
We are going to hatch some chicks for them in a still air incubator as a<br/>
HSing project.<br/>
Anybody else done this and have any sage advice to offer.<br/>
Our incubator (home made) is mad from plans from the University of<br/>
Mississippi Extension Service site.<br/>
We plan to do a dozen.<br/>
Anybody have tried and true plans for a small brooding box?<br/>
<br/>
Our chicks will have a good home to go to unlike a lot of school hatched<br/>
chicks.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice or recommendation of any good related web sites gladly<br/>
accepted.<br/>
<br/>
Buzz (Debbie)</div>
