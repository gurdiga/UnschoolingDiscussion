<div id="ygrps-yiv-807903677">My younger brother who is a math grad student sent me this article<br/>
about math and the kind of math that is not memorizing multiplication<br/>
tables.   He thought that was interesting and I thought it might be<br/>
interesting to people here as well.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It also reminded me of a story that I remembered about Enrico Fermi,<br/>
who was a very accomplished physicist, walking into a freshman physics<br/>
class and asking them how many piano tuners there are in Chicago.  He<br/>
ends up answering the question with a series of reasonable estimates<br/>
(how many people are in Chicago, how many families, what proportion of<br/>
the families have pianos, how often they are tuned, how long it takes<br/>
to tune a piano, how many hours a piano tuner would work in a year).<br/>
All of these were rough guesses based on reasonable assumptions but<br/>
they give you a good ballpark answer to a question that you would<br/>
think you<br/>
<br/>
In terms of &quot;real world math&quot;, questions like this really do come up<br/>
(e.g. how many seeds are in the pomegranate that we are eating) but I<br/>
can see it being very easy not to have an answer as this isn&#39;t how<br/>
schools teach math and may not be how many adults are used to looking<br/>
at the world this way.<br/>
<br/>
a book of essays, one of which has this story: (The Fermi Solution)<br/>

an article about it:<br/>

<br/>
For some reason, it also reminds me (looser commection) to the<br/>
statistics story about the lady tasting tea. That is another nice<br/>
story and there is a book meant for the general public that has that<br/>
story as well as other stories about statistics. (The Lady Tasting<br/>
Tea)<br/>
