I had no idea such a magazine even existed.  If you can fax me a copy of<br/>
that list (see my # in the signature at the end of this message), I&#39;ll put<br/>
the entire list on a database and put it in the &quot;files&quot; area of this<br/>
YahooGroup, so that anyone can download it (databases can be opened by<br/>
MS-Works, MS-Excel, Word, Wordperfect, and many other programs) and search<br/>
it for people nearby.<br/>
<br/>
It might be nice to have some way of adding the people on this and any<br/>
other unschooling lists onto such a database as well.<br/>

&gt;To the McPhersons:<br/>
&gt;I do not still have your original message (sorry) and that probably <br/>
&gt;had your email address in it - so I can&#39;t ask you this question other <br/>
&gt;than on the list.  I happen to have the last issue of &quot;Growing Without <br/>
&gt;Schooling&quot;  (fantastic mag - SO sad they&#39;re gone) that had the annual <br/>
&gt;list of subscribers.  (Jan/Feb 2001)  If you do not have access to <br/>
&gt;that and would like to see if there are families in your area, I would <br/>
&gt;be happy to help.  Just send me a personal email with your zip code and <br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll be happy to send you the names and addresses of the families whose <br/>
&gt;zips are closest to yours. (Knowing the name of the town might also <br/>
&gt;make it easier for me to scan (there&#39;s 1.3 columns of names for VA <br/>
&gt;and it&#39;s fairly small print - so maybe there&#39;ll be a lead!) <br/>
&gt;Good luck!  Support really helps as we seem to be rather different <br/>
&gt;than mainstream culture. The people who post here are a great help <br/>
&gt;that way, too.<br/>

But then the list will be there years after the people agreed to have it <br/>
published.  Sending an address to a periodical to which you&#39;ve subscribed <br/>
isn&#39;t the same as agreeing to have it published on the internet for years.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to publish those secondarily.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825232871">Thanks Sandra! I was not comfortable with that part(secondary publishing) either.  Now that I have just found out about HomeEd - I need to check it out.  GWS going out left a big hole for me.  I am new to this list and need to check out all of the resources.  I haven&#39;t had a chance to do that yet.  It&#39;s been a busy week!  <br/>
