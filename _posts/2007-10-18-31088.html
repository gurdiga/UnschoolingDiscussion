I don&#39;t want to go and look at a video right now, but I might&#39;ve  <br/>
wanted to go and look if it had been described as a tie-in with  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE, anyone who bring a link here to anything, explain why.  Tell  <br/>
us why, in your experience and your words, it&#39;s worth going to look  <br/>
at and why it will help people understand unschooling.<br/>

song...unless I am being dense and missed the point, in which case I<br/>
apologize.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174035948">New, improved post!!<br/>
 <br/>
Hi all,<br/>
 <br/>
My brother who&#39;s a magician sent me this video of a trick, but I don&#39;t  think <br/>
it&#39;s a magic trick but a puzzle.  <br/>
 <br/>
I watched it several times and came away feeling stupid (thanks, school!!)  <br/>
because I just couldn&#39;t get it.  First I thought, oh, he&#39;s folding the  paper, <br/>
or hiding part underneath, but no, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it.  But  then I <br/>
thought hey, this is life, not school, and it&#39;s not &quot;cheating&quot; to  ask other people <br/>
for help.  And who better to ask than this bunch of  unschoolers who actually <br/>
*like* thinking and often *enjoy* solving puzzles and  sharing cool stuff <br/>
with their kids?<br/>
 <br/>
As a side note that&#39;s kind of connected to unschooling, my brother went to  <br/>
school and says he didn&#39;t actually learn to read until some time in the  middle <br/>
of high school (and surprise, he also came away feeling stupid.) He  now <br/>
lives in Japan and makes his living as an entertainer but also teaches  English at <br/>
a university and speaks Japanese fluently, which all came as a result  of <br/>
following his interest in juggling.  Unfortunately, he hasn&#39;t  yet made his own <br/>
connection about where and how real learning happens (and  doesn&#39;t) and now <br/>
sends his own kids to school.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, so here&#39;s the link to the puzzle, one that should actually work:<br/>

that the triangles that are supposed to complete the little squares  <br/>
are bigger than the triangles the squares were previously matched  <br/>
with. So the &quot;squares&quot; formed from the bottoms of the big pieces  <br/>
aren&#39;t really squares any more. They&#39;ve all gained just a little bit  <br/>
each that adds up to a full square.<br/>
