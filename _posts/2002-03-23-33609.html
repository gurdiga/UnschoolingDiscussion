refrigerator or freezer and use the box for me.  I always enjoyed <br/>
those boxes when I was small so I thought it might be a nice way to <br/>
go.  My family can think of me when they eat ice cream.  I have also <br/>
told him that I will haunt him if he lets some goofy beautician play <br/>
with my face and hair or dress me in churchy clothes.  I hate that <br/>
stuff now, so why would I want to be dressed up then?  I think a <br/>
flannel nightgown would be nice. That is probably how my kids will <br/>
remember me best (besides it is cold down there).<br/>

BTW - Here in Ohio state law does not mandate a burial vault but <br/>
according to my funeral director friend, you would be hard pressed to <br/>
find a cemetary that will take you without one.  He says it is a <br/>
liability issue.  The ground sags, someone trips, they sue . . . <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My mom died without really planning anything - she had just started doing<br/>
that when she suddenly took a turn for the worse and died. So, my dad, my<br/>
brother, Cacie, and I (my sister didn&#39;t want to be part of any of it) got<br/>
together and made plans, based on what she wanted and what we remebered<br/>
her saying over the years. My brother wants to be cremated and have his<br/>
ashes tossed into the ocean in a tackle box by the whole family,<br/>
somewhere warm so we get a good vacation out of it. I&#39;m not sure of the<br/>
legalities, but it&#39;s a nice though. Cacie wants the very flashy, plush,<br/>
purple casket. My dad will be creamted and his urn put in the same<br/>
columbarium niche as my mother. They also have three boxes of dog<br/>
cremains on the bookshelf in the den, in between butterfly books and<br/>
books on the Sea of Cortez, but they&#39;re not allowed in the columbarium...<br/>
<br/>
The funniest moment was when we all went to chose a casket for my mom<br/>
(you can chose the cardboard box option with a cremation, but because we<br/>
were having a viewing we chose a simple casket). We all walked into a<br/>
fairly large room with different open caskets along the walls and in the<br/>
center. It was more emotionally wrenching than we had expected - my<br/>
brother had to leave the room at first - but as we walked through Cacie<br/>
quipped &quot;This looks like a hotel for vampires&quot; and we laughed, and it was<br/>
better...<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve used the same funeral home for my mom, my grandpa (&#39;92) and my<br/>
sister (&#39;78). My dad knows them professionally, as well, which maybe<br/>
makes it a little easier, but they seem to keep a nice balance between<br/>
sympathetic and businesslike, and they were open to all of our unusual<br/>
requests (mostly the somewhat unorthodox obit my dad wrote and bringing<br/>
my mom&#39;s little dog to the viewing, in hopes that she would finally stop<br/>
waiting for her by the back door).  I don&#39;t think I would want all this<br/>
happening at home, although I certainly respect that other people might.<br/>
We did want my mother to die at home, and she really wanted this as well<br/>
- we had made plans with the hospice to bring her home the morning that<br/>
she died.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for letting me babble... after three months I seem to want<br/>
to talk about it all.<br/>

TeeHee. When I was younger, and for many, many years, I said I wanted to be <br/>
cremated and have my ashes ground into my mil&#39;s white carpeting. &lt;beg&gt; It&#39;s <br/>
been 25+ years that I&#39;ve know her now, we get along fine and she&#39;s a lovely <br/>
woman, so I have grown out of this silly request. (Besides, she tiled the <br/>
whole apartment. ;-))<br/>
<br/>
Jon and I have talked about what we&#39;d like. Neither of us wants anything <br/>
that costs much. We&#39;d like immediate creamation and some sort of <br/>
party/celebration of our lives, with a scattering of the ashes. The party <br/>
would be whatever the survivng one thinks will help eveyone concerned. As <br/>
for music, I&#39;d bet Jon&#39;s would have some Grateful Dead (at least Ripple and <br/>
Box of Rain). Actually, he just told me he wants it to be a drunken street <br/>
fest. :o) I&#39;d prefer the music of James and some dancing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-553081866">When Grampa Harry died, Uncle LeRoy rented a park, called all the family and<br/>
said bring out the photo albums.  Grampa Harry was cremated and his ashes<br/>
were set in the middle of all the albums and framed photos.  Everyone shared<br/>
their fondest memories, we had a bbq and there was plenty of Grampa Harry&#39;s<br/>
favorite beer.  His ashes were then scattered on the top of a mountain that<br/>
was his favorite place to &quot;get away from it all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful memories for everyone to take home.<br/>

Dh and I have always wanted to be creamated and we have promised to <br/>
scatter the ashes at Lake Mead, NV a special place for us for many years.<br/>
(This ash scattering would occur in the water from the 32 ft off-shore boat<br/>
he/she would purchase with some of the insurance money we often joke &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
After watching Arthur (Sean Connery) recently, we decided we would like<br/>
to be cast out to sea with our remains torched with a flaming arrow.  Now <br/>
thats<br/>
a cool way to go. But really, I told dh I would probably have to hold onto<br/>
his ashes for awhile cos I don&#39;t think I would be ready to let go of him for <br/>
a long time.<br/>
As for the funeral, I would like a viewing.  My children have experienced<br/>
a lot of death in their young lives and I have realised it was very important<br/>
for my oldest to be able to see her grandma one last time (against many <br/>
people&#39;s advice). She stroked her hair, put a flower on her chest.  She was <br/>
7.  It still makes me cry. So I have told dh, make sure my children get that <br/>
final opportunity, the closure.  Also, and lastly I want one big nice flower <br/>
arrangement from dh and kids and the rest to please make a donation to LLL <br/>
and my state hs organization <br/>
rather than wasting money on flowers.  <br/>

Wow.  A little milk carton ship on the shore of the Great Salt Lake at dusk...<br/>
The little hamster with his sword and shield and exercise wheel...<br/>
<br/>
By medieval Norse law, if he was murdered, all the killer&#39;s relatives owe all <br/>
of the hamster&#39;s relatives (that&#39;s your family, at least) gold and red cloth <br/>
and stuff!!   I wonder what &quot;hamster-geld&quot; is.<br/>
