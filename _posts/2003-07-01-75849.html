<br/>
Kathryn,<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have any dates yet for that do you?   I was wondering what part of August you&#39;re looking at.   I think we might plan a little trip up to Canada(PEI) after.   I&#39;m already trying to pull a new homeschooler with me to MA,  she&#39;s teterring toward unschooling! &lt;g&gt;    This week she mentioned that she wanted to go to Prince Edward Island the beginning of September and I said,  &quot;well, you should come to the next unschooling conference!  And we can go up after that!&quot;.    My conniving little mind.<br/>
<br/>
Kelli~who is still counting down the days &#39;til this year&#39;s one.  45 days until we leave!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If it could be planned for after the Olympics, that might help too.<br/>
Holly and I have a partial possible offer of a trip to London (Holly&#39;s way <br/>
paid, mine paid by me) to watch a toddler while the family goes to Greece.  <br/>
We&#39;re Plan B, but I had to say &quot;That&#39;s the homeschooling conference month!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if enough families watch Olympic TV coverage to make that a <br/>
factor, but it hasn&#39;t been a factor for Kelly because it wasn&#39;t an Olympic year.</div>

But YOU might be tired again! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

There won&#39;t be a clash! Promise!<br/>
