&gt; by Tammy Drennan (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Tdrennan@...">Tdrennan@...</a>) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny has just come home from his friend Joey&#39;s house. His father is <br/>
&gt; relaxing in the living room, reading the evening paper. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dad: Well, Johnny, did you have a good time? <br/>
&gt; Johnny: Uh-huh. Dad, why do I have to go to school? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dad: Well, you want an education, don&#39;t you? <br/>
&gt; Johnny: Yes. But I could learn by myself. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dad: How would you know what to study? <br/>
&gt; Johnny: I would study everything I was interested in. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dad: Hmm. What if you forgot something important? <br/>
&gt; Johnny: Like what? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dad: Well, like learning when World War II was. <br/>
&gt; Johnny: Joey&#39;s grandpa fought in World War II. He knows almost <br/>
&gt; everything about it, and he had to stop going to school in the fourth <br/>
&gt; grade, because his parents needed him to help on the farm. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dad: World War II is something Joey&#39;s grandpa is very interested in, but <br/>
&gt; you never fought in a war, so you might forget to learn things like that. <br/>
&gt; Johnny: I could ask people I know what they think is really <br/>
&gt; important, and they could tell me everything they know about it. Joey&#39;s <br/>
&gt; grandpa <br/>
&gt; knows more about World War II than Joey&#39;s dad. And Joey&#39;s dad went to <br/>
&gt; college. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dad: Well, schools know what order you should learn things in. You <br/>
&gt; might learn things at the wrong time and get mixed up. <br/>
&gt; Johnny: You mean like learning to read in first grade and learning <br/>
&gt; cursive in third grade? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dad: That&#39;s right. <br/>
&gt; Johnny: But I knew how to read before I went to school, and Joey&#39;s <br/>
&gt; grandpa still doesn&#39;t know any cursive, except how to sign his name. And <br/>
&gt; he writes all the time. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dad: But wouldn&#39;t his life be easier if he knew cursive? And now he&#39;s so <br/>
&gt; old, it would probably be very hard for him to learn it. <br/>
&gt; Johnny: I guess. Would your life be easier if you knew how to fix cars? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dad: Heh, heh. Definitely. <br/>
&gt; Johnny: What&#39;s the right age to learn that? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dad: Well, uh, there really isn&#39;t a right age, I suppose. <br/>
&gt; Johnny: Do you think you&#39;re too old to learn? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dad: No. But I don&#39;t have the motivation to learn. Uncle Don can work on <br/>
&gt; our car. <br/>
&gt; Johnny: What&#39;s motivation? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dad: It&#39;s when you want to do something because you have a reason for <br/>
&gt; it-- maybe you just love it or maybe you need to know how to do it. <br/>
&gt; Johnny: Oh, &#39;cause one time Joey&#39;s grandpa said he didn&#39;t have any <br/>
&gt; motivation to learn cursive. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; --- Later that night. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: Dad, what does com-pul-sor-y mean? <br/>
&gt; Dad: You did a good job on that big word. It means you have to do <br/>
&gt; something. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: My teacher says school is com-pul-sor-y. <br/>
&gt; Dad: Yes, that&#39;s right. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: Thomas Edison didn&#39;t go to school. <br/>
&gt; Dad: Well, that was a long time ago. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: Well why is school compulsory? <br/>
&gt; Dad: Because it&#39;s important for children to get an education. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: Who made it compulsory? <br/>
&gt; Dad: Government. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: But Thomas Edison didn&#39;t go to school, and he was the greatest <br/>
&gt; inventor in the whole world. And Abraham Lincoln didn&#39;t go to school. <br/>
&gt; They learned by themselves. Joey&#39;s grandpa said so. <br/>
&gt; Dad: Things were different when they were growing up. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: How? <br/>
&gt; Dad: Uh, well, there wasn&#39;t as much to know then. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: Do you know as much as Thomas Edison did? <br/>
&gt; Dad: No, not nearly as much, I must admit. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: But you went to college. And I heard on the news that a lot of <br/>
&gt; people can&#39;t even read when they&#39;re finished with school. Four kids in my <br/>
&gt; class can&#39;t read. <br/>
&gt; Dad: Well, they&#39;re only in the fourth grade. They still have time <br/>
&gt; --they&#39;re young. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: But I thought you said it was important to learn things at the <br/>
&gt; right time. <br/>
&gt; Dad: Well, things don&#39;t always work out perfectly. Maybe those kids have <br/>
&gt; learning problems. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: I think they don&#39;t have motivation. When did you learn about <br/>
&gt; World War II? <br/>
&gt; Dad: Let&#39;s see... I think that was in high school -- tenth grade. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: Why did people just follow Hitler when they knew all the bad <br/>
&gt; things he was doing? <br/>
&gt; Dad: I&#39;m not sure I could say. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: Joey&#39;s grandpa says there were lots of reasons for it. He says <br/>
&gt; some people were just too scared to do anything. And he said some people <br/>
&gt; were evil, like Hitler. And he said lots of people just didn&#39;t use their <br/>
&gt; brains. He says they got all caught up in Hitler&#39;s speeches and they <br/>
&gt; thought he was great. And he said there really were a lot of people who <br/>
&gt; were fighting Hitler the whole time. Some of them hid people and <br/>
&gt; helped them escape from Hitler. Did they teach you that in tenth grade? <br/>
&gt; Dad: Well, some of it. There wasn&#39;t time to get into reasons for things. <br/>
&gt; We mostly learned facts. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: Joey&#39;s grandpa says that if you don&#39;t think about the reasons for <br/>
&gt; things, there&#39;s no use knowing the facts. <br/>
&gt; Dad: Well, he has a good point. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: I&#39;m really interested in airplanes. When do we get to that in <br/>
&gt; school? <br/>
&gt; Dad: Well, you&#39;ll probably cover a few principles of flight in science <br/>
&gt; one year. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: But I want to know everything about them. <br/>
&gt; Dad: I think you&#39;ll have to do that on your own. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: What do you think is the right age to do it at? <br/>
&gt; Dad: (sigh) I suppose any age will do. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: Good! I&#39;m going to start right now! Joey&#39;s grandpa gave me a neat <br/>
&gt; book about World War II airplanes. He knows all about airplanes. He can <br/>
&gt; even fix them. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ---Johnny starts to leave the room, then stops. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Johnny: I forget, Dad -- why is school compulsory? <br/>
&gt; Dad: I&#39;ll have to think on that, Johnny. How about sharing that airplane <br/>
&gt; book with me? <br/>
