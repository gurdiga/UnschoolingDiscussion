&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;So it turns into a really bad unschooling day because my child somehow<br/>
thinks that everything she NEEDS to know will come to her naturally almost <br/>
by osmosis and that she can avoid anything she doesn&#39;t WANT to learn BUT <br/>
still have the career she wants&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How can a day of a mom being resentful of what a child doesn&#39;t want to learn <br/>
be ANY kind of an unschooling day?<br/>
<br/>
Everything she needs to know will come to her by osmosis if she is exposed to <br/>
those kinds of things in the real world.  That&#39;s precisely how unschooling <br/>
works.  If she wants to know more about biology, she needs to be around <br/>
animals, videos of animals, books about animals, people who know about <br/>
animals.   She doesn&#39;t need to read a biology book.  She needs terminology as <br/>
it comes naturally, and ideas and questions as they come naturally.<br/>

investigation, what she really wants is to wear her pink tutu around the<br/>

<br/>
Holly told me last week that when she was little she had told the neighbors <br/>
she wanted to be an artist when she grew up.  So they all started saying they <br/>
wanted to be artists too.  But the whole field of choice she had at the time <br/>
was artist or actress.  She hadn&#39;t realized there were all KINDS of choices.  <br/>
So give the two she knew of, she&#39;d prefer artist, and the neighbors copied <br/>
her. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What she really wanted was to feel light and good about painting and drawing <br/>
with chalk and &quot;sculpting&quot; things (play dough, junk, string in a tree).   <br/>
<br/>
Between then and lately, none of my kids had any statements made about what <br/>
they wanted to do, but lately (within the past couple of months) Marty has <br/>
named a set of three physical things:  wrestler, Air Force MP or policeman.   <br/>
Kirby has twice mentioned law, once mentioned programming.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Marty yesterday whether he was saying policework because it didn&#39;t <br/>
need college.  I asked him if he was afraid he couldn&#39;t do college.  I <br/>
reminded him that when he was seven or eight he had asked me if they were <br/>
homeschooled because they weren&#39;t very smart.  He laughed.  Holly said, &quot;You <br/>
thought that!?&quot;   (The little neighbors, who weren&#39;t very smart, had <br/>
suggested that to Marty, it had turned out.)<br/>
<br/>
He said no, that he just wanted to do something really physical, and most <br/>
things people went to college for didn&#39;t seem to be physical.<br/>
<br/>
I let it go at that point, but will think about it and look around.  There&#39;s <br/>
the possibility of his doing ROTC, but if air force is really his interest, <br/>
this isn&#39;t the town.  Homeschoolers and even unschoolers have done the air <br/>
force academy in Colorado Springs, but Marty&#39;s likely to be a big guy, not <br/>
air force size.  Navy sized, maybe.  There&#39;s naval ROTC at the University of <br/>
New Mexico.  If he gets much taller he won&#39;t be submarine-size.<br/>
<br/>
So I thought all those things, but I didn&#39;t say them to Marty.  Maybe when it <br/>
comes up again.  Maybe he&#39;ll end up being a produce buyer, or do fancy paint <br/>
jobs on city busses.  There&#39;s a contest for kids to design a paint job for a <br/>
city bus here, and someone does it.  All those things catch the kids&#39; <br/>
interests.  Maybe he&#39;ll end up working at Honeywell as an engineer like his <br/>
dad did.  I&#39;m not attached to any outcomes except that he feel life is alive <br/>
and he is a live part of it.<br/>

&gt; discussion of this question.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since it seems to be of interest I thought I&#39;d post about my talk with Cait <br/>
this morning.  We were looking at the virtual frog dissection page (which she <br/>
thinks is way cool, so thanks for sending it along) and I asked her why it is <br/>
that she wants to be a doctor.<br/>
<br/>
Her answer at first was short, typical of teenagers, &quot;I&#39;ve ALWAYS wanted to <br/>
be a doctor, you KNOW this&quot;.  I said of course I KNOW this, and I&#39;ve watched <br/>
her and think I know why but I&#39;d like for her to tell me.  She rapidly <br/>
explained to me that it was a GOOD career choice because if you look at any <br/>
of the projections the medical field is going to be in short supply by the <br/>
time she would be a licensed doctor.  OK.<br/>
<br/>
So then she began to tell me that she learned early on that there were &quot;good&quot; <br/>
doctors and the &quot;not so good&quot; ones.  Some really make a difference in really <br/>
&quot;being&quot; with you when you are sick, not just thinking of you as a list of lab <br/>
tests and ailments to &quot;fix&quot;.  That a &quot;good&quot; doctor would be employable almost <br/>
anywhere in the world and be able to affect others in a good way.<br/>
<br/>
I pointed out to here that sometimes sad things come from the medical field, <br/>
some fields have a lot of death and dying.  She told me that is another <br/>
reason &quot;good&quot; doctors are so needed.  She reminded me of when her baby <br/>
brother died and the doctor seemed totally distance and almost hateful with <br/>
us.  I told her while it was hurtful to us, he probably had to be that way to <br/>
shield himself.   She said EXACTLY why there NEEDS to be GOOD doctors.  You <br/>
have to accept death as part of life and you are their to HELP your patients <br/>
and their families at times like that.<br/>
<br/>
I have to add we&#39;ve had our share of family deaths this year, six since Sept. <br/>
 Five since December, all different ages, all but one very unexpected.  So <br/>
maybe that pain is what drives her today, maybe tomorrow it will be something <br/>
else.<br/>
<br/>
She did tell me about how if you EVER really got &quot;bummed out&quot; (her term) and <br/>
felt you weren&#39;t being the BEST doctor to your patients anymore, you can <br/>
always go into research or teach.  She said both of those things would be <br/>
really neat too do too.<br/>
<br/>
So without pushing for more that&#39;s about all she said and was off to look at <br/>
the frog stuff yet again.  <br/>
<br/>
I asked her if I could share her thoughts with this list, she said sure, but <br/>
make sure you tell them about the neat cell cake we baked last week.  So, we <br/>
baked a round cake, frosted it and she decorated it with candies and such to <br/>
represent a cell, she&#39;s done it before but was in the mood to either bake, <br/>
buy licorice whips and fire balls and gum drops and jelly beans, to <br/>
experiment more, or maybe just eat cake!  <br/>
<br/>
She did show it to the neighborhood children and tell them all the names of <br/>
the parts of a cell before she let them have any, they seemed awe struck, but <br/>
they are eight years old and down.  She loved it that they loved it.<br/>
<br/>
So there is &quot;part&quot; of the reason as she left it with me.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m just curious...how did the terms &quot;blue collar&quot; and &quot;white collar&quot; come <br/>
into being? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From the time when collars were somewhat separate from shirts (19th century, <br/>
mostly) and some jobs required men to wear collars to work.  Desk jobs.  <br/>
Accounting (which used to be cool  &lt;g&gt;).  Banking.  <br/>
<br/>
But tradesmen didn&#39;t wear white collars, or white shirts even.  And &quot;blue <br/>
collar&quot; is a more recent term.  Maybe invented by Newsweek.   :-)  <br/>
<br/>
My grandmother actually showed me how to remove and turn the collar on a <br/>
shirt.  I had no interest whatsoever.  But it seems it was commonly done by <br/>
ANY good housewife or by professional seamstresses/tailors, which my <br/>
grandmother did on the side for many years, to just about every decent shirt <br/>
at some point.  They turned the collar and cuffs so the shirt looked newer <br/>
and lasted longer.<br/>
<br/>
But before that, there were separate parts, replaced way before the shirt was <br/>
replaced, apparently.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Not sure.  The old white shirt and tie versus the blue work shirt?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I thought it was too. Business men wear white shirts with ties<br/>
and the physical labor men wear the blue work shirts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-863271580">Thanks for the post. Evidently Cait has thought long and hard about it,<br/>
from many points of view - practical and emotional. Good for her! I<br/>
guess she does have an interest in biology to judge by her examination<br/>
of frogs. Have faith that she will think equally carefully about the<br/>
college stuff and pre-requisites needed when the time comes. I bet she<br/>
manages the math part in record time! Talking about why is good practice<br/>
for the interviews for her admittance.<br/>

&lt;&lt;We were looking at the virtual frog dissection page (which she <br/>
thinks is way cool, so thanks for sending it along) and I asked her why<br/>
it is that she wants to be a doctor.&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
In college I figured out a way to pull veins out of the thick red jello <br/>
squares they gave us at the cafeteria.   I would pull one hair out of my head <br/>
and using it like a taut-string-saw-tool (I don&#39;t know the word for such a <br/>
thing), would cut down into the jello, make a circle, and pull the hair out <br/>
gently, downward. <br/>
<br/>
The jello looked undisturbed.<br/>
<br/>
Then when someone else came to sit down and there was a lull or I wanted to <br/>
change the subject or gross someone out, I would say &quot;EEyew!  A VEIN in my <br/>
JELLO!&quot; and would open that slice with my fingers, and pull out the little <br/>
red rod of jello I had cut.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was hilarious, when I was 19.   I did it half a dozen times.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow, still I had friends.<br/>
