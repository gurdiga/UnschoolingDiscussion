<div id="ygrps-yiv-486629265"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; As for us, we just plain old don&#39;t do the mall shopping thing at ALL.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Neither do we.  And it&#39;s not like we feel deprived either.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For Christmas, we give hand-made gifts. We might include the<br/>
&gt; fire-started pinecones, this year, that&#39;s a great idea! We&#39;re giving some<br/>
&gt; jars of jam we canned earlier this year, some beeswax rolled candles,<br/>
&gt; home-made cookies and fudge, and a homemade ornament. We also give animals<br/>
&gt; from Heifer Project ( www.heifer.org ).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People who get offended with my Buy Nothing Day message often defend their<br/>
conventional spending by saying they enjoy gift-giving.  What rarely gets<br/>
mentioned, however, is the option you suggest above; that we aren&#39;t required<br/>
to buy our gifts at the mall.<br/>
<br/>
I say why not have a completely homemade Christmas?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So John, thanks for continuing to share your unconventional ideas, I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>always<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; find them interesting to read. I was especially interested in your essay<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; jobs. My husband started his own business doing aircraft detailing (or as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>he<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; says, he&#39;s a &quot;glorified janitor&quot;) and we&#39;ve found it gives us tons of<br/>
&gt; flexibility, time, and the ability for him to be his own boss, and it pays<br/>
&gt; well. My step-brother similarly has his own business cleaning range-hoods<br/>
&gt; for big restaurants. He travels all over the country, makes tons of money,<br/>
&gt; and loves it. There are tons of niche-markets in the cleaning industry<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; are lucrative and not very time-intensive.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I love the cleaning industry.  It&#39;s a great one to be in, and there<br/>
will always be a demand for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142405149">To me the most important aspect of dealing with money is the conscious choice <br/>
one brings to it. A favorite author refers to money as powerful Medicine (NA <br/>
meaning) that must be used wisely. Even though we are very generally frugal <br/>
and rarely buy new &quot;stuff&quot; we bought this computer last year (when we had <br/>
some &quot;extra&quot;money) brand new from a chain office supply store for $1,000. It <br/>
has greatly enhanced our lives. This Christmas we are between jobs so we&#39;ll <br/>
do something low budget and focus on the spirit of the season. To everything <br/>
there is a time...<br/>

I didn&#39;t mean for all to do that.  However, for some people it&#39;s a viable<br/>
option.<br/>
