<div id="ygrps-yiv-16123535">&quot;i take my kids out and put them on my lap occasionally too...glad to <br/>
know <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i&#39;m not alone&quot;<br/>
&gt; audrey<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do this also....AFTER I&#39;ve stopped the car and taken my child out <br/>
of his car seat.<br/>
I can not for the life of me understand why anyone that is interested <br/>
in the safety of children can not see what an extremely dangerous <br/>
practice this would be while a car is in motion.<br/>
Been in too many wrecks and close calls to not have deep respect for <br/>
how quickly life can change due to a bad/inattentive driver. <br/>
Dh wouldn&#39;t be here if it weren&#39;t for seat belts. Almost didn&#39;t make <br/>
it anyway. Children without belts/car seats are like projectiles, <br/>
they are the most vulnerable.<br/>
Keep them safe, please....they have no choice in the matter.<br/>
