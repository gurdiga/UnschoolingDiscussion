<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011176313">I agree. My husband did not want me to homeschool any<br/>
of my children. As far as unschooling he still does<br/>
not understand but he is learning (i hope):) My<br/>
youngest told his dad the other day that being<br/>
unschooled was alot better for him than ps. And my<br/>
hubby and i talked and he has seen improvements on the<br/>
kids behavior,attitude,and even there sleeping<br/>
habits.(they want to stay up all night and sleep all<br/>
day) but that is the only thing has said bad about<br/>
being homeschooled.. and he was my biggest problem<br/>
with doing all this. Other than my dad. he would come<br/>
up and visit and say wow it don&#39;t look like you guys<br/>
are doing any school work. and i would have one on the<br/>
computer playing a game and the other two was sitting<br/>
there playing a board game with me. um what do you<br/>
guys think i should tell him the next time he says<br/>
that. thankyou for letting me put my two cents in..<br/>

You might say &quot;Learning doesn&#39;t have to be work.  The have &quot;work&quot; at  school <br/>
and kids aren&#39;t doing it, and they&#39;re not learning.  They learn to  hate <br/>
learning, hate math, hate history...&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t say it all at one time, though.  It makes too long a  speech.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe the best thing to do is to ask if he wants to know more about what  <br/>
you&#39;ve learned about how kids can learn without school methods.  If so,  lend him <br/>
a book you&#39;ve read that helped you, or at least a chapter or two.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have told people before that if I thought school&#39;s methods worked, I&#39;d  <br/>
send them to school.  If they&#39;re going to be home, we can do better  things.<br/>
