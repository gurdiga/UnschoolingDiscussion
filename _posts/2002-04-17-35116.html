<br/>
Thank you so much for that letter.  It is the most informative thing I have<br/>
read so far on how to go about the daily routine.  I am going to print this<br/>
and try to use it as a guide.  It sounds so good.  I love the way the whole<br/>
family fits into it.  I like the idea of the family being involved, then it<br/>
truly is a lifestyle and that is exactly what I want.  I have really started<br/>
including the two year old in the last couple of days and it is great.  I<br/>
figured he would be too young to do anything constructive with but we have<br/>
been having a great time doing things I normally don&#39;t let him  do much of.<br/>
Last night we had to go to Vegas and my son had to get his annual drug test<br/>
for the union (they have to do it every year on or near their birthday to<br/>
get a current &quot;clean&quot; card. ).  The children and I waited for him in and<br/>
around the car for an hour and I thought it would really be a drag, but we<br/>
had a ball. WE played catch, we talked about the things surrounding us in<br/>
view, we laughed a lot and the time went so fast.  When my son came out and<br/>
apologized for taking so long we told him we didn&#39;t care because we were<br/>
having a great time.  He at first thought I was being sarcastic then<br/>
realized I wasn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I get so tired some times that I forget to have fun with them like I did my<br/>
kids when they (and I) were young.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t know what a help it is to get your routine run-down.  When I<br/>
started homeschooling I asked homeschooler support groups for a &quot;run down&quot;<br/>
on their routine because I was unsure how to go about it but not one person<br/>
gave me any insight.  The leader of the group wrote a nasty little reply and<br/>
said &quot;Look, we are not going to come and homeschool your grand-daughter so<br/>
if you don&#39;t think you can do it you better put her in public school she is<br/>
not our problem&quot;.   Needless to say I unsubbed and this is the first list I<br/>
have joined since then.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling was far better than public school for us but it never turned<br/>
out to be what I thought it would.  *Book study* is more pleasant at home<br/>
for her, but it is still *book study*.  I really feel that unschooling is<br/>
going to be our way of life.  I have been thinking of tactful ways to<br/>
present some of these ideas to my son bit by bit.  So far it has been a<br/>
positive experience.<br/>

&gt; Sharon, I only started unschooling in the fall and this group has helped<br/>
&gt; me a lot. I hope that you realize your posts have really delighted me,<br/>
&gt; and that you will not leave.  I can usually tell the attitude or content<br/>
&gt; by the first sentence of a post and will just delete it if it isn&#39;t for<br/>
&gt; me.  Every one has something to offer.  Your questions are very<br/>
&gt; thought-provoking and your comments interesting.  Even though I started<br/>
&gt; unschooling in the Fall, the way we unschool has changed considerably<br/>
&gt; since then as my understanding has changed.  The way we do things at my<br/>
&gt; house is as we&#39;re getting ready for the day we talk about what we want to<br/>
&gt; do-myself included- and where we want to go-usually this has nothing to<br/>
&gt; do with subjects and everything to do with interesting, fun things.  Then<br/>
&gt; we write it all down so everyone gets included.  At the start, I<br/>
&gt; interviewed my children to hear what they are interested in.  I wrote it<br/>
&gt; down and posted it on the wall to remind myself to be on the lookout for<br/>
&gt; things that my kids would be interested in.  Each week we have a family<br/>
&gt; meeting to discuss problems or ideas the children or I have.  These are<br/>
&gt; not necessarily academic.  I have just started making a sort of newspaper<br/>
&gt; to document what the children do from week to week.  I intend to save<br/>
&gt; these for future reference, and as documentation that they are learning.<br/>
&gt; We go to the library at least twice a week so they can use the<br/>
&gt; educational computer games or the internet.  We usually check out lots of<br/>
&gt; books too.  My three boys have math textbooks that they at first thought<br/>
&gt; they had to do because they weren&#39;t de-schooled yet.  But now, they just<br/>
&gt; use it as a reference book when they have a question.  They write and<br/>
&gt; email relatives and friends.  They experiment with magnets, plants and<br/>
&gt; draw and write books.  They build things and make plans and know I will<br/>
&gt; be there to help them and support them.  The children are delighted that<br/>
&gt; I listen to them and to their interests and help them find ways to<br/>
&gt; explore these things.  They play a lot of board games.  We go out of<br/>
&gt; doors a lot, down by the river or up to the mountains when we have gas.<br/>
&gt; The coast is an hour or so away.  I know that if I let them play, they go<br/>
&gt; sort of in spurts of devouring different subjects, then a rest.  I<br/>
&gt; realize that this is how I learn, too.  My daughter has had very little<br/>
&gt; of my input about math- maybe around fifteen minutes of introducing<br/>
&gt; little interesting things to her- and the rest she has figured out.  I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know how any more than I know how she learned to talk and walk.<br/>
&gt; They figure things out as their curiosity leads them to ask questions and<br/>
&gt; explore.  If I show them something and they are not interested, I drop<br/>
&gt; it.  If they are interested, they carry it.  Often they come to me with<br/>
&gt; questions and we explore it together.  I add it on the list of interests<br/>
&gt; so I remember to look for it later.<br/>
&gt; Is any of this of use to you?<br/>
&gt; Is Chaelene involved in 4-H?<br/>

we all do things so differently, even from day to day.  On another list I&#39;m <br/>
on we tend to laugh (not in an unfriendly way) when someone asks about a <br/>
typical day.  But the person always gets some answers, even though they&#39;re <br/>
prefaced by, &quot;Well, this isn&#39;t a typical day because there&#39;s no such thing, <br/>
but here&#39;s one of our days.&quot;<br/>
