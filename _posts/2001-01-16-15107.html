<div id="ygrps-yiv-266165980"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="3" FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua">I feel so grateful for all your thoughtful replies about the upcoming changes 
<br>in my family (birth of twins, and wanting to keep my older child at home). &nbsp;I 
<br>thank you all so much for the honest and helpful replies.
<br>
<br>My 3 year old is a spirited child and i know he would do horribly in a 
<br>preschool setting (but thank you to those who shared that arrangement worked 
<br>for them) As many of you pointed out, it is unlikely to be a positive 
<br>influence on him and the whole family when the arrival of his siblings is 
<br>coupled with being sent away. &nbsp;I don&#39;t have family nearby, and that scares 
<br>me, but i feel a mother&#39;s helper (a teen or younger) would be a good option, 
<br>and would give my son some extra attention while i am about the house. 
<br>Everyone&#39;s suggestions about good toys and supplies is appreciated too. We 
<br>already have all of them, which is a bonus. 
<br>
<br>One of the points raised that really bolstered my view was the many reminders 
<br>of how getting a child to a &quot;program&quot; can be so time consuming and stressful, 
<br>especially with two carseats in tow. &nbsp;I had tried to explain this angle to a 
<br>friend and she said &quot;Oh, there will be people to help you, the other moms of 
<br>the preschool will help you work it out&quot;. &nbsp;While it is nice to imagine all 
<br>these helpful people out there that would watch my infants in the car while i 
<br>take my relatively unhappy child to pre-school, i fail to see how this makes 
<br>it all worthwhile!! I have rheumatoid arthritis, and watching my energy 
<br>levels and physical strain is very very key. &nbsp;Keeping things &quot;low key&quot; and 
<br>homebased has been the key to pain management so far.
<br>
<br>The other helpful thread for my husband and i was the fact my son will be 
<br>sharing in life with his siblings---starting with seeing parts of the birth, 
<br>then all the care required to raise children (which he can contribute to). &nbsp;
<br>As well as being a unit study in home economics and the real work of making a 
<br>family, &nbsp;it is about valuing being together, and giving to one another above 
<br>all else (thank you to Amalia&#39;s older children&#39;s thoughts).
<br>
<br>I feel my instincts have been confirmed, which is a wonderful feeling!
