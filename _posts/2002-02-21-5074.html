I made for myself. I wasn&#39;t trying to just get her to do things for me --  <br/>
they really did. And most of the time she would say yes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021314003">Thank you for your responses. I like to brainstorm with others potential <br/>
solutions to our current dilemnas. When I get the feeling that being home <br/>
with the kids is not working because they fight, or they scream they can&#39;t <br/>
do this and that, I&#39;m realizing this is the difficult part of finding the <br/>
flow of learning together. Both hubby and I are frustrated with the constant <br/>
and I mean constant need for one of the kids to need us. Maybe this all <br/>
stems way back to our finding out I was expecting again. Our third was not <br/>
in our future plans. She is here and beautiful, a two year old full of life. <br/>
We also take care of Tim&#39;s dad who lives a few blocks away in a rest home. <br/>
So people are saying they will do these things for themselves when they are <br/>
ready. Tim and I seem to be ready for them to do simple tasks like putting <br/>
on pjs. I am all for doing it with them. When hubby complains he can not <br/>
help them get into bed because the way I always do it for them, then he and <br/>
I become engaged in a who is right here moment. I guess I need to also vent <br/>
the frustration of two people parenting together. Thanks again for <br/>
listening.<br/>
<br/>
Someone talked about their son and sports. My son will fall apart because he <br/>
senses he is not capable. I do not see us modeling perfection. I am the <br/>
queen of not correcting or teaching. We have a coach man on the block. No <br/>
kid ever plays with him because he is always correcting and seeking <br/>
perfection, ie taeching. I play, their level. We mix things up, hit a <br/>
soccerball with the bat, free form. My kids tend to fall apart from their <br/>
own expectation of themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I can see some patterns I set up for frustration, who said to be proactive. <br/>
My little guy saw his sister able to work the sticks onto the can. That was <br/>
his expectation for himself. And he did not want me to do parts. That is <br/>
when I get frustrated. My daughter saw me making hearts. I did show her the <br/>
3 that I could not do, but she wanted them to work like mine on her first <br/>
try.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I do enjoy the opportunity to be with my kids. I would not <br/>
trade my life for anything. My kids are special, unique, shining spirits in <br/>
our world. We do have a great existence. I ask behavior questions because <br/>
this is the only area that grates me. How they treat eachother and <br/>
themselves. When they get so frustrated they abandon things in a huff, I <br/>
worry for their emotional wellbeing. When they fight, I worry too.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to you all soon,<br/>
<br/>
Mary<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597098499">Hi Mary,<br/>
<br/>
Three of my kids are little and close in age.  2 of the little guys are<br/>
screamers.  My 3yo is very easily frustrated and prone to screaming,<br/>
flopping fits.  If we attempt to console him, it makes matters worse.  Even<br/>
when he is injured, he will run away, not wanting anyone to hug him or check<br/>
his injuries.  What helps with us is when I let him know that I want to<br/>
comfort him, that I will comfort him anytime he wants and then I simply give<br/>
him room to vent his rage.<br/>
<br/>
It is really like Danny gets overcome with anger when he is frustrated or<br/>
injured so that he will &quot;bite the hand that feeds him&quot;.  I agree that it can<br/>
be frustrating for everyone concerned.<br/>
<br/>
