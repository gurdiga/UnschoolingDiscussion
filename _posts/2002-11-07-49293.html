<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025635672">I had a small &quot;A-hah!&quot; moment yesterday, and it wouldn&#39;t have been possible<br/>
without this line, so I wanted to thank all the people who have been so<br/>
helpful, especially those I was very skeptical of at first.   Sometimes I<br/>
would read the posts aghast, and think &quot;There is no WAY I could do that --<br/>
that is so irresponsible!&quot; or &quot;Shouldn&#39;t kids just have to obey without all<br/>
this pussyfooting around?&quot;  (Okay, I am terribly embarrassed to admit it<br/>
now, but I was also in the process of deschooling myself!  Still am, in lots<br/>
of ways.)  Anyhow, yesterday I had to drop the older two off at the &quot;Y&quot; for<br/>
their gym and swim session.  I usually run errands for the first hour while<br/>
they do whatever the sport of the week is, and join them in the pool for the<br/>
last half.  The 2 year old was most anxious to go swimming, and needed<br/>
constant reassurance that she would get to go.  She fell asleep in the van<br/>
on the way to the pool, which left me with a real dilemma.  Should I wake<br/>
her from her nap and contend with a grumpy toddler, or let her sleep and<br/>
break my promise?  I mean, how important was a promise to a two year old,<br/>
anyway? She wouldn&#39;t even remember when she was older.  And she&#39;d be much<br/>
better off with the extra sleep.  Now, I know for most of you there wouldn&#39;t<br/>
even have been a question here.  Unschooling is just second nature.  Ashamed<br/>
as I am to admit it, I actually had to reason it out.  I finally took a deep<br/>
breath and woke her.  Sure enough, she woke up howling and demanding her<br/>
hat.  I was completely mystified, as she has no hat.  She grudgingly put on<br/>
her suit, and then sobbed for a good quarter of an hour in the pool while I<br/>
held her and rocked her and asked if she wanted to go home, or play, or<br/>
nurse, or what.  She just kept asking for her hat.  Feeling very frustrated<br/>
(but  remembering to try to not say &quot;no&quot;), I finally asked her what her hat<br/>
looked like.  She described it, and I promised that as soon as we got home,<br/>
we would find a hat just like that. (And we did!) She finally calmed down,<br/>
leaned her head against me, and said, &quot;I love you mama; in the whole world.&quot;<br/>
Then she splashed happily about.  Could she have used the extra sleep? Given<br/>
her response to being waken, most assuredly.  WIll she remember I kept my<br/>
promise?  Possibly not -- but hopefully I am establishing a pattern here.<br/>
Was it wretched having her howl and yowl and advertise to the &quot;Y&quot; at large<br/>
that I am the World&#39;s Worst Mother?  Oh, don&#39;t even go there.  The<br/>
temptation to say, &quot;What&#39;s your mama&#39;s name, little girl?  Shall I help you<br/>
find her?&quot;  and be elevated to Heroic Rescuer instead of WWM was almost<br/>
overwhelming.  But it&#39;s like those mastercard commercials:  they add up all<br/>
the costs of whatever, but then deem the experience &quot;priceless&quot;. SO although<br/>
it wasn&#39;t second nature, I think I am finally starting to internalize what<br/>
you lot know already.  Thanks for the help along the journey.  Debi</div>

 </span></blockquote>No shame in that, Debi!!  Speaking strictly for myself, I don&#39;t think I <br/>
ever want my responses to be too second nature.  Every situation is <br/>
different, and a lot of what I rely on to determine my response has to do <br/>
with more careful consideration than automatic responses.  True, my default <br/>
is set on &quot;yes,&quot; and I try to make sure I say &quot;yes&quot; whenever I can. But, <br/>
sometimes in order to say yes I have to think about how best to do it and <br/>
what ramifications Yes may have on other folks (one person&#39;s yes can be <br/>
result in another person&#39;s no).<br/>
<br/>
What I feel so glad for you about is that in your reasoning this out, you <br/>
were going for the most compassionate way rather than the most convenient <br/>
way for you or some nebulous what-would-be-best-for-the-child solution.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad for you.<br/>
