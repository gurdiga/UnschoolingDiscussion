<div id="ygrps-yiv-806253132">&lt;Learning is certainly measurable. Johnny can read<br/>
or they can&#39;t.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I disagree with this statement for a couple of reasons.  My son is <br/>
10 and can&#39;t read, so does that mean that unschooling has been a <br/>
failure?  No way!!!  He is learning to read without the frustration <br/>
that kids in public school feel but he may not learn how to read <br/>
proficiently until 13, who knows.  I guess if you are only looking <br/>
at adults then maybe you could measure some of it in some way but <br/>
not all of it.<br/>
<br/>
It is kind of like when they test kids in school.  Lets say they are <br/>
asking a question about a battle in the Civil War.  Johnny might <br/>
remember the date the battle was fought, Betty might remember the <br/>
place the battle was fought.  If the question was on the date then <br/>
Betty appears to not have learned as much, when in fact, she <br/>
probably knows a little more about the actual battle.  So in that <br/>
way learning is not measurable.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing to consider is what is the measure of success.  Some <br/>
people might say a degree, others money..........there are so many <br/>
ways to measure success.  I measure success by is the person happy?  <br/>
Do they love what they do?  Are they healthy, happy, and whole?  To <br/>
put it in a nutshell.  Some of the most &quot;successful&quot; people I know <br/>
would not be the ones that society deems as &quot;smart&quot; and they aren&#39;t <br/>
necessarily the ones that are making lots of money and have fancy <br/>
houses.  That is how society measures success though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-567573177">Heidi, I agree.  I was an excellent reader in that I could rattle off<br/>
a page of words but it wasn&#39;t until I was in college that I had really<br/>
good comprehension or developed any writing skills to speak of.  But I<br/>
tested well because of the question / answer format--- mostly multiple<br/>
choice.  It was like a game of intuition where my pencil hovered on<br/>
what I felt was the correct answer.  Might as well as sometimes the<br/>
questions weren&#39;t particularly well written or were perhaps<br/>
intentionally ambiguous.  <br/>
<br/>
My sister in law just tested her 9 year old homeschooler and I was<br/>
struck by how badly worded the tests were.  Some of them made<br/>
absolutely no sense.  ANYhoodle.  But that&#39;s a thread I won&#39;t start.<br/>
