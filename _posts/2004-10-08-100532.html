<div id="ygrps-yiv-369358391">&lt;&lt;Our homeschooling wasn&#39;t top-down.  Each child decided as he or she was <br/>
school-age.  And they&#39;re all home at 12, 15 and 18.&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Well, I consider ours top down. We started homeschooling. As they got older they could, of course, choose whether to continue, or whether to go about their education in some other way. However, when they were 5, I didn&#39;t send them to school, we unschooled. To me, that shows a certain bias. :-) Of the 5, one unschooled completely, two have gone to school in high school, one still unschools and one is just 2; <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Living where we live wasn&#39;t top down either.  We asked all the kids <br/>
what they would like in a house and we made a list and looked.  Holly and Kirby <br/>
were disappointed at first because Kirby doesn&#39;t like change, and Holly had <br/>
liked another house we almost had but lost.  They&#39;re happy now, though.  She <br/>
has changed rooms three times (four rooms have been &quot;her room&quot; in six <br/>
years).  The last change was because she wanted more shelves, so she talked me out of my office upstairs. &lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Again, I guess I don&#39;t see that as not top down for us. My husband and I choose the state we live in before the children came along. We have discussed moving, we have family in two different states and none here. We haven&#39;t moved because the kids don&#39;t want to. They have friends here, the two in high school like the school they attend, etc. However, had we started out in a different state, then they probably would have chosen to stay there. My oldest did choose to move closer to family in another state when she was 19, and lived there for almost 5 years, although she is back home with us now.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think philosophy is more important than politics.  Politics has to do <br/>
with interpersonals.  Philosophy is internal to the person.&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I think they are both important, and philosophy is probably more important to me. I feel that many of my beliefs and values are based on my personal philosophy of life. Homeschooling/unschooling fit right in with my earthy crunchy parenting philosophy, and that&#39;s why we started out that way.However, for us, at least, homeschooling and unschooling were political as well. <br/>
<br/>
-- think they have a right to &quot;know&quot; my husband and I as we are, not <br/>
as a facade we put on for their benefit.--<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This suggests (perhaps unintentionally) that others here are putting on <br/>
a facade.&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
It was not my intent to suggest that others are putting on a facade. I apologize if it came across that way. What I tried to say was that for us, putting our beliefs aside to let the children buy/have/do what they wanted would seem to be a false relationship. I *do* care about what products/people/companies we support and do not support. I would have to put that aside and pretend that I did not. We chose to focus on explaining what we liked and disliked about things, and emphasize that everyone gets to choose for themselves what is important, and what actions they want to take supporting those. <br/>
 <br/>
For my family, as I said, that seems to have worked, because they have shown that they will make decisions independently of their father and I. They can even hold their own in heated discussions about our differences. Sometimes I&#39;ve been the one to re-think a position, or change my mind. Sometimes none of changes anything, but we certainly understand each other&#39;s positions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701692882">Replying to several posts at once here.<br/>
 <br/>
I tried to make it clear that I won&#39;t spend my money on things I don&#39;t approve of, and that the kids may spend their money on things if they wish. However, I am trying to be factual, as well. When my children are/were small, they didn&#39;t get much choice, it is true. I boycott Nestle, I don&#39;t spend my money on Nestle, and so they didn&#39;t get Nestle, either, as long as they wre dependent on me to get it. If my two year old picks up a Butterfinger at the grocery store, I say that mommy doesn&#39;t like to buy that kind, and point to a nice Hershey something next to it. So far, so good with that one.<br/>
 <br/>
When they got Nestle trick or treating I didn&#39;t make them throw it out. If they got a Disney video as a gift, they could keep it and watch it. When they got older and had spending money, they could choose to buy Nestle with it. For most of my children, most of the time, by the time they had their own money they didn&#39;t choose to buy it.<br/>
 <br/>
The Nestle boycott has been going on since about 1980. I don&#39;t see that my refusing to buy Nestle for the last 20+ years has had much of an effect on them, it&#39;s true. However, for me it&#39;s about *me*, about personal integrity. No, it won&#39;t matter to Nestle if I only boycott them 98% of the time. It does matter to me. It also matters to me that I model my consistenty in standing up for the things I believe. It does, however, keep me from going off the deep end if someone else gives my kids a Crunch bar. <br/>
 <br/>
I boycotted Nestle before I had any children. My husband, my oldest daughter and I decided to boycott Disney several years ago, when the others were too young to voice an opinion. Other things that have come up since then we have discussed and decided as a family. Things that only *I* personally won&#39;t buy, like McDonald&#39;s, I don&#39;t refer to as a family boycott. Things that we all decided not to buy, like Nestle, I consider the family to be boycotting, even if some members of the family aren&#39;t as strict about it as others. Since we all made the decision, and since everyone abides by it most of the time, I consider the family to be boycotting. <br/>
 <br/>
There are a few things that we all originally decided on that later on one or more of the  kids decided they didn&#39;t agree with any longer. In those cases, I also don&#39;t say that the family boycotts those things (or whatever) but if it came up I might say that I or my husband or my oldest daughter or whoever does.<br/>
 <br/>
Some things I don&#39;t feel that strongly about, but if I care enough to research something, talk it over with my family, and decide to not support it, then I&#39;m going to act on my decision. If I didn&#39;t particularly care for Nestle, but I was willing to buy it now and again, I wouldn&#39;t say I boycott them.<br/>
 <br/>
For the sake of accuracy, however, I still have to say that I feel most of these things started out as top down decisions. My two year old doesn&#39;t get Nestle, even though he can have candy. I expect it to be several years before he has the financial ability to honestly decide for himself  whether he wants to boycott Nestle or not. In the meantime, I am going to continue to say that I don&#39;t want to spend my money on that particular thing, and would he like a Reese&#39;s cup instead. FWIW, I have bought him food at McDonald&#39;s, even though I won&#39;t eat there, because I buy it occasionaly for others in the family who have decided that they don&#39;t boycott McDonald&#39;s.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and I waited a while to give my kids the dead babies version of Nestle. For years I simply said that Mommy didn&#39;t like to buy nestle products. I think my middle girls were about 11 and 12 before I went through the whoole nine yards with them, because they asked. However, I will talk about what I don&#39;t like about Disney to even the two year old sometimes. Depends on the situation.<br/>

in their own decisions despite opposition, that would be useful. But if what<br/>
you know is based on children who are genetically strong willed, it&#39;s not<br/>
going to be generally useful.<br/>

This reminds me of an incident from yesterday.<br/>
I was at the local skatepark with 2 of my children and 3 other moms <br/>
and their children.  There was a soda machine which had various <br/>
kinds of soda and also water bottles.  One boy (age 10) had a bunch <br/>
of change in his pocket but but needed a little more from his mom to <br/>
have enough for a drink.  He then came back with a Mountain Dew.  <br/>
His mom saw, said &quot;absolutely not&quot; and took the Mountain Dew away, <br/>
putting it under her legs.  She said &quot;I thought you were getting <br/>
water!&quot; to which he replied &quot;I pushed the water button but Mountain <br/>
Dew came out.&quot;  She wouldn&#39;t let him drink it, so he immediately <br/>
deferred to her and skated away without the slightest complaint or <br/>
even a tiny attempt at negotiation.<br/>
I was completely amazed, and said so. <br/>
 <br/>
My oldest son would have protested *loudly* if I had taken control <br/>
of him in that way, as he has since he was a toddler.  He has a very <br/>
strong voice.  Even my second son, who&#39;s much &quot;easier&quot; (goes along <br/>
with his father and I without argument) would have *at least* <br/>
attempted to negotiate.  This boy- nothing.<br/>
<br/>
The ensuing conversation ended up with the moms agreeing it was a <br/>
personality thing.  Which led me to think... isn&#39;t it worrisome for <br/>
a child to obey so unquestionably?  To go against his own wishes and <br/>
desires *so* automatically without even thinking of asserting his <br/>
own voice?  I&#39;m glad my children think for themselves.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s sadistic of the mom to withhold liquid from a child who&#39;s <br/>
skating, while she&#39;s sitting.  But then I live in the desert where it&#39;s no joke, no <br/>
option, withholding liquid.  And I&#39;m not sadistic.<br/>
<br/>
I think a case of Mountain Dew would do less damage to that child than a <br/>
single moment with a mother who disregards him and his needs to that extent.<br/>
<br/>
But here I am again, taking the side of a child.  And that&#39;s why some parents <br/>
get really angry with me, because I honestly think parenting should be about <br/>
children, not about parents&#39; comfort and parental control.   When there is an <br/>
adversarial relationship between a parent and child (as in this one, where the <br/>
mom &quot;WON&quot; by confiscating that drink, and the child LOST), it makes a child <br/>
small.  It wounds the child.  And if it doesn&#39;t wound the mother to be so cruel <br/>
to her own child, there&#39;s something defective in that mother.<br/>
<br/>
IF for some reason he really couldn&#39;t (for health reasons) have Mountain Dew, <br/>
and if I were the mom, I&#39;d&#39;ve jumped up and gone to get a bottle of water.  <br/>
And if Mountain Dew came out when I pused the water button, I would have <br/>
apologized profusely and in public to that child, and found him some water as <br/>
quickly as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Is that about unschooling?<br/>
It&#39;s about respect for children, anyway.  <br/>
I&#39;m always surprised by people who will spend their whole lives, all day, all <br/>
week, all year with their children but who don&#39;t learn to respect and trust <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
When a child goes to school and the mother&#39;s relationship with him is distant <br/>
or cold, school and other separations and expectations can take some of the <br/>
blame.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh well. It wasn&#39;t an unschooling family, was it?<br/>

&gt; to her own child, there&#39;s something defective in that mother.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She truly believes things like Mountain Dew (caffeine, corn syrup) <br/>
are dangerous for a child and it&#39;s her role as &quot;mother bear&quot; to <br/>
protect him from such things.  So she felt she had  his best <br/>
interests at heart.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Oh well. It wasn&#39;t an unschooling family, was it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, yes and no.  She&#39;s quite anti-school/school at home, but <br/>
believes controlling children to a large degree is part of doing her <br/>
job as their mother.  Actually she doesn&#39;t even see it as <br/>
controlling, she sees it as protecting.  <br/>
Therefore, if I let *my* kids drink Mountain Dew I&#39;m not doing a <br/>
good job of protecting my children in her eyes.<br/>
I know many mothers like this, I just brought up this particular <br/>
example because it was fresh in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s often implied to me that I don&#39;t protect (read &quot;control&quot;) my <br/>
children enough.  Whether it&#39;s Mountain Dew, climbing trees, or <br/>
whatever, my children make their own choices as to what&#39;s in their <br/>
comfort range, and this makes other people very uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
There was a little boy here the other day who had never skateboarded <br/>
before and within a very short time of using one of our extras had <br/>
picked it up quickly.  He said that he had asked for a skateboard <br/>
last year (for his birthday?) but didn&#39;t get one.  When his mom came <br/>
for him she was visibly nervous and tense watching him.  <br/>
We live five blocks from the ocean, and this little boy lives even <br/>
closer, but she told me that her son doesn&#39;t go in it because she&#39;s <br/>
taught him that the ocean is &quot;not his friend.&quot;  She seems to believe <br/>
that danger is lurking everywhere and it&#39;s only her hyper-vigilance <br/>
and rules keeping him safe.   He seems to believe her.  <br/>

<br/>
When Dylan was pretty little he&#39;d sometimes get a red bumpy rash on the<br/>
palms of his hands.  It started about the time he discovered modeling<br/>
clay and people around us suggested he was having a reaction to some<br/>
ingredient in the clay.  The dye was the chief suspect.  I talked to<br/>
Dylan and mentioned the idea the clay might be causing his rash and he<br/>
said he&#39;d rather have the rash then give up the clay. <br/>
<br/>
His rash would come and go and he was often playing with clay, getting<br/>
more and different types.   <br/>
We tried different clays from art supply stores but he really liked the<br/>
colored clays.  Relatives and friends kept offering advice and my sister<br/>
in law said more than once &quot;If he was my child that&#39;d be the end of that<br/>
clay!&quot; <br/>
  <br/>
He would lay a vinyl table cloth on the floor and sit and work on clay. <br/>
Sometimes he&#39;d stand up and mash it with his little bare feet.  He had<br/>
rash on his feet too, so more and more it seemed like the clay, but Dylan<br/>
was absolutely willing to trade out the fun and fulfillment of clay for<br/>
the sometimes discomfort of the rash.   (He makes wonderful dinosaurs and<br/>
monsters and is very interested in claymation animation style movies.) <br/>
<br/>
We visited a doctor who said &quot;contact dermatitis.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t take the clay away from him.   <br/>
<br/>
Fast forward to this spring, his rash got quite bad and he decided he&#39;d<br/>
like to see a doctor to see if there was a cream or something he could<br/>
use.  We had tried different over the counter stuff and some things<br/>
seemed to help for a little while but the rash would return.  He was  in<br/>
martial arts and though he could wear Tae Kwon Do shoes which covered the<br/>
rash on his feet he was getting comments from kids in class about the<br/>
rash on his palms.  It was bad, splitting and thick skinned and itchy. <br/>
<br/>
We went to a dermatologist who took one look and said it was psoriasis.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How about that? <br/>
<br/>
Dylan believed me when I said it was probably clay, but he made the<br/>
choice to continue to work with it.<br/>
I could have fought with him, taken away the clay and made him miserable<br/>
for how many weeks or months before we discovered it wasn&#39;t clay at all.<br/>
I could have remained convinced it was some kind of contact dermatitis<br/>
and started eliminating other things he loved.   I could have decided it<br/>
was an allergy and made him give up his favorite things. <br/>
<br/>
Little side note here;  He quit eating peppers and tomatoes and potatoes<br/>
about the time his rash appeared and a couple things that sometimes<br/>
exacerbate psoriasis for some people are peppers, tomatoes and potatoes.<br/>
<br/>
Kids know more about what they need and don&#39;t need than most people ever<br/>
consider.   I&#39;m glad I listened to what he wanted.  I wouldn&#39;t have done<br/>
him any good and he wouldn&#39;t feel the same way about me today if I<br/>
hadn&#39;t.<br/>

&lt;&lt; In some parenting philosophies disobedience is the only crime that must be<br/>
punished. Kids are immediately spanked for disobeying.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been spanked on the spot because my mother was wrong about something.<br/>
<br/>
Like the boy who pressed water and got Mountain Dew--at least his mom didn&#39;t <br/>
&quot;spank him for lying&quot; without even checking.  That&#39;s why I thought she should <br/>
go and try to buy some water.  He might have been absolutely and simply <br/>
correct that the water slot was loaded with Mountain Dew.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been &quot;spanked for lying&quot; when I was telling the truth.<br/>
It is certainly not a good way to reward truthfulness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-485262064">** We live five blocks from the ocean, and this little boy lives even<br/>
closer, but she told me that her son doesn&#39;t go in it because she&#39;s<br/>
taught him that the ocean is &quot;not his friend.&quot;  She seems to believe<br/>
that danger is lurking everywhere and it&#39;s only her hyper-vigilance<br/>
and rules keeping him safe.   He seems to believe her. **<br/>
<br/>
What an unfortunate way to live.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about how fear is used to motivate people.  It is <br/>
particularly apparent in some of the discussion about the U.S. <br/>
presidential election.  And someone at the park pointed out that teasers <br/>
for the evening news are usually about danger.  &quot;Tune in to find about <br/>
the new hazard in our water...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What can we suggest to people who might move towards unschooling that <br/>
will help them bypass fear or transcend it or dismiss it?  (Or vaporize <br/>
it with laughter like a bogart in the Harry Potter books.)<br/>
<br/>
Desensitisation and experience are starting points to deal with fear of <br/>
the unknown, I think.  (Hence the oft-repeated advice that one needs to <br/>
jump off the cliff or jump into the water and just do it.)  <br/>
<br/>
(Maybe this is too hypothetical, since I&#39;m not really talking about a <br/>
specific person.)<br/>

anything smooshed or &#39;suspicious&#39;, etc.  Is this considered &quot;news&quot;??<br/>
