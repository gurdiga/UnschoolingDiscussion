<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480186036">As a lover of music (but fairly ignorant on history/theory/whatever), I have <br/>
a question.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering whether there&#39;s a name for what The Indigo Girls do.<br/>
<br/>
Music-wise!, you gutter-heads! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s harmonic, but it&#39;s a round, but they&#39;re singing different words, but <br/>
sometimes there are up to three voices.<br/>
<br/>
To me it&#39;s the most incredible sound. Does it have a name?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

My husband (who knows NOTHING of music theory) was reading over my shoulder<br/>
and said, &quot;Yeah, I think it is called contrapuntal harmonic babe-ality!&quot; (he<br/>
is also a fan).  LOL!  They often sing when one sings the melody and the<br/>
other sings a descant, so it is not really a round but they are singing<br/>
different words and it is a wonderful harmony sound.<br/>

<br/>
Polyphony?<br/>
That&#39;s different tunes intertwining, or melodic lines going different <br/>
directions and maybe crossing, as opposed to the parallel harmonies traditional in <br/>
western traditional  music (most C&W, doo-wop, Jr. High choral music, 19th <br/>
century hymns)<br/>
<br/>
Madrigals have usually the same words in various parts but they don&#39;t come <br/>
together too often.  Ends of verses, but I don&#39;t think anything nowadays would <br/>
be called &quot;madrigal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Counterpoint, or contrapuntal harmonies maybe?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve listened to some Indigo Girls but not all.  Maybe someone else will know.<br/>
<br/>
Another possibility is to look on google and put in indigo girls plus musical <br/>
style and maybe counterpoint or harmony and you might find some analysis in a <br/>
review.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Aside from what the Indigo Girls do, I have an Indigo Girls story:<br/>
  I was working as a waitress in Charleston, SC about 10 years ago and waited <br/>
on two really nice women. They chatted with me for awhile and then asked if <br/>
I&#39;d heard that the Indigo Girls were performing in Charleston that weekend. I <br/>
said that I had and they asked me what I was doing that weekend. I said we <br/>
would be celebrating my then-boyfriend&#39;s birthday. One of the women asked if I&#39;d <br/>
like free tickets to the show but I replied that my boyfriend didn&#39;t really <br/>
care for that kind of music. Their smiles never wavered and they left a nice tip. <br/>
I was mortified when I saw their pictures in the newspaper a few days later!<br/>
