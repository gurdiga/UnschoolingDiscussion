&quot; I don&#39;t know why people gave speeches on &quot;soap boxes&quot; <br/>
instead of &quot;fruit crates&quot; or &quot;oatmeal boxes,&quot; though.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Good point.  I wonder, to&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I found at the WordWizard Clubhouse site. (www.wordwizard.com)  <br/>
Can&#39;t vouch for the veracity, but at least it helps explain why the (sturdy) <br/>
soapboxes  vs. flimsy fruit crates. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt;100 to 150 years ago, soapboxes (actually the boxes that soap came in) were <br/>
fairly substantial wooden boxes. A couple feet high and 2-3 feet long and <br/>
wide. They were sturdy enough to stand on, high enough to let you look over a <br/>
crowd at least a little and small enough to move around easily. To give you <br/>
an idea of the substanial nature of a soapbox and their widespread use, there <br/>
is a soapbox deby run each year where kids would make cars out of soapboxes <br/>
(I suppose they use other materials today) and race them down hill.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But back to the question, many public speakers, particlarly those interested <br/>
in politics, would carry soapboxes around to stand on when they got a crowd <br/>
to listen to them and to draw attention to themselves. (Wash tubs were also <br/>
good). Thus getting up on one&#39;s soapbox became an expresion for making a <br/>
speech and now can refer to any sort of statement. I have heard that the <br/>
internet is now the soapbox of the modern world. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hyde Park in London is the first place I know of this term being used (I&#39;d be <br/>
interested if there was prior use). In fact, Speaker&#39;s Corner in Hyde Park <br/>
still exists and is in use for anyone who wants to speak. Especially on <br/>
Sundays you can go there to see advocates exercising their right to free <br/>
speech or do so yourself. I think it worth a visit if you are in London. Not <br/>
as much fun as a trial at the Old Bailey (as long as you are not the <br/>
defendant), but still good stuff.&gt;&gt;<br/>
