 </span></blockquote>Terrific idea Deb. But, it would scare the hell out of our child<br/>
hating culture. Teenagers out on the streets? Working? Not caged up<br/>
where they can keep an eye on them?<br/>

Even the teachers admit that junior high is a waste land.<br/>

&quot;Some who support more coercive strategies assume that children will<br/>
run wild if they are not controlled.  However, the children for whom<br/>
this is true typically turn out to be those accustomed to being<br/>
controlled--those who are not trusted, given explanations,<br/>
encouraged to think for themselves, helped to develop and<br/>
internalize good values, and so on. Control breeds the need for more<br/>
control, which is then used to justify the use of control.&quot;<br/>
