<div id="ygrps-yiv-571663391">&lt;&lt;We have that. We killed two animals with it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had this kind of problem with Harvest Moon.  Lanora loves it<br/>
because she is old enough to remember to feed the animals everyday. <br/>
Jonathan hasn&#39;t grasped that concept yet so his animals always die,<br/>
naturally this is upsetting.  I&#39;ve tried explaining that this is why I,<br/>
an adult, makes sure that all of our &quot;real&quot; animals get fed and watered<br/>
everyday, because it can be hard for younger people to remember.  He<br/>
seems to feel a little better but not completely over the sadness.<br/>
