appropriate consequences when natural consequences are not available.  It <br/>
takes time, patience and practice.  It&#39;s always fun and instructive to hear <br/>
in class what people tried the previous week.  I remember one mom telling us <br/>
in a fit of frustration that she told her 10 year old daughter that people <br/>
who don&#39;t clean the kitchen after dinner don&#39;t get to go on field trips.  Her <br/>
daughter calmly asked, And just what do field trips have to do with the <br/>
kitchen?  We had a good laugh over that one.  <br/>

I don&#39;t know...  maybe moms who have to stay up late cleaning the kitchen and <br/>
doing other housework by themselves are too tired or too pissed off to drive <br/>
a long way for a field trip.<br/>
<br/>
OK, I know I&#39;m stretching, but I think there is a connection.  Maybe it&#39;s too <br/>
subtle for a kid to see, though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good point!  In our Love and Logic class one of the &quot;techniques&quot; we teach is <br/>
the Brain Drain.  When your child declines to do something that you asked, <br/>
like a chore, and you have to do it for him, the consequence is that parent&#39;s <br/>
(or the family&#39;s) energy or time has been drained to the point where she may <br/>
not be able to do what the child wants, like the field trip. <br/>
