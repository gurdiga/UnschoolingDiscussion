<br/>
what do you do in those situations?<br/>
<br/>
i am reading and have read some of the how to talk so kids will listen books (right now i am reading the sibling one).  anyway, i have found them helpful and they seem to be rather unschoolish (not that i understand that term completely yet).  but i haven&#39;t found an answer to this issue yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894492025">Well,  I have 5 kids and we certainly don&#39;t have 5 of many things.  We<br/>
encourage taking turns, doing &quot;paper-rock-scissors&quot;, talking about who&#39;s<br/>
needs are more pressing.<br/>
<br/>
We also have &quot;days&quot;.  There are 7 in our family and 7 days of the week.  If<br/>
it is your &quot;day&quot;, you get control of the tv and the playstation, you get to<br/>
sit in the front seat of the van, etc..  The little guys can&#39;t remember the<br/>
names of the days of the week but they can sure keep track of how many days<br/>
until &quot;their day.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-217061890">We have four children with the oldest being much older than the last three.<br/>
So really only 3 that maybe want the same things. If it&#39;s not possible,<br/>
whoever called the desired thing first, gets it. Like the last donut or<br/>
something. Unless of course they are willing to forgo that and have<br/>
something else. I can say that we don&#39;t really have a hard time with this<br/>
here. Mostly it would be a tv show or movie and we have plenty of players<br/>
and tv&#39;s around to take care of that situation.<br/>
<br/>
But when it does happen, it&#39;s first come first serve.<br/>
