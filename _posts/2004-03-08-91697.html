<div id="ygrps-yiv-564767931">Please help spread the word about the oldest homeschooling conference in<br/>
Maryland (since 1980, secular and unschooling friendly to boot. John Holt<br/>
was the key note speaker at one of the first of these conferences!).<br/>
<br/>
==<br/>
Be sure to check out the MHEA conference at Anne Arundel Community College<br/>
(located midway between Baltimore and Annapolis) on April 3, 2004 from 8:00<br/>
am to 5:30 pm. The keynote speaker is Daniel Pink, author of &quot;Free Agent<br/>
Nation&quot; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fun-books.com/books/8791.htm)">http://www.fun-books.com/books/8791.htm)</a>. Mr Pink makes a strong<br/>
argument for homeschooling being an excellent preparation for the changing<br/>
workforce.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the keynote speech, there will be lots of workshops for new<br/>
homeschoolers as well as veteran homeschoolers. There will be a talent show,<br/>
a panel of homeschool graduates speaking about their experiences in the real<br/>
world of college, work and the military and much more! Lunch will be<br/>
available on the premises.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there will be a Local Support Group fair with representatives invited<br/>
from every support group in Maryland, a Resource Fair with a wide variety of<br/>
vendors offering homeschooling materials (FUN Books, www.FUN-Books.com, will<br/>
be there with lots of great materials - you can order in advance and pick up<br/>
at the conference to save shipping and ensure the items you want will be<br/>
available, or you can request specific items you want brought for you to<br/>
see), and there will be a used curriculum sale/swap/give-away fair.<br/>
<br/>
