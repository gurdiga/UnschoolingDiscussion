<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132133045">This all made me think of the talent show at the last HUG <br/>
conference.  One little four year old gorl (cute as could be) said <br/>
during the show that she wanted to dance.  We let her and she stood <br/>
up there in front of everyone and just started moving her feet <br/>
around. <br/>
<br/>
What could have been so embarrassing was made into a really <br/>
powerfully empowering moment for that little girl.  Instead of anyone <br/>
ridculing or acting embarrassed, Sandra started playing the perfect <br/>
song for the movement on her recorder and everyone joined in <br/>
clapping.  It was the highlight of the show!<br/>
<br/>
At other HUG conferences we&#39;ve had kids get up and then sit back <br/>
down, unable to perform but no made fun of them.  Sometimes they were <br/>
encouraged and went through with their act.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the participants didn&#39;t have a traditional talent.  One kid <br/>
could puff his chin out like a frog.  David Albert does this funny <br/>
contortion thing with his arms and tells a great story with it.  Some <br/>
have shown art work and there are always lots of skits.<br/>
<br/>
Gosh, how I wish I could have been in environment like that as a <br/>
child!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  You don&#39;t need to apologize! The list is here so you can bring your questions and assumptions to it and have them answered or challenged. At least that&#39;s how I see it. I think it&#39;s great that you bring these things here not only for yourself but because they make others like me question how I do things. Your post on your daughter wanted to dance has had me thinking since I read it. So thank you...and no more sorrys!<br/>
