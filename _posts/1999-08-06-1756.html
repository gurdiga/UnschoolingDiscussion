<h4>Your Name</h4>
<p><small><time> 6 Aug 1999, at  8:22am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-271070754">When my oldest son was in preschool I had people suggesting he was ADD and I<br/>
should have him tested.  I spoke to one of the teachers about it and she<br/>
said that her brother had ADD.  She told me that if you see a child with ADD<br/>
you don&#39;t have to wonder if they need help you know it.  There is a big<br/>
difference in treating a child like this and medicating a large group of<br/>
children who do not fit into the classroom situation.  Because doctors and<br/>
teachers (who seem to make many of these diagnoses) don&#39;t differentiate<br/>
between the children with clinical ADD and those who are medicated for the<br/>
convenience of the teacher (and often the parent) it is difficult to discuss<br/>
the issue.  Many of us live with children who would be diagnosed as ADD if<br/>
they were in the school system and we know our kids do not need medication.<br/>
I would not assume that all children labeled ADD are misdiagnosed and I<br/>
would not pretend to know what it is like to live with these children.<br/>
Basically, we are talking about apples and oranges here but society&#39;s label<br/>
is the same.  It would be cumbersome to always write &quot;those children who are<br/>
labeled ADD but are fine (although challenging)  if they are not in school&quot;.<br/>
Using labels in e-mail is a real problem.  In a face to face discussion you<br/>
would say - well I am not talking about children with clinical ADD or some<br/>
such thing and the other person wouldn&#39;t be feeling judged.  Yet if you have<br/>
to clarify the label every time you use it - it would be impossible to read.<br/>
Not sure what the answer is.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is very difficult for parents to buck the teachers if they are<br/>
recommending Ritalin.  If the parent believes that the schools/teachers know<br/>
what they are doing they think it will help their child succeed.  I think<br/>
that it is also often a relief for the parents who have been struggling with<br/>
&quot;controlling&quot; these kids and trying to get them to conform.  Most people and<br/>
particularly parents who don&#39;t have spirited children are very ready and<br/>
vocal in telling you that your parenting is the problem.  That you are<br/>
failing your child by not making them behave appropriately.  What a relief<br/>
to be told that your child has a medical problem that he/she can be treated<br/>
for.  What a relief that their grades in school will improve and that the<br/>
teacher will no longer be &quot;picking&quot; on your child.  Although I strongly<br/>
disagree with these parents decision to medicate (not talking about true ADD<br/>
here) I do understand and I do believe that many if not most parents are<br/>
doing what they believe is the best thing for their child.<br/>

<br/>
I agree with your comments about teaching children how to respect others.<br/>
It takes longer with some children but it is important to persist.  I also<br/>
had to realize that there were some group things I could not do with my<br/>
child.  As much as I wanted to be there and as much as I wanted him to be<br/>
there it was not reasonable to disrupt the group because my child didn&#39;t<br/>
cooperate.  I just had to wait until he could function well in that<br/>
situation.  That is not to say that I didn&#39;t try things - I just didn&#39;t keep<br/>
doing them if they didn&#39;t work well for my child or others.  It isn&#39;t good<br/>
for children to be in situations that they can&#39;t handle either - no matter<br/>
how much we think it might be good for them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&#39;you have to play my way,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>because I&#39;m gifted and I so know better than you what to do&#39;. His sister was<br/>
very<br/>
much the same, but is finally learning, the hard way, at 12,<br/>
<br/>
I think I hate the gifted label as much as I hate any other label.  Not<br/>
every parent or child abuses it but I think it is so easy to misuse this<br/>
information.  If it helps a parent find appropriate activities for the child<br/>
great.  However, it is getting to the stage ( I suspect when interacting<br/>
with high achieving parents) that every child is either gifted, ADD, or has<br/>
learning disabilities - what happened to normal or average.  By definition<br/>
most children are average.  A very small % of children (2.5% at either end<br/>
of the spectrum) have fall outside the curve.  I want to start some kind of<br/>
group for average children - not really that is a joke - I truly do not see<br/>
any benefits in labeling my child.  No child is gifted in all areas.  I<br/>
think it behooves us to remember that.  No matter how smart my son is about<br/>
reading or numbers or facts or figures every other kid out there will<br/>
probably be better than him at something.  Thank goodness.  We all can have<br/>
some aspect of our lives that we feel good at.  Gifted children need to know<br/>
this.  If not they feel better than others and confused when they can&#39;t do<br/>
something well.  It is almost setting them up for failure in life.  The<br/>
statistics on Mensa people indicate that they are not all that successful in<br/>
life.  Obviously some are successful but so are many people who don&#39;t have<br/>
these amazing IQ&#39;s.  It is great for kids to feel that they are good at<br/>
certain things but they also need to know that they don&#39;t have to be good at<br/>
everything.<br/>
One of the big benefits of unschooling is that you can work with your child<br/>
at whatever level they are capable of without having to compare to others.<br/>
It is irrelevant to the child that they are reading at 5th grade level when<br/>
they are 4.  How does that help them learn more stuff in interesting ways?<br/>
How does that help them be a better person?  How does that help the parent<br/>
you are telling whose 9 year old isn&#39;t reading?  How does it make others<br/>
want to interact with your child?   It is great to feel proud of your<br/>
child&#39;s achievements but the child must feel that you are proud of them not<br/>
what they can do.<br/>
I repeat that I do not think that everyone who labels their child is<br/>
misusing that label.  I repeat that deterring the ways in which your child<br/>
is different from others can be very helpful for parents who use that<br/>
information to change their expectations of the child or provide appropriate<br/>
stimuli for them.  I am not talking about you here.  It can also be helpful<br/>
to share that information with people that the child interacts with so they<br/>
can adjust their expectations.</div>

In my day (&quot;the good ol&#39; days&quot;...OK, OK, so I&#39;m older than most of you!) if <br/>
you had trouble reading, they sent you into another room for remedial work at <br/>
the same time as the rest of the class had their regular reading time.  There <br/>
were no other remedial classes...just in reading.  There was no &quot;gifted&quot; <br/>
program, you just did more work, i.e., I did both 3rd and 6th grades in 1 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922208552">Hi Jill<br/>
<br/>
I liked your comments. I have one son who had tantrums. Eventually I worked out<br/>
somethings that helped a bit - like making sure he had food and drink on a far<br/>
more precisely regular basis that any of my other kids needed. But really, it is<br/>
partly just his temperament - guess who he inherited it from :-(<br/>
<br/>
The great thing about homeschooling is that he has had the space to work through<br/>
it. At 15 he has more control than his 47yo mother! When he was little I removed<br/>
him. As he got older, he removed himself. Older still, he learned to remove<br/>
himself when he felt himself getting wound up. In school that just couldn&#39;t have<br/>
happened.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The hard bit is when you have other children, who then get angry that their fun<br/>
has been spoiled, so it&#39;s great if you can find a sympathetic friend who is<br/>
willing to take on your other children while you remove the disruptive one.<br/>
<br/>

great. But it can put tremendous pressure on the child, and can be badly abused.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is interesting that even among gifted children groups there is much talk<br/>
about theories such as Howard Gardner&#39;s multiple intelligences, yet when it<br/>
comes down to it some sort of intelligences (interpersonal, bodily-kinesthetic)<br/>
are only accepted as such if they are associated with the more traditionally<br/>
academic areas.<br/>
<br/>

because of low self esteem, due to unreal expectations of themselves.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; what they can do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve become uncomfortable with the whole concept of &#39;pride&#39;. It seems like if I<br/>
am proud of my child&#39;s achievements, I am somehow taking ownership of the<br/>
achievement for myself, and away from the child??? Being happy for them seems a<br/>
more open way.<br/>

 In my opinion -- and I certainly am no expert except<br/>
 in my knowledge of myself and my children -- having<br/>
 ADD just means you may process information and<br/>
 situations differently than some other people. But<br/>
 then, introverts process information differently than<br/>
 extroverts. That doesn&#39;t make introversion or<br/>
 extroversion a handicap.<br/>

sure, there are various ways people process information that you could use to <br/>
describe certain types of people. That does not equal &quot;disabled&quot; in any way. <br/>
Only in a school situation.<br/>
In the context of unschooling it is pointless. I&#39;m glad you trusted your own <br/>
wisdom on this.  There are real disabilities that a parent might need some <br/>
extra information or help for, I&#39;m not trying to downplay the need for <br/>
outside help in some cases.<br/>

any difficulties he may yet face.  There has been tremendous progress <br/>
in attitude and it is much easier to aid him in learning different <br/>

The type of people that fit the &quot;ADD&quot; profile tend to have many food <br/>
sensitivities and do a lot better when their diet is looked at and taken into <br/>
account. This is more typical of those that get the ADHD label.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-786606635">I am new to this website, so I am jumping in the<br/>
middle, but I have read an excellent book that<br/>
addresses the whole ADD and ADHD issue.  The Myth of<br/>
ADD by Thomas Armstrong, PhD.<br/>
<br/>
I have two children one 19 with &quot;ADD&quot; and one 9 with<br/>
&quot;ADHD&quot;.  I found this book to be an excellent source<br/>
of information and it also helped me to see my<br/>
children  as just kids and not kids with ADD or ADHD. <br/>
Just that mind set alone does alot to change the<br/>
atmosphere of the home.<br/>
<br/>
We cannot change any child so we must change ourselves<br/>
and our approach to our children without labeling<br/>
them.<br/>
The more we accept them and all children the way they<br/>
are instead of trying to control them the better they<br/>
will be.  I find that all kids want what we want<br/>
someone to love them unconditionally.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685545505">Well there are two schools of thought (forgive the pun !).  One side <br/>
believes it is a behavioral problem that may be exacerbated by <br/>
allergies or a nutritional deficiency and there is the other camp <br/>
that believes there is a physiological component... guess which sides <br/>
we&#39;re on  &lt;G&gt;  In all fairness though, I too have done extensive <br/>
researching into this.  I have come to the conclusion that in OUR <br/>
case, there appears to be a genetic predisposition to this. I don&#39;t <br/>
believe it is solely a behavioral problem. ..without a doubt it &quot;runs <br/>
in the family&quot;, both sides. There are also some other closely <br/>
related &quot;syndromes&quot; from each side of the families that enters into <br/>
the mix.  Of course we&#39;ve tried everything possible to help alleviate <br/>
the situation (Feingold Diet, allergy testing, nutritional <br/>
supplements along with standard courses of treatment).<br/>
<br/>
OK.  I just deleted  several paragraphs of me stating my &quot;defense&quot;.  <br/>
I&#39;m done on this topic, I could go on all day.  I should never have <br/>

<br/>
You are very correct. I&#39;ll add to that, though, that<br/>
some are much more successful at developing coping<br/>
skills than others. And to that I&#39;ll add that some<br/>
people cope well in some areas of their lives and fail<br/>
miserably in others. There&#39;s a very broad spectrum.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I do agree that certain individuals can have very<br/>

something.....there are very real challenges with<br/>
certain people. But <br/>
it&#39;s <br/>
not ADD. It does only exist in schools.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ren, I agree and I believe this is such an important<br/>
part. With myself, I know that I do better in some<br/>
environments and situations than I do in others. So I<br/>
choose to put myself into those environments in which<br/>
I can have a reasonable expectation of success. Or at<br/>
least fairly low odds of miserable failure. I work<br/>
part-time at a job that has a very flexible schedule.<br/>
I work at home, and I do most of my work from 4am to<br/>
7am because that&#39;s when my mental faculties are most<br/>
sharp. There may be some days when I work like crazy<br/>
(in ADD-world, they call that &quot;hyper-focus&quot;. It&#39;s a<br/>
damn handy trait, in my opinion!!) and days in a row<br/>
when I just don&#39;t get much done at all.<br/>
<br/>
I feel fortunate to have an employment situation that<br/>
allows me to use my strengths and circumvent my<br/>
limitations. I&#39;ve done the 9-5 in the past and it has<br/>
been really difficult for me.<br/>
<br/>
My son, similarly, had a really difficult time with<br/>
the structure of school. Well, lucky us! We can<br/>
unschool and he can learn in a free and open<br/>
environment around people who value him and his<br/>
talents instead of labeling him an &quot;ADD CHILD&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;As unschoolers, ADD is a moot point.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t exist. What exists is a child, with<br/>
individual needs, <br/>
individual <br/>
desires and challenges and not a problem to be fixed.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely. And if you&#39;ve gone through the mental<br/>
anguish of deciding how to &quot;fix&quot; your ADD child, this<br/>
is very liberating. <br/>
<br/>
In my previous post, I certainly didn&#39;t mean to<br/>
minimize the challenges associated with raising a<br/>
child with ADD traits. I&#39;m doing it, too. I&#39;ve walked<br/>
in those shoes! So I&#39;m sorry if that&#39;s what it<br/>
appeared that I was doing.<br/>
<br/>
I just choose not to see ADD as a disability. If that<br/>
makes me delusional or naive, so be it. We&#39;re going<br/>
along merrily so far, sans public school and ADD<br/>
treatment.<br/>

I will however, glady discuss the issues surrounding ADD and <br/>

believe in it or not, you still need to develop coping skills to deal <br/>

it explains why he gets sweaty when he eats too many Krispy Kremes.  <br/>

there, simply get on with life. In a public school, and I&#39;m sure in <br/>
some homes, ADD can be used as a negative thing. It can be used as an <br/>
excuse, as said before, it can have a devastatingly squashing effect <br/>
(not allowing who that person is to be fully appreciated and <br/>
actualized among a myriad of other things).  It doesn&#39;t have to be <br/>
that way.  It can be a spring board into greatness.  The &quot;dark side&quot; <br/>
of ADD can in reality be the best part of all, can be that person&#39;s <br/>
greatest strength.  It&#39;s PART of the tools and talents that person is <br/>
born with.  I will not deny that part of my sons life.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; I&#39;m done on this topic, I could go on all day.  I should never <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; started.  The discussion of the reality (or not) of ADD belongs on <br/>
&gt; another message board. Guess we&#39;ll have to agree to disagree.  <br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why should such things not be discussed in a group of parents who <br/>
are dealing <br/>
&gt; with issues of how children learn, and the damage that schools and <br/>
testing <br/>
&gt; and labelling can do to children?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It doesn&#39;t matter who agrees or disagrees, because outside of the <br/>
three or <br/>
&gt; four who are discussing it are several hundred who are reading and <br/>
thinking.<br/>

I don&#39;t think anyone suggested denying any part of him. I believe the <br/>
suggestion is that possibly one day, you won&#39;t feel it&#39;s necessary to use <br/>
that label at all.<br/>

&quot;Again, what I said was I will not debate whether ADD exists or not. <br/>
I will however, gladly discuss the issues surrounding ADD and <br/>
unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess I don&#39;t feel like &quot;proving&quot; it because I&#39;ve already been <br/>
there, done that on an attention deficit message board.  This is an <br/>
unschooling message board.  Discussing the use of labels, how an <br/>
attention-deficit type person learns, these are the types of issues <br/>
I&#39;m concerned with now.  Now that I&#39;m thinking about it,what I&#39;d <br/>
REALLY like to know is if there are any adult ADD unschoolers out <br/>
there and how they&#39;re doing.  I&#39;d like to find out how any adult <br/>
unschoolers are doing.  I&#39;ll ask that by posting another question <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you out there that may be interested in the veracity of <br/>
ADD, here are a couple of URL&#39;s to get you started on making your own <br/>
decision.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
alt.support.attn-deficit (a Google Group)- a lot of people here with <br/>
varying opinions<br/>

&lt;&lt; There are just as many people that wish they had that label to save <br/>
them a lifetime of grief.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Labels do not save grief.<br/>
Knowledge can save grief, and now that you have the knowledge, what good does <br/>
it do to use it to define your child?  What benefit is there in his wearing <br/>
that &quot;diagnosis&quot; for life?<br/>
<br/>
There are NOT &quot;just as many people&quot; who wish they were labelled &quot;disabled.&quot;<br/>
Even a label of &quot;giftedness&quot; does lifelong damage.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, knowledge of dyslexia 80 years ago would have saved a whole lot of grief <br/>
and stupid school policy.  But if someone is dyslexic, the goal of the <br/>
parents is to be more patient with his learning to read, not to remind him <br/>
regularly &quot;Well, you&#39;re dysLEXic, and so your whole life will be different.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My dad was a lefty forced to use his right hand in school in the 1930&#39;s, and <br/>
he had a VERY hard time reading and writing in his whole life.  It&#39;s too bad <br/>
he wasn&#39;t aware that he wasn&#39;t the only one, and that it was NOT laziness or <br/>
being a bad, uncooperative boy.    <br/>
<br/>
But his name was Kirby Adams, not &quot;a dyslexic man.&quot;  He was Kirby Adams who <br/>
had a good job and worked hard and was honest and generous and funny, not <br/>
&quot;Kirby Adams who is dyslexic.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My middle child has some symptoms of dyslexia, but instead of me teaching him <br/>
that term or discussing it, I have told him LOTS of people read late, and <br/>
it&#39;s not easy for everyone to know which way a three goes, and that he WILL <br/>
pick it up but just later, and in the meantime there are hundreds of things <br/>
he CAN do as well or better than others.  Puzzles.  Sports.  Putting things <br/>
together and keeping them operational.   He knows his physical skills and his <br/>
logic surpassnmanship practice book.  Many parents might have done that <br/>
instead, or told him he could have new bearings if he did a page of numbers <br/>
or something.<br/>
<br/>
He is Martin Dodd.  He is not a dyslexic boy.  He will do fine, and he will <br/>
do better without being branded.<br/>
<br/>
When kids have short attention spans, I don&#39;t give them hour-long projects!<br/>
When kids have the ability to focus almost entirely on one thing for two <br/>
days, stopping MAYBE to eat and sleep, then I get out of their way, bring <br/>
them some food and let them have the freedom to be who they are instead of <br/>
stopping their lives to tell them they have a set of biochemical realities <br/>
which would be labelled thus&#39;n&#39;such at school, and that it&#39;s not REALLY a <br/>
disability, but can be an advantage.<br/>
<br/>
Those whose kids haven&#39;t been in school at all DO have an headstart in the <br/>
realm of unschooling progress.<br/>
<br/>
Those whose kids have been in school will begin to make the same sort of <br/>
progress at some point AFTER the family sets aside all the school <br/>
expectations, schedules, terminology, resentments, confusions, training, <br/>
aversions, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Those who want unschooling to work as well as it can and who are willing to <br/>
get the school, its ghosts, and its invisible structure out of their homes <br/>
and away from their kids will understand unschooling better and live with <br/>
more interpersonal benefit than those who save SOME school stuff or who hope <br/>
for unschooling to operate over a faint school-grid which still exists in <br/>
their minds.<br/>
