<br/>
<br/>
I also knew another lady named Viginia, but she went by Ginny.. she was so <br/>
sweet, the name just fit her perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Girls names seem harder to choose than boys ( for me, that is)  We didn&#39;t <br/>
name Anna til right before we took her home from the hospital.  But, her name did <br/>
suit her well once we picked it.    I love the name Lydia... Anna says she is <br/>
going to name her daugher Lydia if she has one.   I also like the name Lanta, <br/>
that is my Grandmothers name, although, folks call her &quot;Lannie&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956250964">Lydia is a great name.  My friend&#39;s DD is Lydia and we had also <br/>
considered that name before our daughter was born.  DH and I had had a <br/>
boy name picked out for months and months, but couldn&#39;t agree on a girl <br/>
name that we both liked.  The night before I went into labor with my DD <br/>
&quot;Fiona&quot; stuck in my head.   I sprung it on DH while I was in labor and <br/>
he readily agreed.  LOL  He chose &quot;Jade&quot; as a middle name for her.<br/>
<br/>
I had a lot of fun with baby name generators online.  :)<br/>

browsing baby name websites. I found some where you could narrow the names down by <br/>
gender, country of origin, etc...so I typed in &quot;Irish girl&#39;s names&quot; Brenna was <br/>
one of those. Unfortunately, I have heard that it&#39;s becoming &quot;trendy&quot; and one <br/>
baby name book called it &quot;the updated version of Brianna&quot;<br/>
