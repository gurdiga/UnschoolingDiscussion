What a terrifying situation for you to be in!  This situation seems like<br/>
terrorism at its finest and I can&#39;t help but wonder whether the Al-quaida<br/>
etc.  might be a possibly involved.  Of course,  I suppose Al-quaida has<br/>
become the face of terrorism for us and perhaps that possibity cloaks other<br/>
terrorist types.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you and your family peace and courage.  I hope this mystery is soon<br/>
solved and this horror will be stopped<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s all real close to home for us. My sister was filling up her car with<br/>
 </span></blockquote>gas less than 10 minutes before the shooting of the cab driver at the Mobil<br/>
station in Aspen Hill. The shooting of the lady vaccuming out her car at the<br/>
Kensington Shell station was across the street from my sister&#39;s office, and<br/>
the lady who was shot on the bench in front of the Crisp and Juicy by<br/>
Leisure World was the cousin of a friend of ours.  The Crisp and Juicy is a<br/>
great Peruvian chicken place that we have gone to many times.  I go to the<br/>
Michael&#39;s Craft Store at Spotsylvania Mall (Fredericksburg) all the time and<br/>
was planning to go to a seminar at the Holiday Inn Hotel right across the<br/>
street the same Friday as the shooting, but opted to go to another event in<br/>
Richmond instead.  My Mom lives about 15 minutes away from the Bowie middle<br/>
school where the 13 year old boy was shot.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; On Wednesday night, my dh got bitten by a brown recluse spider at home and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>went up to our health care provider for treatment just a few minutes away<br/>
from the Sunoco station where the engineer was shot and killed. I was out at<br/>
a meeting so DH took the boys with him. They were all in the area near<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the shooting, but were never aware of what occured until they got home.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(DH&#39;s spider bite is doing fine too, btw.)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Our local county schools are on lock-down and there are sheriff deputies<br/>
&gt; patrolling the grounds during school hours.  No one is allowed to play<br/>
 </span></blockquote>outside and all outdoor activities are cancelled, as are field trips to<br/>
anywhere.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Even we homeschoolers are affected.  We had tickets to see the Lion King<br/>
 </span></blockquote>puppets at the Kennedy Center and that was cancelled. We haven&#39;t been<br/>
letting the kids play out in the front yard, though we do allow the back<br/>
yard since it is fenced and the children can&#39;t be seen from the street --<br/>
and they have to get fresh air somehow! I try not to be out alone anywhere,<br/>
even though that&#39;s my favorite way to get certain errands, like my weekly<br/>
shopping, done. No more.  I get gas at stations that are farther away from<br/>
the interstate.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The perp&#39;s first targets are in an area that I know like the back of my<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hand<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -- Rockville, Wheaton,  Aspen Hill, Kensington. I think the investigation<br/>
&gt; will find that the attacker(s) originated from that area.  The routes are<br/>
&gt; well-known to people who live in that area, but probably not known to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>outsiders. The perp has gone farther afield to prove that he&#39;s got a wider<br/>
range, but in each incident he&#39;s  been less than a mile from the<br/>
interstate -- Spotsylvania/Fredericksburg (I-95), Bowie (Rts. 50& 301,<br/>
Manassas (I-66).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The shooting just south of us on Friday really hit close to home as I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>drive the kind of vehicle (white Chevy AstroVan) that was being stopped in<br/>
the road blocks.  I haven&#39;t driven it much since, partially because we&#39;re<br/>
trying to minimize our trips to only essential errands and also because I<br/>
don&#39;t want the children to be upset when the police come up to our family<br/>
vehicle with their guns drawn.  When I do go out, I make sure my drivers<br/>
license and registration are on the dashboard before I leave the driveway.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s been pretty awful coping with the steady drip, drip, drip of stress<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and warily waiting, helpless, for the next shooting to occur.  We had a<br/>
break in the weekend, but last night, another shooting in Falls Church.<br/>
This time in a covered parking lot, with lots of concrete pillars and the<br/>
woman victim was with her husband. She was doing all the things that police<br/>
have been telling us to do to keep safe.  I hope the perp is caught soon so<br/>
we can get our lives back to normal again. I refuse to be paralysed with<br/>
fear, but I am a lot more cautious these days. The world keeps turning,<br/>
right?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for letting me vent here!  At times it is very hard to keep a calm<br/>
 </span></blockquote>veneer for the sake of the children, so they will feel safe and free.<br/>
