Well,  &quot;do more and be a better person&quot; implies that,  in your judgement,<br/>
the child/person is not enough just &quot;being&quot; who she or he is.  That is your<br/>
judgement....and seems to indicate that you DO think those traits are<br/>
&quot;negative&quot; ......but you you said earlier that you and your youngsters don&#39;t<br/>
have &#39;connotations&#39; connected to language used to define them.<br/>
Hmmmm......</div>
