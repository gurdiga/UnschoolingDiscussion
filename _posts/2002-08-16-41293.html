<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650694376">Hi,<br/>
Ren, I use to get really ticked about be lumped in with<br/>
other &quot;Christians&quot;.<br/>
I would say I was a Christ &quot;believer&quot; when needing to identify myself <br/>
religously.<br/>
One day I had a guy say.. <br/>
&quot;Why don&#39;t you call yourself a Christian?&quot;<br/>
I explained myself somewhat like you, Ren.<br/>
And he simply couldn&#39;t get over that since defined Christian= to be like <br/>
Christ.<br/>
I guess it is who you talk to and the labelings of Christian and what it <br/>
stands for..<br/>
Just like the word unschooler.<br/>
To those of you on this list you are open minded and have one view.<br/>
But when I talk to a fellow teacher and use that word unschooler, they are <br/>
often filled with disdain and unbelief as well as disgust.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts!<br/>
Bj<br/>
