<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750686993">Oh no! An escaped hamster. This hasn&#39;t happened to us yet and I hope it never does.<br/>
Hopefully Princess has just found a comfortable place to sleep (because it is daytime now) and later she will be enticed by the food set out for her and you will be able to catch her before the cats do.<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

  Emimly&#39;s hamster went missing this morning. The Wheel that attaches to the<br/>
  cave came off somehow and Princess got out. We&#39;ve search everywhere adn<br/>
  can&#39;t find her. There&#39;s no body parts anywhere so it appears that the cats<br/>
  didn&#39;t get her but there&#39;s no evidence of her hiding either. (poop) We put<br/>
  the cage back on teh floor withone hole open adn Emily will put some veggies<br/>
  around to entice but I&#39;m not too hopeful. The cats are in teh bedroom.<br/>
  Can hamsters climb stairs? My assumption is that she&#39;ll go DOWN but not up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608124914">No, but we&#39;ve read some of her other stories.  That is another connection<br/>
I offer to my kids - getting more books by an author that they have<br/>
enjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
dd grabbed a book at the library called Totally Personal & Private.  It<br/>
is about journaling and was written by a homeschooler (although I don&#39;t<br/>
know any details of her homeschooling).  It inspired her to start a<br/>
journal.  Then she wanted to read the journals by Amelia (written by<br/>
Marissa Moss).  In looking for those at the library we discovered that MM<br/>
has also written some historical fiction journals.  So we grabbed one of<br/>
those too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545960465">I&#39;ve had luck catching escaped hamsters by placing a bucket near the wall<br/>
with a little ramp leading up to it (ruler or some such, taped in place).<br/>
Put some food in the bucket. The theory is they go up the ramp, jump in<br/>
after the food, and can&#39;t get out. You can leave it out all night, which<br/>
beats the stick-string-box approach.<br/>

free for days at a time, he&#39;d play with our dopey cats and sleep by the<br/>
hot water heater. We could always find him there... maybe look for yours<br/>
there?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-678474497">Biggie Rat and Itchy Brother<br/>
<br/>
From a cartoon TV show of long ago.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.toonopedia.com/leonardo.htm">http://www.toonopedia.com/leonardo.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
The King Leonardo segment had four principal cast members. King Leonardo (a <br/>
lion) was the ruler of Bongo Congo, whose major export was bongo drums (very <br/>
popular at the time). Odie Cologne (a skunk) was Leonardo&#39;s faithful <br/>
assistant, and a good &quot;man&quot; to have around — he was probably the only <br/>
character on the show competent to run things. Itchy Brother was Leonardo&#39;s <br/>
brother, a flea-bitten dimbulb driven mainly by jealousy of Leonardo&#39;s <br/>
throne. Biggie Rat was a high-level criminal (you could tell by his Edward G. <br/>
Robinson accent) whose function was to plan and execute Itchy&#39;s coup <br/>
attempts. Jackson Beck (Brutus in the 1960s Popeye cartoons and Perry White <br/>
in The New Adventures of Superman) provided the voices of Leonardo and <br/>
Biggie, while Allen Swift (Terrytoons&#39; Clint Clobber, and miscellaneous <br/>
voices in The Tom & Jerry Show) voiced Odie and Itchy. <br/>
<br/>
King Leonardo was the first production of Total Television, which later <br/>
changed its name to Leonardo Productions. Under that name, it also produced <br/>
Tennessee Tuxedo and Underdog. Most of the actual animation was done in <br/>
Mexico by Gamma Productions, where The Jay Ward Studio also farmed out much <br/>
of its work. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re mentioned in an article about where Itchy and Scratchy (the <br/>
cartoon-within-a-cartoon on Simpsons) came from.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-384129166">Hi all!<br/>
I&#39;m just got back from FL and we had great time.<br/>
I was planning on visiting Sharon, but the drive was too long to add <br/>
even an hour to it.  18 hours.  Left at 5am and arrived here at <br/>
11:00pm.<br/>
I am planning on going down in May for the FL get together and <br/>
camping at Ft. Clinch though!<br/>
We had a good time at my parents, house sitting.  The West Palm Beach <br/>
library is awesome!  Great kids section with nice library ladies!<br/>
Well, one was a little rude, turning down the video Carly was <br/>
watching without a word to her.  But the kids section is downstairs <br/>
and had all kinds of cool stuff.  We stayed for a couple of hours, <br/>
and went twice.<br/>
We also did the Playmobile store(twice), which I highly recommend to <br/>
anyone that is near to one.  We climbed trees one day and went to the <br/>
beach another, and also found a great park and a mall with an inside <br/>
playspace that had huge fruit for kids to climb all over.<br/>
Just wanted to say I&#39;m back and glad to be reading here again.<br/>
Though the rat talk is totally creeping me out.  I was at my parents <br/>
trying to figure out how to sign on to their computer which is on the <br/>
other side of the house where we weren&#39;t going much(big house).  <br/>
Anyway, as I was sitting there, a rat(or a huge mouse) ran by.  I was <br/>
up on the chair, screaming my lungs out, before I knew what hit me.<br/>
I&#39;m not a rodent lover, with the exception of our rabbit(though if I <br/>
think about it too much, even he can creep me out while I&#39;m holding <br/>
him).  I don&#39;t know what it is that freaks me out, but they really do.<br/>
My son freaks out about those FL roaches, which don&#39;t bother me a bit.<br/>
