<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137748669">My husband has been teaching Sunday school for the months of November <br/>
and December, and I have been helping him research the different <br/>
December holidays. Since I had done all that work anyway, I decided <br/>
to put together a holiday page for Letter Lane--if you go to <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.letterlane.com">http://www.letterlane.com</a> at the bottom of the page is a link that <br/>
says &quot;H is for Happy Holidays&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Just passing this along for anyone who would like some multicultural <br/>
holiday resources.<br/>
