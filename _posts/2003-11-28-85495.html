Me neither!  But I offered to pay Jared $7 of the $11 I owed him a couple days ago. He said he&#39;d rather wait until I have it all. Talk about being shocked...I&#39;d never have done that. <br/>

Everything else is going great -- we&#39;re having a great time together, <br/>
learning and getting excited about everything from Scooby-Doo (him) to the <br/>
deer in <br/>
the backyard (me) and all kinds of other things (both of us).  Do I just need <br/>
to <br/>
give this more time, or am I missing a piece of the puzzle?  (Or both?  Or <br/>
neither? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
Thanks in advance-<br/>

When I was a child - and even NOW, sometimes - I experienced this frequently. <br/>
 I didn&#39;t know at that time that I had an anxiety disorder - I would just get <br/>
freaked out or angry or scared at the last minute and do anything to prevent <br/>
having to go to the event.  This happened with birthday parties, dances, get <br/>
togethers with relatives, etc, INCLUDING things I really wanted to attend <br/>
before it was time to actually go.  In high school I actually faked an injury to <br/>
avoid having to go to a school-sponsored father daughter event.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a solution for you - just wanted to mention my own history with <br/>
this, and to let you know that this may very well be something inside HIM that <br/>
has little to do with the way he&#39;s being schooled or parented.  I doubt I <br/>
would have been amenable to therapy as a child or teen, even when I began to <br/>
realize something wasn&#39;t right - but I imagine having parents who maybe knew where <br/>
this was coming from MIGHT have helped me.  <br/>
