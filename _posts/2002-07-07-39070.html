<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765151716">I need help here, folks, and this IS related to unschooling, but in a<br/>
different way.  Feel free to hit delete if I bore you (expect for you,<br/>
Sandra...you got me here, now you have to help me! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
As my understanding of how my son learns and how I learn develops, the<br/>
natural side-effect is to consider what I do professionally.  I teach<br/>
violin, and I&#39;ve been struggling with how I do that.  (I hate the &quot;I<br/>
teach...&quot; comment, too, and I&#39;m open to suggestions on other ways to say<br/>
that!  My business card could use a little help, too.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m coming to beleive that most students come to me expecting me to feed<br/>
knowledge into them, and then they become burned out when I do exactly that.<br/>
(And so do I!)  I was considering it this way: if my son wanted to learn<br/>
about dinosaurs, I&#39;d probably help him find a couple books on dinosaurs,<br/>
search for web sites, check out our nearby Natural History museum, buy some<br/>
model dinosaurs to mess around with, or whatever.  The LAST thing I&#39;d<br/>
consider doing would be calling someone whom I heard was an expert on<br/>
dinosaurs and sign him up for weekly &quot;dinosaur lessons&quot;, where he would<br/>
learn a little bit new each week and then be expected to come home and<br/>
repeat it over and over and then repeat it back to the expert the next week,<br/>
perfectly or at least greatly improved!<br/>
<br/>
And yet to some extent, this is what I do for a living.  Somewhere along the<br/>
line, somebody hears a violin, decides they want to learn to do that, and<br/>
calls me for violin lessons.  And so we begin working through the basics of<br/>
how you play, etc.  But here&#39;s my problem: they get bored.  It happens to<br/>
everyone, somewhere down the line.  (Including me, the teacher!  I get kudos<br/>
for my teaching, I&#39;m a good teacher.  But it&#39;s not thrilling me, either.)<br/>
Let&#39;s face it, put as above, I&#39;d be bored with dinosaurs in the first month.<br/>
If we played little games learning the information, had some laughs, etc., I<br/>
might survive for two months.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m realizing that somehow, I need my students to see me as a single<br/>
resource in their quest to learn violin.  That they also need to read,<br/>
listen, study, experiment, search the internet, etc.  They need to think<br/>
about why some things work and some things just don&#39;t work for them, and how<br/>
to fix their own problems.  But how do I get them beyond the &quot;teach me&quot;<br/>
mentality to learn themselves?  How do I give these people some direction,<br/>
without it becoming just more assignments that I give for the week, added<br/>
onto everything else.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s so much more to this all jumbled around in my poor little brain<br/>
tonight, but maybe this works as a start.  Thanks for the help!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been mentally writing an essay on the importance of experts, so this<br/>
is very timely for me. Up until this summer, Rain had mostly learned<br/>
things on her own, with my assistance as requested, and using resources<br/>
such as books, tv, computer software, etc. She&#39;d been on sports teams<br/>
with coaches, but that was all pretty loose, and the coaches did a lot<br/>
more organizing than teaching. And they weren&#39;t &quot;experts&quot;, just men and<br/>
women who knew a bit and were willing to get out there with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
This summer, Rain is taking private swimming lessons from an expert<br/>
swimmer. I was impressed by the way he sat down with her to start and<br/>
asked what she could do, and what she wanted to be able to do. Then he<br/>
watched her &quot;swim&quot; (basically mess around in the water) for a few<br/>
minutes, and then picked one small skill she was lacking (tucking her<br/>
chin) and told her what this would do for her, and why. They went on like<br/>
that, with him giving her small pieces, and her practicing those bits<br/>
until she felt she had them, and then him suggesting other pieces, or<br/>
combinations. I was really impressed, both by his expertise and ability<br/>
to break the skill down for her, and by his receptiveness to teaching her<br/>
the skills that would lead to what she wanted to learn. She may never<br/>
master the back float - it wasn&#39;t on her list, she feels fine with the<br/>
way she does it now and doesn&#39;t want further assistance - and that&#39;s<br/>
okay. She *can* swim better than she could before, and that&#39;s what she<br/>
wanted.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard of music teachers who start the same way, with inviting the<br/>
person wanting help to just play, or sing, and then taking it from there.<br/>
Rain has been learning a lot about singing this summer through a theater<br/>
workshop, and has expressed an interest in continuing with some sort of<br/>
lessons (mentorship?) after the workshop ends. I would look for someone<br/>
who would look at meeting her specific goals at that time, not at working<br/>
through a beginning singing book. Maybe the problem is the whole<br/>
teacher-student paradigm, maybe you could call yourself a &quot;violin<br/>
mentor&quot;, since that to me implies a resource to be used, instead of<br/>
someone who will be responsible for shoving knowledge into your head.<br/>

Holly was taking fiddle lessons from someone who<br/>
1) played since he was eight<br/>
2) switched to (or added to his knowledge) bluegrass and Irish three years <br/>
before that<br/>
and<br/>
3) is a homeschooling/unschooling-maybe dad of a four/five year old boy.<br/>
<br/>
So the teacher was interested in experimenting with looser methods and <br/>
teaching by ear.  He was willing to go with Holly&#39;s personal quirks, if he <br/>
found any.  <br/>
<br/>
She went ten times or so, had three songs mostly learned, liked his tire <br/>
swing better than the lessons, and after a while didn&#39;t want to go.<br/>
<br/>
Last month she said she wanted to start again, but his bluegrass band is <br/>
getting more work AND he has more students (and he&#39;s a full time engineer or <br/>
something), so her spot was gone, but he recommended someone else who<br/>
1) teaches suzuki or something akin to it<br/>
2) has (in fall starting again) a group that is all-but-one homeschoolers, so <br/>
they have a private lesson and the  come to the group thing each week too<br/>
3) is doing fiddling too<br/>
AND<br/>
4) is concert master for the Musical Theatre of the Southwest.<br/>
<br/>
And she and Holly hit it off well.  Holly&#39;s been three times and is going <br/>
again tomorrow.  The approach is really structured (the teacher is reading <br/>
off a list sometimes, and always checking back with her checklist, so it&#39;s <br/>
someone else&#39;s &quot;curriculum&quot;), but it&#39;s fun and funny and Holly&#39;s into it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;   But how do I get them beyond the &quot;teach me&quot;<br/>
mentality to learn themselves?  How do I give these people some direction,<br/>
without it becoming just more assignments that I give for the week, added<br/>
onto everything else. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could say you&#39;re the coach, and they need to do there <br/>
violin-related things each week besides playing it some (don&#39;t say <br/>
&quot;practicing,&quot; say &quot;play your violin during the week,&quot; and then it won&#39;t be <br/>
homework, it will be the coach reminding them to DO).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve taken piano lessons from three different teachers  (pre-school for a <br/>
year, and then jr high/high school two teachers), was in band in school, had <br/>
two chorus teachers I liked lots, made all-state, took recorder lessons <br/>
(after I had learned to play it, took serious Baroque-coaching and <br/>
Renaissance ensemble university-music lessons with Floyd Williams, who&#39;s in <br/>
Australia now, or was last I knew).  So the music lessons have been all kinds <br/>
of different, but the LEARNING has been almost always me myself.  What the <br/>
best of those teachers did was coach me, and tweak what I was doing.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could ask them to find music (live or recorded, video, or old <br/>
records) each week, and maybe art or history, and in all that exploration <br/>
they&#39;ll learn lots of trivia and connections that might inspire them to ask <br/>
you questions you could answer.<br/>
<br/>
At Holly&#39;s last lesson they were doing copying phrases.   Holly would copy <br/>
three or four notes, with different (I don&#39;t know the violin terminology) <br/>
bowing techniques--stacatto, legato (smooth and something).<br/>
<br/>
With her old teacher she used to share a lesson with another homeschooler <br/>
sometimes, and that girl was making up songs.  So the girl would play a <br/>
phrase and the teacher would copy it.  THAT was a thrill for the <br/>
composing-kid.<br/>

violin.  They&#39;ve talked some on the list about their conflicts between <br/>
their unschooling principals and their violin teaching methods.  They also <br/>
talk about it a lot between themselves.  If you&#39;re interested, I could ask <br/>
them if it&#39;s all right to send you their addys.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s great that you are pondering this, and I&#39;ll hope you share more as<br/>
your ideas form.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading stuff about &quot;education reform&quot;, especially past<br/>
efforts.  I was really struck by the assumption that a human teacher<br/>
could be replaced by some kind of technology (e.g., filmstrips, or a<br/>
computer) doing programmed instruction, and that nothing would be lost,<br/>
there would just be amazing gains in productivity. As if only the words<br/>
that the teacher speaks are important -- the tone of voice and facial<br/>
expressions, everything that&#39;s part of a human connection is assumed to<br/>
be dispensible.  That seems wrong to me.<br/>
<br/>
I was also reading some stuff about language acquisition, and whether<br/>
younger kids have an advantage in second language acquisition.  My<br/>
personal theory is that babies do so well with language acquisition<br/>
because they are with their mothers.  I think a child in daycare or with<br/>
a non-native-speaker nanny might be at a disadvantage for language<br/>
acquisition.  I did notice that when my son was first taking off in<br/>
reading to himself he would come over to the couch and lean against me<br/>
to have the same contact that was familiar from when I had read to him.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the value of affection in learning as been underestimated.<br/>

I can&#39;t teach big huge theater-style classes where students are too far for <br/>
me to look into their eyes. I have to have students sitting so that I can see <br/>
their faces. If I don&#39;t - I just start to stumble and fumble and can&#39;t <br/>
explain myself well and my lectures become PAINFULLY stilted and boring. When <br/>
I have eye contact, I&#39;m very very sensitive to my students - sensing that <br/>
this one is not quite understanding, not trying, trying really hard, getting <br/>
overwhelmed, not getting enough information, wanting more, wanting less, etc. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Music lessons to me seem a lot like math lessons. A lot of the learning<br/>
(teaching! ;-) is out of context, e.g., how to do two digit addition and how<br/>
to play a G, or in artificial contexts, e.g., made up word problems and<br/>
beginner songs that weren&#39;t the ones that inspired kids to want to play the<br/>
violin.<br/>
<br/>
Of course most kids don&#39;t stumble over violin playing throughout their daily<br/>
life as they do math! They can&#39;t watch mom playing, she can&#39;t show them<br/>
something interesting she found.<br/>
<br/>
But perhaps you could incorporate some of that. Find out what it was that<br/>
they heard that drew them to the violin, or the kinds of things that kids<br/>
find cool until they get used to listening for themselves. Maybe they could<br/>
bring in recordings/music of things they like and mess around with it so<br/>
that learning how to hold the bow isn&#39;t the point of the lesson. It&#39;s a<br/>
skill that gets picked while working towards something they want. Learning<br/>
how to add is a side-effect of wanting to know how much money they have or<br/>
how long until daddy gets home or who won the game.<br/>
<br/>
It might help if you projected the attitude of a mentor. *Assume* they will<br/>
becoming to you as a mentor rather than assuming they want to be fed. You<br/>
might need to feed them some nifty things that other kids have enjoyed<br/>
trying to do to get the ball rolling but I bet once they get the idea, that<br/>
many will figure it out. Some might not. And they might feel more<br/>
comfortable with a different teacher. Which should be perfectly fine! Not<br/>
all kids learn the same way.<br/>
