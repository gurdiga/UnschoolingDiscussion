<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002303542">i have only been homeschooling for about 3 months, and i have never once <br/>
heard of anyone who doesn&#39;t expect some things from their child! as far as <br/>
health concerns, i have been diabetic for 24 years. i know for certain no one <br/>
lets their child take total responsibilty for such a serious condition( i <br/>
don&#39;t like to refer to it as an illness, diease, etc.). that would be a <br/>
deadly choice to make! however helping the child to comes to terms with his <br/>
condition, and could also be incorperated into a science and health lesson <br/>
while helping to child take control, which is very important for him to get <br/>
along happy and healthy in this world. you can find kids that are unschooled <br/>
or homeschooled whichever you prefer learning lots from the world around us <br/>
as well as in their own bodies.i&#39;m not trying to be preachy but i think more <br/>
info. should be gathered before making an assumption such as this one.<br/>
