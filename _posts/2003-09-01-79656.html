&gt; that way with my boys but was raised to &quot;finish what you start&quot; so I guess I <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My husband is constantly saying to me &quot;When are you going to finish <br/>
the floor?&quot;  We tore out all our carpets and are putting down <br/>
laminate flooring, that kind that snaps together. The living room is <br/>
done, and the hallway is all that is left.  I told my husband from <br/>
the beginning I wanted to do it myself, at my own pace, and all by <br/>
myself.  So that means I work on it until I feel I need to stop.  He <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do that, he would work until it was completely done.  He has <br/>
offered to help, but I told him that I want to be able to say that I <br/>
did it.  If he helps, then I don&#39;t get the pride of feeling that I <br/>
accomplished it alone.  <br/>
<br/>
So, there are some days I can&#39;t work on it because you can&#39;t lay it <br/>
when the humidity is over 70%, and I haven&#39;t worked on it lately <br/>
because it is over 100 degrees outside and to get out and saw on <br/>
those boards is just excruciating.  And then, I have to be in the <br/>
mood, so there are a lot of variables in play.  But it irritates him <br/>
that I have waited so long to finish the hallway.  A couple of days <br/>
ago, I cut the last four boards that we have, and started on the <br/>
hallways, getting it about 1/3 done.  Now I have to wait until we <br/>
have money to buy some more boards.  But I know he is constantly <br/>
thinking to himself, why doesn&#39;t she just get it over with?<br/>

recently.  A mom was debating whether to enroll her little girl (3 1/2) in<br/>
pee wee soccer.  (no scoring, everyone plays that sort of thing)<br/>
<br/>
I replied (and I thought it was logical)  &quot;I think as long as you&#39;re willing<br/>
to let her drop it at any time - if she&#39;s not having fun or whatever - then<br/>
why not?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To my SHOCK and almost horror the mom replied (and a LOT of other moms<br/>
agreed with her)    &quot;unfortunately in my house if you commit to it you<br/>
finish it. Michael wanted out of soccer and Meg wanted out of dance classes.<br/>
Neither is allow to &quot;drop&quot; until the classes/season ends. My parents lived<br/>
and died by this rule and I guess it rubbed off on me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry but to force your child to do something &#39;just to complete&#39; it<br/>
rubs me the wrong way.  I know as a child my interests changed a lot.    My<br/>
parents at one point took to reminding me of all of the things I had started<br/>
and dropped to the point where I just stopped trying new things.<br/>
<br/>
I loved Elizabeth&#39;s post about all of the different things she&#39;s tried (book<br/>
binding, canning, weaving etc).  I just bought a quilting kit (fabric<br/>
included) - hopefully I&#39;m going to bite the bullet and follow through - I&#39;d<br/>
love to learn to quilt.<br/>
<br/>
Life is can be full of fun experiences or full of &#39;follow through no matter<br/>
what&#39;  which life would you prefer to live?<br/>

everything.  I have an unfinished quilt on the frame at this moment.  Waiting <br/>
patiently.  Many crocheting projects, the garden needs work, poems and stories in <br/>
the middle of completion.  I flip flop in my interests.  Usually get back to <br/>
them at some point and sometimes not.  I try things out and find I don&#39;t like <br/>
them enough to continue.  I guess I am lucky because my husband&#39;s motto is &quot;as <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067427609">This was the topic in our home today. We/HE are also laying the flooring but <br/>
it is my husband who has not finished. One room left and trim to be put back <br/>
on. I am wanting him to finish so we can avoid dog hair underneath/in the <br/>
corners. PLUS, I told him today I was beginning to panic a bit about where the baby <br/>
is going to room when he/she is born. His answer I dont know? He&#39;s not a big <br/>
verbal thinker. It all happens in his head. I have to say he has always worked <br/>
it out.<br/>
I would finish the floor but we bought discontinued flooring and has enough <br/>

etc.) at this site <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bygpub.com/natural/family-bed.htm">http://www.bygpub.com/natural/family-bed.htm</a> but<br/>
you&#39;re already an ol&#39; pro!  ;)  At our house my nursling is still in<br/>
the bed with us and our 4yo is in his twin bed that is nestled between<br/>
our bed and the corner of our room.  It&#39;s a great arrangement for us<br/>
since my older one wants to hold my hand while he falls asleep and the<br/>
little one wants to nurse to sleep.  :)  HTH<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058626731">Sounds like you are already following the basic principle which is allowing your babies and/or children if they still want to, to sleep with you.  Gillen and Jesse were both only in our bed until about 2 1/2.  We never got a crib.  Now they are happily in a bunk bed in their own room.  Sometimes the younger one calls in the night and one of us will go sleep with him (his bottom bunk is a double bed).  It works out great.  I highly recommend the double bed as a transition so they can stay in their room as they get bigger and yet still get visited by a parent and read to easily before sleep.  &#39;Course, they could always stay in your bed longer too.  This just worked better for all of us.<br/>
 <br/>
The best book I read about it is called, The Family Bed   It is only published in the U.K.   I don&#39;t remember the author (I lent it out) but it would be worth looking up at amazon u.k. if someone were new to this.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my boys were small, they always knew they were welcome in our <br/>
bed any time.  They had their own beds available which they could <br/>
sleep in at any time, but they were rarely slept in.  Sometimes they <br/>
started out the night sleeping with us to begin with.  Sometimes we <br/>
would lie down beside them in their beds until they went to sleep, <br/>
then get up and go to our own beds.  They would often sleep about <br/>
half the night alone, then get up and come to our beds when they <br/>
realized they were alone.  They were always received with open arms.  <br/>
Sometimes they would sleep in the bed with us, sometimes in a <br/>
sleeping bag on the floor.  Sometimes one of us adults would sleep in <br/>
the kids bed so both of them could sleep with the other parent in our <br/>
bed.  Sometimes my husband would sleep on the couch, and the kids and <br/>
I in our bed.  Sometimes we&#39;d make a pallet on the floor and <br/>
everybody or some people would sleep there.  It was musical beds <br/>
every night.  Wherever and whenever anybody decided to sleep, they <br/>
did.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest son slept with us until he was almost 12.  Sometimes he&#39;d <br/>
sleep part of the night alone, and part with us.  All of a sudden, <br/>
right before puberty, he suddenly became very independent and needed <br/>
his &quot;space&quot; and privacy. Some kids may go to their own beds totally <br/>
by 3 or 4 years of age, I don&#39;t think it matters when they go.  They <br/>
will develop their own independence in the course of discovering <br/>
themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
I loved our time in the family bed, and I feel strongly that the <br/>
closeness that we developed there is why my kids and I have such a <br/>
good relationship.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Could those of you who have a family bed, or don&#39;t/didn&#39;t use a crib <br/>
<br/>
explain a little? We had a crib, but the kids generally ended up in bed <br/>
<br/>
with us until they were older.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We had a queensize for mom/dad.   At first we used a crib, but it was way <br/>
more work and coldness than we wanted.  In short time, it was only used for <br/>
daytime naps, and not all of those.  <br/>
<br/>
We got another bed, a double/fullsize, and I slept with Kirby there until he <br/>
fell asleep, and visited Keith some nights, and sometimes stayed in there <br/>
until I woke up to Kirby being awake right next door, and would switch beds.  It <br/>
was easier for me to switch beds than to get up and sit up in a chair and stay <br/>
awake until Kirby was asleep and then risk a transfer.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody slept better when I was switching beds.   If we had had a bigger <br/>
bedroom and my  husband didn&#39;t have a bad lower back, my preference would have <br/>
been to have both those beds next to each other or mattresses on the floor <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  For a while we had a bassinet next to the bed, and would move the teensy <br/>
kirby in there sometimes, or out of there sometimes, into the bed.<br/>
<br/>
By the time Marty came, he and Kirby and I shared that kid-room bed lots, <br/>
with a net-and-tube side rail so nobody fell out, and I slept between them.<br/>
<br/>
Keith has always gone to work early since kids were born, like 6:00, so it <br/>
was better for me not to be in there at that hour when he was leaving, and since <br/>
kids were nursing it was better for him to sleep where he wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
awakened a bunch.<br/>
<br/>
Some of my friends were doing an every-other-waking thing with their husbands <br/>
where they told him he HAD to get up and get the baby every other time, or <br/>
that they would nurse the baby to sleep each time IF their husbands went and <br/>
brought him/her.<br/>
<br/>
Three couples I&#39;m thinking of did something along those lines, and the <br/>
husbands agreed, and the wives rested better than the husbands.<br/>
<br/>
All three of those couples are divorced.  I still know them all (one dad I&#39;ve <br/>
lost contact with) and all their kids, still, and their subsequent re-ups if <br/>
any.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still with Keith, and now we sleep in the same bed every night and I can <br/>
sleep through his going to work if I want to or am really tired, or can wake <br/>
up and talk to him and then go back to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
None of those other couples have that option.<br/>
<br/>
Sometime before Holly came or about that time, we got a bunkbed with a single <br/>
on the top and double on the bottom and Kirby moved up to the top.<br/>
<br/>
That was not ideal.  In retrospect, I wish we could have gone to bigger floor <br/>
space and been all together.  That old house had no room with floorspace <br/>
enough for two mattresses.  Our new house has two rooms which would be big eough <br/>
for five people in one room.  But it&#39;s too late now.<br/>
<br/>
At last Kirby was in the same room with us, but he did feel shut out of the <br/>
sleeping with mom opportunity and I&#39;m sorry about that.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of times one of the kids has slept with Keith, especially Holly.   And <br/>
after we moved to the bigger house, for the first couple of years I was worried <br/>
if morning came and we hadn&#39;t picked up Marty or Holly in the night.<br/>
<br/>
Now they only show up if they&#39;re scared or have bad dreams.  Looking back at <br/>
my own childhood, I&#39;m really happy to see how few times they&#39;re scared.  I was <br/>
scared a lot and my parents never once let me come in with them.  They always <br/>
just made me go back to bed again, alone, in the same scary room.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry I didn&#39;t explain at all in my last post.  When I was pregnant with the <br/>
our first we were in Germany in a two bedroom housing area.  My parents were <br/>
coming to visit and staying through the delivery and for a couple of weeks <br/>
after.  So they were staying in what would have been the &quot;baby&#39;s room.&quot;  We bought <br/>
a small bassinet with the intention of getting a crib when they left.  Dallen <br/>
cried when he was born and didn&#39;t stop for about 4 months.  At least it <br/>
seemed like that.  The first night he cried so much that I didn&#39;t think I was going <br/>
to get any sleep so I brought him to bed with us and he seemed to settle <br/>
enough to nurse and sleep on and off and I slept.  <br/>
<br/>
After that night I had a talk with Jackson to see what he thought.  And I <br/>
read a couple of books, Family Bed and Continuum Concept.  Glad I chose those <br/>
books.  We decided that it didn&#39;t feel right to let him cry.  I just couldn&#39;t do <br/>
it.  I felt like he was calling me and I needed to be there.  So we abandoned <br/>
the idea of getting a crib and we gave the bassinet away.  That was the <br/>
beginning and we have been sleeping together from that day on.  <br/>
<br/>
Never, when I was growing up, did I even know there was such a thing as a <br/>
family bed.  But it seemed right and we all slept.  I was glad to have read those <br/>
books though because it helped me feel like I wasn&#39;t a freak or something. <br/>

for heaven&#39;s sake why doesn&#39;t he just sleep with us?&quot; Good for him. Now my <br/>
almost 8 year old sleeps in his bed, but in our room. My 2 yr old sleeps in the <br/>

There is a good issue of Mothering Magazine that was completely on <br/>
co-sleeping, it may be available online.<br/>

ourselves , well, we have a big house with lots of space<br/>

**************************************************<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you are already using the family bed. Sadly, we kind of fell <br/>
into it, much like we fell into parenting. Moly was six weeks early and when <br/>
she came home she had to wear a belt of fiber optic lights to help her normalize <br/>
her bilirubin levels (she had a severe case of jaundice) she had to wear it <br/>
all the time, it was wrapped around her and fastened with Velcro. Then we had <br/>
to cocoon wrap her with blankets. (She glowed neon blue! We called her our glow <br/>
worm.) The doctors at the hospital kept telling me that I would probably have <br/>
to stop nursing her and I refused, so I kept her wrapped up in those lights <br/>
24-7. The thick cord that attached the belt to the machine which ran it was <br/>
awkward and short. We had an antique cradle that I kept by our bed and she slept <br/>
in with the lights and the warm, humming machine under it, for the first two <br/>
weeks she was home. I kept her in her crib at all times except for when I <br/>
nursed her or changed her, I was so afraid. I was barely 20 years old, my pregnancy <br/>
had been very difficult, Darin and I had been married barely 9 months when <br/>
she was born, the doctors scared me, telling me my milk was one of the things <br/>
keeping her levels high... All sorts of factors went into how I cared for her <br/>
those first few weeks. <br/>
<br/>
When the lights went back to the hospital she started waking up more at night <br/>
and I couldn&#39;t figure out why. She had been a good sleeper right from the <br/>
start. Finally I realized that she had been lulled to sleep by the gentle hum of <br/>
the machine, the warmth and glow of the lights. So I began to keep her next to <br/>
me at night. It was easier, she nursed at will and I got to sleep. So you <br/>
could say that my desperate need for sleep, combined with absolutely no idea how <br/>
to care for an infant threw us into a family bed. Darin loved it! He loves how <br/>
babies smell, how warm they are, the soft, pretty noises they make. He would <br/>
put her on a pillow lengthwise beside him. He was so afraid he would roll over <br/>
on her! He would wrap an arm around the pillow and make this little nest for <br/>
her. I would just sigh gratefully and go to sleep until he nudged me awake to <br/>
feed her, and then she would be at my side the rest of the night. I gradually <br/>
got over my exhaustion and grew to love having her in bed with us too. She <br/>
never really left and when Jack came along we kept on with what was working. <br/>
<br/>
They still at nine, almost ten, and seven, get into bed with us. Most nights <br/>
the kids put a movie on in our bedroom and fall asleep in our bed, then Darin <br/>
and I snuggle with them for a while and put them into their own beds or we <br/>
take turns sleeping on the couch and let the kids stay in our bed with one of us. <br/>
On nights that they don&#39;t start out in our bed, for certain reasons &lt;g&gt; by <br/>
three or four in the morning, they are back in bed with us. I love having them <br/>
there, I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. I wish that things had been different <br/>
with Moly though. <br/>
<br/>
I envy those of you who read all the books, knew what you wanted, had your <br/>
children later... Not that I regret ever having my kids, I just wish I had been <br/>
older, more mature, more prepared. I did choose to nurse, but only because my <br/>
own mother nursed me and my siblings. It was a *my mom did it this way, so <br/>
will I* decision, not a well thought out, conscious decision. I didn&#39;t actively <br/>
decide to nurse my kids for longer than a year until Moly was almost a year old <br/>
and I finally read a book on the subject. Up to that point I thought I would <br/>
wean her when she was around a year old, end of subject. So many things in our <br/>
life have been done more out of impulse-right-for-this-moment-in-time than wel<br/>
l thought out decisions, and that is the part I wish was different. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800387397">Could those of you who have a family bed, or don&#39;t/didn&#39;t use a crib <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; explain a little?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*************************************************<br/>
We used our crib money to buy a breast pump after my daughter was born and I <br/>
had to go back to work at 6 weeks (great experience actually, DH & I worked <br/>
opposite shifts to be home with her)<br/>
Family bed was originally my husband&#39;s demand.  He slept with his mom and <br/>
loved the experience.  Three of us fit fine in a queen sized bed (no bedframe).  <br/>
When we became 4, we wedged a toddlerbed along side so we could *roll one out* <br/>
&lt;g&gt; when it got crowded.  DH and both kids were the snugglers and I happily <br/>
slept alone in my 1/4 bed &lt;g&gt;.  It was the easiest thing in the world with <br/>
nursing, one quickly becomes adept at *hookin&#39; em up while snoozin&quot;.  <br/>
Now that Mitch has died, of course I am so incredibly grateful they got to <br/>
have this wonderful, intimate experience with their dad (and as a two parent <br/>
family), and also that they still come snuggle in *our* bed and we relive the <br/>
*feeling* even though they may not have the actual *memories.* It gives a <br/>
wonderful sense of *all is right in the world* when we&#39;re all sleepy and snuggled <br/>
up... all are safe and loved.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-221574401">*** Now they only show up if they&#39;re scared or have bad dreams.  Looking<br/>
back at<br/>
 my own childhood, I&#39;m really happy to see how few times they&#39;re scared.  I<br/>
was<br/>
 scared a lot and my parents never once let me come in with them.  They<br/>
always<br/>
 just made me go back to bed again, alone, in the same scary room.***<br/>
<br/>
It just dawned on me, a short while ago, that my kids are very rarely scared<br/>
of anything. At almost-4 and almost-6, they have never had nightmares, they<br/>
aren&#39;t afraid of big dogs, spiders, thunder or<br/>
things-that-go-bump-in-the-night. Occasionally, they will say that a certain<br/>
part of a movie scares them, and they will either not watch that part, or<br/>
come sit in my lap (if they&#39;re not already there) to make it through the<br/>
scary part (although I think I&#39;m more afraid of the Green Goblin than either<br/>
of my kids &lt;g&gt;). This is one tangible gift that I can see I&#39;ve given them.<br/>
On the days when I think I&#39;m a lousy mom, that I don&#39;t have a clue what I&#39;m<br/>
doing, that all those dire predictions of my relatives will come to pass, I<br/>
can take some satisfaction in knowing that my kids have never experienced<br/>
the horrible night terrors and nightmares that I lived through, or laid<br/>
awake in bed half the night scared to breath, knowing that they weren&#39;t<br/>
welcome in mom and dad&#39;s bed (sleeping with my parents was *definitely* out<br/>
of the question!) Oh, and of course my mom believed in &quot;letting me scream it<br/>
out&quot; rather than picking me up (I know this as she was totally horrified<br/>
that I hardly ever put my babies down and never let them cry themselves to<br/>
sleep). By the time she finally figured out we let the kids sleep in our<br/>
bed, she must have assumed we were &quot;too far gone&quot; to be put right, as she<br/>
didn&#39;t give me a battle about that one &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
(Just wanted to reassure anyone who is cosleeping and whose child is still<br/>
fearful.)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter at 12 still sleeps next to our bed and gets the heebie jeebies<br/>
about going upstairs or downstairs alone. Always has. (I remember getting a<br/>
creepy feeling going into the basement like something was going to jump on<br/>
me so I understand what she feels. I had no environmental reason to feel<br/>
that way. It was a finished basement so wasn&#39;t creepy. I didn&#39;t have bratty<br/>
siblings who thought it was fun to jump out at me. The feeling was still<br/>
there in college but disappeared sometime after that.)<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s nervous about thunderstorms and some things she can&#39;t control like<br/>
when her father&#39;s late getting home.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t have nightmares and I&#39;d suspect sleeping with us prevent the<br/>
ones that sleeping unwilling alone can cause. But some kids are born<br/>
sensitive to some situations.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I so agree with this!  Mark used to get up when Nathan cried at night to <br/>
bring him to nurse.  He was the first to hear the poor baby.  I would roll over, <br/>
Nathan would latch on and then we&#39;d all fall asleep again.  It wasn&#39;t long <br/>
before we decided to skip the first step and just let Nathan fall asleep with us.  <br/>
When Julia came along, Nathan was only just a year old, so we all slept <br/>
together for a while.  The kids gradually moved to their own beds, or started there <br/>
and came back in the night.  Nathan, now five, regularly gets up in the night <br/>
and sleeps on his mat by our bed.  He&#39;s decided to sleep there because <br/>
&quot;Lovey&quot;, the baby due in January, is taking too much room and I need lots of <br/>
pillows.  Julia rarely wakes up at night.  Mark falls asleep with her first and then <br/>
comes to our bed.  It works out great.  Our crib has been used mostly for <br/>
napping.  I guess we&#39;ll bring it up from the basement for the new baby.<br/>

Some kids ARE more sensitive, but even tough kids with no genetic <br/>

in a hole, in a cave, alone for eight or ten hours, EVER.<br/>
<br/>
I still &quot;need&quot; to sleep covered up to the neck to be safe to go to sleep.  I <br/>
can&#39;t fall asleep with any part of me except my head uncovered.  I have to <br/>
close the closet door.  I&#39;m not &quot;afraid&quot; of anything, but I developed my own <br/>

<br/>
Last night I slept with Holly.  She&#39;s in an upstairs room, there&#39;s a <br/>
streetlight across the cul-de-sac, and a tree was moving, a little, and it made a <br/>
really pretty pattern on her wall.   I said &quot;Your tree shadow is really pretty.&quot;   <br/>
She talked about liking to trace shadows, and that when she was little she <br/>
used to sit behind the shed and trace the pattern of the shadow of the top of <br/>
the clipboard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180104283">I, too, have to be completely covered to my neck to be able to sleep, even on the hottest GA nights!  I thought it was due to having watched a really scary movie called &quot;Child&#39;s Play&quot; when I was a child (it was an adult movie that I went to w/ my mother and her boyfriend).   But thinking about it now, if I had been allowed to go to her room when I was scared at night, the fear of someone shooting a noose at me from the door (this happened in the movie) would have probably disappeared.  Everything scared me at night, alone in bed.  Every scream of a cat or a human from the Boston allys, every growl of the radiator, the shadows on the ceiling and walls...  I am so glad that my children won&#39;t have to experience this terror.   Or if they ever do, we will be right there for them.  Some of our best conversations have happened in the dark in bed, or in a car in the dark, driving home.  The dark doesn&#39;t frighten them, which is amazing to me.<br/>
