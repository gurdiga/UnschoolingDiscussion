<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905074706">Marty spilled a little Dr Pepper on the kitchen floor, and called the  dog.<br/>
I balked and said &quot;You&#39;re going to try to get the dog to drink Dr  Pepper!?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Yeah.  I&#39;ll see if it works.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
She licked  it up happily.  I was clearly offended, and  was making the &quot;poor <br/>
dog&quot; faces and noises, I guess, and Marty said  &quot;What!?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t think people should give dogs Dr Pepper.  They would never  drink it <br/>
in the wild.  Wolves don&#39;t drink Dr Pepper.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Marty said, &quot;Okay, Mom.  I&#39;m going to stop giving her dog food,  because she <br/>
would never kill that in the wild.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Yeah, well...<br/>
He&#39;s right. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
