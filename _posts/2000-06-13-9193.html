I simply cannot get into Pratchett. But he is my current hero. I have 4 sons<br/>
aged 19, 16, 13, 10. Sons19, 16 & 10 are big time Pratchett fans. Son13 only<br/>
learnt to read a few months before he turned 12 and has continued to really<br/>
dislike reading, and found it hard going. Last night I found him - with VERY<br/>
muddy feet - curled up in our waterbed with a Terry<br/>
Pratchett book. This morning he spent another hour reading the book. I am so<br/>
rapt!<br/>
