&lt;&lt; Ugh, another muggy day in the east coast, I miss that dry weather in NM <br/>
Sandra, I feel like we live in a jungle!  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Brenda was surprised that it rained hard enough at the airport to delay her <br/>
flight&#39;s departure, but it didn&#39;t rain at my house.   Crazy desert!<br/>

I also said the first day we were out and about that she and Tim should stand <br/>
in the shade instead of the sun.  I think she thought I was just being pushy <br/>
and controlling.  I remind people all the time to stand in the shade if they <br/>
can just take a step or two and be in shade instead of sun.  (Not in the <br/>
winter.  Then sun&#39;s GREAT!)   <br/>
<br/>
By the end of the week she was standing in the shade voluntarily.   <br/>

I wish everyplace could have at least one day a week of our high-altitude <br/>
SUNSHINE and that we could have at least one day a week of their casual wetness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051605094">Ah I know, the grass is always greener. My ten year old travelled to twenty six states last year (talk about a learning opportunity!) She drove with us to Florida and drove with my mom and dad to NM to see our family. She couldn&#39;t believe the different climates. She had to plan and pack for all different weather scenarios. This is really my dh and my dream for our family, to get his musical career going enough to just be travelling a lot. The kids love it and it really is SO eye opening to see the different cultures and climates ect. I still love NM more though, it&#39;s where my family is:) Kelli<br/>
