<div id="ygrps-yiv-27839546">Just wanted to send a thank you to you from my husband. I have printed things from this list lately for him to read in regard to Sierra and what has been going on. He has also &quot;found you&quot; on his own searches during the day at work when he&#39;s looking up things about unschooling. He liked you right away when he first discovered you and saw you recommend Ferris Buellers Day Off for a movie! Anyway, he told me tell you thanks, that he likes you, of course followed by him not liking many people. That&#39;s true!<br/>
<br/>
And thank you to all of you who have suggested things to help. I printed them all up and Joe and I have gone over them. They make sense to us and we are trying to see this in a whole different light. <br/>
<br/>
Mary B and Joe<br/>

<br/>
Cool!  Thanks for letting me know. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really hope things get sweet for you guys.  It has amazed me seeing how <br/>
just a one degree change in direction, changes the destination down the line, <br/>
and further away the longer the time spent going that direction, but when <br/>
someone can just stop and say &quot;Wait, I see where this goes and I don&#39;t want <br/>
to go there&quot; and makes a 90 degree turn, life is never the same!!<br/>
