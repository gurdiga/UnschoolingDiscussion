&gt; or not. Sometimes just seeing a different time period portrayed leads to <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most of what my kids have learned of history has been through movies and <br/>
books that were NOT intended to teach them about history. It created, over <br/>
time, a really good outline of background concepts and the big picture.<br/>
<br/>
A &quot;model&quot; of learning that I have in my head is based on puzzles. You know <br/>
how younger kids&#39; puzzles have that cardboard behind them that has an outline <br/>
of the shapes of the pieces so that the kids can more easily fit the pieces <br/>
together - they can look at the whole &quot;design&quot; of how the pieces will fit <br/>
together, while they are trying to fit the pieces to each other, too. That is <br/>
much easier than jigsaw puzzles - lots of small pieces without a backing that <br/>
has outlines to use as a guide.<br/>
<br/>
Schools teach in a pure jigsaw method - and, what&#39;s more, they only give you <br/>
some of the pieces at a time - if you are lucky maybe 30 pieces from some <br/>
little section of a thousand-piece puzzle so at least they fit together with <br/>
each other even if they don&#39;t show the whole picture, but more often they <br/>
give you 30 isolated pieces taken from all over the whole puzzle - pieces <br/>
that don&#39;t even FIT together with each other because there are too many <br/>
missing ones. You&#39;re supposed to study those pieces, memorize their shapes <br/>
and other attributes, so that someday in the future you can fit them together <br/>
with other pieces you studied, also in isolation, in different school years.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh - and they NEVER EVER let you see the top of the puzzle box so you can <br/>
actually SEE the picture of what you&#39;re trying to &quot;puzzle out.&quot; In fact, this <br/>
is like a double-blind experiment - most of the people (teachers) giving you <br/>
their pieces don&#39;t even know what the whole thing looks like - they long ago <br/>
settled for only ever dealing with small pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is different. Unschooling is like those puzzles with that <br/>
background outline -- kids build those outlines themselves, slowly over time, <br/>
for many many puzzles. They build them by having TIME (since they aren&#39;t busy <br/>
studying the attributes of a few isolated pieces) to learn all kinds of <br/>
things, without any pressure. As they play and learn they build up background <br/>
concepts and skills and then, when the background is well established (all <br/>
the outlines are drawn), they will either suddenly get really focused on <br/>
something and intensely put together all the puzzle pieces or they will <br/>
slowly, over years, keep adding pieces to create a particular puzzle. And at <br/>
that point it is WAY easier - plus they get the advantage that the big <br/>
picture isn&#39;t being withheld from them - they can look at it and go back to <br/>
their puzzle to do more on it, anytime they want. They never have to study <br/>
isolated pieces and they never have the frustration of having pieces withheld <br/>
from them and they don&#39;t even have to TRY to put the puzzle together until <br/>
they feel comfortable that they&#39;ve got a good enough background outline.<br/>
<br/>
AND - unschoolers know, all the time, that there (paradoxically) is no puzzle <br/>
&lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
In school they act like there is a given body of information to learn -- <br/>
educators spend endless hours in committee meetings deciding what needs to be <br/>
learned - which translates into them spending endless hours picking out which <br/>
puzzle pieces they&#39;ll make the kids study.<br/>
<br/>
But that is an illusion. There is no puzzle to complete. There will never be <br/>
a moment where you say, &quot;Done!&quot; --- never a time when you&#39;ll see the whole <br/>
big picture at once and how all the small pieces fit together just perfectly. <br/>
Nope. Life isn&#39;t really like that. <br/>

<br/>
And even the model would need to be four dimensional, not flat.  <br/>
<br/>
I was making Thinking Sticks this morning, and realized that for each topic <br/>
or thing in the world there are some experts.  Experts on glass.  And they <br/>
see the glass in everything.  They know glass in history and the future of <br/>
glass. They see chemistry of glass, and economics of glass, legal liability <br/>
of glass, structural issues involving glass.  Storage, transportation, <br/>
cleaning, tensile strength, resistence to heat and cold and pressure of glass.<br/>
<br/>
I realized when I was a kid that my dad knew were pipes were.  He wasn&#39;t a <br/>
plumber, but his model of the universe included where pipes were in houses, <br/>
and stores, and factories.  Where the electrical conduits entered and left.  <br/>
Where water pipes came from and where sewer pipes went.  His map of our town <br/>
and the world had pipes.  Mine didn&#39;t.  Mind had front doors and yards.<br/>
<br/>
A person can look at the world through a chesspiece or a piece of leather as <br/>
easily as through a pipe or through glass!!<br/>
<br/>
So Thinking Sticks and other such mix-it-up games (which at some point become <br/>
the &quot;method&quot; of unschooling, just following whatever all comes to hand to the <br/>
other places they lead) are stopping for a moment at someone&#39;s specialty or <br/>
current interest.  Could be shoes.  Could be cash registers, or clouds.  But <br/>
it can lead to every other thing in the universe if you&#39;re willing to catch <br/>
it and ride.<br/>

It is amazing just how big the world is, or how many worlds there are. My dad collects stamps (he&#39;s a philatelist, a word I learned when I was really young because of him). When I get any mail with stamps, I carefully slit the envelope and save it, and then I bring them to him. To me, they all look about the same, although I&#39;m starting to catch the interesting cancels and the coil numbers, if I look. To him, though, it&#39;s a whole world with it&#39;s own intricacies and meanings. He bought an old stamp collection at a yard sale a year or so ago and it was a wonderful find, first because it included about $150 in &quot;postally unused&quot; US stamps that he can now just put on letters, but also because the rest was so disorganized that he had hours of joy just sorting through it all. <br/>
<br/>
He also dabbles in lepidoptery (butterfly collecting), and can tell at twenty feet that a yellow butterfly that looks just like all the other yellow butterflies flying around a meadow is something totally different - maybe because of the way it&#39;s flying, or some other minute detail. Again, the minutiae involved is amazing. I&#39;ve learned just enough to realize how much I don&#39;t know (I can identify common butterflies like monarchs and painted ladies and the ubiquitous cabbage white) but he knows a lot more... and he still talks about other people who are more-expert, about this guy living in this small town who is an expert on a certain kind of little green moth.... do you realize how many little brown moths have never been identified or classified? There are so many of them... there are probably moths coming to your outside light at night that have no name at all...<br/>
<br/>
I remember watching a movie once about the world living in a drop of water, and I  think I&#39;m just now realizimg how many drops of water there are, how many worlds. It&#39;s all truly incredible, and I feel like a guest at a huge and wonderful feast, sitting before a table piled high with knowledge of all shapes and sizes. It&#39;s wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
When I was little I thought I knew every animal in the world, because the same ones appeared over and over in storybooks and zoos and no one ever suggested there were others. Seeing a llama rocked my little world, and opened doors to knowledge I had never imagined was there. <br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling is seeing how many worlds there are to know, and being free to immerse yourself in the ones or ones that you chose.<br/>
