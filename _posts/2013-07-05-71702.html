<div id="ygrps-yiv-127981764">I had an interested conversation with my kids today that I thought I&#39;d share.<br/>
<br/>
Today we went grocery shopping and I bought the kid ice cream.  While we were standing in the check out line, the man in front of us said, &quot;Wow, your mom got you ice cream!  She&#39;s a nice mom!  You must have been good kids today to get ice cream.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I just smiled and said, &quot;Well, we don&#39;t use food as a reward, but yes they are good.&quot;  (Not getting into my dislike of labeling kids good or bad with him).<br/>
<br/>
My 7 year old, who recently stayed with her aunt for a few days, said, &quot;Yah, you&#39;re not like aunty _____.  When we went to the store with her, she said she would only buy us ice cream if we were good, but you don&#39;t do that.  You buy us ice cream any time we want!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I told her that I appreciated when they are cooperative in the store, but that she was right, I would not use food as bribery.  Then I asked her what she thought that meant if she wasn&#39;t &quot;good.&quot;  She said she didn&#39;t know.  I said that the opposite of good is bad. She said, &quot;Oh! No, we aren&#39;t bad!  We are just kids and we&#39;re learning.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I told her that I agreed that they were not bad and that if they were having a hard time, it was usually because they were hungry or tired.  They added maybe thirsty or they needed to go to the bathroom or they were overwhelmed.  I said that I was glad they were learning to recognize those tings and that when they felt that way, we could help fix the problem so they felt better.  <br/>
<br/>
I said that I believed food was for eating.  My oldest said, &quot;Yah, it&#39;s for eating!  It&#39;s not like... a trophy!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
When we got home, all three of them wanted the ice cream before dinner and I said yes.  All three of them (ages 7, 5, and 2) only ate a few bites before putting it in the freezer to save for later. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107117228">Reminds me of a conversation with my son after a visit to his Gran&#39;s. Granny likes to eat three regular meals a day and seems to think anyone who doesn&#39;t do that is lacking in some way. We mostly fit in with this when we visit, to suit her and to be polite (we don&#39;t visit often!!)<br/>
<br/>
Sam says &quot;Granny gives me biscuits afterwards if I eat all my meal&quot; I asked, &quot;so what do you do?&quot; he said &quot;I eat all my meal if I want to, then I have a biscuit if I fancy one&quot;.<br/>

My kids always ate what they wanted when they wanted. One of them once<br/>
asked me, &quot;What is dessert?&quot; (pudding for you Brits)<br/>
<br/>
I said it is something sweet you eat after dinner. She asked what you call<br/>
it when you eat something sweet before dinner.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-462942954">My children used to think that dessert was only from a restaurant.  Because<br/>
we didn&#39;t assign labels to food unless we were in a restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
I was planning a dinner party and was writing notes about &quot;starters&quot;,<br/>
&quot;mains&quot; and desserts....<br/>
<br/>
My daughter actually said, &quot;Are we playing restaurant?&quot;<br/>
