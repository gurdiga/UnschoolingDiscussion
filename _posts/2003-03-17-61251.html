<div id="ygrps-yiv-566824478">I think I have the flu.  My body aches so violently, it hurts to wear <br/>
clothes.  I have a severe sore throat and absolutely no voice (a symptom <br/>
several people in my family are enjoying!).  My dilemma is this: my <br/>
mother-in-law is expected to live perhaps another 12-24 hours, at which point <br/>
my husband will fly across the country for the funeral.  I will be here with <br/>
three delightfully spirited children who are a challenge even when I am <br/>
feeling well.  Does anyone have any miracle remedies for me?  I&#39;d be <br/>
interested in *anything* that would put me back on my feet.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

turned out to be strep infection and I took my antibiotics and was feeling <br/>
much better in about 24 hours and felt 100% better in 2 days.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you near enough for someone here to go and take care of you and for their <br/>
kids to hang out with yours?  Is there someone who could take your kids away <br/>
for a while?  Is there a teenager you know who could come and stay with them <br/>
at night?  A homeschooled teen who could stay with you until your husband <br/>
gets back?<br/>
<br/>
I take Nyquill without guilt or fear when I think I&#39;m going to die but I have <br/>
to take care of kids.  But having another human and sleeping off your flu <br/>
would be better.<br/>

who wasn&#39;t...how shall I put this kindly...completely insane.<br/>
