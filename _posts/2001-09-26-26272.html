 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s fine to spend as much time together as you&#39;re both comfortable <br/>
with.  Something to keep in mind though.  If your son is able to make a <br/>
small group of homeschooling friends while he&#39;s young, say under about 10, <br/>
he&#39;s going to be a little less likely to want to go to school when he hits <br/>
the teens.  At least that&#39;s what happened in the opposite direction with my <br/>
son.  I avoided the drive to town (time, gas) as much as possible when he <br/>
was younger.  Unfortunately, that&#39;s where the hs kids are.  There aren&#39;t <br/>
any close to his age in our small town, so he has stuck to the friends he&#39;s <br/>
made playing sports.  They all go to school.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, he does. And no, I haven&#39;t. I&#39;m just retraining my mind and concept of <br/>
*family*. In my own home growing up, we all had our own thing, which to some <br/>
degree is great. But there just wasn&#39;t this unity feeling that I see/feel in <br/>
other families that are tight knit. Ours was more like a group of people that <br/>
just happened to live in the same house. And as was posted in another <br/>
message, it was like life outside the home mattered more. So I understand why <br/>
my family thinks it&#39;s weird, but sometimes I can&#39;t handle the opposition, so <br/>
to speak.  I&#39;m so grateful for this mailing list!!!<br/>

childrearing that was designed to raise the most obedient and fiercest soldiers<br/>

Men.  I think it&#39;s a huge, but popular, myth that spending time with mom causes<br/>
boys to take on (eek!) feminine qualities.   (Not that I think feminine<br/>
qualities are bad, but our culture does.)<br/>
