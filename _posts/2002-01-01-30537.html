<br/>
Once upon a grim reality . . .<br/>
BY MAUREEN DOWD <br/>
New York Times columnist <br/>
<br/>
NEW YORK: When I was little, I was a Grimms girl. Not a Hans <br/>
Christian Andersen girl. I much preferred the more grisly Grimms&#39; <br/>
fairy tales, where people got hands chopped off and hearts and <br/>
tongues cut out, to the sunnier ones by the Dane.<br/>
<br/>
The nuns made us climb under our desks for air-raid drills, and cried <br/>
and sent us home early the day JFK was shot. We knew the world wasn&#39;t <br/>
a big ice-skating rink.<br/>
<br/>
So I can appreciate the surprise popularity, ballooning since Sept. <br/>
11, of Lemony Snicket&#39;s epic saga about the wretched Baudelaire <br/>
orphans, whose cascading woes make Oliver Twist seem blessed.<br/>
<br/>
After 9-11, the great chatterers predicted that adults would want to <br/>
escape with light romantic movies. But instead, rentals of blow-&#39;em-<br/>
up and terrorism movies spiked. Just so, many kids seem in the mood <br/>
for something a bit darker.<br/>
<br/>
The very first thing that happens to the Baudelaires is that a family <br/>
friend, Mr. Poe, comes down to the beach to tell them their parents <br/>
have perished in a fire, and their mansion is destroyed. Everything <br/>
to come, the narrator cautions, is ``rife with misfortune, misery, <br/>
and despair.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
On the New York Times&#39; best-seller list for children on Sept. 30, <br/>
reflecting sales the week of the terrorist attacks, the new Lemony <br/>
Snicket, The Hostile Hospital, trumped Harry Potter at No. 1, with <br/>
four Snickets matching four Potters in the top 10.<br/>
<br/>
The man behind the sour nom de plume, Daniel Handler, has been <br/>
popping up in the Times, the Washington Post, NPR and ABC explaining <br/>
how the real terrible can be soothed by the pretend terrible.<br/>
<br/>
His eight-book series, dubbed A Series of Unfortunate Events, plays <br/>
out in places like Lousy Lane and Grim River and features such <br/>
characters as the Quagmires, who also lost their parents in a <br/>
terrible fire.<br/>
<br/>
The tone is a combination of mock-Victorian and modern-day mocking. <br/>
Consider this observation from The Reptile Room: ``When somebody is a <br/>
little bit wrong -- say, when a waiter puts nonfat milk in your <br/>
espresso macchiato, instead of lowfat milk -- it is often quite easy <br/>
to explain to them how and why they are wrong.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
``The books are definitely popular,&#39;&#39; says Clarissa Cooke, a <br/>
librarian at the 67th Street branch of the New York Public Library. <br/>
``They&#39;re like Edward Gorey for children.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Handler was asked by Terry Gross on NPR to list some of the ordeals <br/>
that befall the Baudelaire siblings. ``They meet Count Olaf, who is a <br/>
distant relative, who is only after the fortune that their parents <br/>
have left behind,&#39;&#39; he rattled off. ``They go to stay with their <br/>
kindly Uncle Monty who&#39;s murdered. They go to stay with their Aunt <br/>
Josephine, who throws herself out of a window or at least so it <br/>
appears. They&#39;re forced to work in a lumber mill. . . . They stay <br/>
with rich people and find themselves falling down an elevator shaft. <br/>
They&#39;re driven out of town by an angry mob, you know, with torches <br/>
and barking dogs. And then in the most recent volume, they find <br/>
themselves prepared for unnecessary surgery in the hospital.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Handler wrote in the Times that children had been sending him letters <br/>
asking whether Count Olaf was a terrorist or the children had been <br/>
near the World Trade Center.<br/>
<br/>
In The Uses of Enchantment, Bruno Bettelheim wrote that gruesome <br/>
fairy tales helped children develop by teaching them to ``meet <br/>
danger, do battle.&#39;&#39; Alison Lurie, the author and Cornell professor <br/>
of children&#39;s literature, has a similar theory. ``Children know the <br/>
world is not an absolutely safe place,&#39;&#39; she said, speaking from her <br/>
Ithaca, N.Y., home. ``If they&#39;re living in an affluent society and <br/>
their parents try to protect them from everything, they sense this <br/>
isn&#39;t the way the world really is. So books that admit bad things <br/>
happen are very restful to them, and seem more real.<br/>
<br/>
``What do we do about Sept. 11? Are we going to pretend it never <br/>
happened, tell kids to forget about that, it didn&#39;t count? They know <br/>
that&#39;s a lie. It&#39;s better to have books that admit the world has <br/>
dangers and at the same time reassure kids, if they stick together <br/>
they can survive.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
When last spied, the Baudelaires were locked in the villain&#39;s trunk. <br/>
``Count Olaf&#39;s trunk would have to do,&#39;&#39; the children told <br/>
themselves, ``until something better came along.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
The triumph of hope over experience. A valuable lesson at any age.<br/>
