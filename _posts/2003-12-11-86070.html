<br/>
       The lesbians and gay guys I know personally are very comfortable being <br/>
who they are. <br/>
<br/>
       The list might be interested in this btw: our capital city newspaper <br/>
has a fulltime reporter who also writes a weekly parenting-family column and is <br/>
enthusiastic about her homosexuality. She and her life partner have two sons <br/>
together and also are a mixed-religion family (Christian-Jewish.) She writes <br/>
very poignantly about all kinds of issues, including their run-ins as two moms <br/>
at the boys&#39; schools, blending the holiday traditions and recently, about the <br/>
gay marriage thing and whether or not they take this new opportunity to <br/>
legally marry each other.<br/>
<br/>
       The link for the newspaper is www.tallahassee.com and the columnist&#39;s <br/>
name is Sharon Rauch.  JJ<br/>
