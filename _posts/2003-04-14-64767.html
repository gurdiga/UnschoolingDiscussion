the ability of the person with the subject, like I won&#39;t tell my daughter an <br/>
iron is hot and then say, &quot;Go ahead and touch it and see for yourself.&quot;  LOL! <br/>

better than just saying, &quot;It&#39;s hot and will hurt you, so get as far away as <br/>

I doubt you tell your daughter or your friend to try lending money to someone <br/>
you KNOW hasn&#39;t paid you or others back.  I doubt you told her what you <br/>
thought about drugs, and then said, &quot;But you should use drugs yourself to <br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s no one I trust enough to give them control of my life.<br/>
There are people I trust more than others.<br/>
And it&#39;s neither worth it nor possible to try everything in the whole world <br/>
and so people do tend to be discriminating with the time and resources they <br/>
have.<br/>
<br/>
Aren&#39;t trust and credibility of any value?<br/>
I think they are.<br/>

I could care less about shushing anyone, and in fact wouldn&#39;t want <br/>
other people to not say what they think is true.  But I do feel <br/>
obligated to offer another viewpoint so that others will hopefully <br/>
think twice before completely dismissing things they know nothing <br/>
about for themselves, based on someone else&#39;s reaction.  On an <br/>
unschooling list I think checking something out for oneself shouldn&#39;t <br/>
be frowned upon.<br/>

<br/>
In my last post I specifically said I wouldn&#39;t tell my daughter to <br/>
touch a hot iron to see for herself.  That&#39;s a limiting view on how <br/>
to go about learning something.  There are other ways to discover and <br/>
observe than putting oneself in jeopardy.  Nor does someone have to <br/>
do drugs to see the effects it has.  And yes, if my daughter insisted <br/>
on lending someone money that I didn&#39;t think would pay it back, I&#39;d <br/>
let her learn it for herself.  I wouldn&#39;t give the okay to jump off a <br/>
bridge if she insisted on finding out what it&#39;s like (not without a <br/>
bungy cord), but I hardly think that learning more about a different <br/>
religious philosophy is dangerous.  The lesson taught there is &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>
learn... it&#39;s dangerous.&quot;<br/>

Just out of curiosity, how long have you been involved, and how high up the<br/>
hierarchy are you?  Are you an auditor?  Have you spent any time in their<br/>
org?<br/>

a bit of time in several orgs, and I&#39;ve had several auditors.  I&#39;ve just <br/>
begun training and have completed the course in how to study, which has <br/>
helped tremendously in many areas of life.  Non-training (personal) -wise <br/>
I&#39;ve done the purification program and have seen a positive difference in <br/>
mental clarity and physical health after getting rid of toxins, drugs, etc. <br/>
in my body.  I&#39;ve also learned a great deal from books, lectures and whatnot. <br/>
 Some of it has been a challenging journey, but once through it, there was no <br/>
mistaking the permanent gains I got and the clarity was priceless.   So far <br/>
these are my personal experiences with it.<br/>

<br/>
Every single day I provide free information to people about unschooling.  <br/>
Just about the only days I don&#39;t are when I&#39;m at a conference speaking.  <br/>
Sometimes people pay to go to the conferences, but they&#39;re not forbidden to <br/>
pass on what they learn there, and most of the expense is the hotel and food. <br/>
 So to share information in person with other families costs money, but to <br/>
join this list or to go to sites online, that&#39;s all free.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t know much about religions, how do you know Scientology is like <br/>
or unlike other religions?  It seems to be a business, and not a religion.  <br/>
And by &quot;seems to be&quot; I mean shares characteristics with businesses and not <br/>
with religions.   So why are they considered a religion?  Are there meeting <br/>
places people can show up to and join in worship or study?<br/>

<br/>
Scientology frowns on passing on &quot;verbal&quot; information since it is subject to the opinions and/or interpretation of the individual.  It has often been observed that &quot;verbal data&quot; has been passed on with vital pieces missing or with false interpretations, prejudices or misunderstandings, and this has only served to distort the subject from its original intention, making it seem conflicting, incomprehensible or unusable.  Since Scientology&#39;s only goal is to help people, they only want to ensure info is passed on correctly without alteration so that people can benefit from it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you don&#39;t know much about religions, how do you know Scientology is like or unlike other religions?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never said I knew if Scientology is like or unlike other religions.  I do feel though, that a religion should address the spirit or spiritual growth, and it&#39;s my belief that Scientology does this.  It has business-like aspects, of course, as it takes money and an entire administrative system to run a church, organization, courseroom, stock materials and staff, etc.  But I&#39;d say every religion has a business-aspect to it.  They do have a courseroom for study and Sunday Service in most churches.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I honestly don&#39;t know about other religions.  But I do know that Scientology <br/>
is non-profit, and it takes a good sized staff effectively trained to run a <br/>
church that can deliver all the services they provide.  That&#39;s not accounting <br/>
for all the money that goes toward helping improve the environment.  For one <br/>
example, they recently set up a purification program in New York City for the <br/>
9/11 firefighters.  So many of these firefighters were literally dying of <br/>
toxins they were exposed to at the World Trade Center, and no one and no <br/>
doctors could help them.  We had to literally fight to be allowed to set this <br/>
program up for these guys to help them... even though it was entirely out of <br/>
pocket for Scientology.  And after completing the program, people who were <br/>
previously very sick are walking out of the program feeling in better health <br/>
than they did even before 9/11.  (How evil of us.)  I don&#39;t know of anyone <br/>
getting rich in Scientology.  Not financially.  But I do know a lot of people <br/>
in Scientology who really bust their asses everyday to help people.<br/>

<br/>
Is this sarcasm Scientology-approved?<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t ever say &quot;evil,&quot; I was just questioning whether it could be so clear <br/>
that Tia was wrong and everything had changed and that it was not psychology <br/>
but religion.    &quot;Walking out of the program feeling in better health&quot; sounds <br/>
much like counselling.   Giving it away to victims of a disaster isn&#39;t the <br/>
same as making it available free to just anyone.<br/>
<br/>
There is a principle they teach in applied psychology.  I&#39;ve forgotten its <br/>
name, but the way undergrads used to run the test to prove it was to show <br/>
people something (a movie was typical) or let them participate in some <br/>
activity.  Some groups were not charged money.  Some were charged a little <br/>
bit. Some were charged quite a bit.  Then they reviewed the activity or movie <br/>
to tell how much they liked it.    The middle group liked it best, no matter <br/>
what it was.  <br/>
<br/>
When someone gets something for free, they put little value on it.  When <br/>
someone pays a LOT for something, they&#39;re justifiably critical if it&#39;s not <br/>
fabulous.  If they pay some money they want to justify paying that money, and <br/>
if they can find their $2 worth, then they declare themselves satisfied, and <br/>
they think they got a good deal.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s true that Scientology is based in psychology, then the founders <br/>
probably knew that principle and that could be some of their justification <br/>
for charging money.  If they charge enough to make it seem important but not <br/>
enough to make people really critical and embarrassed to have spent so much, <br/>
it will be &quot;just right.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Yes. Exactly.<br/>
Unity does not push membership and if they DID ask for 10% upon becoming a <br/>
member, I&#39;d run.<br/>
So far, all of the classes they offer are open to anyone, whether you go to <br/>
the church or not. And the class I just finished was &quot;love offerings&quot; for <br/>
payment. I think I gave a total of $15 for a 6wk. course. I wanted to give <br/>
more, it was worth it, but just didn&#39;t have it at the time. <br/>
I&#39;ve gone for several months and never felt any pressure about money.<br/>
All the classes and spiritual teachings are available to anyone that wants it.<br/>
<br/>
I was raised in a church that was very secretive about money. NEVER again.<br/>
Honesty is important to me. A church that charges for spiritual information <br/>
would have me running the other direction.<br/>
