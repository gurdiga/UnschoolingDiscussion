<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422537527">lisa writes &lt;&lt;Anyway my problem is my mom. She just <br/>
<br/>
totally opposes the idea of homeschooling especially unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
moms can be so influential, no matter what our age!  amazing.  it reminds me <br/>
about being a mother to my children, that they are listening and they do hear <br/>
me and makes me be gentler w/my power!  i am glad you have support otherwise. <br/>
 i agree (with someones response) that rather than re-acting (we cant help it <br/>
sometimes!) to be pro-active and think of something your mom can contribute <br/>
is a great way to start!  mom, you are so good at _____, i would love to <br/>
offer that in our &quot;school&quot;  would you be willing to share??  that might <br/>
impress her that you really have confidence in the workings of your method.  <br/>
then share your doubts (when you naturally have them!)  with OTHERS -- hubby, <br/>
supporters, email list! <br/>
best wishes!<br/>
