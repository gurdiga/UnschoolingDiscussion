<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621670498">Hi Everyone!<br/>
 <br/>
I would like to extend an invitation to all of you......<br/>
 <br/>
I have just joined a newly formed group, moderated by a very good <br/>
friend of mine, Millie Pinson. Millie&#39;s goal for this group is to <br/>
provide an atmosphere of discussion relating to inclusiveness within <br/>
the homeschooling community.<br/>
 <br/>
Please join us! The information is below! Hope to see you there!<br/>
Patti and the boys (Chris 13, Matthew 7, Anthony 6)<br/>

&quot;For no matter where knowledge and learning come from - no matter<br/>
what shape, size, or dimension it assumes - it still is what it is,<br/>
knowledge and learning. Therefore knowledge and learning should<br/>
always be embraced.&quot; ~ unknown<br/>

Dear Home Schoolers,<br/>
Please come and discuss the issue of inclusivity within the home<br/>
schooling community. What it is. What is isn&#39;t. How we can make it<br/>
happen. Why we should. To what extent we should.<br/>
