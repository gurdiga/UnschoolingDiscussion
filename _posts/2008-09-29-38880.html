<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449418847">I thought I&#39;d  look this up.  Scott&#39;s Daily Groove mentioned the history of<br/>
the words weird/worth.  The idea to make a list with these in mind is pretty<br/>
cool too.  So sure enough.. weird is connected to worth and it&#39;s good:<br/>
<br/>
weird O.E. wyrd &quot;fate, destiny&quot; (n.), lit. &quot;that which comes,&quot; from P.Gmc.<br/>
*wurthis (cf. O.S. wurd, O.H.G. wurt &quot;fate,&quot; O.N. urðr &quot;fate, one of the<br/>
three Norns&quot;), from PIE *wert- &quot;to turn, wind,&quot; (cf. Ger. werden, O.E.<br/>
weorðan &quot;to become&quot;), from base *wer- &quot;to turn, bend&quot; (see versus). For<br/>
sense development from &quot;turning&quot; to &quot;becoming,&quot; cf. phrase turn into<br/>
&quot;become.&quot; The modern sense of weird developed from M.E. use of weird sisters<br/>
for the three fates or Norns (in Gmc. mythology), the goddesses who<br/>
controlled human destiny. They were usually portrayed as odd or frightening<br/>
in appearance, as in &quot;Macbeth,&quot; which led to the adj. meaning &quot;odd-looking,<br/>
uncanny,&quot; first recorded 1815.<br/>

:: Weird Is Good! ::<br/>
<br/>
Our culture is full of contradictions. For example,<br/>
it&#39;s good to be unique and original, but it&#39;s not good<br/>
to go too far off the beaten path... &quot;Don&#39;t be *weird*!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But aren&#39;t uniqueness and originality weird by<br/>
definition?<br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s settle this once and for all: It&#39;s *good* to<br/>
be weird! In fact, the words *weird* and *worthy* have<br/>
the same root. (Really!)<br/>
<br/>
If you subscribe to &quot;The Daily Groove,&quot; you&#39;re<br/>
probably a weird parent. You don&#39;t *do* conventional<br/>
parenting, and you probably get strange looks from<br/>
parents who do. If you think they think you&#39;re weird,<br/>
it&#39;s because they do!<br/>
<br/>
But only because YOU ARE! :-)<br/>
<br/>
So get a piece of paper and write &quot;Weird Things I Do&quot;<br/>
along the top, then make a list... a LONG list.<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re done, cross out &quot;Weird Things I Do&quot; and<br/>
change it to &quot;Things I Appreciate About Myself!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, whenever someone points out your weirdness, you<br/>
can proudly agree and accept the compliment: &quot;Thanks!&quot; :-)<br/>
