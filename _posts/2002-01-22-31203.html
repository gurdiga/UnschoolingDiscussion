<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981858279">Morning,<br/>
I requested (and received) a free pocketguide to homeschooling from HEM<br/>
(Home Education Magazine). It is terrific to give to all of those naysayers,<br/>
in-laws, outlaws, nosy neighbors, etc. Who just DON&#39;T get it...<br/>

I love hearing about all of these colleges! I went to Ohio University in<br/>
Athens, Ohio, smaller not that small but it was cozy.<br/>
