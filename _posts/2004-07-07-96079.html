<br/>
&lt;&lt; Looking back I wonder why I had to do all that but I guess it&#39;s the <br/>
<br/>
way men were taught to view their children then. &quot;Do as I say.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s still happening.<br/>
That&#39;s why it&#39;s so hard, I think, for families who are trying to be different <br/>
to just live their lives without so much side commentary about &quot;just hit <br/>
them&quot; kind of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sometimes I <br/>
<br/>
wonder if we are making any head way....but we are; it&#39;s just <br/>
<br/>
frustrating to deal with outdated, old fashioned emotional garbage. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think our kids will not fall into stuff like that.  They can&#39;t &quot;fall into <br/>
it.&quot;  They didn&#39;t grow up with it!    Things are changing, but it does seem <br/>
slow.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I got an e-mail.  Probably lots of other people who are listed <br/>
somewhere or other as contacts did too:<br/>
