&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1215<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I know I&#39;ve only been here a few weeks but I was really looking for a group<br/>
&gt; of folks that we tolerant and understanding of the differences in the<br/>
&gt; choices people make.  The past few days have been one post after another<br/>
&gt; hammering the same subject.  Most, if not all, of us have thrown in our two<br/>
&gt; cents.  Move on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We/they will, when we&#39;re all ready. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re a newbie to<br/>
mailing lists in general or just this one, but you&#39;ll start to recognize the<br/>
cycles that mailing lists MUST go through. People have to keep going until<br/>
they&#39;re done. If you or I are done with the topic, we just have to use our<br/>
delete key and some patience. :) It would be a real shocker if the spanking<br/>
discussion/debate persisted longer than a week. By then, even the most<br/>
passionate have had enough.<br/>
<br/>
Breathe in. Go plant some flowers. If it&#39;s making you insane, just delete<br/>
all the mail for 7 days and come back, I guarantee the topic will have moved<br/>
on. Of course, it will come back again, like an annoying relative, at<br/>
regular intervals. The quicker we accept this is so, the less we have to<br/>
fuss and stress over it.<br/>
<br/>
No sarcasm or irritability intended,<br/>
