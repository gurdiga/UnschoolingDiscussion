I wonder a few other things about Marilyn&#39;s question. It would appear that <br/>
she is appealing to our good senses about just what kind of society we will <br/>
have if everyone is off homeschooling our kids and there isn&#39;t anyone in the <br/>
workforce to keep the country afloat.<br/>
This woman is certainly assuming that we are going to marry off our kids at <br/>
age 18 when they are done with high school.  I say this because she doesn&#39;t <br/>
mention college or having a life after college. &quot;Raising a rocket scientist&quot; <br/>
can be just that, homeschooling a child that goes to college and post-grad <br/>
school and has a career and then may or may not homeschool.  Where does she <br/>
foolishly get the assumption that there is just one track that a child will <br/>
be taking in life after homeschooling?  <br/>
My daughter is being homeschooled and will attend college, as do many other <br/>
homeschooled children. I&#39;ve read a few articles indicating that universities <br/>
SEEK OUT homeschooled kids because of the achievements of the h/s kids they <br/>
already have seen in their university or college.  <br/>
Marilyn&#39;s logic is ridiculously short-sighted and narrow.  If my child <br/>
finishes grad school and becomes a vet (as is her desire) then what is the <br/>
harm in her having a practice, getting married, having children and <br/>
homeschooling them?  Marilyn needs to take a look at reality today and see <br/>
that we aren&#39;t in the &quot;old days&quot; where girls didn&#39;t have educational <br/>
opportunities.  The education I received has helped me to educate my child. <br/>
The education she is receiving will help her educate her child(ren) I hope.  <br/>
Leaving my child in the hands of public schools is the worst possible <br/>
treatment she can receive.  Aside from one-size-fits-all academics, the peer <br/>
pressure to grow up fast, have sex young and be distracted from the freedom <br/>
to know who she is as an individual is rampant in school.  I want to have <br/>
more influence over my child than a pack of 11 year old classmates!  I <br/>
believe that I am better equipped to intelligently influence my 15 year old <br/>
daughter when she is at an impressionable and critical age.  Homeschooling <br/>
allows my child freedom of having the best start in life.  To think a school <br/>
would somehow &quot;rob&quot; her of anything is absolutely ridiculous, logically <br/>
fallible and dangerously close to a Big Brother era in our lives.  I&#39;m not <br/>
training her to be a homeschooler, I&#39;m training her to be an individual with <br/>
wisdom, knowledge, self-esteem, security and maturity.<br/>
