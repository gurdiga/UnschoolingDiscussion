&lt;&lt;  His big one was<br/>
something about how you can make a perfect star by drawing a circle and<br/>
knowing the formula of how to divide it using a compass.  I &quot;casually&quot;<br/>
mentioned how I had never done that &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I learned it in 7th grade, and it&#39;s COOL, but...<br/>
Why didn&#39;t he just show it to them as a cool thing instead of challenging <br/>
them to prove he knew something they didn&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s immature and non-productive.<br/>
<br/>
Had he shown them, it would be like a magic trick, but he made it ugly and <br/>
now they might have star-trauma! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A five-pointed star is 72 degrees, but a SIX pointed star is SUPER COOL--it&#39;s <br/>
just the radius.  So if you made a circle with a compass (and one you can <br/>
tighten, not a cheapo one), keep it right there.  Mark one place on the <br/>
circle with a little light arc with the pencil.  Set the point there, and <br/>
make another mark.  Go around, and if the compass didn&#39;t slip, the last mark <br/>
will be in the same place as the first one.  Connect every other one and <br/>
you&#39;ll have a perfect six-pointed star.  <br/>
<br/>
For five point, you divide 360 by 5 and get 72.  You need a protractor, so <br/>
I&#39;m guessing he was just talking about the six pointed star.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But of course, he couldn&#39;t remember how to do it, so went and<br/>
looked it up on the internet.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OH BROTHER!!!!!<br/>
Oh no.  You win forever!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131493805">Yes, it was immature and unproductive, and that is what he was doing to all<br/>
of us for several days.   He is really a smart man, but sometimes acts<br/>
really stupid. (And I still love him)  You know, he is also a very liberal<br/>
man, but not when it comes to HIS grandchildren and homeschooling!<br/>
<br/>
I will tell Meghan about the star, I am sure she will have the compass and<br/>
protractor out within a few minutes.  I do have a good one from when I went<br/>
to the Naval Academy (of course I have no idea how to use the thing, we had<br/>
it for navigation which I never did get the hang of it, lol,  I can get lost<br/>
one block from my house, really!)<br/>
