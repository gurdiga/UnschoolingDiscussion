toward something much much better.   If your girls do not want to be involved <br/>
in thier fathers life ( and I suspect, if they do, its only out of guilt and <br/>
obligation, considering the way he is treating them).. Then RUN as fast as <br/>
you can.. straight toward peace and productivity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-175458953">I certainly agree. I am trying to visualize the happiness this change could bring forth for all of us. I alao feel this would really bring all of us even closer as a family. It will be an incredible experience and adventure for us to share as a family.~Annie~~You may laugh at me because I am different.
