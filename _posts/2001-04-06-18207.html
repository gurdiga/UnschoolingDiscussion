<div id="ygrps-yiv-27926838">Congrats to the family !<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just getting the tail end of the immunization conversations. I&#39;m not sure<br/>
where it began, but personally, I believe in most of them being done. Regardless<br/>
of my dd&#39;s doing unschooling or not. I am very greatful that we live in a<br/>
country where its still our choice. I wont put anyone down for any of their<br/>
beliefs as long as they respect mine as well. Good luck with that new little<br/>
baby. Keep him safe, happy & healthy!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-456857543">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to share with the group our newest blessing, Andrew <br/>
Phillip.  He arrived on March 15th, a day earlier than the scheduled <br/>
csection!  He is absolutely beautiful and doesn&#39;t resemble larvae at <br/>
all (no joke & not a mommy&#39;s predjudice!!).  We are all doing fine!<br/>
<br/>
Before the baby came, I had asked on this message board about <br/>
immunizations and received wonderful responses and resources.  My <br/>
husband and I agreed not to give the baby the Hib shot at the <br/>
hospital (or ever) and had a good laugh at the information the <br/>
hospital gives regarding the shot.  We also laughed (mine probably <br/>
more morphine induced) at the nurses who said, &quot;Well, you know, they <br/>
can&#39;t get into school without their shots.&quot;  Oh, too bad, no school <br/>
for my poor little children.<br/>
<br/>
And the pediatrician (who treated me like I&#39;m a colossal idiot <br/>
considereding this is our 4th) wasn&#39;t happy about our decision <br/>
either.  But what was really funny was when we refused the &quot;newborn <br/>
hearing test&quot; she was downright mad about that...&quot;it&#39;s non-intrusive <br/>
and free, why wouldn&#39;t you have it done?&quot;  Free to whom?  Our <br/>
insurance company?  Or is the hospital now handing out free tests?<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, just wanted to share with the group...<br/>
<br/>
