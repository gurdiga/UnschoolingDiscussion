&lt;&lt; Could someone give examples of &quot;offering&quot; information in a non-lesson-y<br/>
 way?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that this is a great question. And something I really struggled with <br/>
at first because my kids were so used to me trying to &quot;teach&quot; something <br/>
,instead of just offering, that they initially resisted. So part of this <br/>
equation, and undoubtedly the most important one, is the issue of trust <br/>
between parent and child.<br/>
If the child knows that you trust them and they can trust you not to push <br/>
something they don&#39;t want, they will be MUCH more willing to try.<br/>
<br/>
The other part of this equation is something that Sandra has dubbed <br/>
&quot;strewing&quot;. I love the picture of a parent liberally strewing a path before a <br/>
child, rather than following along behind prodding and poking.<br/>
What does strewing consist of in this house? <br/>
Here are a few ideas......If one of my children chooses not to check anything <br/>
out at the library, I might just grab (without saying anything) a few books, <br/>
cassettes or movies I think they&#39;d like....or maybe just ones that interest <br/>
ME. I leave these in obvious places at home and quite often they get picked <br/>
up and used. I don&#39;t prod, I don&#39;t say demeaning things about they &quot;should&quot; <br/>
check something out. I just make things available.<br/>
If it&#39;s something really interesting, I may bring it to their attention and <br/>
leave it at that.<br/>
So there&#39;s one example of &quot;strewing&quot;.<br/>
Another is to leave interesting books you have at home, lying in an unusual <br/>
place where it might get noticed. The bathroom is ideal, as people are <br/>
sometimes &quot;hanging out&#39; in there for a while. LOL<br/>
Strewing can be casual, inviting. That&#39;s what you&#39;re doing...inviting. It may <br/>
be totally ignored, that&#39;s fine. It might be picked up....the point is you&#39;re <br/>
offering.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I enjoy, is to pick up the listing of local events. I will <br/>
peruse the paper for interesting events and activities and mention them. I <br/>
also give them the paper and ask them to tell me if anything catches their <br/>
eye.<br/>
<br/>
I think part of the key for me, is to offer the information in a respectful <br/>
method...just as I would to dh. &quot;Hey, this sounds really cool, why don&#39;t we <br/>
go try this&quot; is a lot more inviting than &quot;you should really try this class, I <br/>
think you&#39;d learn a lot&quot;.<br/>
Although the wording is a very individual thing, I think the idea is to <br/>
offer, but respect a &quot;NO&quot;.....or a &quot;maybe&quot; as much as a &quot;yes&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Another part of this equation in my opinion is the level of interest for the <br/>
parent.<br/>
If you get excited about something, it is very likely to spill over to other <br/>
individuals in the house....just as their excitement hopefully gets you going.<br/>
If you have varied interests that you&#39;re willing to explore, this really sets <br/>
the tone for the children.<br/>
Show them the wide world of opportunities, offer up many options, but be <br/>
respectful of them as individuals. Look at them as your companions in <br/>
learning instead of a person that needs knowledge imparted to them and you&#39;ll <br/>
be well on your way to this concept of   strewing!!<br/>
If you&#39;d like to read more about how other people &quot;strew their paths&quot; there <br/>
is a thread titled just that at unschooling.com message board, full of <br/>
wonderful ideas.<br/>
