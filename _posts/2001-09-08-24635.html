<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038915853">Well, I am on my way out to hook up the boat and decided that I would clear<br/>
out the inbox so it wouldn&#39;t be quite so full when we get back.<br/>
<br/>
It correlates in that supposedly in an unschooling life style one does NOT<br/>
dictate another&#39;s behavior nor &quot;force&quot; one&#39;s opinions on another nor make<br/>
all encompassing statements as being &quot;the&quot; voice of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
In a ps one is &quot;forced&quot; to comform to another&#39;s &quot;expert&quot; opinion of how one<br/>
should act (sit still, stand up straight, do it this way or else &quot;because I<br/>
said so) and how one should interact.  An individual (teacher, principal,<br/>
etc.) is set up as &quot;the&quot; expert, children have to be &quot;taught&quot; the &quot;right&quot;<br/>
way (and the only &quot;right&quot; way) &quot;for their own good&quot; and any deviation is<br/>
&quot;punished&quot; by ridicule in front of a class.  The standard chewing out, again<br/>
by &quot;the&quot; expert.<br/>
<br/>
So, having someone tell me &quot;in no uncertain terms&quot; that my PERCEIVED<br/>
behavior is not acceptable in the eyes of everyone that they have decided<br/>
they speak for because that individual says so, reminds of why I am<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if someone (the person who personally has a problem, not someone who<br/>
has set themselves up as judge and jury and as spokesman for the whole list)<br/>
said to me &quot;Gee, Lynda, I found that rather rude and hurtful to my feelings&quot;<br/>
(notice the singular as in a particular individual), then I would apologize<br/>
and try to find a better way of explaining myself.  Well, most of the time<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; How exactly is it that people telling you how rude you are correlate to<br/>
why you unschool??<br/>

and I would say that yes it does apply to everyone.  She is one of the<br/>
few people I&#39;ve found so far online with whom I can disagree and still<br/>
feel like she is listening to what I say.<br/>
