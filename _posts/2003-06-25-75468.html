&lt;&lt; &lt;  This was a case where you could make a &quot;cult&quot; argument, as well, tho.  <br/>
 Brainwashing, control, social alienation, and the like.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 That argument could be used against lots of Christian churches, and a lot of <br/>
 Christian homeschoolers!<br/>

people hear I&#39;m homeschooling, they often think it&#39;s because I&#39;m Christian.  <br/>
*wrong*<br/>
<br/>
But that reminds me of your post on Children&#39;s Rights.  A lot of the most <br/>
liberal people I&#39;ve talked to, when they had an issue with homeschooling, point <br/>
to those kinds of situations as the dark side of a home based education.  If we <br/>
had a standard Children&#39;s Rights bill, or constitutional amendment, that <br/>
issue wouldn&#39;t be such a problem.  <br/>
<br/>
Hey, maybe all the unschooled kids will get the momentum going one day and <br/>
get the international treaty ratified here in the states.  <br/>
<br/>
To clarify what I&#39;m talking about.....On the human right&#39;s watch page<br/>

&lt;&lt; Despite the convention&#39;s near-universal ratification (only the U.S. and <br/>
Somalia have not ratified it), children are still denied their basic rights. &gt;&gt;<br/>
