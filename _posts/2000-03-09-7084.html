<div id="ygrps-yiv-154004079">hey all,<br/>
i am still sort of on the history thread, but my thoughts are on retention.  <br/>
i am reading different philosophies on remembering/learning info, and would <br/>
love some more thoughts from you live ones.  generally, i retain only things <br/>
that are important to me at the time of learning.  but also generally, i have <br/>
terrible retention...  i think it is actually a coping mechanism i learned in <br/>
school!  it made my school life quite efficient, but i think has damaged my <br/>
ability to retain info now, too.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m reading an interesting book on &quot;brain-based learning.&quot; A lot of what<br/>
they recommend sounds like unschooling to me. The authors talk about<br/>
something that happens a lot in schools which they call &quot;downshifting.&quot; When<br/>
the students and teachers both don&#39;t have any real control over what they<br/>
are learning/teaching and when they are to learn/teach it, they kind of go<br/>
into survival mode, where all they can do is rote memorization of &quot;what&#39;s<br/>
going to be on the test.&quot; Critical thinking, creativity, and higher-order<br/>
thinking go out the window. This is especially true in the age of<br/>
standardized tests, where teachers are forced to teach to the test.<br/>
<br/>
The book is &quot;Education on the Edge of Possibility&quot; by Renate Nummela Caine<br/>
and Geoffrey Caine.<br/>
<br/>
from p. 18: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;We also came to the conclusion that teaching for memorization of<br/>
meaningless facts and procedures dictated by someone else usually induces<br/>
downshifting. Downshifting is a psychophysiological response to threat<br/>
associated with fatigue or perceived helplessness or both. Downshifted<br/>
learners then bypass much of their capacity for higher-order functioning and<br/>
creative thought.&quot;<br/>
