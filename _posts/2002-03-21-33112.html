JMHO here! But I didn&#39;t take the post as defending Andrea Yates, or<br/>

too, am a christian, I do not beat my children with anything. I feel that we<br/>
do &quot;unschool&quot; but according to things I have read here, I think several<br/>
would dissagree with me.  I do not &quot;unparent&quot;. We have a few rules, there<br/>
are consequences if not followed.  To me.. that is life and learning.  Maybe<br/>
I just don&#39;t have a clear picture of things, (I am sure I don&#39;t LOL) but I<br/>
do not understand how a child will ever be able to get a job and work for a<br/>

rules here of the type that need to be enforced.  We have general rules <br/>
like treat people decently and clean up after yourself, but there are no <br/>
punishments for not following those.  It think the only really strict rule <br/>
is that a bike rider needs a brain bucket on his head.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have until yesterday insisted on one chore daily in the kitchen.  After <br/>
another hassle about doing it the way *I* wanted it done, I realized that <br/>
maybe he&#39;d just rather find other ways to contribute to the family.  I was <br/>
right.  He got up today and wanted to work on tidying up the house.  Later <br/>
on he went out and started cleaning up the yard a bit.   (I&#39;m not expecting <br/>
that it will always look this good, but I think he was trying to tell me <br/>
that he appreciated being given a choice about it.  And I mean a choice <br/>
about whether to do it as well as what to do.)<br/>
<br/>
But about that getting a job and working with bosses and rules and <br/>
deadlines, etc.  this same kid has awesome work habits at his real <br/>
job.  His work habits and attitudes are better than most of the adult <br/>
employees.  He&#39;s 14.<br/>

couple of joking corrections, the only posts I&#39;ve seen correcting grammar <br/>
(including my own) have been when the person brought it up <br/>
specifically.  If there&#39;s been a post where someone was putting someone <br/>
else down for their grammar or spelling, I must have missed it.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, stick around and just listen to the conversations about <br/>
discipline, chores, TV, whatever.  If you have an open mind, you just might <br/>
find that you want to start trying some of these ideas yourself.  At least <br/>
that&#39;s what&#39;s been happening for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006817547">I agree that Christians need to start getting the truth about spankings<br/>
out in the Christian community.  Let&#39;s face it, in the Christian<br/>
community, you just don&#39;t hear about things unless you are looking for<br/>
them or they are preached from the pulpit, Christian magazines, radio or<br/>
websites.  When you start talking about not spanking, many will suspect<br/>
you are criticizing and interfering in their parenting.  Some will<br/>
suspect you are the antichrist, trying to interfere in their freedom of<br/>
religion.  They certainly will not listen unless the Christian &quot;expert&quot;<br/>
has said it is so.  I speak firsthand, because these all went through my<br/>
head when I first heard someone call hitting my light little swat on my<br/>
son&#39;s well-cloth-diaper-padded plastic-pants rear at the bank to show him<br/>
I meant business (I had already chased him down and got back in line<br/>
three times).  I was not angry at my son, really.  I just felt like he<br/>
was testing me to see what his boundaries were and what would I do if he<br/>
did not do what I said.  Of course, now I see I was ALL wrong!  But when<br/>
the man in line in front of me said, &quot;Do you always hit your kids in<br/>
public?&quot;  I got in his face and aggressively said, &quot;Yes!  Always!  Do you<br/>
have a problem with that?&quot;  I&#39;m sure I confirmed his opinion that I was<br/>
some sort of violent, fanatical spanking maniac.  I truly felt that he<br/>
was challenging my authority and was sending a message to my children<br/>
that they could not trust me.  I felt very mother bearish.  Now I am<br/>
convinced that God sent that man to the bank that day to test me, and<br/>
rather than politely question his views, I shut off any hope for<br/>
communication by my demeanor.  I was close-minded and rude.  And I paid<br/>
for it by seven more years of misunderstanding my role as parent.  Over<br/>
the years, I would occasionally meet Christians who didn&#39;t spank, but<br/>
what they did seemed more cruel to me, like shutting them in a room or<br/>
grounding them so they could never socialize.  It also seemed like too<br/>
much work for the parent.  The church I presently attend is the first one<br/>
I&#39;ve ever been to where the pastor dared to say the way of gentleness and<br/>
patience is better than spanking.  And to hear what he does when his kids<br/>
don&#39;t do what he wants/says almost made me faint.  I mean literally pass<br/>
out.  His gentleness was so alien to me that I almost couldn&#39;t conceive<br/>
of it.  I learned parenting not from the church, but from my mom.  When I<br/>
first had my oldest, I think I did it naturally and right until a<br/>
busy-body started telling me to discipline him better.  Before that, I<br/>
just simply picked him up if he was headed for the fireplace with a &quot;No,<br/>
no, hot.&quot;  My mother slapped, kicked, yanked, pulled and beat, but had<br/>
other times of being very affectionate.  To me, a predictable, controlled<br/>
spanking was better than the way she was.  But now I&#39;ve found a better<br/>
way.  If someone had presented the information to me in a logical manner<br/>
with all the alternatives a long time ago, my children would have been<br/>
better off.  I would have sought more information and I would have<br/>
learned the lessons then that I had to learn later, and I could have<br/>
shown my husband a better way, too.  Oh well, better late than never. <br/>
Now I don&#39;t believe in any form of negative discipline.  Not even time<br/>
outs, except as a cooling off suggestion when someone&#39;s temper is wild. <br/>
I am learning to relate to my children in a different manner.  Not that<br/>
there was a terrible relationship before, it is just much more mutually<br/>
respectful.  I am still learning the new ways, and it is so good to be<br/>
changing.<br/>
I guess I needed to tell this story for myself.  I hope no one minds.<br/>

I didn&#39;t say that.<br/>
<br/>
I said Andrea Yates was a fan of the passage that many Christian <br/>

spoons and such.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter if a million Christians do NOT beat their children, what <br/>
makes my statement true is that there are Christian Homeschooling WEBsites <br/>
which advocate it, and use the threatening Bible verse that says if the <br/>
parents fail to discipline the children, God will get them.<br/>
<br/>
It seems there are five children dead and thousands of others getting marked <br/>
by spankings because LOTS of Christians don&#39;t believe the counter-arguments <br/>
posted here today.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to defend what the Bible says, do it there, to the <br/>
Christians who are claiming another interpretation.<br/>

Yes, I&#39;m sure he was, and I don&#39;t have a problem with that now.  In fact,<br/>
it was true, I don&#39;t believe I had the authority to hit my child.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think my kids could trust me then.  I was sending all the wrong<br/>
messages to Caleb.  I was also strongly influenced to control him by the<br/>
feeling that he was getting on everyone&#39;s nerves, even though no one had<br/>
complained.  That one man who thought hitting a child in public was<br/>
&quot;disgusting&quot; was the one whose opinion I should have cared about.  My<br/>
sister-in-law and I have discussed the fact that we both gave up our<br/>
natural parenting instincts because of a fear of offending other people. <br/>

I said something to a woman who dragged her little girl out of the library by <br/>
the arm one day, spanking her and yelling at her, and kind of threw her <br/>
toward a bench, still yelling.  I can&#39;t remember exactly what I said, but it <br/>
was more for the girl&#39;s benefit than for her mom&#39;s.  It was something like <br/>
maybe she (the mom) should calm down and think of something better to do.  <br/>
She glared at me and said something like &quot;mind your own business,&quot; but the <br/>
thing is she had made it my business by doing it in front of my and my own <br/>
young child.  And so I stared levelly back right in her eyes, in way of <br/>
letting her know I wasn&#39;t going to back down and I wasn&#39;t going to forget it. <br/>

I expect she was not as mean to the girl, at least for a while.<br/>

house looks, but it drives me nuts to see literal garbage mixed in with the <br/>
dirty dishes I&#39;m going to wash, just because someone was too lazy to put it <br/>
in the garbage.  All in all, I&#39;d rather do the clearing and stacking myself <br/>
unless I&#39;m going out in the evening.  And Lars already seems much happier <br/>
and easier to get along with since I told him I was leaving his <br/>
contributions up to him.  It&#39;s amazing how such a seemingly little thing <br/>
can make such a big difference.  I guess it&#39;s because it&#39;s not really that <br/>
little.<br/>

silverware away straight - - but the flipside, I don&#39;t care how the<br/>
pots and pans are put away.)<br/>

<br/>
I am laughing hysterically! This is a big deal for me. since I am the cook<br/>
(they think i&#39;m short-order)<br/>
I need the Kitchen kept a certain way. Things go where they go so when you<br/>
need something it&#39;s there.<br/>
The day we moved in, I placed all the pots and pans in the cabinet. Frying &<br/>
saute pans nested, pots with lids on top in a particular place oven mitts to<br/>
the left.<br/>
This is how it has been since. I even called everyone over and said. See how<br/>
the pots & pans are placed? We can see all of them, the lids are right<br/>
there, so no searching. Everyone agreed, &quot;wow, that&#39;s so organized. What a<br/>
great idea. Yea we can do that&quot;<br/>
&lt;big sigh&gt;<br/>
Everytime I open to door after the dishes are put away I see........<br/>
Big lids on little pots, little lids IN big pots, big pans on top of little<br/>
pans.<br/>
I can never find anything.<br/>
WHY CAN&#39;T THEY DO AS I SAY?!?!?!?!&lt;stomping foot&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581913188">We had several instances of children being brought into the hospital where I<br/>
worked who were severly beaten AT HOME after an incident in public.<br/>
<br/>
And, on the other hand, I&#39;ve received calls and cards at a later date or<br/>
heard from other kids that an intervention like that saved their lives or at<br/>
least made it somewhat better.<br/>
<br/>
There is no way to know which way the abuser will react but I hate to do<br/>
nothing simply because sometimes it makes it worse.<br/>
<br/>
guess you have to file this under &quot;damned if you do, damned if you don&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt;  And so I stared levelly back right in her eyes, in way of<br/>
&gt; &gt;letting her know I wasn&#39;t going to back down and I wasn&#39;t going to forget<br/>
it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I expect she was not as mean to the girl, at least for a while.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Possibly.  I&#39;ve heard adults who were abused as children say that that<br/>
kind<br/>
&gt; of intevention made the parent worse for a while.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-122923179">We are looking to buy another house.  For one thing, I can&#39;t take living in<br/>
the city anymore.  The second thing is that one bathroom and five people<br/>
plus all the &quot;orphans&quot; the kidlets bring home just doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
We were talking about it the other night and I said I only have three<br/>
criteria for the realtor to meet.  1)  Two or more bathrooms; 2) LAND and 3)<br/>
a REAL kitchen!  We currently have a weird wall for a kitchen compliments of<br/>
the old folks who remodeled this old house.<br/>
<br/>
Before I try and cook anything, I scurry around to find everything I need.<br/>
All the kidlets are as bad as hubby when it comes to putting things away.<br/>
The operative word is &quot;away,&quot; not where they belong.  Luckily with pots and<br/>
pans most of  then are hanging so they can&#39;t get too lost.  Everything else<br/>
is a treasure hunt!<br/>
<br/>
I want a REAL kitchen with a pantry and book shelves!  I have hundreds of<br/>
cookbooks (some from the 1800s) and no place to put them %-{<br/>
<br/>
Some of the cookbooks have kidlet momentos in them -- little batter<br/>
fingerprints from when they first learned how to cook.  We have pressed<br/>
flowers between the pages that they have collected and their &quot;math&quot; pages as<br/>
they learned about fractions and weights and measures as they cooked.<br/>
<br/>
It was a hoot when the mil from h*ll asked eldest son if he knew his<br/>
fractions and he told her, &quot;sure,&quot; with that &quot;like duh&quot; tone.  Then she<br/>
asked him (knowing I only had college math books in the house) how he was<br/>
learning fractions and he said Better Homes and Gardens &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504572318">This one is a big problem for me with Wyndham.  He is ten but he is <br/>
big for his age.  He can hurt little kids without meaning to.  He also <br/>
can get out of control quickly.  I feel like I&#39;m walking a tightrope <br/>
sometimes - between letting him be and keeping him safe and not out of <br/>
control/wild.  <br/>
<br/>
It was much easier with the girls.  I can weather dirty looks (because <br/>
I let them climb trees among other things) but with Wyndham I feel <br/>
like it is so much less safe to just let him go without watching very <br/>
carefully.  I feel like potential for him to get hurt or hurt someone <br/>
else is so much more there with him.<br/>
