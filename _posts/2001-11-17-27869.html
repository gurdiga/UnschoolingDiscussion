them everywhere, and anyone who looks after them even briefly knows how to <br/>
use it.  Their parents aren&#39;t so concerned about it that they keep them <br/>
away from bees completely.  They just make sure there&#39;s an<br/>

take responsibility for using them if needed.  (at least in this area)  So <br/>
all the kids in the class (and sometimes the whole school) are not allowed <br/>
to bring peanut anything to school.<br/>

carries an epi-pen or that the child is old enough to do so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-519591593">When I worked at my son&#39;s school lunch program a few years ago, there was a boy with a severe peanut allergy.  Just touching a wrapper with a small amount of peanuts on it (and I&#39;m talking very small here, like peanut dust) could be absorbed through his skin and cause an anaphylactic response.  He has to sit at a seperate table, the table had to be washed down with diluted bleach before and after each meal, every child who sat at that table had to have their lunches checked, and anything that might contain peanuts, or didn&#39;t have a complete list of ingredients had to be put away till after lunch.  The first time he&#39;d reacted to peanuts was when he picked up an empty Reese&#39;s wrapper, didn&#39;t put it in his mouth or anything, just touched it.  The peanut residue was absorbed through his hand.  This kind of severe allergy is very uncommon, but there is usually at least one child per group (like in a daycare or school population) who will have a food allergy similar to this, maybe not quite as bad, but still very life threatening.  This child had an epi-pen in the lunchroom, in the office, in every classroom he might go to, in the teacher&#39;s lounge.  When we were trained on the Epi-pen, we were told it would give us 10-15 minutes to get him to the hospital before he stopped breathing altogether.  Without the epi-pen, about 2 minutes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-925963583">The problem with that is that an epi-pen is not a cure, it&#39;s a stop-gap treatment.  At the most it can give maybe 20 minutes of time, usually more like 10 (depends on how much allergen was ingested or exposed.)  After it wears off, the reaction goes on as bad as before. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s quite easy to learn how to use an Epi-pen, most teachers don&#39;t want to be solely responsible for someone&#39;s life (and I can understand that.)  With nut allergies, the thinking is usually that  nuts are not a major part of anyone&#39;s diet, so for the non-allergic people, it&#39;s an inconvenience to have them banned, while for the allergic kids, it&#39;s potentially life-saving.  I didn&#39;t mind the peanut ban at daycare much, but then again, Owen doesn&#39;t like peanut butter, all it meant for me was cutting out the daily granola bar.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, some anaphylactic reactions are not as noticeable.  My neice has a severe allergy to bee and wasp stings.  She doesn&#39;t stop breathing, though.  Her blood pressure drops until her heart stops (very rare allergy, extremely dangerous.)  The first sign that she&#39;s reacting is that she gets tired and dopey.  Now that she&#39;s 11, she can tell us if she&#39;s been stung, but when she was younger, she couldn&#39;t always verbalize it.  If she had been at school when she had her first bad reaction, she might have just been sent to the office to call her parents, it doesn&#39;t look like a life threatening reaction at first.  Since peanut allergy reactions are so easily preventable, it makes sense to school boards just not to deal with them at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-7917527">Makes you wonder why parents would send their kids to school, knowing <br/>
what he had to go through.  All they would have had to do is provide <br/>
a nice, cozy home environment with no peanuts in it! <br/>
<br/>
There was a sad story I read a few months ago about a boy in a school <br/>
where a mom brought chocolate cookies in for the class.  This was an <br/>
older boy, who knew to not eat peanuts.  He never imagined that there <br/>
would be peanut butter in what looked like plain chocolate cookies.  <br/>
He ate a cookie and died. :(  There was another story around the same <br/>
time where a young boy was on a field trip and a chaperone gave him a <br/>
peanut butter cracker and he died.  :(<br/>

<br/>
Peanut and NSAID allergies are a bit different than most allergies.  Perhaps<br/>
folks would better understand these things if they thought of them as being<br/>
in three categories:  1) Sensitive to; 2) Allergic to; and 3) Severely<br/>
allergic to.<br/>
<br/>
Most food &quot;allergies&quot; are really sensitivities to foods.  One can live with<br/>
it and not really do too much to change one&#39;s environment.<br/>
<br/>
Category 2&#39;s must make changes and frequently must have epi-pens.<br/>
<br/>
Category 3s are immediately life threatening and the epi-pens only give you<br/>
a reprieve, hopefully long enough to get to a hospital.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is a Category 3 reactor, then you are presented with numerous<br/>
other problems the most important of which is the fact that you can&#39;t always<br/>
know that you have been exposed until it can be too late.<br/>
<br/>
With a bee string, for example, you generally know if you have been stung.<br/>
So your brain processes &quot;sting&quot; and then one goes for the epi-pen.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t know you have somehow ingested peanuts or NSAIDs, then you<br/>
don&#39;t have that window of opportunity to use that epi-pen when it is most<br/>
effective.<br/>
<br/>
Say you take your child to a park, the child runs around playing, climbs on<br/>
a table where another child has been that ate a peanut butter sandwich.  You<br/>
could be 25 yards away when your child suddenly drops to the ground and by<br/>
the time you get to the child it might be too late.<br/>
<br/>
I realise that Category 3s are, thankfully, relatively rare but they are a<br/>
fact of life.<br/>
<br/>
The only positive about the allergy and living in the US is that companies<br/>
must now clearly label their products if there is any chance peanuts might<br/>
be in the product OR if they use the same equipment to make something with<br/>
peanuts.  In other countries they mix up their oils and nothing is labeled.<br/>
<br/>
Also, most folks aren&#39;t aware of just how many things peanuts/peanut<br/>
oils/peanut fibers are in.  Here&#39;s a short list:  shampoo, face cream, hand<br/>
lotion, baby massage cream, cooking oil, vegetable oil, salad oil, medicine,<br/>
goiter treatment, laxatives, axel grease, hand cleaners (like mechanics<br/>
use), laundry soap, wood filler,  insecticide, insulated boards, Kraft<br/>
paper, glue, plastics, and the list goes on.<br/>
<br/>
As to moving where there aren&#39;t peanuts, well that leaves nowhere on earth.<br/>
Peanuts are a legume and they grow like a weed in almost any climate.  They<br/>
have been exported to all countries and now play a part in the cooking of<br/>
almost every ethnic group.  And, as you can see from the very short list<br/>
above, one simply can&#39;t escape the presence of the lowly peanut.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Somepeople with nut allergies can be so allergic that even breathing<br/>
&gt; &gt;in the scent of PB can send them to the hospital.  As for the park<br/>
&gt; &gt;question, picture a four year old eating a PB&J, sticking his hands<br/>
&gt; &gt;on the table or equipment, the allergic child then touches the<br/>
&gt; &gt;residue and viola, a trip to the ER.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know of kids with severe bee sting allergies.  Their epi-pen goes with<br/>
&gt; them everywhere, and anyone who looks after them even briefly knows how to<br/>
&gt; use it.  Their parents aren&#39;t so concerned about it that they keep them<br/>
&gt; away from bees completely.  They just make sure there&#39;s an<br/>
&gt; up-to-date epi-pen available.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now the problems with peanut allergies in schools (and some daycares)<br/>
stems<br/>
&gt; from the refusal of the teachers to learn how to use the epi-pens and then<br/>
&gt; take responsibility for using them if needed.  (at least in this area)  So<br/>
&gt; all the kids in the class (and sometimes the whole school) are not allowed<br/>
&gt; to bring peanut anything to school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think the example of the park bench or equipment and peanut fumes might<br/>
&gt; be a little overstated.  I&#39;m assuming the parent or responsible adult<br/>
&gt; carries an epi-pen or that the child is old enough to do so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003704632">The organic group up here, the Sierra Club, the CA organic growers<br/>
association, one of the pediatrics groups and dozens of others are currently<br/>
trying to get all GMOs labeled because of this possibility.<br/>
<br/>
Now, sit down for this one!!!  One of the idiots with the frontal lobatomies<br/>
(otherwise known as congress boobs) said that there was so little chance of<br/>
this happening or it being deadly that they didn&#39;t think it was worth the<br/>
money it would cost the companies to print the labels.  THE EXACT same<br/>
speech that was made 20 or so years ago about candy.<br/>
<br/>
It took the deaths of several children and a major lawsuit to get the<br/>
labeling.  I guess we are back to the same old &quot;collateral&quot; damages<br/>
nonsense!  Good heavens, after all, what&#39;s the death of a child or two<br/>
compared to the profit margin for Monsanto!<br/>

&gt; But will they label if something has peanut genes?  I remember that this<br/>
&gt; was one instance where people were adamant about labeling of genetically<br/>
&gt; engineered products.  A potato with peanut genes could produce the<br/>
reaction<br/>
&gt; too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have a young girl in park day group who is allergic to peanuts.  No one<br/>
&gt; in the group brings any type of nut product to the park in order to keep<br/>
&gt; her a bit safer.  And thank god her parents decided to homeschool her.<br/>
