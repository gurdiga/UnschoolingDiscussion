<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure how I cope. Sometimes, I might not really cope, but sort of<br/>
muddle through??  I know that I mothered intensely for a number of years. I<br/>
have a child that was molested that needed lots and lots of me.  Then I had<br/>
3 children in 4 years and I had all I could do to keep them clean and fed.<br/>
Now I have healthy, happy kids, all of whom are busy living and learning and<br/>
flowing around me.  But after all the diapers were done and everyone could<br/>
get food for themselves life changed. I had a bit more time just for myself<br/>
and I laid claim to it with passion.<br/>
<br/>
My dad and stepmom and mil have all voiced disapproval and dismay. They<br/>
don&#39;t understand a great many of our choices. I spent time trying to help<br/>
them see from our perspective, but they really were not interested in<br/>
understanding, only in controlling.  Sadly, we&#39;ve had to limit our time and<br/>
efforts with them.  Life is too short to deal with the same issue over and<br/>
over.<br/>
<br/>
Loneliness has cropped up for me. My circle of friends has been small, but I<br/>
must say this year has brought many interesting people into my life.  And<br/>
that&#39;s where I focus. I work at making these new friendships.  I refused to<br/>
get sucked into spending my time with people who drain me.<br/>
<br/>
I think another thing I do is just talk honestly that it&#39;s hard to always be<br/>
odd man out and I would like to be accepted for just being me.  Many times<br/>
those naysayers hear the underlying plea to let matters of difference lie.<br/>
We focus on just being ourselves together, rather than all of us being<br/>
alike.  It gives them room to acknowledge the places they are indeed<br/>
different too. It&#39;s hard work though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading this thread off and on over the last few days.<br/>
What Lisa stated rang true for me.<br/>
I had very few adult friends to start with and when we started to have a<br/>
family others we knew put theirs into daycare.....heck even my mil and<br/>
mom we&#39;re pushing me to do that and find work....mind you their idea of<br/>
daycare was to assume it would be them doing the daycare and shutting<br/>
out the *other* grandma. <br/>
When we decided on HSing....we let them know about our decision after<br/>
the fact......we weren&#39;t going to let them have any control, these were<br/>
OUR children not theirs. They we&#39;re entitled to an opinion and give<br/>
advice but had to learn that when you give advice that doesn&#39;t mean your<br/>
adult child is automaticly coing to take it.<br/>
<br/>
When HSing became a real thing in regards to the moms I had made friends<br/>
with at our neighbourhood school....I became invisible in the<br/>
neighbourhood....shunned or politely but extremely casually<br/>
acknowledged,when met in public like at the park or the library or at<br/>
Brownies and Cub Scouts. My kids we&#39;re not welcome to talk with their<br/>
kids especialy if Hsing was brought up.<br/>
<br/>
I too have decided to avoid or at least limit my time with those who<br/>
drain me and/or my family emotionaly (and that includes the<br/>
grandparents) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had Nathan and Samantha 18 months apart.<br/>
It was a lot like having twins except I had 6 months extra of diaper<br/>
duty. If I&#39;d had them further apart they wouldn&#39;t have overlapped with<br/>
diaper duty and I would have had an extra two years and I ended up<br/>
nursing for three years instead of 4....I sort of *tandem nursed* &#39;cause<br/>
I nursed Nathan while pregnant with Sam.<br/>
<br/>
We tried sooo long to have Nathan after Katie (4 1/4 yrs apart). We had<br/>
some infertility problems on my part...kind of hard to get preggers when<br/>
you only ovulate once every three or four months ;-)<br/>
I was thought to be selfish and irresponsible to have *let* it happen.<br/>
My sister and brother we&#39;re both planning second children (My sister<br/>
already preggers with #2) but I already had two and aparently was<br/>
considered to have showed poor judgement by having a third. I was<br/>
laughed laughed and sneered at because they all thought I&#39;d used nursing<br/>
as birth control....I wasn&#39;t nursing to prevent conception and the pill<br/>
wasn&#39;t an option and latex I have an alergic reaction to.<br/>
But Sam is a delight even if her grandparents don&#39;t appreciate her an<br/>
aknowledge her as is appropriate.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i agree because it -unschooling- would be even better when the whole family<br/>
unschools side by side - the more the merrier:)  here&#39;s a good quote from<br/>
grace llewelyn about the multi-dimensional aspects of unschooling:<br/>
<br/>
&#39;it feels important to me to be in touch with my own process of unschooling<br/>
because, in order for people to contribute to the larger good, they need to be<br/>
self-fulfilled.   as i work to fulfill my own talents, my dreams, i see that i<br/>
can also help people active their own dreams.   i wonder what i&#39;m here for,<br/>
and i try to make sure that i&#39;m not being &#39;should&#39; driven.<br/>
<br/>
it feels important to my work that i not be a hypocrite.   in a larger sense,<br/>
i encourage people to get out of their ruts, or institutions, that are not<br/>
serving them, where they feel dead.<br/>
<br/>
i feel that i&#39;m much more helpful to my audience when i&#39;m self-sparked and<br/>
happy.<br/>
<br/>
the more i learn about life from myself, the more i see how unschooling, or<br/>
any meaningful path of learning, is not something that you can really confine<br/>
to academia, certainly not to the systems of school as we know them.   so i<br/>
would encourage people to ask themselves how they are limiting themselves, how<br/>
they limit their own ideas about what they or their kids could and should be<br/>
learning and growing - all that&#39;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I actually love some of the heated philosophical discussions that I have<br/>
&gt; with my parents and<br/>
&gt; sibling. These discussions help us all understand each other. And , if I<br/>
&gt; remain open and accepting of the discussion I can really learn a lot and be<br/>
&gt; a more critical thinker about where our learing is going.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I know that a lot of their questions come from a place of love. They ask<br/>
&gt; the questions because they love the girls and their own experience was<br/>
&gt; school. And it worked for them. They were  very interesting, loving<br/>
&gt; teachers and I know that they were  well-loved by their students. However,<br/>
&gt; it is only natural that they question our choice...it is a foreign world to<br/>
&gt; them and they want answers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i think that bringing in the whole family by keeping these lines open (via<br/>
discussion etc.) is very much in keeping with the spirit of this quote.<br/>
though there are unfortunately situation where these path need to be closed<br/>
but whenever it is possible.   i believe that if members of the extended<br/>
family are included everyone grows and stays &#39;in touch&#39; with their &#39;own<br/>
process of unschooling&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The answers take time to show themselves. But<br/>
&gt; it is happening...the girls are so solid, so empathetic, so spirited.<br/>
&gt; My mom and dad are now hard-core believers in home education. They are so<br/>
&gt; proud of us all... especially little me (blush).  They know how hard we<br/>
&gt; worked at the beginning to get our home-learning dream off the ground and<br/>
&gt; the fruits of our labours are very evident now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my mother had mixed feeling about homeschooling and my sister homeschooled<br/>
without really telling her (starting with her son at 14 but kept her dd in<br/>
school for 2 more years - 8 yr. spread between them).  when i had rene&#39; i told<br/>
my mother to plan on us homeschooling (she doesn&#39;t argue with me because she<br/>
knows i will not back down and if she pushes i will just stop talk to her -<br/>
one of the nice things about having a chronic illness you just don&#39;t have the<br/>
energy or patience for the bs) within about 6 months she was telling my sister<br/>
to homeschool and now thinks kids are much better off being homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
my in-laws are a bit different.  they are ps believers.  fil just retired from<br/>
teaching math in ps for 35 yrs and mil was a ps librarian  but now is a<br/>
librarian at a public lib.  both sil&#39;s are ardent supporters of ps,  one<br/>
thinks rene&#39; &#39;knows too much&#39;  and that i should not &#39;teach&#39; him so much<br/>
because society doesn&#39;t like people who are &#39;too&#39; smart (everything he knows<br/>
is of his own doing not mine - i&#39;ve never &#39;taught&#39; him anything i just answer<br/>
all his questions).  talk about dumping down!  but we stand firm and i hope<br/>
when they see that he is happy, self-confident and fulfilled and that just<br/>
because he knows lots of things doesn&#39;t mean he has to be a social pariah.<br/>
maybe she too will at least accept what we are doing, even if her family makes<br/>
a different choice.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; It makes me sad that so many of you don&#39;t have strong support from your<br/>
&gt; families. I don&#39;t think that there is an easy solution but I think that<br/>
&gt; time tells the tale. If the grandparent or other nay-sayers really love<br/>
&gt; your children are they not able to see how loved they are??? Home schooling<br/>
&gt; our children takes our devotion and time and love.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>support is a great thing, where ever it comes from, but from ones own family<br/>
it really feels good.  it&#39;s like fertilizer, but if you don&#39;t find it from<br/>
those who you think &#39;should&#39; give it to you you need to find it within<br/>
yourself and stand firm in your decisions.  doubter only distract you from all<br/>
the joy that is there to be had.  i think the saddest part about unsupportive<br/>
family members is the loss of relationship and if people would accept the<br/>
differences we each have life would be much more wonderful than it already is.<br/>

expecting our third, but my husbands folks were just hateful.  His mother <br/>
actually said, &quot;How could you do this to me???&quot;, and took to her bed for <br/>
several weeks!!!  His dad said he couldn&#39;t believe that DH was stupid enough <br/>

quickly after they realized that they were going to find themselves the proud <br/>
grandparents of exactly ZERO grandchildren if they kept it up.  Now they are <br/>
absolutely nuts about Josie and think she&#39;s the cat&#39;s pajamas.  They pretty <br/>
much keep out of our decisions about the kids.  MY mom, on the other hand, <br/>
makes no secret of her disdain for our decision to homeschool.  She&#39;s <br/>
outspoken about how we&#39;re fouling up the children&#39;s lives.  Everytime I have <br/>
a lupus flare her first reaction is, &quot;You WILL put those children in school <br/>
where they belong now, I hope&quot;, or &quot;how is this affecting your children&#39;s <br/>
education?&quot;  (this is met with stony silence on my part).  I just can&#39;t be <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is very sad that you must deal with unsupportive family. <br/>
<br/>
My parents were teachers (my dad was a chemistry prof, mom taught<br/>
elementary) and my sister is a teacher in a private school in Vermont.<br/>
At first they were worried (I translated that as a normal response...heck!<br/>
I had it too in the beginning) so I inundated them with every wonderful<br/>
article and book that I found regarding family-centred learning  and<br/>
home-schooling. We had many &#39;discussions&#39; and it took time for them to<br/>
totally accept our choice. But I kept reminding them that the bottom line<br/>
for us was that the girls were loved and nurtured in a stimulating and<br/>
encouraging way. We love learning, we love books and we love our children!<br/>
A perfect mix...and the proof is in the pudding as they have grown into<br/>
self-motivated learners (they are 11 and 9). <br/>
<br/>
Mom still phones once in a while and says, &quot;Do the girls keep a journal?<br/>
Did the girls do math today? &quot; but ...these types of questions are becoming<br/>
fewer and fewer as time goes on and they see how balanced we are in our<br/>
approach.  I always laugh when my mom phones and says these things (and<br/>
remind her that she needs to come and visit soon!!!). I actually love some<br/>
of the heated philosophical discussions that I have with my parents and<br/>
sibling. These discussions help us all understand each other. And , if I<br/>
remain open and accepting of the discussion I can really learn a lot and be<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610881626">hi there...<br/>
We are in Nelson area..up the lake actually near the Kokanee Glacier<br/>
provincial park. We have a great support group here and have joined CHEA<br/>
(Can. Home Educ. Assoc). The president of that organization is in Penticton. <br/>
We (Kootenay Home Educators)  have a newsletter as well (which I edit) and<br/>
have lots of get-togethers. There are 70 families that get the newsletter. <br/>
<br/>
We have home educated from the beginning and so the girls have never been<br/>
to school.  They are now 9 and 11. It has been an interesting journey...<br/>
I think that Deb (Buzz) is from BC too. But I could be wrong. Hey<br/>
buzz...are you there. ???<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the way to go and I am really enjoying the journey. I have<br/>
used curriculum and even had us enrolled in a Distance Ed. program one year<br/>
but none of us enjoyed it. This year has been the best...and we owe it to<br/>
our more relaxed and trusting approach with unschooling. <br/>
Keep in touch...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445020146">Dear Buzz,<br/>
                Thanks so much for your words of encouragment. I know in my<br/>
heart that I&#39;m doing the right thing, but some days it gets so frustrating I<br/>
just want to cry (not that we don&#39;t all have those days). We just seem to be<br/>
in a rough spot right now. My oldest (7 yr. dd) is even telling me she wants<br/>
to go back to school and dh thinks it might not be a bad idea. &lt;big sigh&gt;. I<br/>
fought so hard for him to let me do this, I&#39;d hate to have to admit I was<br/>
wrong (God forbid I should do that. LOL) It is true though that the 2<br/>
younger was still demand so much of my time and we won&#39;t even talk about the<br/>
state of my house right now. Oh well, this too will pass, right? Sorry to be<br/>
going on so long, but I&#39;ve got a lot on my mind.<br/>
Amy<br/>
PS Sorry if you&#39;re getting all my posts twice. Ican&#39;t seem to fix that.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Amy Worthen<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not Brooke but I&#39;ll tell you my POV.<br/>
&gt; I was worried sick about HSing....not that I couldn&#39;t handle it in<br/>
&gt; itself but handling the pressures that would follow from friends family<br/>
&gt; and neighbours etc.<br/>
&gt; I got beyond it by affirming to myself....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1...Teachers don&#39;t love my kids or have their best interests truly at<br/>
&gt; heart, how can they when they only have them for 1 year/grade and must<br/>
&gt; split their time between 20+ kids.<br/>
&gt; 2...This isn&#39;t a life time commitment. I can re-enroll my children at<br/>
&gt; any given time.<br/>
&gt; 3...if in the worst case scenario they don&#39;t thrive under my tuteledge I<br/>
&gt; can ask for help from others with more expertise (either someone in the<br/>
&gt; flesh or online help/tutouring)<br/>
&gt; 4...my kids will always be able to work at their own pace and their own<br/>
&gt; daily timetable (they might do math better at 8pm instead of 9 am).<br/>
&gt; 5...if their own genuine learning speed is too slow for society<br/>
&gt; (grandparents etc) then it would also be too slow for the PS system and<br/>
&gt; therefore my kid needs the one on one of HSing.<br/>
&gt; 6...if my kid is learning at lightspeed the PS wouldn&#39;t be able to<br/>
&gt; accomodate them and they would be better off with one on one HSing.<br/>
&gt; 7..my kids can do a GED and take courses to meet entry requirements as<br/>
&gt; mature students when they reach 19 yrs...some colleges reserve placement<br/>
&gt; spots specificly for mature students....which means they may have an<br/>
&gt; advatage in getting a placement, and who says they have to enter college<br/>
&gt; at 18 anyways?<br/>
&gt; 8....philisophical/topical discussions are based on how long the child<br/>
&gt; wants to discuss them not on when the bell rings and stops it because<br/>
&gt; you have to go to the next class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ohhhh somebody stop me I could go on and on and on!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327602807">Hi Amy, <br/>
<br/>
I loved Buzz&#39; response. Ditto there. <br/>
<br/>
In retrospect , I think that being worried when you are starting something<br/>
new is pretty healthy. After all, worry comes from caring and wanting to do<br/>
the right thing. In the case of our children, I think worry comes part and<br/>
parcel with the job of parenting. We want to make sure that we are not<br/>
&#39;missing&#39; a piece of the learning pie. We don&#39;t want to mess up so we worry. <br/>
<br/>
Time will help. Reading a lot about home education will help (there were<br/>
few histories written about homelearning familes when I started but there<br/>
is a proliferation now!). But the most important thing is to have your own<br/>
person mantra to remind yourself to accept how you feel as normal. Any new<br/>
job, any new relationship of merit  will cause you to worry and think...&quot;am<br/>
I doing the right thing? am I doing too much? am I doing too little? what<br/>
if it doesn&#39;t work out?&quot; Things are no different with homelearning, but<br/>
personally, after what I have seen in our family, it is only a win-win<br/>
situation. There are ups-and-downs-and-in-betweens in the beginning just<br/>
like any new job . But things settle down over the years and the<br/>
being/learning together becomes second nature.  The secret is to let go and<br/>
accept your &#39;stage&#39; of your &#39;new job&#39;. Remember that &quot;this too will pass&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
If you have done a thorough job of convincing your family that this is the<br/>
right thing I would assume that you know the pros of homelearning. I think<br/>
that you need to listen to the messages that you gave them. I kept a<br/>
journal at the beginning and write down all the incredible learning moments<br/>
, especially those where I was a spectator or facilitator. I would reread<br/>
these and they  would buoy me up on the days where the self-doubt would nag<br/>
the loudest. But time was the ultimate salve for me. <br/>
<br/>
Why does your daughter want to go back to school? Maybe she is worried<br/>
too!!! This may be a place for you to sit down and have a private talk to<br/>
find out what her worries are...some of them may be the same as yours. <br/>
You could use this as an opportunity to share your fears and move beyond<br/>
them. <br/>
<br/>
Tell us how things are going and send more specific questions. We will try<br/>
to help you through this period. <br/>
I would say that most of us have been there...you are not alone.<br/>
<br/>
Big hugs from <br/>

&gt;             You wrote that in the begining you were worried yourself about<br/>
&gt; homeschooling. What got you beyond this? I too am very worried. Probably<br/>
&gt; more than I&#39;m willing to admit. I&#39;ve spent so much time convincing everyone<br/>
&gt; from dh to mil to my mom that this is the best thing, but I&#39;m not so sure<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve convinced myself. Any pointers would be great.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not Brooke but I&#39;ll tell you my POV.<br/>
I was worried sick about HSing....not that I couldn&#39;t handle it in<br/>
itself but handling the pressures that would follow from friends family<br/>
and neighbours etc.<br/>
I got beyond it by affirming to myself....<br/>
<br/>
1...Teachers don&#39;t love my kids or have their best interests truly at<br/>
heart, how can they when they only have them for 1 year/grade and must<br/>
split their time between 20+ kids.<br/>
2...This isn&#39;t a life time commitment. I can re-enroll my children at<br/>
any given time.<br/>
3...if in the worst case scenario they don&#39;t thrive under my tuteledge I<br/>
can ask for help from others with more expertise (either someone in the<br/>
flesh or online help/tutouring)<br/>
4...my kids will always be able to work at their own pace and their own<br/>
daily timetable (they might do math better at 8pm instead of 9 am).<br/>
5...if their own genuine learning speed is too slow for society<br/>
(grandparents etc) then it would also be too slow for the PS system and<br/>
therefore my kid needs the one on one of HSing.<br/>
6...if my kid is learning at lightspeed the PS wouldn&#39;t be able to<br/>
accomodate them and they would be better off with one on one HSing.<br/>
7..my kids can do a GED and take courses to meet entry requirements as<br/>
mature students when they reach 19 yrs...some colleges reserve placement<br/>
spots specificly for mature students....which means they may have an<br/>
advatage in getting a placement, and who says they have to enter college<br/>
at 18 anyways?<br/>
8....philisophical/topical discussions are based on how long the child<br/>
wants to discuss them not on when the bell rings and stops it because<br/>
you have to go to the next class. <br/>
<br/>
Ohhhh somebody stop me I could go on and on and on!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-820389597">Buzz, THis is so well put.  I&#39;m going to save it to read on my doubt<br/>
days.  I have them too!!<br/>
My biggest plus I think is the closeness I share with my children.  I<br/>
get to so and share in all their discoveries in life.  Their ups and<br/>
downs...  I love that.<br/>
Last night the kids made dinner.  What fun.  They made spanakopita.<br/>
(wonder if I spelled that right)  Then they made fruit salad.  They even<br/>
set the table, and had me get out the china.  It was lots of fun.  I<br/>
just finished cleaning up today.  Yes, it was a major mess.  But, if you<br/>
could have seen my 7 yr olds face while cooking, and while eating what<br/>
he had made....  It was so worth the mess.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been at this 3 yrs after pulling them in grades 1 and kindergarten<br/>
and I still have the odd sleepless night over it.<br/>
I also do not wanting my kids to grow apart from each other. I know so<br/>
many kids from their old school who unmercifuly bully or shut out their<br/>
siblings. Its almost as if they feel they can&#39;t be friends with their<br/>
sibs because of the peer influence at school that only lets one play<br/>
with kids in your own grade....no playing with the *babies* syndrome.<br/>
Those kids also seem to expect to be bullied by older children and<br/>
accept it as a fact of life....sad :-(<br/>
<br/>
My kids have become sooo much closer and it was really easy to see a<br/>
change in their relationship within the first 6 months but even easier<br/>
to see now in the third year.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935996878">Hi Tracy,<br/>
I too worried about &quot;spending that much time with my children&quot; but two<br/>
things helped to clarify my views : a) if I don&#39;t want to spend time with my<br/>
children, why not? Are they not the kind of people I enjoy being with and if<br/>
not, can I help them become that type of person? and b) If I, who love them<br/>
so desperately do not want to spend time with them, who the hell else<br/>
will???<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
