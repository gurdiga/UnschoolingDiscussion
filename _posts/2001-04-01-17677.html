<div><font face="Arial" size="2">A dear friend of mine lost a cat recently because 
he wasn&#39;t in the house (her brother let&nbsp;him out.)&nbsp; He would always 
come home with serious wounds from what we don&#39;t know. Now he&#39;s dead (hit by a 
car) and she&#39;s broken-hearted.&nbsp; So is it&nbsp;the right thing to keep him 
safely in the house with the other cats or let him&nbsp;do what he wanted 
and&nbsp;get hurt and killed?&nbsp; (Kinda sounds a <em>little </em>like 
parenting, but they are her babies after all.)-Collette&nbsp; </font></div>

Why don&#39;t we?<br/>
<br/>
Why do we let our kids get into cars, ride bikes, climb trees?<br/>
<br/>
Something about their natural development and the world being a worthy risk.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I started loving the presence of a cat so much that I totally deprived <br/>
that cat of walking on the earth outside, I&#39;d worry about my priorities.  But <br/>
then I&#39;ve never lived in an apartment or on a super-busy street.  I&#39;ve always <br/>
been able to offer cats (usually stray) a warm place and some companionship, <br/>
food and water (water being the big thing in New Mexico where it&#39;s not <br/>
naturally occuring except in the river and some mountain lakes) in exchange <br/>
for some companionship, entertainment, and mouse control.<br/>
<br/>
In New Mexico, and near my house even, there are mice which carry bubonic <br/>
plague.  I&#39;d rather have a series of short-lived cats than any short-lived <br/>
child.  But in fact we&#39;ve had most of our cats live with us to old age.  A <br/>
couple have been hit by cars (of a dozen cats over the years), two died of <br/>
kitty leukemia,  but the rest stayed. Four are here now.  They have a door, <br/>
they&#39;re usually inside.<br/>

That would depend on if you view children and animals as comparable in this <br/>
matter, I don&#39;t.  However, for the sake of argument, if my cat can learn to <br/>
stay out of the street, let me know where she is going, avoid bullies AND not <br/>
bring fleas back into the house I might reconsider my position.  Since she <br/>
has even less intelligence than my 3 yo who  never goes outside without <br/>
supervision I don&#39;t think it&#39;s gonna happen.  I don&#39;t keep her inside because <br/>
I can&#39;t bear the thought of anything happening to her.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s <br/>
right for the wildlife nor responsible, every vet I&#39;ve spoken to has said <br/>
they are better off inside.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-878062048">I don&#39;t agree with that.  I have had cats all my life.  When at home, my <br/>
mother allowed our cats to go outside and none of them lived past 5 yo.  I <br/>
now have 6 cats who live in my house.  The majority of the time they spend <br/>
interacting with us.  I rarely see them look out the window and only one of <br/>
our cats has any desire to go outside.  When he does, he sits on the porch <br/>
for three minutes and cries to come back in.  He got out one night, several <br/>
years ago, and we didn&#39;t hear from him until 5:00 am the next morning when <br/>
he was at the door whining to get in.  Since then, he won&#39;t venture off the <br/>
porch.  Doesn&#39;t sound like he misses being outside.<br/>

where cats roam freely. So in some ways cats are<br/>
invasisve species like some weeds/plants that are not<br/>
native to an area: Starling birds push out other<br/>
birds, scotch broom and I think french broom can take<br/>
over hill sides in California, Japanese knotweed in<br/>

We have a real good program locally (and in several other CA counties) where<br/>
they go out and trap the feral cats and neuter them.  The wild population is<br/>
deminishing relatively quickly.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s my feeling too.  And they&#39;re LOTS smarter<br/>
&gt; &gt; than three year old humans,<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the purposes of being out in the world.  They&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; adults of their species<br/>
&gt; &gt; within a year, and are stronger than we are and<br/>
&gt; &gt; faster than we are, they have<br/>
&gt; &gt; claws and teeth for a reason.  (Besides tearing up<br/>
&gt; &gt; couches sometimes.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree BUT bird populations are severely diminisheed<br/>
&gt; where cats roam freely. So in some ways cats are<br/>
&gt; invasisve species like some weeds/plants that are not<br/>
&gt; native to an area: Starling birds push out other<br/>
&gt; birds, scotch broom and I think french broom can take<br/>
&gt; over hill sides in California, Japanese knotweed in<br/>
&gt; Washington, blackberries etc....<br/>

Cats ALWAYS look bored!  LOL  I see the same look on the cats outside.  <br/>
Instead of being in the window they sit in the driveway with the same &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
about the fall asleep&quot; look on their face.  The only time I see any action is <br/>
when they&#39;re fighting with cats who enter their space.<br/>

In complete agreement, we had our cat spayed even though she doesn&#39;t go <br/>
outside.  We didn&#39;t want to take the chance AND she made us all miserable <br/>
when she was in heat<br/>

time observing the wildlife around her home said she<br/>
observed a huge drop in the bird population wwhen she<br/>
got a neighbor who let her cat outside. So I don&#39;t<br/>
think it just feral cat population although dealing<br/>
with it is one step.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree Lynda. We&#39;ve only had two cats in my life. The first lived 19 years<br/>
and was an outdoor cat his entire life (earlier in our rural home, but later<br/>
on in my mom&#39;s apartment complex, a cabin in the woods, and a house). Our<br/>
2nd cat is now 8 and is an outdoor cat. We live on a cul-de-sac off of a<br/>
dead-end road so cars aren&#39;t really a factor (for him or for our kids, thank<br/>
God). I suppose he has to worry about predation some, but that&#39;s the normal<br/>
course of life. In any case, since he can&#39;t bear to spend a night outside<br/>
and away from our family bed, he&#39;s safe from the nocturnal predators at<br/>
least :-). He&#39;d be miserable if we kept him locked up inside and he&#39;s always<br/>
free to choose to come home to us.<br/>
Our animals have very active social lives as there are 7 cats and 3 dogs<br/>
that are all outdoors in our cul-de-sac and they somehow all manage to get<br/>
along.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t agree with that.  I have had cats all my life.  When at home, my <br/>
 mother allowed our cats to go outside and none of them lived past 5 yo.  I <br/>
 now have 6 cats who live in my house.  The majority of the time they spend <br/>
 interacting with us.  I rarely see them look out the window and only one of <br/>
 our cats has any desire to go outside.  When he does, he sits on the porch <br/>
 for three minutes and cries to come back in.  He got out one night, several <br/>
 years ago, and we didn&#39;t hear from him until 5:00 am the next morning when <br/>
 he was at the door whining to get in.  Since then, he won&#39;t venture off the <br/>
 porch.  Doesn&#39;t sound like he misses being outside.<br/>
 <br/>

Sounds like our cat.  She does sit in the window but it&#39;s because she likes <br/>
to watch the birds and act all brave by growling at other cats.  One time she <br/>
got out and I found her cowering between the wall and a piece of wood trying <br/>
to hide from them.<br/>
<br/>
Another time she got out on a day we were sitting outside.  What did she do?  <br/>
She came and sat by us.  Now we open the window which is right on our porch, <br/>
she sits by us in the window and we&#39;re close enough to stick a finger through <br/>
a hole and give her a scratch.<br/>
<br/>
The cat who lives next door considers the perimeter of our building part of <br/>
his territory and Cheety is half his size.  None of the cats in the <br/>
neighborhood even DARE to come near this bully.<br/>
