<div id="ygrps-yiv-430517387"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Here&#39;s a situation I&#39;d like to see how unschooling would apply.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling doesn&#39;t directly apply to braces (or eating habits or bedtimes),<br/>
but once you start to think that children are both capable and entitled to<br/>
direct their own education, that thinking tends to leak over into other<br/>
areas of family life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Your child needs braces, not because of major tooth misalignment, but<br/>
&gt; because of a hidden jaw alignment that, if not corrected, will<br/>
&gt; develop into TMJ in later life. His smile looks fine, his teeth are<br/>
&gt; straight and white...but there is a flaw in his bite that will lead<br/>
&gt; to health probs down the road. He doesn&#39;t want braces. He dislikes<br/>
&gt; how they look on people and thinks they would be too painful, esp.<br/>
&gt; when he can&#39;t see anything wrong with how he looks and no one is<br/>
&gt; teasing him about crooked teeth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you have him fitted with braces, anyway?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How certain is it that TMJ *will* develop later in life? Is it really that<br/>
predictable, or is it &quot;can&quot; develop? How much later in life? His 20s? 40s?<br/>
<br/>
If it was an absolute this-will-happen-by-the-time-he&#39;s-22 vs. a<br/>
this-might-happen-when-he&#39;s-50 it would affect how urgently I would feel the<br/>
need to go against his stated wishes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, your child begins to find an interest in higher learning at<br/>
&gt; about age 17...he is nearly at the end of his high school years<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>snip<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But lack of planning in his earlier years has left<br/>
&gt; him with FEWER OPTIONS than he would have had, if there&#39;d been some<br/>
&gt; structure and some pushing back there. A child may not know himself<br/>
&gt; well enough to realize that formal education is something he wants to<br/>
&gt; do...MAY not? I&#39;d venture, he WON&#39;T know himself well enough.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What say ye?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if he discovered at 17 an urge to become an olympic gymnast? Oh no!<br/>
Left too late now, he&#39;ll never make it.<br/>
<br/>
What if I discovered last year (at 35) that what I really wanted to do was<br/>
become a steeplechase jockey? Whoops! Too late to start a career.<br/>
<br/>
College prep at 17 is a slam-dunk in comparison. Heck, college-prep at 35<br/>
would be  slam-dunk in comparison!<br/>
<br/>
He could work his way through, as you said. He could do his college prep for<br/>
a year or two from home and then apply. He could attend junior college and<br/>
get an AA degree and then transfer. He could try qualifying for scholarships<br/>
(how many of those have an age limit? All scholarships? Some? What age?) He<br/>
could get military aid, or family help.<br/>
<br/>
17 is not the magic age where all humans must decide what they are going to<br/>
do for the rest of their lives. If it were, I&#39;d be an accountant today.<br/>
Instead, I&#39;ve been an accountant, dog trainer, and now bookseller. Sometime<br/>
I might be something else for a career. I don&#39;t feel I&#39;m limited just<br/>
because I&#39;m 36.<br/>
