So as part of your elimination, maybe you could opt to do without rather <br/>

<br/>
For example, as kids we were gluttons for bread with butter. So when <br/>
butter was obviously not a great choice as an adult, I try to dip my <br/>
bread in olive oil (flavoured at times) when I have bread. It was my <br/>
choice as opposed to going to some form of soy butter which _I_ found <br/>
repulsive.<br/>
<br/>
When the kid was young, he went from breastmilk to rice milk and that was <br/>
great. Its sweet and its not dairy.<br/>
<br/>
Tropical Source makes some great dairy free chocolate chips. I just made <br/>
cookies with them last night, and instead of butter, we used organic <br/>
shortening. (As a side note, this was not by choice, guything (dg?) <br/>
bought the chips at WholeFoods, he grabbed dairy-free, and I ran out of <br/>
butter). They turned out great (hint, use 1/2 expresso chips and 1/2 <br/>
semi-sweet chips, follow *almost* the entire Nestle Tollhouse recipe, use <br/>
organic ingredients. The sugar was dehydrated cane and I just added some <br/>
molasses to make up for the lack of organic brown sugar)<br/>
<br/>
The cheese part is a tough one. I haven&#39;t tried any of the soy cheeses <br/>
but I know they exist. Although you may not want to introduce soy as a <br/>
milk substitute until after you&#39;ve eliminated milk long enough to know <br/>
your not replacing one *reaction* with another.<br/>
<br/>
Debbie, good luck with the elimination. I know its a hard road to climb <br/>
since it takes a lot of time and energy to keep track of it all.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137633516">Kolleen,<br/>
Thanks for all the great tips. I&#39;m taking note of them. I don&#39;t think I ever had trouble with dairy foods, but in the last few years I have tried soy milk and now that is all I drink. Regular (skim) milk that we were drinking is now not appealing to me. Soy just seems so much &quot;cleaner&quot; (for lack of a better term). No filmy consistency that regular milk has. My son used to eat sherbet but really doesn&#39;t want that either. Just fatty ol ice cream. I&#39;m trying out other things just to keep him from feeling too deprived. If he won&#39;t try them, fine.<br/>
The things we do for our kids.... : )<br/>
What I am really trying to figure out is why there are so many kids diagnosed with ADHD anymore. What has changed in our society to bring this on? Worse eating habits? Environmental toxins? I don&#39;t know. Did we just not have the solution to the problem years ago? Too much medicating whatever ails us seems to be a contributing issue.<br/>
Ok, well, I&#39;m getting off topic I suppose.<br/>

there but most people are already exposed to nuts.  Anyway, I really <br/>
think they taste good, as opposed to the soy cheeses which taste like <br/>
they are trying to imitate but not quite making it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519067378">Be careful when you are looking into alternates for cheeses. Unless you are<br/>
buying a cheese that specifically states it is vegan (ie:vegan rella most<br/>
products by Tofutti, Soy Mage)you will most likely be getting casein in your<br/>
cheese which is a milk protein. It is what makes the soy cheeses &quot;melt&quot;.<br/>
Vegan soy cheeses are a lot different than that. Also, I will say, that once<br/>
you break from cheese, and this is coming from a former cheese freak, you<br/>
just don&#39;t care for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-228807397">I was fairly active on this list a while back, so I wanted to say before I<br/>
unsubscribe that I&#39;m leaving because I was recently diagnosed with breast<br/>
cancer and am finding it hard to keep up with everything while I decide<br/>
about treatment. (I haven&#39;t read any messages on this list for a couple of<br/>
weeks.)<br/>
<br/>
Effective immediately, I won&#39;t see anything posted to this list. So if<br/>
anyone wants to contact me, you&#39;ll have to do so through my email address,<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ElsaHaas@...">ElsaHaas@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m almost done with an early draft of a book on my experiences in<br/>
attachment parenting, unschooling and baby sign language (illustrated poems,<br/>
journal entries, how-to section and resource list). I had planned to<br/>
self-publish it, but that seems like too much work in my current state.<br/>
Instead, I&#39;m going to be looking for a publisher, so if you have any ideas<br/>
please email me (again, email me - please do not post to the list because I<br/>
won&#39;t see it).<br/>
<br/>
I would also welcome any thoughtful (not &quot;I have the 100% guaranteed cure<br/>
for cancer so just send me your money&quot;-type) suggestions on treatment.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck in your unschooling adventures and so long for now,<br/>
