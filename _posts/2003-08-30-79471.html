<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085185466">We got back from South Carolina (to Massachusetts) late last night, and I <br/>
wanted to share a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Julian and I had an amazing time together. First, the conference was great, <br/>
and I want to thank everyone who chatted with my shy boy. It&#39;s hard to tell <br/>
Julian is shy sometimes. He is easy to engage in conversation (especially for <br/>
adults), he comfortably gets up in front of people and sings...but it&#39;s hard for <br/>
him to initiate conversation.<br/>
<br/>
We left on Monday and headed to Williamsburg, Virginia. We had a day at <br/>
Colonial Williamsburg, then a day at Busch Gardens. Both were a lot of fun. We had <br/>
many hours in the car, listening to story tapes. We talked a lot. Then we <br/>
spent evenings watching trashy tv in hotels, cuddled together. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice to be back, especially since Beth surprised us with cleaned and <br/>
organized rooms. Both my office and the Library (which is kind of Julian&#39;s <br/>
office) were all fixed up.  (We moved into this house two years ago, and both rooms <br/>
have looked pretty awful for a LONG time!)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for a great experience.  Thank you, especially, Kelly...you did <br/>
a fabulous job. And remind Ben that I thought he was great. ;)<br/>
