<div id="ygrps-yiv-457794082">Bright Birthday Blessings Kathryn!  I&#39;m glad you were<br/>
born too.  I could say more, but that says it so well<br/>
I decided to steal it.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Alice is an evil bitch.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s good to see clearly isn&#39;t it?  I know it&#39;s no<br/>
laughing matter, but it brought a smile to my face to<br/>
hear this summed up so succinctly.  Hold on to that<br/>
inner strength and surety of yourself and your purpose<br/>
(and Julian&#39;s amazingness!)  You&#39;re dead on accurate.<br/>
<br/>
Nanci K.</div>
