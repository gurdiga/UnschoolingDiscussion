<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Never mind. I just answered my own question. I went 
to the atkins diet web site and it did indeed state that you can eat as much as 
you like (including eggs, oils, butter, etc) as long as you don&#39;t eat carbs. It 
also gave warnings about ketosis, such as trouble for those that have diabetes, 
liver, kidney or heart troubles. Along with an increased risk for osteoperosis 
and kidney stones. Also. I&#39;ve heard of people having trouble keeping the weight 
off and I can&#39;t imagine all these eggs and meat products can be good for your 
cholesterol levels. Oh well, I guess no diet is perfect. LOL.</font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118211547">Stuff in the news over ehre recently about eggs having no effect on <br/>
cholesterol levels.  Someone with an egg er, fetish?  addiction? <br/>
who had 4 eggs per day, ie 28 per week, was found to have no <br/>
increase in cholesterol.  And other studies have decided that it&#39;s <br/>
more down to genetics and metabolism than what, exactly, one <br/>
eats.  And I&#39;m sure everyone knows that cholesterol is actually <br/>
necessary for some phases of developement.  One reason why we <br/>
stuck with butter and didn&#39;t go for low-fat things when H was a baby <br/>
and on formula, since all animal fat is taken out of formula <br/>
(including milk-fat) so that it can be classified as suitable for <br/>
vegetarians.  Just wish Granny Ruby hadn&#39;t started them on putting <br/>
sugar on their breakfast cereal...<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Actually, I have learned that not to trust most of 
what they/govn&#39;t says is/isnn&#39;t good for you. I have decided 
that&nbsp;they/govn&#39;t will tell you that breathing will&nbsp; cause cancer and 
that it is just a ploy to control the people. They say too much and then later 
go back and say, &quot;Oops, we were wrong. It&#39;s okay to breath.&quot; One example is 
eggs. Some years ago they said that eggs are extremely high in cholesterol and 
to cut back on eating them. Then they said&nbsp; that further studies conclude 
that although eggs&nbsp; contain cholesterol, the levels are not&nbsp; as high 
as originally thought. I just do my own thing. Whatever&nbsp; feels right to 
me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Corallyn</font></div>
