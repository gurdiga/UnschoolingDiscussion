&gt; respect kids and young adults.  It was refreshing and reaffirming.   <br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t thank them enough for what they have given me and this was <br/>

I&#39;m so glad the weekend made a difference. That was my goal! (and to <br/>
selfishly be able to meet these folks IRL too!)<br/>
<br/>
That &quot;clicking&quot; you heard was that paradigm shift you hear here all the time. <br/>
Congratulations! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
