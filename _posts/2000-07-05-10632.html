How do you do this?????  I am so amazed!!  I&#39;ve tried to go only once a week<br/>
and cannot manage it....we live so far from &quot;town&quot; and the grocery store,<br/>
but my refrigerator will simply not hold enough milk or oj for a week and<br/>
the bananas get too ripe.  There are NO health food stores or co-ops so<br/>
organic is wishful thinking.  How do you do it?!?!?<br/>
