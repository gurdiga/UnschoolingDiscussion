&lt;&lt; I agree. I don&#39;t tell my boys anything.  They decide everything.  What, <br/>
when, <br/>
how much food to eat.  And they are great at it.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty and I just got back from the breakfast buffet at Shoney&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
He had a check-up this morning, as we needed the doctor to sign off on a form <br/>
for him to apply for the Junior Police Academy this summer.   It was the <br/>
first time he had been to the doctor since he got a tetanus shot at 9.  He&#39;s <br/>
14.    I reminded him that when he got a shot we offered to take him out for <br/>
ice cream, and so asked if he wanted to go out to breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
Truth was, I was hungry.  He got up early on his own and the rest were asleep <br/>
anyway.  And we were having good conversations.<br/>
<br/>
So.  Growing fourteen year old boy who just got a &quot;strong as a rock&quot; checkup. <br/>
 Unlimited breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
He got a Dr Pepper to drink.   I got tomato juice.<br/>
<br/>
He got one plate, not too full, eggs, biscuit, gravy, potatoes, two pieces of <br/>
bacon and one link sausage.<br/>
<br/>
That was all.  We ate.  Talked.  Sat.  <br/>
<br/>
I asked if he wanted to go back for seconds.  He said &quot;I was thinking about <br/>
it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I reminded him he had first said he wanted to go where they had pancakes.  So <br/>
he got pancakes, but said they weren&#39;t so good, so left most of them on the <br/>
plate.<br/>
<br/>
He is not desperate for food.  Good.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to keep his napkin but he wadded it up.  While I was at the <br/>
bathroom, he was putting some mathematical notation of his own devising, <br/>
mostly, something about how stats and encounters are to work in a new <br/>
western-scenario online RPG he and a friend are designing.   He said &quot;Plain <br/>
math is so pretty.  I really like it.&quot;   And by that he seemed to mean that <br/>
the way logic lays out on paper is attractive to him.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the two formulas he was writing were symbolic.  All, maybe.  It was <br/>
hit points and adjustments and relationships to the opponent&#39;s strengths.  In <br/>
letters with function and relationship symbols.  <br/>
<br/>
For something he was writing the abbreviation and putting a little plus sign <br/>
below and to the right.  Not quite where subscripts go, but right underneath. <br/>
 I asked if that was just a symbol he made up or something common to gaming.  <br/>
He said he made it up to mean that amount or more.  So I showed him the <br/>
symbols for equal or greater and equal or less.   He found that pretty AND <br/>
useful.<br/>
<br/>
I also told him to show that stuff to his dad who could show him some <br/>
programming symbols.<br/>
<br/>
And I told him I found musical notation really pretty and elegant.<br/>
<br/>
We could have gone, but when the waitress asked if he wanted more Dr Pepper <br/>
he said yes.   We have DP at home.  He was having fun sitting and talking to <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
And he didn&#39;t look at me for permission to say yes, which seemed an indicator <br/>
that he felt whole in the situation too.  And it was his post-doctor-visit <br/>
activity, too, so it was &quot;his turn&quot; in that way, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
As we were leaving the restaurant, though, he said &quot;I just LOVE math.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cool!<br/>
