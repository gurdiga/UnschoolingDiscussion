<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282197052">Hi everyone,<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading your posts for a week or two and thought it was time  to <br/>
say hello.  At home, and following an unschooling philosophy is my son  Hayden <br/>
(12), son Logan (10) and daughter Holly (8), myself and my husband.<br/>
We didn&#39;t come by unschooling naturally I&#39;m disappointed to say, but now  <br/>
that we are here we don&#39;t know what took us so long!  All of my children  have <br/>
been in public school but we are reveling in being together at home.<br/>
The recent post from another Linda with a son, Logan, caught my  attention.<br/>
Our Logan sounds very similar.  At 8, a lot of things his siblings  could do <br/>
were difficult and often impossible for Logan.  I agree with the  several <br/>
posts that encourage you to wait and let him move at his own speed  without any <br/>
interference, no matter how well intentioned.<br/>
At 10, Logan is growing gradually into his body and managing very  nicely.  <br/>
He now loves to cook and can spread his own peanut butter.   He does not ride a <br/>
bike or tie his shoes or other things some people equate with  a 10 year <br/>
old&#39;s abilities.  He did have vision problems, caught early at  the age of 4 - but <br/>
not early enough.  He has little depth perception but  can compensate very <br/>
well.  He has seen a pediatric optholmolgist (a  children&#39;s eye dr./surgeon) for <br/>
6 years and wears a rather strong prescription  pair of glasses.  His eyes <br/>
are improving, though, and he recently had his  prescription reduced from the <br/>
strongest available to the next notch down.   Dr. says by age 13 or 14, he may <br/>
not need lenses at all if his eyes continue to  strengthen.<br/>
I&#39;ve enjoyed the sharing and the experienced voices on this list and have  <br/>
all ready absorbed a great deal.<br/>
Thank you, all, and I look forward to reading/learning/sharing more.<br/>
Linda in Ann Arbor, MI<br/>
