It is my experience that as they are unschooled they KEEP the &quot;mom and dad are good.&quot;  We have differences, some large some small, but if we as parents are genuine with them, non-manipulative on all levels, and allow them to direct themselves, then they have no reason to loose that feeling.<br/>
<br/>
If you are like me, raised in law-enforcment family, schooled for p.s., college and 2 univ degrees, then DOING the above is hard.  But i&#39;ve come a long way.  And they still regard me as good.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, hugs - they help too.  :O))<br/>
