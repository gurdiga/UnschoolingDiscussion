The following was sent by someone who joined the list just a few days ago,  <br/>
and so the post was rejected, because I think the feedback might&#39;ve been really <br/>
 uncomfortable if addressed to the author.    I&#39;m bringing the  ideas here, <br/>
though, hoping not to cause discomfort (except the healthy kind of  discomfort <br/>
that comes from looking at our changing ideas).<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think this necessarily qualifies as a deeply held idea or  belief.  <br/>
It sounds (from some of the phrasing) like recitation of  truisms.  I&#39;ve heard <br/>
some of these very same phrases in my life, over the  years, from critical <br/>
older female relatives and from strangers and in  discussions such as these.   <br/>
 <br/>
*****<br/>
Yes,I have some thoughts.  The difference between the childless  <br/>
friends, and people with children who don&#39;t want to help clean the  <br/>
house, especially of their own messes, is that (1) the children benefit  <br/>
from having a more or less tidy & clean house,and therefore need to do  <br/>
their little part and (2) they need to see that Mama is not a built-in  <br/>
servant/slave who comes with the house. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, &quot;force&quot; is  such a dirty word.  So, let&#39;s say that in the long <br/>
run, it is a good  idea for all members of the household who aren&#39;t <br/>
wheelchair-bound to be  encouraged to clean up messes, do the dishes, <br/>
and so on.  One more  thing:  doing it yourself can often be easier than <br/>
trying to get all  household members to do their share, no doubt about <br/>
it. But we do our  children no favor by taking on their <br/>
responsibilities.    <br/>
****<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Responsibility&quot; means that someone is answerable (response is the root  <br/>
word) to another for the completion of  that task.<br/>
 <br/>
Another couple of ideas about it.  There are wheelchair-bound people  who are <br/>
very capable of washing dishes in their own houses.  There are  millions of <br/>
able-bodied children who are NOT capable yet.  Wheelchairs  don&#39;t make the <br/>
difference.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-doing it yourself can often be easier than <br/>
trying to get all  household members to do their share-=-<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Shares&quot; as in equal shares?  Assigned shares?  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a hard idea, to only write and post what we&#39;ve really, personally  <br/>
examined and understood at a directly personal level, rather than just repeating  <br/>
what we were assured was the way things should be.  <br/>
 <br/>
The writing above would be considered true and good by countless  people.  <br/>
The results are clear around us too.  A lot of frustration  and resentment are <br/>
avoidable.  When I was assigning chores, no one was  happier and the house <br/>
wasn&#39;t cleaner.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480812708">We have a three-story house.  The second and third floor (first and<br/>
second to the Brit reader) consist of one room each.  Yesterday as I<br/>
was walking from the first floor (ground floor to the Brit reader)to<br/>
the top floor I stepped on a pile of Yu-gi-oh cards in the entrance to<br/>
Simon&#39;s room.  Linnaea had piled them up to look through them while<br/>
she and Simon were watching the Empire Strikes Back.  I made a note<br/>
and, slightly irritated, said that they would get destroyed if they<br/>
weren&#39;t picked up.  I noticed them again later, packed them away in<br/>
the bag Simon keeps them in and it was done.  No fights, no spats<br/>
about who needed to clean them up, 3 minutes work at most and only<br/>
that one moment of irritation from me (actually David mentioned it at<br/>
one point and I said I&#39;d get them in a minute--so maybe 2 minutes<br/>
irritation in total).  When I went to cuddle Simon to sleep I noticed<br/>
that there were a bunch of beads scattered about the floor and I<br/>
thought I&#39;ll clean those in the morning.  Morning came and as I was<br/>
fixing some noodles and parmesan for Simon for lunch he came down and<br/>
said he&#39;d cleaned up the beads that were on the floor while he was<br/>
waiting for me to come watch the Empire Strikes Back with him.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t ask him.  I didn&#39;t ask Linnaea.  I didn&#39;t even mention it. <br/>
He&#39;s 8.  He&#39;s never been given chores.  Independently he saw something<br/>
and did it.  It wasn&#39;t his responsibility to take care of it.  Just as<br/>
it wasn&#39;t my responsibility to make sure the Yu-Gi-Oh cards didn&#39;t get<br/>
trashed.  But, I didn&#39;t want him to be unhappy because they did get<br/>
trashed, and that was and is more important than me teaching him a<br/>
lesson about taking care of his things.<br/>
