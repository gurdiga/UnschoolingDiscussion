Holly would LOVE a situation like that.  Every time she&#39;s around a baby or <br/>
toddler she just gushes about it for hours or days.  She would go places with <br/>
another family absolutely free at this point just to get to be around and play <br/>
with and observe a baby.<br/>
<br/>
We found that adding another child to the situation often makes much less <br/>
work for the mom.  The kids&#39; need for conversation can be supplied by the new <br/>
person, they sometimes act better for &quot;having company,&quot; they&#39;re stimulated in new <br/>
ways by the new person&#39;s ideas and experiences, etc.<br/>

I did this for two years every Wed. afternoon so I would work on <br/>
my writing. I was at home and the 10-11 year old would play with <br/>
the toddlers and youngers while the baby napped. It was <br/>
wonderful! (Plus, since you&#39;re home, you can pay a little less <br/>
than the going rate to a 13 year old who sits while you&#39;re away).<br/>

what triggers that maternal instinct so strongly?<br/>

I bet that&#39;s a factor.  <br/>

Our mother&#39;s helper neighbor when Holly was little was the oldest of all <br/>
girls (two younger sisters) but she liked being at our house because it was the <br/>
same kind of work, only different surroundings and she got paid!  I think she <br/>
enjoyed being around the boys, too, since she only had sisters.<br/>
