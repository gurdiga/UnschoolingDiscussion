   I will NOT &quot;chew your butt&quot; for pushing kids, but I will stick mine out <br/>
also &lt;grin&gt;. I have twin boys who are 8 and they need some directions <br/>
sometimes. I love the idea of child-led learning, but not to the extent that <br/>
it is directionless. Everyone can benefit from a gentle hand (or <br/>
not-so-gentle)....<br/>
My two cents worth,<br/>
Karen :)<br/>
