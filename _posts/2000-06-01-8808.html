<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446214690">We are real lucky in where we live as this area has never been heavily<br/>
commerically farmed and thus the farm lands are relatively unscathed by the<br/>
overloading of pesticides/chemicals, etc.  We have a large group of &quot;real&quot;<br/>
organic farmers and have two farmers markets each week and several<br/>
health/natural food stores and even chains that buy local organic produce.<br/>
<br/>
The beef we buy (and we don&#39;t buy that much or eat it that often) is from<br/>
cattle that I have personal knowledge of that haven&#39;t had anti-biotics<br/>
injected or in their feed and haven&#39;t been given growth hormones.  I stick<br/>
with meat from young steers.  A large percentage of the commercially<br/>
produced hamburger comes from &quot;retired&quot; dairy cows and bull meat is added<br/>
for that rich lean look.  These two are loaded with naturally occuring<br/>
hormones at elevated levels, not counting in what adverse effects the BGH<br/>
and other hormones might have.  Sooooo, fast food hamburgers are high on my<br/>
list as &quot;poison.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Have you read &quot;Diet for a Poisoned Planet&quot; which lists all the FDA stats on<br/>
residues?  Although it is rather dated, it does have an exception<br/>
bibliography and can provide a real &quot;trail&quot; for doing current research.<br/>

Look in your library for the book &quot;Totally dairy-Free<br/>
Cooking&quot; by Louis Lanza (try the new books section)<br/>
Many great recipes for using tofu. (this is not a<br/>
vegetarian book)What I like best is his ability to<br/>
cook using ingredients that don&#39;t always include tofu<br/>
or tempeh;but are dairy free! Great food here! try it!<br/>
<br/>

pesticide laden crop as well (not to mention moldy)<br/>
one should always buy organic.<br/>
