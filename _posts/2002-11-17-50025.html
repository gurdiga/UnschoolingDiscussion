&lt;&lt; I mean isn&#39;t unschooling all about learning?  Are we not all learning <br/>
new things all the time?  Doesn&#39;t our learning how to access and use <br/>
the internet set a good example for our children who might be <br/>
intimidated about learning something new?  Of course, most of the <br/>
time they could easily teach us what we need to know about computers <br/>
and the internet in a minute, right? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I must say, that when people tell me they want to unschool and they don&#39;t <br/>
have a computer, nor do they plan to get one, I think it&#39;s kinda like saying <br/>
&quot;I&#39;d like to be a volunteer fireman, but I can&#39;t see well in the dark, and I <br/>
don&#39;t have a telephone.  No, I don&#39;t WANT to get a telephone.  So tell me <br/>
about this volunteer fire department thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No.  The answer to that is no.<br/>
<br/>
YES people can unschool without a computer.  But I can&#39;t help them unless <br/>
they have one.  And I can&#39;t help them learn the glorious immediate <br/>
information available with google.com!<br/>
<br/>
It is possible that I help homeschoolers without computers, because I suppose <br/>
some of them might read Home Education Magazine, and some of those might read <br/>
my column.  But that&#39;s very indirect compared to looking things up between <br/>
now and the time I hit send, and me being in the other room watching Lord of <br/>
the Rings (Again) before anyone reads what I wrote...<br/>

and 9PM. (I can&#39;t imagine what it must be like in the apartments in the<br/>
building next to it.) And a special series, 2-3-2 I think, for fires. Used<br/>
to be (within the last 15 years) that series would be followed by a series<br/>
of blasts that told the volunteer firefighters which street to go to. But I<br/>
guess they call in now when they hear the 2-3-2. (And it wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
solved not being able to see in the dark.)<br/>
<br/>
Which has nothing to do with unschooling. ;-)<br/>

a volunteer firefighter.  If he heard the siren, he turned on the scanner.<br/>

It&#39;s the same thing with books.  Have you ever visited an unschooler who doesn&#39;t have books, lots of books, books everywhere?  I&#39;ve visited school at home types who don&#39;t have any books in there home, except a few &quot;What your child should learn in the XXX grade&quot; kind of books.  I know people who have homeschooled for years that rarely visit the library and NEVER purchase a book.  They&#39;ve never even read any homeschooling books!<br/>
<br/>
In my house, there is a library/study with one whole wall full of books.  In the basement/kids room there are 6 large freestanding bookshelves FULL.  Each child has bookshelves in their room full of books.  The family room hearth has 2 large boxes we try to keep the library books in (so we don&#39;t loose them &lt;g&gt;).  And that&#39;s not even thinking of the books in the car, on the couch, lying about on every horizontal surface in the house!!  <br/>
<br/>
Folks who still don&#39;t use books will probably never understand how wonderful the internet is.  In my mind it&#39;s just another VERY large library at my fingertips!!!!<br/>

When Dillon was about 2 1/2 or 3, we lived in Boone NC.  He loved to go to Blowing Rock to the park and to walk around in the shops.  One day we were both on top of the largest, twisting slide, about to go down together, when their noon horn at the firestation went off.  It is physically about 45 feet from where we were.  Dillon freaked!  In fact he did not go down another slide until he was about 6-7, I guess he always associated that sudden fear with the slide!!<br/>
