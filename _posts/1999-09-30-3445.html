&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;Microsoft Internet Explorer. It destroys <br/>

Nearly all of the warnings (like the poisonous spider warning that <br/>
circulated, or the drug needles in the public telephone just as examples) <br/>
that are passed are urban legends.  Also the virus warnings passes around are <br/>
also hoaxes.  Some web sites you may want to bookmark for reference are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003218830">Forgive me if someone else has already pointed this out, but this is a hoax, <br/>
as is just about anything you get that tells you to send it to everyone you <br/>
know.  they don&#39;t really announce new viruses this way.  If you do a search <br/>
on viruses you will find a web site (i cant remember the URL) that tells all <br/>
about every virus and virus hoax going around.  This one is listed there as <br/>
a hoax.<br/>

I also get annoyed at all the cutesy ones that say send this to everyone<br/>
you consider a friend, including the person who sent it to you.  Though<br/>
some of the messages are nice and worth reading, I wouldn&#39;t want<br/>
everything i send out to get sent back to me.  it&#39;s hard enough to keep<br/>
up already.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-783800865">I was so hurt for Yol by Elissa&#39;s post.  I dont really even know Yol <br/>
that well.. Just through email and groups.  But I was so offended by <br/>
Elissa&#39;s wrongful accusations about her, I looked back to see when <br/>
Yol joined.  She joined this list on 11-9-02.  WELL before this <br/>
particular thread.  I also looked up in the archives the messages she <br/>
has posted and replied to.  Many more before this thread, and all <br/>
good contributions.  I suggest that before someone makes accusations, <br/>
they do thier research.   Oh, and btw, I didnt join here to cause <br/>
trouble or troll either.. I joined on 11-22.. Heres the # of my first <br/>
post..50531. You know, I looked back and read that post, I realized <br/>
that no one replied or even offered a welcome.  With my low self <br/>
esteem and all, I should have just crawled away then..<br/>

This is a pretty big list now, and not everyone can read everyday.  Not<br/>
everyone gets enough time to reply to every post, and not every post<br/>
inspires an immediate response.   That&#39;s not a judgement about the<br/>
poster, that&#39;s just the way different minds work. <br/>
<br/>
I know personally, if there&#39;s a post I might have replied to but haven&#39;t<br/>
been able to read for two or three days, the two or three hundred<br/>
messages in between have moved the list on, and that topic is, for the<br/>
time being, finished.   I can almost guarantee it will come up again, and<br/>
with any luck, if I had something to say, I can say it then.<br/>
<br/>
Also, sometimes a topic has just been discussed and if it was an intense<br/>
discussion, people may not have the stamina to go over it again for a<br/>
while.  Sometimes even, though you won&#39;t agree,&lt;g&gt; people are hoping a<br/>
new poster will get more information just by hanging around and without<br/>
having a post dissected first thing.  <br/>
<br/>
People aren&#39;t deliberately choosing to ignore you if they don&#39;t reply to<br/>
a post.  People are just busy with other ideas, or topics or busy with<br/>
their lives.   I&#39;m sorry that hurt your feelings but it happens a lot to<br/>
everyone.    Some of my sparkling and inspired posts are DOA.  (imagine!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Once again, you have grossly missed the point.  You want to continue <br/>
insisting that my feelings have been hurt.  I aint that fragile.  The point <br/>
was that Elissa was WRONG.   ( I am assuming this was directed at me and not <br/>
at the group in general). Hey, if it was for &quot;everybody&quot; then feel free to <br/>
respond... <br/>
