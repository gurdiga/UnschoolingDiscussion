<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795370676">Yesterday, kind of spur of the moment, we decided to go for a family outing<br/>
to some Texas History sites to which we had never been.  Dh, me and 5 kids<br/>
(11, 8, 5, 3 and 2) took off.<br/>
<br/>
First place we went was a living history center with lots of old cabins,<br/>
etc..  We were pretty much the only ones there.  Initially, the kids balked<br/>
but as we went, unguided from building to building, the kids able to walk<br/>
inside the cabins and see how they were used, climb the stairs to see in the<br/>
sleeping loft, etc., the excitement began to build with the kids running<br/>
(not in an obnoxious, unruly way, but in a joyful &quot;isn&#39;t this fun&quot; way) from<br/>
building to building, pointing out interesting items, talking about how they<br/>
were used, making connections to things they had seen before. As we were<br/>
leaving we stopped in the little shop and the old lady docent talked with us<br/>
and the kids about the museum, where she was raised, demonstrations they put<br/>
on, etc.,  Kids rated the place as &quot;cool&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Second place we stopped was a small museum with everything behind glass.<br/>
Again, we were pretty much the only ones there.  The kids were having a good<br/>
time looking at the different things, making comments or asking questions.<br/>
The 3yo pointed to an antique toy and asked if we could buy it.  This<br/>
apparently sent the docent off her rocker.  She came running across to the<br/>
kids, calling for them to stop what they were doing and proceeded to lecture<br/>
them that museums were places for LEARNING, they needed to focus on LEARNING<br/>
while they were there.  We kind of rounded up the kids and went outside to a<br/>
large wall-like monument with metal ramps and stairs going around to the<br/>
backside.  The little guys took off running to see what was behind the<br/>
monument.  Again, here comes the docent yelling she doesn&#39;t allow people<br/>
back there so I round the kids up explaining it was against the rules to go<br/>
back there.  Then the docent says they can go back there as long as they<br/>
FOLLOW HER IN AN ORDERLY MANNER.  The kids are willing and begin to follow<br/>
her.  The 3yo walks about 2 steps in front of the lady and she starts<br/>
snapping her fingers at him telling him to get behind her.....to go down<br/>
some cement steps in an amphitheater.  what a nut.  I had had it and the<br/>
kids were looking at her like she was nuts....so we just left....with the<br/>
docent still hollering at us about how the kids have to LEARN about being in<br/>
line at some point.<br/>
<br/>
Later we stopped at Dairy Queen for some icecream and we all teased each<br/>
other to make sure we were LEARNING, not just enjoying ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
I hope the kids aren&#39;t permanently put off museums now  LOL.<br/>
