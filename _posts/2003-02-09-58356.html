a clean plastic jar (peanut butter, my directions said...maybe it&#39;s supposed<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So my kids have interests...let&#39;s take my 9 year old son for example. He likes<br/>
&gt; rocks. He has collected them since he was little. Since this is something he<br/>
&gt; is interested in, what exactly do I do now? I am waiting for our library to<br/>
&gt; get a book about experiments with rocks (it is checked out at the time). He<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t seem interested in reading books about rocks really because most of<br/>
&gt; these are too encyclopedia-like to catch his interest.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why don&#39;t *you* read the books yourself?  Not to him, but to yourself.  You<br/>
might get some ideas.  You might learn something cool that you could share<br/>
with him.  You might even see why he&#39;s not particularly interested in these<br/>
books. <br/>
<br/>
You could use some of his larger rocks in art projects.  We&#39;ve made some<br/>
cool painted rocks compliments of a klutz press kit that Tim got as a<br/>
present from his grandparents.  But the kit only has ideas.  All you need is<br/>
paint, it&#39;s nothing fancy.<br/>
<br/>
How about repeating Gallileo&#39;s experiment on larger/smaller: which falls<br/>
faster.  Can&#39;t be very hard to get any kid interested in dropping rocks out<br/>
of a second floor window!  (Look out, below!)<br/>
<br/>
Have you broken any of them open?<br/>
Explored crystals?  Crystals are cool because you can make your own with<br/>
sugar and water and food coloring.<br/>
Would he be interested in how some native peoples made arrowheads out of<br/>
flint?  (flintknapping, it&#39;s called, if you&#39;re googling it)<br/>
Any lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, or oceans nearby that you could go dig a<br/>
handful of rocks out of the bottom?<br/>
<br/>
The cool part of any one interest to me is not how long we can prolong that<br/>
interest, it&#39;s all the totally different places any one interest can take<br/>
us.  And how one thing can take us somewhere totally different.<br/>
<br/>
My son is a fanatic coin collector.  His allowance goes almost entirely<br/>
towards coin purchases.  It started because we went to a church conference<br/>
in Rome.  I was there to represent my church, and had hoped that Rome would<br/>
get him interested in history.  You know, Roman history.  (He was 5.  Duh,<br/>
Mom.)  But Tim seemed interested before we left, and was impressed by the<br/>
collesium and Roman ruins.  For about 10 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
But the people at my conference came from all over Europe, and the Bishop<br/>
from Portugal (wearing a really cool purple shirt) gave him a portugese coin<br/>
and mentioned that there were people here from Switzerland and Belgium and<br/>
other places.  Everybody there met my &quot;shy&quot; son.  He asked every single<br/>
person for money from their country.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll still ask people for money from their country.  His goal is a coin<br/>
from every country in the world.  From a trip to Rome, he learned about<br/>
money and talking to people.  Kids are amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Wonder where rocks will take your son.<br/>

<br/>
I was visiting a family with two mid-age kids, and one brought his rock <br/>
collection to show me, out at a picnic table in the yard.  I asked his mom <br/>
for a pan of water and we put each rock in the water to see it change.  He <br/>
was amazed.  It was fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-409842718">If you haven&#39;t already you may want to check out this children&#39;s book called &quot;Rocks in His Head&quot;.  Very funny and true. Based on the author&#39;s dad who collected rocks as a hobby.  He had a gas station during the depression and had his rocks on display. He had to shut down the gas station and the only job he could find was janitor at a museum. His passion turned into a career as curator at the museum.<br/>

Lazadro Museum (I&#39;m sure I spelled that wrong) in Elmhurst, IL has a<br/>

<br/>
Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago has a very nice gem room, and I&#39;m<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468282666">Our sugar crystals haven&#39;t worked either.  We did manage salt crystals.  The<br/>
container needs to be not touched at all until the crystals form.<br/>
<br/>
While in Mexico, the kids found stuff on the rocks.  Turns out it was quite<br/>
lovely salt crystals from very high tides leaving salt water to dry!  Kind<br/>
of dirty though.  I found an old &#39;geology for kids&#39; picture book and brought<br/>
it with us on the trip.  We had a lot of fun one day trying to break rocks<br/>
open on the beach to see inside.  The book explained basic rock formation<br/>
and simple tests to determine how a rock was formed.  I mean really simple<br/>
tests, like break it open if you can, then explaining how the way it broke<br/>
(crumbled, or layers, etc.) can help you determine what type of rock.  We<br/>
found some small fossils too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558063022">The geology departments of universities usually have cool rock<br/>
collections and smart people who like to talk.  The university here does<br/>
summer programs, taking kids out to look for rocks and crystals.   That&#39;s<br/>
fun because you learn some good places to hunt for rocks and there are<br/>
usually some  stray geologists along for the ride.   The programs here<br/>
are not structured at all.   You show up at the university, pay five<br/>
bucks, jump in their van and go look for rocks.   Pack a lunch, wander<br/>
around, have fun.  LOTS of folks on those types of excursions are<br/>
homeschoolers.  <br/>
Dylan keeps his little rocks in egg cartons and his big rocks everywhere<br/>
else.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a pretty book called Pebble Mosaics by Deborah Schneebeli-Morrell<br/>
and Gloria Nicol <br/>
ISBN# 1-55297-573-8 published by Firefly books and it shows you how to<br/>
make baskets and fountains and walkways and such out of pebbles.  We made<br/>
some stepping stones after looking at that book and they&#39;re really<br/>
beautiful. <br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t found the various rock field guides to be especially useful. <br/>
The rocks in those books are museum quality specimens and almost never<br/>
look like the chunk of geology you&#39;re holding in your hand.   They have<br/>
other good information in them but I think you need to be an expert to<br/>
accurately identify rocks by a field guide and then of course, you<br/>
wouldn&#39;t need the field guide.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s wonderfully fun to look at rocks under a microscope.   We look at<br/>
rocks first just like we found them, with dirt and junk still on them.  <br/>
Sometimes you can find other cool stuff this way.   Once we found an<br/>
ant&#39;s head in a crevasse of a rock and were able to gently lift it out<br/>
with a needle.   Under the microscope it looked just like those pictures<br/>
of little gray aliens that are always being seen in the Ozarks by guys<br/>
named Joe Bob.   <br/>
After you look at them dirty you can scrub them up and see what was under<br/>
all that dirt.  <br/>
If you already have some river rocks piling up you can put them in your<br/>
plants (I first typed &quot;pants&quot; there, I must still be thinking of<br/>
Cadburrys)  or cleaned up really well into a fish tank or frog or turtle<br/>
tank.    That&#39;s a great excuse to get some frogs, if you needed one.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
Which reminds me of pants again as African dwarf swimming frogs are<br/>
extraordinarily lusty.  <br/>
<br/>
Look for interesting rocks around gopher holes.  Apparently gophers don&#39;t<br/>
care much about keeping cool rocks and they just leave them where anyone<br/>
can pick them up.   Also, if the gopher is gone, look for spiders webs<br/>
and their occupants in the opening.   We have seen some great spiders<br/>
this way.<br/>
I don&#39;t know what that has to do with rocks, but I&#39;m now wondering if it<br/>
has anything to do with the vanished gopher...<br/>
