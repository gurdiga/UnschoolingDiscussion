<br/>
&lt;&lt; .  How have some of you dealt with this sort of thing?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a Grandmother that won&#39;t let up. My Mom was so supportive and <br/>
wonderful, but her mother just doesn&#39;t get it.<br/>
And now I have to deal with it head on because she offered to pay for <br/>
tutoring for my children and I refused it. Graciously, kindly, thanking her <br/>
for the offer and letting her know the kids were doing great just now but <br/>
we&#39;d keep it in mind.<br/>
Well, that wasn&#39;t good enough. She started in on &quot;you need to think about <br/>
when they are trying to get jobs or into college&quot; and &quot;please think about <br/>
this from their point of view&quot; (DUH!) and some other BS!<br/>
So I finally could no longer avoid the explanation of unschooling. I <br/>
explained why/how I felt they were doing better for being able to learn <br/>
naturally. It totally freaks her out.<br/>
The bottom line is that it is no one elses business how you educate your <br/>
child.<br/>
Unless there is obvious abuse they need to shut up.<br/>
Problem is, we are abusing our kids in their minds. We are robbing them of <br/>
future success and happiness...they seriously don&#39;t understand.<br/>
So I decided to print off some stuff that I wrote, Sandra, Joyce and others <br/>
wrote, some posts from unschooling.com, some articles from various unschooler <br/>
websites and mail it to her.<br/>
I am going to include a letter asking her to please educate herself and I <br/>
will be happy to discuss it all with her.<br/>
If she&#39;s unwilling to do that I will demand (yes, demand) that unschooling <br/>
will be a taboo topic with us.<br/>
If she brings it up again I am going to tell her that I don&#39;t wish to discuss <br/>
anything related to homeschooling with her....ever.<br/>
That&#39;s just how it has to be.  It&#39;s ruining my relationship with her (not <br/>
that I have a great one anyway, we have nothing in common) and I won&#39;t let <br/>
clueless people stress me out.<br/>
I love her, but there isn&#39;t a single topic that we can discuss without <br/>
disagreement.<br/>
She&#39;s a fairly shallow person, her whole life revolves around her religion <br/>
and her husband.She has NO outside interests, passions or groups.<br/>
Sweet but controlling lady.<br/>
<br/>
So offer your Mom the chance to educate herself on the topic, but make it off <br/>
limits if she won&#39;t.  That&#39;s just my advice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751151180">Thanks for your advice.  I can identify with the having nothing in <br/>
common thing.  My husband definately did not marry someone just like <br/>
his mother (a source of irritation for her).  As far as I can tell <br/>
her interests are shopping and shopping and religion, superficially.  <br/>
Part of my problem is that I haven&#39;t been prepared when she starts <br/>
questioning me.  My instinct is to tell her to just look at her son <br/>
if she wants to know why I&#39;m unschooling.  But I don&#39;t want to hurt <br/>
her or be combative.  I will be prepared next time thanks to the <br/>
support here and closer to home (Hi Beth).<br/>

Could you channel that offer toward memberships at museums, aquariums, zoos, <br/>
science center?  <br/>
