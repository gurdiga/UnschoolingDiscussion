<div id="ygrps-yiv-866742260">Interesting that this should come up now - I just yesterday remembered to<br/>
ask Cody if he would like to go to school this year - I want to be sure he<br/>
knows he has that choice.  He looked at me like he thought I&#39;d lost my mind!<br/>
<br/>
Phew - safe for another year.<br/>
<br/>
Sure there are &quot;good&quot; schools - our school district is excellant - if you<br/>
have to be in school - Hmm, some of my best friends are Public Schoolers.<br/>
(in fact my best friend IS on the school board)<br/>
<br/>
IMHO homeschooling is best, however I know I&#39;m not going to be able to<br/>
convince everyone (anyone?) of that, so I don&#39;t try.<br/>
<br/>
It breaks my heart to see my bright &quot;gifted&quot; 14 yo niece, who loved school<br/>
her first 5 years, and now hates it.  They have nothing to offer her!  And<br/>
another friend just told me her 10 yo is ready to go back to school because<br/>
he&#39;s so bored, and I know he&#39;s just hit that hump in the road of<br/>
deschooling - maybe that&#39;s why school vacation is so short - so the kids<br/>
won&#39;t have time to figure out that they don&#39;t need someone else to tell them<br/>
what to do every minute of the day?  So lets all hear it for year round<br/>
school!<br/>
<br/>
But if my kids wanted to go to school, I&#39;d let them.  I&#39;ve heard that school<br/>
feels a whole lot different when you are there by your own choice - and when<br/>
you know that you can always go home again!<br/>
