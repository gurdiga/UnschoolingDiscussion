&lt;&lt; Some of the things talked about like; allowing the child to decide <br/>
what he/she watches on TV and for how long, what to eat and when, <br/>
when to go to bed, whether to brush teeth etc are, I thought, <br/>
parenting choices.  Even children who go to school have these issues. <br/>
So if these are part of unschooling how do they learn self-<br/>
discipline, self-control and good life habits? Do you just use <br/>
natural consequences for everything? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a parenting choice.<br/>
Unschooling is making natural learning a priority.  It can&#39;t be done just <br/>
&quot;during school hours,&quot; it ends up changing the fabric of everyday life every <br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t &quot;use&quot; natural consequences, nor do I use &quot;unnatural&quot; consequences.<br/>
<br/>
It is a natural consequence than when a kid does something that really scares <br/>
or bothers me that I discuss it with them.  I don&#39;t hide in the next room, <br/>
peeking around the corner, waiting for some natural reaction to their action <br/>
to teach them in my absence.  Other humans are part of their natural-learning <br/>
life, and the responses of other people are part of their &quot;consequences.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now if that seems like time-outs and spanking and grounding and yelling and <br/>
such could be also seen as natural (in certain families) consequences, the <br/>
factor to examine is what is each family&#39;s priority?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How does religion work with unschooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Different ways.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do people who are devout <br/>
believers &#39;teach&#39; their children their &#39;beliefs&#39;?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re not living their beliefs day by day they&#39;re pretty crummy examples <br/>
of those beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If a child asks about God do they get the parents &#39;beliefs&#39; as truth?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that true of any question to any parents?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Ors what you <br/>
choose to believe&quot; or something like that?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I believe.  But if I still believed, as I did years ago (before I <br/>
had children) that Jesus was the way, the truth, and the life, and there was <br/>
that narrow gate or the wide highway to eternal damnation, then that would BE <br/>
the only truth for me, and telling my children that the choice was theirs <br/>
would be inviting them to eternal torment.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t beleive that anymore.  When my kids asked who the first person on <br/>
earth was, I told them some believe... and told Adam and Eve.  And I said <br/>
others believe... and told evolution.  And I said there are other beliefs <br/>
too, but that those two were most prevalant hereabout.  <br/>
