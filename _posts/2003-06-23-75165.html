<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024986952">Hi everyone, I am a young mother of two boys, aged four and one.  My <br/>
four-year-old is in love with books, and I so want him to be able to <br/>
read.  What have any of you done to teach your children to read, or <br/>
have they simply learned by watching and being read to?  This may <br/>
sound silly, but I have absolutely no clue what to do.  I&#39;m sure you <br/>
all can identify with my excitement over his eagerness, I just don&#39;t <br/>
want to mess it up.  I don&#39;t want to do nothing if that is <br/>
the &quot;wrong&quot; thing to do, and make him have a hard time with reading <br/>
in the future.  But on the other hand I don&#39;t want to push and poke <br/>
at him to make him do something he could do on his own.  Any <br/>
suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there are lots of things you can do that would be fun and ultimately <br/>
positive.  <br/>
<br/>
Teaching the way they taught it in school is probably NOT one of those <br/>
things!<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re probably already doing these things, but...<br/>
<br/>
Playing with rhyming words in the car (I used that example because people are <br/>
less likely to have paper and pencil there, and doing it orally/aurally, just <br/>
messing with sounds, is the point). <br/>
<br/>
Reading all kinds of things to him. Not just books.<br/>
<br/>
Reading aloud to other people, your husband, a friend on the phone, where he <br/>
will hear reading aloud is not just for non-readers to hear.<br/>
<br/>
Playing with letters (scratching them on his back with your finger, painting <br/>
them in fingerpaints or pudding in a clean baking dish, or in the sand, or <br/>
sprayed on a wall with a water gun, or...<br/>
<br/>
People underestimate talking, watching movies, singing songs, learning <br/>
lyrics, dialogs, scenes from plays or comedy routines. A large and happy vocabulary <br/>
is a great thing to have when he starts figuring out in his own way what words <br/>
say what.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Books on tape could be good because there&#39;s sometimes (with some authors) a <br/>
difference between literary English and spoken English.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no hurry for any of that.  He can learn mounds and mountains of stuff <br/>
without reading.<br/>
<br/>
My kids learned to read gradually and in their own ways.  It&#39;s irreplaceable <br/>
in their experience, and makes all the rest of their learning easy.  I know <br/>
they learned to read on their own.  THEY know it too.  Few other things will  <br/>
ever be as complicated or profound as that!<br/>
<br/>
They didn&#39;t learn in a vacuum, and nothing else they ever do will need to be <br/>
learned without people to ask, examples to see, etc. either.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a collection of families&#39; accounts and differences:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027583152">I think being in love with books is fabulous for a 4 year old.  <br/>
Here&#39;s my reading story.  I have two kids age 8 and 10.  The 10 yo <br/>
loved books almost from the moment of her birth.  I thought she would <br/>
read really early, like 4 or 5.  As it turned out, she could read a <br/>
few selected words at those ages like our names and the word love <br/>
(always a favorite!).  However, she didn&#39;t read a book until age 7.5 <br/>
(with no reading lessons, just answering her questions when she had <br/>
them).  She is a Harry Potter fan and is in the middle of the new <br/>
book now.  This is first one that she is reading on her own.  In the <br/>
past I read them all to her, but she was so anxious to get going on <br/>
it she couldn&#39;t wait for me this time.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s ok to just read aloud and encourage a love of books without <br/>
thinking they need to learn to read right away.  Right now, my son <br/>
who will be 9 in 3 months is not a reader, but he absolutely loves <br/>
books.  He was the complete opposite of his sister, he couldn&#39;t even <br/>
sit for a read aloud until he was 5.5.  I despaired for years that he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t love books, and then boom, he did.  Now, he loves to be read <br/>
to, loves to sit and look at picture books on his own.  I&#39;m sure that <br/>
he won&#39;t be able to read books for a long time, but that&#39;s ok.  He <br/>
does recognize his name.  In fact, he went out the mailbox yesterday <br/>
and came back with the mail saying he got two letters!  I was very <br/>
surprised, but he did read his name on the letters.  <br/>
<br/>
Please, let your son come to reading on his own.  When he does it <br/>
himself he will be so proud.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374667155">In my mind, unschooling is not the total absence of direct learning (or <br/>
teaching), instead it is simply letting children decide the method, the <br/>
time, the timing, etc.  I bought Janene (who is five today!) an Explode <br/>
the Code Book.  It&#39;s a pretty good book to teach reading.  She was <br/>
totally into it.  For the first few days she worked 10-15 pages a day. <br/>
 One night she announced she was staying up and studying ALL NIGHT.  She <br/>
told me I could sleep on the couch because she was lying in my spot on <br/>
the bed so she could work better with the light.  She picked the book <br/>
(with my guidance) and worked through it (with my help) but she asked <br/>
for the book.  We read aloud to her a great deal, she writes constantly, <br/>
our home is FILLED with books, (one job that has to be done regularly is <br/>
to empty the bathrooms of reading material, and reshelve the books that <br/>
are left by various locations including the beds and chairs and kitchen <br/>
table.)  Reading is everywhere, so I know Janene will learn to read. <br/>
 But she has ASKED to learn to read now so I am helping her.  I have <br/>
told her what things we can do (the explode the code book, flash cards, <br/>
bob books, etc.) and she picked the explode the code, bob books, and <br/>
reading games.  We have always played rhyming and word games, and she <br/>
began writing by herself a long time ago.  Life creates so many writing <br/>
opportunities, she writes down my order when she&#39;s playing waitress, <br/>
writes menus, writes notes to me or to her friends, she is writing all <br/>
the time and through writing she is learning to read.  Through reading <br/>
she is learning to write.  I know that if I wanted to I could do nothing <br/>
and she&#39;d learn to read, because reading and writing are part of our <br/>
life, our culture and it would simply happen.  But I also know that <br/>
Janene wants to learn now, has asked to learn, and so I am helping her. <br/>
 If she had asked to learn how to make cookies, Iwould provide the <br/>
materials and the help and we would make cookies.  Same with reading.  I <br/>
provide the materials and help her and we learn.  <br/>
<br/>
I should note, she works in the book as she chooses.  I don&#39;t make her <br/>
do five pages a day, or ask her.  It&#39;s there, on the table.  She&#39;s been <br/>
busy the last few days with the new HP book and her birthday party.  So <br/>
she hasn&#39;t done anything in it.  It&#39;ll happen.  Just like everything <br/>
else, she will start college reading, she will be weaned, will no longer <br/>
be sleeping in the bed with me, she will not wet her college dorm bed, <br/>
and she will have learned how to fold her own laundry and scrub a <br/>
toilet.   Well, no guarantees on the last two things.  ;-)<br/>

(or type and print out) and she would either read the printout or write it in <br/>
her own writing and read it aloud to anyone who would listen!<br/>
<br/>
All my kids liked song yrics and would read along with lyrics before they <br/>
could have read independently.  Because of the format and the familiarity of most <br/>
of the lyrics, if there was one unclear phrase or word they could find it and <br/>
puzzle it out, or figure out which of their options/guesses it was.<br/>
<br/>
Today Holly finished the first long book she&#39;s ever read.  She started <br/>
reading it because another homeschooling friend of hers had been directed to read <br/>
it, at least one chapter a day.  Her friend still hasn&#39;t finished.  She&#39;s made <br/>
excuses for not reading, she has been punished for not reading, but she hasn&#39;t <br/>
finished and Holly, with no requirement or pressure, has.<br/>

Dear Leann,<br/>
<br/>
Our family spent 3 1/2 years in the schools trying to help our son read. (He <br/>
read better before he began)<br/>
To make a long story short and what brought us to Unschooling was letting him <br/>
go.<br/>
What I mean is I let him read, view look at whatever he wanted. Magazines, <br/>
Closed Captioning (while baby slept in my room and we sat together), Video <br/>
games, comic books anything he wanted. Eventually he requested the larger books, <br/>
novels to be precise. Our son went from mags to adultish chapter books. Once he <br/>
found he liked to follow the stories he jumped in and hasn&#39;t stopped. <br/>
Unlike yours our son disliked reading. He would not pick one up let alone <br/>
even let me buy one just to have around. Now he asks to go to the book store. <br/>
<br/>
I know I have said it before but because of my joy I&#39;ll repeat myself. Our <br/>
son was labeled LD in school and told us he will always struggle. They had no <br/>
faith in him and one private school even told us he was lazy (never looked at <br/>
his records nor spoke with me before making that statement though I had written <br/>
two notes to her telling her as an FYI that he had some struggles. I met with <br/>
her, told her and she said it again so I pulled him out. Funny thing is they <br/>
are still demanding the rest of that school years tuition and have sent me to <br/>
collections. I am not paying it and as a matter of fact I told the collector <br/>
that called the other day that I just might sue them for damages. lol,after I <br/>
told the collector the story she told me to send in all his HS stuff, the letter <br/>
from the teacher calling him lazy and they would close the account and tell <br/>
the school they would not collect on such a situation. HUH!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, SO what I am saying is have fun enjoy your children and let them read <br/>
what they want. Also if the older one reads the younger one just might she <br/>
that and follow I know my daughter 3 1/2 is taking interest.<br/>

<br/>
Kass and Kree came in my room the other day and announced Kass read 28 pages <br/>
and Kree 32, while in the car running errands with DH. Kass reads often (in <br/>
comparison to Kree, but not a lot), Kree has zero interest still. I was so happy <br/>
for them, it was a major reading break through and no one told them to read. <br/>
They were pretty proud of themselves too. They even had to call my mom, she&#39;s <br/>
been bribing them for the last three years to no avail. They were thrilled <br/>
their experience was something everyone was happy about. But they didn&#39;t <br/>
hestitate to tell Grammy, &quot;not to get used to this&quot;. LOL They received no reward and <br/>
read because they wanted to and for no other reason. I love when that happens.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully Holly enjoyed the whole experience. Please congratulate her for us.<br/>

I can only hope and dream that day will come around here. When Kass and Kree <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-831971553">From: &quot;kulahawaii&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mkshields@...">mkshields@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Please, let your son come to reading on his own.  When he does it<br/>
himself he will be so proud.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree totally. Sometimes and early avid love of books doesn&#39;t necessarily<br/>
mean they will be &quot;early&quot; readers and sometimes if you think they will never<br/>
love a good book, bam, they do later on. Just don&#39;t look at it as an age<br/>
thing. As being an early reader or a late one. Just that they will when they<br/>
are ready to, either from want or need.<br/>
<br/>
Joseph and Sierra both loved books from a very young age. I remember reading<br/>
sometimes 6 and 7 books at bedtime each night. Right before Joseph was 4, he<br/>
read to me some words from his reptile book. His favorite at the time. Joe<br/>
thought it was memorized until he read me the back of the book which I had<br/>
never read to him before. I was pretty amazed and thought maybe this was the<br/>
start of him reading. Nope. That was it. Never again that I knew of. They<br/>
both still loved books and we read a lot here, still do. Then when Joseph<br/>
was almost 7 and Sierra 6, they both just started to read. Literally just<br/>
like that. I have people ask me what I did or how they learned, (other<br/>
homeschoolers) and I really can&#39;t give them one answer. They just did all on<br/>
their own.<br/>
<br/>
Now Alyssa is even more in love with books than they were. We go about it<br/>
all the same. Read a lot and play word games. And we read a lot more than<br/>
just books. In fact I have to watch what&#39;s laying around. &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just have fun with it and keep on reading.<br/>

  Could you describe a little more about Explode the Code? <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My older daughter LOVED Judy Blume books.  Just a few weeks ago she <br/>
introduced me to a series of books by Barbara Parks, the Junie B. Jones series.  They <br/>
are probably more for a younger age 4 and up, well I thought they were pretty <br/>
cute and funny and I&#39;m a lot older than four.<br/>
<br/>
They are not as long as most Judy Blume books which makes them less of a <br/>
challenge and more fun for a new reader.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters kids LOVE them to be read to them and can&#39;t wait for the next <br/>
installment and sometimes beg for her to continue until the very end all in one <br/>
sitting.  This is 24 four five and six year olds, who don&#39;t often sit still <br/>
long for much.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would share as I had never heard of these books before she <br/>
brought them over to read to ME!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; whats it like having a 9 year gap? Will the baby eat the lego?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was an only child until just before my ninth birthday. When my little <br/>
sister was born, I took her to school for share day! LOL Well hey, if Bobby can <br/>
bring in his turtle and pass it around, I was very proud of my families new baby, <br/>
so why couldn&#39;t I bring in a new born human? The teacher said she never <br/>
thought about that and allowed me to have my mom bring her to my class. We still <br/>
laugh about it today. Sharing a human being such a big deal. <br/>
<br/>
But my sister never ate a lego or anything else that was mine. She did, <br/>
however, once use a marker to color in my comforter. We have always been very <br/>
close, but in the last 5 or 6 years one could say we are now extremely close. It <br/>
seems that as we get older, the gap in our age is closing. I was always very <br/>
maternal where she was concerned and even though we went through some rough times <br/>
when the gap seemed just too large to understand each other, it&#39;s almost <br/>
disappearing now. Sorry to say I&#39;m 33, she&#39;s 24. She still calls on me when she&#39;s <br/>
looking for maternal-like protection or advice when she doesn&#39;t want our <br/>
mother involved. And I still get into that mode where she&#39;s concerned. <br/>
<br/>
We love each other very much. Your children will too. Good luck to you.<br/>

<br/>
My granddaughter is 6 years older than her next sibling.  I don&#39;t think she<br/>
lost out on much with having a new baby in the house, and she gained a lot<br/>
in terms of learning about birth and babies first hand.  This last year has<br/>
been harder for her, with a new baby as well as the toddler.  Her parents<br/>
have made a big effort to keep her involved in lots of outside stuff and<br/>
friends (she&#39;s a social butterfly) and that&#39;s helped.  And now the toddler<br/>
is getting to be fun to play with, at least some of the time.  I think you<br/>
need to always consider ways to get the older ones time and attention from<br/>
you, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something you need to stress about.  And wearing<br/>
the baby will help lots.<br/>

wherever they are, and the baby can&#39;t reach the Lego.<br/>
<br/>
And it could happen that one of the older kids will get the baby- bug and <br/>
really like taking care of the baby.  That sometimes happens, and in YOUR kids&#39; <br/>
case, they would be big enough to carry the baby, too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132435724">My sister and I were also nine years apart, I am the older one.  She and I have gotten along much better than the siblings that were closer to my age (my oldest brother is eighteen months younger than me and we hated each other until I was like seventeen).  I have the same kind of maternal feelings toward her mentioned earlier.  I was not jealous of her at all growing up, but in fact I was brimming with joy that I had a baby to play with and a sister to boot!  I do wish my mother had slinged her though, because I could never keep her out of my stuff.  But my mother always helped clean up any baby messes.  My two boys are 3.5 years apart, and our last one will come when our oldest is about six or seven.  I don&#39;t see any problem with large age gaps.  Your kids will feel your love.  I had a friend once whose daughter was ten when she was surprised with her second pregnancy, and the daughter did have some fears of being replaced as &quot;her special little girl,&quot; but everything was resolved<br/>
 with simple dialogue and quality time.  Sorry about the length, my only real piece of advice is just like with everything else: relax and enjoy!<br/>

line on the books. I haven&#39;t read those books in well over a decade. Now I&#39;ll <br/>
have to go upstairs and pull them out to read them and see if they no longer <br/>
touch me the way they did as a kid. If not, I admit I will be sad. It&#39;s kind of <br/>
like when you went somewhere as a very small child and when you go back as an <br/>
adult it seems so small in comparison to your child-memory. Perhaps if the <br/>
attitudes are bothersome to me now, maybe the good memories of childhood can <br/>
override the emotions. I have never read Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle to the twins. Which <br/>
may now be a good thing. Or perhaps if I did it would open up an extremely large <br/>
discussion. Hmmmm, I must ponder...<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who will attempt to do the stairs at some point today, but the <br/>
apprehension that Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle will disappoint her as an adult, is <br/>
overwhelming her now. :-(<br/>

Oh, yes, my babies were always toted around in a baby sling - we went everywhere together. And some of the older ones loved playing with the babies - added to their current interests! lol!  Ann Lahrson-Fisher&#39;s book &quot;Fundamentals of Homeschooling - Notes on Successful Family Living&quot; has an unschooling-ish bent and also has a great chapter on living well with big kids and little kids - Chapter 23 A Toddler in the Homeschool...Leonie<br/>
