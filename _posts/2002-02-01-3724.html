<div id="ygrps-yiv-946390957">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this has not much to do with unschooling per se, except that perhaps <br/>
some of you may have faced the same question, so I beg for your experienced <br/>
wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested in ideas about how to avoid sleep deprivation (in me). My son <br/>
(nearly 12) and husband are both early risers (husband up at 5:30 a.m., son <br/>
shortly thereafter). My daughter (2) is a VERY late stayer-upper. I am a very <br/>
light sleeper. We have a very small (2-bedroom) house. I thought it was <br/>
clever to colocate the early risers in the other bedroom, leaving the night <br/>
owl with me, but despite this plan, I still end up waking up whenever my son <br/>
and husband do (perhaps I am a closet early-riser?). And once awake, I&#39;m the <br/>
sort who can&#39;t fall back asleep. Things weren&#39;t so bad until my daughter <br/>
began eschewing her afternoon nap (when I could catch up on mine, too, as <br/>
long as I could completely darken the room and the groundskeeper for Sengen <br/>
didn&#39;t come to bang away in the garage [we live in a barn cottage that is <br/>
over the garage for an old 19th-century estate]).<br/>
<br/>
One thing that may be important is that my daughter wants to be <br/>
full-on-engaged with someone when she is awake. Thus, she doesn&#39;t just play <br/>
happily by herself, but will continue to wake people up to play with her. I <br/>
figured since my husband has to go to work all day and be functional, it <br/>
isn&#39;t fair to ask him to be the one to be woken up until 2 or 3 in the <br/>
morning with her. I also don&#39;t think it would be fair of me to try waking her <br/>
up with us first thing in the morning in order to try to &quot;make her adjust&quot; <br/>
(as some friends/family have suggested), since she needs and deserves her <br/>
sleep, too.<br/>
<br/>
I figured that eventually, having interesting stuff go on in the house in the <br/>
mornings when she was still asleep (she generally sleeps until 11 or so) <br/>
would pique her interest and gradually have her up, too, but that&#39;s not the <br/>
case.<br/>
<br/>
Ideas? (Short of moving to another, bigger house -- we&#39;d love to do that one, <br/>
but can&#39;t afford to right now...) (We tried all three of us in one bedroom <br/>
and her in another, but then she just wakes us *all* up in search of a <br/>
playmate.) <br/>
<br/>
And opinions: is it unreasonable of me to ask my husband to plan some trip <br/>
with the children some weekend and take them by himself for the sole purpose <br/>
of me getting sleep and cleaning the house? (housecleaning appears to be the <br/>
thing that falls by the wayside when I&#39;m way-tired. My son and husband do <br/>
their own laundry, but they are not big cleaners. I get ooked out when things <br/>
aren&#39;t clean -- clutter isn&#39;t a problem, dirt is.) Or is that just too <br/>
irresponsible/selfish of me?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Two things helped me in this situation: (1) A small fan running in the <br/>
bedroom to create background noise to cover whatever noise from the rest <br/>
of the house that was waking me. It just sits there on the dresser <br/>
pointed at the ceiling humming away. (2) Strenuous activity.  In my <br/>
quest to make it to old age comfortably and walking, I started going to <br/>
the gym regularly and cycling long distances. Besides the marked <br/>
improvement in my health, I found that I sleep *much* more soundly. I am <br/>
now famous for ability to fall asleep sitting up in a chair at park <br/>
day.  How to find the time to do this activity with a 2 year old is a <br/>
different question...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it is irresponsible or selfish.  But I think it is <br/>
unreasonable or at least beside the point.  I can see encouraging your <br/>
husband to activities with the kids to develop interaction with them <br/>
that are unique, rewarding, exclusive, and specially theirs. I think <br/>
this is necessity to *his* healthy relationship with the kids.  A <br/>
byproduct of these activities might be personal time for you to do what <br/>
you think is important. If that is to sleep and clean, great. To make it <br/>
the sole purpose just seems needlessly mercenary. Time that is <br/>
exclusively your own to do whatever, seems elemental and a major <br/>
component to good mental health to me.  Working this time into the life <br/>
of the family regularly for each member is important and for me, needs <br/>
to be organic to the family.  If it is an event that has to be planned, <br/>
it undermines the value of the ruse activity and doesn&#39;t become a part <br/>
of regular healthy family life.<br/>
<br/>
I would also be encouraging your husband and kids to help with the dirt <br/>
or anything else that ookes you out. I have found that being a slave to <br/>
other peoples dirt just makes me resentful. That, or I adjust my <br/>
relationship with the dirt.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100095105">Do you have a neighbor of a middlin&#39; age (12?13?) who could take her for a <br/>
walk or over to the neighbor&#39;s house to play or watch videos or color or some <br/>
kid-to-kid activity (LIKE babysitting, but not as solely-responsible, since <br/>
in case of emergency the kid&#39;s mom AND you would be right close)?  I used to <br/>
do that a fair amount when Holly was a baby and Marty and Kirby were no <br/>
longer nap-takers.  But I was lucky enough to have a homeschooled family four <br/>
houses up.<br/>
<br/>
Can the baby be induced to run, run, run, jump, jump, jump and get tired <br/>
sooner?  Have you tried the traditional hot bath, warm drink, dark room, <br/>
&quot;tranquilty&quot; massage oil, and lullaby tape?  I&#39;ve oiled/darked/musicked kids <br/>
to sleep from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
And the last part isn&#39;t immediate:  this won&#39;t last forever.  Soon she&#39;ll be <br/>
able to watch a video, turn it off, and then get in bed quietly.  Or, maybe, <br/>
put a tv/vcr in the bedroom, put on something you know she likes, and fall <br/>
asleep.  Put a timer on the TV to turn it off in two hours, or whatever.  She <br/>
might fall asleep before the video&#39;s over.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has been a night owl since he was in diapers.  Maybe that&#39;s one reason <br/>
I&#39;m so sure videos won&#39;t kill a kid&#39;s creativity or energy level.  And they <br/>
saved him from much insult and parental negativity.    Now that he&#39;s a teen, <br/>
he sleeps eight or ten hours.  when he was little, never.  I assume that <br/>
after his growth cycle settles out some he&#39;ll end up the kind of adult who <br/>
can stay up til after midnight and get to work at 6:30 or 7:00.  I&#39;ve always <br/>
been one.<br/>

<br/>
I dont&#39; think your being selfish at all.  But if you feel that way maybe just <br/>
ask<br/>
for an overnighter.  But that will only help you catch up this time.  If you <br/>
turn out the lights will she go to sleep with you or keep playing?  Have you<br/>
tried taking a nap with her during the day?  I napped with my kiddos and<br/>
when the oldest stopped napping but  the other two still did, I would play<br/>
a video quietly in our room while we slept and she played quietly.  My kids<br/>
stay up late because I am up and they want to be with me.  If I want them<br/>
to go to bed earlier I have to.  I keep telling myself I am going to do that.<br/>
Maybe I will tonight as I was up til 12:30 and up again at 4:30-5:00 with dh!<br/>
PS. two is really shortlived.  She is young--LLL famous saying ---This too<br/>
shall pass--really it will : )  AND it sounds like you need more sleep than<br/>
you do house cleaning, get yourself rested before you worry about the<br/>
rest.  Maybe you can pay ds to do some extra cleaning for you around<br/>
the house?  Or ask him to take dd outside to play while you take a short <br/>
nap/breather?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has been 14 years since I&#39;ve had a full night&#39;s sleep, but I am<br/>
a past master in the art of finding times and places to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this list, although we&#39;re in our 9th year of unschooling.<br/>
My children are 21, 13, 9, 6 and 2.<br/>
<br/>
My eldest (now 13) was a born night owl.  Her wide-awake time in<br/>
infancy was 1-3am.  She still prefers to be up until 2 or 3am and<br/>
then sleep until noon, but she stopped needing company at night<br/>
around age 7.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;One thing that may be important is that my daughter wants to be <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So do you need and deserve your sleep.  When I don&#39;t get enough sleep<br/>
consistently, I get zomboid and short-tempered.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had some success with waking my children a little earlier<br/>
at a time in an effort to reset their sleep schedules.  We usually<br/>
do this because we have a morning activity that we need to get <br/>
to, but we sometimes do this so my husband (who has to get up <br/>
early-ish) can get enough sleep.<br/>
<br/>
The children can handle being awakened 15 minutes earlier than <br/>
usual, especially if we take the time to cuddle and wake up slowly.  <br/>
It does take a week or so to move our sleep schedules back an hour.<br/>
<br/>
When I get to the point where I&#39;m non-functional from lack of<br/>
sleep, I ask my husband to take some of the night shifts.<br/>
<br/>
Before I had so many kids, I used to plot to find ways to take naps.<br/>
Even 20 minutes can make a world of difference.  On weekends, my husband<br/>
would cover for me while I napped.  On weekdays, I&#39;d set the kids up<br/>
with a quiet activity and doze in the bed or in a chair.  Sometimes,<br/>
we&#39;d read quietly together in bed, and the kids would fall asleep<br/>
with me.<br/>
<br/>
I still get in the odd catnap, usually in the rocking chair in<br/>
front of the fire.  I sit there to breastfeed my 2-year-old, and<br/>
before I know it, someone is calling my name and I&#39;m opening<br/>
my eyes, yawning.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not irresponsible or selfish to see that your needs get met.<br/>
Everyone in the family deserves to have their needs met, including<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know whether asking your husband to take the children away<br/>
for the weekend is the best solution for your family.  If you start<br/>
talking it over, however, you can probably come up with a family<br/>
solution that meets everyone&#39;s needs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Can&#39;t help you with sleep deprivation.  I am<br/>
chronically there.<br/>
<br/>
BUT it is only fair that DH take both children for<br/>
lots of the time, and not only on &quot;a weekend&quot; when it<br/>
is convenient and he doesn&#39;t have something else to<br/>
do.  And you shouldn&#39;t have to allocate the time to<br/>
official sleep and produce noticeable housecleaning<br/>
results.  You have my permission to loll (dunno how to<br/>
spell that: lie in) in the tub, eat chocolate, watch a<br/>
movie, sort your OWN clothing, look at catalogues, do<br/>
info searches on the net, or anything else you want,<br/>
including dance, work out, nothing, meditate, talk on<br/>
the phone, visit somebody, or write letter, sort<br/>
photographs, play music that YOU like, read....or even<br/>
go shopping and actually try on something before you<br/>
buy it. It&#39;s OK.  But, if you have to ASK DH for the<br/>
time, you may not get it. And NEVER leave your<br/>
children with someone who doesn&#39;t want to be with<br/>
them.  Including relatives. You do deserve some time<br/>
for yourself.  But you might not get it.<br/>
<br/>
When my boys were little I sometimes put a quilt on<br/>
the floor.....for me.  At least I could lie down, they<br/>
usually would cuddle up, too.  Guess I was lucky, like<br/>
you, I was/am a light sleeper.  No little ones running<br/>
about without me awake..... <br/>
<br/>
Sharon of the Swamp  May I join the band? but I don&#39;t<br/>
don&#39;t like the term &quot;hooters&quot; How about just &quot;Stone<br/>
Nekkid ?<br/>
