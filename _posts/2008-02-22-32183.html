I guess I posted it just as another example of a natural part of life being<br/>
labeled as something needing to be<br/>
&#39;fixed&#39; with medication.   I was just so surprised to read about staying up<br/>
late & sleeping in - something I<br/>
do on a regular basis, by the way - in just such a negative way & in such<br/>
black & white terms.<br/>

It&#39;s crazy, isn&#39;t it?  That preferences and personal differences  <br/>
become &quot;syndromes&quot; and &quot;disabilities&quot; and that?<br/>
