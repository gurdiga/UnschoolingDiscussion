<div id="ygrps-yiv-72476945">Hello,<br/>
I have been a member of your group for a bit, and have just been reading and <br/>
enjoying all your emails. So now I have some questions.<br/>
How does unschooling really work? <br/>
Do you do nothing unless the child initiates it?<br/>
I have been homeschooling for 9 years. We have 8 children, the oldest <br/>
graduating this past May. Do I still teach my little ones to read? How do <br/>
they pick up on it themselves?<br/>
After all these years of homeschooling I have decided I hate textbooks. I&#39;m <br/>
tired of making out assignments for 5 children, making them do boring <br/>
meaningless work. I dislike so much about that, but I&#39;ve always felt &quot;Big <br/>
Brother&quot; looming over me and just couldn&#39;t break free of it. If my family or <br/>
neighbors found out I was not &quot;doing school&quot; like it was done in the school <br/>
system, they would report me for neglect.<br/>
This year I have told my 17dd that she didn&#39;t have to do math anymore (she <br/>
hates math) unless she wanted to. We just have never been able to get through <br/>
a pre-algebra textbook (Saxon). We&#39;ve tried 4 times! She is so happy. She <br/>
loves to read and work on crafts. Egypt and Atlantis are biggies for her <br/>
right now. <br/>
I am taking baby steps toward unschooling. I am a voracious reader and am <br/>
checking out large quantities of books about unschooling. I am a bit nervous. <br/>
If I went into the kitchen right now and told my kids they never had to have <br/>
school again, they would be thrilled and immediately veg out in front of the <br/>
tv or nintendo. How do you keep your kids from just doing nothing?<br/>
As you can see, I have many questions. This really seems to be what I want to <br/>
do, but I&#39;m just plain old s-c-a-r-e-d to take the plunge. Please help me <br/>
with your advice. <br/>

<br/>
Not if you&#39;re not being neglectful they won&#39;t.<br/>
Tell them you&#39;re doing unit studies if that will ease them into the idea.  I <br/>
do the unit of everything. &lt;g&gt;  &quot;The Universal Unit!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can still keep a list of activities, movies you watched, books people <br/>
used/read/checked out, places you went, projects and hobbies people worked <br/>
on, if you&#39;re afraid of the friends and relatives.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This year I have told my 17dd that she didn&#39;t have to do math anymore (she <br/>
hates math) unless she wanted to. We just have never been able to get through <br/>
a pre-algebra textbook (Saxon). We&#39;ve tried 4 times! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If she were in high school they might have told her that two years ago.  If <br/>
they only required two math units to graduate...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She loves to read and work on crafts. Egypt and Atlantis are biggies for <br/>
her <br/>
right now. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If she even just talks to the other kids about what she&#39;s discovering about <br/>
those things you can &quot;count it&quot; for all of them.<br/>
<br/>
And eventually you can stop counting anything.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I went into the kitchen right now and told my kids they never had to <br/>
have <br/>
school again, they would be thrilled and immediately veg out in front of the <br/>
tv or nintendo. How do you keep your kids from just doing nothing?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t.  They can watch all they want.  And if you just LET them, they&#39;ll <br/>
play Nintendo (although I don&#39;t consider it vegging out at all) or watch TV <br/>
(where they&#39;ll see all kinds of things to think about and ask about and think <br/>
about and connect) and they might seem to be &quot;doing nothing,&quot; but I seriously <br/>
doubt it will ever be &quot;nothing.&quot; Even if it&#39;s waiting or resting or <br/>
daydreaming or thinking or meditating, it&#39;s not nothing.<br/>
<br/>
They won&#39;t just do the same thing forever.  Nobody does unless they&#39;re really <br/>
emotionally wounded.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This really seems to be what I want to do, but I&#39;m just plain old <br/>
s-c-a-r-e-d to take the plunge. Please help me with your advice. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One good trick is to &quot;Take a month off.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people tell their kids this when they first take them out of school.  <br/>
And in  a way you&#39;re taking yours out of school, but it won&#39;t be so obvious <br/>
to them.  You could tell them you want to JUST take a break.<br/>
<br/>
But during the break you could be doing things you think you&#39;d like to be <br/>
doing if you keep on having that break for years.  And you can see their <br/>
reaction to things which are &quot;just for fun&quot; and not intended to be <br/>
educational.<br/>
<br/>
Because even you yourself have divided the world into &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;not <br/>
learning&quot; and &quot;work&quot; and &quot;nothing&quot; for so long, it might be harder for you <br/>
than it will be for them.  The next issue of Home Education Magazine is going <br/>
to have at least two articles on deschooling.  If you haven&#39;t yet subscribed <br/>
to HEM, this might be the perfect time to do that!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I did not teach my children to read.  Holly surprised me by being slow to <br/>
read even though she&#39;s VERY verbal, has a big vocabulary and has liked to <br/>
write since she was very young.  Today she was reading Harry Potter cards, <br/>
though, and only missed a few words.  Usually a long word with lots of vowels <br/>
but only one or two syllable will stump her.<br/>
<br/>
I have something I think you should definitely read.  Go to <br/>
www.unschooling.com and click on &quot;library&quot; at the left.  It&#39;s an article by <br/>
my friend and my former La Leche League leader Carol Rice.  I know her four <br/>
kids REALLY very well.  The girls are at my house at least once a week.  We <br/>
were in a babysitting co-op together.  Our families have known each other <br/>
since Kirby was four months old and her kids were all pre-readers, so I can <br/>
vouch for all she says.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I call this, *What Moly Really Did That Day She Spent &#39;Vegging&#39; on the Couch*<br/>
I apologize to anyone who has read this, I wrote something similar on another <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
The other day Moly was vegging on the couch, watching a video on apes but, <br/>
while watching, what really interested her was the jungle, and how cool all <br/>
the plants are. So she got some books and fliped channels between the <br/>
National Geographic, history, and discovery channels. She found things on <br/>
tropical plants, she learned about the rain forests, logging practices, <br/>
endangered species, poaching, illegal capture and sale of exotic birds and <br/>
other wild life, the medicinal values of certain plants, the tribes of people <br/>
and their cultures, how they make their huts, whether they are <br/>
hunter/gatherers or farmers, why they decorate their bodies the way they do, <br/>
why do people all around the world use piercing and tattoos as expression, <br/>
why has this become such a fad in America... All this from vegging on the <br/>
couch! Jack got in on the discussion too, and we called their Uncle in <br/>
Georgia who is a tattoo artist, and he told the kids some interesting things. <br/>
Then we had a discussion of how to run a business. That is unschooling, (to <br/>
me anyway) and Moly spent a good part of the day on the couch. To the casual <br/>
observer, I am sure it would have looked like we sat around and did nothing <br/>
all day. <br/>
<br/>
When I was a child, we traveled a lot because of my Dad&#39;s job. We also got to <br/>
live in some real exotic places, so many times when my kids are just sitting <br/>
around, they are going through all my things. It amazes me what they learn <br/>
just by doing that. My Mom just gave me all the National Geographic Magazines <br/>
they have collected over the years. My grandparents started the collection <br/>
back in the 30&#39;s. I really hope my kids find some time to *veg out* with some <br/>
of those. Vegging out can be a good thing. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003258818"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;How does unschooling really work?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very well!!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Do you do nothing unless the child initiates it?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well no, I still have a life to live. ;-) If you mean do I do no <br/>
&quot;schoolwork&quot; unless my child initiates it, then I &#39;d have to say we do no <br/>
schoolwork at all! What we do is look at the world as one big interesting <br/>
place that is fun and interesting to learn about. We explore it together. <br/>
Sometimes I suggest an activity, sometimes they do. There&#39;s just no hidden <br/>
requirement that every activity have a &quot;learning goal&quot; or that it must even <br/>
be completed in a certain way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I have been homeschooling for 9 years. We have 8 children, the oldest <br/>
&gt;&gt;graduating this past May. Do I still teach my little ones to read? How do <br/>
&gt;&gt;they pick up on it themselves?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s counterproductive to sit little children down with lessons. It <br/>
takes all the joy and exploration out of the process. Your little ones will <br/>
learn to read because it&#39;s a fun and useful life skill. They&#39;ll pick up on <br/>
it by being surrounded with the printed word, by being read to, by having <br/>
their questions answered right as they think of them, by trying to figure <br/>
out roadsigns and t-shirt sayings, by playing with games, by playing around <br/>
with words with you. Unschooling does NOT mean ignore them. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll <br/>
be doing all sorts of activities with them that involve reading. They&#39;ll <br/>
learn!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;After all these years of homeschooling I have decided I hate textbooks. <br/>
&gt;&gt;I&#39;m tired of making out assignments for 5 children, making them do boring <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hurray for you and hurray for your kids!<br/>
<br/>

&gt;&gt;have school again, they would be thrilled and immediately veg out in front <br/>
&gt;&gt;of the tv or nintendo.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe for awhile, but not forever. I myself have been know to veg out on <br/>
occassion. :o) Sometimes we need that time to recharge, relax and regroup. <br/>
They most especially will need time to deschool. Even school-at-home is <br/>
school. Give them time to get out of that mindset. Give them time to get <br/>
used to making their own choices about how they&#39;ll spend their time. For <br/>
awhile it may very well be TV or Nintendo, but they&#39;ll get tired of it <br/>
eventually. And they&#39;ll have had time to think about what other things <br/>
they&#39;d really like to do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;How do you keep your kids from just doing nothing?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We all need our down times. And even when a kid looks like they&#39;re doing <br/>
nothing, they&#39;re doing something. It&#39;s just not a something that looks like <br/>
schoolwork.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;As you can see, I have many questions. This really seems to be what I want <br/>
&gt;&gt;to do, but I&#39;m just plain old s-c-a-r-e-d to take the plunge. Please help <br/>
&gt;&gt;me with your advice.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Go for it! You&#39;ve given the school-at-home thing a try and you&#39;re feeling <br/>
burned out and disillusioned by it. Go ahead and give real life a try <br/>
without textbooks and curriculums. Your kids will amaze you with what they <br/>
will learn by just being a part of this world. We&#39;re all learning all the <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
