<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699152244">***I was talking to Keith last night about autographed books.   I don&#39;t<br/>
like to <br/>
have them.&lt;g&gt;  ***<br/>
<br/>
I have two signed John Holt books.  They weren&#39;t inscribed to me, I found<br/>
them at book sales but I have so liked to look at his little signature<br/>
and imagine that book in his hands.  That&#39;s book AND author worship I<br/>
admit to.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One is &quot;Teach Your Own&quot;  and inside he wrote &quot;to Priscilla good luck John<br/>
Holt&quot;.<br/>
The other is Escape From Childhood and he wrote &quot;to John Chinn thanks &<br/>
good luck peace John Holt May 3, 1974&quot;<br/>
No punctuation except the little comma after May 3.  He didn&#39;t string it<br/>
together like that he wrote each separate thought on it&#39;s own line:<br/>
<br/>
to John Chinn<br/>
thanks & good luck<br/>
peace<br/>
John Holt<br/>
May 3, 1974<br/>
<br/>
Those books have good ju ju for me.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
