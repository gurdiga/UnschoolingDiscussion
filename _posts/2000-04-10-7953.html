I feel lucky nursing worked out well for me since I was not supported in the <br/>
endeavor oh so long ago when I had my first baby at 22! But I know it takes <br/>
much more than feeding method to make a good mama! Whatever a mother can <br/>
manage in her circumstances is the best she can do, and I would never judge <br/>
another mom-not after 4 children and having done many of those things I swore <br/>
I never would!<br/>
