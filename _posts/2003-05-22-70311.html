&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;John 3:16<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;In the city of Chicago, one cold, dark night, a blizzard was  setting in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;little boy was selling newspapers on the corner the  people were in and<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;of the cold. The little boy was so cold  that he wasn&#39;t trying to sell<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; many<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;papers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;He walked up to a policeman and said, &quot;Mister, you wouldn&#39;t  happen to<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; know<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;where a poor boy could find a warm place to sleep  tonight would you? You<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;see, I sleep in a box up around the corner  there and down the alley and<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;it&#39;s awful cold in there for tonight. Sure would be nice to have a warm<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;place to  stay,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;The policeman looked down at the little boy and said, &quot;you go  down the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;street to that big white house and you knock on the door.  When they come<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;out the door you just say John 3:16, and they will let you  in.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;So he did. He walked up the steps and knocked on the door, and a  lady<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;answered. He looked up and said, &quot;John 3:16.&quot; The lady said,  &quot;Come on in,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Son.&quot; She took him in and she sat him down in a  split bottom rocker in<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;front of a great big old fireplace,  and she went off. The boy sat there<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;a while and thought to  himself: John 3:16.... I don&#39;t understand it, but<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;sure makes a  cold boy  warm.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Later she came back and asked him &quot;Are you hungry?&quot; He said,  &quot;Well, just<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;little. I haven&#39;t eaten in a couple ofdays, and I guess  I could stand a<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;little bit of food,&quot; The lady took  him in  the kitchen and sat him down<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;a table full of  wonderful food. He ate and ate until he couldn&#39;t eat any<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;more. Then he  thought to himself: John 3:16... Boy, I sure don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; understand<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;it  but it sure makes a hungry  boy full.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;She took him upstairs to a bathroom to a huge bathtub filled with  warm<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;water, and he sat there and soaked for a while. As he  soaked, he thought<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;himself: John 3:16... I sure  don&#39;t understand it, but it sure makes a<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; dirty<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;boy clean. You  know, I&#39;ve not had a bath, a real bath, in my whole life.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;The  only bath I ever had was when I stood in front of that big old  fire<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;hydrant as they flushed it  out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;The lady came in and got him. She took him to a room, tucked him  into a<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; big<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;old feather bed, pulled the covers up around his neck,  kissed him<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; goodnight<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;and turned out the lights. As he lay in the  darkness and looked out the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;window at the snow coming down on that cold  night, he thought to himself:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;John 3:16... I don&#39;t understand it but it  sure makes a tired boy  rested.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;The next morning the lady came back up and took him down again to  that<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; same<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;big table full of food. After he ate, she took him back  to that same big<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;old split bottom rocker in front of  the fireplace and picked up a big old<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Bible. She sat down in  front of him and looked into his young  face.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;Do  you understand John 3:16?&quot; she asked gently.  He replied,&quot;No, Ma&#39;am,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;don&#39;t. The first time I ever heard it was last night when the policeman<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; told<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;me to use it,&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;She opened the Bible to John 3:16 and began to explain to  him about<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Jesus.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Right there, in front of that big old fireplace, he gave his  heart and<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; life<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;to Jesus. He sat there and thought: John 3:16.... I don&#39;t  understand<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; it,but<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;it sure makes a lost boy feel  safe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;You know, I have to confess I don&#39;t understand it either, how God was<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;willing to send His Son to die for me, and how Jesus would agree to do<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; such<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;a thing. I don&#39;t understand the agony of the Father and every  angel in<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;heaven as they watched Jesus suffer and die. I don&#39;t  understand the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; intense<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;love for ME that kept Jesus on the cross till  the end. I don&#39;t understand<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;it, but it sure does make  lifeworth living.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;John 3:16 For God so loved the world,that he gave his only begotten  Son,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have  everlasting<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;life.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;If you aren&#39;t ashamed to do this, please follow the directions. Jesus<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; said,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;If you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you before my  Father.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pass<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;this on only if you mean it. I do Love God. He is my  source of existence.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;He keeps me functioning each and every day. Phil  4:13<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;If you love God and are not ashamed ofall the marvelous things he has<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; done<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;for you, send this  on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Take 60 seconds &give this a shot! Let&#39;s just see if Satan stops  this<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;All you do is  --<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;1)           Simply say a small prayer for the person who sent you<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;this, (Father,  God bless this person in whatever itis that You know he or<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;she may be  needing this  day!).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;2)          Then send it on to five other people. Within hours five<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;people have  prayed for you, and you caused a multitude of people to pray<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;God for other  people. Then sit back and watch the power of God work in<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;life for  doing the thing that you know He loves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Against John&#39;s rules? Or Jesus&#39;s rules? I don&#39;t think they had Usborne books<br/>
back then. They probably didn&#39;t have chain letters either.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the list rules!<br/>
<br/>
No rules. But it *is* common courtesy not send chain letters. Among other<br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
Like unschooling, people read and learn from experience what is appropriate<br/>
to the list and their judgement is pretty much right on the money. *Except*<br/>
when they&#39;re pushing some other agenda.<br/>
