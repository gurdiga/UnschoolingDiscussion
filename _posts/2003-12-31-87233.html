<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002432972">** But it&#39;s not the museum that does it, if the mom can go to a museum for <br/>
fun,<br/>
or go to a zoo without preaching and teaching, just go there to have fun and<br/>
look at the best stuff and ignore the rest.**<br/>
<br/>
Well yeah, that was part of the point. But that still only works if the <br/>
kid(s) haven&#39;t had museums made painful and boring for them by school field trips <br/>
with insipid pointless worksheets, being herded away just as they found <br/>
something interesting, and droning guides who always seemed to concentrate on the <br/>
most inane details. If mom has also tried in the past to turn museum visits into <br/>
an &quot;educational experience&quot;, the kid may simply not be able to relax enough to <br/>
give it a try, and it isn&#39;t likely at all to sound to him like something more <br/>
interesting and cooler than watching tv. Not at first. Not until mom&#39;s built <br/>
up some credit with him for suggesting cool stuff that actually turned out to <br/>
BE cool. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m certainly not putting down museums. Museums in general are some of my <br/>
family&#39;s favorite places on earth. One of my kids&#39; first questions about any <br/>
place they learn we&#39;re going to visit is &quot;Are there any cool museums there?&quot; But <br/>
I&#39;m well aware that for a lot of families the idea that their kids might find a <br/>
museum visit to be &quot;cool&quot; sounds like utter fantasy - I&#39;m saying, okay, save <br/>
that till you can all go with fresh eyes. Build up trust with your kids. Maybe <br/>
make your first museum visit as an unschooler to someplace none of you have <br/>
ever been to before. Watch for visiting exhibits on something your kids are <br/>
really interested in, or on something you haven&#39;t ever thought of as <br/>
&quot;educational&quot;. TV, maybe - :)<br/>
<br/>
And if your kids haven&#39;t been to school and you haven&#39;t done the &quot;educational <br/>
trip&quot; thingie on them - don&#39;t ever start. Go to museums and have fun <br/>
together. Skip the worksheets from the educational department (but check out the loan <br/>
boxes sometime and maybe poke through the library if you get a chance). Pick <br/>
things to look at because they interest you or a kid, not because you think <br/>
it&#39;s something they ought to know. Move on when someone gets bored. Spend the <br/>
whole visit in one spot if that&#39;s what the kid wants to do.   <br/>
<br/>
**Family memberships are WONDERFUL because if you want to go and just do one<br/>
single thing, you didn&#39;t &quot;waste money.&quot; We&#39;ve gone to the state science <br/>
museum<br/>
just to use the microscopes, and we&#39;ve gone to the zoo just to feed the ducks<br/>
and fish or just to look at the monkeys.**<br/>
<br/>
Also, memberships at museums with ASTC membership give you &quot;visiting <br/>
priveleges&quot; at many other member museums, which makes it easy and painless to decide <br/>
to drop into a new museum for just a quick visit while travelling. For <br/>
instance, this summer we stopped into the Louisville (KY) Science Center for about an <br/>
hour while we were driving by on our way from Cincinnatti OH to Olney IL, <br/>
because my son had seen a billboard advertising a temporary exhibit that <br/>
interested him. It was easy to do without worrying that it might not be worth it.<br/>
<br/>
I try to always keep up a membership with the excellent smaller natural <br/>
history museum two counties west of us (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.burpee.org/)">http://www.burpee.org/)</a> - we then get <br/>
regular notices of the goings on there (including a very cool annual dinosaur fest <br/>
where the kids get to meet working paleontologists) and feel the satisfaction <br/>
of helping a smaller institution, plus we can use the reciprocal membership <br/>
benefits at museums in Chicago and Milwaukee (we&#39;re pretty much half way in <br/>
between).<br/>
<br/>
Currently Patrick is irritated with me because we haven&#39;t been able to fit a <br/>
visit to the Health World museum into our schedule this month, and he&#39;s aching <br/>
to visit the Grossology exhibit. I messed up. Monday.<br/>

sit and read it head to toe while the kids &quot;do nothing&quot;. This could be <br/>
a very liberating experience. I HAD TO DO IT (those hads, heh heh) <br/>
because my kids looooooove the AMNH (Museum of Natural History) with <br/>
their dinosaurs and all but I kept getting in their way. So we got an <br/>
annual membership and now I have no reason to get in the way --we can <br/>
always go back for more. So we sometimes go there to have lunch and <br/>
hang out. Or they want to go to a particular exhibit, like the Whale <br/>
Room, and play I Spy Nemo. Or we go to the Discovery Room where they <br/>
get to play with microscopes and what not. I always bring something to <br/>
read. I stay close in case they need me or I&#39;ll wander with them 10 <br/>
steps behind, but the freedom of exploring, that I can see, is what <br/>
they value the most. I just have to remind myself that my job is to <br/>
ensure they have that freedom, not to show them how much I know.<br/>

<br/>
There are sometimes worksheets out in at the door, with the exhibit flyer and <br/>
my kids look and laugh, because the questions are inane.   They&#39;re not <br/>
designed to do anything but prove that the kids scanned the whole room, and they DO <br/>
scan.  They end up ignoring important and interesting things just to find <br/>
their answers.   Just like answering the questions at the end of a chapter, only <br/>
worse.  One question for the cool Canadian sports exhibit was &quot;Which exhibit <br/>
had a green ball?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The greeness of that ball had NOTHING to do with the game, with physics, <br/>
history, materials, folklore, it had nothing to do with anything useful.  It was <br/>
trivia of the most useless sort.<br/>
<br/>
But the things the kids came up with on their own were profound and personal, <br/>
at their precise &quot;learning level,&quot; because the things they learn are the <br/>
things they didn&#39;t know but that do tie in to something they were already <br/>
interested in or curious about.<br/>
<br/>
(Ooops.  Preachin&#39; to the choir.  You all knew that.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i did not mean to imply that. I love the museum as well. when I did it <br/>
for a few times, i found myself getting &quot;itchy&quot; and bored.  I&#39;d look at <br/>
the exhibits as well. then the guys started dragging me to their points <br/>
of interest and asking me to read stuff. At first I&#39;d read the whole <br/>
thing and they&#39;d lose interest. so I started asking, what do you want <br/>
me to read, what&#39;s it you want to know? they&#39;d tell: what does X eat? <br/>
where does it live? and I&#39;d look in the plaques for the information and <br/>
read it to them. then off they&#39;d go to find something else. at this <br/>
point, they just wander about, playing tag or pretending to be part of <br/>
the exhibits (ie:, TRexes on the lose) and I just gobble up the stuff <br/>
or read the supplemental materials they have (AMNH has pretty <br/>
interesting stuff for free).<br/>
<br/>
unschooling is not just an experience my kids go through. this is a <br/>
life long experience for my husband and I as well. we&#39;ve been going to <br/>
the dinosaur exhibits way before having kidlets. mark and I went there <br/>
in one of our first dates. we grew up with National Geographic, Mutual <br/>
of Omaha Wild Kingdom and NOVA. that&#39;s why we love the Eyewitness Video <br/>
series and books. they just call to the science kids in us. but just as <br/>
we chose to see those shows as kids, we have to remind ourselves that <br/>
our kids should have the same opportunity. i&#39;m still deschooling, so I <br/>
know that going into teacher mode is still an issue with me.  &quot;doing <br/>
nothing&quot; is actually doing a lot for me. that&#39;s why I put it in <br/>
quotations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-788835132">I read that the LA County Museum of Art (LACMA) rents works of art for about<br/>
$25 -$35 for a month and part of that can be put towards the purchase price<br/>
of an art piece bought through the museum.<br/>
