<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096335338">**Sue, this list has been so still for two days people thought it was broken.**<br/>
<br/>
Yeah!  It was like a spell had frozen everything.  It was like the<br/>
princess was asleep and some ogre and donkey had to come into the room<br/>
and pass gas to break the spell. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So, welcome Sue!<br/>
<br/>
(I suck at analogies and I watched Shrek yesterday.)<br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;re all glad that the curse is broken and we have something to<br/>
talk about.<br/>
