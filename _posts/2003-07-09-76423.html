NEA Debates: &quot;Unfunded Homeschooled Student Participation&quot;<br/>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
Ann:  For some time now, the National Education Association (the <br/>
largest national teachers&#39; union) has written a decisively-worded <br/>
anti-homeschooling resolution at their annual Convention.  So it is <br/>
no surprise that a homeschooling resolution came to the floor again <br/>
this year.<br/>
<br/>
It is stunning, however, to learn that the delegates spent much time <br/>
discussing the Home-Schooling Resolution, debating whether to retain <br/>
or remove a single word - &quot;unfunded.&quot;  Leaving the word in the <br/>
Resolution would have been a radical departure from their usual <br/>
unilateral position against homeschooling.  The long debate suggests <br/>
sharp disagreement in the ranks.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an excerpt from a report from<br/>

Headline:  One Word in Home-Schooling Resolution Causes Long Debate<br/>
&quot;...The most contentious amendment involved the deletion of a single <br/>
word in Resolution B-69, which deals with home-schooling. The <br/>
resolution had a sentence that read: &quot;The Association also believes <br/>
that unfunded home-schooled students should not participate in any <br/>
extracurricular activities in the public schools.&quot; Some states <br/>
provide funding for home-schoolers to participate in after-school <br/>
activities. The amendment was to remove the word &quot;unfunded&quot; so that <br/>
NEA&#39;s opposition would be categorical... the will of the majority of <br/>
delegates was to delete &quot;unfunded,&quot; reasoning that with or without <br/>
the money to do so, they didn&#39;t want home-schoolers in any way to <br/>
edge out those students who were &quot;with us all day.&quot;<br/>

Headline:  Home-Schooled Student Could Be Denied College Diploma<br/>
&quot;According to New York State law, students who are homes schooled <br/>
through high school cannot get their college diploma, because they do <br/>
not have a high school diploma... After being home schooled, [Paul <br/>
Owens] enrolled at MCC. A year later, he received a letter from the <br/>
school notifying him he could not graduate without a high school <br/>
diploma or the equivalent.&quot;<br/>

number of homeschooling students.<br/>

Headline:  Public school drop raises questions<br/>
Subhead: La. enrollment decline bucks national trends<br/>
&quot;Public school enrollment in Louisiana is falling and shows no signs <br/>
of turning around.  The drop during just one period -- from fall 1991 <br/>
to estimates for fall 2005 -- would essentially fill all 91,600 seats <br/>
in Tiger Stadium.  Theories for the decline vary.... Picard blames <br/>
the drop on residents leaving the state, the growth of home schooling <br/>
and smaller families...&quot;<br/>

Headline:  Homeschooling: Teaching Thy Children Well<br/>
&quot;Homeschooling is a misnomer. Learning takes place not only at home, <br/>
but in museums and grocery stores, nature hikes and routine visits to <br/>
the doctor&#39;s office. It may happen around the kitchen table, but it&#39;s <br/>
just as likely to flourish in back yards and gardens, libraries and <br/>
the mall...&quot;<br/>
