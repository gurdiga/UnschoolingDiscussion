I think your definition of healthy is more rigorous than what many people<br/>
consider healthy.  But consider this: I get up most mornings feeling vital<br/>
and alive.  I do not get colds very often, certainly not every one that<br/>
comes along.  Just before leaving the U.S. 15 months ago, I walked 60 miles<br/>
(20/day for 3 days) to raise money for breast cancer research and services.<br/>
I&#39;ve climbed mountains.  Booked tomorrow, how about Sunday?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also about 50 lbs. overweight.  Textbook healthy?  No.  But I fit a<br/>
number of your criteria.<br/>
<br/>
Just what should a body my age be able to do?  There&#39;s a fair range for<br/>
women in their mid-thirties.  Unlike your great-grandma, most folks don&#39;t do<br/>
farm chores.  That&#39;s a fact of life today.  On the other hand, I don&#39;t think<br/>
that most folks start their day with 3 ibuprofen, either.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have no doubt that you, and others who responded to this thread, <br/>
are healthy. My intent was not to say that any one specific person <br/>
was healthy or not. I&#39;m sure on a list like this, we even have a <br/>
greater percentage of healthy people than in the general population. <br/>
It strikes me that homeschoolers that I know are, in general, quite <br/>
active and alive people. But that doesn&#39;t mean that when you walk <br/>
into a WalMart in the middle of America you are going to see the same <br/>
kind of thing. I still believe that most of the people in America are <br/>
not healthy. Not *all* of the people by any scope, but *most*. A <br/>
healthy body fat percentage, for instance, is 18 - 22% for women. The <br/>
*average* American woman is 34%. So in that one instance, and in so <br/>
many others, *most* (again, not all) people in this country are <br/>
simply not healthy. That&#39;s not an indictment of them, or of any <br/>
person specifically, it&#39;s just something I happen to believe is true. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, others can also choose to disagree with me, have a <br/>
different definition of healthy, or whatever. What matters to me is <br/>
that my family is healthy by our own standards, because we are very <br/>
active people and I want my kids to experience what it feels like to <br/>
have a very vital and capable body throughout their whole life. I <br/>
also want them to be able to depend on their own bodies for <br/>
transportation, and all sorts of other physical tasks. Who knows, <br/>
someday that might even be a necessary feature again. I meet people <br/>
in their 50s, 60s, 70s, and beyond who are still doing amazing things <br/>
and it inspires me to feel like that is a possibility in our futures <br/>
as well. So, when I consider what food to buy for our family, and <br/>
what goes into my kids&#39; bodies, my definition of healthy is important <br/>
to that.<br/>

<br/>
Big difference between &quot;most are&quot; (which could be 51%) and the original <br/>
statement (was it nearly no one is healthy?  Virtually all are unhealthy? <br/>
What was the original phrase?).  It sounded more in the 98% range.<br/>
<br/>
My mother in law is nearly 80.  She hiked the Grand Canyon a couple of years <br/>
ago.  She plays golf.  She loves how healthy she is.  She also smokes <br/>
cigarettes sometimes.  She&#39;s also mean.<br/>
<br/>
Give a choice (and hey, I DO have a choice!) I&#39;d rather spend my time with a <br/>
kindly, non-smoking unhealthy person than with my mother in law (or others <br/>
like her).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I totally agree! But I think healthy encompasses mental health, <br/>
spiritual health, more than just bodily health. If a person is truly <br/>
healthy - mind, body, spirit - then they are usually a joy to be <br/>
around. And there are plenty of people on the whole spectrum of <br/>
health to non-health who are fun to hang out with. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a value judgement or a statement of character to say someone <br/>
is healthy or not healthy, or for a person to feel that way about <br/>
themself. One of my good friends about 15 years ago was a guy who <br/>
weighed 400 pounds and could hardly walk around. Then he lost 190 <br/>
pounds and became this super-athletic kind of guy. Then he gained <br/>
about 50 pounds back and became a semi-athletic, semi-couch potato <br/>
kind of guy. But he was always the same guy - always funny, always <br/>
kind, always interesting. Health is really a quality that just counts <br/>
to the particular person. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my kids to be healthy because I think healthy people are <br/>
somehow &quot;better&quot;. I just feel personally that when a person is truly <br/>
healthy, that they can fully appreciate and enjoy all that life has <br/>
to offer, not be limited in some way that they don&#39;t have to be. I <br/>
feel grateful that my parents gave me the gift of good health - <br/>
through the foods that we, as a family, ate, through our activity <br/>
level, through our friendships, groups, etc. through our <br/>
appreciation and enjoyment of nature and being outdoors. My mom even <br/>
breastfed me for a year in an era when that was darn near not done, <br/>
and I feel that was a gift too. I want to give my children the same <br/>
gift.<br/>

It&#39;s really okay to be honest.  You must think it&#39;s better or you wouldn&#39;t <br/>
care one way or the other.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am being honest, but let me be more clear. I think some *foods* are <br/>
better than others. I think *feeling* healthy is better than not <br/>
feeling healthy. I think having a body that can do what you want it <br/>
to is better than having a body that&#39;s limited (and having broken 13 <br/>
bones in this life, I know what the limits feel like when they&#39;re <br/>
there!). But I don&#39;t judge people, friends or otherwise, on whether <br/>
they&#39;re healthy. I don&#39;t feel that they&#39;re a better *person* if <br/>
they&#39;re healthy. I want my kids to be healthy because I think they&#39;ll <br/>
have a greater quality of life for whatever time they&#39;re given to be <br/>
on earth. I don&#39;t want them to be healthy because I think that <br/>
somehow that would make them a superior person to those around them. <br/>
Hopefully that&#39;s a better definition of what I meant in the quote <br/>
above.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Don&#39;t back down when you think you&#39;re right!  It&#39;s more okay to <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; important and RIGHT&quot; than to wimp out and say &quot;Well, I&#39;m sure RC <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and moonpie <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is just as good as homegrown vegetables.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL, I don&#39;t think anyone who knows me would say that I&#39;m the kind of <br/>
person who &quot;wimps out&quot; when it comes to my beliefs. I&#39;m rather known <br/>
for stating my mind :-) I *do* believe it is better, for our family <br/>
and for our kids, for us to be healthy. I don&#39;t try to tell others <br/>
that they&#39;re a bad person because they had a moonpie and cola for <br/>
breakfast. I might think that they&#39;re not a particularly *healthy* <br/>
person if that&#39;s their regular daily breakfast fare, but that doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean I think that they&#39;re a *bad* person or someone I wouldn&#39;t want <br/>
to be around. <br/>
<br/>
My whole statement about most people not being healthy was not meant <br/>
to be derogatory, just a statement of fact. But it is also true that <br/>
this topic pushes a lot of buttons for people. Our culture is very <br/>
caught up in weight, size, etc. issues. For many people big=bad and <br/>
small=good. Also for many people big=unhealthy and small=healthy, <br/>
which is not necessarily the case. For myself, I just want to be <br/>
healthy, and I want my kids to feel that way too. &#39;Nuff said.<br/>
