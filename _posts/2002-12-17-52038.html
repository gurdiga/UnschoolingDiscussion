&lt;&lt; I have to go with Ren on this one.  I grew up in a law enforcement family<br/>
 and dh is in the fire department so we most always have the scanner on.  The<br/>
 &quot;busy&quot; times for law enforcement and emergency services is from 3 to 6 in<br/>
 the afternoon (after school is out and before parents get home from work)<br/>
 and about 8 to 10 (Dad has had time to tie one on and light into Mom).  I<br/>
 also think it is very important to remember that if you take out the violent<br/>
 crimes committed within families and between two criminals, the statistics<br/>
 go WAY down. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to hear from someone &quot;inside&quot;....<br/>
I do talk to cops frequently as Dillards employs them as security. I know <br/>
several of the local police officers and hear their day to day stories (they <br/>
love relaying them ad nauseum) never noticed that there is more going on <br/>
after midnight, quite the contrary.<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone see David Letterman the other night? There was one of our local <br/>
officers doing one of the games they play on the show. He got the &quot;name your <br/>
meat&quot; category, it was funny.....I work with a couple of his buddies.<br/>
