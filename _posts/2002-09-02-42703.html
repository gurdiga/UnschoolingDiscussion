 </span></blockquote>Well....I really like &quot;colouring outside the lines&quot; (can&#39;t remember the <br/>
author just now) because it&#39;s written by a Dad and his kids were pulbic <br/>
schooled. It&#39;s amazing that he left them in ps because  he points out so many <br/>
ways that school damages kids. He talks about how to tune into your child&#39;s <br/>
interests and completely trust and indulge them.<br/>
I think it&#39;s a great book for reluctant dh&#39;s because he isn&#39;t pressuring <br/>
anyone to homeschool, but it is eye opening.<br/>
I have heard Frank Smith&#39;s book of &quot;learning and forgetting&quot; is really great <br/>
too. Haven&#39;t read it myself, but I&#39;m sure someone here will tell you about <br/>
it. And, he was at the hsc conference I believe so you could maybe buy a <br/>
tape. Easier for dh maybe?<br/>
There are  many, many articles at Sandra&#39;s site that you could print out too. <br/>
 Short enough that he may read them where he may not read a book.<br/>
I think the best thing with reluctant dh&#39;s is to be proactive. Keep a simple <br/>
log, talk a lot about all the wonderful things they are learning and <br/>
doing...give it time.<br/>

I&#39;ve heard recommended most often for reluctant husbands.  Guterson is a <br/>
high school teacher (or was - he&#39;s an novelist as well).<br/>

When homeschooled kids enter public school, they get put in with all the <br/>
other kids their age.  Then the teacher copes with all those different <br/>
levels.  And the learning objectives are just that, objectives.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear Robin,<br/>
Yes, you probably will be the one doing the reading. That&#39;s okay. I do wonder <br/>
about these &quot;conditions&quot; though. The one thing about unschooling I have tried <br/>
to stress to Darin is that the kids will learn better this way (as opposed to <br/>
the rigors of a ps curriculum.) but for him not to expect them to pick up a <br/>
math book or ask for a history book. He says he understands, but I don&#39;t <br/>
think he does. I know that if Moly *had* to go to school starting tomorrow, <br/>
she would be ages ahead of the other kids (I think third grade?) in reading, <br/>
but miles behind in math. She would be all over the place with everything <br/>
else. Moly knows tons about the human body, but I don&#39;t think a typical third <br/>
grade curriculum covers that. So although she knows some *science* the <br/>
teacher would probably assume we never studied any science at all. (true and <br/>
not true at the same time.) Moly could name many constellations, and knows <br/>
all sorts of things about the planets. But if that wasn&#39;t what the teacher <br/>
was teaching at the time, she wouldn&#39;t be able to appreciate Moly&#39;s <br/>
knowledge. <br/>
<br/>
My husband Darin thinks homeschooling is a fine idea. (But) I get the <br/>
impression that he isn&#39;t too sure about all this *free learning*. He doesn&#39;t <br/>
say much, but every now and then he will make a small comment. Usually it <br/>
goes something like this. Moly is counting out her money. She has a pile of <br/>
change and some paper bills. She announces she has four dollars, 7 quarters, <br/>
18 nickels, 5 dimes and 143 pennies. Darin says &quot;how much is that?&quot; and Moly <br/>
says, &quot;I just said how much I have.&quot; Darin will look at me, I am sure you <br/>
know that look. &lt;g&gt; and try to give Moly this 5 minute math lesson on how to <br/>
count her money. The first problem that comes up is she isn&#39;t wanting a <br/>
lesson on counting money. Then there is the problem that she doesn&#39;t know how <br/>
to add large numbers. So he tries to describe how to carry the one. She <br/>
doesn&#39;t get that so he tries to tell her about number placement. It goes on <br/>
and on and Moly gets bored and upset that her Dad isn&#39;t impressed with the <br/>
amount of money she has saved, rather he wants to turn everything into a <br/>
lesson. Darin gets upset that Moly doesn&#39;t seem to want to know how to add up <br/>
her money. Moly leaves and Darin says to me, &quot;I thought you started school <br/>
already.&quot; (meaning the public schooled kids have gone back, why haven&#39;t you <br/>
started teaching our kids something?) I gently remind him that we don&#39;t do <br/>
school, we are learning all the time, the kids and I follow our interests. To <br/>
which I usually hear, &quot;That&#39;s great, but when are you going to do math?&quot; He <br/>
just doesn&#39;t get it and I doubt he ever will. <br/>
<br/>
I have tried to get him to read books on the subject, then I tried to get him <br/>
to &quot;Just read this chapter honey!&quot; then I tried reading whatever paragraph <br/>
had just struck me as an extraordinarily, eye-opening, what ever idea I <br/>
thought just might help him *get it*. I&#39;m going to try tapes next. He likes <br/>
books on tape so maybe this will work! Someone else telling him what I have <br/>
been saying all along, in their words. I think, over the years, he has come <br/>
to accept it though. He knows the kids are smart. He is just so impressed <br/>
with the way Moly had taken to reading, and is always asking about what she <br/>
is reading. But I am sure if there were worksheets with big gold stars, all <br/>
over the fridge, he would be more comfortable. Marrying me has definitely put <br/>
Darin outside his comfort zone! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
My best advice is, be gentle with it. For many people the idea of unschooling <br/>
takes time. So read little blurbs out loud, post short articles where he will <br/>
find them. Take the Field and Stream magazines out of the bathroom and put <br/>
your copy of The Homeschooling Handbook out, open to the unschooling chapter. <br/>
Subscribe to Home Education Magazine and leave it open to that great article <br/>
on his side of the bed...<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

homeschool, it&#39;s a very logical, reasonable look at the benefits of <br/>
homeschooling. And it&#39;s easier for lots of husbands to take coming from a <br/>
man. It gives the dad&#39;s perspective.<br/>

checklist (guess that&#39;s all in how you do it).  &quot;Always be Prepared&quot;...isn&#39;t <br/>
that the boyscout motto?  I can&#39;t do the stress of the &quot;making sure&quot; stuff, <br/>
anyway.  Probably wouldn&#39;t have these worry problems if I knew and trusted <br/>
all would be okay...So i guess what it comes down to is the part of me that <br/>

&gt;The journaling may be a good idea, but I wouldn&#39;t want it to become a<br/>
&gt;checklist (guess that&#39;s all in how you do it).  &quot;Always be Prepared&quot;...isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;that the boyscout motto?  I can&#39;t do the stress of the &quot;making sure&quot; stuff,<br/>
&gt;anyway.  Probably wouldn&#39;t have these worry problems if I knew and trusted<br/>
&gt;all would be okay...So i guess what it comes down to is the part of me that<br/>
&gt;is still stuck in &quot;the old ways.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The first year we had to report on learning for Lars&#39; program, I went <br/>
through all the learning outcomes from K-8 and checked off what he already <br/>
knew or could do.  He had stuff checked off for all those grades!  You <br/>
might want to try something like that for your hubby.  It&#39;s just amazing <br/>
what kids end up knowing without being taught.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&quot;Reluctant Husband, Reluctant Dad&quot;. Bring the spouse! He thought it would be <br/>
great for dads---or for wives/moms to take home.<br/>
