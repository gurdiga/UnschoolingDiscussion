Ren and the young&#39;uns up, Ren&#39;ll be there!  Liam asks about our old roomies <br/>
at least every week.  He wonders why we don&#39;t just go to their house <br/>
already.  He&#39;s getting antsy with all this waiting!  Me too!<br/>

<br/>
I would like to see Ren.<br/>
I have a fuzzy vision of her sitting in the hospital room, by the window, <br/>
with I don&#39;t even remember now one or two kids.  Either two and one was climbing, <br/>
or one and who was climbing up and down and around.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not on painkillers anymore and would kind like to meet Ren standing <br/>
upright.  <br/>
