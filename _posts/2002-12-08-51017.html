<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148477815">I am now an adult college student. I never intended to go to college. I did graduate high school, but I never took the SAT. When I decided to go to college (at age 28) to work towards my finance degree I thought that would be a drawback. It wasn&#39;t, though. I took an adult geared class to introduce us to college work. I did have to take some remedial math classes to prep me for Algebra. I have taken English 1101 & 1102 and finished the remedial math classes. I will go back next summer to take my college algebra class. My point is that the college didn&#39;t care that I didn&#39;t take an SAT. They have alternatives depending on what students did. As long as they get my money they don&#39;t care. So basically I no longer want to lie to my son and lead him to think he &quot;has&quot; to do certain things in order to do something else. I am  now a firm believer in &quot;don&#39;t believe what you are told&quot;. When I hear something I check it out for myself. I wish this girl in high school was able to do that and save herself some stress. <br/>

didn&#39;t even know you left open.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; she&#39;s been told that <br/>
  if she doesn&#39;t pass that class she can&#39;t take a certain college <br/>
  course she needs to pursue her chosen career path.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  So they&#39;re lying to her.<br/>
  That&#39;s not new at school, unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
  We were told lots of things we &quot;had&quot; to do, and none of it was true, in the <br/>
  1960&#39;s.<br/>
  When I was teaching I told kids the truth about what state requirements were <br/>
  and what colleges needed, and how they could transfer from a state college <br/>
  which HAD to accept them into a fancier college if their grades were good <br/>
  there.   <br/>
<br/>
  Maybe that&#39;s another reason  I didn&#39;t last.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062554173">Oh, believe me, it&#39;s NOT easy to walk on that campus and be in classes with 19 and 20 year olds, even in the night classes. But there are more adult students each year, which is why the college has programs geared for adults. There is a even an adult oriented sorority I want to join! The fun part was the orientation where dh came with me and go to be my &quot;parent&quot; for the day : ) <br/>
<br/>
But I do thank you for the compliment. I have not seen that move as being very courageous. <br/>

Hi, Beth --<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can cut your fears down to size and follow your dream.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some really good stuff in Frank Smith&#39;s book (The Book of<br/>
Learning and Forgetting) where he says we learn from the company we<br/>
keep.  He also says that a lot of human learning takes place in social<br/>
groups and clubs that revolve around interests and activities.  He says<br/>
the worst thing that we can do to anyone&#39;s learning is make them feel<br/>
like they don&#39;t belong in the club.<br/>
<br/>
In some areas, community college classes are broadcast on TV.  Watching<br/>
5 minutes of one class could be a way to dip your toe in the water very,<br/>
very cautiously.  If you don&#39;t have access to these, maybe someone you<br/>
know in another part of the country could tape a couple for you, just to<br/>
take some of the mystery out of it.<br/>

Is anyone else here involved in or following MIT&#39;s Open Course Ware?  <br/>
It is up and running, started this past September with the first 37 <br/>
courses.  They will be adding more every six months or so until the <br/>
entire MIT catalog is up and available on the web.  This is a big <br/>
deal, making life-long learning from one of our top universities <br/>
available, at least in part, to everyone, all over the planet.  No, <br/>
it&#39;s not the same as taking a course in class, or even over a closed <br/>
circuit network, and you don&#39;t get college credit for these courses.  <br/>
But it is FREE!!!!  And it is another way to learn more, or at least <br/>
to get specific learning moving in a certain direction.  <br/>
<br/>
I am hoping that other colleges will follow MIT&#39;s lead, that we may <br/>
find more who open their doors to expand possibilities this way.<br/>

Check it out.  They want our feedback, so if you are excited about <br/>
this concept be sure to let them know how you feel.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-406784684">I teach community college in the evenings.  Most of my students are my age (32) or older.  Night classes have more older students in them than day classes.  Most of them have also never been to college.  If you want to try it, why not take one class, maybe a literature class or something that interests you to try it out?  You don&#39;t need to sign up for a major right away or commit to anything.  Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-474262640">That&#39;s why I like going at night when there are more adult students there. The students are serious about the work and why they are there. Maybe it was because I waited 10 years to go to school but I found the college English classes much more difficult than high school English. But my favorite class was English 1102. There were 6 female students and 1 male teacher that was about 5 years older than me. We all sat in a circle in class and discussed the stories and poems we read. Then we had to write a paper on certain stories or mix similar themes together. That was so much better than the grammar in 1101. <br/>

surgery I had to have.  They put me on &quot;academic probation&quot; (for bad grades <br/>
because I didn&#39;t complete the course) and insisted on a doctor&#39;s excuse that <br/>
I didn&#39;t think was necessary.  The &quot;counselor&quot; at the school made me feel <br/>
like I was 12 and in the principal&#39;s office for a bad report card.  I tried <br/>
to reason with her as one 30-something adult to another, but she wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have it.  All that over one single course as a &quot;special non-degree seeking <br/>
student&quot;, not even enrolled full-time.  <br/>
<br/>
They way I let that woman make me feel and that &quot;academic probation&quot; label <br/>
has been keeping me from going back for YEARS!  So y&#39;all keep talking.  I <br/>
could use some cajoling.<br/>

But I did turn it into lemonade.  The class I only took half of was medical <br/>
transcription, and I ended up getting a contract based on that half class and <br/>
my other experience and doing the job for 4 years.  ;)<br/>

&gt; because I didn&#39;t complete the course) and insisted on a doctor&#39;s <br/>
&gt; excuse that <br/>

semester, didn&#39;t get out of the hospital for 8 months, and never dropped<br/>
the classes. They ended up as F&#39;s. When I went back 4 or 5 years later<br/>
they were totally unwilling to change the grades to withdrawn or do<br/>
anything for me, even though I had all the hospital bills and a letter<br/>
from my current doctor. I went all the way to the board, or whatever it<br/>
was, and they were just nasty. <br/>
<br/>
I did retake one class, but the other stayed on my transcipt until I<br/>
transferred to the university, and once I got there they didn&#39;t count<br/>
grades from the CC into my GPA so it didn&#39;t matter anymore...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056171500">There&#39;s a wonderful scene in &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; where he gets in an <br/>
argument with a Harvard student - Will explains how he knows just as <br/>
much as the Harvard kid, if not more -- and that he got his education <br/>
for free with a library card. A great movie, if you&#39;ve never seen it.<br/>
<br/>
I liked parts of college, didn&#39;t like others -- but don&#39;t be intimidated <br/>
by it. If you can read, talk, think, write -- you&#39;ve got the basics. <br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;ve also taught at the college level and the best students I had were <br/>
the women who were going back to school after not having had the chance <br/>
out of high school - they were the best!  Go for it!!)<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; When I decided to go to college (at age 28) to work towards my finance<br/>
&gt; &gt; degree I thought that would be a drawback. It wasn&#39;t, though. I took <br/>
&gt; an<br/>
&gt; &gt; adult geared class to introduce us to college work. I did have to <br/>
&gt; take some<br/>
&gt; &gt; remedial math classes to prep me for Algebra. I have taken English <br/>
&gt; 1101 &<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1102 and finished the remedial math classes. I will go back next <br/>
&gt; summer to<br/>
&gt; &gt; take my college algebra class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh my goodness!  I&#39;ve been thinking about going to college but I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; scared to<br/>
&gt; death!  I moved out of my parent&#39;s home at 17 and went right to work - <br/>
&gt; never<br/>
&gt; had the college experience!  At 46, the thought of even going to the <br/>
&gt; local<br/>
&gt; junior college is enough to give me heart palpitations :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I envy your courage!<br/>
