<div id="ygrps-yiv-427782981">&lt;&lt;I look back and wish I would have continued...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then continue.<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t some rule that says passions must develop in childhood and<br/>
continue uninterrupted into adulthood.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t start the martial arts (no access to lessons in my home town) until<br/>
I was almost 30.  I now have a 2nd degree black belt and have 17 students of<br/>
my own.<br/>
<br/>
I played in the band in school but have unschooled the piano off and on for<br/>
4 years.<br/>
<br/>
I always wanted to be involved with animals and stockshows as a child but we<br/>
didn&#39;t have the money.  My 11yo dd is teaching me how to show dairy goats (I<br/>
got reserve grand champion at the Washington County Fair last weekend<br/>
&lt;yahoo&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
It is never too late.  There is no need for regrets.<br/>
