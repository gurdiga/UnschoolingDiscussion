<div id="ygrps-yiv-388546020">I&#39;m offended by Bob Sales&#39; entire post but mostly by this passage.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Indeed, when the safe and protected children of <br/>
anointed families spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year to <br/>
entertain themselves on the pornography that is rap music, clearly <br/>
the <br/>
chickens have yet to come home to roost. But when white and wealthy <br/>
Johnny <br/>
skips karate class or soccer and instead rapes the 12 year old girl <br/>
down the <br/>
road, &quot;keepin&#39; it real&quot; like the &quot;homies&quot; he respects so much on his <br/>
CD&#39;s, <br/>
then Mom and Dad will have to deal with the reality. But for now ... &gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just because young white people choose to listen to the rap music <br/>
that express these sentiments does not mean that this is all there is <br/>
to rap music.  Calling rap music pornography is so insulting I feel <br/>
like crying.  Listen to Mos Def, Common, Lauryn Hill, the Roots, the <br/>
Nappy Roots and many others and I dare you to paint rap with the <br/>
broad brush of pornography.  I cannot stand when white people who&#39;ve <br/>
only heard what the mainstream media dishes out stand on a soapbox <br/>
and insult an entire art form with little knowledge.  No one would <br/>
think to call all rock music pornography based on stuff like &quot;I want <br/>
to F--- you like an animal&quot; by Nine Inch Nails or Erotica by Madonna <br/>
(or countless others)  But you know what rap is still a largely black <br/>
artform, so it&#39;s ok, right?  You&#39;d be much better off questioning why <br/>
this is what children are attracted to.  Why is mainstream culture in <br/>
general so full of sex and violence?  It didn&#39;t begin with rap <br/>
music.  I don&#39;t apologize at all for being a rap fan.  <br/>

My point exactly. We seem to have this violence in different vehicles in our culture and our history..I think this can be addressed without blaming  rap music - I try to address these issues in my home without censorship..Leonie<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with Cherry. Although I am not a big rap fan, (if at all) I do like <br/>
Eminem, and so do my kids. The point though, is that Bob&#39;s post shows a very <br/>
racist view. He states that Mom and Dad will have to deal with reality when <br/>
&quot;rich, white, Johnny skips karate to rape the 12 y.o. down the street&quot; so he <br/>
can &quot;keep it real like his homies&quot;. I assume by the word homie, Bob is <br/>
referring to the young black American male. And I gather from his post that <br/>
Bob thinks that if this hypothetical rich white boy listens to the poor black <br/>
boy&#39;s music then the rich white boy will be just like the black boy. To <br/>
categorize all young, poor, black youth as a drug abusing (or selling) gun <br/>
carrying, gangbanging, rapist is a sad statement on Bob&#39;s knowledge of black <br/>
America. His blanket statement that says if we allow our &quot;rich, white (all <br/>
American) boys&quot; access to rap, they are going to be just like the black boy <br/>
down in the hood, is crap, and racist! BTW Bob, Eminem isn&#39;t gansta-rap, he <br/>
is white (not that that matters) and many of his songs talk about men like <br/>
you. <br/>
~Nancy who doesn&#39;t think twice about her kids listening to Eminem, Jennifer <br/>
Lopez, Britney Spears, Celtic music, folk music, disco, Run DMC (do they even <br/>
rap anymore?) The Cure, Flock of Seagulls, Madonna, Billy Joel, Louis <br/>
Armstrong, Metallica, Queen, Gloria Gaynor, ABBA, Elvis Costello, Willie <br/>
Nelson, ELO, The Clash, The Beach Boys, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Shena Easton, <br/>
Van McCoy, The Village People, Carly Simon, Sean P. Combs, Pink, Incubus, <br/>

Why Did Freddie Grow A Moustache?<br/>

To annoy Americans, for whom even the smallest, most insignificant gestures <br/>
can have dire significance. Many of them were horrified that it could mean he <br/>
was gay, even though the men in his family had been sporting the furry <br/>
caterpillar for generations. Perhaps it was in homage to the gay community, <br/>
in a similar way that many Americans sport tens of kilos of surplus fat in <br/>
homage to fast food. <br/>

Telling everyone I didn&#39;t blame myself, even though I allowed Jack to listen <br/>

would be a very good idea if I kept Jack away from all pianos in the future! <br/>

kid would be really bugged if I kept stopping videos and books to discuss<br/>
morality, it sort of interferes with the flow of the story. Although I do<br/>
talk about stuff we see and read, but more in context, as she has<br/>
questions . I don&#39;t think life is really as easy as someone acts wrong<br/>
and then this bad thing happened...and I also feel that my moral values<br/>
may differ from my child&#39;s, which to me is part of unschooling. <br/>

of people who never have read the whole Bible.<br/>
<br/>
The Old Testament abounds with tales of lying and sneaking and trickery, not <br/>
by the bad guys (who are rarely even mentioned) but by the GOOD guys!<br/>
<br/>
Joseph tricked and lied to his brothers, framed one for theft, and when they <br/>
did move to Egypt, he advised them that if the Egyptians asked them what they <br/>
used to do back home to say they had been cattlemen because Egyptians hate <br/>
sheepherders.  And so the Egyptians ask, and they say &quot;we used to herd <br/>
sheep.&quot;  What lesson do we learn from THAT!?  That lying is routine and non <br/>
punishable??<br/>
<br/>
Oh well...<br/>

Anyone who says the Bible doesn&#39;t have horrible stories of violence and <br/>
sexual abuse just hasn&#39;t read it.<br/>

I read them whatever I&#39;m reading...my oldest loves to be read to.<br/>
<br/>
However, if you make a point to know what your children are reading, or <br/>
watching or listening to in music can&#39;t you discuss the consequences.  Here <br/>
is much milder version than raping a 12 yr old or other things discussed.<br/>
<br/>
My son Andrew adores Thomas the Tank Engine.  He reads the books (even on his <br/>
own he&#39;ll look at the pictures for hours), collects the trains, watches the <br/>
videos, wears the clothes ect (I think you get the idea.)  One day I was <br/>
watching the video with him and heard the following &quot;Thomas and Henry felt <br/>
sorry for James but they teased him anyway.&quot;  Well, I don&#39;t want my son to <br/>
learn that it is ok to tease people no matter what the circumstances.  For a <br/>
while, I took the videos away.  However, that didn&#39;t seem entirely fair.  He <br/>
derived so much pleasure and learned so much from the Thomas stuff I gave <br/>
them back.  I watched this particular one with him several times and pointed <br/>
out that wasn&#39;t very nice.<br/>
<br/>
My point is: it doesn&#39;t matter if it is books or videos or music they will be <br/>
exposed to things that go against any family&#39;s personal values.  Just the <br/>
same way as we point out wrong in a book or video can&#39;t we do the same with <br/>
music (if we know what they are listening to?)<br/>
<br/>
I was a child that the more something was forbidden the more I wanted <br/>
it...leading to dabblings in over drinking and other unsavory things...I hope <br/>
that I learned enough from that to give my children reasonable freedom.  How <br/>
much that is depends a lot on how the world is 10 yrs from now!<br/>

Annie the first weekend and we were in Tucson the second... but we wanted<br/>
to see it again. One cool thing that they did was that all of the actors<br/>
were on stage as you walked into the theater, talking and interacting as<br/>
whoever their character was. That sounded cool to me.<br/>
