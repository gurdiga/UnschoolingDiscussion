<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137861386">Hello, I am new also.  I am mom to an ADHD, gifted<br/>
10yb.  We are Cherokee.  I pulled my son from public<br/>
school just this year because I was tired of fighting<br/>
with them about what they were teaching my Cherokee<br/>
boy about Indian people.  And also my son is not a<br/>
desk robot.<br/>
<br/>
The difficulty I am having is trying to do everything!<br/>
 I work full time (60 hrs a week), make time for my<br/>
son, and part of taking care of me is a horse that Im<br/>
training.<br/>
<br/>
Id like to chat with other working moms out there.  :)<br/>
