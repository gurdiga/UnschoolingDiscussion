&lt;&lt; Did this really happen??? I&#39;m just wondering why no one headed this child<br/>
<br/>
off before it escalated like it did?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I thought that too.  Just because the neighbor had heels on didn&#39;t mean the <br/>
MOM had heels on.  And if you can&#39;t reach the kid, can you reach the faucet?<br/>
<br/>
If one of my kids did something like that, even to someone in a swimsuit who <br/>
didn&#39;t want to be sprayed, he&#39;d be inside and sitting far from water hearing <br/>
what I thought about it.<br/>
