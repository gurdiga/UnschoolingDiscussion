<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211082608">Here&#39;s some insight on &quot;the color thing&quot; with Steiner.<br/>
 It is, perhaps, in my opinion, the earliest form of<br/>
ADHD propaganda.<br/>
<br/>
From, The Education of the Child, by Rudolph Steiner<br/>
(p.20 and 21).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;With regard to the environment, &#39;nervous&#39; children,<br/>
that is, excitable children, should be treated<br/>
differently from those who are quiet and lethargic. <br/>
Everything comes into consideration, from the color of<br/>
the room and the various objects that are generally<br/>
around the child, to the color of the clothes they<br/>
wear.  One will often do the wrong thing if one does<br/>
not take guidance from spiritual knowledge, for in<br/>
many cases the materialistic idea will be the exact<br/>
reverse of what is proper.  Excitable children should<br/>
be surrounded by and dressed in red or reddish-yellow<br/>
colors, while lethargic children should be surrounded<br/>
by blue or blueish-green shades of color.  The<br/>
important thing is the complementary color that is<br/>
created within the child.  In the case of red it is<br/>
green, and in the case of blue, orange-yellow.  This<br/>
can be seen very easily by looking for awile at a red<br/>
or blue surface and then quickly looking at a white<br/>
surface.  The physical organs of the child create this<br/>
contrary or complementary color, and this is what<br/>
causes the corresponding organic structures that the<br/>
child needs.  If excitable children have a red color<br/>
around them, they will inwardly create the opposite,<br/>
the green; and this activity of creating green has a<br/>
calming effect.  The organs assume a tendency of<br/>
calmness.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wow!  Be sure to try this:  &quot;This can be seen very<br/>
easily by looking for awile at a red or blue surface<br/>
and then quickly looking at a white surface.&quot;<br/>
(Steiner, see above.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411634413">But this is Goethe&#39;s theory, not Steiner&#39;s. Did Steiner claim to have <br/>
discovered this himself?<br/>
