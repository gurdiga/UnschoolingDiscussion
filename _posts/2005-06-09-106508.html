<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617651306">Hi all- one of the many lurkers here and newbee- wannabe unschooling <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
I think I may have posted on here before but not sure- any how my <br/>
name is Rachel, a single work at home mom, and ds (is that son?- a <br/>
guide to abbreviations would helpful lol) is David. We reside in WV. <br/>
It is one that requires end of year testing or portfolio showing <br/>
improvment of a certain percent. Would love to hear from any <br/>
unschoolers in WV. I pulled David out of school in Dec 04- We-- More <br/>
like &quot;I&quot; tried doing the traditional homeschool with county books in <br/>
Jan- with total failure!<br/>
<br/>
But I digress- well that was background... My main reason for this <br/>
post is to celebrate a wonderful unschoooling moment - which have <br/>
become more common. (Getting here has not been easy- and I know I&#39;m <br/>
not over the hill yet lol) My son loves to play ps2- he recently got <br/>
a game that has voice control. However he does not have the <br/>
connection for it yet- we realized afterwards...lol. <br/>
<br/>
So my adventursome son asked if he could tear up 2 headphones so that <br/>
he could connect the computer speakers, which he hooked to the tv, to <br/>
a separate subwoofer that allowed for input from a microphone. So I <br/>
said sure just so long as you don&#39;t tear up my headset (ie- <br/>
microphone). So David works out in his mind and puts his plan into <br/>
action. I am starting dinner. He needs help splicing the 2 <br/>
headphones. So he waits till I can put a stop to dinner- even <br/>
pitching in. <br/>
<br/>
We get to his work area- the living room floor- and I ask David to <br/>
explain to me all the intricacies (sp?) he has planned. Well come to <br/>
find out he was going to be putting the cords from an output into an <br/>
output. So he realized even before he finished speaking that what he <br/>
was planning would not work. <br/>
<br/>
He is a very emotional 11 year old that gets upset very easily. He <br/>
looks up at me with these alligator tears, crooked mouth, and working <br/>
himself into a lather. But when he sees me I have this great big <br/>
grin! And he is like why are you happy- I messed up! I tore up 2 <br/>
perfectly good head phones! And I jump up laughing and say &quot;WE DID <br/>
IT!&quot; Of course he is giving me &quot;the look&quot;. And I say David this is <br/>
what unschooling is about- finding your way! <br/>
<br/>
I tell him that he is very smart and to continue what is he doing- he <br/>
will probably find a way. So after dinner we look at it again and I <br/>
ask him ok- where does this connection lead to... the speakers, and <br/>
this one- the tv. So which one leads to the ps2? this one. And how <br/>
will connecting the headset to the tv get the commands to the ps2. <br/>
AHHHHHHHH! So he grabs the PS2 looking for a head set connection- <br/>
again. The only hookup he can find he says looks like the one for my <br/>
camera. (USB port). <br/>
<br/>
So I say well if this game has voice command ability and it needs to <br/>
be hooked to the ps2 then... David says then the microphone needs to <br/>
be hooked to the PS2- he pulls out the booklet. At which he finds the <br/>
requrement for a usb headset- microphone & headphone. <br/>
<br/>
So the next question is can I tear up this really nice Logitec mouse <br/>
that has a usb connection and splice it to the headset? Of couse I <br/>
called a halt there- The mouse is $40 and that&#39;s the only head set I <br/>
have. But he was thinking! He was LEARNING! I was LEARNING! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Be Well,<br/>

Oh Rachel...for some reason that line put a little tear in my eye! I <br/>
love those moments - just before the peak, when they have the option <br/>
to hang in there or let go...and you hand the reins to them and <br/>
say &quot;Whoa, or go, it&#39;s up to you&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Congratulations and thanks for sharing. Your story was inspirational <br/>
to me today!<br/>
