 Then you don&#39;t know N. Ca. very well &lt;vbg&gt;. I can imagine there are<br/>
 zillions. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Retreats perhaps, I don&#39;t believe there are a whole lot of abbeys.....and I <br/>
think the retreat centers are just for meditation and visiting.<br/>
The abbeys are a way of life, you become a monk to live there.<br/>
As far as I know there aren&#39;t many of those.<br/>
I&#39;ve spent a lot of time in Cali, dh used to live there when we were dating.<br/>
<br/>
Shasta is especially known in the New Age groups, but Buddhist Abbeys? Are <br/>
you sure there are loads of those?<br/>

growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-471295172">Well, I visited:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://members.aol.com/rimedzong/files/centers.html">http://members.aol.com/rimedzong/files/centers.html</a><br/>
and it seems that while there are a LOT of retreat centers and temples <br/>
(where perhaps only one or two priests/nuns stay, there are a few <br/>
monasterys/abbeys/residentials.<br/>
I found at least five possibilities in a few minutes.  Maybe there&#39;s more <br/>
and maybe this is it, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
Berkeley Zen Center has a monastery (but an abbey?  I don&#39;t know.  They do <br/>
have an Abbott...)<br/>
Tassajara Zen Mountain Monastery (also don&#39;t know if it has an abbey)<br/>
Green Gulch Farm (in Sausalito?) has a residency program, but I don&#39;t know <br/>
if it qualifies as an abbey.<br/>
Sonoma Mountain Zen Center has a residency program that requires at least a <br/>
year, preferably two, but no mention of abbey or monastery.<br/>
Shasta Abbey, of course.<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
