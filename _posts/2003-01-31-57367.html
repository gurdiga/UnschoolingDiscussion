<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603420311">Hey<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been exploring the solar system the past week or so. Got a <br/>
bunch of books on all the planets, out of the library, and in one of <br/>
them was an idea: Make a model of the solar system with the sun on <br/>
one wall, and the planets placed where they &quot;would be&quot; in your model. <br/>
We tried to do both the sizes and the distances of the sun and <br/>
planets to scale, but we&#39;d have had Pluto across the street, which <br/>
sort of blew everyone&#39;s mind, OR Jupiter and Saturn&#39;s girth would <br/>
have had them overlapping. So, we made some guesstimates and some <br/>
adjustments, and stuck our planets on the ceiling. Sun on the dining <br/>
room sliding glass door drape. Seven foot sun, btw.<br/>
<br/>
So, the planets are up on the ceiling, and I&#39;m getting dinner <br/>
together, and Robby is pretending to be on the various planets. <br/>
Suddenly he says &quot;I&#39;m on Uranus&quot; and I totally lost it! You know, he <br/>
pronounced it Your Anus LOL and it was just too silly. We all were <br/>
laughing our heads off, as the food is making its way to the table. <br/>
Then he changes his voice and says &quot;Now I&#39;m on Jupiter and this is <br/>
what I sound like! You want to hear Uranus?&quot; same pronunciation. <br/>
Well, I couldn&#39;t resist &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to hear from my anus, thank <br/>
you very much.&quot; My hubby made a fart noise...<br/>
<br/>
Um, is this a typical unschooling moment? LOL<br/>
<br/>
But you know what? All that free-flowing language set us up for some <br/>
amazing dinner time conversation. I did insist we drop the &quot;anus&quot; <br/>
stuff at the dinner table, though! L But that got us talking about <br/>
what that planet is named after, if not a Roman God, and what each <br/>
planet&#39;s god stood for, and then Holst&#39;s &quot;The Planets&quot; into the tape <br/>
deck, and Abbie, who knows a lot of Greek mythology, mentioned the <br/>
rape of Europa and now the kids know that Zeus made himself into a <br/>
bull to kidnap Europa. <br/>
We tried to figure out if Holst got it right. Does that sound <br/>
warlike? Is Jupiter&#39;s music happy and grand and jovial and kinglike? <br/>
Is Mercury fast music, and Venus sexy music? <br/>
<br/>
Robby, when he got up to get the salad dressing, had to change it <br/>
from Plutonian salad dressing, into &quot;human salad dressing.&quot; which, <br/>
when applied to potato skins, was another hilarious side-trek. Flayed <br/>
potatoes, we called them. and then it was &quot;Flays Potato Chips. Bet <br/>
can&#39;t eat just one&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Robby acted like an alien off and on the rest of the night, and I <br/>
went to bed early! what a day, what a night.<br/>
<br/>
peace, heidi</div>

<br/>
The best kind!  People were laughing and smiling and being glad they were in <br/>
the same place together.  How many families get that?  You were building <br/>
memories.  What if the planets remind them of their mom and dad for the rest <br/>
of their lives?  <br/>
<br/>
Holly told me about this episode of Futerama.  I missed it, but I&#39;ve found <br/>
the pertinent dialog with google.com:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
About the &quot;smelloscope&quot; :<br/>
<br/>
Fry: &quot;Hey, as long as you don&#39;t make me smell Uranus.&quot; *laughs*<br/>
<br/>
Leela: &quot;I don&#39;t get it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Professor: &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end <br/>
that stupid joke once and for all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Fry: &quot;Oh. What&#39;s it called now?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Professor: &quot;Urectum. Here, let me locate it for you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Fry: &quot;Hehe, no, no, I think I&#39;ll just smell around a bit over here.&quot;</div>
