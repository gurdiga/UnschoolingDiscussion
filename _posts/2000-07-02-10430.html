<div id="ygrps-yiv-239429418">Sorry, i didn&#39;t cut and paste just the pertinent parts, but that would be <br/>
time consuming... i really think the reason i c/p the whole thing is so i can <br/>
re-read and remember what parts i wanted to respond to... i guess i could <br/>
clip the pieces out , but it really does kinda lose content, don&#39;t you think? <br/>
 well, i&#39;m up for suggestions...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I am early on my journey as a parent (and in some ways as a <br/>
 human spirit, but that&#39;s another discussion altogether) but my take <br/>
 on the whole &#39;discipline&#39; thing is that punishment and rewards (both <br/>
 equally) do not lead to inner discipline, but instead a reliance on <br/>
 external pressure to show the way.  I know this is true in my case, <br/>
 having been raised and schooled with the tradititional <br/>
 punishment/reward system.  I am trying to rediscover the single-<br/>
 minded-ness of purpose and inner strength I am told I possessed <br/>
 as a young child, before the interference of school with it&#39;s 10-out-of-<br/>
 10&#39;s and &#39;poor&#39; with it&#39;s peer-pressure and condescendence.  And <br/>
 so I&#39;m unschooling, hopefully to not inflict those things on my own <br/>
 children.  I said I&#39;d stay off the &#39;smacking&#39; theme, but there&#39;s one <br/>
 quote I&#39;d like to add, from Adele Faber and Eileen Mazlish and I <br/>
 forget which book of theirs it&#39;s from, or even the exact wording, but <br/>
 it&#39;s something along the lines of how sad it is that even parents <br/>
 with college-level education, supposedly intelligent people cannot <br/>
 find a way to deal effectively with their children without using <br/>
 violence.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
i think i said the above in one of my e-mails, but maybe not... anyway, this <br/>
has always been my opinion too... and having been similarly brought up as the <br/>
above poster, it&#39;s been quite a challenge for me through the years... i read <br/>
faber and mazlish&#39;s how to listen talk book before my son was born... it made <br/>
so much sense and i vowed to commit to it... and have mostly through their <br/>
lives so far with the occasional slip-up... and it&#39;s hard... really hard, <br/>
imo... as they get beyond the 7-8 year mark... <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t use time-out or any other such form of punishment.  I <br/>
 wouldn&#39;t remove &#39;privileges&#39; (what do people regard as privileges, <br/>
 anyhow?  This is a serious question, btw, I&#39;ve never quite <br/>
 understood this term) unless they were directly involved in <br/>
 whatever, so that the &#39;removal&#39; was a direct consecquence of the <br/>
 action, like when the kids wouldn&#39;t tidy up their stuff, so they put it <br/>
 in bin-bags and I said it had gone to the dustbin-dragon.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
we do that with our daughter... but it really doesn&#39;t work... she&#39;s 11, and <br/>
has had probably 30 brown paper bags of her stuff in the basement... that she <br/>
never missed...lol... she is a kid who works with what she has and never <br/>
complains... so now i&#39;ve tried a new approach... i&#39;ll let you know if it <br/>
works... i learned about it in Ed Psyche this year... get this, i go into her <br/>
bedroom when she&#39;s in there and exclaim,&quot;my goodness, abby, you are such a <br/>
neat child... i&#39;m so happy to see how organized you are ... and i&#39;m impressed <br/>
with how you stay with it all the time... she thinks i&#39;m being sarcastic and <br/>
gets mad sometimes... now she&#39;s at the point where she laughs about it... <br/>
according to my prof. and the book, there&#39;s a good chance she will eventually <br/>
live up to my &quot;accusations&quot;... it sure feels better than screaming, yelling, <br/>
punishing and even taking her stuff away... but it&#39;s hard to live with the <br/>
filth, i admit... we take away privileges when... well, let&#39;s see... it&#39;s <br/>
usually for a pretty big infraction... like when my 14 year old went to a <br/>
friend&#39;s house after school and didn&#39;t tell me or the school... the school <br/>
assumed he got on the bus... they found out... he was given detentions ... i <br/>
asked him what he thought i should do about it... and we decided on loss of <br/>
phone privileges for a week(a very big deal to him)... both my kids lose <br/>
privileges for chronic mouthing off, lying, not doing what they&#39;re told like <br/>
the 3rd time... but they know when they do it what the consequence is... i&#39;ve <br/>
even been asked by my daughter what the consequence would be if she called me <br/>
a &quot;bitch.&quot; lol... she wanted to know if it was worth the joy i suppose...<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; That&#39;s a <br/>
 direct consequence. and they chose to put their stuff in the <br/>
 rubbish.  And I don&#39;t use star-charts or anything like that either.  If <br/>
 anyone&#39;s interested in a good book on the subject of training, I <br/>
 particularly like Don&#39;t Shoot the Dog, by Karen Pryor (I think)  I got <br/>
 it from my local LLL group library.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i tried the charts when they were little... never worked... rewards and <br/>
punisments don&#39;t work and like you said, they transfer intrinsic motivation <br/>
to extrinsic... that&#39;s one of the main reasons my daughter&#39;s going to <br/>
homeschool next year... wayyyyy too much of her motivation is extrinsic... <br/>

Perhaps if you write what you mean to, then clip the <br/>

that, though I tend to just run off at the fingers, so <br/>
I lose track of what I&#39;m replying to anyhow...  I know <br/>
what you mean about speed, but then again, the poor <br/>
souls on digest (if there are any, seeing as I was the <br/>
only one to complain about it) don&#39;t want to spend time <br/>
re-reading stuff they&#39;ve just read.<br/>
<br/>
So what do you regard as &#39;phone privileges?&#39;  Perhaps <br/>
it because my kids aren&#39;t that age, or perhaps because <br/>
I&#39;m English and things just aren&#39;t called the same, but <br/>

attention by doing whatever they&#39;d done.  Also, the &#39;shunning&#39; <br/>
would not be organised, just an individual judgment of the <br/>

I try not to &#39;punish&#39; (withdrawal of privilege, as it&#39;s neither an <br/>
immediate reinforcement or a direct consequence seems like a <br/>
punishment to me) so I&#39;d play it by ear, reacting to whatever the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-736074937">well i&#39;ve been thinking about this and didn&#39;t know where to start so <br/>
i asked rene&#39;, my 4 + yos, what he thought about discipline and he <br/>
said &#39;oh i like that&#39; so i asked him what he thought about punishment <br/>
and he bit his fingers and said &#39;eee i don&#39;t like that&#39;  so i asked <br/>
him what was discipline and he said &#39;it&#39;s right and good because it <br/>
isn&#39;t a lie&#39; then he left the room.  so i guess that&#39;s a good focus to <br/>
have when disciplining a child - no lies.  <br/>
<br/>
i would start by saying we involve rene&#39; in all decision.   this is <br/>
because i believe in equality - no hierarchy.  i believe in voluntary <br/>
involvement hence we have no chores list but things get done and if <br/>
they don&#39;t we don&#39;t sweat it.  i believe that discipline must have <br/>
some meaning in the child&#39;s life so that it can be internalized or <br/>
it&#39;s an act of power and control leaving the child w/ the feeling of <br/>
oppression and invalidation i.e. anger.  i&#39;m big on talking and <br/>
explaining why doing something like yard work or washing dishes is <br/>
important and he seem quiet willing to participate because he knows he <br/>
can start and stop of his own free will.  my intent is to create an <br/>
atmosphere of free will and cooperation. though we do not rely on his <br/>
labor&lt;g&gt;  as far as privileges go i don&#39;t know what this means.  it is <br/>
my belief that we all share the house and most (not all) things in it, <br/>
making his use of things his right not a privilege.  time-outs are <br/>
contrary to my personal philosophy because it foster separation when i <br/>
want to foster relationship.  <br/>
<br/>
so now for the reality:)  does he drive me nuts - daily &lt;G&gt; but that <br/>
seems to be diminishing and being that he&#39;s not yet 5 this is a good <br/>
sign for things to come (the teenage years:)  so when he does <br/>
something which he knows is rude or deliberately done to irritate me <br/>
(which he takes great pleasure in:) i began by tell him why i was <br/>
frustrated w/ him and he would say he&#39;s sorry (which i think he&#39;s <br/>
beginning to see has meaning beyond the words:) now we laugh a lot at <br/>
the weird things he does then it dawns on him his words were rude and <br/>
he points it out himself and apologies.  this does not get immediate <br/>
change of behavior far from it but he&#39;s beginning to get the picture.  <br/>
what i&#39;m trying to do is develop w/in him a compassion for others as <br/>
well as himself w/out fostering too much self-consciousness.<br/>
<br/>
there are some issue which i believe require a firm stand.  these are <br/>
all in the realm of safety.  so in areas like brushing teeth, crossing <br/>
the road, crowds, power tools..... i simply &#39;lay down the law&#39; so to <br/>
speak and explain why it is important to follow the rules.  now given <br/>
the nature of 2-5 yo&#39;s, who love to practice their autonomy,  this <br/>
doesn&#39;t happen smoothly but i remain consistent  e.g. brushing teeth <br/>
was something he didn&#39;t like being forced to do but we just kept <br/>
telling him why it was necessary and that there was no negotiating <br/>
this point and now he remind us that his teeth need to be brushed.  <br/>
this is true of the other area as well.  i think he has learned to <br/>
respect my intentions because i&#39;ve shown him time and again that i <br/>
always have his best interest at heart (except for coffee in  the <br/>
morning when it&#39;s thad&#39;s & my time &lt;g&gt; but normally he just sleeps <br/>
through this:)<br/>

they&#39;re all good ones... and they don&#39;t always fall in line with my idea of <br/>
safety... all they see is that they aren&#39;t allowed to go to parties without <br/>
my talking to the parents... that they aren&#39;t allowed to roam the streets <br/>
without my knowing who and where exactly they are going... that they aren&#39;t <br/>

that must be very frustrating for you, especially having another child that <br/>
is easy going.  Zak is quite hyperactive as well, however that does seem to <br/>
have calmed down now that he&#39;s approaching 5.  I only know what works for us <br/>
and being consistent in all that Steve and I do with Zak has been so <br/>
important.  We&#39;ve even left the grocery store or toy store or playdates when <br/>
Zak&#39;s behavior was out of control when he was younger.  It&#39;s a nuisance for <br/>
me, but a good lesson for him.  We have rules when we go places (they are <br/>
usually safety) such as the grocery store.  Just 3, as too many more is too <br/>
many to remember.  (1) hold onto the cart (2) only pick things off the shelf <br/>
that mummy tells you she needs and (3) running away is not ok.  I ask him <br/>
each time we go into the store what the rules are and he tells me.  I tell <br/>
him what the consequence will be if he chooses not to listen.  He usually <br/>
wants a baloon and a do-nut (yuk) so if his behavior is appropriate he gets <br/>
them otherwise I pick him up and put him in the cart and shop.  At first he <br/>
used to scream and I just ignored it and kept shopping (I&#39;m not really <br/>
concerned about what the other shoppers think).  Now he doesn&#39;t do it <br/>
anymore.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the consistency or him growing older. <br/>

With having another child so close in age who just learned to walk well in the last 8 months it is just far too dangerous to be running about chasing Thomas and being preoccupied with his behavior or whereabouts while I have another little one there to be concerned with.  If I do have to go to the store by myself with both my little terrorists, than Thomas rides in the seat and Alex rides in the main part of the cart, (because he is less likely to stand up, or to goof around, or not listen to me when he needs to settle down, etc.)<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I will let him stay in his PJs all day when he resists getting dressed.  But when he sees his brother playing outside and he can&#39;t go...well that is usually a good motivator for that one.<br/>
It is VERY hard not to play favorites when Thomas is having one of his difficult days and it is time to choose who gets to go with Mom or Dad to run an errand, or whatever.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do tend to do that, but if the &quot;action&quot; is playing a make believe game with his brother, and I take brother away and play with him...well then I have removed what Thomas was doing.  I have in a sense removed the action from him, rather than him from the action.<br/>

We have a playgroup of three 3 year olds on two mornings a week.<br/>
I think I should put up a sign &quot;model conflict resolution&quot; for myself to<br/>
remember. I say &quot;Stop. Let&#39;s talk about it. What do we do when 2 people want<br/>
to use a toy?&quot; or &quot;How can you work this out?&quot; I try to hav e the kids do<br/>
the negotiation with one another. This usually gets the grabber to say &quot;Can<br/>
I please use that toy?&quot; We practice ideas for dealing with conflict when not<br/>
in dispute so we have the tools for when we are. They slowly are getting<br/>
better and better at working things out on their own. As they grow, they can<br/>
play more co-operatively and imaginatively.<br/>
When they were younger, and fought over a toy, the toy sometimes had to take<br/>
a time out when we couldn&#39;t come to a resolution.<br/>

other.  &#39;Playing favourites&#39; is a hard concept to visualise, cos I <br/>
don&#39;t know what life is like in your house, you love them both, <br/>
uniquely to each child, but it IS hard to like someone who makes <br/>
your life harder.  I know my kids get treat differently, due greatly <br/>
to our early relationships, it&#39;s hard to shake off bad birth <br/>
experiences and rough early relationships.  Heather, who&#39;s very <br/>
smart and very sensitive, gets the rough end of me sometimes cos <br/>
I just don&#39;t relate to her as well as Abi, who can be as ornery as <br/>
the oneriest thing you can think of, but we had a better beginning.  <br/>
I was doing some research on co-sleeping (anyone&#39;s fav authors <br/>

paragraph on the &#39;nuturing&#39; site, to the effect of those babies who <br/>

&lt;&lt; I sure hope so.  Everyone tells me that my children are charming and <br/>
wonderful, for toddlers that is.  But I get so discouraged and tired.  It is <br/>
hard to see the big picture from so close up, or to remember to be objective <br/>
when you are so deeply involved every day, without end.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I so agree... it is good for us to hear from others nice comments about our <br/>
kids--  gives another perspective from our &quot;day-in-day-out&quot; outlook.  We all <br/>
know there are positive and negative characteristics about each child, but it <br/>
is so refreshing to hear from someone else an unexpected compliment, in <br/>
regards to behavior, manners, etc...Kind of gives me a &quot;parental boost&quot;. :) <br/>
