<br/>
 If a bad attitude is the criteria for banning people from this list, don&#39;t <br/>
you think that perhaps you&#39;ve missed a few posters with bad attitudes? I <br/>
think labeling someone as having a bad attitude is a very subjective process, <br/>
and is usually based on how much we like or dislike that person and his/her <br/>
views (i.e., friendship or lack thereof). Also, when you and others speak of <br/>
hijacking the list, are you suggesting a set number of posts per person or <br/>
per day?<br/>
<br/>
When Ned responded to a series of both well and ill intentioned posts with <br/>
snotty &quot;explain yourself questions,&quot; I think he was trying to make people see <br/>
that the criteria for what is acceptable here, is very vague, and seems to be <br/>
following a double standard. One standard for the old favorites and their <br/>
friends, and a different standard for those they dislike and disagree with.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Sherry<br/>
