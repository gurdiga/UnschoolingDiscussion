Is it part of a grandparent&#39;s job description to make the parents&#39; life more <br/>
difficult?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell her directly : &quot;look, this really makes my life difficult&quot; and <br/>
tell her what your minimal standards of behavior are for your kid?<br/>
<br/>
My mom has good motives, and I know she would try to listen.  Other grandmas <br/>
are less open-minded and reasonable, I know.<br/>
<br/>
When contact with grandma is really frequent, there&#39;s a much stronger need <br/>
for you to control (or influence) the behaviors you think are undesireable.  <br/>
I do limit my visits with relatives who have a negative influence on my <br/>
family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-443771730">Thanks, Betsy, but I&#39;m not sure.  I was taling with a friend about this yesterday (it really got under my skin and I&#39;ve been ranting to anyone who&#39;ll listen (including this captive audience :-) ) and she said that she turns into a teenager when she goes to her mother&#39;s and I suppose it&#39;s a bit the same, that I sit back because she&#39;s my mum.  I have an awful feeling that if I said anything it would turn into a slanging match (like the merits of taking dietary advice from someone who&#39;s a size 32 (different in the US, but you get the idea...) and she spends enought time with us to know what behaviour I expect, I don&#39;t think she can believe that someone raised the way I was can think that there is a minimum standard of behaviour.  But anyway...<br/>
<br/>
Yes I suppose I need to try, it&#39;s hard going up against your own though, don&#39;t you think?  Especially when one doesn&#39;t think they&#39;ll listen :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, Betsy, it&#39;s something to think about<br/>
<br/>
