<div id="ygrps-yiv-518100347">I like Houston, lots to do, fun museums, Old Town Spring for shopping<br/>
jaunts, close to the beach, great rodeo and stockshow in February.  It is<br/>
about 3 hours from San Antonio.<br/>
<br/>
San Antonio has the River Walk, the Alamo, a cool zoo, lots of museums, lots<br/>
of Mexican influence, in April has a massive party called Fiesta.  It is<br/>
about 2.5 hours from Austin and about the same distance from the Mexican<br/>
border.<br/>
<br/>
Austin has lots of artsy type stuff, cool little boutiques, used to have a<br/>
nudist colony on Lake Travis but not sure anymore, lots of history.<br/>
<br/>
We live between San Antonio and Austin.  All the little towns around here<br/>
have lots of history and heroic tales.<br/>

Where to stop in Louisiana?  Anyplace that sells boudin.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556737536">Okay, Julie - you have got to be the only person I&#39;ve ever heard say<br/>
they like Houston.  Since I haven&#39;t lived there for many years, I wonder<br/>
if there&#39;s more to do there than there used to be.  I guess you could<br/>
look at the weather as nice if it&#39;s not summer, but I still say there&#39;s<br/>
no place in the world worse than Houston in the summer.  I always feel<br/>
in a bind when I think about taking my kids to visit Texas.  I&#39;d like<br/>
them to see where I grew up, but I still think of it as being a kind of<br/>
yucky city.  Since you say it&#39;s nice, maybe I&#39;ll look into it and<br/>
consider a trip back with the kids someday.  Thanks for a different<br/>
perspective.<br/>

herself a Texan<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-225356397">Well....<br/>
<br/>
Whether one&#39;s a fan of Houston it cultural self or not, it seems there is to <br/>
be an unschooling conference there the first weekend of October.  So those <br/>
who can&#39;t make it to South Carolina or who just really want to support <br/>
unschooling in Texas might, possibly, begin to consider your lovely visit to <br/>
Houston being October 4/5.</div>
