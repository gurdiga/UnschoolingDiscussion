 Like I said, she absolutely loves this time, and begs for it everyday.  I<br/>
 get the feeling that unschooling would be much less casual than this<br/>
 focused time I have been spending.<br/>
 <br/>
 In your opinion, what are some things I should be doing.  And should I<br/>
 continue what I am doing, since she enjoys it so much? &gt;&gt;<br/>

It sounds like you are doing great!<br/>
<br/>
My 5 yo daughter just sailed thru the room so I will tell you what she did <br/>
today as an example:<br/>
<br/>
She just walked out and announced that she is &quot;carrying 3 things at a time&quot; <br/>
-- and I am to watch and now we are going to play with the doll and play the <br/>
game she just made up about bowling -- it continues from here -- until 3:30 <br/>
or so when we have to leave for big brother&#39;s Tae Kwon Do lesson.<br/>
<br/>
Before that she babysat the guinea pig while I cleaned out his cage.  She <br/>
decided he needed a snack and got him some Cheerios and water.<br/>
<br/>
Before that we watered the vegetable/flower garden and the NASA Seeds Project <br/>
we have going -- tomato seeds that have been up on the space shuttle, free <br/>
and fun.<br/>
<br/>
Before that she played in the sand box.<br/>
<br/>
And Chinese checkers.  And some cartoons (of course!).  And helped with <br/>
lunch.  And we finished reading the latest Captain Underpants book (I read, <br/>
she listened and commented non-stop as she does -- this is a book her big <br/>
brother just read and she wanted to have it read to her too because he was <br/>
laughing all the way thru it and it must be cool -- it was!).  We will take <br/>
one of her beginner reader (One Fish 2 Fish type) books with us at bb&#39;s <br/>
lesson or color.<br/>
<br/>
Etc.  etc.<br/>
<br/>
This is a fun age.  <br/>
<br/>
What I did for a sanity check (and you may well not need this but I did) was <br/>
to go to the local school&#39;s web page (the State Dept of Ed actually) and get <br/>
the Standards -- what they are supposed to be teaching the kids at each grade <br/>
level.  It isn&#39;t much from what I could see but it gave me a sense that if we <br/>
just do what comes naturally and follow up on things we like and use all the <br/>
tools we like to use (books, computer, library, etc.) we will be just fine.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, get her a library card!!  What power -- to be able to pick out your own <br/>
books.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>
