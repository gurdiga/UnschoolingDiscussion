  You are all welcome to come live with us!&nbsp; DH is originally from India 
  so<br>he&#39;s used to 4 or more families in one house. Plus I thrive on having 
  as<br>many people/family and as much community around me as possible, as I&#39;m 
  sure<br>you can tell from my CONSTANT posting!&nbsp; - Collette<br><br><br>Be 
  careful, we might just take you up on that :-)<br>I&#39;m with you, I love having 
  community. Don&#39;tcha think there should be<br>&quot;Unschooling Island&quot; somewhere 
  where we could all just live and pursue our<br>interests in wonderful 
  community? So your kid wants to learn basket weaving<br>or bicycle repair, 
  just send them down the street to Jerry who weaves<br>wonderful baskets or Dee 
  who knows all about bicycles or, or, or........<br><br>Blue 
  Skies!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; -Robin-<br>Mom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;I told you I was 
  going to grow up to be a<br>weirdo&quot;<br>and Asa (10/5/99) Who says &quot;Fishy 
  swim!&quot; at the aquarium, her favorite place<br>in the world<br><a rel="nofollow"

<br/>
I can envisage, actually, that it would be extremely beneficial to live <br/>
in such a community, I just felt like playing Devil&#39;s Advocate, or <br/>
something ;-)<br/>
