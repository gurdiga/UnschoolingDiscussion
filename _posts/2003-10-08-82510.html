<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556280432">Hi!<br/>
Is anyone involved in medieval re-enactments? My son has expressed strong interest, but the local groups say that it has to be a family affair...meaning we all have to join. I am not particularly interested, but I am considering it so my son can get involved.  Just wondering if anyone is involved in this type of activity? I wondered about the time commitment that is involved.  <br/>
 <br/>
This leads me to another question...how involved do you get in order for your child to pursue their interests? This re-enactment thing is totally my son&#39;s idea, but in order for him to do it I would have to.  I just wondered how  you handled this sort of thing.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Deana<br/>

Well, it means that someone from your family has to go with him, not that the <br/>
whole family has to go.<br/>
<br/>
If you went for a while you might find another family he hits it off well <br/>
with, and then he could go with them.  But if you&#39;re talking about the SCA, the <br/>
groups isn&#39;t equipped to handle kids at camping events, and many events are <br/>
camping.   For local meetings, dance practice, arts things, if there are any, he <br/>
might be able to be dropped off and picked up.<br/>

I am not much personally involved lately, but did it hugely for 25 years.  It <br/>
can take all your time, or just a little.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll need to make costumes for him and you.  Nowadays you can buy them.  Go <br/>
online and search.  Chivalry Sports and some other places sell Renaissance <br/>
shirts and hats and such.  There are sewing patterns now commercially available <br/>
now too.<br/>
<br/>
I still make costumes for my kids, and I help them pack, but pretty much they <br/>
go with their dad anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll get in the mood again.<br/>
<br/>
They went LOTS (whole family) with us when they were little.  <br/>
<br/>
But truly, if you go to stuff for six months or a year with him, you might <br/>
find some other people he really likes who like him and who you trust with him.  <br/>
There are forms to fill out when you send your child with someone else to an <br/>
event.  We&#39;ve taken as many as five other teens with us sometimes.   We <br/>
haven&#39;t done it with littler kids, though.<br/>
