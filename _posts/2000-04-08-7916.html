<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911376088">Ok, with all of the variations of words, I would like to know what the past<br/>
tense for spit is. DH says spit, and I say spat. We always get a big laugh<br/>
about the way I say it since I am majoring in English, and everyone knows I<br/>
am the spelling stickler:)<br/>
