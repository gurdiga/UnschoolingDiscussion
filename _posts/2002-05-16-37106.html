<div id="ygrps-yiv-634199731">I nominate Ren for the best post:<br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; What do you hope your kids will have gotten from unschooling by the time<br/>
 they&#39;re ready to move on from home? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My main goal was that their sense of self would be so strongly intact that <br/>
the world could not rob their joy, their uniqueness and their natural <br/>
curiosity. Beyond that......<br/>
<br/>
That the status quo will not matter so much to them as what is good and <br/>
right.  That they would have a deep seated knowledge in their hearts that <br/>
they are intelligent, capable human beings and can learn anything they wish.<br/>
A sense of wonder so awesome that they will never quit seeing how magical the <br/>
world truly is.  Be idealistic tempered with realistic.<br/>
<br/>
Spirituality that flows naturally and freely from a loving heart and kindness <br/>
rare.<br/>
<br/>
The ability to follow their dreams and goals, whatever those may be.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And how do you plan to help that along?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It humbles me to think about this. I came out of HS battered emotionally, not <br/>
knowing who I was or what I really wanted. And 15 years later, I am spouting <br/>
of ideals for my children that I couldn&#39;t have dreamed of at the time. <br/>
I will help that along by becoming a better person myself.<br/>
<br/>
By reading, watching, searching and regaining that sense of wonder (they&#39;ve <br/>
helped me do this already). By delving deep into questions and not pretending <br/>
like I know more than them. By being willing to set everything aside, change <br/>
plans midstream and go off in a new direction when necessary. By listening <br/>
carefully and responding appropriately.<br/>
<br/>
By respecting these amazing beings I&#39;ve been entrusted with and the inner <br/>
knowledge they already posess.<br/>
<br/>
By dialoguing with them, these matters of the heart and showing love to the <br/>
earth and my fellow human beings.<br/>
<br/>
By filling my home with books, movies, music, instruments, nature, toys, art <br/>
materials and whatever oddities my children bring home.<br/>
<br/>
By taking them to the places they want to go and ones they never knew <br/>
existed. By fixing them new and exciting foods from other countries and <br/>
making trips to the grocery store an adventure.<br/>
<br/>
By making every day an adventure, by my attitude, every mundane chore or <br/>
daily activity sacred by how I approach it.<br/>
<br/>
Healing myself has definitely been the most important step in assisting these <br/>
worthy individuals in their unschooling journey. I have learned much from <br/>
them, thank the heavens they came here to teach me.<br/>

Somehow, the topics nearest the heart are easier for me to write <br/>
about (passion as a driving force, what a concept!!).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wonderful post, Ren. You put a lot of my thoughts into words. To my surprise, <br/>
I have been thanking the heavens that my 9yo dd is the way she is. It has <br/>
always been suspected that she has ADHD (the school allergy haha), and has <br/>
never done well in school, although she is very bright. In kindergarten I <br/>
thought she was just socially immature. In first grade, I thought she was <br/>
bored. In second, I couldn&#39;t understand why she couldn&#39;t &quot;perform&quot;, I had <br/>
always done well in grade school, and loved the attention from teachers, <br/>
parents, etc. I was &quot;gifted&quot; and did academic and art enrichment programs. <br/>
Why couldn&#39;t she want to please the grownups in her life? In third grade, I <br/>
considered homeschooling. She was very combative. Our relationship was <br/>
deteriorating, she was becoming more and more oppositional. I started <br/>
resenting that she put me in a position of defending my mothering skills, and <br/>
our family life. I pulled her out this year, fourth grade. THANK GOD she is <br/>
&quot;difficult&quot;, &quot;challenging&quot;, etc., etc., etc. The temperament she has now is <br/>
celebrated in adulthood. But it cramps the institution of education&#39;s style. <br/>
In a few short months, her spark has come back. We have made up for so much <br/>
lost and frustrated time. Just think had she &quot;worked up to her potential&quot;, I <br/>
would have never questioned schooling. It is now our whole lifestyle, I <br/>
appreciate so much more that we used to overlook. Opportunities for learning <br/>
and growth, everywhere. I have grown so much, and can&#39;t wait to learn right <br/>
along with her. Her energy and enthusiasm is so contagious. I now know why I <br/>
can&#39;t remember half of the classes that I aced. Now I know why I really <br/>
absorbed the topics that I was genuinely interested in. Now I know why every <br/>
time I follow my instincts, with attachment parenting and now this, I can&#39;t <br/>
fail. Would I have ever looked at homeschooling, had she been &quot;normal&quot; and <br/>
&quot;easily adaptable&quot;? I shudder to think.....<br/>
