<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030530018">No, actually, I think many of us homeschooling right now are operating out<br/>
of a public school education (also, a TV generation), so we probably DO<br/>
think of Calvin and Hobbs first.  After all, for many of us our exposure to<br/>
classical music has been through Bugs Bunny cartoons.      Deb K.<br/>
<br/>
....that would mesh nicely with our Calvin Curriculum.<br/>
As, in Calvin & Hobbs, of course.<br/>
<br/>
But, I realized recently that I when say Calvin Curriculum to the<br/>
kabillion right wing homeschoolers here- they look very impressed.<br/>
It sounds appropiately Bible-ish.<br/>
hee heeee heeeee<br/>

&gt; &gt; our local group.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Oooh, ooh, ooh! I&#39;m doing those in my workshop at the conference!  Fun.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can you describe how you do that? In enough detail that we could do it? Or <br/>
&gt; send us to someplace that has enough description of a method that you think <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; would really work? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How much time does it take for how big a dome? How many kids? How old and <br/>
&gt; how <br/>
&gt; hard is it really, to do it?<br/>
