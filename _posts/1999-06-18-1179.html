&gt;follwing word with your own thoughts.<br/>
&gt;&quot;Because........................................................&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, OK...I didn&#39;t have time to respond to this before, but as the boys are<br/>
now absorbed in their favorite morning show (Zaboomafoo!) I will take the<br/>
time now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;There are reasons why we all keep our kids at home - and there are different<br/>
&gt;answers from different parents Sending them home is a good idea<br/>
&gt;but only because we value our kids in a different light to what some<br/>
&gt;bureaucrats do. so what are those differences.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well for one thing, they are &quot;OUR&quot; children, while to beurocrats they are<br/>
faceless masses of &quot;schoolchildren.&quot;  Much like I was recently reminded<br/>
that for most Americans the Ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo have<br/>
become faceless nameless masses, and most folks are forgetting to look more<br/>
closely at the individual stories of REAL people and families.  Many people<br/>
are so disconnected that they argue that we should not meddle in the<br/>
politics of other countries (Trekkies will relate this to the Star Fleet<br/>
Prime Directive.)  But we obviously cannot ignore genocide like that.  I<br/>
never lost my perspective, as I can&#39;t get the stroy of one particular<br/>
little boy out of my mind.  <br/>
<br/>
A similar situation can be equated to the School System.  Many parents do<br/>
not get involved because they have &quot;faith&quot; in the system (My parents are a<br/>
case in point.)  They are so enamored of the concept of public education<br/>
for all, that they sacrifice their children to the ideal.  On the other<br/>
side of the fence we have the officials who do no want to get TOO involved<br/>
with our children ie: teaching them manners, values, sex education (not<br/>
until too late anyway,) culture.  They consider these the domain of the<br/>
family (and rightly so!) and they just want to stick to the scholastic<br/>
facts.  The problem is that there are so many parents who trust the school<br/>
system to &quot;educate&quot; their children, and do not draw a line with pure<br/>
scholastics.  The biggest argument to homeschooling around here is usually<br/>
&quot;What about Socialization?&quot;  In other words, what about culture, manners,<br/>
values, friendships, mentors..etc?  Is school really the place our children<br/>
should be getting these things from?  Even well intentioned parents who<br/>
think they are addressing these issues at home forget how many of them are<br/>
supplemented, or overridden completely, by the school environment.<br/>
<br/>
We have no control over the environment at school, and the children are<br/>
often left mostly unsupervised, milling in large groups saying and doing<br/>
who knows what to each other.  In my opinion, most of these children are<br/>
far too young to be so loosely supervised or left to make their own moral<br/>
decisions and deal with peer stress and academic stress that even college<br/>
students often have trouble handling.  In contrast to the loose supervision<br/>
on the playground, outside of school grounds, or even in assemblies and<br/>
other forums at school, there is the classroom.  There small children are<br/>
expected to sit at desks most of the day and act like tiny office workers.<br/>
Keeping their mouths shut, their butts in their chairs, doing what they are<br/>
told, not asking questions unless they are in the narrow current subject<br/>
field, NOT interperting assignments with creativity but performing as<br/>
directed, NOT rocking the boat.  <br/>
<br/>
They can&#39;t even go to the bathroom or take care of their other immediate<br/>
needs.  Children with low blood sugar (like me, and my nephew) are left to<br/>
starve for hours between meals.  My neice with profound diabetes cannot<br/>
carry her own medication, although she knows how to do her own finger-prick<br/>
tests and insulin injections with  a &quot;pen&quot; style injector that would not be<br/>
dangerous for other children.  Instead, her father must leave work twice<br/>
during school hours every day to check her blood and administer insulin<br/>
when necessary.  Her parents had to fight to get the school to allow her to<br/>
carry and eat glucose tabs and sugary snacks in her &quot;fanny pack&quot; for when<br/>
she was feeling &quot;Low.&quot;  How is that in our childrens best interest, when we<br/>
must fight to have their basic needs cared for, or tell our children they<br/>
will just have to &quot;Learn to wait&quot; or &quot;Hold it&quot; ??  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that public schools could make ENOUGH changes to make it a<br/>
healthy environment for children.  I just don&#39;t think that the system is<br/>
emotionally, psychologically, or even physically healthy for our children,<br/>
so why would we send them there?  Going to have to make another Star Trek<br/>
reference (a what if utopia.)  Anyone seen how they handle &quot;school&quot;?  They<br/>
have a single room with a small group of children of many ages together<br/>
(one room schoolhouse ring a bell?) computers available to use as readily<br/>
as blocks and clay for all ages.  The children are mostly free to roam<br/>
around and do what they are interested in, and the &quot;teachers&quot; move about<br/>
taking an interest in the children&#39;s projects and offering assistance or<br/>
praise when needed and answering questions about anything they ask, when<br/>
they ask it.  Sounds nice doesn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s enough for now, as their show it over.  But you get the idea<br/>
as to MY opinion of the capabilities of the School System of meeting our<br/>
children&#39;s needs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-235578066">I am a big fan of Star Trek, but have been disappointed in how they<br/>
portrayed children learning. It didn&#39;t seem vary imaginative of what the<br/>
future could be. Smaller classes, better teachers, better technology - just<br/>
what we keep hearing today is needed to improve schools. Deep Space Nine had<br/>
several episodes which showed this kind of school. When we started out, we<br/>
went through the debate of public school vs private school. As we looked at<br/>
different schools in the area, we saw that  many of the private schools were<br/>
just better versions of school, and we realized that we didn&#39;t want just a<br/>
better school, we wanted something that was not school at all.<br/>
<br/>
I like the Voyager version better. The one little girl born onboard learns<br/>
more through mentoring/apprentice relationships. She is treated with respect<br/>
and performs real duties. If she has an interest in something, she can<br/>
pursue it through the ship&#39;s computer or through access to the people who<br/>
have interest in that subject matter. She is shown learning from various<br/>
people she comes in contact with and by doing real things.<br/>
<br/>
To quote John Holt:<br/>
&quot;What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s<br/>
growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools,<br/>
but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree totally.  I was adressing the question of how schools could<br/>
improve.  But, as I said, I don&#39;t feel they could &#39;improve&#39; enough to be<br/>
the best way for children to learn.  When I was in college, I was persuing<br/>
a degree  in elementary education.  I have always had an interest in child<br/>
psychology, in how children&#39;s minds work, and how learning takes place.  I<br/>
also just love kids and had an interest in making their school experience<br/>
more fun and positive, because I remember VERY WELL what it was like to be<br/>
in their place (nod to Sandra.)  But as I proceeded, it became more and<br/>
more apparent that I really could not do everything that I wanted to, and<br/>
teach in the way I was wanting, in a school environment.  So I quit school<br/>
for a while to think things through.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I met my husband, and in what seems like no time at all, we were<br/>
married with two kids, and I had decided to homeschool my children instead<br/>
of trying to teach other people&#39;s.  Then I discovered Unschooling, and<br/>
further adjusted my thinking from &#39;teacher&#39; to &#39;co-learner.&#39;  I am so<br/>
excited about being able to help my children learn, grow and follow their<br/>
passions into adulthood in their own ways.  The little girl on Voyager is a<br/>
great example of Unschooling, as the crew is her extended family and the<br/>
ship is her home.  <br/>

might know, victims of traumatic experiences and emotional hurts often find<br/>
healing through talking about their feelings, memories, experiences, etc,<br/>
and working them through in that way with a sympathetic ear.  I think part<br/>
of that healing, for me at least, is to see my children have much happier<br/>
childhoods, and to remember what was so awful about ps so that I can avoid<br/>
those types of situations with my children.  Also I can answer them when<br/>
they eventually ask me &quot;Mommy, how come we don&#39;t go to the regular school<br/>
like the neighbors?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I am being overly dramatic in referring to ps as a traumatic<br/>
experience, or to myself and others as victims.  I know that I carry<br/>
emotional scars and psychological barriers today that are the result of my<br/>
ps experience.  I also know that my life has been a series of choices, and<br/>
that some of those choices were poor ones due to unresolved issues that I<br/>
carry from ps that prevented me from going in a direction that might have<br/>
been better for me.   <br/>

I agree, Nanci. My ps experience was so bad, that I actually contemplated <br/>
suicide as a means of escape. For those that didn&#39;t have horrible ps years, <br/>
it&#39;s hard to explain. Of course, I&#39;ve always been very sensitive. <br/>
Unschooling is one of the greatest&quot;discoveries&quot; I&#39;ve made in my life and it <br/>
makes me happy to know that I can spare my children the pain that I had to <br/>
endure, even though I discovered unschooling after my children had to suffer <br/>
through years of ps.<br/>
I know that I&#39;ve said this before, and not everyone agrees, but I really <br/>
think that ps is evil. It hurts innocent children. Some people never recover <br/>
from the damage.<br/>
I&#39;m still working on it.<br/>

school can be traumatic and I had many traumas in school. My reaction was<br/>
how can you compare it to the sexual molestation and abuse some people go<br/>
thru. then i realized that you didnt. I did. SO this is where I am coming<br/>
from. COmparing does not do any good. so i will try to consentrate on what<br/>
you said.<br/>

Yes PS was traumatic for many people. ANd yes, I dont like it school in<br/>
general. But I know so many children and grown ups that have come out of<br/>
the system and are okay. Maybe it is just that they are younger kids and<br/>
havent been scared enough yet! or maybe the adults have dealt with it.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, what I want to say is that I just dont think ranting about PS on<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As far as I can tell, we ARE talking about Unschooling all the time.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think that there is a need to censor the discussion about ps, as I<br/>
believe it is helping some of us work through our issues about ps that may<br/>
hamper our children&#39;s Unschooling if left unresolved.  But if you do not<br/>
have an interest in that particular line of discussion, there is no need to<br/>
enter it.  <br/>
<br/>
There are other conversations going on relating more immediatly to<br/>
unschooling right now on this list in which you can take part.  If you have<br/>
a specific topic that you would like to raise - go for it!  I know I am<br/>
interested in whatever you would like to talk about.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe this discussion got started because someone (Greg?) asked about<br/>
ways in which ps might change or improve, or what they might do<br/>
differently.  All are valid questions when addressing the issue of<br/>
homeschooling, and gets into our reasons for wanting to homeschool in the<br/>
first place, which in turn leads to some of our negative experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, one of my ps memories (traumas?) was being sexually molested<br/>
by a boy who was held back three grades and was significantly older than me<br/>
and the other kids in the elementary school.  I was 7.  If I had not been<br/>
in public school, or if my parents had taken more of an interest in my<br/>
education rather than trusting me to the system....well.....<br/>

without going to school. And I do nto think school has much to offer except<br/>
if you need to escape a abusive household. I will say that although i hated<br/>
school and was teased it was sure better then being at home with my step<br/>
father.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786876649">Thanks Nancy _ I felt it was a relevant issue otherwise I wouldn&#39;t of raised<br/>
it - it was my opening gambit on this listserv - another aussie home<br/>
schooler told me about it - and as a lot of our own home schooling community<br/>
are a buit reluctant to talk about their experiences and offer positive<br/>
solutions, I thought I&#39;d just connect with a community that has survived a<br/>
lot longer than us here in Perth, Western Australia. Our particular h/s<br/>
group is made up  of a really good mix of humanist-types and Christian-types<br/>
- otherw have said that we have something special over here because of that<br/>
flexible configuration - and we all like it this way, so we can learn from<br/>
each other.<br/>
Here&#39;s a coopy of an article I&#39;m writing for our July issue newslwetter.<br/>
(Oh, yeah, anyone got any true life h/s stories they would allow me to<br/>
publish - we still need to keep focussed on wghat schools and ttheir<br/>
administrators do wrong.<br/>
Article:<br/>
Gregg Thorn<br/>
When I look at the �culture� that schools have become, I get the feeling<br/>
that something is amiss, something is wrong.  Sure, we all seem to survive<br/>
our own school culture, to some degree or another, but still there was<br/>
always an unpleasant or intimidating or frustrating or<br/>
disincentive-to-learning factor that  was part of our school life. And maybe<br/>
todays school culture is different to what it was for us who are now the<br/>
parents.<br/>
But what is it that niggles away at my total <br/>
acceptance of the modern school system as the �only way to go�?<br/>
	To help me analyse my feeling I�ve tried to break down my apprehension into<br/>
definable <br/>
areas:-<br/>
Parental Involvement: <br/>
For me, life is more than schooling, and the priority in the education of <br/>
my children is, firstly, their character - then their ability to relate<br/>
appropriately, with a right degree of concern, to other people. Sure, the<br/>
ability to earn money - the <br/>
medium by which we buy, sell, trade and therefore exist on a daily basis in<br/>
this society - is important, but without the foundation of integrity and<br/>
compassion and the ability to discern right from wrong, the earning of money<br/>
can become a crutch that leads psychologically to self-destructive habits<br/>
and lifestyle.<br/>
The parent is the primary character-teacher - not the custodial carer, not<br/>
the school teacher, not the �district officer�, not the legislators or the<br/>
policy makers. Character training comes mainly from observing mum and dad,<br/>
uncles and aunts, grandparents, and other influential adults in a child&#39;s<br/>
life. But those influential adults must express love towards that child -<br/>
�love� here, is the dominant ingredient for forming character. <br/>
	Without love it�s very difficult for a balanced value system to form,  let<br/>
alone a balanced emotional, and social, outlook. So when kids are deprived<br/>
of this parental presence for a whole 7 or more hours a day, five days a<br/>
week - one wonders what replaces that intimate and �normal� input, or if<br/>
anything indeed does replace it.<br/>
I personally feel that parental involvement should not only be encouraged in<br/>
schools, but should be essential. For me this is one aspect of true<br/>
�community schooling� that really starts to normalise the limited and<br/>
artificial similar-aged peer socialisation that exists today in the current<br/>
school system.<br/>
Also, the presence of community, in the form of parents, especially in the<br/>
playground area of the schoolyard during recess and lunchtime and before and<br/>
after the �classroom� hours of school, would most certainly lower the<br/>
incidence of bullying, drug trafficking, negative peer behaviours, abuse of<br/>
teachers, and would also decrease the opportunity for paedophilic<br/>
activities.<br/>
Teachers:<br/>
I personally know some school teachers, and there are a number of home<br/>
schooling parents who are, or have been, teachers. School teachers can be<br/>
the most concerned and caring people - some are - but they can�t take the<br/>
place of parents, can�t develop the same kind of relationship with a child<br/>
that a parent has - it�s not their role, nor do I know of any who think of<br/>
it as their role. Their role is to deliver an educational package to the<br/>
students who are compulsorily put into their charge. Not many families have<br/>
25 or more kids in their care for 7 hrs of daylight time, five days a week -<br/>
but teachers have to operate in such a situation. It�s not a natural setting<br/>
that is found in any human family, so the teachers shouldn�t expect, nor be<br/>
expected, to be �family� to their students. Their role is to impart<br/>
knowledge - and impart it according to a procedure laid down by others -<br/>
others who are not as intimately involved in this imparting of knowledge as<br/>
teachers are. Lets not examine teachers in this analysis of the system -<br/>
lets examine the system, and the mindset that can only envisage this type of<br/>
system as being the �best for all�.<br/>
�Custodial Care� mentality:<br/>
The family, the parents, and the extended family, are the natural and<br/>
optimal nurturing growth unit for any child. �Custodial care� - often touted<br/>
as a viable alternative to the family - can never ever provide the nurturing<br/>
and emotionally balanced environment that the family unit can - or indeed<br/>
that a �fostering� family unit can.<br/>
Yes, sadly, there is abuse in individual families, and even cultural forms<br/>
of �abuse� among certain ethnographic philosophies. But the record of<br/>
custodial care in the area of abuse generally far outweighs the negative and<br/>
detrimental effect that any one individual family can have on the lives and<br/>
potential of children.<br/>
The ABC�s weekly TV current affairs item, The 7:30 Report,  recently aired a<br/>
story documenting a report on the widespread institutionalised abuse of<br/>
children in both state-run, and church-run, �children�s homes� in Queensland<br/>
- the lesson is that its easy for abuse to happen where many children are<br/>
confined in a location with a minimum number of �carers� - none of whom are<br/>
their parents - and even where the level of concern for the children is of<br/>
the highest quality. Good intentions cannot, by themselves, replace loving<br/>
parents.  On the same TV program was a story about young people in sport and<br/>
how  their attitudes and psychosomatic faculties were focused into <br/>
unhealthy and unrealistic expectations, because the sport became the sole<br/>
provider of esteem and acceptance and popularity.<br/>
Much like the value we place on �education� today, can warp the outlook of<br/>
young minds because the more important aspects of life are de-emphasised or<br/>
even disregarded, in favour of the nebulous virtue of a �good, high income�<br/>
job. Suicide does not discriminate between different income levels. <br/>
Saturation Education:<br/>
 I realise that it�s a good thing to equip our kids with lots of relevant<br/>
information for their future, not only to help them learn about potential<br/>
career areas, but also to help them learn about aspects of the big wild<br/>
world around us, what makes it tick, etc. But the forcing of this style of<br/>
information acquisition seems to benefit only some, not all.  For some, this<br/>
style becomes stressful, not just information overload, but overloading<br/>
their personal unique areas of competency and understanding. It can be a<br/>
mediocre experience - not punctuated with high and low spots of consuming<br/>
interest, but uniformly bland and therefore undigestible in its presented<br/>
format. Its like you�re trying to conquer a disease with a cocktail of<br/>
antibiotics - not appreciating the synergy of some of the chemical<br/>
ingredients, nor the diverse range of strengths/weaknesses of the individual<br/>
immune systems - instead of tailoring the antibiotic to the specific<br/>
individual and the specific disease. <br/>
	To me, a �love of learning� is first required before any learning strategy<br/>
can be effective - this love of learning, once activated, will show certain<br/>
tendencies towards certain subjects of interest. Then we can use different<br/>
strategies to help the child to satisfy its desire to learn about that<br/>
certain subject. All of this will automatically involve the core tools of<br/>
reading, writing, calculating - and, in the course of natural events, lead<br/>
to other subjects of interest.<br/>
As an adult I just turn off when faced with any subjects relating to<br/>
�economics�, or �accountancy�, or �statistics� - yet I still use a necessary<br/>
modicum of those subjects in my daily life - but I don�t need to be an<br/>
expert in them to live my life competently. As a window cleaner I don�t need<br/>
a lot of the information I was subjected to at school, but my general<br/>
knowledge gained from personal interest in a number of subjects, helps me to<br/>
successfully �socialise� with my clientele while I clean their windows. (It<br/>
slows down the dollar per hour rate too - but hey, life�s more than work,<br/>
more than money, more than economic rationalism - life�s about<br/>
relationships!) <br/>
As a science journalist I come across a whole spectrum of matters that<br/>
interest me - but I should be a failure because I�m not an academic! <br/>
Shouldn&#39;t I?   After all, school failed to make me an academic - so I<br/>
shouldn�t even attempt to be a science journalist. No, not so. My love of,<br/>
and interest in, a variety of science matters carries me through - I just<br/>
ask a lot more questions, and then, hopefully, try to write them down in a<br/>
style that is understandable and even informative - without being academic. <br/>
	That�s another point about our current schooling system�s educational<br/>
strategies - it�s more oriented towards the academically gifted ones. That�s<br/>
great, if your gift is academics, or the logical/mathematical/linguistic<br/>
type of �intelligence� - but sad if your areas of intelligence are quite<br/>
different, e.g., musical, spatial, interpersonal, intrapersonal, bodily<br/>
kinesthetic, etc. What I�m saying here is that it should be a case of <br/>
�horses for courses� when it comes to learning strategies - note, I said<br/>
learning strategies, not teaching strategies - we need to consider both<br/>
aspects of the educational process here.<br/>
	Lots of kids suffer, in various ways, from their inability to process the<br/>
information fed to them in this one �saturation� strategy. They can react<br/>
negatively, or be the target for antisocial behaviour because they can be<br/>
seen as dumb or weak, and other students, unable to fit in also, seem to<br/>
want to exercise control-freak behaviour over these �misfits� so that they<br/>
themselves can feel justified, or �cool�, in a system that has failed to<br/>
cater for all types of learning requirements and speeds and <br/>
vulnerabilities. <br/>
Don�t the educational authorities realise the negative mental impact that<br/>
the words �dumb� or �below average� can have on a growing child, or<br/>
understand  the impact of negative peer pressure, or the lack of <br/>
�sensitivity towards sensitivities� that exists in the artificial construct<br/>
of the schoolyard or even in the classroom itself. Don�t they understand<br/>
that not every child learns at the same rate, and to be promoted to the next<br/>
grade without having fully understood the current grade could be setting the<br/>
child up for �failure�.? <br/>
(In the field of Human Resource Management it�s called the �Peter Principle�<br/>
- promoted beyond your ability.)<br/>
Makes you wonder doesn�t it?  If the educational authorities were truly<br/>
interested in the learning potential and the mental welfare of our children,<br/>
they would, themselves, take time out to learn about the real needs of<br/>
children in this very complex and very dangerous society that we live in. A<br/>
good education is not the primary tool for survival in the modern world of<br/>
vocational and avocational careers - but a good character and a love of<br/>
learning are certainly better foundations for a satisfying career to be<br/>
built upon. And these things are not part of the school system�s curriculum.<br/>
Conclusion:<br/>
I think the challenge is for the bureaucrats to get off their �custodial<br/>
care� crusade and start to be a big help, rather than a �big stick�, to the<br/>
�home schooling� community of Australia. The punitive aspects of the West<br/>
Australian 1997 School Education Bill clearly show that the mentality at the<br/>
top has to change - from authoritarian and �I know best�, to �hey, we�re all<br/>
in this together, how can we help each other, what can we learn from each<br/>
other�.  Parents have to let go of the apron strings when their children<br/>
grow into adulthood and are no longer their responsibility - why can�t the<br/>
�custodial carers� realise that the education of other people�s children was<br/>
never their right or responsibility in the first place. <br/>
We don�t just need a home schooling board to oversee contentious issues that<br/>
can arise between the Ed Dept and home schoolers, we need a board of home<br/>
schoolers and teachers and educational psychologists alike to sit down and<br/>
nut out a better deal for our children - mentally, emotionally, and<br/>
educationally. I�m sure such a think tank could come up with some very<br/>
helpful positive and creative ways where the Ed Dept could become a real<br/>
positive force in the education of home schooling children, taking a<br/>
proactive helpful role, rather than the current punitive harmful one that it<br/>
seems to pursue. <br/>
But the development of character, and construction of a balanced emotional<br/>
outlook, I believe, should be left to us parents. And while I welcome a<br/>
general societal concern for the wellbeing of all children, I don�t believe<br/>
that anyone but the parent has a �custodial� right or responsibility to<br/>
their own children. <br/>
A different style of learning, as in various �home schooling� strategies,<br/>
does not necessarily put a child at moral risk - but maybe a school campus<br/>
that allows bullying (of various types),  drugs, anti-social behaviour,<br/>
abuses of teachers (leading to lack of respect for authority in general),<br/>
negative peer pressure, and negative �pigeon-holing�, does.  It�s something<br/>
that all concerned parents and teachers need to think about.<br/>
(PS - My  headmaster, at Double Bay Primary School in NSW, was one of the<br/>
nicest and encouraging teachers I have ever met - he was a  real <br/>
�grandfather� - under his tutelage I once got 298 out of 300 for arithmetic.<br/>
[Other teachers didn�t have the same effect on me.]   So I hope by this<br/>
article that I don�t dishonour his profession or his love for his fellow man<br/>
or his concern for the kids in his charge. Thanks, Mr Hoorigan!)<br/>
