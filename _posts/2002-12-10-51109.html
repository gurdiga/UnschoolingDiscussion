<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Maybe my question here, as well, is does phonetic oriented exposure<br/>
&gt; complicate or enhance or can go either way depending on the child?  I am not<br/>
&gt; always able to present myself clearly...especiallly when I am in the midst<br/>
&gt; of a ponder...hope I am making sense!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suppose it would depend on how it&#39;s presented.  But I don&#39;t think you can<br/>
avoid having any exposure to phonics whatsover.  They&#39;re all over the place.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t teach my son phonics so he could read.  He would ask about the<br/>
sounds letters make when he saw things in print.  And when we sat down<br/>
together with easy books, sometimes I&#39;d point out something that might help<br/>
him.  For example, he tried to say the silent e&#39;s on the ends of words, so<br/>
we talked about how e is quiet but manipulative, because he changes the<br/>
sound of the other letters but doesn&#39;t say anything himself.  And Tim got<br/>
mad at c, because he&#39;s a thief without a sound but steals s or k&#39;s sound, so<br/>
you never knew which sound he was going to be!<br/>
<br/>
Is that phonics?  Of course.  But phonetic oriented exposure sounds very<br/>
teachy, and you don&#39;t need to teach him to read.  He&#39;ll read himself when<br/>
he&#39;s good and ready.<br/>
