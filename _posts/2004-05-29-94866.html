&lt;&lt; Are you referring to &quot;Damask&quot; with the pattern the same color as the main<br/>
cloth? Damask is used for table cloths a lot. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.  That&#39;s cool cloth too, and old-timey, but not old-timey enough, and too <br/>
thin.<br/>
<br/>
This other stuff is more like toweling, but not terrycloth, more like a fat <br/>
version of some dishtowels.  My friend who knows the most about weaving is off <br/>
being medieval this weekend so I can&#39;t call her.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Damask gets particular designs and borders, and though there are raised and <br/>
lowered parts, this stuff is more a diaper pattern (in the medieval sense of <br/>
diaper, an overall diamond thing).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OH DUH!  GOOGLE!!<br/>
damask <br/>
a fabric of linen or cotton or silk or wool with a reversible pattern woven <br/>
into it <br/>
a table linen made from linen damask <br/>
[denim, dungaree, jean <br/>
a coarse durable twill-weave cotton fabric ]<br/>
diaper <br/>
a fabric (usually cotton or linen) with a distinctive woven pattern of small <br/>
repeated figures <br/>
<br/>
------<br/>
<br/>
DIAPER CLOTH is a twill, dobby or plain woven absorbent cotton.<br/>
<br/>
I knew the term from illumination/painting, so it&#39;s the same in cloth.<br/>
<br/>
From an inventory of 18th C. Gunston Hall Plantation in Maryland:<br/>
1 Dozn fine diaper Napkin IwL 1 to 12 2.15.-- <br/>
1 fine Diaper Table cloth IwL No 12 1. 5. 4[?]  <br/>
<br/>
(Sorry to be talking to myself this way with my hands on the list, but it <br/>
helps me know the name of what I was trying to talk about before.)<br/>
