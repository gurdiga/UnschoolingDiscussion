I really loved John Holt, and Grace Llewylln.
<br>There re so many great books out there.&nbsp; I just kept reading everything
out there I could find.&nbsp; I also loved reading Home Education magazine,

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062479526">My favorite is Nancy Wallace&#39;s &quot;Child&#39;w Work: Taking Children&#39;s Choices<br/>
Seriously&quot;.  I also think (to help confirm yourself in your decision),<br/>
it is worth reading John Taylor Gatto&#39;s &quot;Dumbing us Down: The Hidden<br/>
Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling.<br/>
