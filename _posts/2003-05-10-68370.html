LOL! Casey *just* asked me to do this for her. The kids are sitting <br/>
here right now debating whether it would be &quot;cheating&quot; or not. I told <br/>
them that IMHO they&#39;ve done just fine learning everything they set <br/>
out to learn this year. That&#39;s worth all A&#39;s in my book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271970208">What kind of report card did you make up?  Will they accept just a <br/>
paper printed off of the computer that says <br/>
<br/>
Report card<br/>
<br/>
Math A<br/>
Reading A<br/>
Art A  <br/>
etc. <br/>

the other day. If I do, I&#39;ll just put a homeschool name on it (our <br/>
current is Barking Dog Free School) and give them some subjects and <br/>
grades like you listed. I figure they&#39;ll accept what I give them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044714109">The teacher supply stores near us sell report cards for less than a dollar.  <br/>
It would be simple to type/print in a school name and fill in the blanks.  <br/>
Seems the most &quot;official&quot; looking to me and least likely to cause any <br/>
glares.  LOL, you could even use different inks and make it look like you&#39;ve <br/>
been using it for a while!<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought!<br/>

Oh I&#39;m not afraid of their glares.At 43, I&#39;m probably old enough to <br/>
be the mother of most of the people working at Chuck e Cheese&#39;s <br/>
anyway. I&#39;ll have that air of authority all on my own. &lt;g&gt; Besides, I <br/>
look forward to enlightening them about homeschooling/unschooling. <br/>
They&#39;ll never know what hit &#39;em.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820617243">Well...I plan on using them tomorrow so I&#39;ll let you know how it <br/>
goes.  We&#39;ve never been to a chuckecheese before (none around us but <br/>
tomorrow we&#39;re going on a trip and there&#39;s one on the way) so the <br/>
kids are VERY excited.  <br/>
