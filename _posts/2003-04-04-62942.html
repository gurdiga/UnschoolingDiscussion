&lt;&lt;  Have any of the children <br/>
 who attended last year&#39;s conference written about it from a child&#39;s <br/>
 point of view? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My article had a quote from one of the kids. So far I don&#39;t know of any <br/>
longer pieces written by one of the kids, but it could be out there.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

great.&quot;  For me it brought tears to my eyes to see other children like mine.  <br/>
They fit in so easily and talked with each other and instantly started <br/>
playing with no gender or age separation.  The adults all treated the <br/>
children with such respect.  Not just their own children but all the <br/>
children.  The children had freedom.  Parents watching but not interfering.  <br/>
Just allowing their children to explore.  It was really great for my children <br/>
and when you see a room full of unschooled children you can really see how <br/>
they are different.  Confident, with ideas and thoughts, questions and <br/>
answers.<br/>
Great for my boys.<br/>

said he thought everyone seemed to have a really good time. I know we did!<br/>
