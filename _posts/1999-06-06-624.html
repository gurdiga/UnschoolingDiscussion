<div id="ygrps-yiv-33983469">I don&#39;t know how off topic this is, but I don&#39;t know where else to turn!<br/>
<br/>
Please, if anyone can help us, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
We want to move back to the States very much.  Unschooling is difficult <br/>
- even for my two year old - just because the only place to play is in <br/>
the street or the parking lot.  Mook (ds) does have friends, but their <br/>
parents are wary of letting their children play with a foreigner who <br/>
doesn&#39;t even go to baby genius school (how could I deprive my <br/>
child!?)...  Our problem is this:  DH has not been able to get a job.  <br/>
We have applied to everything we can find (that he is qualified for) on <br/>
the internet and through word of mouth, but no one will hire him, and I <br/>
really don&#39;t know why.  He&#39;s an electronic engineer with two years <br/>
experience in the field (though he has seven years of official other <br/>
work experience), native Japanese, fluent in English.  Willing to work <br/>
as a translator.  He&#39;s such a hard worker.  Does anybody know anybody <br/>
who might be willing to get him a job?  He&#39;s a Japanese citizen <br/>
(authorized to work in the United States).<br/>
<br/>
Please forgive me for posting this to the whole list.  I just don&#39;t know <br/>
what else to do.  We really want to move to the States so Mook can learn <br/>
about nature (anybody who&#39;s been to Japan recently knows there is no <br/>
nature here), and also so I can drive (it can cost more than $5000 worth <br/>
of yen to get a drivers licence here!) him to the library and the park.  <br/>
There are so many other reasons.  What would someone do in my situation?<br/>

Love, Melanie in Japan</div>

I had the same problem moving from one state to another. NO one would<br/>
promise me a job until I actually moved. They&#39;d been burned by too many<br/>
people who after being promised the job didn&#39;t actually move. While I can&#39;t<br/>
help you with a job, I can tell you that I live in a very safe area, my<br/>
children can stay outside riding their bikes in the private road here until<br/>
late and we can leave our doors unlocked at all times (but I feel safer if<br/>
they are locked while we sleep). We live in a mobile home park and if you<br/>
don&#39;t mind that there are a couple of homes for sale here that are pretty<br/>
nice for about $4000 (two bedrooms). This is a college town (1.5 miles<br/>
away) so there are lots of jobs, nothing terrific right away, but enough to<br/>
easily pay the bills until finding something just right. Population of the<br/>
town itself is about 7000, but this is farming country so we are really in<br/>
the country, (my children grew up watching ducks cross the streets and cars<br/>
stopping for them!!) Email me privately if you want more information.<br/>
