<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294959558">I&#39;m up in Toronto and most people are thrilled with the warm winters we&#39;ve been having. You hear people remark that if this is global warming then global warming great! No snow anymore! <br/>
<br/>
Not a clue of how vulnerable we are, not even a consideration. Sometimes I wish that I was as oblivious. <br/>

Who said &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot;? You know the older I get the more sense those old sayings make.<br/>

  Well, yes actually it is.  Obviously, in your region the climate used <br/>
  to be slightly different. People got used to putting there warm <br/>
  clothes up in February and getting their spring stuff out.  The fact <br/>
  that you can&#39;t rely on the weather to cooperate anymore IS a symptom <br/>
  of global warming.  <br/>
  I wish they would find a better word for it.  People seem to think <br/>
  that it means every place on the planet will get warmer <br/>
  simultaneously.  That&#39;s not what is happening.  The overall average <br/>
  temperature is rising (and no reputable scientist says otherwise <br/>
  anymore).  This is causing climate CHANGE.  Some areas may even get <br/>
  cooler.  Some like Ohio will get less predictable but milder overall. <br/>
  Storm patterns will change.<br/>
  And the problem is that some people cannot disassociate the debate <br/>
  over WHETHER it is happening (even the Rebublicans are starting to <br/>
  admit it) from the one about WHY it is happening.  And the majority of <br/>
  average citizens don&#39;t understand a lot of what they read about it and <br/>
  don&#39;t take the time to investigate it fully to understand.<br/>
