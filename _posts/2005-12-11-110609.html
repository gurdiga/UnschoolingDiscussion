<div id="ygrps-yiv-285423508">Just as unschooling allows us to uncover our unconscious beliefs about<br/>
education, &#39;whole life unschooling&#39; prompts examination of another set<br/>
of pre-conceptions about childrearing.<br/>
<br/>
Sound interesting? Then read on to learn about a new parents&#39; support<br/>
group that is forming in the Boston suburban area.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re thrilled to announce a monthly whole-life unschooling parents&#39;<br/>
discussion and support group. We will meet in Dedham, Natick, Newton,<br/>
or Sharon, Massachusetts, on the first Thursday of each month from<br/>
7:00 â€“ 8:30 pm, beginning January 5, 2006 in Natick. People with<br/>
children of all ages are welcome. Please join<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BostonAreaWhole-LifeUnschoolers/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BostonAreaWhole-LifeUnschoolers/</a><br/>
if you are interested in more information (about meeting topics or directions).<br/>
<br/>
This monthly meeting is for parents who seek respectful<br/>
(non-authoritative) relationships with their children, throughout all<br/>
aspects of daily life.<br/>
Letting go of parental control is an ongoing transitional process that<br/>
takes time.  Too often we have trouble envisioning solutions and<br/>
resort to coercion out of desperation. Therefore, we are coming<br/>
together to support each other in finding peaceful<br/>
alternatives - ways to live in cooperation, focused on consensus as the ideal.<br/>
<br/>
There will be a suggested reading for each meeting (such as a small<br/>
article online) that will be the starting place for each monthly<br/>
discussion.  The reading for January&#39;s meeting is:  Living by<br/>
Principles Instead of by Rules at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/rules">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>
<br/>
We hope that you will join us!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-160446809">Please join us for the next Boston Area Whole Life Unschooling<br/>
meeting. This monthly meeting is for parents who seek respectful<br/>
(non-authoritative) relationships with their children, throughout all<br/>
aspects of daily life. Letting go of parental control is an ongoing<br/>
transitional process that takes time. As unschooling allows us to<br/>
uncover our unconscious beliefs about education, whole life<br/>
unschooling prompts examination of another set of pre-conceptions<br/>
about childrearing.<br/>
<br/>
The group is intended for parents who believe that all problems have<br/>
solutions and that while we still occasionally resort to coercion out<br/>
of desperation, it is not right or necessary. Therefore we are coming<br/>
together to support each other in finding peaceful alternatives: ways<br/>
to live in cooperation, focused on consensus as the ideal.<br/>
<br/>
Next meeting date: February 2, 2006<br/>
<br/>
Time: 7:00-8:30<br/>
