<div id="ygrps-yiv-919932497">The ONLY thing that has worked for me is to change my shopping habits.  I <br/>
buy fresh fruits and veggies as the bulk of my purchase.  I don&#39;t believe <br/>
cutting out carbs so I buy only whole wheat breads, crackers, pastas, etc.  <br/>
*If* I buy anything &#39;less than&#39; I only buy what we will eat in one sitting.  <br/>
A few days ago, I bought a small bag of cookies.  We each had 3 and the bag <br/>
was empty.  When I buy cokes, er uh, pops (sorry, in Texas they are all <br/>
cokes! lol) I only buy enough for each of us to have one.  In this respect, <br/>
it&#39;s nice that my husband  is gone so much of the time.  He grumbles about <br/>
my newly acquired healthy food choices but he has the option of buying junk <br/>
food himself when he is out.  I ask him to please not bring things like that <br/>
home and for the most part, he is happy to oblige.<br/>
<br/>
We are slowly switching to a more raw diet but I also find that only buying <br/>
foods that require cooking makes me less tempted to rush in and gobble up <br/>
something just because I feel like eating.  If I am truly hungry, I tend to <br/>
go ahead and cook.  If not, I tend to eat fruit or grab a glass of water <br/>
instead.<br/>
<br/>
Buying bottled water has been a big help.  I tend to go for that now rather <br/>
than food or junk drinks.  It is convenient and icey cold.  Phasing out <br/>
juices has been another goal which the bottled water helps with too.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the number, but in the last month or so I have definitely lost <br/>
weight.  My clothes are getting loose and I FEEL so much better!<br/>
<br/>
I have struggled as long as I can remember with my weight and eating habits. <br/>
  Learning more about nutrition and changing my shopping habits has done <br/>
wonders for me!<br/>
<br/>
Children and adults who consume too many cokes are at risk for a lot of <br/>
problems.  Though not all are severe, they have the potential to become so.  <br/>
I don&#39;t have to tell my kids no about cokes if they aren&#39;t right there in <br/>
the fridge.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is to look at your shopping habits and begin there.  Fill your <br/>
fridge with water and fresh, raw fruits and veggies.  Splurge on Ranch and <br/>
yogurt to dip them in.  Don&#39;t buy quick foods, prepackaged foods, etc.  <br/>
Besides the lure of a quick fix, they aren&#39;t nearly as healthy and some are <br/>
even harmful.<br/>

Raine replies: I am very anti-soda. My beloved hubby drinks too much (in my opinion) also. I tell my kids that my restrictions regarding sodas, and that type of thing, are made because I love them, and care about their health.<br/>
I also share the reasons behind my decisions. Usually, once I explain why I am opposed to certain things (ie. we avoid dyes in foods because they cause behavioral problems in kids, or we only eat whole grain breads because they clean our colons, or these fruits help make our immune system strong...) they are all for it. They know I am notorious for my research, and when they understand the reason behind my decisions, they actually back them. I love to hear them explaining these things to their friends! And the friends find it a novelty (Yeah, all their food is ORGANIC). lol!Their friends also are enthralled that I make everything from scratch, and they love to help me. I often have several kids in the kitchen while I cook/bake. My niece doesn&#39;t find it so endearing, however! <br/>
I do allow the occasional soda, as I don&#39;t want to be a dictator, but they realize it&#39;s a special treat. I follow these same guidelines myself, of course.<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

Buying everything in its &quot;raw&quot; form has made a big difference for us. A little education, and reading all labels, has made this an easy transition.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nancy, it has worked wonders for me. I am very grateful to this list for <br/>
helping me with defooding. The only way it worked for me, though, was to <br/>
truly let go of restrictions on food. Everything was available if I wanted <br/>
it. I have a little voice in my head that says, &quot;You can eat anything you <br/>
want.&quot; After a lifetime of food restrictions this has been so freeing. I <br/>
don&#39;t know how it will work for you, but I have found that many things lose <br/>
their appeal if I am truly allowed to have them. I realized a few days ago <br/>
that I was only eating foods because I chose them, not because they were <br/>
&quot;good for me&quot; or because I was feeling bad and wanted to stuff myself with <br/>
something &quot;bad.&quot; I still eat oreos but only a few because that is how many <br/>
I want. There was a time when I wouldn&#39;t start to eat certain foods because <br/>
I knew I couldn&#39;t stop.<br/>
<br/>
I raised my sons with few food restrictions and they make varied and <br/>
healthy choices everyday. They like many foods and eat none to excess. Now <br/>
we have no food restrictions. It was scary at first and some of the choices <br/>
and timing of the choices was hard to get used to, but now it is not an issue.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Has your husband always drunk this much pop? It may be hard for your son to <br/>
understand the defooding if his dad is emotionally attached to his pop. <br/>
Then again, with no restrictions some people may still drink large amounts <br/>
of something or other. Again, I think everything has to be available. One <br/>
thing I do with my kids and husband is pass on what I learn about nutrition <br/>
to them. Nothing major, just things like how fibre helps you poop (had a <br/>
problem with that recently) and oranges have vitamin C, and lack of protein <br/>
may make you crave sugar.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>After a lifetime of emotional attachment to food it&#39;s not surprising you <br/>
are struggling. We may struggle all our lives but I hope not. It takes <br/>
time. I think,too, it may take a few (or more than a few) binges. There was <br/>
someone here last time this was discussed who said she lived on coke and <br/>
chocolate for a few months :-).<br/>
<br/>
I want to tell you as well that I am not overweight and have never been as <br/>
an adult, but was as a child. I always believed that if I did not control <br/>
myself constantly I would gain weight. Turns out it is not true. I gained a <br/>
few pounds at first but lost them again. I feel a lot lighter, though :-)<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised at the first two responses you received. I thought maybe I <br/>
was reading one of my other lists. Providing healthy food is important; <br/>
telling your kids to eat that and only that is harmful, I believe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048808643">Hi Nancy,<br/>
<br/>
I gained a considerable amount of weight the last two years from first going on Depo Provera, and then my business moving out of my house, anxiety, and overeating/under exercising.  When we took on unschooling a few months ago, I naturally fell into defooding.  Margaux eats whatever she wants to eat, pretty much, but we are now exercising a lot more than we had done.<br/>
<br/>
I joined It Figures, and Margaux has a yard now and a few active friends with whom she runs and plays all day most days.  I think the exercise is definitely helping me.  It&#39;s a little reminder to grab the carrots instead of the crackers, but I know I can still eat the crackers if I want to because I&#39;m working out 6 times a week.<br/>
<br/>
As for the pop, my husband and I both drink a lot of soda.  Margaux doesn&#39;t drink very much.  She prefers skim milk, water, or orange juice.  The Tropicana orange juice with Lots &#39;o Pulp is her favorite and she usually finishes off a half gallon of it within two days.  We just get one of those each grocery period so I don&#39;t worry about it.<br/>
<br/>
Shahram (my DH) and I drink diet soda, but my friend has been urging me to get off of it.  I&#39;ve noticed that some sodas make us want more than others.  For instance, when Shahram and I split a can of Diet Sam&#39;s Choice Caffeine free Cola, we want another right away, and perhaps even a third.  When we split a can of Diet Lemon Pepsi Twist, we are satisfied with only one.  Would your husband be amenable to switching types of soda?<br/>
<br/>
The main thing in staying healthy and maintain or reducing to a healthy weight is daily exercise.  Without daily movement, when we are dieting to lose weight, we are losing muscle, and that includes heart muscle.  So, make sure to exercise daily for at least 20 minutes.  Of course, ask your doctor before beginning any fitness program.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps some.<br/>
Nichole<br/>

<br/>
**There was<br/>
&gt; someone here last time this was discussed who said she lived on coke and<br/>
&gt; chocolate for a few months :-).**<br/>
<br/>
That was me!  :0)<br/>
<br/>
And now,,,I hardly ever eat chocolate and even more rarely drink a Coke.<br/>
<br/>
Growing up for me was,  &quot;eat this, don&#39;t eat that&quot;.   Or how about this one,<br/>
&quot;Oh, Kelli, you really shouldn&#39;t have that.&quot;   What a way to mold a young<br/>
person.   I worried all the time about what I was going to eat and whether<br/>
or not I&#39;d be fat or unhealthy.    Since letting those things go, I&#39;ve<br/>
dropped my extra weight.   People used to ask me,  &quot;what are you doing,<br/>
you&#39;ve lost weight&quot;!   I said,  I&#39;ve just started eating,   eating what I<br/>
want and listened to my body more.   I was letting go of the emotional<br/>
baggage around food.<br/>
<br/>
I feel very strongly about allowing our children to develop their own eating<br/>
patterns.  Sure we talk about this food and that.  Like what Donna Andrea<br/>
said:  the fiber thing,  what vitamins are in what foods, stuff like that.<br/>
But, by decriminalizing the food there won&#39;t be that attraction.<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest was younger,  around 8 years ago.   I limited and only bought<br/>
certain things.   When he would have the chance, be at other&#39;s houses,  he<br/>
would choose the &quot;junk foods&quot; and sodas as much as he could.   If we only<br/>
provide certain types of food in our houses how are they going to know how<br/>
to make their own choices?   What are they going to do away from home?<br/>
<br/>
In the last year or so, since we&#39;ve lifted those restrictions he did go<br/>
through a phase where he  drank several sodas a day.  But he will now stop<br/>
himself,  I&#39;ll hear him say, &quot;hmm, I&#39;m thirsty,  I&#39;m going to have a Dew,<br/>
no, well, maybe just some juice.  No,  chocolate milk sounds good.&quot;<br/>
Sometimes he&#39;ll just grab a water bottle.   I do try to keep water bottles<br/>
full and in the refridgerator,  much easier to grab than the glass in the<br/>
cupboard!  &lt;g&gt;   Water tastes so good right out of the fridge!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,,,,<br/>
<br/>
Nancy,  keep chuggin&#39; away.   You will get through this!   Just keep saying<br/>
to yourself that they will end up choosing what is good for them.   That<br/>
might not always be what is good in your eyes.   Right now my son is big on<br/>
corndogs!  I&#39;m not a big meat eater, so this doesn&#39;t sound good to me.   But<br/>
they will figure it out,  they&#39;ll see how they feel and will want to feel<br/>
good.    I think you&#39;re doing a great thing by allowing them to figure it<br/>
out.<br/>

preparing food from them is much cheaper than buying processed foods <br/>
that you only have to heat up. For one thing, you can buy a lot of <br/>
your staple foods in bulk and organic (organic wheat, for instance! <br/>
what a difference in flavor organic wheat makes, since we grind our <br/>

&lt;&lt; Sorry to revisit this stuff, but in trying to adopt a complete unschooling <br/>
lifestyle and philosophy, I need to deal with the food issue as well. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you have to include food to be completely unschooling, though I <br/>
do think that kids can learn about food the same way they can learn about <br/>
anything else.  <br/>
<br/>
The more worried you are about his choices, seems to me, the less you should <br/>
limit or judge those choices.  He can&#39;t make really honestly free choices <br/>
while you&#39;re taking in your breath or grimacing or relaxing or smiling or cooing <br/>
or whimpering on the side.<br/>
<br/>
Lori Odhner did a workshop at a homeschooling conference once in which she <br/>
proved to us VERY quickly that it&#39;s not just what parents say or do that <br/>
persuades a child.  One person would leave the room, and the others would decide what <br/>
behavior they wanted that person to perform.  One was to walk over to a <br/>
bookshelf and take out a certain binder.<br/>
<br/>
The person came in and all the others, only with noises, no hand gestures, no <br/>
words, but just the rising approval   ooooh! or the disapproval,   eh, uh...  <br/>
kinds of vowel noises, rising and falling voice, within maybe four minutes <br/>
that notebook was off that shelf and in her hand.  <br/>
<br/>
After another couple of such demos, I asked if we could do one to Lori.  <br/>
Sure!  She left the room, and we decided to get her to sit on the floor right <br/>
under the chalkboard and twirl her hair.   <br/>
<br/>
She did.<br/>
<br/>
So claiming that we didn&#39;t tell them what they could or couldn&#39;t eat might be <br/>
looked at in that light.<br/>
<br/>
I was grumpy last night because Holly wanted a bowl of beans and cheese when <br/>
I had made a fairly elaborate chicken with walnuts and artichokes thing, and <br/>
those are all things she likes.  <br/>
<br/>
Look at that!!  One form of protein over another??!  What was I grumpy <br/>
about!?  &lt;g&gt;  (MY personal feelings, that&#39;s all.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s complicated for such a simple thing, huh?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357853243">What Donna Andrea said, and then some!<br/>
I was pretty amused when the &#39;buy healthy food and explain why&#39; suggestions <br/>
came across the unschooling list.  ...not that they aren&#39;t excellent things <br/>
to do!  It&#39;s part of eating!  But it&#39;s only *part* of eating!  The other <br/>
part&#39;s emotional and that&#39;s what it seems like you might be dealing with <br/>
right now?<br/>
<br/>
So, definitely buy &#39;healthy&#39;, but buy emotionally healthy!  Get what you <br/>
crave.  Get what calls to you.  Get twice as much as you think you *should* <br/>
have.  Get home and let yourself eat as much as you want, when you want <br/>
to.  Don&#39;t double-guess yourself or limit yourself or shame yourself <br/>
(WHAT!  The WHOLE BAG of cookies!!!  You slob!)  No, no, no...  Say, <br/>
(WHAT?  The whole bag of cookies?  I&#39;d better go out and get another <br/>
bag!  They were delicious, delectable!)  You&#39;ve got to make eating okay for <br/>
yourself.  Once it&#39;s okay to eat what and when you want, THEN you&#39;ll be <br/>
free to try other things, like putting grapes next to the chips or eating <br/>
&#39;healthy&#39; (instead of emotionally-healthy-eating)<br/>
<br/>
When you get to feeling like you aren&#39;t interested in oreo&#39;s anymore, ask <br/>
your body how it&#39;d like something different, maybe, a grape?  If it wants <br/>
grapes, give it grapes!  Stock grapes in the cabinet with the chips.  Put <br/>
grapes on a plate next to the TV armchair.  Hang grapes from the <br/>
chandelier.  Maybe even get exotic and try a starfruit!  (grin)  Don&#39;t eat <br/>
the grapes though, if what you really want is the oreos, or as a way to <br/>
&#39;allow&#39; yourself the oreos!  ONLY eat what your body says it wants!  And <br/>
eat enough of it!<br/>
<br/>
Everytime you tell yourself/hubby/son that they&#39;ve got &#39;too much&#39; of <br/>
something (even if it&#39;s only by a look or a refusal to get something for <br/>
them), you&#39;re reinforcing the idea that it&#39;s &#39;limited&#39; or &#39;wrong&#39;.  Stop <br/>
adding guilt to your life!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and Happy Munching!<br/>

my Dh does not have any emotional attachment to food, and can take it or leave <br/>
it at any time. That is what I hope for my children. He was given few <br/>
restrictions when young, and it seems to have worked.Luckily he is  supportive of <br/>
this. I must try to let go of the pop thing. <br/>

the habit of choosing water. <br/>

Ds has learned to ride his bike this spring, and we are out at least once if <br/>

live in the country on 2 acres with horses etc., and are VERY active outdoors. I <br/>
find without the exercise, we all go a little batty. <br/>

I am suspicious of the sweeteners used. Your ideas are appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882599218">I think that this has been a problem in our family.  I struggle with <br/>
compulsive eating too.  My whole family is &quot;defooding&quot;, and have been <br/>
for some time.  Lifting all food restrictions went smoothly for my <br/>
boys, who are younger.  It&#39;s taking me much longer to learn to self-<br/>
regulate and despite my best intentions, I still end up binge-eating <br/>
for emotional reasons sometimes.  My concern is that I think my <br/>
daughter sees me consuming say too much food at a time and she copies <br/>
my behavior.  She&#39;s gained a lot of weight in the last year or so, <br/>
and now at her 10th birthday weighs 115 pounds and is wearing women&#39;s <br/>
small or medium clothing.  I&#39;ve kept my mouth shut and haven&#39;t said a <br/>
word to her about her weight--I don&#39;t think she even thinks of her <br/>
weight at all and doesn&#39;t realize that it might be a problem.  For <br/>
her, it&#39;s not the food restrictions or lack of that&#39;s a problem, it&#39;s <br/>
the bad habits she sees me modelling.  <br/>
<br/>
At this point, should I just keep trying to get myself under control <br/>
and hope she copies me and her weight balances out eventually, or <br/>
should I do something else?  <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;My suggestion is to look at your shopping habits and begin there.  Fill<br/>
your<br/>
fridge with water and fresh, raw fruits and veggies.  Splurge on Ranch and<br/>
yogurt to dip them in.  Don&#39;t buy quick foods, prepackaged foods, etc.<br/>
Besides the lure of a quick fix, they aren&#39;t nearly as healthy and some are<br/>
even harmful.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately for us, we don&#39;t have a problem with our kids eating what we<br/>
consider too much of anything. And we also don&#39;t have weight problems in the<br/>
family or over weight children. But this sounds like very good advice for<br/>
those that do or for those that want to switch to a different way of eating.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who is concerned with herself, her husband and son. Both<br/>
families are overweight to the point of having gastric bypasses. Her son is<br/>
large. She started this same way too. By buying gradually healthier foods<br/>
and making them readily available and appealing to her son. She will buy<br/>
occasional &quot;dessert&quot; type items in small quantities. Her son knows that they<br/>
are occasional but that he also can eat what he wants of them. At first he<br/>
would finish the whole box or package and now he saves some for later. He&#39;s<br/>
adjusting himself with what&#39;s available to him. She&#39;s also finding that he&#39;s<br/>
making better choices on his own when he&#39;s out. It seems to be working for<br/>
them and although he is still on the large size, his weight has stabilized<br/>
and he seems to find the size that&#39;s right for him. He&#39;s 8 right now.<br/>

  I&#39;ve seen this a lot working with Daisy Girl Scouts.  They fit their pants just right and then suddenly they need a belt and their ankles are showing.<br/>
<br/>
  I agree with you, though, Sandra, about modeling right behavior.  My daughter doesn&#39;t even remember my being thin until I show her pictures and then she thinks I look so pretty.  So, now, I take her to the gym with me.  Though she&#39;s not allowed on the machines, she sees me doing it 6 days a week, and understands its importance.  She knows it&#39;s to lose weight, too, though.  Thankfully, Margaux doesn&#39;t have a weight problem at all.  She&#39;s just a normal sized girl.  Many of her friends are really skinny, though.  I don&#39;t think Margaux has ever compared her body to her friends&#39;.  She&#39;s just 6 years old.  I hope to be able to keep her from feeling she needs to do that.<br/>
<br/>
  Margaux is also a very picky eater, but almost everything she eats is perfectly healthy.  She likes candy, but she would rather have some gummy fruit snacks... sometimes she&#39;ll want to eat 20 packs of them in a row.  I ask her if she feels sick on all that.  She always says no, so I don&#39;t tell her not to eat it.  But I can&#39;t/don&#39;t buy her 5 boxes a week.  She eats them when we have them.<br/>

important it was for me to give myself permission to eat anything I wanted, <br/>
not just to eat it. To take all value judgments off the food. In fact, <br/>
often I didn&#39;t even want to eat the food anyway but was just testing <br/>
myself. Sometimes I made cookies and ate many, many - and enjoyed it!<br/>
<br/>
I was buying a coffee today after a dentist appointment and I looked at the <br/>
donuts while I was waiting. Before I would have had many conflicting <br/>
thoughts about the donuts. Today I thought to myself, &quot;Do I want a donut?&quot; <br/>
and I thought, &quot;No, I really don&#39;t want a donut. In fact I don&#39;t really <br/>
like donuts from Tim Horton&#39;s, I only ate them occasionally because they <br/>
were forbidden.&quot; Amazing. I can&#39;t tell you how amazing. It&#39;s what I have <br/>

  like donuts from Tim Horton&#39;s, I only ate them occasionally because they <br/>
  were forbidden.&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  I find too that I&#39;m much more able to put something down simply because it doesn&#39;t taste as good as I had hoped.  Before this I would eat it anyway, for whatever reason...maybe hoping that it would get better just because it was &quot;forbidden&quot;??<br/>

&lt;&lt; That is hard for me to let go of. What does everyone here do? I need <br/>
 some suggestions.<br/>
 I am slowly trying to get myself to let go of the emotional attachment to <br/>
 food and the need to binge on the formerly forbidden foods. Nothing is now <br/>
 forbidden, but I worry about my children&#39;s health.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how old your kids are, but if you talk to them about their <br/>
health, and what they need to be healthy, like vitamins and calcium and such, <br/>
you&#39;ll probably go far towards not feeling as anxious ( talking about my concerns <br/>
almost always makes me feel better) and you&#39;ll feel more confident about your <br/>
kids at least knowing what they need to know to make good decisions for <br/>
themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
Alex knows all about the food pyramid, it&#39;s at USDA&#39;s website, and he knows <br/>
that sweets and oils should be eaten sparingly, and why.  Sometimes we still <br/>
eat the whole bag of Fritos but he knows why, healthwise, that&#39;s not something <br/>
we should do everyday!!  <br/>
<br/>
I drink a lot of soda and coffee, but I try to remember to drink water to <br/>
replace what I lose by drinking caffeinated things.  I talked to Alex about this, <br/>
and he has limited himself to one can of Coke a day, (although I don&#39;t!) and <br/>
is aware of the sugar in the Kool-Aid he likes (pouring that big cup of sugar <br/>
in the pitcher when he makes it helps).  <br/>
<br/>
 I try to remember that balance with food doesn&#39;t happen every day,  I look <br/>
over the longer term, a week or a month, to see if he really is not eating <br/>
enough veggies or too much sugar.  If that&#39;s what you end up seeing, talking to <br/>
them about your concerns, ask them what they would like to see more of in the <br/>
house, take em grocery shopping with you, have them make dinner one nite, plan a <br/>
week of menus with their help, that kind of thing.  <br/>
<br/>
He loves going to the farmer&#39;s market with me in the summer, and we pick out <br/>
lots of fresh veggies, and fruits, and he&#39;ll even want to try new things when <br/>
we do that.  I had to learn how to cook eggplant!!  lol  <br/>

  I find it really interesting that the food pyramid is the same as it is for fattening cattle.  My grandparents <br/>
  certainly did not eat this way, nor did their children.  None has weight problems.  What one should eat is <br/>
  very specific to that individual.  Perhaps the food pyramid is exactly what works for your body, it certainly doesn&#39;t work for everyone&#39;s body.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; daughter sees me consuming say too much food at a time and she copies<br/>
&gt; my behavior.  She&#39;s gained a lot of weight in the last year or so,<br/>
&gt; and now at her 10th birthday weighs 115 pounds and is wearing women&#39;s<br/>
&gt; small or medium clothing.  I&#39;ve kept my mouth shut and haven&#39;t said a<br/>
&gt; word to her about her weight--I don&#39;t think she even thinks of her<br/>
&gt; weight at all and doesn&#39;t realize that it might be a problem.  For<br/>
&gt; her, it&#39;s not the food restrictions or lack of that&#39;s a problem, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; the bad habits she sees me modelling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Be careful nobody else says anything to her.  I was a *very* skinny child.<br/>
When I was 11, I grew 6 inches and then got my period.  I never grew<br/>
anymore.  A year after that, I went for a checkup, and the doc told me to<br/>
lose 20 pounds.  Believe it or not, I had gone from a girl&#39;s size 14 to a<br/>
ladies size 14 without even realizing it.  I was very unaware of my own<br/>
body.  Unfortunately, the weight I was at that time turned out to be my<br/>
ideal weight, the one my body would have naturally stayed if I hadn&#39;t messed<br/>
with it by trying to diet.<br/>

He wanted to know more about food and what he &quot;should&quot;  eat everyday, and <br/>
altho I told him that I couldn&#39;t really be sure exactly what that is, the gov&#39;t <br/>
has guidelines.  He checked it out.  He noticed the big fat sections of veggies <br/>
and fruits, and we talked about why those were the biggest sections. ( <br/>
Vitamins, fiber, etc.) <br/>
<br/>
He knows they&#39;re just guidelines, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not fattening him up for <br/>
the slaughter! hee hee<br/>
