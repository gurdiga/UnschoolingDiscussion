  ***I need them to go before I<br/>
  am too sleepy to give it too them.  If they are still awake at nine<br/>
  o&#39;clock<br/>
  I am past being able to do much for them so they don&#39;t get a story as I<br/>
  am<br/>
  likely to have already climbed in my bed.  But I find that if they get in<br/>
  bed by eight I can easily read to them for 40 minutes or so...***<br/>
<br/>
  Stories on tape!  Dylan loved the Jim Weiss tapes and still listens<br/>
  sometimes.  Or nice music.  Makes me sleepy just thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
  Who said they would read in their sleep?  Sandra?  I&#39;ve done that.  Proof<br/>
  my mouth can keep going even when my brain has abandon ship.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-551499106"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Any other favorite artist?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My brother had saved the old Bill Cosby albums and when Dylan was five or<br/>
so he sent us copies.  The Chicken Heart,  Noah, and some others. <br/>
They&#39;re so hilarious, but we haven&#39;t listened in awhile.  Time to find<br/>
them again I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan liked the Growler Tapes when he was younger, but I don&#39;t think they<br/>
interest him now.<br/>
