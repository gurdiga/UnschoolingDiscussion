<div id="ygrps-yiv-323298465">Thank you Sandra Dodd and Nancy Wooton for the hints.<br/>
<br/>
I will begin my journey by reading the book, &quot;It&#39;s So Amazing: A Book About<br/>
Eggs, Sperm, Birth, Babies, and Families&quot; that a dear friend offered to<br/>
lend.<br/>
<br/>
As to what will come next, I will let below site to guide me.<br/>

thank you for the hints!<br/>
<br/>
noemi fm Japan. She just had the insight that Unschooling is deciding at<br/>
every second; unschooling is learning to taking decision by making it. That<br/>
is, unschooling is deciding which is thinking all the time.</div>

<br/>
The woman who runs scarletteen.com used to be our ..... well, we never knew<br/>
what to call her. Our Heather. She took kids in her house and played with<br/>
them. Zoe and Quinn both spent some time with her when they were little and<br/>
we had to both be somewhere at the same time. I guess you could call it day<br/>
care, but it was way too casual and part-time to be that.<br/>

&lt;&lt; unschooling is deciding which is thinking all the time &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My middle child, Marty, is 14.  <br/>
Saturday he said he had just realized that our whole lives are strings of <br/>
decisions to make.<br/>
<br/>
When I was his age, I had no way to think that, because I had very few <br/>
decisions to make.  I did what people told me to do.<br/>
<br/>
I told Marty he was right, and that even when you&#39;re sitting still, you <br/>
decide to stay there instead of getting up to do something else.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe because unschooled kids can think bigger thoughts sooner, they&#39;ll have <br/>
time in their lives to think MORE thoughts.  Maybe because they will have come <br/>
to realizations about the nature of life sooner, they will have life enough <br/>
to think big thoughts few people have thought before.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe they&#39;ll just decide to have quiet, peaceful happy lives!<br/>
<br/>
