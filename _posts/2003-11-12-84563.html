<div id="ygrps-yiv-125024482">&quot;My guess that it has to do with kid biology craving high calorie foods <br/>
because they&#39;re growing so fast.  Just a guess.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Exactly what the pediatric gastroenterologist told me.  My son is almost six <br/>
foot, and always says there is no food in the house.  There is so much food in <br/>
my house I have to keep some of it in the garage!  But it was high caloric <br/>
foods that would sustain him, and his dr. pointed that out to me.  He said it is <br/>
ESSENTIAL to have high calorie foods around for growing children.  None of my <br/>
kids have a weight problem, so it&#39;s not like I&#39;m endangering their health.  <br/>
He said some calories are strictly for the purpose of burning energy, and some <br/>
are for the purpose of growth and development.  Not everything a child eats <br/>
needs to be a fruit or vegetable.<br/>

Kirby, 17, told me yesterday he has lately been wanting pasta and more pasta. <br/>
 He thinks about pasta.  And a friend of his is working at an Italian <br/>
restaurant so he wants to go there.  He brought it up because Holly&#39;s leftover <br/>
spaghetti was on the counter and he wanted it, but she was saving it for her dad.<br/>
<br/>
Holly had chosen spaghetti of all the food in the food court, but first she <br/>
had looked at the Chinese noodles, and then looked at the Japanese noodles...<br/>
<br/>
It has just gotten cold here, and I think there might be an instinct to pack <br/>
on calories because winter&#39;s coming.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting the things I&#39;ve seen kids &quot;know&quot; and want when they&#39;re <br/>
really free to choose and request.<br/>
