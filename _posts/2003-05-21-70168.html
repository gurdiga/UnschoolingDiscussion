<div id="ygrps-yiv-22956546">I just wanted to thank everyone.  If I was not on this list, I would <br/>
be doubting my choice everyday.  We had the most wonderful evening.  <br/>
I took the kids to the beach with a friend and her kids.  It was low <br/>
tide with a mild breeze and the water was like a bath.  The kids were <br/>
LOVING the water and rolling in the sand down the sand hills.  Sand <br/>
covering every square inch of their bodies..LOL!!  We walked back to <br/>
the car with the boys wrapped in their towels and naked butt cheeks.  <br/>
That is one of those moments that stands out and you will forever <br/>
remember or would be heartbroken to forget.  I felt such peace <br/>
tonight.  No stress over reading or writing.  NO concerns with <br/>
schools and the associated playmates.  Just great fun with our <br/>
friends enjoying our community and eachother.  I am going to sleep <br/>
like a baby, which my boys are doing now.  This peace comes from <br/>
unschooling so I want to thank everyone for their general support and <br/>
constant praises of their own kids.  Those posts give me the <br/>
confidence I need everyday.<br/>
<br/>
