<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838837516">Speaking of diseases...<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago I took my two guys to visit my mom for a few days. <br/>
Yesterday while I was at work my husband noticed the 4yo playing with a <br/>
couple of brightly colored objects. Upon closer inspection, they turned out <br/>
to be *used condoms* (green and blue) which Nicky insisted were balloons <br/>
that he had found in a park where we&#39;d played in my mom&#39;s town! He&#39;d been <br/>
toting them around in his beloved backpack for two weeks. God only knows <br/>
what he&#39;d been doing with them in the meantime, though he can&#39;t have been <br/>
playing with them too much or it seems I certainly would have noticed. (He <br/>
is an ardent collector and stasher of all kinds of things -- if something in <br/>
the house is missing, we ask Nicky, or check his secret hiding places, the <br/>
ones we know about anyway).<br/>
<br/>
My husband was extremely upset and worried that maybe Nicky had been exposed <br/>
to hepatitis or AIDS or something. He was really mad at me for not being <br/>
vigilant enough at the park, although I thought I was watching the kids as <br/>
carefully as I always do, and it seemed like a nice suburban-type park. (I <br/>
was paying a lot more attention to avoiding dog poop than condoms, that&#39;s <br/>
for sure.) He puts his fingers in his mouth all the time. I&#39;m wondering if I <br/>
should worry...<br/>
<br/>
He has had all the usual vaccinations, for whatever that is worth.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is an unschooling issue because as unschoolers we are more <br/>
likely to be spending time outdoors and less in a restricted environment <br/>
(like a school)...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-676101315">HI, I certainly can understand why you are upset. I am not certain of the <br/>
health issues here and possibly another reader would know more. But I would <br/>
think he is ok. Is it possible that they were not used but just discarded? <br/>
And maybe these items have spent most of their time in the backpack and have <br/>
not been played with. The things kids get into huh! Do not feel bad, it is <br/>
impossible to see everything that happens with these little ones. You know <br/>
you were there watching him, these things just happen. <br/>
And your son is right, they really are balloons, of a sort!<br/>
peace and grace<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577477893">there is slim or no chance of Hep B or AIDS.  There might be a small chance<br/>
of Hep A, but ever so small.  There are quite a few STDs that there might be<br/>
a slim chance of, herpes being one.  But they are all very, very small on<br/>
the percentage scale.  Just to be safe (spell that worry free), I would<br/>
check with my pediatrician.<br/>
