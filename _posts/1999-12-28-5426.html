<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220846511">Hi Lynda,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your post, I think we many of us were probably trained the way <br/>
you described and I for one suffered no harm from it! However, I have a 7 yr <br/>
who trained at almost 4, and a 2.5 in diapers, so it&#39;s been pretty <br/>
reassuring to me to hear the stories of other families who have gone the <br/>
same route. My question is, how would you get them to sit on the potty while <br/>
you folded towels, applied makeup, cleaned the bathroom etc.? I was looking <br/>
at an old potty training book recently and it had pages and pages of <br/>
pictures of different models of potties. I observed that many of them came <br/>
equipped with straps! Chilling...<br/>
<br/>
The thing I have seen with moms who train before 2 is that they then must <br/>
spend the next year asking the children every half hour if they need to go, <br/>
and leading them to the potty about six times a day, and of course they <br/>
spend quite a lot of time in the bathroom taking pants on and off, wiping <br/>
and helping wash hands. They have to have extra underwear and pants packed <br/>
wherever they go and deal with about one accident a day for quite a while. <br/>
Granted mine didn&#39;t learn til he was 3.5, but once he did it was all his own <br/>
affair: He went when he needed to without being reminded or led, took his <br/>
pants on and off himself, and knew to wash up afterward, and had maybe half <br/>
a dozen accidents total. And then, what about when the child is visiting <br/>
someone without you, or you are out somewhere where it&#39;s not convenient to <br/>
sit on the potty so often? I think someone did observe recently that mothers <br/>
of the past stayed home with their children a lot more of the time.<br/>
<br/>
My mom, who had us both out of diapers before we were 2, admitted that for <br/>
that first year, it was not the toddler but her who was trained. I guess <br/>
it&#39;s just a matter of how you want to go about it.<br/>
<br/>
As I said I don&#39;t think it hurts either way, but it does seem more tedious <br/>
for all concerned if you train before they are really ready to be <br/>
independent potty-goers.<br/>

&gt;Well, I&#39;m going to play devil&#39;s advocate here.  Can someone tell me exactly<br/>
&gt;what is wrong with early toilet training if it is done right?  By right, I<br/>
&gt;would guess the way that we did it back in the dark ages.  It wasn&#39;t a big<br/>
&gt;deal, you were in the bathroom for whatever reason and you plotted the<br/>
&gt;kidlet on the toilet and asked if they thought they might want to [insert<br/>
&gt;name of choice] in the big potty.  You folded towels and put them away, put<br/>
&gt;on your make-up, cleaned the sink, whatever.  If they did, cheering, if<br/>
&gt;they didn&#39;t, no big deal and a o.k., maybe next time.  No trauma, no force,<br/>
&gt;no big deal.  Of course, the boys were the easiest as they liked to watch<br/>
&gt;it splash, kind of a monkey see, monkey do thing with daddy or uncle or big<br/>
&gt;brother.  Again, no big deal.  As long as you caught them before the<br/>
&gt;terrible 2&#39;s it wasn&#39;t any big deal.  They love making the toilet flush and<br/>
&gt;watching the water swirl and gurgle, too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sure, some folks got carried away and it became a competition but you are<br/>
&gt;going to see that in any area of child rearing.  And, all in all, it is<br/>
&gt;healthier for the kids to be out of the diapers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-766629640">I have 4 boys, 3 of whom were day and night &#39;trained&#39; between 2 and 2 1/2 years.<br/>
The other was day &#39;trained by 3 1/3, but still having &#39;accidents&#39; at night at 6.<br/>
They are just built differently. However, although I never &#39;trained&#39; them as<br/>
such, when I noticed that they had some control, they were offered the<br/>
potty/toilet (3 preferred the toilet straight off) consistently, and most diaper<br/>
changes they were reminded that they could use the potty/toilet if they wanted.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that cloth nappies encourage them, cause they feel yucky!<br/>
<br/>
BUT, I wonder: 3 of my boys learned to read between 9 and 12 years. The other<br/>
started at 3 and was more than proficient by 4 1/2. And yes, the 3 that were<br/>
early toilet trained were also the late readers. Anyone else experience that?<br/>
I&#39;ve only just noticed that correlation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-24408479">I think max it took maybe a couple of weeks.  We weren&#39;t home that much<br/>
(owning your own business plus the ranch plus the horse shows doesn&#39;t make<br/>
for a real SAHM).  I guess you would have to file me under casual because I<br/>
never did get too worked up over much of anything and I think since I<br/>
really couldn&#39;t have cared one way or the other and a big production wasn&#39;t<br/>
made of it, it worked.  Also, diapers were a kind of game, &quot;eeuuuu, let&#39;s<br/>
get rid of this soggy ol&#39; thing&quot; and other jokes like that which they<br/>
joined in with.  It wasn&#39;t a matter of shaming them but a joke between mom<br/>
and kidlet.  None of the kidlets ever had any problem asking the nearest<br/>
person we knew to help, &quot;I need ups&quot; was eldest&#39;s usual request.  The potty<br/>
chair was usually used as a stepping stool to reach the faucet for hand<br/>
washing.  I did need to keep an eye on the bathroom because training early<br/>
has some draw backs &lt;g&gt; such as toys and apples being stuff down the toilet<br/>
because they are in the room more freely than kidlets that don&#39;t &quot;use&quot; the<br/>
toilet yet.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I gotta tell you, boys were much easier (other than the night<br/>
time thing) than daughter was.  The boys took half as much time.  Of<br/>
course, after the first kidlet, the rest seem to almost &quot;train&quot; each other.<br/>
 The older boys hauled the smaller boys along with them to use the<br/>
bathroom.  I even found them flipping coins to see who got to do &quot;splash<br/>
down&quot; first (12, 4.5 and 10 mo.).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-138200502">Kidlet&#39;s 1, 2, 3 and 6 were all early readers (4 ish).  Kidlet #4 is my<br/>
&quot;instant&quot; child and that caused a problem for him with reading.  If he<br/>
can&#39;t learn something perfectly and instantly, he quits and while he could<br/>
&quot;instantly&quot; do math, he couldn&#39;t instantly read, so he quit.  Kidlet #5 is<br/>
a professional couch potato, no, that implies too much energy, he is an<br/>
over cooked noodle.  He is the only one that had any problems with potty<br/>
training and then only at night (daytime was about 14 mo).  Took too much<br/>
energy to get up and go downstairs, literally.  If he had been a heavy<br/>
sleeper, I won&#39;t have minded or if it had been for any other reason but it<br/>
was just plain old fashioned laziness.  So we had a major discussion about<br/>
this.  He didn&#39;t read well until he was about 10 and again, it was because<br/>
he was lazy, get someone else to do it for him kinda thing.  I finally had<br/>
to say that if he wanted to &quot;read&quot; a particular book, he would have to do<br/>
it himself as he was driving the other kidlets nuts.  Within a couple of<br/>
weeks he was reading everything in sight.<br/>
<br/>
So, with my kidlets, I don&#39;t see a correlation.<br/>
