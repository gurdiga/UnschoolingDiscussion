<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477855445">Lisa, This sounds to me like pretty normal first born and second born <br/>
behavior. They usuallly are very different personality types. Your younger <br/>
son probably does learn in a different way, you may be surprised one day to <br/>
realize how much he absorbs just from his environment. He may not ask <br/>
questions of his own, but I would bet he listens to the answers.I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
worry about it too much. Trying to make him more like his brother would do <br/>
more harm than good.<br/>

&gt;Hi all! I have a question that has been concerning me about my kids. I have <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;9 1/2yr. old son and a 7yr. old son. My 9 yr old will ask me every question<br/>
&gt;under the sun about everything in life. Together we find and search out the<br/>
&gt;answers to all his questions (and sometimes he reads and searches for <br/>
&gt;answers<br/>
&gt;by himself). But, my 7 yr. old never asks us any questions about anything. <br/>
&gt;He<br/>
&gt;loves dinosaurs and big trucks. He does a lot of dinosaur digging in the <br/>
&gt;back<br/>
&gt;yard and he plays with his trucks most of the day. He looks at picture <br/>
&gt;books<br/>
&gt;but doesn&#39;t yet read. I haven&#39;t pushed him in anyway to learn anything. <br/>
&gt;But,<br/>
&gt;yet he asks us no questions about anything. Is this strange or normal or<br/>
&gt;what? Is it because he learns in a different way? Should I be concerned or<br/>
&gt;just let things be? Any suggestions? I would appreciate some advice about<br/>
&gt;this.<br/>
