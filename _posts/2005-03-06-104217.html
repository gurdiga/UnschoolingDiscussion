<div id="ygrps-yiv-96403255">Have you read anything about multiple intelligences?  I have similar <br/>
issues with my older son...we are just SO DIFFERENT in some ways I&#39;m s <br/>
urprised at what he finds interesting and fun and what he doesn&#39;t.  <br/>
Well, not as much the more I read about unshcooling, his temperament and <br/>
mult. int.  My younger son however, is much like me and is a <br/>
HOMEBODY!!!  Balancing my socialite and my hermit is interesting.  they <br/>
are only 8 and 4 though.   Sometimes I have to say &quot;We are doing this&quot; <br/>
and one maybe both will enjoy it.  And sometimes one begs to do <br/>
something and I have to say We are staying home today.  I have to try to <br/>
find a balance that works for both of them.  It is easier to figure out <br/>
what will be interesting and successful the more I read about Multiple <br/>
Intelligences....But sometimes I say,  Mommy is interested in this and I <br/>
need you to come with me.  Sometimes I play &quot;x&quot; with you even when I&#39;d <br/>
rather do something else, so now, I need you to come with me even though <br/>
you may prefer to do something else.   And it turned out that we found <br/>
some common interest at the Art Museum (NOT THAT I EXPECTED TO!!)  <br/>
So...some of it may be give and take...you compromise, he compromises....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this and still feeling my way through it.  I feel your <br/>
frustration and anxiety.  Sometimes I say,  &quot;Well, Mommy wants to learn <br/>
about this, so we are going here.&quot;  AT least that way I&#39;m trying to show <br/>
that we are lifelong learners and you&#39;re never too old to have an <br/>
interest in something or a desire to learn more about something or try <br/>
something new.  Best of luck to you!!!<br/>
