Actually Spidey of the 70&#39;s was my fav super hero - he had troubles too, even with the powers I craved!<br/>

  &gt; I loved Wonder Woman too.  I think I was her for Halloween at least 3 times.<br/>
<br/>
  Oh good, another Wonder Woman idol worshipper!! :)<br/>
  I used to &quot;fly&quot; around my Grandmothers house with a red cape (usually a <br/>
  blanket tied on) and tall boots if I could find some. What fun!  I loved Charlie&#39;s <br/>
  Angels too...any woman that could kick some A** really appealed to me.<br/>
