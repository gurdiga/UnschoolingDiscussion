&gt; -----Closed-book Quiz (Stolen from elsewhere, but the sentiment is<br/>
&gt; true.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.  Name the five wealthiest people in the world.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.  Name the last five Heisman trophy winners.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3.  Name the last five winners of the Miss America contest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4.  Name ten people who have won the Nobel or Pulitzer prize.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5.  Name the last half dozen Academy Award winners for Best Actor and<br/>
&gt; Actress.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 6.  Name the last decade&#39;s worth of World Series Winners.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How did you do?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The point is, none of us remembers the headliners of yesterday.  These<br/>
&gt; are no<br/>
&gt; second-rate achievers.  They&#39;re the best in their fields.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But the applause dies.  Awards tarnish.  Achievements are forgotten.<br/>
&gt; Accolades and certificates are buried with their owners.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now here&#39;s another quiz.  See how you do on this one:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.  List a few teachers who aided your journey through school.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.  Name three friends who have helped you through a difficult time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3.  Name five people who have taught you something worthwhile.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4.  Think of a few people who have made you feel appreciated and<br/>
&gt; special.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5.  Think of five people you enjoy spending time with.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 6.  Name a half dozen heroes whose stories have inspired you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Easier?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The lesson?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The people who make a difference in your life aren&#39;t the ones with the<br/>
&gt; most<br/>
&gt; credentials, the most money, or the most awards.  They&#39;re the ones who<br/>
&gt; care.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you have a chance, pass this on to people who&#39;ve made a<br/>
&gt; difference in<br/>
&gt; your life.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just did. </span></blockquote></div>
