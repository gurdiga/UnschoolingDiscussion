<div id="ygrps-yiv-96770687">This article is mostly about the topic of homeschooling in general but if  <br/>
you scan through it a bit you will see an interview with pam S.  The  article is <br/>
about &quot;socialization&quot; public school Vs homeschool, so those not  wanting to <br/>
read, delete now.  LOL and those wanting to skip to pam&#39;s part I  have marked <br/>

BRYAN, TEXAS: -  Diversity<br/>
<br/>
Activities<br/>
<br/>
Steve Beck begs to differ with anyone who  believes his children are <br/>
not properly ``socialized.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
``Our  philosophy is to engage the world -- not lead a secluded life. <br/>
We want to  have an impact on the culture,&#39;&#39; said Beck, who, along <br/>
with his wife, Kerry,  home-schools their three children -- Ashley, <br/>
16, Gentry, 14, and Hunter,  11.<br/>
<br/>
As the Beacon Journal examined the state of home schooling in  <br/>
America, no issue sparked more debate or stronger emotions than  <br/>
socialization.<br/>
<br/>
The Becks epitomize the independent streak found in  many home <br/>
educators.<br/>
<br/>
Steve, who has a degree in agronomy from Texas  A&M, and Kerry, who <br/>
has a double major and a master&#39;s in educationfrom  Stephen F. Austin <br/>
State University in Texas, are entrepreneurs. They run a  home-school <br/>
curriculum and supplies company, and an online business selling  <br/>
materials to reload shotgun shells. Ashley, Gentry and Hunter pitch  <br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
Steve writes books and is a Calvinist minister. They recently  moved <br/>
from Bryan, Texas, to Moscow, Idaho, so he can attend a seminary.  <br/>
Kerry is the primary teacher for the children.<br/>
<br/>
As a family, they  travel to trade shows and conventions, mixing <br/>
business with the chance to  spend time with other home-schooling <br/>
families.<br/>
<br/>
The Becks are active  in their community. They attend church. The <br/>
parents vote. Their children  play on home-school basketball teams. <br/>
The girls love archery, and Ashley is  a three-time state champion <br/>
skeet shooter for girls her age.<br/>
<br/>
The  Becks aren&#39;t sitting at home with windows shuttered and doors <br/>
closed, lives  cut off from the rest of the world. So it bothers them <br/>
and most other home  schoolers when people ask: ``Are your children <br/>
being properly  socialized?&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
A July U.S. Department of Education report on home  schoolers found <br/>
that 31 percent kept their children home out of concern  about what <br/>
children are exposed to in public and private schools. Another 30  <br/>
percent said they wanted to control their children&#39;s understanding of  <br/>
religious or moral ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Only 16 percent named academic instruction  as a reason.<br/>
<br/>
The recent study and one in 1999 that had similar findings  make it <br/>
clear that home-schooling parents want to be the primary influence  on <br/>
their children&#39;s moral, ethical and religious views. They don&#39;t want  <br/>
their children to be socialized by educators or other children in the  <br/>
public- or private-school setting.<br/>
<br/>
Among Christian home schoolers,  this idea is often expressed as their <br/>
``worldview.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
For others,  known as unschoolers or inclusives, there is a ``me and <br/>
my children&#39;&#39;  approach that asserts that no one -- or no government <br/>
-- should interfere  with their lives. They resent negative outside <br/>
influences and want to keep  their children from being programmed by <br/>
commercial, materialistic views  present in society. They want their <br/>
children protected from the cliques,  bullies and potential violence <br/>
in schools.<br/>
<br/>
`Fortress  home&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Other researchers view the issue differently.<br/>
<br/>
Michael Apple,  a University of Wisconsin professor who opposes home <br/>
schooling, believes  most religious families want their children in a <br/>
protected environment, a  phenomenon he calls ``cocooning&#39;&#39; within <br/>
their ``fortress  home.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Home schools are ``the equivalent of gated communities in which  their <br/>
children will not be tempted by sinful ways or ways that go against  <br/>
their religious beliefs,&#39;&#39; Apple said.<br/>
<br/>
He said these families have a  worldview that they believe represents <br/>
the truth when it comes to God. They  do not recognize, nor do they <br/>
want their children exposed to, the broader  society, where <br/>
``different truths&#39;&#39; may be represented.<br/>
<br/>
``That&#39;s a  pretty dangerous position to take, to me. It&#39;s a little <br/>
disrespectful of  large numbers of equally religious people who may <br/>
believe that God spoke in  Islamic terms or spoke to Moses or spoke in <br/>
multiple Christian voices that  are not recognized as being really <br/>
Christian by many home schoolers,&#39;&#39; Apple  said. The words ``freedom&#39;&#39; <br/>
and ``liberty&#39;&#39; ring hollow considering the  intolerance among home <br/>
schoolers for other ideas, he said.<br/>
<br/>
``You  can&#39;t say at the same time, `Let a thousand flowers bloom&#39; and <br/>
`All voices  be heard&#39; and then say, `Yeah, but ours is the only right <br/>
voice,&#39; which  means that the ultimate goal for my freedom is to deny <br/>
you the freedom. In a  nice way, I will convert you, I will smile and <br/>
give you the only truth,&#39;&#39;  Apple said.<br/>
<br/>
Suspicion, distrust<br/>
<br/>
Home-schooling parents represent  about 2 percent of the school-age <br/>
children in America.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that  home-schooling parents believe their approach is the <br/>
best way to educate  children chafes others who continue to enroll <br/>
their children in traditional  settings.<br/>
<br/>
There are feelings of suspicion and distrust on both  sides.<br/>
<br/>
``I get people asking me,`Aren&#39;t you worried your kids aren&#39;t  going <br/>
to socialize?&#39; &#39;&#39; a home-schooling mother told a Beacon Journal focus  <br/>
group in which participants were granted anonymity.<br/>
<br/>
``My kids  socialized more after I pulled them out of school than they <br/>
did when they  were in school,&#39;&#39; she said. ``I wish that the public <br/>
understood we aren&#39;t  all sitting at home around the kitchen table all <br/>
day long.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
A  children&#39;s services worker said parents are isolating their <br/>
children. ``I  really think it&#39;s emotional abuse when you don&#39;t allow <br/>
your children to  interact with other children, other people,&#39;&#39; she <br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
Many non-home  schoolers share the belief that home-schooled children <br/>
are too confined to  their own worlds and that socialization comes <br/>
from learning to get along in  different settings with people from <br/>
different backgrounds.<br/>
<br/>
``They  don&#39;t want diversity. That is why they home-school,&#39;&#39; a focus <br/>
group member  said. ``They want (the children) to be with people who <br/>
have the same value  system.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Teamwork with Legos<br/>
<br/>
Home-schooling parents contend that  their children are active in <br/>
their communities, and move easily and  comfortably among children and <br/>
adults of all ages.<br/>
<br/>
Their flexible  schedules provide opportunities to pick among <br/>
community and political  events. They organize field trips and meet in <br/>
groups to learn and  play.<br/>
<br/>
Home schoolers are active in 4-H, dance, theater, music and choir,  <br/>
and scouting. Young girls join Keepers of the Home. Home schoolers  <br/>
increasingly form sports leagues or enter competitions that bring <br/>
them  into contact with public- and private-school children.<br/>
<br/>
When Keyan  Paglialunga, 15, read about a Lego robot competition, he <br/>
and Anna Friddle,  15, both of Canton, started recruiting teammates <br/>
among children they knew  from their Creative Learning in My Backyard <br/>
(CLIMB) home-schooling  group.<br/>
<br/>
It was an intriguing challenge: build a functioning robot using  <br/>
microprocessors and Lego blocks, and compete against the designs of  <br/>
other home-schooled, private- and public-school students  statewide.<br/>
<br/>
Every Monday for six weeks, they met for half a day at the  NASA Glenn <br/>
Research Center near Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.  Keyan&#39;s <br/>
mom, Bonnie, their coach, helped them research the project and  <br/>
program the robot.<br/>
<br/>
At a Stark County church in February, as the  demonstration began, it <br/>
was clear the children worked well together. With  only two team <br/>
members at the competition table at one time, they politely  took <br/>
turns running ``Bob the Bot.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Their entry won the regional  competition, allowing the nine-member <br/>
team to go the state championship at  Wright-Patterson Air Force Base <br/>
outside Dayton, where they finished  third.<br/>
<br/>
``I think it was an opportunity of a lifetime,&#39;&#39; said Kevin  Knabel, a <br/>
13-year-old home-schooled student from Green.<br/>
<br/>
Ohio  gathering<br/>
<br/>
Home schoolers also socialize with other home  schoolers.<br/>
<br/>
On a warm June afternoon in Columbus, hundreds of Christian  Home <br/>
Educators of Ohio members, other parents and their children browsed  <br/>
through the large convention hall at Franklin County Veterans <br/>
Memorial  auditorium.<br/>
<br/>
CHEO is a statewide group, but Ohio has scores of local  home-school <br/>
support organizations whose members meet regularly to share  ideas and <br/>
lesson plans, receive legal advice, teach needed classes, find  <br/>
academic assessors or provide guidance for families.<br/>
<br/>
More than 300  vendors in the convention hall displayed their wares, <br/>
ranging from starter  kits to information on numerous Christian <br/>
colleges.<br/>
<br/>
Thousands of  books were stacked, shelved, mounted on stands or <br/>
hanging from racks. They  encompassed a range of subjects from math to <br/>
spelling to hagiographic  biographies.<br/>
<br/>
The conference ended with a high school graduation  commencement <br/>
ceremony.<br/>
<br/>
Before 69 students and their parents walked  across the stage, the <br/>
crowd stood, placed their right hands over their  hearts, and recited: <br/>
``I pledge allegiance to the Christian Flag and to the  Saviour, for <br/>
whose Kingdom it stands, One Savior, crucified, risen and  coming <br/>
again, with life and liberty for all who believe.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Youth  sports group<br/>
<br/>
In Texas, when Tom Sanders walks into the Kinkaid School, a  private <br/>
school in an upscale suburb of Houston, the lanky basketball coach  <br/>
and father of six home-schooled children is greeted with affection.  <br/>
Young people grab his arm and smile. Men throw their arms around him <br/>
and  embrace with a comfortable hug.<br/>
<br/>
Sanders, a lawyer and registered Texas  lobbyist for the Home School <br/>
Legal Defense Association, formed theHomeschool  Christian Youth <br/>
Association for his children and several hundred others who  wanted a <br/>
chance to play basketball, baseball, softball and volleyball and to  <br/>
develop their Christian character.<br/>
<br/>
``It became very personal for me  because I had a son who fit that <br/>
category,&#39;&#39; Sanders said.<br/>
<br/>
He coaches  the varsity boys basketball team that has been invited to <br/>
open tournaments  in Texas and has traveled to Oklahoma to play. He <br/>
said the team is  equivalent to a small public or private school for <br/>
classification purposes,  and was one of the better squads in Texas <br/>
last season.<br/>
<br/>
``One huge  reason is the character of these young men. They&#39;re not <br/>
perfect, but they&#39;re  very teachable, very attentive, very willing to <br/>
learn, very willing to apply  themselves to do what we ask,&#39;&#39; Sanders <br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
He said home schooling  and parents&#39; rights take precedence over the <br/>
team.<br/>
<br/>
``I had a practice  last night. One of my best players didn&#39;t come <br/>
because Mom and Dad had  family plans. What am I going to do? Yell at <br/>
them to disobey Mom? Disobey  Dad?&#39;&#39; Sanders said.<br/>
<br/>
Religious motivations<br/>
<br/>
Steve and Kerry Beck  acknowledge that it is what many evangelicals <br/>
call their ``Christian  worldview&#39;&#39; that drives them. The phrase means <br/>
that all aspects of the  universe owe their existence to a Christian <br/>
God.<br/>
<br/>
They said they  pulled their children from private religious schools <br/>
because teachers were  stressing academics rather than building a <br/>
religious foundation.<br/>
<br/>
``We  really want our kids to rule and reign for Christ. We couldn&#39;t <br/>
do that on a  haphazard basis,&#39;&#39; said Steve Beck. ``The whole idea is <br/>
we&#39;re training  battle-hardened soldiers for Christ. The private <br/>
Christian school wasn&#39;t  going to do that.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
The Becks wanted a sense of togetherness in their  church, so they <br/>
joined the small, rural Confederation of Reformed  Evangelicals that <br/>
was active in the community.<br/>
<br/>
``I saw it as a very  good way to disciple men,&#39;&#39; Steve Beck said.<br/>
<br/>
The influence has been  profound. The family moved to Idaho in August <br/>
so that Steve can study at a  seminary run by Douglas Wilson, an <br/>
outspoken critic of big government and  especially public education.<br/>
<br/>
Wilson co-authored a book that argues that  Civil War abolitionists <br/>
ignored the teachings of the Bible, which recognizes  slavery.<br/>
<br/>
Beck said Wilson&#39;s ``main goal is to get people to think.&#39;&#39; The  Bible <br/>
urges good relationships between slaves and masters, and that&#39;s what  <br/>
prevailed in the prewar South, Beck said.<br/>
<br/>
The South was fighting for  states&#39; rights, not for slavery, Beck <br/>
said. Because the South lost, we now  have the ``leviathan&#39;&#39; <br/>
government intruding on all aspects of our  lives.<br/>
<br/>
Public schools are an example, he said. Before public education  was <br/>
created in the 1800s, anyone who wanted an education could find one  <br/>
for free, and the literacy rate was much higher than it is today, he  <br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
Beck said that people coming out of Wilson&#39;s school are  ``changing <br/>
the culture from the inside out,&#39;&#39; and that Christians need to  <br/>
infiltrate the world.<br/>
<br/>
``We&#39;re in the New Covenant. We&#39;re not using  swords. We&#39;re using the <br/>
Spirit,&#39;&#39; Beck said.<br/>
<br/>
In his book, A Father&#39;s  Stew, Beck writes that Christians must reject <br/>
the notions that women need  work to be fulfilled, parents should <br/>
pursue careers by dumping their  children in day-care centers <br/>
(disparagingly referred to as ``concentration  camps&#39;&#39;) and education <br/>
can be provided only by so-called experts.<br/>
<br/>
The  Becks want their children to go to college, but they have <br/>
different  aspirations for the three, depending on the gender.<br/>
<br/>
Steve Beck would like  his son to become an engineer and wants the <br/>
girls to get liberal arts  degrees so they are able to ``have sons and <br/>
daughters and teach them to  think.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
``I&#39;m not keen on a daughter becoming a doctor and working 90  hours a <br/>
week,&#39;&#39; he said.<br/>
<br/>
Jorge Gomez, president of the North Texas  Home Educators Network in <br/>
the Dallas-Fort Worth area, has a worldview  similar to the Becks&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Gomez, who came to the United States from Mexico  when he was 7, <br/>
prefers the Anglicized pronunciation ``George&#39;&#39; for Jorge. He  <br/>
discourages discussion of his Hispanic heritage and of diversity <br/>
among  home schoolers because ``we are all one. Home schooling is the <br/>
great  equalizer.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Gomez, a businessman, and his wife, have three children and  are <br/>
evangelical Christians. He chooses to ``home-church&#39;&#39; by not  <br/>
participating in an organized congregation.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s troubled by pop  culture and what children learn in organized <br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>
``We have the  freedom to choose. In a school, you don&#39;t know what <br/>
books they&#39;re being  shown. There are more quotes from Marilyn Monroe <br/>
than from FDR or about  World War II. They don&#39;t need pop culture or <br/>
revisionist history,&#39;&#39; Gomez  said.<br/>
<br/>
Image problem<br/>
<br/>
The strong religious views that the Becks,  Gomez and others hold can <br/>
stir anti-home schooling feelings in the larger  community. In <br/>
interviews and focus groups, many non-home schoolers pointed  to a <br/>
``holier than thou&#39;&#39; attitude that they said permeates many families  <br/>
in the movement.<br/>
<br/>
A public-school parent said in a Beacon Journal  focus group that a <br/>
relative is a fundamentalist Christian who  home-schools.<br/>
<br/>
``There is just this arrogance. We all laugh and say, `What  is she <br/>
going to do when she gets to heaven and we are standing there  <br/>
greeting her?&#39; She is going to have a fit when she gets up there, and  <br/>
there we are,&#39;&#39; the parent said.<br/>
<br/>
Some home schoolers are aware of  this image problem.<br/>
<br/>
``Sometimes I think, coming from a home-schooled  mentality, we have <br/>
to be very careful that we are not teaching our children  that home <br/>
schoolers are better than other people,&#39;&#39; a Christian mother  said.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers and inclusives in the movement unite with their  Christian <br/>
counterparts on most home-school issues, but they often resent  <br/>
efforts to impose biblical, faith-based ideas about such topics as  <br/>
abortion, same-sex marriage and stem-cell research on them and the <br/>
rest  of society.<br/>
<br/>
In a focus group, an unschooler mother said Christian home  schoolers <br/>
are rigid in their beliefs -- ``Everybody else is  wrong.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Although religious home schoolers garner the most attention, the  <br/>
movement is vast and diverse.<br/>
<br/>
*********More diverse<br/>
<br/>
Pam  Sorooshian, an econometrician from Long Beach, Calif., describes <br/>
herself as  a non-Christian, politically independent person in a <br/>
multicultural marriage.  She believes home schoolers are unfairly <br/>
targeted for criticism because they  are so closely identified with <br/>
the religious right.<br/>
<br/>
Sorooshian is  co-founder of the National Home Educators Network, a <br/>
group known as  ``inclusives&#39;&#39; because members represent a network of <br/>
various religions,  races, ethnicities and family structures. The <br/>
group includes bisexuals,  pagans, atheists, Mormons, Catholics, <br/>
Baptists, Jews, Muslims, blacks,  Latinos, Asians and Middle Eastern <br/>
families, she said.<br/>
<br/>
``We have  mixed families, gay couples with children, single mothers, <br/>
working mothers.  We have stay-at-home dads. We have a far better <br/>
cross section of the  community than the elementary school that we <br/>
pulled my 9-year-old out of,  which was all-white, had no other races <br/>
of any kind, and every kid there  came from an upper-middle-class <br/>
neighborhood surrounding the school,&#39;&#39;  Sorooshian said in a <br/>
presentation at the annual American Educational  Research Association <br/>
meeting in San Diego this year.<br/>
<br/>
``Inclusive&#39;&#39; is  a term referring to a group open to anyone, <br/>
including Christians, Sorooshian  told the Beacon Journal.<br/>
<br/>
``There is a huge difference between the typical  Christian home <br/>
schooler and the typical inclusive home schoolers,&#39;&#39;  Sorooshian said. <br/>
``Inclusives have an underlying desire to have their kids  out in the <br/>
world and more exposed to the world. Christian home schoolers are  <br/>
just trying to protect their children.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
She said the idea that  inclusive children from home-schooling <br/>
families are growing up intolerant  and uncivil is ludicrous.<br/>
<br/>
She said she started home schooling because her  children&#39;s public <br/>
school was not diverse enough.<br/>
<br/>
Now, her children  are exposed to a wide variety of people of <br/>
different backgrounds, ages,  religions and cultures.<br/>
<br/>
``In our case, we wanted far more real  relationships than what our <br/>
kids were getting in school,&#39;&#39; Sorooshian  said.<br/>
<br/>
Backer wants oversight<br/>
<br/>
Rob Reich, a Stanford University  professor who maintains that he <br/>
supports home schooling, believes that many  parents wield too much <br/>
control over their children and don&#39;t want them  exposed to contrary <br/>
ideas.<br/>
<br/>
He contends that children need to learn to  participate in a diverse <br/>
democracy.<br/>
<br/>
``In no other setting are parents  as able to direct in all aspects <br/>
the education of their children, for in  home schools they are <br/>
responsible not only for determining what their  children shall learn, <br/>
but when, how and with whom they shall learn,&#39;&#39; Reich  said in a <br/>
published essay, Testing the Boundaries of Parental Authority Over  <br/>
Education: The Case of Homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Many home-schooling parents see  Reich as an opponent because he wants <br/>
government to play a larger oversight  role.<br/>
<br/>
He said that while home-schooling parents insist they must have the  <br/>
freedom to raise their children, they often are intolerant of anyone  <br/>
with different views.<br/>
<br/>
``Children can grow up to become ethically  servile to their parents, <br/>
which is incompatible with them being free  persons,&#39;&#39; Reich saidin a <br/>
Beacon Journal interview.<br/>
<br/>
In his speeches  and writings, Reich talks about two concepts of <br/>
society: one in which  citizens vote their own interests and the <br/>
majority rules; and one in which  citizens are involved, talk to each <br/>
other and exchange ideas in the public  forum before taking a majority <br/>
vote.<br/>
<br/>
He believes that home-schooling  parents are preventing their children <br/>
from being part of the public forum,  and that the children are being <br/>
raised in isolation. If they&#39;re not part of  that forum, they may not <br/>
know that other views on life exist.<br/>
<br/>
``I  think that is a potentially disabling aspect of home schooling,&#39;&#39; <br/>
Reich told  the Beacon Journal.<br/>
<br/>
The state cannot mandate that children from diverse  backgrounds come <br/>
together, but Reich said government can and should insist  upon <br/>
curricula that expose children to different religions, cultures and  <br/>
points of view.<br/>
<br/>
``Not all home schoolers are going to like this, but  this will be <br/>
part of the aim of regulation -- to ensure that even within a  <br/>
home-school environment, children are introduced to and exposed to <br/>
the  world of diversity in a liberal democracy,&#39;&#39; Reich said at the <br/>
same  discussion of education research that Sorooshian attended.<br/>
<br/>
Sorooshian,  the inclusive, countered that home schoolers are <br/>
perplexed when they hear  that kind of idea.<br/>
<br/>
``Do we know if we can teach good citizenship?&#39;&#39; she  asked. ``Do we <br/>
know anything about how to teach it? How can they regulate us  to make <br/>
sure we taught our children good citizenship? Require them to go to  <br/>
Girl Scouts?&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Extracurriculars<br/>
<br/>
Reich believes public schools  should be required to let home-schooled <br/>
children play on sports teams and in  bands, and sign up for other <br/>
extracurricular activities.<br/>
<br/>
``It&#39;s the  wrong stance to take from a public point of view to forbid <br/>
home-school  children from participating in public school <br/>
activities,&#39;&#39; Reich told the  Beacon Journal. ``It ought to be done <br/>
precisely because it gives the  home-school kids an opportunity to <br/>
interact with more people than they would  otherwise in a way that <br/>
might have civic benefits.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
As the movement  has grown, more home-schooled children are having <br/>
contact with public  schools.<br/>
<br/>
The 2001 U.S. Department of Education study, released in July of  this <br/>
year, found that about 20 percent of the estimated 1.1 million  <br/>
home-schooled students were enrolled part time in public  schools.<br/>
<br/>
Many states give local school officials the authority to accept  or <br/>
reject home-school students on a part-time basis. In return, some  <br/>
districts that accept part-timers receive funding based on how many  <br/>
classes a home-schooling student takes.<br/>
<br/>
Hugh Caumartin,  superintendent of Bowling Green schools in northwest <br/>
Ohio, said he has seen  an increase in home schoolers interacting with <br/>
his district.<br/>
<br/>
``We do  have home-schooled students taking classes in our schools. <br/>
Typically, they  take music, art, science with labs, sports,&#39;&#39; <br/>
Caumartin said.<br/>
<br/>
These  interactions have not come without friction. Home schoolers are <br/>
accused of  cherry-picking public services.<br/>
<br/>
Home schoolers counter that they pay  taxes and should be allowed to <br/>
take classes.<br/>
<br/>
Finances,  fairness<br/>
<br/>
Most states defer to local school districts, giving  superintendents <br/>
and boards the authority to devise policies on accepting  home <br/>
schoolers for classes or extracurricular activities.<br/>
<br/>
Some public  school officials refuse to provide services to <br/>
home-schooled students,  citing finances and fairness as reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Many school officials believe  extracurricular activities are rewards <br/>
or bonuses used as incentives for  academic achievement. Public school <br/>
students must meet certain academic  standards -- such as passing <br/>
tests or achieving minimum grade-point averages  -- before being <br/>
allowed to play on a sports team or take part in  extracurricular <br/>
activities. Home-schooled students are not held to the same  standards.<br/>
<br/>
In Easton, Pa., home schoolers and the school board clashed  over <br/>
allowing children to play football. In Texas, legislation has been  <br/>
introduced to give home schoolers access to sports and debate teams. <br/>
In  West Virginia, a judge ruled a family could place their son on a <br/>
wrestling  team. In Dayton, Christian schools have accepted home <br/>
schoolers into their  classes and included them in extracurricular <br/>
activities.<br/>
<br/>
Although  home schoolers and their attorneys have been consistently <br/>
victorious in  legal battles, this is one area where courts have <br/>
decided in favor of public  schools more often than not.<br/>
<br/>
``I wish that the schools would be more  accepting of kids joining in <br/>
sports and the extracurricular activities like  band,&#39;&#39; an unschooler <br/>
mom in a Beacon Journal focus group said. ``I think  the one thing we <br/>
would want to go to high school for is the extracurricular  <br/>
activities.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
She offered a solution that would not be popular with  most public <br/>
school parents.<br/>
<br/>
``I would ultimately like to see the  extracurricular stuff taken <br/>
completely out of the schools and made  free-standing, like Barberton <br/>
Little League is not a school-related  organization. It&#39;s a separate <br/>
thing, and the kids go play baseball  together,&#39;&#39; she said.<br/>

---------------------<br/>
<br/>
I agree with him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Children can grow up to become ethically  servile to their parents,<br/>
which is incompatible with them being free  persons,&#39;&#39; Reich saidin a<br/>
Beacon Journal interview-=-<br/>
<br/>
But he&#39;s not talking about us.  He&#39;s talking about the fundamentalist <br/>
Christian Homeschoolers who won&#39;t even let their kids play with other Christians <br/>
unless they are thoroughly screened by the parents as to belief and practice.  <br/>
Minutia, dogmatically speaking.<br/>
<br/>
There are many homeschoolers (maybe the majority) who have their children out <br/>
of school because they don&#39;t want them exposed to ideas about &quot;accepting <br/>
other people&quot; or about evolution, or about other religions as valid.  They want to <br/>
indoctrinate their children into a false-front vision of the world with a <br/>
reconstructed fantasy history and an allegedly scientific science, and keep them <br/>
from looking behind that facade.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone here who doubts that should order some back issues of Home School <br/>
Digest or The Old Schoolhouse.   They WANT their children separate, they WANT them <br/>
to think that everything outside their protected little world is the imminent <br/>
destruction by and of Satan and that the children&#39;s only salvation is <br/>
isolation.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, there are unschoolers (and other homeschoolers) who want their <br/>
children &quot;exposed&quot; to much MORE than schools do, who want their children to know <br/>
about other cultures, to be accepting of other lifestyles.   We who live in <br/>
that expansive nest shouldn&#39;t deny (or live unawares of) the very real <br/>
isolationist, controlling people who are too often the voice of homeschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-476646429">I read an academic paper by this fellow back when I was researching homeschooling. I found it in the University library database from some journal. What makes me angry is that he has a PhD in Social Science, and a lot of his conclusions show a lack of true understanding of the nature of homeschooling. Because he is this PhD sociologist people use him as an &quot;expert&quot; - when he has no personal knowledge of homeschooling! <br/>
<br/>
In this paper he writes ( I am badly paraphrasing) that the parent isn&#39;t the only person who has an interest in the education of the child. The parent. The child  - hence the free person, separation from parents at an early age, and the state does. This is the important part. The state is interested in the education of its citizens so they can all get nice paying jobs and stay off welfare, etc.... Ok, but then why do you decide that the state&#39;s interest is the more important of the three. This is what public school does. The child doesn&#39;t have personal freedom, is not taking part in a diverse democracy. Overall, his ideas sound very socialist to me. <br/>
<br/>
How is it that he feels a public school will allow a child to be exposed to contrary ideas - or participate in a diverse democracy? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll bet any homeschooling parent could explain how homeschooling provides both of these things! We don&#39;t live under a rock! There are so many resources out there in society, to provide a wealth of experiences. To me sitting in a classroom for hours on end, limits these experiences. <br/>
<br/>
 I am not far from a PhD in Finance. That doesn&#39;t mean I know everything - or that if I write an academic paper that I am now an expert. I know how to write a mean, convincing paper. Too much emphasis is placed on the degree as a sign of wisdom. If he had actually homeschooled and came to these conclusions, then maybe I could understand his viewpoint . Has he read anything such as Tamara Orr&#39;s book, or David Albert, or Sandra Dodd&#39;s website? What is he possibly researching to come to these conclusions? Maybe other news articles on homeschooling??<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - homeschooling can create a free thinking group of constituents. Does the country really want this? How can anyone truly look at the current academic system and think it is working just great? <br/>

Maybe where I live makes up for where you live.  Here there are more  than <br/>
enough homeschoolers keeping their children out of school so they can  protect <br/>
them from the evils of the world, the evils of their community, the  thought of <br/>
evolution, and my children, like they are some sort of  disease.<br/>
 <br/>
And from what I have seen in my state they do not crumble at all.   On a <br/>
local homeschooling list the discussion of &quot;faith and the Bible&quot; came  up.  And <br/>
actually has been going on and on for weeks now.  There are  those that believe <br/>
every word in the Bible as fact.  There are those saying  that Bible verses <br/>
are up for interpretation etc, but they are few and are far  out weighed by the <br/>
Fundamentalist Christian views.  <br/>
 <br/>
Those people believe that it is their job to make &quot;us&quot; understand that the  <br/>
Bible is fact and saying that we do not believe in the same thing is not good  <br/>
enough.  Because it is &quot;truth&quot;, how can anyone not believe in the truth or  <br/>
facts.  Their statements include things like &quot;just because you don&#39;t  believe in <br/>
it does not make it any less the truth, you can deny the truth all  you want <br/>
but it is still there and still the truth.&quot;  They see their job is  to save <br/>
our souls, no matter how much we do not want to be saved.  I am  speaking like I <br/>
am not a Christian, but I am, I am just not seen as a Christian  by the <br/>
Fundamentalists because I do not take the Bible as fact.  So they  feel I need <br/>
saving as well.<br/>
 <br/>
And all this extends to our children.  They do not want their children  <br/>
playing with our children, we are not Christian enough.  I hear them  talking about <br/>
what not to see if you do go to Disney.  What exhibits not to  look at.  What <br/>
museums not to let your children visit because they talk  about the evolution <br/>
of the world and contain different fossils etc.  <br/>
 <br/>
They do not crumble under criticism or scrutiny.  It is their job to  be <br/>
strong.<br/>
 <br/>
OK enough from me this morning.  LOL. <br/>

  are up for interpretation etc, but they are few and are far  out weighed by the <br/>
  Fundamentalist Christian views.  <br/>
<br/>
  Those people believe that it is their job to make &quot;us&quot; understand that the  <br/>
  Bible is fact and saying that we do not believe in the same thing is not good  <br/>
  enough.  Because it is &quot;truth&quot;, how can anyone not believe in the truth or  <br/>
  facts.  Their statements include things like &quot;just because you don&#39;t  believe in <br/>
  it does not make it any less the truth, you can deny the truth all  you want <br/>
  but it is still there and still the truth.&quot;  They see their job is  to save <br/>
  our souls, no matter how much we do not want to be saved.  I am  speaking like I <br/>
  am not a Christian, but I am, I am just not seen as a Christian  by the <br/>
  Fundamentalists because I do not take the Bible as fact.  So they  feel I need <br/>
  saving as well.<br/>
<br/>
  And all this extends to our children.  They do not want their children  <br/>
  playing with our children, we are not Christian enough.  I hear them  talking about <br/>
  what not to see if you do go to Disney.  What exhibits not to  look at.  What <br/>
  museums not to let your children visit because they talk  about the evolution <br/>
  of the world and contain different fossils etc.  <br/>
<br/>
  They do not crumble under criticism or scrutiny.  It is their job to  be <br/>
  strong.<br/>
<br/>
  OK enough from me this morning.  LOL. <br/>

I went to the Field Museum in Chicago with a homeschool mom and her two kids. <br/>
 <br/>
As we were starting off on a little guided tour bit (which we ditched out of <br/>
partway through), the docent said &quot;Every homeschooler we get here is *very <br/>
smart*&quot; or some such kind of complimentary but mostly condescending thing.  I <br/>
leaned over to the mom and said, &quot;Because Christian homeschoolers won&#39;t come <br/>
here.&quot;   It features prehistory and evolution pretty prominently.   But maybe the <br/>
Christian homeschooling groups just avoid the tour so the mom in charge can <br/>
explain that dinosaur bones were created by God to test the faith of his people. <br/>
 Would they believe their eyes and their theories over the word of God?   <br/>
Correct answer:  &quot;no&quot;   If the Bible says one thing and overwhelming physical <br/>
evidence says another, go with the Bible.<br/>
<br/>
Is that really a way to teach kids to learn by experience?  No. Experience is <br/>
very bad.  Bible very good.<br/>
<br/>
Am I anti-Christian?  I&#39;m anti-ignorance, and when they come together I&#39;m <br/>
against the ignorance.  Hate the sin of ignorance, give the sinner the benefit of <br/>
the doubt.<br/>

&gt; But he&#39;s not talking about us.  He&#39;s talking about the fundamentalist<br/>
&gt; Christian Homeschoolers who won&#39;t even let their kids play with other <br/>
&gt; Christians<br/>

&gt; Minutia, dogmatically speaking.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right. But his solution is to require curriculum, standardized testing, <br/>
and registration of all homeschoolers. None of those three things would <br/>
make a whit of difference to the uber-Christian homeschoolers, but <br/>
they&#39;d sure mess with unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
AND - interestingly, even though WE know it is the uber-Christians who <br/>
fit his description of raising &quot;ethically servile&quot; people, it is the <br/>
unschoolers who don&#39;t use curriculum and don&#39;t test, which is what he <br/>
wants to require.<br/>
<br/>
He wants to impose his regulations even on those of us who are raising <br/>
kids who are far from servile. And, his regulations won&#39;t do anything <br/>
to make uber-Christian parents expose their children to other belief <br/>
systems.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not ignorant of unschooling or that there are thousands of <br/>
inclusive homeschoolers out there - we&#39;ve had MANY conversations and he <br/>
frequents various inclusive homeschooling forums - he just doesn&#39;t care <br/>
if he makes unschooling impossible and he&#39;s willing to use us to get at <br/>
the Christian Right homeschoolers because he doesn&#39;t approve of the way <br/>
they raise their kids. Well, gee, neither do I. But I&#39;m not willing to <br/>
sacrifice our lifestyle under the pretense that it would have any <br/>
impact on theirs at all. And that&#39;s what he&#39;s wanting.<br/>

to be tolerant of diverse views and able to engage in deep societal <br/>
discussion so that they can be good citizens in a democracy that <br/>
requires them to think about issues, for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Good stuff. Would be nice if SCHOOLS were doing it.<br/>
<br/>
Rob makes a HUGE point that he isn&#39;t comparing homeschooling to schools <br/>
- that homeschools may very well be doing a better job of this than <br/>
schools are - but that his interest is in homeschooling, not in school <br/>
reform.  He absolutely refuses to engage in a conversation in which it <br/>
is pointed out that kids learn more racial and ethnic intolerance IN <br/>
school than anywhere else.<br/>
