<div id="ygrps-yiv-950268535">Well, this is one celebration we had previously overlooked.  Although, I do <br/>
vaguely remember making mention on Landons 12th birthday that he was 12 on <br/>
the 12th.  Anna&#39;s is on the 23rd.. Ethans on the 18th ( He COULD celebrate <br/>
like Shryley, but he would have to be born on the 21st!)  And JP&#39;s is on the <br/>
27th.. They will all be grown by the time thier star birthday comes around.. <br/>
But it can still be fun<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086796578">Rebekah just had her 5th b-day on Dec.5.  We had a party, but nothing <br/>
special.  We mentioned that it was an extra- special birthday.  My other <br/>
kids will have theirs on the 8th, 11th and 2 on the 18th (not twins) of <br/>
their birth months.<br/>
