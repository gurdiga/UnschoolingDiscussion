<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684265419">Maybe along the lines of finding good in everything, or of &quot;say something <br/>
good for each bad thing you say about someone&quot; (or those sorts of themes), <br/>
you could have photos of traditionally bad or scary things and find something <br/>
good to say <br/>
<br/>
rattlesnakes have pretty markings<br/>
Hitler had a nice moustache<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know.  It would be inexpensive, though.   And it would make them <br/>
think of things in a new way. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you had more than one set of the photos you could have competitions <br/>
for the BEST good thing, or for the exclusive or creative good thing.<br/>
