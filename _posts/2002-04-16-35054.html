<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921946265">**I don&#39;t think ps would make a difference to either one as to being outgoing <br/>
or being less a social butterfly.  Actually, I think that ps might have the <br/>
opposite effect and<br/>
could turn a quiet, homebody into a total introvert.**<br/>
<br/>
I think schools make a BIG difference in how kids feel about themselves as <br/>
social beings, and in how their natural bent on the introvert/extrovert <br/>
spectrum gets expressed. Social butterflys can become clique leader <br/>
terrorists. The shy and quiet withdraw permanently.<br/>
<br/>
I think what passes for socialization in schools damages everyone, the <br/>
unpopular and the popular alike. What passes for interaction between boys and <br/>
girls in junior high schools damages both sexes. Many never get over it.<br/>
<br/>
Human beings truly aren&#39;t meant to be raised in packs, but that&#39;s what <br/>
happens when we send them to schools. They spend a large part of each day <br/>
surrounded by others who are just as unskilled at civilzation as they are, <br/>
told to &quot;work things out&quot; by outnumbered adults without being given the <br/>
skills and guidance necessary to do so.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a newish middle school in a nearby town that holds 2100 students in <br/>
6th - 8th grades. That&#39;s just about the scariest thing I can think of <br/>
(outside of wars and other disasters) - that many hormonally challenged <br/>
people all bouncing off of each other every day all day. Poor kids.<br/>
