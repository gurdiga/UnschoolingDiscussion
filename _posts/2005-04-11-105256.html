<div id="ygrps-yiv-513452592">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Bob and my wife and I are considering keeping our<br/>
daughter home in September instead of sending her off to<br/>
Kindergarten. Since I am employed full-time, my wife feels that most<br/>
of the pressure will be on her. Right now she&#39;s a bit ambivalent to<br/>
the whole idea. Some days, she&#39;s on board and even talking to some<br/>
of the other preschool mom&#39;s about why it makes sense, while other<br/>
days she attempts to convince me that we should send her to<br/>
Kindergarten and wait until first grade to try homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I keep trying to tell her that there really isn&#39;t any &quot;pressure&quot; on<br/>
her at all. I&#39;m advocating an unschooling approach especially since<br/>
it&#39;s Kindergarten and she&#39;d only be missing story time, singing and<br/>
crafts, which we&#39;ve been doing at home all along anyway, and will<br/>
continue to do.<br/>
<br/>
She has decided that she would prefer a more structured approach,<br/>
yet she also claims to be feeling overwhelmed at the thought of<br/>
homeschooling. I countered that the feeling of being overwhelmed is<br/>
likely at least in part due to her considering this structured<br/>
approach and all that it will entail day to day. I said that she<br/>
could just allow our daughter to live and enjoy the day-to-day with<br/>
her mommy and her baby brother... that she will learn all sorts of<br/>
valuable insights from the every day experiences of living.<br/>
<br/>
But I think she thinks that unschoolers are running from museums, to<br/>
farms, and from nature preserves to senior homes, etc. I told her<br/>
that while I think that these things are done, they certainly aren&#39;t<br/>
done every day and perhaps not even once a week, and that our<br/>
daughter will learn while shopping with Mommy; by talking with the<br/>
both of us; by playing with her little brother; by playing by<br/>
herself; exploring our back yard; looking at books; etc.<br/>
<br/>
Again, my wife isn&#39;t against the idea, but I think she is very<br/>
overwhelmed imagining all sorts of requirements on her that I keep<br/>
asserting won&#39;t really be there at all.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m requesting a pep talk so to speak from as many of you who are<br/>
on the front line as are willing to respond. Especially from those<br/>
of you who are working with younger children and are using an<br/>
unstructured or at the very least less structured approach. While I<br/>
certainly have nothing against the structured approach, the<br/>
suggestion that we teach my daughter Latin may well be enough to<br/>
ensure that she ends up enrolled in Kindergarten this Fall, and I<br/>
certainly don&#39;t want that to happen. Thanks in advance for any<br/>
comments and encouragement that are offered.<br/>
<br/>
Warm regards,<br/>
<br/>
Bob</div>

I started out homeschooling when my first child was 5.  I figured that kindergarten was the PERFECT time to give it a try, because even if I decided it didn&#39;t work out she would not have missed much.  I guarantee your child will not be behind the kids who did go to kindergarten - despite the popular view that kindergarten is so critical for getting kids ready for school.<br/>
<br/>
Another benefit to keeping her home instead of kindergarten is that she won&#39;t learn any of those negative school lessons or become dependent on someone else to tell her what she should learn.<br/>
<br/>
I was involved with a local homeschool support group that first year.  That may have been more important for me than for my children though.  The group was active with fun stuff - regular park days where we just hung out, played, and talked, and meeting at one another&#39;s houses for the kids to play.  We had a field trip about once every 3 months.  Not that field trips are needed, just to back up your saying that field trips don&#39;t have to happen every week.  The best field trips were the ones with really small groups anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I also had a toddler that first year.  I had ideas for *teaching* my older dd, but in the end we were so busy playing, visiting with friends, and regular household stuff that we rarely ever found time to have any actual lessons.  I did present some phonics, but it was clear that dd wasn&#39;t getting it, so I put it aside and then she started reading anyway, at which point the phonics didn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
In my early years of homeschooling I focused on learning through playing games and other daily activities.  As we went along, I learned more about unschooling and that is where we are now.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy, it&#39;s fun, and your kids will thrive.<br/>
<br/>
If your wife wants &quot;structure&quot;, she can make plans to schedule time in her day to play games with your dd, read to her, go fun places like children&#39;s museums & the park, make playdough together, etcetera.  But really, some of my kids best learning has been when we were busy focusing on something else, not those times when I was trying to teach them!<br/>

<br/>
Everything you said was really encouraging. My daughter has two years of half-day pre-<br/>
school. She&#39;s already had Kindergarten as far as I&#39;m concerned.  I just want to see what <br/>
happens if we take her away from the peer social scene. I especially liked your suggestion <br/>
about &quot;structure&quot; at the end. Thanks so much.<br/>

<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
When we started, we knew very few homeschoolers.  But we lived in a  <br/>
neighborhood where the kids already knew other kids.  It wasn&#39;t much of an  issue.  <br/>
Online was the ONLY support I had and it CAN be done.  Here I  am, 10 years <br/>
later.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
I was thinking of another reason your wife may be resisting.  Maybe  she&#39;s <br/>
not resisting homeschooling at all, but the idea that you&#39;re so adamant  about <br/>
it.  Maybe it makes her feel &quot;kept&quot; in some inarticulate way.  I  don&#39;t want to <br/>
use the word &quot;trapped&quot;, but maybe she was looking forward to time  to breathe <br/>
while your daughter is at school.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s completely okay to feel that way!  I need alone time quite  regularly.  <br/>
I need time when no one is talking to me and when I feel no one  is *about* to <br/>
talk to me.  I feel very psychologically connected to the  energy of others <br/>
in my house, and I need to disconnect once in a while.   Maybe your wife feels <br/>
the same way (and maybe doesn&#39;t realize it, yet), and  needs reassurance that <br/>
she&#39;ll be able to disconnect sometimes, too.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s worth exploring together.  It doesn&#39;t mean she doesn&#39;t  love her <br/>
daughter or anything like that.  Being connected to a  dependent human 24/7 <br/>
is difficult for some of us.  It&#39;s difficult for  me.  I recognize it and make <br/>
space for myself.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s so rare for a man to &quot;get&quot; unschooling right away.  You&#39;re a  breath of <br/>
fresh air.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My situation is similar to yours, in that I have an almost 5 yo dd who <br/>
would be going to kindergarten in the fall, and also a 2 yo dd, and I&#39;m <br/>
due with our third dd in July.  I also stay at home while dh works.  I <br/>
was thinking that perhaps your wife is feeling ambivalent because she <br/>
isn&#39;t sure she can meet the needs of both of your children now that one <br/>
of them is school aged -- I say this because it&#39;s something I sometimes <br/>
have doubts about.  Am I shortchanging dd1 when she wants to go to the <br/>
Arboretum, but it&#39;s time for dd2&#39;s nap?  I feel guilty that I can&#39;t <br/>
read as many chapters of &quot;Little House in the Big Woods&quot; as dd1 would <br/>
like because dd2 needs me to play with her, too.  I think it&#39;s a <br/>
natural part of parenting more than one child, but when you take on the <br/>
added responsibility of educating your children yourself, rather than <br/>
passing that onto the school system, it can seem overwhelming - not <br/>
only do you have the guilt that you are not meeting their emotional <br/>
needs, but added on to that is the feeling that now you&#39;re also <br/>
neglecting their education!<br/>
<br/>
It helps me to focus on how much time I do spend with dd1, how much we <br/>
do get to do together each day, and it is getting easier and easier to <br/>
include dd2 in a lot of things as she is getting older and more <br/>
interested in the same things as dd1.  It also helps me to look at how <br/>
much learning dd1 does on her own -- watching TV, playing, creating, <br/>
interacting with the things in her environment (including some things I <br/>
never would have suspected would have been such a rich source of <br/>
learning for her -- yesterday, she found an old bag of walnuts in their <br/>
shells left over from Christmas.  She started out by painting them with <br/>
watercolors, then they became color coded food for her different Barbie <br/>
Fairytopia dolls, then they were eggs out of which were going to hatch <br/>
new baby fairies, then they were money she used to play pet store, then <br/>
she tried cracking them with a nutcracker and then a lobster hammer, <br/>
and finally, she put the nut meats in a hollowed out rock to leave on <br/>
her toy shelf in case she or her sister got hungry later.  I mean, you <br/>
can&#39;t buy this kind of experience at the most expensive private <br/>
kindergarten in the country!)<br/>
<br/>
As far as friends go, so far all of our friends have been <br/>
non-homeschoolers we&#39;ve met in our neighborhood and through a weekly <br/>
playgroup we attend.  Since these children will all be attending school <br/>
eventually, I&#39;ve had it in the back of my mind that we need to connect <br/>
with some homeschooling families soon.  Luckily for us, there are lots <br/>
of homeschoolers in our area, and we&#39;ve begun attending a monthly <br/>
gathering of homeschooling parents and children which focuses on <br/>
textile arts -- knitting, spinning, weaving, etc.  It&#39;s an avid <br/>
interest of mine, so I really enjoy it, while the kids love getting <br/>
together with other kids.  Some people do textile projects, others play <br/>
and socialize, most do a bit of both, and everyone&#39;s happy.<br/>
<br/>
For field trips and such, we do a lot of things on the weekends, when <br/>
dh is around.  We go to fairs, expos, on picnics, fishing, on hikes and <br/>
walks and drives -- I can&#39;t stress enough how important it is to have <br/>
him participate as much as he does.  He often takes dd1 with him on <br/>
&quot;expeditions&quot; to Home Depot, the sawmill, the feed store, the tractor <br/>
store, livestock auctions, and he&#39;s looking forward to including dd2 <br/>
now that she&#39;s showing some interest in going along without me.  That <br/>
will give me some alone time with baby #3, and it&#39;s so good for the <br/>
older girls to have that special time with their dad.  During the week, <br/>
I take them everywhere with me -- the bank, the grocery store, the post <br/>
office, etc. and we go to a playgroup on Wednesdays, have a <br/>
long-standing playdate with another family on Thursdays, go to the <br/>
library one day.  We don&#39;t do a lot of elaborate field trips, but when <br/>
we visit family members in Philadelphia, we do go to museums and the <br/>
like.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is getting so long, I really just wanted to say that I <br/>
understand how it can feel overwhelming, and they way I try to fight <br/>
that is to look at how much we do accomplish just by living our lives <br/>
in the way that makes us happy.  It might help your wife for you to <br/>
assure her that she&#39;s not on her own in this, and that you will be <br/>
there to support her and to do things with the kids so she can have a <br/>
much needed break, too.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you -- I second what another poster said about your <br/>
being remarkably enlightened about unschooling -- how cool.<br/>

<br/>
For me, it has been really valuable to spend time hanging out with other homeschoolers at a weekly park day.  We&#39;ve had lots of good discussions about how kids learn, and the kids and moms have made some lasting friendships.  When I hear of homeschoolers who don&#39;t go to a park day, I think &quot;I couldn&#39;t do that&quot;, because I wouldn&#39;t like the isolation.  (I started off with a very active boy who loved the park but wasn&#39;t enthused about going other places.  If we didn&#39;t go to the park, and on playdates with people we met at the park, we wouldn&#39;t have gone anywhere.)  (Well, except the toy store.)<br/>
<br/>
Within my parkgroup we exchange hand-me-downs, trade off playdates and babysitting, listen to and support each other, and really enjoy each other&#39;s company.  I&#39;ve moved, but still drive 65 miles each way most weeks to see my park friends.  (OK, sometimes twice a week.)<br/>
<br/>
(OK, it takes time to get this close.  Doesn&#39;t happen the first week or month.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236959594">Hi Karen,<br/>
<br/>
You raise several good points. I&#39;m sure on some levels she was <br/>
looking forward to some time to herself and I agree that it&#39;s normal <br/>
to want to just get away sometimes. I don&#39;t know too many other men <br/>
who take baths, but I do if for no other reason just to get away for <br/>
20 minutes with a good book and just &quot;chill out&quot; or rather warm up!<br/>
<br/>
Since my job is one that she can do too, I&#39;ve suggested maybe <br/>
alternating work days so that one day she&#39;ll work and I&#39;ll spend time <br/>
with the kids and do housework, and the next she&#39;ll stay home and <br/>
I&#39;ll go to work. I&#39;m not sure if it will fly or not, but we&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll need to let her know that when Daddy comes home, Mommy can <br/>
retire for awhile and collect her thoughts, take a bath, go for a <br/>
walk, etc. Thanks also for clarifying the whole support group thing. <br/>
It&#39;s mentioned so often, that I&#39;ve begun to wonder whether or not we <br/>
can do it without the assistance of a local support group. There are <br/>
a few options nearby, but they are about 40 minutes away, and <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be as easy as just getting together with our neighbors and <br/>
friends with kids who live right nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your suggestions and thoughts. I really appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It takes time and it takes effort. A core group has to make it a <br/>
priority to show up to park days consistently - the kids have to be <br/>
confident that they will have friends there. If that consistency <br/>
doesn&#39;t happen, the park days won&#39;t take off and become the wonderful <br/>
resources that they can be. New people who come one week and then miss <br/>
a few and then come back once and then miss a few more weeks are making <br/>
it hard on themselves - sometimes people do this and then complain that <br/>
their kids weren&#39;t welcomed into the group.<br/>
<br/>
I know that it can be a little hard for a new kid to &quot;break in&quot; to an <br/>
existing park day group with kids who have been together for years. <br/>
Showing up irregularly makes that break-in time a lot harder and people <br/>
sometimes give up way too quickly, thinking their kid didn&#39;t get along <br/>
with the other kids there. The kids in our group are great - the want <br/>
to like new kids, they really truly do welcome them, but they&#39;re also <br/>
preoccupied sometimes with their own ongoing games and activities - <br/>
they sometimes have games going on that they&#39;ve been playing for weeks <br/>
or months. I know that can be a little intimidating - some kids seem to <br/>
jump right in and make friends immediately - in a few weeks it seems <br/>
like they&#39;ve been part of the group forever. Others take longer to warm <br/>
up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When Rain was little - up until 8 or so - most of her friends were other<br/>
homeschoolers, and our local group was a focal point for most of her<br/>
socializing, either formally or informally. We went to lots of activities<br/>
and met lots of kids. I got some support there, although I probably got<br/>
more support online - I&#39;ve been online since Rain was a year old and<br/>
started participating in homeschooling email lists by the time he was 2<br/>
or 3. We also moved every few years, so my online support friends stayed<br/>
the same while our groups changed. <br/>
<br/>
From the time Rain was 9 until now, most of her real-life friends have<br/>
been schooled kids who shared some of her other interests, with a few<br/>
exceptions. She does know a lot of unschooled teens online, and she sees<br/>
them once or twice a year when people came to party at the farm or met up<br/>
elsewhere, but her day-to-day friends were mostly schooled. It seemed to<br/>
work out just fine. She had a little curiosity about school, but that<br/>
seems natural, but she never wanted to go. She actually wanted her<br/>
schooled friends to ditch more, because often their schedules made it<br/>
hard to see them during the week, but they managed. <br/>
<br/>
So yes, I think we would have been fine without a local in-person group,<br/>
although here were definitely benefits to being part of one. It&#39;s a good<br/>
places to start, anyway. And I&#39;ve definitely looking into Kansas City<br/>
groups now that we&#39;re here (not an easy trip, just for the record, but we<br/>
made it - and we&#39;re now enjoying cable internet at home, for the first<br/>
time!).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391692134">Hi Jackie,<br/>
<br/>
No doubt your husband is at Home Depot buying supplies to put an <br/>
addition on your house for the babies 4, 5 and 6! You certainly have <br/>
your hands full, and I&#39;m glad you are enjoying it as much as it <br/>
sounds like you are.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so helpful to hear from other women and especially their <br/>
feelings, both good and bad about homeschooling. I&#39;m sure my wife <br/>
will be encouraged to know that she doesn&#39;t have to trek to Timbuktu <br/>
just to interact with other homeschoolers... that our regular old <br/>
friends with kids will suffice.<br/>
<br/>
Like you and your husband, we&#39;ve always been the type of parents to <br/>
do everything with our children from the every day trips to stores, <br/>
the post office, etc. right on up to trips where other parents we <br/>
know would opt to go alone. In fact, I won a trip for two to Aruba <br/>
for 8 days this December from a promotion through my business, and <br/>
we&#39;ve advised the travel company that we&#39;ll be purchasing two extra <br/>
tickets so that our children can come too! We can&#39;t wait, and I&#39;ve <br/>
already been looking into all of the wonderful unschooling activities <br/>
that we can take in: a semi-submersible submarine ride; cave <br/>
exploration; hiking in the desert; several different languages to <br/>
hear (Spanish, Dutch and Papiamento as well as some French and <br/>
Portuguese); butterfly farms; snorkling; etc...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll take your advice and reiterate to my wife that I fully intend to <br/>
help in every way possible. I wouldn&#39;t dream of missing out on the <br/>
fun! I&#39;ll also let her know that I&#39;ll make sure that she&#39;ll get <br/>
some &quot;me time&quot; for herself. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for your reply. I really enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>

I know what you mean. I did a martial arts class for awhile. In the <br/>
beginning I struggled with going sometimes as I felt somewhat like <br/>
the outsider coming into an established group. But each week I felt <br/>
less like an outsider, and more like a member. I&#39;m sure a few skipped <br/>

long before I did. In case you are interested I now have a black belt <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97080353">Hi Dar,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the reply. Isn&#39;t cable internet great?! I&#39;m glad to know <br/>
that it can be done without a local homeschool support group. There <br/>
are plenty in NJ, but most of them are north of quite a bit. Neither <br/>
of us are adverse to the idea, but just didn&#39;t want to feel the added <br/>
pressure right now. It&#39;s great to have these online communities. It <br/>
just opens the whole world up just a little bit more.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your thoughts.<br/>

want to get together with other kids a few times a week. Ds (4.5) will <br/>
do his best to make new friends anywhere we go. Other kids won&#39;t need <br/>
others around as much.<br/>
<br/>
As far as schooled vs. unschooled kids...right now ds has 3 friends who <br/>
go to pre-school. Two that go to a full-time public pre-school AND have <br/>
6 yr old sisters are bugging me. There&#39;s lots of &quot;give me that toy or I <br/>
won&#39;t be your friend&quot; &quot;that&#39;s not fair&quot;, fighting with the sisters, <br/>
etc. Then ds tries out that behavior on us and dd. So far, I&#39;ve been <br/>
thinking that the good outweighs the bad, but the tide is turning. A <br/>
local unschooling group is just getting started, so hopefully that will <br/>
work out in more get togethers, plus ds is now playing soccer and t-<br/>
ball, which is definitely 90 % a social event! And with warm weather, <br/>
we can just go to a local playground and run into other people.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At the beginning it would not have mattered. My son&#39;s (13) preference <br/>
when he was young was to not go anywhere. He could and still does play <br/>
alone for hours on end.  I don&#39;t think it would have mattered who ways <br/>
over to play with---except that as they get older some &quot;schooled&quot; <br/>
children will begin to want your unschooled child to &quot;prove&quot; they can to <br/>
addition, or can multiply, or read---that stuff can get yucky. Things <br/>
were different for me. I needed to meet folks. Online was nice, but I <br/>
was glad to meet some &quot;real&quot; homeschoolers in our county who we could do <br/>
things with. They were very nice folks, but I&#39;ve found that if you are <br/>
an unschooler or even an relaxed homeschooler it really does help to <br/>
have a support group with those types of families.<br/>
<br/>
My saving grace though has been the support group begun by Karen <br/>
(Tuckervill) and a few others of us who met on AOL. I really think at <br/>
times that if it had not been for them I would have put ds in school a <br/>
few times. I know I would have been so much more structured and would <br/>
have had one very unhappy teenager by now. It is so worth it to hang out <br/>
with other homeschoolers/unschoolers who will remind you that its just <br/>
fine that your 10 or 11 or 12 yr old is still not reading fluently. More <br/>
valuable then that is that they know him well enough to remind you of <br/>
all the great things they see in him that you may be missing.<br/>
Ya know, forest/tree issues.<br/>
<br/>
I would ditto Karen&#39;s comments about needing that alone time and maybe <br/>
your wife is feeling ambivalent because she was looking forward to some <br/>
breathing room. I know I need a few hours alone each night (hence I stay <br/>
up too late) to just  be left alone.<br/>

<br/>
I started to answer this the other day, but several others have said pretty much what I was going to say - &quot;It depends...&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If you are leaning towards unschooling and the only HS support is full of rigid school at home type, that is probably worse than no support at all.  There are 2 (were 3) homeschooling families in my neighborhood.  We don&#39;t spend any time with them because they differ too much from us in religious and educational beliefs.  Besides, they don&#39;t finish their &quot;homeschooling day&quot; until the middle of the afternoon, shortly before the school kids arrive home.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the benefits of having unschooling (or relaxed homeschooling) friends is that they are likely to be available during &quot;school days&quot; for spending time together.  Schooled friends and home&quot;schooled&quot; friends are not available for big chunks of time because of their school (time spent in school and time spent doing homework).<br/>
<br/>
When dd was kindergarten age, some of her neighborhood friends were a year younger and even the kindergarten ones were &quot;only&quot; gone for a few hours.  Plus, I was still involved in La Leche League which offered regular parenting support along with play groups.  It happened that several of the LLL leaders were homeschooling and they invited me to come to a meeting of a new homeschool support group when my oldest was 4.  Several of the families had young children (babies to age 8 or so) and several of us hit it off and wanted to do stuff together.  So I literally had a homeschool group even before I was officially homeschooling.  It was a diverse group whose members ran the gamut from secular school at home to atheist or non-Christian religion eclectic, relaxed, and unschoolers.  So my children have had homeschooling friends since the beginning, which helps to balance the interactions they have with their neighborhood schooled friends.  One of the original families is still amongst our best friends, and there are others who we continue to have casual contact with.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s relevant that we moved here when my oldest was 3 1/2.  I had attended mom/infant classes in my old town and stayed with the program until we moved during the month of March.  At that time, I was doing a co-op preschool with dd one day a week.  It was a really great program.  Parents were allowed to stay at the preschool (parents were also required to volunteer, so there were always at least 5 or 6 adults present) and the kids had free range except for beginning and ending circle time and snack time.  The teacher encouraged parents to follow the child&#39;s lead in choice of activities each week, even if the child spent most of their time at only one or two activities.  As a parent, the program offered me child development theories and ideas for fun learning activities.  When we moved, I decided not to look for another preschool because by then I had a second child and did not want to put one child in child care in order to be at a co-op preschool with the other.  The co-op had been a great experience so I did not even consider looking for a &quot;drop-off&quot; preschool program.  Also, dd at the time was generally reluctant to stay anywhere without me.  So, when she was ages 3-4, I first started thinking about the idea that while preschool can be a fun thing for some kids/parents, it is not an essential thing for children.  Now I think it can be damaging for some children too, but I was in a different space back then.  I was capable of providing the same sorts of activities for my child on my own and our new community had/has lots to offer for families with young children.  It was easy to find things to do and other young families to do them with.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I mean, did it matter to the kids that they were with other home schoolers or was it just important to be with other kids.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since we&#39;ve always known other homeschoolers IRL, and live in a stable neighborhood with many good friends (who now go to school), I can&#39;t know what it would have been like otherwise.  My kids have always had lots of other children around, though certainly not all day everyday.  But I think in some ways it matters more to at least know of other unschoolers as the child reaches middle/high school years.  It&#39;s nice to know real young people who are learning, thriving, and doing interesting things outside of and without school and teaching.  My oldest would be in 6th grade this year - first year of middle school here.  There is an awful lot of excitement generated by the kids who are off on this adventure of school lockers and school dances and buying your lunch ala carte in the school cafeteria and etcetera.  Most of them don&#39;t have the choice to stay home, so they make the best of it and find ways to have what fun they can.  I think it has been nice for my dd to have homeschooling friends to do things with and not feel so alone while the other kids are &quot;enjoying&quot; middle school.  Of course Lisa has also been able to find out from her schooled friends that it is not all fun.  Just about every one of them has at least once said they wished they could homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
One other thought, as my children (and I) are growing and learning, I&#39;m finding that friends are based far more on common interests and personality compatibility than on educational methods.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to read so many different perspectives. Its helpful <br/>
to realize that there really is the freedom to make decisions based <br/>
solely on what works for our family. I&#39;m disappointed to admit, that <br/>
I think we fell into the whole mindset of keeping up with the Jones&#39; <br/>
so to speak with our daughter. We HAD to sign her up for soccer, and <br/>
dance, and preschool, etc. Now that I look back I realize we were <br/>

My wife told me today when I went home for lunch that we are <br/>
definitely going to HS. She thinks she&#39;d like at least some <br/>
structure, and while that&#39;s not my preference, I need to let her <br/>
decide what will work for her and my daughter. I read quite a bit <br/>
about folks starting with a more structured approach and later <br/>
gradually just finding their way to more of an unschooling approach.<br/>
<br/>
My wife has been so willing to hear me out on this over the past few <br/>
weeks, she&#39;s reading books about it, including Teach Your Own, and I <br/>
don&#39;t want to seem like I&#39;m still not satisfied by pushing too hard <br/>
for unschooling. We&#39;ll just take it a day at a time and see where <br/>
this leads us.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very thankful for the support that you and the others in this <br/>
and several other forums have offered. The Internet truly is a <br/>
remarkable tool.<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
She can&#39;t really decide what will work for your daughter.<br/>
 <br/>
It would be good to really look at how learning works, rather than just how  <br/>
schooling works.  In very many ways, schooling DOESN&#39;T work, and the same  <br/>
damage school does can be done at home.<br/>
 <br/>

=-<br/>
 <br/>
Right.<br/>
So why start in a place that so many people reject?<br/>
They reject it for a reason.<br/>
 <br/>
If you can possibly get to the Live and Learn Conference (it&#39;s linked  here:<br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling_">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling)">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling)</a>   )<br/>
that would help immensely.  You could see other families in action,  and meet <br/>
lots of kids of all ages who are unschooled.  My own should be  there, who <br/>
are 13, 16 and 18 (will be 19 by then).<br/>
 <br/>
I can see not pushing, but not all things are equal and not all methods are  <br/>
benign.  Setting up a structure and then trying to undo it will have  results <br/>
and effects that can&#39;t be undone.<br/>

Thanks for your input. I try to give mommy some alone time each<br/>
night, although usually she prefers me to be there, massaging her<br/>
feet. So far I&#39;m very happy with the support I&#39;ve received online.<br/>
But as time goes on and we begin this venture, we&#39;ll have to seek<br/>
out others nearby. It would be nice to bounce ideas off of others<br/>
who actually know your children and see them developing.<br/>

I&#39;ve missed a few posts---a little preoccupied with conference stuff <br/>
(and the sun is shining, it&#39;s 75 degrees, and the soil is begging me to <br/>
start to dig, dig, dig! &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m assuming someone has pointed out that the Live and Learn <br/>
Unschooling Conference will be in the very centrally located city of St <br/>
Louis, MO (actually Fairview Heights, IL) October 6-9, 2005. It&#39;s well <br/>
worth the time and money to see for yourself how this unschooling <br/>
philosophy works in real families. Hundreds of families, all <br/>
unschooling, all in one place. Priceless.<br/>
<br/>
It could answer many questions, both literally (by asking questions and <br/>
having them answered) as well as figuratively (just watching and <br/>
interacting with other attendees). Website is below. I hope y&#39;all will <br/>
consider attending.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Bob,<br/>
<br/>
So much of this depends on your daughter&#39;s nature, too.  We know one<br/>
relaxed homeschooling family in the area (we are radical unschoolers)<br/>
and I know of unschoolers in my state through online connections, but<br/>
we honestly *don&#39;t* do any regularly scheduled playdates, park days,<br/>
field trips, etc.  We get together with neighborhood kids and see<br/>
friends sometimes (my son and I share some adult friends, and he has a<br/>
few &quot;small people&quot; friends, too, almost all schooled).  But it&#39;s<br/>
really not that often.  We can easily go for a few days at a time<br/>
without going out or seeing people.<br/>
<br/>
Why does this work for us?  Why am I not stark raving mad from<br/>
isolation?  Why is my son not bored to tears everyday?<br/>
<br/>
It helps that we&#39;re somewhat introverted people, and we really enjoy<br/>
the company of each other and ourselves.  <br/>
<br/>
But I also think that life is actually that interesting.  Days create<br/>
their own rhythms.  <br/>
<br/>
Lately our days have consisted of a few different parts:  time when<br/>
we&#39;re very interactive with each other and engaged in an intensive<br/>
activity (usually pretend Pokemon battles, where we write down all our<br/>
attacks and try to see how they play out against each other); time<br/>
when we&#39;re talking casually and our play is flowing from one thing to<br/>
another -- playing ball, birdwatching, swinging, dissecting leaves<br/>
with a toy hammer &lt;g&gt;; and time in which we&#39;re near each other,<br/>
checking in verbally every few minutes, but basically doing our own<br/>
thing (my son is watching TV and telling me which parts he loves while<br/>
I type this).<br/>
<br/>
All this variety and more, even on a day when we&#39;re &quot;just&quot; staying<br/>
home.  This rhythm itself will ebb and flow and morph into something<br/>
different, and then morph back again, over the months.<br/>
<br/>
We can sense when we need a change of scenery or company, and we are<br/>
open to outside opportunities that match our interests.  But we<br/>
respond to that need when it arises, instead of wearing ourselves out<br/>
planning and running because we&#39;re worried about &quot;achieving learning<br/>
objectives.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If your family has more extraverted needs, then putting time into<br/>
&quot;field trips&quot; and relationships with other homeschoolers may be a<br/>
priority.  But before I started *actually* unschooling, I had pretty<br/>
unrealistic expectations of what I would &quot;need&quot; to do.  That&#39;s why I<br/>
bring it up.<br/>
<br/>
What I would really focus on is knowing your daughter and letting her<br/>
lead whenever possible.  That will teach you much of what you need to<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339704320">Wow! You all have given me so much to think about, don&#39;t be <br/>
surprised if you don&#39;t hear from me for awhile as I&#39;ve got some <br/>
thinking to do. A month ago, maybe not even that long ago, I began <br/>
researching homeschooling. The precipitating cause for this was that <br/>
I&#39;d just learned that my 15 year old cousin who lives a few blocks <br/>
away is addicted to heroin and left school for a rehab clinic. I <br/>
read with great satisfaction of the various benefits to <br/>
homeschooling. I also was amazed at the myriad choices of styles and <br/>
philosophies.<br/>
<br/>
Then I became enamored with unschooling. Learning from living just <br/>
seemed to make sense and jived with my experience. So I began to <br/>
read more about unschooling. I read about what doesn&#39;t work in &quot;Why <br/>
Children Fail,&quot; and am about to start &quot;Teach Your Own.&quot; So then I <br/>
opened my big mouth and came in here and several other places <br/>
seeking some encouragement that I might share with my wife. Big <br/>
mistake. Now I&#39;m the one feeling overwhelmed as I read about Taking <br/>
Children Seriously, Non-Violent Communication, Principles vs. Rules, <br/>
not using diapers?!?!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not arguing with you folks. Truth be told, <br/>
I&#39;d be afraid to. :) It&#39;s just such a culture shock to consider my <br/>
children as autonomous. But I&#39;m definitely intrigued and plan to do <br/>
even more reading. Long ago my wife and I had a discussion where we <br/>
talked about what we wanted for our children as adults, and we <br/>
agreed that above all else we wanted them to be happy, truly happy. <br/>
Now perhaps some will argue that I&#39;m being coercive with even the <br/>
notion of wanting something for my kids, but I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s true. I <br/>
want them to be happy, content adults.<br/>
<br/>
So I may be all replyed out for awhile, as you folks have really <br/>
given me so much to think about. For that I&#39;m thankful. I&#39;m not <br/>
against the thought of a paradigm shift. If I can handle announcing <br/>
my atheism to my family after 10 years of Christian school, and four <br/>
years of Christian college, I can handle telling them we&#39;re trying <br/>
non coercive parenting. I just want to look into this some more and <br/>
continue to lurk and read your responses to others with questions <br/>
similar to my own.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already checked my local library to see if they have &quot;Joyfully <br/>
Living with Children&quot; (they do not) and/or &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; <br/>
(they do & I&#39;ve requested it). So it&#39;s back to the drawing board for <br/>
me. Of course if any of you can recommend any other worthwhile <br/>
books, I&#39;d certainly appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all of you who have taken the time to share your <br/>
thoughts and what you&#39;ve found works for you. <br/>
<br/>
The adventure continues,<br/>

You don&#39;t have to coerce. Just share.<br/>
<br/>
Ask about *her* school experiences. How well did *she* learn that <br/>
foreign language? What did she actually learn that she wasn&#39;t truly <br/>
interested in? What did she learn *best*?<br/>
<br/>
OH!<br/>
<br/>
Frank Smith&#39;s _The Book of Learning and Forgetting_   Frank didn&#39;t know <br/>
about unschooling (until he went to a conference), but he was WRITING <br/>
about UNSCHOOLING! Short, easy book---one-nighter----and SOOO <br/>
enlightening!<br/>
<br/>
Oh---and speaking of conferences, I bet she&#39;d love a vacation---how <br/>
&#39;bout a trip to the beautiful Midwest this fall? No coercion, just a <br/>
really delightful trip to a lovely city with LOTS of family-friendly <br/>
things to do----as well as an unschooling conference!<br/>

~~~<br/>
Bob, please don&#39;t confuse non-coercive parenting with unschooling.   They are <br/>
two different bodies of thought, and although they do intersect in some  <br/>
people&#39;s lives, you can be one without the other, and vice versa.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
What I think I would do if I were you is slow down a little and let the  <br/>
ideas percolate.  Try them out on other people and see if you can defend  them.  <br/>
Don&#39;t expect your wife to &quot;get it&quot;.  It&#39;s an odd feeling,  because usually it&#39;s <br/>
the mother who is at home and wanting to unschool...and my  standard advice <br/>
is for her to ask hubby to &quot;trust her&quot; for a year or so.   In your situation, <br/>
you&#39;re asking your wife to make more of a commitment than  just &quot;trusting you&quot;. <br/>
 She&#39;s the one with the child the most.  <br/>
 <br/>
Nothing has to be decided right now, though.  You&#39;ve been doing this  for <br/>
about a month, now.  Don&#39;t be an overzealous convert.  :)<br/>

You can tell your wife that there is no such thing as coercive learning, at  <br/>
