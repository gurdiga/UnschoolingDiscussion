<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475269113">&lt;&lt;The consequence of not making a bed is a bed that is not made. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Or a yucky dirty bed to sleep in....much more important to me than what my<br/>
guests think!<br/>

&gt; everything we do is a choice rather than a &quot;have to&quot; or &quot;need to&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At our house, learning that concept has made such an amazing difference in<br/>
how I feel, and how my son behaves.  And yet, I don&#39;t see that much else has<br/>
changed.  The living room DOES get cleaned, but usually when I feel like<br/>
some exercise.  (Bending over picking up little pieces is good stretching<br/>
warm-up for &quot;aerobic&quot; mopping...really!)  The beds DO get made, but because<br/>
we know why we do it -- we like to sit on them during the day, and if we<br/>
keep the quilts over them, the sheets feel nicer at night.  And so on.  I<br/>
was surprised how well that has worked.<br/>

&gt; sad to discover that someone feels they have to leave this list because<br/>
&gt; they have not been supported by it.  Like I said, I haven&#39;t been reading<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; was the argument, criticism, judgement, or whatever it was really that<br/>
&gt; important to the rest of the folks who participated?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It would really help if people who want to jump in and comment on a topic<br/>
that is already being discussed would read enough in the archives to know<br/>
just what they&#39;re commenting about.<br/>
<br/>
You say who cares?  Well Judie felt strongly enough to bring it up.  When<br/>
people questioned, not so much her beliefs but where they came from<br/>
historically, she waffled a bit and then left.  She wasn&#39;t willing defend<br/>
what she brought up, and it&#39;s quite clear in the posting guidelines that we<br/>
need to be willing to defend what we post.  If we don&#39;t want to be<br/>
challenged on our beliefs, we shouldn&#39;t bring them up.<br/>

<br/>
Without knowing what it was she had stated which we would have to have <br/>
&quot;supported&quot; for her to stay, you&#39;re really sticking your neck out in an embarrassing <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Can we leave commentary on posts to those who HAVE read whole threads?  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s not what it was about.  I know because I read it all.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m really so sad that Judie felt so attacked about her own belief system<br/>
that she had to leave this list... and it&#39;s an unschooling support list at<br/>
that!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She wasn&#39;t attacked, she didnt have to leave, and if you&#39;re really sad you <br/>
can go and find her and start a list with her which might be MUCH better than <br/>
this one.   People can be on several lists at once, and if this one isn&#39;t what <br/>
someone needs, it&#39;s easy to start a yahoo group.<br/>
