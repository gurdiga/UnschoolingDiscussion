<div id="ygrps-yiv-263811183">Well, congratulations!  Hmmm where are you at, and would you <br/>
consider rehoming those pups, or are they yours?  A friend of <br/>
mine&#39;s friend who lives with the family recently had an accident <br/>
with their daschie, who unfortunately died.  Just wondering if (not <br/>
a replacement, but you know what I mean) could bo in the offing?<br/>
