<div id="ygrps-yiv-129071314">I just wanted to let everyone know about a website we love called <br/>
www.webshots.com. You download a free desktop organizer, and then you <br/>
can choose whatever photographs you want. They&#39;ll be your screensaver <br/>
and your wallpaper. The wallpaper changes daily, unless you change <br/>
it, and the screensaver changes as frequently as you want it to. What <br/>
I think makes this of interest to unschoolers is that we chose mostly <br/>
animal pictures, and the kids are getting interested in all sorts of <br/>
animals they hadn&#39;t really been familiar with before. There are other <br/>
categories to choose from, too, like insects, nature, water and sky, <br/>
holidays, people, fire, storms, etc. And you can put your own <br/>
pictures on there, too. Just thought some of you might want to check <br/>
it out. Juli</div>
