&lt;&lt;  I was speechless. I had never met anyone personally who thought the <br/>
concentration camps were a sham.  <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;I said something to the &quot;teacher&quot;...I just couldn&#39;t be quiet. But the woman <br/>
just dismissed me as someone who was brainwashed by the public school system. <br/>
 She said, &quot;And I suppose you think the Civil War was connected to slavery, <br/>
too?&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important for unschoolers to understand the extent to which <br/>
hundreds of thousands  of structured homeschoolers go to indoctrinate their <br/>
children in a worldview which is not based on objective information.<br/>
<br/>
As important as it is to know about the holocaust at some point, it&#39;s <br/>
important for more liberal homeschoolers to REALLY take a look at the face of the <br/>
conservative homeschoolers&#39; teachings.<br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t know the kinds of things that are going on, or if we see them as <br/>
a very small part of homeschooling (they are a very LARGE part and there will <br/>
be millions of them if there aren&#39;t already), we will make false statements <br/>
and embarrass ourselves and thereby be plainly wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If someone says &quot;Homeschoolers try to keep their children away from  (choose <br/>
one from the following list)<br/>
<br/>
...other people<br/>
...the world<br/>
... people who are different than they are<br/>
...evolution<br/>
...global village ideas<br/>
...children&#39;s rights&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then the only true and right answers will need to be &quot;Some do...&quot; or &quot;Our <br/>
family doesn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The answers I&#39;ve heard newer, liberal homeschoolers give are &quot;WHAT!?  That&#39;s <br/>
ridiculous,&quot; and &quot;No they don&#39;t.   Homeschoolers are out in the world...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those statements are untrue.<br/>
<br/>
So while I&#39;m not dedicating my life to exposing or stopping them, it&#39;s worth <br/>
reminding people once in a while that yes there ARE people homeschooling <br/>
because they don&#39;t believe in the holocaust, that slavery was bad, or that the <br/>
Grand Canyon is old, and they want to tell their children a pack of <br/>
historic-revisionist, scientific-propaganda ink&#39;s-not-yet-dry lies.  They don&#39;t allow their <br/>
children to think for themselves or to read all kinds of things to make their <br/>
own decisions.  They don&#39;t allow their children to socialize outside their own <br/>
narrow belief system.  They don&#39;t allow their children to learn naturally <br/>
from the worl around them nor even sometimes to BE in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who doesn&#39;t know that or doesn&#39;t want to know that should just be sure <br/>
not to speak to reporters or politicians about homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who doubts it should just go to google.com and look randomly for <br/>
combinations of homeschooling and Christian and <br/>
discipline<br/>
materials<br/>
obedience<br/>
heritage<br/>
digest <br/>
godly<br/>
<br/>
IF they were to be exposed for what they&#39;re doing, homeschooling would change <br/>
for all of us, and that&#39;s one of the bits of tension that holds the <br/>
homeschooling movement together.  They get the test scores and we keep them from <br/>
looking like the threat to peace and the government that they intend to build up to <br/>
being.   We don&#39;t expose their total separatist insanity in exchange for them <br/>
not cutting liberal homeschoolers off altogether.  Some groups try, but they <br/>
get reminded pretty easily that they need to cool it.  For one thing, they <br/>
claim regularly to have invented homeschooling, after which liberals rode their <br/>
coattails.   That&#39;s a lie and their leaders know it, but they don&#39;t retract it.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a big evil we can only stop by endangering our own freedom to homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
Bummer.  But still it&#39;s good to know about them, because our children will <br/>
have to live with the products of their indoctrination into a whole &#39;nother <br/>
history and science and worldview.<br/>

<br/>
Might I humbly suggest, that it&#39;s also thier structured days and<br/>
curriculums that help the whole of homeschooling, especially unschoolers,<br/>
stay under the radar and be as &quot;un&quot; as you want? Unschooling is a really<br/>
radical way to think for the average citizen, even among those already<br/>
open and sometimes practicing non-traditional methods in thier lives. The<br/>
bulk of society and government is not really ready to see all of<br/>
homeschooling as loose and free as unschoolers live, and the pretty<br/>
records and plans of the more structured/traditional homeschoolers allows<br/>
a veneer for the whole movement to use as an umbrella of validity.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s a big evil we can only stop by endangering our own freedom to<br/>
homeschool&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For both sides. I think everyone puts up with alot of things they don&#39;t<br/>
personally agree with in order to protect the greater freedom. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688694783">Hi Susan<br/>
<br/>
I have to agree with you, about the idea of testing for worldview. I <br/>
wonder what the questions on that test are, and how they &quot;steer&quot; the <br/>
testee. Like any test, it&#39;s going to pinpoint the things that the <br/>
creators of the test want to highlight, bringing up certain things, <br/>
and ignoring others. <br/>
<br/>
For instance, I wonder if that test asks any questions about the <br/>
purposes of feasting. :) which I consider one of THE important <br/>
aspects of a Christian worldview. ;) What questions are there about <br/>
working and enjoying the fruit of one&#39;s labors, loving the wife of <br/>
your youth, (okay, the spouse of your youth LOL), the aesthetic value <br/>
of the navel...and so forth. I wonder if any of THOSE questions are <br/>
on that test! <br/>

I find this statement extraordinary.  There undoubtedly are many<br/>

I&#39;ve known a lot of homsechoolers over the years.  Some were unaccepting<br/>
of others&#39; beliefs, methods, motivations, other were much more pleasant<br/>
to be around.  There&#39;s no way their religion could have been used to<br/>
divide these folks into &#39;sheep&#39; and &#39;goats&#39;.  To do that is to treat<br/>
others the way we dislike being treated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Christian homeschoolers are not just homeschoolers who happen to be<br/>
Christian. It is a name adopted by a specific segment of Christians who are<br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
They are fundamentalist Christians. It&#39;s very likely they would not consider<br/>
most of the Christians here to be Christian. (The debates we used to have on<br/>
AOL&#39;s homeschooling boards over who was a True Christian :-/)<br/>
<br/>
They belong to HSLDA. They form support groups with statements of faith. It<br/>
is a political movement even if some of them don&#39;t realize it. They teach<br/>
their kids revisionist history. (Peter Marshall&#39;s The Light and the Glory:<br/>
Discovering God&#39;s Plan for America from Columbus to George Washington was<br/>
very popular at one time. I&#39;m assuming it still is.)<br/>
<br/>
Patrick Henry College is part of it. It&#39;s a college for homeschooled kids --<br/>
fundamentalist Christian homeschooled kids -- who are being groomed for<br/>
politics.<br/>
<br/>
If some or all of this is news to you, a good place to start is More<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-277289448">Before this goes down the path that it always goes down, be aware that not<br/>
everyone is using the word Christian the same way.<br/>
<br/>
To the broad spectrum of mainstream America, Christian means not Buddhist,<br/>
not Jewish, not Hindu, not Muslim. Obviously Christian means more than that,<br/>
but it&#39;s a broad religion encompassing a fair slew of beliefs and practices<br/>
centered around Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
But fundamentalist Christians of the most conservative type, identify their<br/>
narrow practice of Christianity as Christian. Period. No one is Christian<br/>
regardless of what you call yourselves. Not Lutherans. Not Episcopalians.<br/>
And very most definitely not Mormons or Catholics.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;d be pointless to argue whether the spread of this movement is truth or<br/>
politics, but, regardless, it has a powerful political component. There are<br/>
many practices and beliefs in fundamentalism (of any belief system) that are<br/>
easily encouraged and exploited by those who want to create a movement.<br/>
(Which leads into HSLDA and Reconstructionists and lots else. The Christian<br/>
political movement is huge and you should be aware of it, especially since<br/>
it has an effect on homeschooling laws.)<br/>
<br/>
People who use the word Christian to mean fundamentalist Christian are not<br/>
at fault and shouldn&#39;t be attacked. They are using the word the<br/>
fundamentalists Christians use for themselves. If you want to be angry at<br/>
anyone, be angry at the fundamentalist Christians for appropriating the word<br/>
Christian and turning it into something narrow that doesn&#39;t reflect your<br/>
beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Since most (mainstream) Christians tend to feel their religion is private so<br/>
don¹t discuss it much and the (fundamentalist) Christians are very vocal<br/>
about their beliefs some people do mistakenly equate fundamentalist beliefs<br/>
with all Christians. That is not chance. When fundamentalist Christians<br/>
speak their opinions, they self identify themselves as Christians as though<br/>
they¹re speaking for all (mainstream) Christians but are actually only<br/>
speaking for their narrow definition of Christianity.<br/>
<br/>
It is *not* safe to make assumptions about how someone is using the word<br/>
Christian. If you guess wrong you will be, once again, going down the<br/>
rancorous path we just visited of two people who think they¹re arguing<br/>
different points of view about the same subject, when they aren¹t discussing<br/>
the same subject at all.<br/>
<br/>
*Please* read and respond thoughtfully, with all this in mind. If you are<br/>
not aware of the extent of the Christian political movement, then be aware<br/>
that there are people here with a great deal more knowledge on the subject<br/>
of ³Christians² than you have.<br/>
<br/>
This topic is *always* a minefield of misunderstanding. All because the<br/>
political movement of fundamentalist Christians has (deliberately) chosen to<br/>
identify themselves as Christians.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&quot;Christian homeschooler&quot; indicates those intolerant fundamentalists.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I find this statement extraordinary...  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t you see my quotation marks and my definition?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But to assume that all people who call themselves<br/>
homeschoolers *and* Christians are &#39;intolerant fundamentalists&#39; is in<br/>
itself incredibly intolerant and judgmental.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t talking about people who call themselves &quot;homeschoolers *and* <br/>
Christians.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was talking about intolerant fundamentalists who call themselves Christian <br/>
Homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve known a lot of homsechoolers over the years. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me too!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; There&#39;s no way their religion could have been used to<br/>
divide these folks into &#39;sheep&#39; and &#39;goats&#39;.  To do that is to treat<br/>
others the way we dislike being treated.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You missed the point, though I did write carefully.<br/>
<br/>
The difference between Christian Homeschoolers and all other homeschoolers IS <br/>
by their definition the difference between sheep (them) and goats (a.k.a. <br/>
secular, worldly, the rest of us).<br/>
<br/>
Even within their sheep fold, they argue about the fine points of their <br/>
statements of faith, and they divide themselves in to more and more exclusive <br/>
groups over such weighty and world-changing dangers as Hallowe&#39;en, Harry Potter, <br/>
whether kids are allowed to play with non-Christians or even with other <br/>
Christians, whether their kids can watch television or listen to worldly music, or <br/>
even to Christian rock.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday (completely unrelated to this, yet applicable) Holly was in the car <br/>
while my husband and I joked about the dichotomy the world becomes if our <br/>
choices are &quot;Knowledge is power&quot; and &quot;ignorance is bliss.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Blissful ignorance isn&#39;t always so happy, and knowledge doesn&#39;t bring with it <br/>
the power to forget what you&#39;ve just learned.<br/>
<br/>
To be so near to information and to speak without finding it, though, is <br/>
neither bliss nr power.  <br/>

homeschoolers and then there are Christian Homeschoolers.  In the second case the word <br/>
Christian is not merely and adjective, but an identification.<br/>
