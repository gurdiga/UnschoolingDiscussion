<div id="ygrps-yiv-671503047">Hi All! <br/>
I have been on vacation and just caught a post about peeling paint lobby.  I <br/>
have no clue as to what the conversation is about!  But I do know a bit about <br/>
peeling paint.<br/>
I resigned directorship of a non-profit last year that I founded in 1994 to <br/>
eradicate childhood lead poisoning.<br/>
<br/>
Peeling paint is a real big issue for me and I would lobby, and have lobbied, <br/>
against anyone trying to say it is not.  Peeling paint, in homes older than <br/>
1978 can contain lead in very toxic levels, and usually does.  when this <br/>
becomes accessable to a child or the dust created by it settles in areas that <br/>
children frequent, disaster soon follows.  Peeling and chipping paint from <br/>
homes, due either to renovation or deterioration, that has settled, or been <br/>
left, on soil contaminates the entire perimeter of a home and children cannot <br/>
play safely there ... nore can you safely grow food crops there.  if you live <br/>
in a community where your homes are close together, the risk is heightened <br/>
greatly.<br/>
<br/>
Millions of our children have been affected by lead and many of us go unaware <br/>
of its toxicity and deterimental affects on growing children and developing <br/>
fetuses.<br/>
<br/>
And the sad part is that peeling paint is a violation of city ordinances in <br/>
most areas, more so because of its toxicity to the homes inhabitants and less <br/>
because of its bad appearance.  These ordinances left uneforced have damaged <br/>
millions of children.<br/>
