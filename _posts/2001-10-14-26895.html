  Dear Yahoo! Groups Members,<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo! Groups is undergoing a fixer-upper.<br/>
<br/>
The service will be down for a system upgrade Sat Oct 13 from approximately<br/>
10PM until 2AM PST (GMT-8). During this time the web site will be<br/>
unavailable and all email will be queued. All email sent during this time<br/>
should be delivered within a few hours of resumed service, but further<br/>
delays may occur due to backlog. Please do not resend email to your group.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for any inconvience this may cause.<br/>
<br/>
