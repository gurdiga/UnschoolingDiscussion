<div id="ygrps-yiv-504605917">Just wondering about something. Those of you who don&#39;t vaccinate for chicken pox and hasn&#39;t had a child get them, does there come a time when you expose them if you can?<br/>

My kids aren&#39;t vaccinated and the younger 3 have never had chicken pox. In the next 6 months they will all be 10, 9 and 4. I seem to have an immunity although I was never tested. If I do have that immunity, my kids may have it also. My oldest has had them before the others were born.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004129741">My older daughter (13) had all her vaccines, but my younger (8) has not.  They didn&#39;t require the chicken pox vaccine when the 13  year old was little, but I waited to get her naturally exposed, and she got them (mildly) in first grade, with only one faint pox scar on her cheek.  My 8 year old still has not gotten them, probably because everyone has gotten vaccinated by now.  I think I will go ahead and have her vaccinated, because my concern is that the older she gets, the likelier that she will come down with a more severe case that either causes severe scarring, or major health concerns.  Medical people have warned me that they have seen cases come through their office of children who have died or been blinded by severe cases.<br/>

Hope that helps!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-337427588">A friend&#39;s baby had them as a toddler and had a really bad case - had them<br/>
even in his mouth and throat.  I don&#39;t think age is the only factor in how<br/>
bad or how mild an individual&#39;s case will be.<br/>
<br/>
The neighbor&#39;s kids had them twice, which is not supposed to happen.  First<br/>
time very mild then more severe the second time.<br/>
<br/>
My kids (11 & 9) haven&#39;t had them or the vaccine.  My mom says my siblings<br/>
and I all had very mild cases.<br/>
<br/>
When my first child was a toddler, I asked our pediatrician when I should<br/>
expose her to chicken pox- as many of the moms I knew at the time spoke of<br/>
this as something you are supposed to do!  He said not to expose on purpose<br/>
because you never know which child will have that rare, life threatening<br/>
case.  (One doc&#39;s opinion.)<br/>
<br/>
OTH, kids can be contagious in the hours or days before spots break out - so<br/>
can expose others before they even know they have them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-623414878">I deliberately exposed my youngest last year.  And STILL she did not get them!<br/>
<br/>
I was 7 months pregnant with her when the other two each got them.  I wonder if that has anything to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
I also vaguely recall her having 1 or 2 pox but not being sure if thats what they were, when she was an infant.  Perhaps she is already immune.<br/>
<br/>
I&quot;m going to have her titer checked before vaccinating.  And I probably won&#39;t vaccinate until she hits the age of about 12.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908064515">We had this issue/opportunity come up just before my son turned <br/>
three. He in non-vaccinated. I would prefer that he get a natural-<br/>
born exposure to the chicken pox in childhood. Obviously this is the <br/>
safest, healthiest way to endure them. Especially since the vaccine <br/>
WEARS OFF in some unknown number of years leaving the &quot;vaccinated&quot; <br/>
child dangerously older!<br/>
<br/>
We had several issues however. My husband was not SURE that he had <br/>
the pox in childhood. He thought there may have been a pox or two. We <br/>
had him tested immediatedly to determine his risk of exposure. IF HE <br/>
HAD NOT BEEN IMMUNE, IT WOULD BE VERY DANGEROUS FOR HIM (AT 45Y/O) TO <br/>
LIVE WITH A CHILD WITH CHICKEN POX. The longer/greater the exposure <br/>
the worse the case of pox is. We co-sleep. This meant he could choose <br/>
to live elsewhere while our son had the pox (basically two weeks) or <br/>
choose to get a limited exposure AT THE SAME TIME, if we chose to <br/>
expose our son. Then my husband&#39;s case of pox would be more likely to <br/>
be less severe than it would be from our son exposing him <br/>
closely/greatly. (Basically, the first person in a houshold has a <br/>
less severe case, subsequent people in the same household have worse <br/>
cases due to duration of exposure.)<br/>
<br/>
Another issue is consent. This is one of the reasons we do not <br/>
vaccinate in the first place. The risks of vaccine exposure is <br/>
uncertain, knowingly injecting toxins in our child with some <br/>
assumed/questionable benefits did not allow our child to choose this <br/>
risk for himself. <br/>
<br/>
All the documentation on autism and vaccines is profound but <br/>
unresolved. But the horrible history of the vaccine SYSTEM making <br/>
vaccines safer YEARS after the manufactures KNOW the vaccines and <br/>
their ingredients are toxic is fraudulent at best. And the system <br/>
requires no ACCOUNTABILITY on the manufactures part. The manufactures <br/>
of vaccines are legally immune from lawsuits due to this fraudulent <br/>
system. Unfortunately, pediatricians are only superficially aware of <br/>
the lack of recourse that families damaged by vaccines have. <br/>
<br/>
Check out the government site VAERS. It is the vaccine adverse <br/>
effects reporting system. It documents the billions of dollars that <br/>
the government, not the manufactures have paid due to CHILDREN <br/>
DAMAGED BY VACCINES. The government actively encourages vaccines, but <br/>
at children&#39;s expense. <br/>
<br/>
Off my soap box.<br/>
<br/>
My husband had immunities. We decided we would wait until our son was <br/>
able to understand the risks, in simple terms, and choose for himself <br/>
whether he wanted to be exposed. I considered this the same issue of <br/>
consent that kept me from vaccinating him in the first place. My <br/>
awareness of the details allows me to attempt to give him an <br/>
objective understanding of the risks/benefits.<br/>
<br/>
Agreed, he is allowed the same choice with vaccines theoretically. <br/>
But the horrible history of the vaccine system can not be expressed <br/>
objectively.<br/>
<br/>
Mind you, I am a health professional with nearly twenty years of <br/>
experience and read volumes of data related to this decision before <br/>
and after our son was born. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-109844892">When the vaccine was first widely released I discussed it with our physician, <br/>
who was very suspicious of the vaccine. His recommendation then was to wait <br/>
and that if the kids got through puberty without having chicken pox to then do <br/>
the vaccine. So we waited, and we deliberately exposed a few times but never <br/>
caught, and then one day my oldest daughter woke up beside a friend who&#39;d <br/>
broken out in (unexpected) pox overnight and that was that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549764630">Hi again all... one thing I hadn&#39;t seen mentioned on this subject, is that <br/>
even children vaccinated for chicken pox can still break out with them.  My son <br/>
was not vaccinated and had (I&#39;d say) a normal case of them around 17 months. <br/>
He had 2 infected ones that left scars on his back, but otherwise got through <br/>
them without incident. <br/>
My daughter, on the other hand, was vaccinated, and only because her <br/>
pediatrician told me it was mandatory and that I had to do it.  Being a bit naive and <br/>
not checking into it, I agreed against my will.  HOWEVER, she still wound up <br/>
with a mild case of them around 2 years old.  I later found out that this is <br/>
rather common and regret bothering with the vaccinating even more. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-979377365">I had them when I was 18, and I had a very mild case. <br/>
I caught them from my brother who was 11, and he had<br/>
quite a bad case.  He was actually seen by a dr. who<br/>
took puss samples to put on a popcicle for his<br/>
children (EWWWW!!!) because he said if you caught it<br/>
from someone with a bad case, you tended to have a<br/>
mild case, and vice-versa, and with us it held true. <br/>
I certainly didn&#39;t wish I had had them earlier--at 18<br/>
I was vain enough not to scratch for fear of scarring,<br/>
and if I were younger I probably wouldn&#39;t have ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-684417192">We don&#39;t vax for anything.  I&#39;d much prefer they be exposed to chickenpox, as well as mumps and measles -- if such a thing were actually possible.  <br/>
 <br/>
My oldest had chickenpox at age 3, when you could still find &#39;wild&#39; chickenpox.  Now, if a child has chickenpox, it&#39;s likely he got it from the vax strain, either his own shots or being exposed to some other child who was recently vaccinated.  I&#39;ve heard some real horror stories of cases of the pox caused by the vax, so I&#39;m not sure how well that would fit with my plan.  <br/>
 <br/>
For Andy, who&#39;s 8, we had the chance 2 summers ago to expose him when a friend&#39;s kids had chickenpox.  Unfortunately, he was scheduled to travel to Hawaii with his grandparents two weeks later, so it would have been a really irresponsible time for me to expose him, and by association everyone he came into contact with on a plane.  As well, our entire household (except me) had recently survived a nasty virus that landed our Dan, then 17 mos, in the hospital with unexplained seizures.  I&#39;ve always suspected that illness was the result of exposure at a playground (counting backwards the incubation period we had), perhaps even a recently vaxed child.  Since then, I&#39;ve begun to think maybe only after Dan&#39;s 5yo.  <br/>
 <br/>
If the boys reach late adolescence without ever having had pox, mumps, or measles, I&#39;ll explain to them the risks of childhood diseases in adulthood and leave it to them to decide if they&#39;d like to be vaxed.  In spite of the recent media coverage, it&#39;s currently not safe (or possible) to be vaxed for whooping cough after age 7, so it&#39;s a non-issue in adulthood.<br/>
 <br/>
Personally, I survived both measles, mumps (5x) and chickenpox, with no lasting effects.  Both my parents and all their siblings (11 kids total, living poor in Okla & West VA) survived those plus whooping cough (pertussis).  My Mom survived polio as a nursing infant, with no lasting effects.  I&#39;m not terribly worried about them being unvaxed, but I&#39;d be happier if they had the opportunity to acquire natural lifelong immunities to the childhood illnesses.<br/>

This seems very odd. Generally the only place you can get the vaccine is  <br/>
doctors&#39; offices, right? <br/>
 <br/>
And the place you go with an illness or fever is the doctor&#39;s office,  right?<br/>
 <br/>
Healthy children walk in to get the vaccine which is then transferred to  the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973917667">Yes, it could be terribly dangerous for someone on steroids or other <br/>
immunosuppressants to be on the plane with chicken pox.<br/>
<br/>
The only polio in our hemisphere for over 40 years has been VACCINE <br/>
acquired polio until the Dominican Republic found a few cases in the <br/>
past 5 years. If you are traveling there be causious of fecal <br/>
contaminated food. Duh. The oral polio vaccine gives polio to many <br/>
people every year. <br/>
<br/>
The risk of whooping cough to children over two is generally marginal.<br/>

See the CDC site; order the &quot;pink book&quot;. Read the CDC&#39;s statistics, <br/>
they are hardly convincing of the benefits of vaccination when you do <br/>
the math yourself. The risks of getting hit by lightening are greater <br/>
than many of the risks of acquiring the diseases.  Because first you <br/>

We selectively vaccinate and do so later.  One thing I read was that the <br/>
reason for the schedule has nothing to do with when it is best for <br/>
children to get the specific vacinations, but instead it is because most <br/>
parents will bring their infants in to the doctor but not their older <br/>
children. <br/>
<br/>
I think most people do just give whatever vaccinations the doctor <br/>
recommends without asking any questions.  I think that is sad. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087257992">Actually this myth is addressed with well documented research by Neil <br/>
Z. Miller in a concise book Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and <br/>
Effective? ISBN #1-881217-10-8. <br/>
<br/>
There has been a natural decline in vaccine illness for many decades <br/>
preceding the initiation of vaccines with cyclical but lessening <br/>
outbreaks. The advent of healthier diets, stable economics and <br/>
improved hygiene are the main causes. The medical assumption that the <br/>
vaccines are responsible is not supported by the history of these <br/>
diseases. <br/>

There are at least 2 countries that don&#39;t have *mandatory* vaccines, <br/>
and their vaccination rate is much, much lower than here, (I think <br/>
England and Austrailia?) and yet, their disease factor is about the <br/>
same as ours. Also, there is a good deal of evidence that shows <br/>
diseases in decline before there were vaccines available. They site <br/>
cleanliness, better eating habbits and better general overall health <br/>
and healthcare as reasons for the decline.<br/>
