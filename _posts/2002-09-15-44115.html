<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305048506"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; People go the zoo and they pace themselves so they can see everything,<br/>
&gt; instead of deciding in advance what people want to see most, and just having<br/>
&gt; their lunch right there, in front of one of someone&#39;s favorites, and then<br/>
&gt; hotfooting it straight over to another favorite, and staying THERE long<br/>
&gt; enough to really watch.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This one gets to me, too, Sandra.  Best visit we ever had to a zoo was the<br/>
day the zookeeper at the small mammal house at the zoo in Tacoma answered<br/>
all my son&#39;s questions about pygmy marmosets and fed them their crickets 2<br/>
hours early so he could stand there and watch them eat.  All we saw that day<br/>
at the zoo was the small mammal house.  But it was still worth the<br/>
admission.<br/>
<br/>
All these school kids kept coming through screaming, looked at the spider<br/>
monkeys on their worksheets and ran off to see the other things they had to<br/>
see.  Tim could not understand why they did that.  The only reason I could<br/>
come up with was that the school wanted them to see everything.  His answer<br/>
was merely, &quot;Oh.  I&#39;m never going to school.&quot;  Told him it was fine with me,<br/>
and we went back to watch the pygmy marmosets just one more time before we<br/>
went home!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190459150">we have joined toe zoo society. there are 126 zoos involved. for $50 a year <br/>
we get free admission to all these zoos and they have special events for <br/>
society members this year at riverbanks they have classes for all age groups <br/>
that get them up close to the animals and they do sleepovers where you spend <br/>
the nite at the zoo and learn about the animals that are usually asleep <br/>
during the day. thought i&#39;d let you guys know about it. we love it, we go <br/>
almost every day my hubby has off!<br/>
