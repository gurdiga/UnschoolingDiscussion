<div id="ygrps-yiv-186710694">Wonder if we could scan and put up our signatures and a few sentences for folks to have a look see.  I like my cursive, my signature looks like a doctors who has been on an all night bender.<br/>

Can anyone write with both hands at once?  I can, but the left hand is a mirror image of the right - not as neat mind you, but you can make out the words.  Other than that nifty party trick, I can&#39;t write for squat with my left hand.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Wonder if we could scan and put up our signatures and a few sentences for <br/>
folks to have a look see.  I like my cursive, my signature looks like a <br/>
doctors who has been on an all night bender. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I could mail mine to someone who could scan and put it up.<br/>
<br/>
Would we need another photo album to put handwriting in?<br/>
Would we need another list altogether?  <br/>
Are we irritating the Bejeeezus out of people who don&#39;t know why we don&#39;t <br/>
just talk about unschooling all the time?<br/>
<br/>
If someone is scan-wise and interested in putting in stuff for those who are <br/>
scan-deficient (my scanner is unplugged, banished, for messing up my <br/>
computer, and will become a gift for my friend with a PC), tell us where to <br/>
mail these handwriting samples.  And what do we write?  I think it should be <br/>
John Holt quotes, or other unschooling-promoting quips.   How long?  What <br/>
letters need to jump over the lazy dogs for any of you who actually know much <br/>
about handwriting analysis?<br/>

school. Poor Mother had to go to &quot;conferences&quot; one in<br/>
a while when they asked &quot;why?&quot;.  Just somehting to do<br/>
to add another step between me and boredom. My 1st<br/>
grade teacher (she was German, with accent) was quite<br/>
tolerant, even amused.  She just used a mirror to<br/>
grade them. Everyone else saw it a freakish. I also<br/>
decorated the margins with seasonal drawings or things<br/>
apporpriate to the &quot;lesson&quot;. 7th grade social studies<br/>

I just walked out, so many times.  By 14 I had given<br/>
up on even going through the motions anymore and<br/>
forced my will on parents and county and got into an<br/>
Independent Study HS, then tested out as soon as<br/>
legally possible.  But then I did not have the idyllic<br/>
childhoods I am hearing about here and I grew up in a<br/>
major city.  There were plenty of kids who were<br/>
drunks, drug addicts, and/or having sex by graduation,<br/>
and I am talking about MIDDLE School here (10-14) and<br/>
drinking, drugging and sex ON SCHOOL GROUNDS.  Who<br/>
knows what they did when they were NOT at school...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I was a wild child too, at that, but I never<br/>
looked at myself that way, and my friends nicknamed me<br/>
the &quot;Straight Edge&quot; in more ways than one, but also<br/>
because I was the tamest and most responsible by far<br/>
among them.<br/>

And typing even faster. Even with one finger at a time Michael is faster at typing than printing.  <br/>
Michael is third generation (maybe more) sloppy writer. FIL doesn&#39;t write and his printing is somewhat legible. My dad didn&#39;t write and his printing was only legible after years of torture by the school system. Ruler to the hands and all. Dh&#39;s writing is non-existent and his printing is so bad that I often can not decipher it, and I&#39;m good at that. Going through the school system in a Spec ed class Michael a least missed most of the trauma of learning to write or print legibly. He only types one fingered but it is so much faster than his printing.  <br/>

This brings to mind a question I encountered with my daughter.  She is<br/>
not interested in hand writing but mastered enough so she could function.<br/>
 She doesn&#39;t see a need for cursive but the bank recently requested that<br/>
she &quot;sign&quot; her withdrawal slip in cursive.  She refused and they took her<br/>
PRINTED signature.  Actually, I think the best lesson of the year was<br/>
learned right there.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know what to tell her when she asked me why.  My guess was that<br/>
it&#39;s just another one of those things that is required because &quot;they&quot; say<br/>
it&#39;s necessary, no logic or reasoning required.<br/>

D&#39;Nealean.  The teller refused to accept my signature because she said it was <br/>
printing.  I shrugged and said that&#39;s what my signature looks like.  The <br/>
manager said the problem was, printing is much more easily forged than <br/>
cursive writing.  I didn&#39;t say anything else, and eventually they opened the <br/>
account.<br/>
<br/>
My kids&#39; father wants them to learn cursive, claiming they&#39;ll be unable to <br/>
function in the world without it.  I&#39;ve pointed out to him that his cursive <br/>
writing is almost illegible, that for years I asked him to print letters to <br/>
me from shipboard so I could read it.  <br/>

Emma is working with calligraphy, because she thinks it&#39;s pretty.  Nick <br/>
prints -- and developed clearly readable writing when Dungeon and Dragon <br/>
worksheets because critical tools.<br/>

Eve doesn&#39;t seem confused to me- she writes quite a bit for a 5yo and I&#39;ve noticed is starting to incorporate some lower cased letters. <br/>

I had a friend teaching pre-school for the deaf when Kirby was coming into <br/>
his school-age years and not being sent to school.  She saw him writing in <br/>
all caps one day and said it was REALLY a bad thing to be doing, and I HAD to <br/>
get him to use lower case.  I said someday I&#39;m sure he will.  She had that <br/>
look pass over her like &quot;Do I remember the number for the social services <br/>
office?&quot;  But here she is with beautiful handwriting learned in Catholic <br/>
school and does NOT write for fun, not one word.  We&#39;ve known each other for <br/>
many, many years, and in all the opportunities for her to write any little <br/>
summary or description or article, she left it to me or someone else to do <br/>
it.  She has a writing aversion like some poeple have math- or <br/>
reading-aversions.  So I thought it quite a &quot;consider the source&quot; moment.  <br/>
She wanted Kirby to suffer as she had suffered, and to be ready for the tests <br/>
and measures her special ed kids&#39; IPCs required.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s Not Fair&quot; was hanging in the air.<br/>
