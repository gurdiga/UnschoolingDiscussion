About 13 years ago, before we had our 3rd child, we decided we wanted to buy a<br/>
bit of land and return to living in the country - we had both grown up on farms.<br/>
Anyway, it didn&#39;t work out - before we could sell our town house my parents got<br/>
sick, I got pregnant again......<br/>
<br/>
As the years went by, my parents died, I had my 4th child - and I started<br/>
learning about permaculture. So now at last, we have sold our house, and are<br/>
renting while we find a piece of land - we are going to make an offer this<br/>
weekend on one piece, and have another place that we also like waiting as second<br/>
choice!<br/>
<br/>
At times I feel like we are a bit old to be doing this (48/49), but the longer<br/>
we wait, the older we get, and there isn&#39;t going to be a better time than now!<br/>
<br/>
I hope everything works out as well as you wish for your plans. Keep planning,<br/>
keep working, and most of all, keep dreaming :-)<br/>

It sounds like you should start your OWN list ... people who want to live in <br/>
a cooperative, rural setting.  I bet it would be a hit.<br/>
