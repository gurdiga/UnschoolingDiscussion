<div id="ygrps-yiv-532289777">I would never ever leave any of my children home alone at any age before 12. <br/>
I don&#39;t even think I let my first home alone until she was like 13. And even <br/>
then for a very short period of time.  Now she&#39;s almost 17 and I will leave <br/>
her with the other 3. Then again, we aren&#39;t ever gone long without taking <br/>
the kids with us. So again, it&#39;s for a short time. I also have the luxury of <br/>
having my mom here in an adjoining in law apt. So even when my oldest is <br/>
alone with 3 little ones, help is always just a knock away. It&#39;s not that I <br/>
don&#39;t trust my kids, I don&#39;t trust others, regardless of the neighborhood I <br/>
live in. Maybe I&#39;ve seen too many movies.<br/>
<br/>
My ex step daughter lived pretty much alone since she was like 6 and nothing <br/>
bad ever happened. Physically. She has issues though. I still would never <br/>
leave any young ones alone, for a walk or visit next door. Might be <br/>
paranoid, but I&#39;m comfortable with that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471876404">I agree that around 12,maybe 13 or 14 is a good age for them to be home alone.I was left home alone while my parents had to work to make ends meet when I was in 3rd grade.I really had fun being alone,but if something would have happened,I had no phone.I never had a ny problems,I never would open the door for anybody.But I sure wouldn&#39;t let my 3rd grader stay home alone,there&#39;s just too many weirdos out & about,not to mention if she would accidentally start a fire,what would she do,would she be too scared to call for help & try to put it out on her own.I think there are too many risks involved no matter how great the child is.Just my opinion,of course!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;I would think that where a person lives also has some influence on how <br/>
they feel.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For me personally, it wouldn&#39;t make a bit of difference. City, suburbs or <br/>
deep in the boonies, I would do and not do the same with my kids. I just <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to take a chance if something happened. Either the kids <br/>
getting scared while alone or something coming up that they thought they <br/>
could handle but couldn&#39;t. One never really knows unless put in a situation.<br/>
