<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885547395"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt;The spirally vortex-plastic coin collecting things at the zoo and the <br/>
&gt; museum<br/>
&gt; here (my vocabulary is great, huh??) where the coins go around and <br/>
&gt; finally<br/>
&gt; down the hole is a cool physics toy.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was at WalMart (the store I hate to love) yesterday and a mother was <br/>
dragging her son along toward the door. I didn&#39;t get the sense that she <br/>
was in a huge hurry, but when the son (about 7) saw one of those <br/>
vortex-coin deallies and expressed interest (in a sweet, non-irritating <br/>
way) she suddenly seemed hell-bent for the exit, saying &quot;Oh, you put <br/>
coins in there--you can see it some other time, okay?&quot; I thought later <br/>
that I should have whipped out a coin and said, &quot;Do you want to see? <br/>
I&#39;ll show you!&quot; Poor little guy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve kept a dictionary in the car for a long time--a little plastic one, <br/>
but good enough for usual needs. Today I bought TWO plastic folding maps <br/>
of the area--one for each car. We just had a garage sale and I felt <br/>
rich. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
