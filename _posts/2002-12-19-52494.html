many fillings)---no braces. Cameron is 15 Jan 23. No cavities so far. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t they wish!  I figure it&#39;s genetics.  My dh has only about 3 or 4<br/>
fillings in his mouth.  Mine is full of them.  I don&#39;t think I have a tooth<br/>
without a filling.  My older two inherited my (and *their* father&#39;s) bad<br/>
tooth enamel.  My youngest inherited *his* dad&#39;s.  He&#39;s 15 and no cavities<br/>
so far.<br/>
