<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565389496">I bought this film as soon as it was available (I&#39;d signed up for the release update, so I got it immediately) and watched it with my husband as soon as it came.  my husband isn&#39;t interested in reading much about unschooling, and after he watched this he commented that he finally felt like he really understood what unschooling looks like and feels so much more confident about our path.  I highly recommend it.</div>

I’ve sent the questions to Clara Bellar and will get back with you.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of points about this—it presents a more competitive, perfectionist sort of home ed.  At least one of those interviewed is against children’s use of electronic media. So while it might be inspiring and interesting, especially to someone who knows nothing about unschooling, I don’t think someone should make any one source or resource their only input.  Considering what others have done, and why should be helpful to deciding what you will do, and why.  Why should be the most important part. :-)<br/>
<br/>
There’s another film to check out, too, called Class Dismissed.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://rent.classdismissedmovie.com">http://rent.classdismissedmovie.com</a><br/>
<br/>
They followed a family through their decision to homeschool, through their explorations, and how and why they settle on unschooling.  It’s really well done.<br/>
<br/>
They’ve also set up the ability to watch all their video footage of nine intervies.  One is me and Kirby.  Deb Lewis wrote, of that:<br/>
&quot; I really liked the extended interview with Sandra and Kirby. I liked it more than the movie, and I loved what Sandra says about the difference between learning and education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I thought Linda Dobson’s parts, in the film, were great, so that’s another one that it might help to watch.<br/>
<br/>
A few of those interviewed for Class Dismissed would not make good members of this discussion, because they never really unschooled, or because they don’t see value in online exploration or video gaming.  <br/>
<br/>
Filtering through lots of information can help you clarify what you believe and why.  Part of becoming expert in anything is knowing enough, at some point, to see flaws or problems with the writings or beliefs of other “experts.”  It’s about having enough knowledge and direct experience to see the scene from above, rather than from below (in a way of thinking of it).<br/>
<br/>
So people who want to really understand where they are in time and possibility, with unschooling, might want to watch both of those films.  Read several people’s unschooling books. Sort through good examples and bad examples, clear ideas, confusing or less valid statements.   <br/>
<br/>
It can’t be done in the absence of children.  As you read a little (or watch a little), try a little, wait a while and watch, a body of your own certain knowledge will grow.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337784425">Clara Bellar has sent some details on format:<br/>
<br/>
_______<br/>
It’s multi zone & PAL.<br/>
So it’ll play on a computer. Not on a DVD player if it only plays PAL. Multi zone means there won’t be a region code problem.<br/>
Will steam it after we do the screenings. We love the screenings b/c they are an opportunity for conversations, exchanging emails locally etc. Harder to get screenings organized when the film is available in VOD. <br/>
