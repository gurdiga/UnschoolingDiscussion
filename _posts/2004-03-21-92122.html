<div id="ygrps-yiv-837651287">My name is Laura! My family & I live in Central FL.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll apologize now because I always get long winded :-)<br/>
<br/>
I started homeschooling my son about 2 years ago after having the <br/>
local school accuse me of not being a good parent because I would <br/>
not increase the meds he was taking for ADHD. (Horrible, horrible <br/>
experience where I was ganged up on by about 7 different people <br/>
claiming to know what was best for my son many had never even MET <br/>
him!) <br/>
<br/>
It was the absolute BEST decision we had ever made. He was happier, <br/>
we were happier and he was able to be a KID and play instead of <br/>
always in trouble or detention or me having to pick him up from <br/>
school. &lt;shudder&gt; School was miserable! <br/>
<br/>
Since we&#39;ve been home, his meds have been decreased. (Ok, after <br/>
reading this list for quite some time I KNOW there are those of you <br/>
that don&#39;t agree with medication etc. but this is my story so, <br/>
nah!!) HAHAHA Sorry, not my intention to offend just a little bit <br/>
of a weird sense of humor, I guess! But when we tried the medication <br/>
after a year of me refusing and trying EVERYTHING as an alternative, <br/>
the difference was literally night and day! Soon after, when my son <br/>
openly told me that the meds &quot;help make his brain stop spinning&quot; I <br/>
knew I made the right choice and kicked myself for not doing it <br/>
sooner. I still hate the meds and am happy to announce that my son <br/>
told me that he wants to have a few `test&#39; days to see if he can get <br/>
himself off the med. <br/>
<br/>
Back to school the public school REALLY damaged my son! My whole <br/>
family has loud, opinionated, exuberant, silly personalities. My son <br/>
used to be the same way! They crushed his spirit! It&#39;s taken two <br/>
years to get it back! I joke about how GREAT it is that he argues <br/>
with us now! (Ok, not argue-argue but will stand up for himself!) <br/>
<br/>
When we first took my son out of school, my daughter was in <br/>
preschool because all her friends were going and she BEGGED to go! <br/>
HAHAHA So, that gave my son and I the chance to re-connect. Although <br/>
now, I know I could have done MUCH better!<br/>
<br/>
Like many new homeschoolers, I desperately felt the need to school <br/>
at home. (Which I hated too since it is TOTALLY against my own <br/>
personality!) We tried everything! I knew about &quot;unschooling&quot; and <br/>
joked on our lazy days that was what we were doing that day! DUH!!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d realize how wonderful those days were and we&#39;d `unschool&#39; for a <br/>
month! (Yeah whatever `unschooling&#39; for a month means!) Then I&#39;d <br/>
get scared and we&#39;d go RIGHT back to school at home or unit studies <br/>
(that KILLED ME!)<br/>
<br/>
My son, Aryan, is now 11 and my daughter, Adryan, is now 6 and both <br/>
are home! Still trying to &quot;do it right&quot; I&#39;d attempt to &quot;school&quot; my <br/>
son so that I could &quot;catch him up&quot; since he is/was still behind in <br/>
public school terms. Doing this, I felt that I was almost neglecting <br/>
my daughter even though we did tons of FUN stuff together like <br/>
snuggling up and reading and playing. (All while I yelled into the <br/>
other room for my son to get his work done!! Man! I wanna start <br/>
flaming myself the more I think of it!) But I thought, she&#39;ll have <br/>
plenty of time to get where she &quot;NEEDS&quot; to be in her education, I <br/>
need to work on my son! (DUH, DUH, DUH!!) <br/>
<br/>
The funniest thing happened though any time we&#39;d get together with <br/>
family they would always comment on how smart my daughter was and <br/>
even more advanced than her same aged cousin. Ahh she&#39;s just a <br/>
smart kid! Of course it didn&#39;t dawn on me that while I was so <br/>
busy &quot;schooling&quot; my son, my daughter was unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
I think the &quot;Light&quot; finally clicked on for me a few months ago. <br/>
After a nice day of &quot;school-at-home&quot; struggle. My son asked (ok, <br/>
begged) if we could be done for the day! &quot;Fine, I&#39;m getting tired of <br/>
the fighting too!&quot; He went his way and I went mine. An hour or so <br/>
later I was working on our taxes and starting grouching about not <br/>
having a statement that I needed to complete them. My son asked what <br/>
the statement was and I explained it to him. He left came back an <br/>
hour or so later and told me all that he had learned about <br/>
investments and public companies and stocks and all sorts of stuff! <br/>
He had researched the encyclopedias, online, all types of places and <br/>
I wonder if I shouldn&#39;t have him doing my taxes!! HAHAHAHA<br/>
<br/>
THAT WAS IT!!! Why am I abusing myself AND my kids with this school <br/>
concept! So we just quit!! I contact the ONE person in my Homeschool <br/>
group that I knew unschooled and begged to pick her brain and help <br/>
me get over my doubts! It was SO enlightening! <br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m pretty sure that I&#39;ll start doubting again but I think we <br/>
have that covered now too! I opened up and discussed my insecurities <br/>
with MY CHILDREN of all people! We all crawled up on the fold out <br/>
bed that had been their &quot;fort&quot; for the past few weeks and I asked <br/>
them how they liked our new way of doing things. They LOVE IT!! <br/>
(DUH!) So I just told them that I would try my best not to, but if I <br/>
start to get crazy and doubt myself I need them to help reassure me. <br/>
If it means rolling their eyes at me and doing one math worksheet to <br/>
shut me up, then please help me out. My son just laughed at me and <br/>
asked if he should go do one then to just hang onto in case I needed <br/>
it! (Little smarty pants!) HAHAHAHA<br/>
<br/>
My friend, Susan is still helping me! One of my main issues is <br/>
documentation so each week I email her what we&#39;ve done, <br/>
I &quot;translate&quot; it into educationese and she `checks&#39; my work and <br/>
offers suggestions to help me give up the teacher mode and enjoy my <br/>
kids learning and enjoying life!!<br/>
<br/>
So, that&#39;s my long hello and introduction! If you made it this far, <br/>
grab some chocolate and reward yourself! HAHAHA<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for their involvement on this list! I read it <br/>
religiously and am learning a lot!<br/>
<br/>
OH and before I forget, I want to say &quot;Hi&quot; (if she made it this <br/>
far) to Amanda. I read your post and saw that you are in the MOMS <br/>
Club! I&#39;m an Assistant RC for the MOMS Club! I&#39;m a bit fortunate <br/>
because I&#39;m one of three homeschoolers in my chapter. I started a <br/>
Mom & Kid Book Club in my group. There is no required book to read <br/>
or anything just a time for us to get together. The kids discuss <br/>
whatever book they&#39;d like and the moms discuss whatever book they&#39;d <br/>
like. It is a bit hard because of preschool and public school but <br/>
the way I see it, while our activities are kid-friendly, the MOMS <br/>
Club is for ME. My kids are starting to learn and appreciate that <br/>
while I drive them to this place or that and this activity and that <br/>
activity for THEM, I still need my time too! And documented that <br/>
would be Interpersonal Relationships, Communication and Human <br/>
Needs! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, let me stop before you all fall asleep and your chocolate melts!!<br/>
<br/>
Have a cool day!!<br/>

Maybe you should change your rules to &quot;just say no.&quot;  If you go crazy and say <br/>
&quot;worksheet&quot; they should say &quot;Mom, no; go read at unschooling.com or the list <br/>
archives.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856407416">I have been down this road with my own son, and understand the frustration.  <br/>
We also tried meds for our son (now 13), and if you ask me did I see an <br/>
improvement in how he &quot;comformed&quot; in school and at home, then I would have to say <br/>
yes, but I knew in my heart that it wasn&#39;t the right thing to do, because <br/>
conforming meant giving up his individuality, and to me that&#39;s a crime. That is when <br/>
I went looking for alternatives, and found unschooling. I was petrified about <br/>
taking that step, but when it came down to what was best for my son ( and his <br/>
sisters), then there was no turning back.  I only regret not doing it sooner, <br/>
because he loved learning and was reading and writing at the age of three <br/>
(completely self lead too). School destroyed that in all of them. It is amazing <br/>
what one year has done. They are all so happy, and have realized their own <br/>
strengths and weaknesses.  They learn and do what they love, which has given them <br/>
the confidence that they had lost, and the desire to learn more.  In time my <br/>
fear of bringing them home to learn has been replaced with confidence and <br/>
excitement, because we are all free from the confinements of the school system <br/>
which had put so many limits on what they were able to accomplish in their own <br/>
education, and who they were as individuals. I love that our family is so healthy <br/>
now compared to the chaos of what it was before.  Torturous<br/>
mornings, and chaotic evenings fighting about grades and homework, not having <br/>
enough time to just be a family. We were literally falling apart. <br/>
I also hate the idea of putting labels on our children just because they <br/>
learn differently, and am so glad that I was strong enough to lead my children in <br/>
a different direction.<br/>
I took him off the meds and realized that the reason his &quot;head was spinning&quot; <br/>
was due to the stress of having to function in the school setting and the <br/>
pressures that that entailed.  He has grown into a very self assured young man who <br/>
loves people, and excels at many things.  He never ceases to amaze me with <br/>
his creative ideas for making money, and his talent for teaching other children. <br/>
 <br/>
My oldest daughter (16) was so destroyed by comments made by an art teacher <br/>
in her first year of high school, that she stopped drawing all together.  This <br/>
was a girl who has been drawing since she could hold a pencil, and is very <br/>
gifted.  It took me a good six months of trips to many art museums, and <br/>
reassuring her of her talent, before she picked up her pencil again.  She has since <br/>
become so confident about her art, and very accomplished.  She is also a very <br/>
gifted writer, which was completely overlooked in her ps language arts classes.  <br/>
She is working on compiling her writing into a book.  My youngest just decided <br/>
she wanted to write her own book one day, and is on her 5th chapter.  It is <br/>
just so much fun watching them become the great young people that they are, and <br/>
growing together as a family. <br/>
I wish you the best in your journey, and hope that you become confident in <br/>
your abilities to do what is so healthy for your children.<br/>
<br/>
