<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092575307">Still ROFLMAO!! Kim, my mother told me when I had just started dating that<br/>
if ever I thought I was going to be pressured into going too far with a boy,<br/>
to make sure that I was wearing either really tatty undies or none because<br/>
either way I would be embarrassed for him to find out!! LOL (actually, don&#39;t<br/>
tell her but if ever I told a boy I wasn&#39;t wearing any, it seemed to have<br/>
the opposite effect from that desired by my dear mother!!) BLUSH<br/>
