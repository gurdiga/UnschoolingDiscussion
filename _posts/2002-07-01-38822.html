<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671025348">I Just wanted to thank the people on this list for calming my nerves in regards to unschooling, especially Joyce and Sandra for their very insightful messages that are full of clarity and truth. It is amazing, I will read a message and think wow, this person wrote a really good message and then Sandra will add another dimension to it and I think &#39;gee this woman is absolutely incredible with the way she views things&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of families that I know off that are homeschooling and I had become worried that maybe I should be doing more. They have created a playgroup and some are teaching their children letters etc. (a playgroup I didnot join because my son doesn&#39;t like group situations - I even worry if that is OK). But after the short time I have been on this list I have become more relaxed and not worrying so much. You will laugh when I tell you the children are about 4yrs of age - but today I looked at my two children - 4 in Oct and 2 in Sept and I thought - why the hell am I worrying - these years should be all about play not concerned whether or not if they can count or know their letters - unbelievable - even amongst homeschoolers you can get caught up in the pressure for your young children to learn. I was worried that I was too lazy to teach now I am beginning to realise that I was getting caught up with &quot;The Hurried Child Syndrome&quot;. So just a thanks to the list for help bringing me to my senses. The pressure is off.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You will laugh when I tell you the children are about 4yrs of age<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not laughing at all. Preschool has become so common that many parents get<br/>
flabbergasted if a child isn&#39;t going. &quot;But they&#39;ll fall behind! They won&#39;t<br/>
be ready for school!&quot; That attitude in society is very very sad.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; these years should be all about play not concerned whether or not if they can<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes! What in the world does a toddler need with letters? A teen will find<br/>
many uses for them but can&#39;t appreciate and explore the nuances of mud.<br/>
(Unless they take a class and call it pottery ;-) We may not be able to<br/>
understand what a toddler sees in mud or banging pots or pulling everything<br/>
off the table, but we need to trust that what they&#39;re finding so fascinating<br/>
is what they need to explore. It *is* valuable to them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was worried that I was too lazy to teach<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, *they* are too unsure of their abilities as parents and too afraid that<br/>
nature couldn&#39;t design a thinking being properly.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What gets me is that preschool used to be a voluntary thing some people did <br/>
as a way to get kids used to the idea of going to school. It was a chance for <br/>
children around the age of four to interact with others, usually two or three <br/>
hours a day, two or three days a week. Now children are sent to preschool <br/>
starting as young as two all day long, all week long. Then when they are <br/>
about four or so they go to pre-k. Many schools in our district have added <br/>
pre-k programs and the idea of adding pre-k as an actual grade to go through, <br/>
is being tossed around. I am astounded at all this so called *need for <br/>
children to have every chance at success in school* that has yanked them all <br/>
straight from the breast right into four brick walls and a view of the <br/>
teachers parking lot. <br/>
When I went to Oklahoma last week, I went with my sister to pick up her <br/>
daughter (2) from preschool. I stood at the door while she got my niece ready <br/>
to go and looked across the hall at the pre-k room. The teacher was trying to <br/>
have a lesson, she had a plate with plastic food on it. A hamburger, corn on <br/>
the cob and some other things like milk and juice. She asked the circle of <br/>
faces sitting before her where did all this food come from. The kid I liked <br/>
best said it was plastic not food and it came from the toy shelf. Of course <br/>
he was gently reprimanded and the question repeated. A little girl said you <br/>
get food from the grocery store, which caused an argument over which was a <br/>
better place to shop, Super-Wal-mart, Super-Target or some other store. Then <br/>
the teacher asked where the food came from before it was in the store. <br/>
Another little boy said his uncle brought the food in his truck, so the <br/>
teacher asked how it got on his truck to which the little guy said &quot;They <br/>
loaded it up at the warehouse&quot; The teacher still had a sweet smile on her <br/>
face, but you could tell she was frustrated. By the time they got to the idea <br/>
that hamburger and milk come from cows, and corn is grown in a field, and <br/>
what cows are was all explained the idea was lost on the kids. Some were <br/>
picking their noses, some were picking on each other, one was looking out the <br/>
window, and my sister says to me wasn&#39;t that lesson a good idea? Aren&#39;t those <br/>
kids lucky to have learned all that? I told her the kids were bored, didn&#39;t <br/>
care, and too young for those lessons anyway. She said they wouldn&#39;t have the <br/>
opportunity to learn about this elsewhere, it was the best thing they were in <br/>
preschool so they wouldn&#39;t be behind in kindergarten. We got into a <br/>
discussion about all this and it didn&#39;t go well. My sister finally ended it <br/>
by making a statement to me that just shocked me. She said &quot;Public school was <br/>
good enough for me, it will be good enough for Isabelle.&quot;  That was when I <br/>
realized where this attitude about how children should learn and be raised <br/>
comes from. I was so sad.<br/>

Nancy, this is a really powerful statement:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...straight from the breast right into four brick walls and a view of the <br/>
teachers parking lot.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The windows leading to the teacher&#39;s parking lot where I went to high school <br/>
were painted brown.  We couldn&#39;t even see the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And about that food...<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s pretty cruel to talk to kids about lifesize REAL food and then <br/>
take them to the cafeteria and give them those itsy bitsy kid-lunches instead <br/>
of a hamburger and some corn on the cob, milk and juice!!   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I had Moly, I breast fed because my Mom had done it, and that is all I <br/>
knew. Not to say I didn&#39;t know about formula, just that that wasn&#39;t what had <br/>
been used in my home growing up. What I didn&#39;t know was the push and pull of <br/>
the breast vs. bottle argument that is almost political in nature. I <br/>
breastfed both kids till they were three. I had a year where I was breast <br/>
feeding them both. I never thought about any link between breastfeeding and <br/>
sending kids off to school at younger and younger ages. But I see now, how my <br/>
choices to work the night shifts to avoid daycare, to breast feed longer than <br/>
convention, to have a family bed, all contributed to me finally deciding that <br/>
keeping the kids home was what I wanted. That sending them off to school <br/>
seemed pointless since they had already learned so much and had never set <br/>
foot into a preschool, daycare or school. I think that is why it was so hard <br/>
for me when Jack wanted to go to school last year. OTOH, Jack going to school <br/>
is what helped me find a name for all the weird things I was doing. &lt;g&gt; It <br/>
helped me be able to defend my choices to Darin&#39;s mother and others, and <br/>
myself.<br/>

people who comment and even criticize the choices others make on issues such <br/>
as schooling choices, or even parenting styles. But breastfeeding? Why? Why <br/>
would someone criticize a mother for the way they choose to feed their child? <br/>
Thousands of years and that was the only option. Formula has only been around <br/>
for something like 100 years or so. I don&#39;t make comments to my friends who <br/>
choose to bottle feed. Why why why???<br/>

<br/>
People have been feeding babies artificially since at least the greek and <br/>
roman times.  And there&#39;s a gravestone in England where they carved into <br/>
stone that the woman breastfed all her own children.  Having wetnurses was <br/>
the big thing.  They would even send babies away to the wetnurse&#39;s house.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a new thing, unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
There were feeding cans in the 16th and 17th century, made of pewter.  With <br/>
lead.  And they didn&#39;t know about what was growing in there.  People would <br/>
refill them with more milk (animal milk) and water and oatmeal and EEEEYEW!!! <br/>
No wonder the mortality rate was high.  Those cans used to sit on low <br/>
shelves, like by the fire, and toddlers could come by and suck out of the <br/>
tube, which went down into the bottom, like a watering can.  Like some of the <br/>
plastic cups at the grocery stores.<br/>
<br/>
I was stunned when I read all that.<br/>

breast milk. But I always assumed that formula was a post W.W. I invention. <br/>
My Grandma told me she used to make a formula out of condensed milk, water, <br/>
corn syrup and some other things. But I guess I assumed actual bottle <br/>
feedings from formula wasn&#39;t around pre twentieth century.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493421371">I never thought about any link between breastfeeding and<br/>
sending kids off to school at younger and younger ages. But I see now, how<br/>
my<br/>
choices to work the night shifts to avoid daycare, to breast feed longer<br/>
than<br/>
convention, to have a family bed, all contributed to me finally deciding<br/>
that<br/>
keeping the kids home was what I wanted<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the breast vs. bottle argument that is almost political in nature. I<br/>
&gt; breastfed both kids till they were three. I had a year where I was breast<br/>
&gt; feeding them both.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really admire women who do this as I know that it not always easy to do so<br/>
when not supported by the mainstream. Currently I am tandem feeding my 21<br/>
month old dd an 4 in Oct ds and I am always being questioned about my<br/>
attachment philosophies.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Same here. I wonder if whether the society we find ourselves in were more<br/>
supportive and encouraging of attachment philosophies such as the family<br/>
bed, extended breastfeeding and child-led weaning, non-punitive discipline<br/>
etc. how much more resistent people/parents would be to placing their<br/>
children into daycare, preschool and school! It was this attachment<br/>
philosophy that has led us as parents to unschooling our children. My son is<br/>
at the age of going to kindergarden/preschool but there is no way I could<br/>
imagine him giving up &#39;booby&#39; for a constructed environment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-429084764"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; People have been feeding babies artificially since at least the greek and<br/>
&gt; roman times.  And there&#39;s a gravestone in England where they carved into<br/>
&gt; stone that the woman breastfed all her own children.  Having wetnurses was<br/>
&gt; the big thing.  They would even send babies away to the wetnurse&#39;s house.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I read awhile back that the World Health Organisation suggest the following<br/>
<br/>
1) To breastfeed your child exclusively for the first 6 months before<br/>
introducing solids and then to breastfeed for at least 2 years.<br/>
<br/>
and also (cut and paste)<br/>
Breast feeding is the best food choice for infants. Other choices, called<br/>
breast milk substitutes, are less good. The World Health Organisation ranks<br/>
baby feeding as follows:<br/>
<br/>
  1.. The best is breast feeding by mother<br/>
  2.. The second choice is the mother&#39;s own milk which has been taken from<br/>
mother and fed to the infant<br/>
  3.. The third choice is the milk of another human mother<br/>
  4.. The fourth and last choice is formula baby milk<br/>
So a wet nurse/or milk from a wet nurse is acknowledged as being better than<br/>
formulae - I wish this was more well known in our community.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Jack is six now and I still have milk. I think the reason is because I <br/>
breastfed Jack until he was three and until he was four he would still climb <br/>
on my lap occasionally to nurse for comfort, or if he was particularly tired. <br/>
Moly quit entirely on her own at three. I have asked my doctor why this is <br/>
and he has told me some women still produce milk occasionally and since I <br/>
breastfed for so long with both kids it wasn&#39;t unusual. I have thought, <br/>
occasionally, about donating my milk to a bank for mothers who have premature <br/>
infants and can&#39;t keep up with the demands by pumping alone. There isn&#39;t one <br/>
here where I live though and I think that is very unfortunate<br/>

Preemies need newborn milk, though, and it&#39;s very different.<br/>

I wonder if the milk of a new mother, though, mixed with the waterier milk of <br/>
toddlers wouldn&#39;t still be way better than ANY formula.  Probably so.<br/>

milk but the hospital refused on the grounds of liabilty of lawsuite. One<br/>
thing I do know is that mothers who have pre babies produce milk that is<br/>
more conducent (I think that is the word!) to the babies needs. More<br/>
essential nutritions that a prem bubs would need and would get if still in<br/>
the womb. We women have amazing abilities don&#39;t we.<br/>
