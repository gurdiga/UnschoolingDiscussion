<div id="ygrps-yiv-479614461">I am a new member.  I just withdrew my 7 yr old, Bailey from school <br/>
before Christmas.  I have received a million emails since I joined, <br/>
but I&#39;m a little confused as to how this works.  Most of the emails <br/>
don&#39;t make any sense to me because they are replies to someone <br/>
else&#39;s question, that I most of the time do not see.  Can you give <br/>
me some pointers?  Also, I&#39;ve seen reference to a conference and <br/>
meetings.  How can I find out about these, and start getting <br/>
involved with other homeschoolers/unschoolers?  Look forward to <br/>
getting to know some of you!!!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>

many unschoolers and as a group in general I have found them to be<br/>
very respectful of the children.  I love the HSC campouts and its<br/>
killing me that I can&#39;t come to the Carpenteria one, but my babe is just<br/>
too young to go to the beach (7 wks) this year! <br/>

&gt; wandering through the vendor room at the HSC conference last year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The vendor room pays the bills - they tend to take the first 50 vendors <br/>
&gt; that send in checks, out of worry that the room won&#39;t fill up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Still - there was some very cool stuff in there, even for unschoolers, <br/>
&gt; ....the person from Destination Imagination was there - wonderful <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Last year I was the volunteer for soliciting new vendors.  I personally<br/>
had a hard time contacting anything other than &quot;fun&quot; vendors.  While<br/>
I couldn&#39;t turn away the curriculum folks, I did my best to get the<br/>
games/arts/cool science and other kits/books/etc. vendors in there<br/>
first!  I nearly died when I saw the dairy council had signed up for<br/>
a space &lt;gag&gt;.  Unfortunately I had terrible morning sickness and<br/>
couldn&#39;t make last years conference and didn&#39;t get to see how the<br/>
vendor hall turned out.  <br/>

wanted to protect my bank account &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
But - I do wish there was a way to get the very cool and interesting <br/>
and NONcurriculum NONschoolish types from being the first ones to get <br/>
their checks in. Unfortunately, the creative, eccentric, interesting, <br/>
outside-the-box types are also the ones more likely to procrastinate, I <br/>
guess.<br/>
<br/>
Still - there is always more than enough cool stuff to make it <br/>
worthwhile to hang out in there for a couple of hours!<br/>

&gt; school schedule are doing so. Airfare is often more expensive (we&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; coming from the other side of the country), and to be honest, for people<br/>
&gt; from a temperate climate, the eastern seaboard heat and humidity and pretty<br/>
&gt; off-setting at that time of year. Is there any reason the unschooling<br/>
&gt; conference can&#39;t be in, say, late September? Better weather, less<br/>
&gt; travelers...<br/>

scheduling conferences, right? And NBTSC?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They are still driving it in September though.  The traffic in Kittery began <br/>
over a month ago and continues until the weather gets cooler. Then the leaf <br/>
peepers arrive and the Florida winter people leave. Every 3rd or 4th car is a <br/>
Mainer the rest are from all over the US but mostly MA. <br/>
I realize im talking about Maine but most of them drive through MA where the <br/>
traffic is the worst.  There are also times of the day that are better to <br/>
drive and I think whatever exit it ends up at tends to be locals and those making <br/>
pit stops so the exist shouldn&#39;t be too bad where ever it ends up.<br/>
As long as it isn&#39;t too close to Boston you can drive around the outer parts <br/>
of Boston, you&#39;ll be glad you did. <br/>
Also if you coming up 95 I would think that many of the other states are just <br/>
as busy. Here they dont start school until the first week of September.<br/>
Salem area isn&#39;t too touristy though so it should not be bad at all.<br/>
The heat is way better in September too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324385303">I had one moment to share that stood out in my mind, along with many others <br/>
that I won&#39;t bore you with.  My son bought a book about robotics which he <br/>
consumed Saturday night.  On Sunday he was talking about how he wants to make this <br/>
robot.  A Mom came over and asked about the robot and he told her about the <br/>
arms and wheels etc.  She said &quot;how wonderful...now when your Mom tells you to <br/>
clean your room the robot can do it for you.&quot;  My son Dallen looked at her and <br/>
without missing a beat said &quot;oh she never says that but it could make <br/>
chocolate milk for me.&quot;  I loved that moment.  He didn&#39;t just agree with her he <br/>
corrected her without a moment to think about it.<br/>
Gotta love those unschooled kids<br/>

Oh yea, and Ren I was there.  Saw you a couple of times running after that <br/>
cute boy of yours.  Am definitely planning to come to the fun fest in 2005.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ahh, Pam, come on.. SHARE.. Nothing is boring.. (OK, not much is <br/>
boring).. :-)   That was so neat that Dallen thought of something <br/>
MUCH better than cleaning his room with a robot.  Chocolate milk, I <br/>
like the way he thinks.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We had an &quot;moment&quot; or actually several moments.. on our way home from <br/>
the conference.   We stopped to have dinner at O&#39;Charleys in a town <br/>
(cant remember the name of it) along I-77, still in SC, about 15 <br/>
minutes out of Charlotte.   There was a fella doing magic tricks for <br/>
the kids waiting for thier meals.  He came over to our table and <br/>
started some small talk.. &quot;Where are you from, etc&quot;  I told him where <br/>
we are from and that we were on our way back from an unschooling <br/>
conference in Columbia.   He said. &quot;oh, you homeschool, so you teach <br/>
your kids at home&quot;  I said.. &quot;Well, they are AT home, but I don&#39;t <br/>
really teach them&quot;  He made the most puzzled face and said..&quot;Who <br/>
teaches them?&quot;  I said,&quot;nobody really, except themselves&quot;  He <br/>
said. &quot;You mean they don&#39;t learn anything?&quot;  I laughed and said.. &quot;I <br/>
said I didnt teach them, I didnt say they don&#39;t learn. they are <br/>
learning all the time&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 This was the first 100% upfront and no skirting around the subject <br/>
conversation I had ever had with a stranger about unschooling.  I <br/>
usually just say homeschool and smile and nod and agree with whatever <br/>
folks say.  This guy looked like he was going to freak out or <br/>
something.   I said, &quot;We just live our lives, we do whatever we want <br/>
to, the conference was great, there were about 300 other folks there <br/>
that are just like us!&quot;   He kept shaking his head and frowning, <br/>
looking at the kids from one to the other.  I said. &quot;What did you do <br/>
in the summer break when you were in school?&quot;  He listed a few fun <br/>
things, and I said ..&quot; See, thats what we do all year, just like <br/>
there is no such thing as school&quot;   Then he looked at me dead on and <br/>
said. &quot;You&#39;re kidding, right?&quot;   We all laughed and said.. &quot;No, we&#39;re <br/>
not kidding&quot;  He just could not grasp the concept.  He kept <br/>
saying, &quot;how do they learn&quot;  I said.. &quot;What??? do they look stupid or <br/>
something?&quot;  He said. &quot;Uhh, no no no.&quot;  By this time, the kids were <br/>
anxious to see the card tricks so he started his little show.  He <br/>
kept making little jokes about homeschooling..  He did one trick and <br/>
one of the kids said. &quot;hey, thats Tromp l&#39;oeil!&quot;   LOL..  the guy <br/>
laughed and said... well yeah, I guess you could call it that.. And I <br/>
went on to tell him that we saw a slide show from an artist who does <br/>
Tromp L&#39;oeil.  He asked me who the artist was and I told him it was <br/>
Christian Thee.   THEN, he said that he was good friends with <br/>
Christian Thee!  He knows him from a magic club they both attend.  So <br/>
THEN I told him that the lady who coordinated the conference was <br/>
friends with Mr Thee and I asked him if he knew Kelly Lovejoy.. He <br/>
said he did!  He said he was friends with Kelly too!!  From the magic <br/>
club.  I said.. &quot;Well, you know, Kelly unschools her kids too&quot;  I <br/>
don&#39;t think he knew that.. LOL. (btw, Kelly, his name was Chris)<br/>
<br/>
  He went on to lecture, and I mean lecture with the pointing finger <br/>
and all, straight to my kids faces,  not even looking at me, like he <br/>
as warning them about me or something!.. about the importance of math <br/>
and higer math and geometery and stuff.  He kept saying... &quot;You need <br/>
to learn it!.. LEARN THE MATH!.. looking and pointing at each of <br/>
them.  LEARN THE MATH, you will need it to get in college and get a <br/>
good job!&quot;  My kids just kind of looked at him like he was a fool or <br/>
something. <br/>
<br/>
 They DID enjoy the magic show and the whole time I was thinking.. <br/>
How much higer math did you learn to do this bit???  LOL.  I&#39;m sure <br/>
he had a &quot;day job&quot; that he uses all kinds of higer math in, but I bet <br/>
he likes doing the magic tricks a lot better!<br/>

I&#39;m glad you shared this.<br/>
<br/>
The way people think, or fail to think, about learning in this country, <br/>
is so tragic and frustrating and aggravating, that I have to agree with <br/>
you that laughter is the best response.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
We hear stuff like this so often, that with repetition, it gets <br/>
bizarrely funny, like Abbott and Costello doing Who&#39;s On First.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174628637">I have been feeling so grateful for the conference all week but have been too busy interacting with my visiting SIL and her kids to get in to post.  Her controlling parenting has been highlighted by having been around so many parents who choose to respect their children.  It&#39;s been hard to keep my mouth shut but my kids&#39; actions have spoken for me.  My 6yo didn&#39;t want to go with them to the science museum one day (was busy farming) and it set my SIL off.  She couldn&#39;t believe we would allow him to choose not to go.  I am hoping that her huge reaction to him and the subsequent embarassment she felt made her think a bit about the whole control issue.  It is hard towatch her kids so trapped by her routine and morning studies (all summer in prep. for going back to school) and not say anything.  It&#39;s been a sad week.  <br/>
 <br/>
THANKYOU Kelly and all of the speakers and parents...There were so many fabulous moments.  One of the biggest highlights for me was watching Rowan in both of her numbers at the talent show just bravely do her thing - be it making up a story on the spot or juggle with one ball.  She personified pure innocence and trust.  It was great.  The whole talent show was so much fun.  And seeing Sandra and Marty&#39;s identical fabulous smiles;  watching Ben talk about rules vs. principles and realizing that he was at this point despite a military background;  watching my friend that came with me getting it.  She is going to unschool now!   I am eager to have my family come with me next time.  But they are def. benefiting from my having gone.  Oh.  I highly recommend Sandra&#39;s thinking sticks for young ones too.  My 6yo can&#39;t get enough of them!  <br/>
