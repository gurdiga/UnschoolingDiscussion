<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, the only article I&#39;ve had published in HEM was in the same issue as one<br/>
&gt; of yours Rue, and now Pandora&#39;s box too? Cool!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ren<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I remember that issue!  I get mine weeks after everybody else because mail<br/>
is so slow here, so I had already managed to forget that you all had<br/>
articles in it.  But it was so cool, turning the pages, and there was Rue,<br/>
and Ren, and Sandra, and a whole cool magazine worth of people that I sorta<br/>
kinda knew.  <br/>
<br/>
It was fun.  <br/>
