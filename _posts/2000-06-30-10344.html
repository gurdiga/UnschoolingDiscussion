I was a lone leader for a long time, what seemed like years but was actually <br/>
months.  Maybe you can voluteer to help her with some of her <br/>
responsiblilites, if she has any she can delegate to you.  I NEVER turn down <br/>
an offer for help and I doubt your leader will either.<br/>

&quot;It helps me to remember that people are more important than ideas and that <br/>
being kind is more important than being right.&quot; <br/>
