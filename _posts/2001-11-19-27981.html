<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144705117">Here in Tucson it&#39;s still warmer than I&#39;d like, but we&#39;ve had a couple of days<br/>
where we could break out the long pants. Anyone on this list from Kentucky? How&#39;s<br/>
it there?<br/>

&gt; the weather where you are?  We&#39;ve just had a bunch of badly-needed rain,<br/>
&gt; and now we&#39;re getting cold and clear.  I hadn&#39;t thought it would be clear<br/>
&gt; enough on the Wet Coast of Canada to see the Leonides last night, but they<br/>
&gt; were quite spectacular (for the little while that I could stay awake to watch).<br/>

by midnight, the sky was full of clouds.  We knew there wasn&#39;t much<br/>
chance of seeing the meteor shower.  We laid on a tarp, wrapped in<br/>
sleeping bags, my son&#39;s little warm hand in mine.  While we were hoping<br/>
for the clouds to break,  we began to hear the geese.  They came over our<br/>
little town in waves,  their bellies shimmering like silver ribbons<br/>
against the grey sky.  The sound was indescribable.   I can&#39;t begin to<br/>
imagine how many there were.  When our hot chocolate ran out and my son<br/>
fell asleep, we carried him inside.  We went out again about two o&#39;clock<br/>
and still the geese were coming.  We watched and listened for two more<br/>
hours, before their numbers seemed to dwindle.  It was all so utterly<br/>
magical.   Not one shooting star but thousands of shining geese, and they<br/>
sang to us too.  <br/>
