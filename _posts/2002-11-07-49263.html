I think there was a thread a while back about reluctant husbands, you might <br/>
want to look in the archives for good ideas.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was really nervous at first, but we have always had a good <br/>
dialogue about everything.  I kept giving him little things to read, but he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t get around to them.  (In his defense, he had a very busy full time <br/>
engineering job and then is a musicologist on the side.)  Our local hs group <br/>
was having an open house and I had planned on going alone.  At the last <br/>
minute (literally during dinner) I decided we all should go.  Lots of <br/>
grumpiness all around, but it worked.  He met the children and the parents <br/>
and realized how much better a life our kids would have by not going to <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
That hurdle being crossed, we both attended a state conference last March.  <br/>
His eyes and mind were opened to unschooling and has embraced it with a <br/>
passion matching his passion for orchestral music!<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend you get him to a group of unschooling children and <br/>
parents.  Seeing is believing.  Of course, this only works if he has a good <br/>
example of school kids to contrast the unschooling kids to.  We have nieces <br/>
and nephews and a block with 38 kids.  Lots of comparisons.  Our kids are <br/>
young and we had witnessed three nephews completely change personalities once <br/>
they went to preschool.  Could be their personalities would have changed <br/>
anyway, but I was unwilling to take the risk.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961549896">I am often convinced that it is our kids themselves who are the best <br/>
&quot;arguments&quot; for unschooling, and for homeschooling in general. My 12 yo <br/>
dd was in a community theatre production this past weekend of The Wizard <br/>
of Oz. There were three other homeschooling families in addition to ours <br/>
represented in the production - one teen, one family of three children, <br/>
and the Wicked Witch herself is a homeschooling mom. At the cast party, <br/>
I overheard the mom of the three kids talking about homeschooling so I <br/>
joined the discussion. My friend is a (recently) former fund. xtian, and <br/>
they still use a very structured form of homeschooling, but no longer <br/>
cons. xtian curriculum. Together, we were talking to two couples who <br/>
were interested in learning about homeschooling *because* of the kids - <br/>
they were so impressed by the kids, so stunned to learn that they <br/>
homeschool, that they wanted to learn more. Both my friend and I <br/>
presented, together, why homeschooling was great, and how easy it is to <br/>
fit it to your kids and your family - and our two families being very <br/>
different being a perfect example. One man was so impressed, that he <br/>
came and found us later to ask more questions.<br/>
<br/>
So, to make a short story long, yes, seeing other kids and families is, <br/>
imho, a great way to show that unschooling/homeschooling works.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

What music is he interested in?  (Oh.  Orchestral, you said later.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been missing my Wednesday night music practice, but we resume next week <br/>
here.  We&#39;re doing medieval and Renaissance instrumental music with no plan <br/>
for performance.  I&#39;m willing to perform, but two members are shy and only <br/>
want to play for our own enjoyment.  We&#39;re using mostly recorders and cello, <br/>
but some keyboard (I have a little pump organ).  The cellist has a hurdy <br/>
gurdy which has lately been repaired (he fell on ice with it), and one member <br/>
wants to borrow a little harp I have and get it restrung and play with it <br/>
some.<br/>
<br/>
I keep just wanting to sing, and since some of the pieces we have are also <br/>
vocal pieces, sometimes I get my way when I say &quot;Let&#39;s Just SING IT!&quot;  One of <br/>
the pieces are &quot;Blow Thy Horne, Hunter,&quot; which is a three-part arrangment of <br/>
a double-entendre song which sounds to be about deerhunting, but is on the <br/>
second level about sexual encounters.  One is &quot;Never Weather-Beaten Sail&quot; <br/>
which is a madrigal which I think was once a solo voice with lute <br/>
accompaniment.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I highly recommend you get him to a group of unschooling children and <br/>

I AGREE.<br/>

     I haven&#39;t read through the archives yet so I will try that.  Thanks.<br/>
     As far as getting him to a state conference, the only one I know for <br/>
Indiana is the Christian conference in Indianapolis.  He agreed to go, if I <br/>
want him to, but it is very school-at-home oriented.  The speakers and <br/>
everything tend to be people from that mindset.  So I don&#39;t think it will do <br/>
any good.  <br/>
      The only unschooling conferences that I can find seem to be very far <br/>
away.  I haven&#39;t found one close enough yet.  My husband doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
drive over 8 hours to go to a 2 day conference.  Neither one of us has ever <br/>
flown (not sure we can afford it), although we both agreed the other day that <br/>
we would love to do so sometime.<br/>
      Also, as far as getting him around other local unschoolers like you <br/>
mentioned, I haven&#39;t found any in my area at all.  I have been looking for <br/>
eight years!  Of course, there may be some hiding in the woodwork (since this <br/>
area is so condemning of unschoolers).  I have no idea how to find them <br/>
though  :-(<br/>

like a good group - and an un-performing, unschooling kind of attitude!<br/>
<br/>
The night before the morning I broke my ankle, we went to our first concert <br/>
(Chicago Symphony Orchestra) of the season.  We are in the cheap seats, which <br/>
involve a VERY steep climb down stairs in the gallery.  I&#39;m not sure when <br/>
I&#39;ll be able to do that again, crutches or not!<br/>
<br/>
My husband is currently out of town, but I emailed him about the reluctant <br/>
husband issue.  He said that the only way he ever would have felt comfortable <br/>
was to go out and meet real life unschoolers.  Both his parents were <br/>
teachers, his father was a pastor as well. It was a real leap out of his <br/>
comfort zone - both the open house and conference (we tend to be wallflowers) <br/>
and the change in thinking.  Now that he&#39;s seen his own four year old <br/>
passionately describe the difference between pilliated (can&#39;t figure out how <br/>
to spell that while lying on my head) and red-bellied woodpeckers, he&#39;s a <br/>
complete convert.<br/>

I forgot where you live when I wrote my first message.  You could come to the <br/>
conference in Illinois put on by HOUSE (Home Oriented Unique Schooling <br/>
Experience, I think).  Except it&#39;s always up here near Chicago, or west of <br/>
it, and it was canceled this year because of facility and capacity problems.<br/>
<br/>
I found a site googling one day that listed Unschoolers in various states and <br/>
you could add your name and contact information to it if you ever wanted to <br/>
be contacted.  I bookmarked it, but sadly can&#39;t make it upstairs to the real <br/>
computer to get it for you.  The laptop is modem based and ties up our phone <br/>
line.  You could try searching in Illinois and Indiana, there might be folks <br/>
somewhere close.  Or at least not too far.<br/>
<br/>
People these days, and maybe just around here, tend to assume you are a <br/>
fundamentalist if you homeschool.  But one look at me and they go to that <br/>
other stereotype - the crunch granola one!  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry my suggestion wasn&#39;t more helpful to you.  You certainly are in a <br/>

    Thanks.  Chicago is still a good distance away, but I may have to just <br/>
drive that far to get to one.  I will still look for Unschoolers in my area.  <br/>
I have looked on google, but so far I haven&#39;t found any.  I won&#39;t give up yet <br/>
though.  I just have to fight for computer time with my four kids and my <br/>
husband, so I don&#39;t always have the time to look.  Sometimes I wait until my <br/>
20 year old goes to bed and I get on between Midnight and 2:00 am.  Sometimes <br/>
I get up early.  Not often though, because I am NOT a morning person. :-)<br/>
     Yes, people assume you are a fundamentalist if you homeschool.  But I <br/>
thought I was one too, until I found out that we were different in doing <br/>
Halloween, watching and reading Harry Potter, playing Magic cards and Pokemon <br/>
(not to mention D&D), unschooling, and many other things.  Blew me away!  I <br/>
am just now realizing that I am not a fundamentalist at all!<br/>
