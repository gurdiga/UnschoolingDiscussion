Thank-you for sharing that. I am so sorry about the loss of your son. You are <br/>
so right, our son does not deserve my energy being spent on feeling guilty. <br/>
It&#39;s hard as you very well know to get past these issues. You&#39;ve really made <br/>
me look at things a bit more differently by sharing your story. We came very <br/>
close to loosing our son in an accident. I am very grateful that he is here <br/>
with us today. That is what I should be focussed on....today. Yes, I have <br/>
told our son everything that I feel and how sorry I am. He tells me that it <br/>
is okay because no one is perfect and we all make mistakes. Thank-you Joanna, <br/>
you don&#39;t know how much your story has opened my eyes. I need to move forward.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Have you told your ds all of this?<br/>
<br/>
I think that helps.  My older two got the brunt of my ignorance.  <br/>
<br/>
They were 7 and 4 before I started coming around and learning about <br/>
<br/>
respectful parenting.  I told my son Sam last year that I wanted to <br/>
<br/>
apologize for being not so nice to him, as a toddler, some of the <br/>
<br/>
time. (forced naps, time outs, hurting him with a spank or grab of <br/>
<br/>
the arm...all kinds of miserable things).  I needed to tell him <br/>
<br/>
because I had been worse to him than my dd, who didn&#39;t push my <br/>
<br/>
buttons quite as much.  <br/>
<br/>
Sam and I were both stubborn and butted heads quite often.  We still <br/>
<br/>
argued and didn&#39;t see eye to eye quite a bit, but we had come a long <br/>
<br/>
way towards respecting each other and I was really starting to feel <br/>
<br/>
good about the progress I had made in being more patient and <br/>
<br/>
respectful of him.  He died on Jan. 19 of this year.  He fell through <br/>
<br/>
the ice on a lagoon at a park while there with another family. One of <br/>
<br/>
the things that helps me cope, is remebering how much I strived to <br/>
<br/>
make our relationship better and how I knew, he knew how much I love <br/>
<br/>
him, because of it.  I also feel very fortunate to have found <br/>
<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Sam was 8 (almost 9), and he spent his day finding his joy.  No time <br/>
<br/>
wasted in school all day.  No time wasted doing meaningless <br/>
<br/>
worksheets to make me feel better.  Infact, not having to think about <br/>
<br/>
schooling him gave us all the more time to work on being together <br/>
<br/>
peacefully.  Everyone who knew him described him as joyful.  He <br/>
<br/>
relished life (sometimes with more energy than I could handle).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll always regret the times I could have been a WAY better mom with <br/>
<br/>
him, but I try to avoid remorse because I know I saw the error of my <br/>
<br/>
ways and strived to do better.  That&#39;s all we can ask of ourselves.  <br/>
<br/>
Energy spent feeling guilty is not going to help you to be the best <br/>
<br/>
of you.  Your son deserves that.  <br/>
<br/>
I know my kids do.<br/>
