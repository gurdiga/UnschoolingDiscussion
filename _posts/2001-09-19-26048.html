 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is <br/>

 </span></blockquote>in the <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually it wasn&#39;t my thinking about whether ps was good or bad that<br/>
changed, it was more that ps is not what I remember from my childhood. <br/>
My beliefs about WHAT it is changed, not my beliefs about education. <br/>
Maybe I was just in the world&#39;s best school, or maybe things have really<br/>
changed that much, I don&#39;t know.  All I do know for sure is that there<br/>
were things happening that would not have happened at my old school back<br/>
then. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not yet, but I keep hoping that when people are done telling me how wrong<br/>
I am and calling us dysfunctional and telling me they would be depressed<br/>
if they were my kid, there will be something useful.  Although, I&#39;m<br/>
beginning to wonder.  I can&#39;t even offer a benign bit of advice without<br/>
six people jumping in telling me that it won&#39;t work or that it will<br/>
irritate kids.<br/>
I didn&#39;t have to let go because I wasn&#39;t holding on in the first place. <br/>
That was actually a problem with the school thing.  I was somewhat less<br/>
than helpful (from the teachers point of view) when I told my kids their<br/>
homework was ridiculous and they didn&#39;t have to do it.<br/>
I do think that part of the misunderstanding stems from the fact that<br/>
when I say &quot;Have to write&quot; to you what I say to my kids is, &quot;you could<br/>
maybe write&quot;.  When I say &quot;job list&quot; it is organizational not assignment<br/>
from me.  I tend to overstate the requirement factor out of habit.  (I&#39;ve<br/>
had enough visits from CPS, thanks.)  <br/>

to you for suggesting it.<br/>

Ones that really make me cringe are Read 30 minutes a day, and read every<br/>

been forcing my daughter to sit through books at 2 when she had *no*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459641438">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I came back from a few days away to find Helen&#39;s post. I am saddened because <br/>
although Helen post rarely, her posts are filled with such down home good <br/>
advice and I always am glad to see her addy in my box. I also appreciate the <br/>
connection to HEM because it really is a good homeschooling magazine amongst <br/>
some that are horrible (of course my opinion). <br/>
<br/>
I have read most of the posts from the past several days. I understand <br/>
people&#39;s concerns . . both newbies and veterans, at least as best I can. The <br/>
bickering back and forth that has been going on has got to stop. The constant <br/>
&quot;pissing match&quot; (I forgot who said that but I agree with it) is over. The <br/>
appalling rudeness towards HEM and Helen will not be tolerated. Those things <br/>
ought to be pretty clear. Yes, an introductory letter is a good idea and one <br/>
we are working on. We (as moderators) have been trying to be as unobtrusive <br/>
as possible, but clearly that is not working. We are back to square one it <br/>
seems. It seems apparent that long standing old sores are being opened back <br/>
up again. It doesn&#39;t seem to me that this is the way to create community that <br/>
supports unschooling and helps people coming in as well as those who have <br/>
been around to learn and grow in this journey. <br/>
<br/>
Cindy and I will be discussing ways in which to make this community work <br/>
better for all of us. More than likely we will have a panel of a couple of <br/>
people that we choose helping us to do that. Thanks to all of you who are <br/>
making the effort to make this list a vibrant and healthy discussion of <br/>
unschooling, and thanks for bearing with us through this challenging phase.<br/>

<br/>
While you are considering things, please consider this.  I believe the <br/>
person who mentioned the magazine was questioning whether the silence <br/>
of Helen implied support for Sandra and her way of expressing herself <br/>
here.  Yes, it was a little vehement but I believe it was followed <br/>
shortly by an apology, if I&#39;m not mistaken.<br/>
<br/>
I think perhaps it needs to be made clear that a magazine considers <br/>
articles for publication based mostly on what the specific article <br/>
says and not so much on the personality (or e-persona) of the writer.<br/>
<br/>
I think Helen may have done the right thing in disassociating HEM from <br/>
this list.  It simply is not possible to censor a forum such as this <br/>
in a way that would not look bad for HEM.  And to leave it free does <br/>
imply (to some) that HEM endorses what is said.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just wanted you to have my .02 while pondering.<br/>

No, there was not an apology. To be sure, I went back and checked. <br/>

 &lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

Some magazines may do that. Others don&#39;t. I am not sure how HEM does it.<br/>

be involved once things get straightened out here and she is comfortable <br/>
doing so. I trust that people are smart enough to understand that people are <br/>
individuals and have different opinions and styles and can figure things out. <br/>
<br/>
As I said, any malignment of any kind towards HEM will not be tolerated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, okay. :::deep breath::: I need to address this issue, and I think <br/>
I should do it now instead of at my convenience.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the part I need to address was the business of whether or <br/>
not Home Education Magazine endorsed everything written by the people <br/>
who write for us as columnists (I&#39;m assuming there was no tremendous <br/>
leap to everyone who writes or works for us in any capacity). Truth <br/>
be told, there are times when I doubt if what *I* write would be <br/>
*endorsed* by &quot;the magazine,&quot; and &quot;the magazine,&quot; such as it is, is <br/>
in reality just me and Mark. How&#39;s that for convoluted?<br/>
<br/>
I disagree with myself at times, like when I unsubbed from this list <br/>
in a hissy fit. Does that reflect HEM policy? Geez, I hope not! I&#39;m <br/>
sure it raised eyebrows from those who aren&#39;t familiar with our <br/>
publication (what kind of magazine do they produce, anyway?), but <br/>
we&#39;ve always tried to level with our readership; we&#39;re just <br/>
homeschooling parents who happen to do this for a living. We&#39;re <br/>
pretty normal. If magazine publishers are supposed to be held to some <br/>
higher calling, stuck up on a pedestal and held out as an example, <br/>
well... sorry folks. Not this one. Judge me all you want, but don&#39;t <br/>
judge our magazine by what I might say or write or do - it&#39;s the sum <br/>
total of dozens of peoples&#39; efforts, not just mine. I try to be <br/>
responsible, to not embarrass my colleagues and co-workers, but we&#39;ve <br/>
all seen how well I do that on this list. (Yeah, there was a lot of <br/>
&quot;YOU DID WHAT?&quot; at the office this week... &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I think the other question related to criticizing HEM. As far as I&#39;m <br/>
concerned, that&#39;s not taboo. If someone thinks we need an upbraiding, <br/>
so be it. We&#39;re pretty thick-skinned; we&#39;ve survived the publishing <br/>
business for over 20 years now and as John Holt wrote to us after our <br/>
first issue: &quot;That&#39;s a tough row to hoe.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Deliberate attempts at damage&quot; are serious matters. We&#39;ve been down <br/>
that road, and we don&#39;t take them lightly. Questioning policies, <br/>
commenting unkindly, posting &quot;digs&quot; and such are relatively minor <br/>
infractions, and we recognize them for what they are. We take them <br/>
seriously, but in the same way we take seriously the letters from <br/>
irate subscribers wanting to know why their issue arrived torn and <br/>
mutilated (the post office did it, not us!) or people who&#39;ve never <br/>
subscribed by get ugly because we finally tell them we&#39;re not going <br/>
to send their umpteenth &quot;free sample issue.&quot; (Yeah, we really get <br/>
both complaints. Tough row to hoe, remember?)<br/>
<br/>
There are *many* other posts I&#39;d love to address right now as well, <br/>
but if I don&#39;t get my butt out the door the boat&#39;s gonna leave <br/>
without me. Literally. Ciao!<br/>

Thank you for this well written post.  I think it answered the <br/>
questions that were being asked. <br/>
<br/>
Hope you had fun sailing!!!<br/>

listowner. Yahoo sure doesn&#39;t make these things easy or convenient...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for writing that, Ren. Makes it easier to sit here after <br/>
everyone has gone to bed and try to catch up with this list again. <br/>
Mark and I do realize that many people love and rely on the magazine, <br/>
the websites, the newsletters, the message boards, these lists... <br/>
that&#39;s why we&#39;re still doing this even though our kids have pretty <br/>
much grown up and left home. We&#39;ve thought about just sailing off <br/>
into the sunset (literally), but we&#39;re still enjoying what we do. I <br/>
still look forward to seeing what&#39;s been posted on this list and <br/>
others from day to day. I learn so much from you all! I wish I had <br/>
time to track the message boards at our websites as well, but one <br/>
cannot do it all, even if one wants to.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046329308">Okay. I&#39;ve spent some time this evening going back over many posts <br/>
I&#39;d bookmarked for reply, and most of the posts I missed earlier last <br/>
week. I started to reply to one or two of them, but decided instead <br/>
that I really need to go get some sleep. If there&#39;s a post or a <br/>
question someone would really like for me to reply to, please send it <br/>
to me (onlist or off) and I&#39;ll try to post a response as soon as I <br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
Our May/June issue goes to the printer first thing in the morning, <br/>
our son and his family head back to Alaska tomorrow afternoon, and <br/>
for the next two weeks I&#39;ll be right here, working on taxes and <br/>
scanning these lists when the number games start driving me too <br/>
crazy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have more I wanted to share, but as I noted above, I need some sleep.<br/>
