<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135167794">Light a Candle for Unity! Though terrorists may have struck out at us as <br/>
Americans, let us come together and show our unity. Let us show that though <br/>
our arm may have been hurt, they can not dim the heart of America which rages <br/>
bright. On Thursday September 13, 2001 at 10:30 pm EST, walk out your door <br/>
and light a candle or lantern to show the world that our spirit burns bright. <br/>
Place candle in your window. Gather with loved ones or gather with neighbors <br/>
but let our light burn in the night to show that we are united and that we <br/>
remain strong. Please pass this on to anyone you know..print it up and pass <br/>
it to neighbors who may not have internet access, post it to message boards, <br/>
clubs, news stations, anywhere and everywhere that there is a PROUD American! <br/>
