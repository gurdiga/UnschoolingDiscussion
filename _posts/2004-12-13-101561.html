<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149786939">Dear Live and Learn attendees,<br/>
<br/>
This is a hard letter for me to write, but necessary. After much <br/>
deliberation and looking at alternatives, it seems the 2005 <br/>
conference would be better off in a city other than Pensacola. I <br/>
have been looking forward to this and planning for months, so it&#39;s <br/>
really hard to let this go, I hope you&#39;ll all understand.<br/>
<br/>
Hurricane Ivan did so much damage, I don&#39;t believe Pensacola is any <br/>
longer the best location for 2005. Before I could get information <br/>
from the beach, I believed we could still pull it together. After <br/>
contacting the hotels last week, it&#39;s very apparent that nothing <br/>
will be resolved in time for me to put on a wonderful event. Several <br/>
hotels, including the Clarion, were so badly damaged they don&#39;t even <br/>
think they will rebuild...ever.<br/>
There is only one hotel that can handle our needs and it is <br/>
expensive (even by beach standards) and not interested in helping me <br/>
much due to their new monopoly. I don&#39;t think I can get anyone a <br/>
good rate in this circumstance and you all deserve the best.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly and Ben have agreed to host the 2005 conference in St. Louis <br/>
and will have details for you shortly. I plan to host the 2006 <br/>
conference here in Pensacola, which is really exciting, as it will <br/>
be the Live and Learn five year anniversary conference!! I promise <br/>
it will be an exciting event.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, please spread the word about next year and I hope <br/>
everyone will get on board in supporting Kelly by volunteering! I <br/>
will be in charge of the raffle this time around, so you KNOW I&#39;ll <br/>
be bugging you all.:)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for your understanding in this situation. I <br/>
know it&#39;s not an easy thing to change plans midstream, but I know <br/>
St. Louis will be very exciting and Live and Learn will continue to <br/>
grow and evolve as the BEST unschooling conference ever!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Ren<br/>
