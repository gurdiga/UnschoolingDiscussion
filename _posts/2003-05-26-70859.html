<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084262577">My 12 yo really wants to become a better speller. She has serious <br/>
spelling difficulties. She reads extremely well - even technical <br/>
material - can read out loud and pronounce difficult words she&#39;s never <br/>
seen before - so her poor spelling is not a result of weak knowledge of <br/>
phonics. She reads and writes a LOT - her poor spelling doesn&#39;t slow <br/>
down her writing - she just writes anyway and then gets someone to <br/>
correct her spelling later.  Her spelling is extremely poor, though - <br/>
she spells the same word different ways in the same body of writing, <br/>
she sometimes adds and often omits letters, and nearly always mixes up <br/>
the order of letters that should be there. In a sentence like this one, <br/>
she would have misspelled at least four words. Her misspellings often <br/>
are so far off that it is difficult to figure out what word she meant.<br/>
<br/>
Her poor spelling hasn&#39;t really been a problem until a couple of days <br/>
ago when she did &quot;Horsemastership&quot; testing at 4H and took what was <br/>
called &quot;orals&quot; - a test of her knowledge about horses. Turned out it <br/>
was not &quot;oral&quot; - they took four kids at a time and the kids had to <br/>
answer questions by filling in the blanks on an answer sheet. My <br/>
daughter skipped a number of questions, even though she knew the <br/>
answers, because she couldn&#39;t manage to spell them well enough for them <br/>
to be recognizable (there was some time pressure, too - she could hear <br/>
that there were a lot of other kids waiting outside to get in and get <br/>
their testing done). She got blue ribbons in the other four tests <br/>
(grooming, showmanship, equitation, and trail riding) and a red ribbon <br/>
on the written one - so if she hadn&#39;t had spelling problems, she&#39;d have <br/>
possibly had all five blue ribbons, which is quite a remarkable <br/>
accomplishment and she&#39;d have been really really thrilled. (Four blues <br/>
and a red is a great accomplishment too and she was thrilled by that - <br/>
but it does seem too bad that poor spelling played a part in the <br/>
outcome.)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, if she&#39;s at a loss as to how to spell a word, she makes a <br/>
list of a bunch of ways it might be spelled, and then she can look at <br/>
the list and pick out the correct one. If I give her a list - say I <br/>
give her &quot;flwer,&quot; &quot;fwler,&quot; &quot;floer,&quot; &quot;flowr,&quot; and &quot;flower&quot; -- she can <br/>
always recognize the correct one. This is nice, but when she&#39;s having <br/>
trouble with so MANY words, this really isn&#39;t a feasible strategy.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - this seems to be a very very specific inability to &quot;output&quot; <br/>
correctly spelled words.<br/>
<br/>
If anybody has any suggestions, we&#39;d love to hear them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
pam<br/>
<br/>
PS - I&#39;m going to send this post to a few lists, looking for help, so I <br/>
apologize to those who get it more than once.</div>

curriculum in their lives, even when using textbooks) so I got the computer <br/>
game &quot;Spell It.&quot;  They all like it, and it really did improve their spelling and <br/>
gave them a little more conficence.  Ours disappeared a while back so I <br/>
ordered another on Ebay and only paid 3.99 for it!<br/>

like, of how things are spelled, and why.  <br/>

My brother has a gizmo, it&#39;s a few years old, you type the word the way<br/>
you think it&#39;s spelled and it gives you spelling options for words<br/>
similar to what you typed.  It&#39;s a little hand held thing.  <br/>
If she can recognize the correct spelling when she sees it maybe that<br/>
would help her. <br/>
Maybe there&#39;s something better now.  <br/>
My brother has this same difficulty, but manages ok with a pocket<br/>
dictionary and his little electronic spelling thingy.<br/>
