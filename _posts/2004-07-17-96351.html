<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784880372">Thanks for everyone&#39;s input.<br/>
<br/>
We acted and she&#39;s got evidence that has been recorded at both the police station and the <br/>
hospital. One thing spoke loudly to me. She told me that until we acted, she had felt <br/>
paralyzed to act on her own behalf. Now she&#39;s ready to support the investigation and to <br/>
turn in her parents. Today, she feels optimistic about the future for the first time in years. <br/>
Makes me want to cry.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s with us tonight. CPS will begin the investigation on Monday.<br/>
