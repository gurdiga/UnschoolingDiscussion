 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve tried making jokes about it?<br/>
Have you tried holding out by not doing anything else for him or with him <br/>
until he picks it up?   <br/>
Have you tried just asking him what the deal is?<br/>
Has this just started lately?<br/>
<br/>
Were you spanking before and now you&#39;re not so he&#39;s celebrating?   (Are there <br/>
other factors you&#39;re not sharing, is what I mean mostly.)   <br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re out in public do you pick up other people&#39;s trash and comment on <br/>
how nice it is when people put their trash in trash cans?   Could you get him <br/>
to help you pick trash up in a park or somewhere?<br/>
