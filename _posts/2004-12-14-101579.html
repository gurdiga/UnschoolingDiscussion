<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278140589">From HSLD site:File request to acknowledge religious exemption with <br/>
the local school board chairman<br/>
<br/>
So what we have to file is a request for the board to acknowledge a <br/>
homeschoolers religious exemption to the compulsary attendance law. <br/>
We did check the laws here before moving. We are not required to <br/>
register with an umbrella school or even to refile annually for the <br/>
exemption. I didn&#39;t like the attitude of the superindendant&#39;s office <br/>
and my understanding is that they have no legal ground to deny the <br/>
exemption and wondered if anyone here had any personal experience <br/>
with this type of exemption.<br/>

<br/>
It would be better handled on a statewide list than an international list.  <br/>
I&#39;m glad there are people here who had some resource information for you.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For this list, let&#39;s get back to unschooling topics and away from state laws.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The statute for RE from compulsory attendence is separate in VA law <br/>
from the homeschooling statute.  Those who have been granted an RE <br/>
do not have to comply with any of the home education statute, such <br/>
as annual testing and annual notification.<br/>
<br/>
The local school board reviews the application for the RE and does <br/>
have the legal right to deny such exemption if they feel your <br/>
conviction is not genuine, nor is based upon a religious <br/>
conviction.  A philosophical or ethical objection is not valid for <br/>
an RE.  <br/>
<br/>
There is no deadline for filing for an RE.  You can file whenever <br/>
you have the letter ready.  In fact, some people never file for it, <br/>
citing the fact that to initiate contact ackowledges the very <br/>
authority that they believe the state does not have.  However, <br/>
because you have had a run-in with the police already, I would <br/>
suggest filing as soon as you have time.<br/>
<br/>
If you choose not to file the RE, then you have 30 days from moving <br/>
to VA to submit your NOI.<br/>
<br/>
There are many on the VAEclecticHomeschool list who do homeschool <br/>
under the RE (I am one of them).  In fact, filing an RE was just <br/>
recently discussed, and several examples of letters requesting an RE <br/>
were posted.<br/>
