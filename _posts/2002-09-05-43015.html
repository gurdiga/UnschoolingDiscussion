<div id="ygrps-yiv-895359993">I am so thrilled for my kids! I guess that sounds hokey. My 14 year old<br/>
is so excited about learning now that he is not in school. He and his 11<br/>
year old brother spent most of the day today chasing bees around our<br/>
yard, talking about them, figuring out that they thought they had caught<br/>
the queen bee (hairy) and what that meant, why they were eating a dead<br/>
mouse, that they have different jobs within the hive, how to smoke them<br/>
out and why, etc. We listened to Huck Finn on tape. The kids are so<br/>
excited. This after 9 years of torture from getting them up in the<br/>
morning swearing and running around the house so they could get away. We<br/>
are not public school people. Michele<br/>
