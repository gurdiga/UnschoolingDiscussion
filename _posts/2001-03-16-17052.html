<div id="ygrps-yiv-229894091">Thankyou to all those people who have offered encouragment.<br/>
A lot of the things I have already done/tried.  Like carrying on with <br/>
my own interests and leaving her to hers - this did work at first.  <br/>
Yes she is going through puberty - her body shape has changed <br/>
drastically in the past couple of months! I also think if I came down <br/>
to hard on TV she would become very stuborn - we have tried the <br/>
worksheets.<br/>
I have always encouraged all my kids to be independant - but house <br/>
rules have to be kept - Right now I am not sure if to just let her <br/>
be, or be the *Teacher*......... <br/>
Toni has written to the local TV studio for information on *makeup <br/>
artists* - we are still waiting for a reply.  Afraid she is not <br/>
interested in any grop activity like Guides - we have tried them <br/>
all.  And she is not confident enough to do volunteer work.....<br/>
<br/>
Again Thankyou.  I am going to gve a few ideas a go.....<br/>

<br/>
Do house rules always have to be kept?  If they&#39;re causing people <br/>
unhappiness, maybe the people&#39;s needs could outweigh the rules&#39; need to <br/>
exist?  (Some can&#39;t, maybe some can.)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s probably makeup artist stuff to be found online.<br/>
