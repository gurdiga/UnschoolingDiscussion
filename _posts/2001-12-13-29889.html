<br/>
When Helen decided a while back to go to moderated status on this list, she, <br/>
Cindy, and I  hashed out the detailes of list guidelines, which we post <br/>
periodically. It was decided to be a very general guideline, because <br/>
moderating and policing people is not something Helen is interested in for <br/>
this list, nor do I suspect anyone is. These guidelines will not please <br/>
everyone, but will hopefully encourage people to think a bit before posting. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-862527849">Okay, I&#39;ll give it a shot.  <br/>
<br/>
I think part of the problem is that some here are trying to create a <br/>
narrow definition of something that is not narrow in nature.  <br/>

Or perhaps are using a term to mean more than it does.  I think <br/>
Unschooling and non-coercive parenting overlap alot but they are not <br/>

<br/>
But I believe there are people from both sides of the argument who are<br/>
equally guilty. Some people from *both* sides want there to be a single<br/>

keep philosphical disagreements from turning nasty. Are you saying this is a<br/>
problem and we should seek solutions for when *any* one group decides<br/>
another should be silenced? Are you offering solutions that can be<br/>
generalized to *everyone* (not just those out there that one group perceives<br/>
as trouble makers.) Seems to me &quot;the expression and coexistence of diverse<br/>
viewpoints is encouraged and expected on this list&quot; pretty much covers that.<br/>

behavior? Do you have a suggestion?<br/>

The posts aren&#39;t prescreened so there&#39;s no way to stop someone from<br/>

Regardless of the trigger -- unless you&#39;re saying that was an example of the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668031681">And what has followed could only now be classed as hypocrisy in light of the<br/>
current thread.<br/>
<br/>
Two folks post that they like how the list is getting along better and folks<br/>
are making attempts at being &quot;nice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To paraphrase, others then jumped in and said that being &quot;nice&quot; sucks and<br/>
waters down the definition of unschooling to the point of ridiculous and<br/>
that some folks prefer verbal abuse.<br/>
<br/>
Then the same parties hop to the other side of the fence and start a thread<br/>
on rules for being nice.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The problem is not wheather we are discussing past greivances or not.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, one of the problems, for me and at least four others that I <br/>
know, is that people are saying things like, &quot;a few people were <br/>
overly sensitive and that&#39;s what has caused all the trouble here.&quot;  <br/>
But we are not allowed to bring up past greivances so we can&#39;t <br/>
dispute that at all.  We are not allowed to point out the posts in <br/>
the past that show that to be not quite the way it was.<br/>
So, either EVERYONE should stop talking about it or we should be <br/>
allowed to refute those statements.<br/>
<br/>
And here is another look at what I think is going on here  in general:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m beginning to suspect this is like the discussion between <br/>
Fundamentalist Christians and Pagans.  I actually came across this on <br/>
a Druid list a while back but I do see a parallel.  The Pagan <br/>
says, &quot;My way is good for me and your way is good for you and they <br/>
are both religions.&quot;  The Christian says, &quot;My way is the one true <br/>
way, therefore yours CAN&#39;T be religion.&quot;  Now, we can discuss until <br/>
we are blue in the face what characteristics make up a religion, but <br/>
when one group is absolutely certain that theirs is the &quot;one true way <br/>
for all&quot; then it is a pointless discussion and will just degenerate <br/>
into the Christians claiming that the Pagans are watering down the <br/>
meaning of religion.<br/>

be. But we can&#39;t expect others to follow our lead. They need to follow their<br/>
own lead, guided by their own interpretation of what the Reminder says.<br/>

We can&#39;t stop an initial post that causes an unintended (or even an<br/>
intended!) disruption. But we can try to clarify what exactly is a<br/>
disruption and what the reaction should be afterwards. Do you (Bridget) feel<br/>
the email reminder isn&#39;t enough?<br/>
<br/>
Can we have an unwritten policy that we &quot;be nicer&quot; to each other? Will that<br/>
work? But everyone&#39;s definition of nice is different. Some will perceive<br/>
others&#39; level of nice as &quot;not nice&quot; and therefore breaking the unwritten<br/>
policy -- which only those who are here and reading right now, will be aware<br/>
of. Should people in the forum jump on them and say &quot;Not nice! We&#39;re nice<br/>
here! So none of that nastiness allowed!&quot;<br/>

seen hypocricy be the spark that sets off an argument or even the fuel that<br/>
keeps it going, only a point that people perhaps reach in desperation when<br/>
they feel they aren&#39;t being heard.<br/>

Picture a suggestion as something to be sent out in an email reminder. (It&#39;s<br/>
the only tool we have besides banning someone.)<br/>

yet, including you Bridget. And I have no problem with that as we all try and <br/>
get clear about this &quot;new list&quot;. It is the administrative policy to try and <br/>
let these things work themselves out as much as possible, which is why Cindy <br/>
and I have tried to stay out of it as much as possible and let things work <br/>
themselves out. I think for us to jump in and start warning people every time <br/>
they break one of the list guidelines would be a bit hasty. Hopefully, as <br/>
everyone becomes aware of them and tries to adhere to them, the problems will <br/>
be less and less. I suspect this process of dialoging about the rules is <br/>
helping people to get clearer and more focused about how they will &quot;show up&quot; <br/>
on this list, at least I hope so. <br/>
<br/>
For myself, I think the suggestion of thinking in terms of someone in my <br/>
living room and having a dialog with them goes a long way towards a more <br/>
respectful response. All I can do is change my own responses and reactions <br/>
and that&#39;s what I continually try to bring to the table. . . my own <br/>
reflections and feelings without blaming anyone else or seeing fault in <br/>
anyone else. Quite a struggle still at times for me, but one well worth the <br/>
effort.<br/>

left to the moderators to try to maintain that boundary.  (I must say,<br/>
though,  I can hardly stand the word &quot;nice&quot;......it just brings up ideas of<br/>
timidness,  people-pleasing,  non-constructive<br/>
non-discussion.....shallowness, I guess)  This may be a personal bias<br/>
against that word.<br/>
    I rather like to hope that we will be respectful.  That we share<br/>
experiences and ideas.  And,  yes,  that we sometimes get into thoughtful<br/>
and thought-provoking debates.<br/>
    I do think the e-mail reminder will be enough.  Perhaps I need to go<br/>
re-read it and check if I have any thoughts on wording or ideas.<br/>
<br/>
     I like the idea of people taking personal complaints off-list whenever<br/>
possible and trying to work out conflicts on a one-on-one basis.  However,<br/>
I suppose if one&#39;s posts seem to really bother a reader,  they may not be<br/>
able to resovle their personality conflict off list,  either,  in which<br/>
case,  I think thay ought to simply try to ignore or block that person&#39;s<br/>
posts.<br/>
    I&#39;m wondering about if/when a complaint or problem should be reported to<br/>
a moderator.<br/>
Like,  if a mamber receives off-list complaints arethey being &#39;harassed&#39;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878423074">I think the monthly reminder *was* doing just fine.  I think the list was<br/>
working at being more tuned into &quot;hearing&quot; what people actually said instead<br/>
of viewing the e-mails through glasses tinted by the past.<br/>
<br/>
The point about the irony was that the list was doing exactly what you are<br/>
now trying to do by drafting another set of rules.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestions would be that folks do some surfing and find out what the<br/>
rules of debate are AND, if they don&#39;t like the current topic/thread because<br/>
it is &quot;too watered down&quot; or &quot;doesn&#39;t have substance,&quot; that they start a<br/>
topic/thread that isn&#39;t &quot;too watered down&quot; or does &quot;have substance.  If all<br/>
they can do is snipe at other folks because they don&#39;t like the &quot;tone&quot; or<br/>
definitions or whatever, then it would lead one to believe that they are<br/>
only here to stir poopy, not to discuss unschooling.<br/>

us in stopping future sparks from erupting into wildfires?<br/>
<br/>
I have a different idea of what started it. In fact, there may be a *dozen*<br/>
different ideas among those who were here. If we were to hash it out with<br/>
everyone trying to prove their theory, what would we acheive at the end? The<br/>
truth? At what price? Would people know more about unschooling if we could<br/>
figure it out?<br/>
<br/>
We *were* all there. You have to trust that we&#39;re all intelligent enough to<br/>
be able to assess what we see and know that if we didn&#39;t see something our<br/>
minds aren&#39;t changed just because that&#39;s the last or most vocal theory<br/>
presented.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the goal is to figure out who is to blame and who isn&#39;t to<br/>
blame, but to figure out how to stop the sparks from causing an eruption<br/>
*before* it creates something that someone is embarrassed to have been<br/>
accused of starting. We shouldn&#39;t have to figure out the best way to clean<br/>
up after a wildfire if our goal is to prevent the wildfires in the first<br/>
place.<br/>

am not going to spend time going through the archives to point things out to <br/>
anyone. We all grow and learn and everyday is a new opportunity. I think you <br/>
missed the point of my post which was that we are going through a period of <br/>
getting used to rules on a list that has never had them, and it may take some <br/>
time before everyone follows the rules most of the time. I think that <br/>
continuing the discussion of who said what to who, who implied something, <br/>
etc.  on the list is futile. It is a dead end road in my opinion. It is <br/>
probably safe to say most of us have disregarded the guidelines a time or two <br/>
in this period of adjustment. We will continue to post the guidelines so <br/>
everyone can have a chance to get more familiar with them.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has anymore suggestions on list guidelines, please email them to <br/>
Cindy or myself and we will take them into consideration with Helen (when she <br/>
gets back) on the moderators list. Everyone&#39;s valuable input is very much <br/>
appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550697728">I don&#39;t know if the &quot;two camps&quot; can coexist fruitfully.<br/>
It seems to me, and I have not been involved in so many groups that I <br/>
can claim this as definitive but, it seems that a group is either one <br/>
or the other.  And when one side is the dominating voice in a group, <br/>
the other side feels stifled.  I can understand that, having been on <br/>
both sides philosophically.  The dominating side wants to keep their <br/>
voice and ideas, from being overtaken, by what they percieve to <br/>
be, &quot;not right&quot;, or not the ideal in their eyes.  <br/>
I&#39;m not referring to one side here, I see it from both.<br/>
I checked around on the Yahoo groups and saw groups that are more <br/>
relaxed about unschooling and what it is, to those who are pretty <br/>
definitive about what unschooling is. <br/>
Those groups can exist peacefully, if there is an idea of what the <br/>
majority wants; a general consensus of what kinds of discussions that <br/>
the group is suited for.  And unfortunatley, that seems to come in <br/>
one form or the other.  <br/>
So, what to do with this board?<br/>
It seems that each &quot;camp&quot;(and I don&#39;t like that ideas, but there it <br/>
is...) has found their own places, and are having discussions that <br/>
are meeting their needs.<br/>
Noone seems to be posting much here, because, it seems to me, there <br/>
is no feeling of what it is about anymore.  And there are other <br/>
places that make it clear, what they are about.<br/>
How can that be fixed?  Should it be fixed?<br/>
Maybe it will all blow over, and rebuild itself naturally.  <br/>
But, I can pretty much bet, if it does, there will be a dominating <br/>
voice, and challenges of that will happen, and the circle will begin <br/>
again.<br/>
