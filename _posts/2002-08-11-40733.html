 </span></blockquote>Let&#39;s go back to before recent posts. Let&#39;s go back to when you first<br/>
started posting here and I was amazed at your unschooling knowledge and<br/>
experience that you were sharing with us.<br/>
What has happened to the Ned Vare that I truly respected and admired for<br/>
giving out GREAT unschooling advice?<br/>
In the past week or two, it seems you have found your political voice here,<br/>
and I am really missing your unschooling voice.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t agree with some of what you&#39;ve been saying recently,<br/>
but what am I supposed to do with that information? How can it help me with<br/>
unschooling my two boys who are 9 & 11?<br/>
<br/>
You really impressed me with some of your earlier posts. That was the kind<br/>
of stuff I&#39;d want to print out and have on hand to give to my MIL when the<br/>
time comes and she asks &quot;whadya mean you&#39;re unschooling?&quot;. The old Ned is<br/>
who I&#39;m hoping to see at the conference to inspire and encourage me further<br/>
about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Will the old Ned please come back? I miss you!<br/>
