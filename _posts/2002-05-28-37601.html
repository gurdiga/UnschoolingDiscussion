 I&#39;ve always felt that curtailing our children&#39;s viewing habits, whether it <br/>
 be movies, tvs or computer games, looks and smells a lot like censorship. <br/>
 IMO, the evils that have and continue to occur in the name of censorship <br/>
 weigh much heavier than the evils of the &quot;product&quot; being censored &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you Shannon.<br/>
And assuming that kids will choose the worst stuff available, just displays a <br/>
lack of trust in them. Would we always choose porn or absolute garbage over <br/>
all the other choices out there? Of course not. People tend to choose things <br/>
they are ready for, interested in and comfortable with. Kids too....<br/>
Welcome to the list, it&#39;s great to meet you!<br/>
