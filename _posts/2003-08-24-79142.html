<div id="ygrps-yiv-342378223"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; One woman was asking me about unschooling and kept coming back to her<br/>
&gt; concern about retaining Authority over her children. What is with this????<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a big Christian thing among the conservatives.  I&#39;m Episcopalian, so of<br/>
course I can&#39;t quote you chapter and verse &lt;g&gt;, but the idea is that<br/>
children are to be subservient to their parents, and that parents MUST take<br/>
authority over their children.  Otherwise, the children will instantly go<br/>
bad and go to hell.  See, Satan is lurking right there, waiting to pull in<br/>
your precious children, the moment you let down your guard.  If your<br/>
religion mandates that you train up your child in the love and fear of the<br/>
Lord, failing to hold proper authority over your children could send you to<br/>
hell, too.  And lest you be laughing here, hell is no laughing matter.  It&#39;s<br/>
a very real and scary place for many of these folks.  So they take their<br/>
responsibility very seriously.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I want to be an advocate for unschooling, yet am not comfortable really<br/>
&gt; talking about it to these other homeschoolers because it seems to freak them<br/>
&gt; out. Any one else go thru this?  What do you do?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep.  I smile a lot at homeschool gatherings.  (I also avoid them...)  I<br/>
don&#39;t advocate unschooling, I merely exist and drive everyone nuts because I<br/>
do it &quot;wrong&quot; and it still seems to work, and God hasn&#39;t smote me yet for<br/>
unschooling.  I don&#39;t evangelize, but I answer questions when asked.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a little book called Christian Unschooling, Growing Your Children in<br/>
the Freedom of Christ, which you might like to read.  It&#39;s not very radical,<br/>
and there are things in it that aren&#39;t very unschooly.  But it does give you<br/>
some words and ways to explain unschooling to Christians.  I do also see<br/>
where many Christian homeschoolers relax after a period of strict<br/>
school-at-home, and try to be positive about any moves towards the more<br/>
relaxed end of the continuum, even if they&#39;re still not anywhere near my<br/>
personal definition of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I answer curriculum gripes and questions with some comment along the lines<br/>
of &quot;Ah, well, you know I can&#39;t help you with THAT, but have I told you<br/>
about....&quot;  Become a world-champion topic-changer, and people eventually<br/>
learn to not complain to you much!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, how do I get over this weird desire to buy school supplies every time<br/>
&gt; school rolls around?&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But you CAN (and should, I think!) buy school supplies in August.  Right<br/>
after all the kids go back to school.  The store aisles are quiet, and it&#39;s<br/>
all on sale.  Buy a couple reams of paper, some nice new colored pencils and<br/>
crayons, and a spiral notebook or two; they&#39;re always useful.  Stock up on<br/>
pencils and pens while they&#39;re cheap and buy some pocket folders at 12 for a<br/>
dollar.  Your house is stocked, and you can get back to the very serious<br/>
business of unschooling!<br/>
