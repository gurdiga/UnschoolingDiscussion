<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042323268">A few days ago I was DESPERATE for info anyone might have regarding<br/>
Croup.  The server was down though and I did not get any messages for 2<br/>
days.  I was wondering if anyone did respond to my plea and if anyone<br/>
did would they mind re-issuing me their response.  My 22 month old has<br/>
had croup about 4 or 5 times.  No one else in our family ever had it and<br/>
my other two children have been free and clear.  I know about the steam<br/>
or cold air trick but if anyone had something further to offer, I&#39;m all<br/>
ears <br/>
<br/>
We are all really sick now as a family...barking like dogs with vicious<br/>
coughs that don&#39;t permit sleep...<br/>
