<div id="ygrps-yiv-773233085">-=-=-People shouldn&#39;t try to unschool for free.  Seriously, having a kid in  school costs money, even a public school.  There are expenses.  Not  spending ANY money on things for a kid could be neglectful.-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think this needs to be repeated.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a homeschooling book about doing it (homeschooling) for free---or cheaply. Don&#39;t have the title here (and my computer&#39;s running at least minimally right now---I don&#39;t want to jinx it up by googling something. I&#39;ll get as much writing in while I can. Sorry!)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can certainly be done on a budget. And a tight one at that. But if you add up the amount of money that *would* go to school expenses and use *just* that, it adds up to a right hefty amount! School clothes (popular styles or uniforms---both costly! And we stay in our pajamas all day sometimes! &lt;g&gt;), lunches (that are often discarded) and snacks, books, more books, field trips, teachers&#39; gifts, endless birthday parties, project materials, paper, pencils,notebooks, backpacks, lunchboxes---the list goes on and on and on...<br/>
<br/>
Cameron was in a private school before we decided to stay home. The expense of having another child (Duncan) in private school was one of the factors that figured in to Ben&#39;s agreeing to homeschool! How in the world were we going to afford TWO in private school???<br/>
<br/>
We figured that with *just* the tuition alone (not to mention the above list), we could GO to the Alamo, we could GO to Vermont, we could GO to Europe, we could BUY an expensive camera, a new set of drums, multiple video gaming sets, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The same for college: at $200,000 for four years of college...well, I could afford to set each child up in a damned nice business! &lt;G&gt; I could buy a GREAT set of drums or buy him an internship with Steven Spielberg!<br/>
<br/>
I mean: that&#39;s a LOT of money!!! Think of what we could DO in the REAL world with that kind of money! WOW!<br/>
<br/>
But folks insist that without a college diploma.... you know the drill.  But then there are loans to pay off---and years to make up for!<br/>
<br/>
I can think of LOTS to do with $200,000 that didn&#39;t include a college education!<br/>
<br/>
But back to UNSCHOOLING and money. I think LOTS can be done without mortgaging the home. Lots can be done on a really tight budget. But the minimum amount you would spend just by sedning him to school would be well-spent on unschooling &quot;stuff&quot;---whatever he&#39;s interested in. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think unschooling should be looked at as a way to spend the *least* amount of money!<br/>

<br/>
I like to think that it is a way to *waste* the least amount of money -<br/>
since most of the purchases are stuff that is wanted and interesting.<br/>
