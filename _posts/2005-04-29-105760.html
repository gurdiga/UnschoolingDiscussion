<div id="ygrps-yiv-252677464">My 8 year old son would like some fun math sites to visit.  I couldn&#39;t find any in the links <br/>
section.  He is just getting into math.  They can be online games or explanations on how <br/>
to use manipulatives or homemade games.  We&#39;ve checked out the Family Math book <br/>
already a few times from the library.  He has been making a little math box and loves the <br/>
math section of the educational store.  We put all the math related stuff in his box.  We <br/>
have pattern blocks, dominoes, clocks, compasses, protractors etc.  We play uno and <br/>
made up dice games.  He doesn&#39;t really like any of the computer games we have gotten at <br/>
the library either.  <br/>

 <br/>
Some computer games are just animated workbooks.<br/>
Some of those are really beautiful or kind of fun.  In the beautiful  category<br/>
, Peter Rabbit.  In the fun category, Schoolhouse  Rock.    If kids like <br/>
them, that&#39;s fine.  Moms do need to  try to understand the difference, though, and <br/>
not condemn games in  general.  That would be like condemning books in <br/>
general because workbooks  are lame.<br/>
 <br/>
One overtly educational game that Holly thought was VERY fun (and a  lot like <br/>
Zoombinis) is Third Grade Adventure (not sure which company and it&#39;s  not in <br/>
the nearest pile, but I think it&#39;s The Learning Company).   So  after she&#39;d <br/>
played it all she could, she spent her own money on the company&#39;s  Fourth Grade <br/>
Adventure, which sucked. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Most of these are designed so that each activity can be messed around with in a free play mode as an alternative to the mode where the computer character tells you what to do and praises right answers.  A good feature.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I love about the Magic Schoolbus software--the totally free <br/>
exploration of it rather than the rigid sequence or pattern. There are <br/>
problems and puzzles to &quot;solve&quot; but there is also tons of stuff that the <br/>
kids can just play with, and my youngest has always loved them because <br/>
of that. He wants to play the older games but gets frustrated without <br/>
someone there pretty much playing *for* him. Not so with the Magic <br/>
Schoolbus.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300755655">My kids like the Magic Schoolbus software, too, though it&#39;s old and a<br/>
bit difficult to set up on our more recent computer...  My 3-y.o.<br/>

Putt Putt games are that way.  There are ways to earn money to get a new <br/>
