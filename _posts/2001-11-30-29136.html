please change the subject line on this so others can choose to follow it or not. I&#39;m just as guilty as anybody on forgetting to change subject lines but I think I/we should try to do.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

  This is getting difficult. Please reread what was said Bridget. She NEVER<br/>
  applied it to everyone. That is clear by the phrase &quot;the other&quot; meaning YOUR<br/>
  children. not everyones.<br/>

  &gt;No, it works for two out of three kids in this household.  I would not<br/>
  &gt;dream of trying to apply that statistic to the rest of the world.  I<br/>
  &gt;would only use it to say that it is possibly for it to work and for it to<br/>
  &gt;not work having experienced both.  What the percentages are for the rest<br/>
  &gt;of you is beyond my scope of knowledge.<br/>
  &gt;          Bridget<br/>

  &gt;&gt; Apparently, according to Bridgets response, it works well for two<br/>
  &gt;&gt; out of three kids. The other needs a different direction.<br/>
