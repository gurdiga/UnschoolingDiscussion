<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My mom is coming to West Virginia for a month, and I am thinking of asking<br/>
&gt; her to take Kelsey back to Texas with her for a couple of weeks as a treat and<br/>
&gt; an eyeopener (she definately couldn&#39;t do that if she were in school)  Any<br/>
&gt; other <br/>
&gt; ideas?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Stay up late watching movies, sleep late in the morning, and make a<br/>
different kind of pancakes for breakfast every day.  Go fun places OR stay<br/>
in pajamas and watch tv and play video games all day.  Get dressed at 2 so<br/>
she can go out and find her friends when school gets out.  Bake cookies with<br/>
her to take out to her friends.  Plan cool daytrips, find a pool that&#39;s<br/>
still open and go swimming or go to Berkeley Hot Springs for the day!<br/>
Invite her friends to take a day off school to go on YOUR cool trips.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great year!<br/>
