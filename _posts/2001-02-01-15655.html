<div id="ygrps-yiv-586558931">I&#39;m kind of hanging around, lurking.. seeing if the dust settles down.. so I <br/>
thought<br/>
I would answer this!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  however <br/>
&gt;  part of the unschooling belief is that all subjects in life are part of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  learning process etc and we are learning all the time. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I believe that too, that&#39;s why I said discussing all this was fine, but <br/>
NOT<br/>
to the EXCLUSION of unschooling.  I&#39;ve heard from about five different people<br/>
today that all emailed me to say that they were totally and completely ignored<br/>
when they introduced themselves.<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I am curious - are you from the northeast or another Metropolitan area <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(ie: <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Los Angeles, Chicago) because I think we tend to be more accepting of all <br/>
&gt;  kinds of ideas and types of people than those from more rural areas of the <br/>
&gt;  country.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually yes.  But I think it works backwards of what you mean.<br/>
I&#39;m from Bolingbrook.. a suburb of Chicago.  BUT... to be honest, I think I<br/>
was actually more isolated from differences there.  There were so many people,<br/>
that to stick to a group like yourself was fairly easy to do.<br/>
<br/>
Living VERY rurally in Colorado has now taught me to get along with many <br/>
different <br/>
types of people.  There&#39;s not a whole lot to choose from out here!<br/>
I have a wide variety of friends and we really respect each others beliefs, <br/>
even<br/>
if we don&#39;t agree with them.  Religion may be the only thing that seperates <br/>
us,<br/>
and that is really nothing in comparison to what we hold in common.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Email groups are usually about getting advice. So<br/>
unless you have a question people won&#39;t really respond<br/>
to your posts of introduction. People usually don&#39;t<br/>
respond if they agree with what you have to say. <br/>
<br/>
I think only one person responded to me when I<br/>
intro&#39;d. When I asked for some advice I got atleast 5<br/>
responses that related directly to my question and it<br/>
lead into a thread about other related issues. <br/>
<br/>
If you have questions.  Ask! If you have stories to<br/>
share. Share!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-129632062">The ap list I&#39;m on usually has a good number of people responding to every<br/>
post of introduction or other posts that aren&#39;t necessarily asking for<br/>
advice. I think it just depends on the overall mood of the list and how<br/>
closeknit everyone is.<br/>
