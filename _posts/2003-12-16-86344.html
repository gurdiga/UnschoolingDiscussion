<div id="ygrps-yiv-578721788">I have misplaced a Thinking Sticks order.  I think it was just a check in a <br/>
small envelope with a &quot;thinking sticks&quot; notation.  I know where it used to be, <br/>
and I&#39;ve had faith it will turn up, but I&#39;m losing faith.<br/>
<br/>
If it was someone here or if somone here has a friend who ordered some <br/>
lately, please write to me!  <br/>
<br/>
Very sorry.  (And now that I&#39;ve done this, the envelope will probably turn up <br/>
in an obvious place.)<br/>
