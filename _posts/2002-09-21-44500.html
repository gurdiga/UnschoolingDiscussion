<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336610247">How about just GOing to the meeting with the H$DLA lawyer with a list of <br/>
questions and showing all the other attendees where he REALLY stands? That <br/>
could be a lot of fun. &lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
How much money does H$LDA collect yearly from unsuspecting homeschoolers?<br/>
Do you guarantee that H$LDA will represent me if my homeschooling is <br/>
challenged?<br/>
How much time will H$DLA put into MY case?<br/>
What if I UNschool?<br/>
What if I&#39;m pagan, jewish, muslim, HEATHEN?<br/>
Can I get this all in writing?<br/>
<br/>
I think it could be fun and eye-opening to all in attendence!<br/>
I&#39;d go! &lt;G&gt; with bells on! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

&lt;evil grin&gt; I think you should see if you can find where a meeting is <br/>
happening, and crash the party &#39;-) Let me know what kind of answers you <br/>
get. LOL<br/>

Maybe I need to be more<br/>
confident in my understanding of the South Carolina  laws.  Uhmnm, just doing<br/>
some pondering, any insight would be  helpful.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Do you have a high school diploma? Do you keep a daily  <br/>
log/portfolio/attendance record? Do your children cover the following subjects:  reading, writing, <br/>
math, science, social studies? Are you registered with an  accountability <br/>
association? <br/>
 <br/>
Then you&#39;re covered,. And not only won&#39;t you need H$LDA, they have no  reason <br/>
to help you. <br/>
 <br/>
Third Option doesn&#39;t require testing or grading.<br/>
 <br/>
The only thing H$LDA is interested in right now in South  Carolina is whether <br/>
children can play on public school sports teams. <br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t waste you money!<br/>

I do have a high school diploma, I don&#39;t keep a daily<br/>
log/portfolio/attendance record (I have a journal I jot in several times a<br/>
month on things they/we do), I am registered with an accountable<br/>
association.  We only cover the above subjects through living... should I be<br/>
doing more?<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate everyone&#39;s input! I get the sense that the majority of you do<br/>
not belong to such a group and I do hate supporting their extremist<br/>
political agenda!<br/>
