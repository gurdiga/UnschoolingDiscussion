<div id="ygrps-yiv-497798268">My aunt sent me this online test to help you understand what your beliefs are.  I think she thought I would be a crazy christian like she is because she totally flipped out on me when it came out as neo-pegan.  I am not a pegan.  It shows that my beliefs are closes to that of pegans.  <br/>

Take the test here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.Beliefnet.com/story/76/story_7665_1.html">http://www.Beliefnet.com/story/76/story_7665_1.html</a><br/>
