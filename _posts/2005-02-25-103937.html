<div id="ygrps-yiv-992133175">From January of 03. My description of Abbie&#39;s journey from Tolkien to <br/>
English History<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*********************************************************************<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Now that I&#39;ve said that, I&#39;m thinking about my 15 year old daughter.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She is a voracious and very good reader. Better at reading than I am,<br/>
and I&#39;m a GOOD reader. Because I am a Tolkien fan, I introduced The<br/>
Hobbit to her when she was seven. She ate it up. At age 10, she read<br/>
Lord of the Rings. She read it again. She immersed herself in Middle<br/>
Earth, checking out books of artwork by various artists, writing<br/>
about the strengths and weaknesses in the different characters of the<br/>
book, and of course, spent lots of time online chatting with other<br/>
Tolkien people, and looking forward mightily to the release of the<br/>
movie. I let her &quot;pursue her interest&quot;...and she followed it into<br/>
Medieval Europe, and British History. She knows who William the<br/>
Conqueror was, who was King in Britain when he landed. She knows what<br/>
the people were called who lived in England before the Saxons came.<br/>
She knows all about Arthur and Gueneviere and Camelot. She has read<br/>
all of Shakespeare&#39;s comedies, and is right now reading through<br/>
Canterbury Tales...again. She walks around speaking in different<br/>
English accents: Scottish, Irish, Australian, Cockney, Liverpool. A<br/>
true Anglophile, and it started at age 7, with The Hobbit.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Does that description sound like unschooling? I didn&#39;t<br/>
interfere with this in any way, besides once in awhile reading a book<br/>
she brought home, so we could discuss it.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
********************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
this was posted about two weeks after I first started here, and the <br/>
rest of the post (about Robby&#39;s inability to tell time, and <br/>
my &quot;letting my kids do their math while lying in a puddle of sunshine <br/>
on the floor&quot; LOL it&#39;s making me laugh, actually.<br/>
<br/>
though one part of that post:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Ah! and herein lies the rub! *If* Robby pursues only what interests<br/>
him, he will be going from video to computer game, and back again to<br/>
the TV.&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
that is just exactly where we are right now! Robby plays his gameboy, <br/>
intermittently with RuneScape online, all in between various <br/>
Nickelodeon shows. He did go for a walk with me and Katie today. <br/>
First they had to decide who was going to be the Airbender, and who <br/>
the Waterbender, and then they talked about Pokemon all the way. <br/>
<br/>
hm<br/>
<br/>
How we do change<br/>

So, in addition to people who are against television and sugar and want to keep those things away from kids, there are people that think you should vigilantly prevent your children from enjoying a puddle of sunshine?!<br/>

(Let&#39;s get rid of all the killjoys and bring back hedonism! &lt;g&gt;  It&#39;s been so foggy and rainy this winter that whenever I find a puddle of sunshine I plot myself in it and really enjoy it!)<br/>

My kid seemed to really like Avatar, and watched the episode (the first episode) he recorded three times.  (A sign of high interest.)  Is there any cool-avatar related stuff, (books, games, webpages, whatever?) that I can offer to him to &quot;support his interest&quot;.  Action figures?  Comic books?<br/>
<br/>
(His interest in YuGiOh is pretty tepid and he really hasn&#39;t watched much other anime or read any manga.  It&#39;s not an area I know anything about... yet.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389495043">well, isn&#39;t the standard photo on the front of many different <br/>
curriculums, a picture of kids sitting at the kitchen table with a <br/>
plate of cookies, and all their notebooks open before them, they <br/>
smiling and doing their schoolwork while mom beams down upon them?<br/>
<br/>
I was pretty proud of myself, for &quot;letting my kids do their math in a <br/>
puddle of sunshine on the floor&quot; and for actually realizing that <br/>
Dominoes is MATH! woo! I was willing to let them do their math curled <br/>
up in an easy chair, but I wasn&#39;t willing to let go of &quot;math lessons&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I just laugh at my old self. I was even worried, back then, that my 9 <br/>
year old (then) wouldn&#39;t learn analog time. LOL Well, he might learn <br/>
it. Or he might have to *gasp* always tell digital time. Which, btw, <br/>
*I* have never mastered. LOL <br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC who WAS relaxed, back then. Who is now...almost <br/>
completely deschooled! LOL<br/>

analog time.  Other than occasioanlly leaving work an<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter is learning French this year, and has been doing just fine -- that is until they started with time. It turns out that the teacher is using clocks with no numbers, and is expecting them to tell time using the twenty-four hour system. My daughter who is 15 has never had need of reading an analog clock, much less one without numbers, and now in French. I explained it to her, and in five minutes she could read an analog clock using the twenty-four hour system. It kind of reminds me of when she was a child and she didn&#39;t like to tie laces on her sneakers. I bought her sneakers with velcro -- I&#39;m really not sure if she can tie a bow or not. I&#39;ll have to ask.<br/>

(There&#39;s also a sequel Golden Sun: The Lost Age that picks up where that one<br/>

I&#39;ve heard the term avatar a lot having to do with Hinduism. An avatar was a<br/>
human form a god would take to influence the course of human events. In the<br/>
Baghavadghita, the holy book of Hinduism, Krishna was an avatar. He was the<br/>
eighth or ninth human manifestation of the god Vishnu. He grew up to be<br/>
Prince Arjuna&#39;s charioteer. His purpose was to advise the prince that it was<br/>
his duty to battle his cousins. There&#39;s a good short summary here:<br/>

<br/>
Recently the term avatar is used for the little pictures people will upload<br/>
to represent themselves on some message boards that allow that. I guess it<br/>
follows since they&#39;re humans manifesting themselves into the cyber world ;-)<br/>
Unfortunately they make it hard to find information about other forms of<br/>
avatars with Google. You can try: &quot;avatar earth air wind fire&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The cartoon Avatar is actually American not anime -- so they may not be<br/>
quite as quick and savvy as the Japanese at producing products for it ;-)<br/>
Though it&#39;s the first American show I&#39;ve seen that actually seems to capture<br/>
the story telling of anime rather than just slapping big eyed characters on<br/>
standard American stories.<br/>
