CHILD OF WAR TAKES UP THE ARMS OF COMPASSION<br/>
<br/>
Tetsuko Kuroyanagi wears many hats: the author of the phenomenal <br/>
bestseller &quot;Madogiwa no Totto-chan&quot; (Totto-chan: Little Girl at the <br/>
Window); actress; television talk-show host; financial supporter of a <br/>
theater for the deaf; essayist; and UNICEF goodwill ambassador.<br/>
<br/>
The latest English-language edition from the Totto-chan output -- <br/>
&quot;Totto-chan&#39;s Children: A Goodwill Journey to the Children of the World&quot; <br/>
(Kodansha International, 2,500 yen) -- was born out of her field trips as <br/>
a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Children&#39;s Fund.<br/>

MOBILE PHONES SILENCE CHATTY STUDENTS<br/>
<br/>
Long gone are the days when students babbling amongst themselves plagued <br/>
university professors&#39; classes.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, students are now more likely to ruin a class by being totally <br/>
silent.                                      <br/>
<br/>
And, according to a shocking study by an associate professor at Konan <br/>
Women&#39;s University, quiet lecture halls are most likely the result of <br/>
students&#39; fascination with e-mailing from their mobile phones.<br/>

MORE WOMEN WANTED FOR EDUCATION BOARDS<br/>
<br/>
The Education Ministry has decided to seek a revision in an education law <br/>
that would require local governments to include more women and younger <br/>
people on their education boards so that a greater diversity of opinions <br/>
will be reflected in local education policies, ministry sources said <br/>
Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
Critics say that education boards are out of touch with school students, <br/>
as the bodies are dominated by middle-aged and elderly men.<br/>

IN PRAISE OF HELPING CHILDREN TO GROW NICELY<br/>
<br/>
[S]ome local authorities have begun to pay serious attention to the <br/>
effects of praising children, for example, by setting up a system to <br/>
award children for their strong points, not only for grades in school <br/>
subjects.<br/>
<br/>
The town of Kokubunji, Tochigi Prefecture, became one of the first <br/>
municipal authorities to reward children in this way with the passing of <br/>
a local ordinance on the issue 15 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Under the system, children up until junior high school are rewarded for <br/>
kindness, effort and voluntary activities as well as for achievements in <br/>
sports and their studies.<br/>

MOTHERS SHOW LITTLE HESITATION TO GET GRANDMA TO RAISE THE KIDS<br/>
<br/>
Raising children is still an &quot;impossible task&quot; for working couples. <br/>
Although the government has championed child rearing to counteract the <br/>
nation&#39;s low birthrate, the provision of public child-care services -- <br/>
notably, nurseries -- is sadly inadequate.                             <br/>
<br/>
Many working couples still rely on the &quot;parents&#39; network.&quot; Many younger <br/>
couples -- no longer nervous about the delicate &quot;wife and mother-in-law&quot; <br/>
relationship -- also show no hesitation in asking the older generation <br/>
for help.<br/>

PANEL CALLS FOR LAW SCHOOL SYSTEM<br/>
<br/>
Members of the Justice Ministry&#39;s council for judicial reform agreed <br/>
Tuesday to propose the introduction of a system of postgraduate law <br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>
The council has discussed plans to establish law schools that aim to <br/>
cultivate high-quality legal specialists in Japan. The proposal will be <br/>
included in the interim report that the council is to submit to the <br/>
Cabinet in mid-November.<br/>
<br/>
This report is a step toward the creation of postgraduate law schools <br/>
that would emphasize meaningful learning of legal concepts, as opposed to <br/>
rote learning. The new system will be designed to help 70 to 80 percent <br/>
of students who work conscientiously pass the bar exam. Currently, only 3 <br/>
percent of applicants pass each sitting of the bar exam.<br/>

PERFORMING ARTS SCHOOL TO SUSPEND OPERATIONS<br/>
<br/>
Nippon Kageki Gakko, a two-year performing arts school and the training <br/>
ground for members of OSK Nippon Kagekidan, an all-female revue troupe <br/>
that has produced a host of popular performers -- including &quot;queen of <br/>
boogie-woogie&quot; Shizuko Kasagi -- is to close for the time being due to <br/>
financial difficulties.<br/>

officials said.<br/>

PUBLIC, PRIVATE UNIS AGREE TO COLLABORATE<br/>
<br/>
A public and private university will collaborate for the first time in <br/>
the nation&#39;s history to promote student and faculty exchanges in the arts <br/>
and sciences, the Mainichi Shimbun learned Thursday.<br/>
<br/>
At the urging of Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara, officials at Tokyo <br/>
Metropolitan University, located in Hachioji, Tokyo, have made a pact <br/>
with members of Chuo University, a private college also in Hachioji, to <br/>
set up an exchange system in which students from the universities will <br/>
receive credits for attending classes at each other&#39;s university.<br/>
