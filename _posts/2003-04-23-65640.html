<div id="ygrps-yiv-296814355">A BIG thanks to all who responded about the navel piercings.  It is DONE.  <br/>
Took just a couple minutes, not a drop of blood and so far all is well.<br/>
<br/>
One of my son&#39;s girlfriends bled and bled when hers was done.<br/>
<br/>
The place was nice and clean, they had their instruments in autoclaved <br/>
packages, took their time, answered questions and were generally very nice.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not even red or swollen right now at all.  Probably helps that she <br/>
has/had a very thin &quot;lip&quot; of sorts at the top that they just stuck the <br/>
piercing through and not up in the tummy area like some of the pictures we <br/>
saw.<br/>
<br/>
We got good aftercare instructions ( just like the ones you all sent along) <br/>
and she is THRILLED with herself.  She is typically a big baby when it comes <br/>
to pain but not one grimace or tear from her.  It really must not have been <br/>
too horribly bad.  The lady said sometimes it is, sometimes it isn&#39;t, <br/>
depending on the skin type, nerves that are pierced etc.<br/>
<br/>
She had wanted to get it done in Myrtle Beach last month but her dad said <br/>
absolutely not.  Yesterday we told him &quot;we are listening&quot;  &quot;give us your <br/>
objections&quot;.  After the stammering and looking at the pictures she printed <br/>
off and reading about them, the only thing he could come up with was &quot;it <br/>
looks trashy sometimes&quot;.  Well, that wasn&#39;t an argument, that&#39;s an <br/>
observation, so today he &quot;blessed&quot; the decision and even took her and showed <br/>
it off at his office after it was done.<br/>
<br/>
I forwarded her the emails from you all so she knows how utterly important it <br/>
is to keep it clean and dry and healing.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all so very much for your responses!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, for the one who asked about my older daughter&#39;s tongue ring, she left it <br/>
in about a year she said, she changed it several times on her own, the first <br/>
time after &quot;loosing&quot; a ball while out on the boat and panicking.  She said <br/>
she just out grew it and never put it back in.  She said she also thinks if <br/>
she wanted to put it back in it would go, it&#39;s been about five years since <br/>
she got it done I think and I guess four since it&#39;s been out.  She had no <br/>
trouble at all.  She talked kinda funny when she called me from school, but I <br/>
thought she had a mouth full of food.  The dentist said there was a high <br/>
instance of tooth chipping with them but we never had that problem.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to those who took the time to reassure me and pass along <br/>
information!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358014226">This may be a little gross, so be forwarned. :-)     I just have to say, It will most likely NEVER be an issue, but I tell everyone I know who has taken out their tounge rings on their own. You can still get an infection. Because, if you had the ring in for a while the hole is still there, and is not closed all the way, because, when you took it out, healed tissue sealed to healed tissue - making an imperfect bond, food can still get in and may not be able to get out. This has happened too two people that I know, my brother - they caught the infection in time and he just got real sick. The other they didn&#39;t catch in time, the infection spread. But, I know of lots that have not had a problem. Most doctors will tell you that you should have the the hole surgically closed - re-coring the hole so that the tissue can can heal properly. At least that was what I was told, when I look into it, and that what they did to my brother, to keep infection from returning. Like I said, it most likely will never be an issue, but it&#39;s something that I tell anyone who has a tounge ring. Most people don&#39;t realize how dangerous a tounge piercing can be, and I think that you need to be informed. Rebecca<br/>
