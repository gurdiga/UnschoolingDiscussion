 </span></blockquote>Hello Nicole and welcome to the list. Glad you&#39;re going to stick around even through the tough times :-)<br/>
I&#39;d HIGHLY recommend the Miquan Math program with the cuisennaire rods. Go to Key Curriculum Press for all the details but it&#39;s very inexpensive, last forever and is fantastic at teaching the mathematical concepts rather than rote memorization of &#39;do this first, then do that next&#39;. <br/>

stop watches, grocery stores.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Mortensen! I think if you see it as no more important than the<br/>
&quot;manipulatives&quot; I mentioned and are comfortable with your kids playing with<br/>
the program for 5 mintues and then never touching it again, and you have<br/>
some disposable cash, then you should get it ;-) If you think of Mortensen<br/>
as a way to learn math you&#39;re going to be disappointed unless your kids<br/>
think it&#39;s the bees knees and do it the &quot;right&quot; way. If, on the other hand,<br/>
you know they will learn math from living life -- and you learn to recognize<br/>
it in real life! :-) -- then it&#39;s just another thing to goof around with, as<br/>
important in the great scheme of things as dice with more than 6 sides.<br/>
(They&#39;re cool and nifty but no child&#39;s understanding of math depends on<br/>
them.) So, of course, why spend the money! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I think *the* most important tool you can learn to use with your kids is how<br/>
to do math in your head. Problem solve out loud when you&#39;re trying to figure<br/>
out something. For instance to add 25+17 you can say it&#39;s 20+10 and 5+7. Or<br/>
take 3 from the 25 to get 17 up to 20 so it&#39;s 20+22. Avoid doing math on<br/>
paper because it&#39;s way too abstract while kids are still figuring out how<br/>
numbers work and sets the numbers in concrete so they can&#39;t be changed about<br/>
and manipulated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And I&#39;ve recommended it many times over the years. I think it&#39;s *close* to<br/>
helping kids learn how numbers work but since it&#39;s on paper, it&#39;s still got<br/>
that abstract quality to it that won&#39;t necessarily translate to<br/>
understanding how it applies to things in real life.<br/>
<br/>
What it boils down to is that it&#39;s still a program. It&#39;s designed to get<br/>
kids to think about numbers in a particular way. *If* the kids are ready,<br/>
*if* they can understand numbers that are divorced from real life, it is<br/>
designed to help them discover connections themselves, but the environment<br/>
they make the discoveries in is still artificial.<br/>

  The only math manipulatives we&#39;ve ever bought were fraction circles <br/>
  and those we got because one of mine was trying to learn how to cook <br/>
  and couldn&#39;t get the fraction straight.  <br/>
  I think Lego&#39;s accomplish the same things as most of the rest of <br/>
  them.  I think they are useful for visual learners because they need <br/>
  to SEE the relation ships.  But I would not spend a lot of money on <br/>
  them.<br/>
