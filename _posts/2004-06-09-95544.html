<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409974757">There is definitely an aura that they feel slightly superior and view my unschooling being not so much dangerous neglect, but a crackpot experiment that will undoubtedly fade away once Jayn gets older and starts to need more teaching. I have no fear of this occurring myself! <br/>

I feel this vibe from people all the time.  Sometimes people -- often eclectic or school-at-homers -- say things like, &#39;I can&#39;t wait until her kids are high school age.&#39;  I heard that statement just last week from someone about an unschooling Mom I know whose kids are already high school age.  It came up when she heard where I live and asked who I know (by name).  I answered that her kids are already high school age, and it hasn&#39;t yet changed her positions on anything, at least not that I&#39;ve seen.  It was odd to watch her faical expression go from one of superiority to (I&#39;m not really sure how to describe it) confusion? surprise?  It was just a very strange and telling moment.<br/>

<br/>
Was it me? Was it me? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I went to college at barely 17.  So when I was the age Kirby was now, I had <br/>
finished a year of college.  Badly and in a panic.  It wasn&#39;t as easy as high <br/>
school.  I had an F in a class I just hadn&#39;t dropped out of.  I had some C&#39;s.  <br/>
ME!  I had plans to do better, having figured it out.  I was starting on my <br/>
college loan debt. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
What I had learned most from was the other people there, just having <br/>
conversations about where they&#39;d been, how they ended up in New Mexico for school, <br/>
looking at their stuff.  I met Persians and Indians and a large chunk of New <br/>
Jersey.   I worked with a guy from Taiwan (I think I was 18 then).   He was very <br/>
disdainful of my ignorance.   (And me a graduated-early hot-shot high school <br/>
student. &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
What I knew that year wasn&#39;t better than what Kirby knows now in any way.  I <br/>
was going to college with people older than I was who couldn&#39;t take a test, <br/>
couldn&#39;t write a paper, couldn&#39;t form an intelligent question (or answer), who <br/>
had only lately figured out New Mexico was part of the U.S.  (None of the <br/>
foreign students had that problem, only Americans who had gone to school in the <br/>
U.S.)<br/>
<br/>
So no, I&#39;m not worried a bit about a rich, free life.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve had lots of people say (in the past) &quot;so when they get to high <br/>
school they&#39;ll have to go to school, though, right?&quot;  &quot;If they want to,&quot; I would <br/>
say, and I would get that weird look, like they were s-l-o-w-l-y- trying to park <br/>
and process the idea of kids choosing or passing on school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137877418">My grandfather grew up in the hills of WV, and really was one of those<br/>
folks who walked (uphill both ways :-)  to be able to go to high school.<br/>
He boarded with a family in town sometimes. He worked and saved to go to<br/>
college, but had to quit because of WW2 and family problems. My dad went<br/>
to college, but didn&#39;t finish (until he was in his 40&#39;s). <br/>
 <br/>
I was the first one to &quot;have all the opportunities,&quot; and I did... my<br/>
parents paid for my 4-year degree, and I was the first on either side of<br/>
my family to graduate with a college degree, fulfilling the American<br/>
dream for our family.<br/>
 <br/>
My dad loves what he sees in my girls, and we&#39;ve had great talks about<br/>
unschooling. It&#39;s neat to see him accept that the next step in the<br/>
evolution of our family is the ability for my girls to choose *not* to<br/>
just go to college as an obvious next step of success... but that being<br/>
able to have them pursue their dreams might mean that they *don&#39;t* go to<br/>
college. What liberty!<br/>
