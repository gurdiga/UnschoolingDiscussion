<div id="ygrps-yiv-254750851">My husband and I have been pondering off and on the idea of taking in<br/>

We are former foster parents who adopted all 5 of our foster children.  In Maine you are not even allowed to homeschool a foster child.  They don&#39;t look at what is best for the kids, just what they think is &quot;right&quot;. Its the old - its my way or the highway.<br/>

None at all.  You&#39;ll screw the kids up for the next people who keep  <br/>
them.  They will have been so controlled and so arbitrarily run  <br/>
around that if you gave them an inch they would take a mile, and  <br/>
maybe your computer, most likely.  You would be required to follow  <br/>
the social workers&#39; recommendations.  And where would your own  <br/>
children be in all of this?<br/>
<br/>
I was one of two children.  My parents took in one cousin a year  <br/>
older than I am, and then another one a year older than my sister a  <br/>
year later.  It wasn&#39;t a great situation, and those were cousins with  <br/>
us permanently, not temporarily.<br/>

<br/>
No, especially when it&#39;s not your child, and you&#39;re under government  <br/>
supervision.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think it would be cruel to bring a foster child into an unschooling  <br/>
home, so that not only does she have to go to school, but she knows  <br/>
fully that others don&#39;t have to.  She would have homework when others  <br/>
didn&#39;t.  She would have to get up and leave in the cold while others  <br/>
stayed in bed.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t do it.<br/>

I did a lot of foster care of teenagers before I was<br/>
radically unschooling. I am positive they would make<br/>
the kids be part of the public school system, unless<br/>
you did kids who had already left the school system<br/>
and did it as an Independent Living Mentor. That is<br/>
help kids develop the skills they need to live<br/>
independently, which is a load of crap since as humans<br/>
we all live interdependently, but that is another<br/>
story. In retrospect I used a lot of unschooling<br/>
philosophy and thought for my teen foster care. I<br/>
listened and helped them chose and follow there<br/>
interest. I helped them chose and set goal and<br/>
assisted them in achieving those goals, and respected<br/>
them and encouraged when their plan did not work, or<br/>
their interests changed. I did not impose boundaries<br/>
as they had already had people controlling the crap<br/>
out of them and forgetting to respect them and really<br/>
hear them. I never to my knowledge had a child in<br/>
foster care steal or intentionally hurt me in a<br/>
financial or emotional way. <br/>
I agree with Sandra that it may be a real challenge to<br/>
have a kid that had to go to school  live in an<br/>
unschooling home. That is one of the reasons I do no<br/>
foster care at all now. <br/>
However I have many really cool young adults that I<br/>
was fortunate enough to be part of their lives when<br/>
they were extremely in need of someone to hear them.<br/>
They bring their babies and their hubbies to visit me.<br/>
I can for certain say that foster care was some of the<br/>
finest most important work I ever did in my life. <br/>
Feel free to write me off list if you plan to pursue.<br/>

I&#39;ve done much volunteer work with foster kids and families.  While radical<br/>
unschooling is darn near impossible, given the stringent requirements for<br/>
education the state requires, there is still much you can do to enlighten<br/>
the child, the adults involved in his life, and even the state.  I&#39;ve found<br/>
all foster kids to be starving for attention and the attention a respectful,<br/>
nurturing adult can give such a child is monumental.  It will affect their<br/>
life forever, and yours too.  Go for it!  Take one day at a time and know<br/>
that you are making a big difference in the way that child will see the<br/>
world.  It is a job  with many frustrations, anger and bureaucratic<br/>
bewilderment and it can seem overwhelming at times, but there is much to<br/>
learn.  I have come to see that all children are born equal:  full of<br/>
vitality, enthusiasm, curiosity, love, intelligence.  It is a world of abuse<br/>
brought on by adults in the form of parents, school teachers and others that<br/>
neglect and thwart the child&#39;s bright spirit that makes one dull, mediocre,<br/>
depressed, helpless.<br/>

Hi Andrea,<br/>
<br/>
You would be doing a great service to children if you decided to <br/>
become a foster parent. There is a need, in every state for families <br/>
to foster. Have you checked into it yet? <br/>
<br/>
My three spent 4 years in foster care before we adopted them. <br/>
Although they were in seperate foster homes the first year, they <br/>
were reunited in one foster home for the remaining three years. <br/>
Their foster parents were wonderful people who helped them through a <br/>
lot of rejection, hurt and trauma. I am forever grateful to them for <br/>
going above and beyond with my children. Our adoption was finalized <br/>
two years ago and we have kept in contact with them throughout. We <br/>
see them a couple of times a year and they&#39;ve become extended family <br/>
to us. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m trying to determine to what extent radical unschooling <br/>
 </span></blockquote>concepts might be able to apply to children in the foster care <br/>
system (who most likely will be required by law to attend school).  <br/>
Is there any way to &quot;radically unschool&quot; a child who&#39;s involuntarily <br/>
in the public school system?  Would a compromise of some sort <br/>
between the two be better for the child or worse?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They would have to stay in school until they were adopted. I don&#39;t <br/>
know of a single state that allows foster or pre-adoptive parents to <br/>
home/unschool the children. <br/>
<br/>
Even if you could, a lot would depend on the child. Unschooling is <br/>
about trust and trust takes time to be established. This is <br/>
something we deal with regarding my oldest. He is unschooled, <br/>
meaning he doesn&#39;t do school (he&#39;s deschooing, defostering, healing) <br/>
but it&#39;s very, very difficult to extend that freedom into other <br/>
areas because of the amount of trust on both sides (us for him and <br/>
him for us). <br/>
Many children in foster care (including my oldest two) have Reactive <br/>
Attachment Disorder. If you&#39;re going to foster, you should get <br/>
yourself familiar with it. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway....good for you for wanting to do this. My children are proof <br/>
that caring adults can turn a childs life around. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Barb, you said: &quot;all children are full of vitality, enthusiasm,  <br/>
curiosity, love, intelligence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known, very very well, people who fostered and even adopted kids  <br/>
- they were sure that if they gave them a great family life, lots of  <br/>
love, they would be able to undo the damage of fetal alcohol  <br/>
syndrome, for example. Not so. A lifetime of difficulty and heartache  <br/>
is what they did get. And the adopted children&#39;s siblings have  <br/>
continued to have to deal with the problems into their own adulthoods.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying people shouldn&#39;t do it - but that so many people go  <br/>
into it with such unrealistic ideas - assuming that all children are  <br/>
full of vitality, enthusiasm, curiosity, love, intelligence - and all  <br/>
they need is a little loving care. Those here who have fostered/ <br/>
adopted kids know the truth - Reactive Attachment Disorder is  <br/>
extremely intractable - and living with a child who isn&#39;t trusting or  <br/>
trustworthy is very difficult. Again - I appreciate and admire those  <br/>
who do it. I know some of the heartache and hardship they face. And i  <br/>
don&#39;t think those considering it should impose the risks on their  <br/>
other children - at least wait until they are grown.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, this is true of my oldest. He has come a long way but he will <br/>
never be 100% healed or emotionally or mentally healthy.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve known, very very well, people who fostered and even <br/>

<br/>
I know people like that also and it&#39;s shame. Children who were <br/>
abused need a certain type of parent. A parent who is naive enough <br/>
to think love will conquer all, is not what these kids need. Love is <br/>
part of it, but love comes later, after healing.   <br/>

<br/>
A prospective foster or adoptive parent should not take in kids that <br/>
are older than the ones already living in the home. No matter what <br/>
the agency tells you, I think it&#39;s a bad idea. <br/>
Children who have been abused, may abuse others and if you have <br/>
younger children, they may not be able to defend themselves against <br/>
them. <br/>

This is true of my middle child, Shawna. She came to us a very angry, <br/>
controlling, manipulative and abusive person. Her road to healing is <br/>
long and painful but she&#39;s a strong girl and her need for love and a <br/>
family is so great that she&#39;s overcome a lot of emotional issues to get <br/>
where she is today. She still struggles with certain issues but she <br/>
moves forward every day. <br/>
<br/>
Then there are children like my oldest, Cimion. He has such a thick <br/>
wall around his heart and he is determined to use whatever means he has <br/>
to not let anyone love him. He wil do whatever it takes to keep us away <br/>
from his heart. Unlike Shawna, when Cimion takes 2 steps back, he <br/>
follows it with 50 more backwards steps. The sad thing is he is so <br/>
sneaky and lies about everything but there&#39;s no need to with us. He <br/>
doesn&#39;t see that yet...he may never.   <br/>
<br/>
This is such an interesting conversation because it is our reality. <br/>
Thank you to the original person who started it and to those who have <br/>
participated. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-266243010">I would have to agree with Sandra on this one...unless those children <br/>
you take in as foster children are legally free for adoption and you <br/>
are intending to adopt them as your own. I am providing a very <br/>
relaxed homeschooling (could actually be identified as unschooling, <br/>
I&#39;m sure)for my children who began as foster children in my home and <br/>
I went on to adopt. There are some caseworkers who will actually <br/>
agree to &quot;home&quot;schooling, as even some of the most fundamental <br/>
caseworkers do recognize that some (I say MOST) children don&#39;t do <br/>
well within the public school system.....and this is even more likely <br/>
with those kiddos who have been bounced around from family to family <br/>
and school to school. My 8 yr old who had only spent 2 yrs in public <br/>
school has adapted extremely well to unschooling, whereas the older <br/>
one who attended a combination of private, public, and eclectic <br/>
schooling for nearly 11 years, is having a more difficult time with <br/>
the concept of unschooling....but she is &quot;getting&quot; it too! If only I <br/>
could have &quot;caught&quot; her sooner, she wouldn&#39;t be going through some of <br/>
the stuff she has....but still better later than never at all. <br/>
And I am in it for the long haul for these kiddos who are in my home; <br/>
they are mine now.<br/>
To reiterate again though, unless these kiddos aren&#39;t going to be <br/>
with you for the long haul (as in: the rest of their lives), I have <br/>
to agree with Sandra: it will only mess them up for their next &quot;stop&quot; <br/>
on their life journey. <br/>
Best wishes to you. Feel free to email me off list if you desire.<br/>

Their problems often subside with care and sometimes they even become<br/>
very healthy, active, etc. (not sure what the &quot;etc.&quot; includes.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Barb, you said: &quot;all children are full of vitality, enthusiasm,<br/>
curiosity, love, intelligence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known, very very well, people who fostered and even adopted kids<br/>
- they were sure that if they gave them a great family life, lots of<br/>
love, they would be able to undo the damage of fetal alcohol<br/>
syndrome, for example. Not so. A lifetime of difficulty and heartache<br/>
is what they did get. And the adopted children&#39;s siblings have<br/>
continued to have to deal with the problems into their own adulthoods.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying people shouldn&#39;t do it - but that so many people go<br/>
into it with such unrealistic ideas - assuming that all children are<br/>
full of vitality, enthusiasm, curiosity, love, intelligence - and all<br/>
they need is a little loving care. Those here who have fostered/<br/>
adopted kids know the truth - Reactive Attachment Disorder is<br/>
extremely intractable - and living with a child who isn&#39;t trusting or<br/>
trustworthy is very difficult. Again - I appreciate and admire those<br/>
who do it. I know some of the heartache and hardship they face. And i<br/>
don&#39;t think those considering it should impose the risks on their<br/>
other children - at least wait until they are grown.<br/>

Some people have much more curiosity than others, even within the  <br/>

&quot;Intelligence&quot; is a much-abused word.<br/>

Wherever that leads varies from one person to another.  There is no such<br/>
thing as a perfect person or ideal qualities in a person.  We all struggle<br/>
with challenges in our lifetimes, and the damage done to a child who has<br/>
been abused has his own unique set of challenges.  It&#39;s a mistake to draw<br/>
conclusions from fear or from the experiences of others.  I had my children<br/>
born at home, despite everyone around me telling me how dangerous it was and<br/>
what a big mistake I was making.  I nursed them on demand despite those who<br/>
were certain they would be spoiled.  I did not immunize them despite the<br/>
horror stories of the diseases they would get.  I unschool despite the lack<br/>
of family support and community (no longer true, but was in the beginning).<br/>
I do think it&#39;s important to listen to your instincts, follow your heart and<br/>
do what you think is right, not what someone else tells you to do.<br/>

I know people like that also and it&#39;s shame. Children who were<br/>

part of it, but love comes later, after healing.<br/>

A prospective foster or adoptive parent should not take in kids that<br/>
are older than the ones already living in the home. No matter what<br/>
the agency tells you, I think it&#39;s a bad idea.<br/>
Children who have been abused, may abuse others and if you have<br/>
younger children, they may not be able to defend themselves against<br/>
them. <br/>

don&#39;t have homeschooling - we are private schools - very small, very  <br/>
elite, and very very private schools. So sometimes people just enroll  <br/>
their foster kids in their own private school and nobody objects.<br/>
<br/>
I have a neighbor who takes in LOTS of foster kids (way too many, in  <br/>
my opinion, because she has seven kids of her own and some are still   <br/>
toddlers - the oldest is 19). She homeschools all her bio kids up to  <br/>
high school (then they go to the local catholic high school). She  <br/>
doesn&#39;t always homeschool the foster kids - depends on the services  <br/>
they are getting at the public school. But she has homeschooled many  <br/>
of them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;One thing about foster care, is there has often been physical  damage<br/>
 </span></blockquote>or other issues at play you might not know about. My brother had  FAS,<br/>
something that happens in the womb and sometimes no amount of  nurture<br/>
can overcome that.<br/>
I think RU has the best chance for helping  those children heal though.<br/>
My brother got the whole Ritalyn, schooling  crap and whether or not<br/>
that&#39;s a cause, it sure was a contributing factor  in his life<br/>
today...which is all about prison at this  point.&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
We are foster parents, and have adopted 3 of our foster kids, and are in  the <br/>
process of getting full custody of our 10 yo foster daughter.  The  first boy <br/>
we adopted had/has FAS and RAD.  It was a big struggle at first,  but the one <br/>
thing that probably made the BIGGEST difference was pulling him out  of <br/>
school as soon as the adoption was final.  It lifted this huge weight  off of him <br/>
and us.  He just couldn&#39;t handle the stifling environment and  needed freedom.  <br/>
He was always in trouble at school, it was awful.  We  know he will never be <br/>
&quot;normal&quot; but he has come so incredibly far.  He&#39;s a  very happy, busy kid.  <br/>
His biggest joy is untangling things, finding things  no one else can seem to <br/>
locate, and &quot;fixing&quot; things.  <br/>
 <br/>
The other two boys had &quot;learning disabilities.&quot;  Since we took them  out of <br/>
school, that has changed, though one still struggles to read.  They  blossomed <br/>
once taken out of school.  <br/>
 <br/>
At this time, our two foster children are not bothered that they have to go  <br/>
to school and the others get to stay home.  They do their homework if the  <br/>
want to, wear what they want to, go to sleep when they&#39;re tired, and do a good  <br/>
job ot if.  Our oldest foster son is about to turn 18, and will go to live  <br/>
with family.  So soon, we won&#39;t have to live by the school&#39;s schedule, as  when <br/>
we get full custody, we&#39;ll be able to take her out of school.  For the  <br/>
meantime, she&#39;s OK with it.  She has been in horrible situations, including  almost a <br/>
year in hospitalization, so live in our home has been the most stable  thing <br/>
in her life, probably since she was born.<br/>
 <br/>
I think a radical unschooling family can be wonderful for children who&#39;ve  <br/>
been in foster care.  They&#39;ve lived with so many rules, so much &quot;system&quot;  that <br/>
giving them a lot of freedom to make mistakes and grow from them gives them  a <br/>
chance to have a little control over their own world, something they&#39;ve not  <br/>
had in the past.  They were either controlled by abuse, or neglect, or the  <br/>
system.<br/>
 <br/>
Something else:  I&#39;ve noticed through the years, that many of these  kids <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;make it&quot; in strict, Christian or Fundamentalist homes.  We go  to Church <br/>
(Mass), but our kids have a lot of freedom, they can have their own  interests, <br/>
watch most movies, dress the way they want.  To look at our home  you would <br/>
never think we&#39;re religious.  In that way, the  unschooling/relaxed lifestyle <br/>
has helped these kids tremendously.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;If I were going to choose foster care or adoption, I would  be sure to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>only get children that were younger than my own children.  Messing up<br/>
the whole birth order thing ended up being really a difficult  dynamic<br/>
in our family.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I have to second this.  I would never recommend taking in a child  older than <br/>
your youngest.  The only reason we had the 17 yo is because we  had known him <br/>
a long time before he was in our home, and we knew his issues were  very <br/>
minimal, and he still has a good relationship with his father.  Still,  it was <br/>
probably not the best choice, and I&#39;d never do it again.  I just  wouldn&#39;t bring <br/>
a teen into my home, you just never know.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think Sandra did have a point.  To have a child for years and years  who <br/>
has to go to school while the rest of the family is having a ball,  could be <br/>
cruel.  But with us, we were always open to adoption so there was  a light at the <br/>
end of the tunnel for our kids.  After our 10 yo girl, we  don&#39;t plan on <br/>
adopting any more, so we are not going to foster.  Sending  children from home to <br/>
home is the most damaging thing foster care does to kids,  so I really suggest <br/>
only doing it if you&#39;re in it for the long haul.<br/>

&quot;hear&quot; in their words. Happens to me, sometimes, and it is good  <br/>
insight to look back and see what I said that caused someone  <br/>
responded as they did.<br/>
<br/>
I heard an extreme statement that, in my experience, is not at all  <br/>
true. There are many reasons why children end up in foster care - and  <br/>
it is really sad, but often they do have serious and somewhat  <br/>
permanent problems that the most wonderful loving home in the world  <br/>
can&#39;t repair. I don&#39;t think it is a good idea for anybody to go into  <br/>
fostering or adopting thinking that all children are full of  <br/>
vitality, enthusiasm, curiosity, love, and intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
But - back to unschooling foster kids. A friend of mine who fosters  <br/>
lots of different kids - she does short-term care while kids are in  <br/>
between other placements - actually does keep the kids out of school,  <br/>
usually, and she doesn&#39;t push academics on them during that time.  <br/>
She&#39;s not an unschooler - not with her own kids. But she thinks that  <br/>
during that relatively short (sometimes 3 weeks, sometimes 3 months)  <br/>
time that she has the kids that academics can be let go while she  <br/>
helps them sort through what is happening to them, let them have a  <br/>
respite from the massive stress they&#39;ve usually already been living,  <br/>
have at least a brief period to be treated well.<br/>
