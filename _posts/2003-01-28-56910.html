Don&#39;t you think that just the fact that your children are being unschooled will put them on the right track so it won&#39;t even be an issue?           I think so!    They are ahead of the game this way!<br/>
 <br/>
For those of us who weren&#39;t raised this way it is a struggle to fathom that,  but I&#39;m hoping that my kids will just continue to do what they love and it will turn into that wage earning thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think for many fields, and the ones above could be included, <br/>
college is very overrated. I think about my own passion of <br/>
photography, which is what I chose to get my degree in, and how I <br/>
could&#39;ve been better served by not going to college. If you think of <br/>
all the money I spent on college, and how little photography <br/>
experience I got out of it (because most of that money got spent on <br/>
all the other pre-req classse I had to take), I&#39;m sure I could&#39;ve <br/>
taken that same money, got myself a nice Hasselblad medium-format <br/>
camera, apprenticed myself to a really good photographer, traveled <br/>
around the world, and in 4 years I would&#39;ve not only been a much <br/>
better photographer, I would&#39;ve made all sorts of connections in the <br/>
world of photography, and would&#39;ve understood how to make a living at <br/>
it. As it was, when I graduated, I realized that I didn&#39;t have the <br/>
portfolio or experience to get a job in photography, but had all <br/>
these college loans to pay off, so I ended up using my minor in <br/>
Computer Science to go work at Microsoft. I&#39;m not unhappy with how <br/>
everything played out, and I really loved college and the whole <br/>
experience. I was exposed to all sorts of people and experiences that <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have been otherwise. But that doesn&#39;t change the fact that <br/>
for any given field there might be much more cost-effective (and <br/>
better!) ways to learn.<br/>
<br/>
As someone who used to hire in the computer field, I&#39;d say that the <br/>
college degree on the resume was what got somebody through HR and to <br/>
my desk for an interview, but people came there via other paths as <br/>
well - By knowing someone in the group, or having done something <br/>
impressive on computers on their own and gotten the attention of <br/>
someone. Once they were interviewing with me, I could care less <br/>
whether they had a degree at all. What was important was what they <br/>
knew, and there were plenty of people I interviewed with CS degrees <br/>
that didn&#39;t know anything at all! And people without who knew plenty. <br/>
So, if a person doesn&#39;t have the degree, they might have to commit a <br/>
little more time to figuring out how to get in the door in a job like <br/>
that, but doing an internship or apprenticeship can help. Or having <br/>
done a project that you can show.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I didn&#39;t have 4 years of math when I started in the CIS <br/>
(computer science) program in college. In fact, I didn&#39;t have a high <br/>
school diploma either (I left high school early because it was such a <br/>
waste of time). I had to take many of the math classes concurrently <br/>
with the CIS classes, and there were many times when I registered for <br/>
a class without having had the math pre-reqs, and just figured it out <br/>
as I went along, borrowing textbooks and such. A couple of times, it <br/>
caught me and I had to do some real scrambling to catch up, but all <br/>
in all when you want/need to know something, you can find a way to do <br/>
it.<br/>

My daughter (15) wanted to go to college, was planning on going to <br/>
college for a degree in Interior Design.  Our local college is <br/>
supposed to be rated one of the best in the U. S. for Interior <br/>
Design, according to one ratings list, so we thought that would be <br/>
fine.  But then one of her cousins graduated with honors from this <br/>
same department, same school, with a degree in commercial design, and <br/>
four years later has not been able to find any work in her field, is <br/>
working for my sister in the banking industry.  And another niece who <br/>
had a full scholarship to the same school, same department, in <br/>
architecture, completed one year there with a 4.0 and quit, went <br/>
home, got married, and opened her own landscape design business, is <br/>
very happy.  She said it was boring and a waste of time.  My daughter <br/>
decided to rethink her position about going to college.  <br/>
<br/>
I suggested that she go to the library and go through a stack of <br/>
Architectural Digest magazines, pick out some rooms she really likes, <br/>
some design work she admires.  She did.  I then suggested she <br/>
research the academic background of the designers she picked.  She <br/>
did.  All but one of the designers she selected had not attended <br/>
college for interior design, had not received a college degree.  I <br/>
suggested she start looking into an internship, scouting about to <br/>
find out where she might be able to work her way into this field if <br/>
that&#39;s what she really wants to do.  She is very happy with that <br/>
option right now.  <br/>
<br/>
Internships and apprenticeships, on-the-job training, work/training <br/>
programs, and other non-academic routes are equally valid and often <br/>
far more satisfying to those who choose them.<br/>

Road Scholar Finds Home at MIT<br/>
Origami Whiz Learned From His Nomad Dad<br/>
By Ellen Barry, Globe Staff, 2/17/2002<br/>
<br/>
Erik Demaine quit school at the age of 7.<br/>
<br/>
If you had run into him a dozen years ago, it might have been in a bus<br/>
station somewhere between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Miami Beach, on <br/>
the road with his father, a silversmith and glassblower whose only <br/>
degree was from Medford High School.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, there he was on Friday, lecturing a roomful of scientists on <br/>
his obscure specialty: computational origami. Demaine, at 20, arrived <br/>
in the fall at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the <br/>
rank of assistant professor - one of the youngest the university has <br/>
ever hired.<br/>
<br/>
But the thing that is truly unusual about Demaine is the story of the <br/>
path he took to get there - and of his father, Martin Demaine, who <br/>
has devoted much of his adult life to educating Erik in a decidedly <br/>
unorthodox way. Raised among hippies and jugglers and free thinkers, <br/>
Erik Demaine has found himself at the center of a field where <br/>
abstract math somehow intersects with street performance. That he is <br/>
a prodigy is not even a question, say people who have worked with <br/>
him; the question is what will amuse him.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;I think the sky is the limit,&#39;&#39; said Anna Lubiw, a professor at the<br/>
University of Waterloo in Ontario who has coauthored papers with Erik <br/>
since he was 15 years old. &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know anybody else like him, <br/>
never mind young. To try to assume anything on the basis of what <br/>
other people have done is nonsense.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
These days, it would be hard to pick out Erik and Martin Demaine at <br/>
MIT&#39;s computer science department, where they both took offices last <br/>
September - Erik on the second floor as an assistant professor, his <br/>
father on the third as an unpaid visiting scholar, which Erik said <br/>
was an incentive, although not a condition, of his choice to come <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
But eight years ago, when the father and son walked into the computer<br/>
science department of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, <br/>
they seemed to have emerged from nowhere. &#39;&#39;His dad and he walked <br/>
into our department and just said he wants to join the university,&#39;&#39; <br/>
said Sampalli Srinivas, an associate professor.<br/>
<br/>
Administrators looked at them like they were crazy. Erik was 12 years <br/>
old, he had no board scores, and no high school diploma. But they <br/>
allowed Erik to take advanced courses in abstract algebra and <br/>
programming languages. The result was clear by the end of the <br/>
term: &#39;&#39;He aced every single course,&#39;&#39; Srinivas said. &#39;&#39;I recognized <br/>
him as one of the brightest students I had.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Over the next few years, a growing number of Canadian academics heard <br/>
the story of Erik&#39;s migratory education. It was a project that kept <br/>
father and son on the road for five years, eating $1 meals in rented <br/>
rooms, and strolling into prestigious universities to talk to <br/>
professors.<br/>
<br/>
And it rested on a risky assumption about the academic world: That If <br/>
you called up a professor and said your son had some questions about <br/>
his work, that professor would invite you in, and start teaching.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;People always seemed curious to meet us,&#39;&#39; said Martin Demaine, <br/>
58. &#39;&#39;Then I would tell his age. I think there certainly was some <br/>
mystery about us that we allowed to exist.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
For the first years of Erik&#39;s life, the Demaines lived more or less <br/>
by the rules in Halifax, with Martin working long hours as a <br/>
silversmith and Erik enrolled in Montessori school, Martin said. But <br/>
after a painful divorce - neither father nor son was willing to talk <br/>
about it on the record - Martin came to the realization, as he puts <br/>
it, that &#39;&#39;I didn&#39;t know how to bring up a child.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
So Martin threw himself into it the way he had thrown himself into<br/>
glassblowing, silversmithing, puzzlemaking, and filmmaking, among <br/>
variousother pursuits. He fired the nanny and came up with a plan: <br/>
They would live on $5,000 a year. They would travel by bus, support <br/>
themselves with craft shows and the proceeds of the &#39;&#39;Erik & Dad <br/>
Puzzle Co.,&#39;&#39; and attempt to feed themselves on a budget of $1 per <br/>
meal per person (a goal Martin admits sheepishly now they did not <br/>
always achieve). Martin would work as little as possible.<br/>
<br/>
The father&#39;s educational theory went like this: Apart from one hour <br/>
of homeschooling a day, the child should pursue his own interests. <br/>
They spent a few weeks at a commune in Tennessee, a year in <br/>
Providence, six months in Chicago. During a three-year stint in Miami <br/>
Beach, he sat Erik down with a neighbor to see if he was interested <br/>
in learning Chinese; the language instruction went nowhere, but the <br/>
neighbor had a computer.<br/>
<br/>
They borrowed missionary textbooks from a group of Seventh-day <br/>
Adventists. Martin Demaine can remember three bookstores where the <br/>
staff became so accustomed to seeing the Demaines poring through <br/>
their merchandise that they set up tables as a study area for the two.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;We would go to a museum,&#39;&#39; Demaine said. &#39;&#39;Anything he pointed to or<br/>
mentioned, I&#39;d go to the library and find a book and leave it on the <br/>
table. Sometimes after three days the books would disappear.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
The result, according to Erik Demaine, is that he pursued his own <br/>
interests, circumventing years of cramming for tests and memorizing <br/>
facts. &#39;&#39;Memorization is not such a big deal. You remember what you <br/>
need to remember and look the rest up,&#39;&#39; he said.<br/>
<br/>
His father insisted that he try school regularly, &#39;&#39;To make sure,&#39;&#39; <br/>
Erik Demaine said.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;In Miami Beach, I went to school for a month because there was this <br/>
cute girl,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;It was a fine experience, but it was a much, <br/>
much slower pace than I was used to.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Erik understands why people put such an emphasis on studying for <br/>
tests: &#39;&#39;You need grades so you can do something you want to do <br/>
afterward. You need to take the tests to get the grades to apply to <br/>
graduate school.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
But none of that ever applied to him. At 9, Erik took over the<br/>
home-schooling teacher&#39;s manual and began teaching himself.<br/>
<br/>
At Dalhousie, and then at the University of Waterloo, the Demaines <br/>
made an unusual pair, the gangly teenager and his ponytailed father <br/>
sitting together in class. &#39;&#39;The thing that really struck me was the <br/>
way his dad motivated him,&#39;&#39; said Srinivas. &#39;&#39;When Erik was sick and <br/>
felt under the weather, his dad used to attend my lecture and make a <br/>
tape.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
And Martin Demaine, who had made forays into physics and law graduate<br/>
programs but had never finished a college degree, began to hear people<br/>
describe his son as a prodigy. &#39;&#39;To be honest, I just thought he was <br/>
above average,&#39;&#39; he said.<br/>
<br/>
They continued to work together, though, as Erik&#39;s interests wandered <br/>
from tectonic plates to liquid dynamics to parallel computing <br/>
systems. It was Martin, with his background in the visual arts, who <br/>
introduced his son and his professors to the ancient Japanese art of <br/>
folding paper.<br/>
<br/>
Long the exclusive terrain of a few researchers, origami math has <br/>
woken up slowly in recent years as researchers began to apply it to a <br/>
lengthening list of real-world applications: to the folding of <br/>
proteins in human DNA, or the unfolding of enormous lenses in <br/>
orbiting space telescopes, or the folding of air bags in automobiles.<br/>
<br/>
Erik also became interested in the study of linkage, the dynamics of<br/>
rigid-sided polygons in two dimensions. Last year, with the help of<br/>
mathematicians Robert Connelly and Gunther Rote, he solved the <br/>
infamous &#39;&#39;Carpenter&#39;s Ruler&#39;&#39; problem, which had stymied scientists <br/>
since the 1960s, proving that any such polygon can be unraveled <br/>
without breaking - work that would be relevant to the fields of <br/>
robotics and genetics.<br/>
<br/>
By last year, when he interviewed at Stanford, New York University, <br/>
and Carnegie Mellon, Erik was a coveted hire. Leigh Deacon, from her <br/>
desk in MIT&#39;s computer science department, watched the hiring process <br/>
with fascination. &#39;&#39;I said, unless this man has a third eye, <br/>
everybody&#39;s going to want him,&#39;&#39; Deacon said.<br/>
<br/>
The news that he had accepted and that she would be working as his<br/>
administrative assistant made her more than a little anxious. She had<br/>
already spent too much time around geniuses, enough to know <br/>
that &#39;&#39;almost none of them know how to behave with other humans.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;I thought to myself, what am I going to get? The most arrogant,<br/>
egotistical person on the planet? Am I going to get someone just <br/>
short of insane? There&#39;s got to be something wrong with him to <br/>
compensate for his brilliance,&#39;&#39; said Deacon. &#39;&#39;I was just <br/>
shocked ... He has this sort of quiet humility. He&#39;s got this nice <br/>
expression on his face.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Then there was the strange business of his father accompanying him. <br/>
It&#39;s an unusual arrangement, agreed one colleague, but it&#39;s worked so <br/>
far.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;Anyone who takes the time to know what Erik is about would know that<br/>
separating him from his father would be a bad idea,&#39;&#39; said Thomas <br/>
Hull, an assistant professor at Merrimack College who has conducted <br/>
research with the Demaines on origami.<br/>
<br/>
Lubiw, who was one of Erik&#39;s thesis advisers, said there is no <br/>
question that the Demaines&#39; work is a function of synergy. &#39;&#39;Even me, <br/>
I can&#39;t tell what is his gift, what is his obsession, and what is his <br/>
hard work,&#39;&#39; said Lubiw. &#39;&#39;I do take moral lessons for the way Marty <br/>
raised him.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
At 20, Erik is nearly out of prodigy age range, and his lanky 6-foot-<br/>
3-inch frame makes his age barely detectable anyway. He will explain, <br/>
with a sweet smile, that our society is far too age- segregated: &#39;&#39;It <br/>
is my single passive political stance,&#39;&#39; he said - and argues that a <br/>
lot of other people could do what he does if they had the same <br/>
encouragement.<br/>
<br/>
In the Waterloo department that was home to this strange duo until <br/>
last fall, there is a twinge of regret at their departure. But Ian <br/>
Munro, Erik&#39;s thesis adviser, said he is just glad they came in the <br/>
first place.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;You don&#39;t regret things like that happening to you,&#39;&#39; said <br/>
Munro. &#39;&#39;You think: It was great to have Erik as a student.&#39;&#39;<br/>

probably going to effect you down the line in advancement.  My own hubby and <br/>
my BIL have both been dealing with this in the last couple years.  They both <br/>
are self taught engineers in different fields but have reached the tops their <br/>
companies would let them go without degrees.  My BIL did an associate degree <br/>
online and changed companies with a drastic cut in pay because he didn&#39;t like <br/>
the company he was working for since the son took over.  He&#39;s anticipating <br/>
that he should be back up to what he was paying in the next 3 to 5 years.  My <br/>
hubby is stuck - he makes more then managers in other companies so we&#39;d also <br/>
take a major pay cut (as much as 1/2 his salary now) which we can&#39;t afford <br/>
for him to change companies.  His company because of his work schedule is <br/>
making it impossible for him to stay in college consistently to get a degree <br/>
although he has finished his freshman levels and is somewhere into his <br/>
sophomore level.  They&#39;ve used his lack of degree for the last 3 years as a <br/>
reason not to give him a pay raise.  The fact that he&#39;s attending college <br/>
even and has several patents under his name doesn&#39;t make a difference.  What <br/>
gets me the most is that they don&#39;t even care what the degree is in - they <br/>
have one guy there that has a degree in forestry BUT it&#39;s a degree.  So I <br/>
guess my long winded point to all this is that yes you can get into the field <br/>
but your going to need that piece of paper to advance very far eventually.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Obviously things have changed since 1970, but I went into a computer<br/>
programming course at a community college then with *no* prerequisites.  I<br/>
had taken symbolic logic, done very well and loved it.  Someone told me I&#39;d<br/>
be good at programming, so I started the course.  I had intended to continue<br/>

out there.  Just because colleges teach something doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the only<br/>
place to learn it.  I remember Wendy Priesnitz telling a story about one of<br/>
her daughters who went to high school but had done no college.  She saw an<br/>
ad for a web page designer and faxed her resume.  She got hired over a<br/>
number of university grads.  They told her that they hired her because she<br/>
had shown she knew how to learn what she didn&#39;t know.  They also said that<br/>
universities tend to produce computer science grads who are a year or two<br/>
behind the latest technology.<br/>

If you are doing something your really love, your life passion, the <br/>
money is seldom the deciding factor.  I mean, do you know the <br/>
percentage of actors who make more than $5,000 a year?  It&#39;s <br/>
infinitesimal.  Doesn&#39;t stop folks from going into acting.  And a <br/>
college degree in that field is....window dressing!  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, some fields are totally controlled by the whole &quot;culture of <br/>
experts,&quot;  which clearly does not make them great vocations for me. <br/>
But for someone who just loves that sort of thing, well they pay the <br/>
price for buying into that kind of expert controlled career if they <br/>
remain in this country. Truly, almost no career is totally <br/>
protected.  Technological changes and economic changes, not to <br/>
mention a crashing stock market, can turn even the most secure person <br/>
into a welfare client.  Might as well consider doing what you love <br/>
and not choose your life&#39;s work solely for money.  <br/>
<br/>
By the way, the big demand careers for the future will be in services <br/>
the U. S. Dept. of labor says, everything from waiters and waitresses <br/>
to all other services.  So if it&#39;s security you are looking for, then <br/>
get into a service industry, or start a service industry based <br/>
business.  Security and income do not necessarily equal job <br/>
satisfaction, however.<br/>

some traveling doing that, and picked up a bunch of cool stuff on <br/>

stuff.  She then got the idea to become an importer/exporter, and <br/>
started a small business doing that.  She then bought a house, <br/>
decorated it with her stuff, and that took her into the idea of <br/>

because I didn&#39;t know what they were ahead of time.  Otherwise I <br/>
might not have tried the stuff I did.&quot;  I don&#39;t think she had any <br/>

designer.  Who would predict that?  Anyway, people go about doing <br/>
the things they want to do from all sorts of directions.  There <br/>
can&#39;t possibly be only one way to do something.  You just have to <br/>
start from somewhere and keep an eye open for opportunities.  There <br/>
are always going to be obstacles.  Maybe it just depends on how you <br/>
look at it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are so many variables in life.  My late husband had only a high <br/>
school diploma when he separated from the military, post Viet Nam.  <br/>
He took advantage of a free electrical trades training program in the <br/>
community funded technical trade school where we were living.  He <br/>
then worked as an apprentice for with a private contractor for <br/>
awhile, finally getting a very good job as a union apprentice at one <br/>
of the government laboratories.  They offered reimbursement for <br/>
college courses, so he started studying to be an electrical engineer, <br/>
one course at a time.  He finally received his college degree, all <br/>
the way getting raises and further specialized training where he <br/>
worked, in the government lab.  He died about 10 years later, but he <br/>
had his degree.  <br/>
<br/>
Another friend at the same laboratory started as a secretary.  She <br/>
had about a year of college when she started working there.  She took <br/>
her college reimbursement benefits and completed her undergrad degree <br/>
in business, then went on to get her MBA.  All paid for by her <br/>
employer.  She now has a mid-level administrative job there, paying <br/>
many times higher than her secretarial position did.  And she likes <br/>
what she&#39;s doing.  <br/>
<br/>
And a third friend went to work in a contracting firm, as a <br/>
secretary, started taking college courses toward a degree in <br/>
engineering, again paid for by her employer.  She graduated a few <br/>
years ago and walked across the hall to her own office and a very <br/>
highly paid job in the firm, who were all very proud of her and happy <br/>
to welcome her to join them in the higher income brackets.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of ways to get to college, to get a degree, if <br/>
that&#39;s what someone really wants.  <br/>

life gets in the way and we take a different path, maybe not what we&#39;ve <br/>
always dreamed of but sometimes we have to learn to be happy where we are at <br/>
too, that&#39;s the sadder part of reality.<br/>
<br/>
I guess in theory if one put off finding/marrying a mate and having children <br/>
until they found a way to first FIND their lives passion then spend the time <br/>
figuring out how exactly to support a single person then figure out how to <br/>
increase it to support a spouse and family...<br/>
<br/>
Most of reality is that people don&#39;t wait until half way through life to get <br/>
married and have a family.  Some people are quite lucky and figure out a way <br/>
to immediately make a lot of money with their passion, sports celebrities <br/>
come to mind, but they are a small minority.<br/>
<br/>
While it is a distinct possibility that your life&#39;s passion will support you <br/>
and your eventual family for life, sometimes one must also evaluate where you <br/>
are at the moment and what you are willing to give up for the love of your <br/>
life and a lot of us do that very willingly and it&#39;s very OK too.<br/>

And we are now trying to undo that kind-of thinking.  My dh has never even considering doing something he might enjoy.  And I want him to know that I&#39;m willing to work towards that goal.   We are now putting together a plan, a 2 year one, so we can do what we love.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I want my children to see the possibilities that life has to offer.  Not the limitations.   I know reality is there and sometimes we have to work a &quot;job&quot; to get by,  but why not at least try?  To me alot of people just say,  &quot;Oh, I can&#39;t make a living doing that!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My dh and I were raised to think you find a job to make a living,   like alot of people, I&#39;m sure,  now we are working to change that thinking.    I really don&#39;t feel like we are too old either,  we are older than 11 tho&#39; &lt;g&gt;,  I&#39;m ready to start living my life even if I am 35,  it is never too late!<br/>

goals we also must honor sacrifice and love of others in life, acknowledging <br/>
that sometimes we exchange some of our wants/goals/passions so that others <br/>
may fill our heart with a different passion, family/children/life.<br/>

<br/>
Kelli, just chiming in with you.<br/>
<br/>
My dh has changed what he does ten times in our marriage. And <br/>
I have supported every change. He is still figuring out what he <br/>
loves. And each time he gets a piece of it, he is so much happier <br/>
in life. In the meantime, he works as a professor and has <br/>
another job that acts as our financial base. But that doesn&#39;t stop <br/>
him for starting a business or dreaming. And I&#39;m excited to see <br/>
how much clarity starts to come when you stop thinking in terms <br/>
of what I &quot;can&quot; do to what I &quot;want&quot; to do.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing.<br/>
<br/>
My 8yos wants to work with animals. They are his consuming <br/>
passion. I checked out a book about careers in wildlife and it <br/>
was fabulous. The best part came at the end. The writer said <br/>
something to this effect: If you want to work with animals, start <br/>
today. Spend some time with animals and find a niche. If you&#39;re <br/>
an accountant, then be an accountant for a zoo or nature center. <br/>
If your experience is hiring and firing people, work in HR for a <br/>
zoo.<br/>
<br/>
Do animal rescue as your avocation.<br/>
<br/>
Volunteer to do education for  endangered species.<br/>
<br/>
The point was that every job a person can do would be more <br/>
happily done if that person were around animals (this is for the <br/>
animal lover).<br/>
<br/>
I got to thinking about that and thought it was a good principle for <br/>
anyone looking at work/career. find a way to take what you are <br/>
good at and use it in the field of your interest. That will take you <br/>
one step closer to being congruent with what you spend most of <br/>
your time doing and what you spend your time fantasizing about.<br/>

&lt;&lt; While it is a distinct possibility that your life&#39;s passion will support <br/>
you <br/>
 and your eventual family for life, sometimes one must also evaluate where <br/>
you <br/>
 are at the moment and what you are willing to give up for the love of your <br/>
 life and a lot of us do that very willingly and it&#39;s very OK too. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny you see it that way, as an either/or situation.<br/>
My dh and I married young (20 and 25 y.o.) and neither of us really had a <br/>
clue about our lifes passion at that point.<br/>
Most of our married life, he worked for a company that paid well and had a <br/>
lot of great benefits, but he wasn&#39;t happy there.<br/>
He really, really wanted to do his own thing. We are both extremely <br/>
independant personality types and I understood the drive to not want to work <br/>
for someone else.<br/>
We moved across the country and started our own business. It was a huge risk <br/>
and we got by on very little money the first three years. Not an easy thing <br/>
to do with three children.<br/>
Now we have four children, a successful business that has supported us since <br/>
it opened and I am working part time at something I love to do.<br/>
He will be supporting me while I get my massage therapy license next year, <br/>
another passion that I&#39;ve always had.<br/>
So I don&#39;t think just because a person has a family to support they should <br/>
have to work a job they don&#39;t love. I will do whatever it takes to help my dh <br/>
have work he loves, and I did. I cooked everything from scratch, didn&#39;t have <br/>
a car for TWO years.<br/>
It was hard. But I know he&#39;d sacrifice for me too.....we help each other <br/>
fulfill our dreams and have work we love. I can&#39;t imagine doing it any other <br/>
way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870257594"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Is anyone familiar with the book Un-Jobbing by Michael Fogler? I <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read that one, but the book that started us on this road, <br/>
before having children, was the classic &quot;Your Money Or Your Life&quot; by <br/>
Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin. I highly recommend it to anyone who is <br/>
interested in transforming the way that they think about money and <br/>
prioritizing their spending so that they can live in an un-jobbing <br/>
manner. We went through the worksheets in the book and they were <br/>
quite eye-opening for us at the time. We also joined a &quot;Voluntary <br/>
Simplicity&quot; discussion group, and that also helped us to get into a <br/>
very different mindset with regards to work, spending, living style, <br/>
income, etc. &quot;Voluntary Simplicity&quot; is also the title of a book (but <br/>
I haven&#39;t read that one), and there are other books on this subject, <br/>
like &quot;The Circle of Simplicity: Return to the Good Life&quot; by Cecile <br/>
Andrews. While these are not specifically about un-jobbing, they are <br/>
definitely helpful in terms of finding a way to get to that place in <br/>
your life where un-jobbing is possible. <br/>

&lt;&lt; While it is a distinct possibility that your life&#39;s passion will support <br/>
you <br/>
and your eventual family for life, sometimes one must also evaluate where <br/>
you <br/>
are at the moment and what you are willing to give up for the love of your <br/>
life and a lot of us do that very willingly and it&#39;s very OK too. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny you see it that way, as an either/or situation.<br/>
My dh and I married young (20 and 25 y.o.) and neither of us really had a <br/>
clue about our lifes passion at that point.<br/>
Most of our married life, he worked for a company that paid well and had a <br/>
lot of great benefits, but he wasn&#39;t happy there.<br/>
He really, really wanted to do his own thing. We are both extremely <br/>
independant personality types and I understood the drive to not want to work <br/>
for someone else.<br/>
We moved across the country and started our own business. It was a huge risk <br/>
and we got by on very little money the first three years. Not an easy thing <br/>
to do with three children.<br/>
Now we have four children, a successful business that has supported us since <br/>
it opened and I am working part time at something I love to do.<br/>
He will be supporting me while I get my massage therapy license next year, <br/>
another passion that I&#39;ve always had.<br/>
So I don&#39;t think just because a person has a family to support they should <br/>
have to work a job they don&#39;t love. I will do whatever it takes to help my dh <br/>
have work he loves, and I did. I cooked everything from scratch, didn&#39;t have <br/>
