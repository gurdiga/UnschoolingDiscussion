&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you read my original post, then you may be interested in the response I<br/>
&gt; got from the census. First is the message I sent them followed by the<br/>
&gt; response I received:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My message:<br/>
&gt; =================<br/>
&gt; I am hoping you can refer this to the correct department. Since there is<br/>
no<br/>
&gt; e-mail address or form provided on the web page for submitting questions<br/>
&gt; that are not covered in the FAQ&#39;s, I am sending this to you as one of the<br/>
&gt; few e-mail addresses I could find on the site.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the question of school attendance, (form D2, question 8) it is clear<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; our children attend &quot;regular school&quot; as they are in elementary school and<br/>
&gt; working towards a high school diploma (eventually, one is 3rd grade, the<br/>
&gt; other 6th). The problem is that the choices for regular school are<br/>
&quot;public&quot;<br/>
&gt; or &quot;private&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Our children are homeschooled (along with an estimated 1.5 million other<br/>
&gt; children in the US - the number is uncertain because many states do not<br/>
&gt; track the number of homeschoolers). This is definitely not public school,<br/>
&gt; but it also is not &quot;controlled and supported by a religious organization<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; other private group&quot; unless our family is considered a private group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Several calls to the help line listed on the form did not provide an<br/>
answer.<br/>
&gt; They seemed to lean towards &quot;No School&quot; if it wasn&#39;t public or private,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; basically just kept repeating the definitions of what the options were.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Should homeschooling be considered private school or should we write in a<br/>
&gt; new choice?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Billy Greer in Maryland<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; =======================<br/>
&gt; Here is the explanation of the choices from your web site:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Part A. SCHOOL ATTENDANCE<br/>
&gt; Regular School<br/>
&gt; Advances a person toward an elementary school certificate, a high school<br/>
&gt; diploma, or a college, university, or professional school (such as law or<br/>
&gt; medicine) degree. Nursery school and kindergarten are included. Tutoring<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; correspondence school should be counted only if credit for it can be<br/>
&gt; obtained in a &quot;regular school.&quot;<br/>
&gt; May be public, parochial (church-related), or other private. Attendance<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; be either by day or night, full time or part time. A school does not have<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; be graded to qualify as a &quot;regular&quot; school.<br/>
&gt; Do not include vocational, trade, or business schools.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mark the &quot;No, has not attended since February 1&quot; box for people who were<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; enrolled in regular school. &quot;On-the-job-training&quot; is not school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Public School<br/>
&gt; A PUBLIC SCHOOL is any school which is controlled and supported primarily<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; a local, county, state, or federal government. Mark the &quot;Yes, public<br/>
school<br/>
&gt; or public college&quot; box for people who have attended a regular school or<br/>
&gt; college at any time from February 1, 2000 to April 1, 2000.<br/>
&gt; Private School<br/>
&gt; A PRIVATE SCHOOL is a parochial or other private school which is supported<br/>
&gt; and controlled primarily by a religious organization or other private<br/>
group.<br/>
&gt; Private schools may be religious or nonreligious elementary schools,<br/>
&gt; secondary schools, colleges, universities, professional schools, nursery<br/>
&gt; schools (including preschools and prekindergartens) or Montessori schools.<br/>
&gt; Mark the &quot;Yes, private school or private college&quot; box for people who have<br/>
&gt; attended a regular school or college at any time from February 1, 2000 to<br/>
&gt; April 1, 2000.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do not assume that the name of the school indicates whether the school is<br/>
&gt; public or private. Also, payment of tuition at college does not indicate<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; school is private.<br/>
&gt; ============================================<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now here is the response I got:<br/>
&gt; =================================<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is a good one .... but the key to the answer is in the precise<br/>
wording<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; the questionaire, eg ... has this person attended *regular* school .....<br/>
&gt; Apparently the mask behind No 8 is to identify those that are in, how can<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; put<br/>
&gt; it, an institutionalized educational setting, ie either a public or<br/>
private<br/>
&gt; school.   Those selecting the no answer are considered to be in some other<br/>
&gt; alternative setting.   The final tabulations for this table should give a<br/>
&gt; pretty<br/>
&gt; good idea on just what this number is, under the assumption that it is<br/>
most<br/>
&gt; likely made of a majority in the homeschooling network.   By the way,<br/>
&gt; proceed to<br/>
&gt; No 9 and mark what you consider the equivilant grade level to be based on<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; judgement/experience.<br/>
&gt; ================================<br/>
&gt; ================================<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From the reply I got, it does appear that the expected selection for<br/>
&gt; homeschoolers is to select that the child is NOT attending school in<br/>
&gt; question 8, but then to indicate the grade level in question 9. However, I<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be surprised if submitting the same question several times<br/>
resulted<br/>
&gt; in different answers. I don&#39;t think homeschoolers were considered when the<br/>
&gt; question was formulated.<br/>
