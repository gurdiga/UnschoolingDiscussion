How can you live in this world for 51 years and NOT see child abuse? I mean<br/>
this gently. I am amazed. Were you like a geeky nerd who didn&#39;t get out much? <br/>
<br/>
I remember the first time I heard of it, was when a friend at school told me<br/>
they were taken away from their dad because he hit them in the face with his<br/>
belt buckle. I was eight.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m very sorry to hear about the death of the boy. Similar recent <br/>
&gt; posts have shown me that just because I have never known or seen <br/>
&gt; child abuse (at all, let alone to the point of death) doesn&#39;t mean it <br/>
&gt; does not widely exist.  Clearly some protective action needs to be <br/>
&gt; taken.  I still feel that a zealous CPS (government) organization can <br/>
&gt; and does overstep its bounds, but I do not have a better solution to <br/>
&gt; offer for cases like this one.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>As a child, kind of like that.  I&#39;ve never seen anyone smoke pot or <br/>
take drugs, and I&#39;ve seen very few drunkards.  I&#39;ll tell you some <br/>
possibilities for why I think that is so, and you can pick the ones <br/>
you think are most likely:<br/>
<br/>
1. I grew up in small towns in the &#39;50s and &#39;60s in NY state (yep, NY <br/>
has some small towns out there).  This stuff was not as common as in <br/>
cities, I suspect.<br/>
2. I probably wouldn&#39;t recognize pot or drugs (but I would recognize <br/>
bruised kids and stories of beatings if I had heard them).<br/>
3. I have always lived in good neighborhoods. Even though my father <br/>
as a minister did not make much money, the parsonages supplied by the <br/>
churches were in good neighborhoods.<br/>
4. I have always lived in houses or upscale apartments (was single <br/>
until age 39 so could afford them &lt;s&gt;).<br/>
5. The places I have lived in did not have visible &quot;child abuse&quot; <br/>
around me.  This one makes me wonder if I picked the few places it <br/>
didn&#39;t happen, or if it is less widespread than some people think.  <br/>
These places include Philmont/Walden/Somers NY state, Akron OH, <br/>
Irving/Dallas TX, Minneapolis, and now Poughkeepsie NY.<br/>
6. I WAS a rather geeky, nerdy child.  We didn&#39;t really &quot;get out&quot; <br/>
much, but I was allowed to ride my bike all over the countryside by <br/>
myself (can&#39;t let the kids do that today, but would love to) and we <br/>
had a fair number of people visit us.  I attended public schools all <br/>
the way through (but despise the &quot;socialization&quot; that I got from <br/>
them). For many years now I have presented week-long technical <br/>
computer courses all over the world to groups of up to 50, so I got <br/>
OJS (on the job socialization).  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
7.I grew up getting a few spankings in my life (less than 6) and took <br/>
them for granted, just as today if I see them administered in a <br/>
loving fashion (see another post of mine for narrow definition of <br/>
spanking vs. brutalization) I take it for granted.  <br/>
<br/>
I have seen a few spankings, by the way, but I am not counting them <br/>
as viewing child abuse.  I have not seen beltings, bruisings, <br/>
beatings, or even horrific verbal abuse.  Believe it or not.  If I <br/>
ever see bruising going on, I will make a judgment on whether to step <br/>
in or not (I am no longer geeky, perhaps a little nerdy still, but <br/>
quite athletic for 51).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-768849627">Mike, <br/>
You don&#39;t mention if these places were after the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s that you &quot;grew up in small towns in New York&quot;  but I can speak to you of  just not being aware of your surroundings in either Irving or Dallas.....at least through the 90&#39;s.    I mean, goodness........they still beat the children in school with wooden paddles that cause bruises and sometimes nerve damage!.     And those are given the diminutive term &quot;licks&quot;........considered far less of a punishment than the &quot;whippings&quot;  administered at home by probably a much larger portion of parents that you would ever imagine.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Spankings&quot;  are those little swats given to toddlers.  No one over 5 years old is &quot;spanked&quot; .    Spanking is for babies and open hands are used.  (These are NOT my beliefs, just reporting on the culture).   Whippings use weapons......belt, switch, rope, cord, paddle, board, maybe even an old fashioned razor strap.         <br/>
<br/>
Might be LOTS of stuff that is considered so routine in a child&#39;s life that you might never notice even if you visited in the home or heard parents nonchalantly refer to daddy having two belts (black and brown)  so that no matter what he might be wearing while away,  kids know that there is always one coiled in the top drawer.   <br/>
<br/>
Or the ping pong paddle on top of the fridge.   Or the &quot;special&quot; paddles made as woodworking projects  to give to parents or teachers as a gift.   <br/>
<br/>
Small towns in New York certainly not immune.  It was a small NY town where I witnessed  NY natives use  cattle prods and horsewhips......and CPS investigators report that sometimes physical discipline can be necessary and so long as no life threatening injuries........... <br/>
<br/>
 No, Mike.  I think  it probable there was lots of child abuse around you.  It just was not visible to you.  And its victims would have no reason to inform you since it would all be considered just the way things are. <br/>
<br/>
Not much different than all those kids in abusive school situations who  just figger &quot;schools are like that.....yeah they are.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I too lived in small towns in upstate NY in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s and I<br/>
can tell you that the small insulated little pockets of perfect<br/>
small town life had all the big city vices. Incest, rape, wife<br/>
beating, and child abuse. This is America we&#39;re talking about here.<br/>
Same as any other place. <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t take very much to talk to people, really talk to older<br/>
people and hear their pain. The young and the very old don&#39;t lie<br/>
anymore. The young don&#39;t know how and the old can&#39;t remember and<br/>
they tell the truth about their early childhood memories because in<br/>
many cases it is their early lives and early pain that they remember<br/>
best and the people they used to protect just aren&#39;t around anymore.<br/>
That is why it is so important to treat children gently: the pain<br/>
they experience in their early years follows them around all of<br/>
their life.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t hard to find people who talk about the early pain in their<br/>
life when their bodies or their spirits were not protected or<br/>
respected. I hear it all the time because I listen.<br/>

As a sweeping generalization, let me say that gossip enables most women<br/>
to know more than most men about what the neighbors are doing, or<br/>
rumored to be doing.<br/>

<br/>
No, I think I learned most of these things from teenage friends many of whom<br/>
did not survive to adulthood. <br/>
<br/>
I do talk and listen. And the happy rarity is hearing someone who didn&#39;t have<br/>
something like this in his or her life. <br/>
