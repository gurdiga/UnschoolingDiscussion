<div id="ygrps-yiv-346050721">I just wanted to say that I have really appreciated this discussion the last couple of days. Having the opportunity to re-examine beliefs and how they relate in my own life has been a positive experience. I think everyone is working towards making the list better and clearer and this is a good thing. As zenmomma mary said, this list will be what we create, and I can see that as we continue to process our thoughts, etc. we are doing exactly that. Thank you all for your great contributions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well said, Mary. And this might be a good place to add my own <br/>
comments on this list...<br/>
<br/>
Some of you are aware that I was dragged kicking and screaming into <br/>
moderation on this list. I still kick about it once in a while (just <br/>
this morning, not on this list). My thinking relates to the wonderful <br/>
definitions we&#39;ve seen here about control and coercion and trusting...<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re expecting people to trust their children to learn what they <br/>
need to, shouldn&#39;t we trust the members of this list to learn to get <br/>
along? Isn&#39;t that where it all really begins? Shouldn&#39;t we, as a <br/>
group, &quot;walk the talk?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now I understand the dynamics involved as well as anyone (I think <br/>
I&#39;ve literally been onlist the longest &lt;g&gt;) and I know why moderation <br/>
was initiated, and in retrospect I think it was probably the right <br/>
thing to do at the time. But am I the only one seeing some kind of <br/>
paradox here?<br/>
<br/>
(Okay, Mary and Joyce, you can kick me now.)<br/>

If there is moderation - people will get pissed off and leave? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh - that&#39;s not the paradox you meant, is it? <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really see the paradox, Helen. Nobody is forced to be here and there <br/>
are no tests &lt;BEG&gt;. Now - if Joyce and Mary get it into their heads to have a <br/>
weekly quiz and they start giving us letter grades based on how much of the <br/>
previous week&#39;s posts we are able to regurgitate on the quiz, then, yeah, <br/>
that would be paradoxical. And we&#39;d all get pissed off and leave, too!! &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER - that just got me thinking about quizzes -- they can be very useful, <br/>
you know. The teens I know are obsessed with taking online quizzes - what <br/>
kind of bird would you be if you were a bird, what kind of muffin, what kind <br/>
of flower, what character in Lord of the Rings are you? Etc. Even quizzes <br/>
that test your knowledge are fun - that&#39;s what trivia games are (fun for some <br/>
of us, not for everybody, I know). And quizzes are useful for testing our <br/>
learning about something too -- what isn&#39;t fun is being forced to &quot;learn&quot; <br/>
(using the term very loosely) something just FOR a quiz and then getting a <br/>
grade on what you managed to spit out on the quiz and then having your future <br/>
decided based on those kinds of grades. I can spell S-T-U-P-I-D AND it wasn&#39;t <br/>
ever on a spelling test, either -- because when I was a kid it was a &quot;bad <br/>
word&quot;! &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>

this list. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;HOWEVER - that just got me thinking about quizzes -- they can be very useful,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ours have *always* been obsessive about quizzes. They love them, <br/>
especially trivia quizzes - I think we went through every variation <br/>
of Trivial Pursuit made when they were younger! When our oldest son <br/>
from Alaska was here a couple of weeks ago the quizzes flew like mad: <br/>
many, many movie-related Q&A sessions (what was The Duke&#39;s favorite <br/>
horse&#39;s name?); scads of automotive pop quizzes (what are the little <br/>
holes on the sides of Buicks called?); all kinds of testing, testing, <br/>
testing each others&#39; stores of knowledge. And yeah - plenty of trivia <br/>
questions about the currently favorite LOTR movie (they&#39;ve had the <br/>
original animated version for many years). Jody&#39;s the resident expert <br/>
on that, having read The Hobbit, The Trilogy, The Silmarillion, etc. <br/>
many times now. She even has odd books like The Atlas of Middle <br/>
Earth, LOTR Mythology of Power, etc. - drives the boys nuts with her <br/>
questions to see what they (don&#39;t) know!<br/>

Nope :) Actually this reminded me.. I&#39;m a message board with a bunch of women, we have been together for sometime now and our &quot;home&quot; has changed twice, once being at an ACLU site... anyway, we never need a moderator to come and &quot;tone us down&quot;... don&#39;t get me wrong, we have had some really heated/great debates but we as a group decided it didn&#39;t need to be ugly...<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would mention it,<br/>

<br/>
The paradox is that we, as unschoolers, give up controlling our children, yet we need it here (well, control is to harsh a word, but hopefully you get my jist)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So the same group of women has been together for some time?  That might be <br/>
the difference.  You&#39;ve had a chance to get to know each other.  It&#39;s not <br/>
as good as knowing people face-to-face, but it helps to know more or less <br/>
how people are likely to react to what you say.  Here, people come and <br/>
go.  We can&#39;t really say, &quot;we as a group&quot;.  It&#39;s harder to predict how <br/>
people will react, and there are always the lurkers.  You don&#39;t know what <br/>
they think at all until&#92;unless they start to post.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you talking about the list moderators here?<br/>
<br/>
As an unschooling parent, I give my kids lots of what I think is useful <br/>
feedback (they don&#39;t always agree, of course &lt;g&gt;). Sometimes I call the shots <br/>
and control the behavior, too, without waiting for the child to learn, all on <br/>
her own, from her mistakes. One example that comes to mind is that I told one <br/>
child today to stop feeding chocolate chip cookies to the dog and when she <br/>
didn&#39;t move fast enough and the dog was about to gulp down more cookies, I <br/>
reached out and took the plate and put it out of the dog&#39;s reach. Now, I <br/>
didn&#39;t do it nastily and I didn&#39;t yell and I didn&#39;t punish her for feeding <br/>
the dog in the first place and I did suggest to her that she could find some <br/>
alternative treat to feed the dog.  But, although there are undoubtedly <br/>
people here who are also followers of the noncoercive parenting philosophy, <br/>
most unschoolers are probably going to (respectfully, of course) call the <br/>
shots and control behavior sometimes. We just aren&#39;t going to coerce kids <br/>
into learning according to a school schedule in a schoolish way. Past that - <br/>
when we get into parenting issues - I&#39;d imagine that unschoolers tend to be <br/>
on the less coercive end of the spectrum - but not to the point that they <br/>
could say they are truly noncoercive parents (as in the Taking Children <br/>
Seriously/Sarah Lawrence meaning).<br/>

<br/>
I think we can say &quot;as a group&quot; here, there are over 600 people on this list, that to me constitues a group :) I think that heated discussions need to be just that, heated. Heated does not equal a personal attack. If one the webpage, it says &#39;No personal attacks will be permitted&#39;, the new person would then know right off that if it happens, the attacker could be removed/put on moderation/etc.<br/>

is that they are guidelines, that the moderators really don&#39;t want to be in <br/>
control or bump anyone off unless they have to.  They&#39;re meant to keep <br/>
things from getting ugly, not heated.  Heated I like.  Ugly I don&#39;t.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I forget what the substance is but it is highly poisonous. Apparently milk<br/>

I advise my kids when they&#39;re behaving in ways that will be harmful.  <br/>
They don&#39;t want to be harmful, and the reminder causes them to stop.<br/>
<br/>
Is that &quot;control&quot;?  <br/>
<br/>
If they said &quot;No, I WANT to keep on being rude,&quot; I might ask them to come <br/>
into another room to talk to me, effectively giving the victim a moment of <br/>
peace while I negotiated. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s never happened that they weren&#39;t willing to consider other actions.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I control them, puppet-like.<br/>
<br/>
When they were toddlers, I might pick them up and carry them into the other <br/>
room to talk about the situation.  That gave them time to calm down, or to <br/>
express frustration.  I might have caused them to be nicer by my words and <br/>
persuasion and encouragement to calm down and try again, but I didn&#39;t &quot;make&quot; <br/>
them.<br/>

Possibly it&#39;s a matter of terminology.<br/>

  When you take your child to the other room, that is taking control of the<br/>

         These are from a book called Disorder in the Court, and are <br/>
things people actually said in court, word for word, taken down and <br/>
now published by court reporters - who had the torment of staying <br/>
calm while these exchanges were actually taking place.<br/>

         A: I forget.<br/>

            doesn&#39;t know about it until the next morning?<br/>

            deposition notice which I sent to your attorney?<br/>
         A: No, this is how I dress when I go to work.<br/>
<br/>
         Q: Doctor, how many autopsies have you performed on dead people?<br/>
         A: All my autopsies are performed on dead people.<br/>
<br/>
         Q: All your responses must be oral, OK? What school did you go to?<br/>
         A: Oral.<br/>
<br/>
         Q: Do you recall the time that you examined the body?<br/>
         A: The autopsy started around 8:30 p.m.<br/>
         Q: And Mr.. Dennington was dead at the time?<br/>
         A: No, he was sitting on the table wondering why I was doing an<br/>
            autopsy.<br/>
<br/>

         Q: Did you check for breathing?<br/>
         A: No.<br/>
         Q: So, then it is possible that the patient was alive when you<br/>
            began the autopsy?<br/>
         A: No.<br/>
         Q: How can you be so sure, Doctor?<br/>
         A: Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar.<br/>
         Q: But could the patient have still been alive, nevertheless?<br/>
         A: Yes, it is possible that he could have been alive and<br/>
            practising law somewhere.<br/>

Controlling individual situations (even if parents can &quot;control&quot;) isn&#39;t<br/>
as <br/>
useful longterm as coming to understandings where they change their way<br/>
of <br/>
seeing or being.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have been learning this one.  My children and I have talked about the<br/>
fact that though they are not responsible for their parent&#39;s happiness,<br/>
since we all live together we should all find ways to live at peace with<br/>
one another.<br/>
My 14y.o. son today asked my husband what he would like for us as a<br/>
family to do to help him now that he has a new job.  He said dinner,<br/>
breakfast, sack lunch sometimes, housecleaning done before 2 pm. then<br/>
again around dinner time.<br/>
My son told me this, then said, &quot;I learned to ask questions and find<br/>
answers by unschooling.&quot;   In the past, my children would see my husband<br/>
complaining over things not done and just think he was an old grump.  Now<br/>
they are seeking to understand his feelings and to live cooperatively<br/>
with him.  Aaahhh, what a pleasant change.  That makes so much more sense<br/>
than trying to coerce them into doing chores.  And it was initiated by<br/>
the child, not the adult.<br/>

I&#39;m not either, but they &lt;vets&gt; say it is like poison to them<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420209722">Depends on the dog and the chocolate.  It can be deadly, quickly for little<br/>
dogs.  The equivelancy ratios, if I remember correctly is 1 oz baking<br/>
chocolate, 3 oz. semisweet and 10 oz milk chocolate.  Weights, and I&#39;m doing<br/>
this from memory, works out to 1 oz milk chocolate per pound of dogs weight,<br/>
3/10 oz semisweet/lb. dog weight and 1/10 oz baking chocolate/lb. dog weight<br/>
are the toxic doses.<br/>
<br/>
Chocolate has theobromine in it.  Dogs acquire a taste for it once they have<br/>
it and  they don&#39;t have as acute a sense of taste, so they can &quot;smell&quot; the<br/>
chocolate but they can&#39;t &quot;taste&quot; the difference between the bitter and sweet<br/>
chocolates.  They have been known to find the family horde of baking<br/>
chocolate and gorge on it.<br/>

&gt; Well I&#39;m just glad we&#39;re being so goshdarned *agreeable* for a change!<br/>

&gt; Say, Pam - or Lynda - is it really bad to feed a dog chocolate? We<br/>
&gt; have three dogs and the kids and the grandkids are *always* sharing<br/>
&gt; their goodies with them. I think one dog scored *THREE* chocolate<br/>
&gt; bunnies on Easter Sunday... Scarfed &#39;em right out of the baskets when<br/>
&gt; the kids weren&#39;t looking...<br/>
