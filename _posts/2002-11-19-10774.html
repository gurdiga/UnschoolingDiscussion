Homeschoolers get knock<br/>
on door from police<br/>
Public superintendent sends out squad cars to ensure compliance<br/>

<br/>
A public school superintendent has sent police in squad cars to the <br/>
houses of homeschooling families to deliver his demand that they <br/>
appear for a &quot;pre-trial hearing&quot; to prove they are in compliance <br/>
with the law. <br/>
<br/>
Bruce Dennison, regional superintendent of schools in Bureau, Stark, <br/>
and Henry counties in Northeastern Illinois, has contacted more than <br/>
22 families, insisting that they need his approval to conduct <br/>
education at home. <br/>
<br/>
Dennison is exceeding his authority, according to Chris Klicka of <br/>
the Home School Legal Defense Association, or HSLDA, who argues that <br/>
homeschooling is legal in Illinois and families do not need school <br/>
district approval to teach their own children. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;He&#39;s muscling the homeschoolers pretty heavily,&quot; Klicka told <br/>
WorldNetDaily. &quot;One truant officer told a family that he &#39;could take <br/>
away the kids if he wanted to.&#39;&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Also, a district attorney in the area has threatened to prosecute <br/>
families that do not submit to requests to have their program <br/>
approved, said Klicka. <br/>
<br/>
But state law is straightforward and simple, Klicka insists. A 1950 <br/>
Illinois Supreme Court decision, People v. Levisen, established that <br/>
homeschooling falls under the requirements of a private school. <br/>
Private schools are required only to teach the same branches of <br/>
instruction as public schools and to do it in the English language. <br/>
<br/>
HSLDA characterizes the situation in Illinois as one of many around <br/>
the nation in which school districts and government officials are <br/>
seeking to wield greater control over home-based education. The U.S. <br/>
now has as many as 2 million homeschoolers, according to some <br/>
estimates. <br/>
<br/>
The state of California is warning parents that they cannot educate <br/>
their children at home without acquiring a professional teaching <br/>
credential. Officials maintain this stance despite a statute that <br/>
allows any parent to homeschool under a private school exemption. <br/>
Homeschool defenders note that districts are motivated to keep as <br/>
many children in public school as possible because funds are <br/>
allotted per student. <br/>
<br/>
Not much structure <br/>
<br/>
Dennison told WorldNetDaily that it is the policy of his office to <br/>
not to comment on specific cases, but emphasized that in Illinois <br/>
there is no statute on homeschooling. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;So we are relying upon court cases as well as the compulsory <br/>
attendance law,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that is extremely important in <br/>
the homeschooling process, because that does not give much <br/>
structure.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Dennison said that &quot;in some instances in which folks have chosen not <br/>
to share information about their schooling with our office, we have <br/>
asked that they attend a meeting prior to court action being taken, <br/>
that may be referenced as a pre-trial hearing.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s another opportunity to have a conversation about what in fact <br/>
parents are doing about the homeschooling of their child,&quot; he said. <br/>
<br/>
Klicka maintains, however, that other superintendents in Illinois <br/>
accept the procedure for homeschooling in the state that his group <br/>
advises, which is to prepare a &quot;statement of assurance.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
If a family is contacted, according to Klicka, they say, &quot;We&#39;ve <br/>
established a private school in our home pursuant to the Levison <br/>
case. We&#39;re teaching the same branches of instruction as public <br/>
schools.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Home visit <br/>
<br/>
But Christine Fortune told WND that two squad cars showed up at her <br/>
house in Geneseo, Ill., in Henry County, in late October to deliver <br/>
a letter demanding that she appear at a &quot;pre-trial&quot; hearing. <br/>
<br/>
One police cruiser pulled into her driveway, another parked on the <br/>
street. One policeman then accompanied a truant officer and case <br/>
worker to her door, while the other police officer waited in his <br/>
car. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I was very angry,&quot; said Fortune, who homeschools her 14-year-old <br/>
daughter Stephanie. &quot;[My children] were really perplexed why the <br/>
police were coming for me. It was way overkill for something that <br/>
was not even a certified, subpoena kind of letter. It was just <br/>
something they could have popped in the mail.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Fortune, who served as a substitute public school teacher in the <br/>
country for about 10 years, said she had homeschooled prior to this <br/>
school year without any interference. <br/>
<br/>
Klicka said that if a superintendent had evidence that a family is <br/>
lying or is fraudulent, he should refer it to the prosecutor, <br/>
but &quot;this superintendent is thinking, &#39;I&#39;ve got to approve the <br/>
curriculum, I&#39;ve got to check up on the parents.&#39;&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers are under no legal obligation to attend &quot;pre-trial <br/>
hearings,&quot; which have no standards or guarantees, Klicka maintains. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;They&#39;re not really &#39;pre-trial&#39; because there are no charges filed,&quot; <br/>
he said. &quot;It&#39;s just part of the intimidation tactics.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
When questioned, the district attorney had no idea what standards <br/>
would be used to judge a homeschooler&#39;s curriculum, Klicka said. <br/>
<br/>
On Oct. 18, just four or five days prior to the police-escorted <br/>
visit to Fortune&#39;s house, the homeschool mother allowed a case <br/>
worker from the school district to come into her home. HSLDA <br/>
contends that mandatory home visits are violations of a family&#39;s <br/>
right to privacy and the right to be free from unreasonable searches <br/>
and seizures, as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution&#39;s Fourth <br/>
Amendment. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;On the phone, [the case worker] said she wanted to review the <br/>
curriculum and see if I needed any help  is how she was phrasing <br/>
it,&quot; Fortune said. <br/>
<br/>
The case worker was escorted to a room to see the computer-based <br/>
curriculum Fortune&#39;s daughter uses. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The beauty of that program is it&#39;s perfect for any questions she <br/>
would have,&quot; Fortune said. &quot;It has a record of grades and the things <br/>
that have been done and lesson plans. I could have just produced <br/>
that for her very easily, but she never asked.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Instead, said Fortune, the case worker &quot;was fixated on attendance <br/>
records.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
That struck Fortune as being rather odd: &quot;I said, &#39;I don&#39;t do that  <br/>
we don&#39;t punch a time clock. I just write down what we do.&#39;&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I kept telling her,&quot; said Fortune, &quot;&#39;[My children] live here; they <br/>
haven&#39;t been absent once from the home.&#39;&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Dennison would not comment on Fortune&#39;s case, citing policy, but <br/>
said police have been asked to accompany truant officers and case <br/>
workers in a &quot;very low profile, in a very courteous manner.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Dennison bases his approach on a memo issued by the Illinois State <br/>
Board of Education&#39;s legal department, which cites the 1974 federal <br/>
court ruling Scoma vs. Chicago Board of Education. The memo <br/>
says &quot;the court emphasized that the burden of proof rests with the <br/>
parents to establish that the plan of home instruction which they <br/>
are providing to their children meets the state requirements.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The position paper says that &quot;if the regional superintendent is <br/>
dissatisfied with the parents&#39; ability and/or willingness to <br/>
establish that home instruction in a specific instance satisfies the <br/>
requirements of state law, the regional superintendent may request <br/>
that regional or school district truant officer to investigate to <br/>
see that the child is in compliance with the compulsory attendance <br/>
law.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
In a brief on Illinois state law, the HSLDA notes that Scoma v. <br/>
Chicago Board of Education &quot;found the Levisen decision to <br/>
be &#39;reasonable and constitutional.&#39;&quot; <br/>
<br/>
In the Levisen case, HSLDA says, &quot;the Illinois Supreme Court <br/>
emphasized the right of parents to control their children&#39;s <br/>
education.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Levisen held that: &quot;Compulsory education laws are enacted to enforce <br/>
the natural obligations of parents to provide an education for their <br/>
young, an obligation which corresponds to the parents&#39; right of <br/>
control over the child. (Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 400.) The <br/>
object is that all shall be educated not that they shall be educated <br/>
in any particular manner or place.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Since the police visit, Fortune has been referring all communication <br/>
to HSLDA, which is helping three other families who are in a similar <br/>
situation. Membership with the Virginia-based group allows <br/>
homeschool families to take advantage of their legal resources. <br/>
<br/>
Klicka said he is advising his member families not to go to the <br/>
hearings or allow home visits but to &quot;stand on a simple letter <br/>
declaring they are legally homeschooling as a private school.&quot;</div>

and had something to do with stirring it up to begin with? I wouldn&#39;t put it<br/>
past them. They have everything to gain from this kind of media spin. Why not<br/>
manipulate a clueless superintendent? <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for my cynicism but when people are touting William Bennet as altruistic<br/>
for making millions by turning independent homeschooling into Government<br/>
Distance Learning (while vilifying the very system he used to run), my<br/>
skepticism goes way up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have never heard of the World Net Daily before this. Is it a homeschooling <br/>
news? <br/>
<br/>
About HSLDA, I have been seeing their work around me more and more lately. <br/>
Homeschooling here in Kansas is fairly straightforward. Anyone with half a <br/>
brain can figure it out. But twice in the past week I have heard some <br/>
disturbing things. One lady called me, (don&#39;t know how she got my number, but <br/>
anyway...) asking about homeschooling in Kansas. I gave her some resources <br/>
and she asked about the laws. She said someone had told her to join HSLDA <br/>
that it was the only way to homeschool legally. I just couldn&#39;t convince her <br/>
that that wasn&#39;t true.<br/>
<br/>
Then, at Karate the other day, the instructors wife and I were talking. And <br/>
she was asking about our homeschooling. This has become a popular topic <br/>
whenever she and I are sitting with each other. She had been given this 80 <br/>
page booklet by a woman she had contacted about homeschooling. She told me it <br/>
was all about how to follow the law of homeschooling in Kansas. I must have <br/>
looked shocked because she asked if I had a copy. (I don&#39;t, but want to see <br/>
it!) I told her that the law in Kansas isn&#39;t so hard to warrant an 80 page <br/>
booklet. Then she said that some of it covered how to homeschool legally, how <br/>
to keep records for the state and other things to keep on the right side of <br/>
the law. I tried to explain how very untrue this is, but she has already got <br/>
this idea in her head from this other woman and this book thing. And I am <br/>
sure she is sitting there wondering how I can be homeschooling all this time <br/>
and NOT have heard about this, and NOT have been following the rules like she <br/>
is sure I should be. <br/>
<br/>
Now I can&#39;t quote the statutes verbatim, but I do know what they say and <br/>
can&#39;t believe there is a booklet(s) floating around making homeschooling more <br/>
difficult than it is or should be. I also wonder about the whys. Why would <br/>
this type of thing be put out? Since it is, is this why there aren&#39;t as many <br/>
unschoolers in the area? Unschooling already looks so different to most <br/>
people around here. I certainly didn&#39;t receive the welcome wagon when we <br/>
first started and I had it in my head that I should join the local hsing <br/>
group. I wonder how to combat this ignorance? I know it looks so good and <br/>
legal and answers all the questions about keeping hsing all wrapped up in a <br/>
nice package that looks good to the officials. But it doesn&#39;t have to be that <br/>
way. Not here anyway. I can stand my lone ground claiming *thats not right* <br/>
all I want, but others with better looking pamphlets than me have been there <br/>
first. <br/>
<br/>
The thing I am most afraid of is, if this is the accepted thing to do in the <br/>
homeschooling circle, then how far away are we from someone saying *Hey, this <br/>
should be written into the law!*? <br/>

But if you Google Joseph Farah and the Western Journalism Center, you&#39;ll<br/>
find the Western Journalism Center was founded by Joseph Farah and James H.<br/>
