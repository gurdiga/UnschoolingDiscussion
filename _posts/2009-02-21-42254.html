<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144302641">Maybe have the page title more like a question.<br/>
<br/>
Is it ok to not Finish What You Started?<br/>
<br/>
What Does Follow Through Really Mean?<br/>
<br/>
Can Kids Who Quit Karate Learn to Follow Through?<br/>
 <br/>
Or <br/>
<br/>
Important Life Skill, Knowing When to Quit!<br/>

  Sometimes it seems like I have a collection for everything, but it has <br/>
  been pointed out to me this morning that there&#39;s not a page on <br/>
  quitting--the idea of trying something and quitting it.<br/>
<br/>
  It has been discussed, regarding music lessons, martial arts, dance <br/>
  classes, art classes, scouts. Pet care.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t want to call the page &quot;quitting,&quot; but I&#39;d like to have a place <br/>
  for people to read when they&#39;re thinking about &quot;follow-through&quot; and <br/>
  &quot;finish what you start&quot; and those things.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe there are already such sites on the internet? I haven&#39;t looked.<br/>
<br/>
  What is the essence of all that? Choice? &quot;Too young to make a <br/>
  binding contract&quot;?<br/>

Sometimes Pam and I have riffed on the idea that if you had a guest  <br/>
from a very foreign culture you&#39;d advise him on what&#39;s expected and  <br/>
what he can expect, and people should do that for their kids.<br/>
And sometimes it&#39;s been about a child having come into our families  <br/>
without an option on his part, so we should be courteous to him.<br/>
<br/>
(Then some people would say &quot;I think a soul chooses his situation,&quot;  <br/>
and then some of us would say &quot;that can justify child abuse,&quot; and then  <br/>
it would devolve into a dusty scuffle of &quot;OH YEAH!?&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Look for some of those words, maybe. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think quitting can actually be a very fine thing.  I adopted a Quitter<br/>
attitude when I went to nursing school.  As in, I&#39;m here in school today<br/>
because I choose to be here today.  Tomorrow I might choose to do something<br/>
completely different with my life.  I didn&#39;t feel trapped into school due to<br/>
family pressure, financial investment, or any other reason.  In a class of<br/>
115 people, I think I was one of the few that actually felt able to quit, at<br/>
any time for any reason.<br/>
<br/>
It was part of learning my way in the world (I was 22, 23 at the time--wow,<br/>
20 years ago), and it kept nursing school pretty low-stress for me.  It<br/>
drove the school administration bonkers, though, because they had less<br/>
control over me.  They couldn&#39;t use expulsion as a potential punishment.<br/>
They threatened, twice, to kick me out.  I was called before the Board to<br/>
answer charges of insubordination...I forget the exact details.  I told them<br/>
that I thought the charges were silly, gave a quick rundown of my<br/>
interpretation of the situation in question, told them my lawyer would be in<br/>
contact with them the next day if they booted me, and left the boardroom.<br/>
It was a bluff since I didn&#39;t actually have a lawyer (though I could get<br/>
one).  I just thought they were bluffing, too. And they were, so it worked.<br/>
They did put me on probation of some kind...I remember signing a contract<br/>
saying I would be kicked out for tardiness and several other minor offenses,<br/>
none of which I ever committed.<br/>
<br/>
I also ignored their grades.  Every 8 weeks we had a 1-on-1 evaluation<br/>
session with our lead instructor, and she gave us 2 grades: clinical and<br/>
didactic.  The grades were written on post-it notes and handed to us<br/>
ceremonially across the table.  I always crumpled mine and dropped it in the<br/>
trash without even glancing at it.  First couple times they were aghast, but<br/>
then got used to it.  When asked, I just told them that if I were flunking<br/>
out, I think someone would tell me.  But since I was having fun and learning<br/>
lots and my clinical patients loved me (I even got flowers from patients,<br/>
twice, as well as a few Thank You cards), my grades were probably fine and I<br/>
didn&#39;t really care how I compared to Suzie or Johnnie in their A-B-C-D-F<br/>
hierarchy.  Some instructors thought this was hilarious (they were my<br/>
favorite folks, for obvious reasons) and others never did figure out how to<br/>
take it.  And one of the people who was most threatened by my Quitter<br/>
attitude was the one who charged me with insubordination twice.<br/>
<br/>
At graduation, I discovered I had been on the Honor Roll straight through.<br/>
And I had had fun.  And when I encountered the word Unschooling 15 years<br/>
later, it made a lot of sense to my School Rebel self. <br/>

And my mom used to say &quot;quit that&quot; all the time to me.   And in my  <br/>
