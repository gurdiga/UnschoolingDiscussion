<div id="ygrps-yiv-541445743">Hello. My husband & I have been working & my mom stays with my kids who<br/>
are 9 & 3yrs. She&#39;s great and although she does not agree with our<br/>
choice she respects it. I just feel like I am missing out on so much I<br/>
just wanted suggestions to see how other unschoolers are doing it.<br/>
Thanks for your time.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-149801622">The best way to see how other unschoolers are doing it is probably to  <br/>
read the archives of the list (go to yahoogroups.com and you can get  <br/>
there, and to follow some of the links from here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/help">http://sandradodd.com/help</a><br/>
<br/>
Those go to lots of articles for beginners (your mom might enjoy  <br/>
reading some of that) and to other people&#39;s unschooling sites and  <br/>
blogs and photos.<br/>
<br/>
There are some other discussion lists there too that might be more  <br/>
appropriate.<br/>

work at night when my dh was home with the kids. I was home during  <br/>
the day when he was at work.<br/>
