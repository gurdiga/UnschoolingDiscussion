Well, you know, I try my best.  Anyway, anything I can do to get the rain out <br/>
of here for a day or to.  Yesterday was beautiful.  It was cool, but when the <br/>
sun came out it was so nice and warm.  The little ones and I had a pinic <br/>
lunch in our yard.  The ground was actually dry!!<br/>
