<div id="ygrps-yiv-984998780">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
It was so refreshing to read that others had made the same decision about the <br/>
no-circ.  The site no.circ was mentioned in one of the articles I read in <br/>
England in 1994 when I was pregnant with Zak.  I&#39;m happy to hear there is <br/>
another one that&#39;s giving out information to parents so they can make more <br/>
informed decisions.<br/>
