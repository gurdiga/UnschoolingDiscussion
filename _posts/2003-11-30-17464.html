<div id="ygrps-yiv-209176269">Hi everyone!  I was wondering if any of you knew of any websites for <br/>

few from other countries.  When I did a search engine..  &quot;Penpals for <br/>
children&quot;.... ya know what came up?....  penpals with prisoners... <br/>
(top three) and then... a child murder or lost child....  how <br/>

She used to (might still) have an anti-unschooling article up, under <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
When I objected, she said she wanted to have a balanced presentation, but I <br/>
also had the impression she hadn&#39;t really read it, just linked it.  :-/ <br/>
<br/>
But there IS a ton of stuff there.  <br/>
