i too just got smartie pants and i hate math books. i purchased them.<br/>
my son is 15 and was amazed how much math is all around us ans has been<br/>
reading the books off and on. my dd is not so interested yet but has<br/>
gone back to her old key to.. work booklet on decimalsa few times since<br/>
i told them they didnt &#39;have&#39; to do math anymore. they are slowly coming<br/>
around and showing interest. i say give it time let themcool off and get<br/>
interested in thier own time. and provide a rich learning<br/>

&lt;&lt; So I would say, look into the colleges (by asking other students there -<br/>
not the faculty) and see just what will be needed.  You may find that he<br/>
needs a lot less than you think in the way of formal math - in fact &quot;none<br/>
at all&quot; comes to mind here.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree.<br/>
<br/>
People assume that &quot;math&quot; is 180 days of exercies in geometry,  followed by <br/>
180 days (minus assemblies and bomb scares and other school pull-outs) of <br/>
algebra, optionally followed by algebra II or calculus, minus which children <br/>
do NOT know math, and WITH which children DO know math.  <br/>
<br/>
For one thing, a year of high school algebra isn&#39;t as much as a semester of <br/>
college algebra.  With math, as with writing or history or science or music <br/>
or anything, either a kid sparks and GETS IT, in which case much of his <br/>
learning happens in his own head, or goofing with the ideas on his own, or <br/>
looking at other sources, or maybe the kid sparks because he already was a <br/>
mathematical thinker; or the kid does NOT spark, just sits in a room where <br/>
the teacher is trying unsuccessfully to get the spark lit, suffers through <br/>
homework he doesn&#39;t understand, gets bad grades on tests he&#39;s not <br/>
understanding, and comes out at the end of the year not knowing any more than <br/>
he knew before except that he hates math more (whatever &quot;math&quot; is to him).<br/>
<br/>
Playing, building, puzzle solving, video game playing, are all more real to <br/>
mathematical thought and understanding than formulas in a textbook are.  <br/>
There are 100 level math courses at most colleges and ALL local/jr/commmunity <br/>
colleges.  There are computer games (algebra blasters) and there are internet <br/>
review sites.  There are laminated study-guides.  There are other humans to <br/>
ask questions of.  <br/>
<br/>
Nobody, college bound or otherwise, has to take &quot;math classes&quot; in the classic <br/>
sense.  If you and your kids want to know what kind of math is on the ACT or <br/>
SAT, get sample tests, look at websites, buy (USED!) study guides for them.  <br/>
<br/>
Much of this worry, pressure and grief comes from the parents not being clear <br/>
on where math is in the real world, or not being aware that most kids who do <br/>
well in math in jr. high and high school already understood it and had an <br/>
interest before they got into the classroom, so for the best students, it&#39;s <br/>
just naming ideas they already had and putting graphs and charts to things <br/>
they had instinctively figured out already without the formalities.<br/>
<br/>
Mathematical notation is like musical notation, or like diagramming <br/>
sentences.  Someone can be a great speaker and writer, a poet, and not know <br/>
what a past participle is (and not NEED to know).  Someone can be a great <br/>
musician AND compser, a Paul McCartney, and not read music or know &quot;modes&quot; <br/>
and &quot;subdominant chords&quot; (not by name).   Let your kids do math like <br/>
musicians play by ear or like writers write in ideas, not in sentence <br/>
structures.<br/>
<br/>
IF they love it and if they&#39;re good at seeing it, thinking it, using it, they <br/>
might (or might not ever) want to learn the written notation.  And if they <br/>
understand it FIRST the written notation will never take them 180 days to <br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
How many people feel sure they are NOT musicians, and won&#39;t even pick up an <br/>
instrument, because of early failures to understand how to read musical <br/>
notation?  It&#39;s a shame, that so many teachers have taught people to hate <br/>
their subject matter.<br/>

&lt;&lt; In school I always got all the answers right,,,except the word problems and<br/>
I missed them all.  I had a 4.0 gpa and I am so lousy at math that now,<br/>
years later, I don&#39;t even remember the first thing about simple algebra.<br/>
They would give a whole page of problems and maybe 4 word problems at the<br/>
bottom.  If you missed those you could still get a good grade.  I never<br/>
understood the theories. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I always understood the word problems.  They were the only part I liked and <br/>
&quot;got.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I would use the word problems first (often #29 and #30, with the <br/>
other 28 being just the same layout of &quot;number problems) and from <br/>
understanding the word problem, I got an idea what the heck those little <br/>
columns of numbers, or those equations were supposed to represent.<br/>
<br/>
But I often figured out the answers with words and ideas, too, and didn&#39;t <br/>
&quot;show my work,&quot; so I did great on standardized (multiple-guess) tests on <br/>
math, but got really frustrated in classes and with math teachers who looked <br/>
at me blankly when I&#39;d ask &quot;What is this good for in the real world?&quot;  Or <br/>
they would say something insipid like &quot;Well you have to pass algebra I so you <br/>
can take algebra II.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
That was NOT remotely the &quot;real world&quot; about which I was (regularly) <br/>
inquiring.<br/>

<br/>
Well, I don&#39;t &quot;try&quot; to integrate it...it&#39;s all around us.<br/>
Let&#39;s see.<br/>
We did go to a science museum today, just for fun. Outside, during lunch, <br/>
Jared found a fuzzy seed pod of some kind and brought them home. They played <br/>
with sticks, watched boats on the canal behind us, watched birds, played on <br/>
the playground equipment etc....<br/>
Science was all around us. Just the act of observation is a scientific tool.<br/>
Math?<br/>
In a typical week you&#39;ll find my children budgeting and counting their money, <br/>
comparison shopping with same money, measuring while helping me cook or bake, <br/>
counting things in the woods, estimating how much money they will save by the <br/>
conference.......and so on.<br/>
Real life is full of science and math. If you live and give kids access to <br/>
their world, they can&#39;t get away from it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; And lots of people here probably shut down after they saw the first number<br/>
 ;-) The exact process I used wasn&#39;t important. The important part is getting<br/>
 the problem simple enough that I can do it easily in my head. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
My 8y.o. ds, with not a single math hang up, asked me what 14 X 4 was the <br/>
other day.  I told him that two fourteens was (and he popped in with 28), and <br/>
then I pointed out that 4 14&#39;s was just two 28&#39;s then.....and he got it.<br/>
I hear him manipulating and playing around with numbers all the time. It&#39;s so <br/>
fascinating to me, watching this child that has never had a math lesson <br/>
(other than my showing him place value).<br/>
<br/>
I can actually remember as a child in school, that I could get the right <br/>
answer but get my problem marked wrong if I did the PROCESS different than <br/>
the one they were trying to teach us.<br/>
One time, my Dad (who is very good with math) showed me a really great way to <br/>
do division, but it didn&#39;t use the process they showed and so I had to re-do <br/>
the entire sheet.<br/>
If the whole point is getting people to use math proficiently, it shouldn&#39;t <br/>
matter one whit how they get their.  But the whole point of schools isn&#39;t to <br/>
help people gain proficiency anyway, silly me!!<br/>
It&#39;s been proven to me time and again, by these sweet children I&#39;ve been <br/>
blessed with, that math is natural. That letting them roll things around and <br/>
use it irl makes it fun and they don&#39;t need to put it to paper until they <br/>
want to!<br/>
It works.<br/>
That&#39;s all I care about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916488154">quick question regarding that &quot;math&quot; topic.<br/>
 Just wondering, if you don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; math and your state requires testing, how will they know the material they need to know for the test regarding basic and intro geometry, algebra, or lets say even division if they haven&#39;t &quot;learned&quot; it yet?  My state doesn&#39;t require testing (whew) and I completely hate the idea of teachers &quot;teaching to the test&quot; but I&#39;m just curious how others unschool with math if their state has requirements.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-206400086">Some people don&#39;t register with the state.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents teach their kids tricks for guessing well.  Standardized tests <br/>
are multiple choice, and so it&#39;s not REALLY dividing formally and showing all <br/>
your work, it&#39;s eliminating the wrong answers.<br/>
<br/>
Some states don&#39;t care about the resultant scores.<br/>
<br/>
Some states allow home-administered testing.<br/>
<br/>
If a child isn&#39;t able to read the questions, they can be read to him.  At <br/>
home that&#39;s easy.  In a state with more formal requirements, you might have <br/>
to pay a counselor or psychologist to do that if you truly wanted to be <br/>
aboveboard.<br/>

I have a math question.  We seem to get into the wildest math concepts here,<br/>
just by living.  We had fun with irrational numbers last week (they&#39;re my<br/>
favorite); fractions, decimals, etc. all seem to come up around here<br/>

cool patterns you get with things like 11&#39;s (22,33,44,55, etc.) and 9&#39;s<br/>

is completely lost at the idea of borrowing when subtracting, and other more<br/>
elementary concepts.  Of course, these are things way beyond what a 6 year<br/>

Just speaking from my own experience, I have found that math is one of <br/>
those<br/>
subjects that you don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; until you &quot;get&quot; it, and there is no real <br/>
order that is better than the other.  For example, most schools teach <br/>
algebra-&gt;trig-&gt;calculus, with<br/>
the implied assumption that you will completely understand one before <br/>
moving on to the<br/>
next.  However, for me, I didn&#39;t really &quot;get&quot; trig until I was completely <br/>
done with<br/>
calculus, and same with algebra.  I think it&#39;s because the following <br/>
subject gives an<br/>
applied use of the theoretical concepts presented in the previous one, and <br/>
that gave me the tools to play around with and understand the &quot;why&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that makes sense!<br/>

YES!! It&#39;s fine for a kid to understand percentages before he knows fractions.<br/>
<br/>
And guess what??  I have kids who can do some pretty cool math in their <br/>
heads, but Marty is 13 and just lately asked me about some of the symbol keys <br/>
on the computer.  He didn&#39;t know the marks for division or multiplication.  <br/>
But he can calculate things in his head.<br/>
<br/>
This morning Holly and I were talking about allowances.  She&#39;s 11 now and so <br/>
has gone up to $8.25 from $7.50.  She misses being able to sing the <br/>
Schoolhouse Rock song about &quot;Seven fifty once a week&quot; and it be true, but <br/>
that&#39;s fine.  We were talking about allowance in general and why we didn&#39;t <br/>
make it 50 cents or a dollar per year of age, and I said Keith was afraid we <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be able to afford it when they were all teens.  I asked her what the <br/>
total was now, thinking she might know offhand.  She&#39;s that kind of kid.<br/>
<br/>
She started figuring it in her head.  I said &quot;I&#39;ll race you!&quot;  So first she <br/>
figured out each kid&#39;s allowance.  I wrote it down just to help her.  She was <br/>
still adding in her head, and I wrote down 16, 13, 11 and added them.  GOOD!  <br/>
Even.  40.   75% of 40 is easy; $30.  She had 30 too.<br/>
<br/>
$30 a week we pay out in allowance.  The average is toward Kirby, until after <br/>
Marty&#39;s birthday in January.  Right now Marty&#39;s at $9.75.  Each week I give <br/>
him a ten, and he gives me a quarter.  Sometimes it was my quarter.  I never <br/>
care.  He&#39;s generous with money and always brings me change and a receipt <br/>
when he goes on an errand.<br/>

subtract 6.59 from 8.60, obviously you can&#39;t take 9 pennies from nothing.<br/>
So you change the 6 dimes to 5 dimes and 10 pennies.  Then you can take 9<br/>
pennies away from that.  If he works a few out with real money, he&#39;ll<br/>
probably be able to do it on paper as well.<br/>

Yes yes yes!!!!<br/>
With unschooling nothing is typical and everything goes. Orders don&#39;t count <br/>
because there mostly isn&#39;t any. It depends on the child and what their <br/>
interests are. You stated that you have favorites in math and from the sound <br/>
of it, so does your son. It&#39;s only natural for him to excel at what he likes <br/>
and to save the other stuff for later, if at all. If math continues to be a <br/>
point of interest for him, he&#39;ll pick up all the other stuff at another <br/>
time.<br/>

visiting.  The oldest boy had been really turned off math in his 2 years of<br/>
school.  Some time after leaving school, he started a project all on his own<br/>
of doubling numbers.  1+1+2, 2+2+4, etc.  When he finished the trillions, he<br/>
had to ask his mother what came next.  After the quadrillions, they had to<br/>
look up what came next.  He got bored with the project during the<br/>
quintillions.  Can you imagine a schooled kid taking on a project like that?<br/>
(No calculator was used.)  That boy has grown up to be a fine musician.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

You make a good point. But I think working with math formulas are much more involved than learning to read music simply because there are so many formulas and all are multi-step and abstract on paper.  When reading music, each of the notes always corresponds with a paritcular key.<br/>
<br/>
Though, I would say that learning to read music is kind of ridiculous if you aren&#39;t actually playing an instrument.  So, its probably equally silly to try to learn arithmetic language without the appropriate concrete application.  But I&quot;m not that great at concepts myself.<br/>
<br/>
I have a question for you (or anyone good at math).<br/>
<br/>
Why, when we are dividing fractions, do we flip the second one over and multiply?<br/>
<br/>
And how does that fit in with &quot;real&quot; fractions?<br/>
<br/>
I honestly never &quot;got&quot; that.  I memorized everything but I don&#39;t get *all* the concepts.  <br/>

It&#39;s a set of symbols for a language, same as with music.  Reading music <br/>
isn&#39;t as easy as you seem to think.  If you&#39;re talking about piano, maybe <br/>
it&#39;s possible to think of one note corresponding to a particular key, but <br/>
once you get to mixed instruments, a &quot;note&quot; might not even be the same for <br/>
different instruments.  There&#39;s a lot of weird transposition.<br/>
<br/>

There are lots of kind of music and musical notation.  <br/>

<br/>
Learning English (or any native tongue---or any second language!) is best <br/>
learned with hearing first, then UNDERSTANDING, then some spoken words, THEN <br/>
reading and writing. Schools have kids reading and writing with NO <br/>
understanding. <br/>
<br/>
My husband is still in the &quot;toddler stages&quot; of German. He can understand MOST <br/>
of what&#39;s spoken. He can speak a bit, but it&#39;s broken. He can read a little. <br/>
He can write even less (if any).<br/>
<br/>
Look at math that way. After you UNDERSTAND the concept, it&#39;s really EASY to <br/>
plug in the signs and numbers. <br/>

of your non-learning days because it might be something you don&#39;t know and<br/>
you wouldn&#39;t want to take a chance ;-) Unlike English there isn&#39;t a<br/>
connection between the spoken word and the written word. You could read<br/>
Chinese without speaking it. In fact I&#39;m pretty sure the written Chinese can<br/>
be read regardless of the language one speaks. Here&#39;s something:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In China there are many different dialects. Dialects usually refer to<br/>
&gt; &quot;regional forms of a language.&quot; However, many of the regional variants which<br/>
&gt; are commonly referred to as &quot;dialects&quot; of the Chinese language are more<br/>
&gt; different from one another than French is from Spanish or Norwegian is from<br/>
&gt; Swedish! Below are some figures for different &quot;dialect groups&quot; in China:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dialect Group    Number of Speakers (approx.)<br/>
&gt; Northern(Includes Mandarin)    387,000,000<br/>
&gt; Jiangsu-Zhejiang    46,000,000<br/>
&gt; Hunan    26,000,000<br/>
&gt; Jiangsi    13,000,000<br/>
&gt; Hakka    20,000,000<br/>
&gt; Northern Min    7,000,000<br/>
&gt; Southern Min    15,000,000<br/>
&gt; Cantonese    27,000,000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One thing that makes the Chinese dialect situation unique -- that is different<br/>
&gt; from the situation confronting speakers of French and Spanish or Norwegian and<br/>
&gt; Swedish -- concerns the fact that all speakers who are literate share a common<br/>
&gt; written language. Thus, while oral forms vary greatly, written symbols can be<br/>
&gt; used to communicate effectively between speakers of different dialects.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which makes written Chinese like mathematical notation. As long as someone<br/>
understands the concepts and knows how the concepts relate to the notation,<br/>
they can read Chinese (or math). But if somene is hazy on the concepts or<br/>
doesn&#39;t understand the relationship between the concepts and the notation<br/>
then the written language isn&#39;t going to mean much.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Only in school math. Math in real life is done much more intuitively.<br/>
Educators need to break it down into memorizable steps because kids don&#39;t<br/>
understand the concepts. And since it&#39;s really tough to test for<br/>
understanding, the educators rely on testing if someone can recall something<br/>
they&#39;ve memorized.<br/>
<br/>
At the conference I was (not very successfully since I need lots of time to<br/>
gather my thoughts!) trying to explain how kids get arithmetic. I was<br/>
explaining the steps my daughter might use to add 2 largish numbers. It<br/>
would involve changing the numbers around to make them into numbers that are<br/>
easy to manipulate in your head. But the man I was explaining it to pointed<br/>
out that it was way more complex than learning to borrow and carry.<br/>
<br/>
Well it is if you were teaching it as a formula. But when it&#39;s done because<br/>
someone understands how numbers work, it&#39;s very simple.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why, when we are dividing fractions, do we flip the second one over and<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s convention. It works out that way. ;-) And that&#39;s the problem with<br/>
memorizing procedures to spit back for a test.<br/>

Think about it conceptually. If you take a whole (1) and divide it into<br/>
larger and larger numbers of pieces 1/2, 1/3, 1/27. 1/100, you get smaller<br/>
and smaller pieces. If you divide a whole into 1 piece, you&#39;ll get 1 piece<br/>
(1/1). If you divide a whole into smaller and smaller numbers of pieces<br/>
(though the normal way of describing division doesn&#39;t work so well --<br/>
dividing 1 into half a piece, or taking 1 piece out of 1/2 pieces doesn&#39;t<br/>
make much sense), the pieces should get larger and larger. In other words<br/>
they have to get bigger than one. So 1 divided by 1/2 is 2 (or 2/1 which is<br/>
1/2 flipped over.) 1 divided by 1/6 should be 6, so 2 divided by 1/6 (<br/>
2/(1/6) which is the same as 2x(6/1)) should be twice as much, so 12.<br/>
<br/>
Math needs to describe things that fall outside the realm of physical<br/>
objects. So though in some contexts it make sense to divide by numbers<br/>
smaller than 1, it doesn&#39;t make much sense to divide a plate of cookies by<br/>
1/2 a child. ;-) But it might help make the concept clearer if you tried! If<br/>
there are 5 cookies to divide by 1/2 a child, how many cookies does a whole<br/>
child get? If there are 2 cookies to divide by 1/6 of a child, how many<br/>
cookies does a whole child get? How many cookies would 3 children get?<br/>
