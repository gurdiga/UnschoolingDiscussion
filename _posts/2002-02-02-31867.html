<div id="ygrps-yiv-202017363">Hello,<br/>
OK, maybe this is too blunt, but you all are making me sad.  I just <br/>
started homeshooling my 5 and 13 year old daughter.  After trying to <br/>
do school at home, we have found that what I though was <br/>
called &quot;unschooling&quot; fits our family best.  But, we are finding that <br/>
some think unschooling is not: real learning, good for the kids, <br/>
disciplined enough, etc, etc.  Many of the families I know, through <br/>
church and through homeschooling organizations, don&#39;t agree with <br/>
unschooling and gently remind me of their opinions.<br/>
<br/>
So, why am I sad?  I finally found a group dedicated to unschooling <br/>
and you seem to be embroiled in some kind of argument.  I guess I was <br/>
hoping that I would find an oasis from having to defend myself and my <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding what&#39;s going on?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to learning from more experienced unschoolers.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, there is actual real unschooling advice that does go on here. Really!<br/>
Periodically the list does erupt into chaos. *Hopefully* we&#39;re figuring out<br/>
how to stop the fires when the sparks are lit rather than allow them to<br/>
erupt into wildfires raging out of control ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Just skip anything titled Administrative or any other title that seems<br/>
contentious for now :-) (Though the first Administrative post was the<br/>
periodic reminder of what we&#39;re supposed to be creating.)<br/>
<br/>
Have you visited the Unschooling.com website. The message boards are very<br/>
good and active. (And for some easier to read. Harder for others.)<br/>
<br/>
If people are gently reminding you of their opinions about unschooling then<br/>
you are luckier than many ;-) Though not nearly as nice as having them blink<br/>
in confusion and not able to question! Usually I don&#39;t mention unschooling.<br/>
I say we follow my daughter&#39;s interests. They probably believe we do book<br/>
work that&#39;s on the topics she&#39;s interested in, but I&#39;m not out to drag the<br/>
world to my way of thinking ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-561918977">Welcome Barbara!<br/>
I agree wit Joyce that you need to just ignore the &quot;administrative&quot; stuff<br/>
for awhile.....<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking and hoping that some members of this list will start with some<br/>
new and interesting threads and topics.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a bit worn out tonight from getting through my 7yo&#39;s birthday party.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all for the puppet ideas.  We had a wide selection from socks to<br/>
various stick figures.  The far and away favorite turned out to be a full<br/>
body made from a thin grade of cardboard (actually,  cereal boxes,  etc.)<br/>
The kids them made clothes from pipes cleaners,  old yarn,  felt,  glitter<br/>
glue).   Later in the party,  some of the kids put on a puppet show.  They<br/>
took them home as favors.<br/>
<br/>
DD got a simple marionette and a stuufed horse puppet also to add to our<br/>
&#39;collection&#39;  of puppets.<br/>
<br/>
It was cold,  but sunny,  and they were able to get creative on our old<br/>
picninc table in the back yard...making cleanup bearable.<br/>
<br/>
It was pretty fun,  actually....though I wish I had known which type would<br/>
be so popular....and I wish I hadn&#39;t procrastinated so long in pulling<br/>
things together.<br/>
<br/>
Next b-day party I think we&#39;ll have the little ones make/decorate picture<br/>
frames...and I&#39;ll take photos on my digital camera (new toy for me from<br/>
Christmas)....If I plan well,  I&#39;ll be ready to print out their photo and<br/>
send it home as a favor.<br/>
<br/>
Oh,  we made a castle cake...white chocolate fudge....very yummy and a BIG<br/>
HIT with everyone.<br/>
My youngsters got to decorate it this a.m. with various candies.<br/>
<br/>
TTFN,<br/>
