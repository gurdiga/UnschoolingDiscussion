<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265176133">I&#39;ll introduce myself, going with the current trend.. <br/>
I tend to ramble on quite a lot, so please skim liberally: <br/>
<br/>
Hi, I&#39;m Summer! I&#39;m sixteen, I&#39;ve been unschooled since 4th grade with<br/>
occasional unrewarding forays into parent-led or classroom education. <br/>
<br/>
I live in Austin, Texas where there is an amazing secular homeschool group<br/>
called Austin Area Homeschoolers that has a couple hundred families. I&#39;ve<br/>
found socialization to not be a problem at *all* -- not even &quot;less of a<br/>
problem than it&#39;s made out to be&quot;, no... Actually, it&#39;s one of the reasons why<br/>
I love my life so much -- I don&#39;t think I would be as happy in a school social<br/>
scene. Maybe my group is unique or whatever, but we have at least 40 active<br/>
teens, and more total, plus I&#39;m friends with many of the younger kids and<br/>
adults. There&#39;s &quot;even&quot; a fairly active, but not rushed, dating scene. <br/>
<br/>
And, on top of all that, I have teenage unschooled friends all over the<br/>
country because of Grace Llewellyn&#39;s utopian, life-changing camp, Not Back To<br/>
School Camp -- which just got it&#39;s own domain name, for any who are<br/>
interested... Camp is full this year, but Grace is also running a very<br/>
interesting sounding community camp -- http://www.nbtsc.org <br/>
<br/>
Aside from my social life, which I could ramble on about for quite some time,<br/>
I intern at a computer company called GirlGames Inc. that makes CD-Roms and<br/>
websites for the pre-teen and teenage girl market (http://www.girlgames.com)<br/>
-- I mostly write quizzes, fashion profiles, and the like, and I also do some<br/>
web design and graphic stuff there, as well as the occasional inane office<br/>
task. In any case, it&#39;s an awesome place to be three times a week, and I&#39;m<br/>
learning a lot. <br/>
<br/>
I also have my own webpage, which is currently at<br/>
http://www.bga.com/~melissab, but will soon be going through an identity<br/>
crisis and moving to it&#39;s own domain name -- the old address hasn&#39;t been<br/>
updated since December because I&#39;ve been working on the new one.<br/>
 <br/>
I take drama, mostly Shakespeare, and act as much as possible -- it&#39;s becoming<br/>
a true love. I&#39;m obsessed with the aformentioned author, Mr. Shakespeare, in<br/>
particular with Hamlet and it&#39;s character Ophelia -- I have a website<br/>
dedicated to her, too, and often find myself &quot;dashing off&quot; pages of text to<br/>
the requests for Ophelia paper ideas or research help that flood my mailbox. <br/>
<br/>
I write. A lot. Mostly poetry, some songs, a few stories. I&#39;ve had a couple<br/>
poems appear in the London based Quaker newsletter &quot;The Friend&quot;, although I&#39;m<br/>
agnostic and don&#39;t go to a Quaker church, the editor wanted to publish me..<br/>
:-).. I&#39;ve also performed some of them, and a song, at the talent show at<br/>
camp, and I&#39;ve had a few letters to the editor published in local papers. <br/>
<br/>
My west-african drumming lessons ended a few months ago, much to my dismay,<br/>
but I do drum a lot. <br/>
<br/>
I play soccer, and skate. I used to ride horses but the stable I was riding<br/>
(and working at) lost it&#39;s best instructor and my beloved horse, so I&#39;m taking<br/>
a break and hoping my friend Kate will start a novice vaulting (gymnastics on<br/>
horseback) team soon. <br/>
<br/>
I take a lot of pictures, although my latest role of people camping out for<br/>
Star Wars hasn&#39;t been developed yet. Art is an obsession I gleamed from my<br/>
mother, who&#39;s a freelance artist. From my dad I got a love of pop culture, and<br/>
I&#39;ll admit that I get pretty caught up in that whole movies-and-celebs thing.<br/>
Also from my dad, a love of politics -- we lived in Washington for 18 months<br/>
while he worked for the President, and I am currently scrambling to convince<br/>
my friends that they MUST register and vote for Al Gore in 2000... I love<br/>
debating politics, and other issues... <br/>
<br/>
Like animal rights. I&#39;m a vegetarian, and have been for a long time before<br/>
anyone else in my family was (my parents converted after my dad&#39;s heart attack<br/>
in Feb., and have both become totally trim and healthy to the hospital&#39;s<br/>
shock.) A lot of my friends disagree with me about AR stuff, I have some<br/>
pretty radical views -- but I love defending them. The same goes for youth<br/>
rights, a natural outgrowth of unschooling in a way -- I hold the view that<br/>
the voting age should be lowered to at the very least to include teenagers who<br/>
pay income tax, and I believe in the loosening of laws that allow parents to<br/>
basically do whatever they want to their kids, including forcing them to work<br/>
& hand over their paychecks to mom and dad.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m straight-edge, although not by culture. I simply use it as a catch-all<br/>
term for the fact that I don&#39;t eat meat, smoke, drink, or do illegal drugs,<br/>
and never plan to. Unlike the above, this isn&#39;t a belief that I think most<br/>
people &quot;should&quot; adopt -- it&#39;s simply a choice I&#39;ve made for myself.. Actually,<br/>
I&#39;m for the legalization of some drugs, and the fact that I never plan to<br/>
drink surprises a lot of people... Including, I think, my parents. :-) <br/>
<br/>
I recently took a research paper writing class from a homeschool group parent<br/>
and professor -- it was really fun and interesting. I wrote my paper on...<br/>
*are you ready for this?*... hip-hop & Shakespeare -- kind of testing the idea<br/>
of merging fields or ideas that seem opposing or just radically different. It<br/>
explored the benefits of using hip-hop to teach Shakespeare in the classroom,<br/>
stuff like that. Like I said, the class was a very interesting experience.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I feel as if I&#39;ve gone on long enough... I just really enjoy sharing<br/>
my incredibly positive experiences as an unschooler with other people who are<br/>
like-minded (at least about one thing!) <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve enjoyed the discussions thus far, and I hope I didn&#39;t bore you TOO much. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, one last thing.. I think this marks about the fifth mailing list that Eryn<br/>
and I are both on. :-) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-11235686">Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I just joined your list yesterday and figured i&#39;d read a few days to <br/>
get caught up with the subjects being discussed before introducing <br/>
myself.  But already on the second day, I am so excited to have found <br/>
this group that I don&#39;t even know where to start.<br/>
<br/>
I am a work-at-home Mom of a very spirited three year old (May 27th) <br/>
son, Sterling.  I have my own fast-paced business that requires long hours and <br/>
demands lots of attention, ironically very much like my son!  &lt;G&gt;  <br/>
So between the two, i&#39;m usually pretty crazy by the end of the day.  <br/>
then add in variable #3 - dh who retired from the air force but works <br/>
two part-time jobs with unpredictable, irratic schedules.  and of <br/>
course there&#39;s all those other projects - well, won&#39;t get into that <br/>
right now.<br/>
<br/>
I guess in the back of my mind, I&#39;ve always known that if i want the <br/>
best thing for my son that i will have to home-school.  but i still <br/>
continue to have the ongoing battle in my mind of why i should <br/>
home-school vs. why he should maybe go to school.  As he&#39;s getting <br/>
older, I&#39;ve begun to research a little more actively and suddenly <br/>
came to the realization that i already have been &quot;unschooling&quot; him <br/>
since he was an infant!  <br/>
<br/>
Sterling has always been very advanced for his age, very alert, very <br/>
active and tireless.  He loves to learn, has a great imagination, <br/>
asks questions that are well beyond his years and is constantly <br/>
shocking me, has amazing logical reasoning and problem solving <br/>
skills.  Most days, i have a hard time keeping up with him, mentally <br/>
and physically.  so i have to seriously ask myself - &quot;just how lost <br/>
will a child like this be in a conventional school system?&quot;.  I know <br/>
if i try to answer that question, it will only result in a lot of <br/>
negative criticism of the school system and that is not my intend <br/>
here.  I just can&#39;t see the school system as i know it being able to <br/>
provide the stimulation and learning environment that he not only <br/>
needs, but demands.  I don&#39;t ever want to put him into a situation <br/>
that will squash his love of learning, rather than nuture it or cause <br/>
him to be labeled as disruptive or distracted (or worse - ADD) <br/>
because he&#39;s bored or does not conform to a standard, structured<br/>
learning style.  <br/>
<br/>
Although I have only read posts here for two days, I sense that other <br/>
parents here are making choices to home-school for very similiar <br/>
reasons and not exclusively religious reasons.  With over 200 members <br/>
i&#39;m sure many also choose for religious reasons but that the <br/>
discussions here include a very wide spectrum of unschooling issues that <br/>
parents face in pursuit of unschooling their children.  I can&#39;t tell <br/>
you how excited I am at the thought that i&#39;ve found a network of <br/>
people that can relate on this level of unschooling and actually feel <br/>
a big sigh of relief.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I have found a place to learn so much from others and hope <br/>
that i will be able to offer something of value in return.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for being out there!!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to the list!  The school system, in general, is a lot less nimble and <br/>
dedicated than you are.  If you can barely keep up, it&#39;s hard for me to <br/>
imagine the school system being able to really satisfy your son. <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s great that you have a head start on thinking about your son&#39;s <br/>
schooling needs.  You can start gradually researching and planning now in <br/>
your little bits of free time, but I&#39;d like you to promise NOT to start <br/>
worrying until he&#39;s at least 5.  You can wear yourself out that way, and it <br/>
doesn&#39;t help.<br/>
<br/>
I encourage you to find a support group and meet some homeschoolers in your <br/>
area, even if you or your husband can only attend park days sporadically <br/>
because of your schedules.  Most homeschoolers that I have met are great kids <br/>
and they play with kids of other ages pretty readily.  And many HS groups <br/>
will have 3 year olds, because primary grade kids do have younger brothers <br/>
and sisters.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  thanks and i know what you mean about wearing out.  but in my <br/>
original post i made the little comment that i realized i had been <br/>
unschooling Sterling since he was an infant?  I was serious and meant <br/>
it literlly.  and it&#39;s also part of what already wears me out! &lt;G&gt;  <br/>
He already knew his alphabet just a tad over a year old.  some of <br/>
them he couldn&#39;t even say correctly yet and made up names he could <br/>
pronounce! like &quot;W&quot; - that&#39;s another story.   He can count to 30 <br/>
without looking at the numbers and to 100 when looking at them.  he&#39;s <br/>
doing simple math and starting to read.  none of this is because i <br/>
sat down and taught him.  he just learned it from various activities <br/>
we did in an effort to keep him as busy as he demanded to be.<br/>
<br/>
   the &quot;busy and wearing him out&quot; is also part of the reason i <br/>
decided to try him a pre-school while battling with my conscious of <br/>
whether to home-school or not.  he&#39;s way beyond the academics for <br/>
pre-school but that was not my purpose for sending him anyhow and <br/>
planned to remain his primary educator.  i found a pre-school that <br/>
accepts part-time attendance, minimum 2 days a week.  they recognize <br/>
various learning styles unlike many and their overall philosophy and <br/>
teaching methods happen to lean towards Sterling&#39;s learning style.  I <br/>
was sending him more for the reason of &quot;something different to do&quot; <br/>
and &quot;please help me wear him out!&quot;.  &lt;G&gt;  He gets a little change of <br/>
scenery and other kids to do activities with.  He started in June and <br/>
LOVES it! but he also still loves the more advanced stuff he does <br/>
with Mom and insists on doing certain things we normally do together.<br/>
on the other hand, i am also being realistic that eventually the public<br/>
school will say &quot;all or nothing&quot; and i will have to either fully unschool<br/>
or go with the public school and i know they will not be anything <br/>
like his pre-school.<br/>

and I actually found this list through another homeschooler that i met <br/>
at Sterling&#39;s gymnastics class the other day.  the gal at the desk <br/>
asked if Sterling was going to pre-school this year as she handed me <br/>
their new fall schedule.  i mentioned homeschooling, and another gal <br/>
overheard me and came over to talk to me.  i thought it was great! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451428083">Welcome Michele!<br/>
I&#39;ve been on this list-mostly lurking-for several months and saw your <br/>
reference to the PSK loop.  Silly me, as if I don&#39;t have enough to read, I <br/>
just joined  Parents of Spirited Kids.<br/>
I have 2 dd&#39;s, ages 2 & 6--both highly spirited ...some well-meaning parents <br/>
have commented that they act more &quot;like boys&quot; than girls ( I assumed the <br/>
stereotypical calm, shy, sugary type)--which is farrrrr from these two...  <br/>
And that is one of the reasons we unschool.<br/>

Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I just joined your list yesterday and figured i&#39;d read a few days to<br/>
get caught up with the subjects being discussed before introducing<br/>
myself.  But already on the second day, I am so excited to have found<br/>
this group that I don&#39;t even know where to start.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I have found a place to learn so much from others and hope<br/>
that i will be able to offer something of value in return.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for being out there!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859029800">Hi Stephanie - glad to have you here.  I always enjoy hearing what <br/>
brought people to homeschooling/unschooling.  Interesting that so <br/>
many paths can lead to the same place.  I recently saw a program on <br/>
television with a segment on selective mutism.  I had never heard of <br/>
it before.  What a challenge that must be.  Hope you enjoy your time <br/>
here.<br/>

My name is Stephanie, wife (and best friend) to Ron, mother to Martin 9yos, <br/>
James 7yos, Stacie 5yod, and Tiffany 4yod. We have been &quot;learning&quot; since I <br/>
found out that I was pregnant, but officially schooling since June. A great <br/>
many things have happened in our lives to bring us to the homeschooling <br/>
environment, including my 9 yos being approached about smoking, the recent <br/>
bombing of a local school, two children being bored in school, and my <br/>
youngest having Selective Mutism. We do have Math 65 for the oldest, who is <br/>
having trouble in mathematics. Other than that, we use life, worksheets, <br/>
computer, and just about anything in our journey to discover us. I am looking <br/>
forward to learning all that I can, and I am hoping that this is a place for <br/>
my family to be.<br/>

Diane-<br/>
Would that program have been 20/20? I had both of my girls in Headstart last <br/>
year. Tiffany&#39;s teacher saw us in Super Kmart 2 weeks ago and told us about <br/>
the program. I went into the search and dug up all of the information that I <br/>
could on the subject. It is suprising how much she fits the &quot;mold&quot;. I am <br/>
ADHD, my 7 yos is ADD, and my oldest would have been diagnosed ADD this year <br/>
I am sure. I am so happy to be out of the system. I refuse to go to the <br/>
school to have my daughter tested, because that is how the schools try to get <br/>
you on abuse. Not this mom. We do it one day at a time, and try to keep <br/>
everything so that the children and Mommy can deal with everything. I am <br/>
starting my own business this fall, and I am hoping that this will make the <br/>
transition easier on the children. They have done exceptionally well so far. <br/>
Both dh and I have been home for the summer, and we are trying to keep it <br/>
that way. <br/>
Sorry that I got so long...&lt;smile&gt;<br/>

  How fun!  After our wedding I had considered becoming a wedding <br/>
consultant or some such thing.  I really enjoyed putting it together and<br/>
getting the most bang for my (dads &lt;g&gt;) buck.   Then I realised I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be happy if the bride didn&#39;t like my ideas.  I like your idea of wedding <br/>
accessories!<br/>
   My dh is a contractor and sometimes he works  a lot, <br/>
other times he is home a lot.  We like it when he is home.  He tends <br/>
to do lots of things in the shop or home improvement and we like him <br/>
around.  He doesn&#39;t get underfoot at all.  Although sometimes he tells us, <br/>
&quot;I gotta get a job&quot; LOL.  Gets a bit chaotic with three littles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138225677">Hi Amy:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any great ideas for you, but just wanted to say hello because<br/>
we are in Mass. also, but in the south central part. I have one boy who<br/>
will be 7 very soon and this is our first year at home. The one thing I am<br/>
learning to do is leave the housework and enjoy our activities instead. It<br/>
hasn&#39;t been easy to do, but I am trying really hard to make the most of the<br/>
times when my son actually wants to do something, even if I had other<br/>
household chores planned. I found it took time for my son to become more<br/>
self-directed after having been in school even for just a little while. <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656248163">Hi all.  I&#39;m a homeschooling (past 4 yrs) mom of 2 girls (10 and 6). I&#39;m<br/>
a nervous homeschooler and I&#39;m constantly changing curriculum to see if<br/>
it&#39;s better than the last.  As a result, my 10 yr. old is not on grade<br/>
level and hates math.  My 6 yr. old was real interested in reading until<br/>
I started teaching phonics, now she has no desire.  All I really want is<br/>
for them to love learning not hate it.  So that brought me here. I&#39;ve<br/>
read all I could online and off about unschooling and though I&#39;m<br/>
terrified I&#39;m going to do it.  My dh is part of my worries; he has to<br/>
see results.  He expects genuises since I homeschool and I don&#39;t know if<br/>
he&#39;ll have the patience to wait on Raven to read when she&#39;s 10.  I also<br/>
have a serious pet peeve.  Why is it when you homeschool people HAVE to<br/>
test your kids?  I went to a book store and a library yesterday.  My 10<br/>
yr. old asked the lady how much a book was.  The woman said half the<br/>
retail and asked Courtney what is half of $5 and Courtney stammered a<br/>
little and said I don&#39;t know and then she told her.  At the library, my<br/>
6 yr old was asked to say her alphabet and write her name.  (She was<br/>
getting a card so I understand the writing part).  Is it me being too<br/>
defensive?  Am I going to be able to handle unschooling with my fears?<br/>
Sorry so long, I just needed to get that out.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
