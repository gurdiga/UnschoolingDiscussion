<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248014853">I like having my office at the university and going in where I can<br/>
accomplish something and have it totally finished and not to be undone by<br/>
someone else.  I can clear off my desk and it stays that way.  I also like<br/>
fooling people into thinking that I&#39;m an expert at something, especially<br/>
on those days when I&#39;m told at home that I can&#39;t even cut a pbj sandwich<br/>
right or that i&#39;ve tied some shoes wrong *again*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-507867644">There are pluses and minuses of having the home business... For me the pluses <br/>
outweigh the minuses...  I can do my business whenever I want, so I get to be <br/>
with my kids when I want too.  I can make more money than something going out <br/>
to work for someone else because I control how much I charge.   I can close <br/>
my office door and say I don&#39;t feel like working today, which I cannot do <br/>
working for someone else.  I get to make my own decisions about what kind of <br/>
work I do, rather than doing what someone else is telling me.  <br/>
<br/>
Working for other people is what comes from being institutionalized in <br/>
schools.  Remember what schools were set up for... obedience to the state, <br/>
obedience of soldiers to the army, obedience of clerks to the government.  <br/>
That&#39;s what we churn out in schools and yet some of us still manage to break <br/>
away from that mold.<br/>
<br/>
Working for other people is a mind set... Why can&#39;t you do what you love and <br/>
make money at it?  There is no reason except that nobody has shown you how <br/>
you can incorporate making money into your life.  Making money is not a <br/>
separate entity from living. <br/>
<br/>
IMHO<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-813629068">I can certainly understand how external praise from others seems to be <br/>
important.  However I get that from the fact that my business is still in <br/>
business.  I think external praise is something we have learned from being <br/>
institutionalized ourselves.  We are taught to care about what others think <br/>
of us, rather than what we think of ourselves and whether we are doing a good <br/>
&quot;job&quot; whether we are cleaning the toilet or running being Prime Minister of <br/>
England.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, this is just plain wrong!  IMO.  There are lots of things I do and <br/>
others do that we enjoy and choose to do and yet they introduce a certain <br/>
amount of stress into our lives.  <br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see, today, there was helping my husband with his biz stuff, raising my <br/>
kids, upgrading my computer, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I am going to go soak in a tub if I can manage it but I enjoyed and needed to <br/>
do all of those things today.<br/>
