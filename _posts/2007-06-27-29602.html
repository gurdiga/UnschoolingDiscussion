<div id="ygrps-yiv-706371383">Ok so I&#39;m not proud of my behavior and I&#39;m not sure how to handle <br/>
this.  This morning Max over flowed the toilet in my bathroom by <br/>
putting too much toilet paper down it.  I freaked out (I don&#39;t do <br/>
bathrooms, hubby does all that side of cleaning as it makes me <br/>
physically sick)... I was angry and annoyed at having to use the <br/>
plunger and made him clean it all up with towels etc and I know I <br/>
was shaming to him...<br/>
<br/>
I felt so bad afterwards and then he went out with friends and DH <br/>
picked him up and they are still out now.<br/>
<br/>
I know I need to apologize to him for freaking out and would really <br/>
appreciate some words of wisdom on how to handle that.  <br/>
<br/>
I have apologized in the past if I&#39;d have inappropriate behavior, <br/>
but help this time would be great.<br/>
<br/>
Namaste<br/>

Think of what you would say to an adult friend if you had similarly  <br/>
lost it.<br/>
And think of what you would have liked to have heard from your own  <br/>
mom if you were a kid who got overly yelled at and freaked out upon.<br/>
