 </span></blockquote>Oh, shudder....don&#39;t make me think about moving books. :-O  When we *moved* <br/>
here 8 years ago, we had to hire an extra U-Haul trailer (plus the Big Truck, <br/>
plus the BIGGER TRUCK, plus the car-hitch) just to haul the boxes of books...<br/>
<br/>
 And now we&#39;ve been steadily accumulating more ever since.  We&#39;ve used up <br/>
nearly all the available wall space with bookshelves (although I haven&#39;t yet <br/>
convinced the family to let me start running them *perpendicular* to the <br/>
wall, in bays, like a library....I dream of this, though. &lt;g&gt;)....and I have <br/>
over 40 lidded paper boxes stacked against an outside &quot;load-bearing&quot; wall <br/>
(does it ever!), unshelved. <br/>
<br/>
  The ceiling has collapsed (Hey!  Just *small* holes....only 2 by 2, at the <br/>
worst! ;-) in two rooms from the weight in the attic, too.  And I&#39;ve noticed <br/>
that cracks are developing in the downstairs plaster, especially in the upper <br/>
corners of the walls, too....<br/>
<br/>
  The Fall of the House of Usher ain&#39;t got NOTHING on what&#39;s gonna happen <br/>
here, soon, I bet. <br/>

&quot;To announce that there must be no criticism of the president, or that we are <br/>
to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and <br/>
servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.&quot;<br/>

Keith wanted to do that in our library, and I said NO!  Not just no, but hell <br/>
no.  FINALLY we have one large floorspace, and I would rather rotate books in <br/>
and out than do that!<br/>
<br/>
Our old house was small and books were in every room.  Now we have a <br/>
garage-sized room over the garage (no coincidence, that size &lt;g&gt;) and shelves <br/>
on most wall spaces.   In the den, next biggest room, the big shelf built to <br/>
go on the wall has videos and DVDs, and books about movies and TV shows and <br/>
such.   Monty Python episode guides.  Black Adder scripts.   <br/>
<br/>
Cookbooks and food books are in the kitchen (far corner from the stove).  <br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;ve only been here five years, and I DO expect encroachment. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I&#39;m enjoying greatly the fact that google.com works better <br/>
than my former pile of needs-updating reference materials.  New dictionaries, <br/>
Videohound guide, New York Library reference, almanac...  those have gotten <br/>
outdated, and we use the internet.  That savings will about cover my AOL <br/>
expense soon.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m buying fewer books than I used to buy, and we&#39;ve been using the library <br/>
some (because I wanted to read a couple of things I couldn&#39;t find used, is <br/>
the honest truth, but it&#39;s like a siphon, for Holly--she knows what she wants <br/>
to get when we take each batch back).<br/>
