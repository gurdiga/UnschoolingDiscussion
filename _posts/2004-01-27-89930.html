I was also wondering about Pam&#39;s daughter&#39;s (potential) situation. <br/>
Would living in Wisconsin for a year give one Wisconsin residency? <br/>
Would it wipe out one&#39;s California residency?<br/>

My daughter attended college out of State.  This was in 1998.  To qualify for <br/>
&quot;in-state&quot; tuition one must provide proof of residency, such as drivers <br/>
license, car registration, voting registration, paying into the state income tax <br/>
from your job.  As far as proving she was &quot;independent&quot; from us, they required a <br/>
lot of the same things, proof of residency in HER name, drivers license that <br/>
reflected that addresses, phone bills etc.  They really didn&#39;t go by our <br/>
income tax because students CAN and DO become independent after taxes are filed.  <br/>
So if say last year you claimed your child, they now are 18, have moved out of <br/>
your home and are no longer your dependent, have filed the FASA form and can <br/>
prove they are working and paying their own way, then they are considered <br/>
independent. <br/>
<br/>
DON&#39;T however try to claim then next year on your taxes as a dependent.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of children/young adults become &quot;on their own&quot; at the age of 18 by <br/>
choice for some and by necessity by others.<br/>
<br/>
In our particular situation it didn&#39;t really matter because my daughter was <br/>
on scholarship for almost all her tuition amounts, but we did check into it <br/>
after her freshman year, just in case her scholarships were not renewed.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of her friends went this route to get &quot;in state&quot; tuition and some even <br/>
went to work locally after graduation to participate in the tuition forgiving <br/>
plan the State/Federal government offers to students.<br/>
<br/>
This was fairly recent so I thought it might help some.  We live in VA and <br/>
our daughter went to college in NC.  Our youngest son is looking into attending <br/>
WVA and he will NOT be getting scholarships so is looking into becoming <br/>
independent for his FASA form for next year.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, you can fill out the FASA form online for free and have it sent to all <br/>
the colleges that you choose.  Do it early, as they tend to run out of funds the <br/>
closer it gets to the term you&#39;ve applied for.<br/>
<br/>
Also, while State schools may seem a bargain compared to the cost of tuition <br/>
at private schools, don&#39;t rule them out.  We paid less for a 26,000.00 per <br/>
year private college than we would have paid if our daughter had gone to a State <br/>
school here in VA.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-457497251">These are the questions the student has to answer on the FAFSA to <br/>
determine whether or not he/she is going to be considered &quot;independent&quot; <br/>
for financial aid purposes - it no longer is determined by how much <br/>
parental support a kid has received. It is FAR more difficult to be <br/>
classified as &quot;independent&quot; for financial aid purposes than it was some <br/>
years ago. Just moving out and living on your own will NOT get you into <br/>
the &quot;independent&quot; category.<br/>
<br/>
	• 	Were you born before January 1, 1981?<br/>
	• 	Will you be enrolled in a master&#39;s or doctoral program (beyond a <br/>
bachelor&#39;s degree) during the upcoming academic year?<br/>
	• 	Are you married? (Answer &quot;Yes&quot; if you are separated but not <br/>
divorced.)<br/>
	• 	Do you have children who receive more than half of their support <br/>
from you?<br/>
	• 	Do you have dependents (other than your children or spouse) who <br/>
live with you and who receive more than half of their support from you?<br/>
	• 	Are you an orphan, or are you or were you (until age 18) a <br/>
ward/dependent of the court?<br/>
	• 	Are you a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces?<br/>
<br/>
If you answered &quot;yes&quot; to any question, choose &quot;Independent&quot; below.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For residency, at the college where I teach:<br/>
<br/>
For tuition purposes, California Community Colleges are required to <br/>
determine a student’s residency. California law states that residency <br/>
is physical presence coupled with the intent to remain in California. <br/>
To  qualify for residency status, a student must have been a California <br/>
resident for one year and one day prior to the opening day of <br/>
instruction. The burden of proof to clearly demonstrate both physical <br/>
presence in California and intent to establish California residence <br/>
lies with the student.<br/>
