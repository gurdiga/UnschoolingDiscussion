<div id="ygrps-yiv-931809396">Quoting something Sandra said, about how she helps families. The shift going <br/>
on in our family is really powerful. My 10yo Megan and I have had some really <br/>
cool discussions lately. My mom loved me, but was never there for me in this <br/>
capacity. I am so thankful for these conversations between my daughter and <br/>
me. <br/>
<br/>
A lot of good ones in the car on the way somewhere, she has said she wishes <br/>
we could spend all the time in the car because we get along best and talk so <br/>
much. Some good ones have been coming at the end of an argument that would <br/>
usually not stop like this before. In other words, I would stew for a long <br/>
period of time and not be able to let go of my anger, and the opportunities <br/>
for talking it out never happened. I still struggle with this. It&#39;s hard to <br/>
stop focusing on my own feelings to be there and listen and talk with my <br/>
daughter. It&#39;s changing, though.<br/>
<br/>
We were talking today after she said something that hurt my feelings and I <br/>
got really mad and defensive. She said she hadn&#39;t meant it. I told her of <br/>
course she meant it, and she said NO. She said &quot;my mouth is an early riser <br/>
and my mind sometimes sleeps in.&quot; She said why is it that I(mom) could do <br/>
something or say something and apologize and get forgiveness, but she <br/>
couldn&#39;t? It froze me in my tracks. She is so right about so many things, it <br/>
just floors me. I have had to humble myself to her more than once when she <br/>
sees me being a hypocrite.<br/>
<br/>
We were also talking about she gets upset and starts feeling like she is <br/>
always wrong and doesn&#39;t do anything right. She always thinks I am right <br/>
about everything and loves to prove me wrong. I told her I&#39;m not and she has, <br/>
and it makes us closer, if we&#39;re honest. <br/>
<br/>
She said she wants to be an adult, and know everything. I told her I don&#39;t <br/>
know everything, I make big mistakes (the whole school portion of her life), <br/>
and I think it&#39;s more important to learn about what thrills her and know how <br/>
to find the answer to anything else, and how to learn from mistakes and not <br/>
pretend to know everything and always be right. <br/>
<br/>
We talked about how lots of kids want to be grown up, because it would mean <br/>
they have some control of their life. Instead, they exert their power on <br/>
other kids to try to feel like they are in control. She is very familiar with <br/>
that. And we were able to say that she is as close to being in contol of her <br/>
life as possible, as close to being a grown up, without the worries and fears <br/>
that children don&#39;t realize adults have. By being unschooled and living and <br/>
learning and sleeping and eating all by her own choosing. Mom still needing <br/>
to let go even more, but a long way we&#39;ve come.<br/>
<br/>
She said she wishes I would never say &quot;no&quot;, but knows that isn&#39;t realistic. I <br/>
say &quot;no&quot; a lot less than I used to, because I am not trying to control her as <br/>
much. I try to say &quot;yes&quot; more and more, which is the opposite of the way I <br/>
used to be. I used to be controlling and punitive all the time, demanding to <br/>
know who she thinks she is (caught myself saying it again the other day-- i <br/>
hate that), how dare she try to be an equal to her father and I, she should <br/>
know her place, blah blah blah. <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t like that so much anymore. I now know she is practicing for the time <br/>
when she is on her own. She needs not do as I say, not as I do. I am <br/>
modelling behavior for my kids, and never quite realized the impact before. <br/>
<br/>
While I wish I didn&#39;t have to come from negativity on our journey to peace, <br/>
it is amazing the DUH moments that I get along the way. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for everyone involved in my unschooling journey, helping heal years of <br/>
negativity and celebrating peace. <br/>
