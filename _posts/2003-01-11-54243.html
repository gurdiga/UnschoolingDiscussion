All I can think of for teaching about &quot;beauty&quot; is looking past the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for all your ideas, everyone!  I&#39;m going to file them away for next <br/>
year.  :)  I wish I had seen the mask idea earlier, because I made a <br/>
gajillion masks for Will when he was 3, 4 and 5, and so I have lots of <br/>
experience!<br/>
<br/>
We had a lot of business to conduct at this meeting, so I had a shorter time <br/>
than usual.  I really wanted them to get that everyone can have different <br/>
ideas of beauty; that &quot;beauty is in the eye of the beholder&quot;.  I took Sister <br/>
Wendy&#39;s book _My Favorite Things_ and emphasized that these were *her* <br/>
favorite things, and we talked about the things each of us thought were <br/>
beautiful.  I did want them to get they idea that beauty exists outside of <br/>
what we can see as well.  We didn&#39;t spend too much time discussing it <br/>
(because that&#39;s boring!), but I didn&#39;t have time for a craft.  <br/>
<br/>
The church where we meet has a labrynth for meditation painted on the parking <br/>
lot and so we went out to walk it.  On the way, some people were working in <br/>
the sanctuary, taking down the Christmas backdrop, and putting up a new one.  <br/>
Fortunately, one of the members saw us and asked if we were the ones looking <br/>
for &quot;the beauty in Camp Fire&quot;.  (Will had written on the whiteboard outside <br/>
our door &quot;CamP FiRE USA&quot; and I had written above it &quot;Seek Beauty in&quot;.  We try <br/>
to put the theme of the meeting on the whiteboard every week.)  He invited us <br/>
into the sanctuary and showed us the old backdrop with stars and lights and <br/>
the kids were awed by its mass and the partially disassembled view of it.  <br/>
The new backdrop was of some doves on a huge canvas, and the guy explained it <br/>
to us.  He was so forthcoming and enthusiastic about the art and what we were <br/>
doing.  We talked about the other art in the sanctuary and the architecture <br/>
and the 50 yo stained glass windows that were starting to droop at the <br/>
bottom.  <br/>
<br/>
Then we went out and walked (and ran) the labrynth, and enjoyed the BEAUTIFUL <br/>
blue sky and 35 degree weather.  :)  The guy told us a little about what the <br/>
labrynth was for (to help you meditate and pray and why it does help--he was <br/>
so great!) and one of the kids in the group who attends the church told us <br/>
about how long it took to paint it.  We talked about more beautiful things <br/>
and ideas when we got to the center of the labrynth.  <br/>
<br/>
I have learned to trust my instincts and intuition with this group, and not <br/>
overplan the meetings.  There&#39;s no way it could have been better if I had <br/>
orchestrated and asked the guy to come and meet us in the sanctuary!  I think <br/>
my unschooling ideas and experience have made me much more attuned to the <br/>
natural flow of learning and being together and not having &quot;standards of <br/>
learning&quot; and being in relationship with the kids and just having fun.  I <br/>
just try to be relaxed and trust the children.  The kids keep wanting to come <br/>
back, so that&#39;s a good thing, right?<br/>
<br/>
And I played my ukulele when we sang the Camp Fire Law song and they all said <br/>
I should get a bead for that!  :)  Good day.  Thanks again!<br/>

Glass is liquid.  That&#39;s why old mirrors get wavy and sometimes the top isn&#39;t <br/>
as reflective any more.  We had a built-in mirror in an old adobe house I <br/>
grew up in and it was a perfect example of an aged mirror. &lt;g&gt;   And (part <br/>
of) why old windows sometimes rattle at the top and the caulk or wood break <br/>
at the bottom, because gradually over 80 years the glass gets fatter at the <br/>
bottom than the top.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s slow liquid, but it&#39;s liquid.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes old windows are just wavy because they were blown (obvious) or <br/>
poured &quot;in the wild&quot; (not in a factory) but even sometimes factory glass will <br/>
show waves or distortion over time.<br/>

got married 53 years ago.  It&#39;s streaked and funny at the top, and I just <br/>
think it&#39;s so beautiful (not so easy to see myself in, but that&#39;s not <br/>
entirely a bad thing ;) ).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We had an old house in Illinois. Beautiful, wavy windows. They called them <br/>
&quot;depression windows&quot;. I thought they were supposed to look like that. I used <br/>
to get calls all the time from window companies that wanted me to upgrade my <br/>
windows with some new-fangled, easy-to-wash windows. Mine were irreplaceable! <br/>
It gave an eerily beautiful look to everything outside.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know.  Maybe they&#39;re all so old or made cheaply or the building <br/>
wasn&#39;t heated for sometime or something like that?  But most of the windows <br/>
lining the sanctuary on either side are perfectly fine until you get to the <br/>
bottom, where they are curved inwards a little.  It&#39;s not be design, that&#39;s <br/>
for sure.<br/>
