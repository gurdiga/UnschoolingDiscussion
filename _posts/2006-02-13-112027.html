<div id="ygrps-yiv-523939079">We just decided to start keeping a question notebook. We write down questions that we have, and we talk about the answers - if we don&#39;t know the answer, then we look it up as soon as possible. <br/>
   <br/>
  Most of these are from Sarah, but Logan has a few he wanted to know today. <br/>
   <br/>
  Was Anastasia a real person? Why was she and her family killed? What other countries have a monarchy? Does Spain have a monarchy? Who is in charge of England now? Why do they have both a Prime Minister AND the Queen, isn&#39;t that the same? Why isn&#39;t it? Why do they even have a Queen anymore if they don&#39;t have any power? (discussion on British line of succession) Why doesn&#39;t the US have a monarchy? Why can the Pres only be president twice? Has anyone ever been president more than twice? <br/>
   <br/>
  What is plaster? What is rubber? What is cement? What is paint made out of?<br/>
   <br/>
  What do aardvarks eat?<br/>
   <br/>
  Why do we have the internet? <br/>
   <br/>
  Why does the ceiling look like cottage cheese? <br/>
   <br/>
  What is pepper? <br/>
   <br/>
  How are photographs made?<br/>
   <br/>
  Why is gold rare? <br/>
   <br/>
  Are lizards cold blooded? Are bats warm or cold blooded? Are cats warm or cold blooded? <br/>
   <br/>
  How do lightbulbs work?<br/>
   <br/>
  What is the flu?<br/>
   <br/>
  ****If anyone wants to contribute to the list anything they can think of answering for their children today, or helping their children to find out for themselves, why not add it? It would be interesting to me to see what sorts of things have been questioned today!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-614620646">Sunday night Holly and I were in the hot tub and she asked me (out of  <br/>
the blue, it seemed) whether people actually really ever put messages  <br/>

up.  But I said I thought also people had done it just for fun, like  <br/>

Hi<br/>
   This might interest Holly and others. I watched a programme called <br/>
Coast on Monday. It&#39;s a series by the BBC and gives a tour of the <br/>
coast of the UK. It talks about the people, wildlife, geology, history <br/>
and archaeology of each section of a coastal walk.<br/>
<br/>
This time they were on the North Cornwall coast. This is one of the <br/>
best places for beachcombing in the whole of the UK. They visited a <br/>
bloke who beachcombs all the time. He had a box full of flat, orange, <br/>
rectangular plastic tags that all had telephone numbers on. It turns <br/>
out the bloke phone one of the numbers and they are tags used by US, <br/>
can&#39;t remember if it&#39;s crab or lobster, fishermen from a particular <br/>
part of the coast of the US!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906050191">When I read about Holly&#39;s message in a bottle question, I thought of <br/>
the book Paddle-to-the-Sea by Holling C. Holling.  If you&#39;re not <br/>
familiar with it, its a fictional story about a boy who carves a <br/>
wooden canoe and his instructions on the bottom and sets it off in the <br/>
spring from Nipigog, just North of the Great Lakes.  It&#39;s a great <br/>
story, and has good maps.  The canoe travels for years out to the <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
He wrote a similar story about a turtle which we have not gotten to.<br/>

We&#39;ve talked sometimes about what happens if something is thrown into  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-951468463">Christa, I immediately thought of the same book! It has been a <br/>
favorite of mine since I was a child.<br/>
<br/>
And then I thought of my dd when she was 2 dropping leaves in a <br/>

to the sea!&quot;, and I got teary thinking of her sweet toddler voice. <br/>

<br/>
There is a sweet book called The Littlest Matryoshka, it is about <br/>
the smallest sister in a set of Russian nesting dolls, she gets <br/>
knocked off of the shelf in a toy store, gets washed down a gutter, <br/>
buried by snow, picked up by a heron, etc.  The rest of the sisters <br/>
are bought by a little girl (for cheap, since the set is incomplete) <br/>
who loves them.  The littlest sister eventually makes her way to the <br/>
little girl and reunites with her sisters.  Very sweet story.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone (Elaine?) mentioned the lobster tags that a beachcomber had <br/>
found.  I just watched a show about those, they &quot;taggers&quot; want to <br/>
know where the animals are ending up, so sometimes some random tags <br/>
come with a reward, if you call and tell the researcher where you <br/>
caught the lobster or crab or whatever, they will send you a small <br/>
check.  Kinda cool.  <br/>

&gt; are bought by a little girl (for cheap, since the set is incomplete)<br/>

The Tub People, and The Doll People, both of which sound to have  <br/>
similarities to that.  She just finished re-reading The Doll People,  <br/>
and then went to The Borrowers, which is also some little people  <br/>
living within a house of people who don&#39;t know of their secret lives.<br/>

Some of my favorite dolls stories when I was a kid were by Rumer <br/>
Godden.  I especially like Miss Happiness and Miss Flower, about <br/>
building a Japanese doll house for a couple of homesick Japanese dolls <br/>
in London.  (It is aimed at kids a couple of years younger than Holly, FYI.)<br/>

and found it within a week or so, an original hardback with screen- <br/>
printed pages.  Gave it away to a really good friend of mine who  <br/>
liked girlie things.   We have a paperback copy now.  Holly doesn&#39;t  <br/>
care about age recommendations.  She&#39;s perfectly happy to go between  <br/>
My Little Pony and Stephen King.  I should put that one in her path.<br/>

&gt; When I read about Holly&#39;s message in a bottle question, I thought of <br/>
&gt; the book Paddle-to-the-Sea by Holling C. Holling.  If you&#39;re not <br/>
&gt; familiar with it, its a fictional story about a boy who carves a <br/>
&gt; wooden canoe and his instructions on the bottom and sets it off in the <br/>
&gt; spring from Nipigog, just North of the Great Lakes.  It&#39;s a great <br/>
&gt; story, and has good maps.  The canoe travels for years out to the <br/>

**I&#39;ll be looking for that one too. Rowan has read The Tub People and The<br/>
Doll People over and over.  She also liked The Meanest Doll in the World,<br/>
another story about the Doll People.  We&#39;ve been on the look-out for other<br/>
books about dolls who are alive. So far we&#39;ve found:<br/>
<br/>
Miss Happiness and Miss Flower, which she enjoyed but thought was too short.<br/>
She really liked the references to Japanese houses/clothing/etc.<br/>
<br/>
Behind the Attic Wall, which she liked a lot even though it&#39;s a little more<br/>
serious than what she usually likes and has a sad part.<br/>
<br/>
The Mennyms, which we&#39;re about half-way through.  It has one character in<br/>
particular that she thinks is really funny (a very important consideration<br/>
in books for Rowan :o)).  ~Rue<br/>

I read the original as a child and read the updated one to Kathryn.  <br/>
Lots of reviewers are outraged that Rosemary Wells made any changes.  <br/>
I remember really liking the original though I can&#39;t recall any  <br/>
details and I liked the new version just fine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have The Doll People in audio and have listened to it over and over.  Had <br/>
tons of discussions on the difference in Annabelle&#39;s personality in The Doll <br/>
People vs in The Meanest Doll in the World (which we didn&#39;t enjoy as much). <br/>
This book has sparked many, many conversations.  I loved the Borrowers when <br/>
I was a kid.  There is similar series about The Littles, but I don&#39;t think <br/>
it is as good.<br/>
<br/>
The Indian in the Cupboard series has play figures that come to life and is <br/>
set in England.<br/>
<br/>
The Castle in the Attic and The Battle for the Castle involve boys shrinking <br/>
down to play figure size and going on adventures in the past.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to remember the name of a book about a boy who finds a very old <br/>
doll in his grandmother&#39;s attic.  She talks but only children can hear her. <br/>
The boy keeps the doll, but doesn&#39;t want his dad to know.  The dad is one of <br/>
those &quot;boys do sports, not dolls&quot; types.  We loved this book even though I <br/>
cried at the ending (a bittersweet one).  Does anyone know it?<br/>
<br/>
Slightly related - I belong to a monthly book club.  The months that we read <br/>
fiction usually have way better discussions than the months we read <br/>
*classics* or non-fiction.  A story can lead to all kinds of thinking, <br/>
talking, and learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-192919899">I feel sheepish doing another book recommendation (I don&#39;t think they&#39;re all there is in the world or anything, but I did work in a bookstore for four years, and some old habits seem to stick):<br/>
  The Bromeliad Trilogy (individual names: Truckers, Diggers, and Wings) by Terry Pratchett is about nomes living secretly in normal-sized human world.  Pratchett is a satirist (and a very funny one), so you get a lot of commentary on perception, when your noticing how weirdly the nomes interpret phenomena from the human world.  You can pretty well enjoy the books on several different planes (satire, story, etc).  Oh, his first ever book was also along those lines, called the Carpet People.  You&#39;d probably have to order it, if you&#39;re interested. <br/>
  And, no, I&#39;m not a book publisher publicist or anything.  :)  <br/>
  Back to lurking...<br/>
