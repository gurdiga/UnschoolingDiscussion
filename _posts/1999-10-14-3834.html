<div id="ygrps-yiv-653098638">I was reading these posts and thinking about the issue that I had to deal<br/>
wit yesterday with my 10 year old daughter. She has never loved math but<br/>
she understands it and her process is solid. I have emphasized with her<br/>
over and over how she  is learning at her own pace (at par with her school<br/>
mate pals) and that the multiplication will come. She knows most of the<br/>
tables but I have never asked her to memorize them. However, yesterday she<br/>
burst into tears and said, &quot;Enough of the understanding math... I just want<br/>
to know all my multiplication tables. All my friends in school know them<br/>
off the top of their heads. &quot;  This came after struggling with a<br/>
multiplication problem.  <br/>
So, I am going to help her memorize the multiplication tables. Gag...  But<br/>
this is obviously something that is important to her...right now. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my struggle is with keeping up with the math. I do slip back to<br/>
workbooks and texts because I have a comfort zone working with them. I do<br/>
see how mundane and unreal they become, however this morning I am wondering<br/>
if I am doing enough with my daughters along the lines of math and etc. <br/>

&gt;Understanding and creativity a more important to me also.  Sometimes,<br/>
&gt;however,  I do ponder whether memorizing things isn&#39; t a good &quot;brain<br/>
&gt;exercise&quot;?  I realize there are many ways to develop your brain,  but it<br/>
&gt;seems memorizing something is one of them.  Those in drama do this to learn<br/>
&gt;their part.  People who learn Latin memorize a lot.  Memorizing seems to<br/>
&gt;have it&#39;s place, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159748682">As evidenced by your post, you are certainly doing one important thing<br/>
right... caring.<br/>
<br/>
I have helped my children memorize the math tables because I believe it adds<br/>
to their competence and helps with their self-esteem.  We have made it an<br/>
interactive and fun thing in our house and they did not mind learning them<br/>
at all.  So I say go for it!<br/>
