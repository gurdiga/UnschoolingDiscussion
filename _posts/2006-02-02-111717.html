<div id="ygrps-yiv-156599052">wait, maybe it should be mineral rich natural sea salt.  does it  matter if <br/>
we get it ground or how finely it&#39;s ground? maybe it would be better  absorbed <br/>
if it were ground fresh.  heck, maybe it should be made at  home!  or should <br/>
it be in our horse-pill multivitamin so the amount can be  controlled?  heh.<br/>

This made me laugh! Sometimes I think about what would be &quot;best&quot; in  way to <br/>
much detail. I am now visualizing fresh finely ground &quot;Home&quot; grown  sea salt. <br/>
still LOL. <br/>
