&gt; Sometimes, late at night, when I&#39;m all alone,<br/>
&gt; YES!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now we can get into what would define a trashy novel!<br/>
A subject that could get hot with some of my in-laws!!<br/>
What they call literature I don&#39;t call anything at<br/>
all. What I enjoy quite often has subject matter they<br/>
feel should not be refered to at all.<br/>

I like trashy novels and (some) junk TV just as much as the next person.  I<br/>
was just pointing out to those that feel TV is evil and books are sacred<br/>
(I&#39;m exaggerating :) that there are good and bad in both mediums, with<br/>
&quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; defined solely with the &quot;user&quot; (or by the eye of the<br/>
beholder &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think TV us evil or that books re sacred,  I think both can be<br/>
abused if the person partaking is hurting his/her life in the process. <br/>
That said on to the interesting subject:<br/>
<br/>
I had a discussion a while back on a writing list I think about what<br/>
&#39;literature&#39; is and what has value.  I truly believe that hundreds of<br/>
years from now the surviving literature will be Harry Potter books, Tom<br/>
Clancy, Steven King, Danielle Steele, James Patterson, etc.  We have this<br/>
hoity toity attitude about popular fiction - that it is somehow less<br/>
worthy but in the long run what will survive is what got printed the<br/>
most.  I personally, like Dean Koontz.  I also read Tami Hoag, Patterson,<br/>
Clancy, Janet Evanovich and oodles of others.<br/>
