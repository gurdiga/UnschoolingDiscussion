<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159185047">My son is 7 and still sleeps in family bed with us and his sister who is 3.<br/>

We kept our crib, which was NEVER used by the children, until Dillon was 4.<br/>
It was &quot;the baby bed&quot; where we kept all the stuffed animals!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636106195">&lt;SNIP&gt; My own father never quite got it.He asked me once &gt;when Gary was<br/>
about four<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;months old &quot; If he doesn&#39;t sleep during the day, what does &gt;he do?&quot; he &gt;<br/>
&gt;couldn&#39;t &gt;&gt;understand why I wouldn&#39;t put him in a crib and &gt;leave him in<br/>
&gt;another room! And this is a  man who has 3 children of his &gt;own!&gt;&gt;<br/>

My mother asked me, when Dillon was probably about 6 months old, when I was<br/>
going to put him on a schedule.  I told her I would when he learns to read<br/>
time.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Also, a co-worker of mine started on me one day about how we parent (AP) vs.<br/>
how she parents.  She was appalled that I would sleep with my baby, even let<br/>
him sleep in a sling or on my lap at naptime.  I responded that even dogs<br/>
sleep with their babies.<br/>
There&#39;s just no talking to me sometimes! (BWEG)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051906798">We tried putting the two twin size beds <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;together to make a king size but it was terrible for whoever ended up in the <br/>
&gt;crack.  Any suggestions would be wonderful as I miss sleeping with my <br/>
&gt;babies!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try using something to bind the matresses together (like the infinately long and very strong celephane wrap that you get at moving supply places, or even just some srong flat ribbon wrapped several times around the matresses.  Then put a foam pad over the whole thing, eggcrate, or whatever.  You can mail order a king size foam pad, if there is no place available to get one near you.  See if that works.<br/>
