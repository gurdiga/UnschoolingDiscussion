<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073892185">I have a new tool for my idea toolbox, but it&#39;s a simple antique tool.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve loved the history of native English words since I was nine years  <br/>
old, but here&#39;s an important one I had never known until today.   I  <br/>
subscribe to the wordsmith mailing list.  There&#39;s a website, too.    <br/>
Today&#39;s word is &quot;atone.&quot;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wordsmith.org/words/atone.html">http://wordsmith.org/words/atone.html</a><br/>
<br/>
It means &quot;to make amends for.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In these days the words &quot;atonement&quot; and &quot;amends&quot; live in church and  <br/>
Alcoholics Anonymous, pretty much.<br/>
When one atones for sin, the intent is to bring him back to God, &quot;back  <br/>
into the fold,&quot; or to be at peace with God.  To be at one with God.   <br/>
That last part is the linguistic basis of it I hadn&#39;t seen or heard  <br/>
explained before.<br/>
<br/>
When a recovering alcoholic or someone in any twelve-step program that  <br/>
grew out of AA &quot;makes amends,&quot; the idea is to make as much verbal or  <br/>
other atonement as the other person might desire or accept, if the  <br/>
other person is still alive or available.  (My summary; not straight  <br/>
from the literature or traditional recommendations of the groups.)    <br/>
The purpose of amends is to bring the person back into the life of a  <br/>
person who has rejected him, sometimes.  Or to mend a relationship,  <br/>
even just a little, which helps mend the soul and conscience of the  <br/>
&quot;twelve stepper&quot; who has made the effort to acknowledge hurts he did  <br/>
or failures caused by the focus on something other than being present  <br/>
and supportive of other people.<br/>
<br/>
In attachment parenting terms (used quite a bit in unschooling  <br/>
discussions), it&#39;s being a partner instead of an adversary.  Being on  <br/>
the same team.  Being your child&#39;s support system.    Being present  <br/>
with your child.   Being present for your child.   With infants, La  <br/>
Leche League used the term &quot;unit&quot;--the mother and child unit, or  <br/>
pair.  Those describe the temporary symbiotic single being of the  <br/>
infant and nursing mother.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can evolve easily when that relationship exists between a  <br/>
parent and child, and the mother takes care not to break the bonds.    <br/>
School is the biggest bond-breaking machine ever created.   They break  <br/>
sibling bonds too, when they can.  Even twins are separated into  <br/>
different classes (in my experience, having gone to school with twins  <br/>
and taught several sets of twins).<br/>
<br/>
When a family comes to unschooling by a route other than attachment  <br/>
parenting, the mother needs to atone.   She has parented in ways she  <br/>
no longer is proud of or comfortable with.  The regret and sorrow  <br/>
aren&#39;t hard to muster, when one is trying to create a more peaceful  <br/>
relationship with a child.   The recommendations on this list have  <br/>
been &quot;apologize,&quot; and &quot;make up for it now,&quot; but the word for those  <br/>
things is &quot;atone.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is exactly where we are right now, although I did started out with attachment parenting, I lacked support (I was alone for 6 months on a new military base, husband sailing the blue seas).  We took Seth out of the bed at 8 months, and then I night-weaned him at 10 months (I should have listened to Nate who held him for 5 minutes and then gave him to me and said, &quot;just nurse him!&quot;).  I see now those 45 minutes of him crying in my arms and my denying him what he needed as the point at which it became, solidly, &quot;Maria vs. Seth.&quot;  He stopped nursing around his first birthday when I would not allow him to bite me.<br/>
<br/>
So much to atone for, I feel.  Things seem to be getting better: I don&#39;t feel as guilty anymore, and he comes up to me randomly saying, &quot;Mommy, I love you.&quot;  Which makes me feel like I must be doing something right.  Trust seems to be rebuilding; by giving him more, he gives more to us, and others.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a Daily Groove post by Scott Noelle that really speaks to me: <br/>
<br/>
:: No Regrets ::<br/>
<br/>
As you progress and become a wiser parent, you may at<br/>
times feel regret that you didn&#39;t &quot;know better&quot; when<br/>
your children were younger. You may even feel guilty<br/>
for &quot;damaging&quot; them. If so, let Mother Nature inspire<br/>
you to a more hopeful perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever explored a wild forest and appreciated<br/>
the awesome way in which Life springs forth from the<br/>
chaos? Then you know Mother Nature never regrets. She<br/>
learns as she goes and always makes the best of things<br/>
as they are. She never looks back.<br/>
<br/>
When a tree takes root in the shadows, Mother Nature<br/>
doesn&#39;t regret giving it a &quot;sub-optimum&quot; start in<br/>
life. She trusts it will bend toward the Light and<br/>
find a way to thrive. And in doing so, the tree<br/>
creates its own unique beauty.<br/>
<br/>
She knows that no storm, flood, or fire can stop the<br/>
endless Flow of Life through her children.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
============================================<br/>
<br/>
So whenever I&#39;m feeling like I really &quot;f---ed that one up&quot;, I remind myself to do better and that he&#39;ll find the light.  It&#39;s impossible for him not to.  <br/>

 <br/>
This hits on exactly what I&#39;m going through.  Worse still, I  did follow <br/>
attachment parenting right up until deciding to  send Jess to school.  <br/>
 <br/>
Somehow I have to explain to her (and myself) why I allowed societal  norms <br/>
to eat away at my convictions, how I allowed myself to be swayed and  <br/>
believe the naysayers who didn&#39;t like a child with a mind of her own and  who <br/>
told me that she needed &quot;structure&quot;.  Why I stopped seeing this  amazing child <br/>
through my eyes and started to view her through mainstream  goggles, where <br/>
the things that make her unique - her individuality and her quick  reactions <br/>
to frustration or injustice - became &#39;oddness&#39; and &#39;a volatile  temper&#39;.  <br/>
Why I believed that our financial and neighbourhood circumstances  were reason <br/>
enough to assume that school was a better option for her.  <br/>
 <br/>
So, to have set my child up with the belief that she could be  absolutely <br/>
herself and to then have asked her to conform to the  multiple petty rules of <br/>
a schooled life - now that&#39;s a lot of atonement to  be getting on with!  <br/>
(I&#39;m trying to go with a combination of apology and  changed patterns of <br/>
behaviour and making life as fun as possible).<br/>
 <br/>
I suppose the good thing is there&#39;s an element of timing on our side.   <br/>
Just when those of us who have to atone in this way are asking our kids for  <br/>
forgiveness, our kids are likely to be well-disposed to view us  kindly <br/>
because they know that at last they&#39;ve been listened to!  At  least I hope that&#39;s <br/>
the case.  <br/>

Ah!  This is the part two I was going to get to this morning.  I see  <br/>
it&#39;s 3:30 and I still haven&#39;t started dinner, so.... thanks for the  <br/>
unintended nudge!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our culture seems about to lose the entire purpose and use of  <br/>
greetings and apologies and amends, because people will say things  <br/>
like this:<br/>
<br/>
Greetings!<br/>
I would like to apologize.<br/>
I&#39;m here to make amends.<br/>
Condolences.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, okay.  So apologize!    If someone lied to me and then comes and  <br/>
says &quot;I apologize,&quot; no they don&#39;t.   An apology isn&#39;t the name of an  <br/>
apology, but it&#39;s &quot;I&#39;ve thought about it and I see how hurtful it was  <br/>
and I&#39;m sorry I did that and I&#39;ll try not to do it in the future.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I just watched a movie that wasn&#39;t very good, and I mailed it right  <br/>
back (netflix), but in it a woman is out of rehab and is supposed to  <br/>
make amends and at her sister&#39;s rehearsal dinner she makes a toast  <br/>
that isn&#39;t about her sister at all--it&#39;s all about her, and rehab, and  <br/>
the fact that she&#39;s making amends with this speech.   But she didn&#39;t.   <br/>
And that&#39;s part of the story.  The woman was crap at recovery. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s the difference between saying sorry and making amends.  It&#39;s  <br/>
the difference between being sorry and making atonement:<br/>
<br/>
Change.<br/>
And once changed, if you talk about it be specific.  Say &quot;I thought I  <br/>
was doing the right thing when I used to say &#39;no&#39; so much, but I  <br/>
really like the feeling of thinking about it before I say yes or no.&quot;   <br/>
Or say &quot;I wish I had always let you sleep with me.  If you were little  <br/>
again, I would do it differently.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And be different.<br/>
And that can be atonement.<br/>

OMG, yeah!  How often do adults say to kids &quot;Don&#39;t say sorry unless  you <br/>
mean it and you&#39;ll behave differently in future&quot;?  It&#39;s only  fair that the <br/>
adults should follow that same principle.<br/>
