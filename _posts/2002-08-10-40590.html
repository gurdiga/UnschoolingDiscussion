And this *really* isn&#39;t the forum to discuss it in because I&#39;m *way*<br/>
underinformed for a discussion. (Besides being way too state specific to be<br/>
useful to unschoolers in general.) If anyone has questions the place to go<br/>
is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MAhomeschoolers/**">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MAhomeschoolers/**</a><br/>
<br/>
Right!  This isn&#39;t the right forum.<br/>
<br/>
The details of the political fights to maintain homeschooling rights are<br/>
different in each of the 50 US states.  With 800 people on list we<br/>
probably have people from every state in the US, and I know we also have<br/>
people from other countries around the globe.  Discussing the political<br/>
situations in every state would be overwhelming!  Although an occasional<br/>
discussion of local political issues MIGHT be of general interest, the<br/>
details of each individual battle are probably NOT of interest to 49 out<br/>
of every 50 people on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Discussions of state politics are best suited to STATE homeschooling<br/>
lists and lists that specialize in political issues.<br/>
