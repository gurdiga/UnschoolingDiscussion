<div id="ygrps-yiv-34512051">I have an interesting dilemma, and thought I&#39;d throw it out here to <br/>
get opinions.<br/>
My children (ages 8 and 11) came home from their cousins house and <br/>
told me about him just not *getting* that math is all around in the <br/>
real world, and that doing math on paper isn&#39;t the only way.<br/>
They had apparently had a lengthy discussion, with my nephew telling <br/>
them they&#39;ll never learn math unless someone makes them.<br/>
They felt sorry for him.<br/>
I later heard my son telling my dd that their cousin was telling <br/>
*everyone* that they don&#39;t have to do anything for school.  He was <br/>
questioned by another boy, if  this was true or not, and he said yes.<br/>
I&#39;ve explained to them that everyone we know, doesn&#39;t think the way <br/>
we do.  That they believe children have to be taught certain things <br/>
in certain ways in order to learn.  And at the same time, I kind of <br/>
encouraged them to maybe not talk so much about the way we do <br/>
things.  Esp. not to brag about it, like &quot;aren&#39;t we lucky&quot;.<br/>
My dilemma is, I feel very uncomfortable stifling my children, but <br/>
also worry about people, who I know aren&#39;t even close to the ideas of <br/>
unschooling, becomming concerned about the welfare of my kids.<br/>
I was wondering how others have explained to their kids about how <br/>
different unschooling is, and sometimes different can scare people.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know what you mean Joanna. I am fairly vague with most people or I <br/>
explain that we do a lot of &quot;hands on&quot; activities. That usually <br/>
satisfies them.<br/>
My oldest told someone &quot;we teach ourselves&quot; when questioned by a <br/>
coworker the other day. That didn&#39;t get a very good response, believe <br/>
me!<br/>
Some of the other homeschooled kids have expressed a strong desire to <br/>
unschool (when their parent&#39;s weren&#39;t in the room) and seemed jealous <br/>
of my free kids. But I really think that attracting jealousy is <br/>
natural when you have a great life!!!<br/>
As I say that, all three of my older kids are screaming at each <br/>
other...sheesh. So much for peace eh?<br/>
Anway, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s your problem that it attracts some <br/>
jealousy...if they want to enjoy freedom they can!  It&#39;s all a <br/>
choice. I do remind my kids to not brag about it when their friends <br/>
complain about homework and stuff.<br/>
It&#39;s hard to have so much fun in a world that doesn&#39;t!! LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Agreed here that stifling the children isn&#39;t a goal of respecting <br/>
children. OTOH, my thoughts is that its time for a conversation with the <br/>
children about the real life aspect of people who feel the need to look <br/>
out for other&#39;s welfare.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to address the fact that on rare instances, it is a <br/>
blessing. Such as abused children, and even point out some local, or <br/>
national incident that this belongs with.<br/>
<br/>
The conversation has to express how you see life as a learning <br/>
experience, so when they talk about how well they have it (and yes, <br/>
bragging will happen) explain how they somehow need to incorporate the <br/>
idea that they ARE learning.<br/>
<br/>
Talk about how people feel the need sometimes to put their beleifs upon <br/>
others and call &#39;authorities&#39; who then feel that your educational ideas <br/>
are in question.<br/>
<br/>
Also let them know that you are complying with whatever your state laws <br/>
are so that they understand that there is nothing wrong in what you are <br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
I think at 8 and 11, they should get a decent picture on how others, in <br/>
wanting to be helpful, might be hurtful.<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY reason for this conversation is to prevent a well-intending <br/>
neighbor, friend, stranger from calling a child welfare agency and you <br/>
having to deal with that issue. Regardless of the outcome, its not worth <br/>
the hassle.<br/>
<br/>
IF there is no chance of this happening in the circle that your children <br/>
are in, just let them do their bragging and let them have their glee of <br/>
feeling they are doing what is best for themselves. I think its great <br/>
they are speaking up for themselves and they understand the concepts of <br/>
life being the teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Bragging is something that happens in certain circles of people. So if <br/>
they feel the need to, its possible that someone who is not  unschooled <br/>
is somehow showing superiority in unseen or unheard ways that foster that <br/>
kind of talk.<br/>
<br/>
just a few thoughts on the subject,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; doing.***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did talk to them about most of the things you have discussed here.  <br/>
My son bursted out in the middle of the conversation, &quot;Are we <br/>
breaking the law?!&quot;<br/>
I said &quot;no, but we&#39;re technically not following it in the way people <br/>
think we are suppose to be following it.&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m not really sure if that&#39;s true though.  The law says 182 days of <br/>
*instruction* in the same subjects the schools cover.<br/>
Maybe we are criminals!<br/>
My 11 and I have been through all of this, because we talk a lot.  My <br/>
son can only handle short wisps of conversation, so I am giving it to <br/>
him in bits.<br/>
He knows we are different, he just doesn&#39;t realize *how* different <br/>
yet.<br/>
<br/>
I will reiterate the idea of talking about how much they are <br/>
learning, and to maybe talk about their interests, when describing <br/>
their education.<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It can also be dangerous.  Someone thought my kids weren&#39;t learning <br/>
enough and turned us in to CPS the first year we homeschooled.  <br/>
Fortunately, my girls understood the possible consequences and told <br/>
the nice lady all about the stuff they were learning.  They neglected <br/>
to mention that it was just stuff they felt like doing on any given <br/>
day.<br/>
So, yes, tell your kids not to lie.  But also tell them to think <br/>
about what they are actually learning and talk about that should that <br/>
type of situation arise.  <br/>
