Parents should NOT be puppets, nor think of themselves as puppets, nor  <br/>
as their children as &quot;puppeteers.&quot;  Parents should be thoughtful and  <br/>
compassionate and willing to entertain their children by picking up  <br/>
spoons.  That&#39;s some pretty cheap entertainment.   But perhaps the one  <br/>
year old is attempting to communicate that he&#39;s ready to get down, or  <br/>
not old enough to use a spoon, or not hungry.<br/>

As often as people express platitudes about the world as seen through the eyes of children, it&#39;s kind of sad how often adults disregard a child&#39;s perspectives. Plain old commonplace gravity is a marvel to inspire fascination and delight. The most wonderful part of being with my kids is getting to see normal everyday miracles as fresh and wonderful all over again. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109105709">Daycare providers are still explaining their point of view over  <br/>
there.   Another of my comments:<br/>
<br/>
This is only good advice for extinguishing a behavior, operant  <br/>
conditioning style. For building a relationship of trust between the  <br/>
parent and child, it is very bad advice:<br/>
&quot;Also about fits. Ignore it works well. We had a 20 month old who  <br/>
would throw himself on the floor with a tantrum. Mom was exasperated.  <br/>
i told her step over him, ignore him totally and do dishes run the  <br/>
vacuum whatever to let him know you are not the least bit distrubed by  <br/>
the behavior. What did he do? He followed her from place to place  <br/>
flopping his body around while she stepped over him ignored him. Does  <br/>
he do it much now? Occasionally but not often.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Works well&quot; totally depends on the goal.<br/>
If my husband ignored me when I wanted to talk to him, I would  <br/>
eventually stop trying. If what he wanted was for me to leave him  <br/>
alone, for me to give up on wanting his companionship, then that would  <br/>
probably &quot;work well.&quot;<br/>

Babies and toddlers are exploring the world and working out what everything means. I can&#39;t imagine a child would be dropping a spoon for some elaborate ruse or reason. Picking up a spoon for a small child is hardly slave labor, even if the spoon is repeatedly dropped and picked up. <br/>

You can begin a partnership with a child by picking up the spoon,  <br/>
making it a joyful game, having fun. The baby not only learns about  <br/>

Horrible parenting book written like they are the word of God and to Christian <br/>
parents.<br/>
They say that if you are loving, nice, attached to you child they will become <br/>
evil and  side with Satan ( OK not these exact words <br/>
<br/>
but pretty much  :-)<br/>
Ezzo specially says that babies are manipulative since birth.<br/>
Pearls tells parents to swat their kids hands if they throw anything on the <br/>
floor, specially the high chair<br/>
, which is also used as a punishing tool.<br/>
Parents are told that it is the godly way to raise kids.<br/>

explaining that pacifers stand in for mothers who aren&#39;t doing their<br/>
jobs--another word for them is *dummies* and my child needs no dummy to<br/>
replace his mother,  as he has a mother willing to meet his needs. The<br/>
mother is the primary attachment object, so the comment doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>
This is not a chicken and egg scenario because clearly the mother comes<br/>
first, and hopefully the *dummy* isn&#39;t in the picture.<br/>

none of those predictions came true.<br/>

<br/>
While I understand your point of view as it is common in some circles, lots of on-demand breastfed babies still want/need a pacifier. My daughter was one of them. I held off giving her one until she was over 7 months old because I felt as you did, but you should have seen the look of joy on her face the first time I popped one in her mouth!  The gift of being able to suck when she wasn&#39;t hungry and/or on the move, was a blessing, for us both.  Not giving her one sooner is one of my only regrets about those first months of her life. <br/>
<br/>
Even now, at seven, she likes to have something non-food related to suck or chew and she nursed, as often as she wanted to until she self-weaned at 2.5 years. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447720172">To be clearer I wasn&#39;t arguing with my babies or denying them anything, I<br/>
was arguing with people who were trying to interfere with the communication<br/>
happening between me and my babies.  They felt I was spoiling the babies and<br/>
not taking time for myself.  Some would tell me for my own sake, and then<br/>
tell me for the baby&#39;s sake I needed a &#39;stand-in&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of the story of why my mother weaned me at six weeks.  I was<br/>
gaining too quickly, so the doctor told her her milk was *too rich* for her<br/>
baby.  My husband was weaned at about eight weeks by his mom for *failing to<br/>
thrive*.  He wasn&#39;t gaining well on the scheduled feedings--every four hours<br/>
wasn&#39;t enough.  So one baby was weaned for not gaining well, and the other<br/>
for gaining too well.  Not many babies nursed in the 1960&#39;s because either<br/>
they gained weight *too well* or *not well enough*.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot understand mothers who insist on letting babies cry it out.<br/>
 Crispin my youngest occasionally cried mysteriously, but he was held,<br/>
cuddled and offered help.  He still needs at almost age eight more cuddling<br/>
and more help too calm down than either Rowan or Martin did, but that&#39;s<br/>
okay.  His brothers recognize that some things are harder for him and they<br/>
can be quite gentle and patient.<br/>
<br/>
An infant really isn&#39;t going to argue back about whether or not I am the<br/>
primary attachment object, and he or she needs a stand-in other than his or<br/>
her own fist.  All my kids eventually started sucking on fingers.  At first<br/>
I would offer the breast, but the baby&#39;s all knew when they wanted their<br/>
fingers and not the breast.  Generally this happened after six months--they<br/>
were exploring rather than looking for mothering or nutrients.  Honest, I<br/>
never forced a breast on an unwilling infant:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224486469">-=-It reminds me of the story of why my mother weaned me at six  <br/>
weeks.  I was<br/>
gaining too quickly, so the doctor told her her milk was *too rich*  <br/>
for her<br/>
baby.  My husband was weaned at about eight weeks by his mom for  <br/>
*failing to<br/>
thrive*.  He wasn&#39;t gaining well on the scheduled feedings--every four  <br/>
hours<br/>
wasn&#39;t enough.  So one baby was weaned for not gaining well, and the  <br/>
other<br/>
for gaining too well.  Not many babies nursed in the 1960&#39;s because  <br/>
either<br/>
they gained weight *too well* or *not well enough*.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My mom weaned me early because her milk was &quot;too rich&quot; (because I was  <br/>
spitting up).<br/>
Then she was told to wean my sister because it was &quot;too thin&quot; (my  <br/>
sister was scrawny and sickly at first).<br/>
Those were in the 1950&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
The parents partnered with the doctors (or were the doctors&#39; puppets)  <br/>
and the poor kids were left out of the equation entirely.<br/>
