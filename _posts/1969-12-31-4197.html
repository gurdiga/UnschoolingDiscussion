<div id="ygrps-yiv-81901649">In response to the late reader thread, my almost 11 yo ds didn&#39;t want to read until just about 8 years old...we did the &quot;Teach your child to read in 100 easy lessons&quot; thing, probably too early, but it did give him a base when he decided he wanted to go whole hog. In retrospect I would totally wait on him now.<br/>
<br/>
But, the GOOD news for those parents who are fidgeting about this, my son started reading when he discovered he could &quot;get&quot; something for it, ie, he could read the instructions about installing and using his favorite computer programs WITHOUT waiting for mom or dad to &quot;finish up&quot; whatever they were working on at the time! He found a use for reading, and now he reads well above &quot;grade level&quot; (whatever that is).<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of...he is curious as to his own &quot;standing&quot; on &quot;grade level&quot; and would like to check out a vocabulary test. I know there are several on the Net, but can&#39;t remember where. Anyone have a URL?<br/>
<br/>
Just one of those progressive word lists that they read until they have a real problem with pronunciation.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
    I was wondering how schools might fare if all they did was play and read <br/>
to kids through at least third grade? I worry at times that my 8 yro is not <br/>
doing enough. I am reading to him total about 2hrs a day. My feeling is that <br/>
he is getting much more across the spectrum of learning than he did sitting <br/>
in school all day and doing busy work phonics papers.<br/>
    He doesn&#39;t want to write much and really doesn&#39;t write well yet. He reads <br/>
but is still in the learning to read as opposed to reading for content stage. <br/>
I feel this is OK because he&#39;s only 8 but when I look at some of the 2nd -3rd <br/>
grade workbooks I have I realize that there is much in them that he is not <br/>
yet capable of doing. In fact I use some of these pages for my 11yro. He <br/>
tends to whip through them but it gives me an idea of what he knows. <br/>
    I keep telling myself to keep reading to him and in the long run this <br/>
will really pay off. He is pretty good so far in basic math. He can <br/>
add,subtract,carry, we haven&#39;t borrowed yet. He loves to mess with stuff, <br/>
especially water. I am amazed to watch him since he&#39;s been home awhile. I <br/>
never realized what a little experimenter he was.<br/>
Does anyone else have any thoughts on this. I do think we&#39;re ok but worry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322319456">I think in the front of the set of the 3 How to teach books by Ruth Beechick, <br/>
I know its in one of her books.......they took 2 classes of kids, with one <br/>
they didnt push reading, they did science experiments, field trips....didnt <br/>
push schooly things....<br/>
The other class they did the pushing of the phonics, reading, spelling, <br/>
normal school stuff.........at the end of third grade, the first class had a <br/>
higher reading scale, bigger vocabulary and much bigger comprehension and <br/>
spelling ability.<br/>

I thought I&#39;d share as well.
<br>Unfortunately for my dd, we tried &quot;teaching&quot; her how to read and she
struggled and we had tears, etc.&nbsp; You know the gamut. (We were worried
because at age 8 you have to start reporting to the sd and turning in portfolios,
testing, etc.)&nbsp; Well, we finally came to our sensed again and stopped
pushing.&nbsp; At age 11 she blossomed!&nbsp; She is now a voracious reader
and not that testing means much but she has been post high school in her
reading scores since sixth grade.
<br>My ds is 11 1/2.&nbsp; At 11 he got interested in reading &quot;his books&quot;
and is only beginning to read.&nbsp; He prefers to decode our language
on his own.&nbsp; My girlfriend made him feel really good when she said
that every language has a Secret code.&nbsp; And when you get interested

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not teaching my daughters to read, so I&#39;m just like the farm families.<br/>
Except of course I&#39;m not just like the farm families.<br/>
<br/>
Generational non-readers living on isolated farms with other non-readers are<br/>
a far cry from an unschooling household with books everywhere, video games<br/>
and board games that need reading, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If my daughters grew up on a farm where nobody ever spoke, probably they<br/>
would have speaking difficulties, too. Would that mean they were unable to<br/>
learn naturally if given the opportunity?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Your post on it being a natural thing that would come in time just made me<br/>
&gt; really think.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope so, as it&#39;s a basic of unschooling that learning IS natural<br/>
(including reading) and WILL come in time if the child has any need or<br/>
desire to learn it at all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At one time there were a LOT of non readers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are some figures that dispute this, if &quot;at one time&quot; you&#39;re not<br/>
talking about cave-men but about pre-public school days. Was it John Taylor<br/>
Gatto who had the stats on early 1900s literacy rates versus now, with<br/>
compulsory attendance?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-630729291">It seems to me that the discussion on reading being natural as *we* know it<br/>
and older generations not reading are two different things. The<br/>
circumstances of past generations and how we all unschool is totally<br/>
different. Sending children out in the fields to work because that was more<br/>
important and not having hardly any kind of reading materials available is<br/>
certainly not how we talk about out children growing up. It wasn&#39;t something<br/>
that happened because a lot of people then didn&#39;t do it. Because there<br/>
weren&#39;t available resources like there are now. And later on, schools and<br/>
people would make fun of others who couldn&#39;t read, which would in turn<br/>
squash any kind of spark in that person to want to. Someone here said they<br/>
knew someone who was actually embarrassed to have someone know they couldn&#39;t<br/>
read. If there was no taboo about not being able to read no matter what the<br/>
age, I really have no doubt that even 70 year old people would learn to do<br/>
it. I do know of stories, not personally, where older individuals did learn<br/>
on their own. Think of a 14 year old child in a loving home looking at a Pat<br/>
the Cat book trying to read it. Now think of that same child out in the park<br/>
or at school around other kids and adults who read and think about what<br/>
would be said to him. Makes a big difference in how that child would feel<br/>
about his ability.<br/>

Great post.  So while children today have so many more opportunities than in <br/>
past generations (the computer alone is amazing) that would lean a person to <br/>
think that reading IS natural if one has enough materials to encourage or tempt <br/>
the child with?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in the past there simply wasn&#39;t time to sit and try to read something <br/>
as a child?  Too many chores or not enough daylight or probably a hundred other <br/>
reasons.  So there were lots of reasons NOT to do something that really comes <br/>
naturally?<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm... this is beginning to sound like which came first, the chicken or the <br/>
egg...<br/>
<br/>
So if one is exposed to plenty of things to encourage the natural ability to <br/>
read it will inertly happen.  But if one is deprived on many opportunities it <br/>
might not?<br/>
<br/>
Sorta like maybe someone is really talented golf player but has no clubs or <br/>
no course to practice so they might never reach their potential?  Or one might <br/>
argue they can&#39;t be a gifted golfer BECAUSE they do not play often or have the <br/>
right clubs or course?<br/>
<br/>
Either way, I also don&#39;t remember NOT reading, even before I went to school <br/>
so this is very interesting to me on many levels.<br/>
<br/>
Thank for sharing your thoughts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557522792">The way I see the natural vs. not natural issue is this:<br/>
<br/>
It is NATURAL for human beings to learn the things they are surrounded by day after day.<br/>
It is natural for human beings to learn how to read when surrounded by opportunities and reasons to do so.<br/>
Whether it is natural to learn to read when not surrounded by those things is a mute point at an unschooling list.<br/>
Even those children that struggle and have a more difficult time with printed symbols...it is still a natural process, not forced, in the unschooling lifestyle. <br/>
<br/>
We learn what surrounds us. Even if a child has no interest in the thing they are surrounded by day after day, they are going to pick up a lot of it naturally. That&#39;s what is important in this discussion, not whether it happens by magic in other environments. I guarantee that every illiterate adult alive today, either had really rotten experiences that shut them down to learning or had NO adults really interested in them and what they were doing.<br/>
It isn&#39;t natural to learn to read in a non-reading environment. We all know that. I thought we were discussing whether it was natural to learn to read in a bubbly, happy unschooling environment.   ??<br/>

<br/>
But are you saying that because unschooling children are in a bubbly, happy <br/>
atmosphere and at some point DO learn to read, then is it safe to conclude it <br/>
is not entirely natural if it takes certain things to make it happen <br/>
&quot;naturally&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think if a child were surrounded with written materials, access to a <br/>
computer, games, all the books you can imagine but never were read to or never <br/>
introduced to or helped sound out words or recognize letters they would still <br/>
be able to read those books at some point?<br/>
<br/>
It does take someone else I think to at the very least &quot;help&quot; them recognize <br/>
the letter A is an A and so on.  Whether you call it teaching or whatever term <br/>
you attach to it, it still takes interaction with someone else to make this <br/>
learning happen.  So can we really call it a natural thing?  Maybe, I don&#39;t <br/>
think there is anything UN natural about a parent introducing words, letters, <br/>
sounds and to read read and read some more to their children.  But it doesn&#39;t <br/>
happen in all homes and I guess some people learn to read in spite of not having <br/>
the advantages of a loving unschooling environment, for many reasons I <br/>
suppose.<br/>
<br/>
What if, and this is unlikely in the civilized world, but if a child were <br/>
born to deaf mutes and had very little if any interaction with the speaking world <br/>
but had all the normal functions, would they indeed develop language?  <br/>
Without hearing it, practicing it, interacting with others?<br/>
<br/>
I would think they would be verbal in some context wouldn&#39;t they?  Even if no <br/>
one were around to hear it?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen toddlers with very little language skills.  The ones I&#39;ve known <br/>
were for the most part foster children that hadn&#39;t really had interaction with <br/>
adults much or their needs didn&#39;t matter so there was really not much need to <br/>
try to communicate them to others.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad that I live in the current time with all the advantages it can <br/>
offer my children, so much to choose from!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Here is a good question to ponder.. I may do some research on it.  If someone<br/>
&gt; does not attain a &quot;good level&quot; of reading skills ( I would say, for a frame<br/>
&gt; of reference, about a typical 5th-6th grade level)  by the time they are ..<br/>
&gt; say.. 18, or an adult, will it be difficult for them to improve thier reading<br/>
&gt; skills as adults?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s an assumption that children learn better than adults do. It may be<br/>
based on fact (haven&#39;t cared enough to look up the double-blind studies<br/>
&lt;g&gt;), but it remains that humans can and do learn their whole lives long.<br/>
<br/>
My husband reads more now than he did when we were first married. More, more<br/>
quickly, more fluidly. When he read out loud to our first child in her<br/>
cradle, he was not as fluent or easy with it as reading to our 8 and 5 year<br/>
olds now.<br/>
<br/>
Adults are people, too. ;) People learn.<br/>

<br/>
No.<br/>
If that were the case, then speech and language wouldn&#39;t be natural.<br/>
If a child is born and then grows in the total absence of other living, <br/>
speaking humans, no language will come.<br/>
<br/>
Tarzan could NOT really have learned to read from finding an alphabet book in <br/>
his parents&#39; old hut, because he had no model for the words, what they <br/>
sounded like, or what pictures even were.    He needed human contact.  (He was <br/>
fictional, but still...)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But are you saying that because unschooling children are in a bubbly, happy <br/>
atmosphere and at some point DO learn to read, then is it safe to conclude it <br/>
is not entirely natural if it takes certain things to make it happen <br/>
&quot;naturally&quot;?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a cultural thing.  Children in Asian countries learn to eat with <br/>
chopsticks.  It&#39;s natural for them to do so.  Children here can learn to use a spoon <br/>
naturally, by trying it, playing with it and watching others do it.  There are <br/>
humans who live where the people around them use neither spoons nor <br/>
chopsticks.  They can&#39;t learn naturally to use what they&#39;ve never seen.   If one of us <br/>
went there, we wouldn&#39;t know how to eat--we would need to watch others and <br/>
copy their methods.  It could be something kind of complicated, and it would take <br/>
practice, or it might be something similar to something we already do.<br/>
<br/>
It is natural for children to learn their cultures.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you think if a child were surrounded with written materials, access to a <br/>
computer, games, all the books you can imagine but never were read to or <br/>
never <br/>
introduced to or helped sound out words or recognize letters they would still <br/>
be able to read those books at some point?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There you come into whether the deaf can learn to read.  They do it all the <br/>
time.  It has nothing to do with &quot;sounding out,&quot; it&#39;s associating a pattern <br/>
with an object or idea.  Some kids are talented with patterns, and could probably <br/>
figure out a LOT!  How else could antiquarians figure out how to read <br/>
Egyption or Babylonian, if it can&#39;t be figured out from the patterns themselves?  <br/>
(With Babylonian, they had a good starter clue, with the Rosetta Stone, I think.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It does take someone else I think to at the very least &quot;help&quot; them <br/>
recognize <br/>
the letter A is an A and so on.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you care whether they call &quot;A&quot; that.  The same symbol is not pronounced <br/>
the same way by people who speak different languages right now.  If you know the <br/>
alphabet in German or Spanish or French, you&#39;ll know that the same letters <br/>
don&#39;t sound the same in all, and it&#39;s not even the same SET of letters in all.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Whether you call it teaching or whatever term <br/>
you attach to it, it still takes interaction with someone else to make this <br/>
learning happen.  So can we really call it a natural thing? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sex is natural, but it takes interaction.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe, I don&#39;t <br/>
think there is anything UN natural about a parent introducing words, letters, <br/>
sounds and to read read and read some more to their children.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;Maybe&quot; I don&#39;t know whether you meant for it to apply to the sentence <br/>
before, or whether you&#39;re saying &quot;Maybe you don&#39;t think...&quot; the matter of that <br/>
sentence.<br/>

still instinctually make babbling noises in an attempt to <br/>

that if there continues to be no exposure to spoken language, then <br/>
the babbling stops and no spoken language is learned. But the point <br/>
is that all humans have a deep INSTINCT to want to verbally <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-194808554">&quot;well all of your proffessional unschoolers let me ask you this - <br/>
How do you know if your child has a problem or if he will end up <br/>
being just a late reader.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m not a professional unschooler, since I don&#39;t make money at this! But I assume you are jokingly referring to those of us that truly, deeply understand and apply the philosophy.:)<br/>
<br/>
First of all, if my child has some real, physical problem that would actually prevent him/her from reading, how is pressuring or pushing going to help? I accept that my children are each unique individuals...with or without real disabilities (I&#39;m coming to hate that word) I am going to honor them for who they are, right now, today.<br/>
<br/>
My awareness of their needs might make me research specific traits, especially if it were causing them frustration or discomfort. Understanding those traits might help me give that child what they need, but labeling them, or pushing them to learn something that may be difficult for that child, would never be the answer.<br/>
Have you read Anne Ohman&#39;s account of her child? &quot;I am what I am&quot; is a beautifully written article, that sums up exactly why I feel disability labels are not only unecessary in unschooling, but harmful.<br/>
<br/>
You can google it, or there&#39;s a link at Sandra&#39;s site.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are going to have real life disabilities that keep them from reading well, or even at all. How would pushing something they can&#39;t do ever help? People can be whole and happy, leading productive lives without reading well!! Truly.<br/>
It would have to be a very real and serious problem to prevent them from reading entirely. In that case, focus on the things the child CAN do well. <br/>
<br/>
I am amazed at how focused our society is on weaknesses or &quot;disabilities&quot;. WHY can&#39;t we see the good things in each other? why, oh why, can&#39;t parents FOCUS on the traits that are wonderful in their children. If we spend a huge majority of time focusing on what incredible human beings they are, don&#39;t you think they&#39;ll feel empowered enough to follow their dreams, to believe they have the power to change their lives at ANY time, to trust that their passions are worth following?<br/>
The greatest gift you can give your child is a sense of wonder...curiosity, the second greatest gift is the ability to TRUST themselves and believe they are whole, wonderful beings, capable of creating an amazing life for themselves. <br/>
Schools would have you believe that reading and math are the keys to success....well I&#39;m here to tell you otherwise!!<br/>

&gt; being just a late reader.&quot; (first paragraph - by Sonya)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, I&#39;m not a professional unschooler, since I don&#39;t make money <br/>
 </span></blockquote>at this! But I assume you are jokingly referring to those of us that <br/>
truly, deeply understand and apply the philosophy.:)(Ren)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes Ren,that is how I mean it. I&#39;ve have been thinking about this a <br/>
lot and remembering way back when I first pulled my son out of <br/>
Kindergarten. I took tons of books out and read and it was all I <br/>
ate, slept and breathed. I was unschoolng before I had a name for <br/>
it. I also new that even though the schools labeled my child he was <br/>
smart as a whip and he is my child - So I pulled him out. I&#39;m not <br/>
sure if I have made the &quot;padigram shift&quot; as of yet but I know I am <br/>
not the same person I was two years ago. This list gave me the <br/>
strength I needed while I was unschooling in a schooling world and <br/>
getting flak from non-believers in homeschooling forget <br/>
UNSCHOOLING !! I never announced that I was unschooling but people <br/>
probed me for questions including my husband LOL................ <br/>
Well <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m here to say good-bye for a little while. As you know I said I <br/>
would be going back to work and I will be training for 10 weeks and <br/>
the whole process takes about 9 months total(state job). The hard <br/>
part is that I don&#39;t know when that call will come and I have to be <br/>
ready !! I know what it takes because my sister works there now and <br/>
has seen over time what it takes. I know this has nothing to do with <br/>
unschooling but................I have made the tough choice of <br/>
putting my son back in school for this time period. VERY TOUGH <br/>
CHOICE ! I visited the school (not public) and asked them what they <br/>
could do for &quot;US&quot; not what could we do for them since we are paying <br/>
them. I told them my son doesn&#39;t read and that I had no ciriculum <br/>
and that I did not want him to be pushed. We bought all of his <br/>
uniforms and he is dressed to shoes in it right now and he doesn&#39;t <br/>
even have school today LOL..... I have different eyes now compared <br/>
to the older me. I have explained to my son that I want this to be a <br/>
fun experience and I do not want him to feel any pressure to perform <br/>
because learning is suppose to be FUN. He understands that he is not <br/>
where the other children are and he said to the teacher &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
read yet&quot;. The only thing that comforts me in this whole thing is <br/>
that the children are not aloud to tease the other children and they <br/>
don&#39;t single out children with differences. The school I have chosen <br/>
was started by home schoolers so while they may not be &quot;Unschoolers&quot; <br/>
@ least they are not mainstream schoolers. We are schedued for <br/>
the &quot;Live and Learn&quot; conference and I look forward to being there <br/>
and meeting you all. I trust that my son and I will make it through <br/>
this unscathed :)<br/>
Funny I just looked up the word &quot;unscathed&quot; to make sure my spelling <br/>
was correct and guess what word was directly under it &quot;unschooled&quot;<br/>
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!<br/>
See you all @ the conference :)<br/>

<br/>
Yes ! Ren that is what I meant. I am not totally sure if I would be <br/>
considered one of those who have made the &quot;Padigram shift&quot; as of yet.<br/>
I thank this list very much for helping me grow and giving me <br/>
strength when I needed it. However due to my circumstances I have <br/>
put my child back into school (with new eyes of course). I will see <br/>
you all @ the &quot;Live and Learn conference&quot; . I have enterd this <br/>
situation with my son with new eyes and I trust that we will make it <br/>
through this &quot;unscathed&quot;. Ironically the word directly under this <br/>
(in my dictionary)is unschooled LOL..... Mmmmmmm ! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be back - take care and aee you in Aug.<br/>
