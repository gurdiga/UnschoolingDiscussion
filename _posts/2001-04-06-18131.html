<div id="ygrps-yiv-395437146">I know I didn&#39;t use the OT: thingy in my subject, but that&#39;s cos I <br/>
thought everyone might be interested :-)  I&#39;ve just been reading a <br/>
forum about toilet-training as per Continuum Concept, ie learning <br/>
when your baby&#39;s ready to &#39;go&#39; and putting them on the potty or <br/>
toilet, also developing signs and sounds for you both to use when <br/>
they need to go.  The theory seems to be that even tiny babies <br/>
know their bodies well enough to know when they&#39;re &#39;going&#39; so why <br/>
not use the toilet rather than a nappy?  Also, why train them to use <br/>
a nappy when they could be using the potty?  Sounds fair enough...<br/>
<br/>
I wondered if anyone has done this, or knows someone who has?  <br/>
I&#39;m interested, dd2 has struggled with weeing for ages, going <br/>
through phases of being fine and then not, and I&#39;m reluctant to risk <br/>
the same rigmarole with &#39;the bump.&#39;  What I really need is to see it <br/>
in action, I suppose, maybe there could be ipt support groups like <br/>
LLL groups?  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, looking forward to seeing what y&#39;all think<br/>

Well...<br/>
Not a current story, but in college I had a boyfriend who had grown up (until <br/>
he was 12 or 13) in India, and was the middle of five children.  He said his <br/>
mom used to sit and put her feet together sideways (like toe-to-toe, <br/>
heel-to-heel, he showed me, but they don&#39;t wear real shoes and their feet are <br/>
way natural and flexible) to make a little potty seat of sorts, and would do <br/>
this at the in-ground toilet (theirs is just a hole) when the babies were <br/>
bigger, or just wherever (on cloth or paper?) when they were tinier, when she <br/>
knew they needed to go, and they would go there.  Sitting on part of their <br/>
mom, with their mom holding them.  WAY less scary than our plastic or wooden <br/>
potty seats.<br/>
<br/>
He said babies didn&#39;t wear diapers when they were first walking, just wore <br/>
long shirts (kurtas, in his terminology--the long white shirts with buttons <br/>
at the top front) and the moms knew when they had to go.<br/>
<br/>
That would been the 1950&#39;s (for him), early 60&#39;s (for his brothers).</div>
