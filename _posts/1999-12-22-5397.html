hi,<br/>
<br/>
very funny.   my son weaned himself at 13 months.  i was not ready at all.<br/>
but one day he just couldn&#39;t nurse because he would crack up laughing every<br/>
time he tried.  why i have no idea we tried repeatedly but the same thing<br/>
happened, and that was it.  it was very sad for me but for him it was no big<br/>
deal.<br/>
<br/>
as far as potty training that i honestly don&#39;t know exactly how it happened.<br/>
we pretty much did what diane talked about - he was without diapers as much<br/>
of the time as possible, before the age of two i cleaned up often but told<br/>
him where he should go, we had a potty chair (which he never used)  and did a<br/>
sort of show & tell (no really bathroom privacy but in retrospect a small<br/>
price to pay).   after two if he went on the floor i would remind him that he<br/>
knew where to go (nicely) and that there was no need for him to go on the<br/>
floor, he would say he was sorry and i told him there was no need to<br/>
apologize but to just try and remember next time.    it was such a non event<br/>
i can&#39;t  remember at what age but it must have been between 3 and 3 1/2 when<br/>
he stopped wearing diapers on outings .  also he stopped wearing diapers at<br/>
night just before he turned 4 (though he could have stopped before be we<br/>
didn&#39;t want him to be upset if he went in the bed).  it&#39;s been about 9 months<br/>
and he&#39;s had only 2 &#39;accidents at night.  i think being calm takes the<br/>
pressure off them to &#39;get it right&#39;.  also they like to mimic  adults but it<br/>
is annoying having no privacy in the bathroom:)<br/>
