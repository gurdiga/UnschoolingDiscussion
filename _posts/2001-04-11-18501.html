<div id="ygrps-yiv-144095349">I&#39;ve learned a new skill now.  I&#39;m able to keep it &quot;sanitary&quot; and fairly organized.  I&#39;ve had to override my instincts and settle for &quot;better&quot; instead of &quot;perfect&quot;.  It makes me a more fun mom and THAT had to be the priority.<br/>

I too, concentrate on cleanliness rather than neatness.  But I am one of those people who is agitated and stressed out by clutter and mess.  So we follow a similar pattern to the person who posted regarding pick up times, family responsibility for messes, putting things away before getting them out, and bed-time cleanup.  <br/>
<br/>
I also, being an organizer, have a tendancy to try to organize things so that they are easier to keep neat.  We have a rack for keys, a basket for incoming mail, a low rack for kids coats, etc.  In the kids&#39; rooms, we have clear plastic bins, marked with labels that have names and pictures drawn on them, like &quot;people&quot;, &quot;vehicles&quot;, &quot;blocks&quot;, &quot;animals&quot;, etc and the kids know what goes where and can line the bins up on the the floor and get things put away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830342014"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Try keeping seven kids accountable for their messes! My pet peeve is &quot;i didn&#39;t use it&quot; or &quot;well, it&#39;s not mine so I&#39;m not putting it away&quot;. Some days are better than others.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I usually respond, &quot;Well how would it be if I only cleaned up and looked after myself?  Besides, we are part of a family, and families help each other take care of our home and each other.&quot;  I try to point out to the kids on occassion when I am helping them with something that is NOT my mess or whatever, usually shortly after I have gotten the &quot;IT&#39;s not mine/I didn&#39;t do it&quot; line.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-671003310">Do you by any chance have a lodger called *Mr Nobody*.  Because if <br/>
you do, it seems he does all the naughty things.  He used to live at <br/>
our house!<br/>

One of the best tools I&#39;ve discovered for our house are those little<br/>
plastic shoe boxes.  I can find them for as low as $.50 a piece and then<br/>
I buy a LOT.  Everytime the kids get a new toy set I pull one of them out<br/>
and as soon as they are done playing with it we throw it in the box. <br/>
They are clear so the kids can see where the set is.  They work for my<br/>
stuff too.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to know the real me, they can look in my closet. <br/>
Everything from &quot;kid reach&quot; up is SUPER organized.  Alas, it is the only<br/>
evidence of my TRUE preference.<br/>
