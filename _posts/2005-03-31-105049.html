&lt;&lt; I trust Dylan can ask about slaughterhouses when he wants to know.  I<br/>
trust if he never wants to know, then that&#39;s all right for him. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hid something from my kids, in a way.<br/>
Something they might&#39;ve been ready for or not, but I figured it could wait, <br/>
given our circumstances and where we live and their particular circle of <br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
I have not rented or mentioned the mini-series Roots.<br/>
They&#39;ll probably discover it someday, and now that I&#39;ve named it, one of them <br/>
might ask within the week.<br/>
<br/>
Even though they&#39;re big fans of LaVar Burton and Lou Gossett, Jr., and even <br/>
though I usually bring up lots of connections, that one has been left where it <br/>
is until they discover it, or later.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the people my kids have met and the way they&#39;ve been exposed (and <br/>
blissfully not exposed more often) to the history of race relations and <br/>
cultural prejudices, they have each individually thought that anyone who made <br/>
blanket prejudiced statements against someone for being Hispanic or Black or Asian <br/>
was just stupid and not very nice.   That has worked out better for them than I <br/>
think things have worked for some other families I know in which the children <br/>
are steeped in prejudice or too-much-detail history or the too-much-detail <br/>
explanation for why people might not be nice to them.  Rather than justify and <br/>
rationalize others&#39; prejudices, they simply see prejudice as massively wrong <br/>
and unfair.  Not understandable, but something people should get over and not <br/>
condone.  <br/>
<br/>
As they&#39;ve gotten older and heard jokes and met people who would say tacky <br/>
stuff, they&#39;ve asked sometimes, but usually it&#39;s &quot;Why would he think that?&quot; and <br/>
I give short answers, like &quot;Maybe his parents say things like that a lot,&quot; or <br/>
&quot;Maybe his cousins aren&#39;t all Trujillos like yours are.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I realize it&#39;s a luxury we have for living in a more homogenous part of the <br/>
country, and that probably in MOST parts of the country I couldn&#39;t have pulled <br/>
this off.  <br/>
<br/>
Someday when any of them sees Roots, he or she won&#39;t have to ask why I never <br/>
showed them.  They&#39;ll know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-735678134">Just a little personal comment on this.<br/>
Oh, how I wish I had been shielded from Roots at least for a little while. At about 8, I watched without a parent in sight and was traumatised. There are still scenes stuck inside my 40-year-old adult head that I may have been better off never having seen, or at least not alone at 8.<br/>

Not hidden, but not really something they&#39;ll run across easily, either.<br/>
I wanted them to watch it when they could put it into perspective.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well- more than likely they will. One of those coincidences, but one of <br/>
Rosie&#39;s friends was reading it a few weeks ago and told Rosie she <br/>
really &quot;should&quot; read it - so she&#39;s got it out of the library right now. <br/>
She told me  there is a miniseries and she said the library has it and <br/>
she wants to watch it. So - since Rosie talks to Sandra&#39;s kids, they&#39;re <br/>
probably going to hear about it one of these days from her. Maybe. If <br/>
so - sorry about that. I think Rosie could wait on it a while longer, <br/>
but Roya and Roxana would probably get a lot out of it and they have <br/>
the perspective to handle it.<br/>

<br/>
I have a counter-suggestion, or supplemental suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
I remember not watching Roots when it was aired when I was in Jr. High.  My mom couldn&#39;t stand to watch anything emotionally distressing.  Later, when I read the book, the descriptions of the conditions on the slave ship were the most disturbing part for me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, a less graphic book, but one that may be better written, is Octavia Butler&#39;s book _Kindred_.  It starts in present-day L.A. and deals with a woman being repeatedly pulled back in time to live with her enslaved ancestors (and her white slave-owning ancestors, too).<br/>
<br/>
I suppose reading Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin would be of historical interest.  (Have you guys watched The King and I and connected to this story that way?)<br/>
<br/>

PS  I&#39;ve been speculating about what would be a reasonable age to expose my kid (almost 11) to Hotel Rwanda or Schindler&#39;s List.  I&#39;ve seen the latter, but not the former.</div>

<br/>
I&#39;m 52 and haven&#39;t watched either, and probably won&#39;t.<br/>
I&#39;m not going to expose my kids to those either.<br/>
I also wouldn&#39;t way &quot;NO&quot; if they wanted to watch them without me, with others.<br/>
<br/>
They know as much of Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin as one learns from knowing The King <br/>
and I.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. We saw The King and I live 2 or 3 years ago - and both Rox and <br/>
Rosie decided to read Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin at that time. I&#39;m not sure if <br/>
either of them actually got through the whole book -- but they both <br/>
carried it around for a while &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the book suggestion - sounds good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536398718"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Oh, how I wish I had been shielded from Roots at least for a <br/>

was traumatised. There are still scenes stuck inside my 40-year-old <br/>
adult head that I may have been better off never having seen, or at <br/>
least not alone at 8.<br/>
<br/>
But there is a lot of gray area between shielding and forcing a <br/>
child to watch it alone.  My husband and I both had good memories of <br/>
watching Roots as children.  It had a lasting effect on me, <br/>
personally, but not in a bad or traumatized way.  Perhaps it was my <br/>
personality (and I think I was older than 8) or perhaps it was <br/>
because I didn&#39;t have to watch it alone without adult input. <br/>
 <br/>
My husband and I recently got the first part of Roots from Netflix <br/>
and our children were welcome to watch it with us or not.  My 9yo, <br/>
who often chooses not to see anything blatantly violent, was fine <br/>
with watching it.  I warned him about the part that I personally <br/>
find the most disturbing- which is the part where Kunta Kinte gets <br/>
whipped until he says his name is Toby- and I let him know when it <br/>
was coming so he could leave the room or close his eyes.   He&#39;s very <br/>
aware of what he can handle and what he can&#39;t.  He wanted no part of <br/>
The Passion of the Christ when his stronger-stomached older brother <br/>
watched it.<br/>
<br/>
As far as perspective on slavery- we had not too long ago read a <br/>
book together called How I Found the Strong about a boy who helps a <br/>
runaway slave, which my sons found fascinating and which led to lots <br/>
of discussion, so maybe the timing for them just happened to be <br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
My 9yo, the one I was most concerned about, was the most <br/>
disappointed of all of us that parts 2 and 3 were damaged and no <br/>
longer available from netflix.  <br/>
