<div id="ygrps-yiv-281967695">Dear Dr. Science,<br/>
Do teachers secretly want you to fail?<br/>
       from Steven McCullough of Ballycalre, N. Ireland<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
   <br/>
Answer:<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s no secret. Teachers are the angriest people around. As survivors of<br/>
academic emotional abuse, they seek to spread the pain. This natural<br/>
desire for healing is, in itself, pathological. However desire to have<br/>
our children safely warehoused while we&#39;re at work mitigates any effort<br/>
to stop this deadly cycle of abuse. What are most teachers other than<br/>
poorly paid prison guards? Some affect a false persona that suggests a<br/>
refined and gentle spirit, but underneath the mask they harbor an<br/>
irresistible desire to get even with the world. My scientific efforts to<br/>
achieve tenure long ago proved this.<br/>
