My son is not a registered Homeschooler yet, as he only turned 8 in<br/>
April.  I am going to file the intent to homeschool paper in September. <br/>
That is how I understood it works in WA state.  So, can I also wait<br/>
until next year, when he is 9, to begin the testing/evaluation<br/>
requirement or should I apply that now?  If I am to test him now, is<br/>
there a certain test one is to use?  Where do I find one?  <br/>
Thanks again for the info.<br/>

Actually, I&#39;ve always took it that it has to be filed in the school year that <br/>
the child turns 8.  I don&#39;t know for sure and it&#39;s not defined.  That was my <br/>
standard, so go with your gut.  Compulsory attendance just says age 8. So, <br/>
under MY standard you probably should have done it last year.  Fact is, you <br/>
didn&#39;t, I&#39;d just file the intent in August and test next spring, if testing <br/>
is the option you want to go with.  Someone at the district asks about why <br/>
you didn&#39;t file the intent sooner, do a mea culpa and move on.  I&#39;ve never <br/>
heard of it being questioned one way or another.  Generally, the districts <br/>
know that it&#39;s a loose law and will say don&#39;t do it again....  They are <br/>
pretty forgiving here.  <br/>
<br/>
The good thing about Wa. State IMHO, is that the homeschooling law is defined <br/>
on the state level and it&#39;s a pretty good law.  Districts certainly try to <br/>
deviate from the state standard from time to time, but fact is they can&#39;t get <br/>
away with it because the state law defines what can and cannot be done.  When <br/>
states allow the districts to define what they&#39;ll require you get little <br/>
pockets and kingdoms of those that absolutely hate homeschoolers.  Geez, in <br/>
WV the homeschool liaison in some districts is also the truant officer, talk <br/>
about hostile.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have always taken it this way.  My dd has a July birthday.  The September <br/>
after she turned 8, I filed for her. Another dd has a birthday AFTER the <br/>
School admittance deadline. (IE she must be 5 by Sept 1 to enter <br/>
Kindergarten)  Her birthday is the end of September, so would miss the 5yo <br/>
date - and, going by that logic, she would not be entering school until she <br/>
was actually near 9.  Does that make sense?  I am following the &quot;school <br/>
logic&quot; on this one, and so far it has served us well.  Just because your <br/>
child turns 8 in the middle of the year, doesn&#39;t mean all of a sudden you <br/>
have to file and test...<br/>

Right, I was going to file on Jacob this year, he&#39;ll be 8 next April.  <br/>
Luckily, we&#39;re picking up a Montana address in two weeks and I&#39;ll file as <br/>
Montana residents.  All they require is up to date shots with the option of <br/>
exemption and, an attendance record (now how stupid is that?).<br/>

Ooops, forgot to finish this...  I don&#39;t see anything that says you have to <br/>
file in that school year they turn 8.  I don&#39;t think waiting until the next <br/>
year is inappropriate either.<br/>
