<div id="ygrps-yiv-738066174">A well-meaning church &quot;friend&quot; found out we are new to homeschooling. I don&#39;t <br/>
really broadcast that we are Unschoolers, I only answer specific questions <br/>
when people ask me. She left some curriculum catalogs at my home to peruse. <br/>
Out of curiosity, I have made it halfway through the Sonlight catalog. <br/>
(sidenote: it was overwhelming, especially the preschool curriculum for 3-4 <br/>
years olds, I have an almost 3yo and I can&#39;t imagine what these folks are <br/>
thinking. Ironically, they mention the Moores and their theory of later <br/>
formal academics when appropriate by readiness) It mentions Cultural <br/>
Literacy/ E.D. Hirsch. Any comments on it/him are welcome, my mother(she <br/>
questions content and coverage, fearing we will miss something or fall <br/>
behind) is a fan, and I wouldn&#39;t mind getting input from all sides. (Any <br/>
input on the Moore Formula would be appreciated also, I identify with some of <br/>
their theories, but not sure how it would mesh with unschooling) I shared <br/>
with her that I bought the &quot;everything your 4th grader needs to know&quot; as a <br/>
jumping point when we first stopped public school. At first I felt a need to <br/>
split it up and try to explore a certain amount daily, to &quot;cover our butts&quot;, <br/>
but quickly learned how boring and tedious that would be. I now keep it as a <br/>
reference, and a take along book in case we are somewhere and my dd wants to <br/>
read and explore in it. It&#39;s got some interesting stuff in it. It came in <br/>
handy when we were playing with roman numerals and secret coding on a road <br/>
trip. Browsing through this catalog, I started wondering if I would like to <br/>
purchase/borrow any of these resources. I saw a sample of the &quot;schedule&quot; and <br/>
I almost broke out in hives. But I was thinking that some of their selections <br/>
could be great things to &quot;strew about the house&quot;.  What is the general <br/>
unschooling consensus on a rich environment? Do you actively strew, or is <br/>
that manipulative? Do you strew based on your interests, or try to pick up on <br/>
things that your child has expressed interest in? I believe my daughter will <br/>
find interest in things that I show interest in, but is it like pretending to <br/>
like sports to try to hang out with the hubby? It feels kinda false, ya know? <br/>
Do you ever feign interest in something that you really don&#39;t like that much, <br/>
just to fool the kids into interest?? Haha Confession time! How important is <br/>
&quot;cultural literacy&quot;? Do you provide a lot of different resources (I already <br/>
have a ton because I love picking up books at yardsales, thriftstores, church <br/>
sales, etc etc) at home that cover the &quot;basics&quot;? Or do you just let them go <br/>
to the library and pick out what they find? I think I do a little of both so <br/>
far, and am wondering what degrees and grades others do this. I think the <br/>
scope sequence is not only unnecessary, but potentially overwhelming and can <br/>
contribute to burnout. But I don&#39;t what to have a un-rich environment, <br/>
either, LOL.In case it isn&#39;t already evident, I suffer from periodic <br/>
unschooling doubt and anxiety. Not that I don&#39;t trust unschooling and my <br/>
kids, but I have had confidence problems for some time (a result of my <br/>
schooling?) and it leads me to seek what others are doing, out of curiosity, <br/>
to see if anyone else&#39;s instincts are like mine. Can anyone possibly <br/>
identify? I guess my only other question is, does anyone recommend any <br/>
catalogs as resource lists to borrow certain materials from the library? Are <br/>
any of these curriculum sources of any use except for the obvious? (I must be <br/>
an optimist LOL) I notice Sonlight uses a lot of Usborne books, are these <br/>
good? What one or several books would you recommend every unschooling home <br/>
have? Your faves or things to avoid? Thanks you guys for tolerating my <br/>
rambling and unorganized thinking out loud &lt;g&gt; I don&#39;t ask for much, do I &lt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure that I like the whole &quot;strew&quot; paradigm, or maybe it&#39;s just<br/>
the terminology. It does feel manipulative to me, like placing things on<br/>
a child&#39;s path and hoping that she&#39;ll &quot;discover&quot; them. I&#39;m much more<br/>
inclined to get something, say,&quot;This is a cool book about cat mummies in<br/>
Egypt, if you ever want to read it - it&#39;s going right here on the<br/>
bookshelf.&quot; and that&#39;s it. As she&#39;s gotten older, sometimes I&#39;ve pulled<br/>
stuff out and said &quot;Here, I think you might like this now&quot; and she either<br/>
does or doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Our house is full of &quot;stuff&quot;, and it&#39;s actually fairly well organized, if<br/>
we&#39;re looking for something specific (yesterday Cacie was painting a<br/>
flower pot and wanted to write Robert Frost&#39;s poem The Rose on it, and<br/>
she actually found it in under a minute, even though she&#39;d only heard it<br/>
aloud before) and also open for browsing. She&#39;s pulled out lots of things<br/>
that I&#39;d forgotten we even owned. We have lots of stuff that I assume<br/>
she&#39;ll want to explore some day, stuff that I thought was cool or stuff I<br/>
imagined that she would eventually find cool.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I would feel uncomfortable, say, putting a book on her bedside<br/>
shelf in hopes that she would pick it up some night and read it. That<br/>
would feel manipulative to me - that&#39;s her bedside shelf, stacked with<br/>
her books that she&#39;s decided she may want to read at night. <br/>
<br/>
Actually, I did stick &quot;It&#39;s a Girl Thing&quot; (great book about puberty and<br/>
develoment and all that) next to her bed, but she was there when I did<br/>
it... I thought she might feel more comfortable reading it if the book<br/>
was already there...she freaks out when I say &quot;underwear&quot; aloud at<br/>
Target, so it just seemed better to have the book there waiting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter liked the stories in the 2nd grade book even though the language<br/>
was a bit stilted. (And he *does* recommend getting good quality picture<br/>
book versions and using the ones in the book only if you have to.)<br/>
<br/>
I thought the math part stunk. *Way* too abstract and formal. The standard<br/>
rote practice junk taught in schools. He has *zero* confidence -- since he<br/>
has *zero* experience -- with learning math informally.<br/>
<br/>
I got a couple of ideas out of the art section that I hadn&#39;t thought of like<br/>
pointing out warm and cool colors.<br/>
<br/>
Despite their titles, what they&#39;re designed for isn&#39;t to give a 1st grader<br/>
&quot;what he needs to know&quot;. No first grader needs to know about Egypt. (Unless<br/>
that&#39;s his passion!) It&#39;s just 1/6 or so of the knowledge it would be good<br/>
to know so we don&#39;t sound like cultural doofuses as adults. (&quot;Columbus who?&quot;<br/>
;-) His idea is that it&#39;s good to have a certain common knowledge in order<br/>
to communicate effectively. Not *just* that knowledge of course. Just one<br/>
useful chunk where we all intersect.<br/>
<br/>
If a child&#39;s being raised in a rich environment, then he or she will run<br/>
across most of that anyway just because it is part of our culture.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you look back on say the kindergarten book from 3rd grade you&#39;ll<br/>
see that your child has come across the majority of it just by living. Of<br/>
course they may be going in a different order so it&#39;s good to realize that<br/>
if they don&#39;t know something, that they&#39;ve been spending time learning about<br/>
something else that may not even on the list or comes later.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Take what works and dump the rest :-)<br/>
<br/>
Most experts speak from a point of view of experience with schooled children<br/>
which really has little to do with children who aren&#39;t forced against their<br/>
wills to learn along a particular track at a particular pace.<br/>
<br/>
We get to be like real scientists :-) We can listen to what works and why.<br/>
We can observe our own kids. Sometimes experts can give us a fuller<br/>
understanding of what we&#39;re already seeing, but we should get out of the<br/>
habit -- learned from school! -- of letting them tell us what we should be<br/>
seeing.<br/>
<br/>
For instance experts will tell us that we need to make the kids do what we<br/>
feel is best for them. But if we actually look at the situation what we may<br/>
see is a child who&#39;s living someone else&#39;s idea of what life is supposed to<br/>
be like a puppet. Who is learning to tune out the voice that says &quot;This is<br/>
what I like&quot; and &quot;This is what I don&#39;t like&quot; and replace it with the voice<br/>
of someone supposedly more expert at living life who says &quot;This is what I<br/>
should do&quot; and &quot;This is what I shouldn&#39;t do&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you actively strew, or is<br/>
&gt; that manipulative? Do you strew based on your interests, or try to pick up on<br/>
&gt; things that your child has expressed interest in?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends what your motives are. Are you doing it to lead them in a<br/>
particular direction or because it&#39;s something they might find delight in?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I believe my daughter will<br/>
&gt; find interest in things that I show interest in, but is it like pretending to<br/>
&gt; like sports to try to hang out with the hubby? It feels kinda false, ya know?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How would you treat a friend? It&#39;s a good starting point anyway. Sometimes<br/>
when I&#39;m not interested in something my daughter really is, it helps if I<br/>
turn to appreciating the joy she&#39;s finding in it. :-) Or help her find some<br/>
friends who can share her ethusiasm and appreciation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How important is <br/>

&gt; to the library and pick out what they find?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since my daughter isn&#39;t much into picking -- I suspect she gets overwhelmed<br/>
by the choices available -- I do most of the picking, based around what<br/>
she&#39;s interested in and what of the world might interest her. What works<br/>
best with her, perhaps since she&#39;s an only child or because it&#39;s part of her<br/>
personality, is exploring things together.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think the <br/>
&gt; scope sequence is not only unnecessary, but potentially overwhelming and can<br/>
&gt; contribute to burnout. But I don&#39;t what to have a un-rich environment,<br/>
&gt; either, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, yes, I find them incredibly overwhelming! But peeking at them<br/>
occasionally can help us remember a piece of the world we&#39;ve forgotten about<br/>
recently. Or it can make us feel nervous that we could give them everything<br/>
but we haven&#39;t made much progress! ;-) So I tend to avoid them and<br/>
concentrate on what my daughter likes. It *is* a lot easier now that she&#39;s<br/>
older and her interests kind of narrow things down for me!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In case it isn&#39;t already evident, I suffer from periodic<br/>
&gt; unschooling doubt and anxiety.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t we all :-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s honestly okay to have doubts. When the whole world is marching south<br/>
and tells everyone disaster awaits if you head north, it&#39;s perfectly<br/>
understandable to wonder if you&#39;re doing the right thing by heading north!<br/>
<br/>

Source Book} by Rebecca Rupp<br/>
<br/>
&#92;topurl{http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609801090/o/qid=986983363/sr<br/>
=8-2/ref=aps_sr_b_1_2/107-2415050-0048564<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s got all *kinds* of resources on a wide variety of subjects.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I notice Sonlight uses a lot of Usborne books, are these<br/>
&gt; good?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like them. My daughter is rather neutral ;-)<br/>
<br/>
What do *your* kids like? One way that curriculum fills us with so much<br/>
anxiety is that it feels like someone has chosen the best, most effective<br/>
route somewhere and if our kids shrug with disinterest, then if feels like<br/>
they won&#39;t be getting &quot;there&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So concentrate on the journey rather where they &quot;should&quot; be going. :-) Find<br/>
ways of helping them get the most out of their right now lives. They&#39;re 6<br/>
and 8 and 13 and every age for a reason. They need to be good at those ages<br/>
rather than working on adulthood preparation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What one or several books would you recommend every unschooling home<br/>
&gt; have?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The internet.<br/>
<br/>
I loved the Chinaberry catalog (http://www.chinaberry.com) when my daughter<br/>
was younger. (She&#39;s 10 now.) I still love it but her tastes have become more<br/>
focused and it&#39;s just not as useful at guiding us towards things that are<br/>
tailored just to her as just searching through the on line book catalog for<br/>
subjects that interest her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; things to avoid?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Anything you want your kids to do but don&#39;t want to do yourself!<br/>

It&#39;s better to look at it as providing access to new connections into the<br/>
world to pick up or not. It&#39;s like talking to an infant who has no idea what<br/>
you&#39;re saying. But they need language around them and accessible on a<br/>
certain personal level so they can learn it.<br/>
<br/>
Kids&#39; ability to reach into the world is more limited physically and<br/>
knowledge wise than adults&#39;. They can&#39;t know if they&#39;re interested in<br/>
something or not unless they know it exists! So we can make -- at least a<br/>
portion! -- of that knowledge that various things exist available and they<br/>
can pick and choose and ignore from what&#39;s wandering through their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Of couse they&#39;ll be doing some reaching out on their own but we can divert a<br/>
stream that we&#39;re familiar with through their lives for them to dabble in.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So, what&#39;s the difference between strewing things and simply having a lot<br/>
of cool stuff around, in your mind? To me, the strewing implies that the<br/>
process is supposed to seem random to the child but is really intentional<br/>
by the parent, and I don&#39;t like that. I do think it&#39;s important to have<br/>
cool stuff around, but I don&#39;t like the thought of intentionally<br/>
&quot;strewing&quot; it - it&#39;s just there because one or both of us think it&#39;s<br/>
cool.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I don&#39;t see things as &quot;stumbled on&quot; when they are intentionally<br/>
strewn there to be found. Rain stumbles on owl pellets and secret groves<br/>
and cool library books and things like that, that are honestly just<br/>
randomly there to be found.  There are other things, though, like pipe<br/>
cleaners and poetry books and computer programs, that are just there,<br/>
bought on my whim or hers, and put where it seemed logical that one would<br/>
look for such a thing if one wanted to find it. Sometimes she or I will<br/>
just scan the shelves and pick up something interesting. Sometimes I get<br/>
something and say, &quot;Here&#39;s a such-and-such. I thought you might like to<br/>
do x with it sometime.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t do, and what would feel wrong to me, is to get a<br/>
such-and-such and just stick it on her table, without saying anything.<br/>
That feels intrusive to me. It maybe a personality thing, but I know I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want things to just appear in my house, without any explanation.<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want things &quot;wandering through&quot; my life without my having some<br/>
input - and usually Rain is fine with being included in what I&#39;m doing,<br/>
or what&#39;s going on - but it&#39;s important to get her okay first.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not meant as an unschooling rule ;-) It&#39;s just a brain jog that might<br/>
help some people get out of the school mindset and start seeing learning<br/>
differently.<br/>
<br/>
But some ways of putting things help some people and confuse others. I&#39;ll<br/>
admit I too read manipulation into it when I first heard it. But other<br/>
people have had aha moments from hearing it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can come up with your own catch phrase or way of explaining the<br/>
idea that will help light bulbs light that doesn&#39;t have the implication of<br/>
manipulation in it. The greater the variety of phrases &quot;strewn about&quot; the<br/>
easier it will be for others to get unschooling. :-)<br/>

Egypt, if you ever want to read it - &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She won&#39;t want to go all the way to EGYPT for it!!!<br/>
<br/>
[Okay, now THAT was taken out of context!! &lt;g&gt;]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; it&#39;s going right here on the<br/>
bookshelf.&quot; and that&#39;s it. As she&#39;s gotten older, sometimes I&#39;ve pulled<br/>
stuff out and said &quot;Here, I think you might like this now&quot; and she either<br/>
does or doesn&#39;t.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If all new books go straight onto the shelf, and none go onto the table or by <br/>
the bed or in the bathroom, people are less likely to pick them up and open <br/>
randomly to something intriguing.<br/>
<br/>
If the new National Geographic is immediately filed on the shelf with the <br/>
rest of them, it won&#39;t be read as well as it will be if it&#39;s left in the <br/>
living room with the cover calling out &quot;OPEN ME UP!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Our house is full of &quot;stuff&quot;, and it&#39;s actually fairly well organized, if<br/>
we&#39;re looking for something specific...She&#39;s pulled out lots of things<br/>
that I&#39;d forgotten we even owned.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you pull out something she had forgotten you even owned, it would bejust <br/>
as cool!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I guess I would feel uncomfortable, say, putting a book on her bedside<br/>
shelf in hopes that she would pick it up some night and read it. That<br/>
would feel manipulative to me - that&#39;s her bedside shelf, stacked with<br/>
her books that she&#39;s decided she may want to read at night. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kitchen counter then.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t stick a book where I think my kids will want to pick it up and read <br/>
it if it&#39;s not also something I myself would want to pick up and read (or <br/>
might have just done).  I bought an illustrated edition of The Hobbit.  I <br/>
left it out.  My husband read some, every guest in the house would pick it up <br/>
and say &quot;COOL!in the bathroom at the moment.  When it goes on the shelf with <br/>
the other Tolkien stuff, they&#39;ll have the vision of it and the knowledge of <br/>
its existence, and they&#39;ll know where to look for it.<br/>

<br/>
Rearrange the cool stuff from time to time.  What&#39;s in a box in a closet <br/>
might be a lot of cool stuff, but if you never bring it down and look at it <br/>
it&#39;s just a box in a closet.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes Holly says &quot;I don&#39;t have anything good to do,&quot; and I bring a box <br/>
out of a closet (literally or figuratively).  It leads to play or art or <br/>
conversation that wouldn&#39;t have happened otherwise.  It was spontaneous <br/>
because it was in reponse to her.  It was possible because I didn&#39;t give it <br/>
all to the thrift store.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
YOUR house?  Is it your own singular house?<br/>
Things DO appear in my house, because lots of other people live here.  They <br/>
appear in public places, and I walk around them like a monkey, sniff them <br/>
like a dog, pick them up and turn them over and every second of it I&#39;m <br/>
thinking &quot;Whose is this!?  What is this?  This is cool!!!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I first used &quot;strew&quot; years ago to describe what I was doing with my kids, and <br/>
it didn&#39;t just apply to stuff on tables (now that I see how this thread is <br/>
going &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
If I have to drive from here to the other side of town, I can go the quickest <br/>
most boring way, or I can drive by something the kids haven&#39;t seen, or a <br/>
construction site to see the progress, or just through a neighborhood I <br/>
myself have never been through.  Given a choice, I try to make the more <br/>
intellectually stimulating path.<br/>
<br/>
That concept, too, is from an SCA context.  I saw Sir Leif Ivarsson this <br/>
weekend.  When he was to be knighted in 1987, the year Kirby was a baby, I <br/>
went to his vigil the night before.   My husband and I had wanted to knight <br/>
him, when we were king and queen a few months before that, but he hadn&#39;t been <br/>
a member and so we couldn&#39;t do it.  I was in there discussing that with him, <br/>
the kind of improved awareness he would be expected to exhibit as a knight <br/>
and the example he needed to set.  He said he was ashamed that his camp <br/>
wasn&#39;t really period and spiffy and he couldn&#39;t afford all period stuff.  I <br/>
told him ours all came gradually.  And if he could only afford a nylon tent, <br/>
if his choice was orange or brown take brown.  And when his choice was nylon <br/>
or canvas, take canvas.  And when is was store-bought or handmade, take <br/>
handmade.  &quot;Always make the more medieval choice,&quot; I said, and I was so <br/>
excited by this concept that I went back to my camp and told my own household <br/>
about it.  They were excited too.  It was kind of elegant and a good basis <br/>
for decision making.<br/>
<br/>
One month later it bit me in the butt.  We were at an event up in the <br/>
mountains from Colorado Springs, and since I had the baby my husband had done <br/>
all the food preparation for our group.  I asked for a Dr Pepper (for my mug, <br/>
not to drink from the can, of course! &lt;g&gt;), and he said &quot;I brought juice <br/>
instead of soda, because you said always make the more medieval choice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But the concept of incrementally approaching a goal has stuck with me all of <br/>
Kirby&#39;s life. You can&#39;t go from nothing to everything in one step, but you <br/>
can step toward the goal instead of away in one step.<br/>

but things don&#39;t just appear here without Rain *and* I knowing about<br/>
them. She knows what&#39;s in the cupboards, in the refrigerator, on the<br/>
shelves, because she&#39;s lived here for 9 years and because she&#39;s around<br/>
when they come in.  If there&#39;s something new here, one of us brought it,<br/>
and since we generally come and go together (even if we separate once<br/>
we&#39;re in town) we both see it. <br/>
<br/>
A lot of stuff comes and goes, but we talk about it - here&#39;s what I<br/>
found, here&#39;s what I got, do you want to do this now or shall I put it<br/>
up... all that. There&#39;s a difference between our house and, say, the<br/>
sacred glen outside, where birds and animals and the wind come in and out<br/>
and leave stuff to find. Our house is our place.<br/>
<br/>
I guess for us, it&#39;s important to talk about what&#39;s going on in our<br/>
house. Stuff just &quot;appearing&quot; would feel intrusive, so we talk. YMMV, I<br/>
suppose. Our home is our refuge, we like to know what&#39;s going on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-566097575">**I&#39;m not sure that I like the whole &quot;strew&quot; paradigm, or maybe it&#39;s<br/>
just<br/>
the terminology. It does feel manipulative to me, like placing things on<br/>
<br/>
a child&#39;s path and hoping that she&#39;ll &quot;discover&quot; them. I&#39;m much more<br/>
inclined to get something, say,&quot;This is a cool book about cat mummies in<br/>
<br/>
Egypt, if you ever want to read it - it&#39;s going right here on the<br/>
bookshelf.&quot; and that&#39;s it. As she&#39;s gotten older, sometimes I&#39;ve pulled<br/>
stuff out and said &quot;Here, I think you might like this now&quot; and she<br/>
either<br/>
does or doesn&#39;t.**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve concluded that &quot;strewing&quot; works better than &quot;offering&quot; at my<br/>
house.   A strewn object can sit out for five days, but an offer &quot;Hey,<br/>
look at this&quot; is usually only good for five minutes.  (I mean I&#39;m only<br/>
gonna hold out the thing in my hand for five minutes or less.)<br/>
<br/>
When my son is busy, which is most of the day, he is pretty closed to<br/>
new offers.  It&#39;s only when he&#39;s meandering from one activity to another<br/>
that he&#39;s likely to interact with a strewn object.<br/>
<br/>
So, strewing works pretty well for me.  I also believe that picking up<br/>
our living spaces so that new stuff can be seen, rather than being<br/>
camoflaged by older junk, is an important part of the strewing process.<br/>
(I can also read my sons &quot;tracks&quot; more clearly in a cleaner house.  If<br/>
half the toys we own are on the floor, I can&#39;t tell what he&#39;s been<br/>
fiddling with.)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sometimes I feel that strewing is manipulative.  I just try not to<br/>
be too attached to the outcome.<br/>

It&#39;s pretty hard to get five or six people or the ten or more who are here <br/>
many weekends all together at one time and say &quot;I have an announcement to <br/>
make. I&#39;ve got a new magnet toy and I&#39;m going to put it on the table.   I&#39;m <br/>
probably going to get the other magnet toys out as I come across them today <br/>
and put them out too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What I do is I put the magnet toy out.  Whoever was with me when I bought it <br/>
already knows about it and is excited about it.  Whoever&#39;s there when we take <br/>
it out of the box says &quot;OH COOL!&quot;  And whoever wanders by later sits and <br/>
plays with it, and the others come by and show them what they&#39;ve already <br/>
discovered that it will do.<br/>

I used to get kids to volunteer to change the bulleting boards at school, <br/>
when I taught.  I used to get two subscriptions to National Geographic World, <br/>
and when it came we would cut the folds and tape the whole issue up on the <br/>
wall like a giant poster (with two issues you can get both sides of each <br/>
page.  It would stay about a week and the kids would read it WAY better than <br/>
they would have if I had stuck the two issues out and said &quot;Here, you want to <br/>
read these?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s why:  They were looking at them when they weren&#39;t reading them.  <br/>
They&#39;d get curious about a picture.  Or one kid would say &quot;HEY LOOK!&quot; and <br/>
five kids could come look, all at the same time.  It was something that could <br/>
be shared.<br/>
<br/>
At libraries they put the new books out on open shelves, so you can see the <br/>
covers.  They put the newest newspapers and magazines on racks where you can <br/>
see them.<br/>
<br/>
Are they being manipulative, or are they providing information and <br/>
opportunity?<br/>

&gt; Nope, no expectations on the stuff that&#39;s strewn. They just need some<br/>
&gt; portion of the world wandering by and available to them so they have the<br/>
&gt; ability -- though not the necessity -- to expand their interests in ways<br/>
&gt; that they wouldn&#39;t have stumbled on on their own. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To me, the &quot;strewing&quot; is really just leaving it out so that the kids will <br/>
know it is around and can pick it up if they&#39;re interested. Eventually it&#39;ll <br/>
either get picked up by them, or put away by somebody &lt;G&gt;. But, sometimes <br/>
months or years later a kid might say, &quot;Didn&#39;t we have a field guide about <br/>
wildflowers? I thought I remembered us having one.&quot; And - yep - it would be <br/>
something I&#39;d THOUGHT they would be interested in, left it laying around, <br/>
eventually put away, and NOW they&#39;re asking for it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I also will tell them if I see something they might be interested in -- <br/>
strewing is just something I&#39;d do if they weren&#39;t right there for me to say, <br/>
&quot;Oh, look, I found this wildflower field guide that you might be interested <br/>
in.&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess I don&#39;t see things as &quot;stumbled on&quot; when they are intentionally<br/>
&gt; strewn there to be found. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I intentionally put out stuff that I want the kids or my husband to stumble <br/>
upon.<br/>
<br/>
I WONDER if how you see this has to do with a difference in how hectic our <br/>
lives might be. My family&#39;s life tends to be very hectic and so if I think of <br/>
something or find something or buy something or somehow acquire something <br/>
that I think one of the kids might enjoy, it is better for me to put it out <br/>
in their path - rather than try to remember to tell them about it. Because - <br/>
if I put it on a shelf, I&#39;m very likely to forget about it and nobody will <br/>
ever know it is there. <br/>
<br/>
I found out Ray Bradbury was speaking near us - and thought Roxana and Roya <br/>
would LOVE to go see him, since they are huge fans of his. So I put the flier <br/>
on the refrigerator door. I forgot about it - but Roxana saw it there and <br/>
came to me with her eyes glowing and totally thrilled about going. (We did go <br/>
- last week - and Ray Bradbury was one of the best speakers I&#39;ve ever seen - <br/>
he was SO inspiring and unschoolish - talked a LOT about following your <br/>
passions, not believing that what they teach you in school is what is <br/>
necessarily &quot;important&quot; or &quot;significant&quot; for you and how you&#39;re responsible <br/>
for your own education, etc. Plus - we won the door prize, which was a huge <br/>
basket of Trader Joe&#39;s stuff.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - that&#39;s typical &quot;strewing&quot; in my household.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - another example was when we were thinking about buying a car, I left <br/>
brochures about the car I wanted on the table for my dh to find. He doesn&#39;t <br/>
like to be pressured and I get over-excited and he FEELS pressured. So <br/>
strewing brochures in his path and letting him just pick up them up if and <br/>
when he felt like it and read without ME hovering -- was a good thing.<br/>
