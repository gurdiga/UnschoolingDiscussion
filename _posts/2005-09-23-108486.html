<div id="ygrps-yiv-574796185">I&#39;ll be thinking of you Holly. It sounds like you&#39;re in a safe place,<br/>
somewhere you can get higher up if the water rises right? That&#39;s the<br/>
main thing. It&#39;s not the wind that kills people, it&#39;s the water....for<br/>
those of you that haven&#39;t had to deal with hurricanes. ugh.<br/>
<br/>
The part that is worrisome, is after the hurricane. There won&#39;t be<br/>
resources available, I hope you&#39;re really well stocked. It&#39;s amazing<br/>
how hard it is just to get basic necessities...and you stand in very<br/>
long lines for those things. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be thinking about all of you in Rita&#39;s path. MY path is to head<br/>
FAR away from hurricanes very shortly. I&#39;m just hoping none of them<br/>
come this way to stop us from closing on our house. Stay safe Holly!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942176438">Thanks to everyone for the support, infomation and offers of help!  I&#39;ll be sure to post when it&#39;s all over to let everyone know how we fared.  Actually, the girls made sure we have plenty of batteries for the digital camera and that the camcorder was fully charged.  They&#39;re looking forward to chronicling the storm.<br/>
 <br/>
On a funny/sad note- my 15 yo dd (and the only one still hsing, btw) said that if she dies to bury her in a shirt that says &quot;I survived Hurricane Bob, I survived Tropical Storm Allison, I survived Hurrican Rita&quot; with the last line crossed out.  She has a sick sense of humor but it&#39;s hard to see your kids so scared that they&#39;re thinking (actually, knowing after Katrina) that they may not make it.  I&#39;m *sure* we will but there is always that thought in the back of your mind.<br/>
