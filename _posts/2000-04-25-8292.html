<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hi All!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I received the following e-mail from a fellow homeschooling mom who <br/>
&gt; lives in the San Diego area.  The message is self-explanatory, and <br/>
&gt; Debbie has given me permission to reprint it here.  I&#39;d really like <br/>
&gt; to help her and her uncle out, so I&#39;d like to spread the word as <br/>
&gt; much as I can.  Please feel free to let others know, as well.  <br/>
&gt; Please note the May 15th deadline.  Here goes:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ********************************<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m busy with a project to help my favorite uncle who was recently <br/>
&gt; diagnosed <br/>
&gt; with cirrhosis of the liver and hepatitis C. He&#39;s a world renowned <br/>
&gt; venomous <br/>
&gt; reptile specialist, and married to my husband&#39;s aunt. They&#39;re coming <br/>
&gt; out in <br/>
&gt; June, in fact. I&#39;m organizing some fundraisers for them, since it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; outrageously expensive to even be placed on the organ transplant <br/>
&gt; list - you <br/>
&gt; need to be on Medicaid (they denied them due to her making too much <br/>
&gt; money - <br/>
&gt; unreal) or you need to have $250,000.00 in an account. And that cost <br/>
&gt; is just <br/>
&gt; to get on the list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Feeling helpless isn&#39;t my style, so I&#39;m compiling a cookbook. If you <br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; any lemon recipes you&#39;d be willing to share, I would appreciate it <br/>
&gt; so much! <br/>
&gt; Or just post the request for recipes that is on my signature line to <br/>
&gt; your <br/>
&gt; e-list. Perhaps they would be willing to chip in!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>
&gt; Debbie Nelson<br/>
&gt; Share a lemon recipe by 5/15/00 to benefit<br/>
&gt; my uncle&#39;s liver transplant -<br/>
&gt; Get a free ad in the cookbook and online!<br/>
