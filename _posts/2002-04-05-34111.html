worked like a charm for us once we found the right places to put them. For<br/>
some reason the mice liked under the sink and in a drawer but not near the<br/>
food.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve got no experience if the Mouse Cubes don&#39;t work!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-509516021">I was thinking that I must have wrote this!! We have a horrible problem as well. We have tried several different thing that have not worked and are almost to the point of buying traps. I was told by someone that lives around us that traps are really the only way to keep them out. . . otherwise they end up taking over. The cats kill quite a few but not nearly enough. So I am all ears on this one too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437234820">Have you screened around all your water pipes?  That is usually where they<br/>
get in.  Also, you need those little insulating flap like things on the<br/>
bottoms of your doors.  Believe it or not, they can squish themselves almost<br/>
flat and crawl under your doors.<br/>
<br/>
Having a cat works, also.  Or a little rat terrier.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The joke about &quot;build a better mouse trap&quot; is not frivolous.  People have <br/>
always had problems with mice, and the perfect solution has never been found.<br/>
<br/>
We have cats.  Sometimes the cats get tired of chasing mice, and you need <br/>
newer cats.<br/>
<br/>
But if you have more mice than you&#39;re willing to have cats to cover, then <br/>
traps are probably better than other ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Putting something around your house might be more likely to keep them in than <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a frame house or a basement, they will have lots of places to <br/>
live.<br/>
<br/>
Seal ALL holes.  It&#39;s hard in old houses.   Get caulk and spackling and seal <br/>
odd corners in cabinets, and around pipes, and every single where.<br/>
<br/>
Mouse traps are not expensive.  Instead of having two, get a dozen or more, <br/>
and do a big pass.  Maybe hire a neighboring boy if the thing is too <br/>
distasteful for you, to set and check and re-set them.  But instead of <br/>
catching one or two a day, send them all to their next life (or the dust) at <br/>
once.  If you do is slowly, you have more stressful days AND the free ones <br/>
are off celebrating their lives by making more mice.<br/>
<br/>
Before I had kids I didn&#39;t care too much about mice.  I thought they were <br/>
cute.  But when I had babies they became a threat to the safety of the future <br/>
of MY brood, and the smiting began.<br/>
<br/>
Our new house doesn&#39;t have mice inside.  We&#39;ve seen some cat-catches outside. <br/>
 If we didn&#39;t have cats, I&#39;m sure some would move on in.<br/>

Another way to block ho;es is to use VERY FINE steel wool.  Look around your<br/>
outside dryer vent,  hoses, etc.  we put this steel wool between the walls<br/>
and some plumbing fixtures inside the house also - it cuts down on their<br/>
ability to &#39;travel&#39; throughout the house.<br/>
<br/>
Mice breed fairly quickly,  I believe,  so definitely have to take an all at<br/>
once approach rather than a gradual one.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck1<br/>
