<br/>
I know of a Great Home-based business that is very flexible but I don&#39;t<br/>
want to spam everyone on the list with info they don&#39;t want. So if you<br/>
would like more info please contact me off-list at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:BethCMC@...">BethCMC@...</a><br/>

If I leave him I  will  have zero support from my family and I will have<br/>
to work full time <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to support my two kids.  Does anyone know any stay at home work<br/>
 </span></blockquote>opportunities <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that could actually support two kids?  Any help or suggestions would <br/>
&gt; be greatly appreciated.<br/>
