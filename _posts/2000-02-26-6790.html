<div id="ygrps-yiv-166087638">Forwarded from a news release we received:<br/>
<br/>
     My name is Amos Alexander, and I was home schooled<br/>
from K-12. Now I&#39;m in college studying<br/>
Journalism, and I publish a new, free resource to<br/>
help my fellow home schoolers learn science on the<br/>
internet.<br/>
     Students will love the cartoon kids and<br/>
wholesome plots while they learn science from<br/>
the most basic principles.<br/>
     This is a learning tool I would have really<br/>
enjoyed during my home schooling. I think others<br/>
will enjoy it, also.<br/>
     It is completely free. Please visit my site,<br/>
give me some feedback, and then tell others<br/>
about it.<br/>
