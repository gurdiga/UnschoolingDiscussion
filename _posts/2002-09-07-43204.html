&gt; my way towards the possibility that some children (good kids, <br/>
&gt; nice kids, even kids who have been raised &#39;properly&#39;) may <br/>
&gt; respond less simply than your daughter-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t see it as &quot;simple.&quot;  I see it as a compassionate trust build by <br/>
&gt; compassionate action.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We were driving along, Sandra and me in the front seat, Holly in the back. <br/>
Sandra was telling me about something that had happened at their house and <br/>
Holly jumped in to correct her facts about something. I have seen kids around <br/>
Holly&#39;s age do this a million times -- they understand a lot but don&#39;t always <br/>
understand when getting the minute details correct isn&#39;t really all that <br/>
germaine to the point of relating the story. <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve ALSO seen is how parents usually react to their kids doing it. They <br/>
almost always feel a bit embarrassed and like the kid was interrupting (not <br/>
thinking of them as part of the conversation) and usually try to shush the <br/>
kid or brush off the corrections or even sometimes tell the kid in one way or <br/>
another to just butt out.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra turned to Holly and very seriously asked her to clarify what had <br/>
exactly happened. Holly has a rather amazing memory for stuff like who said <br/>
what and who said what next, etc., and she filled in that part of the story <br/>
and then Sandra thanked her and continued it herself.<br/>
<br/>
This is a small thing - but the level of respect Sandra gives her kids is <br/>
really beyond that which I&#39;ve seen just about anywhere else, especially when <br/>
it comes to these very common kinds of interactions. And the payoff is very <br/>
very obvious. Holly is an easygoing delightful articulate and very very <br/>
courteous and kind kid. She looks you right in the eye, she&#39;s interested in <br/>
what you have to say, and she&#39;s just amazingly insightful, especially about <br/>
human behavior. <br/>
<br/>
I sometimes wish, oddly, that I&#39;d had really lousy parenting myself -- so <br/>
that I&#39;d be less inclined to follow the &quot;pretty darn good&quot; patterns of my own <br/>
mom, and be really aware and make very conscious decisions, like Sandra has <br/>
done.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - my point is that Sandra is really talking about very very VERY <br/>
respectful parenting - not just kinda sorta - and I don&#39;t think that her <br/>
kids, by the way, were genetically just &quot;easy.&quot; <br/>
