<div id="ygrps-yiv-941145719">Our Strange Lingo:<br/>
<br/>
When the English tongue we speak.<br/>
Why is break not rhymed with freak?<br/>
Will you tell me why it&#39;s true<br/>
We say sew but likewise few?<br/>
And the maker of the verse,<br/>
Cannot rhyme his horse with worse?<br/>
Beard is not the same as heard<br/>
Cord is different from word.<br/>
Cow is cow but low is low<br/>
Shoe is never rhymed with foe.<br/>
Think of hose,dose,and lose<br/>
And think of goose and yet with choose<br/>
Think of comb,tomb and bomb,<br/>
Doll and roll or home and some.<br/>
Since pay is rhymed with say<br/>
Why not paid with said I pray?<br/>
Think of blood, food and good.<br/>
Mould is not pronounced like could.<br/>
Wherefore done, but gone and lone-<br/>
Is there any reason known?<br/>
To sum up all, it seems to me<br/>
Sound and letters don&#39;t agree.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-296185689">Oh, I have enjoyed this group a lot, but I have way too many emails coming<br/>
in, and I am spending too much time reading them all, or even deleting them<br/>
all.  I will check back another time with this list.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I need to figure out HOW to unsubscribe from this list?????<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

messages in one email. It&#39;s quicker and psychologically freeing. ;-)<br/>
