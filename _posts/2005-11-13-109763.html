 </span></blockquote>I guess it would depend on the situation kind of.  We had a neighbor <br/>
once that beat their kids, left a young child of about 7 standing in <br/>
the rain for about 2 hours locked out of the house when they weren&#39;t <br/>
there (we took him in to our house when we found him), had no beds <br/>
for the children so we gave them an extra queen sized bed and frame <br/>
and the parents took the bed and the kids didn&#39;t get it according to <br/>
them.  One of the kids was sent to his room for going into the <br/>
fridge and then spanked for looking out the bedroom window after <br/>
being punished for the fridge incident. It was sickening!  We felt <br/>
that for the safety of the children we had a responsibility to get <br/>
the law involved.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, in our situation I feel that it is because our life doesn&#39;t <br/>
remotely resemble what they consider &quot;normal and good&quot; therefore <br/>
they feel the need to try and convince us of our need to change.  So <br/>
I guess in that respect it is different but I see your point with <br/>
what we would consider an unsafe, abusive or neglectful situation.  <br/>
Someone has to stand up for the innocent, in a wierd sort of way I <br/>
think that&#39;s what people think that they are doing for my kids :(<br/>
