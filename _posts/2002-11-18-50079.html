<div id="ygrps-yiv-930984416">Thanks guys for helping me let go with this.<br/>
<br/>
My ds has been taking piano for 3 years and has been off and on <br/>
resistant.  We have kept him at it because he enjoys playing but can <br/>
be easily frustrated with a new piece.  He has a natural talent that <br/>
I enjoy (proud mama that I am) but I don&#39;t want him to hate it.  His <br/>
Dad and I talked with him about his lessons and he is deciding if he <br/>
wants to continue. We explained our reasons (some admittedly selfish) <br/>
and stressed our love.  However it works out, we are proud of his <br/>
accomplishments (which can never be taken away) and support his <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the &quot;pressure&quot; gang!  We are getting there!!<br/>
