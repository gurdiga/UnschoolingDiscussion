<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955236339">I do for my children.  Constantly. I pour water/milk/juice for those who<br/>
want it.  Constantly.  I do sometimes say; no, you can do it yourself, but<br/>
this is rare.  I sometimes am grouchy about it, but not usually.  I<br/>
sometimes say in a minute, and sometimes I need to be reminded that the<br/>
minute is up...or whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
My children, especially the older ones, think I do too much.  For them.  My<br/>
son thinks I am an incredible wimp because I opened a can of tuna for him. <br/>
At age 18.  They have actually yelled at me NOT to help them because I have<br/>
jumped up to get them something or offered to do something for them that<br/>
they could do for themselves. <br/>
<br/>
Children do need loving, and if a child is feeling hurt,ill,scared etc. I<br/>
respond as quickly as possible. <br/>
<br/>
I generally don&#39;t yell about the house and the state of its being...floors<br/>
always coated with toys, no surface free of something. I do contribute to<br/>
the mess, so it isn&#39;t just the children...it is me too.  I have rarely<br/>
demanded that they clean anything; their rooms, the house etc.<br/>
<br/>
So why is it that they seem to disrespect me for these very things?  <br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;So why is it that they seem to disrespect me for these very things?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From your post, it seems like I am pretty much the same way. My husband <br/>
thinks I do for my kids too much also. The kids are so use to the gates <br/>
being up in the kitchen that when they aren&#39;t, the kids put their stuff on <br/>
the counter for me anyway. (pass through from kitchen to playroom) So <br/>
instead of saying, &quot;the gates down put your own glass or plate away&quot;, I grab <br/>
it and do it. What&#39;s the big deal, I&#39;m standing right there. I&#39;ll pour their <br/>
cereal or toast their bagel or poptart or get them a cookie. Again, I enjoy <br/>
doing for them and don&#39;t see it as life altering doing these things. My kids <br/>
do appreciate it. When I ask, &quot;who will help me clean up?&quot; I usually get 2-3 <br/>
responses as in &quot;I&#39;ll help you.&quot; Sometimes it&#39;s only one, I always get at <br/>
least that though. Tonight my daughter was crampy. When I asked if she took <br/>
anything, she said she would. I went and got her some ice tea and the pills <br/>
and brought them to her to take. She&#39;d do the same for me and has.<br/>
<br/>
My husband has a tendency to think sometimes that when kids can do for <br/>
themselves, they should. This doesn&#39;t creep into his thinking often, usually <br/>
only when I&#39;ve had a rough day or haven&#39;t slept in days. Of course he also <br/>
thinks I do too much for him also.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I lost my thought. You were wondering why doing all these things has <br/>
your children not showing you respect. Could it be that you jump up to do <br/>
when you aren&#39;t even asked? I&#39;ve been yelled at by my husband and mom for <br/>
that reason. My mom says I have a rubber butt.....bouncing up and down all <br/>
the time. All someone has to do is mention something and I&#39;m up getting it. <br/>
Usually they had all the intention of getting it themselves. I just won&#39;t <br/>
give them the chance. My husband still jokes that he had to retrain me when <br/>
we met. I was always jumping up to get whatever he wanted. I was previously <br/>
married to one of those guys that Sandra thinks are now 95. They do still <br/>
exist!!<br/>
<br/>
So maybe you are doing too much without being asked and without giving <br/>
anyone a chance to do for themselves. You said you are constantly doing for <br/>
others, maybe slow down and look at exactly what you are doing and what the <br/>
circumstances are at the time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s possible there&#39;s something in your attitude that says &quot;You&#39;ve asked so<br/>
I have to help.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ll ask, Would you feel guilty if you didn&#39;t help them?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen women, supposedly happy women, who are motivated by the need to be<br/>
needed.<br/>
<br/>
I had an aunt like that. Actually she was at the far end of the spectrum of<br/>
needing to be needed. She would go out of her way to do all this stuff for a<br/>
Thanksgiving meal even though she used a walker and was incredibly heavy so<br/>
moving around was a huge chore for her. Our visit created a need for her to<br/>
be needed. It was nice but it was also smothering and actually controlling<br/>
because she also needed the feedback that her enormous efforts were needed<br/>
to the extent she was giving. Though she never asked for the feedback she<br/>
would have occasional bursts of paranoia that people in general were taking<br/>
advantage of her. <br/>
<br/>
And it isn&#39;t like she didn&#39;t have friends. She seemed to have lots of<br/>
friends and they seemed very generous themselves, going out of their way to<br/>
ask her what she needed. Perhaps because she was so happy on the surface and<br/>
generous. The friends supposedly never visited her even though 1 or 2 would<br/>
drop by during the 8 or so hours of our visits. I suspect no one ever quite<br/>
gave back as much as she expected to receive from what she gave.<br/>
<br/>
She *needed* to provide things for us.<br/>
<br/>
She once told me about the young men she dated who wanted to marry her but<br/>
the one she chose is the one she felt sorry for. Perhaps she felt he&#39;s the<br/>
one who needed her most. I suspect she was never happy, but she did what she<br/>
thought was right.<br/>

That might not be a factor at all in your case so you&#39;d need to look for<br/>
more subtle (or big!) things that might be affecting your attitudes and what<br/>

people like my SIL.  She needs to be needed.  When her two older children <br/>
tried to leave the nest she guilted them into coming back home.  &quot;Oh I need <br/>
you, you never know how long your granmother will live...she could die <br/>
tomorrow then wouldn&#39;t you feel bad living soooofar away from home.....&quot;  <br/>
(that was about 5 years ago and Gram is still going strong) &quot;I know you <br/>
passed the bar but do you realllly want to live in Boston...couldn&#39;t you stay <br/>
here in Maine and look for a job...how about waiting until after the <br/>
holidays...I really need you here...How about waiting until after your <br/>
birthday party....&quot;   She is lost without her children, has 4...was so elated <br/>
when the oldest two had career trouble and had to come back home for a few <br/>
weeks.  Didn&#39;t want them to leave.  When the youngest two move out I think <br/>
she will be totally lost.  She has no friends...her job is at the school that <br/>
the two youngest attend so she can be closer to them...<br/>
<br/>
She is a really nice person but her entire life is wrapped up in the children <br/>
with no hobbies of her own.   She needs to be needed.  Very sad actually.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-355759850">Well, you are 1 for 2.  I wasn&#39;t raised in an a alcoholic home.  My parents<br/>
weren&#39;t teetotalers either, they had a normal, or what I would call a normal<br/>

And I too am an introvert; the internet has allowed me to be more vocal than<br/>
I would otherwise.  I hate speaking out, can&#39;t stand large parties etc.  <br/>

me being needed, I see it as me doing a great job. My family is everything <br/>
to me right now as in my number one priority. I have plasn for myself when <br/>
the kids are older, but right now, it&#39;s all about them. So for me, keeping <br/>
them happy and safe and healthy is my job. It&#39;s a job I take very serioulsy <br/>
and make sure I do it well. I also happen to love my job. But again I don&#39;t <br/>
see it for myself as important that I am needed. Although it is important to <br/>
be needed, I don&#39;t exactly look at it that way.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My husband has a tendency to think sometimes that when kids can do for <br/>
themselves, they should. This doesn&#39;t creep into his thinking often, usually <br/>
only when I&#39;ve had a rough day or haven&#39;t slept in days. Of course he also <br/>
thinks I do too much for him also. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wow.  I didn&#39;t know any husbands could feel that way!!<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, sometimes I wish I could go just one week of doing so much my <br/>
husband would say &quot;enough.&quot;   His mom is not friendly, but also militarily <br/>
organized and scheduled and her kitchen is repainted every two years and when <br/>
we went for Thanksgiving she had re-upholstered her dining room chairs which <br/>
are only used for bridge club and Thanksgiving anyway.  She re-upholstered <br/>
them a dozen years or so ago too.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the mean thing Keith did when he was home:<br/>
His whole life, the heat was down too low to save money.  He was cold many <br/>
winter nights growing up.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that his mom is old she turns the heat up.  <br/>
<br/>
He thought it was too hot for him to sleep comfortably and turned the heat <br/>
down on the way to bed.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know that until on the way home, but I did hear his mom get up at <br/>
6:30 or so and mutter and complain to herself that someone had turned it down.<br/>
<br/>
Her being in the bed at 6:30 was notable too.  Usually she&#39;s up making a lot <br/>
of noise at 5:30, making sure everyone feels guilty when they finally drag <br/>
out [too early] at 7:00 and she&#39;s already made breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
Keith got to be 46 years old before he did something as mean as turning the <br/>
heat down on a 78 year old woman (or however old she is).  <br/>
<br/>
That is a case of her doing a LOT but rarely doing anything kind or personal <br/>
or loving for any individual.  If they COULD do it, they SHOULD do it, but <br/>
they would never do it right or well enough or early enough to suit her.<br/>
<br/>
I start to feel guilty for not re-upholstering anything (we did a living room <br/>
chair&#39;s removeable cushions years ago, in patchwork denim), and then I <br/>
remember that I actually care whether my kids are warm enough at night, and I <br/>
try to be quiet so they can sleep as long as they need to.  I don&#39;t even feel <br/>
like I &quot;own the thermostat&quot; here, nor that I own the schedule.  <br/>
<br/>
If we were living on a farm there would be other realities, but we&#39;re living <br/>
on income from my husband&#39;s engineering job, there are no cows to milk, and <br/>
we can focus on human factors in a way few to no generations in the past had <br/>
the luxury of doing.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean to go so far off track, but I think it&#39;s related, in deciding <br/>
who owns what decisions and duties.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s way up there for me.<br/>
But some seasons my friends aren&#39;t needy and I get out of the pattern.  The <br/>
family stuff doesn&#39;t provide the same kind of satisfaction as people coming <br/>
and saying they can&#39;t figure out how to get a service contract fulfilled, or <br/>
that they need to file a grievance at work and want help writing the letter, <br/>
or they&#39;ve just remembered early sexual abuse and want to talk to someone.  <br/>
Its the lawyerish/counsellor stuff that&#39;s fun for me.<br/>
<br/>
When I read the bit about the woman marrying the man who needed her most my <br/>
stomach fluttered, because I did that once.  Just told that story the other <br/>
day.  Instead of marrying the man I had planned to marry, I got in a snit at <br/>
him about something and I married a friend whose parents had died, and he <br/>
would not get custody of his 12 and 10 year old siblings because he was <br/>
unmarried.  They *NEEDED*  me.<br/>
<br/>
I shudder to remember all that.<br/>
<br/>
But my need to be needed seems to have been a predictable pattern of adult <br/>
children of alcoholics.  If I couldn&#39;t save my own mother&#39;s world, maybe the <br/>
emergency response skills I had garnered over the years could be used to save <br/>
OTHER families!   <br/>
<br/>
That lasted three years, and then Keith found me.   He was not as needy.  <br/>
Whether it was good or not, that was 25 years ago.  <br/>

they would never do it right or well enough or early enough to suit her.**<br/>

I don&#39;t think anyone is ever strong and mature enough to learn to do a<br/>
new task under the eagle-eye of a harsh perfectionist.  It&#39;s just asking<br/>
for pain.<br/>

Rachel Ann,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering... might it be possible that they feel that *you* aren&#39;t putting enough faith in them to do these things themselves?<br/>
<br/>
What I mean is: let&#39;s say I&#39;m visiting my mom.  If she fixed my bowl of cereal, picked up my dirty clothes, whatever, I&#39;d feel as though she was treating me like a child.  I would feel that she thought I was an imbecile who couldn&#39;t care for herself.<br/>
<br/>
If it were a situation where I lived there and she continued to do &quot;everything&quot; for me, I&#39;d also start wondering why she seemed to have no respect for herself.  I DO think that part of living in a family means that everyone is responsible to everyone else-- creating a mess and then expecting someone else to clean it up for you is disrespectful.  If this occurred in my household and I&#39;d made a mess and my mom cleaned it up, I&#39;d feel as though she was allowing herself to be treated more like a servant than a mom.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s just me-- but I think that there&#39;s a certain level of give & take here.  Yes, as others have said, sometimes requests for help are a way of asking for something totally different that the child cannot yet articulate.  And sometimes making a mess and expecting mom to take care of it is an expression of disrespect to mom.  And I also think that continually having mom pick up after me would make me feel that she saw me as incompetent AND that she didn&#39;t have much respect for herself as a member of the family.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know... could any of that be what&#39;s going on?  What do you kids say about it, exactly?<br/>

up after them. They just don&#39;t care. Or the task is more overwhelming than<br/>
the results.<br/>
<br/>
If we assume kids are living with the same values that we have, we&#39;re going<br/>
to see their behavior much differently than if we look at the world through<br/>
*their* values.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re going to value having their toys spread out a lot more than having<br/>
the room neat. Even if they appreciate being able to find something when the<br/>
house is neat, that aspect may not be worth the effort needed to keep things<br/>
neat.<br/>
<br/>
If your husband valued a well scoured garage floor and expected you to scour<br/>
it if you tracked dirt on it, if you left it to him, would that be a sign of<br/>
disrespect? Or would you be respecting your own need to determine what was<br/>
worth your time and energy?<br/>

My mom used to spank my baby brother (I was 19/20 and up and out, and saw her <br/>
swat a baby in a crib, way more than once) because he was &quot;being <br/>
manipulative,&quot; and because he &quot;didn&#39;t care if he woke people up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Children do not think like adults.  Accusing them of being manipulative or <br/>
cold or disrespectful doesn&#39;t help.<br/>
