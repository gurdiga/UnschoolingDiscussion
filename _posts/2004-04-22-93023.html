<div id="ygrps-yiv-537865797">Just had a cool unschooling moment --<br/>
<br/>
       Driving DD14 to ballet class this afternoon, we had the radio on NPR <br/>
as usual, when we heard this young, girlish voice talking about guns -- <br/>
shooting guns and owning guns and how guns weren&#39;t just for self-defense but lots of <br/>
fun. Turns out it was the author of a book called &quot;Blown Away!&quot; (DD shuddered <br/>
-- we must&#39;ve missed any explanation there might have been about why this <br/>
wasn&#39;t as awful a title for a gun book as it sounded)<br/>
<br/>
       So now we&#39;re both paying attention to this unexpected topic of girls <br/>
and guns. <br/>
<br/>
       Understand that guns are no part of any real experience she&#39;s had, or <br/>
any curiosity she&#39;s ever expressed. So this was totally new to her, and quite <br/>
uncommon territory for me too.  <br/>
<br/>
       We turn the interview up. The author says authoritatively that 75% of <br/>
all girls and women over the age of 12 will be a crime victim and a third of <br/>
those crimes will be violent. So of course we need to know how to protect <br/>
ourselves and guns are the ideal way to shift power from men to women so they won&#39;t <br/>
be victimized (she goes on at some length about this.) <br/>
<br/>
       My first thought was that DD needn&#39;t be unduly scared (not of guns but <br/>
men!) so I commented that as a very tall and strong woman, I had never felt <br/>
any particular need to arm myself against men. Even as a 12-year-old I was used <br/>
to be mistaken for an adult and to looking down on my share of bald spots! So <br/>
it never occurred to me to look for a way not to be victimized by men.<br/>
<br/>
       Then I thought I&#39;d change the subject from defense against crime and <br/>
the need to take power away from men, maybe by focusing on the math to see if <br/>
maybe the statistics weren&#39;t as bad as they sounded (I was trying to guessimate <br/>
it quickly in my own mind, thinking the self-protection need seemed <br/>
unrealistically high for boring, middle-class, university town dwellers like us.)<br/>
<br/>
       DD hates math almost to the point of being phobic about it. And I <br/>
wasn&#39;t trying to teach it to her, I promise! But here was something she was <br/>
riveted by at the moment, even if not exactly in a &quot;good&quot; way. <br/>
<br/>
       So, I muse aloud that if all the women over twelve were a whole <br/>
dollar, then the author&#39;s 75% figure meant that 75 cents of that dollar became crime <br/>
victims. She nods and looks at me for more (I&#39;m still driving, remember.)<br/>
<br/>
       Well, then if one-third of those victims experience &quot;violent&quot; crime <br/>
and one way of making 75 cents is with three quarters, then one-third of 75 is <br/>
one of those quarters, right? She looks surprised and smiles, and nods again.<br/>
<br/>
       So I say that&#39;s a lot less than three quarters of all women, isn&#39;t it? <br/>
Now we can see that three-quarters of all women WON&#39;T ever be a victim of <br/>
violent crime, right? She is looking much more comfortable -- at least as I&#39;m <br/>
hurtling down the interstate thinking there are all kinds of self-defense and <br/>
good driving is maybe a lot more important than good shooting to us &lt;grin&gt; -- <br/>
when I have a further thought, spontaneous and maybe ill-advised if my purpose <br/>
was to make her feel safe, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
       &quot;Oh! And they say on average, violence tends to happen from people you <br/>
know, right?&quot; I say. Because that&#39;s who you are with almost all the time, so <br/>
this makes sense. Strangers don&#39;t figure into girls&#39; normal lives that much, <br/>
relative to relatives anyway.<br/>
<br/>
       I explain there must be all the kinds of violence against teens -- <br/>
girls older than 12 but too young for responsible gun ownership at say, 18 -- <br/>
violence that happens in bad home situations with people girls know but wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have a gun to protect themselves against, like date rape and stepfathers and <br/>
strange &quot;uncles&quot; or neighbors. <br/>
<br/>
       So I wonder if that 12-year-old statistic is a key to this picture, I <br/>
say. Maybe if they set the crime-counting starting point at 18- or 21-year-old <br/>
women, the statistics would be quite different? We conclude together that <br/>
teens could be at least half of those violence victims, and thus maybe only one <br/>
woman in ten who COULD actually use a gun responsibly for self-protection ever <br/>
would have cause to do so in her lifetime. And more importantly to us, that <br/>
nine out of ten won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
       She is thinking along with me now, and about math! And reason. About <br/>
something real that matters to her life. And she&#39;s *really* good at the <br/>
thinking and reasoning part, even with no previous knowledge of guns or violence, and <br/>
almost none of simple fractions, much less of statistical misrepresentations <br/>
for effect!<br/>
<br/>
       But that&#39;s not the good part in my mind. HERE&#39;s the good part. <br/>
<br/>
       Again without knowing what I&#39;m gonna say until it comes out of my <br/>
mouth, I start to admire her thinking and reasoning ability, and how well we just <br/>
worked through the issue without being stampeded to a false and possibly <br/>
dangerous conclusion, and I say *that* is a form of power, too. A way that girls <br/>
and women can arm themselves at any age, not only protect to themselves <br/>
physically but against all manner of victimization, criminal or not, from any source <br/>
-- and it was more important than any other method because I could guarantee <br/>
there was a 100% chance there&#39;d be cause to use it. Hadn&#39;t we just needed and <br/>
used it, in fact?<br/>
<br/>
       Laughing now, she called out her own new statistic: Arm yourselves <br/>
against stupidity! One-hundred percent of all girls and women will be the victims <br/>
of attempted stupidity today!<br/>
<br/>
       I don&#39;t know what percent of her day was improved by that little <br/>
moment, or what value she would place on it, but I can speak for mine. Priceless! <br/>
:) :)  JJ<br/>

JJ - thanks for sharing this wonderful moment.  the message will serve her more than (well at least certainly as much as) math ever will in her entire lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
I am in awe of *your* own reasoning and recognizing the beauty of the moment that reaches so far beyond math.  I needed to wake up to this story today.<br/>

JJ, I am curious - what makes an unschooler hate math?  Lisa H.<br/>
