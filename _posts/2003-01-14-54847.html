<div id="ygrps-yiv-325197587">I was reading in Summerhill today (about the school started in 1921 in<br/>
England, by A. S. Neill) and wanted to share some quotes.  Even though it<br/>
was (is?) a school, it is really like unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, we set out to make a school in which we should allow children freedom<br/>
to be themselves.  In order to do this, we had to renounce all discipline,<br/>
all direction, all suggestion, all moral training, all religious<br/>
instruction...<br/>
My view is that a child is inately wise and realistic.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What is Summerhill like?  Well, for one thing, lessons are optional.<br/>
Children can go to them or stay away from them - for years if they want to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We have no new methods of teaching, because we do not consider that<br/>
teaching in itself matters very much.Whether a school has or has not a<br/>
special method for teaching long division is of no significance, for long<br/>
division is of no importance except to those who WANT to learn it.  And the<br/>
child who WANTS to learn long division WILL learn it no matter how it is<br/>
taught.&quot;  [I used caps where he used italics.  Also, this sounded like a<br/>
recent conversation I&#39;d read here.  This next part does too]<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Children who come to Summerhill as kindergarteners attend lessons from the<br/>
beginning of their stay; but pupils from other schools vow that they will<br/>
never attend any beastly lessons again at any time.  They play and cycle and<br/>
get in people&#39;s way, but they fight shy of lessons.  This sometimes goes on<br/>
for months.  The recovery time is proportionate to the hatred their last<br/>
school gave them.  Our record case was a girl from a convent.  She loafed<br/>
for three years.  The average period of recovery from lesson aversion is<br/>
three months.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Creators learn what they want to learn in order to have the tools that<br/>
their originality and genius demand.  We do not know how much creation is<br/>
killed in the classroom  [or structured homeschool?]  with its emphasis on<br/>
learning... This notion that unless a child is learning something the child<br/>
is wasting his time is nothing less than a curse - a curse that blinds<br/>
thousands of teachers...&quot;  [and parents?]<br/>
