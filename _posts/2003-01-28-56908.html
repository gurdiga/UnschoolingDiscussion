<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have not been super stringent about practicing in that I have never sat<br/>
&gt; with her and required her to do all the teacher asked her to do(she is way<br/>
&gt; beyond me musically, I am still in the middle of book one and painstakingly<br/>
&gt; moving forward, lol.  She took traditional piano for four years before we<br/>
&gt; switched to Suzuki). I have always asked that she practice every day, but<br/>
&gt; understood when we didn&#39;t get time occasionally, etc.  Still, she was<br/>
&gt; practicing more before we decided to unschool (only a month or so).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, I am not banning words here.  Don&#39;t anybody get jumpy.  However, I<br/>
HATE the word practice.  Can&#39;t she just PLAY piano?  Every time you sit<br/>
down, you&#39;re playing.  Really.  Sometimes I play the same thing over and<br/>
over, attempting to play it better, but I&#39;m really playing.  Practicing<br/>
sounds like copying letters out of the handwriting workbook.  BORING.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a musicican, so I&#39;m going to suggest some things.  They probably won&#39;t<br/>
all work, but maybe there will be something in here useful to you.<br/>
<br/>
*sit down with her when she plays.  How appealing is it to struggle alone?<br/>
I like my husband in the kitchen for company when I&#39;m cleaning it, she might<br/>
really appreciate your being there.  You don&#39;t have to be technically<br/>
advanced to make positive comments and constructive criticism.<br/>
<br/>
*start playing piano yourself.  If she wants to play and asks you to move,<br/>
GREAT!  Don&#39;t put her off.  hearing the music might inspire her.<br/>
<br/>
*ask her to help you.  If your&#39;e making painstaking progress, surely she<br/>
could come up with some good ideas.  Have her check your position, hold a<br/>
paper over your hands so you try playing without checking your fingers, etc.<br/>
<br/>
*get up before her in the morning and have the cd playing then, softly.<br/>
Maybe it will catch her attention while she does the usual mornint routine.<br/>
<br/>
*play the cd in the car on the way to your lessons.  dub it onto tape if<br/>
your car doesn&#39;t have a cd player, and bring a tape deck along if you&#39;re as<br/>
cheap as me and only have a radio.<br/>
<br/>
*go to the local music shop and dig through the easy music for beginners to<br/>
find something she&#39;d like to play.  Suzuki is a fine method, but they don&#39;t<br/>
have the Flintsones or the Love Theme from Titanic, or whatever.  While<br/>
you&#39;re there, encourage her to play through her songs on the various<br/>
electric keyboards.  Set them to make different sounds -- harpsichord,<br/>
laughing, tuba, bomb, etc.  Laugh at how silly the songs sound like that.<br/>
<br/>
*encourage your daughter to pick out tunes she likes without music, or<br/>
improvise with sounds.<br/>
<br/>
*unschool piano.  don&#39;t just take piano lessons, figure out how the thing<br/>
works, or go to concerts and critique performers, or listen to other cds,<br/>
search the internet for info on piano competitions, watch tv shows with<br/>
pianists in them, etc.  whatever interests her.<br/>
<br/>
good luck, and enjoy.<br/>

I am so sorry for that &quot;practice&quot; word.  I did remember in a later post and<br/>
stated  that I was &quot;playing&quot; piano today, &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most the time she does not want me to do this.  She is 13.  But when she<br/>
asks I come.  She prefers I make no comment at all.  But, during lessons,<br/>
she looks to me for encouragement all the time.  (We both sit through the<br/>
other&#39;s lesson, I take notes for her while she has her lesson, she doodles<br/>
for me when I have mine, lol.)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; GREAT!  Don&#39;t put her off.  hearing the music might inspire her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, this happens about every time.  But, am I suppose to then give up the<br/>
piano to her.  She will usually come over and tell me how something should<br/>
be done, and the next thing I know she is playing and wondering why I am<br/>
there bothering  her.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She loves to  help me, but she is quite the tyrant in this regard and does<br/>
not have the patience for my mistakes.  I am trying patiently to get her to<br/>
see that this is not a natural for me.  We will continue to work on this,<br/>
lol.<br/>

We do have plenty of other music which she plays around with sometimes.  She<br/>
also picks up her flute and plays the Suzuki songs or other songs she has<br/>
heard.  She and her brother will sit down and pick out tunes they have heard<br/>
on a cd or the radio.  BTW, all of this amazes me because there is no way I<br/>
could do that.<br/>

<br/>
We will definitely start trying to do this a little more.  I am clueless<br/>
when it comes to picking out music to listen to though, but maybe I can ask<br/>
her piano teacher.  She loves to go into the music store and play with the<br/>
keyboards and such, but that doesn&#39;t happen often.  We live in the middle of<br/>
nowhere.  But, I can try to make more of a point of it when we go to<br/>
lessons.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for all  the great ideas, I will use them!<br/>

Depends whether you really wanted to play it. <br/>
<br/>
That happens with us and the computer.  If I really want it back I say so.  <br/>
If not, Marty or Keith keeps it and I wander off to do laundry or watch a DVD <br/>
(I&#39;m watching them in bursts, now, fifteen minutes or a half an hour at a <br/>
time, since it will pick up again where I quit--I LOVE that!) or play with <br/>
the dog or eat.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;m happy to GET the computer and sometimes I&#39;m willing to be <br/>
relieved of it.<br/>
<br/>
When my pump organ was new, playing it would lure other people to want to <br/>
take it away from me.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe when you want your daughter to play a while, you should go up and play <br/>
and she&#39;ll hear it and maybe want you to STOP playing ! &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
