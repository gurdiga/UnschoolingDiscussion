<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481367916">-=-It&#39;s none of anyone else&#39;s business what they do <br/>
with their kids -=-<br/>
<br/>
::looking around::<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in my house.  My boys are home.  Kirby&#39;s in the library with five boys <br/>
all older than he is.  They&#39;re playing a WWF card game.  Marty is shooting <br/>
baskets in the back by himself.  Holly has gone to a neighbor&#39;s house, <br/>
another homeschooling family four blocks away.  When I dropped her off at <br/>
6:57 I said &quot;Call when you want a ride!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;I&#39;ll try to call before 10:00 this time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Okay, but if it&#39;s after 10:00 I&#39;ll come and get you anyway.  Have <br/>
fun!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is it anyone&#39;s business here what my kids are doing and what I think about it?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Because it&#39;s a list to discuss unschooling, and we&#39;re unschooling, and <br/>
I&#39;m sharing my life with other unschoolers so they can see how it can work.  <br/>
I&#39;m not the only one.  Lots of families are doing the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Some families volunteer at church, or with scouts, or political parties, or <br/>
whatever.  Lots of families volunteer to run homeschooling support groups, or <br/>
to put on conferences, or put out newsletters for homeschoolers, or whatever <br/>
it is.  Some families are active helping other ways.<br/>
<br/>
There are 900 people on this list.  Lots are on &quot;no mail,&quot; meaning they go to <br/>
the website and read the archives sometimes.  My husband has ALL his <br/>
yahoogroups set to no mail, but he reads them almost every day.  <br/>
<br/>
I met someone this weekend I had never heard of, but she reads this list and <br/>
another one I&#39;m on and could talk all about it, but she doesn&#39;t post.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants what they do to be none of our business, that&#39;s EASY!  They <br/>
don&#39;t volunteer what they do!<br/>
<br/>
If someone DOES post what they do, what they think about it, and why, and <br/>
what they think about people who don&#39;t do it that way, then they have invited <br/>
other readers to comment.  And if they can&#39;t defend what they&#39;re doing, they <br/>
might want to consider doing it differently.   If someone asks me why I think <br/>
what I think, I tell them why.  Anytime I can&#39;t, I start thinking carefully <br/>
about what it is and why.  I&#39;m always willing to consider better ideas.  My <br/>
beliefs have changed over my lifetime lots of times, about all kinds of <br/>
things, because I&#39;ve looked over other people&#39;s shoulders and they were <br/>
generous enough to tell me what they were doing and why.  <br/>
<br/>
If it weren&#39;t for La Leche League volunteers, I would not have the <br/>
relationship with my kids I have today.  If it weren&#39;t for other moms going <br/>
to meetings even when they were already good with nursing and didn&#39;t much <br/>
need the help, I wouldn&#39;t have had as many excellent mothering examples.<br/>
<br/>
If it weren&#39;t for people organizing and maintaining an Adult Children of <br/>
Alcoholics meeting in the mid and late 1980&#39;s, and if it hadn&#39;t been for a <br/>
couple of friends pressing me to check it out, and one DRIVING me there the <br/>
first many times, because my leg was in a cast, I would still be acting out <br/>
frustrating nonsense related to  my mom&#39;s drinking.  I would still be trying <br/>
to save, maintain and accidently enable her.<br/>
<br/>
They allowed what they believed and did to be part of my business.<br/>
<br/>
People are free to share here or not.  <br/>
People are not required to say &quot;Oh, cool!&quot; about things they believe are not <br/>
cool.<br/>

&gt;Yes.  Because it&#39;s a list to discuss unschooling, and we&#39;re unschooling, <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right, but at the same time, you have to consider that your (meaning <br/>
anyone on this list)way of unschooling is different from others and that <br/>
doesn&#39;t make your (again anyone&#39;s) way the only right way. And when someone <br/>
doesn&#39;t ask for advice, it&#39;s not fair for someone to give it or make rude <br/>
comments about it or attack it. Now at the same time, when someone has a <br/>
question or problem or asks about how and why people do things, that&#39;s a <br/>
legitimate &quot;open discussion time.&quot; If someone else thinks there is a better <br/>
way for someone to approach something when they haven&#39;t asked for help, <br/>
there&#39;s just more courteous ways of asking instead of showing them how wrong <br/>
they are. There&#39;s been a lot of that going on here. For people who are <br/>
suppose to be so aware of treating everyone equally, I see just the opposite <br/>
here at times.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been very careful to say &quot;in my family&quot; or &quot;what works for us&quot; and <br/>
&quot;some people&quot; and &quot;some of what I see&quot; etc. so I don&#39;t step on toes just out <br/>
of respect. Others here have not done that and I don&#39;t think, in very simple <br/>
terms that it&#39;s nice.<br/>
<br/>
And I know many read, I just think more would post if they weren&#39;t afraid of <br/>
being put on trial. We all need to have discussions to question why we do <br/>
what we do, it helps us all to evaluate what we do and maybe change it also. <br/>
But pointing fingers as soon as someone makes a comment that others don&#39;t <br/>
like is silly. Can&#39;t one just ask without making the person feel like <br/>
Hitler?<br/>
<br/>
And this whole bedtime/porno/cursing post has got everyone so worked up, I <br/>
can&#39;t get an honest answer to a problem I was hoping for some solutions to. <br/>
Kama Sutra has taken priority.<br/>

<br/>
There are some irritating sayings going around these years.  One is &quot;all <br/>
ideas are equally valid,&quot; and that&#39;s nonsense.  And another is &quot;There are as <br/>
many ways to unschool as there are unschoolers&quot; and that&#39;s no more true than <br/>
the other.<br/>
<br/>
Just because there&#39;s more than one truth doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no such thing <br/>
as bullshit.  There ARE things that run counter to unschooling.  Nobody has <br/>
the only right way, but there ARE wrong ways.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And when someone doesn&#39;t ask for advice, it&#39;s not fair for someone to give <br/>

We can discuss 18 things at once here.  You don&#39;t have to wait for one topic <br/>

not rude to make comments about what someone has posted. The main reason <br/>
someone posts here is for discussion. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If someone else thinks there is a better <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From now on, just read the *implied* &quot;in my family&quot; or &quot;what works for us&quot; <br/>
and &quot;some people&quot; and &quot;some of what I see&quot; etc. It is what we all mean, but <br/>
don&#39;t write. Its kinda like the implied &quot;you&quot; in English class. I remember <br/>
doing countless drills with sentences pointing out the implied &quot;you.&quot; (Go to <br/>
the store. &quot;implied you&quot; Please bring me that toilet-paper. &quot;implied you&quot; ) <br/>
It isn&#39;t stepping on toes or being rude. It isn&#39;t disrespectful. <br/>

while and know others posting styles, it isn&#39;t nice to dissect peoples <br/>
posting styles. Some here don&#39;t use their spell checker. I can&#39;t stand that. <br/>
But you don&#39;t see me raging around saying &quot;that&#39;s not nice&quot; or &quot;no fair&quot; I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do that, cause I misspell tons, and would hate to have someone point <br/>
out my spelling mistakes that I didn&#39;t catch. Or to turn it around, I have <br/>
horrible grammatical skills. You wouldn&#39;t know it to hear me speak, I do that <br/>
very well. But to read what I write, you might think I am some illiterate <br/>
bumpkin. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, most don&#39;t post because of time constraints, or family or whatever else. <br/>
Most are on *no mail* and read posts at random. Many do post, when the topics <br/>
roll around to something they are interested in. And on that vein, the topics <br/>
do roll around. &lt;g&gt; Much like this topic of finger pointing, we discuss this <br/>
one about once every 4 to 6 weeks or so. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And when someone doesn&#39;t ask for advice, it&#39;s not fair for someone to give<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;What was the thing nobody asked about?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well in the past few days, there have been quite a few things said just as <br/>
in &quot;this is what I do&quot; that some people have had a field day with. If <br/>
someone says that they don&#39;t allow certain programs to be watched by their <br/>
kids, then if anyone has a problem with that, I would think the reasonable <br/>
thing to do is ask &quot;Why?&quot; not tell them that they are wrong. When I say I <br/>
won&#39;t let my baby eat a whole bag of MM&#39;s when we&#39;re talking about saying <br/>
no, I don&#39;t expect to have to go through the whole diarrhea thing to justify <br/>
myself because someone tells me I don&#39;t &quot;know&quot; what I&#39;m really saying. A <br/>
simple &quot;have you let her do that&quot; would have solved the whole thing in one <br/>
post. Those are just two examples.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For people who are suppose to be so aware of treating everyone <br/>
equally...&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t understand what is intended by this.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Meaning that from how you all sound so respectful of your children&#39;s <br/>
feelings and thoughts, some seem not so courteous when it comes to some <br/>
people on this list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt;topic<br/>
&gt;to settle to start another one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I know I posted about a problem I would have loved to have any answer <br/>
to at all and got none. I also saw another woman post about having time <br/>
enough for each child and as far as I saw, I was the only one that responded <br/>
to that one too.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Meaning that from how you all sound so respectful of your children&#39;s <br/>
feelings and thoughts, some seem not so courteous when it comes to some <br/>
people on this list. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If my children say things which are not right or good, I challenge them to <br/>
explain WHY they&#39;re thinking what they&#39;re thinking.  If they can&#39;t, they drop <br/>
it and adopt something else to claim or believe.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other people have made arguments like that in the past too, that we should <br/>
treat all people on e-mail lists as we treat our children, and I don&#39;t see <br/>
how it follows.  If my neighbor gets drunk and is playing in my back yard, I <br/>
will tell him to go home.  If a guest comes in, invited, and starts going <br/>
through all the cabinets, I&#39;ll ask him what he&#39;s looking for.  I wouldn&#39;t ask <br/>
my child that.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And the word &quot;equally&quot; is what made me wonder what was intended:  &quot;&lt;&lt;For <br/>
people who are suppose to be so aware of treating everyone equally...&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I treat each child as is appropriate to that child&#39;s preferences and needs <br/>
and situation.  &quot;Equally&quot; is rarely the consideration.  More money is spent <br/>
on Holly, more talking with Kirby than Marty, Marty is more likely to help <br/>
with yard work because he kinda likes it, etc.  I touch Marty  more than I <br/>
touch Kirby; he hugs me spontaneously, still.  Kirby&#39;s not a touchy/feely guy.<br/>

Okay, agreed but no one said that all homeschooling was unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
Okay so maybe most covers all you have just spoke of but there are some out <br/>
there,just can&#39;t say how many who are rather afraid to get anything started <br/>
because they just can&#39;t handle the outcome. I know some may say then they <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be on the list and some have left because of that but I thought <br/>
maybe trying to help them feel comfortable would be a good thing to do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This and similar suggestions on how people should post recur. It seems a<br/>
reasonable suggestion. But in truth how others help isn&#39;t in our power to<br/>
control. And people *are* trying to be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
As PamS says so much better, telling people how they should post never -- in<br/>
all the years I&#39;ve been on line -- leads to anything postive.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well I know I posted about a problem I would have loved to have any answer<br/>

 </span></blockquote>None? As in no responses? Posts on new topics often get lost when one topic<br/>
(and it&#39;s multiple subtopics) is occupying the list. Not just this list. All<br/>
lists. As Pam did, it&#39;s helpful to wait a bit and repost.<br/>
<br/>
But perhaps people just don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps they didn&#39;t understand your question. Or you didn&#39;t understand<br/>
their answers. Or your question got lost in the larger discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Try posting your question again.<br/>

chose to or expect everyone else to treat everyone equally in every respect <br/>
of the word. (There we go with those words again!) For God&#39;s sake I have 4 <br/>
children!!<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m in the grocery store and someone says I better get out of their way, <br/>
I&#39;ll make sure I know how they mean that before I respond. Someone may just <br/>
be joking with me or just be having a really bad day. Either way, I&#39;ll try <br/>
to find out first before I laugh it off or ask them if they&#39;re always this <br/>
cranky.<br/>

<br/>
When people post at www.unschooling.com, or here, or anywhere, I don&#39;t treat <br/>
equally those who are saying &quot;We tried this and it seemed almost to work, but <br/>
I&#39;m still worried&quot; and those who come in and say &quot;Well in OUR family WE care <br/>
whether our children get into college, so we can&#39;t leave reading to chance.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One is sincerely wanting input and discussion.  The other is there for <br/>
self-aggrandizement and to put down those of us who &quot;just leave reading to <br/>
chance,&quot; and don&#39;t care whether our children get into college.<br/>
<br/>
Equality is not the goal when discussing philosophy.  Ideas and their <br/>
refinement are te purposes of philosophical discussions.<br/>

As PamS says so much better, telling people how they should post never<br/>
-- in<br/>
all the years I&#39;ve been on line -- leads to anything postive.**<br/>
<br/>
In the case when people absolutely can&#39;t resist commenting on someone&#39;s<br/>
posting style, please, I&#39;m begging, actually quote something.  Find the<br/>
words that sounded rude or overgeneral to you.   <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s absolutely no way to get deeper and clarify tone and meaning if<br/>
the provocative bits aren&#39;t quoted.<br/>
<br/>
Vagueness and paraphrasing just lead to hand-waving and eye-rolling.<br/>
Possibly followed by &quot;did not&quot; -- &quot;did so&quot;.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt; But there have been people here who have actually said that someone was <br/>
 being rude. Those first words weren&#39;t mine. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I called someone rude.<br/>
Rude for calling someone else obtuse, because it was rude.<br/>
Rude for saying &quot;you don&#39;t even pay attention to your kids&quot; because it wasn&#39;t <br/>
true, not even a little bit.<br/>
But I shouldn&#39;t have replied the way I did, and Joyce kindly reminded me to <br/>
take a deep breath, which is exactly what I did for a night....lots of them.<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s rude to tell people what we do, or to question parent&#39;s <br/>
that are saying things that in the light of unschoooling, need to be <br/>
questioned.<br/>
I do think it&#39;s rude to accuse them of ignoring their kids when it&#39;s obvious <br/>
no one is advocating that. Or to call them names.<br/>
But hopefully there will be a calmer discussion now, and an ability to get on <br/>
the same page with definitions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In real life we have tone and body language and environment to give us<br/>
additional clues to what people&#39;s words might mean. Here all we have is<br/>
words and a few internet typing conventions to convey our meaning.<br/>
<br/>
In real life we&#39;re right there and can have an exchange in a few seconds<br/>
about whether someone really meant what they said.<br/>
<br/>
On an email list that would get mighty awkward! *Everyone* who felt<br/>
compelled to respond to a post would have to double check first to make sure<br/>
the person really meant what they posted? And then they&#39;d have to wait hours<br/>
or maybe until the next day to get a response so they could answer? And all<br/>
those extra emails on a list that&#39;s already too busy for many people?<br/>
<br/>
It works a *whole* lot smoother if everyone does their best to say what they<br/>
mean the first time.<br/>
<br/>
The words we choose -- in email especially -- are important. It&#39;s all<br/>
someone else has to go on.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It would be a very nice thing to do. But moving from a place of comfort to a<br/>
strange place that looks better is a very uncomfortable thing to do. Some<br/>
people can let go and travel along the path in comfort. But most people want<br/>
to cling to what makes them comfortable while they&#39;re trying something new.<br/>
<br/>
If they want to get unschooling they can&#39;t stay stuck. Though we can<br/>
acknowledge that wanting to cling is a natural feeling and offer sympathy,<br/>
supporting where they&#39;re stuck as an okay place so they can feel comfortable<br/>
makes the discussion not about unschooling but about some path that maybe<br/>
could lead to unschooling.<br/>
