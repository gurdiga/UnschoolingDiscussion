&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve learned from reading the posts is that the<br/>
 strewing is fine, as long as you don&#39;t get hung up on<br/>
 the outcome (I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t remember who exactly<br/>
 said that, but to me, that was a really important<br/>
 point.) Isn&#39;t that something really fundamental about<br/>
 unschooling? To focus on the process rather than the<br/>
 outcome? On the love of learning, not on objective<br/>
 measures like tests? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, yes on the strewing thing. I agree that it&#39;s very natural to point out <br/>
things that might interest your children (Dh and I do it all the time for <br/>
each other) and if the point is just to share life with each other, it&#39;s <br/>
fine!!<br/>
I like to think that instead of focusing on the love of learning, we&#39;re just <br/>
focusing on living a joyful, interesting life together. But the outcome of <br/>
that IS a love of learning......<br/>
And so on.<br/>
And I believe it was Betty that said if we aren&#39;t hung up on the outcome <br/>
phrase.<br/>
