 </span></blockquote>My niece did the same thing when she turned 18. For about two years<br/>
previously she had been discussing it with her Mom, almost as an &quot;I dare<br/>
you to say no&quot; thing. Mom laid down the law, and told her if she got one<br/>
that she was out of the house. More out of rebellion than anything<br/>
else,on her 18th birthday my niece went and got a tatoo, and pierced her<br/>
nose, and pierced her bellybutton, and found an apartment. Well now, at<br/>
21, she is back at home with Mom, asking her mom why she can&#39;t get past<br/>
the first interview for any job she has applied at, sad about the scar<br/>
she has on her nose where her piercing got all infected. She actually<br/>
told her Mom that if she would have just said it would be fine if you get<br/>
a tattoo, that she probably wouldn&#39;t have had it done. Maybe if you just<br/>
told your sons that it was fine, and took the younger ones to see how it<br/>
was done and how painful it is, maybe the glamor and desire would be<br/>
gone. Maybe you or your husband could put on a really good fake tattoo<br/>
for a while, to show them how silly it could look when they get older. Go<br/>
out in public places with your sons, bearing a big old tribal tat across<br/>
your forehead. Maybe they&#39;ll get the idea.<br/>
I was told that I couldn&#39;t get my ears pierced until I was 14. So on my<br/>
14th birthday I went to the mall and had my ears pierced....5 times. At<br/>
least the holes weren&#39;t permanent.<br/>
I am definetely not looking forward to teenagers!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-859548121">I remember when my brother got his ear pierced. I helped him keep it a secret from<br/>
my dad. My dad was not happy but survived finding out. Now 15 + years later, my dad<br/>
has 2 tattoos (as does his wife). My dad is a very straight laced, retired air<br/>
force colonel (reserves), republican  who also has a cpa. His wife is a vp of <br/>
personnel of a hospital.<br/>
<br/>
My brother has added a tattoo, a nipple ring and a tongue ring. He also has gone through<br/>
various hair styles and colors. He is a great guy...never into drugs or drinking. Loves<br/>
playing bass in a band, teaches violin to kids (who love him because he is so cool).<br/>
He has a great head on his shoulders. For awhile he was volunteering at the Red Cross<br/>
driving senior citizens around phoenix. The little old ladies loved him, he has that<br/>
kind of personality. He also put thought into his self-expression...he did not want <br/>
anything that too extreme or that he would regret having when he got older. They are <br/>
very discretely placed.<br/>
<br/>
My hubby got a tattoo 2 years ago...a really cool celtic band around his ankle. I have<br/>
been trying to get up enough nerve to get a small one. I get faint really easily.<br/>
My brother nearly fainted himself when he heard that I might get one LOL! I guess<br/>
I don&#39;t seem the type... ;o)<br/>

I have my nose pierced (never got infected because I made sre to use a <br/>
reputable pircer and followed their instructions for cleaning. And it didn&#39;t <br/>
really hurt.<br/>
DH & I also have tattoos. Neither of us look &quot;silly&quot; now that we are older.<br/>
Body art is an extremely personal thing and not an easy decision for anyone. <br/>
I hope my children can feel that they can come to me and discuss such a big <br/>
(permanent) decision with me. I try to let them know that. My older two ahve <br/>
already asked for piercings, dredlocks, and multicolored hair. (They are 9 & <br/>
15) Neither have any of those yet, probably because I said sure. I&#39;ll take <br/>
you. Let&#39;s find out how much it costs, how it&#39;s done, pros & cons and they <br/>
can decide. I think Emily would look rather cute in dreds!<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that the job interviews are not going well because of her <br/>
tattoos and piercings. Unless she is wearing clothing that shows her belly <br/>
button ring (clothing would be the problem not the piercing). I suggest you <br/>
suggest to her that she ask the interviewer when turned down for a job, what <br/>
she could do next time that would improve her interviewing skills. Many <br/>
people don&#39;t interview well. I wouldn&#39;t blame it on body art that shouldn&#39;t <br/>
even be exposed during a job interview.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713096672">I really appreciate all the replies about the tattoo strain I started. You<br/>
have been very helpful in allowing me to look into your window. My son who<br/>
turned 18 yesterday said he is getting his tattoo tonight (some sort of Led<br/>

then I thought what was the point if no one could see it.<br/>
<br/>
What I would really appreciate from anyone who could help is a<br/>
recommendation of something to read regarding the nature of control and the<br/>
desire to be accepted by a mainstream standard.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a reason those guys, and any job really, has the suit and<br/>
tie dress code expectation.  People who pay major amounts of money<br/>
for a product want some assurance that the place is &quot;respectable&quot;.<br/>
One of the ways they visually assure people of their care for their<br/>
concerns is the dress code. <br/>
<br/>
A good talk about dress code use could save her some time not<br/>
applying for jobs that she probably doesn&#39;t want anyway.<br/>

should be hired on her merits instead of looks. I explained to her that<br/>
car dealers in particular already have a high turnover rate, and most<br/>
likely won&#39;t give someone in doubt a chance. I think the fact that she<br/>
refused to consider removing the nose ring or covering the tattoo made<br/>
her appear to upper management as not being a &quot;team player&quot;.<br/>

there.&lt;grin&gt;<br/>
After applying for about 6 other jobs in various fields, she finally<br/>
landed a job working night shift at Dunkin Donuts. I guess she can meet<br/>
cute guys there too.<br/>
