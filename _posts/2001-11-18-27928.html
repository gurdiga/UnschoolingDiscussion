<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049432716">I had that same problem except that it was my dh&#39;s mother who insisted on<br/>
giving him treats like funnel cakes at the fair!  I realized it was<br/>
because she always did it on Sunday afternoon which meant he would be<br/>
home with me before the real symptoms started.  She really believed I was<br/>
wrong about his allergies because she had not actually seen it.  I<br/>
threatened to leave him there for four days if she did it again.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t say it to her directly, I told my dh and he passed it along in<br/>
kinder words.  But she hasn&#39;t done it again.<br/>
