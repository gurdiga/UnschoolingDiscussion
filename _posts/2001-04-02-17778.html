&gt; Hi Bonnie... I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re still looking for info re: Pre-Paid<br/>
&gt; Legal, and if Judi is not a rep I am, and you can check into the membership<br/>
&gt; via my website if you like at:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; www.prepaidlegal.com/go/ninacs<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Click on the membership Info tab and then on the US flag to find your state.<br/>
&gt; From there you can get info about the membership detail for the state you<br/>
&gt; live in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If Judi has already sent you info or to her website, please ignore this<br/>
&gt; email.. I looked several digest down and didn&#39;t see any further info to/for<br/>
&gt; you and thought you might like to explore it further.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Take care!!<br/>
&gt; Nina<br/>
&gt; <br/>

    I love the smell of grasses. Ialso grew up w/ horses and the manure smell <br/>

&lt;&lt; The ingredients are:<br/>
 chamomila coffee belladonna and sugar. <br/>
 they dissolve on the tongue and taste ...like sugar.<br/>
 I get them at wal-mart or any pharmacy open...you have<br/>
 to ask for them at the counter. It&#39;s about 3-5 dollars<br/>
 for a bottle of 135 pellets.<br/>
 Hope that helps a little.<br/>

   Thank you for all the info. DD also gets more wound when people notice. I <br/>
tried the bars about a yr. and a half ago but she didn&#39;t go for them. Bummer. <br/>
I wish she would drink tea. I&#39;d for sure give her sleepy time at about 7 pm.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815305287">when I first started with the tea ds wasn&#39;t into it,<br/>
either, but I told him it was like medicine. It was<br/>
&quot;feel better&quot; tea. Like vitamins. He didn&#39;t really<br/>
like it, I don&#39;t think, or maybe he was just being<br/>
contrary, who knows, but I just told him it wasn&#39;t an<br/>
option. It was like taking a spoonful of yucky<br/>
medicine, only it was taking 6 sips of tea.... then a<br/>
little bit later 6 more sips...then I really got into<br/>
this honey kick (honey garlic and onions...I&#39;m very<br/>
into them)...and started telling him there was alot of<br/>
honey in the bottom...so he would take bigger &quot;sips&quot;<br/>
to get there. Sometimes, he would take 6 and then I<br/>
woudl take 6 (very little ones for me...leaves more<br/>
for him) and now he just drinks it. Loves it. Dd (3)<br/>
doesn&#39;t like anything near her mouth that is warm (a<br/>
bit of a burn-fear freak that way) and so I started<br/>
her with making up double strength hot tea and putting<br/>
some honey and ice in her sippy cup thing and then<br/>
pouring the tea over them and shaking it up til the<br/>
ice melted and it was a nice room temperature drink<br/>
that was sweet and she gobbled it down like juice. <br/>
Also you could make iced tea or sun tea (some non<br/>
caffenated one) and just add a couple sleepytime bags<br/>
in with the mix, serve it with dinner. Just a few<br/>
suggestions.<br/>
