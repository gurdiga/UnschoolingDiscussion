<div id="ygrps-yiv-518110368">Hi Michelle,<br/>
 I agree that you can make yourself sick  literally with all sorts of <br/>
feelings . I have read alot about that kind of stuff and found it fasinating. <br/>
I try to laugh alot seems to work for me. Everybody is my house is <br/>
sick......except for me.Hahaha. I think they also take way too much <br/>
medication I wont touch an aspirin unless I feel like Im dying. My husband on <br/>
the other hand could get stocks in pharmacy. I think he has a medicine for <br/>
every known ailment.LOL He gets sick all the time , where I on the other hand <br/>
never (knock on wood) get sick. I tease him about it all the time. Glad your <br/>
enjoying your garden I tried to start one last spring. NO Green Thumb here!! <br/>
Oh well the thought was there that was one ailment I did get  POISON IVY! Oh <br/>
my gosh I was miserable for weeks , I  had it bad. <br/>

        &quot;It is the disease itself that heals us...of things we would not <br/>
imagine we are ailed of&quot; !!!!!   That is so true!  I love that line!  As I <br/>
look back on my journey thru infertility, I definitely see the pain: BUT-   I <br/>
also see the gift!  The things I have learned, the people I have met, the <br/>
experiences that I have allowed myself to be open to,  I really don&#39;t think <br/>
would have been part of my life if I hadn&#39;t had the pain of infertility to <br/>
push me. I have learned so much- I am sooo patient now where I used not to <br/>
be, I never take one moment of my daughter&#39;s life for granted,  I  appreciate <br/>
the wonderfulness of my friends who have stood by me in times of grief,  I am <br/>
definitely more sensitive to other people&#39;s pain,  and I am much less <br/>
judgmental than I ever was.  And  these are only a handful of the gifts I <br/>
have received along with the infertility.  Although I would not have chosen <br/>
this for myself,  I would not trade the experiences I have had for anything.  <br/>
I also realize that I would not be who I am today without this trial and I am <br/>
very glad to be who I am!     jackie</div>

&lt;&lt; this thread on MS, chronic Fatigue,Lupus,, and many others has been very <br/>
interesting..lots of positive suggestions...I wonder if people have a <br/>
Naturapath in their area? I know it has been a very hard road to find a <br/>
doctor that is good...both personally related, and medically..Actually we <br/>
have had such bad experiences with doctors it lead us to seek out educational <br/>
oppurtunities in healthcare..such as self care..and in the process we learned <br/>
alot about taking our wellness into our own hands instead of leaving it to <br/>
the not so expert-Experts..who knows you best but yourself. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Michelle,<br/>
     I agree with you 100 % !  All the doctors wanted to do was put me on <br/>
pain medications and Prozac and Elavil (which are antidepressants).  I got <br/>
very frustrated with doctors after being poked and prodded for a couple of <br/>
years.  I tried to find a Natural Health Doctor, but when I called the State <br/>
medical people (because I wasn&#39;t having any luck), they told me that it was <br/>
illegal in Indiana.  I decided then to study up on things myself.  I have <br/>
read books from the library over the last few years and have taught myself <br/>
nutrition and natural medicine.  I have changed my diet and excercise, plus I <br/>
have started using herbs and natural medicines.  I still have alot to learn <br/>
though!  But it fits in great with our unschooling lifestyle  :-).<br/>
     We are putting in a large garden this year.  I started tomatoes and <br/>
green peppers a couple of months ago indoors and will transplant them soon.  <br/>
My 14 yr. old started tomatoes, green peppers, and lettuce.  He wants his own <br/>
garden this year, so between the two of us, we will plant green beans, corn, <br/>
carrots, eggplant, turnips, green onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, green peppers, <br/>
lettuce, and some herbs.  We have also been busy planting apple trees, peach <br/>
trees, grape vines, blueberries, a crabapple tree, a silver birch, and 2 <br/>
different types of oak trees.  We are having a blast!  We have also started a <br/>
flower garden.  I am really getting anxious to get it all started!<br/>
      Well, I have already talked much longer than usual.  Bye!<br/>
