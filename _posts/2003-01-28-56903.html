Yes, I guess the trick is to get a job in a sizeable company.  He had one<br/>
when we were in California, but the contract ended and they laid everyone<br/>
off.  WE have been in ND for ten years, and he has worked for farmers. They<br/>
LOVE having him, but he is tired of the all work and no pay jobs.  He is<br/>
going on a mission&#39;s trip next week, going to put in an autoclave and do<br/>
some wiring at a mission hospital in Haiti, but when he gets back he will be<br/>
job hunting. Hope to find that big company that will give him a chance.<br/>
<br/>
He is really quite talented, can fix anything, and understands mathematics<br/>
intuitively without every going beyond high school.  It amazes me.  He<br/>
actually uses things like the Pythgorean thereom to build things, etc.  I<br/>
just thought it was just some dumb thing I had to memorize (speaking from an<br/>
English major&#39;s point of view!)<br/>
<br/>
I will pass this post on to the hubby!<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

hospital, became a respitory therapist.   He then worked with some docs as a<br/>
respitory therapist and told them of some ideas he had for improving some of<br/>
their devices.   He designed a hand held device that moniters gases an<br/>
individual inhales and exhales,   the old model the docs were using was<br/>
about the size of refridgerator.<br/>

he met people at GE when he was promoting his product.   They were impressed<br/>
with his knowledge,  not his degrees, which he has none.     Hired him to do<br/>
trouble shooting with different projects that the accredited engineers can&#39;t<br/>
figure out.  He&#39;s now 47.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t know if this helps with your husband.    I bet if your husband was<br/>

show them his knowledge and he would be an asset to the company.<br/>
