Mock attack will test terrorism response<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Terrorists will strike a busload of students in the Whitehall area on  <br/>
Tuesday, killing more than a half-dozen and sending dozens more to  <br/>
hospitals.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a crystal ball that allows such a disaster to be foreseen.  <br/>
It&#39;s all in the plans -- disaster preparedness plans, that is.<br/>
<br/>
The disaster won&#39;t be real, but it will look real, and the participants  <br/>
-- including students, emergency room personnel and firefighters --  <br/>
will act as if it&#39;s real.<br/>
<br/>
The exercise, one that is becoming familiar in the post 9/11 era, is  <br/>
part of attempts by emergency responders and Muskegon County school  <br/>
districts to prepare for the worst.<br/>
<br/>
The exercise, which will involve the aftermath of a supposed explosion  <br/>
on a school bus at 9:30 a.m. at Durham and Holton-Whitehall roads in  <br/>
Whitehall Township, is being funded by homeland security grants awarded  <br/>
to several area school districts and Muskegon County.<br/>
<br/>
Local school district transportation directors instigated the exercise  <br/>
because they wanted to test their abilities to respond to emergencies,  <br/>
said Tom Spoelman, transportation consultant for the Muskegon Area  <br/>
Intermediate School District. They eventually hooked up with Muskegon  <br/>
County Emergency Services, and planning for the event has been under  <br/>
way for about a year, Spoelman said.<br/>
<br/>
The exercise will test not only school transportation directors, but  <br/>
also the Muskegon County Emergency Operations Plan, which involves many  <br/>
agencies throughout the county.<br/>
<br/>
About 60 middle and high school students from Reeths-Puffer and  <br/>
Whitehall public schools will be part of the exercise, according to  <br/>
Kristin Tank, public information coordinator for the MAISD. Local law  <br/>
enforcement agencies, fire departments, human service agencies,  <br/>
transportation services and medical services will participate.<br/>
<br/>
Students from Muskegon Community College and Reeths-Puffer will assist  <br/>
in applying makeup to add to the reality of the gruesome scene. Between  <br/>
200 and 300 people will observe the exercise, including school bus  <br/>
drivers, school administrators, emergency personnel and evaluators from  <br/>
agencies across the state who will provide feedback.<br/>
<br/>
The exercise will simulate an attack by a fictitious radical group  <br/>
called Wackos Against Schools and Education who believe everyone should  <br/>
be homeschooled. Under the scenario, a bomb is placed on the bus and is  <br/>
detonated while the bus is traveling on Durham, causing the bus to land  <br/>
on its side and fill with smoke.<br/>
<br/>
The exercise will begin with the bus -- an out-of-service vehicle  <br/>
donated by Ravenna Public Schools -- on its side, having been placed  <br/>
there by Dale&#39;s 24 Hour Towing Service, which is donating its time and  <br/>
resources. Fire departments will respond and test their abilities to  <br/>
get at victims inside a mangled bus.<br/>
<br/>
Hackley and Mercy General both will be able to test their new emergency  <br/>
rooms, each of which will get between 15 and 20 &quot;victims.&quot; Eight or  <br/>
nine deceased students, represented by mannequins, will be transported  <br/>
to the county morgue, Tank said.<br/>
<br/>
Frantic parents will be part of the staged disaster, flocking to  <br/>
schools and hospital emergency rooms.<br/>
<br/>
The exercise is similar to an event staged a year ago at Heritage  <br/>
Landing that involved a mock chemical disaster, which also was the  <br/>
supposed work of terrorists and tested the county&#39;s emergency  <br/>
preparedness.<br/>
<br/>
White Lake Fire Authority Chief Bob Phillips said his department is  <br/>
lucky to be heavily involved in Tuesday&#39;s exercise by virtue of the  <br/>
location planners chose.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The potential exists (for a devastating incident) every day the school  <br/>
buses are on the road,&quot; Phillips said. &quot;It&#39;s not something that happens  <br/>
a lot, but it&#39;s something we need to be trained in.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s what we&#39;re hoping for is to learn what works and what doesn&#39;t  <br/>
work before an incident actually happens.&quot;</div>

~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Why is it pertinent to the emergency personnel to know the group&#39;s  agenda?  <br/>
 <br/>
And, if the group is &quot;against education&quot;, they wouldn&#39;t exactly be  <br/>
homeschoolers, would they?<br/>
 <br/>
I think if the agenda is pertinent to the exercise (maybe other buses will  <br/>
be targeted, maybe the school, maybe it&#39;s several incidents happening at once,  <br/>
maybe the group has an M.O.), then they should probably use *real* agendas, <br/>
to  make it as *real* as possible.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s outside the realm of  <br/>
possibility that terrorists would do things like that (Timothy McVeigh bomed a  <br/>
day care).  Why not just say so?  Why make a connection between  <br/>
*homeschooling*, of all things, and terrorism?<br/>
 <br/>
All rhetorical, of course.  Perhaps I should write a letter.<br/>

&gt; The Muskegon Area Intermediate School District (MAISD)  shared<br/>
&gt; the disappointment of others when we learned the  September<br/>
&gt; 21, 2004, emergency preparedness drill referenced  home<br/>
&gt; schoolers as the fictitious group responsible for a  mock<br/>
&gt; disaster.  We apologize.  The MAISD and local  districts were<br/>
&gt; not aware of the scenario, and it was not shared  with<br/>
&gt; students or parents who took part in the  exercise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; According to Dan Stout, Chief Deputy,  Emergency Services of<br/>
&gt; Muskegon County, this scenario was  constructed in his office.<br/>
&gt;  A sample scenario was required  in order to receive the<br/>
&gt; necessary funding to stage the  event.  The Muskegon Area<br/>
&gt; Intermediate School District and  our local schools did not<br/>
&gt; construct the scenario, but  participated with other county<br/>
&gt; agencies, hospitals, and  emergency responders in conducting<br/>
&gt; the drill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This exercise was meant to sharpen the skills  and response<br/>
&gt; time of our emergency services personnel, but  was<br/>
&gt; unfortunately clouded by the choice of this fictional  group.<br/>
&gt; We believe this exercise had everything to do with  testing<br/>
&gt; emergency response time and the protection of our  children.<br/>
&gt; It had nothing to do with the home school  population.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As educators, we believe that the  first and most important<br/>
&gt; teacher is the parent, whether in home  schools, public<br/>
&gt; schools, or non-public schools.  We all  work together to<br/>
&gt; ensure a safe and secure environment for our  children to live<br/>
&gt; and grow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We sincerely regret offending home school educators.   We<br/>
&gt; believe that all parents are educators and do important  work<br/>
&gt; at home with their children.<br/>

Thanks  Pam.  Are we sure this is for real (both the original information  and<br/>
these apologies)?  When I mentioned it to my husband he suspected  a hoax.<br/>
It sure seems like it could be, but then, the truth is stranger  than<br/>

I did visit the link to the story in the paper.  It could still be a  hoax, <br/>
but I doubt it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Statement from the MAISD  Superintendent<br/>
&gt; &gt; Michael H. Bozym, Ph.D.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; September 21, 2004<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The Muskegon Area Intermediate School District<br/>
&gt; (MAISD)  shared<br/>
&gt; &gt; the disappointment of others when we learned the <br/>
&gt; September<br/>
&gt; &gt; 21, 2004, emergency preparedness drill referenced <br/>
&gt; home<br/>
&gt; &gt; schoolers as the fictitious group responsible for<br/>
&gt; a  mock<br/>
&gt; &gt; disaster.  We apologize.  The MAISD and local <br/>
&gt; districts were<br/>
&gt; &gt; not aware of the scenario, and it was not shared <br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; students or parents who took part in the <br/>
&gt; exercise.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; According to Dan Stout, Chief Deputy,  Emergency<br/>
&gt; Services of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Muskegon County, this scenario was  constructed in<br/>
&gt; his office.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  A sample scenario was required  in order to<br/>
&gt; receive the<br/>
&gt; &gt; necessary funding to stage the  event.  The<br/>
&gt; Muskegon Area<br/>
&gt; &gt; Intermediate School District and  our local<br/>
&gt; schools did not<br/>
&gt; &gt; construct the scenario, but  participated with<br/>
&gt; other county<br/>
&gt; &gt; agencies, hospitals, and  emergency responders in<br/>
&gt; conducting<br/>
&gt; &gt; the drill.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This exercise was meant to sharpen the skills  and<br/>
&gt; response<br/>
&gt; &gt; time of our emergency services personnel, but  was<br/>
&gt; &gt; unfortunately clouded by the choice of this<br/>
&gt; fictional  group.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We believe this exercise had everything to do with<br/>
&gt;  testing<br/>
&gt; &gt; emergency response time and the protection of our <br/>
&gt; children.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It had nothing to do with the home school <br/>
&gt; population.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As educators, we believe that the  first and most<br/>
&gt; important<br/>
&gt; &gt; teacher is the parent, whether in home  schools,<br/>
&gt; public<br/>
&gt; &gt; schools, or non-public schools.  We all  work<br/>
&gt; together to<br/>
&gt; &gt; ensure a safe and secure environment for our <br/>
&gt; children to live<br/>
&gt; &gt; and grow.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We sincerely regret offending home school<br/>
&gt; educators.   We<br/>
&gt; &gt; believe that all parents are educators and do<br/>
&gt; important  work<br/>
&gt; &gt; at home with their children.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; In the world today Homeland security is very a <br/>
&gt; important<br/>
&gt; &gt; issue.  The training of our nation to respond to <br/>
&gt; the many<br/>
&gt; &gt; threats we face is of utmost importance.  As part <br/>
&gt; of a full<br/>
&gt; &gt; scale homeland security exercise on September 21,<br/>
&gt; 2004  in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Muskegon, I wrote about a fictional group and <br/>
&gt; fictional<br/>
&gt; &gt; scenario for the exercise.  This fictional group <br/>
&gt; and scenario<br/>
&gt; &gt; made reference to fictional people who are against<br/>
&gt;  schools.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This fictional group and scenario was not meant to<br/>
&gt;  offend any<br/>
&gt; &gt; home school students.  It has nothing to do with <br/>
&gt; any home<br/>
&gt; &gt; school population. Home school students and former<br/>
&gt;  students<br/>
&gt; &gt; are a very important part of our nation.  This <br/>
&gt; scenario will<br/>
&gt; &gt; not be used again.<br/>
