<div id="ygrps-yiv-961428009">-=- I also think we <br/>
should have at least one room in the house where they can touch <br/>
anything they want and not be told &#39;no, that&#39;s an ouch&#39; or something <br/>
like that.  We really don&#39;t have that.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
CHILDPROOFING!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have a childproof house, you&#39;ve made your life way more <br/>
difficult than it needs to be.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;but my husband wants to move so badly he won&#39;t agree to totally <br/>
rearrange the house with me ;)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do it without him.  At least get a couple of rooms safe.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I had a wonderful lady while I was pregnant with Crispin but she <br/>
couldn&#39;t work for $5 an hour for ever.  She was such a good cook too!  <br/>
There aren&#39;t a lot of people who can work for what I can pay.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Young teenagers might might work for $3 or $4.  Forget expecting them to <br/>
cook, but to carry toddlers and play with kids, maybe yes!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I could have someone sitting on my shoulder all day to just whisper &quot; <br/>
you&#39;re doing <br/>
fine&quot; I think I could do it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Find little ways to do fine and you&#39;ll feel better.  Calming is crucial.<br/>
Do you have comforting movies/videos/music?<br/>
If so, put some on NOW, not tomorrow, but go get it.  Music can calm your <br/>
children and it can calm you.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; There are days Crispin just cries all day long and I <br/>
have no idea why, look at his mouth, his butt, feel his tummy, take him <br/>
to the Chiropractor, let him lay in the middle of the floor and scream <br/>
and feel like a failure.  &gt;&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555607756">Use the library resources. It&#39;s Free! Our library is online so I can<br/>
reserve and just go in to pick up. Five minutes tops. If not online, could<br/>
you call and get them to pull a couple tapes or CDs?<br/>

the thoughts that are consistent with the kind of person he or she<br/>
would like to be.&quot;<br/>
