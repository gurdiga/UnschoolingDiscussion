<div id="ygrps-yiv-367456723">Its my understanding that phone etiquette is different in USA and Canada (or maybe it&#39;s an East/West thing?) but my mother-in-law NEVER says &quot;bye&quot; when she hands up the phone.  My sister-in-law dismisses it as an American thing and laffs.  I don&#39;t laff.  I find it REALY obnoxious - because the line goes dead - courtesy to me is to let the other person know you are done speaking - they do this in Toastmasters even, so there is a &quot;standard&quot; of sorts.<br/>

  &lt;&lt;I&#39;ve never done<br/>
  introductions because it seemed SO difficult, but I can understand the<br/>
  rankings now.<br/>
<br/>
  I also never understood that you really were required to say &quot;hi&quot; and<br/>
  &quot;bye&quot; to people and to acknowledge them as you pass, and it&#39;s still<br/>
  difficult for me to remember to do so. As I passed some &quot;hallway<br/>
  acquaintances&quot; who were conversing I couldn&#39;t decide whether it was<br/>
  worse to interrupt their conversation with a greeting or snub them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Well you just taught me something too. I never really thought that there<br/>
  were people who would have problems with such things. That must be hard to<br/>
  deal with when most people, like me, seem to think it&#39;s something everyone<br/>
  just knows.<br/>

I&#39;ve worked a LOT on the phone and in customer service areas and I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed that same thing.  When I speak to someone who is from the East<br/>
coast, they tend not to say &quot;goodbye&quot; when they are done speaking and<br/>
very seldom say &quot;hi&quot; when they start speaking.  They just get straight<br/>
to the point and then hang up.  At first, it was unsettling but, after<br/>
it happened several times, I just dismissed it as &quot;that must be the<br/>
way it is there.&quot; <br/>

Hey!!! I&#39;m on the east coast! LOL!!! I&#39;ve done phone work calling all along<br/>
the east coast and west coast too. Never noticed that. Maybe it has<br/>
something to do with the people being called, the certain area? Never ran<br/>
into someone that didn&#39;t say hello or goodbye. That would seem rude to me.<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t have to be goodbye specifically but something to let me know they<br/>
were going!!!<br/>

My thoughts exactly!  It&#39;s nice to know that it&#39;s not just the way<br/>
things are done on the East Coast.  You&#39;re probably right that&#39;s it&#39;s<br/>
the sort of people being called.  In my business we tend to be rushed<br/>
all the time so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s simply because they are always in a<br/>
hurry to move on to the next project.  :)<br/>
