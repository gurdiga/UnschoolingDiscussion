Just wanted to let you know that the link was incorrect - I dug around
and this looks like the right one... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" HREF="http://mcmurrayhatchery.com/">http://mcmurrayhatchery.com/</a>
<p>I&#39;ve been a lurker for awhile...&nbsp; Really starting to lean towards
unschooling my 2 year old and his sibling who&#39;s expected around Thanksgiving!&nbsp;
I&#39;m enjoying all of the discussions on what to do with the kids and how
to go about it and it just seems like a perfect fit for us to keep doing
what we&#39;ve been doing with Cort - learn from the world!
<p>Thanks for all the information!
