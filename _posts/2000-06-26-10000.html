it sounds like you have a LOT to share w/ 13 yrs of h-s&#39;ing behind you!!!<br/>
yes, I read Dr. Moore&#39;s &quot;Better Late Than Early&quot;  ... it&#39;s too bad I didn&#39;t<br/>
know about Dr. M when my big kidlets (24/21) were little b/c I would&#39;ve done<br/>
things SO MUCH DIFFERENTLY!!!  ahhhhhhh wellllllllll, live ~n~ learn &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
last year a h-s mom suggested I order Rod and Staff&#39;s sample curriculum and<br/>
I about DIED when I saw it ... I&#39;m sure it&#39;s good for some people but it<br/>
wasn&#39;t for us, either :{<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hello to all. I have been reading the list for many months because I<br/>
&gt; wanted to see what it is all about before jumping in. I have learned<br/>
&gt; so much from all of you as I am always still learning and tempering<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; way of living/teaching our children. My name is Elisabeth and I live<br/>
&gt; in California. We have been living the hs lifestyle for about 13<br/>
&gt; years<br/>
&gt; now. We have 5 wonderful ( aren&#39;t they all?!) children who have never<br/>
&gt; been to school due to the new things we were introduced to when we<br/>
&gt; attended a hs conference when our oldest was only 6 months old, then<br/>
&gt; read the Moore&#39;s books over and over again and hung out with<br/>
&gt; &quot;experienced &quot; homeschool families at Park days during the toddler/<br/>
&gt; early elementary years.<br/>
&gt; Just recently I listened to some tapes that a friend loaned me from a<br/>
&gt; conference that the Moore&#39;s gave in the early 90&#39;s. I found this to<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; so helpful. Have any of you read their books? Have many of you<br/>
&gt; followed their outline of the Moore Formula? What are your<br/>
&gt; experiences?<br/>
&gt; You&#39;d think that by now I&#39;d have it all figured out but not so as it<br/>
&gt; is taking me a long time to unlearn the things that I learned about<br/>
&gt; hs<br/>
&gt; early on from the Protestant-type hs. Yes, My son and I suffered<br/>
&gt; through using Rod and Staff one year- it was awful!!!!! Then we tried<br/>
&gt; Sonlight, this was much nicer but too scheduled to really work in our<br/>
&gt; life (the books were great!) Well, it has been about four years now<br/>
&gt; and we are finally starting to come to a place where we are all<br/>
&gt; comfortable and doing what we need to be doing. One of the most<br/>
&gt; important things I have seen and learned is this:Negative Peer<br/>
&gt; pressure whether it is youthful or in adult frienships is not healthy<br/>
&gt; for the development of healthy families/people/little people.<br/>
&gt; I look forward to taking part in the list.<br/>
&gt; Blessings,Elisabeth </span></blockquote></div>
