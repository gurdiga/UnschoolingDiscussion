  Oh,  Geez,<br/>

  I went shopping this weekend, needed some clothes.   I thought I was pretty cool, so I tried on some of those jeans,  low riders.  UGH!!     <br/>
<br/>
  I think they came lower than my c-section scar and if I would have bent over, my butt would have fallen out!!<br/>

  I ended up getting some capris that were kind of hip huggers,  but not low riders.  <br/>

Back in PA when I was younger we called flip flops thongs. That was actually<br/>
before the thongs we know now, butt floss undies. I have also heard flips<br/>
flops called zorries. If you say you wear thongs though, don&#39;t expect people<br/>
to think of your feet!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Thongs are also sandals.  The dictionary even says so!  lol  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A thong is a cord or string, chiefly of leather.  So thongs are the shoes <br/>
that have one strip of leather or rubber or now nylon between the toes.  That&#39;s <br/>
the thong.  <br/>
<br/>
And on thong underwear, the thong is doing very little good but holding the <br/>
front in place.<br/>
<br/>
Thongs and flip-flips are about the same, but I think the old-time 1960&#39;s <br/>
rubber ones (still for sale, I saw some this week) were called thongs, and the <br/>
newer version with thick rubber souls and nylon tops (better made) are <br/>
flip-flips more specifically.  ( It could be regional, too.)<br/>
<br/>
And the other (I forget the word) Japanese term is used when they&#39;re made of <br/>
natural materials (at least in part) with the reed bottoms.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 How Rowlocks Can Work<br/>
<br/>
The thong went around the oar and fastened to the rowlocks of the day, two <br/>
parallel posts (tholes) set in the gunwale of the boat. The thong prevented the <br/>
oar from jumping out of the rowlock or sliding into the drink; similar <br/>
arrangements can be seen on modern boats built in traditional styles. <br/>

thong - O.E. ﬁwong &quot;thong,&quot; from P.Gmc. *thwangaz, from a root meaning &quot;to <br/>
restrain.&quot; As a kind of sandal, first attested 1967; as a kind of bikini briefs, <br/>
1990s. <br/>

    The Etymology of Greatness <br/>
<br/>
10 July 2000 <br/>
Jamie wants to say something about words. Using words. And Word™. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  But some words are far, far greater than others. Let&#39;s go deeper. <br/>
Take &#39;thong&#39;, for example. It&#39;s not just great because of its associations <br/>
with scantily clad lovelies in &#39;rap&#39; videos, it&#39;s a genuinely good word. Say it <br/>
a few times. Let the thong roll over your tongue. Tasty. My mate Steve&#39;s a big <br/>
advocate of &#39;bungalow&#39;, which can be enjoyed by everyone, but is particularly <br/>
fragrant doused in Scouse (any northern speak will do, but try scouse if you <br/>
get the chance). And why is Eddie Izzard so fond of saying &#39;jam&#39;? It&#39;s not <br/>
just because of his affection for preserved fruit or Chris Morris&#39; twisted <br/>
brainchild; no one can hear the word without its phonetic beauty possessing their <br/>
being and sending warm, strawberry emotions coursing through their veins. Which <br/>
makes them laugh. <br/>

with different colored layers of foam between a sandwich of black foam, with <br/>
fuzzy/silky straps that matched the bottom part of the sandal.  They were ultra <br/>
cool, surfer style flip-flops.  If you were really rich, you got the ones made <br/>
by Bolt lightening, a popular brand of surfboard at the time.  <br/>

<br/>
 There is a difference between g-string and thong underwear, tho.  A g-string <br/>
is a triangle in front and the rest is string.  Thongs have the triangle in <br/>
front, but a wider band along the hips, and the band is wider along the back <br/>
and butt that gets narrower as you go down.  <br/>
