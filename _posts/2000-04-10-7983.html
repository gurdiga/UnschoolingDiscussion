&lt;&lt;  Have you tried chiropractic care at all?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi Sonia,<br/>
Thanks for the suggestion.  We haven&#39;t tried chiropractic care yet.  We do <br/>
have an acquaintance who&#39;s a chiropractor, and right after Tess was born we <br/>
asked him if he thought he could help her.  He told us that there was not <br/>
much he could do for her if the brachial nerves were torn, which they are - <br/>
or were - they&#39;ve since been repaired surgically.  He&#39;s also told us what you <br/>
said about many babies being born out of alignment, probably due to the <br/>
strange delivery techniques doctors are known to use.  I don&#39;t know much <br/>
about the benefits of chiropractic - I may just have to look into it a little <br/>
bit more.  I&#39;d be interested in hearing more about your experience with it.  <br/>
Take care.<br/>
