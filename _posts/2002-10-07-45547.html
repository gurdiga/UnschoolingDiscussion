&lt;&lt; Forgot to mention...Kyle would have been either a Jared or a Justin if <br/>
 I had my way, but dh did not like the idea of having a family of all <br/>
 J names (dh is Jeff, oldest is Jason). Ah well... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s funny. I didn&#39;t like the name Jared at all when dh mentioned it.  <br/>
Trevor (oldest boy) loved it and they both started referring to my bulging <br/>
belly as &quot;Baby Jared&quot; by four months into the pregnancy.<br/>
I kept saying that NO we were not going to name this baby Jared, it was going <br/>
to be Connor or Donovan or something a bit Irish.<br/>
But after months of them talking to the little guy and calling him Jared, it <br/>
grew on me.<br/>
The moment they laid that wet newborn on my chest I said &quot;baby Jared&quot; and <br/>
sighed. Dh looked at me and said &quot;we have to name him Jared now&quot;....the deal <br/>
was sealed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-683645249">LOL I was exactly the same way with my third! DH called her Cassidy (which I did NOT like) from the moment we found out she was a girl, and the boys added Belle.... they were constantly saying &quot;Cassie Belle&quot; to my belly, and it grew on me. After that, none of the other names I&#39;d picked out seemed &quot;right&quot; so we have our little Cassidy Belle now, and I can&#39;t imagine her named anything else.<br/>
