&gt; &gt;with this. A child&#39;s life is how they live it. They live in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;immediate present and having to go to school due to the death of a<br/>
&gt; &gt;parent would be a very significant event. It could definitely add to the<br/>
&gt; &gt;grief.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When my friend Bonnie died, her four kids had never been to school.  Her<br/>
&gt; husband&#39;s major priority was keeping them out of school.  He took a year or<br/>
&gt; so and lived on next to nothing while he concentrated on the kids.  Here in<br/>
&gt; Canada, widows and widowers with kids get a pension until the kids are<br/>
&gt; grown.  Low income parents also get what they call a child tax benefit.<br/>
&gt; Between the two, they were able to survive.  Now he works for my husband,<br/>
&gt; and the 17 year old looks after the boys while he works.  One of the <br/>
&gt; biggest<br/>
&gt; things Dennis had to deal with was the kids&#39; fear that he could die as <br/>
&gt; well.<br/>

parents: Me (biological mother), my partner Beth, and his father, Perry. We <br/>
have an excellent relationship with Perry, but the truth is, that if <br/>
something happened to me, whatever Julian needed or Beth wanted, Perry could <br/>
call all the shots. I THINK he would want to do what&#39;s best for Julian, <br/>
including NOT sending him to school, but I am not certain. It&#39;s scary. And <br/>
Julian HAS thought about it, and has talked about it.<br/>
