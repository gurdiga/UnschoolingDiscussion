<div id="ygrps-yiv-799723972">Stephanie, without meaning to totally offend (sorry!), is your husband<br/>
totally nuts?  He&#39;s willing to sacrifice you baby&#39;s/child&#39;s/future<br/>
adult&#39;s health?  I firmly believe that if someone is educated in the<br/>
true merits of breastfeeding there would be no &quot;choice&quot; in infant<br/>
nutrition.  It is absolutely the most superior wonder food in existence<br/>
on the planet and no informed person could possibly deny that for their<br/>
child.  It&#39;s like choosing to eat scraps from the dumpster instead of<br/>
opting for tasty, delicious and healthy food in your own well-stocked<br/>
kitchen.  No one who has the choice chooses dumpster food!  Not only<br/>
will nursing supply your baby with an immune system and sustain your<br/>
child even through illness (it&#39;s the perfect medicinal food when your<br/>
baby has a cold or diarrhea or is vomiting) but the health benefits last<br/>
well into adulthood.  Lower rates of allergies, sensitivities, diabetes,<br/>
even cancers.  This is all well documented.  Babies fed ARTIFICIAL food<br/>
such as formula, or worse, COW&#39;S MILK have higher statistics on<br/>
everything negative except maybe brain development.  Which has been<br/>
well-documented for breast-fed babies:  higher intelligence for the<br/>
amino acids present in breast milk.  No formula can replicate that!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to be on this tirade but I positively see red when I see<br/>
people think there is a &quot;choice&quot; and usually for the sake of unimportant<br/>
and temporary situations such as convenience or lifestyle.  How can any<br/>
loving parent deny their child what is clearly theirs?  Boy, have the<br/>
formula companies or, dare I say it, the radical feminists, really<br/>
snowed us that much, all these years?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;m making a few enemies tonight with these views but 10 solid<br/>
years of research into the subject have brought me to these conclusions.<br/>
Yes, most babies will grow according to the growth charts<br/>
(interestingly-enough supplied by the formula companies) when fed by<br/>
artificial means, but most of the time we are forfeiting quality for<br/>
quantity (the pounds babies gain).  People can seem to grow and gain<br/>
weight eating dumpster food too...Formula is made of &quot;Scraps&quot; and<br/>
by-products:  leftover and sour milk processed into powders, the lowest<br/>
grades of corn syrup, coconut and palm oils (recognized poison for the<br/>
heart) and a few fake versions of vitamins.  Mechanically-produced and<br/>
rarely efficiently absorbed by the system. <br/>
<br/>
As I say, there is no true choice.  <br/>

hi kim,
<p>because there was no name at the bottom the only reference i could find
was sulan...&nbsp; at the top of the quoted stuff on lynda&#39;s post and i
assumed that was the person her comments were addressed to.&nbsp; after
i sent my post i went to find out who had sent the post lynda was commenting
on and that&#39;s when i found out it was you not sulan (sonia). anyway i then
sent a revised copy of my message with the names straightened out ( kim
and sonia) and it reads better, well&nbsp; more understandable anyway &lt;g&gt;,
- the right quotes with the right name.&nbsp; sorry about that i should
have not made that assumption i guess i could have referred to you a &#39;geez&#39;

<p><br>your right you most definitely do not need to defend your choices,
(i think there is <u>way</u> too much invasion of privacy) and i for one
wouldn&#39;t want you to reveal something you wanted kept private.&nbsp; but
then why comment and get mad at someone for not understanding if you&#39;re
not willing to help shed some light.&nbsp; my personal experiences taught
me that sometimes it&#39;s hard for others to fathom something they&#39;ve never
experienced.&nbsp; for example (though i have many:)&nbsp; my dh is deaf.&nbsp;&nbsp;
i had never met a deaf person before i met him (6 years ago this wk:) and
it still, to this day, amazes me how different our worlds are and how we
really can&#39;t comprehend each other&#39;s world but we accept them.&nbsp; it&#39;s
the little things like the way he lowers the metal blinds - it sends my
son and i running from the room because it&#39;s so loud:)&nbsp; we ask him
repeatedly to try and do it quieter but it just doesn&#39;t stick because it&#39;s
not his experience.&nbsp; or when he drops something he has no clue which
direction it went in but i do because of the sound or&nbsp; not knowing
what is happening even a foot away if your back is turned.&nbsp; what i&#39;ve
learned is that being deaf is so beyond anything i could have imaged because
of all the little things i take for granted but i do try to understand
things like what it was like not sharing a common language with your friends
(he was mainstreamed and the only deaf person) but it still remains a mental
thing for me . anyway that&#39;s why i suggested that you give reasons why
some people choose not to breastfeed.
<blockquote TYPE="CITE">Notice that I never, EVER entered into a debate about
whether breastmilk is
<br>best for babies.&nbsp; In fact, I stated that of course it IS best
for babies.
<br>But some felt it necessary to argue the virtues of breastmilk and,
taking it
<br>a step further, compare formula to trash from a dumpster.&nbsp; Why,
in order to
<br>show how good one thing is, is it necessary to state how bad another
thing
<br>is???&nbsp; It&#39;s true - the dumpster comments were NOT directed solely
at me.&nbsp; But
<br>they definitely called into question the judgment of people who give
their
<br>children formula.&nbsp; The fact is, it was physically impossible for
me to nurse
<br>this baby.&nbsp; If I followed the &quot;dumpster&quot; line of thinking and
refused to use
<br>formula, then my baby would have starved.&nbsp; Am I making a ridiculous
argument
<br>here?&nbsp; Yes, of course!&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t let my baby starve!&nbsp;
But it seems to me to
<br>be ridiculously obvious that if you can&#39;t nurse, then you use formula,
and
<br>there&#39;s absolutely no sense in dwelling on its &quot;dumpster&quot;-like qualities.&nbsp;
It
<br>doesn&#39;t do anyone any good to hear about them, and it could easily
be seen
<br>(NOT just by me, but by numerous folks on the list who have emailed
me) as
<br>inflammatory, smug, and self-satisfied.</blockquote>

<p><br>you&#39;re right this is an extreme take on formula and imo she was
out of line but this comment would make a lot more sense given to the corporate
heads, formula marketers and peds. drs.
<blockquote TYPE="CITE">I am not responding to your post in order to further
this - I just wanted to make sure that argumentative statements attributed
to sulan were correctly attributed to me.&nbsp; Fair is fair, and I&#39;ll
take the rap for my own words! Thanks for your thoughts on all this.&nbsp;
I love your posts, and look forward to more.</blockquote>

<blockquote TYPE="CITE">*** KiM ***

<p><br>even if you were responding to further this i don&#39;t see that as
a problem besides you have that right.&nbsp; we all want to be heard as
well as understood and we all should be heard and understood!&nbsp; the
point of my response was simple to try and find a way that your opinion
could be expressed without having &#39;to do onto others what you felt had
been onto you&#39;.&nbsp; truthfully this thread&nbsp; has not been one i&#39;ve
been following very closely.&nbsp;&nbsp; though it&#39;s an interesting topic
it&#39;s just not one in the forefront of my life.&nbsp; i hope you understand
my other post&nbsp;&nbsp; i realize sonia&#39;s post was argumentative and
i think she says that herself and called herself radical and imo she is
- but i&#39;ve read more radical views that hers &lt;g&gt;. ( read the 2nd one&nbsp;
now that i&#39;ve got the right name:)
<p>i understand why this upset you so much and imo it was insensitive.&nbsp;
i know if i were not able to do something and another person said &#39;anyone
who doesn&#39;t do such and such is an idiot&#39;, it would bother me.&nbsp; like
having only one child i know there are lots of families, particularly hs
family, which are big and some of them look down on moms with just one
kid like we are not really mom&#39;s and our experience is not as valid as
theirs because their doing it with x number of kids. it is kind of hurtful
because some of us haven&#39;t for one reason or another had more kids.&nbsp;
it&#39;s very invalidating but the bottom line is it&#39;s their problem and you
don&#39;t owe anyone an explanation.&nbsp; so you keep run with them thar scissors

&gt; &gt; OK - this is what I was talking about.  Tracy (a LLL leader, and a firm<br/>
&gt; &gt; believer in the benefits of breastfeeding) emailed me off list and asked<br/>
&gt; &gt; about my reasons for feeding my children the way I do.  She presented her<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; question in a respectful, adult fashion.  Because of her attitude I was<br/>
&gt; happy<br/>
&gt; &gt; to respond to her.  This, on the other hand, is nothing but inflammatory.<br/>
&gt;   I<br/>
&gt; &gt; could respond to this post by explaining some of the valid reasons for<br/>
&gt; &gt; bottlefeeding, but I won&#39;t because you don&#39;t deserve my consideration.<br/>
&gt; You<br/>
&gt; &gt; established that with the tone of your post.  Clearly you decided not to<br/>
&gt; &gt; honor the request that I made about keeping this kind of attitude off of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; list, or even posting about breastfeeding under the subject line<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;breastfeeding&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There ARE valid reasons for bottlefeeding.  Perhaps one might have to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; willing to expand one&#39;s viewpoint in order to understand them.  We should<br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; &gt; be familiar with that concept since we are unschoolers.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Get over yourself and your own opinions.    BTW, I was a licensed<br/>
&gt; &gt; breastfeeding consultant  and support leader for several years and<br/>
&gt; therefore<br/>
&gt; &gt; am quite familiar with all the merits of breastfeeding, so you don&#39;t need<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; go there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Feel free to flame away - it will only further establish the fact that<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a tremendous attitude problem and are judgmental and meddling.   How<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; other people feed their children is NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.  You can not<br/>
&gt; pass<br/>
&gt; &gt; any kind of legitimate judgment on them.   I&#39;ll say it once again - get<br/>
