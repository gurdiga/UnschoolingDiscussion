<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not actually the medical schools you need to worry about - it&#39;s the <br/>
university where you son would be getting his Bachelor&#39;s degree.  Many <br/>
universities take homeschooled students.  It&#39;s easy to research the <br/>
universities your son is interested in to see what their admission <br/>
requirements are.  Just call the admissions office, tell them you are <br/>
homeschooling your son who is interested in attending there, and ask them.  <br/>
<br/>
But. . . Pre-med programs are very competitive and you son will need a solid <br/>
grounding in the sciences. . . and good SAT scores wouldn&#39;t hurt. That <br/>
grounding in the sciences doesn&#39;t have to come at the cost of unschooling, <br/>
though.  :-)  If your son is motivated to learn, say, biology there are ways <br/>
for him to learn without resorting to schools or school-at-home.  <br/>
<br/>
Karl Bunday&#39;s website at:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html">http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html</a>  is <br/>
a good resource.  It lists 650 colleges that have accepted homeschoolers.  <br/>
Cafi Cohen&#39;s book &quot;And What About College? : How Homeschooling Can Lead to <br/>
Admissions to the Best Colleges & Universities&quot; might be helpful to you.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, you might be interested in David and Micki Colfax&#39;s books <br/>
&quot;Homeschooling for Excellence&quot; and &quot;Hard Times in Paradise&quot;.  The Colfaxes <br/>
homeschooled their kids in a very relaxed manner.  One of their sons <br/>
graduated from Harvard,  and then from Harvard Medical School.  Two of their <br/>
sons are now attorneys, and at least one of them attended Yale.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I used to tell people to read the Colfax books because I thought their<br/>
children were particularly shining examples of success.  I still think the<br/>
Colfaxes succeeded, but my definition of success has changed somewhat.  <br/>
<br/>
People who see success as achieving social status and a lot of money will<br/>
no doubt be impressed by what the Colfaxes have achieved.  However, there<br/>
are more than a few people out there who are applying very different<br/>
criteria of success to their lives and by those criteria succeeding<br/>
brilliantly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly so, John. Our two oldest sons - totally unschooled - are not<br/>
doctors or lawyers, but electricians and carpenters. The electrician (Jim)<br/>
called me this morning to chitchat and mentioned that he was especially<br/>
proud of a job he did this last week, a three-day job of rewiring something<br/>
critical in a huge sawmill, which tested out 100% when the test runs were<br/>
made. He said the inspector was so shocked that he asked for a rerun of the<br/>
test, and again it was 100%. Jim said apparently these things often hit<br/>
90-95% on the tests, but a 100% run was apparently astonishing. Jim said<br/>
the inspector asked him where he&#39;d learned that kind of accuracy and when<br/>
Jim said he was homeschooled everyone just stood around rather speechless.<br/>
<br/>
The carpenter, John (who lives in Alaska), was called in on a special metal<br/>
fabricating project (structural beams for a commercial building) a couple<br/>
of weeks ago because he was one of the only people capable of making<br/>
corrections to the blueprints involved... his capability was due to working<br/>
with those kinds of blueprints last year and developing an understanding of<br/>
how they worked... or something. He said his boss wanted him on the project<br/>
because the inspector had specifically mentioned John as someone who knew<br/>
what he was doing, and did it the right way.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, these boys were completely unschooled, left to learn whatever<br/>
they wanted, on their own, and spent most of their childhood riding their<br/>
horses to fishing holes and generally goofing off. They&#39;ve both talked at<br/>
length about the attitudes they see in their fellow workers, how most of<br/>
them seem unhappy, unmotivated, uninterested. John and Jim are doing these<br/>
jobs because they&#39;re fascinated by the processes involved; both are<br/>
constantly learning new skills and applying them in their work, and they&#39;re<br/>
enjoying what they do (and the money&#39;s not bad). Sure seems like a good<br/>
description of success to me.<br/>

Thanks to you and your kids.....<br/>
We have years to just be, but it is always nice to hear of such contented<br/>
success.<br/>
What did you boys do when they were approaching college.  Did they pursue it on<br/>
their own?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard of a university that refused to take any homeschooled <br/>
students.  Has anyone else here?   Homeschooling seems not to be an issue.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But. . . Pre-med programs are very competitive and you son will need a <br/>

<br/>
Isn&#39;t there some other test to take before med school?  If not, then Graduate <br/>
Record Exam?  I know for law school there&#39;s the LSAT, and for other grad <br/>
school, GRE.  SAT scores are for getting into undergrad, as far as I know.<br/>
<br/>
There USED to be (maybe not anymore) some medical schools that would take <br/>
people without an undergrad degree, and there might be some yet that would <br/>
consider a special-case exception.<br/>

I wish you were closer!  I&#39;d love to spend an afternoon listening to how your<br/>
days were and are.<br/>
How did you combat doubts?  Did you have doubts?<br/>
I have millions of questions.... your the only true unschoolers I&#39;ve ever heard<br/>
of.<br/>
I&#39;ll pace some of the questions though.<br/>
Did you worry about reading, or try to teach it?  Or writing ect??<br/>
