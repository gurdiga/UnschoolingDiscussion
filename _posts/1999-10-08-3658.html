&lt;&lt; Now with attachment parenting did you go out every once in a while, just <br/>
you and your husband, or was the baby always with you?  Also, when baby fell <br/>
asleep did<br/>
you put her in a crib or ... what did you do?  I&#39;m just curious.  I know some <br/>
of you have talked about keeping the baby in a sling on you, but I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine<br/>
for the sake of my back.  I don&#39;t have the greatest back as it is, and I <br/>
would think that it would make it worse.  I would love to hear what you, and <br/>
anyone<br/>
else, have to say. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
i use the term attatchment parenting, but it is not synonymous with the image <br/>
portrayed on 20/20 the other nite!  they said, among other things: <br/>
controversial, simplistic, no strollers, and having the goal of nursing their <br/>
child as long as possible!  ha!  tho i have breastfed my babies up to 3 <br/>
years, i would certainly not state that as my goal!!  it was simply meeting <br/>
the needs of the child!  o well, i guess we already know not to get our best <br/>
info from tv!  my local news show had a follow up piece afterward and did a <br/>
much better job of presenting the reality imo.  that ap (attatchment <br/>
parenting) is a choice that works for them, strengthening and supporting the <br/>
love in their families!  that the parents had thought about what they wanted <br/>
their children to become (compassionate, loving, secure, etc), and that they <br/>
could easily see how ap was going to be the foundation. <br/>
<br/>
to answer your queries, faith.  i too couldnt imagine carrying my <br/>
not-only-big-at-birth-but-also-gaining-quickly babies every hour of the day.  <br/>
so i am content to have them around.  i &quot;sling&quot; them sometimes, (esp when <br/>
they are fussy or sick, or i need to dash into the store w/a toddler in hand) <br/>
and other times they are content just to know i am near and sensitive to <br/>
their needs.  and about them falling asleep, one of the greatest things about <br/>
the sling (to me) is that they can be easily layed down by just leaning over <br/>
the bed and sliding them off!<br/>
<br/>
we did take our babies everywhere pretty much.  and they usually did well bc <br/>
when mom is near they have everything they need.  i found that the first few <br/>
months usually fly by (okay, in retrospect anyway) and then by about 8-9mos i <br/>
could leave them w/ hubby for a few hours if i wanted.  and it extends from <br/>
there.  my 16mo old can have me gone for about 4-5hrs at a time for example <br/>
w/out him being upset.  of course EACH CHILD is DIFFERENT.  it has been <br/>
easier for us than for some because the kids have been pretty laid back.  i <br/>
have  friends who have the same age children as me and choose not to leave <br/>
them that long bc of the discomfort it causes the child.  another example is <br/>
that my little guy doesnt like the nursery at church at this stage so we <br/>
sacrifice a less disrupted service (since we are the mature adults) instead <br/>
of having the baby be upset for that hour in the nursery (which i <br/>
heartbreakingly see parents do every week!! :( )<br/>
<br/>
i wonder if this is an example of child centered parenting that we discussed <br/>
earlier?  is this something that ezzo program would look down on?  to us, <br/>
sacrifice=love when done with that motivation.  just like the big one!  <br/>
<br/>
it is amazes me again and again that different people can see the very same <br/>
thing and feel so differently about it!  oh the wonders of our uniqueness!<br/>

I have never gone through the infant class of the Ezzo&#39;s, so I don&#39;t know what<br/>
they think.  I was just loaned the book that I have only read bits and peices of,<br/>
just to get an idea of a sample schedule.<br/>
<br/>
But at our church, if the baby is constantly crying the parent is called and<br/>
takes the child!  I choose not to leave my babies in the nursery until they&#39;re<br/>
about 6 months old anyway.  And then I do it gradually, for short periods of<br/>
time, until they are comfortable being there.  My 2 yr old loved it right away,<br/>
when she was a baby.  She loves playing with the &#39;babies&#39; at church.  In fact she<br/>
asks everyday to go to church.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, with my now 3month old (yay, she&#39;s one month older, and growing so<br/>
fast :-(), I usually miss the sermon altogether.  We stay in there for worship bc<br/>
if she starts being fussy no one can hear. And in our church, worship is a real<br/>
party (dancing, jumping, shouting, etc., we&#39;re pentacostal, if you can&#39;t tell<br/>
;-)) so I usually just dance around with her and she loves it!  But when the<br/>
sermon starts, if she gets fussy I just walk out or stay in the back near the<br/>
doors for a quick exit.  She used to sleep right through but as she gets older<br/>
she&#39;s awake for longer periods of time.  And I truly feel there is nothing wrong<br/>
with that sacrifice, either!  And I can&#39;t think of a single person I know who<br/>
would!  :-)<br/>
