You implied that tea is common in England, but not in the Portugeuse <br/>
culture....interestingly enough, Portugal is the way tea made it <br/>
into Europe.<br/>
Do you know your own country&#39;s history? Maybe this has nothing to do <br/>
with the reason you used the analogy, but it makes me question any <br/>
information you write.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a paragraph from a cool website about tea:<br/>
<br/>
Tea makes its way to Europe<br/>
<br/>
The first European to personally encounter tea and write about it <br/>
was the Portuguese Jesuit Father Jasper de Cruz in 1560 A.D., in his <br/>
capacity as a missionary. After the introduction of tea into <br/>
Portugal, they shipped tea to Lisbon; and Dutch ships transported it <br/>
to France, Holland and the Baltic countries. Because of the travel <br/>
costs to ship, at that time, tea cost over $100 per pound! This made <br/>
it the domain of the wealthy. But, by 1675 A. D., it was less <br/>
expensive and available in the food shops throughout Holland and <br/>
France. Tea drinking became part of the way of life. Dutch inns <br/>
provided the first restaurant service of tea. Tavern owners <br/>
furnished hot portable tea sets to their guests at their garden <br/>
tables. Into the 1700&#39;s France and Holland led Europe in the use of <br/>
tea.<br/>
<br/>
And this from another site:<br/>
 As the centuries passed and trade with the West opened up, the <br/>
status of tea increased. Tea was introduced to continental Europe <br/>
during Elizabethan times, but did not reach English shores until the <br/>
years 1657-1660. It was the Dutch who first brought tea to the <br/>
continent. The Russians also knew about it before the English, as <br/>
did the Portuguese. And it was a Venetian, Gian Battista Ramusio, <br/>
who was the first European to write about tea. <br/>
<br/>
Ren:<br/>
I can&#39;t guarantee this, but I can guess that if I researched it, I <br/>
could find a connection to tea in virtually every country in the <br/>
world. Whether it was a local version or the black tea that has been <br/>
making it&#39;s way through most cultures for centuries.<br/>
<br/>
My point?<br/>
Tea is everywhere, Portugal included.<br/>
Everythng in the whole wide world is connected, whether you like it <br/>
or not.<br/>
Trying to keep violence completely out of your child&#39;s world is not <br/>
only impossible (it would be like hiding tea from him) it&#39;s also <br/>
doing him a disservice. Calm, open communication about any topic is <br/>
far safer than knee-jerk reactions and outright meanness (calling <br/>
your child&#39;s actions &quot;freaky&quot; is cruel).<br/>
<br/>
Just as tea is all around us, so are weapons and human behavior. You <br/>
can&#39;t stop it, but together, you can happily learn about it.<br/>
