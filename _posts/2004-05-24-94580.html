<div id="ygrps-yiv-994150394">Yesterday morning Jess asked me why tiny babies couldn&#39;t drink cows milk. Naturally this led to a conversation about mammals and whales were brought up (as they do &lt;g&gt;). Jess wondered where on the whale&#39;s body, the baby drank from. Jacob (7) said he would go and get their animal book and see if the information was in there. <br/>
Jess and I continued talking and a few minutes later I looked down to see my just-learning-to-read son spread out on the floor searching through the index to find whales. He found it, turned to the appropriate page and we read the section together. I was so impressed that he knew how to use the index. I haven&#39;t shown him. I guess he has watched me do it often enough.<br/>
He spent the next hour sitting in front of the TV with his eyes glued to the book, reading out bits and pieces from the book from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
It was a very cool moment for me.<br/>
