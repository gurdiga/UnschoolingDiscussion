&gt; mellowed with time. But this list is about *supporting* unschooling,<br/>
&gt; and while we do encourage wandering off that topic, we don&#39;t need to<br/>
&gt; turn this into the Unschoolers Against Public Schooling list. Thanks<br/>
&gt; for understanding.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At Home Education Magazine we&#39;ve always tried to take a generally<br/>
&gt; positive approach to homeschooling and unschooling, helping people<br/>
&gt; find alternatives when they&#39;ve decided it&#39;s time to go seeking, but<br/>
&gt; not going out of our way to convince people that they&#39;re doing the<br/>
&gt; wrong thing and need to change (well, with one significant<br/>
&gt; politically-charged exception &lt;g&gt;). We quite regularly reject<br/>
&gt; articles badmouthing schools and teachers and the whole educational<br/>
&gt; bureaucracy, not because we want to promote the schooling experience<br/>
&gt; (*far* from it, trust me), but because it just doesn&#39;t make any sense<br/>
&gt; to us to try to build up what we believe in, what we trust and rely<br/>
&gt; on, by tearing down what other people might believe in and trust and<br/>
&gt; rely on. There are better ways to get along in the world.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They were gentle suggestions that perhaps got lost in the passion of debate?<br/>
<br/>
I sense the list is getting restless that this isn&#39;t dying down as it<br/>
appeared it was going to. You have a great deal useful to say about<br/>
*unschooling* which is what people signed onto the list for. It would help<br/>
to take off the political hat now so people can hear what you have to say<br/>
about unschooling.<br/>
