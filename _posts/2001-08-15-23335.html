<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592192515">Somewhat oversharing, down the way, but here goes:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Ancient India had diapers, there are references to a river in their mythos<br/>
where Krishna&#39;s diapers were washed.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had this Indian boyfriend who wasn&#39;t circumcised.  Surprisingly, he <br/>
reappears in this forum so soon!   He had two much brothers 12, 14 years <br/>
younger.  When they were little he and the mom and other kids had been in <br/>
India while the dad was in Toronto studying physics.    He said the babies <br/>
didn&#39;t wear diapers, just little kurtas, the long white shirts.   In India <br/>
they have floor-hole toilets, and he said the mom taught the little guys to <br/>
poop by squatting or sitting and making a little potty-seat with her feet, <br/>
like heels together, feet arched, toes together, outsides of feet toward the <br/>
floor, and setting the baby on her feet and the baby would poop and then <br/>
she&#39;d flush it (if it was in the toilet) or just clean it up (if it had been <br/>
on the ground, or on paper or whatever--that I wasn&#39;t clear on).<br/>
<br/>
He was just noting that the little potty-chairs Americans use are not <br/>
efficient for helping babies poop because squatting is the way anyway, knees <br/>
up, butt down.  He was pre-med and ended up going off elsewhere and becoming <br/>
a doctor, and he was interested in some of the dumb things Americans thought <br/>
were good and right, like chair-style toilets.  <br/>
<br/>
I still remember the first time I passed by and saw him squatted up on the <br/>
toilet seat, reading a magazine.<br/>
<br/>
And even now, sometimes if I&#39;m having a difficult time pooping I squat and it <br/>
really does  help.   <br/>
<br/>
This clever friend said we would have WAY fewer health problems if we didn&#39;t <br/>
strain ourselves to try to push poop out with muscles which weren&#39;t intended <br/>
for that, and if we&#39;d use the natural position all would be better.<br/>

I had read in one of the Bradley Method books that hemmorhoids are basically<br/>
unheard of in countries that squat instead of using a toilet like ours.<br/>
There was reference to an Indian doctor who would perch up on the toilet to<br/>
squat.<br/>
