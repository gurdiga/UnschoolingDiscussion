simplistic idea of whom most of the notable forefathers were and what they <br/>
believed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818830010">Also if you look at the book of Acts, the church was communal in nature.<br/>
<br/>
All the belivers were together and had everything in common. Selling their<br/>
posessions and goods, they gave to every one who had need. Acts 2:44-45<br/>
<br/>
All the believers were one in heart and mind. no one clamied any of his<br/>
posessions was his own., but they shared everything they had. with great<br/>
power the apostles continued to testify to the ressurection of the Lord<br/>
Jesus and much grace was upon them all. There were no needy persons among<br/>
them. From time to time those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought<br/>
the money from the sales and put it at the aposles feet, and it was<br/>
distributed to anyone as he had need. Acts 4:32-35<br/>
<br/>
Nobody should seek his own good, but the good of others. I Corinthians 10:24<br/>
<br/>
Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the<br/>
interests of others. Philippians 2:4<br/>
<br/>
God&#39;s plan is communal, it is human nature and sin that is the problem.<br/>
<br/>
