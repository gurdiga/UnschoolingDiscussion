&lt;&lt; I can relate to your position a little bit from both sides.  My husband<br/>
teaches 9th grade English and I am sometimes guilty of trying to help<br/>
him find ways to lure the kids into learning against their will. <br/>
(Mostly what I do is look for interesting short stories and articles for<br/>
the kids to read, but still it rubs a bit against the unschooling grain.)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the kids have to be there, making what they do surprising and intriguing <br/>
and interesting is what EVERY teacher should be doing.  Those are the only <br/>
things they will remember, the things that shocked them or amused them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you should feel bad about that.<br/>
