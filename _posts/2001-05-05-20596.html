&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now I&#39;m not the list owner or anything, I&#39;m just<br/>
&gt;saying this as my own personal observation. I hope I&#39;m not offending anyone<br/>
&gt;or stepping on anyone&#39;s toes. so this is my own personal request:  I&#39;d ask<br/>
&gt;people to think before they post  if what they are saying adds to the list<br/>
&gt;as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, Robin, thanks for writing what I&#39;ve been thinking for a few days <br/>
now! I&#39;ve been meaning to write much same thing, but keep getting <br/>
distracted by other stuff (see my next posts), and I kept thinking it <br/>
would all settle back down again...<br/>
<br/>
I *have* enjoyed the wonderful posts from Valerie and Laurie and <br/>
everyone else, but I&#39;ve had a hard time keeping up even with this <br/>
list on digest!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for writing what you did. As listowner, I&#39;m with you 100%.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-824656792">I will agree here...  I have just taken myself off the list as I can&#39;t keep up<br/>
at all either, and figured it was better to stop for a few days...<br/>
