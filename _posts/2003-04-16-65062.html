<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727469255">Okay, we had a something happen last night that I just wasn&#39;t <br/>
prepared for.<br/>
<br/>
(a little background)<br/>
When Jason and I became parents we had a long talk about religion and <br/>
spirituality. We both have different views - he&#39;s athiest, with <br/>
eastern/toaist leanings, I&#39;m pagan, but still seeking. We both come <br/>
from very diverse families - his family are southern baptist one one <br/>
side and head up and run the morman church here in S.D. on the other, <br/>
but his parents are wiccan. My family, my mome is christian, stepdad <br/>
raised jewish(doesn&#39;t parctice), my dad is a follower of native <br/>
american spirituality and a memeber of the native american church, <br/>
and my step mom is lutherian.<br/>
<br/>
So, Jason and I talked and talked about how to prestent our beliefs <br/>
to our kids. We both decided that we would wait, having both had <br/>
religion forced down out throats - Jason, christianity and paganism, <br/>
and me, chrisianity. We wanted our kids to have an option that we as <br/>
children didn&#39;t have. To choose for them selves. We decided that when <br/>
they were ready, meaning when they came to use with questions, we <br/>
would start talking and exploreing ideas and relgions frm all over <br/>
and give them the information to choose on their own what the wanted <br/>
to belive.<br/>
<br/>
We figured the questions would start when they were about 6-7, but <br/>
were prepared for them at any time. So last night...<br/>
<br/>
Jaiden started telling us all about Jesus, we asked him where he had <br/>
heard about Jesus. He told us that gramy(my mom) had been telling him <br/>
all about him, how he was like a saver, and a super hero...needless <br/>
to say, Jason jumped on the phone and had a long talk with her. She <br/>
said that she wouldn&#39;t do it again. We asked if Jaiden had been <br/>
asking questions, and she said no, but that she had felt that it was <br/>
her duty to make sure he knew all about god, that way he would be <br/>
protected against our beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t know what to do, i feel like what I wanted for my kids, <br/>
free choice, is gone. I feel like I have damamge to undo that I had <br/>
never planned on. All the grandparents knew where we stood on <br/>
religion and belief and we had no problem with them sharing there <br/>
belifes with the kids, as long as it was honest and sought after. And <br/>
we wanted to be there, if the kids were very young.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m just not really sure where to go from here. Do I let it lie, <br/>
and wait for Jaiden to come to us, do I start introducing other <br/>
belife systems. I&#39;m feeling very lost at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to anyone who made it to the end of this. Any ideas would <br/>
be helpful.<br/>
<br/>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as damaging as you feel it is right now. How old <br/>
is Jaiden? Kids get input from lots of different sources on lots of <br/>
different topics. It&#39;s okay to calmly mention that &quot;superhero Jesus&quot; <br/>
is what Grandma believes in and isn&#39;t that great for her. Lots of <br/>
people have different beliefs. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to <br/>

we are also helping our kids to find their own spirituality. They see <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-746397544">Well,  I can only say that what people believe is usually very important<br/>
to them.  And often it&#39;s important to them to share it with the next<br/>
generations.  SO Jaiden can learn that.  And while you can talk to<br/>
relatives and friends about how and what they say to your son, it&#39;s up<br/>
to you to manage your own response.  <br/>
<br/>
If she had talked to him about the Civil War or evolution orthe night<br/>
sky and constellations, even if he hadn&#39;t asked, would that pose a<br/>
problem?  She either sparks his curiosity or bores him and he doesn&#39;t<br/>
ask.  He brought it home to you to discuss....keep the communication<br/>
open.  If you believe that he has his own path to knowledge and<br/>
understanding in other ares, why not in regard to faith and beliefs?<br/>

I don&#39;t see it as damaging.  I would just say, &quot;Lots of people believe that.  <br/>
Others believe other things.&quot;  You don&#39;t need to explain everything right <br/>
now.  <br/>
<br/>
At Easter you could tell him what Easter&#39;s about (bunny bits and crucifix <br/>
bits both) and he&#39;ll build his own model of the history of religion in his <br/>
own head, gradually.<br/>
<br/>
He can&#39;t really have choice without information.  <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t be mad at the grandmother unless she told him you&#39;re going to hell <br/>
to burn in eternal pits of brimstone forever.  That might really torque me.  <br/>
But if she was more vague and bright about it, I&#39;d let it go.<br/>

Good point. If we freak out every time someone shares some new <br/>
information with our kids, they&#39;ll pick up on that. ::Breate:: Take <br/>
it in stride.  <br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
Well, those are fact based, not belief based. So kind of different. <br/>
But I see your point. What about if Grandma talked about aliens or <br/>
out of body experiences? <br/>

<br/>
As a parent, you have the ability to discuss those things with your <br/>
child, whether or not *you* think it&#39;s true, and why you think so.  <br/>
Even after the fact.  If you feel like your children are being told <br/>
untruths, then you also have the ability to remove them from the <br/>
situation.  (Something I&#39;ve been reminded of in my own recent <br/>
experiences with my grandmother and my children.)<br/>

I agree with this also. Look at it as information is story time. He&#39;s<br/>
learning about something new and can make his mind up about it later. You<br/>
can tell him other beliefs. I don&#39;t see it as harming as much as just<br/>
information. Now if she starts to preach and suggests her way is the only<br/>
right way, that&#39;s a problem.<br/>

<br/>
I know it&#39;s not as bad I&#39;m thinking it is, the post this morning was after a long night up with Jason, he was very upset about all of it, and a very unrestful sleep this morning. We did talk to Jaiden last night, explaining to him that Jesus was what gramy belives in, but that it&#39;s only one belife, lots of different people belive in lots of different things. <br/>
<br/>
What I am worried about, is the way that she&#39;s been telling him, going over our heads, she knew how we felt. Jaiden told me this morning that grammy told him not to belive what we said to him about religion, we are wrong, she&#39;s right. That I have a problem with.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;::Breathe:: All is well. Really.<br/>

them verbally as it seems appropriate.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is what we plan on doing, I just am angry and feel like I need to undo what she&#39;s done. I know that this stems from my childhood and the things that were done to me for the sake of religion, I&#39;m trying to let it go, moments like this just make it hard. I don&#39;t want to put my feelings on to my kids. I want them to have choices. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m being very clear, or even rational at this point, if I&#39;m not, I&#39;m sorry this is just a very touchy subject for me and Jason.<br/>

What I am worried about, is the way that she&#39;s been telling him, going over<br/>
our heads, she knew how we felt. Jaiden told me this morning that grammy<br/>
told him not to belive what we said to him about religion, we are wrong,<br/>

*That* I would have a problem with, a huge problem.  At the least, I would<br/>
tell him that some people are so convinced that their religion is the right<br/>
one that they feel they have to tell everyone about it.  If he said that it<br/>
bothered him, I&#39;d tell him to just smile and nod or something and change the<br/>
subject.  (I also doubt I&#39;d let him go there without a parent.)<br/>

No, those things would not bother me, and my problems with her discusing this with him are, the way she chose to go about it, and I know what it is that she belives and how she teaches it. I&#39;m still trying to get over it.<br/>

We did discuss it, and will continue to discuss it as Jaiden wants to. I do belive that he has his own path in regards to faith and belife, and that part of the problem. My mom doesn&#39;t belive it, she wants him on her path, not his. I want him to have more than her opinion, and the way she presented it to him was that she has the ONLY truth and anything Jason and I might say to him would be a lie.<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] kids and beliefs (really long)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, we had a something happen last night that I just wasn&#39;t <br/>
prepared for.<br/>
<br/>
(a little background)<br/>
When Jason and I became parents we had a long talk about religion and <br/>
spirituality. We both have different views - he&#39;s athiest, with <br/>
eastern/toaist leanings, I&#39;m pagan, but still seeking. We both come <br/>
from very diverse families - his family are southern baptist one one <br/>
side and head up and run the morman church here in S.D. on the other, <br/>
but his parents are wiccan. My family, my mome is christian, stepdad <br/>
raised jewish(doesn&#39;t parctice), my dad is a follower of native <br/>
american spirituality and a memeber of the native american church, <br/>
and my step mom is lutherian.<br/>
<br/>
So, Jason and I talked and talked about how to prestent our beliefs <br/>
to our kids. We both decided that we would wait, having both had <br/>
religion forced down out throats - Jason, christianity and paganism, <br/>
and me, chrisianity. We wanted our kids to have an option that we as <br/>
children didn&#39;t have. To choose for them selves. We decided that when <br/>
they were ready, meaning when they came to use with questions, we <br/>
would start talking and exploreing ideas and relgions frm all over <br/>
and give them the information to choose on their own what the wanted <br/>
to belive.<br/>
<br/>
We figured the questions would start when they were about 6-7, but <br/>
were prepared for them at any time. So last night...<br/>
<br/>
Jaiden started telling us all about Jesus, we asked him where he had <br/>
heard about Jesus. He told us that gramy(my mom) had been telling him <br/>
all about him, how he was like a saver, and a super hero...needless <br/>
to say, Jason jumped on the phone and had a long talk with her. She <br/>
said that she wouldn&#39;t do it again. We asked if Jaiden had been <br/>
asking questions, and she said no, but that she had felt that it was <br/>
her duty to make sure he knew all about god, that way he would be <br/>
protected against our beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t know what to do, i feel like what I wanted for my kids, <br/>
free choice, is gone. I feel like I have damamge to undo that I had <br/>
never planned on. All the grandparents knew where we stood on <br/>
religion and belief and we had no problem with them sharing there <br/>
belifes with the kids, as long as it was honest and sought after. And <br/>
we wanted to be there, if the kids were very young.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m just not really sure where to go from here. Do I let it lie, <br/>
and wait for Jaiden to come to us, do I start introducing other <br/>
belife systems. I&#39;m feeling very lost at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to anyone who made it to the end of this. Any ideas would <br/>
be helpful.<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t see it as damaging.  I would just say, &quot;Lots of people believe that.  <br/>
Others believe other things.&quot;  You don&#39;t need to explain everything right <br/>
now.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to look at it a different way, a lot of what I wrote this morning was coming from a place of remembering my childhood experances at the hands of my mothers religion. <br/>
<br/>
We have been talking today about other belife systems and reading stories. Jaiden has found it interesting, but he keeps asking why grammy said I would lie to him.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;At Easter you could tell him what Easter&#39;s about (bunny bits and crucifix <br/>
bits both) and he&#39;ll build his own model of the history of religion in his <br/>
own head, gradually.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have been doing this, I love &quot;holidays&quot; and have a nice collection of folk tales from different regions and we read them, and talk about them. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;He can&#39;t really have choice without information.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree, I just wanted the information to be unbiased and honest, not Jesus is a flying, cape wareing super hero the likes of superman. Thats not honest.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I wouldn&#39;t be mad at the grandmother unless she told him you&#39;re going to hell <br/>
to burn in eternal pits of brimstone forever.  That might really torque me.  <br/>
But if she was more vague and bright about it, I&#39;d let it go.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, she didn&#39;t tell him about burning in hell, but she did tell him that I would lie to him and she would tell him the truth. <br/>

I&#39;m breathing. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not freaking out, at least not on the outside&lt;g&gt;. Jason freaked out a bit last night, but most of it was after Jaiden and Avery were in bed, and we were alone.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;If she had talked to him about the Civil War or evolution orthe <br/>
 </span></blockquote>night sky and constellations, even if he hadn&#39;t asked, would that <br/>
pose a problem?<br/>
<br/>
Well, those are fact based, not belief based. So kind of different. <br/>
But I see your point. What about if Grandma talked about aliens or <br/>
out of body experiences?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think, it&#39;s really more the way she talked to him about it that&#39;s bothering me. She was not honest. I have a problem with lieing, to any one. She doesn&#39;t have a problem lieing to kids, if it suits her purpose. <br/>
<br/>
If she had sat down with him and talked to him about her belifes and why she belived that way, and mentioned that others belived diffrently but this was why she belives the way she does, I might be a little upset, but not like this. I could except that, and if Jaiden was interested in following up on it okay. <br/>
<br/>
But she didn&#39;t, and I&#39;m upset.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;So what if she did?  Personally, I STILL think it would be cool to <br/>
hear my Grandma talk about those things!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you think it would be cool if she lied about what she belived, just to get your kids interested? (the flying, capewearing superhero Jesus)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just me.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;As a parent, you have the ability to discuss those things with your <br/>
child, whether or not *you* think it&#39;s true, and why you think so.  <br/>
Even after the fact.  If you feel like your children are being told <br/>
untruths, then you also have the ability to remove them from the <br/>
situation.  (Something I&#39;ve been reminded of in my own recent <br/>
experiences with my grandmother and my children.)&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I belive that when it comes to personal belifes, it&#39;s just that personal, and that each person needs to find there own truths. I want that for my kids. I don&#39;t want them lied to just for the sake of getting them interested in something they may not be interested in.(did that make sense?)<br/>
<br/>
I know what my mom belives as far as Jesus is concerned. I also know that she presented it to Jaiden the way she did to get him interested, because he wasn&#39;t.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;I agree with this also. Look at it as information is story time. He&#39;s<br/>
learning about something new and can make his mind up about it later. You<br/>
can tell him other beliefs. I don&#39;t see it as harming as much as just<br/>
information. Now if she starts to preach and suggests her way is the only<br/>
right way, that&#39;s a problem.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

She did, she told hi that we would lie to him and she would tell him the truth.<br/>

Yes, I&#39;d have a problem with that too. I&#39;d tell Jaiden that Grandma <br/>

You can&#39;t undo what&#39;s she&#39;s done. But you can still approach <br/>
spirituality with Jaiden just like you planned. She&#39;s gonna just have <br/>
to be one of those life lessons along the path.<br/>

complete sense.  What I was trying to get across was that if I were <br/>
in your situation, I would offer my son my beliefs and let him know <br/>
that *I* felt like what Grandma said was wrong.  It also sounds like <br/>
your mother isn&#39;t just offering her beliefs though.  She seems to be <br/>
stating them as fact and telling him YOU are wrong.  THAT is what <br/>
*I* would have a problem with.  Basically, I don&#39;t find sharing <br/>
beliefs to be a bad thing.  It is when they are presented in a &quot;my <br/>
way or the highway&quot; or &quot;your mother is lying to you&quot; sort of way <br/>
that it becomes dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
Your children have the unique opporunity to truly make their own <br/>
informed decisions.  What a rich religious family background!<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I was trying to be supportive.  It&#39;s hard to convey the <br/>
sound of words in print.  I think you just misunderstood what I was <br/>
saying, that&#39;s all.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;I agree with this also. Look at it as information is story time. He&#39;s<br/>
learning about something new and can make his mind up about it later. You<br/>
can tell him other beliefs. I don&#39;t see it as harming as much as just<br/>
information. Now if she starts to preach and suggests her way is the only<br/>
right way, that&#39;s a problem.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
..<br/>
She did, she told hi that we would lie to him and she would tell him the truth.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The biggest thing we did with our kids from the start is taught them how to question. Even us. We tell tem our beliefs and how we see things but also let them question that as well because after all I really don&#39;t KNOW for sure. I think when we did this they understood over time we had nothing to hide or defend. Being open and honest about being subject to faults will only show him that you are being the most truthful, I would guess.<br/>
<br/>
After all he has trusted you by telling you in the first place. Just keep the conversation going. I wouldn&#39;t drill him for information but having somewhat the same situation, I ask the kids when they have been someplace if someone asked about this or that. If so I go on to talk about it as long as they seem interested and as you go, ask them if they have any questions...<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;Yes, I&#39;d have a problem with that too. I&#39;d tell Jaiden that Grandma <br/>
is wrong, flat out. She means well but is following a belief system <br/>
based on fear. You don&#39;t need that passed on to him. I&#39;m assuming you <br/>
already told Grandma this is not okay.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had a chance to talk to her today, Jason has though, and I&#39;m waiting for things to calm down a little before I talk to her, but I think she has the idea.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;You can&#39;t undo what&#39;s she&#39;s done. But you can still approach <br/>
spirituality with Jaiden just like you planned. She&#39;s gonna just have <br/>
to be one of those life lessons along the path.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know that I cant, one of those life rewinders would be kinda nice right now, though :). I like that, grammy the life lesson &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;Woah, woah!  Hang on a second!  That wasn&#39;t taken in context.  I was <br/>
specifically talking about the aliens comment when I said that.  <br/>
Should have made that more clear.  Sorry for the confusion.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, I should have waited to post, but I hit send before I could take it back. Jason and my mom were arguing while I was writing this and your post got caught up in all the emotion. I think I did misunderstand also, again I am sorry.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I am in complete agreement with you.  And what you said makes <br/>
complete sense.  What I was trying to get across was that if I were <br/>
in your situation, I would offer my son my beliefs and let him know <br/>
that *I* felt like what Grandma said was wrong.  It also sounds like <br/>
your mother isn&#39;t just offering her beliefs though.  She seems to be <br/>
stating them as fact and telling him YOU are wrong.  THAT is what <br/>
*I* would have a problem with.  Basically, I don&#39;t find sharing <br/>
beliefs to be a bad thing.  It is when they are presented in a &quot;my <br/>
way or the highway&quot; or &quot;your mother is lying to you&quot; sort of way <br/>
that it becomes dangerous.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t find belief sharing to to bad, as long as it is presented in an open and honest way, and unfortunatly, my mom didn&#39;t go that route. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Your children have the unique opporunity to truly make their own <br/>
informed decisions.  What a rich religious family background!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s full alright, not sure how we are all able to be in the same place at the same time &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;All in all, I was trying to be supportive.  It&#39;s hard to convey the <br/>
sound of words in print.  I think you just misunderstood what I was <br/>
saying, that&#39;s all.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did misunderstand I&#39;m sorry if I jumped on you, it&#39;s been a long day.<br/>

We, hopefully, have shown him that it is okay to question everything, he&#39;s just a very sweet trusting child, the thought that someone he loves would not be completly open and honest with him is hard for him to understand.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;After all he has trusted you by telling you in the first place. Just keep the conversation going.

<br/>
I think part of the reason he told us what she said, was because he was told that we were going to lie to him, it was something he didn&#39;t understand.<br/>
<br/>
We did have a good time reading some different spring/easter stories today, and planning what we were going to do, I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;ll be spending it with my mom or not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-136614489">**I haven&#39;t had a chance to talk to her today, Jason has though, and I&#39;m<br/>
waiting for things to calm down a little before I talk to her, but I<br/>
think she has the idea.**<br/>
<br/>
Would it help to mostly stay away from the religious content of the<br/>
controversy and just focus on the fact that you don&#39;t appreciate it that<br/>
she called you a liar to your son?<br/>
<br/>
Telling him her beliefs, even if you don&#39;t believe them, is more of a<br/>
gray area, in my opinion, than the other offense.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;*That* I would have a problem with, a huge problem.  At the least, I would<br/>
tell him that some people are so convinced that their religion is the right<br/>
one that they feel they have to tell everyone about it.  If he said that it<br/>
bothered him, I&#39;d tell him to just smile and nod or something and change the<br/>
subject.  (I also doubt I&#39;d let him go there without a parent.)&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jason had a long talk with Jaiden today, I they discussed things a little more indepth than I had with him, and I think that Jaiden has a little better understanding as to where my mom is coming from, something I didn&#39;t really want to have happen at 4, but it was out of my control and were trying to make the best of the situation.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to always have a parent with him because he goes to spend the night with my little brother, I hate to take that away from him. Jason had a long talk with my mom today, and I&#39;m going to talk to hertomorrow and we&#39;ll see wher ethings are standing then.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;I would too, but I would explain to him why she believes that way, that she <br/>
honestly believes in hell, which you don&#39;t, and that she&#39;s afraid he might go <br/>
there, but you are SURE there&#39;s no danger of that.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did talk to him a bunch today, and I&#39;ll be here willing to talk to him when ever he needs to. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;It&#39;s sad that this will color his future discussions with his grandmother.  <br/>
No matter what she talks to him about for a while, I bet he&#39;ll be wary.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It makes me sad too, as much as we disagree, I love her and I know that she loves her grandkids. Jaiden is a little hurt right now, and he feels bad that she would tell him lies. I feel bad that he&#39;s lost a little of his trust in the world.<br/>
