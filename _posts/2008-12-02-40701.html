<div id="ygrps-yiv-161841775">12. Don&#39;t try to &quot;make kids think.&quot; They WILL think, you don&#39;t have  <br/>
to make them. Don&#39;t use every opportunity to force them to learn  <br/>
something. They WILL learn something at every opportunity, you don&#39;t  <br/>
have to force it. Don&#39;t answer a question by telling them to &quot;look it  <br/>
up&quot; or by asking them another question. If you know the answer, give  <br/>
it. If you don&#39;t, then HELP them find it. Speculating about an answer  <br/>
often leads to a good conversation. If your child stops seeing you as  <br/>
helpful when they have questions, they&#39;ll stop coming to you with  <br/>
their questions. Is that what you really want?<br/>
