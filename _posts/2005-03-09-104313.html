<div id="ygrps-yiv-586670118">Hello everyone. i was wondering if anyone could give<br/>
me some ideas on how to get my kids out of the house<br/>
more often on a limited budget. My kids went to public<br/>
school for a long time and i finally pulled them out<br/>
because i did not like alot of things that were going<br/>
on. my oldest daughte thought it was okay not to come<br/>
home from school because her friends didn&#39;t have too.<br/>
and my second son just did not like school period. he<br/>
did not do any of his work and i was always going to<br/>
that school for him. My third child was always getting<br/>
into trouble at school. like he refused to go to<br/>
anouther class for detention and so fourth. with him<br/>
the main reason i pulled him is because i was at his<br/>
school two or three times a day. when he as in<br/>
kindergarten he got kicked out of school for three<br/>
days for spreading germs, in first grade he told his<br/>
teacher that he didn&#39;t want to do an assignment and<br/>
she yelled at him and he yelled back so he got into<br/>
trouble. in third grade he got into trouble again (by<br/>
this time he was becomming a big boy) by breaking his<br/>
pencils and not wanting to sit still. The got tired of<br/>
him because he just blew up. ( didn&#39;t hurt or touch<br/>
anyone but started yelling and cussing at them after<br/>
they grabbed him by the arms trying to move him from<br/>
one room to anouther) well they gave up on that and<br/>
had him arrested. with handcuffs and all. (all over<br/>
breaking a pencil and not wanting to sit still and not<br/>
following their rules) fourth grade they just pretty<br/>
much called me all day telling me what he is doing.<br/>
one time he went into the boys bathroom at school and<br/>
refused to come out. so they sent in my daughter. it<br/>
just went down hill after that. he is in the sixth<br/>
grade now. My question is my sons. they want to play<br/>
viedo games all day long and not do anything else. no<br/>
chores, no picking up after them selves and so on.<br/>
what do you guys suggest as an alturnative to what i<br/>
am doing now. im on a budget. thanks nancy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
God Bless You<br/>

If they&#39;ve been out of school for just a short while, let them play.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
While they&#39;re playing, please read here:<br/>

Seems crazy, but will change your life in pretty sweet ways.<br/>
You pick up after them for now.<br/>
Take them snacks, where they&#39;re  playing.<br/>

 <br/>
You have much more schooling from which to recover than they do, and until  <br/>
you work on your own new awareness of how learning works, usnchooling won&#39;t  <br/>
start to blossom.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
It won&#39;t cost you a dime to read those websites, pick up after your kids,  <br/>
and to appreciate the opportunity that&#39;s facing you and the adventure starting  <br/>
to unfold.<br/>
