<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935646668">When we lived in MA we had to (?) fill out a yearly town census.  The<br/>
year we had our son (at a local hospital), the census form had his name<br/>
and birthdate printed on it just under ours; presumably they collect<br/>
birth data from the hospitals or the state from whom the birth<br/>
certificate was issued.  Kink of freaky.  The year we left my son would<br/>
have been kindergarten age and a pre-enrollment package arrived in the<br/>
mail.  I&#39;m sure there are states where it&#39;s easier to stay off the<br/>
radar, but in the part of MA where we lived it sure seemed impossible.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll let more experienced voices answer your other questions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know what state she&#39;s in but in Ohio, you are required to notify. That&#39;s all. You <br/>
notify the school district and then you can&#39;t be considered truant. At the end of the year, <br/>
you test or do a portfolio evaluation (which just means you pay someone to certify thta <br/>
you did homeschool).<br/>
<br/>
Each state is different.<br/>

Every state has compulsory education laws, so a resident child exists.<br/>

Sure there is.  If they define it, it exists for them, and if they have <br/>
authority they can exercise that authority.<br/>
<br/>
-=- And if so, where can I read more about this?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Go to google.com and look up some of those terms and your state&#39;s name.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about how people learn, so it&#39;s not a good topic for this list.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling IS homeschooling.  We can&#39;t get away from that.  When we&#39;re home <br/>
in a place where there are compulsory attendance laws, we had better know what <br/>
law or exception is enabling us to be home.  As there are people here from <br/>
all over the English-speaking world, I&#39;m not interested in talking about the <br/>
umpty-dozen jurisdictions and their differences.   Local or regional lists would <br/>
be better for that.<br/>

Not necessarily in Texas.  There is a comp ed law but it only <br/>
pertains to those children enrolled in public school.  There is no <br/>
oversight at all of private schools or homeschooling.  As such it has <br/>
been argued that TX doesn&#39;t really have a comp ed law- by the <br/>
Democratic party no less.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t any educational neglect in Texas.  That doesn&#39;t mean that <br/>
that they can&#39;t change it at some time but right now CPS cannot asked <br/>
to see curriculum or homeschool work as part of an ivestigation.  <br/>
They don&#39;t bother telling parents that though.  Once the child is in <br/>
the system for other reasons, they can order any type testing or <br/>
evaluation that they want and put the child in school.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same with vaccinations.  They can&#39;t accuse you of neglect if <br/>
you don&#39;t have them because the law doesn&#39;t require them except to go <br/>
to public school but the first thing they&#39;ll do after they&#39;ve taken <br/>
custody is get them to a Dr. and give them to them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-260610072">Interesting...I wonder if this is how a child becomes a &#39;resident <br/>
child&#39; as Sandra Dodd referred to.  Therefore, if someone has a home <br/>
birth and never is issued a birth certificate, it seems like it would <br/>
just be hard to put the child on a map. (Of course we do have social <br/>
security cards for our children.)<br/>
<br/>
I was skimming a new book in the library called something like, Who&#39;s <br/>
Teaching Our Children written by two women whose names I can&#39;t <br/>
recall.  Anyhow, they had a short chapter on homeschooling, and it <br/>
mentioned how federally funded schools get so much money per child <br/>
enrolled, and I wonder if homeschoolers have to go through so much <br/>
red tape because the states would really rather the child be in <br/>
school so they can get more money for their schools.  (I.E. they are <br/>
concerned more with money than the child&#39;s actual quality of <br/>
education.)<br/>

<br/>
Santa Fe was FULL of unregistered births in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s and I know some <br/>
of these now-30&#39;s, 20&#39;s people.  If there are eye witnesses to the birth, <br/>
they can apply for a birth certificate.  With that, they can get a passport.   <br/>
One batch did that and went to play streetfairs in Europe (a <br/>
juggling/magic/stiltdancing family).   One single wasn&#39;t able to do it well enough or quick <br/>
enough, and missed a trip to where his European relatives lived (one of the new <br/>
republics I don&#39;t have the names of yet; his name is Bela, so that neighborhood). <br/>
 Had to let a ticket to Europe go for no passport.  Bummer.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
I wish they would just change the funding so that the schools got money by <br/>
population, not enrollment.  Then, though, they&#39;d probably be trying to keep <br/>
homeschoolers OUT so the money would go farther.  That would be a fine sight to <br/>
see.  Then people would really see what they were thinking. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
In Ohio, at least (and I am assuming the whole U.S. because S.S. is <br/>
a federal program), you must apply for a birth certificate in order <br/>
to get a Social Security number. I had Emma at home and my husband, <br/>
J., signed the paperwork as the person who delivered her, witness to <br/>
the birth, and father.<br/>
(3 midwives were there for the delivery, but it is standard for them <br/>
to list the dad :)<br/>
<br/>
Without the birth certificate, we could not get a Social Security <br/>
number and we wanted it for tax and benefit purposes.<br/>
I suppose if you were not interested in being in the system, it is <br/>
NOT a legal requirement to have a S.S. number.<br/>
<br/>
It would definitely make many things harder.<br/>
It took me months to get Emma covered (in writing) for health <br/>
insurance while I spoke to person after person who couldn&#39;t figure <br/>
out what the procedure should be for someone born at home not yet <br/>
issued a S.S. number. And then trying to schedule her well checks <br/>
without proof of insurance, but not willing to pay, was fun too!<br/>
<br/>
Good thing my kids are sooooooo worth it :)<br/>
