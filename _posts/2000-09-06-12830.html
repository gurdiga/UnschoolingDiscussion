<div id="ygrps-yiv-958949082">NOW is the time to start getting a 3rd party really organized for the next<br/>
election!  We need to let the other parties know that we want a choice and<br/>
that we want them out there a visible before the big rush!  It is the only<br/>
way to break the strangle hold the current money grubbers have on the<br/>
average citizen!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Weelllll, IMHO, this is a prison sentence without a trial!  Oh, <br/>
&gt; and if you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  read the article, that evil, the NEA, that supposedly is only <br/>
&gt; supporting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Gore is out in full force behind Dubya and the KIPP idea!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; You know, I live in Texas and I&#39;ve never heard of this KIPP thing.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I do know that Bush is considered a proponent of homeschooling, and <br/>
&gt; he has <br/>
&gt; &gt; never done anything in Texas to tamper with our liberal <br/>
&gt; homeschooling laws.  <br/>

&gt; What saints all these politicians are (LOL)... By rights we all out <br/>
&gt; to be Libertarians as they are only party that believes in <br/>
&gt; homeschooling/unschooling letting parents take care of their kids <br/>
&gt; education without intervention from the goverment.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope this hasn&#39;t started another flame war on politics because if it <br/>
&gt; does I&#39;m out this time... I&#39;ll just watch (LOL)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is pretty much what my libertarian husband says.  Politics is the art of <br/>
compromise, and I don&#39;t believe that any politician is immune from illusions <br/>
of grandeur.  In other words, I don&#39;t trust them.  But, I&#39;ll look carefully <br/>
come November, and I&#39;ll vote.  That way, I&#39;ll have the right to grumble in <br/>
January when he (whoever he is) takes over.<br/>
