birthday.  We all strive to have children born later in a month, so that<br/>
they can really celebrate their Star birthday!<br/>

Yeah right, two of mine already had theirs on the 2nd and 4th. They just <br/>
didn&#39;t really get it!!!! The next two will understand &quot;much better&quot; as my <br/>
baby says. They can wait until the 17th and the 26th.<br/>

Mine was extra special. It was on the 28th and I always had a big problem <br/>
with birthdays. Just my own of course. Never liked the idea of getting older <br/>
and it really bothered me. But when I was 28 on the 28th, I had my first <br/>
baby with me and it didn&#39;t matter one bit how old I was turning. 28 was just <br/>
wonderful then, and so far so has 38 and soon looking forward to 48!!!!<br/>
