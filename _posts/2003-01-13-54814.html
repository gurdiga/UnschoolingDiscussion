<br/>
1.&lt; Its not much, but it says a lot for kids learning on thier own, of thier<br/>
own<br/>
 curiousity. &gt;<br/>
&lt;Its funnny how<br/>
 even  $.14 candy bar can teach so much&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Teresa<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks.  You said it&#39;s not much, but it&#39;s a wonderful example - lots of<br/>
math, lots of different ages interacting, and best of all, those delicious<br/>
candy bars, right?<br/>
<br/>
2.&gt; &gt; Paula used the phrase &quot;love to learn.&quot;  I think I&#39;d rather they &quot;learn<br/>
to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; love.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Luckily, they don&#39;t have to choose.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Paula<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Touche.  Sorry, I see now that sounded rude.  I didn&#39;t mean to.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3.&lt;thought a good way to learn that stuff was the pool table. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hooray!  That&#39;s how I learned about angles in high school. But I&#39;m not very<br/>
good at it either.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4. here&#39;s a little essay I wrote sometime back when the question was posed<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;What do you hope your children will have gotten from unschooling when<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re grown?&quot;<br/>
&gt; Which to me is a different question than what my goals are:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   This was originally a post at unschooling dotcom email list:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What do you hope your kids will have gotten from unschooling by the time<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re ready to move on from home?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ren&#39;s reply:<br/>
&gt; My main goal was that their sense of self would be so strongly intact that<br/>
&gt; the world could not rob their joy, their uniqueness and thier natural<br/>
&gt; curiosity.<br/>
&gt; Beyond that.....<br/>
&gt; That the status quo will not matter so much to them as what is good and<br/>
&gt; right. That they<br/>
&gt; would have a deep seeded knowledge in their hearts that they are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>intelligent,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; capable human beings and can learn anything they wish.  A sense of wonder<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; awesome<br/>
&gt; that they will never quit seeing how magical the world truly is.  Have<br/>
&gt; idealism<br/>
&gt; tempered with realism.  Spirituality that flows natrually and freely from<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; loving heart and<br/>
&gt; posses kindness rare.  The ability to follow their dreams and achieve<br/>
 </span></blockquote>their<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; goals,<br/>
&gt; whatever those may be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And how do you plan to help that along?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It humbles me to think about this.  I came out of High School battered<br/>
&gt; emotionally, not knowing who I was or what I realy wanted.  And fifteen<br/>
 </span></blockquote>years<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; later, here I am<br/>
&gt; spouting off ideals for my children that I couldn&#39;t have dreamed of at the<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; I will help that along by becoming a better person myself.<br/>
&gt; By reading , watching , searching and regaining that sense of wonder,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>which<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; my children have helped me with already.<br/>
&gt; By delving deep into questions and not pretending I know more than them.<br/>
&gt; By being willing to set everything aside, change plans midstream and go<br/>
 </span></blockquote>off<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in a new direction when necessary.<br/>
&gt; By listening carefully and responding appropriately.<br/>
&gt; By respecting these amazing beings I&#39;ve been entrusted with and the inner<br/>
&gt; knowledge they already possess.<br/>
&gt; By dialoguing with them, these matters of the heart and showing love to<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; earth and my fellow human beings.<br/>
&gt; By filling my home with books, movies, music, instruments, nature, toys,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>art<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; materials and whatever oddities my children bring home.<br/>
&gt; By taking them to the places they want to go and ones they never knew<br/>
&gt; existed.<br/>
&gt; By fixing them new and exciting foods from other countries and making<br/>
 </span></blockquote>trips<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to the grocery store an adventure.<br/>
&gt; By making every day an adventure, by my attitude, every mundane chore or<br/>
&gt; daily activity sacred by how I approach it.<br/>
&gt; Healing myself has definitely been the most important step in assisting<br/>
 </span></blockquote>these<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; worthy individuals in their unschooling journey.  I have learned much from<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; thank the heavens they came here to teach me.<br/>
