<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114548522">A couple of comments & questions.<br/>
<br/>
First, I have read the threads about television, and I just gotta say -- NO<br/>
TV is GOOD TV -- even PBS (which I consider Socialism Max anyway) and<br/>
Discovery/History.  TV teaches children to think in &quot;flickers&quot;, as one<br/>
sociologist puts it.  He refers to the de facto maximum time a particular<br/>
&quot;scene&quot; lasts before a new view is brought up.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with him.<br/>
<br/>
Our son is now 9 months old, and he has yet to see a TV screen &quot;on&quot;, except<br/>
for one time when we did an experiment.  We turned the TV on ONCE when he<br/>
was about 7 months, and even though both of us were in the room and there<br/>
were plenty of other things to do and look at -- which he was always<br/>
otherwise perfectly happy with -- once he spotted that TV picture, it was<br/>
like there was nothing else in the room.  No matter what else happened for<br/>
the next five minutes, he would not take his eyes off that screen.<br/>
Needless to say, that was all we needed to know; it was enough for us.  The<br/>
TV has stayed OFF ever since.  Shortly, I am building a wall-mount cabinet<br/>
that will cover the TV with locked doors.<br/>
<br/>
I have since noticed this in other children when at friends&#39; houses -- the<br/>
kids barely even acknowledge that you&#39;re there, they can&#39;t take their eyes<br/>
off the screen, and basically seem hypnotized.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;When I was in school, I was the kid that got picked on all <br/>
&gt;the time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There seems to be a trend on this list.  That describes my experience as well.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Funny thing is I loved school, I just couldn&#39;t stand most <br/>
&gt;of the other kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Socialization aside - -  from a learning standpoint unschooling has <br/>
&gt;worked for us.  My girls know lots of stuff abouthistory and science <br/>
&gt;that I learned sometime in school but forgot right after the test.  <br/>
&gt;They won&#39;t forget because they learned by seeing it in context or <br/>
&gt;because they wanted to or because it was in something else they were <br/>
&gt;working on and it related.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ultimately, that&#39;s how we ALL learn.  Schools have forgotten this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think that our schools are so set on <br/>
&gt;everyone learning a set core of stuff that they have forgotten that <br/>
&gt;once we reach adulthood, we each need different things.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now this brings up a question.  I know in many states that homeschoolers<br/>
are required to adminster state-mandated tests tot heir own children.  How<br/>
do Unschoolers handle these requirements?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Unschooling allows the mechanics among us to focus on cars <br/>
&gt;and the astronomers to focus on the stars.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Neat rhyme, that even hit home.  I&#39;m a car nut, and have been since 10th<br/>
grade -- and became an astronomy buff at the same age.  Over twenty years<br/>
later, I have a couple of telescopes (just getting into digital<br/>
astrophotography) and a small fleet of cars (six of them) that I mess with<br/>
in the garage.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My other question relates to whether there are any Unschoolers in Virginia<br/>
on this list?  We live in Shenandoah County, Virginia.<br/>
