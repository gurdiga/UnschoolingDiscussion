 </span></blockquote>That happened to me.  I became a genuis.. LOL., nah, just kidding.. <br/>
<br/>
But &quot;something&quot; did happen to me at that age.  It was like an acute awareness <br/>
of &quot;stuff&quot;,  of life, emotions, actions and reactions.. I attributed my <br/>
&quot;awakening&quot; to the fact that my children were all finally out of the high <br/>
maintenance stage after more than 10 years of intense &quot;need&quot; for their Moma.  <br/>
  JP was about 4, potty trained, .. And the older kids were old enough to <br/>
help watch out for each other.    I thought it was a matter of getting <br/>
married young, knowing no other life but wife and mother for over 13 years.. <br/>
Then BAM!  I realized, there was a &#39;me&quot; in there, seperate from &quot;them&quot;.. <br/>
<br/>
Heck, maybe it was all that.. or maybe it was the brain-spurt.   At any rate, <br/>
I really went through a tough time for a couple of years.  But, now, I just <br/>
enjoy my new &quot;philosophical&quot; outlook on life. <br/>
