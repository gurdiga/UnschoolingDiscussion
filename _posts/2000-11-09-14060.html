this: My 8.5 yo, Tabitha, just finished her very first &quot;big book&quot;....the first 
Harry Potter which we previously read aloud.&nbsp;She has determinedly read it 
daily for weeks (months?), sometimes just two pages, sometimes a whole chapter, 
longer and longer as she got into it. She even got to the point of shutting out 
the rest of the world, sprawled on the couch, totally absorbed, while chaos 
reigned around her. Then last night I try calling her to dinner and I get no 
response. I look over and realize she&#39;s just two pages to the end. She didn&#39;t 
even hear me. I wait and in a few minutes she slams the book shut, jumps up and 
starts dancing and singing &quot;I did it, I did it!&quot; ala Tabitha&#39;s signature Happy 
Dance. We&#39;re talking total euphoria. Then she starts over to the book shelf for 
the 2nd book! I said, whoa, can we have dinner 
first?&nbsp;:)</span></font></div>

would complain that her older sister always had her nose in a book, &quot;You never 
play...all you want to do is read!&quot; but at the same time was envious at 
Cristina&#39;s obvious enjoyment with reading. So, the other day while Tabitha is 
reading, #3 daughter Linnea says, &quot;When are you going to play with me?! All you 
do anymore is read!&quot; We all had to laugh. (Tabitha did stop reading to play,

<div id="ygrps-yiv-208101406">Oh Valerie,<br/>
 That is awesome! I am so happy for you and your<br/>
daughter. And cannot wait for my son to do the same<br/>
thing.<br/>
