 </span></blockquote>No, not really.  I would not want to be misinterpreted as having suggested <br/>
that you would be putting yourself in legal danger by allowing your children <br/>
to have ice cream as and when they so desire.  You are not in a situation <br/>
that would warrant such legal advice.  You are, however (and I believe that <br/>
you know you are) unique in your situation.  And you are fortunate in your <br/>
uniqueness, and to be envied.  (And, perhaps, to be called as an expert <br/>
witness at trial??)<br/>
<br/>
Many a woman could not allow her children to choose ice cream without paying <br/>
a price (and a steep one at that) in Court . . . should it come to that.<br/>
<br/>
But, now, I fear, we are not discussing ice cream for breakfast anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Should I change the subject line?<br/>

degreed.  Indeed, &#39;twould be an oxymoron, of sorts, so far as &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
is concerned.<br/>
<br/>
Trust me.  If unschooling should ever be an issue in any case in which I <br/>
represent the pro-unschooling parent, it is to this list that I will send a <br/>
call.  Degreed or no, it is the skill and the experience I would seek.<br/>

<br/>
If we&#39;re not the only ones, we&#39;re not unique.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just unschoolers who came up with the idea of giving kids food <br/>
choices.  I read an article about it when I only had one baby, in Mothering <br/>
Magazine.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&gt; <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt; But is &quot;unschooling&quot; about &quot;mom&#39;s goals&quot; or is it about the child&#39;s <br/>
&gt; goals? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And, if it is about the child&#39;s goals, is it about how mom thinks the child <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; should achieve those goals, or is about how the child thinks the child <br/>
&gt; should <br/>
&gt; achieve those goals? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; None of the above.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So .  . . . . how is not about the child&#39;s goals?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You set up a very limited either/or, neither of which described the kernel of <br/>
unschooling as I see it.    In my expert opinion &lt;g&gt;, what distinguishes <br/>
unschooling is the learning from life, not the goals and not the projects and <br/>
not the direction.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the other 600 readers will respond, or you could just look back at <br/>
definitions of unschooling.  <br/>

court, in custody hearings. That would be a new topic. No? :o)<br/>
Remember the tag line:<br/>

your point on this. Sorry to keep asking but I feel like you are zinging <br/>
clever lines and they&#39;re whizzing past me. Since I&#39;m not normally too dense, <br/>
I&#39;d bet that they&#39;re whizzing past other people too.<br/>

significant, but it is the discarding of schoolishness -- no assignments, no <br/>
tests, no grades .<br/>
<br/>
Once these schoolish trappings are discarded, what replaces them will vary a <br/>
lot from family to family. Some families may live calm, peaceful, bucolic <br/>
country lives - spending long days in their gardens or with their animals. <br/>
Others may spend their days going to art museums and their nights going to <br/>
the theater. Others may play lots of games or watch lots of movies or ......<br/>
