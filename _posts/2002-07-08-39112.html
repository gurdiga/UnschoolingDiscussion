&gt; better off if they understood 7th grade math in greater depth and how to <br/>
&gt; apply it better.  So what is math beyond 7th grade good for?  I think it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; subconscious conspiracy.  Schools don&#39;t teach higher math because kids need <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; to know it.  The neat thing about math is that for grading and judging <br/>
&gt; young <br/>
&gt; peoples&#39; &quot;intelligence,&quot; it&#39;s very handy.  <br/>

higher math is for - occasionally that is almost admitted openly - I&#39;ve heard <br/>
teachers say, &quot;How would we know who ought to go on to higher education and <br/>
who shouldn&#39;t if they don&#39;t all have to take algebra?&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly. She&#39;s extraordinarily self-disciplined, as a matter of fact (much <br/>
more so than her mother &lt;G&gt;). And, she&#39;s not averse to doing exercises at <br/>
all. But she wants to know the purpose - feel assured that there IS a purpose <br/>
and that they are leading to what she wants.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-820125221">&lt;&lt;Even if you can do long division in your head, you may not know that it<br/>
is based on the distributive property&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am 38 years old and just figured this out.  Now I have a graduate degree<br/>
that required a fair number of math hours and I just figured this out.<br/>
<br/>
I was telling dh that I was considering going back to finish my pilot&#39;s<br/>
license (I couldn&#39;t pass the test before due to the math) because it feels<br/>
like a switch has flipped in my brain and suddenly math makes much more<br/>
sense to me.  Dh, who really likes numbers, couldn&#39;t conceive of the<br/>
possibility of not having the switch to the &quot;on&quot; position from the get-go.<br/>
