<div id="ygrps-yiv-811635796">Hi<br/>
Lynda wrote about a mom who hikes her kids to 101 different activities every<br/>
day. Then she asked:...my real question is how do folks handle young<br/>
children who see something on television or hear about a friend doing it and<br/>
do the &quot;me too&quot; routine.  Do you rush out and sign them up for ballet<br/>
because they saw a ballarina on tv?  Or sign them up for karate because they<br/>
like to watch the Karate Kid movies.  Or do you try and set up some activity<br/>
with a homeschooling group so they can &quot;play&quot; at it until they are older and<br/>
really know what it is that they want or buy them a ballarina costume so<br/>
they can play at home.  Not to say that they don&#39;t &quot;want&quot; to be a ballarina<br/>
at that moment, just that what they want is to play at it, not get serious<br/>
about it<br/>
and take lessons in a very organzied sense.<br/>
...AND, also, how much is too much. I thought it was a bit too much to haul<br/>
a 2 yo around 6 days a week (plus he has sunday school on sundays) and on<br/>
some days to 3 different activities.<br/>
<br/>
Someone once said: &quot;It is hard to be a homeschooling family if you are never<br/>
at home!&quot;<br/>
One could probably also say: &#39;&#39;It is hard to be an unschooling family if you<br/>
are always taking classes?&#39;&#39;<br/>
Where I live there is a very strong pressure for kids to be doing all sorts<br/>
of &#39;&#39;enrichment&#39;&#39; stuff - to the extent that you can find yourself being<br/>
frowned upon as somewhat neglectful if your kids aren&#39;t. Seems crazy to me -<br/>
I know kids who are at school from 7h30 till 13h30, then rush off to pack in<br/>
2 or 3 activites in the afternoon, after which they rush home to do homework<br/>
and tumble into bed so that they can do the same thing the other days of the<br/>
week. Where is the time to just be a child? And/or to learn about life?  I&#39;m<br/>
not even touching on the real learning that we are discovering in<br/>
unschooling!!!<br/>
Anyway, years ago we thrashed out a &#39;&#39;policy&#39;&#39; that works for our family,<br/>
and means that everyone has something and their mom isn&#39;t going crazy trying<br/>
to keep up with the taxi service!<br/>
Basically, everyone may (not must) select 1 or 2 activites (not more) for<br/>
the year. In November we/they begin to reflect and plan what they will be.<br/>
The first month of the new year is spent selecting these activities (trying<br/>
out various things they are interested in). Then they make our choices,<br/>
settle down and get on with it. We spend a lot of time chatting during this<br/>
period; it has become a valuable time in our family of self-discovery and<br/>
discovering each other. We also pray - God made each one unique, and with<br/>
special giftings, passions and interests. Discovering these is like opening<br/>
presents at Christmas; an exciting and special experience. The challenge is<br/>
in stilling the outside noise (other people&#39;s opinions, outside pressures<br/>
etc) enough to hear from God and from the person inside what these giftings,<br/>
passions and interests are - what makes you tick. Who are you and what<br/>
should you be doing right now to develop and/or express that uniqueness?<br/>
(This by the way is THE key attraction of unschooling for me - it stills the<br/>
noise and makes it easier to hear...)<br/>
So, I have one daughter who has a passion for dance; seems to have been born<br/>
with it. For her the choices are easy; she continues with Ballet and adds<br/>
Irish dance for this year. (For the past 3 years it has been Spanish dance).<br/>
Very structured, very disciplined, but right for her.<br/>
On the other hand, our son, who last year experienced all the pressures of<br/>
his friends playing cricket, soccer, rugby etc, and who really felt he<br/>
needed to do likewise, has found his heart - it is so exciting. He has<br/>
discovered his passion for science. So now he doesn&#39;t want to do a so-called<br/>
extramural; he has asked for an equivalent allowance to spend at the Science<br/>
shop, and has got into rocketry and electronics.<br/>
With regard to the &#39;not more than 2&#39; limit, I have explained why to the<br/>
kids - I am concerned that there won&#39;t be enough time for them to do other<br/>
important things, that they will become pressurised and stressed, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
quite fit in with this still new unschooling lifestyle we are pursuing,<br/>
also, there<br/>
is a limit to how much driving one mom (with a 6month old baby) can do in a<br/>
week, and that there is not enough money available in the budget for more.<br/>
However, if someone really feels strongly about doing an additional<br/>
&#39;extramural&#39;, let&#39;s talk. Maybe we can find a way of circumventing the<br/>
problems. Especially with regard to the older children, I have suggested<br/>
that there may be ways of earning the money to pay for another activity if<br/>
they really want it. So far they have been happy with the 2 activity quota,<br/>
and agree with the reasons - I know because I have heard them explaining<br/>
them to their friends!!<br/>
Regards<br/>
