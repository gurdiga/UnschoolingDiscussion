In this country,  it would be impossible for her kids not to pick up <br/>
English - television, radio, shopping, etc.  I don&#39;t see this as an <br/>
obstacle,  but as an advantage.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-608624387">I think the children would probably be bilingual?  How wonderful and lucky for them.  A definite plus I think.<br/>
And, anywhere they go (grocery, library, ect....)  everyone will be speaking english.  I live in the south, and you should hear some of the accents!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Id say she has an advantage that the rest of wish we had.  Why cant she use <br/>
her native toungue to teach?  I know tht in my area anyone who is bilingual <br/>
can make twice as much money, and she can speak English the rest of the <br/>
time-- rae</div>

    Your friend still has her children&#39;s best interest in mind. She should go <br/>
for it!! Even if they do pick up and accent, they will still get the best <br/>
care and education available to them, and that is so much more important! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I was 8 years old I met a new best friend in my neighborhood.  She had<br/>
just moved from Russia with her parents.  She moved in the summer to a<br/>
house a few blocks away from mine and neither she nor her parents spoke a<br/>
word of english.  By the time that the summer was over she was speaking<br/>
almost fluent English (from t.v., books, other medias and friends and<br/>
neighbors) and was ready to start in the PS system, AND was teaching her<br/>
parents.  How is that for picking up english despite the fact that Russian<br/>
was the only language spoken in the home?  I even learned to speak some<br/>
Russian that summer!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199172469">Sure check out the law but when the law is a loud braying onager (aka ass) one<br/>
should take it with a grain of salt.  If there aren&#39;t crazed family members<br/>
fighting you every step of the way, most people leave  you alone.  Most people do<br/>
not come to the attention of the &quot;authorities&quot;.  The education system, in many<br/>
places is self destructing because of many inherent idiocies.  In most places<br/>
they don&#39;t have the resources to go looking for trouble. IMO.<br/>

I would think she would do a terrific job.  Watch out though -- she might end <br/>
up with bilingual kids!!! :):)<br/>
