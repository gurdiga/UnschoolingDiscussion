<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282146099">I rented &quot;Camelot&quot; and was looking up some of the actors.   The guy who <br/>
played Mordred was unfamiliar to me and I was surprised to see how many films he <br/>
was in.   He died in 2003, while working on a film, but I thought some of the <br/>
obituary material was pretty interesting!      Look him up at IMBD to see what <br/>
movies he was in, and I&#39;ve lifted a bit from the obituary that was here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/12/05/db0501.xml&">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/12/05/db0501.xml&</a><br/>
sSheet=/portal/2003/12/05/ixportal.html<br/>
<br/>
He was a musical and artistic prodigy, so this all didn&#39;t happen *because* he <br/>
quit going to school, but it&#39;s just one more example of someone for whom <br/>
school would NOT have been a benefit, considering all he learned and accomplished <br/>
without it.   <br/>
<br/>
-------------------------<br/>
<br/>
David Leslie Edward Hemmings was born at Guildford on November 18 1941. <br/>
Although he was sent to Glyn College, Epsom, Hemmings later remarked: &quot;You can <br/>
count the days I went to school after the age of eight on your hands and feet. I <br/>
don&#39;t regret it.&quot; David&#39;s father had been a dance band pianist and encouraged <br/>
his son to sing.<br/>
<br/>
 Hemmings was nine when he first sang for Benjamin Britten. For three years <br/>
he toured in The Turn Of The Screw, until his voice finally broke during a high <br/>
aria on stage at the Champs Elysee Theatre in Paris. His understudy had been <br/>
waiting, in full costume, throughout these three years, and was brought on <br/>
after a brief interlude; alas, his voice broke three days later.<br/>
<br/>
 At 12 Hemmings had begun acting in films. He left home at 14, had his own <br/>
flat in London the next year and, by the time he made Blow-Up, he had 48 (mostly <br/>
forgettable) films under his belt - including Otto Preminger&#39;s St Joan <br/>
(1957). He was one of the original residents of Swinging London. &quot;John Lennon gave <br/>
me my first joint,&quot; he recalled.<br/>
<br/>
 At the end of the 1960s he left London for a holiday in the Seychelles and <br/>
ended up working in Australia and New Zealand, making more than 20 films.<br/>
<br/>
================    Interesting life of someone I&#39;d never heard of before.   <br/>

<br/>
Two more paragraphs from that bio:<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
A talented watercolourist, in recent years Hemmings had also devoted much <br/>
energy to exhibitions of his paintings. Selling a picture, he said, gave him <br/>
greater pleasure than acting. He was also a member of the International <br/>
Brotherhood of Magicians and the Magic Circle; in restaurants he delighted in making the <br/>
salt disappear. The enduring popularity of Blow-Up allowed Hemmings the <br/>
opportunity regularly to address students of film at universities across <br/>
Britain.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to go and rent Blow-Up.   But I brought this here because Kelly has <br/>
an interest in magic and magicians.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 -=-Aged 19, he married his first wife Genista (Jenny), but the relationship <br/>
was over by the time he met the American actress Gayle Hunnicutt in the late <br/>
1960s. Their first encounter was in Los Angeles, where Hemmings was publicising <br/>
Blow-Up. They married in 1968.<br/>
<br/>
-=- &quot;We were the poor man&#39;s Taylor and Burton,&quot; Hemmings recalled. At the <br/>
wedding, a swimming pool was filled with doves dipped in puce dye, the Mamas and <br/>
the Papas sang and Henry Mancini conducted the orchestra.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Holly has just this week discovered The Mamas and the Papas.   I played her <br/>
some things from albums, got her a CD this morning, and read this in the <br/>
afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Connections just keep on and keep on!!<br/>
