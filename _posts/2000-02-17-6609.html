<div id="ygrps-yiv-587304776">Does anyone live in or near Denver and have recommendations for kids&#39;<br/>
activities in or near the city? We are planning on accompanying my husband<br/>
next week on his business trip to Denver; we will driving there (ie:<br/>
cross-country geography field trip!), and will be in Denver for a week. I<br/>
would appreciate any helpful tips from anyone who has visited there or<br/>
knows the area.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382504262">we live about 300 miles away and have a daughter that lives in Denver,<br/>
the Denver Zoo and the Denver Mint are wonderful, I am not sure if you<br/>
still have to call and make an appointment at the mint, but they will<br/>
give you a tour and show you how money is minted, it is very interesting.<br/>
There is also several museums, but I am not sure of the names.<br/>
