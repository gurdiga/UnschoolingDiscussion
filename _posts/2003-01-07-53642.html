<div id="ygrps-yiv-12638594">&lt;&lt;I think I&#39;d like to move to Washington or Oregon for a year or two just<br/>
to see if I could reverse my weather depression and learn to appreciate sun&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard it has to do with atmospheric pressure, and is constant with each <br/>
person, but most people like the dry sunny over the cooling-darker days.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; It&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; depressing too, to shield yourself inside and away from the sun day after<br/>
 </span></blockquote>day<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; with heavy blinds and drapes--sheers cut a lot of the glare for me--but I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t care for the look. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s something kind of cool about our current house.   The den doesn&#39;t have <br/>
an outside wall.  On the north side a bedroom (now my office) was built in <br/>
(of what used to be a big 70&#39;s rec-room), and on the south there&#39;s a big <br/>
window in the original outside wall, but it opens into a large enclosed <br/>
former patio/porch thing.   To the east, wall with fireplace (dirt and garage <br/>
on the other side), and to the west, bathroom and wall (and hallway to Marty, <br/>
washing machine and sewing room.<br/>
<br/>
It is PERFECT for me.  NO direct sunlight, EVER.<br/>
<br/>
I can see the outside north or south, but I don&#39;t have to GO there.<br/>
<br/>
In the kitchen I don&#39;t have curtains.  A big window has a climbing viney <br/>
thing growing over it (I&#39;m growing a curtain) on the black netting for <br/>
keeping birds out of fruit trees.   In the smaller window over the sink, <br/>
there&#39;s a crystal we got as a wedding gift.  It makes rainbows.   For a while <br/>
each day, there are rainbows projected on the shadow of the vine from the <br/>
other window.  It&#39;s awesome, two window-shows in the same place.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes! I think I&#39;d like to move to Washington or Oregon for a year or two just<br/>
to see if I could reverse my weather depression and learn to appreciate sun<br/>
again. I also LOVE the monsoon season and winter is my favorite season here.<br/>
I&#39;m lovin&#39; it right now. :-)<br/>
