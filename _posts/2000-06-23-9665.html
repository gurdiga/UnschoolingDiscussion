<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi All, was reading your posts on friends fading 
away after the decision to home/unschool...or growing families...I just haven&#39;t 
had anything like that happen.&nbsp; Almost all of my friends are traditional 
public schoolers, and we still get along great..I&#39;ll be honest, at first it was 
as if some of them felt like because I&nbsp;was home/unschooling for my family 
that somehow, I felt that their decisions were not good, but that just was not 
the case, and so we got over it....but I could feel that initial defense, from 
friends, but as they realized that I was still the same non-judgemental person i 
have always been, and that I respect that everyone makes the choices that are 
best for them and their family, just as I expect they respect mine.&nbsp; Now I 
kind of jokingly, as I consider just about every outing a home/unschooling 
experience, when we are doing things together, I say&quot;&nbsp; hey this is 
homeschooling experience&quot; because my opinion lies in the fact that we are all 
learning from our environments, and off school time , is just as valuable 
.......and we all smile, cause&nbsp; inside, they too are enjoying their time 
with their children, and if I define it as &quot;home/unschooling&quot; that &#39;s fine with 
them, cause they would like to get ina&nbsp; little home/unschooling themselves, 
and this makes them feel included, rather than excluded.&nbsp; But I have had 
long time friendships fade over time, not for schooling reasons, but for other 
reasons, and I see this sort as a natural flow of things, when something has 
given , and received all it can from one source it moves on, 
sometimes......things are merely shifting.&nbsp; But it&#39;s the friends I&#39;ve had , 
well the one friend, I&#39;ve had for 10 + years that lets me know, that some 
friendships last forever, and this is a huge comfort when a another friendship 
is dwindling.&nbsp; well it&#39;s a huge comfort, at all times.&nbsp; I find that a 
couple real good friends is all I really need.&nbsp; Just my 5 
cents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Blessings, 
Michelle</font></div></span></blockquote></html>
