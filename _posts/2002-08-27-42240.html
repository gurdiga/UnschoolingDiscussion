&gt;&gt;&gt; But I am going to make her live up to the commitment. Attendance will be<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; my sticking point.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why? Why make her give a commitment at all? Why not think of this as just<br/>
&gt; another unschooling experience? If she decides she doesn&#39;t like it, finds it<br/>
&gt; boring, hates the tacky social scene, why make her stick it out? Wouldn&#39;t it<br/>
&gt; be so much sweeter to just let her learn those lessons and return back home?<br/>
&gt; After all, wouldn&#39;t that be the better outcome anyway?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Life is good.<br/>
