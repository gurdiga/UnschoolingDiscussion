<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175970940">My house is a mess most of the time, which I wouldn&#39;t really care about, <br/>
except it seems we lose stuff in the mess, and then other stuff becomes <br/>
useless.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, we have lost chess pieces, some playing cards, Mancala pieces, <br/>
parts of Transformers, crucial cards in a board game, dice, etc. Games seem <br/>
to be particular victims of this syndrome. All you have to lose is one or <br/>
two things out of a game and it becomes a lot less fun, if not impossible, <br/>
to play. The pieces get scattered around then the games are no good. This is <br/>
the downside of a messy house as far as I&#39;m concerned. (We also lose bigger <br/>
things like books, reading glasses, remote controls and toys, but at least <br/>
they seem to show up eventually.)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps other people are better than I am at getting their kids to put away <br/>
their games when they decide to do something else (&quot;when they are finished <br/>
with them&quot; would be misleading, since they&#39;re always quitting halfway <br/>
through and running off without a glance backward). You would think that <br/>
after having puzzles, games, models and other items with small pieces <br/>
rendered unusable because parts had been lost, that they&#39;d be more <br/>
conscientious, but nooooo. They don&#39;t waste much time regretting that their <br/>
games and puzzles are ruined, but I&#39;m sorry about it because I think those <br/>
things offer valuable learning experiences (plus they cost money, after <br/>
all).<br/>
<br/>
My boys are 8 and 4.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I have been on this list for a long time, and reading <br/>
everything, but lurking a lot lately.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Annette,<br/>
<br/>
I have two boys too, a bit younger than yours.  Several things are possible even in a messy house.<br/>
<br/>
1)  If you know they do not take care of such things, limit the amount of toys and games and puzzles they may have that have parts to get lost.  If they cannot take care of things that are &quot;age appropriate&quot;  I would simply tell them, &quot;No, you may not have another set of train tracks, since you are apparently too young to care for them properly.  We will try again when you are older and more responsible, or can pay for them yourself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
2)  In my house, if they leave a big mess and will not clean it up, I get to keep the toy(s) for at least a day, or more.  You don&#39;t care for it, you lose it.<br/>
<br/>
3)  If they break, destroy, lose and otherwise make useless a toy, I am not buying another one.  Again, if you do not care for it, you lose it.  It is not a necessity for life, and you will not die if you do not have a full set of transformers or a Monopoly game.<br/>
<br/>
As for remotes, glasses, etc.  There are ways to keep track of those without becoming a master of organization.  Have the glasses wearer don some of those holders that you wear around your neck.  If they are reading glasses and not used constantly, have a dish/drawer/shelf where they go and get into the habit of putting them there whenever they are not in use.  <br/>
<br/>
The same advice works for remotes.  We have one for the stereo, one for the VCR and one for the tv, and they all were getting lost constantly.  Then I got hold of a paperboard container for them and stuck it in the entertainment center.  They always go there when they are not in someone&#39;s hand.  No more remote searches in our house.  Simple.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if it is a constant mess and they are always losing things and making them useless, it would stand to reason that they should run out of things to lose sooner or later.  Let them.  Don&#39;t replace them.  If they complain that they do not have this or that, I would say &quot;Yes, I noticed that too, I have not been stepping on them.  It has been so nice&quot;  or something to that effect.  Simplify, and get rid of the stuff that no one seems to want to care for.  You really do not need a thousand tools and doodads for kids to learn from.<br/>

<br>
<br>Yep -- my kids are 7 and 6. &nbsp;It&#39;s not an easy thing to stay focussed after 
<br>the fun of the game is over or when the next thing beckons.
<br>
<br>For a while, I had things put UP -- out of reach -- so they couldn&#39;t get the 
<br>next thing down until the 1st thing was at least crammed back into its box.
<br>
<br>Some art supplies are still that way -- like paint.
<br>
<br>I do notice that the things that my son has paid for out of birthday $$ seem 
<br>to get a little more care -- the Gameboy games get put in the drawer.
<br>
<br>Also, the boxes that things come in are sometimes useless. &nbsp;After the first 
<br>few times, many things end up in zip-loc bags here. &nbsp;Chess pieces, etc. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Also, things are done here in the middle of the living room floor. &nbsp;I know -- 
<br>it&#39;s not real Martha Stewart. &nbsp;But, if you want to do the Monopoly game first 
<br>you HAVE to pick up the puzzle -- there is no choice.
<br>
<br>But I do end up doing a lot of the picking up, I admit. &nbsp;They help a certain 
<br>amount but I usually finish. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Good luck.

only to find most of the games had been emptied on the floor in there. They <br/>
spent several hours sorting pieces. We may need a parts drawer in the new <br/>
house.<br/>

Hi Annette,<br/>
<br/>
This is when I will stop buying alot of these things that the pieces get <br/>
lost.  After the games are missed for a little bit, and they begin to ask for <br/>
new ones... I would tell my daughter, OK, but we have to remember to keep all <br/>
the pieces together... otherwise we won&#39;t be able to use it.  For me, this <br/>
saves money and teaches her responsibility.  It seems to work for us.  <br/>
Actually, we don&#39;t have many of these games right now with alot of pieces <br/>
(because they kept getting lost). I really want her to know that she/I can&#39;t <br/>
just keep replacing all the games just because someone didn&#39;t feel like <br/>
putting the pieces back again.  That&#39;s just a waste.<br/>
<br/>
BTW- Thanks to everyone who responded back to my introduction.  It seems <br/>
there is such a wide diversity in this group, concerning choices made in <br/>
life, religions, beliefs, thoughts.... but one thing is clear- we all want <br/>
autonomy from conformity for ourselves and our children, and to give our kids <br/>
the best they could possibly have.<br/>

My husband is a children&#39;s therapist, and at his former job he had an office<br/>
full of toys and puzzles and games with small pieces and a play therapy bag<br/>
filled with the same that he took to clients&#39; homes. It always seemed as if<br/>
he was losing a piece. He would go to Toys R Us every once in a while to<br/>
pick up a package filled with game pieces, dice, etc. It only cost him a<br/>
dollar or two. I don&#39;t know if that would help you replace your missing<br/>
games pieces, but it certainly did with my dh.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had some luck replacing my dd&#39;s missing puzzle pieces by contacting the<br/>
place I purchased it at and asking for a replacement. She had a wooden peg<br/>
puzzle that we bought her from The Playstore and somehow we lost a piece.<br/>
When I asked about a replacement, they said the manufacturer would send a<br/>
replacement for free. I know that Discovery Toys will also replace missing<br/>
or broken pieces.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-420335448">We use a lot of ziploc bags for keeping game pieces and puzzles organized<br/>
within the box. Generally after the kids play with something, we pick it up<br/>
(unless it&#39;s an ongoing project or game of some sort). I think the key<br/>
though (as with any discipline) is modeling and repetition. So when we&#39;re<br/>
done with breakfast dishes, the kids bring their dishes to the sink and then<br/>
they know that I&#39;m not available for play or anything else until I&#39;ve picked<br/>
up everything from making breakfast. When the kitchen is nice and clean, I&#39;m<br/>
available to do activities with them again. Same with everything we do - if<br/>
we take a bath, we don&#39;t move on until the towels are picked up and the tub<br/>
mopped up, if I get my photos and albums out, I don&#39;t do anything else until<br/>
I&#39;ve picked them up. Of course, with very young kids as I have, I have to be<br/>
flexible with this - if a crisis comes up, I have to stop what I&#39;m doing and<br/>
take care of things. But then before I go on to a different activity I pick<br/>
up after myself. I can&#39;t ask anything of the kids that I can&#39;t do myself.<br/>
And also of course the repetition - I often have to state things many times<br/>
(&quot;we need to pick up this game before we go to the park&quot;), and for us at<br/>
this age I help them out almost always or turn it into a game or come up<br/>
with a song. &quot;Many hands make happy work&quot; is our mantra :-)<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple areas of the house that are &quot;messy zones&quot; - our misc.<br/>
craft drawer, the kids bedroom (most of the time :-) - and those we just<br/>
don&#39;t worry about. Shut the door and voila, they&#39;re clean :-)<br/>
