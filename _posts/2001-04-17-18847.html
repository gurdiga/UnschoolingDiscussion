An &quot;Ignorant&quot; Man<br/>
by John Holt<br/>
Growing Without Schooling Issue #7<br/>
www.gwsholt.com<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s take a look at one of those &quot;ignorant&quot; men that Conan Doyle was<br/>
worried about.  In his book Travels Through America, first published in<br/>
Esquire Magazine, Feb 76, Harrison Salisbury described his efforts to trace<br/>
the Westward path of some of his ancestors. He describes one of them thus:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;. He (Hiram Salisbury) was a man of his time (1815). I scan the journal for<br/>
clues and reconstruct the post-Revolutionary American. I list his skills,<br/>
one sheet of scratch paper after another.  He knew every farm chore.  He<br/>
milked cows and attended the calves in birth.  He physicked his horse.  He<br/>
plowed, he planted, he cultivated, hayed, picked apples, grafted fruit<br/>
trees, cut wheat with a scythe, cradled oats, threshed grain with a flail on<br/>
a clay floor. He chopped the corn and put down his vegetables for winter.<br/>
He made cider and built cider mills. He made cheese and fashioned cheese<br/>
tongs. He butchered the hogs and sheared the sheep.  He churned butter and<br/>
salted it. He made soap and candles, thatched barns and built smokehouses.<br/>
He butchered oxen and constructed ox sledges. He fought forest fires and<br/>
marked out the land. He repaired the crane at Smith&#39;s mill and forged a<br/>
crane for his own fireplace to hang the kettle on. He collected iron in the<br/>
countryside and smelted it. He tapped (mended) his children&#39;s shoes and his<br/>
own. He built trundle beds, oxcarts, sleighs, and wagons, wagon wheels and<br/>
wheel spokes. He turned logs into boards and cut locust wood for picket<br/>
fences. He made house frames, beams, mortised and pegged. With six men&#39;s<br/>
help he raised the frames and built the houses. He made a neat cherry stand<br/>
with a drawer for a cousin, fixed clocks and went fishing.  He carved his<br/>
own board measures (yardsticks) and sold them for a dollar apiece. He fitted<br/>
window cases, mended locks, and fixed compasses. He hewed timber, surveyed<br/>
the forest, wrote deeds and shave shingles.  He inspected the town records<br/>
and audited the books of the Friendship Lodge, the oldest freshwater Masonic<br/>
lodge in the country (still running).  He chipped plows, constructed carding<br/>
machines, carved gunstocks and built looms.  He set gravestones and<br/>
fashioned wagon hubs.  He ran a bookstore and could make a fine coffin in<br/>
half a day.  He was a member of the state&#39;s General Assembly, overseer of<br/>
the poor, appraiser of property and fellow of the town council.  He made<br/>
hoops by the thousands and also pewter faucets.  For many years he collected<br/>
the town taxes.<br/>
<br/>
I have not listed all of Hiram&#39;s skills but enough.  I do not think he was<br/>
an unusual man. Put me in Hiram&#39;s wold and I would not last long.  Put Hiram<br/>
down in our world, He might have a little trouble with a computer, but he&#39;d<br/>
get the hang of it faster than I could cradle a bushel of oats.<br/>
<br/>
    ******<br/>
John Holt  - I tend to agree with Harrison Salisbury that Hiram, though<br/>
perhaps not an unusual man in his time, would be a most unusual one in ours,<br/>
for more knowing, skillful, intelligent, resourceful, adaptive, inventive,<br/>
and competent than most people we could find today, in either city or<br/>
country, and no matter how schooled.<br/>
<br/>
But the real question that I want to raise, and answer, is how Hiram learned<br/>
all those skills. To be sure, he did not learn them in school. Nor did he<br/>
learn them in workshops or any other school-like activity.  Almost<br/>
certainly, he learned how to do all those kinds of work, many of them highly<br/>
skilled, by being around when other people were doing them.  Nor were these<br/>
other people doing the work in order to teach Hiram something. Nobody raised<br/>
a barn just so that Hiram could see how barns were raised. They raised it<br/>
because they need the barn. Nor did they say to him, &quot;Hiram as long as I<br/>
have to raise this barn, you may as well come around and learn how it is<br/>
done.  &quot;&quot;They said, &quot;Hiram, I&#39;m raising a barn and I need your help&quot;.  He<br/>
was there to help, not to learn --but as he helped, he learned.<br/>
<br/>
Almost a century later John Dewey was to talk about &quot;learning by doing.&quot;<br/>
The way for students to learn (for example) how pottery is made is not read<br/>
about it in a book but to make pots.  Well, OK, no doubt about its being<br/>
better. But making pots just to learn to how it is done still doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
to me anywhere near as good as making pots (and learning from it) because<br/>
someone needs the pots.  The incentive to learn how to do good work, and to<br/>
do it, is surely much greater when you know that the work has to be done,<br/>
that it is going to be of real use to someone.<br/>

Poetic License<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.poeticlicense.org/">http://www.poeticlicense.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
Carol had this to say about the review copy of the Poetic License video:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When I sat down to watch, I didn&#39;t imagine I would witness<br/>
such a powerful, heart-rending portrayal of kids reading their own<br/>
words at poetry slams across the country. I was moved to tears and<br/>
had to turn it off to catch my breath several times. The raw emotions<br/>
and deeply insightful poetry of dozens teens from diverse communities<br/>
simply overwhelmed me. The sight of these kids taking over the<br/>
National Poetry Competition and refusing to compete under time<br/>
limits, instead supporting each other and cheering for each other so<br/>
everybody won, still brings tears to my eyes. This is a film about<br/>
some incredibly talented and caring young people (one of them a<br/>
homeschooler Megan Cohen)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Produced and directed by David Yanofsky, Poetic License showcases the<br/>
vibrant and compelling voices of American youth.   Along with the video<br/>
there will be future curriculum materials with a study guide, a 150-page<br/>
teacher&#39;s guide (to be published by Heinemann Press in fall 2001), and a<br/>
website where teachers and teens can share their work and passion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
April is National Poetry month and PBS will be airing the video across the<br/>
nation, please check the website for times in your area.<br/>

Your children are not your children.<br/>
They are the sons and daughters of Life&#39;s longing for itself.<br/>
They come through you but not from you,<br/>
And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.<br/>
You may give them your love but not your thoughts.<br/>
For they have their own thoughts.<br/>
You may house their bodies but not their souls,<br/>
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,<br/>
which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.<br/>
You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.<br/>
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.<br/>
You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.<br/>
The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you<br/>
with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.<br/>
Let your bending in the archer&#39;s hand be for gladness;<br/>
For even as he loves the arrow that flies,<br/>
so He loves also the bow that is stable.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
While looking for a few math/logic websites I ran into an old favorite.<br/>
Set, the card game, is great fun despite being good for the brain.  The<br/>
website turned out to be very cool.  Each day they lay out 9 cards and you<br/>
make the sets online.  Once you find all the sets the computer records them<br/>
and your time and then enters you into a drawing for a deck of Five Crowns<br/>
(another wonderful card game) They lay out the cards so there are 6<br/>
different sets on the screen.  It&#39;s HARD!  Especially if you are used to<br/>
yelling &quot;set&quot; and raking up the cards, thus shifting the visual aspect. Here<br/>
the 9 cards stay put.  So, if you&#39;re looking for 10 minutes or so of logic<br/>
every day, bookmark this page.  Just don&#39;t tell the kids, they&#39;ll probably<br/>
beat you!<br/>
<br/>
You can also download a Shareware version of the game for the computer.  I<br/>
showed much restraint and did not add this to my collection of games. If I<br/>
had, I would not have finished this newsletter!<br/>

<br/>
OWL stands for Online Writing Lab, and while this is not the most visually<br/>
appealing site, it is very useful to those interested  in writing.  There<br/>
are Hypertext and Powerpoint slide shows for those of us who are visual<br/>
learners.  The information is sometimes very basic, but still worthwhile.<br/>
There are sections for spelling, punctuation, creating bibliographies.  If<br/>
English is not your first language, there is section just for you. One of<br/>
the most useful aspects of the site is their link page to other online<br/>
writing labs and resources.<br/>

On Unschooling and Life<br/>
Ruthe Matilsky<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For years I&#39;ve smugly parroted the unschooling party line: &quot;Provide your<br/>
children with a stimulating environment, and they will learn what they need<br/>
to know to get on in life,&quot; and outside of homeschooling circles I&#39;ve<br/>
refused to admit that I have a care in the world. However, I&#39;m uncomfortably<br/>
aware that I&#39;m nervous.<br/>
<br/>
Being a homeschooling parent has meant being &quot;different.&quot; There has been no<br/>
formula for us to follow and no prescribed set of goals and achievements to<br/>
mark the way. While I do it because it feels right, there are times when I<br/>
envy the parents who unquestioningly accept the School Education Plan. How<br/>
nice it must be to adhere to the Program and march right along, complaining<br/>
sometimes, but basically feeling secure that following someone else&#39;s script<br/>
is the right thing to do. How reassuring to have someone else lay out the<br/>
rules - car pool her to preschool, be a first grade class mother, help her<br/>
with her homework, join the P. T. A., sign up for Operation Graduation and<br/>
drive her to college, and your child will be a success. How unsettling it is<br/>
sometimes when I think that we have scoffed at the script and now we have to<br/>
take responsibility for how it all turns out. If we&#39;d done what was expected<br/>
of us, nothing would ever be our fault. Right?<br/>
<br/>
Of course my husband and I don&#39;t believe that, but I can&#39;t help worrying.<br/>
The standard good-parent line is, &quot;All I want is for my child to be happy.&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s easy to say when the kids are little, but what about a<br/>
twenty-one-year-old daughter who is not on the college track? When I was her<br/>
age I didn&#39;t even know anyone who wasn&#39;t college track. I realize that if<br/>
she had started some business and was making a hundred grand a year I&#39;d be<br/>
basking in my know-it-all-homeschooling-mother smugness and who&#39;d care about<br/>
college. The fact that she&#39;s not completely supporting herself at twenty-one<br/>
is not so unusual, but I worry. Will she ever find enjoyable work that will<br/>
make her economically independent? What if she can&#39;t make enough money to be<br/>
happy? What if a childhood of following her rhythms leads my daughter to a<br/>
lifetime of dissatisfaction with boring jobs? What if she just settles into<br/>
being a housewife out of default?<br/>

Logical Contradictions<br/>
<br/>
  A &#39;power outage&#39; occurred last night during the time I was working on this<br/>
newsletter.  While reading a magazine by candle light, I contemplated how<br/>
utterly ridiculous it was for me to be the editor of anything, given that I<br/>
cannot spell well nor use commas correctly.  Then I ran accross this by Ann<br/>
Kreilkamp:<br/>
<br/>
Back in 1966, when I was a first year graduate student in philosophy, I took<br/>
a course in something called &quot;Formal Logic.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was 23 years old, a &quot;good girl,&quot; outwardly following the rules of society.<br/>
Inwardly, however I was beginning to hold the system at arm&#39;s length.  The<br/>
rules of logic bored me.  They felt arbitrary and suffocating.  Not that I<br/>
was aware of this feeling.  The &quot;proof&quot; of it came during class one day when<br/>
all of a sudden I no longer could sit silently, squirming.  I raised my<br/>
hand.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with contradiction?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(The rules of logic are one long continuous avoidance of contradiction.)<br/>
<br/>
The teacher&#39;s mouth fell open, and he just stood there staring at me. Time<br/>
slowed down.  I watched his face turn beet red.  Finally, he sputtered,<br/>
fuming: &quot;From a contradiction anything follows, ANYTHING!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And there you have it. Unschooling, along with my title of editor, is a<br/>
&#39;logical contradiction&#39; where anything and everything can follow!!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoyed this month&#39;s newsletter.  See you in MidMay!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-230133772">I haven&#39;t read every single post on bullying which has recently been <br/>
written, so I apologize if this is redundant.<br/>
<br/>
There was a story on the CNN website today, entitled:<br/>
<br/>
U.S. Study Finds Bullying Common in Schools<br/>
<br/>
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, <br/>
conducted research on 16,686 students in public and private <br/>
