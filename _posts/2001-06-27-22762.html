scary! I have a dd 7 and a ds 5, and if this is true, I like many of you face <br/>

have seen what not getting vaccines can do, and have and firmly believe in <br/>
giving children vaccines (but understand and respect those who choose not to <br/>
do so, although I really don&#39;t agree.) But this sounds totally different! <br/>
Would we be subject to prosecution? Those with Tuberculosis, who refuse to <br/>
take their medication, can be and are prosecuted and put into custody at a <br/>
hospital, in an isolation room until they comply with their med. regime! <br/>
Would they do this to those of us who would choose not to take the risk of an <br/>
AIDS vaccine? How very scary!!! Although this sounds like something radical <br/>
and possibly just another one of those things people send around, it very <br/>
well may be something we need to keep in the back of our minds as a little <br/>
red light! I am definitely interested in hearing others opinions on this <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865827">Several vaccines have been tested over the last 20 years where no informed<br/>
consent has been given.  Hep B and Hep A are two.  There are clinics in the<br/>
U.S. and U.S. supported clinics worldwide that are used to do the testing.<br/>
They don&#39;t inform, they just test.<br/>
