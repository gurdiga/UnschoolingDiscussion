 </span></blockquote>Hi Ren!  It is going great!  I was shocked to see all the postings <br/>
here over the weekend...I guess this gets used way more than <br/>
unschooling.com!!    I&#39;m not sure if I can keep up!  LOL!  It was <br/>
really great to meet you and hopefully we can meet up this summer <br/>
when you and Heidi go on your big adventure I have been hearing <br/>
about!!  <br/>
