[ If you have a problem with the content of the<br/>
 magazine you must just be one of her unthinking<br/>
 followers, so who needs you.  You are too dumb <br/>
 and brainwashed by her to see that the rest of us<br/>
 are  better Unschoolers anyway.]<br/>

I received the same reply back from Helen and wrote<br/>
back to her basically saying the same thing that you<br/>
wrote (above) and her response to me saying that I was<br/>
offended by her &quot;followers&quot; statement was &quot;most people<br/>
are&quot;.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I&#39;m glad that these Yahoo groups exist and<br/>
that there are other &#39;zines out there for unschoolers.<br/>

*I*&#39;m not! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m a Doddite! A Doddhead. A Sandranista! &lt;G&gt; And proud of it. <br/>
 <br/>
Of course, Sandra HATES that! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
So, get screwed, Helen!<br/>
