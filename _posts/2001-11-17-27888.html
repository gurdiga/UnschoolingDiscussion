&gt; Telling people (or implying) that their medical problems<br/>
&gt; are all caused by control issues is not helpful.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It can be, if their medical problems ARE all caused by control issues and<br/>
the person in question is ready to hear that.<br/>
<br/>
It can be like intervention for a drug abuser, or the phone number of a<br/>
woman&#39;s shelter at the right time to a battered wife.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, sometimes advice can be wrong, and sometimes even the right advice is<br/>
at the wrong time, but does that mean we stop throwing the possibilities out<br/>
there?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately,  it&#39;s not that simple......who ONLY eats at home?  Many<br/>
&gt; &gt; restaurants use peanut oil,  which is often enough to cause a reaction.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Some even react simply to have the aroma of peanuts in the air.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Won&#39;t the child be with parents at restaurants until time to be able to<br/>
&gt; read/ask/decide what to order that&#39;s safe?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually,  I&#39;m using a basically hypothetical example here to discuss the<br/>
*issue*.  My child does have medically necessary dietary restrictions.  And,<br/>
for our family,  our daughter is only &#39;out&#39; with appropraite adult<br/>
supervision...ours or friends.  We have found that some &quot;friends&quot; (using the<br/>
term loosely here) are quite willing to lie about food our daughter has<br/>
ingested...and or feel that they are treating her by offering things she<br/>
likes,  but is not supposed to eat.  She&#39;s almost 7 now.....we want her to<br/>
enjoy outings with friends....it&#39;s a challenge at times when the friend&#39;s<br/>
parents may not be reliable.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I begin to control what my children eat, and totally reverse my advice<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; other families who are having regular food-control issues in the absence<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; death-threatening allergies, that won&#39;t make allergic kids any more or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>less<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; safe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do we all control because some families don&#39;t want to consider loosening<br/>
 </span></blockquote>up?<br/>
<br/>
A local preschool in our area became a &quot;no-nut&quot; zone this year to protect<br/>
two students with nut allergies.  It was a big deal...lawyers and<br/>
everything...about whether the school has the &#39;right&#39; to restrict what<br/>
parents can pack in the little ones lunches just to enable TWO students to<br/>
attend.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe &quot;control&quot; isn&#39;t the best description.  We have always tried to allow<br/>
for much choice within what&#39;s allowable.  And parents are the ones<br/>
*choosing* what foods come into the home...thereby restricting or<br/>
controlling the child&#39;s choices.  Vegetarians may or may not allow their<br/>
children to be carnivores.....but I imagine that since they find it<br/>
unacceptable,  they&#39;ve only allowed vegan eating.<br/>
<br/>
I am of the thinking that children need to be in charge of their eating as<br/>
much as possible....if they can maintain an awareness of their body&#39;s<br/>
hunger-satiation signals...as well as an awareness of the feelings they get<br/>
from specific foods,  they&#39;ll most likely end up eating a balanced diet and<br/>
meet their unique body&#39;s needs.  With this guiding principle,  we hope the<br/>
youngsters will be able to try &#39;new&#39; foods when they have more freedom to<br/>
choose and determinr their own way (e.g.,  we have never once served<br/>
brussels sprouts here....they&#39;ll need to try those somewhere else.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m sorry your child can&#39;t be in a park where a person has eaten a peanut<br/>
&gt; butter sandwich.  That&#39;s harsh.   There are whole countries with hardly a<br/>
&gt; peanut.  If this allergy isn&#39;t grown out of, maybe moving would make life<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-786818463"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Even sitting at a park where someone else had eaten a PB&J could be a<br/>

&gt; How? Just curious.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If any peanut residue is left behind...on a park bench,  a napkin left on<br/>
the ground,  if the PB&J eater got some peanut butter residue on his/her<br/>
hands that wasn&#39;t completely cleaned off,  the allergic child could touch it<br/>
and have the full blown allergic reaction.  Oarents coping with this will<br/>
usually carry a &quot;safety kit&quot; to try to stop the reaction before it becomes<br/>
life threatening.<br/>
