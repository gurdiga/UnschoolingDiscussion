 </span></blockquote>Hi! I joined this list in January - and yes, there is often what appears to be arguing. But it really is debate. Many times, I delete and just read what I want..Other times, I read it all ( when I have time :-) ). It has all been useful to me in clarifying ideas on unschooling. I have had my values questioned, I have learned to  really look at my kids, I have been given ideas on day to day stuff AND on the big picture. The message board at www.unschooling.com is also really good reading - I&#39;ve been reaidng through old posts there when I can....Don&#39;t give up on the list - it all seems new, I know the feeling, but post a few questions, a few ideas and you&#39;ll get into it - into unschooling and the list. :-)..Leonie W. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>What family are you dealing with? If its extended family, I just talk in generalities - I don&#39;t say much about unschooling but talk about research and how lots of people homeschool and mention a few glorious moments...With closer family ( older kids? spouse?) I would feel free to journal some of our days and/or moments (I do this anyway) and show it to them as an example of  how well unschooling is working...Leonie W. <br/>
