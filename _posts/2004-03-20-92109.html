<div id="ygrps-yiv-86733988">I&#39;ve waited the requested 2 weeks, so here is my intro:<br/>
<br/>
I had sent my daughter to various preschool programs and to <br/>
Kindergarden before I decided to homeschool her. We sort of <br/>
&quot;fell into&quot; unschooling, but I didn&#39;t have much info about it and <br/>
was kind of lost and lonely. After doing it for one year, I <br/>
(mistakenly) put her back into school where she is right now. <br/>
She has asked to be homeschooled again, but wants to finish <br/>
the year, so we are going to homeschool her starting in May. I <br/>
am very excited about it and after some extensive research, have <br/>
decided to unschool again. This time I have read Holt and Gatto <br/>
and hooked up with you guys and other groups on line. I am <br/>
hoping for better success this time and am commited to this <br/>
long term! I also have a 4 year old who is in preschool and I will <br/>
be pulling him out as well. One of the reasons I put my dd back <br/>
in school is that I decided to return to College for my BA, but I <br/>
have found the classes less than satisfactory because we <br/>
frantically write notes only to memorize and regurgetate the info <br/>
on the tests. I have decided to look into a correspondence <br/>
program to become a naturopath, but I am nervous whether this <br/>
will conflict with my ability to be available to my kids when they <br/>
need me.<br/>
Any comments or advice is welcome (be gentle though please!)<br/>
Great to be here!<br/>
