<div id="ygrps-yiv-88846223">&lt;&lt;How did you come by a newborn?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hesitate to tell you as you seem to actually like the things.  We have had<br/>
a big rat out in our barn, eating our feed, and to be honest we have been<br/>
planning her demise.  Then apparently, the dogs found her nest and had the<br/>
babies.  Only this one was still alive when my 11yo found them.  So she<br/>
brought it to me.<br/>
<br/>
We fed it dropperfuls of warm goat milk for several days and it seemed to be<br/>
doing pretty well until yesterday.  I got up when I heard the little kids<br/>
(3yos) in the kitchen.  They were &quot;checking&quot; on the baby rat but may have<br/>
injured him.  Anyway, just about the time I decided he wasn&#39;t so gross, he<br/>
died.<br/>

That was probably why it died.<br/>
Goats milk closely resemble human milk, which is comparitively low in protein.<br/>
Rat babies grow very quickly, and rodent milk is overall very high in <br/>
protein. Human milk is something like five percent, and rodent is over 30 <br/>
percent if I remember right.<br/>
So it was getting hydration from the goats milk, but it probably starved to <br/>
death.<br/>
Wild rats do not make good pets, contact a breeder as Kelly suggested if you <br/>
want to keep one!!<br/>

Awwww.  At least you had mercy on the little thing.  I tried to rescue a<br/>
wild baby rat once and it died as well, they are hard to raise away from<br/>
the mom.<br/>
<br/>
I love rats but wild rats don&#39;t make good pets, although I&#39;m sure there<br/>
are exceptions to that rule out there.<br/>
