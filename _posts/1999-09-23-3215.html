<div id="ygrps-yiv-738302116">I have a question - not an answer for you Susan.  Sorry!   I also have a 19 <br/>
year old daughter who works full time and goes to college part time. <br/>
She&#39;s interested in doing more travelling,  maybe even an actual move <br/>
or two.  How has your daughter financed the travel?  What have you, <br/>
(or others) done about health insurance for older kids?  Our daughter <br/>
is still covered because she is a student and we pay part of her <br/>
support,  but if things change,  we could lose our coverage.  I know <br/>
these aren&#39;t interesting questions,  but they&#39;re the practical ones <br/>
that bug me :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-756064708">My daughter is presenting a workshop this Saturday on alternatives to <br/>
college.  She&#39;s 19 and decided a couple of years ago that college wasn&#39;t in <br/>
her best interest right now.<br/>
<br/>
Do any of you have older children (or ARE any of you older children!) who are <br/>
involved in interesting pursuits outside of college life?  My daughter has <br/>
been traveling quite a bit and has learned enormous amounts of wonderful <br/>
things.  She&#39;s presenting herself as an example, but it would be really <br/>
interesting to be able to talk about others as well...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  Now I&#39;ll have to look in all the attachments to see if there are any <br/>
responses (I&#39;m the one who complained about having to download digest <br/>
attachments)! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822991839">&lt;&lt;How has your daughter financed the travel?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, her first big independent venture was last year.  She hopped on an <br/>
Amtrak train and took it across the country to Oregon to visit a friend in <br/>
Eugene.  She had a three-stop pass and planned to stay with her friend, her <br/>
cousin in L.A. and then to meet up with us at the end of our trip to Texas.  <br/>
Her lodging expenses were nil and Amtrak was fairly inexpensive and she used <br/>
her savings.  She loved traveling by train and watching the world.<br/>
<br/>
Health insurance is really a pain.  She can be covered by an inexpensive <br/>
program for six months out of the year (with a very high deductible) <br/>
according to state law, but the other six months we haven&#39;t faced yet and  <br/>
I&#39;m not sure how it&#39;s going to be handled.  Luckily she&#39;s very healthy.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s been out to NJ twice in the last few months to visit a friend who has <br/>
taken her into NYCity a few times and up into New England a bit.  It&#39;s been <br/>
wonderful--he was born and raised in Brooklyn and really knows his way around <br/>
(he was amazed that she took out her billfold to get  money in a public <br/>
place, for instance--something that she wouldn&#39;t have thought twice about).  <br/>
Once she took the bus and the other time the train (train&#39;s her preference).<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s home now (just pulled in last night!) and will resume work at a food <br/>
co-op in town.  She&#39;s getting money together from that and other sources to <br/>
travel again in January, maybe a several-week trip this time.  She doesn&#39;t <br/>
know what she wants to do with her life in terms of supporting herself, but <br/>
then neither do a LOT of kids in college.  She has learned ENORMOUS amounts <br/>
of things and has gained such poise.  That&#39;s certainly going to help her in <br/>
any pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
When I think of how this child was at the age of five--permanently affixed to <br/>
me--it&#39;s nothing short of amazing that she&#39;s now gallivanting around the <br/>
country!  <br/>
<br/>
Diane, does your daughter know where she wants to go?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336376610">Hey all,<br/>
This discussion reminded me of a co-worker I knew about three yrs ago (I<br/>
resigned 1.5 yrs sgo when child #3 came along).... Anyhow,<br/>
Andy was our Special Events Coordinator.  It was his first job out of<br/>
college, so he was 21-22.  After working with us for about a year or 18<br/>
mos.,  Andy decide to join Mercy Corps.,  which is along the lines of the<br/>
Peace Corps,  only it&#39;s in the United States.  He wanted to do it to for<br/>
several reasons,  one of which was that it enabled him to explore another<br/>
part of the country.  He went to New Mexico and worked at an american indian<br/>
reservation school.  he got a small stipend which he used to travel in that<br/>
region of the country...and I guess he saved a bit from his year of work.<br/>
    Just tossing that idea out there!<br/>

OK, I have to know.  In places where it is risky to flash your wallet, how do <br/>
you pay for anything?  I&#39;d like to learn. <br/>

two of my adult siblings who were homeschooled all the way thru chose <br/>
alternatives to college.  one, an art institute the other a culinary <br/>
institute.  these sound schoolish but enabled them to go more directly to <br/>
hands on and avoid much of the core curric. that they had no interest in.  <br/>
brother (the chef) has worked as a chef for 7? years now and has included a <br/>
mississippi river cruise and hawaiian cruise as well as restaurants in two <br/>
other cities as part of his education and travel!  he is currently pursuing <br/>
an overseas job where he would work for room and board combined with some <br/>
time off to see the area but is coming up short due to many regulations of <br/>
working in another country.  if anyone has any info that might be helpful to <br/>
him, i would happily pass it on!  my sis (art institute) worked freelance <br/>
thruout her time there (some paid, some not) and this summer after graduation <br/>
has happily secured a full time position in her preferred area, yea!  is <br/>
happy with it so far.  in both of them i have been encouraged to see them <br/>
having a much clearer picture of their strengths and interests early on and <br/>
of course the freedom to pursue them, too!<br/>
