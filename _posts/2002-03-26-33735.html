<div id="ygrps-yiv-8725326">I just want to thank everyone who posted on this thread.  I promise to <br/>
try not to be so negative about open casket funerals anymore even <br/>
though I still don&#39;t get it.  I see that some of you have found it <br/>
to be very helpful, so I&#39;ll try not to be vocal about them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the differing views,<br/>
<br/>
Bridget</div>
