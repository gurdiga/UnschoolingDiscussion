<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046426771">Getting waaaay ot here, but for those of you that saw the movie &quot;Big Fish&quot;,<br/>
can anyone possibly assert or theorize the existence of the shoes cast over<br/>
the power lines at the entrance to the idyllic town?  I&#39;m such a literal<br/>
reader and movie watcher.  And can&#39;t imagine what that was all about beyond<br/>
the idyocracy of the challenge.<br/>
<br/>
***************<br/>
And, <br/>
I always thought that shoes over power lines marked the edges or boundaries<br/>
of a particular gang land area.  But I must admit that notion is coming from<br/>
someone who looks up to see the boundaries of Jewish neighborhoods.  Oh, how<br/>
our experiences (or lack of) influence our perceptions...it&#39;s best to be<br/>
open to a wide range of possibilities to any &quot;why&quot; question.<br/>
<br/>
Back to lurking.<br/>

I tried to look this up for meaning but didn&#39;t find it. Is it a real word or<br/>
just a cool typo that should be a real word?  <br/>
<br/>
Also<br/>

What are you expecting to see? Genuinely curious.<br/>
