What do  all of you think about working to<br/>
legislate freedom for young people, at  least incrementally?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s already happening, gradually and increasingly.<br/>
 <br/>
This week West Wing had some discussion of the right for kids to  vote.  That <br/>
was fun.  Keith who usually goes to sleep at 10:00, but  who was out of town <br/>
Wednesday and so was watching West Wing taped, went in at  10:30 at night to <br/>
show parts of that episode to Holly.  He told me today  that he wanted her to <br/>
see (even though fictional) some kids asking for the kind  of respect Holly has <br/>
always had.  It was cool.  I still haven&#39;t  watched it but will tonight, <br/>
probably.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I have been focusing more<br/>
on the changes I can make in my own life  because of disillusionment with the<br/>
political process, but our laws certainly  don&#39;t respect young people.  Also<br/>
wondering if you know any young people  who have expressed an interest in<br/>
changing laws related to their  rights.-=-<br/>

to see which two.<br/>

Glad to see this is being brought up on network TV!  I just found this site<br/>
with information about youth suffrage:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039818546">This morning I was thinking about Holly&#39;s current interest in French, and  <br/>
realized that she&#39;s going to balk at the &quot;tu&quot; and &quot;vous&quot; dichotomy.  As  with <br/>
any English speaker learning a language without a neutral pronoun, where  boats <br/>
and chairs and bottles have genders, that&#39;s a tricky part.  And she&#39;s  <br/>
interested in the history of English, so I can talk to her about &quot;thee&quot; vs.  &quot;you,&quot; <br/>
but the fact remains that English quit using the familiar pronouns  hundreds of <br/>
years ago, and it has been abandoned so thoroughly that people are  shocked <br/>
to find that the language of prayer (&quot;thy will be done&quot;) is NOT  the more <br/>
formal, respectful phrasing, but is the pronoun that used to  be used to speak to <br/>
servants, children and dogs: the informal.<br/>
 <br/>
It is possible, given that, that English speakers will have an easier time  <br/>
considering children&#39;s rights than people in cultures in which the whole  <br/>
language conspires to separate children from adults.<br/>

Yes, I like Marketplace. Eventhough one must pay shipping for each item <br/>
ordered, it still ends up saving money. I can usually get a used book <br/>
including shipping for less than $10. Books are so expensive these days!<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, related to an earlier post about buying full price books...<br/>
<br/>
I put all my groceries, gas, essentials, etc. on my Discover Card, which <br/>
I then pay IN FULL each month so I have no finance charges (obviously, <br/>
this is the key, or it&#39;s no deal at all, which is what the company&#39;s <br/>
hoping for). I can then use my Cashback Awards for gift certificates to <br/>
Borders Books--for each $20 Award I spend, I can buy a $25 giftcard from <br/>
Borders. I can then spend the giftcard just like cash in the store and <br/>
even apply my 20% teacher discount to the items I buy. A VERY good deal. <br/>
Free books for stuff I&#39;d have to purchase anyway. We generally cash in <br/>
twice a year and go crazy.<br/>

sooner. I was looking at The Convention on the Rights of the Child a <br/>

that Article 28 in that document says that participating states <br/>

have that already.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t say that a worldwide committee would be making any decisions <br/>
about what is appropriate for all children at specific ages. Quite a <br/>
leap.<br/>
<br/>
But - this isn&#39;t really an appropriate discussion for this list unless <br/>
you think that it would keep us from unschooling. I don&#39;t see why that <br/>
would be the case, especially since we&#39;re all unschooling right now in <br/>
a country that already does have compulsory education laws in every <br/>
state.<br/>
