<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247684835">We&#39;ve done an international fair for several years. Each child and/or family chooses a country. prepares a display, and a food from the country she/he has chosen. We make passports for each kid. Each child makes/buys a rubber stamp representative of the county. Kids visit the other countries, have their passports stamped, eat foreign food etc. Someone plans games from other countries. It&#39;s pretty fun.<br/>
