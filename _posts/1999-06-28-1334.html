&gt;My dh has served on admission committees for the osteopathic<br/>
&gt;medical school for which he works.  Nobody cares a bit about high<br/>
&gt;school.  College and MCAT scores are what the look at.<br/>
&gt;Unschooling or homeschooling shouldn&#39;t make one bit of difference<br/>
&gt;one way or another.<br/>

and oriented at approaching the entire patient as a person with<br/>
psychological/emotional needs to consider and other medical conditions that<br/>
might affect seemingly unrelated things in their health.  As opposed to the<br/>
traditional medicine method of treating symptoms, which may not be what is<br/>
needed to take care of the underlying cause.  <br/>

Sigh.... my sister is an osteopathic pathologist and gp, and coincidentally<br/>
our family doctor before we moved was an osteopath who went to school with<br/>
her.  We were not able to find an osteopath in our new area.  With two<br/>
little ones, one with a LOT of allergies, I have to run to the doctor<br/>
often.  Our doctor is competent and has a good manner, and I was satisfied<br/>
with his help when I was delivering our second baby.  But he is what I<br/>
would call a prescription doctor and always whips out that pad, every time<br/>
we go to him.  I use my judgement and do not always get them filled, but I<br/>
wish he was more eager to prescribe diet changes, physical therapy, natural<br/>
approaches before we resort to drugs.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am rambling...  :-)<br/>
