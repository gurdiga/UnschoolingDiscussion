&gt; with (but they&#39;re experienced dog-cats, they don&#39;t run), and optional<br/>
&gt; bedspace. We need a dog who bonds well to people and is loyal, who<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t yap, who rides well in the car, and who gets along with other<br/>
&gt; dogs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I imagine we&#39;ll get a shelter dog of some sort, we always do, so it may<br/>
&gt; very well be a mixed breed...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any ideas?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dar, Contact me offlist with detailed requirements AFTER the conference <br/>
(October11-13). I&#39;m a bit overwhelmed right now, but I can put you in touch <br/>
with the rescue folks for every breed of dog in a coupla&#39; weeks. Greyhounds <br/>
are lovely and in desperate need of homes. But they might not suit you all <br/>
personality-wise (esp with cats).<br/>
