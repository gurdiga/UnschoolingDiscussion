<div id="ygrps-yiv-305614051">Hi to all. Speaking of breastfeeding I breastfed all of my kids - 6 -<br/>
for various lengths of time. The last child I breastfed for 5 years. My<br/>
husband and other kids wanted me to stop so I did.<br/>
Four of my kids still live at home and we have two teenaged girls living<br/>
with us - so it is 6 again. A week ago a 16 year old - &quot;B&quot; = came to us.<br/>
She knew one of my daughters. She told me her mom keeps telling her she<br/>
doesn&#39;t want her. They have arguements often. In a way it sounds like<br/>
the typical teen years. She was adopted at 6 months so these are the<br/>
only parents she knows. She is black and they are not. She has a strong,<br/>
dominant personality. She is loud. We are usually fairly quiet. I put<br/>
together a contract and she signed it. She promptly broke it. It was<br/>
about curfew. The 5 eldest went out last night. &quot;B&quot; was confronted by<br/>
another teen girl and this girls boyfriend called &quot;B&quot; the &quot;n&quot; word. &quot;B&quot;<br/>
Took the girl down after the girl pulled her hair extensions and slapped<br/>
her face. This scenario has been building up since the other girl &quot;L&quot;<br/>
came to live  us. This same girl who hit &quot;B&quot; has had it out for &quot;L&quot; (who<br/>
happens to be a Ford model) because whe asked if the girls boyfriend<br/>
would buy her a sandwich in a flirtatous manner. The girl was so jealous<br/>
that she began a crusade to get &quot;L&quot;- the scanky &quot;b&quot; word. What drama!<br/>
Any way there was a football game in our town and they all went and<br/>
ended up in the fight in one way or another. The police were called. One<br/>
woman who knew little - if at all - said &quot;the black girl started it.&quot; I<br/>
hope the energy has dissapated from the situation now. The police said<br/>
there is no harassment law in Vermont. They lie so often I am not sure<br/>
if there is or not.Everyone was told to break it up. That was about it.<br/>
My 14 year old son feels the need to defend his sisters and any other<br/>
female. He told the 6 foot - very large guy - in a loud way to never<br/>
call &quot;B&quot; an &quot;n&quot; name again. The poor kid has been called a &quot;little man&quot;<br/>
3 times this summer by 3 other guys he has told to leave his sisters<br/>
alone. At this point we could write a play... My son has the personality<br/>
of a bull moose in heat at times.:) We talked it all out. I met with<br/>
&quot;B&#39;s&quot; parents. They said they have been in family counseling. The father<br/>
seems to protect his daughter (like my son) and the mother seems a bit<br/>
angry and says her daughter feels she can do nothing wrong. I am not<br/>
getting in the middle of that. They thanked us for offering her a safe<br/>
place to live. She seems to prefer male company. She gets along with her<br/>
father, grandfather and has a male best friend. She is listening to me<br/>
so far. Someone asked &quot;why are you putting this upon yourself?&quot; It<br/>
seemed like the thing to do at the time. The parents are grateful and<br/>
the kids are as safe as they choose to be. They are 21, 17 (almost 18),<br/>
17, 16, and 14. Michele<br/>
