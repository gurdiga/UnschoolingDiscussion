Yes, this year I am going to let it show that I sooo believe in what we are<br/>
doing and then I will go on and on about all the things we do!!  I think I<br/>
let the ones whose children are in school, intimidate me and I&#39;m not going<br/>
to let that happen.<br/>
Thanks, Lisa :o)<br/>

We used to get that - if fil doesn&#39;t have a report card to crow over and<br/>
then grandly hand out a dollar, he&#39;s lost. When they used to ask, I&#39;d<br/>
bore them to tears with what the kids are doing -which is exactly the<br/>
*last* thing they want to hear. lol. so they no longer ask. The other<br/>
day I got asked if we were sending our 13 yo to a private high school -<br/>
she assumed we were, said in  a tone of voice as in &quot;of course you&#39;re<br/>
not going to homeschool high school!?&quot;  I said no of course she&#39;s not<br/>
going to a private high school - where ever did you get that idea? end<br/>
of discussion. If they&#39;re not really interested in what the kids are<br/>
doing, go on about that endlessly and they&#39;ll learn real quick not to<br/>
ask. I refuse to justify what we&#39;re doing. Glad to discuss, but I refuse<br/>
to be interrogated or to have to satisfy someone who wrongly thinks they<br/>
have the right to judge what we&#39;re doing.<br/>
Believe in what you&#39;re doing and let that show, and put your kids first.<br/>
Wish I had stood up more firmly to the in-laws years ago.<br/>
good luck,<br/>
