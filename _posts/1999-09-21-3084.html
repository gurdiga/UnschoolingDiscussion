i think our partners really would understand if they compare it to ways they <br/>
get their own needs met each day and week, etc.  mine does when we talk about <br/>
it. after that, is just remembering to be respectful of each others needs and <br/>
supportive, too.  it makes each of us then in turn be quite willing to serve <br/>
the other when we feel appreciated respected and supported.  in other words <br/>
it turns out better in the end for our own needs being met when we try to <br/>
support the other WHILE the respect is equally held.  (if it is not, then we <br/>
will be used up.)<br/>
whew!<br/>
gotta quit for now.<br/>
