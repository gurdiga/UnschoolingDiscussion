<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; All in all, a very good first day of the<br/>
&gt; rest of our unschooling lives.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like a GREAT day, Diane.  (But I wanna come live at your house now,<br/>
since everybody sounds happy AND you have time to clean, too!)<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy tomorrow, too, even if it rains, is 25 degrees, the kids<br/>
wake up grouchy, and the toast is burnt.  Figure, heck, at least we&#39;re<br/>
unschooling and I don&#39;t have to deal with school problems on top of all<br/>
this!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s wishing you another really good day tomorrow, though!<br/>
