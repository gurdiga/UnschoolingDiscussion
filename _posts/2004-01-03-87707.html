<div id="ygrps-yiv-898155170">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am from Texas..It&#39;s kind of funny, in Mexico, every time I told <br/>
folks my name (on vacations) they would reply.. OH, my mother&#39;s name <br/>
is Teresa!.. lol.  Teresa is one of the most common names in the <br/>
world!.    I can be Teresa from Texas, and give up my fantasy of <br/>
being the exotic Goia.. LOL.. I will have to change my name on my <br/>
yahoo profile.<br/>
<br/>
Teresa from TX.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
See now I&#39;ve always found it fairly uncommon.  I&#39;ve known three people (in person) who are named Teresa with that spelling.  Theresa is more common here.  I also pronounce my name ....crap how do I do this in type?....<br/>
Dressa rhymes with Teresa.  Hmm not sure if that works? <br/>
Are you the Teresa that was posting here a while back or are you a New Teresa?<br/>
<br/>
