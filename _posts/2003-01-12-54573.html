&quot;When I was in school, and didn&#39;t see any practical use for math, I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; just did the work, got good grades, and quickly forgot any of the<br/>
&gt; information.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This reminded me of my favorite John Holt quote about school:<br/>
&quot;The child who wants to know something remembers it and uses it once he has<br/>
it; the child who lears something to please or appease someone else forgets<br/>
it when the need for pleasing or the danger of not appeasing is past... The<br/>
only difference between bad and good students in this respect is that the<br/>
bad students forget right away, while the good students are careful to wait<br/>
until after the exam.  If for no other reason we could well afford to throw<br/>
out most of what we teach in school because the children throw out almost<br/>
all of it anyway.&quot; (How Children Fail, 1964, p.175 in my edition).<br/>
<br/>
The middle sentence is actually my favorite!  I quote this to lots of<br/>
people.  I love it!!<br/>

Sandra - Thanks for the website for Karl Bunday.<br/>
I think of &quot;discrete&quot; math as &quot;concrete&quot; - Maybe it would be &quot;sweet&quot; to be<br/>
&quot;discreet&quot; with others.  I learned the same thing as brenda about wanting<br/>
more dessert (seconds).</div>
