I have wondered about this myself. For example, I know a number of young <br/>
people (in their 20s) who can quote chapter and verse from every TV show <br/>
ever made in the 1980s and 90s, along with every rerun, and they seem to <br/>
watch quite a bit of TV now as well. They are good people, very bright, and <br/>
have high-paying jobs that make a difference in our community. On the other <br/>
hand, they could work harder. They could be doctors or teachers (as some of <br/>
their parents were) and they&#39;re not. I wonder if had they had watched less <br/>
TV growing up, would they be harder workers. If anything, from what I&#39;ve <br/>
seen, watching TV makes people a bit more willing to lay back and relax. <br/>
Does anyone else think that?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-275596694">I think &quot;more willing to lay back and relax&quot; is a whole lot like<br/>
&quot;lazy&quot;.  Maybe it&#39;s the other way around, people who want to lay back<br/>
and relax turn the TV on.  Chicken or egg, again, methinks.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reminded of a friend I had years ago.  She had come here recently<br/>
from Hong Kong.  She was always telling me how she thought Americans<br/>
were different then Chinese people.  Americans worked their job, so she<br/>
said,  and then went home and watched TV and on the weekend looked for<br/>
ways to have fun, picnics, outings, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Chinese (she said) go home and do their second job during the evenings<br/>
and weekends.  Now, she wasn&#39;t struggling financially by any means.<br/>
Programmer by day and when I knew her, she was starting an import/export<br/>
business to trade with China during the evenings and weekends.<br/>
Previously, she&#39;d been running a restaurant in her spare time.  Last I<br/>
heard, by the way, she&#39;d quit her programming job and was in China<br/>
helping to eastablish their first ice cream factories.<br/>
<br/>
My point was she never watched TV but I don&#39;t think that was the key.<br/>
It was the attitude.  I probably, no make that I definitely, use the<br/>
computer like others use TV.  Doesn&#39;t make me any more productive in my<br/>
life than any TV watcher but I do enjoy it more.  I think people who get<br/>
real busy doing what they do don&#39;t have a lot of time to lay back and<br/>
relax and, hopefully, they love what they&#39;re doing.  Maybe that&#39;s the<br/>
key.  I feel a new year&#39;s resolution coming on.<br/>

Maybe they just don&#39;t WANT to be doctors or teachers.  Maybe they don&#39;t want<br/>
to work harder....maybe it is more important for them to enjoy their lives<br/>
and better the lives of people around them (as you say they have jobs that<br/>
&quot;make a difference in our community&quot;).  Maybe some of them think that about<br/>
stay-at-home moms like me.  What&#39;s the point of working harder if you don&#39;t<br/>
enjoy life along the way.  Some of the hardest workers I know are very<br/>
unhappy, unbalanced people.<br/>

&gt; Annette<br/>
&gt; ================<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Annette,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, but I would like to respectfully disagree with you.  What you <br/>
wrote really hit a nerve with me.  I don&#39;t like the idea of anyone <br/>
judging me according to how hard I work.  How hard I work is no one&#39;s <br/>
business but my own.<br/>
<br/>
Also, perhaps what you consider to be work, I consider to be play, or <br/>
vice versa.  Who is to decide what is &quot;work&quot; in the first place.  One of <br/>
the reasons I choose to unschool is so we can try and eliminate that <br/>
division between play and work.  I try to just live my life and do what <br/>
is necessary in the most relaxed way possible.  I am trying to pass this <br/>
on to my children.  This is one of the big reasons why we have an <br/>
unschooling lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
No one has the right to decide who is a hard worker and who is not.  I <br/>
don&#39;t like the idea of someone imposing his/her values upon me.<br/>
<br/>
Think twice before you judge someone in this regard.  Maybe the person <br/>
can&#39;t &quot;work hard&quot;, in your eyes, because of a mental illness, or s/he <br/>
has sick children and is under an enormous amount of stress and is <br/>
easily overwhelmed, or maybe this person just plain doesn&#39;t like to do <br/>
what you think is &quot;work&quot; - maybe s/he has other priorities, like <br/>
spending time with his/her children.  Maybe what is important to you is <br/>
not important to me.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the reason I don&#39;t rake my back yard FULL of leaves ever week is <br/>
because I love to rake leaves and I&#39;m letting it build up so I can enjoy <br/>
many hours of raking leaves all at one time.  I love creating a huge <br/>
mountain of leaf bags  in front of my house.  Right now there are 55 <br/>
bags of leaves in front of my house.  I&#39;ve had a lot of fun doing it <br/>
too.  My neighbor next door has for a couple of months now given us <br/>
dirty looks about the state of our back yard.  I choose to work <br/>
differently than he does.  I like to do it all at once.  I&#39;m not lazy.  <br/>
We&#39;re just different.  When I was back there raking all those leaves I <br/>
was having loads of fun.  I suspect my neighbor probably thought I was <br/>
finally getting around to doing some really unpleasant work.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone is different and no one should try and judge what, why, when or <br/>
how other people do things.  We should just try to treat each other <br/>
respectfully, with kindness and  accept everyone&#39;s differences.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was think something similar WRT to the breastfeeding/TV analogy. People<br/>
say that formula-feeding was good enuf for me, I&#39;m fine. Similarly, we can<br/>
point to all sorts of smart, successfull people who grew up watching and<br/>
continue to watch TV. How much better of would they be had they breastfed<br/>
or not watched TV? Personally, I&#39;m of the mind that it&#39;s impossible to<br/>
know...so many factors, both genetic and environmental, influence health<br/>
and personality. <br/>
<br/>
As far as TV goes, we allow my son to watch once a week. Those are the<br/>
rules, so he doesn&#39;t ask for it on the other days bc he is busy doing<br/>
other things, seeing friends, reading, playing and what-have-you. <br/>
<br/>
I think TV is harmful bc it takes away from time kids can be spent doing<br/>
other, more productive and imaginative things, like watching clouds float<br/>
thru the sky. The images of women and people of color bother me. Its<br/>
materialistic emphasis bothers me. Mostly, though, I hate the sound of it,<br/>
that ever-present din in the background. I find my own life is richer<br/>
w/out it. But that is my own baggage. My brother, on the other hand,<br/>
watches tons of TV. He also happens to be a serious and very successful<br/>
novelist who lacks nothing in the imagination or hardworking dept. So who<br/>
can really say? I guess it just comes down to one&#39;s own comfort level.<br/>

Here&#39;s the way we&#39;ve handled TV in our home....  It&#39;s been an ideal<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; solution in our house.  [Reminder: my children are ages 15,<br/>
13, and almost 9.]<br/>
<br/>
Several years ago, my older 2 children were watching a lot of TV (or so it<br/>
seemed to me).  I sat down with them and together we figured out how many<br/>
hours per day, week, month, and year they were spending watching TV.  (When<br/>
we found the yearly figure, it added up to be quite a lot, even though they<br/>
didn&#39;t watch as much as most kids.)  We subtracted hours for sleeping, and<br/>
came up with a number of full days they were spending watching TV.  (It was<br/>
astounding.)<br/>
<br/>
Then we all made a list of fun things to do--go to the zoo, take a walk,<br/>
play board games, to to museums, ride bikes, etc.  Then we looked at the<br/>
list of &quot;fun&quot; things to do and figured up how much time we could be spending<br/>
doing more interesting things than watching TV.  And then we vowed to do the<br/>
interesting things.  We talked about how much time THEY wanted to spend<br/>
watching TV in a day and which time THEY would rather spend doing more<br/>
interesting (to them) things.  And we talked about what shows they liked<br/>
best and which ones they watched because they were on.  Then for a while<br/>
after that, when I&#39;d catch them watching TV (particularly something that I<br/>
thought was pretty &quot;mindless&quot; or that they had agreed wasn&#39;t interesting),<br/>
I&#39;d just ask them (not accuse them) if there was something more interesting<br/>
they&#39;d rather be doing.  Almost always they decided there WAS and they&#39;d (or<br/>
we&#39;d) go do it.  If they said, &quot;no&quot; then I&#39;d accept that, too.  And during<br/>
the discussion, I did ask if it was OK with them that I reminded them of<br/>
their decision; they said they would like that.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a lecture.  I didn&#39;t even really PLAN it.  I hadn&#39;t even<br/>
pre-figured out what the total hours were--it was just as much a surprise to<br/>
me as it was to them.  We just had a discussion about what THEY valued.<br/>
This exercise helped THEM clarify THEIR value systems--not to impose mine on<br/>
them.  (Though, personally, I don&#39;t have a philosophical problem about<br/>
*trying* to pass along my own values....however, I realize it&#39;s *easiest* if<br/>
I&#39;m working *with* and respecting theirs; not against them.)<br/>
<br/>
We did make an effort to spend more time doing some interesting things, too,<br/>
like going to the zoo more often, to the park, spending time outside, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now my older two don&#39;t watch much TV at all, and almost never &quot;mindlessly&quot;<br/>
anymore (i.e. out of boredom).  My oldest will ONLY watch decidedly<br/>
&quot;educational&quot; shows (on Discovery, TLC, and The History Channel, for<br/>
example).  My youngest child is a real TV &quot;addict&quot;, however, and it&#39;s<br/>
probably time to have the same sort of discussion with her.  However, she&#39;s<br/>
also very active and has lots of other interests and a great imagination.<br/>
(I don&#39;t see TV affecting her the same way it seemed to affect the older<br/>
kids.)  And she really never has watched TV &quot;mindlessly&quot;.  She moves almost<br/>
constantly while she&#39;s watching (doing dance steps, gymnastics, etc.) and<br/>
remembers so much of what she watches.  She doesn&#39;t &quot;zone out&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this solution worked for us in that it wasn&#39;t ME imposing rules on<br/>
them, but them learning important life skills about setting goals,<br/>
clarifying their values and priorities, self-discipline, etc.  I just acted<br/>
as facilitator of the process.  I didn&#39;t make TV &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; to them,<br/>
but just one more menu choice.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s what works for us,<br/>

As I&#39;ve said here before, I do limit my son&#39;s TV.  I don&#39;t limit my <br/>
daughters&#39;.  I do encourage those who are havoing specific problems  <br/>
to look at it and experiment.  BUT I do not advocate limiting it for <br/>
those not already having other problems.  Kind of like I think it is <br/>
okay for the mother of a diabetic to montior and limit foods but <br/>

it&#39;s worth a read.  I disagree with his assumtion that it works for <br/>
all but it was interesting nonetheless.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701282038">Leslie, are you my twin?! LOL... I feel the same way! I only rake a <br/>
small grassy area where the dogs poop... the rest is all natural. <br/>
Raking leaves? I think I could find something more fun to do with my <br/>
days!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-405710494">Yes.  I personally believe we only live once and we should enjoy our <br/>
lives as much as possible.  Try and avoid the unpleasant stuff and have <br/>
as much FUN as possible.  For me, this is the healthiest approach.  I <br/>
tend to be a pretty stressed-out person and I am easily overwhelmed.  I <br/>
am always trying to learn how to relax and not worry about things not <br/>
being perfect or worrying about what other people think.  It is a very <br/>
slow process for me, but I am learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-24331863">To me,  the &quot;This was my experience in childhood and I turned out OK&quot;<br/>
argument is logically baseless.   Many people who were spanked turned out<br/>
OK.  Many people who were abused and neglected &quot;turned out OK&quot;,  many people<br/>
who grew up on formula and not breast fed turned out OK.  Whne I facilitated<br/>
a parenting class a couple of years ago,  the spanking argument  almost<br/>
always contained a strong...&quot;I was spanked and I turned out OK;  therefore<br/>
spanking contributes to turning out OK.&quot;   So illogical!<br/>
<br/>
    I guess we want to wish we could predict what will make our children be<br/>
the best type of people they can be when they&#39;re on their own.  I know<br/>
poeple willing to take on the challenge of unschooling....of thinking about<br/>
how they treat their children,  etc want to provide the most nurtusing<br/>
environment and relationship they can muster.  But there are so many<br/>
circumstances and events we cannot predict that could impact our<br/>
children...there are personality conflicts in families,  diseases,  all<br/>
kinds of things we cannot control.  I guess we want the things we can<br/>
control to make a difference?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-540307142">WOW!!!  What a beautiful back yard.  Looks like a few acres, at least.<br/>
I&#39;ll be right over!!  &lt;BBGG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We live here in Houston, Texas.  If I am permitted to ask, where do you <br/>
live?<br/>
<br/>
My husband just bought a digital camera for the family, so maybe <br/>
sometime soon I&#39;ll post some pictures too.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like you have a very beautiful family.  You and your girls look <br/>
very pretty and you&#39;re so lucky to have 3 dogs.  You and your husband <br/>
look like a very nice couple.<br/>
<br/>
My boys have been begging for a dog, but I have an old cat (14 years <br/>
old) that I don&#39;t want to upset - I think we&#39;ll wait until RoyRoy goes <br/>
to pussycat heaven.<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed your pictures.  Thanks for sharing them with us.<br/>

clutter and she follows her advice. I think she&#39;s made some progress <br/>

whatever) is such a hard thing to undo in your makeup. I&#39;m a pack <br/>
rat... keep everything except old emails! But I&#39;ve learned to <br/>
categorize stuff and put it away in an orderly fashion.<br/>
And no, no pics of the inside of my house either! It&#39;s so dirty (who <br/>
mentioned cobwebs???!! lol.. I can relate). I&#39;m doing good just to <br/>
vacuum up all the pet hair. <br/>
btw, two dogs.. not three (how did you count three? Or did the kids <br/>
snick one in on me and I&#39;ve just not noticed?) &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774600757">Hi Nichoel,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still a Flybaby, but I think it will work for me too if I stick with <br/>
it and give it a good try.  When she starts talking about CHAOS and <br/>
being a perfectionist, etc., I feel like she&#39;s talking about me.  I <br/>
relate to what she says very well.<br/>

&gt; Flylady is a God-send for me...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My house is so much cleaner, my family more relaxed..and I spend LESS <br/>
&gt; time cleaning now than I did before (I still havent figured out how <br/>
&gt; that works..)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I really believe her system works if you work it =)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Thanks!!!  I&#39;ll check it out right now.  There&#39;s no way I&#39;ll share<br/>
&gt;   pictures of the inside of our house.  It&#39;s just too embarrassing.<br/>
&gt;   Today&#39;s the first day of a new year - I&#39;m trying to get a handle on<br/>
&gt;   things and make this place more presentable.  Are you familiar with<br/>
&gt;   FLYLADY?  I get her reminders all day long and I try to follow her<br/>
&gt;   instructions as best as I can.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;&gt; Glad to help!<br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;d give you the link but it is at a place you get to once you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;&gt; entered your yahoo name and password.<br/>
&gt;&gt; SO... go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yahoogroups.com">http://www.yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
&gt;&gt; you will probably have to sign in... maybe not (it&#39;s the same name<br/>
&gt;&gt; you created to join this list at yahoo).<br/>
&gt;&gt; Then, once you&#39;ve signed in, on the left of the screen is a list of<br/>
&gt;&gt; groups you belong to..... click on the unschoolingdotcom one.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Next, on the left of that screen will be a list of things... members,<br/>
&gt;&gt; posts, calendar, photos, etc..... click on &quot;photos&quot;.<br/>
&gt;&gt; You&#39;ll then see a screen where anybody can create a photo album for<br/>
&gt;&gt; the group. I&#39;ve created my family one (carothers)... click on<br/>
&gt;&gt; carothers.  You can choose how to view by some options over on the<br/>
&gt;&gt; right side of your screen. If you need help, let me know..<br/>
