Does anyone have a *recipe* for making rain in a bottle.  <br/>
I know there is one somewhere, I just can&#39;t find it now.<br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;m also trying to figure it out, I&#39;m wondering if I don&#39;t camp in a tent am<br/>
I going to be really far removed from the rest of the group? We are checking<br/>
into those trailer/type campers, pretty reasonably priced. But I love the<br/>
campfires and all that stuff,,,so,,,hmm<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about trying to lug a tent through airports! I know my dh doesn<br/>
t think that sounds very fun. And he&#39;d probably be the one carrying it. <br/>
<br/>
Brenda, what type of sleeping accomodations are you considering?<br/>
<br/>
Shyrley, you bring a tent from the US?<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone else out there thinking about going over? From the states? It is<br/>
very reasonably priced, airfare, in May, to England is pretty resonable, I<br/>
know, tho&#39; , it still is several hundred dollars for five of us so, I do<br/>
have to add it all up. My in-laws might want to go over too, so that would<br/>
be fun too.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, again I&#39;m rambling to 900 people, sorry!<br/>

distance from Germany. Maybe we could rent a car together, if it&#39;s a decent<br/>
sized one. There&#39;s only 2 of us, my dh never gets to go anywhere fun.<br/>

There&#39;s also decent train service in England, isn&#39;t there, Shyrley? Any<br/>
chance of getting there by train, or do we need a car while there.<br/>
