<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112416268">&lt;&lt;I can&#39;t find any particularly parent-of-toddler stuff.  Do others here<br/>
know<br/>
of some?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Natural Child Project has parenting affirmation cards you can buy, but there<br/>
are also samples to view online<br/>

Something else I try to do is pretend what I&#39;m feeling/saying is coming from<br/>
someone else.  For example, if I told you that I was currently overwhelmed<br/>
with my kid(s) and not finding balance and enough time to recharge, you<br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t say, &quot;Geez, what&#39;s wrong with you?! How hard could it be?&quot;<br/>
Likely you would say something supportive and reassuring like, &quot;Oh Man! I<br/>
know just how you feel! When mine were little like that I felt so strung out<br/>
all the time! It&#39;s HARD, isn&#39;t it?! Hang in there, though--you&#39;re doing<br/>
great and your kids are TERRIFIC!&quot;  So, the trick is to tell YOURSELF the<br/>
second one and not save the good stuff only for other people.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

It does help Betsy.  I like the idea of telling myself what I would tell<br/>
someone else in my position, especially if I also drop off all my old<br/>
baggage first (all the negative things my own parents have said to me that<br/>
have stuck to my psyche like a fly on flypaper.)<br/>
