<div id="ygrps-yiv-743173522">Hi everyone!  I would like to invite anyone who is interested in a <br/>
local support group in Northern Palm Beach County/ Martin County to <br/>
contact me off list at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:luckiebyrd@...">luckiebyrd@...</a>.  Plans so far are very <br/>
loose and mostly consist of just getting together to play/talk/have <br/>
fun:)  I would like this to be an inclusive group which means that <br/>
you don&#39;t have to be an unschooling family to join in the fun, but as <br/>
of now three out of four of the interested families are unschooling <br/>
families. <br/>
<br/>
Happy learning <br/>
<br/>
Cheryl</div>
