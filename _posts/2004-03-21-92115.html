<div id="ygrps-yiv-994370639">Schoolhouse rocked<br/>
No longer just for the religious fundamentalists, home schooling has gone <br/>
main stream, especially in Massachusetts. It&#39;s estimated that as many as 20,000 <br/>
children here have abandoned test-crazy public schools and high-priced private <br/>
schools for the comfort of the living room couch. But most surprising of all <br/>
is that Harvard, BU, Brown, and other colleges are welcoming home-schoolers <br/>
like all other students. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133925225">You may have to copy and paste that link, clicking on it didn&#39;t work  <br/>
for me.  Some of the article is about Maureen Carey&#39;s daughter who goes  <br/>
to Harvard. Maureen talked at the South Carolina conference about how  <br/>
her daughter was a total unschooler and ended up not only getting INTO  <br/>
Harvard, but getting a full scholarship.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364762948">Interesting article.  It always amazes me that the stereotype of awkward, sheltered, deprived &quot;homeschooled&quot; students is still out there.  <br/>
<br/>
Hey - I have long grey hair and wire glasses and no  makeup: I didn&#39;t know that I was a &quot;Cambridge type.&quot;  And I want a t-shirt that says, &quot;We&#39;re never home. And it&#39;s not school.&quot;  I think I may make myself one. <br/>
