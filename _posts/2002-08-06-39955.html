&lt;&lt; We had this discussion on this list a month or so ago - people were <br/>
posting <br/>
about this exact thing - and were attacked for supposedly saying that kids <br/>
needed to be &quot;entertained all the time.&quot; Just can&#39;t win, can we? &lt;G&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I got jumped pretty hard for saying parents should spend as much time <br/>
directly with those kids as the kids would have spent in school.<br/>
<br/>
It was more a &quot;Why would you spend less?&quot; comment.  My REAL press was that <br/>
parents WILL spend at least as much time as they used to spend getting kids <br/>
ready for school and transporting them, but it won&#39;t be the same kind of <br/>
powerless, stressful, at-others&#39;-bidding timespending.<br/>
<br/>
Being with a child is powerful.  Not just being in the room while they&#39;re in <br/>
the room, or in the house while they&#39;re in the house, but *with* them in what <br/>
they&#39;re doing.  Sharing what they&#39;re doing, talking about their thoughts and <br/>
the experiences of the day, telling them stories about your own day, month, <br/>
life, ideas.  Doing this in a quiet, open-ended way, whether it&#39;s in the car <br/>
or on the couch or in the back yard pulling weeds or walking to a video store <br/>
or whatever, I consider that some of the greatest learning time in which I <br/>
get to participate with my kids.  It beats the heck out of testing and <br/>
reporting, which separate child from parent, and learning from life.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents don&#39;t remember to do that, or they&#39;ve forgotten how, or their <br/>
kids aren&#39;t talkative, or the relationship has gone hard and hostile, or they <br/>
act teacherly when such opportunities come along.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone doubts that this has been my recommendation in the past, please <br/>
read the &quot;Leaning on a Truck&quot; article at<br/>
