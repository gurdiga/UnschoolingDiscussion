Valerie has agreed to meet with us in Alabama, too!  Tuesday, November 9th,<br/>
5-8.  This will be at the home of Deirdre Aycock, 401 Main Street, Eutaw,<br/>
AL.  Come and drop in to talk with Valerie--she&#39;ll answer specific questions<br/>
or talk about your topic of concern.  We&#39;ll cook up some spaghetti to eat<br/>
while we visit, so let us know if you plan to try and make it!<br/>
