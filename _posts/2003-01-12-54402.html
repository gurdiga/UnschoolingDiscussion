<div id="ygrps-yiv-530893604">My 5dd had absolutely no interest in going to school until she saw the<br/>
big yellow school busses on the PBS cartoons (I think it was actually<br/>
Arthur). She wanted desperately to ride on one. We kind of let it go,<br/>
figuring she would get past this, but she didn&#39;t. They made it look like<br/>
so much fun. One day my husband comes up the driveway with a yellow<br/>
school bus. A local school district was selling their perfectly good band<br/>
bus, and he was at the right place at the right time, and it was really<br/>
cheap. So now my DD&#39;s have a bus of their very own, and they play in it<br/>
and go for occasional rides. I realize that this is not practical for<br/>
everyone, but I thought it was a super sweet thing to do on my hubby&#39;s<br/>
part, and the desire to go to school for the sake of the bus ride is in<br/>
the past.<br/>

&gt; &gt; There are complaints I could make about Sesame Street, about <br/>
&gt; specific moments <br/>
&gt; &gt; or little videos which are really outdated and I wish they hadn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; shown.  I <br/>
&gt; &gt; wish they had promoted breastfeeding instead of showing bottlefed <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; babies.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; But musically it&#39;s wonderful.  Every musical style ever was <br/>
&gt; represented.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I saw a video on Sesame Street that showed kids getting ready for <br/>
&gt; preschool, and showed kids what a fun thing preschool was.  I wish, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; when they do things to get kids excited about school and show them <br/>
&gt; getting on these cool yellow school buses, that they would also show <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the kids at home who don&#39;t go to school, and how much fun they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; having too.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course that&#39;s not true of only Sesame Street, but of most tv <br/>
&gt; shows <br/>
&gt; in general. <br/>
