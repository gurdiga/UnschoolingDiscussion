  I was signing the receipt for my credit card<br/>
purchase when the clerk noticed that I had never<br/>
signed my name on the back of the credit card. She<br/>
informed me that she could not complete the<br/>
transaction unless the card was signed. When I asked<br/>
why, she explained that it was necessary to compare<br/>
the signature on the credit card with the signature I<br/>
just signed on the receipt. So I signed the credit<br/>
card in front of her. She carefully compared that<br/>
signature to the one I signed on the<br/>
receipt. As luck would have it, they matched.<br/>
<br/>
ADVICE FOR IDIOTS<br/>
  An actual tip from page 16 of the HP &quot;Environmental,<br/>
Health & Safety Handbook for Employees:  &quot;Blink your<br/>
eyelids periodically to lubricate your eyes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
IDIOTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD<br/>
  I live in a semi-rural area. We recently had a new<br/>
neighbor call the local township administrative office<br/>
to request the removal of the Deer Crossing sign on<br/>
our road. The reason: Many deer were being hit by cars<br/>
and he no longer wanted them to cross there.<br/>
<br/>
IDIOTS IN FOOD SERVICE<br/>
  My daughter went to a local Taco Bell and ordered a<br/>
taco. She asked the individual behind the counter for<br/>
&quot;minimal lettuce.&quot; He said he was sorry, but they only<br/>
had iceberg.<br/>
<br/>
IDIOT SIGHTINGS Sighting #1:<br/>
  I was at the airport, checking in at the gate, when<br/>
the airport employee asked, &quot;Has anyone put anything<br/>
in your baggage without your knowledge?&quot;  I said, &quot;If<br/>
it was without my knowledge, how would I know?&quot;  He<br/>
smiled and nodded knowingly, &quot;That&#39;s why we ask.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sighting #2:<br/>
  The stoplight on the corner buzzes when it is safe<br/>
to cross the street. I was crossing with an<br/>
intellectually challenged co-worker of mine, when she<br/>
asked if I knew what the buzzer was for. I explained<br/>
that it signals to blind people when the light is red.<br/>
She responded, appalled, &quot;What on earth are blind<br/>
people doing driving?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sighting #3:<br/>
  At a good-bye lunch for an old and dear coworker who<br/>
is leaving the company due to &quot;downsizing,&quot; our<br/>
manager spoke up and said, &quot;this is fun.  We should<br/>
have lunch like this more often.&quot; Not another word was<br/>
spoken.  We just looked at each other like deer<br/>
staring into the headlights of an approaching truck.<br/>
<br/>
Sighting #4:<br/>
  I worked with an Individual who plugged her power<br/>
strip back into itself and for the life of her could<br/>
not understand why her system would not turn on.<br/>
<br/>
Sighting #5:<br/>
  When my husband and I arrived at an automobile<br/>
dealership to pick up our car, we were told that the<br/>
keys had been accidentally locked in it. We went to<br/>
the service department and found a mechanic working<br/>
feverishly to unlock the driver&#39;s side door. As I<br/>
watched from the passenger&#39;s side, I instinctively<br/>
tried the door handle and discovered it was open. <br/>
&quot;Hey,&quot; I  announced to the technician, &quot;It&#39;s open!&quot;<br/>
&quot;I know,&quot; answered the young man.- &quot;I already got that side.&quot;</div>
