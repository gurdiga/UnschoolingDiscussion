  I think it&#39;s very sad that you would be so rude to a newcomer on the <br/>
  list.  I think it&#39;s sad that you would be intolerant of other <br/>
  people&#39;s parenting practices.  Even if it does give you cold chills, <br/>
  there are much nicer ways to talk to people you disagree with.  You <br/>
  catch more flies with honey...<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily true that one can&#39;t be an unschooler <br/>
  AND choose to spank.  I would think that totally unschooling would <br/>
  usually lead to a non-spanking position, but that&#39;s just my guess.  <br/>
  Not everyone gets there at the same time.  <br/>
<br/>
  If a spanker would say to a non-spanker, &quot;I don&#39;t want to read <br/>
  anything else you have to say&quot;, they would get slammed big time.  <br/>
<br/>
  And I&#39;ve had two people tell me that my posts repulsed them, just <br/>
  because I support parental rights.  If I told someone who doesn&#39;t <br/>
  believe in parental rights that their posts repulsed me, I would get <br/>
  slammed big time.  <br/>
<br/>
  Is it ok to be verbally mean to people because they have a different <br/>
  point of view?  That&#39;s not good discussion and it&#39;s not good <br/>
  debating.  <br/>
<br/>
  As far as who is disrupting the list, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the people <br/>
  who are brave enough to stick up for their right to discipline their <br/>
  children according to their own consciences, I think it&#39;s the handful <br/>
  of people who reply with cold meanness. <br/>

that!  From what I&#39;ve been reading, though, and from what I remember <br/>
several weeks ago, there seems to be a tremendous amount of denial or <br/>

For my part, I wouldn&#39;t want a world (or an unschooling list) without the <br/>
amazing vision and clarity of Sandra or Ren or Pam or Tia or Joyce or Dar <br/>
or Kelly or Deb L or Patti and on and on.    There are times when I read a <br/>
post by those &quot;mean&quot; folks and I&#39;m just so very grateful for their ability <br/>
to stay on target!  These folks are my absolute HEROES, I tell you!<br/>
<br/>
Sandra raised excellent points in response to Sheila&#39;s lauded post.  I know <br/>
I don&#39;t post a whole lot, but I get so much out of this list that I <br/>
sometimes feel like I ought to be paying for it.<br/>
<br/>
But, each to their own, though, right?  For me, I&#39;ll take gritty frankness <br/>
and blunt honesty any day!  I&#39;m not a soothsayer or sage, but I&#39;d be mighty <br/>
surprised if there were such a list where people could post &quot;without worry <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781308390">Marji, <br/>
I agree, I also met Kelly and Ren (and you!) and a few others at the conference and they are wonderful people. I&#39;ve read and agreed with Sandra&#39;s writings for several years. I also enjoy the frankness of this list and have gotten a lot out of it. However, the name-calling, deliberate twisting of words, put-downs, and flat refusal to accept that other&#39;s have a right to hold their own views is totally against what I believe unschooling should be about. No matter if a parent spanks or believes in God or is young, they may still have valuable input to offer and they are being squashed right out of posting on this list. The atmosphere here is that if you don&#39;t fit in the &quot;perfect parent&quot; box or at least repent of what you do that makes you not the &quot;perfect parent&quot; and promise to try harder, that you&#39;re not welcome, you&#39;re stupid, and you don&#39;t care about your children. While that attitude may help some people, it turns even more away that could benefit from the ideas and philosophies that go along with unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, BTW, I&#39;m on two other lists that have 500+ members and neither of them have even a fraction of the flaming and attacking going on here. It&#39;s very possible when everyone works together as a team and helps each other. <br/>

People need to learn on their own sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
People quit that other list for the same reasons people leave this one.  They <br/>
feel like an outsider, or they can&#39;t stand debate, or they want a place where <br/>
people say &quot;lovely, lovely!&quot; about anything.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s certainly worth a try, though.  It is possible to have a group of people <br/>
who hardly ever argue.  It&#39;s probably impossible to maintain it on a list <br/>
which is open to anyone who comes along, though.<br/>
