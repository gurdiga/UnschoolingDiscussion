&gt; I think it&#39;s the word &quot;use&quot; which is causing the problems.<br/>

Maybe.<br/>
But &quot;using&quot; a book (whether someone tells you to or not) with the possible <br/>
thought that you can &quot;use&quot; that book to learn that subject (ALL of that subject, <br/>
simply and directly) works against unschooling, not toward it.<br/>
