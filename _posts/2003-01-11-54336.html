<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that was just an example of several &quot;symptoms&quot;.  I&#39;ve been reading a <br/>
lot about Autism, Asperger&#39;s, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction.  Some <br/>
children have a huge aversion to stimuli.  Bright lights, loud noises, touch. <br/>
  Some can&#39;t stand having their teeth or hair brushed.  Some have to wear <br/>
their clothes inside out because of tags or seams.  Some can&#39;t wear stiff <br/>
fabric, and some jeans would really irritate some children.<br/>
It&#39;s possible that&#39;s what was being talked about here.<br/>

Holly and I take all the tags out of our clothes.  She prefers used clothes <br/>
to new ones.<br/>
I&#39;m not planning to medicate her about it.<br/>

LOL!!! Tara, my oldest still takes all the tags off her clothes! Been doing <br/>
that since she was old enough to ask me to remove them. Joseph doesn&#39;t care <br/>
much unless it&#39;s a particularly scratchy one. He doesn&#39;t really like jeans <br/>
though and prefers elastic waist pants. Of course with him being so thin, he <br/>
doesn&#39;t have much of a choice. Sierra has gone from not liking jeans or <br/>
waistband pants to liking them again. The tags mostly stay on and she&#39;s easy <br/>
going with anything she wears. Alyssa, at 2, wants all the tags taken off of <br/>
everything right now!!! She has one pair of little jeans with some elastic <br/>
in the back but the front is a zipper and snap. She looks adorable in them <br/>
and absolutely hates them!!! Bummer is when I take all her mostly new unworn <br/>
don&#39;t fit anymore clothes to the consignment shop, they haven&#39;t a clue what <br/>
size they are!!<br/>

My daughter could not possibly have more problems getting comfortable in<br/>
her clothes.  It never once occurred to me to label it or to medicate<br/>
her.  We buy certain types of clothes and socks (soft, with thin seams,<br/>
etc), make sure we give her enough time to get dressed at her own pace,<br/>
and rearrange our schedule as needed when she feels that her birthday<br/>
suit is the way to go.  <br/>
 <br/>
My older daughter went through a phase like this (to a lesser degree)<br/>
when she was this age, and it passed for the most part.  She still turns<br/>
her socks inside out but it&#39;s not a big deal for her.  I&#39;d much rather<br/>
they feel that we take their feelings seriously and help them get<br/>
comfortable than that there is something wrong with them that needed<br/>
fixing by an expert.<br/>

integration issues are frequently discussed. Medication usually<br/>
involves coping with a school system for a kid with SI issues: not<br/>
coping with dressing. There are lots of soft dressing options for<br/>
kids who don&#39;t want to wear jeans or have trouble with tags or the<br/>
seams on socks... <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We buy certain types of clothes and socks (soft, with thin seams,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son is like this too.  We went through so many different kinds of <br/>
underpants before we found ones he would wear.  Once we did (sadly, very <br/>
expensive Hanna Andersson&#39;s), he suddenly was able to get dressed after going <br/>
to the bathroom.  I think this sensitivity pretty common.  My father, at 78, <br/>
cuts his tags out and wears seamless socks.  I&#39;ve become an all cotton person <br/>
since quitting work.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note to this, my son (4 1/2) is not potty trained over night.  We <br/>
put him in good nites pull ups but he soaks them.  Sometimes he gets up, <br/>
sometimes he doesn&#39;t.  He has horrible itchiness and some rashes from the <br/>
wetness, or maybe from the chemicals in the pull up.  Any suggestions of <br/>
natural overnight protection?  Brands or cotton diaper type pullups to buy <br/>
and where to get them?  I&#39;d like to try something for the poor kid.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Get yourself a fabric marker and write the size in the back of the collar or<br/>
waistband as soon as you take the tag out.  It makes consigning easier, and<br/>
you tend to get better money for them, too, because they sell more easily<br/>
and don&#39;t get marked down for hanging around too long.  And, as an added<br/>
benefit, you can find the front/back of a shirt at a glance.<br/>
<br/>
The other use I get out of those fabric markers is writing NO in big letters<br/>
on the inside back of the collar of things that can&#39;t be put in the dryer.<br/>
(It works well, but my dh commented the other day that I have a lot of very<br/>
negative looking clothes!)<br/>

durable. And, yes, expensive.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Yeah, I dont think a kid would need medication JUST to be able to wear <br/>
clothes. That was a bit extreme of an example.  But, medication may be in <br/>
order to treat the &quot;complete&quot; dysfunction.( and being able to tolerate <br/>
clothing better would  be a natural effect).  SID is real and it does pervade <br/>
some children (and adults) lives to the extent that some type of <br/>
intervention/treatment has to be utilized beyond environmental controls.     <br/>

Thanks Brenda. How stupid am I not to have thought of that?? I&#39;m sure my mom <br/>
already has one around. Thanks again. As far as the dryer thing, if I can&#39;t <br/>
throw it in there, it isn&#39;t being worn!!<br/>
