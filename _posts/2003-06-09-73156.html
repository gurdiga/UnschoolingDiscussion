 </span></blockquote>Heidi, I just wanted to say that I am amazed by you. On the whole unschooling <br/>
spectrum, most of the things you&#39;re struggling with are not huge, <br/>
disempowering things, but you keep at it. You mention something, get feedback, and mostly <br/>
don&#39;t take it personally, but really think about it and re-evaluate your <br/>
stance. <br/>
<br/>
There are so many people who come in SURE they&#39;re right, never think about <br/>
anything anyone says, and either stay here, huffy, or go off in a huff.<br/>
<br/>
You never do that. I&#39;m impressed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Kathryn. If I hadn&#39;t had some wonderful experiences with <br/>
a &quot;let kids teach themselves&quot; curriculum called Robinson (very math <br/>
oriented, and strict about doing some math every day, but otherwise, <br/>
very inclined to trust that a kid&#39;s brain is going to work, if given <br/>
plenty of stimulating things to work on)<br/>
<br/>
plus, a rotten experience with the K12 curriculum. Plus, reading <br/>
Gatto and Holt. Plus observing my kids know things I&#39;ve never taught <br/>
them. <br/>
<br/>
Those things sort of set me up to listen to people with experience. <br/>
It&#39;s got me questioning just EVERYTHING.<br/>
