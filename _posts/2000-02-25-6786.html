<div id="ygrps-yiv-202311181"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  I am looking for a link to a site which will supply me with the Latin<br/>

Fieldfare(bird)  is called Turdus pilarus... <br/>
<br/>
I would like a link  where  I could put in a common name for a species and<br/>
it would give me the scientific name??? Any ideas??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks...Brooke in BC<br/>
