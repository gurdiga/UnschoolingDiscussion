&lt;&lt; I think the concern is that a child might take the bad guys as a &quot;role <br/>
model&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if there could be an unschooled child who could have so little <br/>
personality and self worth that he would say &quot;I am nobody.  I would like to <br/>
become Mario&quot;<br/>
or <br/>
&quot;From now on I will be Sonic.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But my niece Gina was homeschooled, and really liked Sonic when she was <br/>
little (still), and it led to a huge quantity of art and fiction:<br/>

<br/>
She&#39;s eighteen now and a REALLY good artist.<br/>
<br/>
But I doubt that anyone would be more likely to want to be a little cartoon <br/>
guy who&#39;s stealing a cartoon car, either.  They know fiction from reality.  <br/>
And someone who does NOT know fiction from reality has a MUCH bigger problem <br/>
than what video game he&#39;s playing.<br/>
<br/>
I sheltered Kirby (easily) from lots of unpleasant input when he was little, <br/>
but he was an only child, and I was a first-kid parent.  It seemed natural.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly has always had two older brothers.  She&#39;s seen lots of things Kirby <br/>
would not have, at ever stage along the way.  And she&#39;s more peaceable than <br/>
Kirby.  Gender?  Personality?  Likely.  But they&#39;re all three good-hearted, <br/>
honest and non-violent types who have seen, heard and played fictionally <br/>
violent scenarios without changing their goodness.<br/>

Do you feel that unschooled children are immune from personality<br/>
quirks and problems?  I ask because I often notice that any examples<br/>
of negative child behavior you offer seem, to my understanding, to<br/>
focus on schooled (home and public) children.<br/>

<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
But we KNOW that school causes problems.<br/>
<br/>
My children are absolutely free from school-caused problems.  That doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean free from any problems.<br/>

<br/>
Structured home schooling (school-at-home) can cause many of the same kinds <br/>
of problems school causes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not Sandra, but I can tell you that after living and working with <br/>
various ages of unschoolers for most of my life I&#39;ve found they have <br/>
about the same percentage of quirks, problems, personality disorders <br/>
and foibles as the rest of the population. And as with everyone else, <br/>
those will often be endearing qualities.<br/>
