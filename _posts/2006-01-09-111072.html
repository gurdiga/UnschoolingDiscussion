<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012000480">I had posted on AU about game ideas with little ones. The replies were very helpful, including the suggestions of games. <br/>
   <br/>
  We have had a set of Yahtzee dice floating around, having lost the game pad and shaker cup. I found them recently and had them put up on the mantlepiece for &quot;later.&quot; <br/>
   <br/>
  Logan found them and we just sat down to play with them for awhile, each of us with two dice, rolling and counting the tops. Of course, it wasn&#39;t long before the girls came to see what we were doing, and grabbing the dice away from us trying to play. <br/>
   <br/>
  I started to get annoyed and irritated, but I thought, no..let them play too. So I let them roll and I counted for them. Then it hit me..I should buy alot of dice of varying types so that it&#39;s not even close to being a problem. I know there are some very neat dice out there for gaming, and I think we could have alot of fun all six of us throwing dice around. So I&#39;ve put it on my list to stop by the local game store next payday when we do our errands.<br/>
   <br/>
  Just thought I&#39;d share...<br/>

You can buy extra pads of yahtzee score cards, and might get another  <br/>
Yahtzee game at a thrift store.</div>

Thanks, it was me, and I appreciate all the ideas.  I can&#39;t wait to  start.  <br/>
We got a spell of warm days so we&#39;ve been outside working on the  animals and <br/>
garden (already getting ready for spring!) so the next cold spell  that comes, <br/>
I hope to get started!!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-371979018">Thanks! I knew there were replacement pads out there somewhere! There are some good thrift stores here, I just haven&#39;t really had the chance yet to explore them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648787475">My wife carries a pack of small dice in her purse to play with the <br/>
kids if we are waiting somewhere -- restaurant, etc. We also picked up <br/>
a dice game called Cinq-O at Target that we like because it utilizes <br/>
both addition and multiplication to keep score. A great list of dice <br/>
games can be found at: <br/>
