&gt; And, although this will piss some people off, Hitler did go to heaven<br/>

I&#39;ll still speak to you.<br/>
<br/>
On a serious note, I&#39;m sure there are people who would get pissed. Can&#39;t<br/>
think why, as it&#39;s anybody&#39;s guess (or faith, which comes to the same thing)<br/>
what happens &quot;after&quot;. It&#39;s boring (to me) when people start insisting they<br/>
&quot;know&quot;. That&#39;s probably why I have avoided 99.9% of the religious debate<br/>
here -- a catastrophic lack of fascination on the subject. ;)<br/>
<br/>
The only interest I have is in seeing that all homeschooling isn&#39;t<br/>
overshadowed (in the media, in the public, in their own minds) by<br/>
Fundamentalist Christian homeschoolers. I don&#39;t have the same worries about<br/>
Jewish or Buddhist or Pagan homeschoolers, because there aren&#39;t (that I&#39;m<br/>
aware) organized, large, well-funded groups of them striving to be the<br/>
mouthpiece for All Homeschoolingdom a la Harris and H$LDA.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s about all I have to say about that.<br/>
