<div id="ygrps-yiv-252575171">I&#39;ve been on me jollies for a week and come back to find 37 (yep, <br/>
you can count &#39;em (well you can&#39;t cos I&#39;ve deleted them already, <br/>
but still...)) digests from this group.  There are many things I&#39;d like <br/>
to reply to from these, so before Is tart, I just want to ask, should I <br/>
send them all in one long email, or separate them out into what <br/>
they&#39;re relevant to with appropriate headings, so that readers can <br/>
exercise their power of choice &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Whadd&#39;y&#39;all think?<br/>
