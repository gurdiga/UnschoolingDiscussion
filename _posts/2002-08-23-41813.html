<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825929726">Hi - After watching my kids struggle to sit comfortably and draw or write at<br/>
the kitchen table I had my husband build a huge low table.  I found<br/>
children&#39;s tables you buy too small.  There&#39;s no room on them to spread out<br/>
the art supplies - large sheets of paper and what ever books they may be<br/>
using.  Mine love to copy pictures from encyclopedias.  So I made up the<br/>
dimensions (we figured height by having the tallest sit in a child&#39;s chair<br/>
and seeing where it would hit her best and added an inch or so to take us<br/>
few a couple years) - very deep and long and big enough for two - and he<br/>
built it.  It&#39;s perfect.  Both my 6 and 4 year old sit there voluntarily -<br/>
it&#39;s the place of choice to head off and do things on their own.  For chairs<br/>
I have those public school kindergarten metal with plastic seat jobbies.  I<br/>
have a realtive who is involved in the local schools and apparently they<br/>
throw these things (and desks) out periodically.  We snagged two and they<br/>
were in perfect condition.<br/>
