<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753033986">Kirby was getting a B, after four weeks in his math 99 class (having never  <br/>
had any math lessons of any sort before, and he&#39;s 18).   They had  their first <br/>
test, and he got a 92.  I asked him if that was an A or a B by  their grading <br/>
scale, and he said they didn&#39;t give him a letter, just a number.  &lt;g&gt;  I let <br/>
it go and didn&#39;t tell them there are always letters behind  those numbers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
He has math again today.  I asked him last night whether he had  finished his <br/>
homework, and he said he had.    Since he started  taking classes his <br/>
homework has always been done early.  When I was in  school, mine was NEVER done <br/>
early.  I&#39;ve written papers the morning they  were due and gotten Bs.  But even <br/>
his ill-fated English essay was done a  day and a half before it was due.  I&#39;m <br/>
impressed but I don&#39;t want to make a  big deal with him about it because I <br/>
don&#39;t want him to know it&#39;s unusual, for  one thing.  It would seem that I was <br/>
kind of encouraging him to slack and  stall.   Maybe he&#39;s doing it early because <br/>
he&#39;s also taking a class in  college success.  <br/>
 <br/>
I did want to pass on my outside observations, though.  He&#39;s not  telling me <br/>
as many stories about what happens now that it&#39;s not so new to him,  but he <br/>
did tell us about the 92 on the test, and he&#39;s planning to take more  classes.<br/>
