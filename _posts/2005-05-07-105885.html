<div id="ygrps-yiv-812951661">Changes are occuring in some of our clubs, co-ops, etc. and I can&#39;t <br/>
seem to explain that why I don&#39;t want my children &quot;forced&quot; to fill <br/>
out worksheets or do art.  <br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;COOL&quot; science co-op (started by an unschooler)<br/>
<br/>
Children are doing experiments.  My children are told to stop, when <br/>
they don&#39;t want to and fill out a worksheet.  Most members don&#39;t <br/>
understand why I don&#39;t want to continue with co-op if they are <br/>
forced to write.<br/>
<br/>
In our robotics club.  I RUN THIS but did ask for Moms to sign up <br/>
for fundraising, tshirts, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Art teacher mom wants all kids to draw art work together for t-<br/>
shirts.  I said, why not ask the kids &quot;who wants to create the art <br/>
work for the t-shirts.  She wants to make all kids to draw <br/>
something, even a scribble so they can have &quot;ownership&quot; of the <br/>
artwork.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
HELP!!  <br/>

I would probably ask them to stop the experiment and wait for<br/>
the others to finish their paperwork.  I don&#39;t think I would<br/>
quit the co op if the kids were enjoying themselves.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I started a robotics team last year and three of the parents<br/>
were on the same page with me, letting the kids work at their<br/>
own pace and not to interfere (tell them what and how to do it<br/>
or argue with the children) and two of the parents had way<br/>
too much involvement with the other kids. I had to tell them<br/>
to stop it more than once (the two over controlling parents).<br/>
The other kids did not like these two controlling parents and<br/>
I have decided that I will not invite them back this year (their<br/>
children don&#39;t want to do it anyhow--its not fun for them as<br/>
their parents have put too much pressure on them to perform).<br/>
Yes I expect to have some problems with this but I don&#39;t<br/>
know what else to do because talking to the parents didn&#39;t seem<br/>
to help--ps. one of those parents calls herself an unschooler!<br/>

artwork and t-shirt design.  We encouraged the kids to do draw,<br/>

and then practically did it herself.  For the group drawing<br/>
the kids who wanted to took turns. We had one member who is<br/>
a good artist drew the t-shirt design which everyone voted on.<br/>
We were big on voting--I say we, but the kids did the voting.<br/>
We parents just tried to facilitate and line up mentors and<br/>

Don&#39;t know if you can explain unschooling concepts to these folks.<br/>
Its hard in &quot;class&quot; or group situations.  I tend to organize<br/>
things for myself because that is what I want for my children-<br/>
an unschooling atmosphere where no one is forced to do anything<br/>
they don&#39;t want to.  The best I can do in any class situation<br/>
is to tell my children they don&#39;t have to do X which is usually<br/>
fine in a homeschool situation. If we are involved in something<br/>
non-homeschool or if there are some very specific rules for<br/>
a group then I will tell my kids going in you have to do X if<br/>
you want to participate.  Or sometimes if the situation seems<br/>
flexible enough I would ask that my children not be forced to<br/>
do X.  Hope this helps some.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
-------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Once you get into a class or group situation it&#39;s all over anyway.<br/>
 <br/>
I think unschoolers should go at LEAST halfway if they&#39;re going to be in  <br/>
group situations.  It&#39;s totally unreasonable to expect mainstream people to  <br/>
change their ways to unschooling just because there&#39;s an unschooler there.<br/>
 <br/>
If an unschooler wants to run a situation, don&#39;t fool yourself into  thinking <br/>
it&#39;s natural learning if others have been called to a certain place at  a <br/>
certain time to do something together.  <br/>
 <br/>
Yes, it&#39;s better if they want to be there and yes, it&#39;s better if they have  <br/>
a choice not to participate once they&#39;re there, but it&#39;s still &quot;a class&quot; or &quot;a <br/>
 project.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
-=-If we are involved in something<br/>
non-homeschool or if there are some  very specific rules for<br/>
a group then I will tell my kids going in you have to  do X if<br/>
you want to participate.  Or sometimes if the situation  seems<br/>
flexible enough I would ask that my children not be forced to<br/>
do  X. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve dealt with coordinators directly.  The most structured thing any  of my <br/>
kids has done so far was the junior police academy Marty attended when he  was <br/>
14.  I told the organizers that he doesn&#39;t write very well, and please  to <br/>
give him a break on that.  On the videotape they made for the kids  afterwards, <br/>
one of the shots is of Marty taking notes, but I think the deal was  that <br/>
Marty was popular with them there, and he was INTENTLY taking notes.   He brought <br/>
those notes home and re-wrote them, and still to this day could  probably tell <br/>
you the rules for safe handling of firearms.  (And btw to  this day he still <br/>
hasn&#39;t actually handled a real firearm, though he&#39;s had  opportunities and he <br/>
was the best marksman of that week-long intensive  academy, with simulators <br/>
and paintball guns.)<br/>
 <br/>
When Holly was doing acting and modelling classes, she was VERY into  <br/>
following the dress code and was miffed when others failed to do so.  She  studied <br/>
her scripts HARD before class (partly because she wasn&#39;t reading yet,  and <br/>
partly because she really liked the classes and wanted to do her  best).<br/>
 <br/>
The fact that unschoolers might choose to do a structured activity doesn&#39;t  <br/>
change the activity, but it can gradually and slightly (sometimes radically)  <br/>
change other parents involved, if the other parents aren&#39;t totally oblivious.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  I know that at the dojo where Kirby is still involved, the owner  backed <br/>
off from the driving emphasis on school and grades, and it had to be  largely <br/>
because of Kirby, who had neither and yet was the most dedicated of the  <br/>
kid-students.<br/>
 <br/>
A couple of times I&#39;ve photocopied the interview Emily Subler did with me  in <br/>
Home Education Magazine years back.  It was easier for me because   I could <br/>
point and say &quot;There&#39;s Holly.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
One way I have used other times is to say to the other person, &quot;Have you  <br/>
read much John Holt?&quot;   If they say no, I say well if you had... or  &quot;When you <br/>
do...&quot;  and because I hang around with teacher-types in  hippieville, sometimes <br/>
they HAVE read Holt. &lt;g&gt;  If you&#39;re in  Republican red-neck land, maybe you <br/>
could just excitedly give them a website to  read.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one now!  _<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/holt/teachyourown_">http://sandradodd.com/holt/teachyourown_</a> <br/>

explained the art work, one child had a sparkle in his eye.  I know <br/>
he is a budding artist.  If no one else wants to do the design, why <br/>
not let him?  This could be his moment to shine.  I told the kids <br/>
whoever WANTS to draw a design to do so and the kids will vote.  <br/>
When I asked the moms to pick such tasks as t-shirts, I meant <br/>
whether to order the shirts, print out and iron on the designs <br/>
ourselves, etc.  <br/>

Not only am I in red-neck land, I&#39;m in 700 club land.  Not kidding <br/>
you, I&#39;ve met many homeschoolers that either worked with good ol Pat <br/>
or have lived in his neighborhood.  Obviously I&#39;m glad to be with <br/>
these mostly democrat and of various or no religion at all <br/>
families.  The science co-op worked so well for us for two years.  <br/>
My children don&#39;t want to go anymore and I can&#39;t beleive none of <br/>
these moms understand unschooling concepts at all.  Thanks for your <br/>
