We have a little of that here.<br/>
 <br/>
Marty has a part time job, and it involves learning something very cool he  <br/>
couldn&#39;t go to school to learn. He was named on the website as an  apprentice, <br/>
but when I went to get that just now, the whole page had been  updated.  <br/>
That&#39;s okay.  He&#39;s the only apprentice.  There is a  bookkeeper/advertising guy, <br/>
and occasional seasonal workers.<br/>
 <br/>
The guy who&#39;s making the boots used to be my husband&#39;s squire in the  SCA.  <br/>
We didn&#39;t ask him to give Marty this job at all.  He tried out  three <br/>
teen-to-early-20&#39;s late men to whom he had offered some work temporarily,  and kept <br/>
Marty.<br/>
