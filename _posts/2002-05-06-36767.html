 </span></blockquote>We all had trouble with that one here!  When we read the books we <br/>
pronounced it entirely differently than it is pronounced in the movie. <br/>
 One of my local groups even had a discussion about how it was <br/>
supposed to be pronounced.  We had four or five different ways and <br/>
none of them were the way it is in the movie!<br/>
<br/>
We also know that people who read a lot often mispronounce words they <br/>
have only read and never heard.  My girls would get annoyed if we <br/>
corrected them, until I told them about when I was about 9 and read <br/>
the word  bungalow.  My mom asked what I was reading and I said, &quot;The <br/>
Bungalow Mystery&quot;.  I put the g and l with the a and stressed the <br/>
middle sylable.  Like this: bun-GAL-o<br/>
<br/>
So now whenever I correct the girl&#39;s pronunciation, they say bun-GAL-o <br/>
out loud and remember that everyone needs a little help sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
DH&#39;s word is coincide.  He says it as if he is doing bad things to <br/>
quarters, nichels and dimes.  Coin-i-cide<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985286940">My dh also has trouble with words where you basically have to remember the<br/>
pronuncition because you&#39;d never guess it from the letters--like<br/>
Worcestershire sauce.<br/>
