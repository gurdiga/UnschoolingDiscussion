Everything in our society tells us that children need to be taught, led,<br/>
controlled, shaped and molded.   You need more?<br/>

<br/>
if you go to google and put in<br/>
<br/>
christian discipline homeschool permissive<br/>
<br/>
or stuff like that <br/>
you&#39;ll get snarky assurances that the only reason their children learn is <br/>
they make them, unlike those lazy unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not a lot of criticism out there, though.<br/>
You might also just search for lazy homeschoolers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
That&#39;s the criticism I hear the most from people who are just idly inquiring. <br/>
 &quot;Aren&#39;t you just homeschooling that way because you&#39;re too lazy to write up <br/>
lesson plans?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There used to be one young adult who periodically came to unschooling at AOL <br/>
and ranted about how horrible unschooling was and he should know because he <br/>
was unschooled, but I think he just hated himself and his parents.  He never <br/>
made a good point that I saw.  Just ranted.  And I think, too, that his <br/>
parents were keeping him home against his will.  <br/>
<br/>
I think being made to go to school against one&#39;s will is not much worse than <br/>
being made to stay home against one&#39;s will.  The child will still resist &quot;the <br/>
program,&quot; even if the program is &quot;have a nice life!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Deb is absolutely right about that.<br/>
<br/>
So IF you go and find the things I sent you toward, don&#39;t forget that what <br/>
those people are doing is justifying their own fears and decisions to <br/>
[attempt to] manage their children&#39;s learning, and to control them.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s collect the dumb questions and accusations we&#39;ve all gotten!!  I&#39;ll put <br/>
them on a webpage, so we will create our own anti-unschooling collection, and <br/>
then it can have links to places where people can learn why the objections <br/>
are baseless.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766008664">Thanks. I&#39;ll try that. I got the definite impression that there isn&#39;t <br/>
a lot of criticism out there, when I couldn&#39;t find ANY, in my <br/>
googling, and I clicked around quite a bit in all the pages (quite a <br/>
few of those)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is that Ayn Rand-ish woman who has spoken at the LINK conference<br/>
and been interviewed in the LINK newspaper.  I don&#39;t like her arguments,<br/>
and I&#39;ve forgotten her name.  But she has a website, so she&#39;s findable.<br/>
