<div id="ygrps-yiv-253947529">Having just joined this group in the past 2 or 3 months, I am<br/>
unsubscribing as of this post due to the ridiculous nature of the subject<br/>
matter that has dominated my mail in recent weeks.  What began as an<br/>
informative exchange about unschooling has degenerated into a mudslinging<br/>
contest/ war between Sandra Dodd and a handful of other people.  While I<br/>
am certain that you are fine individuals discussing subjects that are<br/>
relevant to your lives in some context, these subjects have little to do<br/>
with EDUCATING OUR CHILDREN DIRECTLY (I am certain those of you probably<br/>
disagree).<br/>
<br/>
      I have read many posts which basically say &#39;if you don&#39;t like it,<br/>
delete it&#39;, but  frankly it&#39;s taking too much time out of my life even to<br/>
do that these days.   I&#39;m attempting to spend time with my children as<br/>
they learn.  It amazes me to no end that certain members of this group<br/>
are able to spend the time in correspondence that they do (5-10 posts A<br/>
DAY of ever increasing length)!  What do your children do all day while<br/>
you sit in front of the  screen answering the smallest posts?? I realize<br/>
Unschooling is a relaxed educational method, but it still implies at<br/>
least some part of the day being spent learning and growing with one&#39;s<br/>
children.  How do you accomplish this and remain as active as you are in<br/>
cyberspace?<br/>
<br/>
      I believe that as a parent going against the mainstream it is<br/>
critical for myself as well as my children to maintain as positive an<br/>
outlook as possible, and  also to waste as little  energy on<br/>
unconstructive meandering as is HUMANLY POSSIBLE.  Life is short.  We<br/>
have an important job to do.  I do not believe that sitting in front of<br/>
this computer deleting insults and small-minded bickering enhances my <br/>
performance much as a parent, therefore I will look around for other,<br/>
more helpful lists, or simply research the answers I need at my local<br/>
library or with my local homeschool group.     <br/>

<br/>
The forum at www.unschooling.com is the place to go for specific answers and <br/>
topics.  There are topics (which stay on topic) of all sorts and you can <br/>
initiate your own subject area.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not thrilled with the length of the debates either, and it&#39;s a shame to <br/>
have my name singled out, but there are principles and issues which are <br/>
central to the maintenance of info-providing.  Leaving this list certainly <br/>
doesn&#39;t deprive you of the greater and larger benefits of <br/>
www.unschooling.com.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-917688398">I think you are unfairly singled out, sometimes. You<br/>
certainly aren&#39;t the only one with the lengthy debates<br/>
by yourself. But you do usually reply to other<br/>
peoples&#39; debates, even if it started without you, and<br/>
your replies are  usually the passionate kind, so your<br/>
name is one that sticks in thier head when they think<br/>
of debates. And people are on the defense when they<br/>
read anything from you cuz they&#39;ve read your posts<br/>
before and some of them have a certain unintentional,<br/>
I&#39;m sure, undertone to them...When you are simply<br/>
stating your own opinion you just somehow come off<br/>
sometimes like you are saying &quot;my way is right and let<br/>
me tell you why so you can be like me&quot;.<br/>
I know you aren&#39;t saying that and so do alot of other<br/>
people here. I don&#39;t think that anyone should<br/>
unsubscribe or say they are just becuz of you. they<br/>
can just ignore all *your* posts if that was the case.<br/>
Please continue contributing. But please keep in mind<br/>
too, that alot of people are used to the typical<br/>
person who always worries what others think about what<br/>
they are about to say. I also would like to say I<br/>
think it&#39;s cool that you haven&#39;t gotten your feelings<br/>
all hurt by peole singling you out and said &quot;well fine<br/>
then, I&#39;m not going to say anything anymore&quot;.<br/>
