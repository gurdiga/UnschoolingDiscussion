<div id="ygrps-yiv-690175526">Cindy and Johanna---let me tell you my quilting story....<br/>
<br/>
I have been married to my husband for 10 years. I started sewing simple things, curtains, etc. about 9 years ago. My mother-in-law, on the other hand, has quilted for over 20 years. I was never really interested in quilting much and we lived so far apart for so long. Then last October, she moved to the Midwest to be near us (that was a miracle in itself), and now lives four blocks away. By December, I was full swing into quilting!!! <br/>
<br/>
At this time, I have finished quilt #1, putting the binding on quilt #2, sewing the backing on #3, making blocks for #&#39;s 4 and 5, planning #6 and #7 and buying fabric for all the ones I want to make!!! My mother-in-law says I already have a quilter&#39;s heart....I have been &quot;collecting&quot; fabric for years, thinking I would do something else with it, but not really knowing what...guess I was destined to become a quilter! And I&#39;m a machine quilter---don&#39;t have time to hand quilt, but my mil loves to hand quilt (she does both) and keeps insisting that I do it. I&#39;ll have plenty of time when the kids are grown, that is, if I&#39;m not busy playing with my grandkids! <br/>
<br/>
Got to tell you something else really cool---at Home Depot, you know how there&#39;s the &quot;some-assembly-required&quot; type closet organizers, namely Mill&#39;s Pride? If you don&#39;t go to Home Depot often or have never been, I&#39;d suggest you go, because I have found the neatest item, just for storing fabric! Okay, it&#39;s not really intended for fabric, but it is just perfect for fat quarters....it&#39;s a shoe rack! It has 24 little cubbyholes! The Home Depot employee that loaded the boxes onto my rolling cart-thingy thought I had lost my mind! He told one of the other employees that it was to hold my yarn. Of course, I corrected him--how dare he!?! (c;<br/>
<br/>
I bought one, and my mother-in-law bought two and some extra shelves. My husband mounted the shelves between the two shoe racks along the back wall of her sewing room. She&#39;s actually organized with places for FQs and extra yards folded on the shelves!! I&#39;m still working on it, but then again, she&#39;s been collecting fabric for 20 years!! I&#39;d say she&#39;s got a bit more than me!<br/>
<br/>
Gosh, had no intention of babbling on--see what you started!?! Just get me started on my favorite subject and watch out!! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-889987185">Dh sounds like a great guy! He&#39;s every quilter&#39;s dream! And even buying fabric on your honeymoon....he&#39;s a keeper!<br/>
<br/>
The retreats sound great! The quilt shops around here offer classes occasionally and I plan on trying to take a few to expand my abilities. I&#39;m sticking with simple stuff right now until I feel comfortable about moving on. <br/>
<br/>
I started a while back designing one for my son (13). He went with me to pick out the fabric. Now, we&#39;ve decided to do something different, but this time, I&#39;m having him help me design it. He&#39;s a very talented and visual artist for his age and I think he&#39;d really enjoy it more than he knows (and might learn a few things along the way!). I&#39;d really like him to help me piece it, too. I keep telling him it&#39;s like putting a puzzle together. My daughter (11) had two sewing &quot;lessons&quot; from my mil and quit. Said she&#39;s just not &quot;into&quot; it right now, so I&#39;m not pushing it. But...she did choose to go with me to the quilt shop the other day instead of Walmart with her brother....keeping my fingers crossed.<br/>

  &gt; Cindy and Johanna---let me tell you my quilting story....<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
<br/>
  I started quilting when my grandmother decided I was old enough to<br/>
  use a needle and thread!  So at about 6, I made my first &quot;quilt&quot;<br/>
  for one of my dolls - from leftover scraps of the quilt she <br/>
  was working on.  I have a number of quilts that she made and<br/>
  I consider them family heirlooms - even one is really in bad<br/>
  shape.  When she was no longer able to make quilts, I made<br/>
  one for each of my niece and nephews as baby gifts!<br/>
<br/>
  I do mostly machine now - Grandma thought machine was not as<br/>
  good but if I want to get anything done ....<br/>
<br/>
  I have taken 3 art quilt retreats in the past 3 years - they are<br/>
  held at a local store so I don&#39;t have to leave my family!  DH takes<br/>
  off the 3 workdays to stay with our children.  I knew he was the <br/>
  one for me when for a birthday present the first birthday we were<br/>
  together, he took me to a fabric store and said &quot;buy!&quot;  We bought so<br/>
  much fabric on our honeymoon (in Hawaii) that we shipped it home since<br/>
  we didn&#39;t have space in our suitcases for it all.<br/>
<br/>
  Right now a lot of my focus in on making things for my children.  This<br/>
  past winter I started a wall hanging which uses images my daughter drew<br/>
  for me.  She also told me what she wants on a bed quilt.  My son listed<br/>
  the transportation vehicles he wants on his!  I&#39;m a fairly non-traditional<br/>
  quilter and I like the creativity of making my own patterns.  I also<br/>
  dye or paint fabric since then I&#39;m not limited to the colors in the<br/>
  local store!  I&#39;m sure I will involve them more as they get older.<br/>
  They have depths of creativity that amazes me - and it&#39;s great to<br/>
  work on projects together!<br/>
<br/>
  I am also trying to organize my stash.  We used a lot of it as packing<br/>
  material when we moved in the fall so it is jumbled now.  I have a lot<br/>
  of &quot;help&quot; since Megan and Alex like to get some out and run around the<br/>
  house with it!<br/>
<br/>
  It is a passion for me but I want to keep it a hobby.  At the retreat<br/>
  I go to about half of us are hobbyists while others do shows and sell<br/>
  their work.  At this point in my life I want it to stay a hobby.  My<br/>
  children are more important to me than the extra money or the praise<br/>
  of a fickle art world!<br/>
<br/>
  There&#39;s a lot of math skills in quilting (tie in to homeschooling!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781828309">It&#39;s ok to babble once and a while, especially something you are passionate about. To me that&#39;s part of unschooling.  My mom is the one who started me collecting fabric. I made my first quilt for my now 11 yo son. I remember learning  about quilting in home ec class in seventh grade (were talking 1974 here) and I thought it was the most hideous thing I had ever seen. She used the color of the time liberally in big ugly patches. I was always good with needles but intil I discovered a rotary cutter and what it could do I had never quilted. Now all my children have their own quilted blankets. if you have small children, check out the book I mentioned, it is a lovely picture book about sharing. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922037021">A friend&#39;s wife is a quilter.  He is a dyed in the wool garage sale shopper.<br/>
He found a beautiful old wardrobe, about 6&#39; tall and 4&#39; wide.  He had great<br/>
plans to make into a place for their tv and planned to put it in their<br/>
bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
Well, he made the mistake of putting it in the spare bedroom (guess where<br/>
she guilts) until he could get around to putting a special shelf for the tv<br/>
in it.  Now it is the perfect place for storing quilting supplies.  It has a<br/>
high shelf and a low shelf and then has a drawer under the doors.  End of<br/>
