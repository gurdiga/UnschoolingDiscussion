<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631135697">Regarding this comment: &quot;I have been on the other list for over 8 months, <br/>
and never has anybody there<br/>
ever criticized the way anybody unschools.  I was shocked that you all think<br/>
your way is the only way and everybody else is wrong.  Laurie&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is no consensus on this list as to what is the &quot;only&quot; way. It&#39;s <br/>
nowhere near that organized. People here represent a spectrum of beliefs and <br/>
ways of life. But we are often  challenged by some members to think about <br/>
what might happen if we let go and let the kids make more of their own <br/>
choices. You shouldn&#39;t take it as criticism, but just as an invitation to <br/>
examine beliefs you take for granted. Some of the suggestions here I have <br/>
rejected as unworkable for my family (ahem, no one is going for three weeks <br/>
without washing their hair in my house) but others have made me re-examine, <br/>
and change, some things I have believed all my life just out of habit.<br/>
