&gt; people who ignored the slight pain they had in their abdomen and the fever. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Thinking it was just the flu. (Although not a lot of people) And came into <br/>
&gt; the hospital too late, major infections.....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am currently recovering from a ruptured appendix and subsequent emergency <br/>
appendectomy so this is very timely. I actually went to the ER 3 times with <br/>
abdominal pain and a fever and was SENT HOME. By some chance the appendix <br/>
actually burst on my third visit which landed me in surgery. Am anticipating <br/>
separate $50 co-pays for each ER visit. :( <br/>

I would.  I&#39;d say I&#39;d pay for the first one, and if they didn&#39;t like waiving <br/>
the other two how about I get a lawyer and they could also pay for time, <br/>
mileage and childcare.<br/>

on, but that still leaves two. Rest assured, I&#39;m awaiting the bills so I can <br/>
make my phone calls.<br/>
