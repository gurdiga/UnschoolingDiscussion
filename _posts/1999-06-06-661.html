<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064814148">Hey Tami - have him check out the Wheel of Time on the internet.  I <br/>
learned so much about so much stuff by all the websites dedicated to it.  <br/>
Or maybe, since you said you were interested too, you could check it out <br/>
and show him.  Then, maybe he&#39;ll get side-tracked on something <br/>
interesting and really take off.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

     I just heard about that from a friend of mine who also loves the Robert <br/>
Jordan books.<br/>
Did you know there was some active role-playing games on the internet about <br/>
the Wheel of Time too?  I plan on checking them all out when I have time.  I <br/>
know that she told my son to check out the &quot;gray tower&quot;, supposedly for male <br/>
ais Sadea (I know I spelled that wrong).  I don&#39;t know all the details yet, <br/>
but if you want to check it out, she said it is a blast!<br/>

Ok, I don&#39;t know what rock I have been living under, ( the Dragon Ball Z or <br/>
Pokemon rock I believe)! But I don&#39;t know what the heck Wheel of Time is or <br/>
who Robert Jordan is.  I have 8 and 10 year old boys, would this entice them? <br/>
 Is it a good thing?  <br/>
Clueless in Florida!!<br/>

     You haven&#39;t been under a rock.  Alot of people haven&#39;t heard of Robert <br/>
Jordan, including me until a friend turned me onto him.  He is a writer of <br/>
Fantasy Books.  The Wheel of Time is one of his series.  If you like fantasy, <br/>
you will love his books.  They are all about a &#39;light side&#39;  and a &#39;dark <br/>
side&#39; (kind of like Star Wars but not in outerspace with spaceships) and each <br/>
has powers.  There is, of course, a struggle for good to win over evil.  They <br/>
are written for adults, although teenagers usually really enjoy them also.  <br/>
However, they are very thick books, with alot of heavy reading.  They are too <br/>
difficult for your 8 and 10 year olds, (unless they are geniuses!  *smile*).  <br/>
My 17 year old loves them, he has caught up with me, on reading book 6, <br/>
however he does have more time to read then I do.  My 13 year old is trying <br/>
to read book 1, but I think he is going to give up and wait until he is <br/>
older.  He is<br/>
having trouble getting through such a thick book.  You may enjoy them though!<br/>

Tami,<br/>
guess what! I went to the library yesterday to see if I could find some of <br/>
the Holt books and the Wheel of Time.  I am one who needs instant <br/>
gratification! lol.  Well, my 10 year old went to the librarian to ask about <br/>
it, she looked at me and said &quot;We have many copies but they are checked out, <br/>
but I think they would be uh ....a little challenging for  you.  They are at <br/>
least a thousand pages, and in paperback they are huge.  Then she showed him <br/>
some lighter fantasy about dragons which suited him fine.  However, NOW I <br/>
HAVE to get that book!  I love thick books.  I checked out THE MEMOIRS OF <br/>
CLEOPATRA by Margaret George, it is hardback and 964 pages long.  I love it!!<br/>
thanks,<br/>

     Your welcome!  Be warned, the books are very addictive.  I am almost <br/>
done with book #6 and have #7 already out to be read next.  So far, the last <br/>
one I found of the series is book  #8, but it is on the newly released shelf <br/>
so there may be more to come!<br/>
