&gt; Thank you both for the warning ... I&#39;ve never watched Titanic, for the same <br/>
&gt; reasons, and now I know I never want to.......!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A good book fiction book about the titanic is Connie Willis&#39; _Passage_.<br/>
Everything she writes is fabulous.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, this reminds me of Sharon McCrumb&#39;s book _The PMS Outlaws_ where the<br/>
heroine is taking a rest in a psychiatric care facility because her husband<br/>
was lost in a storm in the north sea in a small boat and she keeps hoping he&#39;s<br/>
on an island somewhere. All her roommates keep reminding her of Titanic but<br/>
she&#39;s blocked the ending.  Sharon McCrumb also wrote _Bimbos of the Death Sun_<br/>
a mystery that pokes fun at Sci Fi conventions. She is an incredible story<br/>
teller in person.<br/>
