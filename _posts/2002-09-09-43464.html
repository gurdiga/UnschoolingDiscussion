really IS unschooling even though it doesn&#39;t look like it to other people.<br/>
<br/>
Yes -- every single unschooling child&#39;s life is different - so, yes, <br/>
unschooling is different for every child. But not all ways of living with <br/>
children are unschooling. There are some basic philosophical principles of <br/>
unschooling that are the SAME for all unschoolers.<br/>

purposely tried to find porn on tv -- we have hundreds and hundreds of <br/>

pay-per-view or premium channels we don&#39;t get.<br/>

I caught sight of a couple of exercise programs that could have been a bit <br/>
exciting to watch, though --- healthy goodlooking and scantily clad bodies, <br/>
anyway. That&#39;s all I could find.<br/>

consider soft porn and come to think of it, I guess some would consider just <br/>
plain porn. Full frontal female nudity and back male nudity with lots of <br/>
simulated (at least I&#39;m guessing) sex.<br/>

I have some recommendations:<br/>
<br/>
School-style lessons are neither necessary nor productive.<br/>
<br/>
Parents do NOT know what the child will need to know when he&#39;s grown and <br/>
working.<br/>
<br/>
Learning happens naturally all the time.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Keeping up&quot; with the assembly line at school is not conducive to natural <br/>
learning.  Kids will be ahead in some things and behind in some.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think the certificate of empowerment is still a good description or <br/>
guideline.  There used to be an alternative/critical one floated about years <br/>
ago on AOL.  Anyone remember that or still have it?  I think I later heard <br/>
the author/critic had never once completed a full year of homeschooling, but <br/>
every single year panicked and put her kids in school.  The insistence of the <br/>
counter-one, though, was that teaching was GOOD.  SO!  There&#39;s the result of <br/>
insisting that teaching is good and necessary.  <br/>
<br/>
But anyway, it&#39;s at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/empowerment">http://sandradodd.com/empowerment</a><br/>
and some other places you can google-up at any later date.<br/>
