<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi Dawn,&nbsp; When I first started to gather 
information about home/unschooling , I couldn&#39;t seem to find any resources, 
except farther out from where I lived, which wasn&#39;t convenient for me, but I 
attended a few unschooling meetings 30-40 miles away, just out of curiosity to 
see how people did things, and what it was about for them.&nbsp; This was 
positive for me, as it showed me that people with many different circumstancs 
were successfully, and happily home/unschooling.&nbsp; Then, I collected lots of 
information on the internet, went to many sites, read articles, went to the 
library , and got books, and it seemed just as I put us out there, with the 
determination of unschooling, even without a group, itall began to pour in, come 
to find out their is a local group, quite a number in the surrounding, and 
central area of Puget Sound......I&#39;ve heard of groups in Seattle, Woodinvile, 
Marysville, Everett, Carnation, Monroe, all around actually, and come to find 
out, I had a neighbor this whole time, who also unschools, and I was at a 
friends wedding the other day(who btw doesn&#39;t homeschool, but two of her friends 
do..the islands, all seem to have involved unschooling groups.&nbsp; I&#39;m pretty 
independent from any particular group, but I like to check in and see what&#39;s 
going on in the group world, occasionally, and it seems there ia always 
somewhere to check in at, .......this is my take on it.&nbsp; The laws I 
understand to be excellent.&nbsp; The Northwest is a beautiful place to 
be.&nbsp; Michelle</font></div></html></div>
