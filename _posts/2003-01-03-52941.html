<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time> 2 Jan 2003, at  9:04pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-408304373">I need some ideas for fun stuff to do with kids in the winter that is low or no cost.<br/>
<br/>
I want to share these ideas with the Pa-Unschoolers list, as this is something we are discussing right now.<br/>
<br/>
There is not always snow here, and its cold, dreary, and often rainy, so outside stuff is not often an option.<br/>
<br/>
What kinds of things can we do to avoid cabin fever??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Kristen<br/>
<br/>

Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411651884">When you have snow, or can get to snow, snowshoeing is wonderful because<br/>
you don&#39;t need any special skills to strap on the shoes and go have fun. <br/>
 Rental isn&#39;t expensive and most places offer group rates if you ever get<br/>
together with others for the day.  We went snowshoeing on Christmas<br/>
day... Wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be afraid to tell rental places you&#39;re looking for the best price. <br/>
Tell them you&#39;re homeschoolers, ask for a discount,  you&#39;ll be surprised<br/>
how well it works.<br/>
<br/>
Indoor ice rinks are fun, if you have one in a mall nearby.  <br/>
<br/>
We go to the indoor climbing wall at a mountaineering shop.   The wall is<br/>
fifteen dollars per hour but we only ever paid the full price once, our<br/>
first time, and since then we often go for free, because we know the slow<br/>
times and because Dylan isn&#39;t loud or wild and any friends he takes are<br/>
nice too.   <br/>
<br/>
There are indoor archery ranges, look in your yellow pages or call a<br/>
sporting goods shop. <br/>
<br/>
There are go cart tracks, and while the one near me (54 miles away) is<br/>
outdoor I&#39;ve heard of indoor tracks.  Make an appointment and go as a<br/>
group and get a good rate.  <br/>
<br/>
Paint Ball!<br/>
<br/>
Bowling, if you like that. <br/>
<br/>
Dinner theater.<br/>
<br/>
Hot springs!   Nothing like a skinny dip on a cold and rainy day.<br/>
<br/>
Swimming, in a suit, at the public pool.<br/>
<br/>
Spelunking.  And if no one&#39;s experienced, a guided tour through a cavern.<br/>
<br/>
A one time visit to a belly dancing class.<br/>
Dinner out where said belly dancers entertain. <br/>
<br/>
Hike.  Yes it can be wet, but that&#39;s half the fun.  <br/>
<br/>
Go play basket ball at the community gym.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the police station and get a tour.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the fire department and do the same.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve gone on picnics on the coldest of cold days.   There is a big<br/>
shelter, open at one end with a big fire pit that was built by the snow<br/>
mobile club up at a campground near us.   We&#39;ve gone there on cold day&#39;s<br/>
with thermos&#39;s full of hot soup or stir fry, built a fire,  had fun.<br/>
<br/>
The Forest Service rents cabins for recreational use.  They&#39;re often<br/>
booked during hunting season, but you can get them for just one day,<br/>
build a fire, live like pioneers for a few hours.  Take a deck of<br/>
cards.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Visit an animal rescue center and play with the puppies.   Take them a<br/>
bag of critter food and stay all day.<br/>
<br/>
Visit a ghost town.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the Zoo.  (our nearest zoo is six hours away)<br/>
<br/>
Go to a pet store where they&#39;ll let your kids hold the parrots and<br/>
ferrets.<br/>
<br/>
Call your wildlife biologist and find out where the nearest raptor center<br/>
is.  Go look at awesome birds.<br/>
Or just go talk to the biologist.  He can tell you about great places to<br/>
go watch wildlife.  He&#39;ll give you free posters.<br/>
<br/>
Free posters from the Forest Service office too!<br/>
<br/>
Go see your county extension agent.  They sometimes have cool bug<br/>
collections.<br/>
<br/>
The vet has gross posters about hoof and mouth disease and tape worms and<br/>
wood ticks.   They&#39;re FREE!<br/>
You&#39;re boys will love you!<br/>
<br/>
See how much free stuff you can find in one day!  <br/>
<br/>
Make sock puppets and put on a puppet show.   We still have old paper bag<br/>
puppets from years ago.   Mr. Glad Sack, Mr. Bad Sack, Mr. Mad Sack...<br/>
<br/>
Pull out the sheets and drape your furniture and make tunnels all over<br/>
the house. Your cats will love it too.<br/>
<br/>
Visit a fish hatchery.<br/>
<br/>
Go to a music store and play every instrument.<br/>
<br/>
Go to a game store and play every board game you&#39;ve never seen before.<br/>
<br/>
Video arcade!    They&#39;re still around, one near me still has a Pac Man<br/>
game!  <br/>
<br/>
Go to tall buildings and ride the express elevators.<br/>
<br/>
Go to an underground parking garage and sing, or if you can&#39;t sing howl<br/>
like hyenas. <br/>
<br/>
Find a pond and feed ducks.<br/>
<br/>
Join a gun club and target shoot.<br/>
<br/>
Craft stores offer kid classes.<br/>
<br/>
Home improvement stores offer building projects for kids.<br/>
<br/>
Fiber arts stores let you try their looms.<br/>
<br/>
Electronics stores let you drive the little radio controlled cars.<br/>
<br/>
Visit a cabinet maker.<br/>
<br/>
Make candles.<br/>
Make soap.<br/>
Make ice cream.<br/>
Make paper.<br/>
Make a braid rug.<br/>
Microwave old cd&#39;s then make a mobile.<br/>
<br/>
Paper mache!<br/>
<br/>
Have a barbecue.<br/>
<br/>
Visit art galleries, museums, national historic sites.<br/>
<br/>
Call around to the museums in your area and find out what programs they<br/>
offer.  Get on their mailing lists and go to the events.  <br/>
<br/>
Call the universities and do the same.<br/>
<br/>
Find an astronomy club and go to star parties.  <br/>
<br/>
I have found so many interesting things to do around our little town just<br/>
by talking with people and asking questions.   I ask everyone questions<br/>
about what they like to do, etc.  I have met so many people with<br/>
interesting hobbies who have been happy to share what they know with my<br/>
son and show him their collections.   <br/>
<br/>
The man who runs the local green house, lets us help transplant<br/>
seedlings.  He grows worms too, and lets Dylan dig around in the worm<br/>
beds.<br/>
<br/>
The guy who works at the newspaper speaks Chinese and draws cartoons. <br/>
He&#39;s given Dylan lots of pointers about where to get good paper and story<br/>
boards, etc. <br/>
<br/>
The old guy at the antique shop was a college professor and is a huge<br/>
Montana History buff, whenever Dylan has questions, we go browse the<br/>
antiques. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The lady at the flower shop keeps birds and lets Dylan hold them when we<br/>
visit.<br/>
<br/>
The mayor builds stock cars.  He sometimes drives them to work.  When we<br/>
see one parked on main street we stop in and say hello.<br/>
<br/>
The old guy across the street collects Chalmers tractors and the man at<br/>
the sandwich shop collects John Deere.   They love to show kids their<br/>
toys!<br/>
<br/>
Cool things are everywhere, summer and winter.   David and Dylan went to<br/>
the tennis court on Sunday and tried to play with snow balls.    There&#39;s<br/>
no snow now so what ever we do this weekend will be wet and chilly, but<br/>
we&#39;ll find something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525997636">Wow, Deb!!  This message is worth its weight in gold!  ...Oh.  Well, I <br/>
guess it doesn&#39;t weigh anything, does it.  But if it did, it would be worth <br/>
its weight in gold!  How would you feel about adopting a 45-year-old <br/>
musician and an 8-year-old boy and a 3-year-old cat?  :-)<br/>

Deb! Wow, you are a genius! <br/>

The staples of our wardrobe in the winter are<br/>
rainboots and raincoats. We slodge around outside no<br/>
matter the weather and love it! We also seek out those<br/>
in our community who have interesting hobbies or gifts<br/>
and we get together with them and see what they are up<br/>
to. I have never had anyone turn me away. <br/>

I live in a small town, less than four thousand people, and that includes<br/>
