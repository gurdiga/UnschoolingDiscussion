<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646630538">I&#39;m a newbie to this list, not to unschooling.  I  have been <br/>
unschooling for several years, ever since I found that &quot;school at <br/>
home&quot; doesn&#39;t work for our relaxed and versatile family <br/>
environment.  Since little ones join our family every two years or <br/>
so and we are a family-bedding, nursing on demand, no vaccinations, <br/>
homeschooling in the country family, unschooling seems to be the <br/>
only way for our family to learn.  I had hoped to feel a little <br/>
less &quot;weird&quot; by joining this list, and I have to say I have loved <br/>
the posts the last couple of weeks and feel among kindred spirits, <br/>
so to speak.  With Ned, because of his strong beliefs that might <br/>
annoy others. (I annoy many non-homeschoolers or even mothers who <br/>
vaccinate because of MY strong beliefs) With Sandra and Mary, <br/>
because of their strong beliefs in their children&#39;s learning from <br/>
life.  With all of you because of our common interests.  <br/>
That said, I also love a good debate. I&#39;m sorry, but being at home <br/>
all day with five children (we have 7, two out on thier own)means I <br/>
have very little adult human contact and I truly crave adult <br/>
conversation, albeit via the Internet.   I subscribe to magazines <br/>
for the same reason, my interests ranging from  &quot;Brain Child&quot; <br/>
(magazine for thinking mothers) to &quot;Family Foundations&quot; (magazine <br/>
for couples using natural family planning, or in our case, God&#39;s <br/>
Family Planning), and of course, my favorite homeschooling magazine <br/>
(and the only one I subscribe to!) &quot;Home Education&quot;.  I crave mind <br/>
stimulation even more than I crave chocolate!   <br/>
I may have missed much of the arguing, have only been reading these <br/>
posts for two weeks, but I sensed a kindred spirit in Ned very <br/>
quickly as I once belonged to a list for mothers at home which I was <br/>
the one being asked to leave by a couple of others because my ideas <br/>
about homeschooling offended them.  Somehow, my passion for <br/>
homeschooling and unschooling left them feeling very defensive about <br/>
their own choices to send their children to school.  After leaving <br/>
their group I wrote an essay about this very thing, how some of my <br/>
fledgling friendships have not survived the differences in our life <br/>
choices.  Too many mothers assume that because I have chosen <br/>
homeschooling, or allowing God to plan our family, that I must <br/>
believe their different choices are WRONG.  I do not believe that.  <br/>
I do what works for my family, and those who feel defensive about my <br/>
choices must not be comfortable in their own.<br/>
What does this have to do with Ned?  Well, after awhile, some <br/>
members of thsi previous group took everything and everything <br/>
I &quot;said&quot; in a negative tone, even when I was back-pedalling fast and <br/>
trying to make things right with them.  Nothing I said was looked on <br/>
in a positive light. I hope that after a recent posting of Ned&#39;s, <br/>
everyone will give him the benefit of the doubt and &quot;listen&quot; to what <br/>
he is saying.   He must be a very passionate person about his <br/>
beliefs, and that is a wonderful thing.  And those who have taken <br/>
offense must be very passionate as well.  I love that high interest <br/>
and intelligence in people and hope to continue to see it on this <br/>
list.  But I truly hope one person will not be kicked off the list <br/>
for a bad choice of words or an all-consuming passion, or I might be <br/>
next for not vaccinating my children!  :o)   (or, at least, in <br/>
choosing *fighting words* to villify my beliefs!)<br/>
By the way, I&#39;m 42, and I kind of thought &quot;wussy&quot; just meant someone <br/>
not real brave, or that wouldn&#39;t stand up for what they believe!<br/>
Thanks to all of you for your stimulating conversations lately. <br/>
