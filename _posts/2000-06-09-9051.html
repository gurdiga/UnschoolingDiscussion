<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695839936">When asked this question, I usually trot out what I&#39;ve always thought were <br/>
the tried and true answers.  Colton can learn better one-on-one with me, I <br/>
can shield him from improper influences, etc.  But thinking this through a <br/>
little more carefully, I realize my reasons go a lot deeper.  Here are just a <br/>
few of them.<br/>
<br/>
   I unschool because I was there when my son first held a butterfly.  I <br/>
unschool because it given me time to sit with my son, sewing patches on his <br/>
Scout uniform, while he works on a Pokemon scrapbook and tells me stories.  I <br/>
unschool because I introduced Colton to the wonderful book &quot;Charlotte&#39;s Web,&quot; <br/>
and we both cried when Charlotte died.  I unschool because the moment I found <br/>
out that my father had to have brain surgery, Colton was there with me and we <br/>
could pray together.  I unschool because when I battled cancer and <br/>
chemotherapy, Colton and I could snuggle together in bed and read living <br/>
books, and he would remind me that I had just eleven more treatments to go.  <br/>
I unschool because I am head-over-heels in love with this tender soul who <br/>
came into my life not quite ten years ago, and I don&#39;t want to miss a minute <br/>
of it.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
