<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487878578">I am going to book my 11 1/2 year old daughter on an adventure Youth <br/>
Hostel holiday. It is for a week and there are lots of different <br/>
activities. She enjoys drama, filming etc so I was going to book her on <br/>
the media film and tv one after I read it to her and she liked the <br/>
sound of it. This is an hour from where we live and they take them on <br/>
the coach. <br/>
Then her cousin called and is trying to persuade her to do the <br/>
performing arts one in London (5/6 hrs away) - as she wants to have <br/>
someone there that she knows (she is 14). I think my dd might like to <br/>
do the performing arts one too but feels I&#39;d rather she did the course <br/>
closer to home. I suppose my concern is she&#39;s never done anything like <br/>
this before (going away with people she doesn&#39;t know) and if she hates <br/>
it it is nearer for me to pick her up. I don&#39;t want to stand in her way <br/>
but now I worry how will I know if she&#39;s picking the course she wants <br/>
or is being influenced by me or her cousin?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-450632769">I&#39;d just let her make the choice and not worry if she&#39;s choosing the course because she wants to be with her cousin.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes adults compromise on their first choice because it&#39;s more important to have the company of the other person.  Husband and wife choosing to go on vacation, for example.  <br/>

I would talk directly to the cousin and tell her your concerns and ask her  <br/>
to back off for this year and maybe next year they could both go the one in  <br/>
London.<br/>
 <br/>
Would the cousin come and do the near one?  They&#39;re related fields,  and it&#39;s <br/>
safer and easier for a 14 year old to travel that far than an 11 year  old.  <br/>
 <br/>
Holly went a couple of years to weeklong workshops (not all day, and not  <br/>
overnights) by an artist here who used to have a TV show for kids, Mark  Kistler. <br/>
 Holly had to have an adult with her, so she invited her cousin  who&#39;s seven <br/>
years older to come and be the adult.  They allowed that, which  was cool <br/>
(Gina was still a teen) because Gina had been a HUGE Mark Kistler fan  from when <br/>
she was little, and is a good artist partly from the things she  learned on his <br/>
TV show.  That&#39;s their best cousin-shared thing, and they&#39;ll  probably <br/>
remember it always.<br/>

(I&#39;m jumping back to a prior post on this thread.)<br/>
<br/>
The difference between compromising on vacation plans with one&#39;s husband and with one&#39;s cousin, is that I sincerely hope the husband wouldn&#39;t find one or more 14 year olds to hang out with and ditch the person that he came with.  &lt;g&gt; However, I can easily imagine 14 year olds giving in to peer pressure and leaving out the 11 year old cousin.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237091470">Thanks for your replies. I talked to dd and read her the specs on both <br/>
courses. She much prefers the London one! I am going to book her on it. <br/>
It is safe as they are picked up at Manchester (where we live) and <br/>
accompanied by the staff of the youth hostel to pick up other kids <br/>
doing the same holiday (the coach is only for these kids). I&#39;ll give <br/>
her plenty of money and her mobile topped up. I think she&#39;ll have a <br/>
great time. They get to see 2 west end shows, street performers and <br/>
learn acting. I don&#39;t want to suggest her staying here because I worry <br/>
she may be too young. Her excitement about it is contagious. Hope it <br/>
all works out ok! No her cousin would not come up here (the one dd is <br/>
going to is one hour from her cousins house). TBH dd would go to that <br/>
regardless of her cousin going which wouldn&#39;t apply the other way round <br/>
(I don&#39;t think).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-99941390">The child may not have any knowledge of the meaning of<br/>
the word, &quot;division&quot;, yet clearly understands the<br/>
process of organizing something into smaller pieces,<br/>
or divisions. &lt;snip&gt; The child doesn&#39;t need to know<br/>
that it can be called division or math in order to<br/>
have the thought process.(this was from Mary Ellen&#39;s<br/>
entry on sandradodd.com &quot;Believing it...)<br/>
<br/>
I understand this.  I live this.  Sadly, I argue this<br/>
with my husband almost daily.  I can&#39;t &#39;make&#39; him stop<br/>
&#39;schooling&#39; Ellis when they are together.  Or when we<br/>
are together.  He will come home and ask, &quot;What has<br/>
Ellis been doing?&quot;  If I say, &quot;playing computer&quot; or<br/>
&quot;watching TV&quot; or &quot;playing in his room&quot;, there is<br/>
significant huffing, puffing and eye-rolling which<br/>
leads to me huffing, puffing, eye-rolling and<br/>
defending.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is deeply anti-schools for his precious son<br/>
(and rightly so).  Yet he turns almost everything into<br/>
&#39;school.&#39;  Comments like &quot;He has to go DO something -<br/>
it&#39;s no good for him to stay in all day.&quot;  &quot;I had him<br/>
count his money - we need to keep doing that so he<br/>
doesn&#39;t forget.&quot;  To me, it&#39;s all irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>
If Ellis wants to play with money, he has a piggy bank<br/>
and can do so.  He creates elaborate games with each<br/>
coin type being a certain type of player.  He does not<br/>
invite anyone to play these games with him, usually. <br/>
On the occasions that he&#39;s asked his dad, I overhear<br/>
&quot;What does that piece do?  Why?  (and the WORST!) It<br/>
SHOULD do THIS.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I hate that one.  There is a passive-aggressive power<br/>
struggle going on.  I would like it to stop.  I&#39;ve<br/>
forwarded articles, provided links, suggested ideas,<br/>
crafted careful &quot;I&quot; messages, flat out griped.  I am<br/>
running out of ideas on how to end this short of<br/>
giving in.  And that ain&#39;t gonna happen because this<br/>
is right for Ellis.  Every part of me feels that.<br/>
<br/>
So how do I get my husband from &#39;there&#39; to &#39;here&#39;?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923434987">**So how do I get my husband from &#39;there&#39; to &#39;here&#39;?**<br/>
<br/>
No parent is perfect (although my husband is darned cute).<br/>
<br/>
Within the last hour I just busted my husband for giving our kid too <br/>
long and too confusing a lecture in response to an abstract question <br/>
(&quot;why is this called the 21st Century?&quot;).  This question WAS asked by my <br/>
kid.  I was certainly not perfect in noodging and shushing my husband <br/>
right in front of my son when the answer kept getting longer and harder <br/>
to follow.  My husband at least got it half right.  He was answering a <br/>
specific question FROM our child.  He paused the video (even tho&#39; it was <br/>
&quot;educational&quot;! &lt;g&gt;) to make himself more audible.  He attempted to be <br/>
simple and concrete in his explanation, even though the subject is <br/>
abstract and confuses adults.  Where it went off the rails is that when <br/>
my son became confused and was trying to express himself &quot;but wait..&quot; or <br/>
&quot;I think..&quot; or &quot;the way it is (in my head)...&quot;, at that point my husband <br/>
didn&#39;t stop trying to put HIS point across.  When getting feedback like <br/>
that, I believe it would have been better if my husband had stopped his <br/>
exposition and listened to the questions and validated or clarified the <br/>
ideas that my son had and then adjusted the rest of his explanation at <br/>
that point.  If I hadn&#39;t been right next to him, with my magnifying <br/>
glass of scrupulous unschooling zeal, probably no regular parent would <br/>
have detected a &quot;parenting fault&quot; in the conversation.  The whole <br/>
dynamic would certainly have been simpler if I hadn&#39;t been sitting right <br/>
there, waiting for the video to resume, and highly motivated to butt <br/>
in.  Even though my husband was trying to be gentle and kind in his <br/>
explanation, AND I was trying to be gentle and kind in my butting in <br/>
(honest!), my son still became distressed and had to go take a bath to <br/>
calm down.  At that point we had to admit that ... um... well... <br/>
parenting errors have been committed on all sides.  While our son was <br/>
out of the room, dh and I were able to have a calm conversation about <br/>
the reality that learning shuts down when people are confused.  But my <br/>
husband should get extra points for being willing to attempt confusing <br/>
answers.  And I should not try to skate through life with &quot;I can&#39;t <br/>
explain it -- go ask your dad&quot; as my strategy of choice.  (A small <br/>
exaggeration, but those words have passed my lips.)<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line -- perfection is out there in front of all of us.  We need <br/>
to believe we can reach it or at least approach it.  We need to keep <br/>
moving in that direction, while not letting an awareness of our flaws <br/>
weigh us down so much that we stop believing in our potential to be good <br/>
at this parenting stuff. (Or our spouse&#39;s potential to be good at this <br/>
parenting stuff.)<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  Back more directly to your question -- maybe your husband is not <br/>
grasping the importance of *intrinsic* motivation, coming from within <br/>
the person?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-566042345">&quot;Why is this called the 21st century?&quot; is like &quot;Where do babies come from?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He could&#39;ve just said &quot;the first century was in the double digits&quot;   (from <br/>
inside their moms) and let the kid think about it, or ask a follow-up question.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard that in China their birthdays are counted unlike ours, and <br/>
someone is called one (or &quot;in his first year) UNTIL birthday, and then is in his <br/>
second year.<br/>
<br/>
Makes sense.   Confusing, but when we say &quot;two years old,&quot; half of that year <br/>
is closer to three than two.<br/>
<br/>
Little answers with one more point help in LOTS of cases.   <br/>
Let them ask more if and when they want to.   Some parents end up explaining <br/>
sexual intercourse the first time the kid asks where babies come from.   <br/>
Rarely, the kid actually asked all that many questions, and they could&#39;ve waited <br/>
hours, or days, or years. <br/>
<br/>
With counting time, it might (Or might NOT) help (if there&#39;s ever a followup) <br/>
to mention that we say &quot;the first week&quot; (of a month or a job) before a week <br/>
is up, and &quot;the first millenium&quot; is 1-999, and the second millenium is <br/>
1000-1999.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s too much to tell a kid at once, though.   It was too much for me to <br/>
think of at once.   I need to rest now.<br/>

Yes.  He&#39;s a school teacher most of the year, and is just transitioning back from that for the summer.  I think that makes it hard for him not to take a &quot;teachable moment&quot; and beat it to death! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I have to think that some smart people just know too much.  My husband&#39;s expository speech included the fact that zero wasn&#39;t one of the first numbers invented, touched on the recent Millennium, included the buzzword &quot;fencepost error&quot;, and an actual fence illustration made of fingers.  He mentioned computer programming, and almost, but not quite talked about the fact that the C programming language indexes arrays starting at zero rather than at one!  (But he stopped short of that, thankfully!)  Me interrupting a couple of times did not actually make the whole presentations any less complicated, in the end.<br/>
<br/>
I hope it&#39;s not a *really long time* before my son asks another question, but I am a little worried.  (They&#39;re in the computer room gaming and chatting, so I think their relationship is still strong.)<br/>
<br/>
My son is 11, with a pretty complex vocabulary, so it&#39;s not like this was poured onto the head of an innocent 7 year old.  But it was still too much!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like he&#39;s *not* going to read your forwarded articles and<br/>
such, so the above might be a great opportunity to help him &quot;see it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What has Ellis been doing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He did some pretty complicated problem-solving this morning --<br/>
mapping and spatial skills, a maze, putting together two elements to<br/>
form a new strategy on &lt;insert video game name here&gt;.  There was a lot<br/>
of social stuff, too -- he had to make appropriate decisions for the<br/>
character, and he learned the hard way that he has to think of his<br/>
team in this game.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or &quot;We had a nice little discussion about Japanese food while we were<br/>
watching Pokemon this afternoon.  And I could really see him relating<br/>
when Ash didn&#39;t get a badge on his first try.  It was so neat to see<br/>
him have a chance to process this stuff in his own comfort zone, here<br/>
at home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or &quot;He&#39;s been having one of those great, totally absorbing days<br/>
playing with his cars in his room.  I saw him set up a pretty<br/>
complicated pattern to get them in and out of the bad guys&#39; hideout.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You could even start keeping a journal about your days, and taking<br/>
some pictures to fill it in, if you were so inclined.  Then you&#39;d have<br/>
something to point to when your husband&#39;s questions caught you off guard.<br/>
<br/>
If your husband still translates the above as &quot;just staying home,&quot;<br/>
then I might really ask and validate and use all your NVC (non-violent<br/>
communication, if you need to Google it) skills.  Don&#39;t try to defend<br/>
or argue -- just question and ask for clarification.  Just let him<br/>
talk out all his concerns and validate how hard that must be for him.<br/>
 I suspect he&#39;ll talk the wind out of his own sails at some point (if<br/>
that analogy works?).<br/>
<br/>
I say this because what you said above sounds like the two of you are<br/>
in a pattern, and he&#39;s pushing back because it&#39;s what he&#39;s supposed to<br/>
do.  If you give him nothing to push against, he&#39;ll have to hold his<br/>
own weight up, so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t mean that you should let him &quot;school&quot; your son.  Again, I<br/>
would question and reflect, as nicely as you can, and try to give him<br/>
the scoop on some situations before they become issues -- <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Are you asking (a schooly-sounding question) because you&#39;re afraid<br/>
that Ellis doesn&#39;t know, or because you honestly wanted to know?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not sure how Ellis feels, but I&#39;m too tired to talk about the<br/>
Revolutionary War right now -- I&#39;d rather snuggle and watch SpongeBob.<br/>
 How about you, Ellis?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Before they sit down to play the coin game:  &quot;Does it bother you if<br/>
Ellis uses a coin as something other than it is? He&#39;s really been<br/>
using his imagination in making up this game, but he has changed the<br/>
meanings of some of the coins.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
And you might even ask Ellis himself how he feels about his dad&#39;s<br/>
&quot;schooling,&quot; in a gentle, open way.  Depending on your family<br/>
dynamics, Ellis can tell his dad how he feels (with you facilitating,<br/>
if need be), or you can be the messenger.  I would just introduce it<br/>
very carefully (&quot;this is hard for Ellis to say but he really wants you<br/>
to know how he feels because he loves you and wants a good<br/>
relationship with you&quot;) -- you want to open discussion, and that&#39;s<br/>
hard to do if someone feels they&#39;ve been deliberately hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533048838">Thank you, everyone, for the great suggestions and<br/>
stories about your experiences.  I am going to try the<br/>
journal idea although it may require more dedication<br/>
to paper than I typically manage. :)  It&#39;s worth it if<br/>
I can help my sweet husband to see what I&#39;m saying.<br/>
<br/>
He and I had a relatively distant day today but Ellis<br/>
and I had a blast!  We built marble racetracks out of<br/>
blocks.  Then he had an idea about using the marble to<br/>
knock down dominoes so he skittered to his room to get<br/>
them.  Then he figured out how to line them up so they<br/>
could get knocked down.<br/>
<br/>
Later we had a language lesson that he gave on German,<br/>
Spanish, French and Japanese courtesy of his LeapPad,<br/>
a great trip to the grocery store and &quot;dinner and a<br/>
movie&quot; night, watching The Jetsons Movie (which has a<br/>
pretty interesting &#39;responsible<br/>
business-environment-exploitation&#39; message).  After<br/>
that, we went into his room to get ready for bed and<br/>
he told me all about the planets and their orbits and<br/>
ran a quiz show for me with multiple choice questions<br/>
that he made up (e.g., &quot;The earth&#39;s crust is made of<br/>
a) grass, b) soil, c) bowling balls, or d)<br/>
elephants&quot;).  We made a glow-in-the-dark mobile of<br/>
spaceships and astronauts, he read me a book, I read<br/>
him a book, he got his favorite lullaby and that was<br/>
the day.<br/>
<br/>
Did I mention that he&#39;s six?  He just astonishes me<br/>
all the time.  I think that&#39;s what I would love for my<br/>
honey, his daddy, to enjoy, too - just the fun of<br/>
being around this sweet little boy who is sunshine in<br/>
human form.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, for all your ideas-<br/>
<br/>
(a much-relieved) Kathy<br/>
