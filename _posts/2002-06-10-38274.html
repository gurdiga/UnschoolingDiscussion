&lt;&lt; Since you can&#39;t look at the eclipse even through the lens of a camera or <br/>
 telescope &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can if it has a Sun filter on it!!<br/>
I will view it through my monocular, purchased through the Astronomy <br/>
club.....and yes, complete with a good Sun filter.<br/>
Check with Astronomy clubs, they usually can point you to proper Sun filters. <br/>
It makes  viewing the sun at any time completely doable.<br/>
