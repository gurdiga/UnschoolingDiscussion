<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045259915">***Ms. Superiority strikes again.  Did anybody say these book <br/>
recommendations were for kids and does that really matter? and does it<br/>
really matter if those kids are schooled or unschooled? and did anybody say<br/>
or even infer that one should stop at either of those references and shut<br/>
the book, declaring them the gospel? NO.  ANY person that knows squat about<br/>
unschooling knows that one resource is rarely the &#39;end all, be all&#39;.<br/>
Sandra has plenty of opportunities to voice her opinion here and elsewhere<br/>
(HEM, for instance) and that is not so much my point as is the fact that she<br/>
chooses to belittle so many other peoples&#39; suggestions, ideas and<br/>
opinions.***<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people don&#39;t like fairness and honesty (G-d knows I have been one of<br/>
them, and it&#39;s been part of my attempt at evolution NOT to be. &quot;I&#39;m getting<br/>
better.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I could reduce this to name-calling, too, but that doesn&#39;t seem useful (to<br/>
me or to anyone here), so I&#39;ll keep it to this request:<br/>
<br/>
Rather than posting &quot;we don&#39;t need&quot; (referring to this list), please post<br/>
for yourself. And it would be REALLY nice (though probably totally<br/>
unrealistic of me to ask) if you could keep the topic on the IDEAS of Sandra<br/>
or me or anyone else, rather than about your like or dislike of the person<br/>
involved, and rather than calling people Ms. Superiority, or bands of merry<br/>
makers, or Boogerheads for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
Pam, you can call me &quot;Al&quot;</div>
