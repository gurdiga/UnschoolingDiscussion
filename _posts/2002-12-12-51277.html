<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193115020">Our bed time ritual is pretty basic.  We watch night time tv and the kids get there blankets and lay down on the floor.  We snuggle and then they fall asleep and we put them to bed.  This works best for us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-7038834">The only real bedtime ritual we have is with my toddler. Usually around 6pm he takes a fun bath and splashes and plays until I am soaked and the floor is soaked. lol When he is finished, I get him dryed off and into a comfy cloth diaper and his soft jammies. He then cuddles up to nurse while I read him a story. Usually within about 20 minutes he is out cold. He will then sleep until about midnight when he wakes to nurse again. (He still gets up 3 or 4 times a night to nurse) <br/>
 My other three sons pretty much go to bed when they are ready too. Logan usually stays up pretty late, other than work nights. He has held down a job for about 9 months now and knows that if he stays up late he is no good for work the next day. Andrew is usually out around 11pm unless he is engrossed in a book or a movie. Alexander, like clockwork is out cold by 10pm. His favorite place to sleep is on the livingroom couch. lol <br/>
