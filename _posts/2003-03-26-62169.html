<div id="ygrps-yiv-838205545">*** Do you think that they can be exposed daily to the<br/>
ads without falling for them?***<br/>
<br/>
What if they fall for it?    If the ad is true and they buy the product<br/>
and it preforms exactly as promised isn&#39;t that ok?   If the ad was<br/>
deceiving and the product doesn&#39;t measure up aren&#39;t they smart enough to<br/>
take note?<br/>
<br/>
I think the only way to learn some things aren&#39;t what they appear to be<br/>
is by experience.<br/>
If you could protect them from advertising until they&#39;re grown they&#39;re<br/>
still going to have to shop for themselves someday and would still be<br/>
susceptible to slick packaging.<br/>
<br/>
I know adults who spend their money on some really foolish things, but my<br/>
son has become quite the critical consumer.    He used to believe every<br/>
advertisement and we still smile when we think about the &quot;Downey ball&quot;<br/>
fabric softener, because he was SO sure we couldn&#39;t live without one.  <br/>
He did buy a few things he was disappointed in but he really thinks about<br/>
how to spend his money and he considers carefully before buying.<br/>
<br/>
I think television advertising is a great opportunity to talk about<br/>
consumerism.  Why are they trying to sell it to you?  Because they want<br/>
your life to be better?  Because they want your money?   Who makes that<br/>
product and how much do they earn if you buy it?    Are those jeans worth<br/>
$125.00 if the person who sewed them only made $1.85 that day and the<br/>
fabric only cost six dollars?   <br/>
Your kids will see you make smart choices or silly ones and you can talk<br/>
about how you came to those choices and that will be beneficial to them.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention the psychology in advertising.  That&#39;s wonderfully<br/>
interesting.   <br/>
<br/>
OH, we have company, have to go!<br/>

Better to practice on breakfast cereal and toys than on cars and Smirnoff&#39;s.<br/>

I laugh at that, my son cried when he got his shirt dirty at the age of 3, <br/>
because we didn&#39;t have a &quot;stain-ball&quot; that would get it clean. We had just <br/>
gotten the satellite dish and he was really watching the ads. That was when <br/>
we started talking about them.<br/>
I think he has a pretty good handle on the ad world now at age 7.Still thinks <br/>
some of the stuff looks good, and that is ok.<br/>
