&lt;&lt; I can&#39;t just enjoy the book, knowing that later I&#39;ll be &quot;tested&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just lately I read a book (Cinnamon Gardens) and really enjoyed it!  Than at <br/>
the end there was a list of discussion questions, I guess for readers&#39; groups <br/>
that might not be able to think of good questions on their own or something.  <br/>
Some of them were reasonable questions.  Some were &quot;DUH!&quot; (no one could have <br/>
come to the end without having thought those things), and some were not good <br/>
questions.   Just like the questions after a short story in a high school <br/>
literature book.  And for me, that cast a sad pall over what had been a great <br/>
novel.<br/>
<br/>
It would also have enabled book club members who didn&#39;t really read the whole <br/>
book to skim for the passages which would be discussed at the club meeting.<br/>
<br/>
So I wonder to what extent readers&#39; clubs are fulfilling needs in the members <br/>
to continue what they did well in school, or to finally do well what they <br/>
failed to accomplish well in school, or to use other people to pressure them <br/>
into reading since they were &quot;trained&quot; to read only with deadlines and <br/>
reporting requirements and tests.<br/>
