<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721087870">You&#39;ll have to do the best you can based on the placement of the planets in<br/>
the correct line.  Perhaps the reason you can&#39;t find anything is that it<br/>
isn&#39;t possible to do it correctly.  (Those ones we used to view in school<br/>
were dramatically WRONG).  The scale of the sun versus the planets would<br/>
require that you place the balls either miles apart from each other or have<br/>
styrofoam balls the size of an atom.<br/>
<br/>
It will help in understanding the relationship of the planets to the sun,<br/>
but I&#39;d recommend giving up on trying to make it even close to accurate.<br/>
<br/>
Try www.solarsystem.com for the proper placement.  They also have some cool<br/>
graphics you could follow to paint your planets.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362931830">Our daughter built a solar system model from a package she bought at Hobby <br/>
Lobby. We had directions from a library book and went to buy the Styrofoam <br/>
balls and dowel rods at Hobby Lobby when I found it all pre-packaged. The <br/>
directions gave the colors of paint and all. But since I am an avid crafter, <br/>
I didn&#39;t buy extra paints, we just &quot;did with&quot; what I had in my supplies at <br/>
home. I think it turned out really great! (even if it isn&#39;t to scale! &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
