<div id="ygrps-yiv-755216129">**My children have few restrictions, but that is one they do have. They <br/>
havent <br/>
really ever expressed any interest in guns though. Thank goodness!**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a parent for almost 23 years now. For over two decades of parenting <br/>
time I said and believed that I would NEVER allow a toy gun in my home, for <br/>
all of the usual philosophical reasons. Mostly though I was lucky to have <br/>
children who did not show persistent interest in toy weaponry.<br/>
<br/>
However, as of May of last year there is now resident in my home a bright red <br/>
cap gun pistol.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest son convinced me to allow him to spend some of his eighth <br/>
birthday gift money on the gun. At least part of that decision was based on <br/>
the fact that he has been more persistent than any of my other children in <br/>
his desire for guns and gun play. He is known as the boy who can make a gun <br/>
out of anything.<br/>
<br/>
The most interesting side effect of the purchase has been that his gun play <br/>
decreased dramatically after the first month, to a point where I have noted <br/>
that weeks go by now without guns being made out of KNex and the cap gun has <br/>
needed to be dusted off before use. <br/>
<br/>
His desire for a pocket knife was our newest challenge. :) Unfortunately, in <br/>
the last few decades pocket knives have changed from being a normal <br/>
possession of most middle childhood boys. We live in a moderately populated <br/>
area with a violent gang problem. We have to be careful where we allow our <br/>
son to carry his knife, especially as he approaches puberty and begins to be <br/>
more suspect just for being male and young. :( <br/>
<br/>
His knife is not a toy though, it&#39;s a tool that he&#39;s putting a lot of time <br/>
into mastering.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870203240">isn&#39;t that sad? We have a bit of a gang problem here<br/>
too. (sandra laughs in the background at the term &quot;a<br/>
bit&quot;) Where I live in town now isn&#39;t bad at all, but<br/>
when I was Las Cruces (where what i call &quot;real gangs&quot;<br/>
are, as a family tradition passed down from generation<br/>
to generation) and ds was little I had to be very<br/>
careful about dressing him in red or blue sports<br/>
teams, etc. I dread when he is old enough to be<br/>
suspected as you say just for being male and young. I<br/>
feel so bad for the boyz in this town (and elsewhere<br/>
of course) who grow up not having the respect shown to<br/>
them and therefore taught to them to show to others,<br/>
and who it really is just a coming of age thing to<br/>
become a troublemaker or to carry a knife AS a weapon.<br/>
:(<br/>
My son has a knife that my dad was saving to give to<br/>
him when he was older, and that he automatically<br/>
inherited when dad died. He&#39;s only allowed to use it<br/>
in front of a grown up right now, but thanks to dad,<br/>
is pretty good at carving (whiddling  ?sp?) stuff for<br/>
a 5 yr old. Looks fun to me. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959601294">As an adult I haven&#39;t really had any &quot;contact&quot; either,<br/>
(cuz I&#39;ve learned that if you treat people<br/>
respectfully, even if they are what some people might<br/>
consider &quot;dangerous&quot; (and are in thier gang activity)<br/>
that they leave you alone.)....except in Cruces, like<br/>
I said. But when I was younger (as in<br/>
teenagerhood...last almost years of which were spent<br/>
as a mommy) it didn&#39;t matter where I went or what I<br/>
wore or how nice I was, I was sought out and picked on<br/>
cuz I was a &quot;little white girl&quot; hanging out in the<br/>
&quot;wrong&quot; place apparently. Fortunately for my safety,<br/>
my ex-husband made &quot;friends&quot; with everyone everywhere<br/>
and I was thereby spared. (Someone said he was the<br/>
only <br/>
white spanish-speaking black asian guy they knew).<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean to make it sound like Alb was this<br/>
horrible dangerous place. I feel safer here than I<br/>
ever did in Phx, and our statistics show our gang rate<br/>
is third in the nation or something like that. (I<br/>
think)<br/>
