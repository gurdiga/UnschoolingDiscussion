I like it - it is a pretty superficial overview of the topics, but always has <br/>
some cool pictures and a few interesting bits of information, along with the <br/>
basics. I told her that it suits me because I have an urge these days to <br/>
learn just a little bit about a lot of things that I know almost nothing <br/>
about. She said she has the opposite urge, these days, she wants to just <br/>
learn a whole lot about a few things. We just sort of grinned - how different <br/>
people can be, etc. Then she said, &quot;Well, truth is I want to learn a whole <br/>
lot about pretty much everything, but I can see that it isn&#39;t going to be <br/>
possible in one lifetime to do that so I&#39;m going to have to be selective.&quot;<br/>

She&#39;s 14. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-884843638">Ahh, thank you Marianne. I had heard something about a romance novel<br/>
relating to California, but was missing the crucial piece that there was<br/>
a Queen Califia there. Cool. So it was all about Hollywood fantasy from<br/>
the earliest times! ;)<br/>

Glad you came out to let me know. Unschooling in my opinion is what<br/>
works best about any other &quot;methods that work&quot; - along with clearing up<br/>
a child&#39;s confusions about language and words and what they mean. If you<br/>
really can et into discussing things with your child, it becomes easy in<br/>
my view, as there is the whole world to talk about and your kids will<br/>
have very interesting things to say and insights of their own if you are<br/>
listening. IT&#39;s the best! How old are your kids?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-305484705">Hi Deb,<br/>
Glad to be able to contribute re: California&#39;s history.  I have one daughter, 15 1/5, who has been learning at home since I pulled her out of PS after second grade.   At that point she hated school and was sure she was  a failure  (at the ripe old age of 8).   She is still, to this day, somewhat math-phobic, but otherwise has a great attitude about her education as long as I don&#39;t put a textbook in front of her.   *smile*<br/>
