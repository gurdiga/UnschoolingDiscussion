 </span></blockquote>We recently learned about a Costa Rica service trip that is in very early <br/>
January, 2005.  We can&#39;t do it this year but it sounds wonderful.  A family from <br/>
North Carolina is taking teens including their own to work and also do some <br/>
sightseeing. It&#39;s their second year doing this trip.<br/>
<br/>
The contact information I have is Mike and Marianne Carruth<br/>

Looks like they will be flying out of Atlanta, Georgia.  Good luck with your <br/>
search.<br/>

Volunteers for Peace is one that my daughter is looking into, they do have programs for teens travelling without parents.<br/>

I have talked with a mother of a teenage homeschooler who has done this program, and her daughter raved about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-52769264">As I was reading this I kept thinking of two things - first, that I also<br/>
have a lust for travel and second, my god, I&#39;d love to have an educated<br/>
person showing my kids some new things. Wouldn&#39;t it be great to have a group<br/>
where people who love to travel can sort of trade sharing their stories and<br/>
experience for a place to stay - the reason I was thinking this is that we<br/>
open our extra rooms to people who want to stay here as we live close to<br/>
Aspen and other ski areas in Colorado and the people who stay with us always<br/>
add to our experience. Oh boy - I just looked at the date on the original<br/>
email - I&#39;m so behind on my lists. <br/>
