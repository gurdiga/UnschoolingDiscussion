<div id="ygrps-yiv-42503365">Howdy all.  I am newbie on this e-list. My name is D.J.<br/>
(That is short for the Texan moniker of Donna Jean, but the only person<br/>
to ever call me that was my mother when she was angry with me).<br/>
<br/>
I am a homeschooling mother of 4.  I am very interested in how children<br/>
learn and facilitating that.  My experience has been that most people<br/>
want to meddle a lot with kids&#39; cognitive processes, thinking that it<br/>
enhances learning.  One would hope they would infer that there is a<br/>
reason in the radical drop in children&#39;s learning from age 5 on.<br/>
Children absorb a tremendous amount of information, completely<br/>
untutored, between the ages of 0 and 5.  The entire acquisition of<br/>
language usually takes place during that time, with absolutely NO formal<br/>
<br/>
instruction whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
For some odd reason, our society seems to think 5 the perfect age to<br/>
start &quot;formal&quot; education, and, concomitantly, the learning drops off at<br/>
a plummeting rate once formal education is introduced.  Were kids&#39;<br/>
brains a money making venture, the idiot that employed that strategy<br/>
would have been fired long ago.  But, alas, they are only kids and its<br/>
only their brains -- so presumably, they&#39;ll get over it. (NOT!)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I sound a little cynical in my intro, but so few people<br/>
understand how learning takes place.  Digesting what is encountered is<br/>
at least as important as encountering it.  Play is how the child<br/>
incorporates what he/she has learned into his/her own mental matrix.<br/>
So, providing kids with rich experiences and plenty of time to play and<br/>
digest what they are learning is an integral part of the learning scheme<br/>
<br/>
at our house.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I DO provide guidance.  I do not believe in an unmentored<br/>
child any more than I would recommend a child be raised by wolves.  Kids<br/>
<br/>
need guidance, not interference.  Finding that balance is the<br/>
responsibility of parents.  We&#39;ve been through more, so we can offer<br/>
information.  Of course, one can argue when guidance digresses to<br/>
interference, but that is pretty much up to each parent and child to<br/>
figure out.<br/>
<br/>
I homeschool my kids and other people&#39;s kids at my house.  We always<br/>
have a houseful.  It is always pretty insane here.  This weekend we had<br/>
10 kids here.  My daughter, age 14, just left for Korea.  For 2 years,<br/>
she had been asking for us to let her apply for a special foreign<br/>
exchange program through our church, and my husband and I sat on it.<br/>
Finally, we let her apply and she was accepted.<br/>
<br/>
My 12 year old dyslexic son loves physics and algebra.  He can read a<br/>
book upside down as easily as right side up.  He is a cute, nerdy,<br/>
freckle faced boy.  My 10 year old sprite of a daughter is a gifted<br/>
actress.  My 5 year old son is undoubtedly the cutest boy on earth.  (In<br/>
<br/>
NO way do I claim to be unbiased in my assessment of my children.  Hell,<br/>
<br/>
they are my kids.  You want unbiased, go read a statistician&#39;s report<br/>
(which may or may not be unbiased but sure will be boring).<br/>
<br/>
As for myself, I am a journalist and a computer graphic design artist.<br/>
First and foremost, I am mother to my kids, and any other kids that<br/>
happen to be at my house.  I have friends that are absolutely &quot;radical<br/>
unschoolers.&quot;  I know specifically what that means.  I am not at all<br/>
sure that I fit that category, but my ideas sure DO NOT fit any other<br/>
philosophy.  The term &quot;eclectic&quot; is too wishy-washy for my taste.  I<br/>
HATE &quot;structured.&quot;  I equate that with &quot;anal retentive.&quot;  I am<br/>
definitely &quot;relaxed&quot; (except, of course, when I am &quot;stressed out!&quot;)<br/>
My husband and I are both self taught people.  We know what it takes to<br/>
learn, since we ourselves had no teachers for the professions that we<br/>
respectively acquired.<br/>
<br/>
Life is an adventure through which one learns.  Work is an excellent<br/>
tutor.  Our kids definitely know how to live life to the fullest and how<br/>
<br/>
to work! (No maid service here.  When its time to clean the bathrooms,<br/>
do yard work, fold clothes, wash dishes, etc., like it or not, we ALL<br/>
clean &#39;em.  Some things jes&#39; AIN&#39;T an option!)<br/>
<br/>
I am very sorry if I appear pedantic.  An intro was suggested to me, so<br/>
I deigned to offer one.  I am happily argumentative and Irish.<br/>
<br/>
Nice to meet everyone<br/>

I agree with you.  The scariest thing I&#39;ve seen is the Ed. system talking as <br/>
though they could do a much better job is they started rounding up the kids <br/>
at age 3!<br/>
