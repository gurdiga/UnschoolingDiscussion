<div id="ygrps-yiv-661530803">Hey!  That was fun!   We need to see some pictures of you, though.<br/>
My son wanted to go to one of the protests near us, (Montana)  but we&#39;ve<br/>
lately had trouble with our car, and didn&#39;t want to travel that far.   No<br/>
one else we know in our conservative little bomb &#39;em all and let God sort<br/>
&#39;em out town was going.   <br/>
I looked for a wild British woman on the news when they showed the DC<br/>
protest, but I didn&#39;t spot you.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
You and Marji should have been holding signs with your names on them for<br/>
your fans who couldn&#39;t make it.<br/>
Maybe that was you with the  &quot;FECK YOU BUSH&quot; sign? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I liked the picture of your daughter.  <br/>
