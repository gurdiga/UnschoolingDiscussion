<div id="ygrps-yiv-788659712">Hi!  I have never been to the Rowe conference center but have heard<br/>
wonderful things.  It sounds a bit like the place people are describing<br/>
in Great Barrington.   It has trails and bunk houses, etc...Usually<br/>
prices for conferences held there include food (vegetarian), lodging and<br/>
workshops.  I can let you know what I think after I attend the Flower<br/>
Essence conference which is held there in June.  :)<br/>
<br/>
The website is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:retreat@...">retreat@...</a>.<br/>
I also wanted to mention a group I have met in Arlington Ma.  The web<br/>
page is homeschoolingtogether.org and they put together a one day<br/>
unschooling conference last April.  They may be able to help or have<br/>
some ideas to offer.  Looking forward to meeting othres!  :) Sharon</div>
