<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779089834">Thank you Mary.  I was starting to feel alone out here lol.  I know what you mean about the attention.  He requires a whole lot and some days I just don&#39;t have the energy.  I have read the thread about being with your kids Sandra was talking about a couple of days ago.  It has helped tremendously.  I feel like I have to learn a whole new way of being and living because that is not the way I was raised.  I will have to be patient with myself.  I know I will figure it out because I have already figured out so much and I am always open to learning and changing.  Reading the posts on this list and wonderful books are definitely helping me.  My son is also a great teacher.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-646956609">****He requires a whole lot and some days I just don&#39;t have the energy.<br/>
I will have to be patient with myself.<br/>
Manon****<br/>
<br/>
Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know when this original post came in (my account went nuts and<br/>
refused to send me anything for days before I figured out what was going<br/>
on), but I have a daughter who sounds very much like your son (I didn&#39;t<br/>
get how old he is).<br/>
<br/>
When she was really young she would leave the room and I would jump up<br/>
and follow her because se would be into stuff (like the garage climbing<br/>
up the shelves to get to the spray paint which was kept near the roof,<br/>
or pulling all the pins out of my pincushion and throwing them around<br/>
the room, finding my paints and painting over my paintings, etc...)<br/>
<br/>
She is, and was, a wonderful kid.  Full of life, curious about<br/>
everything, articulate, funny, but would constantly put herself into<br/>
sometimes dangerous positions.  We had to lock the spray paint up, bolt<br/>
the shelves to the walls so they wouldn&#39;t fall on her, and be with her<br/>
constantly.<br/>
<br/>
It was a lot of work and sometimes my husband would come home from work<br/>
and I would have to leave for 1/2 an hour or so, just to gather myself<br/>
before I went nutso.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s easier to be with now and doesn&#39;t require constant attention.  So,<br/>
consequently, my life is easier.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m saying is be patient, life changes and kids grow.  I&#39;m<br/>
glad we chose to homeschool and she has me to be patient with her<br/>
instead of a teacher who doesn&#39;t think she&#39;s a little wonderful goddess.<br/>
<br/>
Your child is lucky, as are all the kids of the people on this list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-471819357">Oh this is too funny.  I was laughing my head when you were describing your daughter because my son is exactly like that.  He is 2 1/2 and I too have to jump up and follow him around.  I had a good reminder of that the other day when he fell from the counter on his head on the ceramic (thank god he only got a bump on the head).  He is always climbing on top of everything and he still gets up on the counter (you would think he would have learned his lesson).  He already broke one arm too.  I guess I&#39;m not done covering up gray hairs.  How old is your daughter?  Thank you for your wonderful encouragement.<br/>
