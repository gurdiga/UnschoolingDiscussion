<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217844583">For things to seem like chaos when you start adjusting to a complete unschooling lifestyle?<br/>
Not continual chaos...just more then usual chaos with glimpses of hope thrown in? It seems like<br/>
all our routines are up in the air and I am finding that I am having a harder time <br/>
adjusting myself to then I thought I would. I have always been a very relaxed mom<br/>
especially when compared to my mom and to most of my friends and it is throwing me<br/>
to really look at myself and seeing how much I really do control my kids. And now<br/>
seeing their reactions (especially Jason&#39;s) as I try to change this is hard. Realizing<br/>
that they did feel controlled.<br/>
<br/>
I can see how giving up control will make things better all around. I honestly thought that <br/>
I would have an easier time adjusting to this. The funny thing is that I have found <br/>
giving up the &quot;schooling&quot; mindset the easiest! Probably because we never really started<br/>
school. It is giving up the food controls and other controls that I implemented in their<br/>
lives that seem to be the most difficult. I feel like right now the pendulum is over<br/>
correcting and I am hoping that we will be able to get into balance soon. <br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of things that I read on unschooling.com that have definitely improved<br/>
how I interact with my kids...one is coming from an attitude of helping the boys get what<br/>
they need/want rather then being the one to stand in their way. I have been pleasantly<br/>
surprised how just this change in thought has helped me change the way that I deal with <br/>
things. If Kyle was watching tv and Jason wanted to watch something, I used to say, well<br/>
it is his turn you have to wait. Now I say, let&#39;s go ask him. I try to help them talk it<br/>
out a bit and if Kyle&#39;s answer is still no, I try to find something to do with Jason. Just<br/>
the fact that I tried seems to go a long way. And sometimes Kyle says yes! I have noticed<br/>
that they are both doing much better with sharing the tv even without me getting involved.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that I have been trying to do is to let Jason &quot;shine&quot; in my eyes. He really<br/>
is such a wonderful little boy. I think the hardest thing for me to realize is that I tend <br/>
to correct and criticize more then I used to think I did. It gets worse when I get tired<br/>
or frustrated, so unfortunately now is not my best time...Kyle (2.5) is giving up his <br/>
naps which makes for a very cranky baby in the evening and all 4 of us are coming down <br/>
with colds which means that Kyle is up a lot at night. And since he decided that he had <br/>
to sleep with his brother several months ago (instead of with us) that means that I get <br/>
to haul my butt upstairs in the middle of the night to get him and bring him down with <br/>
us. Then he is still up several times for the rest of the night. Which means that I am <br/>
more cranky then normal. Oh yeah and I am also PMSing...not a great combination. Any <br/>
suggestions for seeing the good in your 5 yo when he has just hit his brother right after  <br/>
you told him to stop it? I know that if I can get myself past the behavior and see him <br/>
as the great kid he is it will help to stop the behavior.<br/>
<br/>
OK. I guess that I just had to whine a little...and I am hoping that someone will say that<br/>
yes it is normal for the mom to go through an adjustment period and that things will<br/>
settle down again. I just feel like I need to be so *on* for my kids especially now since<br/>
I am really looking at the way that I interact with them. And it can be exhausting, especially<br/>
when I am exhausted...it does get easier doesn&#39;t it? <br/>
<br/>
And to those of you who have been posting about wishing that they had a toddler again, keep <br/>
them coming! It really has helped remind me to put things in perspective. I know that this<br/>
will pass, but it sure helps to be reminded that I will miss this age...and I know that I <br/>
will, but it is still exhausting!<br/>

posts on unschooling.com (gosh I love reading her stuff!). It really spoke <br/>
to me and helped me open my eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Jason is definitely loved and he knows that I think that he is wonderful,<br/>
but when he does something that really frustrates me, I tend to go into<br/>
teacher mode and scold him or worse, yell at him. I realized the other day<br/>
that is exactly what my mom would do...I was a terrific daughter until I <br/>
did something that she did not like and then it was like all the good things<br/>
did not count anymore and I was an ungrateful child. It took until I was in<br/>
college (after she tried to kill herself) to realize that I could never keep <br/>
her completely happy and that was not a fair thing to place on a daughter.<br/>
She has gotten much better about this over the past several years (actually<br/>
since she has found god). But I think that I run the tapes of my mom in my<br/>
head when dealing with Jason. Something I am actively trying to change.<br/>
<br/>
I have been trying to remind myself that Jason *is* a good kid and does not<br/>
need to be *taught* to be a good kid. He picks up so much more through modeling<br/>
then he does through any lecture that I could give him. It is hard to break <br/>
habits though, especially when they come from how I was raised.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, at first, I checked out Conversations With Sandra Dodd. Browsed through<br/>
the conversations until something caught my eye. Then I found the search feature<br/>
(at the bottom) and started searching for subjects like TV limits and food limits.<br/>
This was great as it pulled lots of old conversations specifically on the topics<br/>
that I was interested (plus it was interesting to see old posts from regulars<br/>
here...like Ren arguing *for* tv limits. ;o) Makes me feel better and gives me<br/>
hope!) Now I usually check in about once a day, so I just go to the bottom<br/>
and search for new messages in the last day or so. There are usually about<br/>
30-40 new messages, but 15-20 of those are in the teens/kids folders. It is <br/>
pretty manageable this way. I also tend to look for specific people or look for<br/>
a conversation with lots of activity if I am really pressed for time. Anne O.<br/>
is one of my favorites...she has such a peace about her in her posts...something<br/>
that I am striving for in my parenting.<br/>
<br/>
The search feature is really great though because you don&#39;t have to wait for<br/>
someone to start a specific topic (or you don&#39;t have to start it yourself!).<br/>
<br/>
Hope that this helps...<br/>

he was a grown-up. When I asked him why, he said so that people would not try<br/>
to control him so much. It was really the first time he has actually talked about<br/>
this in this way. I asked him how I controlled him, he said by saying what he could<br/>
not eat. When I pointed out that I had not been doing this lately, he agreed but<br/>
said that it had not been that long. So to me, these past 3 weeks  have seemed like<br/>
ages,  but to him it has barely been any time. LOL! It turned out to be a really <br/>
great talk....<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For some reason I found that it was easier to be his partner when he was little.<br/>
Or maybe the issues were more cut and dry for me. The interesting thing is that <br/>
I have some wonderful attachment parenting friends who think that I am a little <br/>
nuts for letting go of the restrictions that I have. I had an interesting <br/>
discussion on an ap email list I have been on for over 3 years...basically the<br/>
majority of the AP moms there felt that trusting your child to know how often<br/>
to nurse or when to move into their own bed was different then trusting them<br/>
to know what to eat (not that they advocated forcing kids to eat, but rather<br/>
just limit access to junk food) or how much tv to watch. They considered one <br/>
developmental and the latter more of a learned response. It seems to me that<br/>
many AP moms get more mainstream in their practices as their kids got older. <br/>
*Much* more attached and sensitive to their child&#39;s point of view then most <br/>
parents I know, but still feeling it necessary to control certain aspects of<br/>
their children&#39;s lives. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah...I have been thinking about this lately. We do have another tv back in <br/>
the bedroom. Our problem is that we are completely spoiled by TIVO. The kids<br/>
have their favorite shows taped and available whenever they want them. And it<br/>
makes a vcr *incredibly* clunky to deal with. The other problem is that neither<br/>
kid would want to watch tv alone  back in the bedroom. Our family room is open<br/>
to the kitchen so even if I am not watching tv with them, I am on the computer<br/>
or in the kitchen right near by.<br/>
<br/>
I have just realized what I want to do with the living room...it is currently <br/>
a depository for furniture with no home as well as many of the kids toys and <br/>
train table etc. I think that I will turn it into a second family room. Set<br/>
it up with a second tv, comfy couches etc. We have no basement, so I think that<br/>
this room will do nicely to give us another place to hang out and it is not <br/>
too far away from the family room and kitchen. Have to think about the specifics<br/>
and check out the classifieds I think....<br/>
<br/>
Luckily both boys actually like a lot of the same shows, Full Metal Challenge,<br/>
Junkyard Wars, Between the Lions. I have even caught Jason turning on Blues<br/>
Clues when Kyle was not around. :o) I have been pretty impressed with how<br/>
well they have been sharing the tv. The computer was another issue, because<br/>
I did not feel comfortable telling one when to get off, but Jeff found an<br/>
old unused laptop at work so that has been working out great. :o)<br/>

I just put Kyle in our bed after he fell asleep (we rock him to sleep) instead <br/>
of Jason&#39;s so at least I did not have to get out of bed. Kyle was still up a lot<br/>
but at least I did not have to get cold!<br/>

<br/>
Yes. It takes a while to get into a family rhythm AND that rhythm can be <br/>
disturbed by life&#39;s events and then you have to get back into it all over <br/>
again. And, eventually, you won&#39;t see it as so much of a static situation, <br/>
but as an ever-progressing and ever-changing and developing life and some <br/>
of what now feels chaotic will just feel like regular &quot;background&quot; to that <br/>
rich life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003820295">We have lots of tv&#39;s .. they are really cheap. We have a tv and vcr in <br/>
each bedroom, a big tv w/ vcr and dvd in the living room, a little tv <br/>
(for the car - we recently did a 1500 mile trip, each way.. got the tv <br/>
for the ride home) with built in vcr which is now in the family room for <br/>
watching tapes, and hubby has another one in his office. But the kids <br/>
don&#39;t watch tv all day long, and we tape all of the shows we watch. We <br/>
sometimes won&#39;t actually watch a show until months after it aired. We <br/>
have homeschooling friends who greatly restrict tv watching, and if the <br/>
tv is on when these kids come over, they don&#39;t want to do anything else, <br/>
whereas my kids see the tv as one more option but it isn&#39;t a magnet for <br/>
them. The girls will often get in discussions about whether  a show is <br/>
worthwhile or not and why, and have sometimes decided to stop watching a <br/>
show because of one of these discussions. They&#39;re more likely to be up <br/>
late reading than watching tv.<br/>
<br/>
It was harder for me to let go of the food thing, but I am doing my <br/>
best. When they come ask if they can have something, I tell them they <br/>
know about healthy eating, decide for themselves. Hubby likes to check <br/>
up on their eating, so this may take a while, but he does leave them <br/>
alone once he sees that they are doing stuff on their own. He comes from <br/>
a very controlling family, so it&#39;s a little tough for him to let go <br/>
sometimes, but he is great with the kids, and since nearly everytime he <br/>
asks them &quot;did you have fruit today&quot; or something like that, and the <br/>
answer is always &quot;yes&quot;, he doesn&#39;t ask nearly as often. (who&#39;s teaching <br/>
who? :-)  My kids are always amazed when they go over a friend&#39;s house <br/>
and people don&#39;t have any fresh fruit in the house. If we don&#39;t have at <br/>
least three or four different kinds, it&#39;s time to go shopping.<br/>
<br/>
Guess I&#39;m rambling. When I step back and watch, and stay out of the way, <br/>
I&#39;m always, always amazed at how much kids really do &quot;get it&quot; and how <br/>
often adults (not just parents) can get in the way of what they want to <br/>
learn, do, accomplish.<br/>
<br/>
