<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540146788">Thanks Joyce and Jenny :) My daughter is 5 so picture books are just<br/>
fine.  She wants books to have pictures on every page.  She has been<br/>
interested enough in a story to forgo pictures once or twice, but it&#39;s<br/>
rare.<br/>
<br/>
She is starting to be interested in longer stories, though, and it i&#39;s<br/>
hard to find longer stories with pictures on every page.  We have some<br/>
nicely done fairy tales that are long, but not many chapter books.<br/>
The Catwings series by Ursula K. Le Guin is a short chapter book with<br/>
pretty pictures on every page.  Nicely written, too.  There is an<br/>
edition of Alice in Wonderland that we are reading that has pictures<br/>
on all but one or two pages in the whole book (edited by Cooper Edens<br/>
who has edited more books with lots of pictures).  Captain Underpants<br/>
is fun for her as well.  We&#39;ve looked a bit at comics (Garfield, some<br/>
manga) but she hasn&#39;t been very interested.  I think she liked the<br/>
comic format, but the stories weren&#39;t the right ones for her.   She<br/>
loves Spirited Away (as well as Kiki and Totoro) so we are looking at<br/>
getting some of the graphic novel versions of those stories:  she<br/>
loved the idea when I mentioned it to her.  I&#39;m also going to have to<br/>
think about manga that she might like... the ones that I read don&#39;t<br/>
seem to be very interesting to her but I bet there are some that she<br/>
would like.<br/>
<br/>
I would be very interested to hear if others have recommendations for<br/>
longer stories with pictures on every page.<br/>
<br/>
As for the littles, we just bought a lot of 10 littles books on ebay<br/>
and I plan to buy the picture book as well.<br/>

&gt;&gt; If you can find it anywhere, there is a book called The Littles and<br/>
&gt;&gt; their Friends. It is one of the best book on the littles. It&#39;s out of<br/>
&gt;&gt; print<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are 11 used ones at Amazon starting at $1.<br/>

&gt; The price does go up to $168 so the earlier you buy the better ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388933809">One of Holly&#39;s favorite books was The Doll People.  It&#39;s about doll- <br/>
house dolls, a modern set and an older set, interacting in secret at  <br/>
night (kind of, I think).  I read it to her before she could read and  <br/>
she read it herself a couple of times later.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ooh ooh!  Chamille loved that one.  Another one we came across was The<br/>
Ghosts of Austwick Manor.  That one is more of an older kid&#39;s chapter<br/>
book.  We found that one at a school closing sale and grabbed it up<br/>
without knowing  anything about it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a really cool time travel sort of book!  It inspired us to learn<br/>
about marzipan and a whole host of other things!</div>
