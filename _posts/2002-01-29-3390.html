<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203235661">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to thank those of you that posted to me privately and on the list<br/>
in support of me going through this time with Max&#39;s burned hand as well as<br/>
the problems with my mother.  We got back from the Burn Unit at the Hospital<br/>
this morning and it is 2nd degree burns.  They put new cream and bandaged<br/>
his entire hand up, so it looks like he has a stump for a hand... He was<br/>
very brave.  There were 2 other boys about the same age as Max there as<br/>
well... One of them had done the same as Max and the other one had backed<br/>
into a heater and had a burn on his back.  When I asked the doctor about the<br/>
amount of young kids here, he was pretty nonchalant about it telling me they<br/>
get kids all the time and every day as they are such little investigators<br/>
and are into everything.  I saw no signs of someone calling CPS on me or<br/>
asking me any questions that made me feel like I&#39;d done something wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Hubby was so upset with my mother because of what she said he called her<br/>
this morning and told her that he behavior was not acceptable and what she<br/>
said was nasty and she ought to look at her own behavior.  Did she respond<br/>
well to this (LOL)?  No, hubby said she kept on saying &quot;you two spend too<br/>
much time thinking about yourselves when you ought to be worried about<br/>
what&#39;s happening to your children&quot;.... Hubby kept focus on her behavior and<br/>
told her maybe it&#39;s time you got some professional help for your attitude...<br/>
Of course he calls me in the call when I&#39;m on my way back from the hospital<br/>
to tell me he&#39;s been my knight in shining armour.  I love him very much and<br/>
understand his need to protect me but after all these years I think I can<br/>
deal with my mother myself.... Oh well it&#39;s done now.<br/>
<br/>
Max is taking a nap and that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m going to do as I&#39;m exhausted<br/>
mentally, spiritually, physically and emotionally.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-617553491">So glad Max is doing well and that you are over the worst of the hump.<br/>
What I would say about your mom? She doesn&#39;t know how to empathize when<br/>
someone around her is in pain. Pretty common really. Maybe you can<br/>
empathize with her lack of ability next time you chat with her? ;)<br/>

Max is injured but glad it is ok.  You havea<br/>
jewel of a husband, to take up for you, even<br/>
if you didn&#39;t need him to.  Max is a lucky<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533740929">hi, again, dawn.  glad things are looking brighter today, and i&#39;m so glad that<br/>
you have your partner&#39;s support in dealing with parental problems -- and he,<br/>
yours, given that it&#39;s your mom.  so many times parent/in-law problems can tear<br/>
a partnership apart, but when the partners really work as a team, these types of<br/>
problems can strengthen your own immediate family ties -- and sometimes the<br/>
parent/in-law issues even do get solved (not been my experience, but i&#39;m still<br/>
hopeful).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-370942375">I&#39;m sorry about little Max&#39;s hand, Dawn.  <br/>
<br/>
When my husband was about 12 months, he pulled himself up on a gas <br/>
heater and burned the palm of his hand.  He has a wicked looking scar on <br/>
the palm of his hand, but of course, it&#39;s now tiny compared to the size <br/>
of his palm!  (My husband is 6&#39;7&quot; and has very large hands, as you can <br/>
imagine.)  His children have all become interested in the scar at one <br/>
time or another and have all &quot;oohed and aahed&quot; over it.  So, little Max <br/>
has that to look forward to at least!  Little comfort now, I suppose, <br/>
and especially not for you.<br/>
<br/>
Hope his healing is quick!<br/>
