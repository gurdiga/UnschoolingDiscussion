It&#39;s just a glitch.  There have been a few hiccups in the system while <br/>
egroups is merging with Yahoogroups.  It just happened to me as well, I never <br/>
resent the post about being &quot;pro-support&quot; either.  I&#39;m sure most folks knew <br/>
it wasn&#39;t our doing.<br/>

I noticed one or two of mine reposted, too. I think it&#39;s just Yahoo.<br/>
