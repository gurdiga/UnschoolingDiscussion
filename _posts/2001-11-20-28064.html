<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361474760">-=-Nowhere in Besty&#39;s post do I read (or read into it)<br/>
that she&#39;s afraid of TV!  I&#39;m really baffled (after<br/>
reading quite a bit of your posts) as to how you reach<br/>
your conclusions.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It was totally and entirely tongue-in-cheek humor intended to make light <br/>
without malice.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a &quot;conclusion.&quot;<br/>

X-files?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070967675">You are sooo right! I was obviously half asleep while<br/>
I was reading this! Now that I read it with my full<br/>
brain power it&#39;s so obvious. I feel just a bit foolish<br/>
&lt;sg&gt; (sheepish grin). <br/>
