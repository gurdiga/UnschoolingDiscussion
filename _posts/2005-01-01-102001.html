include someone just because he&#39;s  there.   I like to talk  about music with <br/>
someone who  remembers the 60&#39;s, but when someone wasn&#39;t born  until the <br/>
80&#39;s, I  <br/>
don&#39;t mind clarifying references, or naming one of the group&#39;s  songs  to <br/>
give <br/>
them a point of reference or  something.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Or send him really good albums from the 60&#39;s!<br/>

Does he  want to hear me say &quot;Here&#39;s an interesting anecdote.  <br/>
Apparently John  Kerry has trouble deciding what to order in a <br/>
restaurant.  Maybe the  flip-flopping rap wasn&#39;t as unfair as I <br/>
thought.&quot;  How about &quot;The  proposed social security reforms look like <br/>
they are really going to shaft  stay-at-home moms that end up <br/>
divorced.&quot;?  Or &quot;Thomas Jefferson  really is my kind of guy.  I really <br/>
like this quote of his about his  perception of Jesus.&quot;  Or &quot;This study <br/>
of media bias in the early  Seventies had really screwy methodology.&quot;  <br/>
These are all things that  I remember really lighting up my brain in the <br/>
last month that I did not  think would be interesting to my ten year old  <br/>
kid.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
For a while we called it &quot;Math Out Loud&quot;----just thinking about a math  <br/>
situation aloud so that the boys could listen to us figure out the answer : like  <br/>
&quot;Ten percent of eighty is eight, plus half of that (four) is $12, adding a bit  <br/>
for extra service ----make it $14 or $15 for a tip.&quot; Then it evolved into  <br/>
plain old &quot;Thinking Out Loud&quot;----like: &quot;I wonder why these Cape Cod seagulls are <br/>
 a darker color than the ones that we&#39;re used to down South.&quot; Or &quot;That  <br/>
moon/sunset/pond surely is beautiful tonight.&quot; Just thinking outloud. I  used to do <br/>
all my thinking silently. With kids (and especially with unschooling)  it <br/>
really helps to do it while someone&#39;s listening. They may never give a rat&#39;s  <br/>
butt about it----but it *could* spark a new conversation, even IF you thought  <br/>
there would be no interest.<br/>
 <br/>
Of course, now my kids just think it&#39;s schizophrenia! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Those of you that have talkative, extraverted  kids should imagine a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>different attitude at my house. &lt;g&gt;)   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Those of you who know Cameron also know he&#39;s a bit on the quiet side.  &lt;g&gt; So <br/>
if he&#39;s actually spoken to you, please feel honored! &lt;g&gt; But  Thinking Out <br/>
Loud has sparked many a conversation about *so* many things and now  he&#39;s a <br/>
veritable walkie-talkie about some things---music and drugs and the 60&#39;s  and <br/>
films (esp. indie films) and war and sex and magic and astronomy and  .....<br/>
 <br/>
But I talk to myself ALL the time. Sometimes I&#39;m outright ignored;  <br/>
sometimes, not. Sometimes I&#39;m laughed at! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If I intentionally read books to myself about  topics he was interested <br/>
 </span></blockquote>in I might have more good conversations  starters.  I suppose I would do <br/>
that if I was 20 years old and trying  to impress a guy.  (Ahem, sad but <br/>
true.)  Does that seem like a  reasonable tactic for enhancing <br/>
unschooling?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
What would it hurt? You might find a new passion. <br/>
 <br/>
But I&#39;d quit if I found it intolerable----remember the certificate of  <br/>
empowerment!? &lt;g&gt; It *might* even be considered modeling!  And he  might <br/>
reciprocate! &lt;g&gt; Wouldn&#39;t it be MIGHTY cool if someone *you* loved  picked up a book or <br/>
movie about something *you&#39;re* passionate about and learned  a little more <br/>
about it?<br/>

our way to NM last year, I got everybody out of the car at 4 in the <br/>

But I didn&#39;t buy her those things and lay them around the house <br/>

I guess  the difference for me is that I do this as part of living  - I<br/>
read  stuff aloud to my dad, too, or anyone else who happens to be around,<br/>
just  because I think it&#39;s cool stuff. My dad and brother and I<br/>
occasionally clip  and send articles to each other, from JAMA or the<br/>
Honolulu newspaper or  whatever. I don&#39;t do it, though, because I&#39;m hoping<br/>
they&#39;ll learn something  new or it will pique their interest in a topic -<br/>
there&#39;s no agenda to it, I  guess. It&#39;s the agenda part that feels wrong<br/>
to me. And sometimes people  talk about &quot;strewing&quot; as a way to &quot;hook&quot;<br/>
kids, to expose them to things or  to get them interested in a topic....<br/>
and other times people talk about it  simply as sharing things with your<br/>
children that you think they&#39;ll enjoy or  find interesting. I&#39;m<br/>
comfortable with the latter but not the  former.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
It *should* be a part of your life. But some people need a push in the  right <br/>
direction----The adults, not he kids----ESPECIALLY if their kids have been  <br/>
in school!<br/>
 <br/>
And I don&#39;t think anyone says that it&#39;s a way to hook kids into something.  <br/>
It *might*, but that&#39;s not the purpose. It&#39;s to expose them to something they  <br/>
*may* find fascinating.<br/>
 <br/>
I left &quot;Apples to Apples&quot; sitting out on a book shelf last night. The teens  <br/>
found it and played for three hours----and HOOKED three adults into the  game <br/>
in the process. I played it for the first time at Anne Ohman&#39;s. Who  &quot;hooked&quot; <br/>
whom? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
If a child NEVER saw a microscope (and how many homes do you think keep one  <br/>
on the counter? Seriously!), bringing one home *might* just be the spark of a  <br/>
new passion. It might be a one time-good time, but, so?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
*Our* jobs as unschooling parents IS to bring unusual (as well as what  <br/>
*might* be considered mundane) things into our homes----or take kids TO them.  One <br/>
of the few things schools have over homes is that there  are  people with <br/>
different interests and there ARE microscopes and  posters and THINGS. ALL of this <br/>
is available in the real world, so please  believe me when I say that I&#39;m not <br/>
saying to bring school HOME! I AM saying that  it&#39;s a responsibility we take <br/>
to provide cool and exciting things for our  children----things that *we* may <br/>
not necessarily keep handy----because its not a  part of *our* adult lives.<br/>

So...  where in there is manipulation?  I know my kids can  understand and be <br/>
interested in all kinds of things they&#39;ve seen, if  they&#39;ve only seen them.  <br/>
In <br/>
a rich environment, they can learn more  than they would&#39;ve learned in <br/>
school. <br/>
In a &quot;whatever&quot; environment where  parents aren&#39;t taking them out and about a <br/>
lot, I don&#39;t think they  will.  An environment can be enriched, and if a <br/>
family wants to  provide their kids with a full set of experiences, why would <br/>
any  <br/>
unschoolers recommend against anything that makes a natural-learning  <br/>
environment <br/>
richer?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Right. <br/>
<br/>
I think a family in which *everything* holds a  possible/potential interest <br/>
and in which no one is forced to engage in things  that may *not* hold <br/>
interest----well, those kids will be honestly *open* to  whatever flies in.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s natural. <br/>
 <br/>
My kids trust that, if I &quot;strew&quot; something, they can just as easily take it  <br/>
as leave it. I&#39;m happy either way----and my feelings are fine either way.<br/>
 <br/>
A mom whose feelings are easily hurt by a child&#39;s disinterest might have a  <br/>
harder time with this. AND a kid who feels that he *needs* to show some kind of <br/>
 an interest to please mom----yikes!<br/>

Kirby and Marty went to a new year&#39;s eve party with their physical friends, <br/>
not their gaming friends.  They usually play sports with them or go to swing <br/>
dance or whatever (Kirby isn&#39;t as physical as the rest, so it&#39;s not his main <br/>
crowd, but he&#39;s known the hostess since they were babies in La Leche League).   <br/>
They said bring food or something entertaining.  Kirby was hesitant about what <br/>
games to take and talked to me about his concerns about that crowd, so I <br/>
advised him to pick games that are easy for people to join or drop out of or stand <br/>
at the side of and watch, rather than games people have to be dealt into or <br/>
start from the beginning.  He didn&#39;t expect them to play.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out he put encore out as soon as they got there, 7:30, and it was <br/>
played non-stop until 11:00.  Then an spontaneous game of &quot;killer&quot; (spies and <br/>
secret &quot;deaths) started--nobody said &quot;let&#39;s play&quot; and nobody reviewed the rules, it <br/>
just started and played through.  Marty told me and Keith all about it at <br/>
breakfast.  He was elated.  And they boys came home by 2:00, and more awake and <br/>
alert on the way home because of their satisfaction with the way the games <br/>
helped the party than they had been on the way out--wary  and not expecting the <br/>
best.<br/>
<br/>
Because of people on unschooling lists bragging it up, we bought Five Crowns <br/>
years back.  We&#39;re on our third deck.  We&#39;ve tried to throw the other decks <br/>
away when they got gummy (as cards do when they&#39;re played a lot) but both times, <br/>
guests said &quot;NO!  I want the old ones if you&#39;re getting new ones.  So Wendy <br/>
has one set and Cathyn has the other, but we who play TONS have the third.   <br/>
<br/>
The Sunday before Christmas an older friend from Denver was here just for the <br/>
one evening, with other friends.  They suggested Five Crowns.  Her kids are <br/>
long grown, but she really wants to buy that game when she gets home.  We <br/>
played two full games and then played the word version, Quiddler.   The boys and <br/>
five or six of their friends were playing other games in another room.  Holly <br/>
was off with a friend of hers.  We had no less fun with this game than we would <br/>
have had when we were playing it because others had said it was an easy game <br/>
for little kids.  <br/>
<br/>
When Dan Narigon was stuck in Albuquerque after the 9/11 attack (he&#39;s an air <br/>
force officer and had been at Kirtland AFB on a contract job, but they closed <br/>
the base so the meetings weren&#39;t happening, but he couldn&#39;t fly home either), <br/>
we played Five Crowns two nights.<br/>
<br/>
If something starts one way and becomes a normal part of a busy, bubbling <br/>
life, it took hold and that&#39;s that.   If something doesn&#39;t take hold, that&#39;s just <br/>
as fine.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Maybe some unschooling parents do more than they need to do if they&#39;re doing <br/>
schoolish things out of fear.  But I think if they still have a fear they <br/>
could stand to lighten up.  Yet objections to strewing as a word or concept or <br/>
whatever seem to me to be defending those who might want to say kids can learn on <br/>
their own time in their own rooms, and the house can stay as it would have if <br/>
the family wasn&#39;t homeschooling.  I don&#39;t see why or how that&#39;s a great and <br/>
noble goal.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Right.    This is all fine and true with families that are onboard with unschooling and all of the trust that goes with those close fitting relationships is present.   But maybe the point where it all gets confusing is when there are ulterior motives in the strewing.  Or families are in different places as far as trusting each other.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Maybe if a family is new to unschooling, as we were 3 years ago,  and I strewed some things around,  my son might question looking at what I strewed.  He didn&#39;t have the trust in my intentions at that point.  Before unschooling I&#39;m sure I was always trying to &quot;educate&quot; him or trying to get him to learn what I thought he should learn.   Those efforts led to a distrust in me.  Why would he want to try the things I&#39;m suggesting when it was usually what I thought he should learn.  <br/>
<br/>
This is where it seems like strewing could be manipulation or artificial in its origin.  Maybe it all depends on the motives behind the strewing.  <br/>

To me it seems like if we lead an interesting life and share that with our children,  the strewing just happens.  (As others have said.) Unfortunately other factors come into people&#39;s lives, like bad school experiences or unenthusiastic, negative people and we have to try and describe what should be happening naturally.<br/>

gets chairs. We tend to get very theatrical, at least some of us do...<br/>

Maybe if  a family is new to unschooling, as we were 3 years ago,  and I <br/>
strewed  some things around,  my son might question looking at what I  strewed.  <br/>
He didn&#39;t have the trust in my intentions at that point.   Before unschooling <br/>
I&#39;m sure I was always trying to &quot;educate&quot; him or trying to  get him to learn <br/>
what I thought he should learn.   Those efforts led  to a distrust in me.<br/>

---------<br/>
 <br/>
My kids never went to school and never distrusted me.<br/>
I&#39;ve always dragged in something weird or new, and cycled through toys and  <br/>
games and *stuff* like puzzles and prisms and window-crystals and stuff.   Did <br/>
it before I had kids, did it MERRILY after I had babies and toddlers, and  <br/>
just never stopped.  I think it&#39;s the central thing that made unschooling  so <br/>
easy here.  But it&#39;s not just what&#39;s shown up on the bathroom counter,  it&#39;s <br/>
where we go and what we watch and listen to.  It&#39;s a whole  &quot;sense-surround&quot; <br/>
experience (not quite in the Kentucky Fried Movie way, but  kinda &lt;g&gt;).<br/>

If a  parent&#39;s not interested enough in learning that <br/>
they don&#39;t have an  &quot;enriched&quot; home, then they don&#39;t need to leave <br/>
stuff out for the  kids.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
If a parent&#39;s not interested in learning, she probably won&#39;t be interested  <br/>
in unschooling at all. It&#39;s a moot point. She&#39;ll send that kid to school----to  <br/>
learn that learning sucks, just like mom says. A parent HAS to be interested <br/>
in  learning to unschool. Period.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They need to pick up interests of their own.   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s true of *any*body. I firmly believe that a person is *much*  <br/>
more interesting if he has a passion----and the more passions, the better. Even  <br/>
IF they aren&#39;t MY passions, I&#39;ll find him more interesting because he IS  <br/>
passionate about *something*!<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling parents, in my opinion, DO need interests and passions. They  <br/>
need to model that love of learning. A parent who sits around all day doing  <br/>
nothing makes a very, very bad inschooling prospect.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
Some people have so much of a dislike for their personal learning that  they <br/>
*can&#39;t* strew naturally. They NEED to put that cart before the horse and  <br/>
*push* if they&#39;re going to get to unschooling. They need to fake it &#39;til they  <br/>
make it!<br/>

<br/>
===========<br/>
 <br/>
I think it started with how someone might communicate with a child who&#39;s  not <br/>
talkative.<br/>
Not all communication needs to be verbal.  Sometimes it can be sharing  an <br/>
experience, playing with a puzzle, messing with magnets, watching the  <br/>
mesmerizing kinetic ball-run sculpture at Explora, going for a  walk.  Sometimes <br/>
conversation comes up.  But if someone&#39;s unschooling  relationship seems stagnant, <br/>
it will help to  mix it up.  Mixing it up  can involve changing schedules and <br/>
routines or putting new things out.<br/>
 <br/>
If a marriage relationship is getting boring, same advice.<br/>
 <br/>
If someone has a friend who only ever does the same things with them, same  <br/>
advice.<br/>
 <br/>
Not weird particular agenda bearing advice unless the agenda is keeping  life <br/>
fresh and interesting.<br/>

needs to do more geography. I think that&#39;s a slippery slope that leads to<br/>
schooly-ness.<br/>
<br/>
We have two maps on our walls, a world one and a world-at-night one. We<br/>
had a USA one but it fell off. They all look kind of scruffy, and I wish<br/>
we&#39;d laminated them first. Sometimes Rain just sits and find stuff on the<br/>
world map, and when the tsunami happened it was helpful to be able to see<br/>
where it had occured and which countries were affected. We had the radio<br/>
on NPR and they had a discussion with the Vice President (I think) of the<br/>
Maldives, and when we got home Rain wanted to know where they were, so we<br/>
found them.<br/>
<br/>
I put them up because I was digging through old ephemera and found them<br/>
and they were cool-looking, and because it seemed like we were needing to<br/>
google maps fairly often and it would be easily if they were hanging on<br/>
the wall. I&#39;d also  heard on NPR that cartographers put intentional<br/>
errors on maps, for copyright-type reasons, and I wanted to see if I<br/>
could find any. I haven&#39;t, yet anyway.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>

this thread help people understand unschooling. <br/>

school can need some help in seeing its joy in an unschooling home.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m easily excited by a lot of things, so I&#39;m hardly &quot;acting&quot; when I show  my <br/>
enthusiasm. I *might* do better to curb my enthusiasm sometimes! &lt;g&gt;  But <br/>
some new unschooling moms might need to put out some effort in showing the  joy <br/>
in learning new stuff.<br/>
 <br/>
Learning *should* be joyful! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-80915794"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Have your kids been to school, though, Patti?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope.<br/>
But *I* went for 17 years, and was a good student to boot.  So I&#39;ve <br/>
needed to do a lot of work in my own mind, and conversations such as <br/>
this one have been very helpful to me.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; school can need some help in seeing its joy in an unschooling home.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree.  Mabye it&#39;s why my kids are excited by microscopes and I&#39;m <br/>
not.  Too many good grades in science class. :-/  <br/>
Recently I&#39;ve recovered my excitement for history though and can&#39;t <br/>
get enough of historical fiction, non-fiction and films.  When we <br/>
were in DC and visiting the Ford Theater I was literally awestruck <br/>
by the Lincoln exhibits.  My kids are excited by it too, but it&#39;s <br/>
less likely because they are following my example and more likely <br/>
because it really just is fascinating stuff in its own right.  I say <br/>
that because there are things that I find exciting that they <br/>
definitely don&#39;t. <br/>

joyful.  Learning is an inevitable by-product of living a joyful <br/>
life.<br/>
I&#39;m getting a lot out of this conversation.<br/>
Thank you everybody! :-)<br/>

If someone is joyfully watching soap operas in a hotel-room-stark house,  <br/>
while her kids are in their rooms with color-coordinated toys, and she says  <br/>
&quot;Unschooling isn&#39;t working out for us,&quot; I might recommend that joy alone isn&#39;t  <br/>
enough for them.<br/>
