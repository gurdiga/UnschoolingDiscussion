<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941545393">Hi Wendy,<br/>
<br/>
I just changed from digest version to individual e-mails, and I had 196 messages when I checked my e-mail last night after being away all day!  I started out with the digest and quickly noticed I would get 3-5 digests per day of usually 25 posts each.  Wow!  I wanted to read everything too, and did at first (at least the beginnings of each), but then gradually became more familiar with ongoing threads and began to prioritize according to my interests.  <br/>
<br/>
The digest begins with listing the subjects of each e-mail (along with who from, etc.) by number, and when I began to prioritize I began jotting down the numbers of the ones I wanted to read - certain particular threads and all new ones.  I switched to e-mails because it was time consuming to scroll through the huge digests to find what I wanted.  Last night to go through the 196 e-mails I had waiting (a new record!) I first just deleted each one that I would love to read if I had the time but just don&#39;t!  That left me with only maybe 30-40 or so.  Since most are fairly brief responses, it did not take long at all to read these. <br/>
<br/>
 The whole process took maybe 30 minutes.  This is actually a fairly large block of time to add into my day, but the tremendous support I have found just reading other people&#39;s opinions, the exciting responses to my own posts from folks who share my interests, and the tremendous debate/discussion makes it valuable time to me, and worth making the time for.  (I live in a small town with mostly Christian school-at-home homeschoolers.)<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps,<br/>
Amy in St. Albans, VT<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779676200">I find the daily digests are the best.  I get between 4-10 a day and <br/>
if I am days behind I will just delete a few a pick up on the latest <br/>
one.  I miss stuff, but I still get alot.  Also, my ability to read <br/>
comes and goes.  We moved a few months back and I wasn&#39;t reading at <br/>
all.  But I stayed with the list and just deleted as it was only a <br/>
few emails a day.  Once life wound down, I started reading again.  <br/>
That way I never forget about it or it&#39;s principles as it pops up in <br/>
my email box everyday!<br/>
<br/>
I have not been on for a bit and I never realize how much I miss the <br/>
list until I come back to it!  It is such an exciting and <br/>
interesting group of people and always inspiring.  Inspiring in how <br/>
to raise children but also in personal growth.  I am a much better <br/>
mom and still working hard at it thanks to the people here!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894847482">One more thing I wanted to add that helped me:  On AOL (and I&#39;m sure most <br/>
other servers) you can click on &quot;subject&quot; in your mail box, and it will <br/>
catagorize your mail by subject, rather than date/time.  It&#39;s much easier to delete and <br/>
keep messages when they&#39;re grouped like that!<br/>

I actually don&#39;t have it on email at all.  I come to the list from <br/>
the Yahoo home page and read the threads that I&#39;m interested in.  I <br/>
try to come at least once a day or twice, if I have time.  But, this <br/>
way, if I don&#39;t have time for a few days (or longer)I&#39;m not bombared <br/>
with email that I don&#39;t have time to read.    <br/>
<br/>
I also just wanted to say that we moved a few months ago and I <br/>
didn&#39;t read at all for months.  I just got back on track at home and <br/>
came back to the group.  I too didn&#39;t realize how much I missed the <br/>
list until I started reading again.  It really is inspiring and has <br/>
once again reinforced my decision to both unschool my daughter and <br/>
to stay at home with her.  Thank you to all of you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211575150">I think there are better places than this list for people who are new to <br/>
unschooling and want to read (or skim) quickly through topics of particular <br/>
interest to them.<br/>
<br/>
One is here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/board-topics.html">http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/board-topics.html</a><br/>
<br/>
You can still leave comments and questions, and if your browser will do such <br/>
things, save link to the folder you asked in so you don&#39;t have to look so hard <br/>
the next time.  But if you do post at unschooling.com and want to just look <br/>
for new stuff the next time you can go to that link (message boards) and then <br/>
to the box at the bottom (the links for the forum) and click &quot;new messages,&quot; <br/>
and tell them how many hours or days since your last confession. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Or just put this in your favorite places / most-used links right now:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com/cgi/discus/board-newmessages.cgi">http://www.unschooling.com/cgi/discus/board-newmessages.cgi</a><br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how I get into that board.  I pull down to that link and then estimate <br/>
a little high how long since I last read.   (I opt out of &quot;message tree view&quot; <br/>
but some people like it; try both.)<br/>
<br/>
Another repository of stuff by subject is here:<br/>

At unschooling.com a few months ago the &quot;hey, women can learn to pee standing <br/>
up!&quot; topic was explored. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine told me about it in the 70&#39;s.  She had gone hiking in the <br/>
mountains with a woman who knew how.  She didn&#39;t need to pull her pants very far <br/>
down, and didn&#39;t need to squat.  She called it &quot;thunder pissing,&quot; and it <br/>
involved, uh....     manual manipulation of the skin in front.  (She had to pull <br/>
and aim.)   <br/>
<br/>
I never got around to trying it, but for hiking in wintry mountains or cross <br/>
country skiing, it could be very useful.<br/>

always, I just read those e-mails that catch my eye and if it is something I&#39;m <br/>

I would love to read everything but I&#39;m able to gather ideas and I figure <br/>
that reading a few is better than not reading any.  On days when I have some <br/>
time, like right now, both kids and husband are happily occupied with their own <br/>
interests and its my time.  I&#39;m reading lots and dinner is going to be cereal!:  <br/>

    Well since you&#39;ve been reading lately you know I can&#39;t keep up either.<br/>
LOL! I&#39;m on digest and read when I can. I don&#39;t post often because I&#39;m<br/>
usually behind so much someone has said what I wanted to already and that&#39;s<br/>
ok. I&#39;m just about caught up but I know I&#39;m not really because I haven&#39;t<br/>
collected mail all afternoon. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get some great responces<br/>
before this goes through but oh well...one more perspective.<br/>
<br/>
    I find I absorb all the wonderful stuff just from reading it and<br/>
_applying_ it to our lives. It really helps me and ultimately my boys to<br/>
lurk and learn and really *be* with my boys. We&#39;ve come a long way. I am<br/>
very greatful to those that have come before me and share what they have<br/>
done in the past and how they live now. As you know it&#39;s a great list to<br/>
*get* unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
    Try digest. If you don&#39;t like it read on the web when you can. If you<br/>
like individual post best, read only the subject lines that interest you. If<br/>
you have certain concerns post here or go to the message boards of<br/>
unschooling.com and read. Lurk that&#39;s helpful too.<br/>
<br/>
    Keeping up isn&#39;t my priority anymore. Coming from this perfectionist<br/>
that&#39;s hard to admit. Learning and applying unschooling principles in our<br/>
lives is what it&#39;s all about for me now. Try to sit back, relax and enjoy<br/>
your family.<br/>

&gt; My name is Wendy.  I love and want to read all of your experience and your<br/>
&gt; opinions.  I was thinking of putting this group on daily digest.  My<br/>
&gt; question is what works for you?  Got any tricks on how to keep up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want to admit this but I am probably putting unreasonble<br/>
&gt; expetations on myself thinking I can keep up like I want (which is<br/>
&gt; perfectly).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
