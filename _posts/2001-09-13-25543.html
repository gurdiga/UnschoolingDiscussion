<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743690304">Ok, I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about the child as messiah thing and treating <br/>
everyone as such, which I really believe in, so I feel pretty hypocritical <br/>
for some of the feelings I&#39;ve had about you and my brash tones. I&#39;m sorry.<br/>
<br/>
You have said many things that have really hit home with me, as a person <br/>
still learning and growing and as a parent. If I had no concern for you or <br/>
your struggles, I would have deleted all of your messages by now, but so many <br/>
things you say ring out to me, I want to share with you the knowledge I have. <br/>
But as someone rightly pointed out, you can&#39;t give that to someone who <br/>
doesn&#39;t want it or ask for it, and it&#39;s not very unschooly. <br/>
<br/>
So rather than *tell* you what is going on in your house let me share my life <br/>
with you.<br/>
<br/>
Addiction and codependency have been a huge part of my life. And as a child I <br/>
too watched tv a lot and picked at myself. In hindsight, I didn&#39;t need more <br/>
structure, control, spankings, punishment, rules, etc. I needed to feel free, <br/>
loved unconditionally, accepted, noticed, listened to, respected, etc. I&#39;m <br/>
not at all implying these things are lacking in your home, only stating that <br/>
they were in mine.<br/>
<br/>
Recently my son was watching tv a lot, and I really got scared. I was worried <br/>
about the effect of tv, but I was also petrified of the thought of him lost <br/>
in addiction like me or his father.  My first thought was to control his <br/>
addiction or obsession. And I did. I went so far as to unplug the tv and tell <br/>
him it was broken. Thinking it&#39;s ok to lie and control if it&#39;s in his best <br/>
interest. But with all the debates on here, I changed my mind. And I had to <br/>
look back on my own childhood, and think of what I could give him rather than <br/>
take from him. This has also been a wonderful opportunity for me to not only <br/>
help my son and open a door for him I nearly closed, but a chance for me to <br/>
reconnect with another lost part of myself. To realize some more stuff from <br/>
my childhood that shaped who I am today. And your posts have inspired that <br/>
too, so for that I thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Like you, I also had a period of injury where he watched a lot of tv. But he <br/>
also has had lots of other emotional stuff happen, stuff that I thought he <br/>
should be over by now. I think now that with everything he&#39;s been thru in his <br/>
short life, he has been &#39;hiding out&#39; in the tv until he knows it&#39;s safe to <br/>
come out. It&#39;s a safe, comfortable, controlled, predictable environment. He <br/>
also needs to know that life is safe, that he is loved, that someone is <br/>
always available to him and will love him no matter what. If I were in my <br/>
son&#39;s shoes, I&#39;d be a bit cautious venturing out too. Sometimes he&#39;ll let it <br/>
go for awhile, then come back to it. I truly think he is using it as a safe <br/>
spot. And as someone said on the chat boards, it&#39;s something he can control, <br/>
that is turn on and off at will, unlike life. <br/>
<br/>
Might I offer a possibility that you can dispose of at will. You said that <br/>
you had a time where you were down and your son watched a lot of tv. Maybe it <br/>
really scared him that you might die, or stay sick forever and he never <br/>
verbalized it or even consciously knew it. Maybe sometimes he needs to &#39;hide <br/>
out&#39; in the tv until he feels confident that his own environment is stable, <br/>
i.e. you&#39;re not going to be hurt again or die and leave him. And maybe, when <br/>
he reaches his comfort point with the outside world, he will no longer *need* <br/>
the tv and will only use it as an education and entertaining tool.<br/>

Thank you for your post and your story.  I do understand what you are<br/>
trying to say and in fact I&#39;ve already done most of what you advocate.  I<br/>
had let go of a lot of the &#39;control&#39;  I had been trying to hold on to<br/>
about a year ago.  But that does not mean I will allow him to injure<br/>
himself.   Picking his arm open may be a form of coping but I can&#39;t let<br/>
it continue unchecked because it is destructive.  Scratching his head and<br/>
sniffing his fingers is not destructive so I don&#39;t try to stop that<br/>
behavior.  TV is a sticky area though.  The damage done is a little less<br/>
immediate and a little more important.  I am NOT talking about damage to<br/>
his mind or his mental state.  I am talking about damage to his health. <br/>
That sedentary lifestyle when it continues for years is not good.  He is<br/>
already overweight and out of shape.  He NEEDS to get away from the TV<br/>
and get exercise.  He knows it and he feels better when he does and he is<br/>
happier when he gets away.  But, he is not ready to take sole<br/>
responsibility of turning it off himself.  Until he is in a position to<br/>
control his own compulsion, it is my job as parent to help him learn how.<br/>
If you truly have dealt with addiction and OCD you will understand the<br/>
difference between an addiction to an injested substance and a compulsion<br/>
to behave a certain way.  They are not the same and I should not have<br/>
used the words interchangeable but I have found that many people do think<br/>
of them as interchangeable.  <br/>
