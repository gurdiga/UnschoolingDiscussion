<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817220521">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I picked out this one sentence to address.<br/>
<br/>
***but <br/>
what if they change their minds and find that they can&#39;t go to <br/>
college because they never learned algebra or geometry?***<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t and never, this is your thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling needs trust that children and adults can and will. If you change your thinking around learning you will see your kids can and they will. Any adult can start college at the very lowest level and go from there. Any older teen can too. There is no stop sign that says, oh well, you didn&#39;t so you can&#39;t. Trust, facilitate, listen, and believe they can learn whatever they want to, not what ever you want them to.<br/>
<br/>
For your child who wants to be a vet, help her in that now, provide vet related experiences. I wanted to be a vet too. I got a job cleaning poop and sweeping at a vet hospital. I moved up to helping at the desk and very minor tech stuff. I never did become a vet, I fell in love with plants. I farm, I garden and landscape, but when I worked in the vet hospital, I felt I could be a vet someday. It helped me, even though I didn&#39;t follow that particular path.<br/>
<br/>
Get your young programmer a mentor like Ren mentioned, or look at community offerings. I know here near the University, in the summer months there are all kinds of classes and clubs for kids, some which are programming related. The paths to learning are out there, but I sense you have blinders on that keep you focused in a very narrow school path. Removing those blinders will help you see the larger world which we live and learn in.<br/>

even make sense.<br/>
Maybe there are people who don&#39;t know that you can go to college at  <br/>
any age, you can take courses through college extension programs or  <br/>
community colleges to earn credits you might need to get into other  <br/>
colleges, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119610578">Just to add to this. Our family doctor is a mother of 5 kids home-birthed, breastfed on demand, family bed - attachment parented etc... She went back to school to get her medical degree at 36, when her kids were older. She&#39;s in her 40&#39;s now, and is happily practicing medicine, and enjoying her now teen+ kids. I imagine she would have been considered by many a very unlikely candidate for med school, but she&#39;s a doc & it really is never too late.<br/>
