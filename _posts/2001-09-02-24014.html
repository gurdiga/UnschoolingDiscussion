<br/>
All that stuff Deb L. wrote sounds really good. <br/>

I wanted to say also that my husband and I had alot of those problems before we changed our diet.  (well, he changed his diet- I am trying to slowly change mine! eeek- not my strong suit)<br/>

Here is a link to Paleo eating-  based on the premis that because agriculture is a very new development in human history- our human bodies are not adapted to the products of it (all grains, sugars, ect.)<br/>
