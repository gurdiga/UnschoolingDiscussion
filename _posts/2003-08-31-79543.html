<br/>
&gt; Has anyone found meaningful ways for their kids to become<br/>
&gt; involved with wildlife (not just domestic animals--we&#39;ve had pet<br/>
&gt; rats and a bunny and are planning to get a dog)?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Check with every wildlife rescue and rehab in your area (there are probably<br/>
several) and see if there&#39;s any way for him to volunteer on any level.<br/>
Because of liability issues (and concern for the animals) it may take him<br/>
awhile to actually get his hands on the critters themselves, but he may very<br/>
well be able to help them with fundraising, do some office gofer work, etc.<br/>
<br/>
He can also start learning everything he needs to know about wild animals by<br/>
practicing on his domestics. I.e, get the lad to dog training school. Find<br/>
one that works with positive reinforcement methods and explain what his<br/>
ultimate goals are, because a dog will work for love but a lion won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Read Karen Pryor (Lads Before the Wind, Don&#39;t Shoot the Dog) and any dog<br/>
training book that says it uses operant conditioning (and especially cat<br/>
training books, because cats don&#39;t work for love either!).<br/>
<br/>
Once he has a grasp of how positive reinforcement / negative reinforcement /<br/>
reward / punishment all work (they&#39;re all different things) with his dog, he<br/>
can apply that and train his rats and bunny, too.<br/>
<br/>
And once he can train domestics of all sorts (if you can, get him a bird and<br/>
not a smart one -- something like a chicken -- to practice on) he may be<br/>
able to get &quot;a wild animal&quot; (rescue and raise a baby bird and then train it,<br/>
etc.)<br/>
<br/>
The basic rules of animal training don&#39;t change between species, just a bit<br/>
of the methodology and whether one needs go into the cage armed. ;)<br/>

This is just what we learned yesterday in the cheetah encounter <br/>
at the zoo. They showed how to train a domestic cat and I <br/>
suddenly saw the value in having a cat rather than a dog. They <br/>
only work for food, not love.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Fantastic. Thank you!! He&#39;ll be so excited.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is where we went wrong with the rats. I think he was a bit <br/>
too young and his patience was limited. Not only that, he didn&#39;t <br/>
know the techniques so he was pretty random in his attempts to <br/>
train them. I thinhk he&#39;s now at the stage where he could follow a <br/>
plan and actually implement it. Thanks for the good advice.<br/>

wonder what kind would be good. My duaghter wants us to <br/>
incubate and hatch chicks. Any ideas how to do that? Any <br/>
resources?<br/>

LOL! Yes, we&#39;ll hold off on birds of prey a little while longer, I <br/>
think. :)<br/>
<br/>
Great advice Pam. Thank you. This list is amazing.<br/>
