<br/>
Oh!<br/>
One of the stories of the creation of Bugs Bunny is that Bob Clampett was<br/>
watching Clark Gable eat a carrot in a scene from &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;<br/>
and based his cartoon character on him.   &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; won<br/>
best picture in 1934,  best actor, best actress (Claudette Colbert) and<br/>
best director (Frank Capra)   <br/>
<br/>
(That was the year Adolf Hitler gained power in Germany)<br/>
<br/>
There are other stories, but that&#39;s my favorite.  Maybe because I like<br/>
Clark Gable.<br/>
<br/>
Bugs debuted in a short called Porky&#39;s Hare Hunt in 1938.   Mel Blanc was<br/>
the voice, that street wise, tough guy persona for Bugs.   Bugs made his<br/>
first appearance with Elmer Fudd in A Wild Hare in 1940.   He said<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s cookin&#39;&quot; in those first cartoons, later changed to &quot;What&#39;s up<br/>
Doc?&quot;.   Bugs was originally called Happy Rabbit.<br/>
Bugs Bunny won the Oscar &lt;g&gt; for best short subject in 1958 for the<br/>
cartoon Knighty Knight Bugs.<br/>
In 1997 the Bugs Bunny stamp was issued by the US Postal Service. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow, that is so cool that you know all that. Seriously. Look at all the <br/>
information I and I am sure others,just learned by Teresa asking her question. <br/>
Without someone asking, perhaps your own knowledge on this bit of American <br/>
cartooning and film would not have been shared. At least to this degree. That is why <br/>
asking questions is a good thing. It opens dialogue and learning can occur <br/>
from such.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx again,<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who still hates Bugs Bunny but enjoyed learning about his history in <br/>
spite of her disdain.<br/>

Thanks, I never knew the Clark Gable thing. I love Bugs. Love how cute he is<br/>
when he showers and puts his ears in a shower cap!!!!<br/>
