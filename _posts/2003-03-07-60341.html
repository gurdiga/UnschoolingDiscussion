&lt;&lt; Not sure where you live but here in the south that is the first thing they <br/>
 ask, sometimes even before they ask your name. LOL<br/>

Yep, yep, yep.<br/>
Especially if you dared show your face at a curriculum fair...ugh.<br/>
I used to say &quot;I don&#39;t go.&quot; and then change the topic.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

 like a heathen. &gt;&gt;<br/>

South Florida does NOT count as the South....you are in a different world <br/>
