<div id="ygrps-yiv-827583466">I haven&#39;t read this book, but another one that I found interesting was &quot;A <br/>
Sense Of Self&quot; by Susannah Sheffer.  She talks about how the cliques and <br/>
social pressures that girls use on one another in school are not a natural <br/>
thing at all, but a school-induced behavior pattern.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-421744739">I have to reply to this..look out on my soap box again..<br/>
I havn&#39;t read the book but it kind-of relates to a question that I&#39;ve been meaning to ask everyone..<br/>
I have gotten the comment, if you pull your kids from school... how will they deal with life?  For example,  a friend would say &quot;life isn&#39;t fair, they have to learn this&quot;.  Like in school they&#39;ll learn how to deal with conflict and then real life will be so much easier!  Yeah, right!!  <br/>
How can I answer these kind-of comments and not just sound like a defensive b----? I think I tend to come across this way alot when I&#39;m passionate about something.  Also to me all of this stuff is so common sense, unschooling especially and letting a person do what they enjoy.  I really have a hard time believing that it is such a hard concept for people.  Don&#39;t they see musicians that make a living or artists?  These people love their work!  I suppose most people would then say, yeah but they can&#39;t live on that,(won&#39;t make enough money) I say lets get rid of one SUV, how about reusing some older clothes, hey here&#39;s a stretch--what about hand-me-downs?<br/>
Sorry, but I think I&#39;ll write a book and make my millions and it will be called Common Sense.  I think that&#39;s what so many of these self-help books could be called.<br/>
Ok,  all done,  and oh, Rachel Ann, I&#39;ve been meaning to tell you I really enjoy reading your posts. Keep them coming.  I love the Jewish religion and way of life, it is so rich in tradition, wish my Lutheran life was that way!  <br/>
Take Care,<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve got several ideas, but some of them will undoubtedly cross the line<br/>
into bitchiness.<br/>
<br/>
1.  &quot;I don&#39;t agree.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
2.  Make a scoffing sound and then say &quot;Cruelty is over-rated.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
3.  &quot;They&#39;ll deal with life when they are older and ready to deal with it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
4.  &quot;Tell me the worst thing that happened to you in school.... and why<br/>
it was good for you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
5.  &quot;So you think suffering builds character?  Is that the reason you<br/>
drive your kids to school?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What happened with me was that I would see all these cool things in books or<br/>
on the internet and suggest to my son that we try them.  He usually said no.<br/>
Or he&#39;d say he was interested but I&#39;d realize he really wasn&#39;t.  (Something<br/>
about my voice made him think it was important to me that he say yes?)<br/>
Anyway, I gradually stopped showing him stuff.  Looking back, I realize that<br/>
he usually responded well when I just went ahead and organized something,<br/>
like when I organized the building of a geodesic dome out of newpapers with<br/>
our local group.  When I first showed him the idea, he wasn&#39;t interested.<br/>
Once I arranged for it to happen, he was quite into helping me get the stuff<br/>
ready, and he was the one who stuck with it the longest when it wasn&#39;t<br/>
working out quite right.  (We did it again, a little differently, and it<br/>
worked fine.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I feel badly now that I didn&#39;t pick up on the fact that he needs<br/>
action.  I needed to start things that I thought he&#39;d like, without worrying<br/>
about whether I was going to be wasting my time on something that might not<br/>
appeal to him.  Well, we just keep on trying to give our kids what they<br/>
need.  And sometimes we get it right.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
