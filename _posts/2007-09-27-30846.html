&lt;Children need to know how to make a good decision.&gt;<br/>
&lt;He can not make a good choice for himself &gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And how will he ever learn to make good decisions or choices if his  <br/>
decisions are always made by someone else?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;Your child is addicted to sugar, colorings, additives etc.. Can&#39;t you  see <br/>
that? &gt;<br/>
and<br/>
&lt;you are supporting a terrible industry who&#39;s main objective is to make  <br/>
money and create a generation of people addicted to their products?&gt;<br/>
and<br/>
&lt;educate yourself on the addictive/harmful nature of the ingredients  within <br/>
the candy, soda etc- what you will find, among other things, is that when  one <br/>
is consuming these products the brain & body in turn suffers greatly  <br/>
rendering cognitive problems as well as a host of other terrible symptoms of the  <br/>
addiction&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
This is fear-mongering, plain and simple. And *not* helpful.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;you should try to push off the fear that you can&#39;t place a  boundary.&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I can get this kind of &quot;put your foot down, *YOU* are in charge&quot; kind of  <br/>
advice just about anywhere I ask-that&#39;s *why* I brought it here,  because I knew <br/>
I would get honest, direct answers that would help me build  my relationship <br/>
with my children, open my home and family to possibilities and  bring more <br/>
peace and joy to our lives.<br/>

&lt;The very best place to begin is my own thoughts that stand in my  way --<br/>
somehow it&#39;s never about the kid, is it?  ::bg::&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And yet mainstream parenting says it is *all* about the kid. That concept  <br/>
was a very tough one to come to-for us, anyway. And yet, it was the turning  <br/>
point for our journey into whole life unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;First I&#39;d recommend losing (internal *&* external) judgment over  what&#39;s <br/>
nutritious and what isn&#39;t. &gt;<br/>
Oh, yeah, I do that all the time-I just keep finding it again. ;~)<br/>
 <br/>
&lt; Even candy nourishes. For me, there is something soulful in the eating  of <br/>
my favorite sweet. &gt;<br/>
Really, though, this was *big*. A very &quot;Wow... Yeah!&quot; moment for me. That  <br/>
helps a lot. Thanks.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;Is there a fear in him that you&#39;re going to begin restricting his  candy?? &gt;<br/>
From what we talked about tonight, no, I don&#39;t think he feels that way at  <br/>
all. But then again, it could be &quot;under the surface&quot; so to speak. I will try to  <br/>
work on my thinking of candy being more part of the tribe, though. It could <br/>
only  help us all.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;there&#39;s a natural ebb and flow...&gt;<br/>
That is SO funny-I was just blogging a few days ago about the ebb and  flow <br/>
of *my* journey through unschooling!! Though my terminology was more about  <br/>
&quot;tides&quot;, but I like your terminology-it makes me think of the cute cartoon  <br/>
shorts on Noggin with the little girl and her dog, Ebb and Flo. Connections.  Makes <br/>
it seem like it was &quot;meant to be&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;Does he know cans=cash?&gt;<br/>
I had forgotten about this, myself. We used to hoard cans for the cash when  <br/>
we were in leaner times. Funny, we&#39;d probably have had more cash if we&#39;d not  <br/>
have drunk so much pop. lol Thank goodness that was before we became parents.  <br/>
Wyl seemed really excited about it, but I wasn&#39;t sure about the price they <br/>
pay  nowadays (we curb recycle), but I&#39;ll be finding that out for sure tomorrow. <br/>
I  don&#39;t think we have any of those machines that you can put the cans in for <br/>
cash,  near here. I haven&#39;t seen any in many years.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
~~~I&#39;m NOT comfortable with chemical sugar-substitute sweeteners,~~~<br/>
&lt;I confess this is a *BIG* one with me!! We do read labels, definitely  as an<br/>
&quot;informed consent&quot; not restriction. Hayden knows his dad had a brain  tumor.<br/>
Hayden knows dad&#39;s doctors told him *never* to have nutrasweet.  &gt;<br/>
I read this part (among other parts) to Wyl and he would like to know more  <br/>
of the story, like, &quot;Did he drink the nutrasweet?&quot;. If you don&#39;t want to talk  <br/>
about that, I understand, and if you&#39;d rather keep that offlist, that&#39;s fine,  <br/>
too-you&#39;re welcome to e-mail me anytime.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;There is flavored water with Splenda. Artificial yeah, but not a  <br/>
neuroexciter :)&gt;<br/>
Good point. Thanks for helping me see beyond my fears of The Dreaded  <br/>
Artificial. Why do I always forget the &quot;breathe&quot; part?? Its almost always the  first <br/>
thing I tell other people, but when things get to &quot;critical&quot; where I can&#39;t  <br/>
fight my way out of the wet paper bag of my fears, I completely forget about  <br/>
breathing.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Off to ~*breathe*~ and contemplate,<br/>

Sort  of like how many adults lose touch with what excellent <br/>
health feels like  and come to accept a fairly mediocre state of <br/>
health (allergies,  headaches, fatigue etc) as their normal because <br/>
the decline occurs very  gradually and they&#39;re not technically &quot;sick <br/>
in bed&quot;- the downside of human  adaptability I guess.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But this is what I see as the difference between being raised respectfully,  <br/>
with trust to know one&#39;s own body and mainstream parenting. All the adults  I <br/>
know who come to that mediocre state of health have been raised  <br/>
traditionally-*not* with respect and trust to know their own bodies. They&#39;ve  learned to <br/>
ignore what their body says and to listen to what an authority figure  (parent, <br/>
then doctors and other professionals) say-without question. That is why  I&#39;m <br/>
so determined to find my way to trust and respect-so that my kids *can*  listen <br/>
to their own bodies, their own minds, their own hearts. Without doubt or  <br/>
fear or lack of confidence. In essence, to be more than I am/was.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

This has been sitting in this state of first-draftedness for a <br/>
while, and eventually I guess it will have more...   <br/>
