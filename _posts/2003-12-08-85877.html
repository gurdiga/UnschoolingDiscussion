<br/>

Thank You<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060497030">Post Secondary Enrollment Options. It&#39;s a program where juniors and <br/>
seniors in high school (public, private or homeschool) can attend <br/>
college and the state pays for it. My third son is now enrolled and <br/>
the other two really enjoyed it. One went on to graduate from the <br/>
school he started at and the other is going to transfer to a <br/>
different school after 3 semesters and two years off (he&#39;s in CA <br/>
now).<br/>
