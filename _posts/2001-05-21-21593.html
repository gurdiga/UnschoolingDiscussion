<div id="ygrps-yiv-403496528"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I have been wondering this too! How exactly were people introduced to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>homeschooling in the first place, especially before you had children or<br/>
before it was time for them to go to school? It is not something, until<br/>
recently, that the media mentioned. I just never came across the idea until<br/>
a friend suggested it (because her MIL had loaned her a Holt book), and my<br/>
DS was in K by then (he did one year of pre-K and a full year of K).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have to write an outline of sorts, because we&#39;ve taken the complicated<br/>
road to get here,<br/>
and aren&#39;t settled enough even yet due to various transitions that seem<br/>
particular to our<br/>
family chemistry. LOL<br/>
<br/>
-Attachment parenting.<br/>
-Tried to go back to work when dd was two, but our daycare experience being<br/>
very uncomfortable.<br/>
-Decided to come home and have a second child.<br/>
-Enrolled dd in a strict 1/2 day preschool that was praised by most people<br/>
we knew but left us feeling disapointed and our dd<br/>
showing major signs of stress...tantrums, etc.<br/>
-Walked around the zoo with my kids during the day, a lady warmly suggested<br/>
that we seemed like homeschoolers.<br/>
I scoffed...thought that homeschooling was something only very religious<br/>
people did.<br/>
-Went online to research other educational options and ask questions about<br/>
the overly-structured way that<br/>
the preschool did things. Read about Piaget and began to resent the amount<br/>
of ditto work the school depended on.<br/>
-Found that I agreed with and was inspired by homeschoolers and began to ask<br/>
questions and email people<br/>
like crazy.<br/>
-Brought home dd for Kindergarten in order to save her emotions and let her<br/>
follow her creativity<br/>
-Bought lots of materials (too much) and did projects every day...many too<br/>
complicated<br/>
-Began to see her joy return and her heart open up<br/>
-Delighted to see that she wasn&#39;t unmotivated and that &quot;learning&quot; was easy<br/>
-Felt depressed and isolated that many friends/family members didn&#39;t<br/>
understand our &quot;new lifestyle&quot;/ Was too immature to<br/>
balance that out with what we&#39;d gained by making what had before seemed like<br/>
obvious decisions<br/>
-Felt pleased and proud that tantrums were gone and felt that we all had<br/>
*fixed* the problems (yeah right-bigger fish than we&#39;ve got the pan for)<br/>
-Dd went to 1st grade in public school and did wonderfully in an academic<br/>
sense (pleased others), but had<br/>
emotional overflow and tantrums again<br/>
-Felt like we were living 1/2 a life...revolving around the school schedule<br/>
just to please people who weren&#39;t around<br/>
helping and participating in our life most of the time anyway<br/>
-Went back online got involved in homeschooling discussions, started reading<br/>
about unschooling and asking questions like<br/>
crazy again. Bought ridiculous number of books on education and<br/>
homeschooling. :)<br/>
-Brought home dd again (2 very positive yrs now but negotiating)<br/>
-Younger dd went to a sweet and more relaxed preschool for 1/2 days until<br/>
she no longer enjoyed it and the vibe changed<br/>
-Younger dd came home last year<br/>
-Finally gave up on pleasing friends and family only to find that the<br/>
strength of our not trying to please them, earned not necessarily their<br/>
approval, but respect<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s the SHORT version.<br/>
Wish I were a more succinct person. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234582714">Oh no, I went through that whole outline, only to reread and see that you<br/>
were asking<br/>
specifically of those whose children had never attended school. :)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should mention my bad habit of Skimming? LOL<br/>
<br/>
Apologies,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-497499361"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;How exactly were people introduced to homeschooling<br/>
&gt;&gt;in the first place, especially before you had<br/>
&gt;&gt;children or before it was time for them to go to<br/>
&gt;&gt;school? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For me, there was never any question.  Having done the<br/>
bulk of raising and educating myself, I would never<br/>
have entrusted institutions and &quot;authorities&quot; with my<br/>
child.  I knew I would have children one day, as I<br/>
loved them too much to not have any.  I also knew I<br/>
would not send them to public school, that I had such<br/>
horrible experiences with.  I knew I was not likely to<br/>
find a private school that I was comfortable with, and<br/>
did not like the institutional mentality anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
When I did finally get preganat, it had been decided<br/>
in my mind for years that I would homeschool my kids<br/>
and I matter of factly let everyone know that.  Later<br/>
on, when we discovered all our elder sons special<br/>
needs and allergies as he grew, friends and family<br/>
alike began to assume we had decided to homeschool<br/>
because of him.  Sometimes I correct them, other times<br/>
not.  I really don&#39;t care why they think we do it,<br/>
just so long as they leave us to do it.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a cousin who homeschooled all four of her<br/>
children when I was growing up, but they are<br/>
fundamentalist Christian and do school at home with<br/>
strict religious curriculum.  When I first was letting<br/>
folks know that we planned on homeschooling ours, that<br/>
side of the family said &quot;Oh, you should talk to your<br/>
cousin Renee.  She homeschools all her kids!&quot;  It<br/>
seems like they think it must be hard to find out<br/>
about homeschooling and I would need to talk to her to<br/>
find things out.  They assume that because they are<br/>
ignorant and don&#39;t hear anything much about it, or<br/>
know how to find out about it, that I must not either.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow I found my way to Homeschooling naturally, long<br/>
before I had kids.  Unschooling came after I had the<br/>
kids and began to do serious research about the<br/>
legalities and logistics of homeschooling.  I educated<br/>
myself about the different methods and theories and<br/>
Unschooling was a natural fit.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband is like a male shadow self of me.  What I<br/>
would have been had I been raised by a loving family<br/>
in a small town (and been born male!)  LOL  So we<br/>
agree on nearly everything, and he is behind me all<br/>
the way with the unschooling, as with everything else.<br/>
