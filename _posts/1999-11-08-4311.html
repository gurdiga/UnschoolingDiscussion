<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026114941">Isn&#39;t unschooling at it&#39;s best doing what your kids are interested in?  My<br/>
kids LOVE unit studies.  Those are treats for them.  They choose the<br/>
subjects, and recently my oldest (9) has been helping to organize one.  I<br/>
see nothing wrong with it if the kids like them and want to do them.  BTW,<br/>
we make up our own - don&#39;t use the prepackaged ones or guides on how to make<br/>
them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012323855">Yes.  If they know they have options and love unit studies that&#39;s great.  The<br/>
younger they are the easier it is to subtly direct them in ways which might be<br/>
manipulative.  I am not suggesting that this is your case at all.<br/>
<br/>
It seems quite possible for kids to love &quot;unit studies&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-923012855">&quot;Does he know he doesn&#39;t have to wait until he grows<br/>
up, thanks to the internet!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He already knows all about buying up interesting objects from other countries on ebay (one of his finds was some very old Chinese coins), looking up cool information and eating foreign foods.<br/>
His proclamation was about going to the real country, cuz nothing can beat that experience.<br/>
Thanks to Sandra&#39;s suggestion, we are now in the planning stages of an Orlando trip in 2005...he&#39;s totally psyched about Epcot. We&#39;ve been wanting to go for years, but now we&#39;re much more inspired and focused!!<br/>
<br/>
I happen to be a huge history and culture buff and food is the way I tend to explore these things. As I was preparing the Chinese food tonight (to celebrate the Chinese New Year that begins tomorrow) Sierra  asked &quot;is this medieval food again?&quot;:) <br/>
We have paper lanterns hanging around the dining area that the kids made today, wrappers laying around from all that durn rice candy they ate and aching bellies full of fried rice, rice noodles and tofu (except for Trevor who decided it all tasted icky and ate scrambled eggs instead!).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe in waiting until a child gets older or becomes an adult to fully explore their interests, believe me! But sometimes there is nothing like the real life experience of actually BEING somewhere totally different than the U.S.<br/>
