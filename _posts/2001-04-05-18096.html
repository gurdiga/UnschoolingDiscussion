<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114268445">I do not have  a sister that is a teacher, but I understand your question. I,<br/>
personally would not be confrontational on this issue unless that is the only<br/>
park that you could attend. As a parent, I would look more at it from a<br/>
safety/security point of view from the school. One, they have to be obviously<br/>
concerned about safety issues if you or your child gets hurt on their property<br/>
during school hours. But more on a secondary, any child looking out the windows<br/>
wishing they could be your child playing out there, they do not know you and you<br/>
are a potential &quot;stranger-danger&quot;. Otherwise, if you want to fight them, I would<br/>
say, go for it. You pay school taxes still don&#39;t you?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110270446">There will be variations based on your locale.<br/>
<br/>
There are some areas where  it would not even be relevant whether school was in<br/>
session or not----the schoolgrounds are for the use of students enrolled in a<br/>
particular school!    I have run across this concept  during involvement with<br/>
community sports leagues  always looking for practice space.   Prohibibitions<br/>
are not even restricted to use of district equipment or  fancy athletic<br/>
facilities but even extend to &quot;open grassy areas&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
In my city,  visitation to any campus during school hours requires going<br/>
directly to the office first (if you can find it!) and the staff there can<br/>
decide whether to give you permission to either visit your childs class or<br/>
utilize any of the school campus (playground).<br/>
<br/>
Some schools utilize playgrounds that are on adjoining city park property<br/>
(students actually leave campus during recess!!).  In those cases it is less<br/>
likely you would be told to leave---unless you are in an area with a daytime<br/>
curfew.<br/>
<br/>
Vicki<br/>
P.S.:  no,  being &quot;tax-funded&quot;  does not mean you have the right  to decide<br/>
means and time of use totally on your own.   Think museums, roads, subway<br/>
system,  state or national parks or forests......military bases for that<br/>
matter!!<br/>

Is there a law about staying off of ps property during the school day?  I<br/>
occasionally take my son to the playground and always get asked to leave.  It&#39;s<br/>
tax funded so doesn&#39;t that give me a right to use it when I want?  If any of you<br/>
with the teacher sisters can ask, I&#39;d appreciate it.  Collette </span></blockquote></div>

<br/>
Bigtime.  Yes.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I occasionally take my son to the playground and always get asked to <br/>
leave.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you go on weekends or at night they probably won&#39;t say a word.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s tax funded so doesn&#39;t that give me a right to use it when I want?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, it gives the principal a responsibility to keep it secure from outsiders <br/>
(of any age or stripe) and to keep outsiders safe from it.  <br/>
<br/>
There are state funded hospitals, but you can&#39;t go climb into a bed and play <br/>
with the oxygen mask.  (Well, maybe for a little while...)<br/>

&lt;&lt; Who is asking you to leave? Is it the school? Police officers? Some <br/>
schools do have policys that regulate public access. I think the laws would <br/>
be by the city of county  you live in so you would have to check the laws <br/>
there. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there is a public or private school in the U.S. that will allow <br/>
free access to buildings OR grounds during school hours.<br/>
<br/>
If they let a mother and baby on the playground, what law then keeps drug <br/>
dealers or child molesters or ammo salesmen out of the parking lot?  If the <br/>
visiting mother and child could go into the hall and use the bathroom, what <br/>
would keep homeless men from going to the restroom there?  Staying extra <br/>
long?  Sleeping for the day?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a slippery slope kind of situation, and the policy is (and probably has <br/>
been since the first log cabin one-room-schoolhouses) that during school <br/>
hours, nobody else is there.<br/>
