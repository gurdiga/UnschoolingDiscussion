<div id="ygrps-yiv-378327832">I have no issue and support the use of most of the shots (polio, mumps,<br/>
rubella, and tetanus especially).  These are no-brainers to me.  (My sister<br/>
had to undergo the treatment for NOT having a current tetanus shot and my<br/>
dad was doctor!  I think it&#39;s cruel risk not to give this to a child, but<br/>
that&#39;s MY personal choice and opinion.)  As a doctor once said to me, &quot;die<br/>
of something we can&#39;t cure.&quot;  As for chicken-pox, that&#39;s a different story.<br/>
Some people may not ever get chicken pox.  Chicken pox isn&#39;t like the other<br/>
diseases in that you are never protected from it.  If you&#39;ve had chicken pox<br/>
you&#39;ll never get chicken pox again, but if you come in contact with someone<br/>
who has chicken pox you can get shingles (which from my recollection of a<br/>
great-Aunt who had it, not a pleasant thing to have).<br/>
<br/>
As for requiring people to vaccinate their children?  I have mixed feelings<br/>
about it.  I certainly believe that a parent has a right to opt out of<br/>
everything, shots, public schools, etc.  But if a parent decides to place<br/>
their child in a public, tax-payer sponsored, school, then the school (and<br/>
the tax-payers) have a right to establish rules that everyone must conform<br/>
to.  Either opt-out or opt-in.  Those are your choices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-184697528">My baby had meningitis when she was two weeks old, we were told she would<br/>
die.<br/>
She didn&#39;t, thankfully, but I do know a little about what its like to deal<br/>
with a disease like that.<br/>
With that in mind, I know one little boy who is autistic, mysteriously<br/>
suddenly autistic immediately after the MMR vaccine.  I know a mother whose<br/>
little 2 month old baby died a horrible, painful death from a reaction to a<br/>
vaccine.  My three nieces all got chicken pox - and they were vaccinated.<br/>
My friend&#39;s daughter got Measles from the vaccine.<br/>
I know what is in the vaccines - mercury, tissue from aborted fetuses,<br/>
things we would never feed our children.  My last pregnancy I studied and<br/>
studied and studied the vaccination thing trying to figure out the chances<br/>
my child would die or be seriously effected by a vaccine, in relation to the<br/>
chances that she would die or be seriously effected by one of the things the<br/>
vaccine was trying to cure.  I found it was a very close call.  In countries<br/>
where some of our vaccines are illegal, or not administered until much<br/>
later, there is a lower instance of SIDS and adverse reactions to the<br/>
vaccine.  And there isn&#39;t a higher rate of the diseases the vaccines protect<br/>
from in those populations.  The US has a very high infant mortality rate,<br/>
the highest of any industrialized nation (I think it is 21st?), and one must<br/>
wonder if it is because we shoot so many things into tiny bodies that can<br/>
barely fight off the poisons we give them.  Add that to the rest of things<br/>
we do to harm the babies of our country (bad water, pesticide and herbicide<br/>
use, etc etc etc) and it makes sense.<br/>
So... with me, I think vaccines should not be necessary, or at least there<br/>
should be options.  I think a less rigorous vaccination schedule would do<br/>
much better.  Stop doing combined shots, space them out, wait until the<br/>
child is at least a year old.  There should be options, and just not going<br/>
into the doctor, given some sheet of paper telling you what could happen,<br/>
then automatically injecting the vaccinations on some predetermined<br/>
schedule, without true parent education or appearance of choice.<br/>
The meningitis with my daughter frightened me very much, but I wasn&#39;t going<br/>
to put her through more pain and potential suffering by giving her<br/>
vaccinations at 2 months old.  We will wait and try to space them out, and<br/>
we won&#39;t be giving her all of them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-917516645">We are right in the middle of moving right now, and can&#39;t seem to locate my<br/>
folder of vaccine information.  But I have a list of ingredients for all the<br/>
major vaccines.  The vaccines are grown and strained in various tissues,<br/>
human or animal, like monkey kidney, chicken embryos, etc.  For rubella,<br/>
hepatitis A and chicken-pox vaccines they use human diploid cells, which<br/>
come from the organs of aborted fetuses.  Now, I must admit I can&#39;t recall<br/>
if any of the fetus &quot;cells&quot; (from the cell line) are actually in the<br/>
vaccine, but it is on an ingredients list.<br/>
I must make clear that no new fetuses are being used, the cell line has been<br/>
established, so unless they feel need to establish another cell line, they<br/>
will not use another fetus.<br/>
Some of these fetuses were aborted over 20 years ago so it may be well<br/>
removed from the incidence for some people for ethical reasons, and there<br/>
are churches that agree with this belief, that its been so long it is all<br/>
right to use the vaccine.<br/>
I was first introduced this information in an article in Mothering magazine.<br/>

I hope that helps, and hope I didn&#39;t mislead anyone in my statement, I get a<br/>
little worked up sometimes when it comes to such issues :)  and I may have<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477037837">Thanks for the update.  I looked it up myself and found the following from<br/>
the South Dakota Journal of Medicine.  Many websites misquote the actual<br/>
text and give the impression that fetuses are being aborted and harvested<br/>
for the production of this vaccine, when in fact, as the following text<br/>
describes, tissue was taken from 2 embryos 40 years ago and those cells are<br/>
reproduced in the laboratory (the cells not the embryos) and have saved<br/>
thousands of lives as a result.<br/>
<br/>
I think this an important distinction.  Vaccines are not being made from the<br/>
flesh of freshly aborted babies.  The cells captured 40 years ago could just<br/>
as easily have come from naturally aborted fetuses or miscarriage.  It seems<br/>
obvious that you&#39;d want to control the cell replication in the laboratory<br/>
and not introduce new cell lines and potentially dangerous disease threads<br/>
as a result.<br/>
<br/>
Connie<br/>
Fallacy: Aborted fetuses are routinely used to manufacture Varivax(r).<br/>
Facts: Human diploid fibroblast cell lines are used to produce several<br/>
different vaccines. Human diploid cells are immature cells that can be grown<br/>
indefinitely and readily support viral growth. Currently, there are two<br/>
human diploid cell lines in use, WI-38 and MRC-5. Both of these cell lines<br/>
were developed from lung tissue of two therapeutically aborted fetuses in<br/>
1961 and 1966. The medical reasons for the abortions were independent<br/>
decisions unrelated to the production of the human diploid fibroblast cells<br/>
or vaccines. All human diploid cells used in the past and today for vaccine<br/>
production come from the WI-38 andMRC-5 cell lines.14 Dr. Takahashi and<br/>
colleagues developed the Oka master seed virus and from this the various<br/>
varicella vaccines are produced.10,15<br/>

for religious, medical, and philosophical reasons in most states, although <br/>
some states only allow one or two of those three. Of course, they don&#39;t like <br/>
you to know that you have that right, because then you might exercise your <br/>
freedom to do so. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t vaccinate for several reasons, the main one being that it is my <br/>
opinion that vaccinations do much more harm than good, overall. I think my <br/>
immune system was made to fight off disease in the best way possible, and I <br/>
don&#39;t like tinkering with it my putting foreign substances in it. I have many <br/>
other reasons and beliefs, but that&#39;s all for now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250814324">You can only get shingles (Herpes Zoster) if you have HAD chicken pox.  Some<br/>
people may have had chicken pox in a very mild form and never knew they had<br/>
it... or they had it as a child and their parents didn&#39;t remember.  It<br/>
appears (and I didn&#39;t know this!) that if you get the chicken pox vaccine<br/>
you&#39;re less likely to ever suffer from shingles!  Wow!  Now I wish my kids<br/>
had gotten the vaccine rather than having had chicken pox.  Thanks for<br/>
asking the question--learn something new everyday.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428780060">My main objection to mandatory vaccinations is the<br/>
mandatory part.  What gives the government the right<br/>
to tell me what is best for my children regarding<br/>
their health or education.  For me the right thing to<br/>
do is look at each shot individually.  Some are better<br/>
than others.  I also do not abide by the schedule,<br/>
which I feel is the governments way of getting as many<br/>
shots as possible into as many people as possible<br/>
(since the first year of life is when they see the<br/>
doctor the most).  My last pedi said as much to me<br/>
because since I wasn&#39;t doing shots and my daughter was<br/>
healthy, she felt that I didn&#39;t need to come in<br/>
according to the regular schedule.  She also did not<br/>
vaccinate her child according to the govt schedule.  <br/>
To vaccinate or not to vaccinate is a personal family<br/>
decision.  My gripe comes not from the choices of<br/>
others, but from ignorance.  It is wise to look at<br/>
both sides and then make your decision.  Blindly<br/>
following what others are doing is always a mistake.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; We are right in the middle of moving right now, and can&#39;t seem to locate<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; folder of vaccine information.  But I have a list of ingredients for all<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; major vaccines.  The vaccines are grown and strained in various tissues,<br/>
&gt; human or animal, like monkey kidney, chicken embryos, etc.  For rubella,<br/>
&gt; hepatitis A and chicken-pox vaccines they use human diploid cells, which<br/>
&gt; come from the organs of aborted fetuses.  Now, I must admit I can&#39;t recall<br/>
&gt; if any of the fetus &quot;cells&quot; (from the cell line) are actually in the<br/>
&gt; vaccine, but it is on an ingredients list.<br/>
&gt; I must make clear that no new fetuses are being used, the cell line has<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; established, so unless they feel need to establish another cell line, they<br/>
&gt; will not use another fetus.<br/>
&gt; Some of these fetuses were aborted over 20 years ago so it may be well<br/>
&gt; removed from the incidence for some people for ethical reasons, and there<br/>
&gt; are churches that agree with this belief, that its been so long it is all<br/>
&gt; right to use the vaccine.<br/>
&gt; I was first introduced this information in an article in Mothering<br/>
magazine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope that helps, and hope I didn&#39;t mislead anyone in my statement, I get<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; little worked up sometimes when it comes to such issues :)  and I may have<br/>
&gt; been unclear as to what I was talking about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope that helps!<br/>

&gt; You can only get shingles (Herpes Zoster) if you have HAD chicken pox.<br/>
Some<br/>
&gt; people may have had chicken pox in a very mild form and never knew they<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; it... or they had it as a child and their parents didn&#39;t remember.  It<br/>
&gt; appears (and I didn&#39;t know this!) that if you get the chicken pox vaccine<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re less likely to ever suffer from shingles!  Wow!  Now I wish my kids<br/>
&gt; had gotten the vaccine rather than having had chicken pox.  Thanks for<br/>

There is no evidence to support that.  The vaccine hasn&#39;t been around long<br/>
enough to show one way or the other.  Most cases of shingles occur in folks<br/>
over 50.  The vaccine has only been around 20 years.<br/>
<br/>
However, they do know that the vaccine causes shingles in at least 1 out of<br/>
1000 children.  Chicken pox was less than 1 out of 10,000 children.<br/>

  &gt; You can only get shingles (Herpes Zoster) if you have HAD chicken pox.<br/>
  Some<br/>
  &gt; people may have had chicken pox in a very mild form and never knew they<br/>
  had<br/>
  &gt; it... or they had it as a child and their parents didn&#39;t remember.  It<br/>
  &gt; appears (and I didn&#39;t know this!) that if you get the chicken pox<br/>
vaccine<br/>
  &gt; you&#39;re less likely to ever suffer from shingles!  Wow!  Now I wish my<br/>
kids<br/>
  &gt; had gotten the vaccine rather than having had chicken pox.  Thanks for<br/>
  &gt; asking the question--learn something new everyday.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Here&#39;s a link that describes it in more detail:<br/>

  &gt;   Can anyone explain shingles?  What is it?  Can you get shingles if you<br/>
  &gt;   DID have chicken pox or if you DID NOT have chicken pox?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-880308302">Is it the vaccine that is causing the shingles or, as is the case with<br/>

<br/>
  There is no evidence to support that.  The vaccine hasn&#39;t been around long<br/>
  enough to show one way or the other.  Most cases of shingles occur in<br/>
folks<br/>
  over 50.  The vaccine has only been around 20 years.<br/>
<br/>
  However, they do know that the vaccine causes shingles in at least 1 out<br/>
of<br/>
  1000 children.  Chicken pox was less than 1 out of 10,000 children.<br/>

  &gt; Yes, that is what I thought, but it appears that the vaccine lessons the<br/>

still for nit-picking or get it buzzed.  She chose getting it buzzed.  My <br/>

We took that route with out 5 year old when he came home from a weekend with grandma (she had made him try on &#39;sock hats&#39; at the store-I can only guess that is how he got them)  At any rate, I was pg and in NO mood to deal with a hyper kid who hates hair washing even without the stinky shampoo.<br/>
<br/>
I stuck him in the tub, shaved his head with a beard trimmer, and tossed his clothes in the dryer for about 3 cycles and never saw any signs of return.<br/>

&gt;   Thanks for all that information. I use my intuition on things of this <br/>
&gt;nature<br/>
&gt;   a lot, but I enjoy reading factual information. Could you tell me the <br/>
&gt;source<br/>
&gt;   you got this from, so I can keep it in my files? I appreciate the time <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;   take to post this.<br/>

night long to wash his or her hair........not.  And I&#39;d be really surprised <br/>
if that killed the nits, which is why you have to do the combing.<br/>
