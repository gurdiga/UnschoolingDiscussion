<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146415831">I just wanted to throw my 2 cents in here.  In 1982 when I was expecting boy <br/>
#1 my dh was just sure we were going to circumcise.  We were delivering at a <br/>
free-standing birthing center with a certified nurse-midwife and at some <br/>
point during our visits she started talking to us about those after birth <br/>
decisions, including circumcision.    We read the material she gave out and <br/>
I just turned to Gary and said &quot;No Way!&quot;  There are wayyyyy too many risks <br/>
involved and that&#39;s that!  He actually agreed and there was no turning back.<br/>
<br/>
Both our boys were taught how to care for themselves and are now 18 and 14 <br/>
and have never had a single problem.  I must share a little story about when <br/>
my 14 yo was born in 1987.  Because of a horrible insurance situation he was <br/>
born in a hospital but with a midwife in attendance.  Apparently when they <br/>
took him down to the nursery to weigh him (with dh in close attendance) <br/>
there was a little boy in there laying in the cribette on a papoose board <br/>
just crying his little heart out. No one was around.  The nurses were <br/>
otherwise occupied, his mother must have still been in her hospital room and <br/>
he had no one to hold him, caress him or let him know he was loved...  this <br/>
was the way he was treated AFTER his circ.  My dh told me all about this <br/>
little fellow with tears in his eyes.  It certainly cemented our decision <br/>
and confirmed for him that it was the right decision to make!<br/>
<br/>
As far as vaccinations go, we started off that way when dd was born in 1980, <br/>
but after a couple of very bad reactions and a recommendation by a skin dr <br/>
to call it quits, we did.  Now at 21 she&#39;s a little miffed at me because she <br/>
just joined the US Army and has to spend this first week at basic training <br/>
getting brought up to date on all those shots, but I don&#39;t regret it for a <br/>
minute.  At the time I was saving her life.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that&#39;s all for me for now!<br/>
<br/>

this and loving every minute of it!<br/>

Let your dd know that even if she had HAD all those shots, they&#39;d have given<br/>
them to her AGAIN.... that&#39;s what they did to my best friend (now 37) when<br/>
she joined the Army (at 18).... after proving that she had had all the<br/>
shots, they loaded up the gun anyway, and gave her the vac&#39;s again. Military<br/>
intelligence, my eye!<br/>
