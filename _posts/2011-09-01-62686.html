<div id="ygrps-yiv-987644861">I think this is a very interesting website, and I like when you post the links. I think most people have no idea how interesting history is, or just how much influence the past has on the present and the future. My kids enjoy making trips to my aunt&#39;s house to hear about our family history and my grandmother  ( recently passed away) used to tell us stories about growing up in the depression. They love it, but when they leave, the oldest two always talk about how much easier we have it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-136679862">Sandra,<br/>
We share similar backgrounds.  My generation on both sides was the first to<br/>
have a majority graduate high school much less college.  A very big deal<br/>
that my mother finished high school.  And even bigger deal that some of my<br/>
cousins and I could go to college. Both my parents were in single parent<br/>
homes during the Depression.   &quot;Leaving school to help out&quot; was about food<br/>
on the table not stylish clothes or cars or vacations.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad to see you mention that JT Gatto&#39;s view of &quot;free&quot; public schools<br/>
is a tad cultish.   Tax supported schools open to all (even if segregated)<br/>
and the GI Bill changed much of America.<br/>
<br/>
May I forward your post in its entirety to some other lists?   If so, with<br/>
or without your email address (are you up for Gatto groupies ranting at you?<br/>

<br/>
My grandfather was born in rural northern Italy in 1920 (I think) and had 12 siblings, but only 8 made it to adulthood.  He stopped going to school in elementary school.  I remember him telling me that he had to walk to school and that it was very hard in the winter time because they only had wooden clogs.  I also remember him telling me his only presents for Christmas were oranges.  <br/>
<br/>
When he was around 10 years old his whole family immigrated to Algeria (then a French department) and I know that he was apprenticed to a shoemaker, for a while (around age 11.)  He ended up working in constructions, (and also became somewhat of a soccer star) so his later life, and my father&#39;s childhood, were comfortable.  My father went to university.  <br/>
<br/>
Pretty recent history for me (not American history though ;-), and told to me by my grandfather himself (I wish he was still alive so I could ask him more.)  <br/>

I don&#39;t mind, but the e-mail address isn&#39;t actually part of the post, is it?<br/>
Maybe instead of my address, put a link to my page.  I don&#39;t want a bunch of private e-mail, no.<br/>

<br/>
My mom said she figured out there was no Santa, because a fw days before Christmas she could smell oranges.  Her mom had stored them in the loft of a house they were renting, and there were only boards between the rooms and the attic--no ceiling.  My mom made it to 10th grade at Carlsbad High school in southern New Mexico.  Eight siblings, six live to adulthood, one, maybe two graduated from high school (one maybe after he got back from WWII).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never really seen eye to eye with John Taylor Gatto. He seems to me a little obsessed with the idea that schools have always been a bad thing and I think there was a time when they were a good thing. I do try to reserve my own &quot;anti-school&quot; sentiments for people who haven&#39;t noticed that that time has passed but I&#39;m not always successful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725886219">I haven&#39;t read Gatto, or much anti-school stuff at all.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any essays or short works written that briefly tell the good and bad about school, now and then, and then why unschooling is a good choice, without being anti-school?  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I find it hard to explain why I am choosing not send my kids to school when people ask.  Its easier to explain why I want to homeschool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050110867">My maternal grandmother (born in 1913) and her four older siblings left<br/>
school when they completed 8th grade to work in the family grocery. That<br/>
same grandmother paid for my college tuition. I&#39;m very grateful to her. I<br/>
lived with her, my grandfather and one of my great aunts and her husband<br/>
after my parents divorced.<br/>
<br/>
I was one of those kids who asked for family stories instead of stories from<br/>
books, so I learned all kinds of interesting details about early 20th<br/>
century life in a small Midwestern farming community. Oranges for Christmas<br/>
were popular in Ohio too  - I heard about what a treat they were to my<br/>
grandparent&#39;s generation, I received one in the toe of my stocking every<br/>
Christmas, and now I put an orange in the toe of my daughters&#39; Christmas<br/>
stockings because it reminds me of my grandfather.<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
I think the demonizing of schools is often a phase that<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling parents pass through, in the same way that<br/>
deschooling is a phase.<br/>
<br/>
Long before I ever considered homeschooling or heard of unschooling, when my<br/>
children were very young, I was elected twice to our local school board. One<br/>
thing I learned from that experience was that there are more parents than<br/>
you would think who have issues that make school a better place than home.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I was aware of that when we were new homeschoolers (seven years<br/>
ago), I remember reading John Taylor Gatto and feeling enjoyably<br/>
self-righteous. His writing doesn&#39;t evoke the same response in me today.<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
Thank you for pointing out Shorpy. Another website I like is Retronaut. It<br/>
has photos, advertisements, magazine articles, film clips and more from the<br/>
19th and 20th centuries.<br/>
<br/>
Retronaut &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.howtobearetronaut.com/">http://www.howtobearetronaut.com/</a>&gt;<br/>
Last winter Anna and I took a series of home herbalist class together and<br/>
now I&#39;m interested in the history of herbal medicines. Retronaut published a<br/>
post featuring 19th century patent medicine trade cards.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it be great if there really was an Oil of Gladness or a Magical<br/>
Pain Extractor?<br/>
