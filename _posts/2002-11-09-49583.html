    Bright Ideas and True Confessions: How and What to Do and Why<br/>

Reading the Bible Without Fear of Religion [1] <br/>
<br/>
    A good way to learn about Renaissance English is to read it. The two most <br/>
available sources are the works of Shakespeare and the King james version of <br/>
the Bible. Of those two, the Bible is the easier to read and is closer to <br/>
everyday speech and writing of the period. <br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t learn to use the phrases and vocabulary of the sixteenth and <br/>
seventeenth centuries until you have a feel for how they do and do not fit <br/>
together. You can use the &quot;thee&quot;s and &quot;thou&quot;s without the pain of conjugation <br/>
and memorization by reading them until they sound natural. <br/>
<br/>
Here are some interesting passages which can be read painlessly and without <br/>
fear of religious effect. The first number is the chapter, and the second is <br/>
the verse. There will probably be a list of the books in order in the <br/>
beginning of the Bible. <br/>
<br/>
*   Esther 2:12 (harems) <br/>
*   Genesis 38:8-10 (birth control) <br/>
*   Judges 20:16 (a left-handed army) <br/>
*   Zechariah 5:1-2 (a flying roll) <br/>
*   Genesis 38:27-30 (a great story about unborn twins, and one sticks his <br/>
hand out. . .) <br/>
*   Leviticus 11:30 (unclean creeping things) <br/>
*   Isaiah 11:8 (cockatrices) <br/>
*   Genesis 30:14-16 (sex for mandrakes) <br/>
*   I Kings 16:9 (the captain is found drunk at the steward&#39;s house and the <br/>
king does horrible things for several verses following. Read verse 11 for an <br/>
interesting description of male-persons.)<br/>
<br/>
For a little more serious reading, try Genesis 27, the entire chapter. It&#39;s <br/>
the story of Jacob and Esau - disguise and intrigue. The chapters following <br/>
that are good, too (including the mandrake story recommended above, and a <br/>
genetics lesson).<br/>
<br/>
If you read a more modern version of the Bible you won&#39;t get the effect we&#39;re <br/>
after. Language like &quot;And the King said unto Haman, The silver is given to <br/>
thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee&quot; will be <br/>
changed to &quot;&#39;Keep the money,&#39; the king said to Haman, &#39;and do with the people <br/>
as you please.&#39;&quot; (Esther 3:11, chosen at random, first King James and then <br/>
New International) <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t recommend using &quot;seemeth&quot; in everyday speech, but the word order can <br/>
be used with our own verbs and pronouns. &quot;Do with this as seems good to you&quot; <br/>
sounds more formal and exotic than &quot;Do whatever you want to do with it.&quot; &quot;If <br/>
I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to <br/>
grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to <br/>
the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king <br/>
hath said. Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart. . .&quot; <br/>
See? Even the verses that don&#39;t say anything weighty and wonderful can be <br/>
pretty. If you don&#39;t own a King James Bible, check a thrift store, used book <br/>
store, or ask an older protestant friend of yours if you can borrow one or <br/>
have an extra. The library may have one you can check out. Regular bookstores <br/>
probably have them, and most religious supply houses will have. Don&#39;t steal <br/>
one from a motel room if you can help it. <br/>
<br/>

------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
    [1] A word to the devout: Please don&#39;t be offended by my suggestion that <br/>
it&#39;s possible to read lots of the Bible without finding much of religious <br/>
value. I&#39;ve scouted out these passages, and they&#39;re unlikely to bring anyone <br/>
closer to or further from God.<br/>

That was written a dozen years ago.<br/>

Now you can just go online to a searchable KJV.  <br/>
