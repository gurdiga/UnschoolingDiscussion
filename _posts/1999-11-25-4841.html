<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;When I used to schoolteach, my kids and I would discuss style a lot,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>getting a style of your own and how that must be done. I gradually came to<br/>
feel it was very difficult unless you were alone a lot, had time and space<br/>
to yourself, were free of the need to attend other people&#39;s urgencies all<br/>
the time - or the urgencies of a commercial world. How can you expect to be<br/>
unique if every minute you draw models from other people and the shadows of<br/>
other people drawn from television? How can the unique destiny that is in<br/>
every one of us exercise itself if you always submit to the scrutiny and<br/>
judgment of authorities? Authorities on what? Certainly not on you unless<br/>
you have been diminished into something predictable, tamed by regulation,<br/>
simplification, and rationalization. A steady diet of that will waste all<br/>
your time.&lt;&lt;<br/>
