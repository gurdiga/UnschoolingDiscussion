<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965923686">You might want to check it out.  I am passing on what a friend of mine wrote to the editor:<br/>
<br/>
Editor,<br/>
<br/>
Your article, &quot;Huckabee Draws Support of Home-School Families,&quot; said that conservative <br/>
Christians are &#147;the vast majority&#148; of the homeschoolers, which is inaccurate. A 2003 U.S. <br/>
Census survey reported that only 33% of homeschooling households cited religion as a factor <br/>
in why they homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible that homeschooling liberals and moderates may swing the political tide.  <br/>
According a 2001 survey by the The Barna Group, the majority of American homeschoolers <br/>
are non-white.  And don&#39;t forget that many evangelicals may be led by their conscience to <br/>
vote for a Democrat based on his or her record on the environment.<br/>
<br/>
The statement, &quot;As a group, [homeschoolers] are &#133; in a constant struggle with public <br/>
authorities&quot; is misguided.  Homeschooling removes the child from the local authority&#39;s <br/>
jurisdiction, so mostly any &quot;struggle&quot; with outside parties is resolved.  There are ample legal <br/>
protections for homeschoolers in most states.  Colleges now welcome applications from <br/>
well-educated homeschoolers.</div>

This isn&#39;t correct.<br/>
<br/>
They create emergencies and enemies.  It&#39;s not a good topic for this  <br/>
list, because it&#39;s all American politics and not about unschooling.   <br/>
I&#39;d prefer to avoid ALL politics on this list.  But if you or your  <br/>
friend doubt the claim that fundamentalist Christian unschoolers are  <br/>
involving themselves heavily in presidential politics, look up HSLDA,  <br/>
and maybe look up Sandy Rios who was my &quot;opponent&quot; on that radio show  <br/>
the other night.   But let&#39;s don&#39;t talk about it here.<br/>

Maybe a good place to discuss it would be here, though.<br/>

There&#39;s a politics folder there and it&#39;s easy to start your own topic.<br/>
