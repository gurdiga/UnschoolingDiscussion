<div id="ygrps-yiv-132143388">Sorry Paula, but I don&#39;t think I would be easily convinced. I have been <br/>
through and seen people grieve many times. There is a definite process that <br/>
occurs in different order for different people. Knowing the stages makes it <br/>
easier to see where you are in the process and what is happening to oneself.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Paula, Please explain why you don&#39;t believe there are the stages of grief. <br/>
&gt;I am very curious to know, since I actually do help a lot of people and <br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t want to encourage them with a lie, if I knew a better truth. Bonni<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to agree.  When my sister died suddenly, I went into shock <br/>
and stayed that way for 6 months.  I cleaned, cooked, and cared for <br/>
my family.  I drove my children to lessons and sat quietly.  I was <br/>
polite and answered direct questions, but that was all.  Many <br/>
friends drifted away.  Some told me that I was boring.  Some told me <br/>
that I needed to snap out of it.  Some told me that I needed to <br/>
pray.  I was incapable of doing any of those things.  I didn&#39;t care <br/>
what people thought.  Emotionally, I was running on empty and I <br/>
could not relate to anyone other than my husband and kids.  <br/>
<br/>
One day, the shock lessened enough for me to let the pain in.  I <br/>
broke down and cried for days.  After that, I began to arise from my <br/>
stupor and started to be able to relate to others.  I am sure that <br/>
some people watched me for those 6 months and thought that I didn&#39;t <br/>
care.  I believe that it was a matter of survival.  I was <br/>
emotionless for months becasue the pain was more than I could <br/>
handle.  <br/>
<br/>
My brother handled it differently.  He became a crusader with a <br/>
vengeance.  He attended every court appearance of the men who killed <br/>
my sister.  He used anger to handle his pain.  I think that we both <br/>
did what we needed to get through it.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that people should judge by appearances.  We are all <br/>
so complex and we hide most of ourselves deep inside where others <br/>
cannot see.  I don&#39;t know what Andrea&#39;s husband is really feeling.  <br/>
I can&#39;t see how anyone else could know either.<br/>
