<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869872249">Hi, all.  I am taking a summer vacation from email or some of it that is.  I just<br/>
need to cut down on my computer time for awhile, because there are so many<br/>
wonderful things to do outside off-line! :-)  So I am going no mail for<br/>
awhile........... but I will check in when I am not at the beach, pool or<br/>
park.......... This is a  great list!  I&#39;ll be back.......Have a wonderful<br/>
summer!!!  :-)  Shannon in CA</div>
