Do you want to talk about this? &#39;Cause I would love to. I deal with it <br/>
everyday. The anger isn&#39;t just a black thing -- it drives through my mostly <br/>
Asian and Hispanic neighborhood every day and night. It comes on my TV. I <br/>
meet it at work every night.<br/>
<br/>
Why is the anger manifest?<br/>

I thought this sounded like Bob maybe wanting to turn something that was <br/>
getting ugly around toward more of a discussion.  I could be wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-463071123">I think I may be able to tie the whole anger thing into unschooling <br/>
by the end of this thing.  I believe that most anger comes from lack <br/>
of acceptance, lack of compassion and fear.  Anger is not a race <br/>
thing, it&#39;s always been with all of us.  I believe it&#39;s part of our <br/>
lives because we don&#39;t do what is natural, we&#39;re constantly trying to <br/>
change others, change ourselves and fit in.  Improving ourselves <br/>
would be the better goal to me.  Unschooling is one of my ways of <br/>
improving my son&#39;s life, my husband&#39;s and my own.<br/>
<br/>
I also think history cannot be ignored, it shouldn&#39;t be worshipped <br/>
but it should be respected.  (And the following has nothing to do <br/>
with race, Africans and Europeans both played a hand in the slave <br/>
trade.)  The people who settled the Americas originally using <br/>
genocide, slavery and violence started a ball in motion that is still <br/>
rolling today.  Sadly the sins (self-inflicted nonsense) of the <br/>
father are visited on the son.  Our foundation is not one of love but <br/>
of rape, violence and forced assimilation.  Why do we expect that not <br/>
to be carried down through the generations?  That does not excuse <br/>
destructive behavior but it can explain it.  People don&#39;t spring <br/>
forth fully formed from the ground, they are born to people who have  <br/>
taught them, at times brainwashed and influenced them to hate the <br/>
same things they hate and to love the things they love.  It takes <br/>
time for hateful teaching to be diluted.  It&#39;s not just going to <br/>
disappear in 10 generations or even 20 and mostly likely not 30.  <br/>
Whether we acknowledge <br/>
it consciously or not there is a script running in our heads most of <br/>
the day.  It&#39;s our parents voice, our teachers voices, our preacher, <br/>
our oppressor, etc.  Destructively angry people haven&#39;t heard many <br/>
compassionate voices.  I don&#39;t believe they can hear them most of the <br/>
time because they are so infrequent in their world.  Criticizing them <br/>
only adds fuel to the fire.  That&#39;s why I take issue with Stanley <br/>
Crouch, though I do agree with him on many things and don&#39;t consider <br/>
him an Uncle Tom.  However, I&#39;d be more impressed with him if he shut <br/>
his mouth and moved his ass.  He talks alot but offers no substantial <br/>
solutions.  He&#39;s also one of those people who tells people how they <br/>
SHOULD be.  As long as he&#39;s telling people what to do to be <br/>
acceptable he&#39;s a contributor to the problems.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think people can be forced to stop being destructive, but <br/>
individuals can avoid adding fuel to the fire.  Life is a journey <br/>
that needs to be played out, patiently.  I&#39;m an optimist who believes <br/>
the world is getting better.  But we have to allow the storm to play <br/>
out.  <br/>
<br/>
To tie this into unschooling. I started out on the homeschooling <br/>
journey with anger in my heart at the system, at my parents who <br/>
bought into the system and at the world in general. I was tired of <br/>
feeling unhappy and tired of feeling I had to do things the way <br/>
everyone told me I should, because those shoulds went against my <br/>
nature.  I think I&#39;ve moved towards unschooling because I&#39;m not angry <br/>
anymore,  I don&#39;t fear as much and  I&#39;ve accepted that it&#39;s ok to let <br/>
nature take it&#39;s course, I <br/>
don&#39;t have to constantly fight my own nature, which is basically <br/>
good.  I can allow my son the room to be himself and to see himself <br/>
as a good and worthy person, something missing on a wide scale in the <br/>
black community.  <br/>
