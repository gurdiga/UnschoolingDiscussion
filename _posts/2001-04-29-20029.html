<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080053108">This was posted on another list I belong to!  I<br/>
thought you might enjoy it! <br/>
<br/>
Reasons why the English language is so hard to learn:<br/>
<br/>
1) The bandage was wound around the wound.<br/>
2) The farm was used to produce produce.<br/>
3) The dump was so full that it had to refuse more<br/>
refuse.<br/>
4) We must polish the Polish furniture.<br/>
5) He could lead if he would get the lead out.<br/>
6) The soldier decided to desert his dessert in the<br/>
desert.<br/>
7) Since there is no time like the present, he thought<br/>
it was time to<br/>
present the present.<br/>
8) A bass was painted on the head of the bass drum.<br/>
9) When shot at, the dove dove into the bushes.<br/>
10) I did not object to the object.<br/>
11) The insurance was invalid for the invalid.<br/>
12) There was a row among the oarsmen about how to<br/>
row.<br/>
13) They were too close to the door to close it.<br/>
14) The buck does funny things when the does are<br/>
present.<br/>
15) A seamstress and a sewer fell down into a sewer<br/>
line.<br/>
16) To help with planting, the farmer taught his sow<br/>
to sow.<br/>
17) The wind was too strong to wind the sail.<br/>
18) After a number of injections my jaw got number.<br/>
19) Upon seeing the tear in the painting I shed a<br/>
tear.<br/>
20) I had to subject the subject to a series of tests.<br/>
21) How can I intimate this to my most intimate<br/>
friend?<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s face it - English is a crazy language.<br/>
There is no egg in eggplant nor ham in hamburger;<br/>
neither apple nor pine in <br/>
pineapple.<br/>
English muffins weren&#39;t invented in England or French<br/>
fries in France.<br/>
Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which aren&#39;t<br/>
sweet, are meat.<br/>
<br/>
We take English for granted.  But if we explore its<br/>
paradoxes, we find that <br/>
quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and<br/>
a guinea pig is <br/>
neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.  And why is it<br/>
that writers write <br/>
but fingers don&#39;t fing, grocers don&#39;t groce and<br/>
hammers don&#39;t ham?<br/>
If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn&#39;t the plural<br/>
of booth<br/>
beeth?<br/>
One goose, 2 geese.  So one moose, 2 meese?<br/>
One index, 2 indices?<br/>
Doesn&#39;t it seem crazy that you can make amends but not<br/>
one amend. <br/>
If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of<br/>
all but one of them, what do you call <br/>
it?<br/>
If teachers taught, why didn&#39;t preachers praught?<br/>
If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a<br/>
humanitarian eat?<br/>
Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be<br/>
committed to an asylum <br/>
for the verbally insane.  In what language do people<br/>
recite at a play and play at a recital? <br/>
Ship by truck and send cargo by ship?<br/>
Have noses that run and feet that smell?<br/>
How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same,<br/>
while a wise man and a <br/>
wise guy are opposites?<br/>
You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language<br/>
in which your house can <br/>
burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form<br/>
by filling it out and <br/>
in which an alarm goes off by going on.<br/>
English was invented by people, not computers, and it<br/>
reflects the creativity <br/>
of the human race (which, of course, isn&#39;t a race at<br/>
all).<br/>
That is why, when the stars are out, they are visible,<br/>
but when the lights <br/>
are out, they are invisible<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-158285557">LOL! If anyone wants a read more about the pesky<br/>
English language and just as funny and serious at<br/>
times(wars have been fought just about what language<br/>
one spoke). Read Bill Bryson&#39;s The Mother Tongue:<br/>
English and How it Got That Way. <br/>
