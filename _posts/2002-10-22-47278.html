<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795792793">Here&#39;s another one, from Family Pasttimes (but we lost the pieces...)<br/>
<br/>
Round-Up.<br/>
<br/>
Esther and I also play a modified game of scrabble where we help each other.  Pasttimes also makes the game and the rules are probably different, but Esther and I have our own version using an UPWORDS board. (it is also similar to solicorss)<br/>
<br/>
There are two ways...one, we randomly place 7 tiles on the board, then try and make words by taking 7 tiles each, refilling when we need to.<br/>
Or simply take 7 tiles each, making words as we can.  We don&#39;t combine, but my seven tiles are kept separate from hers and vice versa, but we do help each other.<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

who wants to know if anyone knows of a cooperative math game?<br/>
