<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503066983">There was something on Discover (I think but it could have been the History<br/>
channel), one of those short clips about stuff that is coming up, about a<br/>
new discovery/find that has to do with that whole era and authenticating<br/>
something or another--Robin Hood or King Arthur, etc.  At any rate, they<br/>

&gt; &gt; Bending this off in another direction, we were watching Robin Hood<br/>
&gt; &gt; this week. (The one w. Errol Flynn.)  To me, Robin Hood is just about<br/>
&gt; &gt; the most inspiring character in all of English literature.  How much<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the tales about Robin Hood are true?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Very little!  There is some documentation for a Robin of Locksley (don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know how to spell it).  Richard is usually made out to be a better<br/>
&gt; king than he is while John is made out to be a worse king than he was.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Richard basically viewed England as a treasury to finance his various<br/>
&gt; wars in France and other places.  John genuinely did care for England<br/>
&gt; but he was a very bad king who ended up losing most of his family&#39;s<br/>
&gt; French posessions.  Henry II (their father) held more of France<br/>
&gt; in vassalage than the King of France did!  They were a fascinating<br/>
&gt; family - I read Alison Weir&#39;s biography _Eleanor of Aquitaine_ recently.<br/>
&gt; No mention of a Robin Hood there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The common people were treated horribly by the nobility so he is<br/>
&gt; probably as historic as Arthur is!<br/>

Last night my son pulled out a book we have from DK Eyewitness Classics,<br/>
which is their Robin Hood version (simple) with historical notes in the<br/>
margin.  (It was right here all along, I just didn&#39;t think of it.)<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read the inserts and sidebars yet as ds always wants to stick to<br/>
the story w/o digression.<br/>
