I think that people are just stupid and many don&#39;t really understand that <br/>
when they make comments about someone&#39;s family, it really hurts people&#39;s <br/>
feelings.  I think they put themselves in someone else&#39;s position and are <br/>
glad they are not in that position.  Then they say it outloud without <br/>
thinking.  Strangers should never say anything negative about someone else&#39;s <br/>
family.  I have a close friend who adopted a beautiful boy and girl from <br/>
Korea and she gets insensitive and rude comments sometimes from strangers in <br/>
the store.  It&#39;s hard for me to understand why anyone would make any comments <br/>
to someone they don&#39;t know.  I think some people are just stupid and nosey.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803443046">I think it depends on the comment; I could never do that (have five children<br/>
etc.) doesn&#39;t bother me; I think it is kind of a praise: I could never<br/>
handle that many children without going crazy...similar to, I don&#39;t think I<br/>
could ever have the guts to parachute out of a plane.  Different from: Only<br/>
idiots would skydive (meant, not as a tease or something.)  <br/>
<br/>
Many people with one or two children realize how difficult it is for them<br/>
with *just* the one, and think people who have more and manage not to end<br/>
doing a decent job are something special.<br/>
<br/>
As for adopting a child from another race, or marrying a person for another<br/>
race, well, as sad as it is that people so divide others, it is part and<br/>
parcel, at least today, of such decisions to get questions.  Hopefully some<br/>
day that will not be true, but as of yet, it is.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m kinda changing the subject, but that &quot;outloud&quot; comment reminded me of <br/>
something Holly has said a few times.<br/>
<br/>
If she wants to make a kind of snide comment, or wants to indicate that an <br/>
opening for a snide comment has come and she has refrained, she pauses <br/>
quietly, looks surprised and says &quot;Did I say that out loud?&quot; kinda <br/>
innocently, having not said anything but just that. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a smart aleck sometimes. &lt;g&gt;  But she&#39;s not mean, and that&#39;s nice.<br/>
