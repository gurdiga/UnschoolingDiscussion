At least you get wisdom with age! <br/>
I shouldn&#39;t say that, maybe you were born this way?<br/>

  So do I.  And if I *sometimes* find your way of putting things abrasive, I <br/>
  can choose not to read them.  So far it hasn&#39;t bothered me enough to stop.<br/>
<br/>
  I also enjoy reading Lynda&#39;s posts.  Lots to chew on there.<br/>
<br/>
  I also enjoy reading most of Bridget&#39;s posts.  She often gives me something <br/>
  new to think about.<br/>
<br/>
  What I&#39;m really tired of reading is the bickering.  I remember my mother&#39;s <br/>
  fave thing to say when me sister and I were bickering.  &quot;I&#39;m going to knock <br/>
  your heads together.&quot;  Sometimes I&#39;d like to do a cyber head-knocking <br/>
  around here.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
