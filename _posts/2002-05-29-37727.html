&lt;&lt; I guess my question for you all is how you can be sure you aren&#39;t <br/>
 steering when you mean to be strewing?  Do you make sure your kids <br/>
 don&#39;t get so caught up in on thing that they never experience any <br/>
 others?  How? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because it&#39;s simply there, available. It matters not one whit if they use it <br/>
or not, it&#39;s just THERE.<br/>
My kids are intelligent, thoughtful, articulate human beings that are very <br/>
capable of making choices and would never be so totally wishy, washy as to do <br/>
something endlessly that they didn&#39;t LOVE. They also love trying new things <br/>
ALL the time, there is NO danger of my strewing becoming a guiding force. <br/>
