I know it is me and not you, but I&#39;m missing something.  First, in our house<br/>
we only have one shower, and low water pressure so we can&#39;t run more than<br/>
one thing at a time.  But, if Joe is in his shower, what did he care what<br/>
Alyssa and Sierra were doing? Did they have to shower at the same time? And<br/>
why not just turn off Alyssa and Sierra&#39;s shower till they were ready to get<br/>
in? Or why not just get in with Alyssa in the first place and then let<br/>
Sierra decide? Was there some sort of other time factor? That is where we<br/>
run into difficutlies; or when I don&#39;t want to spend an 1 1/2 waiting for<br/>
two kids to get out of the bath (Esther is old enough to be in the bath on<br/>
her own, but Tehila isn&#39;t old enough to leave for alone. I&#39;m not comfortable<br/>
in leaving Esther and Tehila alone for a long period of time, though I will<br/>
for quick runs to get something etc.).<br/>

<br/>
  The way it&#39;s been done for ages now is that all 3 kids shower at the same time. The kids have decided to do it that way and it&#39;s been working. This way they all get in and out pretty much at the same time and no one feels like they are missing anything. Sometimes they go at different times, it&#39;s up to them. Joseph  (not Joe my husband but the son) was getting in and Sierra and Alyssa decided to shower together in the other bathroom. Sometimes Sierra asks to go by herself and sometimes Alyssa will want to shower with me or who wants to take a bath, etc. This was already decided on and everyone was okay with it. That&#39;s why it was so upsetting. No one was being asked to do anything they didn&#39;t want to. And the shower is never started unless the kids say they are ready. They were ready. Then Sierra decided to be silly. Still okay. They&#39;re kids. But it just went past that. Joe did get a little frustrated and raised his voice and then knew he shouldn&#39;t have and apologized. By then it was way too late.<br/>

I just finished reading Sandra&#39;s Leaning on a Truck (again) and maybe<br/>
instead of trying to get Sierra to talk when she is upset about how she is<br/>
feeling you could give her some space to calm down then see if she wants to<br/>
do something with you, just the two of you, a puzzle or something. Maybe<br/>
with something else to focus on she will be able to start talking. Even if<br/>
she doesn&#39;t, the time together can&#39;t hurt!<br/>

Hope this helps.<br/>

<br/>
Apparently it&#39;s not working now.<br/>
<br/>
Flexibility seems to be a better policy than convincing kids to do what they <br/>
did before just because they did it before.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This was already decided on and everyone was okay with it. That&#39;s why it <br/>
was so upsetting. No one was being asked to do anything they didn&#39;t want <br/>
to.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you ever say &quot;Yes&quot; to wanting to do something and realize that you said <br/>
yes without really thinking, just kind of automatically?<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t you just sprinkle water from a wet hand on her and say &quot;Magical Shower&quot; <br/>
and call it done?<br/>
<br/>
I think it was the parental expectation that was the problem.  My best <br/>
recommendation is to loosen up and let her be crazed for a while.  She won&#39;t <br/>
be this way when she&#39;s fourteen.  Sometime it will quit, but the more you <br/>
react to it strongly, the harder it might be for her to give it up on her <br/>
own.  If she feels like she&#39;ll be doing you a big favor by changing, she <br/>
might rather not do that.  If you leave it as either way&#39;s okay, she&#39;ll <br/>
choose for herself.  And freaking has no benefit in and of itself.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The harder I try  to talk to Sierra and understand why she&#39;s doing what <br/>
she&#39;s doing, the more disruptive she&#39;s becoming. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Then don&#39;t talk to her about it or ask why.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could play with her, sometime when the other kids aren&#39;t around and <br/>
say &quot;You be me, and I&#39;ll be you.&quot;  Then after playing really nicely for a <br/>
while, you could act like she does sometimes, and say, in her voice, &quot;Guess <br/>
why I&#39;m being this way, Mom&quot; (or whatever she calls you) and then she, as <br/>
you, can say something.  It might be profound and it might not be.  Maybe <br/>
she&#39;ll get angry that you mimic her.  If so, let it go.  Don&#39;t even talk <br/>
about it.  Later when she says that made her mad or she doesn&#39;t do that, you <br/>
could casually say it seems like it sometimes to you.  And leave it again.  <br/>
She&#39;ll need to think about it in little bits over time, probably, since she <br/>
likely doesn&#39;t understand it herself one bit yet.<br/>

have jumped in with you and Alyssa and maybe not. But the frustration would <br/>
have been avoided, maybe, if you had said it was OK not to take a shower. I <br/>
know yelling is a knee jerk reaction to all the frustration built up but I <br/>
try to tell myself is that how I would treat my DH.  No probably not.  If he <br/>
didn&#39;t want to shower I certainly wouldn&#39;t try to make him.  I hate to be <br/>
yelled at too.  <br/>

was saying come on get in the shower..over and over I might have gone in and <br/>
said come on Alyssa, I&#39;ll get in the shower with you.  End of problem.  If <br/>
Sierra came in good if not OK too.  If when I got out Sierra then wanted to <br/>
shower I would let her or I would take one with her too.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  You&#39;re right and it wasn&#39;t and she ended up not taking one. Thing is I didn&#39;t know what was going on until it was too late. Joe has been in pain for a week now and not working like he needs to and just out of sorts. Plus he really doesn&#39;t always remember to do the right thing with the kids. He&#39;s trying, but sometimes slips. I have been feeling awful and from in the living room where I was, I couldn&#39;t hear what was going on.<br/>
<br/>
  The shower wasn&#39;t a big deal. But it was an example of what sends Sierra into a tizzy. Simple little things like that. Things that are just fine one minute and a whole other story the next. Just that quick.<br/>

Hey Mary....I read all the responses to your post....It must be sooo <br/>
confusing dealing with this.  One moment everything is going along just <br/>
fine and then EXPLOSION!  Suggestion:  perhaps you might start keeping a <br/>
chart of her moods on a daily basis indicating the timing of certain events <br/>
such as tantrums and crying spells to see if you start seeing any patterns <br/>
(and for perhaps any future prof. help....)<br/>
<br/>
In the case of the shower thing...the only additional thing I might have <br/>
tried was to have taken her away from the action WITHOUT any further words <br/>
and hugged her until she stopped screaming.  Let hubby deal with the other <br/>
kids as you see to Sierra and have him calm the others down.  Then I would <br/>
have tried to see what her take on the situation was re to shower or not.<br/>
<br/>
This is what it sounded to me: at the point when your husband tried to get <br/>
her to stop and get into the shower, she was soooo wound up in her <br/>
EXPERIENCE, that she COULDN&#39;T stop on her own, and the transition was too <br/>
abrupt for her.  So she started crying which wound her up even more.  When <br/>
you entered the picture and began talking to her that added a whole new <br/>
demand on her system.  Then you touched her (grabbed her hand)  adding a <br/>
new sensory element and at this point she is so overwhelmed, she <br/>
SCREAMED.  Her system can&#39;t handle anything more.  You see it as a <br/>
tantrum.  She feels it as uncontrollable sensory overload.  She is unable <br/>
to stop her emotions, senses, whatever, she&#39;s scared, needs help, and <br/>
doesn&#39;t know how to get it.  Often removal from the scene, the noise; quiet <br/>
and then your hug which brings her back to herself and reassures her that <br/>
she has control once again, will allow her to once again be able to think!<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t profess to be an expert.  I just have a kid who went through what <br/>
seemed like similar experiences.  Research and diagnosis indicated this <br/>
type of experience behind the scenes.  If none of the other posts seem <br/>
likely, try this one on for size and see if it fits in future dealings with <br/>
Sierra!    Knowing what&#39;s going on for me, always gave me so much more <br/>
patience for all the unpleasant stuff.....<br/>

&gt;she&#39;s doing, the more disruptive she&#39;s becoming.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My sister used to go crazy in a second.  REALLY angry.  Or REALLY scared. <br/>
<br/>
Partly it was just kind of a hair-trigger biochemical thing with her.  She <br/>
changes fast.  Whatever that means physically, the chemicals that go to <br/>
people&#39;s blood and brains comes really fast with her and dissipates really <br/>
fast too.  She flares up.   It was even worse when she was an adult.<br/>
<br/>
One time she was all a-rant with me about something, and I said &quot;Everything <br/>
is the last straw with you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s like you have this cartload of straw, and to calm down you just take <br/>
off one single straw, so that you can maintain again, but the next thing that <br/>
happens is THE LAST STRAW!  You need to unload about HALF that straw if you <br/>
want to be able to handle anything calmly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If this is anything like your daughter, what you might help her do is unload <br/>
a bunch of that straw.  Find out a dozen or two dozen things to do to make <br/>
her life more comfortable, more calm, more interesting and appealing to her.  <br/>
Find out what others (including parents) are doing that irritates her, and <br/>
put those on the list of things to avoid doing if possible.<br/>
<br/>
I hate the sound of nail clippers.  I can&#39;t stand it.  If people in my family <br/>
said &quot;That&#39;s stupid, get over it,&quot; I wouldn&#39;t like them as much as I do.  <br/>
What they do is say &quot;I&#39;m going to close the door because I&#39;m going to clip my <br/>
nails,&quot; or will say &quot;I have to clip my nails, mom,&quot; and I&#39;ll say &quot;I need to <br/>
go tof range for my nervous system to have it&#39;s shuddering freak-out.  (I <br/>
think it&#39;s like some people are about chalk on a chalkboard, nails on a sink, <br/>
or fingers pulled across balloons.  None of those sounds bother me, but I&#39;m <br/>
careful not to make those noises because I know how painful nail clippers can <br/>
be for me.)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone in your family is doing anything that they KNOW bothers that child <br/>
and they&#39;re doing it anyway, that&#39;s no more okay than if they were walking by <br/>
and slapping her.  Her stress level will stay too high for her to function in <br/>
a calm and healthy manner.  <br/>
<br/>
If people in your family are pressing her to &quot;act right&quot; instead of helping <br/>
her FEEL right, the problem is the family and not the child.  <br/>
<br/>
She should feel safer and more loved right now than she ever will feel again <br/>
in her life, if you can manage that.  And showers aren&#39;t safety issues, in <br/>
most cases.   If she gets acid or bleach splashed on her, throw her in the <br/>
shower screaming.  If you are thinking &quot;shower time&quot; because of the clock, or <br/>
beause of what your mother used to do, or because of ANYTHING that isn&#39;t that <br/>
child directly, shower time should be thrown out and that energy put into <br/>
loving your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
If that seems too dramatic or impassioned, maybe you need more drama and <br/>
passion in your relationships with your kids.  They won&#39;t get today back.  <br/>
Make it as good as can be.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m just thinking out loud here.  I am still working on it, but I would have been frustrated too.  And if you and Joe have been feeling awful all week I can see how things could have gotten frustrating more quickly than usual.  We&#39;re all human.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I think it sounds like Sierra is developing a pattern of behavior that is not beneficial to her or the rest of the family, and she probably doesn&#39;t understand it herself.<br/>
<br/>
If she changes that quickly, I think I would just &quot;change with her&quot; and let it go.  Don&#39;t talk about it, don&#39;t try to &quot;understand&quot; it.  Just accept it and let it go.<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering if by focusing so much attention on it (for the sake of understanding) if its backfiring on you by making her feel overwhelmed or something.<br/>
<br/>
See if it helps to just &quot;roll with it&quot; and not focus on it.<br/>

    &lt;&lt;Maybe making her take a shower isn&#39;t worth the disruption to the rest of the <br/>
    house.&gt;&gt;<br/>

    You&#39;re right and it wasn&#39;t and she ended up not taking one. Thing is I didn&#39;t know what was going on until it was too late.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-591094944">From: Christina Morrissey <br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;This is what it sounded to me: at the point when your husband tried to get <br/>
  her to stop and get into the shower, she was soooo wound up in her <br/>
  EXPERIENCE, that she COULDN&#39;T stop on her own, and the transition was too <br/>
  abrupt for her.  So she started crying which wound her up even more.  When <br/>
  you entered the picture and began talking to her that added a whole new <br/>
  demand on her system.  Then you touched her (grabbed her hand)  adding a <br/>
  new sensory element and at this point she is so overwhelmed, she <br/>
  SCREAMED.  Her system can&#39;t handle anything more.  You see it as a <br/>
  tantrum.  She feels it as uncontrollable sensory overload.  She is unable <br/>
  to stop her emotions, senses, whatever, she&#39;s scared, needs help, and <br/>
  doesn&#39;t know how to get it.  Often removal from the scene, the noise; quiet <br/>
  and then your hug which brings her back to herself and reassures her that <br/>
  she has control once again, will allow her to once again be able to think!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks Christina, it sounds like that is exactly what happened with her. I have been making a note lately as to when and under what circumstances Sierra has her meltdowns. This is just all so new to us. We&#39;ve never come across anything like this before. I never even understood about some children being extremely sensitive and all. It makes so much sense though when I look back on things. I remember Sierra having a cyst on her arm that had to be removed. They had given her topical numbing stuff to put on it before they injected it further to numb it and then have it removed. I used the stuff myself to see how it worked and it literally numbed the skin so you couldn&#39;t feel anything. Well when the time came, she screamed like someone was ripping her heart out. It was awful and so hard to get the problem taken care of under those circumstances. I just couldn&#39;t understand what the big deal was when you couldn&#39;t feel anything. Now I get it and realize how it must have been for her. If only I would have known then. The term that comes to my mind (from relatives) is overly sensitive and that doesn&#39;t help but says a whole lot about a kid just being hard to handle instead of truly having a problem.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve found that Sierra does so much better when I just leae her alone when she gets that way. Holding her seems to make her cry harder and longer. I guess again too much when she doesn&#39;t need it. Last night after the episode, she curled up under a blanket in bed totally hidden. We just left her alone and she came out a little while later like nothing ever happened. I just have a hard time thinking me leaving her alone is best. Seems like as a mom, I should be able to DO something to help. To be there for her to make it all better. It works with the other 3. Although now that I think about it, Tara likes to be alone at first whenever there is a crisis. She likes the comfort later after she&#39;s calmed down. Maybe all those years of my being there made it worse when I should have left her alone. Hindsight! <br/>
<br/>
  So thank you so much for making me understand what could possibly be going on in her mind. I will have a long talk with Joe tonight and hopefully we can do what&#39;s best for her so she can get through all this. <br/>

<br/>
With people not feeling their best there are going to be moments more<br/>
stressful than usual.<br/>
<br/>
Your husband played with her at first, just as if her game was a great<br/>
idea and fun for him too.   Then he got tired of it and wanted it over<br/>
long before Sierra would have liked.   It&#39;s not her fault he wasn&#39;t in<br/>
the mood to play.   It&#39;s not her fault he opted into the game under false<br/>
pretenses. (not planning on finishing it)   It&#39;s not her fault grown ups<br/>
(sick ones or stressed ones) get grumpy at little girls.<br/>
<br/>
She had all that bad stuff happen to her, I&#39;d say she had her reasons for<br/>
getting upset.   <br/>
Man, would you want a little girl who couldn&#39;t express herself when<br/>
something bad happened?  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s communicating all over the place, Mary.   Maybe in a different way<br/>
than what you&#39;re used to but she&#39;s doing it.    Let her be herself<br/>
without a fight.   She won&#39;t get another chance to be a seven year old,<br/>
just let her be the one she wants to be.    If you don&#39;t understand her<br/>
right now, just find a way to not fight with her. <br/>
<br/>
If she gets too stinky, take her swimming. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Just because you couldn&#39;t feel anything doesn&#39;t mean she couldn&#39;t.  People&#39;s <br/>
nervous systems must be at LEAST as different as their noses, or their hair, <br/>
or their brains...   since we readily admit brains are very different, <br/>
&quot;nerves,&quot; being part of that, must be too.<br/>
<br/>
My husband has a very high pain threshhold.  He can keep functioning with <br/>
broken bones and serious sprains and pulls.  He had back problems when he was <br/>
younger.  One night he literally could not get up from where he had been <br/>
sitting on the floor.  People helped him up on the couch, he rested a bit, <br/>
hobbled to the car and went to the emergency room.  The doctor was stunned.  <br/>
Medically, he shouldn&#39;t have been able to walk or move at all.  Nobody told <br/>
Keith!<br/>
<br/>
I, on the other hand, can become temporarily incapacitated from stubbing my <br/>
toe or hitting my head.  BLINDING, real pain.  It goes away in a bit, and <br/>
deep breathing helps a whole lot.  But those first few seconds cannot be <br/>
reasoned away at all.  It&#39;s real.<br/>
<br/>
-=- We just left her alone and she came out a little while later like nothing <br/>
ever happened. I just have a hard time thinking me leaving her alone is best. <br/>
Seems like as a mom, I should be able to DO something to help. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Seems leaving her in a quiet place, undisturbed, was what she wanted.  Doing <br/>
it sweetly instead of punitively will help.  I&#39;m guilty of sometimes getting <br/>
frustrated with Holly and getting away from her in a meaner-than-necessary <br/>
way.  It would be better if I just said &quot;I&#39;m going to go sort laundry&quot; in a <br/>
happy or  neutral way and went away, it would keep her from feeling like I <br/>
wanted to be where she wasn&#39;t.  I keep reminding myself, and I get better.  I <br/>
don&#39;t remember having those incidents with Marty or Kirby.  Maybe I did but <br/>
it was different because there was a younger child to attend to and it made a <br/>
calm, good-mother way for me to leave.  With Holly being the youngest, I just <br/>
have to leave sometimes.  <br/>
