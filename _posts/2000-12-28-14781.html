<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445548865"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;These &#39;kids&#39; of mine are boys aged 17, 13, 10!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi, Carol --<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize their ages.  I tend to assume that everyone must have a 6<br/>
year old, because I do. &lt;g&gt;  Also, I probably underestimate how much older<br/>
kids actually &quot;need&quot; their mother when she&#39;s busy weeding.  Certainly yours<br/>
are old enough to make their own sandwiches and tie their own shoes &lt;g&gt;<br/>
which are the things that I get interrupted for.<br/>
<br/>
You know, having you deeply involved in weeding does create a great time<br/>
for them to come out and talk to you.  With older kids, I&#39;ve heard the best<br/>
talks come at times when you aren&#39;t staring too intently into each others<br/>
faces  -- like in the car, or doing dishes together.  I think this is<br/>
especially true for boys, who don&#39;t want to let down their guard if you are<br/>
actually facing them.<br/>
