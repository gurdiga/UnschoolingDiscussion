<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
I have to agree with this 100%. I am 41 years old, I was raised the same way ..very controlling parents when it same to food. We only had candy in our house at Easter and Halloween, No soda, No chips  , I think the only kind of &quot;junk&quot; food we had was Ice cream once a week. My Mom Make everything from &quot;scratch&quot; ,Cookies , cakes on occasion and all meals were homemade....you would think that by me growing up in such a non junk food homemade from scratch kind of home that I today would eat that way...NO. When I moved out of my parents house I stocked up on all kinds of junk..drank soda by the 3 liter (a day) ate candy until I felt sick...all that stuff people think they are &quot;teaching&quot; there kids not to do...<br/>
I am not saying that every person who is raised to eat only good or mostly good will turn to the worst like I did but I know that I did so my kids have always had free rein over what that want to eat , one is a vegetarian, one would rather have fruits and veggies over chips and candy and one is still finding out what she really likes. So I  would please try to let go of the food control, leave the room when they drink the soda if it bothers you so much. I am not saying that in a mean way , sometimes it helps to look the other way, &quot;what you don&#39;t see wont hurt you kind of thing&quot; I know you will still feel upset when you see the soda disappearing but at least maybe they wont feel your feelings? All I know is that  When I was younger and I went somewhere were they had different deserts and junky kind of foods I would feel like I almost had to  &quot;sneak&quot; some into my pocketbook so I can have some later and that&#39;s really an awful feeling , like a thief over food! And I battle with being 20-25 pounds over weight and its from the junk, that I know in my heart of hearts but its so hard to get away from. My husband on the other hand had all the <br/>
&quot;junk&quot; he wanted  growing up and he has NO problem taking or leaving it, eats it on  occasion only. So I guess we are both living proof of what has been said about NOT controlling the children&#39;s food .<br/>
Have a great Easter all, cant wait to do the eggs later!!<br/>

  &gt; -no sweet treats before a meal, particularly breakfast.  &quot;healthier <br/>

<br/>
  When my daughter has reached for the candy early in the morning I ask <br/>
  her if she&#39;d like me to make her something. If she doesn&#39;t that would <br/>
  be okay but so far she&#39;s always said yes. For her, since she can have <br/>
  as much as she wants the only thing special about candy is that it&#39;s <br/>
  easier than making a bowl of cereal. But if I offer to make the cereal <br/>
  then that&#39;s more appealing to her for breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
  So, without a rule, with the freedom to eat candy for breakfast she <br/>
  chooses &quot;healthier food first&quot; just because it&#39;s more appealing to her <br/>
  for breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; -often limit amount of dessert/sweet treats eaten (ie -  one bowl of <br/>
  &gt; ice cream)- sometimes because I&#39;m triggered, sometimes because I&#39;d <br/>
  &gt; like to make the box of ice cream last longer, since the budget is not <br/>
  &gt; allowing lots of leeway<br/>
<br/>
  What you&#39;re saying with this is that your wants are more important than <br/>
  their wants. And since you&#39;re bigger and stronger you get to have your <br/>
  way.<br/>
<br/>
  What if you really really wanted a bowl of ice cream and nothing felt <br/>
  like it would satisfy that craving and your husband said, no you can&#39;t, <br/>
  we need to make it last?<br/>
<br/>
  If there&#39;s a special event that&#39;s it being saved for they&#39;ll understand <br/>
  -- if it isn&#39;t commonly limited. But what better use for ice cream <br/>
  could there be than to have happy kids :-)<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; -If one food is requested over and over in one day - will often <br/>
  &gt; suggest another food, and point out that they&#39;ve already had 4 bowls <br/>
  &gt; of oatmeal - perhaps their body might like something else?  This is <br/>
  &gt; likely along the lines of open chioces - after I&#39;ve said that, if they <br/>
  &gt; still want oatmeal - I am happy to make it.  If it were to be ice <br/>
  &gt; cream - that would be a different story.<br/>
<br/>
  When my husband had a week long business trip I had spaghetti every <br/>
  night for dinner. Why should someone have to be an adult to have the <br/>
  freedom to do that?<br/>
<br/>
  What if you had to live your life asking your husband&#39;s permission and <br/>
  help for everything you wanted? Maybe try that for a week! Every time <br/>
  you start to do something independently -- even decisions about what to <br/>
  buy at the store, what to make for dinner -- imagine having to ask your <br/>
  husband if it&#39;s okay, or for him to do it for you. Imagine if his <br/>
  priorities were different and he&#39;d often say no because he didn&#39;t like <br/>
  the choices you made.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; -requests for candy are mostly met with a no if we&#39;re out - we provide <br/>
  &gt; them with allowance each week, and they are entitled to purchase <br/>
  &gt; whatever they want with it - candy included.  However, I know they <br/>
  &gt; often ask if what they&#39;re buying &quot;is okay&quot; - I often say yes.  Once I <br/>
  &gt; have truly graduated to the other side, they won&#39;t ask anymore.  That <br/>
  &gt; would be great.<br/>
<br/>
  What&#39;s your favorite food? What if the only way you could get out into <br/>
  the world and out to where your favorite food (or book or movie) was <br/>
  was to go with him? And what if you were out with him and the thing you <br/>
  really wanted was right there within reach and he said no?<br/>
<br/>
  If we as adults had to live our lives as kids, being dependent on <br/>
  someone, asking permission for each thing we wanted, we&#39;d go nuts! <br/>
  (And, hey, it might happen! And it might be our kids that we&#39;re saying <br/>
  &quot;No, your needs and wants aren&#39;t what I want to do for you. You can <br/>
  take what I think you need,&quot; who are taking care of us!) *Life* and <br/>
  society so severely restrict kids&#39; freedom to get what they want for <br/>
  themselves. We can add to that and be additional controllers in their <br/>
  lives. Or we can be their partners and recognize that they don&#39;t have <br/>
  the freedoms that we do and compassionately help them get what they <br/>
  want.<br/>
<br/>
  The less needy they are, the less they&#39;ll need. If they know that 75% <br/>
  of their requests will be turned down, they have to ask for a lot more <br/>
  to get a better chance of getting the things they want.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; -pop is definitely limited to parties/babysitters in our house, and <br/>
  &gt; the times my dh has one.  He likes it, so there is often pop stored in <br/>
  &gt; the cold cellar for those occasions.  Any requests by the kids to have <br/>
  &gt; pop in between is met with a no.  All the time.  Pop is a big trigger <br/>
  &gt; for me.  I can&#39;t seem to get over that coins disintegrate in it, the <br/>
  &gt; total lack of nutrition in it, and the large amount of <br/>
  &gt; calories/artificial sweeteners.  It will probably be the last thing <br/>
  &gt; I&#39;ll let go of.<br/>
<br/>
  And what you&#39;re doing by making pop for special occasions is making it <br/>
  something special to be greatly desired. Is that what you want? I&#39;ve <br/>
  got 2 cases of Coke sitting in the closet for anyone to take. It&#39;s rare <br/>
  when anyone other than me takes one.<br/>
<br/>
  By limiting it you&#39;re creating a desire for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523843951">We&#39;ve had an open kitchen policy for years. Even before I heard of <br/>
unschooling, I&#39;ve always made the kitchen available to my kids. Heck, <br/>
I don&#39;t want to always be fixing food that they&#39;re capable of doing, <br/>
so I&#39;ve let them have a lot of freedom in there, always. Though I have <br/>
in the past made them &quot;at least taste everything on your plate&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
And, my 10 year old is pretty chunky. I&#39;d say 30 lbs overweight. And, <br/>
she sneaks foods sometimes. Sometimes getting this &quot;jumpy guilty <br/>
busted&quot; look on her face, for eating something that was meant to be <br/>
eaten. As if she was sneaking it when she didn&#39;t need to be sneaky. <br/>
Also, hoarding food. She&#39;ll have a stash of things like soda crackers <br/>
in a drawer in her bedroom. Any candy she buys, she eats it right <br/>
away. In fact, we recently went through a spate of her stealing money <br/>
from her sibs, in order to go buy sweets. And then lying about where <br/>
the money came from.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, she is craving sugar, and last night made <br/>
several &quot;helpings&quot; of sugar water. The Tang that I bought her at the <br/>
beginning of the month (a big Costco sized tub) is gone, but she likes <br/>
sweet drinks, and so makes sugar water for herself. I don&#39;t bug her <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
My 12 yob isn&#39;t gaining weight, and he lives with the same open policy <br/>
concerning food. He just stops when he is full. I&#39;ve never known him <br/>
to sneak or steal. He eats a lot of sweets, but I think it&#39;s more <br/>
about his full sensor. <br/>
<br/>
What is the difference? Honestly, I NEVER NEVER NEVER say anything <br/>
about her weight. EVER. And it&#39;s only a rare occasion when I mention <br/>
the seconds or the snacking, and usually in the context of &quot;So and so <br/>
hasn&#39;t eaten yet.&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll need that for a recipe I&#39;m trying out&quot; It <br/>
is never in the context of &quot;haven&#39;t you had enough, already?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
so, in our case, no food rules haven&#39;t helped her (yet?) to establish <br/>
internal controls. I&#39;m watching and waiting.<br/>

Do you have some chubby relatives/ancestors and some skinny ones?   Some <br/>
differences are just nothing but genetics.  My husband was a fat baby  and has <br/>
both very skinny relatives and fat ones, so I didn&#39;t know what to expect  <br/>
genetically with our kids.  Still don&#39;t know how they&#39;ll be as  adults.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-so, in our case, no food rules haven&#39;t helped her (yet?) to establish  <br/>

 <br/>
Maybe she needs more fruit.  Will she drink juice, or eat toast and  jam or <br/>
other sweet things?  Could you find a recipe for candy made with  nuts and <br/>
honey, maybe?   <br/>
 <br/>
But would &quot;internal controls&quot; look like limits to you?  Maybe you&#39;re  looking <br/>
for something other than her natural food needs.  <br/>
 <br/>
Keith (dh) eats lots of salty food, but takes pride in not salting his  food. <br/>
&lt;G&gt;  He&#39;ll eat chips and microwave popcorn, though.    Kirby likes milk a <br/>
LOT.  He drinks a lot, eats cereal with milk, adds milk  to hot cereal.  If I <br/>
were an anti-milk mom, I could think that Kirby drinks  too much milk, that <br/>
freedom hasn&#39;t helped him to self-regulate on milk  consumption.  What that would <br/>
mean is he drinks more milk than I would give  him if I were doling it out.<br/>

And, my boy was 9-10 when Open Kitchen was begun. <br/>

<br/>
Absolutely. Well, chances are I wouldn&#39;t have had actual MONEY. L<br/>
She could have asked me, or she could have had the chocolate in the <br/>
cupboard or fixed a favorite sweet treat around here: peanuts, <br/>
raisins, and chocolate chips in a cup. <br/>

<br/>
My husband&#39;s brother has one daughter who was quite chubby at age 10, <br/>
and less active than my Katie. She&#39;s grown into a fleshy high school <br/>
graduate. I&#39;m overweight, too (but that&#39;s from overeating and under-<br/>
moving, rather than genetics, as my sister is lean and my bro has <br/>
maybe 10 lbs extra) None of us was a heavy kid. Just the one cousin. <br/>

I must say, if I were doling out the food, I would probably give <br/>
smaller portions or limit seconds or snacks. But I simply refuse to <br/>
do that. Even if I weren&#39;t in unschooling mode, controlling a kid&#39;s <br/>
food or nagging about eating habits...well, I think it&#39;s a sure way <br/>
to push a kid into one eating disorder or another.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some of it just might be innate. We&#39;ve had a dog for 12 years and we <br/>
could always just leave food out and he would eat until he was full <br/>
and leave the rest. Then we got another dog, and she would eat until <br/>
she was stuffed and then some. She&#39;d eat herself sick. She&#39;d eat <br/>
green apples that had fallen to the ground until she threw up. She <br/>
just didn&#39;t seem to have the built-in food shut-offs that other dogs <br/>
I&#39;ve known have had. She died at 9 from a stroke, she was very <br/>
overweight. Our other dog is still lean and going strong at 12. <br/>
<br/>
I know humans aren&#39;t dogs, but I do think that in a similar fashion, <br/>
some people&#39;s built-in food &quot;shut off&quot; switch might not operate as <br/>
well as other people&#39;s.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In general, do you talk about what healthy eating looks and feels <br/>
like? Do you model healthy eating yourself? You don&#39;t have to make <br/>
direct comments about *her* eating to give her information about how <br/>
to make healthy food choices. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter recently got a bag of <br/>
pretzels, which is one of her favorite foods, and she just kept <br/>
eating them. After awhile, she said her stomach hurt. She had eaten <br/>
a *lot* of pretzels. So I just non-judgementally said &quot;Yes, <br/>
sometimes when we eat too much, we get a feeling in our body that <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel right. Like your tummy might feel too full, or you <br/>
might feel sort of sick. Maybe you had too many pretzels?&quot;  The next <br/>
time she got pretzels, I noticed she put them away after awhile. <br/>
Maybe your daughter is just missing her fullness cues. One thing <br/>
that helps some people is just to keep bottles full of nice cold <br/>
water around. When you drink some water before eating or with food, <br/>
you get to the full point a bit quicker. Each of my kids has a <br/>
special water cup with a straw, and I make sure they always have <br/>
fresh water all day available to them (of course, they can also get <br/>
juice or milk or whatever out of the fridge to, but I&#39;ve noticed <br/>
that they tend to drink more water when it is readily available.)<br/>

I think  what I&#39;d like to see is an ability in her to know when her <br/>
tummy is full,  and stop eating<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I have recently been studying portion sizes, in an attempt to regulate my  <br/>
food intake.<br/>
 <br/>
We Americans don&#39;t know much about proper portion sizes, apparently.   What <br/>
does 1/2 a cup look like?  Or 1 oz of cheese, or 3 oz of meat.   Restaurants <br/>
serve too much food, and the plates we use are too big!  I  actually bought a <br/>
food scale, and use it, and now I have a pretty good idea of  how much is what.  <br/>
 <br/>
When I started reducing my portions (at restaurants I eat half and take the  <br/>
rest home for later), I thought it would be hard to stop eating because I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t feel full.  I did feel full!  Part of it was the healthy food  I am <br/>
eating.  You can eat more volume of better foods if you choose  right.  <br/>
 <br/>
I had a boss who was known to run up a local mountain and back every  day, <br/>
for exercise.  He was really fit--over 40 at the time, ran marathons  and used a <br/>
stand-up desk at work.  We were at a work-related convention  together, and <br/>
there was a hotel-type buffet dinner there for the  attendees.  Jim walked away <br/>
from the buffet table with a very small slice  of meat, and his plate <br/>
completely heaped over with green beans.  Green  beans were the only green vegetable <br/>
on the buffet, besides cold salad.  I  remember seeing his plate and making <br/>
the connection about volume of high calorie  food vs volume of low calorie food. <br/>
 I&#39;m sure his reasoning was he could  eat so much MORE food, if he ate the <br/>
right things.  A feeling of fullness  was surely one of his goals, cuz it was a <br/>
huge pile of green beans.  <br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s a book about it, I saw recently.  Volumetrics.  I haven&#39;t  read it, <br/>
yet, but the green bean mountain had to be part of it.  <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe you&#39;re daughter needs some information about portions to help her  <br/>
figure out what makes her feel full, etc.  It takes a while to get that  signal <br/>
from the brain.  I don&#39;t usually cook what I eat for others, except  maybe at <br/>
supper.  So I only cook one serving of whatever it is, or make a  bunch and <br/>
freeze it in individual servings.  I can&#39;t over-eat, because  there isn&#39;t anymore! <br/>
  I&#39;m 11 pounds down so far.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Here are a couple of fun quizzes about portions.<br/>

I know  humans aren&#39;t dogs, but I do think that in a similar fashion, <br/>
some  people&#39;s built-in food &quot;shut off&quot; switch might not operate as <br/>
well as  other people&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
But it can be &quot;fixed&quot;.  It can be adapted.  Other choices can be  made.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think a dog who eats a lot can be fixed, too.  I&#39;ve been watching  the Dog <br/>
Whisperer on National Geographic channel lately.  I&#39;m sure he could  fix a dog <br/>
like that!  I think a dog eating like that is just another form  of neuroses, <br/>
and I&#39;ve seen him adjust neuroses that were ingrained in dogs for  *years*.  <br/>

body just feels so much better when I eat healthily, that I no <br/>
longer have much urge to put too much stuff in it that is unhealthy. <br/>
If I go to a buffet restaurant, I&#39;ll load up on salad and fruit and <br/>
some lean meat because that&#39;s what feels good to me. And I&#39;ll <br/>
usually have something sweet as well because I like it. Being full <br/>
or not full isn&#39;t something I ever really think about. I was just <br/>
realizing the other day that I no longer look to my stomach for cues <br/>
about eating. When I feel hungry, it&#39;s like a whole-body feeling, <br/>
like all of my cells are calling out for food. Since I eat a lot of <br/>
small meals throughout the day, my stomach rarely has either <br/>
a &quot;full&quot; or an &quot;empty&quot; feeling, and it&#39;s never my goal for it to <br/>
feel &quot;full&quot;. I wonder if people depend on their stomach for cues <br/>
about full or empty, if they are missing the picture of what their <br/>
body needs. Just some musings about this...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216268335">There was something I read not too long ago, that was about the trend <br/>
in young girls, (around 7 or 8) to already think they were fat or <br/>
needed to be on a diet. Skinny and fake looking big boobs are promoted <br/>
in ALOT of places. On tv, barbies, some video games, movies, <br/>
commercials, bill boards. (I&quot;m not saying they should be banned or <br/>
anything, but I think we need to be aware of those things having some <br/>
influence on kids) And I think our kids also pick up on our attitudes <br/>
about food, like they do on just about everything else. <br/>
I  know I usually knew how my mom felt about things whether she said a <br/>
word or not. ANd some of her friends may have told her she isn&#39;t <br/>
skinny enough, or she shouldn&#39;t eat certain things, it&#39;s not like we <br/>
are ever the ONLY influence on our kids.<br/>
Lots of people really believe that certain foods are always really bad <br/>
for you, even in moderation. ANd they pass that on to their kids, and <br/>
they, in turn, pass that on as well.<br/>
 We all know those people, I&#39;ve been one before. Split a piece of <br/>
cheesecake with a couple of other friends at the end of a meal in a <br/>
resturant and we&#39;d talk about how we shouldn&#39;t be eating it. One <br/>
piece, split 3 or 4 ways and we were &quot;being bad&quot; -what a crock.<br/>

<br/>
I agree!!!  Last summer my washing machine broke, and I spent a lot of time at my friend&#39;s house doing laundry.  We would literally split a WHOLE Sara Lee cheesecake between the two of us on a regular basis.  It was great!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so scary to hear how young girls think about themselves ... but I must admit I am guilty of thinking badly of myself and my body.  I don&#39;t feel guilty about eating certain foods (my motto: you only live once, you might as well eat what you want) but I&#39;ve always had a skewed perception of the way I look.  I am not overweight, but since having my dd, I am about fifteen pounds heavier.  This has taken me a long time to come to terms with, if I even have.<br/>
<br/>
I worry that my dd (almost three years old) will grow up and fall into the traps that are set for girls (perfect figures, perfect skin, size 0 or bust).  When I was growing up there wasn&#39;t even a size 0 ... I can&#39;t believe that it acutally exists now!!  I don&#39;t control the food she eats by preventing her from eating what I buy (hope that makes sense) I just don&#39;t buy a lot of things that aren&#39;t nutritious.  We model good food habits, and she has followed on her own.  She loves fruits and veggies, whole grain foods ... she&#39;s a great eater, and we encourage her by offering healthy food choices.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, she does eat ice cream, chocolate, cookies, etc. but in moderation, just as we do (well, aside from my summer of cheesecake!!).  I don&#39;t really see how eating unlimited amounts of sugar can be helpful to anyone, young or old.<br/>

<br/>
As a costume designer and seamstress I can tell you that people on average<br/>
are bigger and taller now compared to earlier in history. Vintage garments<br/>
from as soon as the 1930&#39;s and certainly going back to Edwardian times show<br/>
very small garments, even allowing for corsetry. Another area where size is<br/>
distinctive is in suits of armor that are often astonishingly small.<br/>
<br/>
I had a number of vintage paper patterns and some that were my mother&#39;s when<br/>
she was young. The measurements show that the &quot;average&quot; sizes of 10 or 12<br/>
were considerably smaller. Paper patterns will have smaller measurements for<br/>
the same sizes than purchased readymade garments, but they were still<br/>
smaller back in the day. There seem to be two different systems at work at<br/>
the same time. <br/>
<br/>
The fashion industry periodically changes the measurements of what<br/>
constitutes the specific sizes, allowing modern women to feel better about<br/>
being say size 10, when half a century ago they would have been called a<br/>
size 14 or more. However there are still small women to be catered to, hence<br/>
size 0. Sarah Jessica Parker is known as a size 1, and she is also petite in<br/>
height.<br/>
<br/>
There are also different ways of labeling sizes internationally. You are<br/>
probably familiar with European shoe sizes. I thought my feet had grown<br/>
suddenly before I learnt that Australian shoes are numbered differently from<br/>
US despite being similar numbers (ie unlike European).<br/>

are high-water on her, and the womens&#39; pants and skirts are a better fit.<br/>

pieces that were made a lttle smaller then true armour. No sense in wasting<br/>
to much metal for something not intended to be worn?<br/>

kids.  For young princes and dukes and such, to wear on state occasions or <br/>
special occasions, or as a gift.  Armorers then and now would practice (or show <br/>
off) on smaller stuff and give it to young kids.  Not only do they REALLY <br/>
appreciate it, but the parents do too.  And in a feudal society, sucking up is a <br/>
part of everyday life.  <br/>
<br/>
Just a year ago we &#39;returned&#39; a real steel helm with a hinged fact plate that <br/>
had been given to Kirby when he was little.  Though I let him try it on and <br/>
he knew it was his, I kept it back for a couple of reasons.  It was dangerous, <br/>
just the weight of it, for playing.  And the armorer  had made it for his <br/>
daughter.  When it was too small for her, the mom gave it to Kirby.   They were <br/>
divorced by then, and I figured she was dumping things the dad had owned/made.  <br/>
<br/>
So I saved it, and when the daughter was 23 or so and had graduated from <br/>
college and I figured she was in a position to take care of it herself, I gave it <br/>
back to her.  She was thrilled to have it.  But it will never be evidence that <br/>
anyone that small was involved in any combat, not even SCA combat.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some VERY elaborate costumes made for young children (and my kids <br/>
have worn some), partly because the kids are just so darn CUTE, and partly <br/>
because a similar costume in adult size could cost hundreds of dollars in material <br/>
and hundreds of hours of labor, but to do something similar with scrap <br/>
materials and short bits of blackwork embroidery (rather than yards) for a baby or <br/>
toddler is fun and easy.  And the kids don&#39;t wear them out, because they&#39;re <br/>
hardly mobile and they outgrow them in just half a year (MAYBE having worn them <br/>
two or three times).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249827339">&lt;&lt; On behalf of naturally thin girls, I&#39;d just like to say that some of us<br/>
*need* that size 0, and children can be made to feel badly about themselves<br/>
for being &#39;too skinny&#39; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My sister is naturally very thin, and she always felt self-conscious about<br/>
it.  She would hear strangers say, &quot;Now *that&#39;s* thin,&quot; when she walked by.<br/>
It affected her greatly growing up, and still does now that she&#39;s an adult.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that when we were kids/teens (I&#39;m talking &#39;80&#39;s and &#39;90&#39;s) there<br/>
wasn&#39;t a size 0, it was something else ... maybe size 2 or 4.  Having a size<br/>
numbered &quot;0&quot; makes me feel like we are putting more pressure on girls to be<br/>
thin, outside of those girls who are genetically or naturally thin.  It<br/>
feels to me like we&#39;re telling them if your dress size has an actual number,<br/>
you&#39;re too fat.<br/>
<br/>
We should be promoting to our girls that it&#39;s not the dress size that<br/>
matters, but how wonderful you look in your clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts ...<br/>

<br/>
pieces that were made a lttle smaller then true armour. No sense in wasting<br/>
<br/>
to much metal for something not intended to be worn? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some of the suits have the name of who it was made for, and the detail that <br/>
it was for his knighting (we&#39;ve been at 18 or 21, most likely, depending what <br/>
country, if his father was of rank), and not many men will stay their 18-yr-old <br/>
size for life.  Or sometimes a prince, 15 years old, made for the coronation <br/>
of his father (and so on like that).  Worn once, like a wedding dress or <br/>
Christening gown, and saved by proud relatives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786409248">I bow happily to other&#39;s greater knowledge about armor. :)<br/>
<br/>
However I stand by my statements about the relative sizes of both paper<br/>
patterns and the numbering systems of the &quot;average&quot; sizes of ready-to-wear.<br/>
The definition of the average size used to be smaller. Maybe it is a step<br/>
forward that what is considered average is larger today.<br/>
<br/>
When I talk about vintage, I&#39;m talking about paper patterns and preserved<br/>
garments from pre- WWII, and from the 1960&#39;s (in ref. to my Mum). If Holly<br/>
is finding those items in the thrift stores in Albuquerque, they may be<br/>
worth a lot more than she is paying for them if in good condition,<br/>
especially if designer. There are a lot of designer resale stores here in<br/>
Los Angeles where the prices are hardly less than new.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that is interesting is to look at vintage photos of women in<br/>
shoes. It is completely evident that often the women are cramming their poor<br/>
plump feet into small shoes.<br/>
<br/>
Studying the history of fashion can be fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;We should be promoting to our girls that it&#39;s not the dress size that<br/>

<br/>
I wonder if this is as much of an issue with Unschoolers as it might be with<br/>
schooled children who deal with group mentality and much more pronounced<br/>
peer pressure daily. I would be interested in hearing about older kids.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn at 5.5 has her own sense of style. She has always been very clear about<br/>
her preferences. As an infant in the clothing stores I would hold up a<br/>
couple of garments and buy the one she reached for or seemed responsive to.<br/>
Now she finds pictures in books and asks me to make the dresses, with<br/>
variations. She chooses fabrics at the store. She is very particular about<br/>
her shoes. She examines clothes in the store carefully before deciding yes<br/>
or no, or she instantly loves something. Recently she has begun insisting on<br/>
trying on at the store before buying.<br/>
<br/>
As for her body image, she is proud of being strong and tall. She is pleased<br/>
when she can do physical stuff. She also loves playing with makeup and has a<br/>
larger selection of lipsticks than I do. However she usually forgets to wear<br/>
any.<br/>
<br/>
She has not allowed me to brush her hair since last June. It is curly so is<br/>
now a combination of wads, fuzz balls and dreadlocks - a la Phyllis Diller.<br/>
She loves it.<br/>

Just skirts and pants size 1 at Savers sometimes, and she wore a &quot;Size 0&quot; <br/>
pair (seems so goofy) for a bit.  She&#39; on to 3 and 5, and climbing.  <br/>
<br/>
She had a WONDERFUL pair of kneehigh boots she wore once for a dress-up <br/>
situation, we paid $7 maybe.  They were made in Brazil, but the inside writing was <br/>
all Japanese, and they were unlike Brazilian stuff sold here.  They didn&#39;t fit <br/>
her long, but she had LITTLE feet (it was a couple of years back) but those <br/>
were clearly women&#39;s boots.<br/>
<br/>
-=-One thing that is interesting is to look at vintage photos of women in<br/>

<br/>
I had one grandmother who crammed and one who didn&#39;t.  <br/>
The one who wore size 7 probably should&#39;ve worn 9, judging by my being a lot <br/>
like her physically, and remembering what her poor toes looked like.  Chinese <br/>
footbinding, just about, toes curled under on the sides, and big toe bent in.  <br/>
And she had corns and callouses and coudln&#39;t walk very far or very fast.  <br/>
Really bad idea, and now so long ago.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My teen years were in the 70&#39;s and I remember a size 1. Don&#39;t remember a<br/>
zero but I know there was a time, (short) that I did wear size 1. They were<br/>
certainly hard to find but they were there. Maybe 0&#39;s were there too just<br/>
not so abundant.<br/>
<br/>
I do know that size varies so much from one brand to another. I could care<br/>
less but I see that it matters to many people. My mom has a friend who<br/>
refuses to wear the size she really needs only because it&#39;s &quot;not her size.&quot;<br/>
She doesn&#39;t understand how size varies. My oldest daughter, 19, finally<br/>
realizes that now. She sees her size not changing but wears 3&#39;s and 5&#39;s<br/>
depending. I can go anywhere from a size 8 to a 12. I think size is crap<br/>
really. I understand one has to have something to go by but so many girls<br/>
and women really depend on a certain number meaning something. I would like<br/>
to think wisdom of that comes with age but I know many women who still<br/>
squeeze feet into too small shoes because they don&#39;t want to wear anything<br/>
larger than a 7.<br/>

seeing this wad of hair growing out and her enjoyment in playing with it.  I respond to <br/>
Robyn&#39;s email about her daughter&#39;s hair because it reminds me of my daughter&#39;s <br/>

comb or &quot;make tidy&quot; becauuse she is going to school, but something that <br/>
BELONGS TO HER and she can braid, it, let it get knottyt or whatever!  It is trully <br/>
