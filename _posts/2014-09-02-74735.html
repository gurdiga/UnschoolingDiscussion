<br/>
<br/>
I have been playing the guitar since before I could drive. The technique for tuning the strings is simple enough. Pluck the E string with a finger on the fifth fret and match the pitch to the neighboring string. Proceed across the fretboard with only a minor deviation at the third string. Not rocket science, except that we are talking about the ability to discern flats and sharps. There have been a few awkward moments when I was performing for a crowd and did not tune up correctly ahead of time, and had to stop to turn the white pegs while people looked at their shoes and coughed. Not a tragedy when you are sitting in the dark cooking marshmallows but in church it takes the reverence down a notch. <br/>
<br/>
There were times I would like to forget when the guitar was out of tune but I had already plunged into the song and decided that correction was a lost cause. I sang louder and mentally apologized to the folks with sensitive ears. Other times it was not actually my fault, like when a curious child standing next to mom singing decided to find out what happens when they swivel those knobs that just happen to be eye level with a four year old. <br/>
<br/>
At some point someone cooler than me taught me about harmonics and I started tuning that way but actually I prefer the fifth fret system. <br/>
<br/>
Then a few Christmases ago John bought me a magical device that clamps onto the head of the instrument and digitizes the whole process. I push a button, and pluck a string. The gizmo tells me not only if it is on pitch but whether it is high or low. I keep playing until I get the green light. Instant and accurate feedback. A deaf person could tune it. Probably Beethoven had one. <br/>
<br/>
The other day a friend vented to me about her other half. I listened, as is my custom, without advice. Then she flat out asked me. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Am I being reasonable?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
My mind reeled. She was inviting me to respond. I chose my words carefully. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can see how you are frustrated with him for not being a better listener. Does he go to work faithfully every day?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Good father?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Very.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Helps around the house?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All the time, really.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I paused to let her hear her own answers. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Maybe you could find a friend to listen to you, and not expect him to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She twisted her mouth and nodded slightly, like when the wheels are turning inside your head. <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if a brilliant inventor could patent a relationship tuner. We could speak into it and get immediate information about whether our words were flat or sharp. Sometimes my children chime in with their opinions.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mom, get over it. You are making a big deal over nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do you intend to sound so frosty?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
At least it gives me a chance to start over. And it is easier to take correction from a gizmo. <br/>
