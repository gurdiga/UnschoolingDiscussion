Hmmmmm .... sort how I feel after trying to implement unschooling!!  I thought I had settled the whole unschooling thing, and dh was a &quot;go&quot; for it, but today the questions started again.   &quot;Sooooo..... when are you going to start up with the kids?

I mean, I understand doing things that the kids want to do, but shouldn&#39;t you be making the connections between things for them?  Isn&#39;t that part of why you are homeschooling in the first place, to get rid of jumping all around without ever learning to see the big picture and how everything fits together?&quot;  And in my heart, I felt he was right.  But when I start to do those things, the kids listen politely for a bit, and then they just kind of tune out after a while.  Are they still de-school-at-home-ing, or am I still missing something here?  I&#39;ve been reading some Paulo Freire, an educator in Brazil who decries schools as they operate by what he calls the &quot;banking theory&quot; -- kid opens head and teacher pours in knowledge.  He prefers to let the students talk about what they know, and then gives them the proper terminology or whatever else they are lacking for a full understanding.  But they don&#39;t really ever ask me any questions about what they are doing -- they just sort of do it.  They&#39;ll invite me to join in, but gently discourage my attempts to help them name things.  Will they ever ask?  Or do I persist?  What has your experience been?   Debi  <br/>

<br/>
Five to six was Rain&#39;s most melt-downy year, and she drew, wrote, and<br/>
yelled all sorts of violent things. For a while we babysat a friend&#39;s 9<br/>
month old, and she once was frustrated with the baby because she wanted<br/>
my attention and drew a picture of her being tied to a stake over a fire<br/>
while being shot with arrows. I seriously considered therapy for her...<br/>
one thing thathelped was knowing two other intense little girls about her<br/>
age doing similar things, one of whom was the daughter of the woman I<br/>
still think is the best mother I&#39;ve ever met. It was hard, though, to be<br/>
steady in the midst of those strong feelings. She had a fight with a<br/>
friend one day and after the friend went home she told me all about how<br/>
she hoped the friend got hit by a car on the way home and died. <br/>
<br/>
I tried to listen and respond to the feelings, more than the words. This<br/>
all seemed to be better than her kicking and biting me (and she never<br/>
phjysically assaulted anyone else, just me).<br/>
<br/>
And now at 9 she seems to thrive on pressure, she rarely melts down at<br/>
all and when she does it&#39;s generally related to fatigue and not hunger,<br/>
like it was when she was 5 (and it took me way too long to figure ouit<br/>
that just setting food near her worked much better than verbally offering<br/>
it).<br/>
<br/>
She also told me a month or so ago, when I was hammering something, that<br/>
I could use a comb to hold the nail steady to start hammering - just<br/>
stick it in between the teeth. <br/>

<br/>
If you start lecturing kids about all kinds of things everytime they <br/>
show an interest in something, they will be afraid to show an <br/>
interest in much of anything.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody can know everything about everything! Your kids need to see <br/>
the big picture from their perspective, with their specific interests <br/>
and abilities taken into account.  At some point they might need to <br/>
know why maps were made or how countries were named in order to <br/>
complete the big picture in their mind.  At that point, they will <br/>
take all their previously accumulated knowledge and add that <br/>
knowledge to their picture.  <br/>
<br/>
It takes a lifetime to fill in all the pieces of the big picture.  If <br/>
you try to force the artist (child) to paint the picture before they <br/>
are ready or able to paint it, the masterpiece won&#39;t be quite so <br/>
lovely. <br/>

This &quot;lecture&quot; question is crossing in my mind with the Kama Sutra<br/>
thread. <br/>

I think next time your dh wants to have sex you should give him a<br/>
lecture about the details of human physiology instead.  See if he thinks<br/>
that improves the experience.  &lt;eg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137643107">Debi - I&#39;ve been unschooling for about a year now. I have 2 boys (9 & 11)<br/>
who I homeschooled for 5 years previously. Sometimes I wonder if we&#39;re still<br/>
in the deschooling mode, too. I found myself nodding in agreement to so many<br/>
things in your post. All except for the part of my dh getting on my back<br/>
about &quot;teaching&quot; them. Thankfully, he doesn&#39;t do that to me and lets<br/>
unschooling happen naturally. I&#39;m so lucky he &quot;gets&quot; unschooling. Instead, I<br/>
hear conversations stressing the importance of making the kids &quot;do&quot; work<br/>
over and over from the homeschool support group that we meet with weekly.<br/>
Most if not all of the moms are into academics - in varying degrees. Some<br/>
are strict pre-packaged curriculum users and others construct their own<br/>
curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
While they do accept me as an unschooler, they ask me questions that I know<br/>
must concern them about how I&#39;m educating my boys. Today they asked me &quot;so<br/>
what do you guys DO all day if you don&#39;t do schoolwork?&quot;. I was honest and<br/>
couldn&#39;t think of a better answer and told them that the kids spend a lot of<br/>
time on the computer and how I don&#39;t mind that at all because I see them<br/>
being challenged by these computer games all the time. They asked me &quot;and<br/>
they can watch TV whenever they want?&quot; and I said yes they can, but they&#39;ve<br/>
really self-regulated themselves and don&#39;t spend more than a couple hours a<br/>
day watching TV - most days less. Well, I could tell I just wasn&#39;t<br/>
convincing them that this was the best way to go. I could almost hear their<br/>
self-righteous mutterings to themselves like &quot;those poor boys won&#39;t amount<br/>
to anything because Karin isn&#39;t giving them a proper education!&quot; Okay, they<br/>
didn&#39;t say that but I could just tell they were thinking it. ;-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My kids do this too. In fact, whenever I start to doubt unschooling and<br/>
think I should be &quot;making&quot; them do something, I remember back to our 5 years<br/>
of attempting to do school-at-home, which were plainly miserable. Both of my<br/>
boys balk at my mere suggestion of doing ANYTHING resembling learning. They<br/>
have gotten way past the &quot;listening politely&quot; stage and tune out<br/>
immediately. I then remember how FAKE it feels to be *teaching* kids this<br/>
way. I mean, they don&#39;t want me tell them about how maps were invented or<br/>
why countries have borders unless they ask me why. And if I&#39;d tell them<br/>
without them asking, they would look at me like &quot;I don&#39;t care about that!&quot;<br/>
and I know it&#39;d just go in one ear and out the other. So, I still don&#39;t know<br/>
if they&#39;re deschooling (from school-at-home) or if it will just be like this<br/>
from now on!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve been reading some Paulo Freire, an educator in Brazil who decries<br/>

What &gt;has your experience been?   &gt;Debi  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard so much talk about early learning windows that will forever be<br/>
missed if kids aren&#39;t properly &quot;taught&quot; during those times and also stuff<br/>
like how it&#39;s so important to give kids challenges (like forced<br/>
memorization) to help develop and fire neurons in the brain, to increase<br/>
knowledge capacity and such. I know several moms who make their kids<br/>
memorize poems every week or even every day! One of my good friends is<br/>
teaching her 8 yo Latin! All I know that if I made my boys do such things, I<br/>
would never hear the end of their complaints. My boys like me to join in<br/>
with their activities, too, only to a certain point. If I stop being &quot;mom&quot;<br/>
and start being &quot;teacher&quot;, I&#39;m outta there. I&#39;ve been feeling frustrated<br/>
too, at times, but I&#39;m being to think this is how unschooling looks in our<br/>
family.<br/>

<br/>
Life is a journey. Our unschooling life is just the path we&#39;ve taken, it&#39;s <br/>
not the destination. Our kids will continue on this path their whole lives. <br/>
There&#39;s no reason for them to know everything in the whole wide world right <br/>

questions and question the answers...that&#39;s the path we&#39;re on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-532284473">I also go through all of these things.  And it seems like when ever I do my dh can sense it and that&#39;s when he questions it.  <br/>
One big thing that he and his family wonder about that I&#39;ll put to all you knowledgable unschoolers is:  If I let my children self direct their learning won&#39;t they miss out on different experiences.  For example, my dh said, they wouldn&#39;t have  learned cello and violin if you wouldn&#39;t have suggested it.  Or another example would be, if we were traveling somewhere and the kids didn&#39;t want to see a cathedral and would rather go play in an arcade they would miss out on a historical cathedral.  These are the questions I get alot of.  <br/>
I think that me being who I am and the way my kids are we will find wonder where ever we go.   I&#39;m not worried at all,  but what can I tell the questioners?   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-735791468">What bothers me about that line of questioning is if they learned cello and violin won&#39;t they miss out on playing the flute or trumpet. If they play in the orchestra, won&#39;t they be missing out on acting in the musical.  If they see the cathedral they might miss the art museum. If they go to Europe they might miss S. America. Life is full of choices and we can&#39;t do them all. It&#39;s a small percentage of kids that are in the school orchestra, or on the foot ball team or whatever experience they&#39;re supposed to be missing.  My kids are experiencing things that most kids in school or even kids who are &#39;schooled-at-home&#39; don&#39;t have time for.  Such is life.<br/>

  I also go through all of these things.  And it seems like when ever I do my dh can sense it and that&#39;s when he questions it.  <br/>
  One big thing that he and his family wonder about that I&#39;ll put to all you knowledgable unschoolers is:  If I let my children self direct their learning won&#39;t they miss out on different experiences.  For example, my dh said, they wouldn&#39;t have  learned cello and violin if you wouldn&#39;t have suggested it.  Or another example would be, if we were traveling somewhere and the kids didn&#39;t want to see a cathedral and would rather go play in an arcade they would miss out on a historical cathedral.  These are the questions I get alot of.  <br/>
  I think that me being who I am and the way my kids are we will find wonder where ever we go.   I&#39;m not worried at all,  but what can I tell the questioners?   <br/>

  who I homeschooled for 5 years previously. Sometimes I wonder if we&#39;re still<br/>
  in the deschooling mode, too. I found myself nodding in agreement to so many<br/>
  things in your post. All except for the part of my dh getting on my back<br/>
  about &quot;teaching&quot; them. Thankfully, he doesn&#39;t do that to me and lets<br/>
  unschooling happen naturally. I&#39;m so lucky he &quot;gets&quot; unschooling. Instead, I<br/>
  hear conversations stressing the importance of making the kids &quot;do&quot; work<br/>
  over and over from the homeschool support group that we meet with weekly.<br/>
  Most if not all of the moms are into academics - in varying degrees. Some<br/>
  are strict pre-packaged curriculum users and others construct their own<br/>
  curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
  While they do accept me as an unschooler, they ask me questions that I know<br/>
  must concern them about how I&#39;m educating my boys. Today they asked me &quot;so<br/>
  what do you guys DO all day if you don&#39;t do schoolwork?&quot;. I was honest and<br/>
  couldn&#39;t think of a better answer and told them that the kids spend a lot of<br/>
  time on the computer and how I don&#39;t mind that at all because I see them<br/>
  being challenged by these computer games all the time. They asked me &quot;and<br/>
  they can watch TV whenever they want?&quot; and I said yes they can, but they&#39;ve<br/>
  really self-regulated themselves and don&#39;t spend more than a couple hours a<br/>
  day watching TV - most days less. Well, I could tell I just wasn&#39;t<br/>
  convincing them that this was the best way to go. I could almost hear their<br/>
  self-righteous mutterings to themselves like &quot;those poor boys won&#39;t amount<br/>
  to anything because Karin isn&#39;t giving them a proper education!&quot; Okay, they<br/>
  didn&#39;t say that but I could just tell they were thinking it. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;Hmmmmm .... sort how I feel after trying to implement unschooling!!  I<br/>
  thought I had settled the whole unschooling thing, and &gt;dh was a &quot;go&quot; for<br/>
  it, but today the questions started again.   &quot;Sooooo..... when are you going<br/>
  to start up with the kids?  I &gt;mean, you had a really good summer, but<br/>
  shouldn&#39;t you guys get back to the books?&quot;  I point to where the kids are<br/>
  sprawled &gt;on the floor, coloring huge maps of the world and putting stickers<br/>
  on them with  pictures of famous landmarks ( the kids &gt;found the maps as<br/>
  part of a kit in a Winners store).  &quot;Yes, but shouldn&#39;t you be talking to<br/>
  them about maps and how they &gt;were invented, or about the politics of why<br/>
  countries have borders, or how countries are named?<br/>
  &gt;I mean, I understand doing things that the kids want to do, but shouldn&#39;t<br/>
  you be making the connections between things for &gt;them?  Isn&#39;t that part of<br/>
  why you are homeschooling in the first place, to get rid of jumping all<br/>
  around without ever learning to &gt;see the big picture and how everything fits<br/>
  together?&quot;  And in my heart, I felt he was right.  But when I start to do<br/>
  those &gt;things, the kids listen politely for a bit, and then they just kind<br/>
  of tune out after a while.  Are they still de-school-at-home-ing, &gt;or am I<br/>
  still missing something here? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  My kids do this too. In fact, whenever I start to doubt unschooling and<br/>
  think I should be &quot;making&quot; them do something, I remember back to our 5 years<br/>
  of attempting to do school-at-home, which were plainly miserable. Both of my<br/>
  boys balk at my mere suggestion of doing ANYTHING resembling learning. They<br/>
  have gotten way past the &quot;listening politely&quot; stage and tune out<br/>
  immediately. I then remember how FAKE it feels to be *teaching* kids this<br/>
  way. I mean, they don&#39;t want me tell them about how maps were invented or<br/>
  why countries have borders unless they ask me why. And if I&#39;d tell them<br/>
  without them asking, they would look at me like &quot;I don&#39;t care about that!&quot;<br/>
  and I know it&#39;d just go in one ear and out the other. So, I still don&#39;t know<br/>
  if they&#39;re deschooling (from school-at-home) or if it will just be like this<br/>
  from now on!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; I&#39;ve been reading some Paulo Freire, an educator in Brazil who decries<br/>
  schools as they &gt;operate by what he calls the &gt;&quot;banking theory&quot; -- kid opens<br/>
  head and teacher pours in knowledge.  He prefers to let the &gt;students talk<br/>
  about what they &gt;know, and then gives them the proper terminology or<br/>
  whatever else they are lacking for a full &gt;understanding.  But they don&#39;t<br/>
  &gt;really ever ask me any questions about what they are doing -- they just<br/>
  sort of do it.  They&#39;ll &gt;invite me to join in, but gently &gt;discourage my<br/>
  attempts to help them name things.  Will they ever ask?  Or do I persist?<br/>
  What &gt;has your experience been?   &gt;Debi  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve heard so much talk about early learning windows that will forever be<br/>
  missed if kids aren&#39;t properly &quot;taught&quot; during those times and also stuff<br/>
  like how it&#39;s so important to give kids challenges (like forced<br/>
  memorization) to help develop and fire neurons in the brain, to increase<br/>
  knowledge capacity and such. I know several moms who make their kids<br/>
  memorize poems every week or even every day! One of my good friends is<br/>
  teaching her 8 yo Latin! All I know that if I made my boys do such things, I<br/>
  would never hear the end of their complaints. My boys like me to join in<br/>
  with their activities, too, only to a certain point. If I stop being &quot;mom&quot;<br/>
  and start being &quot;teacher&quot;, I&#39;m outta there. I&#39;ve been feeling frustrated<br/>
  too, at times, but I&#39;m being to think this is how unschooling looks in our<br/>
  family.<br/>

My response to every kind of question like this from adults about my kids <br/>
learning is WHY?? Then I listen and see what kind of answers I get. I never <br/>
get any to encourage me to do anything other than unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the rest, sounds like the children are doing just fine. I <br/>
personally would not persist. They might very well start asking you things <br/>
and you can go from there and they might very well just find out on their <br/>
own, which would be fine too, wouldn&#39;t it??<br/>

This is what our kids do as well. They &quot;just do it&quot; &lt;g&gt; as the slogan goes. <br/>
If they ask anything, it&#39;s generally about &quot;where is the tape, where is the <br/>
stapler, Glue, A pen?&quot; Then I find them actually *wanting* to use the <br/>
calculator during the grocery shopping, or playing with the calculator on <br/>
the way to/from the store. Or they&#39;ll say something like, &quot;I though 2 times <br/>
12 was 24, and the calculator agrees&quot;.&lt;smile&gt; You know, stuff like that. I <br/>
used to worry more about their &quot;education&quot;, then I learned (kind of slowly) <br/>
to just relax and take deep breaths. After all, it is *their* educations, <br/>
and if they&#39;re able to function now, there&#39;s no reason to believe they <br/>
won&#39;t learn how to function later -- if they feel a *need* to learn <br/>
whatever. That&#39;s how I think about it anyway :) Your mileage may vary <br/>
(YMMV). &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Latin is making quite a comeback.  My best friend took it in high<br/>
school, but at the time it was very unpopular and out of favor.<br/>
<br/>
My personal theory is that the reason Latin is now popular is that we<br/>
have a whole generation that mostly didn&#39;t study it.  Therefore Latin<br/>
was not ruined for them and they are willing to try it for their kids. <br/>
IF Latin hadn&#39;t died out in the schools, most everyone would still hate<br/>
it.  That&#39;s my theory and I&#39;m standing by it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-507323195"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;But they don&#39;t really ever ask me any questions about what they are doing<br/>
&gt; &gt;-- they just sort of do it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with the other posters.  I want to add that when my kids are<br/>
doing something and *I* notice something really cool about what they are<br/>
doing, then I usually say something along the lines of, &quot;Hey, neat!  Did<br/>
you notice this really cool thing.&quot;  and then I let it drop.  They are<br/>
young and really like to see cool new things.  DH is my age, and he too<br/>
likes to see really cool things, and so I always point things out about<br/>
what he might be doing, too. (and vice versa)<br/>
