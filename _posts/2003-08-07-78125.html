&gt; by taking<br/>
&gt; one little straw off her cart, and the NEXT thing that happened was <br/>
&gt; THE LAST<br/>
&gt; STRAW!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is soooo true!  I read your responses, said thanks and went to <br/>
absorb them.  then I sat down to watch some TV and let my pain meds do <br/>
their job and relax.  Started watching Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya <br/>
sisterhood.  Just so ya know, don&#39;t EVER watch that if you are feeling <br/>
down about your momming skills.  holy cow!  So I had a good cry and yet <br/>
again resolved to give myself a kick in the pants and quit whining.  <br/>
This crap has always been on my back, it isn&#39;t going anywhere, it&#39;s my <br/>
choice what to do with it, right?  Easier said than done, but attitude <br/>
goes a long way.  There is a mom and tot yoga class on Mondays that I <br/>
think I may peek into to see if me and Harriet *and* Crispin could go <br/>
to with out disrupting the class.  He is 18 months, and kind of behind <br/>
compared to other kids his age.  We&#39;ll see.  I think if we eased into <br/>
some regular stuff like that, it may be easier for me to find away to <br/>
share my whole time (with Charles at work) with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
What do the rest of you do for *me* time?  Do you forgo it completely?  <br/>
Most times people say they do it after the kids are asleep.  I need to <br/>
sleep from 10pm to 8 am to be human and humane.  Harriet and Crispin go <br/>
to sleep with Daddy at about midnight and get up at 6:30 and rarely nap <br/>
anymore.<br/>
We do swap with another couple to get date nights once a month or so.  <br/>
We just started that, so far so good.<br/>

<br/>
I go out with adult friends when my  husband can keep the kids, in seasons <br/>
when I&#39;m feeling crowded.  Now that the youngest is 11, it&#39;s not only easier to <br/>
get out alone (I&#39;ve been to the grocery store twice today by myself!) but I <br/>
don&#39;t feel as crowded with them here.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; need to <br/>

<br/>
Wow.  That&#39;s a problem all by itself.  That&#39;s ten hours.  That could be a <br/>
symptom of depression unless it&#39;s a lifelong pattern.   I go to bed late and get <br/>
up early and have less crowded times on both ends of that.<br/>
