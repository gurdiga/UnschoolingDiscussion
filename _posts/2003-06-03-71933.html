I run an unschooling support group waaaaaay up in Pensacola. That&#39;s really <br/>
far from you, but I am fairly sure there are unschoolers down in your area.<br/>
As to the evals. It&#39;s mostly a formality in the younger years.<br/>
There is another option that you may be interested in, and that is an <br/>
umbrella school. The one I&#39;m with is only $10 per year, per child and requires almost <br/>
nothing from you! It&#39;s great.  You can email me if you&#39;d like more info. <br/>
about that option.<br/>
