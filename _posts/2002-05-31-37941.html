Yes, there&#39;s an unschooled soap star who&#39;ll tell her story. I grew up with <br/>
her. Fiona was not schooled until fourth grade (when/where we met) because <br/>
she lived in Jamaica. She attended school from 4th-7th grade and then she was <br/>
trusted to even live on her own in London and New York at 14. Fascinating <br/>
story. As soon as I &quot;found&quot; unschooling, I realized she was my personal <br/>
poster child for unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll also have Ned Vare and Luz Shosie whose son will graduate from college <br/>
next week. Cassidy, their son, never went to school; he won&#39;t be with us, but <br/>
his parents should be able to answer all those questions you might have.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can join us!<br/>
