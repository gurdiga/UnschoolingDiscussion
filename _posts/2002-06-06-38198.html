<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137923801">Hi Laira,<br/>
<br/>
I have always felt offended when invited without kids to parties. I usually <br/>
choose not to attend. We are a family and we go together. If it is not <br/>
family friendly, then we don&#39;t make it. However, this is your grampa&#39;s <br/>
party. I wonder why no kids are being included? I wonder if someone <br/>
organized a child meal, say potluck, it would be appreciated and the kids <br/>
can attend. It may be the cost per plate per kid that is the reason kids are <br/>
being asked not to attend the meal. Is there enough time to ask why the kids <br/>
are not included? Maybe pointing out how lonely the kids would be missing <br/>
the party. Telling our real feelings can open up some doors which seemed not <br/>
to exist. Are you up for seeking the truth from your family?<br/>
<br/>
