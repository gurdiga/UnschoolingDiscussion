Susan says:<br/>
It&#39;s not unfortunate that we&#39;re human....humans are wonderful -- if not at<br/>
times acting in ways that are not helpful to this list.<br/>
Humans build relationships with integrity and character and respect by<br/>
admitting mistakes and attempting reparation if possible.<br/>
        With that I&#39;ll make my apology for my own &quot;slip of the send key&quot;<br/>
which did nothing to create a positive atmosphere here - quite the opposite,<br/>
I&#39;m afraid.  :-( {remorse}  Now I understand what it&#39;s like to regret<br/>
hitting that key in frustration ...reminds me of my occassional slips in<br/>
yelling at these darling children who gift me with their lives 24-7.<br/>
