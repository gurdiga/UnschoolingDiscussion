<div id="ygrps-yiv-949173119">It is an incorrect assumption to make a blanket statement saying that<br/>
high-maintenance kids do need external structure.  My son is 12 and has<br/>
never been *schooled* a day in his life.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to say that he&#39;s high functioning autism because I don&#39;t see<br/>
him as that...but he would probably have that label if he were in school..<br/>
or even if I were to force schoolwork on him at home.  <br/>
<br/>
But he isn&#39;t and I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s free.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s free to be completely Who He Is.  He&#39;s celebrated for his Spirit.  His<br/>
gifts are our focus, not his limitations.<br/>
<br/>
Because he&#39;s free, he is able to SHINE the way he is meant to shine.  He is<br/>
able to learn real-life math concepts through real life.  <br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t unschool except for math...unschooling is not just what you&#39;re<br/>
DOING...it&#39;s what you&#39;re NOT doing.  With unschooling, you&#39;re NOT damaging<br/>
your child&#39;s definition of learning.  It&#39;s a joyful, natural, wonderful part<br/>
of life.  It&#39;s not something to be forced.  It&#39;s something to be discovered,<br/>
through following your passions.<br/>
 <br/>
*** Where Raymond is able to count how many toothpicks fell on the floor,<br/>
but a candy bar is, &quot;About a hundred dollars.&quot; That&#39;s my son. 8 means the<br/>
same to him as 800. <br/>
<br/>
Now, if he has 800 Lego blocks in front of him, and another pile with 8 Lego<br/>
blocks, he can grasp the concept that it&#39;s bigger than the other and by how<br/>
much.<br/>
<br/>
So I do use Math-U-See with him.***<br/>
<br/>
Why not continue to use REAL life, instead of Math-U-See.  Use<br/>
Math-Is-Everywhere...called LIFE!!  My son has a wonderful grasp of numbers<br/>
because he&#39;s never seen them as something that should be intimidated.  He<br/>
never saw them as something he would be quizzed about.  He finds answers to<br/>
his questions because he has a need and a desire to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps he doesn&#39;t CARE how much a candy bar costs right now.  But he will<br/>
care how much something costs when he&#39;s saving his money for it.  Let real<br/>
life teach what the children want/need to learn.<br/>
<br/>
***Some of us are raising various sorts of high-maintenance kids, and <br/>
they sometimes do need external structure because they aren&#39;t always <br/>
(and some of them never!) able to provide it for themselves.***<br/>
<br/>
Why do they need to provide structure for themselves?  What they need to do<br/>
is to learn how to listen to their own internal structure, their own heart. <br/>
They don&#39;t learn what to do with someone constantly telling them.  They<br/>
learn from KNOWING what to do because they&#39;ve been given the opportunity of<br/>
listening to their own rhythm, their own heart, and following that to live<br/>
their life.  <br/>
<br/>
What a gift.<br/>
<br/>
 ***Some <br/>
kids need to be held and redirected in order to read an entire book <br/>
(or page).***<br/>
<br/>
Why does the child NEED to read an entire book (or page)?  What is the child<br/>
being made to read that he doesn&#39;t WANT to read it?<br/>
<br/>
My son has a corner of our living room filled with his books.  He can be<br/>
found with his nose in them throughout most of the day.  Why does he love to<br/>
read?  Because he gets to read about that which he LOVES.  He&#39;s never been<br/>
told he HAS to read anything.  He&#39;s been told to trust himself, trust what<br/>
his heart is telling him, and go with that. <br/>
<br/>
He is currently reading two novels, a reference book on mythological<br/>
monsters, a book on working with wildlife, a bird atlas, Garfield comic<br/>
books, and a book on ancient Egypt.  <br/>
<br/>
All his choice.  All because he is free to follow his own heart.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 ***Some kids need lists of things to do to keep them from <br/>
obsessing on a single topic from waking to sleep.***<br/>
<br/>
Believe me...I know of what you speak!  But take that obsession and USE it. <br/>
Follow it.  It&#39;s what they LOVE.  <br/>
<br/>
Monsters are my child&#39;s *thing.*  If I tried to distract him AWAY from that,<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine what his world would be like.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, I trusted that he knows what&#39;s in his heart...he knows what he<br/>
LOVES.  So we talk about the monsters (neopets characters, pokemon, his own<br/>
monster characters that he draws).  He draws them.  he writes stories about<br/>
them.  <br/>
<br/>
And because he&#39;s allowed to get his fill of his obsession, he&#39;s also able to<br/>
LET IT GO.  He&#39;s able to expand his world and move onto other things BECAUSE<br/>
he&#39;s been *allowed* to obsess...not only allowed, but encouraged and<br/>
celebrated for his visions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 ***Some kids need to <br/>
be taught, step by step, year after year, how to make the simplest <br/>
decisions.***<br/>
<br/>
Taught?  How?<br/>
<br/>
Every time I get out of the car with my son, I know I have to tell him to be<br/>
aware of the cars coming.  I know his mind is on other things.  It&#39;s just<br/>
something I do.  I don&#39;t shame him, I don&#39;t tell him over and over that this<br/>
is something that HE needs to learn.  It&#39;s something that I have to do..<br/>
because I am his mother, his protector at this point in his life.  <br/>
<br/>
Because he is not shamed nor made to feel that he has SO much to learn about<br/>
the real world, he is learning.  Joyfully.  Happily.  Confidently.  He is<br/>
proud of Who He Is.  He&#39;s never known any other way to be.  <br/>
<br/>
***Anyone with an autistic child, for example, knows that radical <br/>
unschooling isn&#39;t an option.***<br/>
<br/>
This is wrong to say and it is just not true.<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschooling is the ONLY option to save these children&#39;s lives.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t think so, then you don&#39;t really know what radical unschooling<br/>
is about.  It&#39;s not about leaving them alone...it&#39;s hard work to unschool my<br/>
special needs child.<br/>
<br/>
***Sure, <br/>
unschooling is a goal. But fact is, folks, that not all of us are <br/>
gonna get there.***<br/>
<br/>
Why not?  You could get there right now...today.  Go read the message boards<br/>
at www.unschooling.com ~ read the special needs folders.  <br/>
<br/>
***Unschooling mail lists give me the willies. I&#39;ve got them set <br/>
for &quot;nomail&quot;, so I don&#39;t accidentially open some letter of <br/>
condemnation, where somebody gets trounced, politely or otherwise, <br/>
for not doing it &quot;the right way&quot;. I&#39;m sure I miss a lot of tips and <br/>
ideas that I might be able to incorporate into my family&#39;s ways of <br/>
living and learning. But some days I&#39;m just too stressed to have any <br/>
tolerance toward the fanatical preachers of the Absolute Revealed <br/>
Truth of unschooling.***<br/>
<br/>
So why are you striving for unschooling then?  If you don&#39;t want to read<br/>
about how it WORKS??  Because it works...but only if you don&#39;t damage your<br/>
child&#39;s definition of LEARNING.  Any damage done needs to be un-done...<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works ESPECIALLY for special needs kids.<br/>
