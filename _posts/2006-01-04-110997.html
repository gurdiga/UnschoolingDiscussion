<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121066443">My youngest two do not like to lose at games.  They are both eager <br/>
to play, but have high expectations that they&#39;ll win every time.  <br/>
I&#39;ve tried the &#39;the fun is in playing not winning&#39; talk but that&#39;s <br/>
obviously not working.  My dd7 will be very open and say she&#39;s <br/>
willing to play as long as she gets to win.  Often times we just <br/>
don&#39;t play because I can&#39;t make such a promise.  Am I wrong in just <br/>
suggesting we not play games that result in only one winner?  This <br/>
happens for video games, board games, and card games.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I remember going through this with my oldest when she was less <br/>
than 10 years old.  She&#39;s now 13 and doesn&#39;t mind losing.  So I do <br/>
know my other 2 children will likely outgrow this attitude.  I&#39;m <br/>
just not sure if there is anything else we can do to help.  My ds9 <br/>
was so excited to play a Nintendo game with me a few days ago and I <br/>
happily agreed.  I tried throwing the game a little.  There are many <br/>
chance games that require luck.  He still came in last place and was <br/>
simply devastated!  He&#39;s a very moody young man and he was truly <br/>
depressed at his poor results.  My heart hurt for him and I told him <br/>
that I loved him too much to see him hurt like this and that maybe <br/>
we just shouldn&#39;t play games that would make him feel so bad.  That <br/>
made him feel even worse.  Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, he doesn&#39;t lose everytime either.  He&#39;s actually very good at <br/>
many games.  The one we played together is a new game so none of us <br/>
are experts yet.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>=============================<br/>
<br/>
Keith (the dad) doesn&#39;t like the how-to-host-a-murder type games,  <br/>
because if there&#39;s no winner, he sees no point in playing.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby (the eldest) hated to lose.  If he lost a game he would  <br/>
immediately get up and go do something else, not stick around for  <br/>
another round, not wait to see who came in second, nothing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the kind of person who&#39;s willing to lose just to have the social  <br/>
time with the other people, sitting and messing with cards, or dice,  <br/>
or whatever.  That, for me, is the fun part.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe to help him understand it a little, you could talk about coin  <br/>
tosses or dice throws, and say &quot;Would you only throw it if you knew  <br/>
it would come up heads, or a six?&quot;  Don&#39;t harp on it, just maybe put  <br/>
something out there like that for him to think about.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-My heart hurt for him and I told him<br/>
that I loved him too much to see him hurt like this and that maybe<br/>
we just shouldn&#39;t play games that would make him feel so bad.  That<br/>
made him feel even worse.  Any suggestions?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe brainstorm with him and the other kids about what options there  <br/>
are.  There&#39;s a whole games company (maybe more than one) that  <br/>
manufactures and sells cooperative games.  That could be something  <br/>
you could bring into the house (their catalog or website) as part of  <br/>
the discussion.   Maybe talking about the nature of &quot;fun&quot; (what it  <br/>
really means to have fun) would help too.  It&#39;s partly a maturity  <br/>
problem, but partly a philosophical one.  If your heart is going to  <br/>
hurt, and he&#39;s going to be devastated, it&#39;s too super-charged to  <br/>
continue as you&#39;re going.  I think some deep breathing and  <br/>
brainstorming will help him see that he needs to be part of the  <br/>
solution if he wants the problem to remain in any form at all.<br/>
<br/>
Now that Kirby&#39;s 19, he can drive to another state for a gaming  <br/>
tournament, lose badly and still be having fun.  So there&#39;s hope. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-228041922">Hmm DS is 7 and wants to win all the time too. Sometimes, mid-game, <br/>
if he&#39;s losing and getting upset, we just stop the game right there <br/>
and put it aside until he&#39;s cooled down and can play again. <br/>
Sometimes that means starting over again entirely several days <br/>
later. Sometimes it just means he goes and gets a drink of water and <br/>
comes right back. A biggie (aside from just general gradually <br/>
increasing maturity levels) is seeing us (me and DH) handle winning <br/>
and losing and playing. There have been times when DS has said &quot;How <br/>
about you play Daddy?&quot; and DH and I will play whatever, winning, <br/>
losing, mainly having fun either way. One thing we did when we got <br/>
an air hockey table and he kept losing (he&#39;d miss a shot or we&#39;d <br/>
score a goal and he&#39;d get frustrated and lose focus and miss more) <br/>
is take a two pronged approach (a) remind him to take a breath to <br/>
refocus after every goal (whether he scored or his opponent) (b) <br/>
we&#39;d have practice sessions (instigated by him) where I&#39;d show or <br/>
explain how I do something - in the case of air hockey, we&#39;d <br/>
do &quot;defense practice&quot; where he&#39;d defend his goal with no thought of <br/>
scoring and winning or we&#39;d do &quot;offense practice&quot; where he&#39;d fire <br/>
shots at my goal and I wasn&#39;t trying to score. Gradually, he could <br/>
see the improvement in closer scores and even winning some of the <br/>
games. Then we could apply that to other things. Games of chance <br/>
(things involving rolls of the dice and draws of the cards) are <br/>
things he likes because sometimes even the best strategy loses to a <br/>
fortunate turn of a card. He&#39;s really good at Mexican train <br/>
dominoes, for example, which often hinges on what you draw when. <br/>
Video games, he prefers the ones where he can team up with another <br/>
player and work with them - James Bond games in multiplayer mode are <br/>
some favorites. The Lego Star Wars game actually allows for players <br/>
to alternate who is the &#39;leader&#39; so that when DS reaches a spot that <br/>
is difficult, DH can take the lead and show him how to get through <br/>
it, then DS can take over again as lead. Right now DH and DS are <br/>
getting into &quot;Brick Wars&quot; - you build Lego buildings and use the <br/>
mini figures and have battles - there&#39;s a whole rule book for it - <br/>
how far you can move each character on each turn, etc AND the <br/>
effectiveness of a shot or strategy depends on a roll of the dice (6 <br/>
and 8 sided dice are used). For example, whether a rifle shot hits <br/>
what you target depends on whether you get a roll greater than 5 on <br/>
an 8 sided die (5,6,7,8). DH lost this morning because he kept <br/>
getting 1s and 2s which are generally misses. So there&#39;s skill and <br/>
strategy (placement of players, where and when they move, etc) but <br/>
there&#39;s also an element of plain old luck in the roll of the dice. <br/>
That really helps because then DS can see how DH or I handle losing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>With 5 yr old ds, I try to see this positively: he has a need for <br/>
competition. So how can we fill this need? Make up lots of silly <br/>
games that he can win at. We&#39;ll race around and I&#39;ll fall down, for <br/>
example. (A couple days ago, he asked dd (3) to race and she didn&#39;t <br/>
want to, so *he* offered to fall down every time!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll play and insist that I want to win and get mad if I don&#39;t--<br/>
clearly being silly.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, we do it in other ways, too, not just silly ones. If you give <br/>
him a bunch of ways to win while you are a graceful loser--or <br/>
playing at being a grumpy loser--that may help a lot more than <br/>
explaining the concept one more time.<br/>
<br/>
Cooperative games can be great, but I&#39;ve seen some people (not <br/>
saying anyone here necessarily) try to eliminate competition if a <br/>
child isn&#39;t handling it well, instead of treating the need to win <br/>
like any other need.<br/>
<br/>
 They are both eager <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes that&#39;s true. Not always, though, as they seem to be <br/>
telling you. You can ask if they want to play by the rules or if <br/>
they want to be sure to win. And then accept the answer!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will tell him occasionally that I like to win, too, so I&#39;d rather <br/>
play by the rules so that I have a chance to win. Depends on his <br/>
mood...I don&#39;t think that letting him win a bunch of times will mean <br/>
that he never learns to lose. I think that by being open about his <br/>
needs and lightly mentioning mine occasionally he&#39;s got a better <br/>
grasp of competition and his feelings than some adults I know!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781250546">I had one child who couldn&#39;t stand to lose -- actually, it wasn&#39;t the  <br/>
&quot;losing&quot; she didn&#39;t like, she simply felt that her sisters were  <br/>
better at everything than she was (middle child) and, to her, it was  <br/>
&quot;proof&quot; of that, every time she lost at a game.  Her little sister  <br/>
WAS always really good at games - she concentrates, she has an  <br/>
ability to understand probabilities, she thinks strategically AND  <br/>
she&#39;s very visual so a lot of children&#39;s games, that tend to rely on  <br/>
visual memory, were easier for her. The game, SET, for example, was  <br/>
amazingly easy for Rosie when she was very little -- she could sit  <br/>
there and pick out sets as fast as the dealer could put the cards  <br/>
down, while the rest of us would have to stare at the cards for a  <br/>
while and MAYBE find a set. This was the most extremely problematic  <br/>
game, but also strategy games, like Penne and Mastermind and Othello,  <br/>
were Rosie&#39;s cup of tea, while Roxana didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; them quite as well.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out as they got a little older, Roxana got so good at word  <br/>
games that her sisters didn&#39;t want to play those with HER - it isn&#39;t  <br/>
a matter of not winning, it is a matter of her playing so much better  <br/>
that they don&#39;t even get many turns.<br/>
<br/>
So then she was on the other side of the issue - wanting to play  <br/>
games and others not wanting to play with her.<br/>
<br/>
By then, I&#39;d gotten good at making up new rules for games - so that  <br/>
it was still fun, but not as competitive - sometimes it worked if I  <br/>
introduced MORE luck to make it more even. For example, there are  <br/>
games where a player gets to continue as long as they are succeeding.  <br/>
We&#39;d decide, instead, that if they succeeded, the could roll a die  <br/>
and if it came up even, they could play again, otherwise the could  <br/>
pick another player to get an extra turn. There were games where  <br/>
everyone played at once - like SET - but we&#39;d play it taking turns,  <br/>
instead. There were games that we changed the entire GOAL of the game  <br/>
- made the goal one that the players would have to cooperative  <br/>
together in order to achieve. For example, you can play chess  <br/>
cooperatively by making up some interesting rules such as - the goal  <br/>
is to checkmate BOTH kings - and if a piece crosses a line across the  <br/>
center of the board, the other player takes control of that piece. So  <br/>
players start out controlling all white or all black pieces because  <br/>
you line them up as usual on each side of the board, but if a piece  <br/>
crosses over the center and lands on the other side, the other player  <br/>
takes over control of that piece. What happens is that the players  <br/>
have to figure out WITHOUT discussing it, what the other player is  <br/>
thinking of doing - and try to help with that so that both kings can  <br/>
end up checkmated.<br/>
<br/>
Another possibility is just to &quot;handicap&quot; the adults or other people  <br/>
who are clearly better at the game - and with a young kid who really  <br/>
HATES to lose - handicap them enough so that the kid always wins. For  <br/>
example, just make a rule - &quot;Kids get triple points of adults&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;Kids always get two turns, adults only get one.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When the child is ready to take the chance of losing, he&#39;ll point out  <br/>
the unfairness of such rules, himself, and say, &quot;Let&#39;s play with  <br/>
everybody getting the same points, okay?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Video games --- Rosie played sports video games with her dad - she  <br/>
was never one to have a problem with losing (she also plays a lot of  <br/>
soccer and doesn&#39;t get devastated by her real-life teams losing,  <br/>
either, completely gets it that it is part of the game and that if  <br/>
the possibility of losing wasn&#39;t there, the game wouldn&#39;t be fun).  <br/>
Roxana plays &quot;The Sims&quot; a LOT on her computer. Oh - and she was one  <br/>
of the first few hundred people to get involved on the NeoPets site  <br/>
when it was brand-new - and she never seemed to have any problem with  <br/>
&quot;losing&quot; there. In fact, Rox seemed mostly to be okay with any games  <br/>
in which there is role playing involved. So maybe if a child is  <br/>
having problems with losing videogames, it might be good to get them  <br/>
some games that are more role-playing oriented than &quot;beat this level&quot;  <br/>
oriented? There are games where &quot;losing&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you have to  <br/>
start ALL the way over -- with Zoombinis, for example, if you don&#39;t  <br/>
make it past a certain part, you don&#39;t go back to the beginning, you  <br/>
go back a little ways and get to keep trying until you DO make it.<br/>
<br/>
So - just somewhat random thoughts on games and losing. Hope there is  <br/>
something in all that which somebody might find useful.<br/>

<br/>
Really good ideas.<br/>
<br/>
My dad&#39;s mom was a nurse, and once when we asked her to play hospital  <br/>
with us, thinking she would show us what she did at work, she said  <br/>
okay, but she wanted to be the patient.   She went through a really  <br/>
funny series of complaints and requests, and we couldn&#39;t stop  <br/>
laughing.  We also knew, then, what she did at work.  She had asked  <br/>
us to fluff her pillow and close the window and cover up her feet,  <br/>
and said it was too hot and she was thirsty and she was hungry, but  <br/>
she didn&#39;t like the pretend food we brought, and on and on.  It was  <br/>
pretty fun, and thinking about it gave me ideas about how not to act  <br/>
when, years later, I was in a hospital for the first time.<br/>

never apparent, as you&#39;re playing, and that&#39;s cool.<br/>
<br/>
We used to let the baby (whichever was the baby in that season) &quot;play  <br/>
wrong&quot; even though Kirby would complain.  When it was Marty&#39;s turn,  <br/>
or Holly&#39;s, they would throw dice and move a piece, and it didn&#39;t  <br/>
matter which direction or how many spaces, as long as they didn&#39;t  <br/>
mess Kirby&#39;s piece up.   If they  moved mine or Keith&#39;s, we just  <br/>
played from where they left it, or slipped it back to the right place  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-577102960">We&#39;ve really tried to not focus on the &quot;winning&quot; part of games over <br/>
here, but the fun of just being together. Many times we just play <br/>
without declaring a winner, or we play games that don&#39;t have any <br/>
winning or losing to them.<br/>
<br/>
In spite of all that, my youngest (Jalen, almost 5) is very focused <br/>
on winning everything! Just walking to the van or running up the <br/>
stairs is turned into a contest for him. Everything. I think it&#39;s <br/>
partly age, partly personality. The cool thing for me, is my other <br/>
children are enough older that they just go along with him for the <br/>
most part....so it&#39;s usually ok.<br/>
<br/>
I got them a Dora Memory game for Christmas, which Sierra loves. <br/>
When Jalen gets his mind set on a pair, and someone else gets it,he <br/>
just falls apart. We just hand him the set and keep on playing, then <br/>
he&#39;s happy.:) He ends up with pairs that aren&#39;t really his, but <br/>
nobody cares. If one of the other kids doesn&#39;t want to give him the <br/>
pair, we just tell him they&#39;re keeping it and he&#39;s ok. Because we <br/>
warp the rules a lot, just to keep it fun, I think he trusts that it <br/>
will work in his favor enough.<br/>
<br/>
Other games, he will get frustrated or bored and just walk away, at <br/>
which point we all play his pieces for him until he comes back.<br/>
We had Chinese Checkers going the other night and he wasn&#39;t even <br/>
there for half of the game, and WON! Ok, our friend Mary <br/>
really &quot;won&quot; for him, but everyone had a good time and no hard <br/>
feelings.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if any of this is helpful, but if you can just warp the <br/>
rules once in a while, or play games that have no winner or loser, <br/>
maybe it will help. He&#39;ll probably outgrow the intensity over <br/>
winning.:)<br/>

and DS vs DH (which is the usual combo). Or, he&#39;ll pick one of us to <br/>
be his &#39;assistant&#39; or &#39;adviser&#39; and when he has a question about <br/>
what card to play or whatever, we peek at his hand and make a <br/>
suggestion or two, maybe point out a series of possible moves <br/>
depending on what game it is, then go back to our own hand. Our <br/>
current fav new game is the Star Wars version of Risk played with <br/>
the Star Wars rules, not the traditional Risk rules. With 3 players, <br/>
2 team up as the Separatists (gold team and red team) and the other <br/>
player plays both the other teams (black and blue) and gets to <br/>
manage Darth Sidious and decide when to use Order 66 and all. Lots <br/>
of ways the Separatists can coordinate efforts and help each other. <br/>
Once Order 66 happens, Darth Sidious is placed on the game board - <br/>
you can win by simply capturing that planet instead of having to <br/>
defeat all the opposing planets (countries in traditional Risk). So <br/>
far DS has managed to capture Darth Sidious eventually in every game <br/>
we&#39;ve played - it&#39;s part strategy, part roll of the dice luck, part <br/>
fortunate cards to play. <br/>
