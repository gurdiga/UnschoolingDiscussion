I was just thinking about what we could have done with the money saved if we hadn&#39;t bought the crib, but I just realized that my il&#39;s gave us that money! LOL!<br>

I put one bed against the wall and the other one next to it, then I put very <br/>
thin, flat pillows over the cracks.  So if the beds spread apart a little the <br/>
pillows saved me.  The other thing you might consider, is something to keep <br/>

&gt;I put one bed against the wall and the other one next to it, then I put <br/>
&gt;very<br/>

&gt;the<br/>

&gt;the beds from shifting apart between the box spring and mattress, like the<br/>

&gt;Although, I have never tried it.  Just a thought.....<br/>

nurse at night, thank god.  That was on OK thing to do (nurse them both at<br/>
night) for a few years, but I do admit to being pleased when they stopped<br/>
(the last just stopped this winter when I was pregnant and I think the<br/>
older one stopped the previous winter).  I figure I have 3-4, maybe 5,<br/>
years of night nursing with this most recent one, and that&#39;s ok, too, but<br/>
this time it is just one child, which makes a big difference:)  And then<br/>
he will move into another bed, too.<br/>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can imagine how said you feel when you&#39;re daughter is being so independent, but just think how wonderful it is that because you met all of her attachment and security needs when she was an infant you gave her the self-confidence to do all of these things on her own. I wouldn&#39;t doubt that your son might have been hanging on a bit longer because of those nights in the crib, but every child is different. You just have to do what works with each one, huh?<br>

  <div><br></div>Brynn-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can imagine how said you feel 
  when you&#39;re daughter is being so independent, but just think how wonderful it 
  is that because you met all of her attachment and security needs when she was 
  an infant you gave her the self-confidence to do all of these things on her 
  own. I wouldn&#39;t doubt that your son might have been hanging on a bit longer 
  because of those nights in the crib, but every child is different. You just 
  have to do what works with each one, huh?<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502154581">in our house the sleeping arrangement is: in my double bed (no frame, just<br/>
mattresses on floor, against wall) dd # 3 against wall, dd # 2 in the<br/>
middle, then me on the outside nextt to side rail (in case dd 3 nurses in<br/>
night and ends up on my other side by mistake). dh is in br # 2 on bottom<br/>
bunk of bunk beds or on couch in liv. rm. dd #`1 is either on a fouton in my<br/>
br., on top bunk with daddy or (as of tonight) in her own brand new basement<br/>
room. (we&#39;ll see &lt;g&gt;). Confusing to others, but it works for us.<br/>

&gt; When we finally gave up on the cot, we turned the bed round so<br/>
&gt; that dd2 was next to the wall, me next (the meat in the sandwich)<br/>
&gt; and dd1 at the other side.  Dh slept on the floor &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; True...but in a pinch, I end up sleeping half in the<br/>
&gt; sidecar, so there&#39;s <br/>
&gt; still more space. Besides you can sleep all the way to<br/>
&gt; the edge of the bed <br/>
&gt; without the six inch or so &quot;safety margin&quot; most of us<br/>
&gt; leave.<br/>
