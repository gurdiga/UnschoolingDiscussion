<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683460451">Sandra, I have to disagree here.  The point, for me, about HE is choice.<br/>
The choice whether to go to college, or train as an apprentice, or do<br/>
nothing, or get pregnant at sixteen (I hope not, but it&#39;s a choice!)  Some<br/>
people&#39;s God-given gifts will not serve them in coolege.  Mine would have,<br/>
but I chose not to go.<br/>
<br/>
The world would be a better place without the pursuit of money, but that&#39;s<br/>
how it is.  The world would be a better place without forcing people into<br/>
boxes that don&#39;t fit them.  The world would be a better place if people knew<br/>
what they were, and stopped trying to be what they aren&#39;t.  That&#39;s my<br/>
soapbox time over, I&#39;ll hand over to someone else!<br/>
<br/>
Regards<br/>
Tracy<br/>
