<div id="ygrps-yiv-997958654">Another in my series of how to transition from one worldview to <br/>
another. :)<br/>
<br/>
The best advice I&#39;ve rec&#39;d from this list has had to do with being <br/>
honest in the process and only changing a practice gradually, as <br/>
my husband and I both &quot;believe&quot; in it. That took so much <br/>
pressure off of us. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an example.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids do nightly clean up tasks after meals and they do one <br/>
household &quot;chore&quot; per week to help keep the house clean. <br/>
Neither my husband nor I felt ready to just &quot;ditch&quot; these practices, <br/>
even though from reading here I felt that perhaps that ought to be <br/>
the goal. Then we stepped back a bit and realized that <br/>
because of having these &quot;duties&quot; assigned to our kids, perhaps <br/>
we took their help for granted and instead of lifting the duties, we <br/>
could begin by offering help, pitching in, complimenting, and <br/>
even doing the task for a child on occasion. I had never thought <br/>
this way. So instead of saying : &quot;No more jobs!&quot; we&#39;ve said, <br/>
&quot;You&#39;re going to a friend&#39;s tonight? Let me clean off the counters <br/>
for you so you can get ready.&quot; Or, &quot;I see you&#39;re playing with your <br/>
dolls. How about I put out the napkins and you come and add the <br/>
forks and knives when you&#39;re done.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or we&#39;ve said, &quot;You&#39;re doing a gorgeous job on those dishes. <br/>
Thanks so much for doing them!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve also backed off of feeling that the kids &quot;owe&quot; us their help <br/>
during the other hours of the day. I no longer say, &quot;Everyone stop <br/>
what you&#39;re doing. We&#39;re going to clean up the living room now.&quot; <br/>
Now I say, &quot;For my sanity I need this room picked up. Does <br/>
anyone want to help me? What&#39;s a good time for you?&quot; If no one <br/>
wants to help, I do it myself. (So far that has *never* happened. <br/>
Lucky me.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also noticed that because I&#39;ve been far more open about <br/>
helping the kids (I used to do it at times, feeling put upon. Now I <br/>
offer to help cheerfully and say that I am helping, not doing it <br/>
because he/she wouldn&#39;t), the kids are so much more <br/>
enthusiastic to help me when I ask.<br/>
<br/>
Just this morning, I noticed lots of Capri Sun packages on the <br/>
floor and snotty tissues (we have sick kids). I commented, &quot;Wow, <br/>
this room is full of Kleenex and wrappers.&quot; My 8yo who is the <br/>
most resistant to ever lifting a finger chimed in, &quot;Want me to help <br/>
you clean them up Mom?&quot; Knock me over with a feather. This is <br/>
his first free offer since we began six weeks ago. I was so <br/>
touched.<br/>
<br/>
So we still have their basic chores in place since these are <br/>
working, but we&#39;ve changed the context for everything related to <br/>
housework and housekeeping. There is more mutuality, support <br/>
and freedom than before. I don&#39;t know where we&#39;ll end up, but <br/>
right now, this feels honest for us and both my dh and I can <br/>
support it without resentment or internal conflict.<br/>

Your post was great.  It shows how you can come to understand a new concept<br/>
and make it work for you.  You may gradually move on toward not having<br/>
assigned chores, but your change in attitude about the chores has obviously<br/>
had a positive effect on your children and you.  We did a similar thing is<br/>
regards to the TV.  Instead of one day announcing that *you can now watch<br/>
all the TV you want*, we gradually loosened the strings by saying yes if<br/>
they *asked* to watch more. (They didn&#39;t ask often because they were used to<br/>
watching their favorite shows and turning it off.)  While occasionally they<br/>
will spend the better part of  the day watching TV, most of the time they<br/>
watch little and often none.  They still prefer to play most of the day, not<br/>
watch TV, despite the fact that they have the option to watch all day. But I<br/>
think if I had just announced one day that they *could watch all the TV they<br/>
want*, they would have probably sat down in front of the TV and stayed there<br/>
until it drove me crazy.   <br/>
