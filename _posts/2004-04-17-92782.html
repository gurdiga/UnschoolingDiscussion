<div id="ygrps-yiv-344566217">[In response to the prot telling the therapist that there is no<br/>
government] &quot;What if no one notices that something needs to be done?<br/>
What if someone knows something needs to be done but refused to do<br/>
it? What if a person decides to do nothing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That doesn&#39;t happen on K-PAX.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Never?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What would be the point?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, to express dissatisfaction over the wages being paid, for one<br/>
thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We don&#39;t have &#39;wages&#39; on K-PAX. Or money of any kind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I jotted this down. &quot;No money? What do you barter with?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We don&#39;t &#39;barter&#39;. You really should learn to listen to your<br/>
patients, doctor. I told you before--if something needs to be done,<br/>
you do it. If someone needs something you have, you give it to him.<br/>
This avoids a multitude of problems and has worked pretty well on our<br/>
PLANET for several billion years.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At what age did you begin school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There are no schools on K-PAX.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not surprised. But you are obviously an educated person.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I am not a &#39;person&#39;. I am a being. All K-PAXians are educated.<br/>
But education does not come from schools. Education stems from the<br/>
desire to learn. With that, you don&#39;t need school. Without it, all<br/>
the schools in the UNIVERSE are useless.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;One final question. You have said that your childhood was a happy<br/>
one. Did you have other children to play with?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hardly any. There are very few children anywhere on K-PAX, as I<br/>
have indicated. Besides that, there is no distinction between &#39;work&#39;<br/>
and &#39;play&#39; on our PLANET. On EARTH, children are encouraged to play<br/>
all the time. This is because you believe they should remain<br/>
innocent of their approaching adulthood for as long as possible,<br/>
apparently because the latter is so distasteful. On K-PAX, children<br/>
and adults are all part of the same thing. On our PLANET life is<br/>
fun, and interesting. There is no need for mindless games, either<br/>
for children or adults. No need for escape into soap operas,<br/>
football, alcohol, or other drugs. Did I have a happy childhood on K-<br/>
PAX? Of course. And a happy adulthood as well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone once said, &quot;It is never to late to have a happy childhood.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t childhood the most wonderful time!! I think that is when we <br/>
are elated<br/>
about EVERYTHING and if we are *lucky* enough to appreciate, it sets <br/>
the tone<br/>
for the whole rest of our lives.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how old we get,<br/>
we can always be truly young again by recapturing these times in our <br/>
minds even<br/>
if only for a moment or two and the joy it brings up our spirits! Ah!<br/>
- the simple pleasures!!</div>
