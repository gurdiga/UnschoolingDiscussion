<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958896714"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: &quot;Eileen M.&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ravensegg@...">ravensegg@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t tell you how reassuring it is to read your<br/>
&gt; posts.  My parents are fretting away, keep trying to<br/>
&gt; push me into scheduling up our days more.  It&#39;s nice<br/>
&gt; to know that it&#39;s at least *possible* that my son can<br/>
&gt; grow up to be functional even if I go with my heart<br/>
&gt; and don&#39;t *push* him into achievement.  I think we<br/>
&gt; *all* fear that he will only do what is easy and avoid<br/>
&gt; anything that requires sustained effort... learned<br/>
&gt; helplessness is a huge issue in my family, and my son<br/>
&gt; shows every sign of being a chip off the familial<br/>
&gt; block.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So let&#39;s see.... your family has huge problems with motivation, and yet they<br/>
want you to take their advice on child-rearing???<br/>
<br/>
I always think it&#39;s interesting when that happens. That&#39;s like my mom giving<br/>
me advice on why I should force my kids to eat certain things. This after<br/>
she&#39;s spent a lifetime on and off diets, my sister almost died of<br/>
anorexia... yeah, mom I really need to start the food battles with my kids<br/>
early.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it seems like it&#39;s the things that people are most frustrated with<br/>
in their own life that they choose to badger other people about doing just<br/>
like them, illogical as that may be.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I read too much, I think; half of the &#39;experts&#39; say<br/>
&gt; that children shouldn&#39;t be pushed too hard, the other<br/>
&gt; says that their anxieties and fears will overwhelm<br/>
&gt; them later if they don&#39;t learn how to deal with them<br/>
&gt; by overcoming teasing etc. in childhood.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The problem is, there&#39;s no such thing as &quot;experts&quot; other than us, when it<br/>
comes to our own children. And most of the &quot;problems&quot; that we&#39;re supposed to<br/>
be preparing our kids for come from.... compulsory schooling! In the<br/>
parenting magazines for children of my son&#39;s age (almost kindergarten) are<br/>
tons of articles about how to deal with teasing, bullying, wearing the right<br/>
clothes.... all these &quot;crises&quot; are *manufactured* by our mandatory prison<br/>
...er..school.. sentences for children. Remove the entire issue of forced<br/>
schooling from our kids lives, and so many of these &quot;problems&quot;, anxieties,<br/>
and fears are just non-issues (or at the very least, much smaller issues).<br/>
I&#39;m always amazed at how much my son already *doesn&#39;t* know about these<br/>
issues as he&#39;s never been in preschool. He doesn&#39;t yet know that people<br/>
might not want to talk or play with him, that his beloved plaid jeans are<br/>
hopelessly out of fashion, that boys don&#39;t wear &quot;magical&quot; sparkly fingernail<br/>
polish, that he still talks with a bit of a lisp.... I&#39;m sure he will<br/>
discover these things, over time, but they are not being rammed down his<br/>
throat 8 hours a day by other small institutionalized souls who have nothing<br/>
else to occupy their time.<br/>

with *my* lack of motivation, the fact is that their<br/>
&#39;push her til she squeaks&#39; method certainly didn&#39;t<br/>
work with *me*, so why they think it will work with ds<br/>
I have no clue.  If I tried to do things their way the<br/>
results would be even worse, because a)I would feel<br/>
guilty and resistant to it myself and b)I wouldn&#39;t do<br/>
it consistantly, so it would just confuse my ds and<br/>
make him even more passive-resistant than he is now.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll do what feels right to *me*.  At least<br/>
then he&#39;ll be happy, even if he comes out lazy and<br/>
unmotivated!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Illogical, yes, but true nonetheless, IMO.  I know<br/>
that the faults that bother me most in other people<br/>
are the ones that are either go against dearly held<br/>
values of mine OR the ones I have myself. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If our experience of summer break is any indication, I<br/>
think that&#39;s true.  I had to take my son to a<br/>
therapist this winter because he was having outbursts<br/>
of self-destructive anger where he was saying horrible<br/>
things *about himself* and slamming his head against<br/>
walls.  I told the therapists how painful it was to<br/>
see this, when all summer he had been so happy and<br/>
carefree... and then within a week of starting school<br/>
he was depressed and anxious and self-abusing.  I&#39;m<br/>
looking forward to seeing my enthusiastic, sunny child<br/>
again!<br/>
