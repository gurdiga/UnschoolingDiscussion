<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501230836">Serendipitously I stumbled across a book at the library tonight that I (so <br/>
far) think could be wonderful for adults who fear math. Arithmetic for Human <br/>
Beings (An anti-textbook for people who loathe arithmetic) by Robert Froman<br/>
<br/>
From the introduction:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Millions of people loathe arithmetic. They have good reason to. The subject <br/>
is taught in most elementary schools as if the whole idea is to make it <br/>
loathsome. Only those with great aptitude for it are likely to retain interest in <br/>
it...<br/>
<br/>
But unlike the algebra and geometry inflicted on highschool students, <br/>
arithmetic will not go away and leave you alone after you are paroled from the <br/>
schoolroom. All life long it keeps popping up in supermarkets, kitchens, workshops, <br/>
offices, almost everywhere - even in the far reaches of the backwoods. When it <br/>
does, the schools have left most of us no alternative to going into a trance <br/>
and trying to remember elementary textbook procedures...<br/>
<br/>
That schoolroom experience of arithmetic is much like what continues to <br/>
short-circuit many adult minds in later years. For such adults that experience has <br/>
made unquestionable the belief that in any arithmetic question the numbers <br/>
involved are all-important and the proper way to perform each of the four basic <br/>
operations invariable.<br/>
<br/>
In real life the numbers are NOT the most important parts of problems. What <br/>
the numbers stand for is what matters most. How the necessary operations on <br/>
those numbers should be performed depends on what you want to know...<br/>
<br/>
Arithmetic for Human Beings is intended as the opposite of a textbook, a kind <br/>
of anti-textbook. It is primarily a book to be read, not labored over. The <br/>
suggestions it offers are not going to be repeated endlessly, summarized at the <br/>
ends of chapters, and reinforced with large numbers of space-filling examples <br/>
and exercises. Such paraphernalia would be useless for the purpose here. The <br/>
only way you can learn to make use of these suggestions is by trying them in <br/>
situations that matter to you, not on artificial problems dreamed up by someone <br/>
else. The suggestions are meaningful only when you really want to know <br/>
something that arithmetic can help you find out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What follows is advice on estimation, approximation, mental arithmetic, and <br/>
cutting problems down to size - covering multiplication, addition, subtraction, <br/>
division, fractions, negative numbers, measurements, and probability. <br/>
<br/>
The book is long out of print but seems to be available used very cheaply. <br/>
(If you look on Amazon check by author, I found it catalogued there as  ARITH <br/>
FOR HUM BNGS ) I&#39;m going to get a copy for my most math phobic friend, the one <br/>
who I promised could always call me for help in explaining math to her kids <br/>
when she was talking about needing to send them to school because of math. She <br/>
panics and quite literally shuts down when faced with numbers, this looks like <br/>
it might help.<br/>
