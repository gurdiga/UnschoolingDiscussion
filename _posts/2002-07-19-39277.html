Lilly-weeks from 5) but had to jump in on this one...one of my mom&#39;s favorite <br/>
gifts was one I made (and as an adult mind you) from lace & matting board <br/>
from the recycling center and a gold paint pen written in calligraphy style:<br/>

She has it hanging in her kitchen right next to &quot;Dull women have immaculate <br/>
houses.&quot;  LOL<br/>

This is a great group and I gather lots of good ideas.  I&#39;ll try to be a good <br/>
contributor in the future (I know it&#39;s not fair just to lurk and benefit <br/>
without giving some back!)<br/>

&gt; loner, his best friend is his 17 year old homeschooled<br/>
&gt; brother.  My feelings on the subject are that he needs<br/>
&gt; to heal himself from his long school career which was<br/>
&gt; one of ridicule from both teachers as well as<br/>
&gt; students, and that I should allow him to progress at<br/>

suddenly know what they wish to do with their lives.  If he&#39;s happy at home<br/>
and not a problem to have around, I don&#39;t see anything wrong with that.<br/>
Maybe in a year or two he&#39;ll have some ideas about the future.  If we are<br/>
willing to wait for our children to be ready to read, then why not be<br/>
willing to wait for them to be ready to leave?<br/>

tons of great adventures. My dream is a rambling old farm house, with huge <br/>
rooms, tons of sunny windows for all my plants, big wrap-around-porch, shade <br/>
trees for tree houses and tire swings, a creek somewhere on the property, and <br/>
both my kids, their significant others, and their kids. That&#39;s what I want. <br/>
