&lt;&lt; These days, people with beliefs like yours aren&#39;t even considered real <br/>
 Christians by the people we&#39;re talking about. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
I feel the same as Pam G. about a lot of things, that&#39;s why I don&#39;t openly <br/>
identify myself as Christian.<br/>
Unity is a &quot;new thought&quot; church which includes metaphysical teachings. That&#39;s <br/>
where I go.<br/>
It&#39;s considered a &quot;theological cult&quot; by mainstream christians and has been <br/>
labeled &quot;dangerous.&quot;<br/>
The term christian implies so much more than what my beliefs encompass.<br/>
I don&#39;t belief Jesus is God, I don&#39;t believe in the Trinity, I don&#39;t believe <br/>
Jesus is the only way to a peaceful afterlife etc....<br/>
So I don&#39;t think of myself as very Christian.<br/>
I prefer &quot;follower of Christ&quot;<br/>
Christian implies too much that I don&#39;t want to be associated with.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
