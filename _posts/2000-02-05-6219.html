&gt; It seems a lot of people think a better school is more strict, &quot;has<br/>
&gt; higher standards&quot;.  I met a mom who is very proud that her kids<br/>
&gt; kindergarten class is so strict bc the children know what the rules<br/>
&gt; are????<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hi,<br/>
<br/>
i went to a b-day party for a 4 yo recently,  all the other kids there met in<br/>
daycare,  we were the only homeschoolers.  i found the dynamic between the<br/>
parents and kids really distant, not without love but without closeness.  the<br/>
parent would stand back and say things like &#39;now uses your words&#39; and the<br/>
kids would be fighting over the toys.  it was odd to me (not the fighting<br/>
part:),  the kids do their thing and the parents do theirs and &#39;never the<br/>
&#39;twain shall meet&#39; just bridged by a bit of vocalization.  it made me think<br/>
that people keep themselves so busy so they don&#39;t have to see what&#39;s really<br/>
happening and if something bad happens they have a good excuse - they were<br/>
too busy.<br/>
<br/>
i have a thing about controlling kids.  boundaries are great but control is a<br/>
different story.  i didn&#39;t give birth to prove to the world i can spawn the<br/>
greatest person that ever lived (though rene&#39; (4) informed me last night that<br/>
he wants to become &#39;a legend&#39; -i&#39;m not completely convinced he clearly<br/>
understands what that is &lt;lol&gt;) or the most obedient or the kid with the best<br/>
manners or any other of their silly accolades.  i did gave birth to<br/>
experience the joy of watching a person develop and find happiness in their<br/>
everyday life and to be of whatever assistance i am able.  i believe<br/>
compassion and good manners are very helpful but only if it is done with<br/>
sincerity not coercion.  this is my problem with schools.<br/>
<br/>
i would be interested in how others step out of the way of their kids and not<br/>
pass on all the issue based in social conformity.  from what i&#39;ve seen some<br/>
of the greatest injustices perpetrated against kids is in the name of social<br/>
conformity.  my son is out spoken - for the good or the bad - i make sure he<br/>
knows his voice carries weight.  i also let him know when he&#39;s driving me<br/>
nuts with his incessant talking.   i do not use the word &#39;incessant&#39; lightly<br/>
- he will talk to anyone anytime for as long as they will sit there.  i can<br/>
not even count the number of picnics of total strangers (more often than not<br/>
adult only) he has invited himself to.  he just parks himself without ever<br/>
questioning whether he would be wanted, in his mind of course they would want<br/>
to hear what he has to say:)<br/>
<br/>
i am not embarrassed by anything he does.  at first i was tempted to feel he<br/>
was a reflection of me and i would be judged by other because of his<br/>
behavior,  but you know so what.  i know people judge,  their thoughts are<br/>
so &#39;loud&#39; you can&#39;t help but know.  what i&#39;ve found is,  trying to control<br/>
(the use of rules) kids or anyone,  sets you up for a power struggle then you<br/>
have to ask yourself &#39;is this really the kind of relationship i want?&#39; and &#39;<br/>
isn&#39;t this just what i have with my parents (or any other person trying to<br/>
have power of you)?&#39;  for me the answers are no and yes respectively.  so i<br/>
accept that i&#39;m breaking with all my &#39;role models&#39; and that leaves me with<br/>
always (at least for now:) having to know why i do what i do and making<br/>
conscious choices so i don&#39;t fall back into repeating what was done to me and<br/>
i must afford this right to my kids.  now that i&#39;ve been able to make the<br/>
transition i feel life doesn&#39;t need to be scheduled or planned or have a<br/>
curriculum to succeed and prosper and be happy but just conscious and sincere<br/>
involvement is needed.<br/>
<br/>
the other thing i wanted to touch on is that there has been a lot of<br/>
discussion about waldorf, which to be honest i only lightly touched on as far<br/>
as reading the emails.  it&#39;s not a big interest of mine though they do<br/>
provide nice products albeit a bit expensive but very good quality.   i<br/>
looked into becoming a waldorf teacher when i lived in northern cal.  but<br/>
backed away.  for me it&#39;s too structured and imposes a reality on to the<br/>
environment rather than allowing one to develop of it&#39;s own accord.   i&#39;m not<br/>
as well read on the specific differences between these philosophies because i<br/>
make mine up as i go and find i&#39;m much happier doing it that way.   it&#39;s hard<br/>
for me to conform to even the alternative methods and this is why i&#39;m on this<br/>
list because for me unschooling is more of a philosophical base and methods<br/>
such as waldorf are more of a structure you &#39;live&#39; in.  just some thoughts<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
 I also know two hs families who live right next to a school.  They use<br/>
 the playground after school hours. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
LOL--same here!<br/>

not only do we live across the street for an elementary school but beside and<br/>
behind us is a daycare.  funny how things happen :)<br/>
<br/>
-susan<br/>
<br/>
ps.  someone was talking about other unschooling lists and said they missed<br/>
the philosophical topics found there.   personal i would love to see those<br/>
kinds of topics grow here.  so if anyone is so inclined i would join in<br/>
though i must admit i do get behind in the messages presently i&#39;ve got nearly<br/>
200 just from this group to read:0</div>

Susan I am in agreement with you too about the structure of the Waldorf way I just like to borrow from what I have appreciated about them esp. their books and art. I would have preferred to become a Waldorf teacher as opposed to a regular elem. teacher in the olden days because I would have liked to further develop that artist that I was ( I realize I still can blossom at home along side my own children) I think lots of parents have trouble out there in Waldorf land and still have to worry about the &quot;waldorf police&quot; who have in some cases literally gone after them! I had a bad experience looking into being a teacher at Antioch was totally dissed by the woman who ran the program and I was over the age of 35 at the time I looked into it. <br/>
I have also gone to Hampshire College a great place for nonconforming &#39;unschoolers&quot; if you can afford it. I think they give scholarships nowadays. I had trouble with the drug culture that was there but hopefully those days are gone.<br/>
Tell us more about your son he sounds so vibrant and full of self esteem! <br/>
