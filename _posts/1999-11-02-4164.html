<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054341025">she was admonished by the teacher for &quot;messy coloring&quot;--my dh and I<br/>
are both artists and we have never colored in the lines!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i remember when I was in first grade and there was a coloring contest.<br/>
i colored allthe time at home and considered myself a good colorer,so<br/>
did my mom. but i got repromanded for not being neat enough.<br/>
though in retrospect what can one expect in coloring those block<br/>
pictures where its one color and you are coloring a carrot or something.<br/>
anyway i was tramatized by the whole thing, i never forgot....:-)</div>

Ah, yes. I remember in second grade my teacher hung my construction paper <br/>
stocking behind the door because I had made it facing the wrong way! To this <br/>
very day, all of my stockings are &quot;backwards&quot;.<br/>

At a class one day my then 4yro son painted a construction paper Easter Bunny <br/>
black. Everyone seemed really bugged by this. The instructor came over and <br/>
asked if he would like another one to paint? Only if he can paint it black I <br/>
told her. At the time black was his color of choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664846821">I learned in school that I was not &quot;good&quot; in art.  I have a dim memory of<br/>
coloring my lips red with a crayon in kindergarten and the teacher<br/>
freaking out bc she thought I was eating the crayon!<br/>
