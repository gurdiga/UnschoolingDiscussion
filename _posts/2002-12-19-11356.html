<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532046622">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Today starts our family&#39;s first ever winter break. Remember Ashley went to 3rd<br/>
grade in the fall. We will most likely watch TV all day. Tessa is sick, 103.5<br/>
fever. She is hot and a bit pale. The wind is howling, rain expected soon, for<br/>
days. Yesterday I hosted a garden class which went very well. The kids made<br/>
planter boxes and planted them with bulbs. Riley showed a little girl how to<br/>
hammer. He even held the nail for her, the brave guy. Tessa stayed inside in a<br/>
blanket. Ashley is in a Nutcracker Performance for the next several nights. We<br/>
went last night, bringing a friend from her school. 250 kids put on this show,<br/>
it&#39;s a city tradition. So we know lots of the cast and it&#39;s fun to see who you<br/>
know in each scene. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling happy having the family all together for several weeks again<br/>
without the 5 times a week, getting Ashley up and out and then picking her up<br/>
mid day. I can say this has been the greatest hurdle for me to jump.She loves<br/>
her class, even though there are mean girls and lairs. She gave her teacher<br/>
tickets to her show for a gift. I&#39;m going to pick up the room Tessa and I<br/>
share. It has become a huge pile of all things.Talk to you all soon,<br/>
<br/>
Mary H.</div>
