hitting home with me. Sandra just <br/>

&lt;&lt;Doesn&#39;t matter whether it was your child&#39;s choice, from her point <br/>
of view.<br/>
And objectively, either. If that turns out to have been &quot;a bad <br/>
choice,&quot; then<br/>
it&#39;s the mom&#39;s fault for allowing him to make a bad choice.<br/>
<br/>
Without choices, people don&#39;t risk as much guilt or failure.<br/>
People can have a measure of innocence and guiltlessness, but it <br/>
costs<br/>
freedom and choice. And it DOES risk failure and disappointment <br/>
every time, at<br/>
<br/>
every turn.<br/>
<br/>
Bummer about the prevalance of homeschooling is that it made school <br/>
a choice<br/>
and spreads the guilt. And the better unschooling works, the more <br/>
guilt<br/>
seeps into having chosen school at home.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it can be helped.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My mother has really been pressuring me about my oldest son entering <br/>
High School next fall. After being out of school since 5th grade, <br/>
and knowing he has always had the option to return, and being <br/>
specifically asked if he wants to &quot;try it&quot;, he said, &quot;No.&quot;  This <br/>
past year has been a difficult one for our son and us, as he has <br/>
wanted to do less of the activities that I do with his younger 2 <br/>
siblings, but he hasn&#39;t found lots that he likes to do with the time <br/>
he would have been involved with us. He does have interests, but is <br/>
often saying he is bored and wants to go somewhere. We usually go <br/>
somewhere new at least once a week, but he rarely admits that it&#39;s <br/>
fun, even if I see him enjoy the activity. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, some of the dumbest things I&#39;ve heard about homeschooling, <br/>
or the &quot;choice&quot; to homeschool, have been made by my mother in her <br/>
desperate attempts to convince me to &quot;send him to High school.&quot; She <br/>
said, &quot;Do you think he&#39;s really old enough to make that kind of <br/>
choice?&quot;  &quot;Maybe he wouldn&#39;t be so bored if he went school, where he <br/>
could be exposed to all kinds of things, and trying new things that <br/>
you can&#39;t expose him to because you have the other two little ones <br/>
there.&quot; (The  &quot;little ones&quot; are 8yo and 5yo) I told her that how can <br/>
school expose him to more than the world outside of school, besides <br/>
the fact that he&#39;s already been to school and he knows what they <br/>
have to offer.<br/>
<br/>
On a more personal note, my mother said, &quot;It&#39;s (homeschooling) is <br/>
fine for the younger ones because it&#39;s working. I don&#39;t see it <br/>
working with him (my 13yo). He&#39;s not doing anything. He&#39;s unhappy <br/>
and he resents you.&quot; I was too defensive to even think to ask her <br/>
how she knew he resents me! But it immediately filled me with such <br/>
GUILT! I&#39;m pretty sure that he is past the point where he would give <br/>
up his freedom to jump through the hoops of traditonal school. We&#39;ve <br/>
talked about it. But could he be resenting me for starting us all <br/>
down this path?  I can&#39;t really talk to him right now, because he is <br/>
on his first trip to a sleepover camp!!! Ugghhhhh!!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe none of this is remotely related. Maybe I&#39;m just grasping at <br/>
straws because I&#39;m panicky, with no one to talk to right now. It&#39;s <br/>
so true, &quot;with great freedom, comes great responsibility.&quot; (Who said <br/>
that?) I thought I had courage in making the choice to unschool, but <br/>
I think I need to review the risks of NOT unschooling. I think I <br/>
could use some backup here, if anyone is so inclined (or not too <br/>
worn out from reading this post!)<br/>

to check it out. (I love that movie.) I thought it was, &quot;With great <br/>
POWER...&quot; or something like that, because it had to do with <br/>
Spiderman&#39;s powers. Now that was Uncle Ben speaking that time, not <br/>
your Ben right, Kelly?  But where did you&#39;re Ben get his quote from, <br/>
any idea? I seem to remember hearing it in connection with voting, <br/>
or some talk aimed at kids to make &quot;wise&quot; decisions. <br/>
