I have found when i buy a toy with the intention of &quot;learning&quot; and it&#39;s not what my kids have asked for I am wasting my money.  My kids have asked for &quot;toys&quot; that fall into the &quot;learning toy&quot; category and for them it&#39;s about &quot;fun.&quot;  I think everything they enjoy doing (or playing with) is a learning adventure so every toy has that potential.<br/>

  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Violent toys?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Is this off-topic?  If it is, please say so . <br/>
<br/>
  I try to be purposeful, or somewhat so, about the toys my kids have.<br/>
  Sure, a lot of it is stuff I wouldn&#39;t consider &quot;learning&quot; toys, etc.,<br/>
  but I have a problem including toys that are &quot;violent&quot; such as guns,<br/>
  swords, green army men.  My thought is that if they want these toys they<br/>
  can fashion them from sticks, bats, green rocks, or whatever.  It is one<br/>
  way I have of sharing nonviolent values w/my kids. <br/>
<br/>
  Do any of you have similar values?  How did you address it with family<br/>
  and friends?  It hasn&#39;t been an issue w/my girl but I expect, based on<br/>
  giving of vague aunts and uncles to other boys in the family, that with<br/>
  this birthday (#2) or next it will be an issue.  I&#39;ve spread the word as<br/>
  best I can, but if such a gift is given, how might I approach it w/out<br/>
  coming off as rude and irrational?<br/>
<br/>
  On a broader note, does it much matter if one has a lot of &quot;learning&quot;<br/>
  toys around the house vs. toys like electronic VTech toys?  (My family&#39;s<br/>
  favorite gifts.)  I&#39;m wondering if I should start constructing a<br/>
  different environment or just wait until they ask for these &quot;learning&quot;<br/>
  toys (tinkertoys, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for any thoughts or advice!<br/>
