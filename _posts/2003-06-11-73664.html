&gt; I guess I&#39;m wondering why such a back slide over something so small? I am so <br/>
&gt; easy going with the kids and am usually the one to calm situations if my <br/>
&gt; husband gets a little antsy over something. Tonight it was the other way around. <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just wondering why this bothers me so much and although I won&#39;t let it <br/>
&gt; happen again, I&#39;m worried that something else might make me react the same <br/>
&gt; way. This just doesn&#39;t seem like me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe you were just in a bad mood. Maybe the tooth hanging there grossed you <br/>
out. Maybe the combination of a bad mood, her crying, and other things just <br/>
made you temporarily act like a jerk.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, I don&#39;t think children are exceptionally fragile (as opposed to <br/>
sensitive). We&#39;re going to act like jerks sometimes, however hard we try not <br/>
to. But it makes an enormous difference to apologize! And kids can see that <br/>
even their usually calm moms can get into a shiity mood, make mistakes...and <br/>
then do what they need to mend the relationship.<br/>
<br/>
For kids (you know, all of them, just like all adults)  who get into bad <br/>
moods and act like jerks sometimes, this is not a bad thing to see. <br/>
<br/>
I can guarantee that something will make you respond the same way (or <br/>
another, new creative way) again, and you&#39;ll be disappointed about it. &#39;Cuz sometimes <br/>
we&#39;re all jerks. But we can all apologize.<br/>
