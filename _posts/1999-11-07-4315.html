<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280834213">Is the &quot;very bold&quot; wallpaper geometric in design?  Some of the examples I <br/>
found in books were like that...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We rent an old, 1912 Edwardian house in Vancouver, B.C. There is very bold<br/>
<br/>
wallpaper behind all of the radiators that was never painted over which was<br/>
<br/>
obviously there before the radiators were installed.  The year that was done?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know.  But I am curious.  In fact I think I will try to find out when <br/>
the<br/>
<br/>
radiators were installed.  If I had to guess maybe the forties.&gt;&gt;</div>
