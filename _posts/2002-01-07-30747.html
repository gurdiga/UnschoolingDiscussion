<div id="ygrps-yiv-30037041">Hello List:<br/>
<br/>
I am writing from Alberta, Canada and I am new to this forum and to <br/>
home schooling. I took my children out of the formal school system <br/>
about two months ago.<br/>
<br/>
I have thought about home schooling for several years, but didn&#39;t <br/>
realize that there were so many options for home education. My <br/>
initial belief was that home schooling was basically &quot;school at home&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
In September, I attended a workshop put on by a woman who has been <br/>
unschooling her children for several years. I realized immediately <br/>
that this format was something that I could commit to and would suit <br/>
my children (especially my 12 year old son).<br/>
<br/>
Something that came up during the workshop was the notion that the <br/>
children need to go through a period of &quot;uninstitutionalizing&quot; before <br/>
they would reconnect with their natural curiosity and motivation to <br/>
learn. In this time (which my husband and I were told could last from <br/>
a couple of weeks to as long as six months) it was advised that we <br/>
not make any suggestions for the children to do specific learning. <br/>
Rather, we allow the children to develop their own interest in <br/>
whatever it is that they are drawn to. (Having read most of John <br/>
Holt&#39;s books I recognize this as his philosophy)<br/>
<br/>
What my question is: during this period of uninstitutionalizing, do I <br/>
not suggest they do any type of learning?? (ie. I do not say ... <br/>
today, you need to read for 1 hour - you pick the book, magazine, <br/>
website or whatever) Would doing this be directing their learning or <br/>
is this structure important?<br/>
<br/>
My seven year old daughter seems quite motivated to learn math right <br/>
now. She asked me for some math material that would help her practise <br/>
multiplication and division. I&#39;m going out this morning to get her a <br/>
book! My 12 year old son, on the other hand, seems quite content with <br/>
his drama, dance and singing lessons and spends a lot of time on the <br/>
computer installing and playing life simulation games. He is also <br/>
taking 2 1/2 hours/week of career technology studies (home ec. & <br/>
shop) at his former junior high school. He tells me he isn&#39;t <br/>
interested in math or science at this time.<br/>
<br/>
It would help me to calm myself, if I knew that my experience with my <br/>
kids is within the realm of what is &quot;normal&quot;.  Thank you for any <br/>
opinions and assistance you can lend me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812951210">Dear Dona,<br/>
You are definitely in the &#39;normal&#39; circle with your kids.<br/>
You asked :<br/>
&lt;What my question is: during this period of uninstitutionalizing, do I <br/>
not suggest they do any type of learning?? (ie. I do not say ... <br/>
today, you need to read for 1 hour - you pick the book, magazine, <br/>
website or whatever) Would doing this be directing their learning or <br/>
is this structure important?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>IMO I would *not* suggest any thing whatsoever! That would defeat your whole<br/>
de-schooling process. Leave them *alone* to do as they choose.  If dd is<br/>
interested in math, as you have indicated, get her the resources and let<br/>
*her* do the stuff. *you* stay out of the way unless she has questions.<br/>
I, along with lots of other folks on this list can assure you that this way<br/>
of living does, indeed work!! :-0<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-652492572">I would not say you need to read for one hour, but *suggesting* various stuff<br/>
would be great--like &quot;I heard there&#39;s a new display at the science<br/>
museum--wanna go?&quot; And then wait for yes *or* no.<br/>
<br/>
What you suggest below--requiring stuff--would not be considered unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
