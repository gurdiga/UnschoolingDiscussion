That&#39;s why I think it&#39;s amazing, and well worth participating in, that <br/>
this list and other unschooling resources and conversations clearly can and <br/>
do help some people to break free of their own indoctrination, and to realize <br/>
that the default tendency of schooling (and parenting)  is to control and <br/>
limit, not to empower and enrich.  JJ<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Controlling, a simple word for so much that it encompasses huh?  I&#39;ve been <br/>
struggling with this word all week and wondering WHY parents allow something <br/>
like a school system to control them and ultimately control their child?<br/>
<br/>
This is a very REAL question that I wish I had an answer to.  Why would <br/>
parents do something they KNOW is detrimental to their precious child just because <br/>
a school system told them to?  Are they that willing to give over the &quot;power&quot; <br/>
of parenting?  Are they afraid if the kid turns out &quot;wrong&quot; they&#39;ll have no <br/>
one but themselves to blame if they DON&#39;T do what the school tells them?  I <br/>
don&#39;t know, but it seems crazy to me that so many just without questioning do <br/>
exactly what someone inside a building (that WE as taxpayers pay for) tells them <br/>
to do regarding their children and many of them are unwavering, EVEN if they <br/>
feel it&#39;s wrong, they go ahead and do it.  WHY?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand it.  I can&#39;t even slightly grasp why someone feels people, <br/>
just people have some extra keen perception regarding THEIR children that <br/>
they cannot posses so therefore they must do what these people tell them.  Maybe <br/>
because they&#39;ve been to school to LEARN about children?  Lord have mercy, <br/>
don&#39;t you learn about your own children every moment of every day?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I just don&#39;t understand control on any level.  I&#39;ve lived it for sure, <br/>
when I was a child/young adult.  But I just don&#39;t see the need for it and why <br/>
others so willing turn it over, especially regarding their very own children.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m not going to &quot;control&quot; what my child see/does/is then why should I <br/>
allow someone else to do it?<br/>
<br/>
I think school need to be somehow reduced to what they actually are.  I think <br/>
too many people think of them as this mysterious or wondrous building were if <br/>
you and your child do everything they tell you spit out great and wondrous <br/>
human beings.  What about those that come out that they say aren&#39;t so great and <br/>
wondrous?  Hmmm... guess they had problems school couldn&#39;t FIX?<br/>
<br/>
School seems so very wrong to me, especially this week.  I do recognize that <br/>
some kids are better off in school, I was one of them.  But there are so many <br/>
bright and wonderful spirits being crushed inside those buildings and the <br/>
people in those buildings are blaming those bright and wonderful spirits and the <br/>
parents believe it is the children&#39;s fault...<br/>
<br/>
So, why would parents hand over complete control of their children to a <br/>
government agency for that many hours per day?  I&#39;m not just saying for education, <br/>
they are in COMPLETE control.<br/>

You only took your teenage daughter out of school a year or two ago, <br/>
right? And all your other kids went all the way through school.<br/>
<br/>
Shouldn&#39;t you be able to answer your own question better than most of <br/>
the rest of us?<br/>

it.<br/>
<br/>
Even if some parents think schools offer too many negatives for the<br/>
positives they return, the alternatives to school seem far worse.<br/>
<br/>
If parents believe that school methods done properly are what will provide<br/>
success for their children and the alternative is doing a poor reproduction<br/>
of school methods on their own at home, school will seem worth it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about parents giving what they&#39;re certain is the best to their kids<br/>
despite the trials and tribulations (to themselves and their kids) needed to<br/>
get it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hmmm... guess they had problems school couldn&#39;t FIX?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Or the kids didn&#39;t apply themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Or the school failed to apply it&#39;s process properly to the child.<br/>

long.<br/>
