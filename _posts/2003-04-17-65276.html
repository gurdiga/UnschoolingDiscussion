My husband has a career in music and we are planning on sharing the responsibilities of unschooling. Do any other couples both work part time or share responsibilities like this. I feel like my husband has just as much to offer them as I do and maybe more if the kids end up leaning in the creative side! Kelli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-662939040"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I may be in the minority here, but I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s a good idea <br/>
&gt;&gt;for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>public schools to cease to exist. I think while home- or unschooling might <br/>
be<br/>
good for virtually any kid, it&#39;s not necessarily right for all families.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  I don&#39;t think home/unschooling is right for every family.  I think <br/>
it&#39;s best, but unfortunately, there are parents who feel they don&#39;t have <br/>
options and , sadly, there are those who aren&#39;t interested.  I have an aunt <br/>
whose children are in ps&#39; and she loves it.  She feels like my children are <br/>
missing out on so much.  I feel like my cousins are missing out on so much, <br/>
too, though.  I also have a friend that &#39;wants&#39; to homeschool and has been <br/>
asking me all sorts of questions about unschooling.  The way she sees it, <br/>
unschooling would *fit* for her because she is so lazy.  (HER words, NOT <br/>
mine!)  Se just doesn&#39;t get it.  Another friend tried homeschooling but was <br/>
so military about it that she drove her kid away.  That child is now in ps <br/>
doing better than ever.  I don&#39;t necessarily think it is the best situation <br/>
for her, but compared to being home with her mother, it is ideal.  Sad.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;THAT said, oh, I hope schools do change, even at least a little away from <br/>
&gt;&gt;the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>extreme standardization that&#39;s happening now.  It has nothing to do with <br/>
what<br/>
kids need, and it&#39;s all political, and SO sad.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
It IS sad.  Very unfortunate.  In Texas, our ps&#39; have thrown out the TAAS <br/>
test for a much more difficult test.  Just about any teacher asked will tell <br/>
you these kids are not prepared.  The teachers have no choice other than to <br/>
teach to the test.  Recess and lunch times are being cut in half, and some <br/>
recess periods are cut completely, as are physical education classes.  It <br/>
took two years of public schools to convince me that it is the last place my <br/>
children will ever learn anything other than how to perform on a test.  Yet, <br/>
so many bright children never DO learn how to perform on a test.  Here, they <br/>
are held back a grade or grades and learn to hate school.  Hate learning.  <br/>
They are miserable and let down.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t even have to get into the other issues of ps to know how fast it <br/>
can squash any natural learning ability in a child.  The social and <br/>
interpersonal ramifications are tremendous.  I know there are people, grown <br/>
and growing that thouroughly enjoy(ed) ps. I&#39;m willing to bet they all fall <br/>
at the top of the pecking order or just lucked out and had wonderful <br/>
teachers, friends and experiences.  Though I am not stating this as fact, by <br/>
any means.<br/>
<br/>
I still believe there is hope.  But not in a public, government mandated <br/>
education.  We just keep moving further and further towards that never <br/>
happening.<br/>

<br/>
Yes!! My husband and I are both committed to being home as much as possible<br/>
with our kids (Noah, 5 1/2 and Nathan 3 1/2). With the exception of my older<br/>
son having a babysitter part-time for about 6 months (from about 9 months to<br/>
15 months - 6 of the most unpleasant months of our lives I might add!!) one<br/>
of us has always been home with the kids. At first I was working full time<br/>
and dh was home full time. Neither one of us liked this arrangement, I<br/>
wanted to be home more and he wanted to be out of the house more (without<br/>
the kids!). I now work 3 days per week, (8:30 am-4:30 pm) and dh does a few<br/>
different things - part-time home daycare, runs his own organic lawn care<br/>
business in the warmer months and does bicycle repairs. This has been a<br/>
better balance for all of us. We all seem to feel like we&#39;re connecting<br/>
enough to each other and have an opportunity to &quot;do our own thing&quot; too.<br/>
We&#39;re hoping to phase out the home daycare over the next year or so, as our<br/>
boys are getting older and it&#39;s limiting how flexible our schedule can be<br/>
(we have to pick up and drop off kindergarten kids at the school down the<br/>
block even though our kids don&#39;t go there!!) Dh is trying to find a<br/>
part-time job that will work around my schedule so we can afford to stop<br/>
doing daycare.<br/>
<br/>
[Interesting aside, the school principal asked my husband one day why she<br/>
had never seen our kids *inside* the school -obviously she had seen them<br/>
with him while picking up other kids- and when he informed her that we were<br/>
homeschooling, she said &quot;That&#39;s really great. Your kids will benefit a lot<br/>
from that!&quot; I couldn&#39;t believe it!! (Of course, he didn&#39;t say we were<br/>
*unschooling* :) ]<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you asked this question, I was wondering a lot about dads&#39;<br/>
involvement in unschooling and was thinking of posting a similar question<br/>
myself. Trying to strike a balance between work and home that meets<br/>
everyone&#39;s needs and provides an adequate income seems to be one of the<br/>
biggest challenges in our house!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-254324257">My husband and I share the responsibilities of unschooling our 9 yr old son.<br/>
Even before he was born we knew that we would figure out some way that one<br/>
of us would be at home with Matthew and that we would homeschool.(at that<br/>
time I didn&#39;t know about unschooling), that he would not attend ps. I work<br/>
f/t for my IL&#39;s in the family business, and my husband does as well,<br/>
depending on what&#39;s needed. And he is also a musician, recording engineer<br/>
and computer genius (He&#39;s also been building our new  house for the past 6<br/>
months). My husband stays home with Matthew and when that&#39;s not possible,<br/>
then Matthew is able to come to work with me. He either helps unpack stock.,<br/>
plays on my computer or sometimes he plays outside with the neighbouring<br/>
cafe&#39;s grandson. He&#39;s always welcome to come to the store or stay at home.<br/>
We feel very fortunate that our employment opportunities have worked out so<br/>
well for our family. I always knew it would be me who would work outside the<br/>
home (my dh has a rare form of md that can make it difficult to work), and<br/>
yet didn&#39;t want to be away from my son so much. This is like the best of<br/>
both worlds. And my IL&#39;s have been very supportive of us<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling in the best way we see fit. So they never mind if<br/>
he is around at the store.<br/>
