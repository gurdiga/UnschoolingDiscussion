<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186925097">Sarah&#39;s guitar arrived today (a birthday gift). She is in her room with it right now and she is SO happy- just BEAMING from ear to ear over her emerald green guitar! I&#39;m so glad I took the time to find one in her favorite color (not that it was hard, but I coulda just picked up any old thing, you know?) for her enjoyment! <br/>
   <br/>
  Mine is coming on Thursday, and I&#39;m looking forward to sharing this learning to play the guitar process with Sarah! Logan is now saying he wants one, so I&#39;ll look for one for him - his birthday is next month! (I&#39;d been planning on drums for him)<br/>
