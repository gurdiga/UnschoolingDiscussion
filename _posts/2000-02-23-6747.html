<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203767520">I lurk here :-) I&#39;m a SAHM of one dd, 16 m/o. I think unschooling is the<br/>
natural extension of the kind of parenting I&#39;m already doing. It makes<br/>
no sense to me to trust her (and my) instincts for years and then, at an<br/>
arbitrary age, tell her those instincts are no longer valid. Anyway, my<br/>
point of posting was just to share what happened today. <br/>
<br/>
We were out in the driveway and dd was carrying around a small watering<br/>
can. I put some water in it for her and she dumped it out the top. She<br/>
handed it back to me and I put more water in and said &quot;here honey, let<br/>
me show you how it works&quot; and proceeded to pour water out the spout<br/>
while she watched. I handed it back to her and she dumped it out the top<br/>
again. I had the good sense to butt out at that point  :-) Instead of<br/>
continuing to try to &quot;teach&quot; her the &quot;right way&quot; to do it, I just kept<br/>
filling it with water for her every time she handed it back to me. Over<br/>
and over she kept dumping it out the top.<br/>
<br/>
Then, I handed it back and she went to turn it upside down and the water<br/>
came out the spout! She stared at it as if she&#39;d never seen this before.<br/>
She was captivated and for most of the rest of the time we were out<br/>
there (almost an hour!) she poured the water out of the spout. <br/>
<br/>
It just drove home the truth of what I already knew. I tried to &quot;teach&quot;<br/>
her something and it did not register at all. But she discovers it for<br/>
herself and it&#39;s a world of difference! It&#39;s just so hard not to be a<br/>
&quot;teacher&quot; sometimes. To sit back and not show her the &quot;right way&quot; to<br/>
stack the blocks, but to let her play with them as she will. I guess<br/>
this is me de-schooling 8-)<br/>

I thought your description of your 16 month old and your realizations<br/>
about her were wonderful.  Thank you for sharing your story.  Aren&#39;t<br/>
toddlers (difficult, but) amazing?!  There is so much to learn FROM<br/>
them...<br/>
