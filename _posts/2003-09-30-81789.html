Well!<br/>
I agree.<br/>
But because these books are so popular with Christian homeschooling families, <br/>
it did occur to me how that kind of statement would be taken on a list <br/>
focussed on &quot;Christian values.&quot;  They would be swift to tell you not only how <br/>
and <br/>
why to read the books, but which reactions were acceptable in the children <br/>
who <br/>
heard them.<br/>

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br/>
<br/>
This summer our family joined the local homeschooling group. Both kids have <br/>
been clamoring to meet other homeschooled kids. The kids on our block are <br/>
either older than Moly, or younger than Jack. Not that that is a bad thing, but <br/>
neither have much in common with the kids in our neighborhood. I tried to explain <br/>
that meeting the homeschooled kids in our area wouldn&#39;t have much impact as <br/>
their parents generally do school-at-home and therefore would not have the same <br/>
freedom to play at will as Moly and Jack do. We joined anyway, the kids were <br/>
happy, for about five minutes. <br/>
<br/>
First we went to a picnic. Moly struck up a conversation with some girls. One <br/>
said to Moly; &quot;I wish I could dress like you.&quot; That confused Moly. A little <br/>
boy said to Jack; &quot;You can&#39;t wear Sponge Bob t-shirts.&quot; Jack wanted to know why <br/>
and was told matter of factly that he would go straight to hell. Jack found <br/>
that funny, I did not. Moly asked the girl why she wanted to dress like her, <br/>
and said she thought the dress the girl was wearing was very pretty. The girl <br/>
said; &quot;You wouldn&#39;t think so if you were me.&quot; and pointed out her four sisters, <br/>
all in the same style dress, all in the same colors. Three girls had dark blue <br/>
stripes with smaller white stripes, and two had large white stripes with <br/>
small dark blue stripes, all had either blue or white sashes. All had the same <br/>
long, straight hair, and all had the same shoes. Moly asked the girl why she <br/>
didn&#39;t just put on jeans and a t-shirt, and the girl said she only had one pair of <br/>
jeans and a blouse, and she only wore those to work in the garden or to feed <br/>
and care for her rabbits. :o(<br/>
<br/>
The discussion between Moly and this girl turned to what curriculum did <br/>
Moly&#39;s mom use to teach her. (Moly had to have the word curriculum explained to <br/>
her.) And the girl was horrified to hear that Moly&#39;s mom used no such thing. I <br/>
think she was more shocked that public schooled kids are when they hear that. I <br/>
think public schooled kids, as institutionalized as they are, can at least <br/>
accept that there are some parents in the world who do what they dream of. Then <br/>
the girl wanted to know how Moly (if her mom didn&#39;t use a curriculum) learned <br/>
about how God wants her to live her life. Moly just shrugged her shoulders and <br/>
said that God wants her to be happy no matter what she does. <br/>
<br/>
Moly didn&#39;t understand the intricacies of the conversation and how to read <br/>
between the lines of what the girl was saying to her. OTOH, the girl couldn&#39;t <br/>
grasp what Moly was saying either. She had no concept of freedom or even wanting <br/>
to do something and actually doing it. No free thinking. No rights. Ever.<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward to a parent meeting. Guest speakers giving a talk on how to keep <br/>
the &quot;Marriage Spark Alive&quot; As a couple or marriage must come first, we have <br/>
to provide a strong front to the kids. All this talk of child centered lives is <br/>
detrimental to a marriage, and to the children as well. If they don&#39;t see us <br/>
as a united front then they will run right over us. They are children to be <br/>
trained up properly in the way God has prescribed to us. Discussion afterward <br/>
and Darin stood up and said &quot;lets go, NOW!&quot; We went home. I unsubscribed from <br/>
the groups email lists. Two days later we got an email from one of the leaders <br/>
stating she was sad to see we had unsubscribed, and was our intention to not <br/>
participate in the group anymore, and if so how could she help. I wasn&#39;t going <br/>
to write back, but Darin did. He wrote, &quot;We are not at war with our children.&quot; <br/>
I think that answered their questions. <br/>

#############################<br/>
<br/>
There is an eclectic, secular group in Kansas City, and over the past few <br/>
months we have discovered three other unschooling families, and one almost <br/>
unschooling family all with in an hours drive or so. Not convenient for just getting <br/>
together to play any old time, but enough that if we all plan, we can get <br/>
together every few weeks or so. Not enough for my kids taste, but better than <br/>
before. <br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is that there is a difference between people who homeschool, <br/>
Christian or not, and Christian Homeschoolers. The families I know that are <br/>
Christian and homeschoolers are vastly different from the families who are <br/>
homeschoolers because they are Christian. It is very much an us/them ideology. <br/>
They (Christian Homeschoolers) believe that they started the movement. I won&#39;t <br/>
argue the semantics of who started what when and why with them. Both camps <br/>
evolved around the same time. Honestly though the people who started the Christian <br/>
Homeschooling Movement wouldn&#39;t be where they are today without those who came <br/>
before us. They won&#39;t admit it, but it is there. <br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t know about the Christian Homeschool movement, I strongly suggest <br/>
learning about it. If you live in the Bible Belt, and are a homeschooler, you <br/>
learn to deal with it. If you live in a more progressive, less conservative <br/>
area of the country and aren&#39;t exposed to the Christian Homeschoolers ways, <br/>
then hearing about it is shocking. <br/>
<br/>
I see the jumper-wearing, long hair, meek minded female child/wife around <br/>
here all the time. I know several families that have chaperones for their <br/>
females. If Dad can&#39;t do it, then an older son or a brother of Mom or Dad will <br/>
accompany the females and younger boys out to the store or other places. Darin sees <br/>
families in his store all the time like this and likes to call me during the <br/>
day to tell me a &quot;Wife&quot; was just in. He calls them this because usually the <br/>
family will be in to buy something and after a discussion, sometimes a prayer, <br/>
the father will say things like; &quot;Okay Wife, we will get XYZ.&quot; or &quot;Wife, write <br/>
the man a check.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Shocking? Yes. Out there? Yes. True? Yes. Do you need to be aware of it? A <br/>
resounding YES. <br/>

<br/>
That caused me an audible whimper on intake of breath.   <br/>
It was quiet, but it was scary, because in the story that far, I had been <br/>
identifying with the girls who was told how to dress and to fear hell.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She had no concept of freedom or even wanting <br/>
to do something and actually doing it. No free thinking. No rights. Ever.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you told that story.  There are lots of people who have never been <br/>
around such families.  Those families aren&#39;t rare, either, they just don&#39;t mix. <br/>
 There are lots of homeschoolers who seem to consider them of some other <br/>
place, some other era.  But they&#39;re of October 2003, and won&#39;t go away anytime <br/>
soon.<br/>
<br/>
As much time as unschooling dads spend with their kids, those dads spend on <br/>
political activism designed to do things which would NOT benefit our children <br/>
in any way.<br/>
