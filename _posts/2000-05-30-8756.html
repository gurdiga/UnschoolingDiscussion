<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973623861">Hi Karin!! <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I did go, and Kelly pointed you out to me! I tried several times to speak to you, but one or the other of us kept getting side-tracked! I had (well, have LOL) long brown hair, a curly-headed baby in a peach sling, and the big hubby with longish black hair. Plus the two boys who were into every activity possible! &lt;g&gt; I usually was towards the back of the room so I could leave if the baby got loud. <br/>
<br/>
Darn, I hated missing the talent show! We ended up having to squeeze into my dad&#39;s pickup, and the lights don&#39;t work on it so we had to head home before dark each night. :-(<br/>

  Hi Myranda,<br/>
  Just catching up with all these e-mails after the conference and I just have<br/>
  to ask - so you DID go to the conference Myranda? I don&#39;t remember meeting<br/>
  you or even seeing your name tag - and I was hoping I would. Darn. Anything<br/>
  that might stand out that you can tell me about you or your family to let me<br/>
  know that was you?<br/>
<br/>
  Marji, remember me? The tall, slim one with straight brown hair (hanging<br/>
  around Mary/zenmomma?)<br/>
  BTW, I just loved your talent show performance. You have a very nice voice<br/>
  and can play the guitar well, and the song you chose was so pretty and<br/>
  brought up heartfelt emotion.<br/>
<br/>
  It was great meeting ya&#39;ll &lt;g&gt; there and all the others too.<br/>
  I&#39;ll always have fond memories....... :o)<br/>

Doesn&#39;t ring any bells - I must&#39;ve seen you at some point but just didn&#39;t<br/>
*see* you. :-)<br/>
Being at the back of the room poised for an easy exit probably did mean I<br/>
was less likely to see you. Being there without my boys, I took full<br/>
advantage of that and sat in close proximity to the front whenever possible.<br/>
A REAL luxury.<br/>

Anyway, if you&#39;d still like to hear Marji sing, I&#39;ve heard that she has some<br/>
CD&#39;s out. From what I&#39;ve heard so far, I&#39;m sure they&#39;re good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey Karin!!  Of course I remember you!!!  I&#39;m really glad you enjoyed the <br/>
tune I played.  There was a lot of talent there that night and I enjoyed <br/>
everyone&#39;s performance.  That magician who emceed the show was great but <br/>
you could tell he was used to doing school programs, right?  I just loved <br/>
meeting you and Mary and while I&#39;m grateful for our virtual community, now <br/>
what I crave is a real flesh-and-blood community of us unschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
I sure miss seeing everyone, and I know Liam is missing all that playing he <br/>
was getting to do!  You remember Liam, right?  He was the one with no <br/>
shoes, the big smile, and the constant running and zipping around.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
<br/>
Marji<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-920934435">Thank you Myranda go ahead. That may help. They are probably gone for<br/>
good though. Fro reference I left monday between 8-8:30am<br/>
    Karin you&#39;re probably right and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been thinking too. I<br/>
was distacted and concentrating on my ds and he&#39;s what really matters. We<br/>
don&#39;t think Jonathan broke his finger but he&#39;ll lose his nail. It also take<br/>
a very long time to all heal and grow back. BTDT.<br/>

    My youngest didn&#39;t mind too much when I told him I left it behind. He<br/>
was just thrilled to have me back home. :-) Now that was a good feeling.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the list of items that were there.<br/>
Mathematics, A Human Endeavor by Harold Jacobs w/Instructor&#39;s Manual<br/>
The Adventures of Penrose the Mathmatical Cat by Theoni Pappas<br/>
Yummy Chocolate Bugs Curiosity Kit<br/>
Bears&#39; Guide to Earning College Degrees Nontraditionally<br/>
The RAT something book. It was a new one.<br/>
Oh course there was a FUN Books catalog<br/>
<br/>
Billy if you are reading. What was the name? Will you please send me another<br/>
catalog. I need to start saving my pennys again. :-(<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the replies and helpfulness. We really enjoyed ourselves and both<br/>
of use were very sad it had to end. Thank you so much to the Lovejoys for<br/>
taking the risk and going for it. :-)<br/>

imagine one of the homeschoolers not trying to find the owner of the <br/>
books. Check back with the hotel periodically and keep your fingers <br/>
crossed that someone finds them and returns them.<br/>

If they don&#39;t turn up, let us know and we can work out a special <br/>
discount for you. Not as nice as getting the books returned but you <br/>
won&#39;t have to save quite so many pennies. Also, let us know if you <br/>

neighborhood) and it is getting pricey.<br/>
It&#39;s been ages since we went on anything other than a hiking/camping vacation <br/>
and I&#39;m just wondering if combining this conference with a mini-vacation is <br/>
in a typical price range, having never been to a home/unschooling conference <br/>
before!<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324483036">It is pretty typical - but, if anything, is a lower-than-usual-priced <br/>
conference. Especially true since it is in a pretty expensive area of <br/>
the country.<br/>

<br/>
It seems high all by itself that way, but I think if you go and look at the <br/>
price of a curriculum for one year for one child and remember that this <br/>
conference could easily save your from ever considering buying one per year per <br/>
child, it might seem a good deal after all.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know any curriculum prices off the tops of your heads?  I know we <br/>
could google, but what do they run per child?  Oak Meadow?  ABeka?  Sonlight?  <br/>
Calvert?  Seton?  Signing up with Clonlara?<br/>
<br/>
Any of those less than $200?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Someone on a local group just listed Calvert *with teacher aid* as $900 per<br/>
child. So, that *sure* puts it in perspective!<br/>
<br/>
We were just in Boston in December, and I would *highly* recommend seeing<br/>
some of the sights in the area if you can. We really loved our time at<br/>
Plimoth Plantation and the Children&#39;s Museum--those alone are worth the<br/>
time. The Freedom Trail was okay--the Revere house was not really worth the<br/>
walk thru, imo. We also did the Salem Witch Museum, and that was pretty<br/>
lame, though just walking around their gift shop and open museum (not the<br/>
actual show) was worth a stop.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already registered just for me, and I&#39;m *really* looking forward to it.<br/>
I still don&#39;t know if the family will be coming or not, but they&#39;d be<br/>
hanging by the pool if they did. That saved us the big family<br/>
registration--kids are little (6, 5 and 3) and dh is NOT interested.<br/>
(rolling my eyes here at dh!) I&#39;m trying to talk one of my local unschoolers<br/>
into accompanying me. If she does, then we&#39;ll probably just go by ourselves<br/>
and split the hotel room. Just some ways to cut corners....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055378182">My dh and I are both dyslexic, as well as our 10 y/o son. <br/>
<br/>
If you are considering having your child tested, *please* be aware <br/>
that most people who test for learning disabilities are NOT qualified <br/>
to test for dyslexia. (they won&#39;t tell you that, of course ;)  <br/>
<br/>
If your state requires any kind of yearly testing, it may be <br/>
advantageous to have your child tested for dyslexia, especially if <br/>
the state provides accomodations. There was a report just issued (in <br/>
January, if I remember correctly) that showed dyslexic students who <br/>
were provided accomodations for testing scored a whopping 40% higher <br/>
on the tests than the group of students who were given no <br/>
accomodations. <br/>
<br/>
As far as whether or not your child will feel &quot;labeled&quot; with a <br/>
diagnosis is for you to decide. My son was *very* aware that he saw <br/>
things and learned things different from all of his friends. We <br/>
decided to be very open with him, and he says that he feels better <br/>
about himself now. He said that before, when he knew he was different <br/>
but didn&#39;t know why, he thought something was &quot;wrong&quot; with him. Now <br/>
he understands that he sees things differently than his friends do, <br/>
and vice versa. It also helped him to know that he has quite a few <br/>
family members who are dyslexic, and there are more than a few famous <br/>
people who are. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re interested, you can go to www.BrightSolutions.US which is a <br/>
wonderful website on dyslexia. It has lots of information, which is <br/>
especially helpful for those who think that dyslexia is limited to <br/>
letter reversal (it&#39;s not). They can also give you a list of <br/>
certified dyslexia testers in your area, and they have several free <br/>
videos on dyslexia that you can get.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, word retrieval difficulty is called dysnomia, and it is a common <br/>
trait of dyslexics. <br/>
