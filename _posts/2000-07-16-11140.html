as long as they know that we don&#39;t really think that way, it is taken just <br/>

&gt;Just a thought:  maybe we women shouldn&#39;t be doing the things we have<br/>
&gt;complained about men doing for years? We have fought against sexual<br/>
&gt;stereotyping, sexist jokes etc for decades (well, some of us oldies have <br/>
&gt;&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
&gt;and now, somehow, it&#39;s seems like it&#39;s insensitive for men to tell <br/>
&gt;anti-women<br/>
&gt;jokes, but okay for women to tell anti-men jokes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Trouble is, my first reaction was to laugh! Hmmmm. So much for ideals :-(<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to see that from a &quot;mans&quot; point of view this is general <br/>
&quot;chit chat&quot;.  A better understanding of how women communicate would help.  <br/>
That&#39;s how topics get started.  Anyway isn&#39;t unschooling about life and <br/>
living and what&#39;s going on... Or is there a definition of unschooling that <br/>
I&#39;m missing out on.  So you could say well there are men on this list as <br/>
well.... Certainly don&#39;t see many of them starting topics, asking too many <br/>
questions that pertain to &quot;unschooling&quot;.  If I want something to go in a <br/>
specific direction then I have to make it so, rather than blaming others for <br/>
what &quot;it&quot; is not.  It seems (unless I&#39;m mistaken) that the majority of people <br/>
that are posting on this list are women.  So Charles, get with the program, <br/>
if you don&#39;t like what you see change it... of course you could always take <br/>
the easy way out and unsubscribe....Would that be acting like a man?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210085621">I&#39;m not Carol, but I&#39;ll respond anyway. IMHO, chit chat refers to idle<br/>
nonsence, such as the weather. General chat refers to open subject<br/>
discussions. I do agree that unschooling is life and can therefore be<br/>
concidered all encompassing. On the other hand, I can see why some jokes may<br/>
be seen as offensive. Of course, even if people are offended making general<br/>
slams back is immature. I for one, do not concider myself to be nothing more<br/>
than life support to a vagina, nor do I appreciate someone writing these<br/>
things that children can read. As a mom of 3 girls I don&#39;t want them exposed<br/>
to such remarks. Now let&#39;s move on here...please.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-906391155">Maybe it&#39;s just a cultural difference, but &#39;general chat list&#39; sort of implies to<br/>
me, a list that has no focus, a place where you can talk about all subjects.<br/>
&#39;chit chat&#39;, to my New Zealand mind, implies the sort of women&#39;s conversations<br/>
that men stereotype as women&#39;s trivial , unimportant, shallow coffee-and cupcakes<br/>
gossip. The sort of derogatory term many feminists object to as sexist when used<br/>
by men.<br/>
<br/>
Like I say, maybe it&#39;s a cultural difference in word usage. If so I&#39;m sorry.<br/>
<br/>
I still think &#39;ist&#39; jokes are the sort of thing that should only be told, if at<br/>
all, among friends who know each other really well, or they are almost always<br/>
going to cause offence to someone.<br/>

<br/>
If you don&#39;t care for &quot;jokes that exploit an entire race&quot; then you&#39;re<br/>
entitled to your opinion. I&#39;m not going to say you are wrong. After all,<br/>
it&#39;s *your* opinion. I don&#39;t want to argue here. I really do want you to<br/>
sincerely understand that. <br/>
<br/>
 I just know that in my family, we&#39;re a combination of French and Italian.<br/>
One of the most amusing times was to hear my Italian dad and my French<br/>
uncle trade French and Italian jokes back and forth. I grew up not being<br/>
ashamed of my nationality and also I don&#39;t take offense when a joke is told<br/>
about my nationality. Looking back on my childhood, I used to enjoy a<br/>
comedian named Pat Cooper. He&#39;s Italian and Catholic and told the best<br/>
jokes about his family that, should you choose to be insulted, you could<br/>
take the wrong way. Being a Catholic Italian, I thought they were funny. <br/>
<br/>
I find off-color jokes much more offensive. But, since this is a big list<br/>
of diverse people, not a closed list of few folks who know each other, it&#39;s<br/>
hard to determine who will find something funny and who will be insulted.<br/>
But, there&#39;s still the power of the &quot;delete&quot; button. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077094837">I have passed up a few of these posts, but I am feeling the need to respond. <br/>
Yes, your Italian relatives tell Italian jokes, and have a good time with <br/>
it. That is great.<br/>
<br/>
Many times I have noticed that members of a group will say things to each <br/>
other that would not be acceptable if said by someone who is not a member. <br/>
Many comedians who tell these kinds of jokes are telling then about <br/>
themselves, so it falls under laughing at yourself instead of ridiculing <br/>
someone else.<br/>
<br/>
It is much the same as the &quot;rules of friendship&quot; that I have found work <br/>
pretty well. If you say that your kid is a brat, I can agree with you that <br/>
he is quite wound up today, but I would never tell you that he is rotten. I <br/>
may complain about my father being a pain, but if someone else criticizes <br/>
him, I get defensive.<br/>
<br/>
At the very least, I think that if someone is offended by a joke they should <br/>
be able to say so without being attacked, but apologized to-and on a list, <br/>
where we really do not know people all that well it is inappropriate to post <br/>
things that may be offensive to some of the members.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the &quot;general chat&quot; comment, I find that to be very true of this <br/>
list. I am not complaining or berating anyone for that-I have a delete key <br/>
and I know how to use it, but this list does have few posts to do with hs in <br/>
relation to how many there are on toddlers and food and house cleaning <br/>
lately. Considering that there are 385 members of this list, and the few who <br/>
are active posters, I bet there are many out there making good use of that <br/>
delete key.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232374316">i&#39;m not saying you&#39;re immature at all! Charle&#39;s response was in response to<br/>
what someone else said about a joke that was sent out last week. Perhaps<br/>
part of the problem is that we get so far ahead of ourselves (we in the<br/>
general form) that we forget what we we&#39;re talking about in the first place.<br/>
When I made the comment about moving along I made it to the list. Last month<br/>
several topics got way out of hand. There were a lot of hurt feelings and a<br/>
lot of people who left the list. I was just trying to stop this from<br/>
happening again. Please accept my appologies if you thought I was attacking<br/>
you. I wasn&#39;t. I happen to enjoy reading you&#39;re posts quite a bit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636291292">Hey guys -- cut it out!<br/>
<br/>
I would just delete all of you, but there is another thread I am reading <br/>
called Definitions and it is really good.  All about identifiying kids for <br/>
g/t programs and how some school distrcts are interfacing with and reaching <br/>
out to hsers.<br/>
<br/>
That one I am actually learning something from.<br/>
<br/>
If I delete all the emails called Definitions I will lose that thread.  <br/>
<br/>
Time to move on -- my vote!  (You didn&#39;t even know I got a vote, did ya?!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What does anyone here know about this &quot;reaching out&quot; of the school districts <br/>
to hsers.  Obviously, they are getting their $$ back if I bring my kid back <br/>
but I am looking at one now (Wichita) that looks like they are actually <br/>
trying to be relatively hands off.<br/>
<br/>
Any personal experiences with any of these blended programs?<br/>

Do you know of any lists where unschooling is discussed?  Can you please<br/>
send the url&#39;s?<br/>

I joined this list to learn something about unschooling, a concept that is<br/>
fairly new to me.  I do not feel I can direct the conversation that way (as<br/>

You might want to try going to egroups or topica and doing a search for<br/>
other elists. I have to warn you though, I&#39;m on 8 lists and not very many of<br/>
them stay on topic all of the time. I think this especially true of people<br/>
of the unschooling mind set. As someone else already pointed out,<br/>
unschooling is an all encopassing thing , so pretty much anything can be<br/>
thought of as an unschooling topic. You might want to try a hsing (instead<br/>
of unschooling) list. But, you&#39;ll prob. find some &quot;OT&quot; conversations there<br/>
too.<br/>

Thank you for clarifying Amy and the apologies... As you say it&#39;s quite easy <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just a thought:  maybe we women shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; doing the things we have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; complained about men doing for years? We have<br/>
&gt; fought against sexual<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stereotyping, sexist jokes etc for decades<br/>
&gt; (well, some of us oldies have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and now, somehow, it&#39;s seems like it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; insensitive for men to tell<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anti-women<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; jokes, but okay for women to tell anti-men<br/>
&gt; jokes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Trouble is, my first reaction was to laugh!<br/>
&gt; Hmmmm. So much for ideals<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and now, somehow, it&#39;s seems like it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; insensitive for men to tell<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anti-women<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jokes, but okay for women to tell anti-men<br/>
&gt; &gt; jokes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Trouble is, my first reaction was to laugh!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hmmmm. So much for ideals<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316364047">Not a list but Try the message boards at unschooling.com. They still get off<br/>
topic, but you get to chose the threads you read.<br/>
<br/>
Although, personally, I don&#39;t find anything off topic, except maybe personal<br/>
exchanges that are incomprehensible to anyone else, which only happen very<br/>
occassionally. Unschooling is our life, and I feel that my kids have learnt so<br/>
much about so many things because we don&#39;t insist they resrict their learning<br/>
to traditional subjects. My boys have learnt about breastfeeding, and<br/>
nutrition, and about gardening and about what humour constitutes. All these<br/>
things are, IMO, just as important for them to learn about as maths and latin<br/>
and geography, and probably more so. That being the case, I don&#39;t find such<br/>
topics &#39;off topic&#39; here. I can understand that to new people it may seem that<br/>
way, but to us oldies who have immersed ourselves in these concepts for years,<br/>
everything that is part of life, is part of unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433936674">If you go back and look at how the person that objected to the definitions<br/>
expressed that person&#39;s displeasure, I would think that it does not fall<br/>
under the &quot;they should be able to say so without being attacked, but<br/>
apologized to&quot; category.  If that person had responded that they were<br/>
offended by it, etc., they would have gotten an &quot;Oops, sorry that offended<br/>
you and no it wasn&#39;t meant as male bashing as a male was who I got it<br/>
from.&quot;<br/>

sorry if I offended anyone else by responding in kind.<br/>
