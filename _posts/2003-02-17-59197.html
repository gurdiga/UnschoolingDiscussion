<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395955623">Give them lots of opportunities to draw and paint.  If you can afford <br/>
it, maybe let her pick out a fun new art supply somewhere like <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.crayola.com/store/.">http://www.crayola.com/store/.</a>  Keep giving your daughter access to <br/>
books she enjoys and movies she watches.  <br/>
<br/>
Live your life to the fullest, pretending that you&#39;ve never heard of <br/>
a concept called school. <br/>

you mean ranslating it into educationese for mandated state reporting? Or <br/>
are you asking how your kids interests fit into an unschooling life?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
What I would do is get one more thing about Henry V (not lots, just one).<br/>
I&#39;d buy more Redwall books, and maybe e-mail the kid a site or two with <br/>
information about the author or the books.   And I would be on the lookout <br/>
for art supplies and ideas to bring home, but not overwhelming, just little <br/>
gifts once in a while.<br/>

The PBS cartoon of Redwall includes little interview segments with the<br/>
author Brian Jacques at the ends of the episodes.<br/>
