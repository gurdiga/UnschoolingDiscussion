&gt;   Leading Doctors&#39; Group <br/>
&gt;   Votes To Oppose <br/>
&gt;   Mandatory Vaccinations<br/>

 <br/>
&gt;           A leading national physician organization is calling for a<br/>
&gt; moratorium on all government mandated vaccines and has passed a<br/>
&gt; resolution to that end at their annual meeting. <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           Members of the Association of American Physicians and<br/>
&gt; Surgeons (AAPS) voted this week at their 57th Annual Meeting in St.<br/>
&gt; Louis to pass a resolution calling for an end to mandatory childhood<br/>
&gt; vaccines. The resolution passed without a single &quot;no&quot; vote.<br/>
&gt; (Resolution and mandatory vaccine fact sheet posted at<br/>
&gt; www.aapsonline.org) <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           &quot;Our children face the possibility of death or serious<br/>
&gt; long-term adverse effects from mandated vaccines that aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; necessary or that have very limited benefits,&quot; said Jane M. Orient,<br/>
&gt; MD, AAPS Executive Director. <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           &quot;This is not a vote against vaccines,&quot; said Dr. Orient.<br/>
&gt; &quot;This resolution only attempts to halt blanket vaccine mandates by<br/>
&gt; government agencies and school districts that give no consideration<br/>
&gt; for the rights of the parents or the individual medical condition of<br/>
&gt; the child.&quot; <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           Forty-two states have mandatory vaccine policies, and many<br/>
&gt; children are required to have 22 shots before first grade. On top of<br/>
&gt; that, as a condition for school attendance, many school districts<br/>
&gt; require vaccination for diseases such as hepatitis B -- primarily an<br/>
&gt; adult disease, usually spread by multiple sex partners, drug abuse or<br/>
&gt; an occupation with exposure to blood. <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           And yet, children under the age of 14 are three times more<br/>
&gt; likely to suffer adverse effects -- including death -- following the<br/>
&gt; hepatitis b vaccine than to catch the disease itself. <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           Just last week, students in Utica, NY were sent home from<br/>
&gt; school, and told they could not return until they had been forced to<br/>
&gt; receive hep B vaccinations. Further, parents were threatened by Child<br/>
&gt; Protective Services with possible seizure of their children based on<br/>
&gt; &quot;education neglect.&quot; <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           &quot;It&#39;s obscene to threaten to seize a child just because his<br/>
&gt; parents refuse medical treatment that is obviously unnecessary and<br/>
&gt; perhaps even dangerous,&quot; said Dr. Orient. &quot;AAPS believes that<br/>
&gt; parents, with the advice of their doctors, should make decisions<br/>
&gt; about their children&#39;s medical care -- not government bureaucrats.<br/>
&gt; This Resolution affirms that position.&quot; <br/>

&gt;           AAPS RESOLUTION CONCERNING MANDATORY VACCINES <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           &quot;Ethical Medicine&quot; AAPS Annual Meeting October 25 - 28,<br/>
&gt; 2000 St. Louis, MO Submitted for Member approval: <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           WHEREAS: The statement of Patients&#39; Freedoms adopted by the<br/>
&gt; Assembly at the 47th annual meeting of AAPS in 1990 provides that<br/>
&gt; &quot;Patients have the freedom to refuse medical treatment even if it is<br/>
&gt; recommended by their physician and to be informed about their medical<br/>
&gt; condition, the risks and benefits of treatment, and appropriate<br/>
&gt; alternatives&quot;; and <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           WHEREAS: There are increasing numbers of mandatory<br/>
&gt; childhood vaccines, to which children are often subjected without<br/>
&gt; meaningful informed consent, including information about potential<br/>
&gt; adverse side effects; and <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           WHEREAS: Parents who exercise their freedom to refuse one<br/>
&gt; or more vaccines may be subjected to penalties ranging from<br/>
&gt; deprivation of the right to enroll their child in school, to threats<br/>
&gt; of removing the child from parental custody and forcible vaccination;<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           WHEREAS: Safety testing of many vaccines is limited and the<br/>
&gt; data are unavailable for independent scrutiny, so that mass<br/>
&gt; vaccination is equivalent to human experimentation and subject to the<br/>
&gt; Nuremberg Code, which requires voluntary informed consent; and <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           WHEREAS: The process of approving and &quot;recommending&quot;<br/>
&gt; vaccines is tainted with conflicts of interest; <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED: That AAPS calls for a moratorium<br/>
&gt; on vaccine mandates and for physicians to insist upon truly informed<br/>
&gt; consent for the use of vaccines. <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           -------------- FACT SHEET ON MANDATORY VACCINES <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           AAPS does not oppose vaccines. AAPS has never taken an<br/>
&gt; anti-vaccine position, although opponents have tried to paint that<br/>
&gt; picture. AAPS has only attempted to halt government or school<br/>
&gt; districts from blanket vaccine mandates that violate parental<br/>
&gt; informed consent. <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           42 states have mandatory vaccine policies, and many<br/>
&gt; children are required 22 shots by first grade. <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           According to government statistics, children under the age<br/>
&gt; of 14 are three times more likely to suffer adverse effects --<br/>
&gt; including death -- following the hepatitis B vaccine than to catch<br/>
&gt; the disease itself. <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           The Centers for Disease Control admits that the reported<br/>
&gt; number of adverse effects of vaccines is probably only 10% of actual<br/>
&gt; adverse effects. <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           The Physician&#39;s Desk Reference cites adverse reactions to<br/>
&gt; the hepatitis B in less than 1 percent. However, if more than 70<br/>
&gt; million American children receive the vaccine, that means more than<br/>
&gt; 700,000 children are likely to suffer adverse reactions. <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           Children are a very low risk group for hepatitis B. Primary<br/>
&gt; risk factors are dependent on lifestyle, i.e. multiple sex partners,<br/>
&gt; drug abuse or an occupation with exposure to blood. <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           Rampant conflicts of interest in the approval process has<br/>
&gt; been the subject of several Congressional hearings, and a recent<br/>
&gt; Congressional report concluded that the pharmaceutical industry has<br/>
&gt; indeed exerted undue influence on mandatory vaccine legislation<br/>
&gt; toward its own financial interests. <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           The vaccine approval process has also been contaminated by<br/>
&gt; flawed or incomplete clinical trials, and government officials have<br/>
&gt; chosen to ignore negative results. For example, the CDC was forced to<br/>
&gt; withdraw its recommendation of the rotavirus vaccine within one year<br/>
&gt; of approval. Yet public documents obtained by AAPS show that the CDC<br/>
&gt; was aware of alarmingly high intussuception rates months before the<br/>
&gt; vaccine was approved and recommended. <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           Mandatory vaccines violate the medical ethic of informed<br/>
&gt; consent. A case could also be made that mandates for vaccines by<br/>
&gt; school districts and legislatures is the de facto practice of<br/>
&gt; medicine without a license. <br/>
&gt;            <br/>
&gt;           The CDC&#39;s own &quot;Guide to Contraindications to Childhood<br/>
&gt; Vaccination&quot; warns that when assessing children&#39;s common symptoms,<br/>
&gt; &quot;if any one of them is a contraindication, DO NOT VACCINATE&quot; [caps<br/>
&gt; added]. And yet, under legislated mandates, the vaccines are still<br/>
&gt; required. </span></blockquote></div>
