I don&#39;t have any specific help for identifying the cause of the reaction,<br/>
other than what&#39;s been already suggested by others. But I do have a great<br/>
salve idea to soothe his bottom. This was suggested to me by a pediatrician<br/>
when ds was little and had reactions to medications. Mix zinc oxide powder<br/>
with liquid Maalox until it makes a paste and apply to the skin. There is<br/>
something about the neutralizing effect of the Maalox that works well. You<br/>
can get the zinc oxide powder from a pharmacy; you  usually have to ask for<br/>
a small container of it from the pharmacist.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am desperate here!  My 1yr old is having a reaction to <br/>
&gt;something............big red baboon butt....anyone know what I can do to <br/>
&gt;reverse the reaction....he is miserable.....I have tried a bath (he just <br/>
&gt;screams).  He has beem diaperless all day, but still not better.  I have <br/>
&gt;given him Tylenol for the pain but I was wondering if there was something <br/>
&gt;else to try....anyone with allergy hints....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I thought it came from my eating spagetti sauce last night, (still nursing) <br/>
&gt;but now I  am wondering if it is not something else in addition to that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;HELP, ANYONE!<br/>
