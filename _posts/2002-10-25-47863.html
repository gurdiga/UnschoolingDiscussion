<br/>
&gt; I am new to this list.  I have been unschooling my 3<br/>
&gt; girls ages 14,12 and 10 for 4 years.  I let them lead<br/>
&gt; the way most times but sometimes I introduce things to<br/>
&gt; them.   None of them are anywhere near their public<br/>
&gt; school counterparts in math and some other subjects<br/>
&gt; like spelling.  My oldest dd wants to go to the<br/>
&gt; military and college for the medical field, My<br/>
&gt; question is this,how do I make sure that she can<br/>
&gt; achieve what she so much wants to achieve while<br/>
&gt; unschooling? I am feeling the time crunch as she is 14<br/>
&gt; now and I don&#39;t want to mess things up for her or her<br/>
&gt; sisters, whatever they might choose.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
At 14 with some manner of time constraint (I assume there&#39;s a general age<br/>
range where she can join the military and achieve her goal) I&#39;d be helping<br/>
her to research exactly what the requirements are for what she wants to do.<br/>
I would make sure she understood what the requirements were, and that she<br/>
also understood that I was completely ready to help her with materials,<br/>
resources, car rides, the checkbook, help with the book work if needed, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Then I would leave it up to her to come up with the motivation.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, people (even 14 year olds :) will say, &quot;I want to do...&quot; and then<br/>
don&#39;t actually have enough motivation to follow through. This is a signal to<br/>
me that their drive is not really for that goal. And that&#39;s okay. I&#39;d like<br/>
to be lots of things, but I only have enough time and motivation and skill<br/>
for some of them, and learning to sort out what she REALLY wants, and<br/>
learning that the motivational buck stops with her, is as important as any<br/>
other skill in life.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is something I&#39;m working through with Lars.  Last spring (ironically it<br/>
was just about the time *I* had really become comfortable with his never<br/>
wanting to do what I considered academic) he announced that not only did he<br/>
want to do more &quot;schoolwork&quot; next year, he wanted to try to get a diploma<br/>
through the public program he&#39;s registered with.  While I don&#39;t believe<br/>
either is necessary, I was willing to help him achieve it.<br/>
<br/>
So far this year (since September) he&#39;s put in maybe an hour a week on<br/>
academic stuff.  I started getting into nagging mode on the whole thing.  It<br/>
was partly because he&#39;d keep me waiting most of the day with one excuse<br/>
after another for why he couldn&#39;t to start yet.  I finally told him the time<br/>
period that I would be available each day to help him.  I explained that I<br/>
was having trouble organizing my day when I didn&#39;t know when I&#39;d need to<br/>
help him.  He hasn&#39;t asked for help since, so I&#39;m assuming that his goal<br/>
either isn&#39;t really what he thinks it is, or it&#39;s coming from someone else.<br/>
