<div id="ygrps-yiv-744459534">&lt;&lt;Abraham Lincoln didn&#39;t fight the Civil War to free the slaves and <br/>
give them American citizenship, but it&#39;s a cultural myth so big that <br/>
it clouds any discussion of the Civil War.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Really?<br/>
<br/>
So, how does one know when things are true or not?  I mean, you can <br/>
always find (at least) two sides to a historical account.  Like what <br/>
was posted about the Columbus story and whether certain islands were <br/>
inhabited or not.  One culture says they were there; one culture says <br/>
no one was there <br/>
<br/>
How do you wade through the BS???  (I read &quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me&quot; <br/>
a few years ago  maybe I should check it out again)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, if you are looking at primary sources of a historical event, then you<br/>
sort of have to sort through and figure out which version (or middle<br/>
version) makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
But in  most of these cases we are talking about the &quot;text book&quot; version or<br/>
the &quot;popular culture&quot; version.  In that case, go to the primary sources.  Or<br/>
even secondary sources.  Read a good book written by someone who DID look at<br/>
the primaries.  Or better yet, read two or three books like that.  Compare<br/>
what they chose to look at when they have a discrepency.  Or where they are<br/>
coming from.<br/>
