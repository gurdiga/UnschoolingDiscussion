did. He was extremely competent and needed at his job for many years, but<br/>
after work, he was his own person and not at all mainstream in his lifestyle<br/>
or attitudes. <br/>
<br/>
Whenever anyone called him weird or pointed out how he differed from them,<br/>
he had a habit of saying, &quot;Thank you.&quot;  He was glad that his defferences<br/>
showed, and also glad that people noticed. He knew he was having an effect.<br/>
<br/>
Being weird is, as you know, an affirmation that you are not a sheep or a<br/>
robot that&#39;s been programmed.<br/>

weird.  There are no exceptions.&quot;  I like that one too.<br/>
