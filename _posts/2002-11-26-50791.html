 <br/>
Shyrley,  you bring a tent from the US?<br/>
 <br/>
Is anyone else out there thinking about going over?   From the states?   It is very reasonably priced,  airfare, in May, to England is pretty resonable,  I know, tho&#39; , it still is several hundred dollars for five of us so, I do have to add it all up.

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s much more fun to be on the main site with everyone or you feel <br/>
a bit left out.<br/>
Campfires aren&#39;t allowed in the UK like wot they are here but we <br/>
took one of them dish BBQ&#39;s and lit one in there. Then we sat <br/>
round it till the wee hours drinking and yakking.<br/>

about the size of a suitcase.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nope. I have an 8 berth tent back in the UK. Gonna go fetch it <br/>
froma  friends house. It&#39;s roomier than my US one. Ideal for cooking <br/>
inside if (I mean, when) it rains.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would recommend a car. Charmouth doesn&#39;t have a railway <br/>
station and its hard to get all your camping gear on the train.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That could be! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We camped at Yosemite once, and felt like we were in a parking lot in a city. <br/>
 We were just passing through, driving from San Jose to Albuquerque (NOT <br/>
recommended) and it was just me-pregant, Kirby two years old, and Keith our <br/>
fearless driver and guide.  Even though it was October, they crowded people <br/>
into adjoining spaces, busses came by to take us to the visitors&#39; center, <br/>
there were ranger-led things scheduled about every hour, there were several <br/>
places to eat...  <br/>
<br/>
Next to us was a single guy from Los Angeles, sleeping in a nice new sleeping <br/>
bag in the middle of his allotted space, no tent, on ground that was more ash <br/>
than dirt, NO grass.  He was thrilled to be out in nature.  We wanted to get <br/>
back on the road and get to New Mexico where it wasn&#39;t so structured and <br/>
crowded and ashen.<br/>

DH was stunned I didn&#39;t know that but I&#39;ve never really thought <br/>
beyond electricity being blue n sparkly. Rhodri wanted to know how <br/>
it went down the wires so I went to look in a book rather than <br/>
