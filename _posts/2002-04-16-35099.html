<div id="ygrps-yiv-690639021">Here&#39;s my embarrassing math thingy. For grade 1-4 I went to a <br/>
work-at-your-own-pace school with cubicles for the kids. We had workbooks in <br/>
the subjects and we set &quot;goals&quot; for ourselves each week (under the eye of <br/>
the teacher) and then worked to meet those goals... etc. For some reason, I <br/>
completely missed the fact that there were &quot;correct answers&quot; to the math <br/>
problems, or if I did know this, I didn&#39;t know I was supposed to be giving <br/>
them. I mean, it was pretty dire. I was a very VERY very introverted child, <br/>
nothing to say, own little world, all that.<br/>
<br/>
ANYWAY, :) I could not do math correctly in school. That is, I could not <br/>
produce the correct answer, because I was fiddling with the answer according <br/>
to my own weird agenda. For example, if the answer was 456 I would take one <br/>
away from the six and give to the four, making it 555. If it came out to be <br/>
556, I&#39;d give the extra to the third digit first, then the next time that <br/>
happened the second (565), then the next time the first (655), then start <br/>
over. I had other weird little games like this and I did it in my head so <br/>
there was no evidence on the paper. So, ALL of my answers were wrong every <br/>
time, without fail. I went to tutors who played dice games with me, etc., <br/>
and reported to my parents that I was fine. But because of this I failed the <br/>
third grade.<br/>
<br/>
There was just a massive disconnect somewhere between me, my parents, and <br/>
the teacher. Had I opened my mouth and explained what I was doing, that I <br/>
was some sort of little three-digit socialist, it would have been fixed I <br/>
suppose. After fourth grade (which was actually third grade again), they <br/>
took me out of the school and put me in a parochial school with regular <br/>
classrooms and I perked right up. I think the main problem with me and math <br/>
was that the &quot;goals&quot; set for me were way too unchallenging and I was bored <br/>
out of my mind, just searching for a way to make things more interesting. <br/>
It&#39;s hard to remember because I was so nonverbal at the time -- what was I <br/>
thinking?<br/>
<br/>
I continued to have some difficulty with math because I could do the answer <br/>
in my head but not on the paper. I remember wondering how in the hell to <br/>
make those numbers string down from the problem, doing long division, it <br/>
just seemed like a lot of extra mess when I knew the answer. This became a <br/>
problem again in high school algebra/trig/whatever with the old &quot;SHOW YOUR <br/>
WORK&quot; imperative that I could not answer. :) In college I did fine with <br/>
calculus etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think my experiences in grade school are the main motivating factor in my <br/>
trying to homeschool my kid. I remember so vividly the overwhelming boredom <br/>
of pages and pages of math problems in their neat, military little lines, <br/>
stretching out ahead into the weeks and months of the school year. Blech.<br/>
<br/>
And on that cheery note!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
LILY<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052691545">My math experience is probably the opposite of most people&#39;s. I enjoyed math<br/>
so much that I had the vague impression I&#39;d always been good at it. Then I<br/>
stumbled on my grade school report cards and it reminded me I hadn&#39;t liked<br/>
grade school math and was a pretty solid C student.<br/>
<br/>
The numbers and the tediousness of early math got to me. The one thing that<br/>
got drilled into me was being precise was the most important part of math.<br/>
If there were patterns to arithmetic, they got lost in making sure all the<br/>
numbers were doing exactly what they were supposed to.<br/>
<br/>
(That was a tough lesson to unlearn, especially since it got reinforced in<br/>
college engineering classes. I didn&#39;t unlearn it until I was an adult and<br/>
forced to do math in my head and realized I didn&#39;t need precision to the 6th<br/>
decimal place. Being close was good enough. In fact estimation is way more<br/>
useful than precision. But estimation -- though we were *told* it was an<br/>
important skill -- was merely a chapter in the math book and then we went<br/>
back to getting answers right to the umpteenth decimal point. In fact<br/>
estimation made no sense at all in the context of math class. Why would<br/>
anyone want to do the problem twice? Once to get a rough answer and then<br/>
again to get the right answer? Just double the tediousness.)<br/>
<br/>
Then I hit algebra and the emphasis shifted to pattern recognition and I<br/>
soared :-) All the way through from Algebra to Trig it was nothing but<br/>
recognize the problem type, apply the appropriate formula and voile!<br/>
Elegance :-) I absolutely adored Geometry proofs. (Which apparently they<br/>
don&#39;t even do any more.) The proofs were like games to me. In fact I see a<br/>
lot of parallels between geometry proofs and answering homeschooling<br/>
questions. The procedure is to take someone&#39;s thinking step by logical step<br/>
from where it is to where it needs to be to understand how children learn<br/>
naturally. Q.E.D. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I adored college math, especially calculus and differential equations. More<br/>
pattern recognition and apply the formula.<br/>
<br/>
But when it came time to use the math for practical purposes in engineering<br/>
courses I was befuddled. I didn&#39;t really understand why I was doing what I<br/>
was doing. The problems weren&#39;t elegant in engineering. They were messy with<br/>
bits and pieces of different problem types mixed together. I ended up<br/>
graduating near the bottom of my class (the worst of the best :-) and the<br/>
only thing that got me as high as I was was math, art, psychology and<br/>
programming. Rather crude programming with computer cards, but programming<br/>
nonetheless and it saved me from a career in befuddlement because<br/>
programming is just geometry proofs :-)<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until I started helping my daughter figure out real life problems<br/>
that I &quot;got&quot; arithmetic. I could finally see the patterns. Since we were<br/>
doing all the math in our heads, we couldn&#39;t keep track of all the<br/>
intermediate answers so I had to tear the numbers apart and rebuild them out<br/>
loud for her into numbers that would add or subtract easily. And from<br/>
listening to me do that she &quot;got&quot; how numbers worked. She can see the<br/>
patterns that it took me until adulthood to see.<br/>
<br/>
My husband teaches algebra and modern math courses and occasionally brings<br/>
problems home that are puzzling him. He&#39;ll walk through them using the<br/>
concepts he&#39;s trying to teach and words that I&#39;ve lost the meaning for. He<br/>
uses the same techniques I used all through school of trying to figure out<br/>
how the formula fits the pattern of the problem. But I can see the problems<br/>
differently now. I can see essential patterns in the problem itself without<br/>
being clouded by the formulas.<br/>
