<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105955952">Hi!<br/>
My family and I have just moved to L.A. from Arkansas. We have 2<br/>
children, ages 5 and 8&1/2 whom we unschool. We would love to connect<br/>
with other unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we are looking for an apartment! We are staying somewhere<br/>
temporarely for 3 weeks, but this arrangement ends on January 28th. <br/>
Does anybody have information they can give us to help us locate housing?<br/>
We are willing to live in a one bedroom, although a two bedroom would<br/>
be lovely, but we need a place that&#39;s $1100 or less per month and we<br/>
have one cat.<br/>
My husband has a television show that teaches kids about classical<br/>
music called Symphony Sam:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hotmusic.org/SymphonySam.htm">http://www.hotmusic.org/SymphonySam.htm</a><br/>
and we moved here to make it into a television series.<br/>
He is looking for a job to support us for now until Symphony Sam takes<br/>
off, so if anybody has any leads for him in that department too, we&#39;d<br/>
be grateful! He&#39;s willing to do just about anything, although<br/>
something in the acting, music or entertainement fields would be awesome!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-784332606">Hi Denise,<br/>
<br/>
Not sure where you are in L.A., but I&#39;m down south in Laguna Beach, <br/>
unschooling with my son, age 8 1/2.  We have one feisty cat as well. <br/>
;-)<br/>
Be sure to check out the California Science Center in Exposition Park <br/>
(adjacent to USC). It&#39;s a big museum, and free, though you have to pay <br/>
for parking. There are a half-dozen other museums within walking <br/>
distance.<br/>
Perhaps a beach day down our way when the weather warms up a bit?<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to (not-so-sunny) So Cal!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-430290402">Hi Denise & Barb!!<br/>
 <br/>
We are in the Huntington Beach area. Glad to see someone else is close to  us <br/>
as well. Welcome to L.A. Denise. We have just moved to the area from Arizona  <br/>
a few months ago. My husband took a job here as well. As Barb had said, not  <br/>
sure what area of L.A. you are in........there are many choices for apts. in <br/>
all  areas of town. We stayed in an Extended Stay America while we looked for  <br/>
housing. The price was moderate and it had a small kitchen in the room. This <br/>
was  helpful and saved money as well.<br/>
 <br/>
I agree Barb, not so sunny California the last few days! The worst was  over <br/>
this last weekend. So many people lost there lives and homes. So very sad.  <br/>
Now that the rain is gone and the sun is out again, things will improve in the  <br/>
area for most. <br/>
 <br/>
It sounds as if Barb has lived in the area much longer than I have. She  <br/>
would be your best source of info. Any help I can give, just ask. LOL......I  have <br/>
learned my way around town and get from point A to point B without getting  <br/>
lost - ANYMORE! NOW the Freeways......they still freak me out a bit...LOL!! I  <br/>
have been unschooling my boys for 3 years now. It works for us and the kids <br/>
are  much happier because of it. I&#39;ll say good bye for now. Nice to meet both of <br/>
you  here thru the group. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-989828823">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My family and I have just moved to L.A. from Arkansas. We have 2<br/>

<br/>
I live in Playa Del Rey, by LAX, and have a 5yo dd. There are scattered<br/>
Unschoolers around, although there is a nice nest in the Long Beach area. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Also, we are looking for an apartment! We are staying somewhere<br/>
temporarely for 3 weeks, but this arrangement ends on January 28th. <br/>
Does anybody have information they can give us to help us locate<br/>
housing?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Please email me off list if you would like some opinion on the various<br/>
locales in Los Angeles. My dh is a Production Sound Mixer, and beginning to<br/>
direct a home fix-it TV series (start panting now, Kelly and the other<br/>
home-porn aficionados). <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;We are willing to live in a one bedroom, although a two bedroom would<br/>
be lovely, but we need a place that&#39;s $1100 or less per month and we<br/>
have one cat.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is not much for Los Angeles, believe it or not. However there seems to<br/>
be a plethora of apartments in our area at the moment. The question is where<br/>
is your production facility located, and how much of a commute are you<br/>
willing to engage in. How do you like the cost of gas here compared to other<br/>
parts of the country?<br/>

What IS it? It&#39;s about $1.66 here in SC right now (mostly mid-high  $1.60&#39;s).<br/>
 <br/>
LA? Elsewhere?<br/>

already.<br/>
 <br/>
And as the list is HUGELY not in southern California, can those discussions  <br/>
go to more local sources too?  Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>These looked like they were off-topic posts, and i was about to ask <br/>
people not to get started comparing gas prices all over the country - <br/>
but then I realized that I could easily get us back on topic because of <br/>
a discussion we just had the other day around here. My oldest child <br/>
drives and knows gas prices because she&#39;s paying for gas. But the other <br/>
kids - no. So the other day one asked me how much we DO spend driving <br/>
around all the time - we&#39;ve been short of money recently, so they&#39;ve <br/>
been hearing about how we need to cut back our spending - that&#39;s what <br/>
prompted the interest.<br/>
<br/>
So - we drove along (gas burning at a rapid rate &lt;G&gt;) and figured out <br/>
how much it was costing us. They wanted to know how much difference it <br/>
would make if I&#39;d always go to the less expensive gas station, thinking <br/>
that could save us some money - but then, if I had to drive out of my <br/>
way to go there, would that use up the savings? And on and on - lots <br/>
and lots of computation - they pulled out scrap paper because we <br/>
couldn&#39;t do it in our heads. I told them about mileage allowances - how <br/>
when I work for a company I ask to be compensated for mileage and how <br/>
they always have a certain number of cents per mile and what that is <br/>
supposed to cover and we talked about how they&#39;d figure it. Then I <br/>
pointed out that prices for EVERYTHING we buy depend on gas prices - <br/>
how important they are because transportation is part of the cost of <br/>
production of absolutely everything. So you&#39;re paying for gas when you <br/>
buy an ice cream cone or a pair of shoes or a set of Legos or anything <br/>
else.  And that went on to how to businesses decide how much to charge <br/>
for a product.  Good conversation.<br/>
