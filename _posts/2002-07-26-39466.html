documentary of twins where someone was stating that many twins have one lefty <br/>
and that many people who are lefties were (at one time) twins. I found it <br/>
very interesting because Moly was a twin. (I lost her twin early in my <br/>
pregnancy) Are any of your lefties twins or were they a twin?<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s for the mirror-image lefties, right?  And when that&#39;s the case, are <br/>
they also reversed as to major organs?  The egg splitting face-to-face or <br/>
something like that?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe no such a thing.   I read it somewhere once and it seemed cool.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about that. The program I was watching only focused on the <br/>
right/left thing. I have only seen one case of someone with reversed organs <br/>
and they were not a twin. I was in training in the ER and one of my friends <br/>
was assisting in a car crash case. When it was discovered that the woman&#39;s <br/>
organs weren&#39;t were they were supposed to be, everyone heard about it. I am <br/>
thinking it is a very rare thing. <br/>
