I have a friend who got through college, then law school, got a job as a <br/>
lawyer, got a date (he had not had girlfriends through all that), and on the date <br/>
was hit and killed in a crosswalk.<br/>
<br/>
Too much college and not enough life.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I wrote about Kirby, who is still undecided but might take a <br/>
couple of remedial-type classes (the pre-101 things) in spring, to warm up to how <br/>
such things work. Or he might re-test the reading section so he can get a <br/>
better score and take 101 English for credit.  The only test he had ever taken <br/>
before this was in driver&#39;s ed.  He was three points low of qualifying for <br/>
English 101.  Not bad for never seeing the inside of a school during classtime.<br/>

Some jobs without college...<br/>
working in bookstores, coffeeshops, grocery stores, video/music stores, and <br/>
becoming manager<br/>
<br/>
skilled construction trades  (a plumber took $500 off me today for an hour <br/>
and a half&#39;s work, and even if the guy only gets to keep $100 or so, that&#39;s not <br/>
too awful).<br/>
<br/>
hotel clerk, building up to other jobs there maybe in management<br/>
<br/>
there are legal jobs, clerks and paralegals and court reporting, that don&#39;t <br/>
take a lot of training but pay fairly well<br/>
<br/>
social services, juvenile, probation and such... depressing to me, but some <br/>
people seem drawn to that<br/>
<br/>
police and security jobs<br/>
<br/>
fire departments<br/>
<br/>
EMT (training, but not college degree)<br/>
<br/>
delivery jobs (flowers, UPS)<br/>
<br/>
USPS!  Postal service pays well and has retirement after 20 years, I think.<br/>

Most of these jobs now require at minimum a two year degree.  Lots of <br/>
criminal justice majors around here and psych majors going into social work.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-672933422">Also dog trainer or groomer both of which bring in good money and <br/>
niether of which require any type of certification or training in <br/>
Texas and writer, web page design, actor, singer, dancer, juggler, <br/>
magician which all require talent, skill and experience more than <br/>
education.  <br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t forget business owner.  Putting yourself as boss makes a <br/>
college degree moot.  Businesses don&#39;t have to be high tech or <br/>
large.  I know people who make a good living off of window washing, <br/>
petting sitting and scooping up dog poop in yards because they have <br/>
other people working for them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-768633532">My hubby is a Packaging Designer w/out going to college.  My SIL opens new restaurants for Friendly&#39;s across the country, and trains new employees w/out college. She is an excellent manager.  One of my best friends is a phenomenal photographer and besides making sure we always have photos of our kids ;-) she does occasional weddings and events. She and her husband are very knowledgeable about antiques - and often sell on ebay. They do quite well.  I have another friend who is a trainer for Foxwoods resorts/Casino who previously worked his way up in banking with out a degree.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes there is lots out there to do ;-) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446002671">Some other ways to make a living without a college<br/>
degree:<br/>
<br/>
opening up a store (many people are doing this<br/>
successfully online now)<br/>
<br/>
making and selling things you&#39;ve made (pottery,<br/>
diapers, clothing, paintings, furniture, baked goods,<br/>
etc.)<br/>
<br/>
catering<br/>
<br/>
alternative health care -- naturopath, massage<br/>
therapist, midwife, doula (if you wish to be<br/>
licensed/certified, you may need to go through some<br/>
sort of program, but some can be apprenticed)<br/>
<br/>
interior design (I know someone who got an<br/>
apprenticeship on the basis of her portfolio, although<br/>
you could always do the research yourself, pay the<br/>
licensing fee, and then open your own business)<br/>
<br/>
selling used items (a friend of mind made a living by<br/>
selling clothing on ebay and used textbooks to<br/>
schools)<br/>
<br/>
carpentry (my husband never went to college, and is<br/>
supporting his family just fine, thank you very much<br/>
:))<br/>
<br/>
farming <br/>
<br/>
writing (magazine articles, books)<br/>
<br/>
landscaping/gardening<br/>
<br/>
My best friend makes a living working as a nanny<br/>
part-time, and as a driver for elderly people<br/>
part-time<br/>
<br/>
Some of these have substantial start-up costs, but<br/>
most would be considerably less than the cost of<br/>
college tuition.<br/>

My sister has managed two stores and now is the lead teller at a little bank <br/>

She has also made money in the past being a caretaker for a retired and <br/>

done tilework and glass designing with sandblasting, all here and there and <br/>
never fulltime.<br/>

Greenhouses!  My cousin never went to college, and she has worked in <br/>

in that, and also floral design and supply.<br/>

jobs not requiring college are &quot;more desirable&quot; than jobs requiring <br/>
college education is for sure not as simplistic as it could be inferred <br/>
from the post (I am sure the original poster did not mean to <br/>
oversimplify, but let&#39;s not forget that we have a young woman making <br/>
decisions on the basis of our posts.)<br/>
No one I think mentioned it yet, so, let me mention it... you know, she <br/>
does not really have to invest time and money in college in order to get <br/>
a Ph. D. or whatever title she needs.... Academic titles are given all <br/>
the time to people that haven&#39;t followed classes, but are bright, <br/>
prepared, and have new ideas. Check out, for example, the story of the <br/>
19yr old serbian student that went to NY institute of Technology with <br/>
some Yugoslav fellowship, and after a week was already a doctor.... <br/>
Google &quot;Marko Tasic&quot;. Stories like that are not uncommon. By the way, if <br/>
your daughter happens to be interested in theoretical physics, tell her <br/>
to feel free to contact me in pvt.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-668432873">No, it&#39;s not the whole story.  There&#39;s a whole lot of personal stuff <br/>
there but this is where we are (though we never planned to be here) <br/>
and we&#39;re happy with our life or we would change it.  I think the <br/>
moral of the story is, do what you want to do and sometimes what you <br/>
have to do then make the the best of it because there is no one right <br/>
choice.  <br/>

Nothing in anyone&#39;s life is ever &quot;the whole story,&quot; is it?<br/>

The most academically talented friend I have studied science, because that&#39;s <br/>
what is prized among the academically minded.  She was in San Francisco, <br/>
working on a master&#39;s degree in medical research when she took a part-time job <br/>
refinishing antique furniture.  It was pretty much the first time she had ever <br/>
done anything that didn&#39;t involve books and numbers or literature (her dad is an <br/>
expert on Ben Jonson and his contemporaries, so she had grown up immersed in <br/>
Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre stuff).   She LOVED it.  It changed her life.  <br/>
She dropped out of grad school and took whole new paths.<br/>
<br/>
Her life is pretty wonderful, though the job she has now has nothing to do <br/>
with her degree from Wellesley (or whatever hotshot college it was from which <br/>
she got her undergrad degree).   She has beautifully restored and decorated the <br/>
1895ish adobe farm house her dad bought in 1970, which had been a speakeasy <br/>
during prohibition, which has been flooded, which has wonderful hardwood floors <br/>
in some parts, and beautiful Mexican tilework, and. . .   and for money she <br/>
teaches people to use computers without fear, and well.  She mixes now with <br/>
people her first path would never have led her to.  Poor people working to get out <br/>
of poverty, who apply to county programs, and who learn from  Laurie how to <br/>
use technology.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636007435">Here&#39;s an essay I wrote as a political statement but that is somewhat <br/>
apropos since it deals with what my life has been like despite not <br/>

what to do at given time time in one&#39;s life is not an all or nothing <br/>

<br/>
Between the Cracks<br/>
By Holly Furgason<br/>
<br/>
Every time there is a media piece on homeschooling the concern is <br/>
raised that some homeschooled children may, without government <br/>
oversight, &quot;fall between the cracks&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
After reading the latest account I began to think about my own <br/>
schooling.  You see, I was one who had &quot;fallen between the cracks&quot;.  <br/>
Ironically, it was inside one of the most regulated institutions in <br/>
the country and, still, there I was, between the cracks.<br/>
<br/>
During high school I regularly failed my classes only to pass by <br/>
acing the exams.  I hardly even went to school.  I missed 42 days in <br/>
one semester.  Then I failed my senior year, took two classes in <br/>
summer school, failed one of them and had to return to earn my <br/>
diploma.<br/>
<br/>
When I registered for my summer school classes after my senior year, <br/>
my guidance counselor asked me if I &quot;did drugs&quot;.  I didn&#39;t.  Nor did <br/>
I drink, smoke, swear or hang out.  I had no police record.  He was <br/>
baffled as to why I had failed and so was I.  Now I know that I was <br/>
just &quot;between the cracks&quot; where they couldn&#39;t reach.  <br/>
<br/>
I knew lots of others from school who had also fallen there.  Some of <br/>
them got into trouble, some dropped out and others just drifted from <br/>
view.  We were all there between the cracks for many reasons.  Some, <br/>
like me, were just bored and didn&#39;t care about school.  Others lived <br/>
the horrors of abuse and had no room left in their lives for school.  <br/>
Many just found other outlets for their time and energy; drugs, <br/>
music, employment, motherhood, travel.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d have a difficult time trying to figure out what to say to anyone <br/>
who would actually recognize me if I went back.  You see, I am <br/>
still &quot;between the cracks&quot;.   My life has not been a success in their <br/>
terms.  I have no college degree, no career and precious little <br/>
money.  I don&#39;t own my own house or even a car.<br/>
<br/>
I do, however, have a marriage of over 20 years, four beautiful <br/>
unschooled children (who have been raised right here, between the <br/>
cracks).  I&#39;ve spent countless hours volunteering, founded several <br/>
organizations and owned three successful businesses. I&#39;ve grown my <br/>
own food including raising and slaughtering poultry.  I can spin <br/>
wool, weave and sew my own clothes.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned how to play the piano, interpret for the Deaf, and train <br/>
dogs.  I have been interviewed for radio, television and print.  I <br/>
was the subject of a cover story for a large urban weekly.   I have <br/>
directed Shakespeare and developed a love for the opera.  I performed <br/>
in my first professional theatre production at the age of 38 and <br/>
regularly work as a volunteer costumer.<br/>
<br/>
People I don&#39;t know contact me for advice and information on a daily <br/>
basis.  I&#39;m asked to speak to groups that range from political to <br/>
educational to religious. I&#39;ve sat on the boards of charitable <br/>
organizations and was a member of the American Library Association.<br/>
<br/>
My writings have been published in small specialty magazines and <br/>
large international publications.  I developed an innovative foreign <br/>
language curriculum for children and was once teaching (very <br/>
effectively) over 100 students foreign languages I don&#39;t even speak.  <br/>
I was the January 1997 Daily Didactic Diversion winner at cartalk.com <br/>
but never made it to Politically Incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve hosted award winning, internationally renowned authors and <br/>
recently dined with the mayor of Houston, Texas and a U.S. <br/>
Representative. I served a Congressional internship before <br/>
congressional internships were considered risky (or is that risqué?) <br/>
and I have won two local elections; one as a Democrat and one as a <br/>
Republican but I belong to neither party now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not bragging, mind you.  Anybody could do the same and more- that <br/>
is as long as they&#39;re not caught in the 9-5/carpooling/keeping-up-<br/>
with-the-Joneses rut- the world outside the crack.  I just wanted to <br/>
bring out the point that it&#39;s not so bad between the cracks which is <br/>
a good thing since no government can prevent anyone from falling <br/>
there.  It can&#39;t prevent it in the institutions it runs and it <br/>
definitely can&#39;t prevent it in private homes.  Indeed, it shouldn&#39;t.</div>

&lt;&lt; Of course, Deb, this is quite possible, however the implication that <br/>
<br/>
jobs not requiring college are &quot;more desirable&quot; than jobs requiring <br/>
<br/>
college education is for sure not as simplistic as it could be inferred <br/>
<br/>
from the post &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A simple statement of fact is just that.<br/>
If you inferred more, that&#39;s your own mind doing a dance, and that&#39;s fine too.<br/>
<br/>
There was not an implication that non-college jobs were more desireable.<br/>
<br/>
No one is trying to be simplistic.   Brainstorming sessions (such as people <br/>
throwing out ideas about what jobs don&#39;t need college) are supposed to be just <br/>
that--brainstorm.  No one is writing a essay with any summary or conclusion or <br/>
recommendation.  Just ideas and factoids.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am sure the original poster did not mean to oversimplify. . .-=-<br/>
<br/>
Simply put, her husband changed jobs and the new one pays less.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-. . . but let&#39;s not forget that we have a young woman making <br/>
<br/>
decisions on the basis of our posts.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s&quot; not assume anyone is making decisions based on ANY one thing.<br/>
If someone uses information from this forum as more fodder for her own <br/>
decision mill, good.  <br/>
<br/>
Decisions to go to college or not are frequently made on the basis of MUCH <br/>
less information than this, and rarely with as much balance as the ideas <br/>
presented here in just the past day or two.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Check out, for example, the story of the <br/>
<br/>
19yr old serbian student that went to NY institute of Technology with <br/>
<br/>
some Yugoslav fellowship, and after a week was already a doctor.... <br/>
<br/>
Google &quot;Marko Tasic&quot;. Stories like that are not uncommon. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, they are very UNcommon.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Academic titles are given all <br/>
<br/>
the time to people that haven&#39;t followed classes. . .&quot;<br/>

&quot;All the time&quot; is quite an overstatement for this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747171548">I contributed my 2c to the question, which may be discarded of course.<br/>
For the original poster, in case the young woman is interested in <br/>
theoretical physics, not only she can contact me, but I can name a <br/>
number of well-known physics professors that received a ph. d. diploma <br/>
in their mailbox. Of course they&#39;d already been hired by universities or <br/>
something.... you know, bright people are highly attractive to work <br/>
with. I would imagine that unschooled people are brighter than average <br/>
and so this will be relevant for them: since, as I said, it happens to a <br/>
non-negligible fraction of bright and successful graduates. (Of course <br/>
there&#39;s plenty of people that finish their ph. d. program only because <br/>
they invest a lot of money and aren&#39;t very bright or independed-minded, <br/>
but we are not talking about that). IMHO, if someone wants to be a <br/>
carpenter, fine, if someone wants to be a lawyer, fine as well... she&#39;ll <br/>
learn everything by herself, pass the bar exam with flying colors, and <br/>
be a smart lawyer that has many ideas that other lawyers, that followed <br/>
class and books without too much independence of mind, will never have. <br/>
IMHO one should not ask oneself &quot;which careers I can do without going to <br/>
college?&quot;, but feel confident that any topic can be studied (in college, <br/>
or out of college; whatever fits best) and if there&#39;s legal requirement <br/>
for a title, obtaining it is a trivial task for those that have the <br/>
abilities. IMHO. I may be wrong.<br/>

IMHO.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not convinced that avoiding college altogether was the primary goal of<br/>
the original questioner. I got &quot;reducing pressure from others to go to<br/>
college right now, by having alternative information&quot; as the intent. Here&#39;s<br/>
the quote:<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I&#39;d like to give my daughter some information about careers that do not<br/>
require a college degree so she can understand that she has options other<br/>
than college, and I was hoping some members on this list could suggest a few<br/>
resources.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
The point is to have the information and confidence to choose or reject<br/>
college mindfully. The mainstream path is that college is essential for<br/>
prosperity, and possibly even a guarantee of same. We have examples to show<br/>
that neither proposition is always true. The mainstream thinking is that<br/>
merely completing any college degree is an indicator of certain personal and<br/>
ethical qualities in a person such as perseverance, application, and<br/>
seriousness regarding work. Well I guess we have examples to show that is<br/>
also sometimes balderdash, and that there are other ways of demonstrating<br/>
these attributes. <br/>
<br/>
OTOH going to college for a vocational or personal interest reason that is<br/>
important to the student, can make it a wonderful experience. Sometimes<br/>
there are facilities and tools that are available to the student that would<br/>
be harder to find elsewhere. Sometimes the peer group of like minded and<br/>
passionate individuals in the field makes the experience brilliant. I found<br/>
both of these facets of college when I went into an area I was passionate<br/>
about at the &quot;mature age&quot; (the official designation) of 26, with a very<br/>
clear idea of my interests and my educational goals for the course of study<br/>
I chose.<br/>
<br/>
I returned to college because I felt a lack of knowledge and skills in<br/>
myself, that was holding me back in my career. I found the pace of learning<br/>
on the job to be too slow for my own advancement. I had a great time<br/>
socially also, but that was not the motivation behind attendance.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I wrote about my own college history a while ago:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I do remember feeling a strong need for education in my mid twenties. I<br/>
felt I needed more skills if I wanted to advance as a set/costume designer.<br/>
So I went to Technical College specifically for that. First I studied some<br/>
Architectural Drafting (in the olden days before CAD)at one place; then I<br/>
did some Fashion Illustration and also Pattern Drafting at two others – just<br/>
enough for practical purposes. Finally after working for a while, both in<br/>
and out of the theater, I returned to University and actually attained a<br/>
degree in Theatre Design, discovering both Lighting Design (which I truly<br/>
adore) and Film. The feeling of going to college for my own genuine purposes<br/>
and really loving it, was so immensely different from going when I first<br/>
finished High School, and enrolling in an unfinished Bachelor of Science,<br/>
because I felt so pressured by everyone as top of the class to “do something<br/>
with my brain”, when all I really wanted was Show Business. (I should add<br/>
everyone except my mother, ironically, who much preferred that I go into the<br/>
“family business”- musical theater.) Now I am very excited to be writing<br/>
feature film scripts.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Fact is, I could have continued to work in the theater without the degree,<br/>
in different positions, but I was ambitious and wanted to be in charge of my<br/>
department(s) sooner. Being motivated and somewhat talented did not make it<br/>
a &quot;trivial&quot; enterprise, either. It was actually wonderfully challenging.<br/>
<br/>
I think we can add to the list many positions in all the Performing Arts as<br/>
places for employment without a college degree. I don&#39;t think I have ever<br/>
asked a single person for their college qualifications when interviewing<br/>
them for either a theater or film job. You don&#39;t need a degree to write<br/>
either, although sometimes access to the helpful criticism of the Professors<br/>
can be useful.<br/>
