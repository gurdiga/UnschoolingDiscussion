<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691580909">We use to live down the road from some folks that raised Connemaras that<br/>
they evented and did dressage with.  Beautiful horse ponies!!!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve owned a few TB mares that we crossed with quarter horses.<br/>
<br/>
We did have one gelding that had been raced.  We called him Screwy Lewy!<br/>
That goofy horse would still &quot;hear&quot; the bell on the starting gate and up<br/>
would go his head and away he&#39;d go!  Took a real &quot;expert&quot; to ride him<br/>
because you never knew when he&#39;d &quot;hear&quot; that bell &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-327408470">**Why can&#39;t people  understand or at least stop bringing it up. First off my <br/>
dd is 5 years old and if I was a PSer and held her back a year they all would <br/>
have nothing to <br/>
say. But b/c I homeschool everyone has an opinion. I know, learn to deal, but <br/>
it frustrates me so. Maybe I frustrate me since I am such a wimp w/ my mother <br/>
I can&#39;t argue this w/ her.**<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thank you for telling us, I&#39;ll keep it in mind. Say, did you see...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, I hadn&#39;t heard. I&#39;ll keep it in mind. Say, did you hear....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so on. :) Don&#39;t argue, smile, nod, and change the subject. <br/>
<br/>
Unless you really like arguing, that is. :-)<br/>
