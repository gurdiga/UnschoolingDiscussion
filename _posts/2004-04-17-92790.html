&lt;&lt; Hello, I have been quiet for a while, enjoying my munchkins for Spring <br/>
Break. <br/>
 I can&#39;t wait until Kindergarten is over!!!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s over now if you don&#39;t send them back.<br/>
Kindergarten&#39;s been going on for years and years and will continue to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Your children&#39;s stay there is just a few months.  It could end today!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Your children&#39;s stay there is just a few months.  It could end today!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know that it could have ended long ago or at least a week ago (the last <br/>
Friday before Easter, when Spring Break started).  And in my mind, I thought, <br/>
&quot;Maybe he will enjoy being home this whole week and won&#39;t want to go back.&quot;  <br/>
We&#39;ve had a wonderful week, where we did what we wanted, when we wanted, PJ&#39;s all <br/>
day, T-Ball, Busch Gardens, games, building, art, movies, etc., etc., etc.  <br/>
But as the week ended, he started asking when does he &quot;have&quot; to go back and I <br/>
said you don&#39;t &quot;have&quot; to.  But he keeps saying that he wants to.  If he told me <br/>
he didn&#39;t want to go back, he wouldn&#39;t.  But I feel like I &quot;put&quot; him there as <br/>
I lost my nerve when K approached and now that he has formed a likeness or a <br/>
fondness for it, it would be unfair to make yet another decision without him.  <br/>
We have discussed over and over about next year and he is adamant about not <br/>
going again.  There&#39;s a lot he doesn&#39;t like and that&#39;s enough for his decision <br/>
but on top of those things, he knows he would be there all day as opposed to 3 <br/>
hours and that he will have different teachers and most likely if we were <br/>
going to continue school, he would have to go to a different one because we don&#39;t <br/>
like the commute to the one he is in and he was moved up on the waiting list <br/>
for the Fundamental school closer to us.  He doesn&#39;t go to our zoned school.  <br/>
So, I am certain that he will not miss it once it has been over for the Summer <br/>
and he already knows it would be a different school and all day.  He tells me <br/>
that he likes to play at school and go outside but he doesn&#39;t like having to <br/>
wait all the time, wait for recess, wait for art, wait for library day, and all <br/>
that.  He says he already knows everything they teach him, and that&#39;s true.  <br/>
He actually seems to know less now that he&#39;s been there, he knew so much <br/>
before K.  Anyway, as much of a struggle as it is, I know that he is helping to <br/>
make this choice and I am happy for that.  When I started the homeschooling <br/>
journey and discovered unschooling along the way, I found my path, it feels <br/>
natural, like a calling, I think we&#39;ve always done it actually, until K, we&#39;ve just <br/>
never called it by a name.  It was like an anxious child with an answer saying, <br/>
&quot;Pick me, pick me, pick me.&quot;  And as hubby learned more and felt good about <br/>
it and our families too, I knew that we found what we had been looking for.  <br/>
But in doing so, I feel like he has a right to a choice in this.  So we are here <br/>
and soon we will be where we want to be and that&#39;s OK for now.  I just really <br/>
hope he doesn&#39;t ask to go next year, cuz I&#39;d just fall apart.  But he seems <br/>
to know what he wants and isn&#39;t that the goal we seek in this?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-630653134">Hi Pamela,<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you&#39;re in a bit of a tough situation, but you know, <br/>
I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;d let my 5 yr. old. make such an important <br/>
decision at such an early.  Sometimes, kindergarten, the teachers, <br/>
and the other students can make such a *strong* impact, but it&#39;s not <br/>
necessarily a good one.  To me, it&#39;s like advertising on TV.  When <br/>
the boys were younger, they really thought that the toys advertised <br/>
would be as COOL as they looked on TV.  It took a bit more maturity <br/>
and experience for them to be able to step back and say &quot;Yeah, it <br/>
looks neat on TV, but that&#39;s TV.&quot;  I don&#39;t believe they could have <br/>
done that for kindergarten. And yes, we bought them the &quot;cool&quot; toys <br/>
a few times to show them that they wouldn&#39;t be quite the same, but a <br/>
few toy disappointments don&#39;t have nearly the negative impact of a <br/>
year in kindergarten. :&#92;<br/>
<br/>
You said it yourself...your son seems to know LESS after being in <br/>
K...and I&#39;ll bet that he&#39;s internalizing some not so great concepts <br/>
and ideas there, too.  But at his age, he can&#39;t recognize those...he <br/>
only sees the playground, friends, the &quot;cool&quot; stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts... :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-244795168">Absolutely the only reason my youngest is still in Kindergarten is because his teacher is truly amazing.  He&#39;s got a few weeks left and he&#39;s going to miss her like crazy.<br/>
<br/>
She teaches her students through life.  I&#39;ve actually been in the process of writing an article about her for our local paper.  She&#39;s just an amazing individual.<br/>
<br/>
However, if she wasn&#39;t there, he would have been removed when my other two were.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m actually dreading the end of the wonderful relationship Max has formed with her.  I just can&#39;t say enough about how special she is.  I&#39;ll miss her terribly and hope to keep in touch with her.  She has offered to do any evaluations the state requires.<br/>

about possibly moving him up to first grade since he is so &quot;smart&quot;--<br/>
the teacher acknowledged that he seemed to be ahead of the other <br/>
kids, but there were just a couple of math concepts she wanted him to <br/>
master before moving him up, and that he would probably be moved <br/>
after winter break. It never happened, and i didnt push it cuz it <br/>
didnt seem a big deal to me. By his parent teacher conference just <br/>
before spring break (horrible story), she said that he used to be <br/>
above average now he is &quot;just average&quot;...my son is clearly not <br/>
&quot;average&quot; but it was pretty obvious to me (and to my SON!)that doing <br/>
more, thinking more, talking more didnt get you anywhere but in <br/>
trouble in this class, so why bother?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son finished out his K year, because i was working full time and <br/>
didnt know what to do (if i had to do over, i wouldve quit my job <br/>
that day and taken him home)...but i promised him, over the summer <br/>
i&#39;d figure out SOME way, any way, to HS, and he&#39;d never have to go <br/>
back. But they let the K students meet their 1st grade teachers, and <br/>
she gave the kids all these little trinkets and toys, even Pokemon <br/>
stuff, so Seamus thought 1st grade would be soooo cool. So i let him <br/>
go. Within days he was begging to stay home. Poor kid. <br/>
<br/>
I hope your son doesnt want to go next year either...but if he does, <br/>
i think the fact that you want him home and he could come home <br/>
anytime, will mean alot. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Definitely some good points.  But I don&#39;t really see any &quot;bad&quot; stuff that he <br/>
&gt; may keep to himself.  We talk about everything.  Being nearly 6 1/2, he can <br/>
&gt; communicate wonderfully.  His K is still only a 3 hour program unlike many of <br/>
&gt; our local schools which have switched to full day.  I don&#39;t see a whole lot <br/>
&gt; of any negative stuff coming home because they flat out don&#39;t have any time <br/>
&gt; for anything.  We get there at 11:30 and it takes &#39;till nearly 12:00 to get <br/>
&gt; the 18 K&#39;s ready for the day and then they cram all the day&#39;s activities into <br/>
&gt; the next 2 hours and then start getting packed up at 2:00 and then they are <br/>
&gt; out the door by 2:15.  So we do have  wonderful mornings and then the rest of <br/>
&gt; the day.  The most negative stuff is that they have no time to really do <br/>
&gt; anything, they are rushed.  He tells me all the time that he can never say much <br/>
&gt; cuz there&#39;s no time to listen.  He likes his teachers and so do I, we have made <br/>
&gt; it a point to &quot;know&quot; them.  When it comes to him knowing less now than <br/>
&gt; before, I feel that he still knows it all but hesitates to express himself because <br/>
&gt; he knows there&#39;s no time there for individual focus.  If this had been a <br/>
&gt; full-day program, he would never have gone.  We tried this out because I lost my <br/>
&gt; nerve, but he is still the little guy we&#39;ve always known, he&#39;s never cried <br/>
&gt; there or been hurt and we are there all the time.  If my 2 year old and I are <br/>
&gt; done doing our stuff, we go over to the school early and play.  We chose this <br/>
&gt; school because it is a Fundamental school and gives us, as parents, more say <br/>
&gt; in his day and more parent, teacher, staff interaction.  I can&#39;t say too <br/>
&gt; much negative stuff about it because there&#39;s not enough time for anything in a <br/>
&gt; 3-hour day but our family never wanted to do school and we just know that we <br/>
&gt; won&#39;t do it again, if we are lucky enough to continue living as we do, with me <br/>
&gt; at home.  If he ever said he didn&#39;t want to go, he wouldn&#39;t.  If the school <br/>
&gt; was killing his spirit, he was unhappy, or if it was full day, we would never <br/>
&gt; even think about it, he just wouldn&#39;t go.  I guess we all look at like a <br/>
&gt; 3-hour playtime, which for now, he&#39;s OK with.  I think our family life has <br/>
&gt; suffered far more than he.  We learned a lot this year, it gave us an appreciation <br/>
&gt; for what we had prior to school.  It gave me the strength I needed to say I <br/>
&gt; am going to homeschool.  There are a lot of things I don&#39;t like that helped <br/>
&gt; put me back on track, none of them I think are detrimental to him or he <br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be there at all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s awesome and it seems that in doing the evaluations, that she is <br/>
supporting your decision to bring your child home.  Our teacher is the same, she is <br/>
supportive and happy to help.  This makes it easier to let him continue, even <br/>
if I&#39;m gritting my teeth through each day.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>How awful for her to say that!!  This truely supports that schools dumb them <br/>
down.  One good example for us is that they decided to teach the Pledge of <br/>
Allegiance and they were going to go over one part each week for 4 weeks and <br/>
whoever could recite it, would get a certificate and a little prize, well he knew <br/>
it from day one because he had learned that in karate almost 2 years earlier <br/>
and when he told the teacher that, she said that&#39;s really good but you need to <br/>
wait until we go over it with everyone until you recite it.  So he waits and <br/>
as they go over each part, he begins to forget how it goes all together.  In <br/>
the end, he is still 1st to recite it but I could see the wheels slowing down <br/>
during the process of waiting.  In scchool they are trained to think alike, work <br/>
alike, do alike, all at the same time.  It&#39;s horrible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But they let the K students meet their 1st grade teachers, and <br/>
she gave the kids all these little trinkets and toys, even Pokemon <br/>

i think the fact that you want him home and he could come home <br/>

<br/>
He has already met the 1st grade teacher but he knows he wouldn&#39;t be going to <br/>
that school again anyway.  He is also not happy about being there ALL day.  <br/>
So I think he is firm in his decision for next year.  <br/>
