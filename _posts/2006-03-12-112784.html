<div id="ygrps-yiv-327290237">As in my previous post that I mentioned, we are remodeling.  Even though our house has been torn apart since the last week in Nov. of last year, we have been having a great time.  Lindsay (3 1/2) has been painting on the plywood floors with stencils, paintbrushes, and roller brushes.  I&#39;m thinking how fun it will be, if we live in this house for a long time and ever redo the floors again, to find all of this wonderful painting from my dd underneath.  What happy memories they will be, not to mention the fun that we are having now.<br/>
   <br/>
  DD and DS (1 1/2) have also enjoyed watching all of the work being done in the house.  DS has studied the electrical work on the light switches, in fact DH and I are wondering just how much he&#39;s &quot;picked-up&quot;, lol.  He really studies things and he&#39;s only 20 months, lol.  DD and DS both enjoyed watching the plumbers dig up the yard when they repiped our house.  They got to look at all of the tools in the plumber&#39;s van and they got to dig in the dirt that they left behind.  It&#39;s quite an adventure for all of us.<br/>
   <br/>
  Aww, this unschooling life is so great and we are just getting started!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-687320412">I love your post. We too are always in construction/destruction with our big<br/>
old house and our kids love it. The love the noise, the mess, the people<br/>
coming and going, the machines, the physical changes. We try to let them<br/>
see/watch/touch as much as possible. Last week when we were cleaning out our<br/>
garage - which is full of my husbands dumpster diving treasures, they had a<br/>
blast building little habitats out of wood, flowers, tape, clothes drying<br/>
rack etc. It really amazes me. They need NO toys - just access to all the<br/>
cool stuff in the world.... They are 2 and 4 and love to play with tools,<br/>
dirt, water, plants, and any weird piece of anything they find... wonderful!<br/>
