<div id="ygrps-yiv-270697239">Hi Molly,<br/>
<br/>
And welcome to the list. I will attempt to answer a few of your questions <br/>
with what I believe and what holds true for our family, and I&#39;m sure there <br/>
will be lots of others who pipe in with their own feelings. One of the best <br/>
thing about unschooling is that it evolves constantly according to how  you <br/>
see it and let it evolve and follow your instincts.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
So, if I understand unschooling (and I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t) it is basically<br/>
making everyday things you do into a &quot;lesson&quot; without ever telling the<br/>
child?  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I would say no to this one. I don&#39;t keep anything from my children, <br/>
and I don&#39;t try to &quot;make&quot; anything into a lesson. My daughter, Lelia just <br/>
gets up every day and lives and follows her own interest, and I try to do the <br/>
same thing. The best &quot;teaching&quot; (and I use that term with a lot of caution) <br/>
that I can do is to be the best person I can be and do what interests me, and <br/>
Lelia will model that. <br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt; It&#39;s being open to what they are interested in at the moment?  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely YES! And try to stay out of the way as much as possible and be a <br/>
facilitator. . .a person who is there to give help when asked and only give <br/>
the help asked for.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Which brings me to another question.  How to teach them spelling, <br/>
vocabulary, phonograms to help them read.  Are there &quot;tools&quot; you do <br/>
use to help them learn? Do you limit their TV/computer game time?  Do<br/>
you go to the library a lot?  I guess I&#39;m just having trouble <br/>
imagineing my kids initiating a &quot;learning experience&quot;!  Does <br/>
unschooling put them behind academically?  I mean, you want them to be<br/>
able to basic adding and subtracting by a certain age and then <br/>
multiplying and dividing by another age, right?  <br/>
<br/>
Actually, I don&#39;t care when they care to read, add, subtract, whatever. I <br/>
have no time tables for them . . . I know that just by living the best life <br/>
they live and doing what they love, they will learn what they need to learn. <br/>
I don&#39;t teach them anything. Lelia is quite a fine writer just be being left <br/>
to write what she finds meaningful to her. I don&#39;t buy into the concept of <br/>
&quot;behind&quot;. I don&#39;t limit TV. . . she seems to limit it herself, and there are <br/>
times she watches quite a bit, and times she watches nothing at all. We go to <br/>
the library almost every week.<br/>
<br/>
For us, unschooling is more  a way of life than a way of school. . . my <br/>
husband and I have the most to unlearn and are working diligently at that. I <br/>
suspect because your mother does the homeschooling that this may be quite <br/>
difficult. I would tend to think she may need to be &quot;fired&quot; for lack of a <br/>
better term if you decide that unschooling is what you choose. The message <br/>
board on this site are a good way to get more ideas. . .they may help you <br/>
figure out if this is what you are looking for. I wish you good luck and many <br/>
blessings in   your journey.<br/>
<br/>
lovemary<br/>
If you wanna make the world a better place, take a look at yourself, and then <br/>
make a change.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, no specific age is required for a specific piece of learning, such as<br/>
multiplication.  I believe in letting kids take their time and learn<br/>
thoroughly.  Learning too soon, for an individual child&#39;s level of<br/>
readiness, creates failure experiences that make learning harder.<br/>
<br/>
I know what follows is going to sound harsh, and I hope you will forgive<br/>
me.  I&#39;m intending it to be eye-opening.  <br/>
<br/>
Forcing kids to do lessons until they hate learning and shudder when one<br/>
offers learning experiences is the most efficient way to put them &quot;behind&quot;<br/>
in life.  It&#39;s a huge handicap to overcome.  <br/>
<br/>
I think our society has some pretty warped ideas about education.  Schools<br/>
seem to operate on the assumptions that school is an assembly line, kids<br/>
are empty tin cans, and the job of the school is to pour the information<br/>
into the empty heads before the conveyor line graduates the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Kids are really good at learning.  Look at how well they learn to speak. <br/>
It&#39;s a really complex job, and they do it without curriculum, just because<br/>
they desire to do it and their parents help them.  I think this is a great<br/>
model for other kinds of learning.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sort of. Kind of..... Not Really.   ;)<br/>
<br/>
Like sewing, (I think boys should learn to sew!), cutting out<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the pattern, cooking and measuring, building a model kit, kite, craft,<br/>
&gt; etc.?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes to all of this.  This is learning and doing ... and doing and learning.<br/>
Sometimes you learn about angles because you want to sew.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s having them being excited about a piece of history they<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; read about and heading to the library to find out more?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The word having in this sentence can be an obstacle though.  Having them be<br/>
excited is not really something you can manufacture.  Sometimes it is, if<br/>
you are passionate about a topic, others can catch that passion for a short<br/>
while and go with it.<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s being<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; open to what they are interested in at the moment?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  ;)  It&#39;s being open to the moment on all levels, and it&#39;s also about<br/>
being open to what you are interested in also.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is without a doubt true. It&#39;s also true that these books contain ideas<br/>
and &quot;facts&quot; that others would not agree with.  One of the best times I&#39;ve<br/>
had while homeschooling was the year we took 3 different history texts and<br/>
compared how they presented the same topics.  We had a secular text, a<br/>
Catholic text and an Abeka text. The differences were a bit scary in places.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For sure I would be tired of this.  For the most part textbooks are horrible<br/>
pieces of writing .  Why buy substandard books when the library is usually<br/>
full of good books?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Which brings me to another question.  How to teach them spelling,<br/>
&gt; vocabulary, phonograms to help them read.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The focus shifts from teaching to learning.  A better question is how will<br/>
they learn?<br/>
<br/>
 Are there &quot;tools&quot; you do<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; use to help them learn?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Everything is a tool.  The sewing machine, the night&#39;s sky, the library, the<br/>
ice cream machine, antique stores.<br/>
<br/>
Do you limit their TV/computer game time?<br/>
<br/>
I do not.  At times I have limited TV because I offered other, more<br/>
wonderful things to do and I offered them just to break our TV habit.... but<br/>
that&#39;s happened 3 times in the last 12 years or so.  I have also offered<br/>
videos and games in order to break the fast pace always going habit that<br/>
we&#39;ve fallen into a couple of times.<br/>
<br/>
 Do<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you go to the library a lot?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We do not, but that&#39;s because my personal book habit rivals the gross<br/>
national product. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m just having trouble<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; imagineing my kids initiating a &quot;learning experience&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What is a learning experience?  Is sking a question a learning experience?<br/>
Your children never ask questions?  Your children never ask to go places?<br/>
Your children never watch a TV show and discuss it?  All of those are<br/>
learning experiences.  Your kids have initated millions of them since the<br/>
day they were born.  You will need to stand back though and watch for a<br/>
while in order to see more clearly.  Our society says only certain kinds of<br/>
questions posed in certain kinds of ways is *school* and therefore<br/>
sanctioned.  This, of course, is bunk, but it takes awhile to see through<br/>
the cage.<br/>
<br/>
 Does<br/>

&gt; able to basic adding and subtracting by a certain age and then<br/>
&gt; multiplying and dividing by another age, right?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Behind what? I&#39;m a 40 year old wife, mother of 4, former paratrooper, former<br/>
midwife, current website manager, writer of 4 articles.  Am I behind other<br/>
40 year olds?  Am I ahead?  Which piece of knowledge makes me *smart*?   I<br/>
know how to palpitate a pregnant woman&#39;s belly and find baby body parts.  Am<br/>
I behind or ahead of a sonogram machine?  I know absolutely nothing about<br/>
ancient Chinese history. Couldn&#39;t spot a Ming vase in a museum. (well okay,<br/>
if they had placards &lt;g&gt;)  Am I behind other 40 year olds?<br/>
<br/>
I have a 9 year old with a vocabulary that regularly impresses others.  He&#39;s<br/>
a hoot to listen to. But he does not yet read fluently.  He&#39;s still at the<br/>
dog/cat stage of the reading game.  Is he behind or ahead of others<br/>
vocabulary wise, since most people assume you must read in order to broaden<br/>
your speaking vocabulary?  I have another child, a daughter, who is so fast<br/>
with mental math her 18 year old sister blushes when she asks for help.<br/>
This child cannot read at all.  Is she behind or ahead?  Matter of fact,<br/>
this 7 year old can work with multiplication and division while her<br/>
subtraction is a bit weak.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is really about that term *you want*.  I want my children to be<br/>
happy, kind, peaceful human beings. I want them to take a look at the whole<br/>
world and choose parts to dive deeply into. I want them to explore their<br/>
gifts and capabilities, their interests and their fears. I don&#39;t want them<br/>
to measure themselves as behind or ahead of another person, but would prefer<br/>
they walk beside others.. I want them to live joyously, laugh often, and<br/>
take care of themselves and the world.</div>

<br/>
&gt; Which brings me to another question.  How to teach them spelling,<br/>
&gt; vocabulary, phonograms to help them read.  Are there &quot;tools&quot; you do<br/>
&gt; use to help them learn?<br/>
<br/>
This is all my opinion...but it&#39;s also based on personal experience.  We<br/>
have a 12 yr old son and have homeschooled him all along.  We also have a 23<br/>
yr old son who we removed from the ps system in the middle of his 8th grade<br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
Initially we followed a typical school program, only did it at home.  We<br/>
used weekly field trips as our reward for accomplishing something for the<br/>
week.  That may work for some, but it did NOT work well for us!  You would<br/>
not believe the fights and struggles to get a teenager to do his homework.<br/>
Eventually I gave up out of desperation and for several years considered<br/>
myself a failure as a mom.<br/>
<br/>
Then I stepped back and looked at what DS was doing.  For starters he was<br/>
reading constantly.  He was also heavily involved in video games.  We<br/>
restrict what type of games are allowed in our home, but there are not many<br/>
restrictions on how much they are played.  Once the game is mastered, the<br/>
kid wants to move on to something else.  Just like reading a book.  The book<br/>
is finished, you revel in how it all went and then look for something else<br/>
to do.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this boy refused to take his GED when I thought he should.  Then he<br/>
needed it for the type of work he decided he wanted to do (electrician), so<br/>
he signed up for the test.  I kept after him to study...with NO luck, of<br/>
course!  The day of the test arrives, he takes it and we wait for the<br/>
results.  Now, I&#39;m certain he is going to fail because we have not done<br/>
anything academic for several years.  The stinker passed the test with<br/>
flying colors the first time!  I hate it when the kid shows me how wrong I<br/>
was.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 Do you limit their TV/computer game time?  Do<br/>
&gt; you go to the library a lot?  I guess I&#39;m just having trouble<br/>
&gt; imagineing my kids initiating a &quot;learning experience&quot;!  Does<br/>
&gt; unschooling put them behind academically?  I mean, you want them to be<br/>
&gt; able to basic adding and subtracting by a certain age and then<br/>
&gt; multiplying and dividing by another age, right?<br/>
<br/>
With DS #2 (age 12 now), we have been relaxed about our schooling all along.<br/>
I wish I could say I was wise enough to realize he&#39;d learn from life, but<br/>
the reality is that my health problems keep me from pursuing a formal<br/>
academic education.  I never know from one day (hour really!) to the next<br/>
how I&#39;m going to be feeling.  So, year after year we just don&#39;t &#39;get around&#39;<br/>
to much formal education.<br/>
<br/>
The results?  He&#39;s reading at a college level.  Isn&#39;t at all interested in<br/>
youth books (with the exception of Harry Potter, but DH and I love them,<br/>
too), but devours adult books.  We are often reading the same series as a<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
Math?  He was doing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division<br/>
before he was 6.  For quite a while he had to figure the answer out rather<br/>
than having it memorized, but that tells me he knows how to use his brain to<br/>
think things through.  Plus, I firmly believe that if someone has to work<br/>
for the answer they will always remember it!<br/>
<br/>
One &#39;difficulty&#39; we had is friends and relatives quizzing him.  What&#39;s 2X2?<br/>
How do you spell....?  That sort of thing.  This gave DS some frustration<br/>
for a while because he didn&#39;t know the answer as fast as the friend/relative<br/>
thought he should.  What we were eventually able to show him is that he knew<br/>
the answer or how to find it, but the friend/relative had used a different<br/>
language to ask the question.  For instance if they had asked him what is 2<br/>
two&#39;s, he&#39;d have known.  I still get busy body relatives wanting to give me<br/>
teaching aids so I can bring him up to grade level.  But it only takes a<br/>
little real interaction with him to know he&#39;s doing just fine.  IMO knowing<br/>
how to find the answer and being willing to make the effort is at least as<br/>
important as having answers already memorized.  Maybe more important.  Most<br/>
of life doesn&#39;t come with packaged answers.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve strayed from the question!  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Do I care what age he reads, writes or multiplies?  Heck no!  It will come<br/>
when he&#39;s ready or has a need for it.<br/>
<br/>
An example...recently he accepted a challenge from his sunday school teacher<br/>
to read his scriptures every day and write his thoughts in a journal.  At<br/>
first he was having a very difficult time with the writing and felt his<br/>
skills were low.  But because it was important to him, he kept at it day<br/>
after day.  This was a goal he accepted.  I refuse to nag him about it.<br/>
It&#39;s his goal, it&#39;s his responsibility.  I will encourage him.  Tell him<br/>
good job for accomplishing his goal.  Maybe even brag about how well he is<br/>
keeping to a goal he chose.  I will help him spell and I even delay bedtime<br/>
when I&#39;m tired so he can finish the task he has set for himself.  (There are<br/>
limits to this...I have legitimate needs, too, and sleep is one of them!)<br/>
<br/>
Well, almost 6 months later, he&#39;s still reading and writing daily and has<br/>
not missed a single day!  His writing skills have improved simply because he<br/>
practiced.  His spelling skills have also improved because of practice.  In<br/>
the beginning I had to help him figure out how to spell a LOT of words each<br/>
day.  Now we go for days without his asking me how to spell something.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine what a struggle it would have been for both of us if I tried<br/>
to impose a goal I had created on him.  I&#39;ve been there, done that with the<br/>
oldest son.  It was not fun and he still did just fine in spite of my<br/>
interferance.<br/>
<br/>
With spelling, I ask DS  how he thinks it&#39;s spelled.  He usually can spell<br/>
it like it sounds, which means I can read what he&#39;s written.  Since the<br/>
primary purpose of writing is either to help the writer remember something<br/>
or to communicate a thought to another, he meets the need either way.  So, I<br/>
have him write it out and then I read it out loud to him, showing him that I<br/>
can read it.  This has built his confidence in his abilities.  With<br/>
confidence he had the nerve to try more and harder words.  Since he reads so<br/>
much, he now will see a word and recognize it&#39;s not right.  So, he tries<br/>
again until he&#39;s satisfied or decides it&#39;s not that important for that word<br/>
at this time.  It is working well for us.<br/>
<br/>
Moral of this long story is trust yourself and trust your children.  If it<br/>
feels good for your family, follow that path.  I&#39;m firmly convinced that no<br/>
one is able to truly be lazy.  It is human nature to be doing something!<br/>
Boredom is a signal of the need to engage in some activity.  Left to their<br/>
own devices every one will find something to do.  It may look like not much,<br/>
but they will be doing something.  Expose your children to the life.  Don&#39;t<br/>
be afraid to include things that are important to you.  They&#39;ll become<br/>
involved.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes down to it, who cares whether they learned to multiply when<br/>
they were 8 or 30?!  For that matter, many people use a calculator.  If they<br/>
never learned to multiply it wouldn&#39;t be the end of the world.  It might be<br/>
inconvenient, but it wouldn&#39;t be the end of the world.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s still all book stuff.  All the way from reading something in a book to <br/>
going to the library for another book is a small slice of the world.  There <br/>
is history outside of books--in antique stores, in buildings themselves, old <br/>
roadbeds, old trucks, old trees and bridges, museums, movies, music, art, etc.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How to teach them spelling, <br/>
vocabulary, phonograms to help them read.  Are there &quot;tools&quot; you do <br/>
use to help them learn?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not schoolish kinds of tools.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you limit their TV/computer game time?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t.  Life limits it, they limit it, but we don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you go to the library a lot?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t, but if we didn&#39;t own many thousands of books ourselves we might.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I guess I&#39;m just having trouble <br/>
imagineing my kids initiating a &quot;learning experience&quot;! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I recommend that you go to www.unschooling.com and read everything that even <br/>
vaguely interests you.  What you&#39;re expecting is for kids to spontaneously be <br/>
schoolish, I think.  When your expectations and understandings change you&#39;ll <br/>
see LOTS of learning.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Does unschooling put them behind academically?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most of the kids at school are behind academically.  <br/>
Most school work repeats for three years, at least.  Kids learn it once, and <br/>
so on the second repeat some kids are ignoring it because they already know <br/>
it, and others are ignoring it because they know there&#39;ll be a third repeat <br/>
(if not fifth and seventh).<br/>
<br/>
My kids are ahead in some ways and behind in some ways, but they are exactly <br/>
where they are.  So are kids at school, but the kids at school are being <br/>
pressured and shamed and &quot;graded&quot; and teased and my kids aren&#39;t getting any <br/>
of that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I mean, you want them to be<br/>
able to basic adding and subtracting by a certain age and then <br/>
multiplying and dividing by another age, right?  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  I want them to be able to do all that by the time they are grown.  <br/>
They&#39;ve figured it all out on their own or by asking questions.  Holly <br/>
divides in her head.  She wouldn&#39;t know how to set up a long division problem <br/>
on paper, but she can divide in her head better than most adults I know (by <br/>
whatever system she uses, it&#39;s none of my business--she just does it), and <br/>
she can use a calculator too.  She&#39;s nine.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Making everyday life school&quot; is not my goal.  My goal is to allow my <br/>
children the opportunity to avoid &quot;school&quot; altogether, not find more school <br/>
outside of schools.  <br/>
<br/>
What they do is learn from everyday life.<br/>
