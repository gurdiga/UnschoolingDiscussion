<div id="ygrps-yiv-299649320">Wow!  That&#39;s my first reaction to finding this group.  I came on just a few <br/>
posts before Valerie&#39;s first post about her daughter and I&#39;ve never felt so <br/>
validated about what has happened around here than I did after reading that. <br/>
  Thank you!!<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;ll give you a quick intro of myself.  I&#39;m the mother of 3 children - <br/>
1 daughter, 21 and 2 boys 18 & 13.  The first 2 did traditional school.  My <br/>
21 yr old is graduating from college this year and my 18 yo is graduating <br/>
from high school.  But due to a very bad 7th grade year for my now 13 yo we <br/>
opted to not send him back to Jr High (the horror grade level of public <br/>
school, in my opinion) and we were planning on doing a traditional <br/>
home-schooling program this past year.  Well, it didn&#39;t happen.  For several <br/>
reasons... the big one being his attitude about being pressured and also the <br/>
fact that I work 32 hrs/week (4 days).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we played with history books, and bought math books and everything <br/>
ended up sliding and we just ended up enjoying each other.  His personality <br/>
has improved 100% and his self-esteem at least that much.  But all along <br/>
I&#39;ve had to deal with the question... &quot;So, how&#39;s that homeschooling coming?&quot; <br/>
from the people I work with and with family members.  And trying to explain <br/>
that we&#39;re not is really difficult.<br/>
<br/>
I had to convince myself that I wasn&#39;t going to worry about what he did and <br/>
didn&#39;t do and if we got nothing else out of this year but him feeling better <br/>
and behaving better I could call it successful.  Well, as the &quot;school&quot; year <br/>
rolls down I&#39;m seeing that it was successful.  But convincing his older <br/>
siblings of that is tough. (My dd is graduating with a bachelors in <br/>
Psychology and works with troubled children so she knows &quot;everything&quot; about <br/>
how we&#39;re doing this all wrong).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for making me feel good about this and for being here.  I know <br/>
I&#39;ll have a ton of questions as I get to know everyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428349180">Welcome Jean Marie,<br/>
<br/>
Well, your post gave me a few tears! Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
The Psychology line gave me a laugh. I was taking an Adolescent <br/>
Psychology class in college last year. The professor learned early on <br/>
that I was outspoken and a bit of a class clown. Those college <br/>
students are so uptight...afraid to say a word. I would try to loosen <br/>
them up a bit. Well, he was discussing the PROPER way to parent a <br/>
child and I disagreed with him. I told him what I had done and he <br/>
laughed and said in a very sarcastic tone, &quot;I can only imagine how <br/>
your child turned out.&quot; It just so happens that we had gotten the <br/>
Annuals that day. There were two full pages devoted to Laurie and her <br/>
unschooling and accomplishments in college. I reached down and pulled <br/>
out the book and opened it to those pages and said, &quot;That&#39;s her.&quot; He <br/>
looked for a brief second, looked into my face, and started to speak <br/>
a few times. I think I noticed a twitch. lol...  he then went back to <br/>
teaching, but his voice sounded a bit different. One of the <br/>
highlights of college for me!!!<br/>

<br/>
     Hi Jeanmarie and welcome...I can relate to what you&#39;re saying somewhat <br/>
because we didn&#39;t start of as unschoolers.  First we became disallusioned <br/>
with the school system, then we went to homeschooling, and finally we went to <br/>
unschooling.  I WISH we had unschooled from the beginning with all of our <br/>
kids.  The more structured homeschooling always &quot;deteriorated&quot; into doing <br/>
whatever because I wasn&#39;t that motivated to stick with much of a structure.  <br/>
But I used to feel like I should be doing &quot;better&quot; with all of that.  <br/>
Finally, I started reading more unschooling books and realized that it seemed <br/>
like the best thing.  All the other stuff involved too much forcing of kids <br/>
to do something they don&#39;t want to do.<br/>
     So my oldest three sons, ages (almost) 17, 13, and 13, have been <br/>
unschooling the past few years and my younger two, ages 9 and 4, will get to <br/>
unschool completely.  I hope school and my misguided homeschooling attempts <br/>
in years past haven&#39;t caused too much harm to my older kids!<br/>
     Anyway, maybe you can just tell people the homeschooling is coming <br/>
around wonderfully.  Now you don&#39;t have to feel that you&#39;re not doing <br/>
anything; you&#39;re unschooling, letting him find his own rightful path, doing <br/>
things he&#39;s interested in, which he&#39;s much more likely to remember anyway.<br/>
     In case you haven&#39;t already read it, I would highly recommend reading <br/>
The Teenage Liberation Handbook by Grace Llewellyn (sp?).  It&#39;s great and he <br/>
might like reading some of it, too.  And of course, when Val&#39;s book comes <br/>
out, it will be great!  Best wishes....<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m way behind reading my posts. But I laughed when I saw the above. How<br/>
about nicely telling your daughter that you&#39;ll let her ruin her own children<br/>
if she&#39;ll let you ruin yours?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871710477">At your suggestion, I will find a place for that story in the book.<br/>
<br/>
Smile at your parents and assure them that you are doing the right <br/>
thing. Or just smile. That&#39;s what I did with mine. (while I was <br/>
ruining my daughter&#39;s life). It&#39;s more than possible that your son <br/>
can grow up to be functional. It&#39;s probable if he&#39;s unschooled. I <br/>
don&#39;t know how old your son is, but there were years when Laurie did <br/>
as little as possible. I kept the faith open and my mouth shut. When <br/>
he finds his passion, he&#39;ll put forth the effort necessary, and it <br/>
won&#39;t even seem like effort to him. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe if your son is given the freedom to choose how he spends his <br/>
time he won&#39;t end up a being like the members of the family who had <br/>
no choices early in life. Support ANYTHING he does, including playing <br/>
computer games all day, watching tv, whatever... it&#39;s what he needs <br/>
right now and if he has support and no &quot;comments&quot; about wasting his <br/>
life, he&#39;ll get past it much faster. <br/>
<br/>
AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH to kids needing to be teased so they can deal with it <br/>
when they are older. AAAAAGGGGGHHHHHH to the morons that say such <br/>
things. Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will kill <br/>
me. I STILL remember the teasing taunts of childhood and vow to <br/>
someday get back at those creeps! Calm down Valerie...I am teasing <br/>
about getting them back, btw. I&#39;ll just let them shine my shoes. <br/>
<br/>
Not to be totally insensitive...but I bet flotsom is not useless.;-)<br/>
I had to say that since Laurie acted in her first play last week at <br/>
the college. She co-wrote the play and was marvelous!<br/>
<br/>
And in reply to being pilloried... damn it...do nothing and watch him <br/>
bloom and take charge of his own life. <br/>

&gt;about nicely telling your daughter &gt;that you&#39;ll let her ruin her own <br/>

children.!!!  Of course, she&#39;s only 21 and has a lot of growing up to do <br/>
yet.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I was able to give you a laugh, though!  .... And I thought I was <br/>
the only Jeanmarie around.  My parent&#39;s always told me it was unique.  <br/>
Hmmph, there goes that bubble!!!!<br/>

***If it makes you feel better, my sister&#39;s name is Jean Marie (Marie being<br/>
the middle name) and we call her Jean. Only our mother calls her Jean Marie<br/>
sometimes, and you know what it means when she does...<br/>

  My sister actually told me that I am too opinionated about children so she<br/>
can&#39;t have any!!!  I think she is afraid I won&#39;t approve of how she will<br/>
raise them.  Afterall, if she doesn&#39;t attachment parent, nurse, unschool,<br/>
etc. then she won&#39;t be doing it right!   LOL   I think she just has to find<br/>
her own path and also find out what she is passionate about.  I am<br/>
passionate about kids, esp. my own.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, of course, that explains it.  When I was growing up I used to have <br/>
people always ask me if my name was French.  It&#39;s not... it was my parent&#39;s <br/>
way of making two families happy.<br/>
<br/>
Jean - my father&#39;s sister, + marie (Mary) my mother&#39;s sister.  At first it <br/>
was two words, but my mother DID NOT want me called Jean.  Hmmmmm <br/>
interesting, huh???!!  LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s how I got my name!<br/>

Oh wow.. I bet that takes some time to get over...I have faith in <br/>
your patience. I had to ignore my parents. They meant well, but I had <br/>
a path to follow that did not include nagging Laurie to &quot;do <br/>
