<br/>
If you&#39;re looking for an area to school in, an unschooling list isn&#39;t  <br/>
your best source.<br/>
Unschoolers don&#39;t &quot;school&quot; at all, and learning isn&#39;t limited to a room.<br/>
<br/>
Can you make a room for games or projects?  A lego room?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You could look on regular homeschooling sites and look for &quot;home  <br/>
school rooms&quot; or something, if you&#39;re determined to have a room.  Can  <br/>
it be an office for the kids with a computer and a TV and lots of art  <br/>
supplies and reference stuff?<br/>
<br/>
Is your question more about what kinds of things you might want to  <br/>
gather up at your house?  We recently got a  microscope and it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t have a permanent place to live yet.  (Might not get one,  <br/>
either.)  We have a globe, but it&#39;s getting outdated.   We have maps  <br/>
and posters, but we put them up in otherwise public rooms, various  <br/>
places, and switch them out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265927539">We just use the whole house.  We have a family room (converted from a garage) that is filled with electronic stuff (4 computers, stereo, TV & multi video games... we need another tv in there so there&#39;s less conflict with the video games).  Then we have a livingroom filled with bookshelves, a tv, and room to do projects.   When we originally started homeschooling we were a &quot;school at home&quot; family (yuck, I know )  &  the garage was going to be used as the &quot;school room&quot; but that plan changed.<br/>
We just decorated it as we would the rest of the house.  I probably didnt help much but thats what we did.  Maybe you could ask the kids what they would like ........ heck maybe they would want to do it themselves !!<br/>
Good luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-161960688">&quot;We just use the whole house.  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
After reading this I realized I worded it wrong :(  We don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; school.  My kids use the whole house to do whatever they are into at the moment.  Lots of people have asked where do we &quot;do&quot; school & to save alot explaining to people that don&#39;t understand unschooling I just tell them &quot;oh wherever we are comfortable&quot;.  They expect us to have a sit down classroom complete with desks & chalkboards.<br/>
<br/>
How do others here deal with this situation when it comes up?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow...we don&#39;t &quot;school&quot; any more.  But this is the time of year I<br/>
start to feel claustrophobic in my home, though, and start organizing<br/>
and rearranging, and like the &quot;idea&quot; of a place for all the stuff the<br/>
children use.<br/>
<br/>
We do have a room we call the school room which is our &quot;dining room&quot;,<br/>
but it is really the storage-of-all-things-cool-and-our-critters room.<br/>
 It has bookshelves along one wall, and an old dining room table<br/>
against a wall, and and an old desk under the window.  Oh, and an old<br/>
coffee table.  The lizard lives on the old coffee table, the beta fish<br/>
lives on top of the row of bookshelves next to the globe, and the<br/>
hermit crabs live on the desk.  The walls have maps and posters and<br/>
cool charts and museum prints on them, that I rotate out as I get more<br/>
cool wall stuff.<br/>
<br/>
The bookshelves all have cool books on them about everything and<br/>
anything.  One shelf has some games.  Bins hold our dice collection,<br/>
the pattern blocks we just bought, and there is a cheapy microscope. <br/>
<br/>
We have a rolling cart that has all the art supplies, too.<br/>
<br/>
But the computers and such are in a different room, and we just take<br/>
what we need out of the school room to wherever we need it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-333966360">We have a homeschool room in our house. It is in our<br/>
third bedroom. We live in a 3 bedroom townhouse so<br/>
that was the easiest place for us to put it. I don&#39;t<br/>
have pictures as this time so I will describe it to<br/>
the best of my ability. <br/>
<br/>
On the South wall we have a window just to the right<br/>
of the middle of the wall. On the left we have the<br/>
Math area. I bought punch out 2&quot; letters at a teachers<br/>
supply store to label each subject area. The math area<br/>
we use 2&quot; letters that are orange. I have a number<br/>
chart that goes up to 100 that I laminated on the wall<br/>
under the word math. I used thumbtacks to put in on<br/>
the wall. To the left of the chart I found a poster<br/>
again at a teachers supply store that I laminated of<br/>
different shapes - square, circle, octagon, etc. I<br/>
then cut out each shape and thumbtacked each one up.<br/>
Under these I have a shelf thing I bought at Bed Bath<br/>
& Beyond for $9.99. It is supposed to be used in a<br/>
closet for shoes. Here is a link that I found though<br/>
it is a lot more in cost.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.acehardwareoutlet.com/(">http://www.acehardwareoutlet.com/(</a>1vcb5c45m1anno55giivng34)/LargeImage.aspx?SKU=52692&Image=52692h.jpg&ProdDescription=LARGE%20SHOE%20STACKER%20SHELF%20HORZNTL%20STACK%2012%22<br/>
<br/>
I bought two of these for the math area and just<br/>
stacked them on top of each other. The middle shelf<br/>
thing you see I didn&#39;t put it there on the 2nd one<br/>
that sits on the bottom. I screwed it in to make on<br/>
big rectangle piece. The shelf can either be put where<br/>
you see it in the picture or at the bottom area- at<br/>
least the ones I bought you can. <br/>
<br/>
To the right of the math area under the window I have<br/>
a plastic 3 drawer thing that rolls (though we don&#39;t<br/>
roll it out) that I put paint with water books in (top<br/>
drawer) coloring books (2nd drawer) and plain paper<br/>
(3rd drawer - is just plain printer paper I buy at<br/>
Walmart for $12 a box which is 3000 sheets of paper).<br/>
Then to the right of this is 2 black filing cabinets<br/>
which I put our work to be done in for each week and<br/>
other stuff needed to be filed. Then to the right of<br/>
this I have an old sewing table (where the sewing<br/>
machine would flip up from inside though it&#39;s no<br/>
longer there) to put my dvd, vcr and small 13&quot; tv on<br/>
so we can watch any educational movies with. I use the<br/>
library all of the time. We just finished studying the<br/>
letter E and I also borrowed movies about Elephants<br/>
both non fiction and fiction. I could use the elephant<br/>
movies for science though I don&#39;t. Under this table is<br/>
where I keep a plastic bin that holds our books that<br/>
will be used for homeschool and our vcr and dvds.  <br/>
<br/>
Then there is the West Wall. Right next to the tv area<br/>
is a closet door where I store most of our homeschool<br/>
craft supplies, extra educational items, easel papers,<br/>
recycleable items to make crafts with, homeschool<br/>
books that were bought in advance for next year, etc. <br/>
To the right of this is our Social Studies area. I<br/>
used 2&quot; red punch out letters for this area. I Have a<br/>
bulletin board underneath the word Social Studies.<br/>
Then underneath this I have another shelf thing like<br/>
in the Math area. To the right of the shelf on the<br/>
floor I have a globe 9nothing to sit it on yet) The<br/>
rest of the wall is left plain to hang up any maps,<br/>
etc for what we are learning at that time. To the<br/>
right of this a bit is our door to enter the room. We<br/>
keep the door open at all times where I have our blank<br/>
calendar up on it. I again bought a calendar at a<br/>
teachers supply store that just has the days across it<br/>
and laminated it. I then bought another poster that I<br/>
laminated that had the months on it and cut them out<br/>
to use for each month that I  put above the calendar.<br/>
I also bought calendar dates (this month has a snowman<br/>
on each date- last month had turkeys) and laminated<br/>
them. I then use rubber glue to have my daughter<br/>
&quot;attatch&quot; them onto the calendar. I love this method<br/>
as the rubber glue comes off so easily. <br/>
<br/>
Right outside the door I have a 4 drawer dresser where<br/>
we put extra supplies in. <br/>
<br/>
On the North wall we have the Language Arts/Reading<br/>
area where I used blue 2&quot; punch out letters for. I<br/>
have two bulletin boards here - one next to each other<br/>
- pretty large ones that were bought at Walmart for<br/>
$7.?? each. Maybe around $8. I have a laminated poster<br/>
of each letter above the bulletin boards. Underneath<br/>
the left bulletin board I again have a shelf thing as<br/>
in the math area. To the right of the shelf a bit I<br/>
have a 3 drawer very small thing that we hold our<br/>
extra craft projects my daughter is working on by<br/>
herself. Then to the right I have a Little Tikes blue<br/>
easel for painting. Underneath it is a vinyl<br/>
tablecloth folded up to cover the floor from paint.<br/>
The tablecloth was bought at Walmart for around $2.38.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then the East wall has our Science area which is done<br/>
in 2&quot; green letters. A bulletin board is underneath<br/>
with again a shelf thing under that. I have a poster<br/>
that I laminated and cut up with a picture of each<br/>
color with its name to the left of the bulletin board.<br/>
I have room around the bulletin board on each side to<br/>
hang posters, etc for what we are working on. <br/>
<br/>
In the middle of the room is our table. It is a U<br/>
shaped wood table that I received for free that we<br/>
use. We bought our chairs (2) from a big teachers<br/>
supply store. They were expensive at around $22 each<br/>
but I wanted them to have a nice chair to sit on. <br/>
<br/>
Our walls are an off white color and we just have<br/>
carpet on the floor. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps you somewhat. Sorry this is so<br/>
lengthy but I also looked for ideas on the internet<br/>
but it was basically no help. I will say the one thing<br/>
that has been a huge huge help to us was to have each<br/>
subject sectioned off from each other. I did find one<br/>
homeschool room where the mom had put social studies<br/>
and bible study mixed in together and to me it made it<br/>
so confusing. If I was to do bible study also I would<br/>
put it in it&#39;s own section. <br/>
<br/>
Take care and if you have any questions please feel<br/>
free to email me! <br/>

that unschoolers use the whole house, whole yard, whole world--a <br/>
landscape not a room. It appeared in _Life Learning Magazine_ March/ <br/>
April &#39;05.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000344981">In one house we had a big room in the center of the house that we called  the <br/>
library.  We kept the books in it.  All the craft stuff and lego  stuff and a <br/>
computer or two were in there, too.<br/>
 <br/>
In this house we have a studio and a music room.  We&#39;ve always had an  <br/>
&quot;office&quot; in all our homes, but that doesn&#39;t apply so much since we have mostly  <br/>
laptops now.  In this house the room that was the &quot;office&#39; is now the music  room <br/>
where we keep our guitars and ukes and electronic piano.  The network  hub is <br/>
in there, too, and this room is about to be renovated and will be much  <br/>
changed from it&#39;s current configuration, although it will have musical stuff in  it.<br/>
 <br/>
My 21 yo and his girlfriend are living in the studio temporarily.  We  just <br/>
got through renovating it, and part of it will still be a craft  room/flexible <br/>
space, and the other part will have the exercise equipment and  hang-out space <br/>
once my son moves out.  <br/>
 <br/>
What I really want o do is consolidate all the  <br/>
electronics/office/running-of-the-house stuff into one tiny little corner.   The network hub, the telephone <br/>
base, the files and bills, the fax machine, the  printer...all that in one <br/>
little corner.  We should be able to print on the  network and use the fax as <br/>
needed that way.  Then the craft room will be  flexible space for doing whatever <br/>
project needs to be done in heated space, and  it will be the place where <br/>
things can be stored and left unfinished.  While  the rest of the studio would <br/>
have TV and couches and etc.  The music room  will have the instruments, plus a <br/>
configuration for playing them,  and places to read.  That room is off the <br/>
living room via a wide  double door, so those rooms would be used simultaneously <br/>
or separately.  <br/>
 <br/>
So that&#39;s a lot of detail to say that we do things all over the house and  we <br/>
don&#39;t need a &quot;school&quot; room because we don&#39;t do &quot;school&quot;.  But we do need  <br/>
lots of other rooms for purposes of living and eating and learning, and that&#39;s  <br/>
how I intend to use my space.  <br/>
 <br/>
I loved the library in the middle of the old house.  We could trash it  and <br/>
then shut the doors and then all the rest of the house could be kept pick  up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923633491">For a minute I thought I had my lists confused!!  This is certainly not<br/>
descriptive of an unschooling family. Been there, done that in our<br/>
curriculum days!  And I&#39;m so glad those days are gone!  Currently our old<br/>
&#39;school room&#39; (yes, we did have a school room in those days) is my husband&#39;s<br/>
art studio/library.  Lots of interesting stuff (he works with found objects,<br/>
so you never know what you&#39;ll find) and lots of opportunity for talking,<br/>
connecting, experimenting and just hanging out. It&#39;s not unusual to find one<br/>
of our kids or  neighbor kids down there creating a masterpiece or just<br/>
watching and talking. I can&#39;t think of a better use of a &#39;school room&#39;.<br/>
Every room in our home has fun, interesting things to do and explore. We<br/>
have lots of computers, a few tvs, game systems, movies, tons of books, lots<br/>
of games, a couple of microscopes, binoculars, craft supplies, I could go on<br/>
and on.  Stuff is everywhere and changes &#39;homes&#39; depending on who&#39;s<br/>
interested in what at any given time. We are fortunate to have a couple of<br/>
vehicles and drivers to go exploring. We are not limited to a room or space<br/>
or a time or a grade or a..whatever.  The room described sounds so limiting<br/>
to me, and from experience I can say it was very limiting when we had one.<br/>
Talk about confusing! Where do you sit when you are reading about the<br/>
history of science?! The reading area? Or history? or Science?  And if<br/>
studying a time period leads to an interest in the art of the time...now<br/>
what?! Life is not segmented into neat compartments, everything is connected<br/>
and related and makes so much more sense when explored in a setting that<br/>
allows for drifting from one aspect to another to another..<br/>

Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Homeschool rooms<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have a homeschool room in our house. It is in our<br/>
third bedroom. We live in a 3 bedroom townhouse so<br/>
that was the easiest place for us to put it. I don&#39;t<br/>
have pictures as this time so I will describe it to<br/>
the best of my ability. <br/>
<br/>
On the South wall we have a window just to the right<br/>
of the middle of the wall. On the left we have the<br/>
Math area. I bought punch out 2&quot; letters at a teachers<br/>
supply store to label each subject area. The math area<br/>
we use 2&quot; letters that are orange. I have a number<br/>
chart that goes up to 100 that I laminated on the wall<br/>
under the word math. I used thumbtacks to put in on<br/>
the wall. To the left of the chart I found a poster<br/>
again at a teachers supply store that I laminated of<br/>
different shapes - square, circle, octagon, etc. I<br/>
then cut out each shape and thumbtacked each one up.<br/>
Under these I have a shelf thing I bought at Bed Bath<br/>
& Beyond for $9.99. It is supposed to be used in a<br/>
closet for shoes. Here is a link that I found though<br/>
it is a lot more in cost.<br/>

<br/>
I bought two of these for the math area and just<br/>
stacked them on top of each other. The middle shelf<br/>
thing you see I didn&#39;t put it there on the 2nd one<br/>
that sits on the bottom. I screwed it in to make on<br/>
big rectangle piece. The shelf can either be put where<br/>
you see it in the picture or at the bottom area- at<br/>
least the ones I bought you can. <br/>
<br/>
To the right of the math area under the window I have<br/>
a plastic 3 drawer thing that rolls (though we don&#39;t<br/>
roll it out) that I put paint with water books in (top<br/>
drawer) coloring books (2nd drawer) and plain paper<br/>
(3rd drawer - is just plain printer paper I buy at<br/>
Walmart for $12 a box which is 3000 sheets of paper).<br/>
Then to the right of this is 2 black filing cabinets<br/>
which I put our work to be done in for each week and<br/>
other stuff needed to be filed. Then to the right of<br/>
this I have an old sewing table (where the sewing<br/>
machine would flip up from inside though it&#39;s no<br/>
longer there) to put my dvd, vcr and small 13&quot; tv on<br/>
so we can watch any educational movies with. I use the<br/>
library all of the time. We just finished studying the<br/>
letter E and I also borrowed movies about Elephants<br/>
both non fiction and fiction. I could use the elephant<br/>
movies for science though I don&#39;t. Under this table is<br/>
where I keep a plastic bin that holds our books that<br/>
will be used for homeschool and our vcr and dvds.  <br/>
<br/>
Then there is the West Wall. Right next to the tv area<br/>
is a closet door where I store most of our homeschool<br/>
craft supplies, extra educational items, easel papers,<br/>
recycleable items to make crafts with, homeschool<br/>
books that were bought in advance for next year, etc. <br/>
To the right of this is our Social Studies area. I<br/>
used 2&quot; red punch out letters for this area. I Have a<br/>
bulletin board underneath the word Social Studies.<br/>
Then underneath this I have another shelf thing like<br/>
in the Math area. To the right of the shelf on the<br/>
floor I have a globe 9nothing to sit it on yet) The<br/>
rest of the wall is left plain to hang up any maps,<br/>
etc for what we are learning at that time. To the<br/>
right of this a bit is our door to enter the room. We<br/>
keep the door open at all times where I have our blank<br/>
calendar up on it. I again bought a calendar at a<br/>
teachers supply store that just has the days across it<br/>
and laminated it. I then bought another poster that I<br/>
laminated that had the months on it and cut them out<br/>
to use for each month that I  put above the calendar.<br/>
I also bought calendar dates (this month has a snowman<br/>
on each date- last month had turkeys) and laminated<br/>
them. I then use rubber glue to have my daughter<br/>
&quot;attatch&quot; them onto the calendar. I love this method<br/>
as the rubber glue comes off so easily. <br/>
<br/>
Right outside the door I have a 4 drawer dresser where<br/>
we put extra supplies in. <br/>
<br/>
On the North wall we have the Language Arts/Reading<br/>
area where I used blue 2&quot; punch out letters for. I<br/>
have two bulletin boards here - one next to each other<br/>
- pretty large ones that were bought at Walmart for<br/>
$7.?? each. Maybe around $8. I have a laminated poster<br/>
of each letter above the bulletin boards. Underneath<br/>
the left bulletin board I again have a shelf thing as<br/>
in the math area. To the right of the shelf a bit I<br/>
have a 3 drawer very small thing that we hold our<br/>
extra craft projects my daughter is working on by<br/>
herself. Then to the right I have a Little Tikes blue<br/>
easel for painting. Underneath it is a vinyl<br/>
tablecloth folded up to cover the floor from paint.<br/>
The tablecloth was bought at Walmart for around $2.38.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then the East wall has our Science area which is done<br/>
in 2&quot; green letters. A bulletin board is underneath<br/>
with again a shelf thing under that. I have a poster<br/>
that I laminated and cut up with a picture of each<br/>
color with its name to the left of the bulletin board.<br/>
I have room around the bulletin board on each side to<br/>
hang posters, etc for what we are working on. <br/>
<br/>
In the middle of the room is our table. It is a U<br/>
shaped wood table that I received for free that we<br/>
use. We bought our chairs (2) from a big teachers<br/>
supply store. They were expensive at around $22 each<br/>
but I wanted them to have a nice chair to sit on. <br/>
<br/>
Our walls are an off white color and we just have<br/>
carpet on the floor. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps you somewhat. Sorry this is so<br/>
lengthy but I also looked for ideas on the internet<br/>
but it was basically no help. I will say the one thing<br/>
that has been a huge huge help to us was to have each<br/>
subject sectioned off from each other. I did find one<br/>
homeschool room where the mom had put social studies<br/>
and bible study mixed in together and to me it made it<br/>
so confusing. If I was to do bible study also I would<br/>
put it in it&#39;s own section. <br/>
<br/>
Take care and if you have any questions please feel<br/>
free to email me! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448881346">I&#39;m enjoying this thread even though we don&#39;t have a school room. <br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to get my kids out of the mentality that learning <br/>
happens in a designated room. <br/>
My kids enjoy reading so we have floor to ceiling book shelves, with <br/>
a window seat (that has books shelves under it) between them in our <br/>
family room. In that room is also two of our three computers and our <br/>
PS2. We also have a globe and some maps in there. <br/>
Our VCR and DVD player are in the living room so any movies that we <br/>
watch, we do it in there. <br/>
Art & crafts stuff is done all over (inside and out...I bought a <br/>
picnic table for outside so they can do stuff out there also) but <br/>
the supplies are stored in the laundry room. <br/>
Cooking we do in the kitchen or the BBQ. Physical stuff is usually <br/>
done outside.  <br/>

This may be fun, and your child might be having a good time, but this  <br/>
is not unschooling.  Someone young enough not to know what an E is  <br/>
isn&#39;t likely to suffer much confusion from a mom who thinks Bible  <br/>
should be separate from social studies (or the letter E, or animals  <br/>
or math), but as he builds his own model of the universe in his own  <br/>
head, his categories probably won&#39;t look like yours, and having  <br/>
categories in the first place prevents many connections the child  <br/>
(and the mom) would make if she didn&#39;t want to have Bible separate  <br/>
from other things.  The more thing you can connect, the more you will  <br/>
know and understand.  The more things you keep separate (in your  <br/>
mind, in your categorizations), the more klunky your thinking will be.</div>

DON&#39;T do! With unschooling, as Sandra says, &quot;Everything&#39;s <br/>
connected!!&quot; If you can&#39;t see the connection between &quot;social <br/>
studies&quot; and &quot;bible studies&quot; then you have a long way to go to get <br/>
to unschooling. If you are studying, say, Marie Curie...is that <br/>
history? Or science? Maybe women&#39;s studies?!? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My son and i watched a great documentary about Shackleton&#39;s ill-<br/>
fated attempt to reach Antarctica (they didnt make it...but none of <br/>
his men died.)...i thinkit was called The Endurance...that led us to <br/>
talk about why it was so amazing that this documentary actually <br/>
included real film footage, the ethics of them having to kill their <br/>
sleddogs, looking up the islands where they landed on our big map. <br/>
Looking at the map got us talking about continents, and what they <br/>
were, which got me talking somehow about my trip to Russia in high <br/>
school, and how it was then called the USSR, what countries were <br/>
part of that, how certain places underwent name changes afterward, <br/>
etc etc. <br/>
<br/>
How the heck do you catagorize THAT?!?<br/>

Have to confess though that some of our best learning moments happen <br/>
on the loo! My partner built a bookcase thingy for storing magazines <br/>
and books next to the toilet. Most useful bit of carpentry he&#39;s done <br/>

&gt; &gt; start to feel claustrophobic in my home, though, and start organizing<br/>

 </span></blockquote>EW!  Did I really say that?  A place for all the stuff the children<br/>
use???  EW!<br/>
<br/>
I use all that stuff too; it isn&#39;t just stuff the kids use!  I love to<br/>
spin the globe, and play with the dice, and do craft projects and flip<br/>
through all the cool books and watch the critters in their little<br/>
habitats do their things.<br/>
<br/>
Our &quot;stuff room&quot; is for the whole family, not just &quot;educational&quot; stuff<br/>
for the kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I feel a little better for clarifying that!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742027166">My kids love the ocean and anything aquatic.  We painted ours with <br/>
sponge painting and about 4 different shades of ocean blues.  I used <br/>
darker blues on my sons side because he likes sharks and things that <br/>
swim in the deep and lighter colors on my daughters side because she <br/>
likes sea turtles and dolphins in the shallower waters.  It was fun <br/>
and really turned out cute.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146108554">I&#39;ve been thinking about some of the same things. At the moment, my son is 15 months and we live in an apartment, but as we begin shopping for a house, I&#39;m conciously keeping in mind how the space is going to be used (with kids there all day, living and learning in it).<br/>
   <br/>
  When I think of preparing &quot;spaces&quot;, I generally try to think of it more out of utility than of subject. I don&#39;t know what interests my son will have yet, but I do know what I liked and still like, and I try to think of things like &quot;the room with the power tools or the drumset might do best AWAY from the library&quot; or &quot;having a seperate area with a sink and counter will make sure that if the kids decide to do chemistry experiments or dissect something they found in the yard, they won&#39;t be doing it in the middle of the living room or in the kitchen where we prepare FOOD&quot; or &quot;a mess room where plaster of paris, fingerpaint, sand castles, muddy boots, or wonderment of tree sap won&#39;t collide with the book collection or electronics.&quot; Sure, it will still inevitably happen now and then, but setting aside general areas to help show respect for OTHER areas seems like a good start.<br/>
   <br/>
  Rather than set aside ONE room as the &quot;school room&quot;, I&#39;d rather set up the whole house so that it works best for everyone - I don&#39;t have to try and eat dinner on the corner of a table dominated by a half-decomposed science experiment, and they&#39;re free to find out how to get wood stain from freshly-picked black walnuts in a room where it&#39;s perfectly fine to mess up everything from ceiling to floor, without me saying &quot;no! you&#39;ll ruin the carpet!&quot; and depriving them of another of those &quot;unacceptable&quot; learning experiments.<br/>
   <br/>
  Makes me think of when I stunk up the house trying to boil leaves to make my own paper... or when I found some dead newborn puppies and contemplated disecting them in the house... or got punished for taking apart my brand new toys to see how they worked... or got my play-dough taken away for getting some in the carpet...  or got my play-dough taken away because I mixed the colors... any wonder I didn&#39;t get interested in science and technology until after I graduated HS? :)<br/>

down on top of the dryer and keep playing while rebooting the laundry! ;-)<br/>

It is a list run by Anne Ohman&#39;s son Jake.  Usually it is a quiet<br/>
little list, but with Christmas and all, it has gotten busier.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>======================<br/>
<br/>
This is great.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of great stories of little kids using gaming/ <br/>
computer terminology about everyday things.  One, I don&#39;t remember  <br/>
whose child it was, but it was told ten or eleven years ago on the  <br/>
AOL forum.   A little boy who was just three or so left the dinner  <br/>
table to play, but he wasn&#39;t done.  The grownups thought he was, so  <br/>
they cleared his place.  When he came back, he stood in front of the  <br/>
clean spot and cried.  When he could talk to tell them what was wrong  <br/>
he said:  &quot;You deleted my dinner!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other was Kirby, at five or six (Holly was a baby and I&#39;m slow  <br/>
with numbers, especially when people won&#39;t all be born on January  <br/>
1).   I was explaining that we were going to a wedding, but he  <br/>
thought the people were already married because they lived together  <br/>
and he had seen them kissing.  I was explaining about the difference  <br/>
and what it means to be married, and that when Keith and I lived  <br/>
together I could have just decided to leave, and say &quot;Keith I don&#39;t  <br/>
want to be with you anymore,&quot; but when you&#39;re married you promise to  <br/>
stay.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was looking more and more alarmed as the story went on and he  <br/>
said &quot;You would re-set &#39;marry daddy&#39;?&quot;  He wasn&#39;t trying to be cute  <br/>
or funny.  He was just expressing his alarm in the only terms he had  <br/>
for stopping a storyline that wasn&#39;t going well and starting again.<br/>

train, often during playing with his siblings or friends he would<br/>
suddenly realize that he needed to go, and would yell, &quot;PAUSE THE<br/>
