something that worked the same purpose, if you were so inclined.<br/>

It&#39;s a two-player shut-the-box!  But that&#39;s okay/<br/>
<br/>
Shut the box is a pub game, a gambling game, called sometimes &quot;shut the <br/>
drawer.&quot;<br/>

The kids might be interested in the history of the game, and if you go to <br/>
google.com and put in <br/>
shut the box history <br/>
you can see lots more, and pictures.  <br/>
<br/>
But this site said:<br/>
<br/>
History<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not known for sure where Shut the box originated.  Most theories point <br/>
to a source in Northern France and give Normandy or the Channel Islands as the <br/>
specific location.  It appears that it has been played in this region for at <br/>
least two hundred years and is a game popular with sailors and fishermen.  <br/>
There is only evidence for the game in England from the middle of the twentieth <br/>
century, and since most games of a similar ilk spawned references in a variety <br/>
of literature, this would seem to be a good indication that it did not <br/>
originate in that country.  In fact, Timothy Finn in his &quot;Pub Games of England&quot; says <br/>
that that the game was brought to the South of England from the Channel Islands <br/>
in 1958 by a Mr. &#39;Chalky&#39; Towbridge.  Apparently the game has several names, <br/>
one of which is Canoga and one unconfirmed rumour claims that Shut the Box is <br/>
also common in Zambia!<br/>
<br/>
An old pub gambling favourite, Shut the Box uses two dice and a special <br/>
wooden playing tray. The tray features the numbers 1 - 9 in a row,<br/>
each of which has a hinged or sliding cover.  A turn involves repeatedly <br/>
throwing the dice and shutting or covering a number or pair of numbers every <br/>
throw.  The turn ends when no numbers can be covered upon the throw of the dice at <br/>
whicbox&quot; which results in the best possible score of zero.<br/>
<br/>
And it lists pubs in England where there is league play!<br/>
