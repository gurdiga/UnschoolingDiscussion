<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015873927">The post  below mine about dyslexia was received on another list. I have removed identifying  info.<br/>
Our Kara demonstrates most of these characteristics. She is 9<br/>
We unschool. We homeschooled from age 5 and half to 6 and half. <br/>
She spends a great deal of time on NeoPets. PlayStation-Harvest Moon. Videos.  Most of her reading &quot;skills&quot;  come through these . We used &quot;How to Read in 100 Lessons and Bob books when we homeschooled.)<br/>
She resisted all of this  in a huge way. She seldom is interested in reading much else although she does occasionally  read early level books,usually if we are in the car and not much else there.<br/>
She resists anything and everything to do with &quot;math&quot; or numbers even in ordinary life. we never present things as &quot;math&quot;. she simply has no interest. At all.<br/>
I  am on most of the unschooling lists. I am hugely interested and motivated. I have read  and thought about the dyslexia discussions  as they arise on the lists, former Message board.<br/>
I have read books on the subject. My approach has been  to let her develop at her own speed, facilitate her learning  by making things available to her  to support the ways she seems to absorb information.<br/>
 Indeed , I don,t see how else she could really &quot;learn&quot; if it wasnt  available  in the way she does &quot;learn&quot;.<br/>
But still, the list of identifying characteristics  fits her so well that I need to see if I am missing something  in all of this.<br/>
Is there  acceptable &quot;help&quot; out there that is necessary for her to work this through  or can it be done this way -&quot;in her own way&quot;.<br/>
We are in a small isolated area so outside of the public school where they have &quot;remedial&quot; classes  there are no other resources.<br/>
 I have seen various &quot;excercises&quot; in some books on dyslexia. Are there unschoolers who have worked thru this without outside resources. I doubt she would want to participate and she has not ever brought the subject up.<br/>
However, she says her friends call her &quot;Dory&quot; ( Finding Nemo ) because she can&#39;t remember things. so  she is not oblivious to it all.<br/>
Would appreciate feedback from anyone who actually is or has  experienced some of this.<br/>

 <br/>
Dyslexia is always a possibility though because extreme fatigue <br/>
<br/>
while working with written words is definitely a symptom.  <br/>
Basically, children with dyslexia have a big discrepancy between <br/>
their language and non language I.Q.  The biggest problem seems to <br/>
be that they use the right side of the brain when reading.  The left <br/>
side was meant for language (reading, writing etc) so using the <br/>
right side isn&#39;t effective and very tiring for them.  It&#39;s like <br/>
being right handed but writing for an extended period of time with <br/>
the left hand.  It&#39;s tiring.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is to rule out any problems with the eyes first.  If <br/>
they don&#39;t find anything wrong, you could take them in for an <br/>
evaluation with a edu-psychologist to pinpoint the problem for your <br/>
own personal use.  If they do have dyslexia, there are techniques <br/>
and programs to retrain the brain to use the left side while reading <br/>
but the younger you get them, the better long term results you&#39;ll <br/>
get.  It makes a huge difference and after awhile, they don&#39;t get as <br/>
tired.  Dyslexia is inherited so if you have a parent, grandparent, <br/>
brother, sister etc who still has difficulty reading and spelling, <br/>
the risk is there.  If not, that&#39;s great.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-474469353">Hi Grace.<br/>
<br/>
My Jake has always had dyslexic traits (he is almost 14 ~ always <br/>
unschooled).  It hasn&#39;t interfered with his life, much, though.<br/>
<br/>
When he was younger, he wanted so much to draw Pokemon, but what came <br/>
out of his hand didn&#39;t match what was in his head.  He spent much of <br/>
his days very frustrated over this fact.<br/>
<br/>
I remembered reading in *The Gift of Dyslexia* about working with <br/>
clay ~ the book said that if kids could *feel* the way letters are <br/>
*supposed to* be written, that would help them when writing them.<br/>
<br/>
Even though the situation was different, I bought him some Sculpey.<br/>
<br/>
He absolutely loved it and was so good at working with it.  He made <br/>
every single Pokemon (that was when there were only 150!) and we had <br/>
them displayed all over our home.<br/>
<br/>
A year or two later, he picked up a pencil again to draw, and found <br/>
that, at that time, what came out of his hand DID match what was in <br/>
his head.<br/>
<br/>
It may have been the time difference, but I do believe working with <br/>
the clay helped his mind and his hand to find common ground!<br/>
<br/>
Also ~ a few years ago he began drawing a comic strip.  It&#39;s adorable <br/>
and really funny ~ about his brother&#39;s pet guinea pig.  If his <br/>
writing was completely illegible on the comic strip, I&#39;d tell him <br/>
that it looks great, but I can&#39;t read it!  He&#39;d either fix it and <br/>
write more carefully, making absolute sure to make the letters <br/>
correct, or he&#39;d ask me to write it for him.  So, because of his <br/>
desire to have people read his wonderful comic strip, his handwriting <br/>
became more legible, and his letters would come out looking right <br/>
(for that moment, anyway!).<br/>
<br/>
Is your daughter highly sensitive or non-typical in other ways <br/>
besides displaying dyslexic traits?<br/>
<br/>
If so, you may be interested in looking into my group, Unschooling <br/>
Non-Typical Children:<br/>
<br/>
 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shinewithunschooling/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shinewithunschooling/</a><br/>
<br/>
***She seldom is interested in reading much else although she does <br/>
occasionally  read early level books,usually if we are in the car and <br/>
not much else there.***<br/>
<br/>
Do you read to her?  We listen to audio books all the time ~ where we <br/>
live, everything is far away (grocery store is 1/2 hour away), so we <br/>
have a lot of time in the car and we always have a book going.<br/>
<br/>
Also ~ because Jake loves literature, his dyslexic traits didn&#39;t stop <br/>
him from reading ~ just reading out loud.  He said it was a challenge <br/>
for him when the words had to go from the book to his brain and out <br/>
his mouth, but he had no trouble when he just read to himself.<br/>
<br/>
As for writing besides the comic strip, I&#39;ve always been his scribe.  <br/>
He would receive e-mails and I would type the replies for him.  He <br/>
wrote stories by dictating them to me, as he found he *wrote* best by <br/>
pacing back and forth while he was thinking.  He even won a writing <br/>
contest at the library by dictating the story to me, checking to make <br/>
sure I was spelling things correctly, and making sure I added enough <br/>
exclamation points!  <br/>
<br/>
So *writing* is much more than the physical act ~ it&#39;s in your head <br/>
and your heart and however it gets down on paper or in the computer <br/>
doesn&#39;t really matter much.<br/>
<br/>
Now Jake types at the computer himself a LOT.  He&#39;s the fastest one-<br/>
finger typist I know!  He&#39;s on a lot of message boards for things he <br/>
loves ~ Pokemon, Neopets, etc.  He types e-mails.  And he still draws <br/>
beautifully ~ and makes his comic when he&#39;s inspired, also.<br/>
<br/>
He still makes letters and numbers backwards, but, as I said, it <br/>
hasn&#39;t interfered with his life much ~ in fact, his creative, <br/>
wonderful life wouldn&#39;t be what it was today if I had tried to *fix* <br/>
his unique traits, including his dyslexic tendencies.  It&#39;s part of <br/>
Who He Is and part of what&#39;s in his heart and his mind...and that&#39;s <br/>
always been honored and celebrated, just the way it is.<br/>
<br/>
Be Well ~<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482923230"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I doubt she would want to participate and she has not ever brought the<br/>
&gt;subject up.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you have answered your own question here.  If she isn&#39;t interested,<br/>
then wait.  Not that this wouldn&#39;t be true for all kids, but I do say that<br/>
waiting is really important if she is dyslexic.<br/>
<br/>
I am dyslexic.  It&#39;s my own opinion... but I think that getting testing to<br/>
find out is really only helpful if you want to help your child pretend they<br/>
are &quot;normal&quot;.  I believe it&#39;s much more helpful to be open to new odd ways<br/>
of learning, and then allowing your child to develop those new odd ways.<br/>
As a dyslexic, I make the oddest connections between things -- and<br/>
ultimately, this is my most joyous gift!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;However, she says her friends call her &quot;Dory&quot; ( Finding Nemo ) because she<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t remember things. so  she is not oblivious to it all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, so she hears these comments from other kids.  But, how does she feel<br/>
about it?  Does it effect her self-esteem?  IMHO, helping her maintain a<br/>
really good feeling about herself is WAY more important than helping her<br/>
learn tricks so that she can pretend to learn the way others do.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, I don&#39;t have a child with dyslexia.  Well, for that matter I<br/>
might... I just don&#39;t think I&#39;d notice it ;-)  Even so I can feel for your<br/>
concern about wanting to do everything you can to help your daughter become<br/>
the wonderful adult that she will become.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If they do have dyslexia, there are techniques and programs to retrain<br/>
&gt;&gt;the brain to use the left side while reading but the younger you get<br/>
&gt;&gt;them, the better long term results you&#39;ll get.  It makes a huge<br/>
&gt;&gt;difference and after awhile, they don&#39;t get as tired<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I know that this is only one issue wrt to dyslexia.  For some,<br/>
dyslexia is about how their visual system works, not which side of the<br/>
brain is being used.  I won&#39;t go into it here.  But again, IMHO, dyslexia<br/>
is a label for kids who learn differently.  And I say -- what&#39;s wrong with<br/>
that?<br/>
<br/>
Also, in my own experience, I don&#39;t believe that you need to train the<br/>
brain at the earliest age possible.  Yes, this is true if you&#39;re in the<br/>
school system and you don&#39;t want to be behind everyone else.  But, the<br/>
brain is very flexible even at an old age.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Does My Child Have Dyslexia?<br/>
&gt;&gt;Individuals with dyslexia usually have some of the following<br/>
&gt;&gt;characteristics:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh I&#39;m sorry, but this list is so schooly!  I didn&#39;t find a single thing on<br/>
this list that is a problem for a child, unless you happen to be in school<br/>
and aren&#39;t measuring up to everyone else.  The only thing on this list that<br/>
has been a problem for me as an adult is the issue of getting left/right<br/>
confused.  This can be a problem if I&#39;m the navigator.  I just use my body<br/>
and point, before I use my words.  My body never gets it wrong!<br/>
<br/>
Everything else on this list I found my own unique way of solving.<br/>
<br/>
So my advice is to let your daughter find her unique abilities, and to<br/>
allow those to flourish.  You will be amazed what will come of them!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I have another thought.  If you did do some schooling wrt reading, it<br/>
may take her quite awhile to deschool from this experience.  As you said,<br/>
she resisted it in a big way.  It took me years and years to finally learn<br/>
the way that reading worked for me, and I&#39;m certain that the reason it took<br/>
me so long was because I had been told it was suppose to happen another<br/>
way.  Using Bob books and the &quot;How to Read...&quot; book were not the way for<br/>
your daughter, as she showed you.  And now, perhaps that&#39;s the only way she<br/>
thinks of wrt reading.  Someday, she will want to read something, and<br/>
someday it will click for her and she will figure out how it works for her.<br/>
If you can trust her, and be patient, it will be the best gift you can give<br/>
her.<br/>

<br/>
OK, but stuff was presented to her as &quot;math&quot; during the year that you <br/>
homeschooled, before switching to unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I tend to be a &quot;worrier&quot;, too.  But, I think some kids pick up on our <br/>
worrying and aren&#39;t going to show interest in academic stuff until we <br/>
really let it go.  (Gut feeling, I probably can&#39;t offer supporting <br/>
evidence.)<br/>
<br/>
If you feel like reading another book on the topic of learning <br/>
difficulties, I think there is some good content in Mel Levine&#39;s book, <br/>
_The Myth of Laziness_.  He does a good job profiling different children <br/>
and really showing appreciation for their positive qualities.  I think <br/>
this a pleasant antidote to the way schools sometimes just focus on <br/>
&quot;deficiencies&quot; as if everything else about a kid was invisible or <br/>
irrelevant.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590911667">***Individuals with dyslexia usually have some of the following<br/>

<br/>
I was trying to formulate a response to the list of characteristics that<br/>
would be diplomatic but that&#39;s nearly impossible for me so I&#39;m just going<br/>
to say what I think.  I think it&#39;s a load of poopy.<br/>
<br/>
I think there *are* probably some people in the world who&#39;s brains are<br/>
organized in a way that makes written language more difficult for them.  <br/>
 But I would consider other possibilities before I&#39;d consider Dyslexia. <br/>
<br/>
***Dyslexia is always a possibility though because extreme fatigue <br/>
 while working with written words is definitely a symptom. ***<br/>
<br/>
Well then I have it because it was all I could do to get through that!<br/>
<br/>
I have extreme fatigue while reading *anything* religious, anything from<br/>
my brother David and anything from my mother in law.  But I can fly<br/>
through a Martha Grimes novel or a Dean Koontz and I can read poetry for<br/>
hours. <br/>
I have a really strong feeling a kid who isn&#39;t yet ready to read would<br/>
have extreme fatigue if someone was making her try to read. <br/>
The whole list of possible signs of Dyslexia are also all the signs of<br/>
someone pushed to do something before they&#39;re ready.  <br/>
<br/>
I think nine is very young and she has a lot of time.   <br/>
<br/>
***However, she says her friends call her &quot;Dory&quot; ( Finding Nemo ) because<br/>
she can&#39;t remember things.***<br/>
<br/>
I can remember some things irritatingly well and others leave me almost<br/>
instantly.   I can never find my keys, shoes, measuring spoons or car in<br/>
any parking lot.   I sometimes get all the way to the post office before<br/>
I realize I didn&#39;t bring the mail with me.    I read when I was four<br/>
years old and I can still recite &quot;The Raven&quot; which I memorized in third<br/>
grade.   I know how many strips of fabric are in every rug I ever made.  <br/>
 Not everyone fits neatly in the zone most of society would like us to<br/>
believe is &quot;normal.&quot;    My feeling is &quot;normal&quot; is much bigger than most<br/>
people ever consider and if we could relax everyone would be better off. <br/>
 If her friends are hurting her feelings with their comments maybe she<br/>
can think about the things she does well and maybe you could tell them to<br/>
zip it. <br/>

My information that I shared about Jake was based on the fact that he <br/>
always reversed letters and numbers ~ and when he read out loud, he <br/>
would skip a lot of words.  I talked to other people about it when he <br/>
was about 7 or 8 (friends and acquaintances ~ and one who uses the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-58031201">I very  much appreciate  the time and thought people have taken to reply on this subject.<br/>
 I am on my way out of town  until Sat night and wanted to just acknowlege this.<br/>
 Of course  your   responses are not just for &quot; me and my post&quot;.<br/>
When I address a subject I tend to  &quot;overpost&quot; and then work from an overview to the specific.Sorry , it drives my husband nuts as well.<br/>
To be a bit more specific. I was wondering if there are really helpful  approaches   or &quot; exercises&#39; that  might help her process the spoken, written word  (if she ever indicates that this is something  she might want) and if there is an optimum time to do that.Or are there people on this list who have tried them  for their dyslexic children.<br/>
This is not to say I want to label,  change, treat, or school her. I want to understand her different  responses to the spoken, written word and the process of writing  and  know when and if I can help her and in what specific ways or if indeed there  are any specific ways.<br/>
 I know that much  of what is commonly understood as being &quot;necessary skills&quot; is a requirement for public school.<br/>
Oh, yes as for the &quot;math&quot; thing? what  is &quot;different&quot; with her is that  if someone talks about &quot;how many , or  how much or how long-while others might count or subtract or wonder or figure-she just watches or lets them do it. she has only recently really understood that the act of counting  is actually adding one more  to a number.Verbally. or when counting. Handling objects she does, easily.   Counting backwards-ie subtracting  one from the number she actually &quot;doesnt get it&quot;.verbally, out loud, handling objects she does. I dont think it is that unusual and it is not something we ever comment on but I just observe it as she plays. We dont do anything called math or use the word in everyday life.  We did try Math-U-See-just  the first couple of exercises in a fun way when they were 5-6 and it was totally meaningless and confusing to her.<br/>
I dont plan on changing our unschooling-it works great for us in all ways.<br/>
Oh, yes Anneo she is &quot;sensativity issues&quot; but not so much now as her twin sister. the clothing, food, texture things are becoming  easier for her as she gets older.<br/>
I did join  Shinewith unschooling as soon as it started , it was great at first but I unsubbed when  it got  a bit off track while you  were  gone. I plan on rejoining when  I get back to having more time . <br/>
It really generated a lot of interesting posts.<br/>
Wish I could  directly reply to each but I,m  off to Vernon.<br/>

<br/>
You wrote in your previous message:<br/>
<br/>
***My approach has been to let her develop at<br/>
her own speed, facilitate her learning by making things available to <br/>
her to<br/>
support the ways she seems to absorb information.<br/>
Indeed , I don,t see how else she could really &quot;learn&quot; if it wasnt <br/>
available<br/>
in the way she does &quot;learn&quot;.<br/>
But still, the list of identifying characteristics fits her so well <br/>
that I need<br/>
to see if I am missing something in all of this.<br/>
Is there acceptable &quot;help&quot; out there that is necessary for her to <br/>
work this<br/>
through or can it be done this way -&quot;in her own way&quot;.***<br/>
<br/>
From these words, it seems evident that it&#39;s not your daughter who is <br/>
finding challenges in her life...it&#39;s you, looking at a list of <br/>
characteristics, seeing your daughter in them, and thinking you <br/>
should do something to *help* her.<br/>
<br/>
But she isn&#39;t asking for help...is she?<br/>
<br/>
I would forget that list of dyslexic traits that came up on the other <br/>
list.  Look at the heart of your daughter.  Look at her passions.  <br/>
She&#39;s living an unschooling life...doing what she loves.  Is she <br/>
content and able to get from what world what she needs/desires in <br/>
life?  <br/>
<br/>
The only thing I could see in your above words that may need a shift <br/>
is the fact that you seem to be focusing on your child&#39;s *learning* <br/>
instead of her *life.*  Your *approach*, as stated above (&quot;let her <br/>
develop at her own speed, facilitate her learning by making things <br/>
available to her to support the ways she seems to absorb <br/>
information&quot;) just seems to be lacking the very foundation of <br/>
unschooling, to me:  Joy.  The Joy that comes from the child being <br/>
free to follow her heart, her passions...<br/>
<br/>
I think a shift in your focus AWAY from all things *learning* to all <br/>
things *joyful* for your child would help you to see that All is <br/>
Well...that your child Shines just as she is ~ no list of traits <br/>
necessary!<br/>
<br/>
***what  is &quot;different&quot; with her is that  if someone talks about &quot;how <br/>
many , or  how much or how long-while others might count or subtract <br/>
or wonder or figure-she just watches or lets them do it.***<br/>
<br/>
Why isn&#39;t that OK?  She&#39;s doing what she needs to do, processing it <br/>
in her mind the way she needs to process it.<br/>
<br/>
All of the things that she exhibits are her own way of processing <br/>
information.  If we didn&#39;t have lists of traits and labels and <br/>
standards that schools expect from our children, then we would more <br/>
clearly be able to see that each child is different, each mind is <br/>
precious and unique, and there are no standard time-frames for <br/>
specific *learning*.  <br/>
<br/>
So along with shifting the focus of your days from *learning* to <br/>
*life*, it&#39;s also important to live that life as if school doesn&#39;t <br/>
exist.  Allow your child to be Free, and in the course of her Free <br/>
life she encounters challenges, you will be able to overcome those <br/>
challenges at that time together.<br/>
<br/>
But don&#39;t *make* challenges in her life when, from her view of the <br/>
world, there aren&#39;t any.    <br/>
<br/>
***Oh, yes Anneo she is &quot;sensativity issues&quot; but not so much now as <br/>

time .***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry the *tone* of the list early on while it was establishing <br/>
itself turned you off ~ but I completely understand!  Things are once <br/>
again Joyful on the list!<br/>
<br/>
Be Well ~<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I expect there would be some helpful approaches.  But, she hasn&#39;t yet<br/>
indicated that this is something she wants.  Wait until she asks, or wait<br/>
until the moment arrises when you are working on a project together.<br/>
<br/>
Right now you are projecting your concerns into the future, which makes it<br/>
really hard to live in the moment and to appreciate the joy.  I think the<br/>
best exercise for you would be to watch her live life, notice how she<br/>
tackles things as you have fun together, ask her questions about her<br/>
interests so you can really get to know her as she is right now.  Then, if<br/>
she does ask you for help to do something with reading, say, you will be<br/>
ever more present and have so many ideas about what might work for her then.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and if there is an optimum time to do that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That would be when she is ready and has asked for help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I want to understand her different  responses to the spoken, written word<br/>
&gt;and the process of writing  and  know when and if I can help her and in<br/>
&gt;what specific ways or if indeed there  are any specific ways.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think there is one specific way that will help you understand her,<br/>
other than to watch her, have conversations with her, participate with her,<br/>
and encourage her to be who she is in every moment.<br/>
<br/>
I expect we can all relate to your intent, however.  It may seem a bit<br/>
ordinary as an example, but it seems to me to be the same thing.  I want to<br/>
get my daughter a new computer game... but it&#39;s really hard to know what<br/>
she will like.  I don&#39;t really know how she is relating to the games that<br/>
she currently plays.  So, I&#39;m asking her questions, I&#39;m playing the games<br/>
with her, I&#39;m watching what she does, and I&#39;m starting to learn.  So far I<br/>
have learned that she is very keen on watching and playing with the<br/>
expressions of the characters - she will do something odd with the game to<br/>
make them do silly things.  It still doesn&#39;t help me know what new game to<br/>
get, but it&#39;s a start.<br/>

Marty would have been labelled dyslexic had he been in school.  He&#39;s one of <br/>
those good-at-math, athletic, spatial-reasoning, left-handed guys.  So is my <br/>
husband.  So was my father.<br/>
<br/>
Marty had to figure out on his own way (and I never needed to know what that <br/>
way was) how to tell one end of a word from the other, but he did.<br/>
<br/>
I think telling someone how they &quot;need&quot; to read is more damaging than just <br/>
surrounding them with words and stories and pictures and trusting that they will <br/>
ask questions when they have them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434958027">I have been watching this thread with much interest.  I too have a daughter<br/>
who exhibits symptoms of being dyslexic.  When she was in 1st grade in<br/>
public school she was put through a battery of tests.  I requested it<br/>
because I was sure she was dyslexic after doing much research. They would<br/>
only tell me she had a learning disability and wanted to put her in<br/>
resource!  I threw a fit and wouldn&#39;t allow the resource thing.  She<br/>
struggled so with reading and would fail the reading tests.  But if I read<br/>
the test to her she would ace it without hearing the multiple-choice<br/>
options.  (She could just tell you the answer.)  I pulled her out of public<br/>
school when she was 7.    Her memory of things she watches on TV. or sees at<br/>
the museums,etc. is incredible.  But let me tell her that her towel is the<br/>
one on the left she will put her hands on her head and say &quot;Oh! I am getting<br/>
confused!&quot;  She doesn&#39;t have much concept of time frames.  Asking her to do<br/>
more than one thing at a time just isn&#39;t going to happen.  I have learned to<br/>
ask one thing at a time and to break other things in life down to bite size<br/>
pieces.  Our local library has a ton of books on tape.  She loves Juni B.<br/>
Jones and she enjoys putting the CD in and following along in the book.  But<br/>
some of the books seem to go too fast for her to keep up so we use those for<br/>
when we are in the car.<br/>
I must admit I have moments of wanting to worry.  But then I remind myself<br/>
that she will find ways of putting things together in her own way (and<br/>
time).  But I do have one question for the group...... Will the lack of<br/>
concentration hinder her ability to learn all she can?  During all the<br/>
battery of tests I forgot to mention she WAS diagnosed as a severe ADD<br/>
child.  We tried the medication but to be honest I just couldn&#39;t feel good<br/>
about giving her a controlled narcotic.  My dh and I made the decision to<br/>
just let her go at her on pace and ignore the &quot;well-meaning&quot; comments from<br/>
grand-parents.<br/>

I just finished reading Martha Beck&#39;s _Expecting Adam_. A very sweet and  <br/>
funny book about nine months of preparing for the birth of a Down syndrome  baby.<br/>
 <br/>
She briefly talks about what she&#39;s learned from him in the years since his  <br/>
birth (most of it is what she learned while pregnant with him). Here&#39;s an  <br/>
exerpt:<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;By the time he was six, I was ready to give up [on his  learning how to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>recognize letters on his own].<br/>
 <br/>
...one day John [husband] was holding up a plastic letter and making its  <br/>
sound, which happend to be &quot;EEEEEE,&quot; when Adam suddenly perked up and said,  <br/>
&quot;Wizbef!&quot; This is the way he pronounces his sister Elizabeth&#39;s name. Naturally,  <br/>
John and I took this as ample cause to stay home from work and celebrate. <br/>
During  that day, we discovered that Adam&#39;s learning capacity went way beyond <br/>
anything  we expected----as long as everything he learned related directly to <br/>
someone he  cared about. He had absolutely no interest in, for example, &quot;E is for <br/>
egg.&quot; But  E for Elizabeth----now THAT was crucial information.<br/>
 <br/>
In the end we all learned the alphabet this way. The symbols we had been  <br/>
trying to link to abstract sounds ended up as a parade of personalities: Adam  <br/>
first, of course, then Billy, Caleb, Diane. Elizabeth, Francine, Grandpa,.... As <br/>
 we figured out how he learned, the landscape of our son&#39;s mind began to <br/>
reveal  itself to us. Instead of rationally constructed structure of empirical  <br/>
observations, logical conclusions, and arbitrary symbols, Adam&#39;s mental world  <br/>
seems more like a huge family reunion. It&#39;s a gathering of people, all linked <br/>
by  Adam&#39;s affection into a complex universe of relationships and <br/>
characteristics.  In this universe, Adam learns as fast as anyone I know. <br/>
 <br/>
Long before he could read or write even the most basic words (or so I  <br/>
thought), Adam came home to tell me, in his garbled tongue, about the new  boy who <br/>
had just moved into his class, and who had become Adam&#39;s  friend. When I <br/>
couldn&#39;t understand his pronunciation of the boy&#39;s name, Adam  grabbed a pencil in <br/>
his stubby, grubby little-boy fingers, and wrote, &quot;Miguel  Fernando de la Hoya&quot; <br/>
on a piece of paper---a piece of paper, needless to say,  which I intend to <br/>
frame. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
If we will allow them to make the connections, they WILL----just maybe not  <br/>
in the same way we do.<br/>
