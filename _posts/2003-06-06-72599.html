was a good cry though, thinking of you being there with your Mom so much.<br/>
I&#39;m sorry she left this earth when you weren&#39;t with her. The one night I <br/>
finally went up to my parents house for a shower and some real food, my Mom died. <br/>
I still am sad about it sometimes.<br/>
I&#39;m glad she doesn&#39;t have to hurt or be afraid anymore.<br/>
But I&#39;m sorry you don&#39;t have your Mom with you. <br/>
((((((((((((((((Tia))))))))))))))))))))))))<br/>

<br/>
I am so sorry for your loss :(  The fact that you want to share it <br/>
here hopefully means you have found a good place of support and <br/>
friendship.<br/>
