<div id="ygrps-yiv-302909880">I do not read &quot;assistance&quot; to be equivalent to arguing for lessons & <br/>
curriculum.  Some sort of interaction with others seems to be important to <br/>
the learning process whether it is the asking of authentic questions (rather <br/>
than contrived &quot;guess what&#39;s in my head&quot; questions) or trying a particular <br/>
&quot;strategy.&quot; I put strategy in quotes because it may be laden with too many <br/>
negative connotations for some.  I simply mean, for example, deciding to use <br/>
particular vocabulary in one&#39;s interaction with a child believing that they <br/>
might pick up on that vocabulary (they may not and that&#39;s okay too but no <br/>
harm in trying).  Would this be anti-unschooling as some define it?  Is this <br/>
assistance? Does it really matter what it is called?  Perhaps it fits into <br/>
the category of &quot;exposure&quot; among your list of elements of learning below.<br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt; &gt; Some folks may be using &quot;learn to read naturally&quot; as meaning &quot;learn to<br/>
&gt; &gt; read unassisted&quot;.  But, to me, it is natural for children to have<br/>
&gt; &gt; assistance.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m wondering whether for some people here they&#39;re not fishing for the<br/>
&gt;blessings of the group to teach reading, or for the justification from the <br/>
&gt;group for<br/>
&gt;giving up on unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why would someone come here wanting that?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt; I am so glad, I<br/>
&gt;was not the only person who took the work &quot;natural&quot; to be literal... like, <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;would just &quot;HAPPEN! BAM!&quot; .. ( for everyone, that is, for some, yes it <br/>
&gt;does)&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Nothing happens BAM were learning is concerned.  There is interest,<br/>
&gt;observation, exposure, trial and error, question and answer.  None of that <br/>
&gt;needs<br/>
&gt;lessons, a curriculum, or a phonics method.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is nothing unnatural about a person figuring something out in those<br/>
&gt;ways.  It&#39;s the way people learn about unschooling all the time.   <br/>
&gt;Interest,<br/>
&gt;observation, exposure, trial and error, question and answer.   There&#39;s <br/>
&gt;enough<br/>
&gt;reading online already to last someone weeks, without what&#39;s being added <br/>
&gt;daily.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yet some are determined to look for evidence that unschooling doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is a funny place to look for it.<br/>

up, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s anti-unschooling.  Thinking a good vocabulary should <br/>
be important to your kid doesn&#39;t sit right with me tho.  Is that nitpicking?  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to me to see the &#39;exposure&#39; thing, and the comments about <br/>
kids picking up culture from parents, etc.  If you leave math books all over the <br/>
place, you&#39;re kids will learn more math, if you leave reading materials <br/>
around instead, they&#39;ll read that.  Or not, hehehe.  <br/>
<br/>
How about leaving lots of different stuff around so that they are following <br/>
their interests, hehehe, and not the parents&#39;?  Isn&#39;t that better unschooling?  <br/>
Is it passive coersion to leave around Shakespeare but no chemistry books ( <br/>
to use Sandra&#39;s post as just an example) ?  <br/>
<br/>
You can be ready and willing to offer anything and ask questions, and go out <br/>
to the store or library to get whatever you don&#39;t have, but is that the same <br/>
as having them around?  Tough questions.  I know I have much more fiction in <br/>
the rest of the house, and all the sciency stuff I&#39;m not much interested in is <br/>
only on my husband&#39;s shelves and my kid&#39;s room.  I don&#39;t know what I think <br/>
about that, now, hehehehe.  Maybe I should clean less? lol<br/>

<br/>
When the parents are easiest fascinated by having a sterile barren clean <br/>
house, I don&#39;t know how the kids learn Shakespeare OR chemistry.<br/>
<br/>
We have a periodic chart of the elements, one of those laminated things, <br/>
which comes out periodically. &lt;g&gt;  We&#39;ve had many discussions of what metals do <br/>
what in what circumstances, and have made lots of baking soda messes. <br/>
<br/>
I started to say I&#39;ve never put on a video about chemistry, but that&#39;s not <br/>
true.  We have some of the... not Bill Nye but the other crazy wigged guy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is one of those &quot;grey areas&quot;, isn&#39;t it? We as parents can&#39;t help <br/>
but influence our children who live with us 24/7. Children naturally <br/>
soak up the environment that is around them (if that environment is a <br/>
passive one; children who are forced into participating in their <br/>
parents&#39; passions have been known to rebel, LOL). My bookcase doesn&#39;t <br/>
have a single Shakespeare book (sorry folks!), but I&#39;ve got lots of <br/>
Persian poetry books. I also am more likely to be playing Turkish <br/>
folk music around the house rather than Western Classical music. My <br/>
husband is a big video gamer who plays almost every night, and <br/>
recently got the kids their own system as well. When the kids were <br/>
too young to choose for themselves, I was the one who picked out <br/>
books and toys to buy for them and decided what videos and TV shows <br/>
to switch on for them, and I made a conscious decision to never ever <br/>
switch on Barney because I couldn&#39;t stand that big purple dork, LOL. <br/>
<br/>
All of these things that we as parents do are influencing our young <br/>
children&#39;s tastes. But what do you do about that? Short of buying one <br/>
of every type of book or rotating through every single musical style <br/>
or switching the TV to another channel every 10 minutes or whatever, <br/>
there&#39;s no way you have the time to personally expose your child to <br/>
every single possibility out there. <br/>
<br/>
In addition to that old standby the public library, we are very lucky <br/>
to now also have television and computers so that kids can expose <br/>
themselves to a wide range of information outside of their parents&#39; <br/>
relatively narrow interests. The problem arises when parents limit or <br/>
censor their children&#39;s reading, watching, and playing based upon <br/>
those personal preferences. That&#39;s where the unschooling kicks in I <br/>
suppose--I&#39;m not going to stop my kid from reading whatever he wants, <br/>
or listening to whatever music he wants, or even switching on Barney <br/>
if that&#39;s what he really wants to do (ugh!). I can&#39;t help but <br/>
passively influence my child with my interests, but I don&#39;t think it <br/>
becomes blatant coercion unless I actively push my interests on him <br/>
and prevent him from branching out and pursuing his own interests.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is a great point that I didn&#39;t think of at the time I was posting. <br/>
<br/>
I have a theory that as computers and the net become more accessable, we will <br/>
see more homeschoolers and specifically, unschoolers.  I think more <br/>
homeschoolers will become unschoolers.  Why research a bunch of stuff that the kids&#39; <br/>
are not interested in, or buy curriculum, when the kid can get online and get <br/>
his fill of lots of interesting stuff he wants to know?  Or, the parent can pull <br/>
lots of stuff from the net and have it around, that they find when they&#39;re <br/>
surfing.  I send Alex about 3 links a day to his email.  <br/>
<br/>
No worries about the parent knowing nothing about a certain subject, the kid <br/>
can find what he needs.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s silly to decide for the kid what he should know, because the kids have <br/>
much more of a pulse of what&#39;s new and needed in modern society, and they, <br/>
almost effortlessly, learn that.  <br/>
<br/>
My son was interested in learning Japanese, pulled up a bunch of websites, <br/>
told me all this stuff I never knew, and he did that in about two hours on line. <br/>
 Lots of kids are interested in Japanese because of YuGiOh cards and video <br/>
games.  Can&#39;t take Japanese until high school because it&#39;s &quot;too hard&quot;.  But it&#39;s <br/>
ridiculous to make the kids wait if they&#39;re interested at 8 or 9 years old.  <br/>
<br/>
Watched Big Trouble last nite, people kept spitting out wierd, but useful, <br/>
facts, all learned from the Discovery Channel.  lol <br/>
<br/>
So, you&#39;re right, as long as you&#39;re not limiting exposure to these <br/>
technologies, they will find what they&#39;re looking for, and be exposed to new things that <br/>
parents know nothing about.  <br/>
<br/>
I am learning French and Spanish, for example, and have no interest in <br/>
Japanese, at all.  But that doesn&#39;t seem to be making a dent in his interest in <br/>
Japanese.  Now he wants to go to Japan!!<br/>

<br/>
You know, I know people who are complete pacifists, won&#39;t even step <br/>
on a bug in real life, and yet they are strongly attracted to fantasy <br/>
violence, blood and gore and yuck yuck yuck. <br/>
<br/>
My dad is one such person. He&#39;s one of the kindest gentlest men <br/>

I&#39;m one such person as well. I really CAN&#39;T kill a bug, I end up <br/>
catching it in a cup and tossing it outside, LOL. But I love watching <br/>
Jackie Chan and Jet Li kick the crap out of people in martial arts <br/>
films, and I laugh &#39;till I cry everytime they kill Kenny on South <br/>
Park.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned that my husband recently got the kids their own game <br/>
system (an N64), which is what prompted you to ask about video games <br/>
I guess. My son is a very sweet, gentle, empathetic little boy, and <br/>
highly sensitive too--if I so much as sniffle, he asks me if I&#39;m <br/>
crying, what&#39;s wrong, am I ok, etc. Just for randomly sniffling, LOL! <br/>
But he LOVES watching his Papa run over people on Vice City, and he <br/>
himself has been getting a tremendous kick out of intentionally <br/>
eating and stepping on as many people as he can on the game Rampage. <br/>
(In this game, he plays a king-kong type monster whose goal is to <br/>
wreck as much damage on various cities as possible. Destroy the <br/>
building, smash the cars, and eat/kick/smush/drop the people! LOL)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d say just leave him alone, it&#39;s only a game. ;)<br/>

what effects the different weapons have in the game.  I think there is no<br/>
problem with it.  He&#39;s just having fun playing a pretend game.  And using<br/>
the codes has peaked my son&#39;s interest in reading.<br/>
My views are a little biased as I love to play games, video/pc/board/card<br/>
etc. (Vice City was purchased for me.) But most importantly is that we have<br/>
never restricted the games they choose, and we have never had any problems<br/>
with violence.  We are all gamers around here.<br/>

creating. But in Godzilla I have no problem whacking buildings and throwing<br/>
them around and generally trashing a city. (Not to mention other monsters.)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is very conscious of people&#39;s feelings but there&#39;s a new<br/>
resident to the town in the Animal Crossing game who is really snooty and<br/>
superior.  Kathryn has no problem shoving her around until she gets mad, or<br/>
whacking her with a shovel.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s fun because we&#39;re free to try out things we can&#39;t in real life<br/>
because of the horrible repercussions. It&#39;s just a game. No one and no thing<br/>
is really being harmed. When Godzilla starts a new fight the cities are<br/>
magically returned to pristine condition! :-)<br/>
<br/>
It *would* be a problem if your son were disconnected from his compassion in<br/>
real life, or, because of a bad home life, were using the game to *become*<br/>
disconnected and reiniforce his ability to not care. I suspect none of that<br/>
is true for your family.<br/>

complete the mission, sometimes they run around with the flamethrower <br/>
and sometimes they conjure up the tank with the cheat codes and blow <br/>
things up.<br/>

flat heads, etc...God knows!  lol  <br/>

Hey, think of it as computer programming, that&#39;s what he&#39;s really doing.  ;-) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll probably get bored with that eventually....really only so many times <br/>
you can do that before you realize it&#39;s kinda silly, lol.  <br/>

Kirby and Marty are playing a new Star Wars scenario game in which you get <br/>
dark points and light points, and you can decide whether to be &quot;a good guy&quot; or <br/>
&quot;a bad guy.&quot;  Your goodness or badness increases with decisions you make as you <br/>
play.  The game goes differently if you&#39;re playing a bad guy.   They&#39;ve done <br/>
both.  They&#39;re having a lot of fun exploring this made-up world from different <br/>
angles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956691332">Thanks to all that responded.  This is what I thought you would all say, just making sure I guess.  Most people I know that homeschool here would be horrified that I even have that game in my house... Oh I don&#39;t want to damage his little phsicy... so off he goes to chop off heads and watch blood spurt LOL... and I have to watch. Well he has also started really tormenting his sisters aka, throwing their shoes in the woods, he did shoot at them with a toy that the neighbor kids brought down, but I think they were all playing like that and he just didn&#39;t miss... well new things.. what ?  The sisters are telling mom and she isn&#39;t saying anything?  Or she is only talking to me about it?? No having to sit on the couch, all new stuff for him... He is the youngest, so they probably are teasing him too... He just isn&#39;t telling.  <br/>

<br/>
I ain&#39;t goin&#39; nowhere (in the good sense, that is).  I&#39;m just over my head <br/>
in work and music and life, so I don&#39;t get a chance to read too much or <br/>
respond, but I&#39;m here!!  And, if I can manage to scrape together enough <br/>
dough, I&#39;ll *really* see you in August!!  But, I&#39;m always here (so don&#39;t go <br/>
talkin&#39; &#39;bout me behind my back!)  :-D<br/>
<br/>
With love and hugs and waves to everyone,<br/>
