<div id="ygrps-yiv-253667546">I told dh last night that I really want to go to SC, but don&#39;t know how we <br/>
can swing it. Our budget is really tight, and we have a new roof to put on <br/>
and pay for. I can totally relate to the funding issues discussed here. We <br/>
are trying to maintain debt-free status that took us years to achieve. <br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t really told him much about it, other than I wanted to go. I can&#39;t <br/>
see going alone with three kids, and there is no one else to keep my kids or <br/>
go with me. <br/>
<br/>
So he says we will find a way to go, if I really want to. I am totally <br/>
intimidated by the thought. We don&#39;t go on fancy family vacations, we own a <br/>
camper and keep things cheap. I feel bad that we would have to spend so much <br/>
and drag him along and it&#39;s not really his thing. <br/>
<br/>
Megan wants to go. At first she just wanted to be really close to Myrtle <br/>
Beach, thinking my mom would go and take the kids to the beach while i did <br/>
the conference. My mom isn&#39;t going. She is taking off 2 weeks in August to go <br/>
to Alaska on a trip she swears she can&#39;t afford. But she is still going, <br/>
putting it all on yet another credit card. She said if she wasn&#39;t already <br/>
planning Alaska, she would love to go to Myrtle Beach again. She knows I <br/>
don&#39;t do big expensive vacations, so two years ago she paid for our hotel for <br/>
a week so we would go with her and my siblings. It still cost us big bucks in <br/>
food, gasoline, and unpaid time off for dh. She is still paying on the credit <br/>
card from that trip. <br/>
<br/>
Our lifestyle doesn&#39;t afford us to travel the world on credit cards the way <br/>
she does. We bought a big house(long story, but we couldn&#39;t pass the offer <br/>
up) two years ago and it&#39;s all we can do to keep to a budget on one income. <br/>
So I am really in a bind trying to figure out if we will do this. I am <br/>
terrible at making decisions anyway. <br/>
<br/>
Megan, my 10yo, really wants to go. She heard there is a talent show &lt;g&gt; She <br/>
was afraid of missing the talent shows when she quit school, even though she <br/>
would have had to try out and possibly not make the cut. So she decided to <br/>
start reading my frugal books yesterday so we can do this as a family. She is <br/>
reading Miserly Moms, and has been carrying The Complete Tightwad Gazette <br/>
around, hoping she can inspire us to tighten up even more to make this trip. <br/>
<br/>
God love her. She has more courage than I do. I am worried the used Volvo <br/>
would break down on the way. <br/>
<br/>
What to do, what to do. Worry and guilt, worry and guilt. Anxiety and fear of <br/>
failure.  I need to make a decision soon. <br/>
<br/>
Ang the hopeless neurotic<br/>

<br/>
We DO have working scholarships. No one&#39;s going to be turned away for lack of <br/>
funds.<br/>
<br/>
Options include gathering $100 in ads for the handbook, helping at the tables <br/>
(registration/sales/raffle), presenting a funshop, clean-up, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t help with travel or hotel, but I don&#39;t want you NOT attend because <br/>
you can&#39;t afford the registration.<br/>
