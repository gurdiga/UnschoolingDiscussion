<div id="ygrps-yiv-221085454">***Our 7 yr. old son doesn&#39;t know how to tie his shoes either. He<br/>
prefers to<br/>
wear slip-on boots most of the time, because it&#39;s easier. I&#39;m not too<br/>
worried though, as there are other options (i.e. boots, slip-on shoes),<br/>
and<br/>
there&#39;s also velcro :) But hey, he&#39;s okay with math, can read well, and<br/>
his<br/>
always happy --that&#39;s what&#39;s really important to me anyway. If he gets<br/>
to<br/>
35 and still can&#39;t tie his shoes, well, he can just live in a yurt and<br/>
go<br/>
barefooted. LOL<br/>

Thanks Todd - My 7 1/2 yr old son doesn&#39;t know how to tie his shoes<br/>
either , he wears clogs or sandals (we&#39;re in California, no truly cold<br/>
weather here).  It doesn&#39;t matter, he&#39;s a good kid, loves to read, is<br/>
kind, generous and very spiritual.  We&#39;re happy with him just the way he<br/>
is (although we have given him a nickname also - Robin bobbin).<br/>
<br/>
Barefoot!  The calluses on the bottom of my feet are enormous from being<br/>
barefoot most of my life.  My kids are welcome to join me, and they do<br/>
most of the time (bare feet and bare bodies).<br/>
<br/>
And if he chooses to live in a yurt, I&#39;ll be the first to visit, I&#39;ve<br/>
always wanted to live in one.<br/>
