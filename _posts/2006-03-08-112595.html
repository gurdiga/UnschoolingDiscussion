Ack!!  I remember that.  I hate that idea!  I don&#39;t WANT to  be associated <br/>
with all the extreme fundamentalist, dresses only, switch  swinging, textbook <br/>
toting homeschool types (my apologies if I offend  anyone).  I still find that <br/>
most people assume that if you homeschool,  it&#39;s for religious reasons.  Even <br/>
other homeschoolers!<br/>

ideas like mine. &lt;G&gt;  We&#39;re not doing the same  thing&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

LOL!!  I think a lot of people feel the same way about me and my  kids.  I&#39;ve <br/>
come to the conclusion that that&#39;s their problem, and they  don&#39;t have to <br/>
hang around our family at functions if they don&#39;t want to.   But the kids in our <br/>
homeschool group LIKE my kids, because they&#39;re just nice  kids, friendly to <br/>
everyone.  A few discussions have started up that could  have turned into <br/>
arguments but so far both kids have agreed not to take the  argument any further <br/>
(religious).  <br/>
