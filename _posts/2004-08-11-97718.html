<div id="ygrps-yiv-188076866">My son chose to go to school this year.  He&#39;s turning 8 and we&#39;ve <br/>
homeschooled/unschooled for two years now.  I don&#39;t know how to feel <br/>
about it yet. I am a bit disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
Four years ago i put him on the waiting list for a Bank Street <br/>
charter school.  They had an opening for him this year.  I debated <br/>
whether to tell him about it but I didn&#39;t want to be sneaky wit him.  <br/>
I told him about it and he said he wanted us to check it out and let <br/>
him know how it was. Which we did.<br/>
<br/>
As far as schools go, I liked what I saw.  The teachers were very <br/>
compasisonate and seemed to really care.  I liked that they had alot <br/>
of liberties with directing the class and that the students were also <br/>
given alot of say in what they wanted to learn.  They told me they <br/>
didn&#39;t worry about the testing.  They just took it when it was time <br/>
to and didn&#39;t dewll on it all year.<br/>
<br/>
It was a hard decision.  Like picking the lesser evil.<br/>
<br/>
I know it can&#39;t replace unschooling.  The only reason this is even an <br/>
issue is because I&#39;ve had to work full time for the past year and I <br/>
don&#39;t have the time to spend with him.  I didn&#39;t think it was fair to <br/>
him.  He also said he wanted to go back to school and be with other <br/>
kids more.<br/>
<br/>
I make sure he knows he&#39;s there by choice.  Just because it&#39;s a <br/>
sought after school it doesn&#39;t replace the homeschooling.  He is free <br/>
to leave whenever he wants.  His first day he told me he didn&#39;t think <br/>
he was ready for third grade and wanted to be in second and they <br/>
agreed to change him.  He also says he &quot;wants to see what it&#39;s like&quot; <br/>
They&#39;ve been very accomodating and understanding about my anxieties <br/>
about school in general. i&#39;m glad that he is able to view school this <br/>
way. As a choice, an experiment. Not as a requirement or the only <br/>
place to learn.<br/>
<br/>
He seems happy.  I think it&#39;s because he has a choice. I don&#39;t really <br/>
know how to feel.  I&#39;m trying not to pass my anxieties onto him and <br/>
be happy for him. But I can&#39;t tell him he has the freedom to choose <br/>
and then get upset when he decides for something I wouldn&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
What would you do if your kids chose school?<br/>

My oldest, also 8, has asked to go back to school this<br/>
year. She wants to go to the local public school with<br/>
the girls she knows in the neighborhood who are her<br/>
age. It is a VERY difficult thing for me to let her<br/>
go. All I can do is let her go as long as she is happy<br/>
with her decision. My son who is 4 is also asking to<br/>
go, because his friend is going. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-133333205">After three miscarriages and post-partum depression after the birth of our<br/>
second child (also lost our dream home & went thru bankruptcy), I felt it<br/>
was best to send my oldest to kindergarten &#39;cuz I didn&#39;t think I could give<br/>
her what she needed.  Sending her to school depressed me even more (the<br/>
previous year I&#39;d attended a national homeschool conference & joined a<br/>
support group to see how others did it).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I checked out three schools that were options in our area and picked<br/>
the best.  Then I campaigned each year for the best teacher.  The first<br/>
teacher had won District Teacher of the Year and taught Kindergarten for 12<br/>
years, but she still didn&#39;t recognize my child as gifted, when I asked about<br/>
it halfway through the year after my daughter started spontaneously to read<br/>
on her own (I hadn&#39;t taught her!) while everyone else was learning alphabet<br/>
sounds.<br/>
<br/>
It took my daughter&#39;s second grade teacher (a sweet, young, new teacher<br/>
recruited from Canada) to recomment my daughter to the GATE program (Gifted<br/>
& Talented) due to her extraordinary drawing ability.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed that her success and happiness at school was linked to how good<br/>
each teacher was.  I wish there were times I had  spoken up more for her<br/>
needs to be met.  You are your child&#39;s only consistent advocate.  Don&#39;t be a<br/>
coward like I was.  I tended to fear that being a squeaky wheel would mean<br/>
my child would somehow be punished ~ conditioning from my being raised in a<br/>
very strict, dictatorial, fundamentalist Christian cult (plus having a<br/>
rage-aholic, Italian father).<br/>
<br/>
Looking back now at the times when I didn&#39;t buck the system in order to keep<br/>
the peace, I feel now that I just ended up sacrificing my child.<br/>
<br/>
It helps to get the teacher on your side ~ be friendly, help a lot, send in<br/>
stuff they need, try not to complain about the little stuff.  Most teachers<br/>
are very grateful for supportive parents and will give more to the students<br/>
from those families.<br/>
<br/>
I stayed away from the PTA and School Site Council.  Heard they were cliques<br/>
and &quot;snake pits&quot;.  Didn&#39;t find out until later that this wasn&#39;t really true.<br/>
Most of those moms worked as hard as teachers.<br/>
<br/>
But I still wouldn&#39;t join.  Too much red tape to get anything done!  I just<br/>
picked which projects I was personally interested in and helped with those.<br/>
<br/>
If you can, make friends with the school secretary.  Usually they are the<br/>
real power behind the throne, but unfortunately, often real Broomhilda&#39;s.  I<br/>
managed to get on the bad side of all the school secretaries I met, mostly<br/>
because I asked questions I wasn&#39;t supposed to and refused to brown-nose.<br/>
<br/>
If you run into classmates who are bullies or harm your child, keep a record<br/>
of it (date, details, etc.).  If it happens more than once or is serious<br/>
enough, complain in writing.  Usually nobody in the administration would<br/>
follow up on it, but sure enough ~ as soon as enough people complained or<br/>
someone threatened a lawsuit, then they would come asking for my account of<br/>
past incidents.  The politics will make you sick.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that made me sick was you couldn&#39;t get a straight answer out<br/>
of anyone.  Everyone was afraid to speak the truth or give an honest opinion<br/>
or stand up for the best interests of the students (vs. the District or<br/>
administration or teachers interests).<br/>
<br/>
Writing this down is helping me to see why I was driven to homeschool!  Hope<br/>
I didn&#39;t discourage you too much.  I hear we have a really crappy District<br/>
office compared to most, so maybe the tone set in our District is why I ran<br/>
into so much grief along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837257035">No, you didn&#39;t discourage me.  Standing up for him is precisely the <br/>
reason it was hard.  They called me on Tuesday.  School started the <br/>
following monday.  Not much time. I insisted on going to the school <br/>
and looking it over and talking to as many people as possible.  The <br/>
secretary reminded me that school was starting in just a few days and <br/>
they were very busy getting ready.  I insisted.  We didn&#39;t care how <br/>
long the waiting list was or how good they were supposed to be. He&#39;s <br/>
still my little boy.  <br/>
<br/>
The counselor and teachers understood.  My husband and i were <br/>
emphatic that our primary concern was the environment not the <br/>
academics.  We wanted him to feel safe and comfortable there. And <br/>
that he was the one making the final decision.<br/>
<br/>
So far they&#39;ve been cool about it.  Even about switching him to 2nd.  <br/>
Even though they believe he&#39;s fine academically in 3rd they&#39;ve <br/>
acknowledged he feels it&#39;s too hard for him right now and wants to be <br/>
in 2nd.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish i didn&#39;t have to work.  But I&#39;m trying to concentrate on the <br/>
things I can change right now and be positive about the rest.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-874407355">&lt;&lt; It helps to get the teacher on your side ~ be friendly, help a lot, send in<br/>
<br/>
stuff they need, try not to complain about the little stuff.  Most teachers<br/>
<br/>
are very grateful for supportive parents and will give more to the students<br/>
<br/>
from those families. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the mom really doesn&#39;t believe in school, this might not be the best way <br/>
to go.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another point of view, involving detachment:<br/>

<br/>
This I do agree with:<br/>
<br/>
-=-f you run into classmates who are bullies or harm your child, keep a record<br/>
<br/>
of it (date, details, etc.).  If it happens more than once or is serious<br/>
<br/>
enough, complain in writing.  Usually nobody in the administration would<br/>
<br/>
follow up on it, but sure enough ~ as soon as enough people complained or<br/>
<br/>
someone threatened a lawsuit, then they would come asking for my account of<br/>
<br/>
past incidents.  The politics will make you sick.<br/>

If your son does want to leave school, do not worry, you can STILL <br/>
homeschool, and even work full time if necessary.<br/>
There are lots of options, as long as you and your husband remain <br/>
flexible and teachable yourselves :)<br/>
