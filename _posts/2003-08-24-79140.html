&quot;Gee, if you were unschooling you wouldn&#39;t have to think about that <br/>
at all&quot;. She was not   amused.<br/>
I often feel with regular school-at-home type HSers that I must not mention <br/>
the joys of unschooling my children, that they feel very threatened by it.One <br/>
woman was asking me about unschooling and kept coming back to her concern <br/>
about <br/>
retaining Authority over her children. What is with this????<br/>
I want to be an advocate for unschooling, yet am not comfortable really <br/>
talking about it to these other homeschoolers because it seems to freak them <br/>
out. <br/>
Any one else go thru this?What do you do?<br/>
Also, how do I get over this weird desire to buy school supplies every time <br/>
school rolls around?&lt;G&gt;<br/>

I too feel at odds with the school-at-homers. Most of the people I know in <br/>
our area are very nice, but Oh! Don&#39;t mention what you do! They look at you like <br/>
the lady in the boutique in Pretty Woman looked at Julia Roberts right before <br/>
she tells her &quot;We don&#39;t have anything here that will fit you.&quot; At 4-H the <br/>
other night; the only other unschooler mom I know in my town and I were talking. <br/>
Another Mom came up and said; &quot;I am starting the Five In A Row coop up again, <br/>
are either of you interested?&quot; The other Mom just shook her head and said no, <br/>
but I had to open my big mouth and say; &quot;Oh, thanks for offering, but we don&#39;t <br/>
use curriculums, we unschool... blah blah blah!&quot; &lt;g&gt; This lady smiled a tight <br/>
smile and said; &quot;Well that is why we use Five In A Row! We like the <br/>
unschoolish leanings, you should check it out!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Once, when we first started, a Mom was giving me all this advice on how you <br/>
have to start your day early so the kids can have breakfast eaten and dishes <br/>
done while you set everything up at the table. Then she said you have to make <br/>
the kids understand that from 9 to 3 you are NOT Mom, you are the teacher! You <br/>
have to get control right from the start or they will never respect you or <br/>
buckle down. She said and I quote; &quot;There will be days when your kids hate you, <br/>
but you have to keep that goal in sight at all times and having them hate you <br/>
for a little while is a small price to pay, besides it is good for them.&quot; I was <br/>
in shock and had no response. She smiled and patted me on the knee. As if I <br/>
needed her comfort! UGH!<br/>
<br/>
As for buying school supplies, I still do. I love this time of the year! I <br/>
get paper, new markers, glue, unbroken crayons... all at huge sales! I stock up. <br/>
Our house is full of writers and artists, and when Crayola&#39;s are on sale we <br/>
buy! Don&#39;t look at it as back to &quot;School&quot; stuff, look at it as July and August <br/>
are great sale months for unschoolers to get new packs of crayons and glue for <br/>
their kids to make huge paper domes, airplanes, and mobiles in fusha and <br/>
chartreuse! My kids love to go to Target and Walmart and see all the harried Moms <br/>
and kids running around with their lists while they happily put what ever <br/>
catches their eye in the cart knowing that soon the park wont be so crowded. That <br/>
soon they wont have to share the bike trails, the man at the museum wont be so <br/>
grumpy and will be happy to see &quot;his favorite kids&quot; back. They love to see <br/>
the looks on other kids faces when chatty Mom&#39;s ask if they got the teacher they <br/>
wanted this year, and they get to say &quot;YES! We got the best teacher of all! <br/>
Ourselves! We don&#39;t have to go to school!&quot; or their favorite, &quot;Is that all that <br/>
is on your list this year?&quot; asked by the Mom in line behind us as our total <br/>
is $11.62 and she knows her total is going to be something like $111.62 and my <br/>
kids get to say, &quot;We don&#39;t know what is on our list this year, we haven&#39;t made <br/>
one yet.&quot; and then turn to me and ask if I will move some of my plants on the <br/>
porch so they can make a fort. Because they want to bombard Dad, when he gets <br/>
home, with all the planes they are going to make with the paper we just <br/>
bought. Ahh the glory of back to school sales! Revel in them, gloat in your leisure <br/>
as you sail through the crowded aisles, picking and choosing what you will! <br/>

I am very afraid of people like that. Then she will wonder why her children <br/>
don&#39;t visit her in the old folk&#39;s home!<br/>
Good advice on the school supply front from everybody so far.Just may have to <br/>
check that out.<br/>
My son&#39;s friend is starting junior high school this year.Grade 8 in Canada. <br/>
He says he is very nervous. I wish I could keep him home with me. Funny the <br/>
kids don&#39;t feel so sorry for my son this year because doesn&#39;t go to school. <br/>
they have been hanging around here a lot this summer and see what he gets to do <br/>
all the time. <br/>

Exactly! Or she will wonder why they dumped her in the worst pit in town <br/>
instead of the beautiful new senior living apartments! &lt;g&gt; I think of her every <br/>
now and then, I remember her beautiful kids and wonder how they are doing and <br/>
how much they hate her now! <br/>
BTW, how many Nancy&#39;s are there here? I&#39;ve been off list for ever! I guess I <br/>
will have to change my signature to Nancy in Kansas! <br/>
