<br/>
That&#39;s exactly what we&#39;ve done! I HAVE a teenager---14; he&#39;ll be 15 in <br/>
January (Time flies!). We&#39;ve dicussed drugs for years. I&#39;ve never even puffed <br/>
a joint (I&#39;m 42), so my personal experience is quite limited. But we&#39;ve <br/>
talked and talked and talked. <br/>
<br/>
All his friends are doing all kinds of drugs. He told me the other day that <br/>
he had just tried marijuana with some buddies. I had told him that I&#39;d rather <br/>
that he get in touch with a friend of mine who gets organic dope so that we <br/>
KNOW what&#39;s in it, but anyway...he thought they were all really goofy and it <br/>
wasn&#39;t so much the getting high and smoking, but the whole act of DEFYING <br/>
their parents. He may do it again and again---I can&#39;t say, but he had wanted <br/>
to see what all the hullabaloo was about. He&#39;s not impressed with some of his <br/>
buddies who have become pot-heads---they do NOTHING in their spare time but <br/>
smoke. He has other interets (these boys are all in school).<br/>
<br/>
Their parents said only, &quot;Don&#39;t do it!&quot;. I think the more extreme the limits, <br/>
the more likely that the child will MEAN to defy. Cameron told me a day or <br/>
two afterwards. I didn&#39;t shame him or demand that he NEVER do it again. I DID <br/>
reiterate that you can&#39;t be sure what all&#39;s in the joint (laced with PCP?), <br/>
and that I&#39;d rather he question where it came from, etc. As for its leading <br/>
to other drugs, why? He has SO much freedom--and he always has. He&#39;s <br/>
comfortable talking to me about it all. <br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t force a teen to do anything---other than really look forward to <br/>
getting out of your home and into his own---just to get away from YOU! That <br/>
works every day! I hear teens ALL the time saying how they can&#39;t WAIT to get <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
You CAN be open and honest and giving and forgiving. You CAN have a teen <br/>
confide in you and trust you and believe in you.<br/>
<br/>
Do I want Cameron to &quot;get into&quot; drugs? Not my choice. He will or won&#39;t. I <br/>
just want him to be informed. And to come to me if there&#39;s a problem. I won&#39;t <br/>
shame him if he becomes a coke-head. If he wants to change, I&#39;m there to <br/>
help. Besides, it&#39;s an INTERNAL thing. I can&#39;t coerce him to stop if he&#39;s not <br/>
willing. It MUST be HIS decision. As are all things.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s fifteen (almost). He&#39;ll be twenty in a VERY short time. If I&#39;ve done my <br/>
job right, he&#39;ll be a healthy, well-adjusted adult who CAN make wise choices <br/>
because he&#39;s always been allowed to, not because he&#39;s been forced to. (Same <br/>
with food, by the way---some of those children who have been denied <br/>
McDonald&#39;s all their lives may turn into regular junk-food junkies! Think <br/>
about it! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
