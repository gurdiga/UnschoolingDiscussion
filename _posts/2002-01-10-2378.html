would<br/>
life be like if we were all free to simply be?  To be<br/>

think about.<br/>
<br/>
***Well, this is something that I&#39;ve been thinking<br/>
about too.. It seems to me that the people who feel<br/>
that their kids need to be controlled and limited the<br/>
most are those who don&#39;t trust their *own* nature...<br/>
How can you let your kids stay up as late as they<br/>
want, watch as much TV as they want, or choose their<br/>
own diet if you feel that if *you* were given the<br/>
freedom to do those things, everything would fall<br/>
apart?  It seems people regulate themselves more by<br/>
what they think they *should* do, than by what they<br/>
*want* to do. <br/>
<br/>
I would like to have enough faith in myself, and<br/>
people in general to think that left alone to listen<br/>
to ourselves, everything would work itself out... Most<br/>
people seem to perceive this as my being naive... oh<br/>
well :)  I guess we&#39;ll find out eventually! <br/>
<br/>
Love, Tori <br/>
