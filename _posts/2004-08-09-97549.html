<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804741108">By Tuesday morning we should have another 15 rooms opened up (for about a <br/>
week, or until they are full) at the conference site, the Peabody Marriott, at <br/>
the Live and Learn conference rate. If you want to be at the Marriott but <br/>
weren&#39;t able to get  reservations, give it a try.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it&#39;d be great if anyone planning to attend the conference would <br/>
subscribe to the LiveandLearn2004 e-mail list if you haven&#39;t already done so. There <br/>
will likely be important updates in the next couple of weeks, and I don&#39;t want <br/>
to clutter other lists with them.<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn Baptista, Conference Coordinator<br/>
<br/>
Come to the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference August 27-29 in Peabody, MA!<br/>

Unless the moderators have asked you to be very, very quiet about the <br/>
Live and Learn Conference coming up, I would urge you NOT to hide your <br/>
light under a bushel barrel.  Talk it up here some more!<br/>
<br/>
(Taking the minutiae off list makes sense to me, but c&#39;mon, let&#39;s have <br/>
some more noise.)<br/>
<br/>
I realize that Sales and Marketing are sometimes considered &quot;vulgar&quot;, <br/>
but you are &quot;selling&quot; an unschooling conference to the unschooled.  <br/>
Seems appropriate for this list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-462383068">Please talk it up!  It seems like all the list I&#39;m on with large <br/>
groups of Christian homeschoolers have post after post about their <br/>
conferences and the moderators don&#39;t seem to mind.  They talk at <br/>
length about the speakers, last year&#39;s conference, where to meet each <br/>
other and there are lots of tips (don&#39;t bring the kids, don&#39;t buy <br/>
anything the first day but spend like crazy on the last).  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling conferences are like some secret get-together.  No one <br/>
talks about them much on the lists I&#39;m on except to speculate why one <br/>
has stopped.  So let everyone know howmuch you loved the last <br/>
conference you went to and why.  Sharing something good is not <br/>
imposing your will on them.   <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers often say that they don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; conferences but it&#39;s not <br/>
about need- it&#39;s about fun and learning and getting together and <br/>
laughing and late night discussions.  We can all *use* those things <br/>
even if we don&#39;t need any actual unschooling support.<br/>
<br/>
You know how energized you feel after going to an unschooling park <br/>
day, talking to people who understand you and watching your kids play <br/>
with other children raised in freedom?  It&#39;s like that only 100 times <br/>
better!<br/>
<br/>

There&#39;s a whole list for those kinds of details, for the people who are going <br/>
or thinking about going, though.<br/>

They are really tranforming for most people who go.  I hear lots of people <br/>
say &quot;If I had done this a year ago (or two or three) things would have been SO <br/>
much better at my house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a conference in Sacramento SOON, Boston right after, and a little one <br/>
in Chicago (one day, small) September 11.  That one&#39;s not a whole families <br/>
hotel thing, but for those who are able to go it will probably be a big boost of <br/>
confidence and camaraderie.<br/>

people not on the list who may have gone to a *home*schooling <br/>
conferences before and found them boring or who think they don&#39;t need <br/>
conferences who need to hear how fun, life changing, informational <br/>
and supportive unschooling conferences can be for them and their <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need unschooling conferences just like we don&#39;t need <br/>
chocolate.<br/>
