<div id="ygrps-yiv-786793011">This is from an e-mail I  just sent to a long-time friend who only lately <br/>
started homeschooling and a just-introduced-by-email already-unschooler.  In <br/>
England they call it (&quot;it&quot; &lt;g&gt;  &quot;They&quot; &lt;BWG&gt;) &quot;home education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wrote this to the quote below:<br/>
=============<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; All of Sandra&#39;s kids have been home-educated  <br/>
since they were babes and are all quality human-beings. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, thanks.<br/>
I know that&#39;s the local terminology where you are, but it jumps out at me as <br/>
wrong.<br/>
They have not been educated, and they weren&#39;t &quot;home educated.&quot; <br/>
They have learned, all their lives, in the real world.<br/>
<br/>
Ah.  I feel better now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
