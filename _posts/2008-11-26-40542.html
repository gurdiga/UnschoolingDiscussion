<div id="ygrps-yiv-936155987">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
There was recently a post on either this board or a similar one that<br/>
included a really insightful poem about a young child at school, full<br/>
of creativity, that is stifled by the constant requests from the<br/>
teacher to &quot;do it this way&quot; etc.  The poem progresses to the point<br/>
where the child no longer has any creativity left.  It&#39;s brilliant,<br/>
but I can&#39;t find it anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any idea which thread it was in, or even if it was on this<br/>
board?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Karen A</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409225706">Do you mean the Happy Chapin song, &quot;Flowers are Red&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
The little boy went first day of school<br/>
He got some crayons and started to draw<br/>
He put colors all over the paper<br/>
For colors was what he saw<br/>
And the teacher said.. What you doin&#39; young man<br/>
I&#39;m paintin&#39; flowers he said<br/>
She said... It&#39;s not the time for art young man<br/>
And anyway flowers are green and red<br/>
There&#39;s a time for everything young man<br/>
And a way it should be done<br/>
You&#39;ve got to show concern for everyone else<br/>
For you&#39;re not the only one<br/>
<br/>
And she said...<br/>
Flowers are red young man<br/>
Green leaves are green<br/>
There&#39;s no need to see flowers any other way<br/>
Than the way they always have been seen<br/>
<br/>
But the little boy said...<br/>
There are so many colors in the rainbow<br/>
So many colors in the morning sun<br/>
So many colors in the flower and I see every one<br/>
<br/>
Well the teacher said.. You&#39;re sassy<br/>
There&#39;s ways that things should be<br/>
And you&#39;ll paint flowers the way they are<br/>
So repeat after me.....<br/>
<br/>
And she said...<br/>
Flowers are red young man<br/>
Green leaves are green<br/>
There&#39;s no need to see flowers any other way<br/>
Than the way they always have been seen<br/>
<br/>
But the little boy said...<br/>
There are so many colors in the rainbow<br/>
So many colors in the morning sun<br/>
So many colors in the flower and I see every one<br/>
<br/>
The teacher put him in a corner<br/>
She said.. It&#39;s for your own good..<br/>
And you won&#39;t come out &#39;til you get it right<br/>
And all responding like you should<br/>
Well finally he got lonely<br/>
Frightened thoughts filled his head<br/>
And he went up to the teacher<br/>
And this is what he said.. and he said<br/>
<br/>
Flowers are red, green leaves are green<br/>
There&#39;s no need to see flowers any other way<br/>
Than the way they always have been seen<br/>
<br/>
Time went by like it always does<br/>
And they moved to another town<br/>
And the little boy went to another school<br/>
And this is what he found<br/>
The teacher there was smilin&#39;<br/>
She said...Painting should be fun<br/>
And there are so many colors in a flower<br/>
So let&#39;s use every one<br/>
<br/>
But that little boy painted flowers<br/>
In neat rows of green and red<br/>
And when the teacher asked him why<br/>
This is what he said.. and he said<br/>
<br/>
Flowers are red, green leaves are green<br/>
There&#39;s no need to see flowers any other way<br/>
Than the way they always have been seen.<br/>
