 </span></blockquote>If kids come over to our house and play with my kids toys and are not<br/>
considerate, my boys get really upset, too.<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair that guests should be able to come over and do as<br/>
they please without any regard to mess or whatever.<br/>
First, I think it&#39;s the fault of the parent (or adult) in charge who has<br/>
brought the kids over.<br/>
If my kids make a mess at someone else&#39;s house, I make sure that they help<br/>
put the mess away before we leave. If the mom or whoever says &quot;just leave<br/>
it - you guys don&#39;t need to clean this up&quot; then that&#39;s another matter. But<br/>
we always offer to clean up what the kids have all played with - and I will<br/>
get right in there (especially when they were younger) and help clean up,<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as for what to do if the adult in charge at your house just doesn&#39;t<br/>
have a clue of offering to help clean up (or keep toys in order, as you<br/>
pointed out was another problem).<br/>
I would have no problem in voicing my concerns next time they come over<br/>
*before* the play session begins. I would say something like &quot;if you are all<br/>
going to play with those toys, then you all must agree to help clean them up<br/>
when you are done.&quot; I would include my kids in on &quot;the one&#39;s who will help<br/>
clean up&quot;, just so that it is everyone cleaning up together and so noone is<br/>
being singled out. I would also say all this in front of the mom (or adult<br/>
in charge) to let them know that this has been a problem in the past and<br/>
hopefully she will be sensitive to helping out.<br/>
<br/>
If none of this works and kids coming over still make and leave a mess and<br/>
disregard you and your children&#39;s feelings, I wouldn&#39;t invite them over<br/>
anymore.<br/>

<br/>
I can relate totally. I agree with you. I have four children and they<br/>
have lots of organized toys that they have enough trouble keeping in<br/>
order. They find it most frustrating when children come over and<br/>
demolish the place. We are trying to realize that &quot;younger&quot; children<br/>
will naturally do that and we cannot expect them to tidy up themselves -<br/>
so we have a group clean-up (usually begun by the visiting mother who<br/>
feels bad) after I ask my children to get involved. It seems to work out<br/>
and they understand that younger kids just require &quot;a hand&quot; as They Did<br/>
when they were younger. <br/>
<br/>
If I had children over that were old enough to know to help tidy after<br/>
they were done playing, then I too would think twice about having them<br/>
over again. Who needs it?<br/>

can make.  You can&#39;t make a decision for someone else though.  You can&#39;t <br/>
demand that company helps out.  They have a choice and you have a choice not <br/>
to have them back if you don&#39;t like the way they acted.  If your children <br/>
don&#39;t like the way their toys are played with they can make the choice about <br/>
which toys they will allow company to play with.  I would help my children <br/>
decide that ahead of time.  When that person came to visit those toys would <br/>
go into a closet.  I never expect others to clean up.  If they do great.  And <br/>
children love to come to our house.  They can play with whatever and mix and <br/>
match toys and leave happy and it takes a few minutes to scoop up the LEGOs <br/>
and put them away and straighten all the books and pick up the empty <br/>
wrappers.  And I love the fact that my boys have had a great day playing.  I <br/>
know after a day of quilting with my best friend I never feel like cleaning <br/>
up.  We have a cup of tea before she leaves back to NYC.  I take a day or two <br/>
to look at what we accomplished and then get down to business and pick up <br/>
fabric and thread pieces etc.  Sometimes it takes me a week to feel &quot;in the <br/>
mood to straighten.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Everyone has a different view of clean or neat.  If I constantly worry about <br/>
the mess after company leaves or if they are going to offer to help or not <br/>
then brood about how they left and didn&#39;t clean up, etc., then I totally mess <br/>
up the experience.<br/>

That would be up to my children. If kids stress them out and they don&#39;t enjoy <br/>

But if they have friends that do some annoying things, then I need to find <br/>
ways to help everyone deal with it.<br/>
If my children have toys they don&#39;t like messed with, we put those up when <br/>
company comes. Problem solved.<br/>
We only have things out that are ok to tear into.<br/>
And with very young children this is natural.<br/>
<br/>
I try to clean a little here and there to keep a floor space available.<br/>
But I guess I just figure when company comes, chaos is going to happen to <br/>
some degree....that&#39;s ok.<br/>
When food is all over the floor and dishes strewn all over the house, THAT is <br/>
when I go bonkers.<br/>

<br/>
My boys are free to have company over just as I am and if the toys aren&#39;t <br/>
neat enough for their comfort level then they pick them up.  If it isn&#39;t neat <br/>
enough for my comfort level then I clean them up.  If they said they didn&#39;t <br/>
like how their toys were left (they have never said that) then we would talk <br/>
about ways to avoid that.  Excluding that person isn&#39;t the only answer.  <br/>
Maybe playing at a park or having a picnic.  Putting some toys away. Etc.<br/>

I agree.  I encourage my kids to help out at someone else&#39;s house, and I encourage guests to help out at my house too (if its a huge overwhelming mess for all of us).  But under ordinary circumstances, I don&#39;t make an issue out of it.<br/>
<br/>
There are times when my neighbor calls and requests that one of my kids comes back over to help clean up and I send them.  But my kids are ok with that, because they know that I will do the same for them if its really that bad.  Now if I&#39;m the one requesting the return of a child, and the neighbor mom or the child says &quot;no&quot;, then thats fine.  But I do sometimes make that request.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-727764117">First of all I have a big problem with anyone who says to me &quot;you should&quot; <br/>
anything. My in laws use to tell me what I should and shouldn&#39;t do all the <br/>
time. It&#39;s a major sore spot with me. I don&#39;t see them anymore.<br/>
<br/>
So right off the bat, the mom who said I should make my kids clean up would <br/>
hear from me. I would try and be nice. It doesn&#39;t always work. I can <br/>
honestly say that whenever my kids have gone to anyone else&#39;s house, they <br/>
never have made a major mess. I have pitched in and started to pick up a few <br/>
stragglers laying around, but the kids are usually pretty good about picking <br/>
up. Then to, the homes they have been in are relatively neat and they follow <br/>
suit of the family that lives there. Most times the mom will say to leave <br/>
the stuff as there isn&#39;t much anyway.<br/>
<br/>
When children come here, which is more often than the other way around, my <br/>
kids know they can have house rules as to how they want their things played <br/>
with. Not how to play exactly but how to handle things. It&#39;s their <br/>
belongings and they are entitled to not share if they don&#39;t want to. I don&#39;t <br/>
like when parents make their children share everything they have. My kids <br/>
want kids to have fun and come over, so they naturally want them to play <br/>
with stuff. If there are a few things they are hesitent about, we put them <br/>
away before the other children come over. If a child was doing something to <br/>
one of my chldrens toys that made them uncomfortable, I would have no <br/>
problem saying that so and so doesn&#39;t like when someone does that. Never had <br/>
it happen though. But when they were younger, we did put things away ahead <br/>
of time. Now the children don&#39;t mind. Of course their friends are respectful <br/>
of their things too.<br/>
<br/>
So far my children and those visiting have played equally with the toys. <br/>
When they are finished, my kids start to clean up and usually the other <br/>
child will too. Sometimes the other mom will mention for the child to help <br/>
clean up. If it seems overwhelming and they want to move on to other things, <br/>
I will step in and take over. So far it&#39;s never been a major deal. If a <br/>
child came here and randomly took things apart without even being involved <br/>
with my children, I would step in and say something to the child. In a very <br/>
nice here&#39;s what we do here kind of way. So far I haven&#39;t run into any <br/>
problems.<br/>

to be put aside.  Here, we have certain toys that are off-limits to other<br/>
kids.  When Tim was littler, we used to put some boxes of them up or away<br/>
when guests came.  Now, most of our usual guests just know that the legos<br/>
are not for sharing.  That may sound cruel, since most kids love legos, but<br/>
if you move his knights and castle stuff at all, Tim completely melts down.<br/>
That&#39;s not fun for anyone, and most visitors have seen it at least once.<br/>
<br/>
So we get out other cool stuff while they&#39;re here, instead.  And some toys,<br/>
like the train set, seem to never get played with except when other kids are<br/>
here!  That works, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083096788">I&#39;ve asked kids to help clean up, but for reasons like &quot;Could you put this <br/>
back up so the puppy doesn&#39;t get it&quot; or &quot;Could you put the game up so the <br/>
pieces don&#39;t get lost?&quot;  though usually my kids are anal about games <br/>
themselves.   But asking someone to put something up because they&#39;re about to <br/>
go and do something they want to do even more is easy.   <br/>
<br/>
I think in the scenario presented, asking a kid who&#39;s about to go home to <br/>
clean up a house she&#39;s about to leave is just the wrong place and the wrong <br/>
time.   She probably doesn&#39;t want to go home, and so being punished (if she <br/>
sees it that way) and threatened AND having to go home is a lot all at once.<br/>
<br/>
A method we figured out with birthday parties in a small house was to move <br/>
the activities to another room every half an hour or so.  At our house now, <br/>
we have more room, but in the little house, we&#39;d do games in the living room, <br/>
while someone was setting up food on the patio, and then get the kids to go <br/>
out there.  We&#39;d re-stage the living room so that when the food was more mess <br/>
than current, we&#39;d lure them away from there and pick it up while they <br/>
weren&#39;t right there.  A good trashcan with a liner helps, but it&#39;s easier for <br/>
me to throw a cakey plate in the trash than to try to make someone else do <br/>
it.  And NO, the value of the lesson isn&#39;t more important.  It&#39;s a party.<br/>
<br/>
Same with visits.  I treat them like parties.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944506849">I have some issues with other people&#39;s kids and messes in my house.  I let<br/>
my kids choose what they allow other kids to play with, but having only two<br/>
children, our house is full of stuff that belongs to them and the stuff<br/>
lives in our living room or kitchen on our shelves (or on the floor if it&#39;s<br/>
in use).  We don&#39;t have the kids keep all their stuff in their rooms like<br/>
some families have to, to keep stuff away from younger children. My kids<br/>
rarely play in their rooms because they like to be where dh and I are.<br/>
 <br/>
When young kids visit we try to put stuff  we don&#39;t want to share out of<br/>
sight, but it just isn&#39;t possible to put everything out of sight.  I swear,<br/>
we rarely have company without something getting broken.  It is so<br/>
frustrating.  We try to pick up everything off the floor so that things<br/>
don&#39;t get stepped on but it seems that something gets broken almost every<br/>
time.  <br/>
 <br/>
It makes me feel badly when kids take out things that my kids don&#39;t want<br/>
them to play with and I have to tell them &quot;sorry, but dd doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
share that.&quot;  I feel like my kids don&#39;t want to share a lot of stuff, but I<br/>
can&#39;t say I blame them with the track record we have for guests breaking<br/>
things.   I have even learned to put away a lot of stuff that I don&#39;t mind<br/>
kids *playing* with, because  we have our toys somewhat organized and we all<br/>
get frustrated when our bins of stuff and games and puzzles are just dumped<br/>
out with no regard for them.  It can take hours even days to put things back<br/>
the way we had them.  My kids value their stuff and they don&#39;t understand it<br/>
when other kids don&#39;t treat their stuff with the same respect.    It&#39;s<br/>
really a pain to have to spend half a day getting ready for guests but I<br/>
haven&#39;t found an easier way.  Any ideas?<br/>
 <br/>
When it come to visiting other people&#39;s houses.  If we create the mess, I<br/>
help the kids clean up.  What I find overwhelming is to come into a house<br/>
where it is already a total disaster and then have my kids contribute to it.<br/>
Those days I often just leave the mess because I can&#39;t even see where to<br/>
begin, but I always feel guilty about it.  I guess it might help to ask what<br/>
I could do to help.<br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-832479678"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s<br/>

  haven&#39;t found an easier way.  Any ideas?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  Perhaps just keep a box in *your* bedroom and just put all that they don&#39;t want to share in there temporarily until the guests leave.  Even when I have adult friends over, if things are messier than I can deal with, I just gather everything up in large armfuls and dump them on my bed, then I just close the door.<br/>

<br/>
  I wouldn&#39;t ask in that case. Depending on whose house it is and what the mess is made of, I&#39;d either just leave, or I&#39;d just ask my kids to help me pick up a handful of things as a token of friendship before leaving.<br/>
<br/>
  Most people who have a disaster, (and we know one family like this) understand that if they can&#39;t keep after it themselves they should not be asking my kids to do it for them.  But we&#39;re talking about an extreme case here that is not just a case of clutter.  I&#39;m very flexible when it comes to a clean house.  And this lady has more kids than I do and works outside the home, so I undertand it is difficult.  But I&#39;d venture to say there are some health hazards there, and thats putting it politely.<br/>

that says &quot;oh, don&#39;t worry about it&quot; and really means it.<br/>
My house is messy it doesn&#39;t bother me.  When company comes over they make <br/>
more of a mess but always have fun and usually tell the boys that they have <br/>
the coolest Mom.  I would rather be thought of as fun and see my boys having <br/>
a terrific time.  I am not sure why you would find it overwhelming if it <br/>
isn&#39;t your house.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987993754">Ah, the comforts of clutter!! :-D  I&#39;m so glad not to be the only one!!  I <br/>
would be the mom who absolutely does not worry about cleanup after a play <br/>
date ~ first, because I want the focus to be on play and friendships, and <br/>
second, because my kids are always willing to clean with me after a playdate, <br/>
while we chat about the good time had by all.  That said, I don&#39;t often let <br/>
strangers into my home unless I am assured the clutter won&#39;t shock them right <br/>
out of our friendship!  Right now, I can count three distinguished, yet <br/>
unfinished, projects with lots of run-on between them.  Hayden, 4, will help <br/>
pick up if I mention the potential loss of parts by leaving things unattended <br/>
in the living room.  Hannah&#39;s just happy to do anything I do, she&#39;s more of a <br/>
cooperative cleaner :)  <br/>
<br/>
I subscribed to FlyLady (Finally Loving Yourself, Lady) but quickly <br/>
discontinued because I spent far more time reading the e-mail alerts than I <br/>
did applying the program.  I like spending whole days in my jammies, without <br/>
the bed made, and shoeless :)<br/>
<br/>
What I found that worked is a book called, Clearing Your Clutter with Feng <br/>
Shui, by Karen Kingston.  When I feel a place in my life is *stuck* I <br/>
research the baguas (areas of the structure which translate into areas of <br/>
your life) and sure enough, I&#39;ll find a huge cluttered mess there.  I&#39;ll <br/>
clean it out and viola! my life has improved.  When I&#39;m listless and without <br/>
energy, getting the chi flowing thru the house by clearing a bit of the <br/>
clutter really works ~ and not just for me, the kids sense it too!  This <br/>
week, we&#39;re working on our Travel & Helpful Friends Bagua, as we prepare for <br/>
our family trip to CA. (okay, any excuse to get the living room <br/>
presentable!!) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117793552">**For example, the kids have a<br/>
large bin of Playmobil that they play exclusively Lord of the Rings with,<br/>
and another bin of just assorted Playmobil.  We have kids come over who dump<br/>
out both sets on the floor, pull all the hair off the characters, tear off<br/>
their costumes, and then leave them mixed in a heap.  My kids hate sorting<br/>
out that kind of a mess, and so do I.  They have them sorted the way they<br/>
want them, and want to act things out with them -- not waste hours finding<br/>
the right hair for the characters and all their little props. **<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Deb --<br/>
<br/>
We also have two Playmobil containers and visitors who love to take the<br/>
people&#39;s hair off more than to do anything else.  I sympathize!<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend that you find a way to separate your two containers,<br/>
preferably keeping them in separate rooms.<br/>
<br/>
I actually enjoy picking up toys more than most chores, and I&#39;m very<br/>
fast with visually sorting, but I couldn&#39;t correctly sort the Playmobils<br/>
at your house, I simply wouldn&#39;t know which ones go in which bin.  Your<br/>
guests aren&#39;t capable of doing this sorting without practice either.  As<br/>
you have noted, it&#39;s quite a difficult job.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
**I think that if my friends&#39; kids consistently made a huge mess for me and<br/>
*my* kids, we would either only visit there, or meet some place neutral.<br/>
What am I missing here?**<br/>
<br/>
Natural variation in play styles?  My friend has kids who definitely<br/>
strew FAR more toys per minute than my child does.  I figure I have it a<br/>
lot easier than she does and I count my blessings. &lt;g&gt;  Also, it&#39;s a<br/>
half-hour drive to her house, so if she comes here and I end up picking<br/>
up toys, it&#39;s still more convenient for me.</div>
