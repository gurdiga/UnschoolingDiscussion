&gt; My first born was born in Rabat and I lived there with my dh for <br/>
&gt; four years. My kids love it when we eat tagine so they can use <br/>
&gt; their fingers with impunity.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And Moroccans used to say that using steel (forks) ruined the <br/>
&gt; flavor of the foods and it also cooled the food down too quickly. <br/>
&gt; Fingers preserve flavor and heat! :)<br/>

and Spain. We stayed in a great little hotel at the medina in Marrakesh, did an <br/>
overnight excursion to the Sahara, etc. It was incredible...the place we most <br/>
want to go back.<br/>

<br/>
LOVE tagine!!!!  I wish desperately we&#39;d bought one while there.<br/>
