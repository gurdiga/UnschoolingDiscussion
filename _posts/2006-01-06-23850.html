<div id="ygrps-yiv-355018176"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;My answer is that, yes, I&#39;d like to see those<br/>
 </span></blockquote>discussions - of  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;sensitive, gifted, autistic, minority, very young,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>older, etc. &gt;HOW we understand to apply unschooling<br/>
principles when it isn&#39;t &gt;as simple/easy to see -<br/>
those insights are going to be very &gt;valuable to all<br/>
of us.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;-pam<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, I so agree Pam!  That&#39;s one reason I tend to stick<br/>
to a broader list like this one for unschooling<br/>
support, because I personally really thrive on<br/>
diversity of input.  It&#39;s sometimes usefull and<br/>
reassuring to drop in to a more specific list for kids<br/>
with special needs, just to read or to ask specific<br/>
questions that those folks would have experience with.<br/>
 But for general input and sharing, I have yet to find<br/>
a list that beats Alwayslearning.<br/>
