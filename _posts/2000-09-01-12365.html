Hi BIL --<br/>
<br/>
We unschool/relaxed homeschool because the education the school system was <br/>
offering was completely inadequate to meet the needs of our two children.  <br/>
The kids are bright and the class was geared toward the lower end of the <br/>
spectrum.  There was little flexibility in the school&#39;s approach -- sending <br/>
my son up a grade for reading once a day was the best they had.<br/>
<br/>
BIL -- you are right to be wary of this or any method of hsing!  Your house <br/>
and your life will be taken over.  You will become completely immersed in the <br/>
learning that your children are doing.  There will be books everywhere.  You <br/>
will need at least one more computer.  Your children will never be able to <br/>
just walk thru anywhere -- the zoo will take twice as long because they will <br/>
have to stop and examine the animals and comment and add what they know.  <br/>
They will actually pay attention to the world around them and this makes life <br/>
move more slowly.  <br/>
<br/>
And your wife -- you will not recognize her after a while.  She will be <br/>
covered with poster paint and glue and will be running to the book store or <br/>
the music lessons or the office supply store or the library at all hours.<br/>
<br/>
And she will need your help.  The kids will not be content to just know what <br/>
one book says.  They will want to know what you, Dad, think about things.  <br/>
They will ask you approximately 1,000,000 questions a day and expect you to <br/>
actually help them find the answers.  They will get better at this as they <br/>
get older and learn how to do research all by themselves but . . .<br/>
<br/>
Run now, Dad.  While you still have the chance.<br/>
<br/>
Nance (unschooling and loving it!)</div>

Hi, Julie --<br/>
<br/>
I think there are times when it makes sense to assign your BIL to write an <br/>
essay on &quot;Why School is So Damn Great&quot;.  (I bet you&#39;ll stump him.)<br/>
<br/>
I think most people who insist on school attendance believe two things:<br/>
<br/>
1) Forced memorization is the best or only way to learn things.  No pain, no <br/>
gain.  &quot;I would never have chosen to learn this stuff.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
2) An inherent belief that it is safer and better to do things the way they <br/>
have been done before.  (Repeating the same schooling pattern the parent <br/>
had.)  An ingrained belief that one&#39;s schooling was &quot;good for&quot; oneself, and <br/>
thus that it must be necessary to inflict an education like this on everyone.<br/>
<br/>
The counter arguments to #1 are:<br/>
<br/>
-- Watch a child learn to walk and speak a first language.  Both are <br/>
extremely difficult tasks.  The child undertakes these tasks willingly and <br/>
makes much more rapid progress than an adult would.  Drills are not <br/>
necessary.  The child finds his or her own opportunities to practice, when <br/>
ready.<br/>
<br/>
-- Look back at what you really did learn in 12 years of schooling.  How much <br/>
science did you learn in elementary school?  In middle school?  Can you solve <br/>
a physics problem or balance a chemical equation to save your life?  If you <br/>
studied a foreign language, can you speak it at all, beyond just saying Hello?<br/>
<br/>
I have to run, but maybe you can come up with good counter arguments for <br/>
point 2 yourself.  I&#39;m having a hard time getting past &quot;Duh.... get a clue!&quot;  <br/>
(And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s very persuasive. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  (I think setting aside all argument and getting your BIL to reminisce <br/>
about his school experiences is helpful.  It&#39;s good to see where he is coming <br/>
from.  I hope he can remember both good and bad things about going to school. <br/>
 I swear some men are so un-introspective they don&#39;t remember anything that <br/>
happened to them... at least they don&#39;t access these memories when they <br/>
discuss sending their kids to school.  I think sometimes it&#39;s due to too much <br/>
emotional scar tissue... but I don&#39;t know.)<br/>
<br/>
(Men, I apologize for generalizing.... but I have seen an awful lot of <br/>
boneheadedness, from dads, on the &quot;need&quot; for the schooling experience.  Ugh.  <br/>
Most moms, again generalizing, are less sold on any experience that involves <br/>
making their children suffer.)</div>

<br/>
I just got a book that you BIL should read (after you check it out<br/>
yourself).  The book, The Underground History of American Education by John<br/>
Taylor Gatto.  This is a prerelease & has more in to than the release that<br/>
is set for Jan 2001.  You can get it from Elijah Company<br/>
1-888-2-ELIJAH  www.elijahco.com  $27.00.  Gatto was a ps teacher & quit.<br/>
It is not just his experiences but a history of American education, which he<br/>
documents for your further research as desired.  It really makes it clearer<br/>
to me what&#39;s wrong with ps.  DH thought I had all the points down for any<br/>
questions till I started reading & now have awhole new set of answers.</div>

(list price $30).<br/>
<br/>
I posted a review to the list back in June when the book first came out you<br/>
can go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fun-books.com/specials.htm">http://www.fun-books.com/specials.htm</a> and click on the cover image<br/>
to see the review.<br/>
<br/>
John is no longer looking for a publisher for the book and will continue to<br/>
self publish it (do not confuse this with being &quot;homemade,&quot; the book is<br/>
professionally printed and bound, he just made his printing arrangements<br/>
directly without going through a publisher).<br/>
<br/>
A documentary film based on the book is in the works and John decided he<br/>
could keep all his options open better by not signing on with a publisher.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516319503">Because it works!  Youngest kidlet is 8 and she is reading the American<br/>
Girl Diaries series, doing multiplications and fractions, botany and<br/>
writing stories and inventing crossword puzzles.  Because we taught her? <br/>
Because we forced her to go to kiddie prison?  NO!  She wanted to.  She<br/>
seeks and finds her own interests and she enjoys doing it!<br/>
<br/>
Next is kidlet #5 who is 12.  He has invented a totally enviornmentally<br/>
friendly engine which he will be entering in the science fair this year. <br/>
He has read just about every astronomy book our local library has and quite<br/>
a few they don&#39;t.  He is reading consumer law this year and the history of<br/>
the court system.  He struggles with math because he attended ps and the<br/>
whole climate encourages math phobia.  However, he is slugging along at it<br/>
and we are buying various different things to help him because he has<br/>
decided he wants to be a lawyer, a sports lawyer and he knows that he will<br/>
need to be able to figure out what is the best deal for his clients and<br/>
that takes math.  His choice!<br/>
<br/>
Kidlet #4 is going to be a veterinarian.  He&#39;s currently driving me crazy<br/>
surfing the net trying to find the best chemistry info he can.  He&#39;s a very<br/>
picky shopper &lt;g&gt;  What he really wants is a complete lab but wants it at<br/>
the price you would pay on those television shopping networks.  He&#39;s<br/>
already done his biology, integrated science and physical science.  He&#39;s<br/>
decided that he wants to start reading autobiographies and biographies this<br/>
year.  His choice!<br/>
<br/>
Now, all this may sound like classes one would take in school, maybe not<br/>
public school, more like private schools.  The big difference is that the<br/>
kidlets have made this choice and all I&#39;ve done is provide the money and<br/>
computers.  Of course, if they have questions I am there but they OWN their<br/>
own future!  Consequently they, themselves, want to learn, they want the<br/>
knowledge, they look for new and interesting things to study.  Sometimes<br/>
they haul out their books or projects or kits at 10 o&#39;clock at night and<br/>
sometimes they get up at 6 in the morning.  Sometimes they don&#39;t do a thing<br/>
for days and then they are off and running on a new project that keeps them<br/>
busy from before I get up until after I go to bed.  Their reading skills<br/>
are far beyond those of their ps peers.  Their science knowledge is vast<br/>
instead of narrow.  Their world is the whole world without limits and they<br/>
know it!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
Ah, a chance to pontificate!  <br/>
<br/>
We started homeschooling because my son had some developmental problems that <br/>
made it very difficult for him to survive in a classroom.  Now, the reasons <br/>
we homeschool, and especially unschool, are much different.  <br/>
<br/>
Socialization is a big part of that.  We don&#39;t want our children to spend <br/>
their childhood cooped up in a classroom with one teacher and 30 other <br/>
children, all the same age, wearing the same clothes, talking about the same <br/>
things and having the same experiences.  Instead, our children have the <br/>
benefit of learning to live and thrive in the &quot;real world&quot; from birth, not <br/>
just from age 18.  We take classes, visit museums and places of business, go <br/>
on field trips, read books, have play dates, attend plays and concerts, go to <br/>
the doctor and the grocery store, play sports, organize activities, listen to <br/>
and play music, do art projects, run the family business, learn how to cook, <br/>
sew and take care of the house.  With 7 or more hours of school and another <br/>
couple hours of homework, school kids don&#39;t have much time for the &quot;real <br/>
world&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Another big part of our unschooling experience is knowing that we are not <br/>
squelching, but rather enhancing and fostering our children&#39;s love of <br/>
learning.  We believe that all children from birth have a practically <br/>
insatiable thirst for learning and knowledge.  Unfortunately, school saps <br/>
most of that thirst from the first day we enter kindergarten.  When we&#39;re in <br/>
school we&#39;re not allowed to work on projects that we&#39;re interested in.  When <br/>
we are interested in a project or a subject, we&#39;re forced to put it away at <br/>
the end of a set time period.  We spend many hours a day on make-work <br/>
projects, worksheets and homework to reinforce concepts that we have long <br/>
since learned or grown bored with.  We spend much time on administrative <br/>
tasks necessary to keep 30 kids in line.  We spend much time on classes and <br/>
activities that have no relation to the world outside the classroom.<br/>
<br/>
But aren&#39;t there just some things that everybody needs to know?  I don&#39;t <br/>
believe so.  The body of knowledge is so vast and is changing so rapidly, <br/>
that it is now virtually impossible for a traditional school to teach a child <br/>
what he or she will need to make a living and be a productive adult.  <br/>
<br/>
Look at computers.  How many of us work in the field of computers?  How many <br/>
of us learned about computers when we were in school?  Not many, I&#39;ll bet.  <br/>
Where and when did we learn what we need to know to make a living?  Maybe <br/>
college, but probably long after we were even in college.  And how rapidly is <br/>
the field of computers changing?  And if you did learn marketable skills in <br/>
college, are you still using those skills, or have you changed jobs or <br/>
careers?  How much of what you learned in school actually benefits you now?  <br/>
What will the world look like when your child finishes school in 10 or 15 <br/>
years?<br/>
<br/>
My point is that in order to get along in the world, what we know isn&#39;t <br/>
really very important.  It is more important that we are motivated to learn <br/>
and have the skills to gain the knowledge that we will need at any point in <br/>
our lives.  School does very little toward teaching us to love knowledge and <br/>
learning.  School is still designed to give us facts, facts that will be <br/>
useless to us in 10 or 15 years.  Worse still, school squelches our love of <br/>
learning.  <br/>
<br/>
We believe that homeschooling, and unschooling in particular, fosters a love <br/>
of learning.  We spend much time discerning what it is that we need or want <br/>
to know, then learning how to find it.  What better preparation can there be? <br/>
 A 15 minute lecture in the library on how to use the card catalogue?  A 30 <br/>
minute lecture in how to organize a term paper?  No, we get our hands dirty.  <br/>
We learn how to work with the librarian, how to experiment with the catalogue <br/>
computer.  We learn how to ask questions -- by doing it!  We don&#39;t write term <br/>
papers.  We read everything we can get our hands on about a subject.  We <br/>
don&#39;t take tests because there&#39;s no one to answer to but ourselves.  <br/>
<br/>
As unschoolers we&#39;ll learn what we need to learn when we need to.  As my <br/>
children grow, I have confidence that they will learn to read, but even more <br/>
confidence that they will continue to love books, because they will not be <br/>
worried about whether someone is going to test them on what they know.  I <br/>
have confidence that they will learn to manipulate numbers, but even more <br/>
confidence that they will not be afraid of math, because they will not be <br/>
worried about whether they&#39;re going to pass an algebra class.  Instead, <br/>
they&#39;ll be thinking about how to apply what they&#39;ve learned to that robotics <br/>
problem.  And, if they don&#39;t learn math?  It will be because they never <br/>
really needed it after all.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve come such a long way in our thinking over the past few years about <br/>
homeschooling in general and unschooling in particular.  And a big part of <br/>
our evolution included many opportunities to talk to people who&#39;ve been <br/>
through it.  Books and e-mail messages are great, but one-to-one contact I <br/>
think is vital.  I&#39;d like to invite anybody who&#39;d like to talk about this to <br/>
contact me.  As you can see, I do love to go on and on.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766164713">Hi Betsy,<br/>
<br/>
Can I add a thought to your P.S.&#39;s from my dh&#39;s personal experience?  He (and <br/>
I) had good experiences in school.  We don&#39;t have much to complain about.  So <br/>
how did we get to this place called unschooling?  First of all, we both <br/>
recognize how rare our experience was.  Good schools, good teachers, good <br/>
people.  <br/>
<br/>
But, even today, my husband is grappling with how he wants to spend his <br/>
working life.  He&#39;s not happy doing what he&#39;s doing, and he&#39;s having a hard <br/>
time deciding what it is that he really want to do.  He does blame school for <br/>
that.  He says he spent so much time on busy work that he never had an <br/>
opportunity to discover and develop his true talents and interests.  So now, <br/>
at 39, he&#39;s having to start over again and at the same time earn a living.  <br/>
He doesn&#39;t want that for his children.  Let them learn now what they love and <br/>
go with it.  So what if what they love changes?  They&#39;ll know how to pursue <br/>
their interests and they&#39;ll have the confidence to do it, too.<br/>

Hi, Carron --<br/>
<br/>
My husband is 43 and experiencing the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
I recently concluded that the advice that we hear that kids need to learn to <br/>
endure a whole school year with a bad teacher (to learn coping skills) is <br/>
very harmful.  When you have an icky job, that &quot;school year&quot; never ends.  <br/>
Passive endurance of a rotten situation is not really great preparation for <br/>
life as a grown-up.  The affects of all this forced schooling linger, and <br/>
some of us feel trapped, even when we have choices.<br/>

You know what amazes me is the response I get from people when I ask them WHY <br/>
public school is a good thing.  Try it sometime.  Just keep asking why and <br/>
encouraging them...(dare I say &quot;the victim&quot;? heheheh)...encouraging them to <br/>
answer more and more why.  They&#39;ll be stumped and eventually have to fall <br/>
back on the old standby of something like &#39;because it&#39;s the way it&#39;s done&#39; or <br/>
&#39;because everyone is doing it&#39;.  If you can get them that far they just may <br/>
realize how stupid that reasoning is.<br/>

I was wondering if you had misunderstood something about the book already<br/>
being out. I guess it made the joke a little harder to see since<br/>
&quot;unpublished&quot; is a real word.<br/>
<br/>
I was at a conference once were a man was looking over the books we offered.<br/>
He seemed to notice &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; and &quot;Unjobbing&quot; because he<br/>
turned to his wife and said &quot;Unschooling and unjobbing -  seems like next<br/>
will be unemployment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m not Dawn, but I can sure tell you how to get the book. We carry<br/>
it at FUN Books (http://www.FUN-Books.com) You can order it online at<br/>
http://www.icatmall.com/FUNBooks and also read a review.<br/>
<br/>
As I recall, you are in the UK, so be advised that although it is a<br/>
paperback, it is also about 3 pounds. Airmail postage to England is<br/>
expensive, but surface mail is pretty reasonable.<br/>
