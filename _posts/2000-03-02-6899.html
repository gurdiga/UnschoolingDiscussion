<div id="ygrps-yiv-184635725">hi,<br/>
<br/>
there is something else i want to say about &#39;adhd&#39; .  i don&#39;t know if this<br/>
will apply to you or even make sense.  i&#39;ve experienced, when stress is<br/>
really high or &#39;vibes&#39; are really strong, that rene&#39; gets pretty &#39;crazy.<br/>
for example right after christmas we went to a breeder to get a puppy.<br/>
when we were there rene&#39;s behavior progressively got worse.  he got so bad<br/>
that by the time we were leaving he was having a full blow fit and crying,<br/>
literally, like an inconsolable infant (this is very uncommon for him, he&#39;s<br/>
just not big on crying even when injured).<br/>
<br/>
he was screaming he didn&#39;t want the dog - it was really awful and if i<br/>
weren&#39;t beyond embarrassment:) i would have been.  the really weird thing<br/>
was that 5 mins down the road he was so calm and said he was so happy we<br/>
got the dog and acted like nothing happened.  later we found out that the<br/>
breeder was really crazy, just a very unstable and impossible person.  i<br/>
think rene&#39; got really overwhelmed just being around someone like that that<br/>
he had to get rid of the &#39;psychic goo&#39; in the best way he knew how.<br/>
<br/>
so what i think is that perhaps some kids just need to act in a way that<br/>
can be viewed as &#39;adhd&#39; when what they are really doing is processing<br/>
emotions that are just plain overwhelming.  so instead of letting these<br/>
emotion overtake them they just sort of purge them through physical means -<br/>
kind of a self-preservation mechanism.  i have no idea if this is true.<br/>
it&#39;s just a sort of pattern i&#39;ve noticed and i think it sort of makes<br/>
sense.<br/>

I see this with my Emily so much.  She is 11 and seems to be outgrowing some <br/>
of this, but sometimes social situations are overwhelming for her and she <br/>
loses control.  She is recognizing now that she needs to remove herself from <br/>
the situation for a little while in order to calm down.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-30215732">Have you ever read &quot;Raising YOur Spirited Child&quot; by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka?  <br/>
It is wonderful!  It talks about behaviors very similar to that!  Many <br/>
children are highly sensitive and react in similar ways to what you <br/>
described.  This book describes both of my children.<br/>

&gt;hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;there is something else i want to say about &#39;adhd&#39; .  i don&#39;t know if this<br/>
&gt;will apply to you or even make sense.  i&#39;ve experienced, when stress is<br/>

&gt;for example right after christmas we went to a breeder to get a puppy.<br/>
&gt;when we were there rene&#39;s behavior progressively got worse.  he got so bad<br/>
&gt;that by the time we were leaving he was having a full blow fit and crying,<br/>
&gt;literally, like an inconsolable infant (this is very uncommon for him, he&#39;s<br/>
&gt;just not big on crying even when injured).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;he was screaming he didn&#39;t want the dog - it was really awful and if i<br/>
