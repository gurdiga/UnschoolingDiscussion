Yahoo has changed it&#39;s marketing preferences section and in the <br/>
process set everyone to YES for all options.  If you have noticed a <br/>
lot of spam in the last few days, follow these instruction:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Go to My Groups  ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://my.yahoo.com/">http://my.yahoo.com/</a> ) <br/>
click on Account Info (at the very top of the page)<br/>
verify your password (if it asks)<br/>
your Yahoo ID card comes up. <br/>
Click on &#39;Edit your Marketing Preferences&#39; (middle of the page)<br/>
change all those Yes&#39;s back to to No&#39;s!<br/>
Click Save Changes.<br/>
Click Finished</div>

keep changing it back.  I realized that mine was set to go to my yahoo mail <br/>
address, which they so &quot;kindly&quot; supply and I&#39;ve never used.  If I&#39;m getting <br/>
spam because of it, I&#39;ll never know.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
