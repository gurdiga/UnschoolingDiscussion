<div id="ygrps-yiv-711774024">Hi,<br/>
  I&#39;m new on the list. I have been lurking for about a<br/>
week. I have a 4 year old daughter and a baby due in<br/>
June. I wanted to talk about tv. My daughter seems to<br/>
be watching alot of it lately. I see myself being a<br/>
pretty radical unschooler, but when it comes to tv I<br/>
start getting insecure and wanting to control it. I do<br/>
suggest we do other things like play games, read<br/>
etc.... Now that the weather is getting nicer we can<br/>
be outside more. There is no doubt that she would<br/>
rather be doing something outside. Unless I am willing<br/>
to get rid of the tv, which I don&#39;t think is the<br/>
answer (I have a few shows I am not willing to stop<br/>
watching) . It doesn&#39;&#39;t seem to fit with our family to<br/>
control tv watching when we believe in unschooling in<br/>
every other aspect. I can&#39;t help but think if she<br/>
wasn&#39;t sitting in front of that tv she would be doing<br/>
something else. There is selfish aspect right now to<br/>
because I am 6 1/2 months pregnant and tired. Laying<br/>
on the couch sounds good alot of the time. I would<br/>
like to hear other families experiences with tv<br/>

<br/>
But it wouldn&#39;t necessarily be something better.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s something she&#39;d rather be doing, she&#39;ll do that!  <br/>
<br/>
If I weren&#39;t taking care of my kids and still living with my husband after <br/>
half my life, I&#39;d be doing something else.  But I made a decision to do what <br/>
I&#39;m doing.<br/>
<br/>
If she does something else from lack of choice, she can&#39;t choose that other <br/>
thing freely.<br/>

-=-I guess I want to know that my daughter isn&#39;t the only<br/>

<br/>
Mine do sometimes.  Sometimes not.  <br/>
<br/>
Today Holly has watched Simpsons (rerun), Friends (new), the boys and two <br/>
other teens just watched two hours of wrestling, and Keith watched it in his <br/>
own room (because the boys talk about the Raw Deal card game while they watch <br/>
it, and Keith doesn&#39;t know or care about the game).  Now teen-boy-crowd has <br/>
gone upstairs to play something or other (card game).  Holly is playing with <br/>
Barbies, but will watch Simpsons again at 10:00.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, today, Holly and I got two dozen carnations to try to get twelve <br/>
good ones dyed green.  They&#39;re starting to turn.  She, Kirby and Marty went <br/>
to a Harry Potter tournament for three hours (Kirby won), then Kirby was at <br/>
karate for two hours...<br/>
TV was an option over that other stuff, and is an option now, but it&#39;s off.<br/>
<br/>
Wait...<br/>
<br/>
No, it&#39;s back on.  Kirby is sorting cards and turned on Married With <br/>
Children, which he totally  missed in its earlier incarnation.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s going to visit friends from his Anime club tonight and will probably <br/>
spend the night, so he&#39;s not in on the upstairs game, turns out.  <br/>
<br/>
Early today, Holly watched the remainder of a Mary Tyler Moore DVD so we <br/>
could return it to Netflix.  It was good opportunity for conversation about <br/>
the women&#39;s movement, TV in the 1960s, and changing language.<br/>

  Your child isn&#39;t the only one that watches a lot of tv some days. But watch what she watches and listen to what she says. You will be surprised how much one can learn from &quot;just watching tv.&quot; My kids learn all kinds of things about animals, history, geography, language, sports, and the list goes on. Things I know we haven&#39;t talked to them about and things I thought they wouldn&#39;t be interested in. Maybe they aren&#39;t really but the facts are there anyway. And all from cartoons. Which at their age right now is pretty much all they watch when they do, aside from the animal planet channel. Don&#39;t worry about. She&#39;ll be fine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144789320">I have a 4 year old. Sometimes she watches TV all morning (that&#39;s about<br/>
the only time kid shows are on on our TV - we don&#39;t have cable) and<br/>
sometimes she isn&#39;t interested in it at all. I have a SIL who doesn&#39;t<br/>
allow her kids to watch TV. I haven&#39;t really regulated it. We have<br/>
enough stuff going on in our life and my daughter has a lot of interests<br/>
that pull her away from it often enough - so it doesn&#39;t really bother<br/>
me. It is interesting to compare my SILs children. There is one the same<br/>
age, but her language and vocabulary skills are definitely not as<br/>
developed. I really attribute much of the vocabulary and knowledge of<br/>
animals to the things my daughter has watched on shows like Zaboomafoo.<br/>
He can talk circles around me about animals, that&#39;s for sure!! <br/>
 <br/>
A funny story on that - one night she came into our room because she had<br/>
a nightmare. I asked her to tell me what her dream was about and she<br/>
said there was a blah blah blah (name of some animal I found out later).<br/>
I couldn&#39;t understand what she was talking about because I had never<br/>
heard of this thing (I didn&#39;t even know the word she was using was an<br/>
animal!) Finally dad pulled himself out of his groggy state and told me<br/>
what it was (he had watched the show with her). I have since heard her<br/>
refer to that animal a number of times. I thought it was pretty<br/>
interesting that she would have this dream and I had no clue what she<br/>
was talking about. <br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes kids are too smart for their dear old parents! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-169930087">Hi Kimberley,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list.  My ds is 2 1/2 and he went through a phase where he would watch hours of tv every day.  I feel guilty too because it feels so good to lie on the couch with him and read and I feel like I should be trying to interest him in other stuff.  Lately though, he is watching almost no tv and I found his vocabulary and imagination were really stimulated by that period of tv watching.  I am sure he will go through phases like that often so my best advice is to enjoy it while it lasts because this too shall pass.  I also try to concentrate on the positive that comes out of his tv watching.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112714863">I used to be very restrictive on TV viewing.    I now am seeing the benefits of letting them decide and monitor their own viewing.<br/>
 <br/>
**I can&#39;t help but think if she<br/>
wasn&#39;t sitting in front of that tv she would be doing<br/>
something else. **<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When I would feel this way I would remind myself that I can&#39;t know what she is feeling or what she is always needing.      I know at certain times I need to just sit on the computer and read and write and read and write.    If my dh were to come and say &quot;don&#39;t you think you have been on the computer enough?&quot;,  how would that make me feel?         (Which he used to question it and I&#39;ve said this is my work!  right?  He gets it now!)   Well,  watching TV,  playing, what-ever, is their work.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday my dd, came running to me wanting me to come watch Powerpuff girls,  pre-unschooling days we wouldn&#39;t have even had cable,  but off I went.          She informed me that this was the episode that she had learned about Susan B Anthony!   I was blown away!   And off we went into a discussion about women&#39;s rights.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now if I would have said earlier,  you better be doing X or Y,  she would have missed that experience!  Cool, huh?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So,  yes,  I&#39;m sure there are lots of kids watching TV.  And she&#39;ll be just fine!<br/>

You mentioned weather being a factor but it&#39;s also possible that you<br/>
being tired a lot (understandably) is too.<br/>
It sounds to me like she&#39;s very smart, and found something to do that<br/>
doesn&#39;t require being out in the cold and doesn&#39;t extract too much energy<br/>
from her mom.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to control TV.  She&#39;ll do something else when she wants<br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
My son has learned so much from TV.   He&#39;s learned about good timing for<br/>
joke delivery, (oh, how we suffered!)  different kinds of humor, drama,<br/>
action.  He&#39;s seen the progression of special effects from a paper<br/>
spaceship &quot;flying&quot; on a clearly visible wire to the great scenes in<br/>
Firefly.  (Where is that, by the way?)<br/>
He&#39;s seen the difference between what was scary in 1950 and what is scary<br/>
today (and what&#39;s just disgusting.)   He can see, in one day,  changes in<br/>
clothing styles in the past hundred (or two, or three or five hundred!)<br/>
years.   Changes in language, hair styles, furniture, transportation,<br/>
social norms, political correctness, and I don&#39;t know what else.    And<br/>
all that BEFORE you get to the &quot;educational&quot; channels. <br/>
<br/>
When he was five and watching repeats of the original Star Trek and The<br/>
Next Generation he noticed and talked about how in the first series they<br/>
just plain killed any alien they didn&#39;t understand and in Next Generation<br/>
the found a way to live peacefully with &quot;crystalline entities&quot; and such. <br/>
 That same five year old also learned and discovered he got a little<br/>
annoyed with the constant moral preaching of said shows. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He knows as much about Japan&#39;s Constitution today as he does our own,<br/>
just by watching Godzilla movies.<br/>
<br/>
You have one smart kid there who clearly knows the value of television!<br/>

<br/>
The new DVD of Amadeus is great, and I watched it on and off for a whole day <br/>
(not wanting the end) and watched the making-of commentary, and then Keith <br/>
wanted to watch it with me.  They&#39;ve added half an hour, and it took two <br/>
evenings.  <br/>
<br/>
None of the kids could be said to have watched it with us, but all of them <br/>
came through a few times and stood and watched.  By references to Marie <br/>
Antoinette they had an idea of when it was.  Marie Antoinette is a staple in <br/>
cartoon humor, and they know by costumes that it&#39;s 18th century (or at least <br/>
would know it was American-Revolutionish days, and could figure the century <br/>
in a few seconds if pressed to do so).<br/>
<br/>
The guy who played the Emperor of Germany was the same one who played the <br/>
principal in Ferris Beuhler&#39;s Day Off, which came through here again last <br/>
month (DVD rental), so that was worth commentary from the kids.  The opera <br/>
scenes were wonderful.  The street scenes, coaches, foods...<br/>
<br/>
Then I dug up the Disney Sing-Along where Tom Hulce, who played Amadeus, sang <br/>
&quot;Out There,&quot; for the Hunchback of Notre Dame who had his voice.  And the <br/>
performance of that song, the the same voice we just heard as Mozart, was a <br/>
good cherry on the top of that movie.<br/>
<br/>
But we didn&#39;t make kids watch it.  They saw as much as they wanted, but they <br/>
saw enough to learn at least a dozen little things, to connect information, <br/>
visuals, clues to other bits of information they have about theatre, <br/>
classical music, personal interactions, Catholicism, wigs, finances in the <br/>
1700s... and that&#39;s pretty good for a block of time when my husband and I <br/>
were &quot;just&quot; sitting in front of the TV telling the kids to get the phone or <br/>
answer the door because we were watching a movie.<br/>

However, we watch a ton of it and when we were talking about what to give up for lent this year my ten year old said, &quot;Let&#39;s try the TV&quot; My dh and I thought what a smart girl she was and how great this would be for our family and I have to say we have never spent so much goofy time together. We have burned through some great books, taken some nice walks and I have noticed personally that I am sooo much more relaxed not knowing if we are currently invading Iraq (although I do listen to NPR quite frequently still:) Just a little food for thought!

You mentioned weather being a factor but it&#39;s also possible that you<br/>
being tired a lot (understandably) is too.<br/>
It sounds to me like she&#39;s very smart, and found something to do that<br/>
doesn&#39;t require being out in the cold and doesn&#39;t extract too much energy<br/>
from her mom.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to control TV.  She&#39;ll do something else when she wants<br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
My son has learned so much from TV.   He&#39;s learned about good timing for<br/>
joke delivery, (oh, how we suffered!)  different kinds of humor, drama,<br/>
action.  He&#39;s seen the progression of special effects from a paper<br/>
spaceship &quot;flying&quot; on a clearly visible wire to the great scenes in<br/>
Firefly.  (Where is that, by the way?)<br/>
He&#39;s seen the difference between what was scary in 1950 and what is scary<br/>
today (and what&#39;s just disgusting.)   He can see, in one day,  changes in<br/>
clothing styles in the past hundred (or two, or three or five hundred!)<br/>
years.   Changes in language, hair styles, furniture, transportation,<br/>
social norms, political correctness, and I don&#39;t know what else.    And<br/>
all that BEFORE you get to the &quot;educational&quot; channels. <br/>
<br/>
When he was five and watching repeats of the original Star Trek and The<br/>
Next Generation he noticed and talked about how in the first series they<br/>
just plain killed any alien they didn&#39;t understand and in Next Generation<br/>
the found a way to live peacefully with &quot;crystalline entities&quot; and such. <br/>
That same five year old also learned and discovered he got a little<br/>
annoyed with the constant moral preaching of said shows. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He knows as much about Japan&#39;s Constitution today as he does our own,<br/>
just by watching Godzilla movies.<br/>
<br/>
You have one smart kid there who clearly knows the value of television!<br/>

I used to be very restrictive on TV viewing.    I now am seeing the benefits of letting them decide and monitor their own viewing.<br/>
<br/>
**I can&#39;t help but think if she<br/>
wasn&#39;t sitting in front of that tv she would be doing<br/>
something else. **<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I would feel this way I would remind myself that I can&#39;t know what she is feeling or what she is always needing.      I know at certain times I need to just sit on the computer and read and write and read and write.    If my dh were to come and say &quot;don&#39;t you think you have been on the computer enough?&quot;,  how would that make me feel?         (Which he used to question it and I&#39;ve said this is my work!  right?  He gets it now!)   Well,  watching TV,  playing, what-ever, is their work.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday my dd, came running to me wanting me to come watch Powerpuff girls,  pre-unschooling days we wouldn&#39;t have even had cable,  but off I went.          She informed me that this was the episode that she had learned about Susan B Anthony!   I was blown away!   And off we went into a discussion about women&#39;s rights.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now if I would have said earlier,  you better be doing X or Y,  she would have missed that experience!  Cool, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So,  yes,  I&#39;m sure there are lots of kids watching TV.  And she&#39;ll be just fine!<br/>

I really have a hard time with violence and fighting.    Right now my son&#39;s favorite PS2 game and TV show is DragonballZ.    They fight and they fight and they fight some more.     I sit with him and try to see the interesting part to it.   Why he would enjoy it,     I&#39;m going to talk with him more about it.    Ask him to tell me more about it.  I&#39;m really trying to share this with him.        He&#39;s also said that the show is funny.    Which I have a hard time seeing.                   <br/>
 <br/>
I do see that he enjoys it when I watch him play or when I watch the show with him.   Maybe this will just bring some connection or bonding time to us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807605244">You said that you can&#39;t help thinking that you would<br/>
be doing more if you just got rid of the TV, but you<br/>
can&#39;t bring yourself to do it. All I can say to that<br/>
is DO! My parents chose when we were really young that<br/>
we were not going to have television in our house. My<br/>
life has been so much fuller becuase of that one small<br/>
choice. I do not deny that T.V. can be very<br/>
educational, but I have the same complaint with T.V.<br/>
as I do with public edu. It is too passive. Hours are<br/>
lost sitting on the couch in a trance. Instead you and<br/>
your children could be reading together, having<br/>
afternoon teas, sewing blankets, dancing outside,<br/>
biking to town, or just learning about each other.<br/>
With the help of the internet and NPR, none of the<br/>
positive aspects of television need to be lost. In<br/>
fact, in my opinion, the best possible set-up is not<br/>
to eliminate the T.V. completely - still have a VCR<br/>
and watch movies occasionally, but just eliminate the<br/>
television aspect. Think how much time you waste just<br/>
watching commercials for things you don&#39;t need! Life<br/>
is meant for living, not watching other people live.<br/>
Once your T.V. is gone, I promise you will not miss it<br/>
at all. Best of luck1<br/>

to insinuate that not restricting TV means that is ALL children will do.    <br/>

&lt;&lt; I have the same complaint with T.V.<br/>
as I do with public edu. It is too passive. Hours are<br/>
lost sitting on the couch in a trance. Instead you and<br/>
your children could be reading together, having<br/>
afternoon teas, sewing blankets, dancing outside,<br/>
biking to town, or just learning about each other. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
With homeschooing you can do all those things and have TV too.  Once school, <br/>
school prep and homework are out of the picture, there are a lot of hours in <br/>
a week.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids have never been involved in public education, so I don&#39;t know how <br/>
passively they might have accepted it, but I can tell you without the least <br/>
hesitation that they are not and have never been passive viewers of ANYTHING. <br/>
 They sing.  They comment.  They recite.  They look things up.  They get <br/>
other movies referred to.  They learn the games they see people playing.    <br/>
They memorize comedic dialogs and recite them back and forth at the perfect <br/>
moment for them to frame an incident a hundred miles and a year away.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;With the help of the internet and NPR, none of the<br/>
positive aspects of television need to be lost.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t follow at all for me.  <br/>
<br/>
And if you haven&#39;t had television, how can you feel qualified to speak to <br/>
what could be had or lost?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Think how much time you waste just<br/>
watching commercials for things you don&#39;t need! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
None?  My kids are usually doing something else at the same time they&#39;re <br/>
watching TV anyway, or they&#39;re up and about, or they have company.<br/>
<br/>
Last night was the night Marty has people over to watch wrestling with him <br/>
for two hours, and then they play Raw Deal, a collectible card game based on <br/>
the crazed soap opera of pro wrestling.  The game is really involved, as any <br/>
such games are, but when they&#39;re watching, they&#39;re doing as much commentary <br/>
and tying-in as the announcers are.  They&#39;re really funny to hear, and <br/>
there&#39;s not a moment they&#39;re not actively engaged with each other <br/>
conversationally, and the humor and thought are really at a pretty high le<br/>
vel.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly was disappointed that the Simpsons wasn&#39;t on last night because of news <br/>
specials, but she watched Third Rock from the Sun while stringing beads for <br/>
something involving (I think)  her My Little Pony collection.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby didn&#39;t see any TV all day.  He went with Holly to a Harry Potter <br/>
tournament, then two hours of karate, then had two friends over to help him <br/>
reorganize his closet (three hour job) and then went with them to play video <br/>
games and spend the night elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Of these visiting friends, one is between the ages of Kirby and Marty, and <br/>
the others are 20 and older.  Our house is a good place to be.  Both parents <br/>
are home, there&#39;s food, there are tables and chairs galore, and my kids <br/>
attract people goodhearted enough to help them clean their rooms.  <br/>
<br/>
Not many families have as busy and rich a life as ours does.  I spent <br/>
one-on-one time with all my kids yesterday--Kirby on the drive to karate, <br/>
with him giving me the update on his girlfriend, the schedule at work, me <br/>
reminding him driver&#39;s ed starts at 8:45 Saturday morning and does he want a <br/>
new notebook or would some old one of mine be fine.  Mine, he said, or he <br/>
still thinks he has his.  His one notebook he&#39;s had for five years. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Today he works at 2:00 but the friends who took him home are taking him to <br/>
work.  He&#39;ll be on time, too.<br/>
<br/>
Through all this, the TV is on when the kids want it on, and off when they <br/>
don&#39;t.  We have movies, DVDs, and last night when I went to the video store <br/>
to return Dennis the Menace and My Big Fat Greek Wedding, I asked them all if <br/>
they wanted anything.  They said no.  I brought back About a Boy and Sweet <br/>
Home Alabama.  I don&#39;t know who will watch them besides me.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter.<br/>
<br/>
We have such a rich store and flow of input, so many people and activities, <br/>
that their choice is NEVER &quot;tv or life.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Well there you go.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard anyone say they had to get rid of the microwave or<br/>
they&#39;d just stay home heating and reheating foods all day.   Or, they had<br/>
to toss out the toity because folks were pooping to much.  Or, &quot;Bob, will<br/>
just frappe the day away and never do anything if I allowed a blender in<br/>
the house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Good grief.   Watch it if you want, don&#39;t if you don&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
If TV is the only thing that&#39;s interesting in a child&#39;s life, getting rid<br/>
of the TV won&#39;t give them, suddenly, without the help of parents, some<br/>
great opportunity to go do things.   And if those opportunities exist in<br/>
the first place TV won&#39;t be the only interesting thing in a kid&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
And, you know, let&#39;s face it, the world is going to keep right on<br/>
spinning if my child watches twenty hours of TV per week, or two.  He<br/>
watches what he wants, and it&#39;s NEVER on all the time because he loves<br/>
going for walks and hikes and playing out in the sun or rain and digging<br/>
in the garden and countless other things that kids will do in their happy<br/>
lives.    <br/>

I&#39;m talking to everyone who won&#39;t listen.   Probably not many parents who<br/>
believe TV is a drug or some form of government mind control will give<br/>
their kids freedom to watch or not watch.<br/>
But the assumption of freedom to choose may be the norm someday.  At<br/>
least on an unschooling list.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

Perhaps I should put a TV in the bathroom.  Right now we have only comics <br/>
taped inside the door, printed out internet pages, and some books and charts. <br/>
 A color wheel.   The only reason they&#39;re not watching TV in there is that <br/>
it&#39;s not an option.  <br/>

Well...  Holly takes long, long baths so for her it would make sense, for <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
And Marty takes long, long... reading breaks.  So if he could pause his movie <br/>
after ten or fifteen minutes each day, in just a week or so he could watch a <br/>
whole movie. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps there could be medicinal videos.  OOOH!  In the bathrooms near <br/>
medical labs, a video of Niagra falls so it would be easier to pee !!  YES!! <br/>
And for home use, if someone&#39;s constipated have a video that&#39;s all the <br/>
scariest shocker-moments of movies.   For kids who aren&#39;t wiping well, get <br/>
that Bill Murray movie about the germs.  &quot;Scared Clean?&quot;  Osmosis Jones!  <br/>

<br/>
Is it possible that part (or all) of the reason she enjoys long long baths is <br/>
because of the peace, or quietness, or playing with toys, or whatever, that <br/>
it brings? Since she can already watch TV whenever she wants, wouldn&#39;t she be <br/>
doing that instead of a long long bath if she so desired? Or is it possible <br/>
she really wants a TV in there and she&#39;s just never asked?  <br/>
<br/>

Lots of people have a problem peeing for the doctor.  Especially kids who <br/>
haven&#39;t done it before.<br/>

Yes.<br/>
Mostly the water.<br/>

Sure.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Or is it possible <br/>
she really wants a TV in there and she&#39;s just never asked?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I doubt it.  Her TV&#39;s small enough to put on the bathroom counter, and she&#39;s <br/>
never mentioned it.  She does sometimes have a CD player in there.<br/>
