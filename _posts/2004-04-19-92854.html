<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501000065">Hello all - I have enjoyed the recent discussion on violence.  I am still <br/>
laughing about the foam penis comment.  I do have a question that has been <br/>
sifting around in my head for the past few days and I thought asking here <br/>
may provide some good advice.<br/>
<br/>
I have really relaxed with the whole &quot;violent&quot; toys thing.  The deal is that <br/>
my sister and another friend of mine are really against their sons playing <br/>
any sort of violent play.  Our sons are all almost five years old.  I can <br/>
understand that when we go to their house that we should respect their <br/>
mother&#39;s wishes; however, when they come to my house their children are <br/>
still very closely monitored.  For example, my friend&#39;s son was playing with <br/>
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and he was making them punch each other.  The <br/>
mother was just so uncomfortable with this that she told her son to go find <br/>
another set of toys to play with (Star Wars was acceptable...???).<br/>
<br/>
With my sister, our boys like to wrestle.  She watches over them and then is <br/>
constantly telling her son, &quot;Now if you want him to stop, you tell him!&quot;  <br/>
That kind of thing.  Pretty soon her son is just watching for her reaction <br/>
and telling my son to &quot;stop&quot; even though I am 99% sure he wouldn&#39;t be if she <br/>
weren&#39;t hawking over him.<br/>
<br/>
All this just makes me feel uncomfortable.  What do I tell my children to do <br/>
when normally that type of play is accepted in our house?  It is our house, <br/>
but at the same time when I invite my vegetarian friends over I am not going <br/>
to serve meat, either.  The last time I simply told my son that &quot;that type <br/>
of play makes (my sister) feel uncomfortable&quot; in front of her, and that they <br/>
just couldn&#39;t  wrestle/sword fight/etc.  Should I put away all of the <br/>
&quot;violent&quot; toys?  It just seems so fake and forced - it is our house and I <br/>
don&#39;t feel that I should have to change its contents to please other people.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, with my friends who do not monitor everything their children <br/>
do, nobody ever seems to get hurt and they all get along fine.  I have also <br/>
noticed that my son seems to get upset after play with these two particular <br/>
families and ends up acting out - which probably reinforces my <br/>
sister/friend&#39;s concept that me letting my kid&#39;s play with these toys makes <br/>
them act violent.<br/>
<br/>
So frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Erika  :)<br/>
