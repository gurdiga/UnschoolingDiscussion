<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017547888">I have been reading this list for a while.  I don&#39;t know if I am an <br/>
unschooler.  I certainly find myself at home with the ethical and moral <br/>
assumptions of most unschoolers.  Practically speaking, it is clear that my <br/>
own children thrive with self-directed learning.<br/>
<br/>
I hesitate, however, on these issues of parenting.  I would ask questions, <br/>
not about the power struggles of socks and clean rooms, but about the moral <br/>
habits of a child and the parent&#39;s role in that.<br/>
<br/>
My question is illustrated my my experience with one of the few &quot;real&quot; <br/>
unschoolers I have met.  We had become friends with this family, meeting <br/>
about once a week to hang out and play  for about 6 months.  Then we went on <br/>
to agree that the moms would take turns taking a few hours off while all the <br/>
other kids were with the other two moms.  Six weeks into this, it fell apart <br/>
when I returned to find that while the two moms were on the porch, a big 11 <br/>
yr old had gotten angry at the younger kids and my 7 yr old had been curled <br/>
up in the fetal position while this older girl pummeled her with her fists.  <br/>
From all accounts it was very violent.<br/>
<br/>
There were many issues in this for me, mostly that I should have never left <br/>
them in the first place, but for this list I am interested in the other mom&#39;s <br/>
response to her own daughter&#39;s behaviour.  <br/>
<br/>
Evidently, after the moms came in and things settled down, everyone sat in a <br/>
circle and each person went around and vented their feelings.  When she spoke <br/>
to me later the mom apologized that her daughter hit my daughter, but also <br/>
mentioned that benefit of learning not to push buttons that trigger an angry <br/>
response in other people.  It was only later, in talking to my other kids  <br/>
that I realized how violent the scene was.<br/>
<br/>
There was a natural consequence for this 11 yr old girl.  She and her family <br/>
have never been to our house again(something she was really disappointed with <br/>
as we have a great art room).  In the subsequent months, she was sheepish and <br/>
I guess embarassed whenever our paths crossed.  Of course, it is a <br/>
consequence for the whole family as well, since it is just not feasible to <br/>
arrange any play dates for the younger kids as well.<br/>
<br/>
I fault the other mom for not being more responsible and not being closer to <br/>
stop it sooner but that is an aside.<br/>
<br/>
My unschooling question, though, is shouldn&#39;t the parent step in sooner in <br/>
the life of an angry child with contrived consequences, that is &quot;punishment&quot;, <br/>
to save the natural consequences that could follow down the road which are <br/>
more damaging and more permanent.  Of course, this is not to the exclusion of <br/>
thought and dialogue and hopefully relief about the nature of the anger  or <br/>
as an ego-type exercise for the parent with an &quot;I&#39;ll show you!&quot; attitude.  <br/>
Perhaps a contrived consequence could cause a child not to act in a moment of <br/>
anger giving them a few seconds to think rationally before they make mistakes <br/>
with increasing consequences.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me an abdication of parental responsibility to address a harmful <br/>
behaviour by having everyone express their feelings and then let the <br/>
consequences fall as they may.  Where (or where not) is an unschooling <br/>
philosophy in this?  If a child is secure of the good will of a parent isn&#39;t <br/>
is more kind   when a  5 or 6 yr old hits someone else to say, you sit here <br/>
in this chair for this time because you did this which is not allowed, than <br/>
to end up with an 11 yr old making tracks which will be difficult for her to <br/>
erase later on.<br/>
<br/>
I also wondered along similar lines when someone suggested that the child who <br/>
wouldn&#39;t stop at the signs be shown pictures or stories of dead children.  <br/>
That solution struck me as almost cruel compared to something like, I will <br/>
stop at the corners because my mom says it dangerous if I don&#39;t  she won&#39;t <br/>
allow me to have a   bike .   In the context of a healthy relationship with a <br/>
parent, couldn&#39;t that  be ok?  (Granted the tone of that story indicated to <br/>
me some separate issues).   Seems that part of being a parent is to be  a <br/>
shield at least for a few short years that allows children some innocence and <br/>
simplicity and maybe that involves playing a bit of &quot;god&quot; in their life.  I <br/>
am wondering. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your thoughts.  Melissa</div>

<br/>
I think that&#39;s central to your whole issue, not an aside at all.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My unschooling question, though, is shouldn&#39;t the parent step in sooner in <br/>
the life of an angry child with contrived consequences, that is &quot;punishment&quot;, <br/>
to save the natural consequences that could follow down the road which are <br/>
more damaging and more permanent.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
I have some terrible neighbors behind us.  I stood in the yard yesterday and <br/>
yelled at the big fence (we can&#39;t see each other--they have a pool and their <br/>
whole yard is enclosed by a high wood fence)  &quot;STOP IT!!!! Stop yelling!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
The mom was screaming at the kids and the kids were (fearfully, but still) <br/>
yelling back.  They paused and continued.  It was scary.  They&#39;re bigtime <br/>
whackers, and I didn&#39;t want to hear it get to that so I yelled again, &quot;DON&#39;T <br/>
YELL!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Quiet.<br/>
<br/>
Mom yells back:  &quot;Why shouldn&#39;t we yell?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Be nice to them!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well within five minutes she was yelling at one of the older boys (10?) who <br/>
was picking on a younger boy, who&#39;s five or six.   She was telling him to <br/>
leave him alone.  The little boy was crying.  The older one said &quot;Leave us <br/>
alone.  Why don&#39;t you let us fight our own battles?&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
He was obviously quoting someone there.  I&#39;m guessing the dad has said &quot;Let <br/>
them fight their own battles.  <br/>
<br/>
The loser in all of that was the littler boy.<br/>
<br/>
I wish they weren&#39;t the soundtrack for our back yard so much.  My kids are <br/>
shocked by it.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids have a TON of freedom, but they don&#39;t have the freedom to be mean or <br/>
to use humor that hurts other people.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Perhaps a contrived consequence could cause a child not to act in a moment <br/>
of <br/>
anger ...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a contrived consequence for a parent to say &quot;Stop it,&quot; and then talk <br/>
to the child about WHY what they were doing is no good.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It seems to me an abdication of parental responsibility to address a <br/>
harmful <br/>
behaviour by having everyone express their feelings and then let the <br/>
consequences fall as they may. .&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like those kinds of little &quot;airing it&quot; meetings.  They&#39;re contrived <br/>
&quot;kits&quot; for people without real social skills, in my experience, used most <br/>
often by people who are extremely non-confrontational, but in a formal, <br/>
scheduled situation can say one or two things IF the others are constrained <br/>
to follow the formal rules too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; If a child is secure of the good will of a parent isn&#39;t <br/>
is more kind   when a  5 or 6 yr old hits someone else to say, you sit here <br/>
in this chair for this time because you did this which is not allowed, than <br/>
to end up with an 11 yr old making tracks which will be difficult for her to <br/>
erase later on.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Those aren&#39;t the only two choices at all.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I will stop at the corners because my mom says it dangerous if I don&#39;t  <br/>
she won&#39;t <br/>
allow me to have a   bike .   In the context of a healthy relationship with a <br/>
parent, couldn&#39;t that  be ok? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the parent can&#39;t think of any way to influence a child outside of <br/>
punishment, the relationship could be healthier.  Those kinds of punishments <br/>
say &quot;I own you and I own all your stuff.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my child hits an other child I don&#39;t know what else to do <br/>
besides punish her. What else could I do? I am a mother of a 3year <br/>
old, and my parents were bad role models. I am trying to raise her <br/>
kinder and gentler than they did. I like how some of you talk about <br/>
parenting, and I want to do better. I don&#39;t want to be mean or impose <br/>
my will on her. I know you wouldn&#39;t agree with some of my parenting, <br/>
but I don&#39;t always like it myself. That is why I am trying to learn a <br/>
better way. Unschooling(to me) isn&#39;t about teaching a child between 6 <br/>
and 18. It is about parenting my child from infancy so the grow up to <br/>
be an intelligent and considerate adult. With out sending my child <br/>
away for 6 hours a day, and with out trying to make her into a little <br/>
me.</div>

&quot;Yes well&quot; is antagonistic and critical, right from the beginning.<br/>

There are 600+ people on this list, most just reading and not posting.<br/>

you would expect your child to learn everything about history from one book.  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are a hundred things to do when a child hits another child.<br/>
It is a false choice to say either the parents sets the child in a chair or <br/>
the child does damage to her own relationships and chances.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is hitting, there are various forms and degrees of<br/>
<br/>
removal<br/>
<br/>
distraction<br/>
<br/>
modelling (act the way you want the kids to act)<br/>
<br/>
picking the child up and comforting her, and find out whether she&#39;s hungry, <br/>
or sleepy, or whether when the mom wasn&#39;t looking the other child was <br/>

<br/>
giving the angry child a chance to express herself to the parent while the <br/>

<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521382149">One thing which had struck me about homeschooled children was how, by and large, they were so nice and well mannered. Now that I have decided to homeschool my kids, I wonder what to do about a little girl 6 1/2 at our homeschooling park day who is mostly just verbally mean to my almost-5yo son. She also seems to be able to rabble-rouse otherwise nice girls to chime in with her when she yells &quot;Go away!&quot; or &quot;I hate that boy!&quot; at the poor kid. Admittedly, he is not particularly adept, socially. He will tend to go near a group of (usually) girls who are playing and he kind of stands there. I think he expects them to say, &quot;Hey, wanna play with us?&quot; I think his standing there tongue-tied sets this little girl off. Now he doesn&#39;t have to do anything and she harangues him. She calls him stupid and other names. Her mom stands by doing nothing which infuriates me. <br/>
<br/>
I have suggested that he play with someone else, or look for one person at a time to play with. I coach him on how to approach kids he wants to play with. I think he finds it a little interesting how this mean girl is, so he tends to stick around for the punishment from her.<br/>
<br/>
I wish her mom would tell her not to be so hurtful. One of the reasons I wanted to avoid the school world for my kids was so that they would avoid this sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a great mindset to begin learning new ways from. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When my child hits an other child I don&#39;t know what else to do<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends on the situation. Conventional parenting practices tend to focus<br/>
on the behavior rather than why, assuming that if the behavior is stopped<br/>
then the problem is solved. That isn&#39;t, of course, true since the emotions<br/>
and situation that caused the behavior haven&#39;t changed.<br/>
<br/>
Every action has a cause.  She may hit because she doesn&#39;t yet know what to<br/>
do with unpleasant emotions. She may hit because she doesn&#39;t have any other<br/>
skills to respond. Punishing her for choosing the wrong technique doesn&#39;t<br/>
give her the right technique. In fact it suggests to her that the proper<br/>
technique when someone is doing something you don&#39;t like is to be bigger and<br/>
stronger and *make* them be the way you want them to be.<br/>
<br/>
If you can give us some specific instances, perhaps we can come up with ways<br/>
that you could handle them. They won&#39;t be formulaic as in applicable to any<br/>
and all instances of the behavior -- the *cause* should guide the response<br/>
not the behavior -- but it might help you get to a new way of viewing your<br/>
daughter&#39;s interactions with the world and what your role is.<br/>
<br/>
It *is* helpful to have people suggest techniques to respond to kid<br/>
situations especially if you don&#39;t have the skills yourself. But the focus<br/>
should always be on *why* a situation is happening.<br/>
<br/>
A book that helped me gain new insight into the child and parent views of<br/>
the world was How To Talk To Kids So Kids Will Listen<br/>
(http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380811960/qid=984825714/sr=1-1/ref=<br/>
sc_b_2/102-3006399-8134511). It doesn&#39;t really go far enough -- it&#39;s still<br/>
at the core about how to get the kids to do what you want them to -- but it<br/>
helped me to see how the standard things that parents say have the opposite<br/>
effect of what we want them to and to start seeing the world from the kids<br/>
side. They give lots of different ways of handling common situations and<br/>
it&#39;s a very easy to read format with cartoons and dialogs and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
Chinaberry Books (http://www.chinaberry.com) has some wonderful parenting<br/>
books (as well as fiction and nonfiction and books on tapes. A *wonderful*<br/>
catalog.)<br/>
<br/>
AnneO (and others) are good at articulating the relationship stuff on the<br/>
Unschooling.com message board.<br/>
<br/>
You might also look into mindful parenting in your libraries online catalog,<br/>
Amazon or through Google.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra just posted a great list of books of which many are mindful<br/>
parenting. If you missed it here it is:<br/>

BOOKS TO HELP UNSCHOOLING PARENTS<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s booklist for 8/18/01 talk on Questioning<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These are some of the books that helped me become the parent I am, with the<br/>
names of chapters listed for inspiration. You can find many books on<br/>
homeschooling nowadays and they&#39;re great, but you might want to read some of<br/>
the philosophy behind some other people&#39;s writings.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t put any John Holt on here, only because I assume all those<br/>
interested in unschooling will have read as much John Holt as they could<br/>
find. So John Holt (Teach your Own, Never too Late, anything else) and:<br/>

through <br/>
the contemporary world of pop culture, dazzling us with epiphanies.He<br/>
provides fresh takes on faith, devotion, grace, being present, beauty,<br/>
practice, selflessness, forgiveness, simplicity. Like the best spiritual<br/>
teachers, Sluyter lets light in from many anglesin this case, the wisdom of<br/>
Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and more. Why the Chicken Crossed the Road is<br/>
a surefire demonstration of why play is an essential ingredient in spiritual<br/>
growth.&quot; --Values and Visions<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Any suggestions? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You could tell her not to be so hurtful.<br/>
<br/>
At some playgroups, kids are out on their own, which WILL create the same <br/>
dynamics as a school playground.  In others, they&#39;re playing nearer the moms, <br/>
or the moms are involved in showing them how to do something (a gymnastic <br/>
thing, a bubble thing, a game, a trick) or the moms are just milling around <br/>
where the kids are.  <br/>
<br/>
I avoid the groups where the moms gather to complain and leave their kids to <br/>
re-create their own same-age culture.  THAT is more why I didn&#39;t want my kids <br/>
in school.  <br/>
<br/>
So maybe you could ask the mom if she has any ideas.  You might find the mom <br/>
as clueless as the child.  Some social things are genetic.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe the child has never, ever had anyone coach *her* as you&#39;ve coached <br/>
your son, and she might respond well.<br/>

<br/>
I like Diane&#39;s plan.  <br/>
<br/>
And another thing is to recognize that there are some kids who just will not <br/>
get along.  Sometimes it helps for time to pass.  Sometimes kids who didn&#39;t <br/>
get along at three will like each other at eight or get married at 22.  But <br/>
some kids grate on each other for life, and parents shouldn&#39;t knock <br/>
themselves out trying to control behavior so that it SEEMS they&#39;re getting <br/>
along.<br/>
<br/>
This is worse with cousins, members of the same small church or club, <br/>
children of parents&#39; best friends, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
There are some people in my life I just can&#39;t get along with, nor they with <br/>
me.  We have lots of mutual friends, they have dozens of other friends on <br/>
their end, and I have on my end.   So it&#39;s not that either of us is objectivel<br/>
y odious and the other is pecking that one away.  It&#39;s that something about <br/>
the other one is just horrible *to me.*  Or in the case of Louie Trujillo, <br/>
five or six of his &quot;best features&quot; were things I could not stand.    He said <br/>
in front of me and four other kids, TO HIS MOTHER, when we were guests in his <br/>
home, &quot;Shut up, bitch.&quot;  I tried to talk him into being nicer to his mom and <br/>
he laughed at me in front of all our friends.   I could write a book about <br/>
how cruel and cold he was.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t wait to get out of high school so I would never have to see Louis <br/>
Trujillo again.   <br/>
<br/>
He married my cousin.  Not just any cousin, the one my parents raised, who is <br/>
eight months older than I am, who shared a room and usually a bed with me for <br/>
almost ten years.    She has five children who look JUST LIKE Louis Trujillo. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Something like that might happen to your kids too. &lt;g&gt;  Be compassionate and <br/>
don&#39;t expect an apology from the kid who is totally and entirely stuck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-874287231"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;When she spoke <br/>
 </span></blockquote> to me later the mom apologized that her daughter hit my daughter, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>an angry <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; response in other people.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;This statement is maddening to me. It&#39;s like the abusive husband who <br/>
says, &quot;Well, if you kept the house cleaner, I wouldn&#39;t get mad and <br/>
hit you.&quot; She may as well have said that it was your daughter&#39;s fault <br/>
that she was hit by the other girl. I&#39;m not sure I would have been <br/>
able to stay civil in the face of that insinuation.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think both ways about it.  Sometimes that&#39;s a dumbass excuse on the part of <br/>
a bully.  But other times, and probably just as many, one child IS being <br/>
irritating from the inability to read the first five or twenty-five &quot;please <br/>
don&#39;t, that bugs me&quot; clues.  Some people can&#39;t even respond appropriately to <br/>
&quot;Please stop, I don&#39;t like that&quot; plain English.<br/>
<br/>
So although it IS lame to say &quot;You need to learn not to be irritating&quot; it can <br/>
also be truly true. <br/>
<br/>
I got mad at Kirby sometimes for hitting Marty when they were younger, and <br/>
found out later that Marty had pushed and pressed and prodded *on purpose* <br/>
WAY past the point most people would have decked him AND tattled, knowing <br/>
that Kirby was pretty patient and that if and when Kirby did hit him that <br/>
Kirby would get in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
So I contributed to that whole dynamic without really knowing it, at first.  <br/>
But it never got to the point that I said &quot;Go ahead, Kirby, let him have it.&quot; <br/>
 I concentrated more on seeing what Marty was lacking and why he was getting <br/>
into Kirby&#39;s space with a goofball show.  And there were real reasons.  Some <br/>
I could help with and some just needed time for Marty to get older.  <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a simple situation.  Buvise Marty to learn how to avoid being a <br/>
world-class irritant would have been way more unfair to both of them in the <br/>
longrun.  I would have been telling Marty his behavior didn&#39;t matter a bit, <br/>
that he  would be defended no matter how wrong he might have been.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not suggesting that anyone else&#39;s kid could possibly be as irritating as <br/>
Marty was to Kirby.  I&#39;m just saying that even if it&#39;s only JUST a little <br/>
bit, it&#39;s worth helping your child see how their own behavior contributed, if <br/>
it did.  And while some kids are great at reading subtle signs of interest or <br/>
avoidance, others are NOT.<br/>
<br/>
I had a phone conversation somewhat against my will with someone just <br/>
yesterday.  I was telling my husband this morning that I just let it go and <br/>
go until she was repeating herself rather than cut her off or say &quot;GEEZ, I <br/>
know all this, and you&#39;re an idiot.&quot;  She even managed to tell me what I <br/>
needed to MAKE Marty do (about submitting an SCA name change form, all <br/>
heraldic business within a club we&#39;re in).  I told &quot;I don&#39;t make Marty do <br/>
much.&quot;  And her &quot;advice&quot; was I make Marty do all the research and footwork to <br/>
get his name changed.    No, we stuck Marty with a registered name when he <br/>
was born, and now that he&#39;s older he wants to choose his own name.  I will do <br/>
the paperwork to get that changed since I&#39;m the one who did the paperwork to <br/>
get him named in the first place.  (He&#39;s going from Jeffery Paul Gunwaldtsson <br/>
to Bardolf Gunwaldtsson, which is a better name anyway. The first one named <br/>
him after two new knights who had been squires/students of my husband and me.)<br/>
<br/>
There are some abused wives who did absolutely nothing wrong, and there are <br/>
others who taunt, and to defend all of them equally without regard for the <br/>
fact that some of them have been abused repeatedly and haven&#39;t even tried to <br/>
see their own part in the relationships isn&#39;t productive when you&#39;re <br/>
counseling the woman herself.<br/>

<br/>
I hope your daughter is willing to pummel if she&#39;s ever physically threatened.<br/>
<br/>
Making blanket statements without regard to other factors is the kind of <br/>
thing that gets kids in abusive situations.<br/>
<br/>
My friend Jerome was told when he became an altar boy:  &quot;Always do what the <br/>
priest tells you to do.&quot;   Turned out to be VERY bad advice.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t talk back to grownups&quot; is another bad rule.  Sometimes the grownup is <br/>
saying &quot;Your mom said I should come and pick you up today.  Let&#39;s go.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
And if a girl hears hitting is never acceptable too much, how will she get <br/>
loose from someone who is physically restraining her?  I would not say <br/>
kneeing a guy in the nuts is never defensible.  But to say &quot;Maybe&quot; is not AT <br/>
ALL to say it&#39;s always just fine.<br/>
<br/>
All or nothing is rarely right.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I almost PIMP when I read this! &lt;g&gt; It must be the name. Our neighbors <br/>
(across the street) last name is Trujillo. I cannot stand the Trujillo <br/>
family. I could make a list numbering in the thousands why I can&#39;t stand <br/>
them. Lets just say it started one early morning soon after they moved in, <br/>
when I went out and found their 12 y.o. daughter wailing away on her 6 y.o. <br/>
brother. He was screaming so loud our very deaf 92 y.o. next door neighbor <br/>
was outside shaking her finger at them. I made the mistake of intervening and <br/>
asking the girl why she felt the need to beat up her little brother. She <br/>
informed me the little S$*% had left his library book inside and she was <br/>
trying to get him to go on to school, because she was not going to unlock the <br/>
door. I told her it would have taken less time to unlock the door for him, <br/>
and they could have already been on their way. Then I told her to open the <br/>
door for him and told him to get his book, wash his face with cool water and <br/>
if he wanted he could go to school with Jack. So off to school he went with <br/>
Jack, his book and a tear stained face, scrubbed not so nicely by his sister. <br/>
(Who went on without him.) About an hour later I answered a knock at my door. <br/>
His mother told me to never interfere with her children again, that the girl <br/>
was in charge when she and their father were at work and if she felt the need <br/>
to discipline her little brother than it wasn&#39;t for me to stop her. AND that <br/>
she didn&#39;t appreciate having to come home to tell me this after receiving a <br/>
phone call from the daughter at school. Now I get glares from the mother, and <br/>
the daughter flips me off. My kids aren&#39;t allowed to play with their kids, <br/>
and the little boy is always calling to my son across the street to see if he <br/>
can come over, when he knows his mom wouldn&#39;t let him if the world was <br/>
ending. Poor thing, he knows it isn&#39;t like it here like it is at his home and <br/>
I can hear in his voice he wants so badly to play in peace. It just makes me <br/>
mad, and sad for him at the same time. :o( <br/>
Its the name, I just know it!<br/>
