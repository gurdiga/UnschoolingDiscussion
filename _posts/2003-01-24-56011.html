<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I had started to require one to load the dishwasher and one to empty.  I did<br/>
&gt; this for maybe a few weeks before I came to this unschooling board.  Then I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t require it of them, and told them why.  So now, they leave dishes all<br/>
&gt; over and don&#39;t put them in the diswasher again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What to do?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, what a lot of dishes.  Could somebody help me load this dishwasher?<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be there to help you in a few minutes, honey.  I can&#39;t stand it when<br/>
the kitchen gets so messy.  Do you want to help me load the dishwasher?  I<br/>
can talk while we work.<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m unloading the dishwasher, Tim.  Want to grab the silverware and race me?<br/>
(When my son was 4, I used to take the sharp knives out of the silverware<br/>
and give the container to him, and we&#39;d race to see if he could unload the<br/>
flatware before I got all the rest of the dishes out.  Warning: this contest<br/>
may cause giggle fits.)<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
Mom thinks: (Hmmm.  Dishes.  Yuck.  Maybe I&#39;ll just put this off for a few<br/>
hours....) =====&gt; my personal favorite!<br/>
