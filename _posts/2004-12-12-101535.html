<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133924036">1. Set some ground rules.<br/>
No hitting, no yelling, no tormenting, or they don&#39;t get to keep playing <br/>
together. <br/>
-------------<br/>
<br/>
That means if someone is tormented, she lives with that AND she doesn&#39;t get <br/>
to keep playing.<br/>
If someone is being hit or yelled at, he endures that AND loses the <br/>
opportunity to play anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve worked a bit on the rules vs. principles collection, and am going to add <br/>
a link to Danielle&#39;s article in Life Learning Magazine (but if someone wants <br/>
to bring that link here that would be great) and also add Ben Lovejoy&#39;s notes <br/>
for his presentation at the Live and Learn conference.    <br/>
<br/>
Rules are easier for the mom but harder for the child, and they don&#39;t help <br/>
provide lifelong skills, except the skills involved in being sneaky and getting <br/>
around rules.<br/>
