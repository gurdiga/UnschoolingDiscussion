<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121487669">&lt;&lt;so why start it up again&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because it has never been resolved.  It was simply told to sit in the corner<br/>
and not offend anyone.<br/>
<br/>
If you are following a child&#39;s lead to meet their needs, how in the world<br/>
can you say that doesn&#39;t work?<br/>
<br/>
And yes, every home has certain rules, often unspoken ones.  People have<br/>
patterns that they use in relating to others and their environment.  I doubt<br/>
anyone on this list has ever advocated an anything goes philosophy.  Nobody<br/>
is going to stand by and smile while the 5yo beats the snot out of the 2yo<br/>
for knocking down the block tower.  The difference is usually the approach<br/>
the parent takes.  One parent might make a &quot;rule&quot; that the 5yo must only<br/>
play with blocks during the 2yo&#39;s nap.  While another parent might talk with<br/>
the 5yo about various possibilities, including sharing some blocks, mom<br/>
spending time with 2yo, playing blocks at another time or in another room<br/>
and let the 5yo decide on how they wanted to handle it.<br/>
<br/>
But I firmly and loudly stand behind Ren on the unschooling issue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-597643388">I will paraphrase Lynda since I still can&#39;t figure how to efficiently cut<br/>
and paste in this email program.  She basically wrote that the list was<br/>
authoritarian and unbending in the past, and now isn&#39;t so it must be a<br/>
better list.<br/>
<br/>
In response, I have to say that I find the list all &quot;newbie&quot; related now.<br/>
Which is fine, but it seems to be functioning on a more &quot;remedial&quot;<br/>
unschooling level than before.  But if we water down the essential oils of<br/>
unschooling to where all is unschooling, we have done no favors to anyone.<br/>

I also have the feeling/impression that this list is less authoritarian <br/>
than before and more accepting of different views.<br/>

Yes, perhaps it is all &quot;newbie&quot; related now, but I don&#39;t see why we <br/>
can&#39;t have this list on multiple levels all at the same time.  We always <br/>
have different threads going, and all those threads can be at different <br/>
levels, can&#39;t they?<br/>

guess) - but what do you mean by &quot;But if we water .......&quot;  I don&#39;t <br/>
understand what you mean.  Can you explain?  Thanks.<br/>

Perhaps that&#39;s a function of who is here and who is posting right now&gt;<br/>
Maybe they finally feel safe to come out of the woodwork and post their<br/>
questions?  Maybe it&#39;s just some rebuilding time?<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think that answering newbie questions *where they&#39;re at* is watering<br/>
it down.  It&#39;s just doling it out in small, digestible, appetizer-sized<br/>
bites, maybe?  Maybe if we all play nice they&#39;ll stick around for the main<br/>
course.  :-)<br/>
