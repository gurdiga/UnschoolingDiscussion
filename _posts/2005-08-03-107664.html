<br/>
At one point or another writing and reading anxieties come up on this <br/>

years old and still not doing any figurative drawing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-266362572">Don&#39;t know if this will help: I recently read the book &quot;Why Gender <br/>
Matters&quot; by Leonard Sax. Very interesting--the author argues that there <br/>
are real sex differences, but they&#39;re not what we tend to think they <br/>
are (that is, not &quot;girls are no good at math&quot; but other things about <br/>
how learning is accomplished and relationships are formed and managed). <br/>
He says that boys do not tend to draw figures as much as girls do, that <br/>
often at ages where girls are drawing little scenes of houses and <br/>
families with flowers and trees and the sky and family dogs (and <br/>
getting praised a lot by teachers for it), boys are often drawing <br/>
things that look like scribbles. But if you ask the boys to tell you <br/>
about their pictures, they will say that they have drawn a depiction of <br/>
some kind of action. For instance, they might say they drew a dune <br/>
buggy going all around, and the scribble, to them, represents the path <br/>
of the dune buggy. After I read that, I realized that my son does this <br/>
all the time! He also draws figures, but a lot of his pictures are just <br/>
complex scribbles, and he will say that he drew a vehicle driving <br/>
around, or a fire burning, or a volcano erupting.<br/>
<br/>
It helped me to become aware of this because I did sometimes have <br/>
thoughts like, &quot;he can draw pictures of things, why is he doing all <br/>
this stuff that is &#39;just&#39; scribbling?&quot; I actually worried at one point <br/>
that he was regressing developmentally because he had done all these <br/>
really accurate pictures of things like helicopters, but then for weeks <br/>
all he was doing was scribbling happily away. But being cued by Sax&#39;s <br/>
book to listen for him to tell me what was going on in his pictures <br/>
made me aware that he has a specific purpose in drawing those <br/>
&quot;scribbles&quot; and they are very satisfying for him.  Now I realize that <br/>
he is getting what HE needs out of the drawing he does.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL my DS is 7 and he&#39;d rather draw schematic looking things than <br/>
dogs and sunshine and flowers. When he was a tot (maybe 3?) he drew <br/>
two rows of squares with lines connecting them one corner to another <br/>
corner. He said it was the electricity wires connecting the houses! <br/>
It&#39;s only recently that he has even gone to multi-colored within a <br/>
drawing (generally he just keeps going with whatever comes to hand). <br/>
And that was mostly because he wanted to draw &quot;battles&quot; <br/>
between &quot;monsters&quot; - I get one color and he gets another and we <br/>
create &#39;robots&#39; and then &#39;zap&#39; each other with rays and <br/>
build &#39;shields&#39; and all. Oh, and now his favorite thing is playing <br/>
with PaintShop Pro (last night he made a yellow spiderweb and a <br/>
black dot for a spider. then he added blue dots, those were the <br/>
spider&#39;s prey, per his explanation, and he draw black lines from the <br/>
original spider location to the prey locations) and with the CAD/CAM <br/>
software that I use for work (I have it on my home computer as well <br/>
so I can work from home sometimes). He loves making spheres and <br/>
cones and such because he can shade them so they look really solid - <br/>
last night he made the solar system - yellow sphere for sun, various <br/>
sizes and colors of spheres for planets, including the unnamed <br/>
possible planet 10 (I found a bit about it in this week&#39;s Time <br/>
magazine and pointed it out to him and we spent a good 30 minutes <br/>
thinking up names for it - I&#39;m leaning toward &#39;George&#39; or &#39;Wow&#39; <br/>
myself lol - I&#39;m thinking some enterprising person should auction <br/>
off naming rights via eBay - the funds to go to subsidizing further <br/>
study of the new planet).<br/>
<br/>
Just as some people don&#39;t read fiction and others love it and some <br/>
read only for information and others read anything they can get <br/>
their hands on, I think it follows that some people will draw <br/>
colorfully and fancifully and others won&#39;t. For that matter, perhaps <br/>
your DS just won&#39;t tolerate anything that looks less than exactly <br/>
like his subject so he just doesn&#39;t go there.</div>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s amazing. He will drop from a 10foot ramp on his skateboard over <br/>
and over and over again because he knows it&#39;s only way to get one step <br/>
closer to being Tony Hawk. But he if he doesn&#39;t write a word correctly <br/>
or draws exactly what he has in mind, he gets immediately frustrated. <br/>
And btw, I&#39;ve really worked hard against correcting him and just <br/>
letting him be (just as I have read many times here). But there&#39;s <br/>
something about speed and the physicality of the activity that allows <br/>
him to err. Does that make sense?<br/>

picture of his dinosaur scene, Aidan, the youngest, drew. He is less <br/>

like to color --we have canvasses and acrylic paints for them and what <br/>

I definitely will read the book and report back. It sounds like a <br/>

jock. I&#39;m the one who is thinking &quot;but at this age *i* used to draw a <br/>
lot&quot;. And I am needlessly comparing him to either girls ( a lot of our <br/>
HS friends are girls) or older boys!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150026525">Oh, I understand. My 4 yr old is a very abstract drawer on the rare <br/>
occasions he does pick up a crayon, paint brush, etc. He didn&#39;t want <br/>
to try making letters until dd got a Magna Doodle. The fact that he <br/>
could erase whatever he wrote immediately let him take a chance and <br/>
try to make shapes and letters. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a big, 4 color one if you think he might like to try it. <br/>

Looks a bit little kid-ish. Maybe a white board and dry erase pens <br/>
would give a similar feeling of non-permanence...<br/>

of DS&#39; drawings are like. I think one probable reason he doesn&#39;t do <br/>
nearly as much drawing as many girls I know (his cousins, etc) is that <br/>
paper and marker (crayon, pen, pencil, paintbrush) just can&#39;t <br/>
adequately show the movement to his satisfaction. I think that&#39;s one <br/>
of the reasons he likes the CAD/CAM software we have - he can click a <br/>
button and rotate it all around and zoom in and out and pan sideways <br/>
and look at it from different angles (front, side, top, etc). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-259004850">Well, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve seen in regards to your worries. <br/>
My younger brother (seven) likes to do most of the things I do (gee,<br/>
what a surprise.), and me loving to draw and spending a large amount<br/>
of time on the computer with my tablet in hand, looking productive has<br/>
apparently gotten to him. I recently started playing a game with him<br/>
(sort of like lazy D&D), and we started to draw &quot;maps&quot; on my<br/>
OpenCanvas program.<br/>
<br/>
Now, he doesn&#39;t like to draw people, and after a few minutes he starts<br/>
getting annoyed and going &quot;Ugh, it doesn&#39;t look right!&quot; but he&#39;ll<br/>
spend HOURS making maps. I honestly think there&#39;s something to do with<br/>
the gender. I&#39;ve noticed that many, many boys want to draw things as<br/>
they see them, and making up people in their mind and putting it<br/>
accurately to paper is super hard. Obviously, that is subject to<br/>
special cases and just general change, but that&#39;s how I tend to look<br/>
at it.<br/>
<br/>
And also, Jonathan tends to pressure himself when he knows he&#39;s unable<br/>
to erase whatever he&#39;s doing, I think that&#39;s one of the reasons he<br/>
likes doing it on the computer.<br/>

paper and two markers or pens. We take turns making mazes for the <br/>
other to find their way through. The ones he makes have the added <br/>
features of &#39;hazards&#39; like flames or electric eye type beams that you <br/>
can&#39;t go through, stuff like that. Makes it interesting because he has <br/>
to explain the whole thing before I start going.<br/>
<br/>
He also loves the map creation part of StarCraft and will play for <br/>
hours on his computer making maps, putting in minerals and vespene gas <br/>
vents and water and land and mountains and things. Then, he and DH <br/>
will play against the computer using those maps. At first, DH would <br/>
check the map out beforehand to make sure it was actually playable (if <br/>
there are no minerals or gas, no one can build any bases or armies and <br/>
the game goes nowhere). Now DS has the hang of it and he just loves <br/>
it. Of course, I shouldn&#39;t be surprised all that much since he&#39;s loved <br/>
maps since he was about 2 and found a National Geographic map of <br/>
Antarctica that came with the magazine issue.<br/>

Honestly, I don&#39;t remember ever drawing anything or<br/>
coloring as a child except as required in school. I<br/>
have not drawn anything in a great many years and<br/>
frankly my drawing ability stinks. Yet I get along in<br/>
the real world quite well.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I start feeling anxious about something that<br/>
my daughter would be doing in school, or when<br/>
well-meaning people ask me &quot;how will she learn xyz?&quot;,<br/>
I try to think of the last time that I needed that<br/>
&quot;xyz&quot;. That trims down the must-know-skills to<br/>
reading, some arithmetic, driving (at least in most of<br/>
US) and a few other things. <br/>
