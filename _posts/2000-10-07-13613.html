&gt;            Forwarded email from Vint Cerf (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:vcerf@...">vcerf@...</a>), September 28,<br/>
&gt;            2000:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;            Al Gore and the Internet<br/>
&gt;            By Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;            Al Gore was the first political leader to recognize the<br/>
importance of<br/>
&gt;            the Internet and to promote and support its development.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;            No one person or even small group of persons exclusively<br/>
&quot;invented&quot;<br/>
&gt;            the Internet. It is the result of many years of ongoing<br/>
collaboration<br/>
&gt;            among people in government and the university community. But as<br/>
&gt;            the two people who designed the basic architecture and the core<br/>
&gt;            protocols that make the Internet work, we would like to<br/>
acknowledge<br/>
&gt;            VP Gore&#39;s contributions as a Congressman, Senator and as Vice<br/>
&gt;            President. No other elected official, to our knowledge, has<br/>
made a<br/>
&gt;            greater contribution over a longer period of time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;            Last year the Vice President made a straightforward statement<br/>
on his<br/>
&gt;            role. He said: &quot;During my service in the United States Congress<br/>
I<br/>
&gt;            took the initiative in creating the Internet.&quot; We don&#39;t think,<br/>
as some<br/>
&gt;            people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he &quot;invented&quot;<br/>
the<br/>
&gt;            Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that<br/>
while<br/>
&gt;            serving as Senator, Gore&#39;s initiatives had a significant and<br/>
&gt;            beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet. The fact of<br/>
the matter<br/>
&gt;            is that Gore was talking about and promoting the Internet long<br/>
&gt;            before most people were listening. We feel it is timely to<br/>
offer our<br/>
&gt;            perspective.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;            As far back as the 1970s Congressman Gore promoted the idea of<br/>
&gt;            high speed telecommunications as an engine for both economic<br/>
&gt;            growth and the improvement of our educational system. He was<br/>
the<br/>
&gt;            first elected official to grasp the potential of computer<br/>
&gt;            communications to have a broader impact than just improving the<br/>
&gt;            conduct of science and scholarship. Though easily forgotten,<br/>
now, at<br/>
&gt;            the time this was an unproven and controversial concept. Our<br/>
work<br/>
&gt;            on the Internet started in 1973 and was based on even earlier<br/>
work<br/>
&gt;            that took place in the mid-late 1960s. But the Internet, as we<br/>
know it<br/>
&gt;            today, was not deployed until 1983. When the Internet was still<br/>
in the<br/>
&gt;            early stages of its deployment, Congressman Gore provided<br/>
&gt;            intellectual leadership by helping create the vision of the<br/>
potential<br/>
&gt;            benefits of high speed computing and communication. As an<br/>
&gt;            example, he sponsored hearings on how advanced technologies<br/>
&gt;            might be put to use in areas like coordinating the response of<br/>
&gt;            government agencies to natural disasters and other crises.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;            As a Senator in the 1980s Gore urged government agencies to<br/>
&gt;            consolidate what at the time were several dozen different and<br/>
&gt;            unconnected networks into an &quot;Interagency Network.&quot; Working in<br/>
a<br/>
&gt;            bi-partisan manner with officials in Ronald Reagan and George<br/>
&gt;            Bush&#39;s administrations, Gore secured the passage of the High<br/>
&gt;            Performance Computing and Communications Act in 1991. This<br/>
&gt;            &quot;Gore Act&quot; supported the National Research and Education<br/>
Network<br/>
&gt;            (NREN) initiative that became one of the major vehicles for the<br/>
&gt;            spread of the Internet beyond the field of computer science.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;            As Vice President Gore promoted building the Internet both up<br/>
and<br/>
&gt;            out, as well as releasing the Internet from the control of the<br/>
&gt;            government agencies that spawned it. He served as the major<br/>
&gt;            administration proponent for continued investment in advanced<br/>
&gt;            computing and networking and private sector initiatives such as<br/>
Net<br/>
&gt;            Day. He was and is a strong proponent of extending access to<br/>
the<br/>
&gt;            network to schools and libraries. Today, approximately 95% of<br/>
our<br/>
&gt;            nation&#39;s schools are on the Internet. Gore provided much-needed<br/>
&gt;            political support for the speedy privatization of the Internet<br/>
when the<br/>
&gt;            time arrived for it to become a commercially-driven operation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;            There are many factors that have contributed to the Internet&#39;s<br/>
rapid<br/>
&gt;            growth since the later 1980s, not the least of which has been<br/>
&gt;            political support for its privatization and continued support<br/>
for<br/>
&gt;            research in advanced networking technology. No one in public<br/>
life<br/>
&gt;            has been more intellectually engaged in helping to create the<br/>
climate<br/>
&gt;            for a thriving Internet than the Vice President. Gore has been<br/>
a clear<br/>
&gt;            champion of this effort, both in the councils of government and<br/>
with<br/>
&gt;            the public at large.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;            The Vice President deserves credit for his early recognition of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt;            value of high speed computing and communication and for his<br/>
&gt;            long-term and consistent articulation of the potential value of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt;            Internet to American citizens and industry and, indeed, to the<br/>
rest of<br/>
&gt;            the world.<br/>

larger scheme of things?  I mean both look at this huge surplus and Bore says<br/>
shore up Social Security and Medicare (so we won&#39;t need new taxes to support<br/>
them later) and Gush says give back taxes now (so we&#39;ll end up fixing the<br/>
problem later).  Neither says spend it on anything really new and big -- like<br/>
high speed rail as they have in Europe or Japan, or &quot;free&quot; universal medical<br/>
care or buy up all the open space in the country to preserve it for future<br/>
generations or restart the supercollider or....<br/>
<br/>
Both of them -- for all their talk -- suggest that this is NOT a pivotal time in<br/>
American history, that the decisions are really NOT that important, that they<br/>
both would be &quot;custodial&quot; Presidents rather than visionaries...<br/>
<br/>
On education, Gush says he wants local control, etc. etc., but talks incessantly<br/>
about standards and accountability (meaning, of course, accountability to whom?<br/>
the funders? the state? the feds) -- Bore wants to spend some bucks so that<br/>
schools can meet standards and be accountable (to the same cast of<br/>
characters)....  In the big picture, these are miniscule differences.<br/>
<br/>
Both are free traders and anti-protectionist (and hence anti-union). Bore gets<br/>
more union money because it has nowhere else to go.<br/>
<br/>
Both would spend much more on defense (I guess they are worried about an<br/>
invasion from Botswana).  Both are opposed to immigration and open borders,<br/>
except when corporations need cheap labor (although both don&#39;t seem to mind that<br/>
corporations send their work abroad.)<br/>
<br/>
One has smoked a lot of marijuana, it is said.  The other has dabbled in<br/>
cocaine, it is said.  Both support the war on drugs.<br/>
<br/>
Both come from &quot;humble&quot; backgrounds -- the millionaire dude ranch in West Texas<br/>
and the little plantation in Tennessee -- and one went to Yarvard and the other<br/>
to Hale.<br/>
<br/>
And they both like red ties!<br/>

I got a chuckle out of your email. I wanted to say that I am in the middle of <br/>
reading your book , it is really interesting how you managed to jump on your <br/>
childrens interests. I say this in &quot;AWE&quot; , because at the moment my daughter <br/>
seems to be a &quot;scatterbrain&quot; in that she picks up an interest and just when I <br/>
think I have the correct info. she changes directions. So I guess I should <br/>
say Im the one who is a little scattered at the moment. LOL. But really I am <br/>
enjoying your story of your girls. Thank You for such detailed info. <br/>
