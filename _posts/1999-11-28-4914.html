Re: Poor Sports: Home-Schooled Kids Shouldn&#39;t Be Playing High-School<br/>
Athletics. <br/>
By Tom Danehy<br/>
<br/>
Dear Mr. Danehy,<br/>
<br/>
Let me make this clear.  I do not home school my children because of<br/>
&quot;racism, paranoia, religious intolerance or combinations thereof&quot;. <br/>
Rather it is for the benefits of a 1:2 teacher to student ratio, the<br/>
privilege of spending large amounts of time with my children, whose<br/>
company I enjoy, and the ability to focus on basic education and<br/>
extracurricular activities, just to name a few.<br/>
<br/>
Believe it or not, my children do play with children who attend school<br/>
and watch TV.  They even watch TV in our home (Gasp!).  They associate<br/>
with Catholics, Mormons, Christians, and Agnostics.  They play with<br/>
cousins whose skin is a different color than their own.  When they are a<br/>
bit older, I will probably read and discuss 1984 with them.  How many<br/>
parents of schooled children do you know who read and discuss a variety<br/>
of literature with their children?  Be honest!<br/>
<br/>
You said &quot;Lord knows those kids don&#39;t present a threat to my kids getting<br/>
a scholarship.&quot;  Are you aware that homeschooled &quot;kids&quot; are receiving<br/>
scholarships at places like Harvard, not to mention numerous state<br/>
colleges?<br/>
<br/>
You seem to be concerned about homeschooled children having an unfair<br/>
advantage in athletic competitions.  If you did even a little research,<br/>
you would find that there are requirements for homeschooling families. <br/>
We do not &quot;get up around 10 A.M., go to the gym for a couple hours, hang<br/>
out for lunch&quot; and then lie about what we do.  I have done and continue<br/>
to do research on education and home schooling.  Before you continue to<br/>
slander a group of people whom you obviously know nothing about, please<br/>
do some research of your own.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mary Ellen Gates<br/>
