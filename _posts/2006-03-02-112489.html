<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056470857">I&#39;d like to thank those who have repeatedly recommended this book: &quot;Parent-Teen Breakthrough: The Relationship Approach, by Mira Kirshenbaum, Charles Foster&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After hearing about it for years, I finally bought a copy, am reading it, and finding it very helpful.<br/>
