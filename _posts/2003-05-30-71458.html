We have days with so many topics/interests covered I can&#39;t keep track.<br/>
The key element is for each topic to be honored by the parent and for the <br/>
parent to be curious and interested!<br/>
<br/>
We were invited to swim at a fellow unschoolers house yesterday. The boys had <br/>
this idea about taking our little wading pool along to see if they could use <br/>
it as a boat.<br/>
I didn&#39;t think it could hold their weight, but they were curious so I loaded <br/>
it up.<br/>
Amazingly enough, it held two children and floated just fine.<br/>
They tried a number of different things with it and it turned out to be a lot <br/>
of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Being open to new (and possibly strange) ideas, no matter how hard it is to <br/>
creatively meet the need, being intensely curious about everything in the whole <br/>
wide world and letting information swirl and flow through your life without <br/>
strangling it with &quot;studies&quot; or contrived projects is the key to happy, <br/>
successful unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
When the parent is still trying to make information into a study, they aren&#39;t <br/>
quite &quot;there&quot; yet. But it can come. And when it does, it&#39;s like a huge <br/>
lightbulb turning on in your head and you never see the world the same again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is such a great way of putting it. I was having my doubts (2nd <br/>
year of deschooling, BTW) and even though I knew I was not willing to <br/>
go the curriculum route (even hated those as a teacher), I just felt <br/>
adrift for a moment there. Remember, I had disconnected from this board <br/>
for about 3-4 months. Gosh, that was definitely too long.<br/>
<br/>
Here in NYC most homeschoolers I know use curricula of one kind or <br/>
another. And some &#39;unschoolers&#39; have demarcated what they call <br/>
&#39;learning&#39; from &#39;entertainment&#39; so play time, PCs and the TV are <br/>
closely regulated. I really have to come here to participate in this <br/>
kind of discussion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is where my husband is right now and I have had to make <br/>
concessions. So my job right now is to make available not just to my <br/>
kids but to him as well activities that can turn his impetus to teach <br/>
into an opportunity for the kids to learn --and not &#39;study&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s as if I&#39;m unschooling my kids AND my husband as well :-)<br/>
<br/>
So thanks to all. Love ya!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That somehow I will fail them.  Not be interested enough or not be <br/>
able to give the right *guidance* (for lack of a better word).  I <br/>
feel like they will present some interest and maybe I won&#39;t catch it, <br/>
won&#39;t follow through to suggest the library or here is a great book <br/>
with related experiements.  So I see I am holding on to the really <br/>
loose, give me a little control, unit studies.  So although they take <br/>
up less then 5% of our total time, they are there.  I am not sure how <br/>
to rid myself of that fear, maybe just time and maybe that <br/>
conference ;)  Looking forward to seeing and talking to everyone in <br/>
person!!<br/>
