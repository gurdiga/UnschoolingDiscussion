<div id="ygrps-yiv-450423464">Does anyone know if there is a way to adjust my screen or the new <br/>
files so that you don&#39;t have to scroll so far to the right to be able <br/>
to read each line?<br/>
<br/>
I would like to read some of the information posted, but it makes my <br/>
eyes go wacko to try to read wide posts like that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I suspect it was a formatting problem that Yahoo can&#39;t handle.<br/>
<br/>
What would work is to copy and paste the contents of each file into a word<br/>
processor. That should wrap the paragraphs properly.<br/>

your word processor and you can read it fine.  <br/>
