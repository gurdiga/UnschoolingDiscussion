This is what I send new unschoolers here in SC. Have fun on this new journey!<br/>

Unschooling Basics<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is trusting the child to learn what he needs to learn when he <br/>
needs to learn it. Unschooling is also sometimes called &quot;natural learning&quot; and <br/>
&quot;child-led learning&quot; . But mostly unschooling is NOT school-at home: we do not <br/>
try to replicate school in our houses. It’s real living in the real world---for <br/>
and with a purpose. You cannot live and not learn---we’re surrounded by real <br/>
opportunities every day to learn. And it’s REAL learning, not simulated as in <br/>
school. Living is learning is unschooling is living is learning is <br/>
unschooling..... <br/>
<br/>
There are several good books on the inanity and insanity of schools and on <br/>
the marvels of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling &quot;patron saint&quot; is John Holt. He was a school reformer in the <br/>
70’s who came to realize that schools are NOT reformable. His most popular <br/>
books are How Children Fail, How Children Learn, Teach Your Own, and Learning All <br/>
the Time.<br/>
<br/>
John Taylor Gatto was a NY city and NY state teacher of the year. He finally <br/>
quit and started on the speaking circuit. He seems completely behind <br/>
unschooling. His two big books are Dumbing Us Down and The Underground History of <br/>
American Education.<br/>
<br/>
Frank Smith has a great little book called The Book of Learning and <br/>
Forgetting that shows how little one learns in and remembers from school. He pushes <br/>
REAL learning---for a purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Alfie Kohn’s Punished by Rewards shows the total inanity of EXtrinsic <br/>
motivation (gold stars, grades, etc.) and the attributes of INtrinsic motivation.<br/>
<br/>
Grace Llewellyn’s The Teenage Liberation Handbook  (How to Quit School and <br/>
Get a REAL Education) is the &quot;bible&quot; for unschoolers. It’s a great read for <br/>
teens, but parents should read it too. Be SURE not to skip the &quot;cute little story&quot; <br/>
at the beginning. Grace also hosts the &quot;Not Back To School Camp&quot; in the early <br/>
fall for teen unschoolers---a place to meet other unschoolers and share <br/>
passions and interests.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Griffith has two books,  The Homeschooling Handbook and The Unschooling <br/>
Handbook. The Homeschooling Handbook has many great ideas for documenting what’<br/>
s being learned; and, since that is a requirement in SC, it’s very helpful. <br/>
But The Unschooling Handbook is THE handbook for new unschoolers. In it she <br/>
gives real life examples and explanations. VERY understandable. Convinced my <br/>
husband that what I was suggesting made sense! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
David Albert has two: And the Skylark Sings with Me and Homeschooling and the <br/>
Voyage of Self-Discovery. Both are witty---and easy reads.<br/>
<br/>
Valerie Fitzenreiter has a brand new book that I have not yet read: The <br/>
Unprocessed Child: Living Without School. It&#39;s about unschooling her daughter, <br/>
Laurie. I&#39;m looking forward to its release.<br/>
<br/>
Websites:<br/>
<br/>
www.unschooling.com is THE website for unschooling. There are others that <br/>
&quot;say&quot; they unschool; these are the radicals who KNOW what they are talking about. <br/>
There are essays and FAQs which you should definitely read first. Afterwards <br/>
go to the message boards and read, read, READ! If you have questions after <br/>
reading for a few weeks, then post---but most things have been explained before, <br/>
so if you read, you’ll run across the answers to most of your questions. The <br/>
posters to pay attention to are Sandra Dodd, Joyce Fetteroll, Pam Sorooshian, <br/>
Anne Ohman, and Mary Gold. There are other wonderful posters, but these are all <br/>
radical unschoolers who all have great ways of expressing themselves and <br/>
getting to the nitty gritty of unschooling. They will all be at the conference in <br/>
August.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling.com also has e-lists if you prefer your messages in mail form, <br/>
but the traffic is HIGH. 200-400/day. Unless you’re hard core, or just prefer <br/>
your lists this way, I’d recommend the message boards.<br/>
<br/>
www.SchoolsOutSupport.org is the SC unschooling support group. Membership is <br/>
free. It has a message board and info about laws and local groups. It hosts <br/>
the unschooling conference in August.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd is a radical unschooler of three children, 16, 14, & 12 (I <br/>
think). She has her own website that is chocked FULL of essays and stories about <br/>
unschooling. It’s a great place to start. www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling   She is <br/>
also the keynote speaker at the August conference.<br/>
<br/>
Ned Vare & Luz Shosie have an <br/>
already-graduated-from-college-always-unschooled son. Their website is full of short essays on unschooling. They have a <br/>
newsletter as well.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://borntoexplore.org/unschool/">http://borntoexplore.org/unschool/</a><br/>
<br/>
Billy and Nancy Greer own FUN-books---a mail-order catalogue for unschoolish <br/>
books and games.www.FUN-Books.com<br/>
<br/>
And the conference: Here’s the flyer:<br/>
<br/>
 School’s Out Support’s Live & Learn Unschooling Conference <br/>
August 22-24 in Columbia, SC at the Holiday Inn-Coliseum. <br/>
    <br/>
This conference is a must attend! Meet other families on the same journey, <br/>
listen to inspiring speakers, and discover the art of unschooling in beautiful <br/>
downtown Columbia, SC. This is a non-age-discriminatory conference: anyone can <br/>
participate in any Funshop or Presentation. Bring the whole family for a <br/>
joy-filled weekend!<br/>
    <br/>
School&#39;s Out Support (SOS) is a volunteer-driven, statewide organization <br/>
whose mission is to support and promote unschooling, provide information, monitor <br/>
and influence legislation, offer opportunities for families to get together, <br/>
and empower families to make the choices that respect the rights, needs and <br/>
aspirations of their children. SOS welcomes anyone with an interest in <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Since its inception in April 2001, SOS has supported families that have made <br/>
the decision to unschool as they face difficult questions and challenges. <br/>
These families may wonder about socialization, the legal issues surrounding <br/>
unschooling, accountability associations, or integration of John Holt&#39;s educational <br/>
philosophy into their everyday lives. Some families may doubt their abilities, <br/>
feel confused and ask themselves, &quot;Can I really do this?&quot;. SOS encourages <br/>
parents to trust themselves and their children to make good decisions and <br/>
empowers them to find the support and information they need. <br/>
<br/>
Our Presenters<br/>
For our Keynote presenter we are very fortunate to have the popular <br/>
contributor to Unschooling.com message boards, its e-list, AlwaysLearning, and regular <br/>
columnist in HEM---unschooling guru, Sandra Dodd. A former middle school <br/>
teacher, Sandra has talked countless families into running away from school and <br/>
jumping into learning for fun. Her motto: &quot;Everything Counts!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re also delighted to have Anne Ohman, from the Unschooling.com message <br/>
boards, back for a return engagement. She &quot;stole the show&quot; last year with her <br/>
debut and is now in demand at conferences all over the country. AnneO&#39;s <br/>
passionate, gentle approach to life and learning continues to inspire families daily.<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian is well known in &quot;all the unschooling <br/>
circles&quot;---Unschooling.com&#39;s message boards, the unschoolingdotcom e-list, AlwaysLearning, NHEN, and <br/>
the California boards. When she&#39;s not teaching college level economics and <br/>
statistics, Pam&#39;s an unschooling mom of three teenagers: she&#39;s &quot;been there, done <br/>
that&quot;---and will surely have a few answers for you!<br/>
<br/>
Mary Gold is better known as &quot;Zenmomma&quot;--and you can find her wherever <br/>
unschooling is a topic! Mary &quot;preaches&quot; peace and trust and joy---and the pure <br/>
delight of unschooling her children. Her encouraging words are music to a stressed <br/>
parent&#39;s ears---and she always leaves you knowing that &quot;Life is good!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jim Weiss&#39; storytelling has captivated and delighted both adults and children <br/>
with his original stories and retellings of classics. To hear him tell a <br/>
story is to be swept into another world. Jim&#39;s award-winning tapes are favorites <br/>
in many homes---including ours!<br/>

You may also all me anytime to ask questions or discuss concerns. I truly <br/>
believe that school is harmful---physically, emotionally, intellectually, and <br/>
spiritually. It’s a bad place to spend a childhood. <br/>
