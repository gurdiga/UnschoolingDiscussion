We don&#39;t do any &quot;planned&quot; study in the traditional concept. However, if one of the girls is really interested in something I will help set up or investigate ways for the girls to find more information or actiivties for that interest. For example, my 11 yr old, Kayleen, was reading the American girl books about Kit. She loved it. From that she became intensly interested in Amelia Earhart, an idol of Kit&#39;s. She wanted to learn more. So we went to our local library site, looked up any books and movies about  Amelia Earhart and requested them. A few days later we picked them up. In the meantime we went on line and also found quite a few web sites devoted to her. Now I love history, well actually learning  just about anything, so I read, watched and learned right along with her. It was great! We talked and compared notes. Now she is interested in Ben Franklin. Not sure where she picked it up from, I will have to ask her. But now we are off again to learn about him. Also if I can find any local museum or other activties that tie in to their current interests, I will plan a field trip. That&#39;s about all the planning we do.<br/>
