<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006129365">Since it&#39;s been quite a while since I joined this list, I&#39;ll <br/>
introduce myself again. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Linda, I live in Oregon with my husband and three children, 7, <br/>
5, and 2, and none of them have ever been to school. I fully believe <br/>
in unschooling theory, and I have been thrilled at how it has opened <br/>
up my own life, made me feel lighter, free-er, just generally less <br/>
stressed out. I am also thrilled to see my kids creating these <br/>
wonderful lives without being held back and harmed by school, or <br/>
school-at-home for that matter. <br/>
<br/>
So far we haven&#39;t had any objections from the family (all friends <br/>
support us, even our dear friend who is a gradeschool teacher!) but <br/>
we do on occasion get the quizzing. I get very grouchy about that <br/>
and am trying to work on a better way of dealing with it.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s probably enough for now. Just so you know who I am when <br/>
I start posting. Oh, one more thing -- I&#39;ve put together a page of <br/>
links to articles on educational issues: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~eaglefalconlark/blueviolet//education/ledu">http://home.earthlink.net/~eaglefalconlark/blueviolet//education/ledu</a><br/>
cation.html (and if you snoop around my site you&#39;ll see I&#39;m very <br/>
passionate about birth issues as well.)<br/>
