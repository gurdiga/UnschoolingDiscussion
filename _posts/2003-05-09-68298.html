<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547074951">I&#39;m so angry!  I unschool my 13 year old son, but my middle son is finishing <br/>
his senior year (or trying to) in public school.  As he says, he rarely goes, <br/>
and when he does, he flunks.  Today he received a letter from the school <br/>
saying he is being given an award for his accomplishments!  We&#39;ve been <br/>
laughing for hours.  We have no clue what it could be for.  All I&#39;ve heard <br/>
from the school lately is Charlie can&#39;t graduate because he missed gym too <br/>
much (he has a medical excuse), he has an incomplete that has now turned to <br/>
an E (which makes no sense, but hs teacher HAD sent a grade down; another <br/>
fuck-up by the *guidance counselor*.  Anyway, my kids and I hate awards, but <br/>
we went to show my parents, knowing this would make their day. (Now they can <br/>
brag about THEIR grandchild like their friends do). Well, they were proud, <br/>
disgustingly so.  They didn&#39;t see the humor in it; honestly, he&#39;s the worst <br/>
student.  We want to frame this letter!  My parents, however, actually think <br/>
he&#39;s going to the ceremony they hold, and hopefully it will be on local cable <br/>
tv!  *gag*  He doen&#39;t go to class, so why would he attend either an awards <br/>
assembly or his graduation.  My 13 year old was told by my parents that at <br/>
least his brother wasn&#39;t a *street urchin* and a *delinquent*.  Needless to <br/>
say, we didn&#39;t stay there long.<br/>
 I need something to punch.<br/>
