&gt;   I am just wondering what significance the phrase at the bottom of this<br/>
&gt;   message has &quot;Get a Taste of Religion:<br/>
&gt;   &gt;~LICK A WITCH~<br/>

&gt;   &gt;Hi all, Jacli here :) I&#39;ve been relatively quiet for quite a while. <br/>
&gt;Going<br/>
&gt;   &gt;through too much physical turmoil to get embroiled on the stuff on the <br/>
&gt;list<br/>
&gt;   &gt;too. But Helen&#39;s message struck me. I didn&#39;t appreciate her method but <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;   &gt;understood her madness.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;The plain fact is that we seem to have cycles on this list. The good, <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;   &gt;bad and oh yes, the ugly.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;We have moments when we shine. When we all come together to help one<br/>
&gt;   &gt;another question and answer our collective approaches to schooling,<br/>
&gt;   &gt;unschooling and parenting in general. These are the moments when we <br/>
&gt;-each<br/>
&gt;   &gt;of us- contribute just a little something, a little bit of our own <br/>
&gt;flavor<br/>
&gt;   &gt;and when taken in create a masterpiece.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;Then we have moments when we get a little thoughtless or insensitive.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;Perhaps too sensitive is what I should say. Moments when for just a New<br/>
&gt;   &gt;York minute we let the bad in and become JUDGEMENTAL.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;That&#39;s okay. This list is full of moms, dads, teachers, leaders and <br/>
&gt;since<br/>
&gt;   &gt;we&#39;re all human on this list, the occasional screw-ups. But we <br/>
&gt;acknowledge,<br/>
&gt;   &gt;apologize and move on. And thank goodness for the occasional screw up. <br/>
&gt;They<br/>
&gt;   &gt;remind us to think before we speak, to consider and reconsider the way <br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt;   &gt;treat or mistreat others, such consideration is probably a big asset <br/>
&gt;for a<br/>
&gt;   &gt;group of folks attempting to guide their young-ins and deschool <br/>
&gt;themselves<br/>
&gt;   &gt;at the same time.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;The problem is when the Ugly sneaks it&#39;s ugly face in. Ahh, the moments<br/>
&gt;   &gt;when we tear down instead of buildup. Then we go back in and do it <br/>
&gt;again.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;The long, long debates on whether so and so said what they said they <br/>
&gt;said<br/>
&gt;   &gt;and so forth. Usually followed by people upset about all the people <br/>
&gt;saying<br/>
&gt;   &gt;what was or was not said and then the comments about how people should <br/>
&gt;go<br/>
&gt;   &gt;and say things somewhere else.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;This is not new for us. But it is shameful. Because when we are good, <br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt;   &gt;are AWESOME! When we shine it is because, as a group we encourage, <br/>
&gt;support<br/>
&gt;   &gt;and unite.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;I do not care for the way Helen responded to the UGLY. But I do think <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;   &gt;came from an emotional place of frustration and disappointment that it <br/>
&gt;had<br/>
&gt;   &gt;come back again. And let&#39;s face it, when folks start telling other <br/>
&gt;folks to<br/>
&gt;   &gt;get on other lists, UGLY has come back in a big way.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;Shame on us. Do you know what I do when the ugly comes? When the first<br/>
&gt;   &gt;whiff of ugly has come I try to ignore it by becoming real friendly <br/>
&gt;with my<br/>
&gt;   &gt;delete button. But at times like this, times when UGLY has come back <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt;   &gt;the way and brought friends, I leave. That&#39;s right. I&#39;ve been off this <br/>
&gt;list<br/>
&gt;   &gt;several times and I&#39;m about to do it again. And that&#39;s okay too. <br/>
&gt;Because<br/>
&gt;   &gt;the true feeling of this list is strong enough to survive even the ugly <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;   &gt;the disappearance of one or two faces. Ugly is like a fire and if we <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt;   &gt;just stop feeding the flames IT WILL GO AWAY.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;Sooner or later The Good will come back and when it does I and the <br/>
&gt;others<br/>
&gt;   &gt;who have already quietly slipped away for a bit will come back. I just <br/>
&gt;hope<br/>
&gt;   &gt;in the meantime that we haven&#39;t already permanently alienated some of <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;   &gt;wonderful people on this list who maybe don&#39;t understand our ups and <br/>
&gt;downs.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;The list will survive, but it could come back and bloom and thrive if <br/>
&gt;only<br/>
&gt;   &gt;we would all work just a little harder to stop feeding the ugly and <br/>
&gt;start<br/>
&gt;   &gt;working The Good.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;Well, just my two cents, bye all, Jacli :)<br/>

&gt;   &gt; &gt;Subject: Checking in/checking out &gt; &gt;Dear friends and listmembers, &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;It&#39;s a major disappointment to see this list fall back into the same<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;kind of downward spiral we experienced a few weeks (or was it <br/>
&gt; &gt;months?)<br/>
&gt;   &gt;ago. &gt;... It was truly discouraging to see the disparaging remarks <br/>
&gt; &gt;about<br/>
&gt;   &gt;our magazine in the middle of this discussion ... &gt; To see our magazine<br/>
&gt;   &gt;called into question &gt;because of what someone who happens to write for <br/>
&gt;us<br/>
&gt;   &gt;does on this list &gt;was probably the final straw for me. &gt;I&#39;ll be blunt. <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;   &gt;do not have the time nor the interest in being &gt;involved with the kinds <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;   &gt;dynamics I&#39;ve read here in the last few &gt;hours.... &gt; For that reason, I <br/>
&gt;am<br/>
&gt;   &gt;removing all &gt;references to HEM from this list, turning this list over <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;   &gt;the &gt;moderators, unsubscribing, and getting on with what needs doing in <br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;life. I wish you all the best in finding appropriate resolutions. &gt;<br/>
