<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662182716">My H/s&#39;d daughter has a friend who goes to school. This friend is <br/>
rather hot headed and tends to get into trouble a lot.  My daughter <br/>
is the opposite.<br/>
Friends mother has said that my daughter is a good influence on <br/>
friend. Friends teacher also said My daughter a good influence.<br/>
<br/>
Friend in trouble again.  Another teacher told friends mother, that <br/>
my daughter is a bad inluence - and - this is what made me so mad - <br/>
My daughter should be in school as she has to much time on her <br/>
hands....<br/>
Who is this women?  My daughter is with me most of the time .  When <br/>
she is not with me i always know where she is.  When did teachers <br/>
become GOD<br/>
It is because of teachers like this, who judge unfairly, that my <br/>
daughter ended up depressed at the begining of the year.  The reason <br/>
she is now unschooling - I should have unschooled her from the start.<br/>
