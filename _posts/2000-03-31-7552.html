<div id="ygrps-yiv-314637650">Sorry about that  Im still kind of shaky on sending these emails. Anyway your <br/>
vacation sounds wonderful. I live in NH, kind of in the country. When we go <br/>
out back at night and theres no moon. The stars look like they are so close , <br/>
they&#39;ll fall on you. Well maybe not that close, but they are pretty bright.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396842989">I understand that feeling. We used to have a cabin in Barnstead NH on Half <br/>
Moon lake and ..... the memories just make me want to cry. A place and a time <br/>
that can never be retrieved!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-873432291">Hi Shannon <br/>
I know what you mean &quot;unschooling moment&quot;. LOL I get them all the time. I <br/>
usually get this flash of insight that I remember about something. Its kind <br/>
of agravating sometimes because Ill only see bits and pieces of what Im <br/>
remembering and then I have to stop and think about it.. Some jerk just IM  <br/>
about an erotic  chat!! That agravates me!! Anyway, Your adventure sounds <br/>
like it was alot of fun!  Where do you live that your so close to a <br/>
reservation? That would be really neat to visit one, I love that stuff. I  <br/>
have always had a fasination with history and stuff, I would love to crawl <br/>
all over that place! I wish I could get my dd into it but so far NO interest. <br/>
oh well I guess Ill have to be  patient, I am having a lesson this month on <br/>
patience!! LOL  I guess its not something that  comes easy to me.  I just <br/>
turned 29 on the 17th  .  So we are about the same age!! Nice to know someone <br/>
my own age.   I just switched my font is it bothering your eyes? I love the <br/>
way it looks but I think I need to change the color . Its freaking my eyes <br/>
out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638470046">Hi Shannon,<br/>
Thats okay if its not an Indian Res. I did think it was . I bet it is <br/>
beautiful.  Thats okay about my font, I thought once I adjusted it in the <br/>
preferences that it would show up all the time. I guess not. Thats okay it <br/>
looks pretty to me.LOL I guess you could call me a sight person. We have alot <br/>
of those Forest preservations too. I think thats a great idea, my sister in <br/>
law owns land that is joined to a conservation. and  you should see the <br/>
sights, it owned by the college on the corner of our street. So they do alot <br/>
of their projects out there and we like to tag along sometimes. They are <br/>
really nice about that. <br/>
