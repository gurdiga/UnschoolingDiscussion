<div id="ygrps-yiv-337393588">I joined this email group because I thought perhaps I could glean some <br/>
knowledge from those who have a more child lead approach to EDUCATION.  My <br/>
email box has been littered with hundreds of emails (most of no value) that <br/>
have assualted my faith and have suggested that I abandon my responsibility <br/>
to &quot;TRAIN UP MY CHILD IN THE WAY HE SHOULD GO SO THAT WHEN HE IS OLD HE WILL <br/>
NOT DEPART FROM IT&quot; (Bible verse)  I am suggesting that all  Christians  run <br/>
from this loop as fast as you can and go spend the time you would have wasted <br/>
sifting thru this garbage can loop to perhaps find a useful philosophicial <br/>
morsel and spend it eating at a buffet of wisdom in the company of the <br/>
CREATOR of the universe.   Its an investment of time with greater rewards  <br/>
And  the serendipity... you won&#39;t over tax your DELETE button.  This loop <br/>
gives unschoolers a bad name.   Now am I referring to the fundamentalist <br/>
unschoolers, southern unschoolers, unschoolers in <br/>
general.?.................hmmmmm  God bless all and I wish you a speedy <br/>
recovery.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-421704559">Sorry if this list isn&#39;t your cup of tea. This last few days it hasn&#39;t been<br/>
most people&#39;s cup of tea I&#39;ll warrant.<br/>
<br/>
But if you&#39;re unsubscribing you need to follow the directions at the bottom<br/>
of each email not send it to the list:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, click on the following link or address an<br/>
&gt; email to:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
