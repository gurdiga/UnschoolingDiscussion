<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329675011">I have been on the list for the recommended couple weeks before posting,<br/>
and have been on this list in the past.  I don�t believe I have ever<br/>
seen this discussed.<br/>
I realize that all children are gifted in various ways.  I have children<br/>
who happen to be gifted in ways that would be considered academic or<br/>
schoolish I guess.  They have always been in school.  We will be<br/>
homeschooling them next year, and I am considering unschooling.  I know<br/>
that it is my responsibility to expose them to things that they are<br/>
interested in, or that I think they might become interested in.  I<br/>
already know many of their interests and passions, since they have<br/>
taught themselves most of what they know anyway; they certainly haven�t<br/>
learned it in school.  <br/>
I wondered if there are any resources or discussion lists specifically<br/>
about unschooling academically �gifted� children, or if there is any<br/>
difference at all.  I want to start preparing now, and gathering<br/>
resources, but I would like some input from others who are experienced<br/>
with this particular area. Any book recommendations?<br/>
            I also wondered how I would be able to keep up with them in<br/>
an unschooling setting.  For example, my 5 year old has already<br/>
exhausted my knowledge of place values (I only know up to 100<br/>
dectillion, and then googol and googol plex and I�m a math teacher by<br/>
trade lol) and counting in various languages.  My 9 year old is learning<br/>
visual c++ which I can�t help with.  Am I setting myself for failure?  I<br/>
know I�m smart, but how can I possibly help them learn everything they<br/>
want to learn?  Is it unschooling to let them have lessons that they ask<br/>
for in certain areas?  My 5 year old wanted to learn Spanish so bad, so<br/>
a friend of mine is helping him learn it (I don�t know it).<br/>

<br/>
It isn&#39;t a specifically unschooling list -- it&#39;s general<br/>
homeschooling, but there are definitely unschoolers on it and most<br/>
people seem to be relaxed/eclectic and unschooling-friendly. (At least<br/>
that was true the last time I was on it, a year or more ago now.)<br/>
David Albert, who wrote &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me&quot; about<br/>
homeschooling (relaxed) his two &quot;gifted&quot; daughters, is (was?) very<br/>
active on it. That&#39;s a good book on the subject if you haven&#39;t read<br/>
it. He wrote another homeschooling book too whose name I don&#39;t recall<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
I also recommend Lisa Rivero&#39;s &quot;Creative Home Schooling: A resource<br/>
guide for smart families.&quot; It used to actually have the word &quot;gifted&quot;<br/>
in the title, but in the second edition it was taken out, whether to<br/>
appeal to a wider audience or what I don&#39;t know. It also is from a<br/>
very relaxed/eclectic viewpoint and would be a good resource guide for<br/>
an unschooling family who just wanted some ideas for finding things<br/>
their kids might be interested in doing. (You can find all these books<br/>
on Amazon if you want more info or to order them.)<br/>

worse. They would have less freedom to explore their interests and<br/>
would be more constrained by a curriculum. Oh -- right, now I see that<br/>
you say they are in school now. Do they have teachers now that can<br/>
help them learn these things, or are they sitting around bored out of<br/>
their minds while their classmates do stuff they mastered years ago?<br/>
I&#39;m guessing the latter.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the only option that will let your kids learn what they<br/>
want to learn, when they want to learn it. Every other educational<br/>
option is about controlling the pace and content of their learning to<br/>
a lesser or greater extent. You don&#39;t have to know everything they<br/>
want to know. Unschooling isn&#39;t about transferring the contents of<br/>
your head into theirs. It&#39;s about helping them explore the world in<br/>
the way they want to explore it. Google (the search engine, not<br/>
&quot;googol&quot; the amazingly high number) is your friend; so is the library.<br/>
So are all the people around you who know different stuff than you --<br/>
like your friend who speaks Spanish. If your child was dying to learn<br/>
Spanish and is enjoying the help your friend is giving him, fantastic!<br/>
If he isn&#39;t enjoying it, you can help him find another resource that<br/>
will help him. Another Spanish speaker, or a computer program, or a<br/>
trip to Mexico, or CD lessons that you both listen to in the car . . .<br/>
you can use your imagination. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about never doing &quot;lessons&quot; or taking classes or<br/>
doing anything that looks like something that might be done in school,<br/>
it&#39;s about kids being in control of their own lives and learning. You<br/>
are the person who can help them with the practical details of<br/>
brainstorming ways to find out what they want, providing<br/>
transportation and materials, searching for things on the computer or<br/>
library or phone book if they aren&#39;t up to it, making phone calls to<br/>
people they might not have the social skills to deal with yet, paying<br/>
for stuff :) or helping them come up with ways to finance what is not<br/>
in your budget that is important to them. It&#39;s about giving your 9<br/>
year old permission to sit for six hours straight programming C++ (if<br/>
that&#39;s what he wants) instead of making him stop and learn his<br/>
spelling words. It&#39;s about giving them the freedom and the *power* to<br/>
be themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing -- once you start unschooling, you will probably find it<br/>
less and less necessary to think of your kids as &quot;gifted.&quot; It&#39;s a<br/>
label I used reluctantly when my son was in school and now just don&#39;t<br/>
feel a need for at all. It&#39;s a label like ADD that makes sense in the<br/>
context of school, where they are trying to standardize kids and<br/>
anyone who is more resistant to standardization needs to be placed (at<br/>
least mentally) in another group to make the lives of teachers and<br/>
administrators easier. All unschoolers need to worry about is letting<br/>
their kids be *themselves.* Comparing them to anyone else is not only<br/>
pointless, it&#39;s just not necessary. <br/>
<br/>
What I find amazing about unschooling is the realization of how<br/>
extremely individual kids are, much more than is acknowledged in<br/>
school, where kids just tend to be thought of as &quot;the brainy one,&quot;<br/>
&quot;the jock,&quot; &quot;the artistic one.&quot; It&#39;s more likely, in my experience, to<br/>
be something like &quot;the one who&#39;s really obsessed with really high<br/>
numbers right now and is dying to learn Spanish and watches the Star<br/>
Wars movies over and over and can sit for three hours playing with<br/>
pattern blocks but next year he&#39;ll be obsessed with marine life and be<br/>
dying to play role playing games with his older brother and read the<br/>
Tom Swift books over and over and sit around making up secret codes<br/>
for hours on end.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In other words, kids have really specific interests and needs, which<br/>
are constantly changing, and I find that it&#39;s more helpful to think in<br/>
terms of how to help them with the specifics of what they want right<br/>
now -- whether it&#39;s a way to learn Spanish or a cool computer game or<br/>
a glass of juice :) -- rather than to think in grandiose terms of<br/>
providing all the intellectual enrichment they will ever need for the<br/>
rest of their lives. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763338613">I am not the best one to answer your questions, as I didn&#39;t really &quot;get&quot;<br/>
unschooling until about 6-12mos ago, but I will give it a shot.  I do have a<br/>
son who attend grades k-5 in public school where they classified him as<br/>
&quot;gifted&quot;, and he was placed in GATE (gifted and talented program).<br/>
<br/>
In our case, we don&#39;t do anything differently because he was titled<br/>
&quot;gifted&quot;.  I also a daughter who was always &quot;below grade level&quot; -- and we<br/>
don&#39;t do anything differently with her.  I really don&#39;t think unschooling is<br/>
about titles such as that.  And actually, I can&#39;t stand even using these<br/>
titles/descriptions anymore.  We literally have child-led learning in our<br/>
home and that is what we do.  No labels....we just have kids who love to<br/>
learn, who are learning in everything they do.  My son loves math and<br/>
history.  He literally sits and watches the history channel for a couple<br/>
hours every single night.    He is starting to pass me up when it comes to<br/>
math -- but that doesn&#39;t scare me.  I am really not his teacher...I am a<br/>
tour guide who helps him to get where he wants to go.  In this time and age,<br/>
we have the world wide web full of resources.  Libraries full of books.  Not<br/>
to mention all of the other ways he can learn math from our real life<br/>
situations.  He has expressed an interest in taking college math courses<br/>
soon (he is 12), and I fully support that.  He does appear more &quot;scholarly&quot;<br/>
than my daughter -- she&#39;s much more artistic than him.  But that doesn&#39;t<br/>
changes what happens in our home.  In our home they just live life.  They<br/>
pursue what is important to them and what interests them.  I just think that<br/>
when you truly see it from this simple view, the matters of being &quot;gifted&quot;<br/>
or not, just don&#39;t matter.<br/>

<br/>
I have been on the list for the recommended couple weeks before posting,<br/>
and have been on this list in the past.  I don&#39;t believe I have ever<br/>

I realize that all children are gifted in various ways.  I have children<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll put in another plug here for the Wikipedia and Wikimedia projects.<br/>
Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org) is an organically-growing online =<br/>
encyclopedia<br/>
project, under the umbrella of the larger Wikimedia group.  Wikimedia<br/>
(www.wikimedia.org) also includes textbooks, including foreign-language<br/>
texts, for unschoolers who benefit from the structure of textbooks.<br/>
<br/>
An even more exciting possibility, for students of foreign languages, is<br/>
keeping up with the news in a foreign language -- just hit Google News, =<br/>
and<br/>
take your pick of localized news selections, in a wide variety of =<br/>
languages.<br/>
(Even the different English-language versions can be interesting for a =<br/>
look<br/>
at the news of the world from a viewpoint that&#39;s not always the same as<br/>
ours...)<br/>
<br/>
Too, there are loads of sites out there for kids, and some of those are<br/>
available in different languages.  I&#39;ve not had occasion to go looking, =<br/>
but<br/>
I&#39;d be shocked if many of those aren&#39;t also available en Espa=F1ol.=20<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, C++ resources abound on the Internet - some quite structured, =<br/>
and<br/>
others much less so.  It&#39;s an exciting - no, an intoxicating! - time to =<br/>
be a<br/>
self-directed learner!!<br/>

 <br/>
Right!  This is exactly why we are quitting school.  They have been in a<br/>
private school which has been better academically than the surrounding<br/>
public schools, but still very stifling and boring!  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the only option that will let your kids learn what they<br/>
want to learn, when they want to learn it. Every other educational<br/>

brainstorming ways to find out what they want, providing<br/>

library or phone book if they aren&#39;t up to it, making phone calls to<br/>
people they might not have the social skills to deal with yet, paying<br/>
for stuff :) or helping them come up with ways to finance what is not<br/>
in your budget that is important to them. It&#39;s about giving your 9<br/>
year old permission to sit for six hours straight programming C++ (if<br/>
that&#39;s what he wants) instead of making him stop and learn his<br/>
spelling words. It&#39;s about giving them the freedom and the *power* to<br/>
be themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for this!  I sometimes wonder if what I envision is actually<br/>
unschooling because sometimes it can sound like I should leave them<br/>
alone entirely and let them find ways to teach themselves things that<br/>
they happen across.  Obviously I would never do this but I have somehow<br/>
gotten that impression from some unschoolers.  What you describe above<br/>
is exactly what I imagine life to be like next year.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Another thing -- once you start unschooling, you will probably find it<br/>
less and less necessary to think of your kids as &quot;gifted.&quot; It&#39;s a<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230494507">Hello everyone, <br/>
 i am very upset right now and need to get some input<br/>
as to how to handle this situation.  Long story short:<br/>
My husband got a job offer in NYC at the beginning of<br/>
the semester that I went back to grad school with a<br/>
baby and a three year old so we moved in with my older<br/>
brother (also in grad school) and dad temporarily. <br/>
Well my dad is the authoritarian type ( I grew up in<br/>
divorced household) and he comments or sneers at the<br/>
way I deal with my three year old. he says he is on<br/>
his way to being out of control and he &quot;out thinks &quot;<br/>
me (OUCH!!!! THat&#39;s nasty), but anyway, Today, the<br/>
baby had been up all night teething and I was tired,<br/>
but fixed the kids breakfast and my oldest Apsu (3.5<br/>
yrs) said &quot;how do ya do?&quot; (a little game that we play<br/>
and I said just fine how do you do? My dad interjects<br/>
with I do just fine ( trying to make a joke.... well<br/>
ds doesn&#39;t like jokes and my dad interrupted him so he<br/>
said &quot;excuse me pop I was talking to mamma&quot;  well my<br/>
dad started on this lecture about how rude he was and<br/>
how when Apsu wants to talk to him he is NOT going to<br/>
want to talk.  My dad interrupts Apsu constantly and<br/>
sometimes Apsu defends himself by saying &quot;hey I was<br/>
talking etc.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
My question is Is my child out of control?  Is he<br/>
being disrespectful?   When we go out if an adult<br/>
speaks to him and he feels shy or doesn&#39;t like the<br/>
person he won&#39;t talk to him... this is such a battle<br/>
for me because in the African American community it is<br/>
NOT acceptable at all and so most of my parenting<br/>
choices are seen as me trying to be something<br/>
else-they mean other than black... This opinion is<br/>
held by intelligent people yet they cannot comprehend<br/>
that even at three Apsu is very perceptive and knows<br/>
he has rights and wants them to be respected too.<br/>
<br/>
 I really could use advice on how to deal with my<br/>
father because I have always had the try to please,<br/>
never been good- enough, try to prove him wrong<br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry in adavnce for the spelling- I need to take a<br/>
shower before the baby wakes up and I didn&#39;t spell<br/>
check .<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Gia and the family!<br/>
<br/>

I hate to foster the idea of bickering, but I think you should defend your  <br/>
child when he so politely says, &quot;Excuse me...&quot;  Tell dad that Apsu will  learn <br/>
his manners by demonstration, and ask him not to interrupt the  child.  Apsu <br/>
seems to have pretty good manners, to me.<br/>
 <br/>
OTOH, maybe Pop wants to play the game, too, and he feels left out.   Apsu <br/>
will never recognize Pop as part of the game if Pop doesn&#39;t behave  <br/>
respectfully, though.  Perhaps a private talk with Pop about it, if he&#39;s  willing, is in <br/>
order.<br/>
 <br/>
I think a lot of little kids don&#39;t like jokes because they think they&#39;re  <br/>
being mocked.  Three-year-olds don&#39;t understand a lot of jokes, and the  <br/>
perceptive 3 yo, such as Apsu, who doesn&#39;t understand the joke, but knows Pop  has <br/>
little respect for his ideas, might just take offense at the joke.   What he <br/>
really objects to is that Pop doesn&#39;t respect him.  <br/>
 <br/>
Pop needs to earn some respect from Apsu, I think.  He&#39;s a grown  up.  Surely <br/>
he can swallow his pride a little and recognize the boy&#39;s need  for respect.<br/>
 <br/>

Thank you, that was very insightful.  I don&#39;t know if<br/>
I mentioned that we live here and my dad has the last<br/>
word about everything so I spend a lot of time out of<br/>
the house with my boys.  He wants to be involved, but<br/>
doesn&#39;t relate well to him although you can&#39;t tell him<br/>
that.  I apprecaite your suggestions about including<br/>
pop and explaining that we are Apsu&#39;s example.  I hope<br/>
it helps without starting World War III KWIM?<br/>

[***] I know you&#39;re speaking kind of tongue in cheek here, but it might<br/>
be helpful to hear a bit more often.  I remember when I used to read the<br/>
tcs (Taking Children Seriously) list for a few years, the mantra was<br/>
repeated frequently that tcs was very different from neglect, that<br/>
typical parenting is often neglect, and that tcs is extremely hands on.<br/>
<br/>
Even though this is not tcs, it seems pretty similar in many ways.  I<br/>
know the reaction to people who want to control their child&#39;s every<br/>
waking moment is to tell them to leave the poor kid alone.  Let them<br/>
watch tv, let them play games, etc.  I&#39;m probably not the only one who<br/>
has gotten the impression that unschooling meant much less hands on<br/>
parenting than is actually true.  It seems to me that unschooling would<br/>
require more time and dedication from the parent even than traditional<br/>
school-at-home, since that has time boundaries and specific objectives<br/>
and assessments.  In reading the articles on the unschooling.com website<br/>
it is obvious that this type of approach (hands on, brain on) is<br/>
recommended, but sometimes in just reading the message boards and email<br/>
lists it can seem that a hands-off approach *is* unschooling.  Thanks<br/>
for understanding what I was trying to say!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to discuss the gray area between the extreme of neglect and the <br/>
extreme of overcontrol.  I tend to be soooo concerned about avoiding <br/>
being &quot;controlling&quot; that I may swing too far to the other end.  (I <br/>
personally hate to be told what to do, and my son and my dad are very <br/>
similar in that respect, so perhaps not telling them what to do is a <br/>
sane and sensible strategy.  But maybe it isn&#39;t.)<br/>
<br/>
Is there a fine line up the middle, between the extremes, that I can walk?<br/>
<br/>
I think that when people have come onto this list (in the dim past) with <br/>
very controlling school ideas, we tended to tell them -- &quot;Stop it&quot;.  And <br/>
that isn&#39;t always sufficient to tell them what to &quot;start&quot;.  I&#39;ve done a <br/>
lot of stopping, a lot of not-meddling, but I don&#39;t initiate much, and I <br/>
wonder if I&#39;ve gone too far and am actually not contributing what I <br/>
should to the family.  (I&#39;ve tentatively planned a lot of playdates for <br/>
January, but haven&#39;t sat down and penciled in museum field trips to meet <br/>
an educational quota.  But, I might find it comforting if I did.)<br/>
<br/>
Just following the lead of my child is probably not enough <br/>
participation.  It certainly feels uncomfortable when the child isn&#39;t <br/>
bubbling over with suggestions, and spends big chunks of time on the <br/>
couch.  But for me, when hearing the advice not to push a school <br/>
curriculum, I tend to overreact and think that I shouldn&#39;t promote <br/>
anything, unless my child is already interested in it.<br/>
<br/>
Is it wrong or unhelpful to strew things that are very schooly, or even <br/>
a little bit schooly?  Is it reasonable to promote nonfiction as a <br/>
balance to lots and lots of fantasy and gaming?  Or is that just <br/>
wrongheaded?<br/>
<br/>
Worries about math (natch), and science facts and handwriting and <br/>
geography are nibbling me.  Most of my friends with kids the same age <br/>
are eclectic homeschoolers, with daughters who are brilliantly bookish.  <br/>
(One nine year old reads Shakespeare, and the others cut from the same <br/>
cloth.  It&#39;s unreasonable to expect him to be just like them, but they <br/>
are the kids that I hear about most.)<br/>
<br/>
Philosophically I&#39;m trying to answer the question &quot;Should I row the boat <br/>
more, or should I just let it drift downstream?&quot;  Are there other <br/>
choices?  Should he be holding his own (metaphorical) oars?  (He&#39;s ten <br/>
going on eleven.)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve talked, in the past, that the middle years can be discouraging in <br/>
unschooling.  If the kid isn&#39;t passionately pursuing something that <br/>
looks braggably academic, then he can seem &quot;behind&quot; his schooled and <br/>
homeschooled peers who are being pushed into learning.  But his <br/>
enthusiasm for learning and his ownership of his own mind are being kept <br/>
alive, and that&#39;s important to me.  I&#39;m just not feeling very <br/>
comfortable with &quot;behindness&quot; and seeing such slow progress on things <br/>
like handwriting, I&#39;m having a hard time believing that what he needs <br/>
will eventually develop.<br/>
<br/>
If this feels too abstract and self-indulgent, then feel free to let it go.<br/>
<br/>
I think moving two years ago has been a setback for us.  There is only a <br/>
tiny support group here in town, so we aren&#39;t swept along into <br/>
activities because our friends are doing them.  For me, going to the <br/>
park alone and going to the museum alone aren&#39;t any fun.<br/>
<br/>
What can I do that is positive?  Is this process dependent on me doing <br/>
more?  Or is &quot;being&quot; more important than &quot;doing&quot;?  Would encouraging him <br/>
to practice handwriting directly, or indirectly, be harmful, beneficial, <br/>
neutral, or a waste of money?  I feel like I should be able to figure <br/>
this out by myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378738356">Betsy, how long have you been unschooling? I&#39;ve only been working on <br/>
it for part of a year and my oldest is only four, but I&#39;ve already <br/>
noticed a period (a month or two) when he seemed like he was learning <br/>
very little followed by a period (still going) when he resembles a <br/>
sponge asking a million questions about many different areas and <br/>
jumping ahead in abilities. He went straight from not drawing shapes <br/>
to writing half the alphabet overnight. Etc. The &quot;quiet&quot; phase <br/>
brought about a few qualms, esp. when visiting a neighbor&#39;s house <br/>
with her 4 y o&#39;s walls covered with all the &quot;work&quot; he &quot;produces&quot; at <br/>
pre-school. <br/>
<br/>
I need to follow through on something I said I&#39;d write months <br/>
ago...sort of a chart on &quot;when you stop doing X, you can replace it <br/>
with Y and then Z will happen.&quot; Ex: when you stop correcting  <br/>
spelling, you will see more of what the child is trying to express.&quot; <br/>
Little kid example: when you stop nagging about putting on socks <br/>
because it&#39;s winter, you will (over time) be able to offer advice on <br/>
appropriate amounts of clothing for different conditions and you&#39;ll <br/>
gain an understanding of what&#39;s actually appropriate for this one <br/>
child--and so will he.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still working on strewing without valuing the &quot;academic&quot; activity <br/>
more. To me that&#39;s the ideal: to strew all sorts of math games, <br/>
books, games, toys and outings without silently cheering for any <br/>
particular choice.<br/>

Schooly like a science kit?  <br/>
Schooly like a list of pronouns you want him to memorize?<br/>
<br/>
We have a big chart of all the presidents on the wall.  It&#39;s been taken down <br/>
twice before, but people want it back up.  That&#39;s the kind of things schools <br/>
might have too, but we don&#39;t &quot;do anything schooly&quot; with it.  It&#39;s just there.  <br/>
It&#39;s used at least once a week, I think, and people new to the house almost <br/>
always spend some time looking at it.  Holly asked yesterday which president was <br/>
oldest when he took office.  I said I didn&#39;t know, and she went to look at <br/>
the chart.<br/>

Strewing, pointing out a sunset, an interesting article, making new food, <br/>
cleaning the bathroom and leaving something in there that he&#39;s never seen but <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541156351">I have a few recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I<br/>
<br/>
already know many of their interests and passions, since they have<br/>
<br/>
taught themselves most of what they know anyway; they certainly haven’t<br/>

learned it in school.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/wordswords">http://sandradodd.com/wordswords</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about the difference between &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;learn&quot; and the change it will <br/>
make in your thinking to consider them carefully.    If you say &quot;They learned <br/>
most of what they know on their own anyway,&quot; it seems like just a little <br/>
change, but it will change everything.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I wondered if there are any resources or discussion lists specifically<br/>
<br/>
about unschooling academically “gifted” children, or if there is any<br/>
<br/>
difference at all. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are lists about academically gifted children, out the wazoo.<br/>
I&#39;m sure unschooling works the same way regardless.<br/>
I&#39;m positive that those labels do as much harm as others.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I would like some input from others who are experienced<br/>
<br/>
with this particular area. Any book recommendations?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Howard Gardner&#39;s Frames of Mind helped me a lot.<br/>
You don&#39;t have to read it cover to cover, just familiarize yourself with the <br/>
gist of it (if you don&#39;t have much time, and few parents of younger kids have <br/>
tons of extra time).<br/>
<br/>
-=- I also wondered how I would be able to keep up with them in<br/>
<br/>
an unschooling setting.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a race.  You don&#39;t need to keep up with them, but if you&#39;re all <br/>
there in the same place, it&#39;s easy to spark each others&#39; curiosity about all kinds <br/>
of things.<br/>

<br/>
No, but you&#39;ll do better when you let go of the &quot;smart&quot; measurements and <br/>
comparisons for them and you too.<br/>
<br/>

for in certain areas?  -=-<br/>

Yes, we do.  Both my spouse and I are Shakespeare enthusiasts.  Oh, and <br/>
we got The Reduced Shakespeare Company from Netflix, and the humor in <br/>
that was very popular with James.  I think he watched it three times.  <br/>
(I watched 1/2, left during the Titus scene because I was eating, and <br/>
came back to see parts of the second time.)<br/>
<br/>
I may be shooting my efforts in the foot by being too penny pinching.  <br/>
There are some Broadway Theatre Archive plays that I&#39;d like to get, esp. <br/>
Cyrano, but I&#39;m having trouble actually parting with the money.  (Last <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Reading your whole post, I kept wanting to say, &quot;Yes,&quot; meaning that I <br/>
think parents should be very involved and be initiating a lot of stuff <br/>
for their kids (with the kids free to turn it down, of course). But - <br/>
then every time I was about to say &quot;yes&quot; you mentioned a specific of <br/>
what you were thinking about and I immediately switched to &quot;NO NO <br/>
NONONO!!!<br/>
<br/>
Handwriting isn&#39;t important. My oldest and middle child are both <br/>
successful college students - one has great handwriting and one has <br/>
poor handwriting. It doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
But - I do think unschooling parents ought to be pretty alert and aware <br/>
of potentially interesting stuff to offer to their child. Just before I <br/>
read your post, Betsy, I was checking out the Getty museum&#39;s hours. We <br/>
have another trip to the Museum of Radio and Television booked for next <br/>
week - the kids LOVED that one, last time we went here. We&#39;re going to <br/>
see the King Tut exhibit - have to book months ahead for that. I was <br/>
JUST sitting here thinking that I&#39;d like to set up a camping trip to <br/>
the desert in the spring. Tomorrow night we might go spend the night on <br/>
the streets of Pasadena and watch the Rose parade in the morning IF the <br/>
rain stops early enough in the afternoon. I ask my kids to play games <br/>
with me all the time.  I happened to find a little quilt-making kit in <br/>
some old craft supplies and I took that out and offered it to Rosie. My <br/>
point is that I am doing a lot of the &quot;initiating&quot; around here - but <br/>
the kids are doing far more of it now than they did at 10 or 11 years <br/>
old.<br/>
<br/>
NONE of my initiating is designed to directly or indirectly get the <br/>
kids to learn something like handwriting or math. They are always <br/>
experiences that I think are likely to be enjoyed for their own sakes, <br/>
not as a means to an end.<br/>
<br/>
Not everybody likes to be on the go as much as we have been over the <br/>
years. We&#39;re slowing down these days - enjoying long days at home. Here <br/>
in Southern California we don&#39;t have weather to keep us in and there <br/>
are so MANY cool things to do - we sometimes overdo it. I have started <br/>
to be the one to say, &quot;How about we don&#39;t make any plans for Friday - <br/>
just stay home and putter around?&quot; This is still me doing the <br/>
initiating.<br/>
<br/>
If I didn&#39;t find out about things and tell my kids about opportunities, <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t do 1/10th as much as what they do choose to do.So, the <br/>
answer is, yes, I think the unschooling parent&#39;s role is to act as a <br/>
resource person.<br/>
<br/>
BUT - the goal is a satisfyingly-immersed-in-life present - not finding <br/>
ways to sort of trick a kid into learning something.<br/>

things for *you* to do.  My kids know they can throw themselves 100% <br/>

There is a whole lot of facilitating (I hate that word but can&#39;t <br/>

my kids that I want, I can drag them to everything I think they&#39;ll <br/>

more stuff and more places to go.<br/>

and *you* learn to write beautifully.  If you&#39;re doing it for the <br/>
right reasons (you love it, find it fun, have a passion for it) your <br/>
kids will see that.  At some point in their lives, they may pick up a <br/>
pen and start to see how beautiful their handwriting can be.  If they <br/>
don&#39;t, they&#39;ve still seen you having fun learning something new.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be disgourage if they never decide that nice handwriting is <br/>

re: telling kids about opportunities<br/>
My son has a lot of initial reluctance about new things, and I am just <br/>
awful as a salesman.  Traditional parents get over the initial <br/>
reluctance by just telling their kids &quot;We&#39;re going -- you don&#39;t have a <br/>
choice.&quot;  I&#39;m not going to do that, although if I whine to the wrong <br/>
people about staying home, that&#39;s the kind of advice I get.  (e.g. &quot;Make <br/>
him go.  He&#39;ll enjoy it after the first ten minutes.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Strewing seems to work better, for me, with objects that can sit out on <br/>
the table or couch for awhile.  An offer to go on an outing seems more <br/>
ephemeral.  Should it be offered, say, three times?  (Far in advance, a <br/>
week in advance and that morning?)<br/>
<br/>
Proposals to go places with his friends are great, if we can get our <br/>
schedules synchronized.  When that isn&#39;t feasible, I suppose I could <br/>
offer &quot;let&#39;s go to the museum and get ice cream on the way home&quot;, if I <br/>
can manage not to sound desperate.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little frustrated with my very tired husband who may want to stay <br/>
home all day today, all day tomorrow and all day Sunday. <br/>

<br/>
What about going for the ice cream first and while you&#39;re already out,<br/>
having fun, eating yummy stuff, say &quot;Let&#39;s stop at the museum, I heard<br/>
they have a dinosaur display.&quot; (or whatever)  Would that be an easier<br/>
transition for him if he&#39;s already out of the house and doing something<br/>
fun? <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could then add an after museum thing too, whatever that might<br/>
be, stopping at the park or the game store or something.<br/>
<br/>
At night when Dylan and I are up late we sit on the couch and talk about<br/>
what we&#39;d like to do next day.   Sometimes we decide to stay home and<br/>
watch movies but often he has something he&#39;d like to go see or do.  We<br/>
make a plan about what time we&#39;ll leave, what else we can do while were<br/>
out.  If he says he&#39;d like to go climb the rocks at Washoe park (in<br/>
another town) I will mention some of the other things to do there. <br/>
There&#39;s an indoor pool at a resort nearby or an outdoor pool with a water<br/>
slide, there&#39;s a place called &quot;Goosetown&quot; where we feed the ducks and<br/>
geese, there&#39;s a little history museum, art gallery, an old train depot,<br/>
etc.  <br/>
<br/>
We just go, a lot.  We drive to a lake, take a picnic lunch, play.  In<br/>
the winter we take the sled.  We go snow shoeing.  We just go. <br/>
<br/>
When we stay home we play a lot of games.  Dylan really likes chess and<br/>
is up for a game almost anytime.  And there&#39;s the trampoline.  We bounced<br/>
on it yesterday when it was covered in snow.  That was cold and fun. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
The snow really flies up all around you and creates a wonderful<br/>
disorienting, flying feeling.  We thought we knew what it would be like<br/>
to be a snowflake after that. &lt;g&gt;  We live two blocks from a fairly good<br/>
sledding hill so that&#39;s always an option if there&#39;s snow. <br/>
<br/>
I tend towards hibernation in the winter so I work at offering ways to<br/>
get out of the house.  <br/>

I was very interested in the Presidential Election and discussed <br/>
political issues in front of my son fairly frequently and answered his <br/>
questions.  I&#39;m sure I gave him a biased view!  (I think he did learn at <br/>
lot from this.  And since we watch The Daily Show, he can lip-read most <br/>
swear words. &lt;g&gt;)  Oh!  I&#39;m reading a cool book,  _The Republican Noise <br/>
Machine_, which dates fear of the liberal media back to the Nixon <br/>
administration.  Yes, that man did NOT like criticism.<br/>
<br/>
James did get involved in gardening with us recently.  He likes the <br/>
taste-testing segments when I watch America&#39;s Test Kitchen.  So, prior <br/>
to planting a citrus tree, we had a citrus tasting and planted the one <br/>
he thought tasted best (Clementine).  He was enthusiastic about planting <br/>
that.  We have a break in the rain today, and I&#39;d like to go to the <br/>
nursery today to buy herb plants.  It would be nice if James wanted to <br/>
come with me, so my husband could come, too.<br/>
<br/>
** If beautiful handwriting is important to you, get a caligraphy set<br/>
and *you* learn to write beautifully**<br/>
<br/>
(OK, here&#39;s the part where I start to sound desperate.)<br/>
<br/>
(I can do calligraphy although I haven&#39;t demonstrated it for my child much.)<br/>
The issue isn&#39;t &quot;beautiful&quot; handwriting, it&#39;s the ability to write at <br/>
all.  He can make scraggly letters, but has written so little that he <br/>
has trouble remembering how all of the letters are formed.  The amount <br/>
of writing that he has done spontaneously is not more than 10 <br/>
*characters* at a time.  (maybe three words) and FAR less than 100 <br/>
*characters* per year.  (More like 50 or 60 single charcters in a <br/>
year.)  It&#39;s difficult for me to wait for him to want to write.  Right <br/>
now it seems that IF he had something he wanted to write, he couldn&#39;t do <br/>
it.  (He has never shown much interest in drawing.)  Could he really not <br/>
be developmentally able to do this?  That was my theory when he was 7 <br/>
and 8, but it&#39;s sounding thin now that he is almost 11.  (FYI, I&#39;m not <br/>
commenting to him about it at all, and I think my facial expressions are <br/>
neutral.)<br/>
<br/>
** I feel like I should be able to figure<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; &gt; this out by myself.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What fun would that be? :-)  If we all did that, we wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
enjoying this list.**<br/>
<br/>
OK, thanks.  My  husband is a great listener, but he is so &quot;not pushy&quot; <br/>
that it&#39;s hard to get any suggestions from him.  I did appreciate your <br/>
post, despite the fact that I &quot;talked back&quot; to it.<br/>

school thing.  I don&#39;t think it happens naturally anywhere else in <br/>
the world.  We&#39;ve created an ADD society because of it.<br/>
 <br/>

 </span></blockquote>my <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But why didn&#39;t you include your son in the shout?  He may have found <br/>
it interesting (boys and dueling!) or had his own ideas on the <br/>
subject.  How is he going to learn to share his learning passions <br/>
with you if you don&#39;t share yours with him?<br/>
<br/>
And if the topic comes up, I have lots <br/>

 </span></blockquote>directly <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; inspiring him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not the point of your interests though and you need to be more <br/>
interested in his knowledge than it what you have to impart.  <br/>
Teachers share their knowledge; learners share in the knowledge of <br/>
others.  You want to set the example of a learner.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So share it with him and your husband, be truly intersted in what <br/>
their opinions and ideas are and if he doesn&#39;t join in, that&#39;s okay.  <br/>
When he&#39;s ready, he will.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With him!  With him!  With him!  Answering questions is not a <br/>
discussion.  Discussion includes the give and take, sharing of new <br/>
concepts, clear communication and formulation of ideas that make it <br/>
the almost perfect *learning* tool.  It&#39;s the difference between <br/>
Socrates and No Child Left Behind.<br/>

go, head over there yourself.  Maybe hisinterst in the tree had to <br/>
with the fact he tasted the reward first.  Maybe he&#39;ll need to taste <br/>
the herbs when they&#39;re ready for him to become interested.  Or maybe <br/>
he just doesn&#39;t like herbs and never will. :-)<br/>

average and no one cares that his 1st piece of writing was for <br/>
college.  If you can talk, you can write.  When he needs/wants to he <br/>
will.  <br/>
<br/>
Ds and I had a discussion recently.  He was upset that I didn&#39;t make <br/>
him write when he was a child.  I explained my options; I could have <br/>
made him and he&#39;d be able to write but would hate it because it <br/>
seemed to be so difficult or I could wait until he was ready.  Given <br/>
the alternative, he realized that I made a good choice.<br/>

before, sounds cool to me - they have real mummies on display. Do you <br/>
think your friend Mikey might like to go with us?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And - it IS important to think of what is there that might entice HIM.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m wanting to go to that science museum where they have the &quot;bed of <br/>
nails&quot; you can lie down on and they sell rock candy on a stick in the <br/>
gift shop.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And - willingness to LEAVE when the kid has had enough - leave when <br/>
he&#39;s satisfied, don&#39;t push him to see ONE more exhibit. I&#39;ve gone to <br/>
art galleries with the kids when they were his age - and just looked in <br/>
one little area and then left. I&#39;d just say, &quot;I want to go see this <br/>
picture by Picasso - it is such a strange picture - all distorted and <br/>
deformed with eyes where they should not be and stuff, wait until you <br/>
see it - you can help me figure out what it is all about.&quot; And then - <br/>
just see that one painting - if he&#39;s interested in others, go ahead and <br/>
look at a couple of others, and then go.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - and gift shops at museums are often more fun than the museum for <br/>
the kids. And they often have some clever little relatively inexpensive <br/>
toys - sometimes related to the exhibits. It is okay to spend 20 <br/>
minutes in a museum and an hour in the gift shop and then go get ice <br/>
cream.<br/>
<br/>
I really really love museums and it has rubbed off on the kids. I&#39;m <br/>
trying to think back about how that has happened - because I never was <br/>
particularly conscious about it at the time, just did what it took to <br/>
get MY museum visits in and keep them happy at the same time.<br/>

Some shouted info he definitely heard. &lt;g&gt;  He wasn&#39;t &quot;excluded&quot;, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
It makes sense to me to share information with him if I think he will <br/>
find it interesting.  I don&#39;t share stuff that I think he would have no <br/>
reason to be interested in.  (I tend to think that my tastes aren&#39;t <br/>
shared by most people. &lt;g&gt;  I learned in elementary school that I was <br/>
weird and different.)  However some stuff seemed to be of greater <br/>
interest to my husband, who loves history, knows the names of the <br/>
people, and has an adult understanding of political issues.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I just don&#39;t know how to translate a great anecdote from an adult <br/>
source into a good soundbite for a younger person.  And maybe this is <br/>
just a &quot;negativity&quot; thing on my part with me generating too much of a <br/>

Holly, I&#39;m not getting this.  Would you give me an example, either from <br/>
your life or hypothetical?<br/>
<br/>
** So share it with him and your husband...**<br/>
<br/>
I had read it at the library while my husband and kid played at the <br/>
park.  I showed it to my husband, there, when he arrived.  (He read it <br/>
silently.)  If we had been at home, where we could be as loud as we <br/>

my son) by reading it aloud.  OK.<br/>
<br/>

We may be getting down to the crux here.  I&#39;d rather discuss politics <br/>

Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Unschooling and &quot;gifted&quot; children<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I have a few recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I<br/>
<br/>
already know many of their interests and passions, since they have<br/>
<br/>
taught themselves most of what they know anyway; they certainly haven�t<br/>
<br/>
learned it in school.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
HYPERLINK<br/>
&quot;http://sandradodd.com/wordswords&quot;http://sandradodd.com/wordswords<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about the difference between &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;learn&quot; and the change it<br/>
will <br/>
make in your thinking to consider them carefully.    If you say &quot;They<br/>
learned <br/>
most of what they know on their own anyway,&quot; it seems like just a little<br/>
<br/>
change, but it will change everything.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
[***] You&#39;re right.  I guess as a teacher (even one who is disillusioned<br/>
with institutional education) I have a ways to go to get out of the<br/>
whole teaching mentality.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I wondered if there are any resources or discussion lists<br/>
specifically<br/>
<br/>
about unschooling academically �gifted� children, or if there is any<br/>
<br/>
difference at all. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are lists about academically gifted children, out the<br/>
wazoo.<br/>
I&#39;m sure unschooling works the same way regardless.<br/>
I&#39;m positive that those labels do as much harm as others.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
[***] Really? I haven&#39;t told my kids they are &quot;gifted&quot;; but I do tell<br/>
them they&#39;re brilliant, and smart and that they blow me away when they<br/>
do.  What is harmful about that (not meant to be snarky, I am curious as<br/>
to your opinion)?  I also tell them they are adorable, and that they are<br/>
sweet, or generous or caring or however I perceive them acting at the<br/>
time.  I sometimes call them dorks or buttnutts or boogerheads too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 -=-I would like some input from others who are experienced<br/>
<br/>
with this particular area. Any book recommendations?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Howard Gardner&#39;s Frames of Mind helped me a lot.<br/>
You don&#39;t have to read it cover to cover, just familiarize yourself with<br/>
the <br/>
gist of it (if you don&#39;t have much time, and few parents of younger kids<br/>
have <br/>
tons of extra time).<br/>
<br/>
-=- I also wondered how I would be able to keep up with them in<br/>
<br/>
an unschooling setting.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a race.  You don&#39;t need to keep up with them, but if you&#39;re all<br/>
<br/>
there in the same place, it&#39;s easy to spark each others&#39; curiosity about<br/>
all kinds <br/>
of things.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
[***]Thanks for the recommendations. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 -= Am I setting myself for failure? -=-<br/>
<br/>
No, but you&#39;ll do better when you let go of the &quot;smart&quot; measurements and<br/>
<br/>
comparisons for them and you too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[***]  Why?  Obviously they will pick it up on their own, but what&#39;s<br/>
wrong with praising their strengths?  I don&#39;t tell them they are smarter<br/>
than everyone else or anything, but I do compliment them on the way they<br/>
think, their creativity, etc. when appropriate.  I am sure they realize<br/>
(or will eventually) that they are smarter than other people, and that<br/>
some other people are smarter than they are (by &quot;smart&quot; I am probably<br/>
not entirely correctly meaning ability to recall information, ability to<br/>
process thought very quickly, ability to learn new things very easily,<br/>
etc.).  Is there something wrong with that realization?  Not that it<br/>
should be used to make a value judgment, but it is useful information<br/>
for life (at least I think it has been for me).  Your thoughts are<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
 <br/>
Q<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 -=- Is it unschooling to let them have lessons that they ask<br/>
<br/>
for in certain areas?  -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tiling a shower.  Slowly and cautiously.  If I were a friend of<br/>
yours and <br/>
said I was nervous and wanted help and ideas, how would you help me?<br/>
Maybe <br/>
you already know, or maybe you could find me a book, or recommend a<br/>
friend who <br/>
has done it, or a webpage, or a video.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My 5 year old wanted to learn Spanish so bad, so<br/>
<br/>
a friend of mine is helping him learn it (I don�t know it).-=-<br/>
<br/>
DVDs are phenomenal resources, because you can change the language<br/>
track.<br/>
