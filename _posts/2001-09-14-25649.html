<br/>
&gt; If there is a separation of church and state why is the President going to a<br/>
&gt; Prayer/Church gathering/service this morning? Was he being paid as the<br/>
&gt; President to attend this gathering or going as a &quot;private citizen&quot;.  Why does<br/>

&gt; church is also the head of state.  I guess I&#39;m just a bit confused.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The service was multi-denominational, but even were it not, the President is<br/>
free to worship as he chooses the same as any American.<br/>
<br/>
He could not, under our Constitution, sign an executive order demanding that<br/>
all Americans say a prayer to Christ today.<br/>
<br/>
The Presidency is a salaried position, not an hourly position, so he gets<br/>
paid whether he&#39;s in the bathroom on on the phone to your Prime Minister. He<br/>
gets paid whether he&#39;s vacationing or signing treaties. So far, I don&#39;t<br/>
think there&#39;s been a serious suspicion that any American President doesn&#39;t<br/>
earn his salary with his working hours, so if they want to take time off to<br/>
worship (and most have, I think) we Americans don&#39;t hold it against them.<br/>
<br/>
Discrimination in hiring and firing based on religion is prohibited. There<br/>
is no official &quot;national religion&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The lines aren&#39;t always cleanly drawn, but the basics are in place.<br/>

There hasn&#39;t yet been a president who wasn&#39;t Christian.  It&#39;s not required, <br/>
but it&#39;s not forbidden.<br/>
<br/>
The church can&#39;t make binding policies (and which church would that be?  We <br/>
don&#39;t have one dominant Christian denomination, although I heard once most <br/>
Presidents have been Episcopalian or Presbyterian, but I don&#39;t know that for <br/>
sure.  I think Carter and Clinton have been the only Baptists.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
LBJ was Baptist.  (I could be wrong).  Kennedy has been the only Catholic <br/>
president.<br/>

It&#39;s not required,<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, that begs the question of what a Christian is.  Jefferson<br/>
explicitly denied Jesus&#39; divinity, pored scorn upon the Trinity, and considered<br/>
much of what Christians do as pagan superstitions. But he considered himself a<br/>
Christian. Adams was a Unitarian (it seems -- it&#39;s hard to be sure), but is silent<br/>
about such matters.  Lincoln was an unbeliever who went to Church.<br/>
<br/>
As to the early Revolutionaries, almost none of them would be acceptable members<br/>
of fundamentalist churches these days (with the exception of Patrick Henry) -- it<br/>
needs to be remembered that they all lived before the religious revivals of 1805<br/>
(&quot;The Great Awakening&quot;), and many were more likely to be reading Thomas Paine&#39;s<br/>
&quot;The Age of Reason&quot; (a Quaker atheist?) than their Bibles.  And Franklin? (he<br/>
liked to keep people guessing!) But in the context of their time, they certainly<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have been Moslems, or pagans, or Jews (they all knew how poorly they had<br/>
treated Haym Solomon, the financier of the Revolution), and Deism was a concept,<br/>
not a religion of the day -- so what else would they have called themselves?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-961772958">The government cannot enforce any religion, or deny any citizen the right to<br/>
worship. The president may call on the name of God if he so chooses, but<br/>
cannot make you do the same. Calling on the name of God is different than<br/>
enforcing a particular church&#39;s teaching. Whether you are Catholic, Baptist,<br/>
Pentecostal, Congregationalist, Episcopalian, Jewish, etc., you understand<br/>
what he means. If you are not of faith, you don&#39;t have to agree.<br/>

say to all of you that I love each and every one of you, no matter your belief systems or<br/>
schooling &quot;techniques&quot;.  I am a Christian and stand proudly on that but NEVER will put down anyone<br/>
for their beliefs.  In light of what has happened in our Nation this week, I should say that I am<br/>
disabled and &quot;homeschool&quot; my four children.  My husband is a Major in the Reserves and is awaiting<br/>
the call to service.  I just wanted to spread a little love here.  I care about you all and I<br/>

children.We all make mistakes, especially me.<br/>
