&gt;Frustrating is one way to put it.  As I said in my previous post, <br/>
&gt;many unschooling parents seem to have children who don&#39;t struggle <br/>
&gt;with choice.  These children always seem to peacefully and wisely <br/>
&gt;make decisions that are in their best interests.  Limits on <br/>
&gt;television watching and video games come to mind, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if these children just &#39;all of a sudden&#39; were able to handle <br/>
choices or if the parent&#39;s attitude was a major factor in this.<br/>
<br/>
Its not easy taking that unschooling step into trust and then not feeling <br/>
butterflies or stress when you see your kid repeatedly do something that <br/>
YOU deem of no value.<br/>
<br/>
With chores in my house, I have seen my son&#39;s room become impossible to <br/>
walk through. And it stayed like that for half a year. Not an easy task <br/>
for someone who likes things neat. But a task that I had to be up for, or <br/>
he would of never found his own limits.<br/>
<br/>
My grandmother used to tell me &#39;kids are a lot of work&#39;. And I know what <br/>
she means. Control and rewards are an easier way to parent, but one has <br/>
to decide if they will like the outcome.<br/>

and is on Prozac.  She knows she feels better when her sleep schedule <br/>
is patterned so that she is up during the day.  She also knows that <br/>
if she hangs out on the computer at night starts watching tv at <br/>
night, she will be up all night.  It&#39;s a pattern, she knows it, I <br/>
know it, we all know it.  The last time she got into a bad pattern, <br/>
she wuld get royally mad if we left the house without her.  We had <br/>
numerous discussions about the fact that it is like waking the dead <br/>
to get her up and we would give her one wake-up call and then be on <br/>
our way from then on.  She now understands it is her decision to get <br/>
out of or stay in bed and has stopped going off on us if we leave <br/>
without her.<br/>
In other words, it&#39;s her choice.  It does not matter if I want her up <br/>
in the morning or not.  But she had to learn to live peacefully with <br/>
the consequences too.  When she was going off on us for leaving her <br/>
at home, I started making her get up when we went out.  When she <br/>
decided to stop getting mad at us, I started leaving her alone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&#39;Work&#39; in the meaning that I wrote it is to be defined as &#39;not always <br/>
taking the easier/faster way out&#39; of a situation.<br/>
<br/>
This is most likely more physical when they are young, and more mental <br/>
when they are older.<br/>
<br/>
For example: You got a load of laundry to fold. Your two year old wants <br/>
to help (at that age they all want to help!). It would, of course, be <br/>
faster if you did it yourself. But if you let your child help it, it will <br/>
be more work for you to &#39;refold&#39; and to find the ones they walked away <br/>
with. But the lesson to them is worth your time and energy.<br/>
<br/>
As they get older, this can mean something like &#39;biting your tongue&#39; when <br/>
you pass by a messy bedroom for the 6th month in a row. Until eventually <br/>
they pull it together.<br/>
<br/>
Control and rewards are by far easier for getting the desired results <br/>
that a PARENT has in mind. But they aren&#39;t the best results for a person <br/>
to become a self-assured adult.<br/>

&gt; notice in her playing.  Could you tape her playing regularly, so she can<br/>
&gt; listen several months later?  How do you phrase your comments about her<br/>
&gt; playing?  Do you just tell her she&#39;s doing well, or do you find specific<br/>
&gt; things about her playing that she really *does* do well and comment on<br/>
&gt; those?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That was going to be my suggestion. My son was into magic a couple of years <br/>
ago. He was incredible! But during the learning stages, he would get SOOO <br/>
frustrated. I taped him. Later when he would have a lot of trouble learning <br/>
something new, I&#39;d play back the tape and show him how well he had mastered <br/>
some old manipulation. He could SEE the difference, because he had mastered <br/>
that particular move. It calmed him and lessened his frustrations. <br/>
<br/>
Now he&#39;s skateboarding. He&#39;s having trouble with some moves. HE has taped <br/>
earlier attempts to prove to himself he was improving. It helps his OWN <br/>
feelings of insecurity as he&#39;s learning something new or more difficult. <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter what I say---it&#39;s never quite enough. He was (is) one of <br/>
those kids that won&#39;t &quot;do&quot; it until he&#39;s sure he&#39;ll be able to. <br/>
(Talking/walking/reading/etc.), so we just go with the flow.<br/>
<br/>
One of the hardest things about school is that they pushed before he was <br/>
ready. If they could have waited---just a day or two----he would have been <br/>
confident that it was possible and not have gotten so frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d recommend a tape recorder or video camera---especially for <br/>
&quot;perfectionists&quot;.<br/>
