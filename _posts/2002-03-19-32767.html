I just finished mopping the floors. It was WAY overdue, let me tell you. They were really dirty and have been for a while. I guess I was putting it off, I would get to it when I was bothered enough by it. When I was in a cleaning mood. We have tile throughout most of the house, so I have a lot to mop.<br/>
<br/>
Last night and this morning especially, *I* really noticed the dirty floor. I&#39;m not sure if DH did or not. He didn&#39;t say a word about it. Thankfully, he didn&#39;t say &quot;boy, this floor is really dirty&quot; or &quot;when are you going to wash the floor?&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t live in a house with a floor like this!&quot; or any number of possible comments you could come up with. BUT, if he would have said anything to me about it, even if it was in a gentle way, I would have felt so bad. Like I wasn&#39;t doing my job. Like I wasn&#39;t measuring up in his eyes. I&#39;m so glad that he didn&#39;t say anything, and now when he comes home, he&#39;ll see that the floor is clean. If it bothered him before, he might comment that it looks nice and clean, but he might not even notice.<br/>
<br/>
The point of this story is that I try to be mindful and treat my kids the same way that I would like to be treated. Whether it&#39;s about chores or other things. I want my kids to know that they don&#39;t have to measure up to me. I want them to clean because they notice something needs to be cleaned, or because they are in a cleaning mood. Sometimes, all I have to do is start cleaning and that is enough to inspire them. Like when my youngest son saw me cleaning, he just cleaned his entire room. It looks great and so do the floors. :-)<br/>

<br/>
Nope. I don&#39;t have any daughters. I have 2 boys.<br/>
About the dirty floors and my DH noticing them, well it&#39;s just simple.<br/>
He is gone and works all day long. He gets home at say 6:30 - 7:00.<br/>
He is exhausted and stressed to the max from work.<br/>
He eats some dinner and watches some TV so he can relax enough to go to sleep.<br/>
Even still, he gets terrible insomnia sometimes.<br/>
IF I saw him come home in this state and be bothered by the dirty floors to actually pick up the mop and wash them, I would feel equally as bad as if he would have said something to me.<br/>
He has a job and supports us so the kids and I can stay home.<br/>
He does a lot of work around the house on his days off.<br/>
Some things I consider MY job, for the most part, and I feel that I am responsible for getting them done. I would not really consider mopping the floor to be a team effort. I like to do it to my specifications. (I really do it best). There are other things we do in a team effort fashion (especially deep-cleaning when company is coming! :-)<br/>
My whole point was, DH never says anything or nags about the house being messy, even if it is.<br/>
And I love that about him.<br/>

~Actually, think of how much someone would have to PAY you for all that. So in essence is is like doing a job- and actually it is usually much more difficult(and means much more) than working for a paycheck. <br/>

<br/>
/rant on<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;d like to address is the thought-theology behind work vs. <br/>
stay-at-home.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done both. I was the bread-winner in a two parent house. I was the <br/>
bread-winner as a single mom. And now I stay-at-home to unschool and do <br/>
*some* work from home for clients that I&#39;ve kept.<br/>
<br/>
I was a VP/operations for a chain of newspapers in NYC. I was GM for a <br/>
commercial print house in Silicon Valley. Lets just say, demanding, <br/>
high-stress jobs. Long hours, dealing with keeping peace amongst a lot of <br/>
different personalities, getting work out, tight deadlines, hiring, <br/>
firing, etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
You know, none of them was as demanding as unschooling. Not nearly as <br/>
rewarding either... but not as demanding.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a myth that staying at home is easier.. and procreating that myth <br/>
only allows the ones that do to disempower themselves.<br/>
<br/>
A few months ago there was a woman on another unschool list that asked <br/>
for a title to describe what she does.. because of the looks she was <br/>
getting from her husband&#39;s co-workers at social functions for being what <br/>
she termed as &#39;just a mom&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Think about this, if we put ourselves down, assume that we have it <br/>
easier, then we are responsible for the way people see our role.<br/>
<br/>
Now, obviously you can&#39;t change the world. One can only endeaver to work <br/>
on their own progress. There are always prejudices. BUT one can see <br/>
themselves and their contribution as being as important as it is.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling takes energy. No, not negative, but energy. Going here, going <br/>
there, doing, doing, doing. Even fun stuff takes energy!!! The <br/>
never-ending questions and never-ending search for answers... wow.. its <br/>
so dynamic!<br/>
<br/>
I have learned to play video games, I have knocked my brains out trying <br/>
to transform robots with missing parts, I have overstepped my comfort <br/>
level almost everyday because of my son&#39;s interests.<br/>
<br/>
When I was working.. it was MY professional interests.. it was MY chosen <br/>
field/job.. And not nearly as demanding on one&#39;s aging synaptic nerves <br/>
than a career that was ingrained in me.<br/>
<br/>
The household cleanliness shouldn&#39;t then fall onto the shoulders of one. <br/>
We are all working.. we are all doing demanding things. The household <br/>
falls into the community (and generally whoever is bothered by it most <br/>
*smile*).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034427490">This is one of those issues that is not only individual, but changes <br/>
over time. Long before we had kids, we agreed that when we had kids, I <br/>
would stay home and raise (yuk, hate that word) them, dh would earn the <br/>
money, and that we would continue to share the household work, as we did <br/>
while we were both in paid employment. And for 18 years we did that. I <br/>
tended to do more vacuuming, and cooking and cleaning, though dh always <br/>
did some. He did more car maintainence (I passed tools under the van <br/>
sometimes), gutter clearing (I get dizzy when higher than a few steps on <br/>
a ladder) etc etc, but dh always did some cooking, cleaning etc every <br/>
week. The last 2 years things changed. We have been living in a garage <br/>
plus sleepout for two years, while we build a house at weekends and <br/>
evenings. Yes, I help with that, but basically he has done most of it <br/>
with quite a lot of help from our 14yo and 18yo. I am doing the <br/>
housework and cooking - with help from my 11yo, 14yo and 18yo.  Soon, <br/>
the house building will finish and I expect dh will take over more <br/>
cooking, housework etc while I spend time sewing curtains, painting etc.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not really a matter of who should do what. It is a matter of it <br/>
feeling fair to all concerned. When I feel things are getting out of <br/>
balance, I let everyone know &lt;g&gt; So does dh. And my boys have absolutely <br/>
no hesitation in bringing up the subject of inequity!<br/>

Your post has made my year.  My dh doesn&#39;t have to try to make me <br/>
feel guilty; I have done it myself.  <br/>
<br/>
This is truly the toughest job that I have ever had.  The worry <br/>
alone is extremely exhausting. I would also like to add that <br/>
unschooling is way more draining than traditional homeschooling.  I <br/>
have a child in each camp, and  the unschooling one is far more <br/>
demanding of my time and energy.  <br/>
<br/>
I hate the stereotype that many have reagarding unschooling.  I have <br/>
friends who think that my decision to unschool my son was based upon <br/>
my not being able to handle schooling both kids. LOL <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should send my little questioner over to their house for a <br/>
day &lt;evil grin&gt;.<br/>
