<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010360931">When I &quot;found&quot; unschooling, Dana was around 3 years old.  Sometime between<br/>
when she was 3 and 5 a similar topic arose(I think on unschooling.com) and I<br/>
was a bit peeved when told I wasn&#39;t unschooling my child because she wasn&#39;t<br/>
school age.  Now that she is 6.5, and learning on her own the same thing her<br/>
school peers are having drilled into their heads I understand.  That said, I<br/>
don&#39;t think we would be at this point had I not labelled us as unschoolers<br/>
and allowed her the opportunity to go at her own speed.  Just the philosophy<br/>
in my head gave me the freedom to deschool and let us live.<br/>
<br/>
Having been on both sides of the fence, I think folks who have youngins<br/>
should be allowed to call themselves unschoolers and let them live out their<br/>
choices.  When I found unschooling, I was actually searching for appropriate<br/>
preschool information, so &quot;technically&quot; she would have been school age.  I<br/>
say, don&#39;t blow it by limiting the future unschoolers, let them claim the<br/>
label and help them grow.  Just because we are/were young and lacking hands<br/>
on experience doesn&#39;t mean our potential experience is of less value.<br/>

sistakammi<br/>
who&#39;s yahoogroups belch finally worked its way to the top and I am finally<br/>
caught up with the gazillion messages from all my yahoogroups<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Because until your child is old enough to attend<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; school how can you UN<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; school? You could adhere to unschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; philosophies/ child-led<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; learning/attachment style parenting or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; whatever....but they aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not so sure I agree with this.  My daughter&#39;s neighbour was over when<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; was visiting yesterday.  She was delighted to tell my daughter that her<br/>
&gt; daughter was learning her alphabet.  This little girl, who is about 17<br/>
&gt; months old is being taught to repeat the letters after her mother.  She<br/>
&gt; hasn&#39;t got a clue what it all means, but her mother thinks she&#39;s learning<br/>
&gt; her alphabet.  My grandson, at just about 16 months, isn&#39;t the least bit<br/>
&gt; interested in the alphabet, though he&#39;s crazy about books.  If he asked<br/>
&gt; Heather what the letters were, she&#39;d happily tell him.  Otherwise, it just<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t an issue.  Now I know that lots of people who end up sending their<br/>
&gt; kids to school would have the same attitude when their kids are that<br/>
&gt; little, but isn&#39;t my daughter unschooling Kaelin?  Does it make a<br/>
&gt; difference that she&#39;s also unschooling Skye, age 7?   I&#39;ve always told<br/>
&gt; people who were worried that they wouldn&#39;t be able to do a good job of<br/>
&gt; homeschooling that they&#39;ve been doing it since their child was born.  I<br/>
&gt; think that if they&#39;ve also been letting their child make any educational<br/>
&gt; decisions during those &quot;preschool&quot; years, then they&#39;ve been unschooling<br/>
&gt; since birth.  Obviously they aren&#39;t experienced unschoolers in the sense<br/>
&gt; that people with older kids are, but I don&#39;t agree that they aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I did not say it was all equal.  My point was, and is,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and seems to have been missed and equated to mean<br/>
&gt; &gt;other things, that experience does not equal wisdom.<br/>
&gt; &gt;That youngness does not equal niaveness.  That<br/>
&gt; &gt;prejudging based on those things can cause a person to<br/>
&gt; &gt;miss out on something important the person they are<br/>
&gt; &gt;judging has to offer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have to agree with this.  Too bad you probably don&#39;t live anywhere near<br/>
&gt; us, Kitrina.  You and my daughter would probably get along well.<br/>

was in public high school.  During his jr year he decided<br/>
that he was tired of the repetition that was taught in all<br/>
his other classes and spent all day in auto class until<br/>
they threw him out of school--was he unschooling? I <br/>
don&#39;t know, I may say that to define a certain mindset,<br/>
but technically he was in school--although he did take<br/>
charge of his education?? &lt;shrugging shoulders&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Guess you could be un-preschooling (there is even a folder<br/>
on unschooling message board named that).<br/>
Gosh now with some states pushing to lower the mandatory <br/>
education law to preschool I don&#39;t think that you could be far off<br/>
from calling yourself an unschooler. <br/>
<br/>
I knew that I was going to <br/>
hs when my dd was one. In fact I knew that I was going to unschool.<br/>
I didn&#39;t call myself an unschooler until my firstborn was of school<br/>
age.  But I have been known to say we have always unschooled<br/>
and for me that would encompass their early years, because <br/>
honestly we didnt&#39; do anything different when they hit school age,<br/>
except instead of LLL meetings we went to hs support group<br/>
park days.   <br/>
 <br/>
Yesterday my four yr old was asked about school if it was a day<br/>
off.  Before I could say anything he said &quot;we homeschool&quot;.  I <br/>
smiled and said, besides he&#39;s only four.  But funny, he &quot;thinks&quot;<br/>
he is hsing and he isn&#39;t even of school age.  Should I burst his<br/>
bubble?  Me thinks he might have a melt down if I did so (those<br/>
of you who know Jared know what I am talking about LOL).<br/>
He would be furious to think he wasn&#39;t  just like his siblings<br/>
regardless of his age. He has been going to field trips and park<br/>
days since he was a baby.   Is he unschooling. Not technically,<br/>
not yet.  I just thought it was pretty darn cute how quickly he<br/>
answered &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
Our LLL-outgrowth weekly playgroup evolved without missing a week into a <br/>
homeschooling group.  It morphed.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a good point, though.  If someone&#39;s third child can be &quot;unschooled <br/>
early&quot; because the whole family is heavily involved in it, then a family with <br/>
one single child should be acknowledged for same beliefs and methods and <br/>
conviction.  And it&#39;s true the NEA has been pushing for five years or so for <br/>
compulsive attendance, or at least fee option (head start) to start at three <br/>
(there&#39;s talk of 18 months, behind the scenes, I&#39;ve heard).  They started <br/>
accelerated masters&#39; programs several years ago--I know someone who got a <br/>
master&#39;s degree in early childhood education in one year, immediately <br/>
following a BA in early childhood education, without ever having taught.  She <br/>
taught one year.  Then she got a job overseeing other preschool teachers, and <br/>
certifying others.  (Another goal is to squeeze out the daycare workers now <br/>
existing, or become their professional supervisors.)<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t plan to be paid with parental tuition, but with the same sort of <br/>
educational funding schools have now (PLUS whatever federal programs they can <br/>
drum up).  And gosh, there are MANY un- and under-employed people with <br/>
degrees in early childhood education who NEED jobs to pay off their student <br/>
loans.<br/>
<br/>
Some people who switch to homeschooling (or to unschooling) have said it&#39;s <br/>
easy because their children had the basics from school (i.e. they can read <br/>
and write and multiply, I guess).  <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if things will evolve to the point that some kids who do go to sch<br/>
ool at five or six will be described as having done better in school because <br/>
they had good unschooling basics for years before that.  (It couldn&#39;t hurt!)<br/>
<br/>
People in Maryland and Delaware have described great inflexibility in the <br/>
consideration of whether kids will go to preschol or not.  Kids do.<br/>
<br/>
Someone I&#39;ve known since we both were childless lives in Maryland, works in <br/>
Washington (for the dept of education, reviewing proposals or contracts or <br/>
something), and she is at the furthest point of anyone I know from <br/>
understanding and accepting what we&#39;re doing.  Her one son is schooled within <br/>
an inch of his life.  But they do pay a lot of good attention to him when the <br/>
parents are home with him.  He has a pretty cushy life.<br/>
<br/>
So is it getting that way in California too?  Just cities?  Just middle and <br/>
upper class?  <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile there are states whose compulsory education doesn&#39;t kick in until 7 <br/>
or 8.<br/>
<br/>
New Mexico added kindergarten a dozen or so years ago to the required lineup. <br/>
 Some other states had it required before that.<br/>

else much thinks about it. Until Sandra mentions it. ;-) Some people get it.<br/>
Some people don&#39;t. Some people it takes years of experience -- and then<br/>
thought on it -- to see that there *is* a different mental state between<br/>
experience with a child learning the things he&#39;s supposed to need school to<br/>
teach him and being certain it can happen.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the only time it&#39;s helpful to ponder it is when a less experienced<br/>
person is speaking philosophically and telling an experienced person her<br/>
experience isn&#39;t valid.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or 8.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In PA, compulsory education age is 8 and kindergarden is mandatory.  <br/>
There is a push to make K mandatory and to make compulsory school age <br/>
6, which of course homeschoolers don&#39;t like because then we&#39;d have to <br/>
start filing affidavits and jumping through ridiculous legal hoops at <br/>
age 6 instead of 8.  <br/>
<br/>
However, just because comp. education begins at 8, no one except <br/>
homeschoolers really even realizes that.  EVERYONE signs their kids <br/>
up for kindergarden at age 5, and more recently, for K4 at age 4.  <br/>
When I tell most people that comp. age is 8 they are shocked.  Most <br/>
people don&#39;t even know they have a choice to not send their age 5 <br/>
kids to kindergarden.</div>
