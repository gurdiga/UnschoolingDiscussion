<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988808497">I homeschooled my 11-year-old son for a year and a half, now, against my <br/>
wishes he has returned to public school. He spent grades K,1,2&3 in public <br/>
school, then we had a wonderful time while he was 9 and 10, exploring the bay <br/>
area and reading and just having a good time. Trouble is, we live in a very <br/>
small town and there are no other kids near us. Even tho&#39;  he was involved in <br/>
activities outside the house, he very rarely interacted with other kids. They <br/>
lacked the familiarity of the kids he grew up with in public school. (may him <br/>
being mildly autistic has something to do with that)<br/>
Anyway, although I would be much happier to have him home, he is adament that <br/>
he will stay in school. I just moniter things by staying in close contact <br/>
with his teacher and principal. So please don&#39;t think that people who are in <br/>
public school don&#39;t know how to learn other ways, for some people, routine is <br/>
essential and comforting. For now we&#39;ll keep things &quot;as-is&quot;.<br/>
just my 2 cents<br/>
