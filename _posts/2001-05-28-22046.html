<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds about right to me! :)  Unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
In similar situations I pull the car over, stop everything, wait for clever <br/>
child to put seat belt back on, then proceed.  This sometimes needed to be <br/>
repeated.  The absolute rule about seatbelts doesn&#39;t seem to bother them <br/>
nearly as much as the car actually just stopping.  Not making progress and <br/>
just sitting there was enough to get their attention.  I&#39;ve had this with <br/>
both my kids.<br/>
<br/>
The kitty litter thing falls in the category of rearranging your house, imo.  <br/>
Putting things on higher shelves and knives in their own, high, drawer, etc.  <br/>
That sort of thing.  Eventually, mine are now 6 and 8 yo, you don&#39;t have to <br/>
do so much of this.  Of course, by now, I am used to having the knives there, <br/>
but . . .<br/>
<br/>
You are allowed to be in charge and a mean Mom if you need to get a little <br/>
one&#39;s attention.  Picking someone up and putting them in another room is also <br/>
a good idea sometimes.  A 2 yo crying because they don&#39;t want to go somewhere <br/>
or want to destroy something or want to do something dangerous is not <br/>
anything to get too upset about, imo.  If you didn&#39;t do the grownup thing and <br/>
stop them, by voice or action, then I would be upset.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents.<br/>
<br/>
Nance<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-80655030">Not much help here.......Going through the EXACT same thing, Mary, with my almost two year old daughter (August 18 b-day). She has become a tiny tyrant when she doesn&#39;t get her way. Kicking the dog, screaming that will shatter windows, absolute defiance when told &quot;no&quot;....we are trying to find something that works with her and is effective. Distraction only helps occasionally, yelling doesn&#39;t at all, a swat across the rear and she just looks at you, and forget &quot;time-outs&quot;--they are pointless with her. If you come across the magic solution, please bottle it and send it my way! Dr. James Dobson would re-write &quot;The Strong-Willed Child&quot; if he had to live with Jenna for a week!!! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-946628975">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m going to jump in here (I&#39;m a lurker) with a<br/>
suggestion that I hope will help. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve<br/>
read/heard it before but maybe just a reminder will<br/>
help??<br/>
When the 2 yr olds are acting like this, imo they are<br/>
asking for direct interaction with you. They&#39;ll do<br/>
whatever it takes to get your attention, even if it&#39;s<br/>
negative behavior. They&#39;ve at least gotten your<br/>
attention, right?  While I don&#39;t suggest being at<br/>
their constant beckon call, perhaps setting aside<br/>
specific times of day for one on one with them (first<br/>
thing in the morning, right before lunch and then<br/>
again before you put them in the carseat to run the<br/>
errands, etc.). Be sure to point out that they have<br/>
you heart and soul during this time and try to make it<br/>
a routine so that they come to depend on that time<br/>
with you. It was the only way I was ever able to<br/>
accomplish my work years ago when my girls were young.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063931728">What a great response, I have a 2 year old who also does this stuff and you are very right, they are looking for special time I know my son acts crazed like that when all he really wants is for me to read or take a walk or color or play with the play food with him!! it really does work!!! and I almost always forget that that is what is really going on!! thanks for the reminder!!!<br/>
also if you have a whiner, I used to tell my kids when they would whine, I am sorry I cannot hear you when you talk like that you have to talk nicely   (  I know it sounds all wishy washy yuck) but what happened was my daughter 2 or 3 yo at the time then looked up at me and made her voice as deep as she possibly could and said mom could I have a cookie!! it was sooo funny to hear that voice come out of her body it was like a mans voice !! but she wasn&#39;t whining and she knew it!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-658427296">LOL! Jenni, I&#39;m not laughing at your suggestion....really! But, if you could see our house---<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s just say, it&#39;s run for the comfort and convenience of the baby! <br/>
<br/>
We have rearranged things, moved things out of the way and made it where there&#39;s really nothing that Jenna can&#39;t do. She just doesn&#39;t hear &quot;no&quot; very often. We try to give her &quot;open doors&quot; to explore. Other than staying out of the street when she&#39;s outside, she pretty much has the run of the place....<br/>
<br/>
I think our problem is that she&#39;s &quot;spoiled&quot; (I really don&#39;t like that term, but...) Jenna knows she has everyone&#39;s attention, including our two older kids. They are actually worse than we are, &#39;cause when she &quot;ooooohs&quot;, they jump! And I say, &quot;ooohs&quot;, because Jenna talks only when she wants to. Seriously. She doesn&#39;t have to, therefore she chooses not to. One of these days, this child will walk up to me and talk in complete sentences. She is extremely bright, so there&#39;s no problem. She just has a mind of her own....<br/>
<br/>
By the way, how old are your kids? And what type of work were you able to do at home---like a home business? (I&#39;m gonna keep asking questions, so you won&#39;t keep lurking!!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-940933719">I am looking for creative solutions to something our <br/>
family is experiencing <br/>
with our almost 2 year old. He is very active, into <br/>
everything, etc. He also <br/>
begins to cry and have tantrums when he doesnt get &quot;his <br/>
way&quot;. . ie. today <br/>
two things come to mind. We are in the car and he is <br/>
trying to get out of his <br/>
car seat, and has become adept at figuring out how to <br/>
almost get completely <br/>
out of it. We pull over, and explain to him why he cant <br/>
get out (his own <br/>
safety) and then go on, and he continues doing the same <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
I second stopping the car for this kind of thing, I do <br/>
this for bickering or whining while I&#39;m driving, or <br/>
waving things around which will distract me.  It&#39;s <br/>
important to me not only that they&#39;re safe but that I&#39;m <br/>
not distracted while I&#39;m driving...<br/>
<br/>
 Later in the <br/>
day, my husband has him in the basement working with <br/>
him, and after being <br/>
told he cannot empty the cat litter box onto the floor, <br/>
as he has been trying <br/>
to do, he does it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Ewwww!  Does he get told why you don&#39;t want him (it <br/>
isn&#39;t that he can&#39;t is it, he&#39;s capable of it, which <br/>
he&#39;s proving, you don&#39;t want him to) to tip out the cat <br/>
litter?  And do you mean the clean or the used???  <br/>
Blech!<br/>
<br/>
 My husband says that he is testing him all day <br/>
long. I see it a bit different. . . but I am asking for <br/>
solutions. We try <br/>
diverting his attention but that goes nowhere. Once he <br/>
sets his mind on <br/>
something, he is intent. I end up yelling at times <br/>
which I hate. But this <br/>
afternoon he was headed for a dangerous area and I kept <br/>
saying no, and he got <br/>
this mischievous grin and kept going until I yelled <br/>
loudly, which made him <br/>
stop. . . to cry. So, I am looking for alternatives <br/>
that I am just not seeing <br/>
at the moment. Probably things I know, but need <br/>
reminding of. Thanks in <br/>
advance.<br/>
<br/>
I like the Faber/Mazlish books, part of their &#39;plan&#39; is <br/>
that if all else fails, TAKE ACTION! ie physical <br/>
action, like if a child&#39;s running towards a road and <br/>
there&#39;s a car coming, grab &#39;em, rather than shouting.  <br/>
If a teenager consistently &#39;borrows&#39; tools without <br/>
returning them or they&#39;re not cleaned up, then lock up <br/>
the tool box...  I have one child that if you don&#39;t <br/>
catch her at the right moment to empathise, she just <br/>
screams and stamps her feet, so timing&#39;s pretty <br/>
important too, I think.<br/>
<br/>
HTH a little, consider it an &#39;advice buffet&#39; *grin*<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So far, this sounds really quite normal. The thing that&#39;s worked best <br/>
here is to state what you think they&#39;re feeling - &quot;You sound very <br/>
frustrated&quot;, &quot;It makes you angry when you can&#39;t play with the <br/>
knife&quot;, &quot;You feel sad when the kitty doesn&#39;t want his tail pulled&quot;, <br/>
that sort of thing. That helps them to understand their emotions in <br/>
a  non-judgemental way. And the tantrums are going to happen, that&#39;s <br/>
just a fact of life with most kids this age. One thing I try to keep <br/>
in mind is that it&#39;s not my job to make my kids happy 100% of the <br/>
time. I try to keep them safe, and provide lots of time for <br/>
interaction and fun with them, but there will always be things in <br/>
life that are frustrating for them that I can&#39;t solve. Now it may be <br/>
the fact that they want to play with the sharp knives. In 15 years <br/>
maybe it will be a girl they want to date that doesn&#39;t like them. I <br/>
can help them process their emotions, but I can&#39;t take them away. <br/>
When I think of it that way, it helps me get out of the mode where <br/>
I&#39;m trying to solve everything for them, or think that I have to <br/>
somehow &quot;make it all better&quot;. OTOH, I don&#39;t just let them cry or <br/>
scream, I do my best to help them work through their emotions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ie. today <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; two things come to mind. We are in the car and he is trying to get <br/>
 </span></blockquote>out of his <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; car seat, and has become adept at figuring out how to almost get <br/>
 </span></blockquote>completely <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; out of it. We pull over, and explain to him why he cant get out <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(his own <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; safety) and then go on, and he continues doing the same thing. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that happens here too. My daughter (19 months) has figured out <br/>
how to unbuckle her seat belt. We try not to use the car too much <br/>
right now unless she&#39;s got lots of distractions. We sing fun songs or <br/>
I have a book she can look at along the way. If she does unbuckle, we <br/>
obviously pull over and buckle her back in. There&#39;s not much else to <br/>
do, really. TTSP (this too shall pass).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Later in the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; day, my husband  has him in the basement working with him, and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>after being <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; told he cannot empty the cat litter box onto the floor, as he has <br/>
 </span></blockquote>been trying <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to do, he does it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With this kind of thing, environmental control is probably your best <br/>
bet. Personally, I wouldn&#39;t have a toddler in the same room as a cat <br/>
litter box, esp. since my good friend found her toddler sitting in <br/>
theirs, using the scoop as a spoon... ewwwwwww.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 My husband says that he is testing him all day <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; long. I see it a bit different. . . but I am asking for solutions. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>We try <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; diverting his attention but that goes nowhere. Once he sets his <br/>
 </span></blockquote>mind on <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; something, he is intent. I end up yelling at times which I hate. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A few book recommendations that might help with the way you feel <br/>
and/or react to his behavior:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How to Talk so Kids Will Listen and Listen so Kids Will Talk &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When Anger Hurts Your Kids&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kids, Parents, and Power Struggles&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d recommend any of these for giving you concrete things you can do <br/>
to change your own side of things. Probably nothing right now is <br/>
going to change *his* behavior as it is just normal age-appropriate <br/>
testing of limits. I know with my daughter, she&#39;ll go up and pull the <br/>
cat&#39;s fur, the cat will get mad and swat her, and the next day she&#39;ll <br/>
do the same thing. So even pain and fright does not change her <br/>
behavior (not that I would implement those things on her, but the cat <br/>
does anyways).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But this <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; afternoon he was headed for a dangerous area and I kept saying no, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and he got <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; this mischievous grin and kept going until I yelled loudly, which <br/>
 </span></blockquote>made him <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; stop. . . to cry. So, I am looking for alternatives that I am just <br/>
 </span></blockquote>not seeing <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I try to keep it physical when it comes to safety. If my toddler is <br/>
headed for something dangerous, I put myself in between it and her, <br/>
or scoop her up, or do something to distract her, or whatever. It is <br/>
not their responsibility at this age to remember to protect <br/>
themselves from danger. It will be many years before they can take <br/>
this responsibility on so until then, we are the keepers of their <br/>
safety. Don&#39;t take his mischievous grin and behavior as an affront to <br/>
you or to your discipline. What he&#39;s doing is totally and completely <br/>
normal toddler behavior. What you can do is to keep reiterating your <br/>
safety rules to him (even if it seems like he&#39;s not listening, in the <br/>
long run it will sink in), model appropriate behavior, and be ready <br/>
with tools like distraction, silliness, songs, etc. in the meantime <br/>
to help things along. Like in the carseat, now when I buckle my <br/>
daughter in, I sing a little tune &quot;Buckle up for SAFETY, buckle up <br/>
for SAFETY&quot;. When she starts unbuckling herself, I sing the same song <br/>
and she joins along. Now she rarely tries to unbuckle herself because <br/>
we&#39;ve got this little song/game going. Eventually, she&#39;ll learn what <br/>
safety is, and like her older brother she&#39;ll make sure everyone in <br/>
the car is buckled in before we move!<br/>

since my oldest was born. By &quot;work&quot;, I meant doing<br/>
laundry or cooking ... the usual stuff. I wish I<br/>
*could* figure out how to manage a paying job along<br/>
with being a SAHM but I have other irons in the fire<br/>
that prevent me from even considering it ( I&#39;m taking<br/>
care of an elderly relative). <br/>
My girls are now 10 and 15. We&#39;ve been homeschooling<br/>
for about 11 yrs.  I&#39;m also a quilter but come from<br/>
the old mindset that it should to be hand-sewn. Old<br/>
lessons passed down from generations are hard to<br/>
un-learn :-).<br/>

Adults thing they are SO important... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not testing you, he&#39;s learning.  If he&#39;s testing anything, it&#39;s his own <br/>
power within the universe.<br/>
<br/>
I would say someone should sit next to him in the car, even if that means <br/>
nobody&#39;s in the front, and interact with him--talk to him, hold his hand, <br/>
sing to him.<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re home, hold him lots.  Do you have a hiking backpack? <br/>
Aluminum-frame thing?  Maybe he&#39;d still be willing to ride in one, even just <br/>
around the house.  Maybe he&#39;d fall asleep in it and you can slide it off then <br/>
and leave him in the frame pack on the floor next to the couch, with that as <br/>
a pillow, until he wakes up.  (I have done this many times...)<br/>
<br/>
Put the cat litter where he can&#39;t get to it, or give him some clean kitty <br/>
litter to play with.  It&#39;s boring.  He won&#39;t make it his favorite toy.  Let <br/>
him sweep some up with a little broom and dust pan.  If he wants to see what <br/>
it is and what it does, let him clean the litter box.  He&#39;ll do a bad job, <br/>
probably, but so?  Then stick him in the bathtub if it grosses you out, or <br/>
the shower.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend the following bathtub toy:  ICE<br/>
You don&#39;t have to clean it up later.  It floats.<br/>
<br/>
Holly, at 9, still plays with ice in the tub.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fun to make rings (like in tube pans or jello molds), or to fill small <br/>
balloons and freeze them so there&#39;s a ball-shaped piece of ice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-821531675">Thanks for all the suggestions. . .what I was looking for were ones that <br/>
Bryan and I could use. . . I certainly am not looking to change my son&#39;s <br/>
behavior. I understand what he is doing is perfectly normal. I am so glad I <br/>
asked for suggestions when I did because the whole thing came to a head last <br/>
night, with my husband yelling that Quinton was deliberately baiting him,. <br/>
etc etc. Anyway, the fact that I had the suggestions I did about seeing <br/>
things in a different way helped out in the end. I think that Bryan was not <br/>
just not fully present with Quinton, and he was doing everything he could to <br/>
get his attention. He was not doing these things with me so much as with <br/>
Bryan. I think it was pushing some serious buttons with Bryan about a variety <br/>
of things, many from his own past. Hopefully, we all learned something. But <br/>
it turns out I had the needed words to help out thanks to some of you and I <br/>
appreciate it. Once again, my children have held up a mirror and helped us to <br/>
learn a little something.<br/>
