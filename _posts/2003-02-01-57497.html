<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, Dawna, how about:<br/>
<br/>
No structure, all fun.  You don&#39;t have to make learning fun, learning IS<br/>
fun.  If you had the flu for 2 days and lay on the sofa just watching them,<br/>
they would still learn.  They&#39;ve learned how to walk and talk.  You didn&#39;t<br/>
sit down and try to teach them that, did you?  I sure hope not!  But you did<br/>
cheer their efforts, and talk with them and around them.<br/>
<br/>
Forget structure when they reach 6 or 7.  Forget structure forever.  You&#39;ll<br/>
do different things at 6 or 7, different than at 4, different than at 16.<br/>
But you don&#39;t need structure to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Think about the things you enjoy doing, and how you&#39;d like your friends to<br/>
encourage you to try their favorite things.  You might like them to point<br/>
out that they saw a lecture at the public library on Peace in the Middle<br/>
East, if they knew you were interested in that sort of thing.  You<br/>
definitely would NOT want them to sign you up and make you go to it.<br/>
<br/>
And if your best friend loves art, maybe she&#39;d try to get you to accompany<br/>
her to the opening of a new show at her favorite gallery.  But she wouldn&#39;t<br/>
announce that you had to come, like it or not, because it&#39;s good for you.<br/>
<br/>
Treat your kids with the same respect.  If they&#39;re interested in bugs, help<br/>
them find books at the library that might interest them, and offer to read<br/>
them if they&#39;re in the mood.  Leave them lying around where they can flip<br/>
through and look at the pictures.  Find a time when they would like to go<br/>
outside and bring a shovel to turn over dirt, move rocks, and bug hunt.<br/>
Suggest that you know how to make a bug house out of tuna cans and wire if<br/>
anybody would like to make one.  Be prepared to take no for an answer.<br/>
<br/>
Show your children the things you&#39;re interested it.  Take them to the zoo if<br/>
you love looking at the animals, not because zoos are good for them.  Play<br/>
your favorite music and dance around to it.  Bet they&#39;ll join you.  Get out<br/>
the craft supplies and start making things.  Maybe they&#39;ll join you.  Maybe<br/>
they won&#39;t.  Either way, you&#39;ll have fun because you&#39;d be doing things YOU<br/>
enjoy.  <br/>
<br/>
My son reads quite well.  Some days he chooses to read an entire book.  Some<br/>
days he only reads things he needs to read -- like street signs.  By giving<br/>
him the freedom to choose to read, and to choose what to read, he<br/>
voluntarily reads many things.  But if I required that he read a book a day<br/>
or a chapter a day, reading would be like chores are for many kids.  Just<br/>
another thing to check off the list.  He wouldn&#39;t see books the same way.<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like it may be a major paradigm shift from where you are.<br/>
Please ask more questions if it doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>

learning&quot;.  Don&#39;t do that.  Just live your life and help them live theirs at <br/>
whatever age they are at.  They will learn.  You can&#39;t make them learn and <br/>
you can&#39;t stop them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What you need to do depends what state you&#39;re in, but there are unschoolers<br/>
in every state so none of them require structure. Sometimes the laws read as<br/>
though structure were required but it isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
A good place for laws is National Home Education Network.<br/>
