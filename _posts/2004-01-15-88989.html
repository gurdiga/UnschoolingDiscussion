I have had to reread this a few times and just sit here awed. I have been <br/>
doing a lot of this all along but could never pin point it, label it I guess. I <br/>
mean the learning without reading part. It just makes so much sense, why in the <br/>
world can&#39;t more people see it? <br/>
<br/>
Reading is a tool for learning but it&#39;s not all of learning. My younger son <br/>
does not care to read a lot now though he can. For the last 2 years we have <br/>
been listening to books on tape everywhere we go. We went from &quot;How to Eat Fried <br/>
worms&quot; to The Lord of the Rings Trilogy&quot; to &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; and back. We <br/>
listen to kids books and adult books and we talk, we talk about the story, the <br/>
words (what are galoshes?), of the hardships (take a trip and build your own <br/>
canoe along the way!!) and even sex Ed (venereal disease was rampant among <br/>
Lewis and Clarks men).<br/>
<br/>
I once asked someone if they thought blind people are still able to learn? <br/>
(Braille aside) (This was to illustrate my point)<br/>
<br/>
I love when something I read goes click, click, click in my head. Sandra this <br/>
article just put so much right in my head, thanks!<br/>

Thanks for the positive feedback, Laura.<br/>
<br/>
I found a little error in there and have repaired it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In school it can be hard to learn without reading, or at least hard to do <br/>
the worksheets and answer the questions at the ends of the chapters.  Reading is <br/>
not such a separate thing at school. &lt;p&gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It used to say &quot;Learning is not such a separate thing...&quot; but that was  <br/>
finger-glitch, brain-burp. Should&#39;ve said &quot;Reading,&quot; I think.  If I remember why I <br/>
might&#39;ve meant &quot;Learning,&quot; I might change it back. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
