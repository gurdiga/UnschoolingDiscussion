<div id="ygrps-yiv-631499375">Just a thought:  maybe we women shouldn&#39;t be doing the things we have<br/>
complained about men doing for years? We have fought against sexual<br/>
stereotyping, sexist jokes etc for decades (well, some of us oldies have &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
and now, somehow, it&#39;s seems like it&#39;s insensitive for men to tell anti-women<br/>
jokes, but okay for women to tell anti-men jokes.<br/>
<br/>
Trouble is, my first reaction was to laugh! Hmmmm. So much for ideals :-(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-73046894">Just for the record, there is more than &#39;one&#39; who thought the posting<br/>
&quot;Definitions&quot; was inappropriate for this egroup. I am another and what<br/>
you consider a juvenile response is no more juvenile than the posting it<br/>
is responding to. <br/>
<br/>
The fact that what you consider the originator of the &#39;story&#39;  a &quot;..real<br/>
MAN who is a rancher in Texas who rides Harleys..&quot; hardly matters. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve managed to cram a lot of stereotypical nonsense into two<br/>
postings.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178244558">Look, there is a still sick bit inside me that sometimes laughs at *some* sexist<br/>
or racist or blonde or whatever jokes. But that doesn&#39;t mean I approve of that. I<br/>
see it as a sad part of me that needs working on. I could send in jokes that put<br/>
down women, or Americans, or Poms (does that word make you cringe slightly, Dawn?<br/>
- it would if you lived in NZ) - we have plenty of all of these circulating in NZ<br/>
- or put down christians, buddhists or atheists, but the fact that I send them<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean it is right to do so. I value the input of the men on this list as<br/>
much as I do that of the women. David Albert in particular has been an inspiration<br/>
to me - and after 14 years of homeschooling experience of my own, there aren&#39;t an<br/>
awful lot of people that inspire me.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Charles didn&#39;t say &#39;general chit chat&#39;, he said &#39;general chat list&#39;, which<br/>
to my way of thinking has quite a different meaning to it.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that someone has objected to sexist jokes. I know this is an<br/>
unmoderated list, but can&#39;t we just accept Charles&#39; objection and let it lie? Or<br/>
are we going to make the list open slather for every kind of &#39;ist&#39; joke around?<br/>
