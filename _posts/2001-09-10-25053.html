<div id="ygrps-yiv-86267328">&lt;&lt;you are likening any form of structure in education...to Satan&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you really this thick or do you just like to argue?<br/>
<br/>
Structure in education is the antithesis of unschooling.  Shrines to Satan<br/>
are the antithesis of Christianity.  And no, nobody called you a devil<br/>
worshipper.<br/>
