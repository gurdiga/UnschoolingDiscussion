<div id="ygrps-yiv-340652872">I just sat down at the computer after some cleaning and talking and <br/>
cooking and talking and eating and talking and more talking and a <br/>
couple of rounds of hide and go seek ( I&#39;m just &quot;base&quot; and &quot;counting <br/>
helper&quot;.... trying desperately to finish a book, I&#39;ve been trying to <br/>
read all summer, during the searching times)<br/>
My 3yo is in a pink boa and nothing else, my 5yo Jack <br/>
a.k.a &quot;underwear boy&quot; is in typical attire, my 8 yo ds is literally <br/>
bouncing of the walls and my almost twleve yo dd is dressed like a <br/>
prostitute, but in the game they are playing, she is the &quot;evil <br/>
princess&quot;.<br/>
I just turned around when some screaming kids whirred by, and <br/>
yelled &quot;ANYONE CRIES, AND EVERYONE IS IN BED!&quot; which was completely <br/>
ignored.  No cries yet though!<br/>
They have so much fun together, and at times like these(daily) I feel <br/>
torn between feeling extremely blessed and extremely on edge, waiting <br/>
for it to go too far and it end in some trauma.<br/>
My 5yo does an awesome english accent thanks to Harry Potter.  It&#39;s <br/>
really cute with his little lisp.<br/>
My 3yo yells &quot; Oooooh, BOYS&quot; to her older brothers,with a little bit <br/>
of a southern drawl that I have no idea where it comes from.  She&#39;s <br/>
got them wrapped around her finger though.<br/>
The older 2 are planning and directing and living in some sort of <br/>
fantasy world with their siblings and being really nice right now.<br/>
i hope the evil queen doesn&#39;t get too evil or I have to turn <br/>
into &quot;mean mommy&quot; and end it before they are saying they hate each <br/>
other.  <br/>
i could join the game and remove the chance of anger between them, <br/>
but when I do that, I know i take a little of the magic away.<br/>
I really like to listen.<br/>
Does anyone know a good time to step in or a good way to redirect, <br/>
before it ends in &quot;HE HIT ME!!!&quot;  &quot;SHE CALLED ME STUPID!!!&quot;.<br/>
Tonight seems to be going well.<br/>
If I suggested a book or a game right now, they would turn me down <br/>
because they are in the midst of their fun.  <br/>
i need to figure out that magic time right before the fun stops and <br/>
fights start.<br/>
Or maybe the fighting is part of the fun....<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would also like to know the answer to that!  And then what do you <br/>
do when it happens and they&#39;re all crying and screaming and looking <br/>
at you to fix everything.  &quot;He hit me with his train&quot;.  &quot;But that&#39;s <br/>
only because he took my track away&quot;.  &quot;I only took his track away <br/>
because she called me a name&quot;.  &quot;I did not call him a name!&quot;  And <br/>
then they start attacking each other again before your head even <br/>
starts spinning.  <br/>
<br/>
I probably didn&#39;t handle it very well tonight.  They all came at me <br/>
with all the terrible things that were done to each of them, <br/>
screaming and crying and hitting and kicking and I said &quot;WAIT!&quot;  <br/>
Raise your hand if I called one of you a name tonight.  No one raised <br/>
their hand except my 3 year old who heard &quot;Raise your hand&quot; and <br/>
nothing else! lol They giggled a little when he did that.  Then I <br/>
said, &quot;Raise your hand if I hit, kicked, or pinched one of you <br/>
tonight&quot;.  Again the three year old raises his hands and the other <br/>
two start laughing harder.  Then I say, &quot;And raise your hand if I <br/>
threw a train at you tonight&quot;.  Again, the three year old raises his <br/>
hand.  Now they&#39;re really laughing hard.  And I said (in an <br/>
exaggerated dramatic voice) &quot;If I didn&#39;t hit, kick, pinch, call you a <br/>
name, or throw a train at you, why are you in here yelling at me <br/>
about being hit, kicked, pinched, called names, and having trains <br/>
thrown at you?&quot;  And they all started laughing hard (tension <br/>
relieved).  But I swear within 2 minutes they were at it again.  Sigh.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916554431">I&#39;ve been lurking here for about a week, trying to acquaint myself with the <br/>
list amidst all this Ned business.  Just wanted to say that I&#39;ve spent a fair <br/>
amount of time as &quot;base&quot; and that I have my own 5 year old &quot;captain <br/>
underpants&quot;.  I don&#39;t know the answer to Joanna&#39;s question about when to step <br/>
in, but that&#39;s the kind of question, on all kinds of levels, I&#39;ve come here <br/>
seeking.<br/>
