<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431511764">-=- I am not sure if unschooling in itself is extreme. I think it is a <br/>
<br/>
bad idea to not be willing to introduce knowledge to a child, as we <br/>
<br/>
have been doing it for a very long time, far longer then we have had <br/>
<br/>
schools. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
And before there were schools, that knowledge was not presented in schoolish <br/>
ways.<br/>
And it doesn&#39;t have to be.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure where you got the idea that unschoolers don&#39;t &quot;introduce <br/>
knowledge&quot; to their children.  I can&#39;t see in your head, so I don&#39;t know how <br/>
schoolish your introduction to knowledge ideas are.  <br/>
<br/>
-=- I think it is a negative thing for a parent to not present a child <br/>
<br/>
with what they think they should know. Like manners, and morals.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well I agree with you totally.<br/>
And I have no idea why you made the assumption that our children are kept <br/>
clueless about manners and morals.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s interesting to me that your example includes morals.<br/>
Morality is VERY important in our family.<br/>
<br/>
-=-At 4 <br/>
<br/>
years old I can and feel I should teach my daughter these things. <br/>
<br/>
Along with how to clean her room, not to run in the road and why. I <br/>
<br/>
take the time to teach her things I know. Sometimes she is <br/>
<br/>
interested, sometimes not.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s not interested your &quot;teaching&quot; is song and dance without an <br/>
audience.  But when she IS interested, her learning will astound you.  If you stop <br/>
trying to teach and look for her desire to learn, you&#39;ll move a step toward <br/>
helping HER live a life of learning.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
But it&#39;s interesting to me that your example includes morals.<br/>
Morality is VERY important in our family.<br/>
<br/>
Morality is so important to me that I would not lie to get my child into <br/>
college.  I&#39;ve never lied on a resume, and I won&#39;t start now.   <br/>
<br/>
It is possible to get kids into college without a transcript.  I did it for <br/>
my sister in the early 70&#39;s.  I was a teenager.  If a teenager can figure out <br/>
how to do it for another teenager without compromising morals or integrity, <br/>
certainly a grown mother who has been consciously unschooling her child for years <br/>
can figure out how to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m repeating myself, but a &quot;transcript&quot; doesn&#39;t have to look like a <br/>
school transcript, and if unschoolers make a transcript that DOES look just <br/>
like a school transcript (with numbers of credits and letter grades) they&#39;re not <br/>
presenting their children with manners and morals to  MY standards.  My <br/>
integrity doesn&#39;t stretch far enough to falsify records.  If yours does, that&#39;s your <br/>
personal concern.  <br/>
<br/>
Part of the reason my children respect my opinion is they know I&#39;m honest.  <br/>
It&#39;s very important to me to maintain that integrity throughout their lives, <br/>
not just until I decide to lie about our whole lives to that point to get them <br/>
into school.<br/>
<br/>
If you think a high school transcript is a necessity (for your four year old <br/>
daughter) then by all means, plan to send her to high school!  They give <br/>
transcripts out free.    Or sign up to use a curriculum by mail, or an online high <br/>
school course, or some means by which an accredited educational establishment <br/>
will give her a legitimate transcript.   <br/>
<br/>
Nobody&#39;s telling you you have to unschool.  Nobody&#39;s telling you you have to <br/>
be honest.<br/>
<br/>
What people are trying to discuss here is the connection between the way one <br/>
lives one&#39;s life and the ramifications of falsifying records (ESPECIALLY when <br/>
there is no need to falsify records whatsoever, because several alternatives <br/>
have been presented).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=- I am not talking about testing a child, I am talking about testing a <br/>
<br/>
young adult getting ready to go out into the world. Like age 16ish!-=--<br/>
<br/>
I believe you were suggesting earlier that testing children wouldn&#39;t hurt at <br/>
all, because they would need to learn good test-taking skills.     By 16 if <br/>
they&#39;re ready to take ACT or SAT or A levels or whatever, then that is NOT the <br/>
kind of test people here are objecting to.  People here tend to avoid the Iowa <br/>
Test of Basic Skills being administered to their children every year or few, <br/>
and the child being branded slow or gifted or average.  None of those labels <br/>
has ever helped a child learn.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I am one of those people that can say I shall do something and more <br/>
<br/>
then likely I will do it. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Shall&quot; is just too strong a word.  Think about what it means.   Not &quot;maybe&quot; <br/>
and not &quot;probably.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Had you said &quot;I will probably...&quot; then your statement would&#39;ve been hunky <br/>
dory, but if  say that when my daughter gets married I shall wear blue and sit in <br/>
the front pew with a flower in my hair,  I&#39;m saying more than I have any <br/>
business saying.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t know, today, that your daughter will ever want to go to college.<br/>
You don&#39;t know, today, that your daughter will be alive in twelve years.<br/>
Perhaps the best thing you can do, today, is help her have a really great <br/>
April 18, 2004.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Goodness, did I say they are stupid? I do not think so, I think the <br/>
<br/>
desition to not help their child get into a college that demands <br/>
<br/>
transcrips because it would be in thier eyes lieing, mine changing, <br/>
<br/>
that it would be stupid.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You did say stupid.  Right in writing, right in public.<br/>
Nobody forced you to write, and nobody forced you to hit &quot;send,&quot; so take <br/>
responsibility for what you say in public.  People ARE reading, so if you don&#39;t <br/>
mean what you write, please don&#39;t write.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Picture me saying that I think it is <br/>
<br/>
better to change when needed a little then to fight the system that <br/>
<br/>
shall not change for you but could very well make your child very <br/>
<br/>
happy. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You said &quot;shall&quot; again.  Now you&#39;re guaranteeing the behavior of something <br/>
completely outside yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the acceptable uses of shall:  Of oneself (but it&#39;s a kind of <br/>
guarantee of future behavior, so use it sparingly) or of others IF the speaker is in <br/>
a position to make it so.  A judge or a king declaring that somenoe shall be <br/>
imprisoned or shall be hanged.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise &quot;shall&quot; is too strong.  The system has changed more than it has <br/>
ever stayed the same.  And since people here have shown and accounted and linked <br/>
to evidence that it IS possible to get into college without transcripts, your <br/>
&quot;shall not change&quot; is false and wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If my child&#39;s happiness depended on my dishonesty, their world would not be <br/>
the open, honest place it is today.<br/>
<br/>
Their happiness thusfar has benefitted from my honesty, and I question your <br/>
motives in counselling people to turn from honesty to sneakiness.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Since when is life about being happy? Life is not about being happy, <br/>
<br/>
not that I have ever learned.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well....<br/>
Our house is happy.<br/>
My kids are happy,  I&#39;m happy.<br/>
<br/>
You think children could be happier if moms falsify transcripts, yet you <br/>
don&#39;t think life is about being happy, maybe you should spend smoe more time <br/>
thinking about what you really believe about life and happiness.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Life is about being useful, about being <br/>
<br/>
a good person, about makeing life woth something. Happy comes with <br/>
<br/>
being useful.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My children are good, useful people whose lives are worth more than most <br/>
kids&#39; lives because they are living examples of happy goodness.  Honestly, they <br/>
knew years ago they were poster children for unschooling, and they&#39;re such good <br/>
sports about it.  I&#39;m relieved.  They could&#39;ve said, &quot;Stop talking about this <br/>
so much,&quot; but they themselves will sometimes say &quot;You should tell the list <br/>
about this&quot; if something cool  happens at our house.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My child is so happy to help, she does not see work as <br/>
<br/>
something negative or as something she must do before she can have fun.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Mine too, but in their case work is NOT something they must do before they <br/>
can have fun.<br/>
I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s different at your house because you wrote the statement <br/>
above and I could never have conjured a statement like that from the patterns at <br/>
our house.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Work, learning, playing, are all part of her learning and to her, all <br/>
fun! -=-<br/>
<br/>
My house too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-That in itself helps me think we are doing something right. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Good.  I bet you&#39;re doing lots of things right. <br/>
Your recommendations on this list weren&#39;t on your glorious-right list, <br/>
though.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I think about happiness if you get any more reading-energy later:<br/>

It&#39;s &quot;Rejecting a Pre-Packaged Life,&quot; an article I wrote when my kids were <br/>
young.<br/>
They&#39;re 12, 15 and 17 now.<br/>
I don&#39;t feel less strongly about my decisions now, but more.<br/>
<br/>
And I think life is about happiness, when you can manage well.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Since when is life about being happy? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Happy lives are about happiness.<br/>
I&#39;m sorry yours isn&#39;t happier, but we could help you with ideas to tweak it a <br/>
bit if you want.<br/>
