<div>We are in NE OH. Our hs coop involves around 20 families right now--last 
time there were about 10-12. Most classes are facilitated by parents who want to 
share and explore a passion. Some are taught by kids. We are not a legal entity, 
although since we use a church, we do sign a liability waiver.&nbsp; Classes 
include watercolor, cool art stuff, Spanish, German, chemistry, creative 
writing, theater for kids, swing/ballroom dance, baseball skills, ancient 
history (Greek), human body, games, young scientists (for the littles).</div>
<div>&nbsp;It&#39;s about as much structure as I can handle...</div>
