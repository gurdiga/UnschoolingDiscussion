<div id="ygrps-yiv-271531218">Just thought I&#39;d update you all cos I&#39;m bored.<br/>
We&#39;re nearly gone. Only another 7 days and we fly next Tuesday :-)<br/>
Unfortunately hubby wont be coming with us as his security clearance<br/>
for the new job hasn&#39;t come through yet. Hopefully it should be<br/>
through by the beginning of Feb. Fingers crossed as the baby is due<br/>
mid-February! I really don&#39;t want to be in labour without a man to<br/>
blame ;-)<br/>
<br/>
the kids are a bit sad that we&#39;ll be spending Xmas without daddy but<br/>
luckily we&#39;re staying with friends so we wont be sat in an empty house<br/>
for too long. Poor hubby will be all alone Xmas and New Year. In<br/>
Virginia. Billy-No-Mates ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The baby is a girl! Heather is very excited as she wants a baby sister<br/>
- Robin, she&#39;s ordered one like Jayne. Once we get back home I&#39;ll have<br/>
to think about baby things. Bought nothing so far. And names! I can&#39;t<br/>
even think of one!<br/>
<br/>
Right, now you&#39;re all bored rigid I&#39;ll push off :-)<br/>

I&#39;m sorry your husband won&#39;t be there so soon, but I hope he&#39;s there before <br/>
you&#39;re in labor for sure.  I had Holly in the absence of Keith (who was snowed <br/>

Annie Mae  (my grandmother, and Holly named her doll that while muttering <br/>

<br/>
Martha is hardly used anymore.  It could be your Virginia baby-name, for <br/>
Martha Washington.  My best friend when I was 9, 10, 11 was Martha Yordy.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe when you see her you&#39;ll know her name and you don&#39;t need one in <br/>
advance.  I hope the flight goes okay for you, and the rest of the pregnancy is <br/>
tolerable.   Ask them for a seat belt extension!<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so happy to hear from you. What a shame about dh being stuck alone. <br/>
<br/>
We chose Jayn&#39;s name a week before she was born, when a nurse made a chance<br/>
remark about James&#39; name. We decided Ja for Ja-mes and yn for Rob-yn. We<br/>
chose Holly because we like it and so that she would have the same initials<br/>
as my dh James Harrison Coburn IV - since it is increasingly unlikely that<br/>
there will ever be a fifth. There has been a tradition in my family of the<br/>
middle name being Louise, but for some reason we just couldn&#39;t find a first<br/>
name we liked to go with it. My mother didn&#39;t mind. I have since thought<br/>
that if I had another girl I would like her to be Rose Louise - the same<br/>
initials as me.<br/>
<br/>
Hope all goes well with your flight, and much love Heather.<br/>

<br/>
Is that a real item? Never herd of it.<br/>
<br/>
I love baby conversations and names.  Every time we have a baby I go though <br/>
the three namer books I have. Takes me months! I normally make a list and then <br/>
when I have had enough I begin suggesting to my husband.  We end up choosing a <br/>
letter for a beginning name and we start there.  Our girl name took the <br/>
longest, Cassidy is what we named her.<br/>
For Nicholas we pulled Cassidy&#39;s middle name Nichole.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry that you will be alone for Christmas.  I wish I could think of <br/>
something brilliant to say but this email has been sitting in my face for a couple <br/>
hours and Im brain dead.  Wishing you and your family the best.  I&#39;ll be thinking <br/>
of you this Christmas, maybe even here typing if I know me. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

&gt; Robyn L. Coburn<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No,  these aren&#39;t planned punishments... we don&#39;t use punishments per <br/>
say... someone asked what would happen if I found one of my children <br/>
was having sex and that was my response. And that would probably be <br/>
what I would do, I&#39;m not really sure. Yes, sex is dangerous ... as a <br/>
matter of fact, when I donated blood two weeks ago they asked me all <br/>
sorts of questions about my sex life - one episode of sex in certain <br/>
circumstances makes my blood unsafe to donate. It can put me at risk <br/>
for serious life threatening diseases, which can spread through the <br/>
donation of blood. My dear friend who had sex three times ended up <br/>
with a lifetime of STD problems. <br/>
<br/>
I have to admit that we are a family who has instilled these morals <br/>
in our children to the best of our ability - through example and <br/>
education, not coercion. They are free to learn about what the &quot;other <br/>
side&quot; teaches as well and come to their own decisions. For the most <br/>
part they have agreed with us - we do not coerce nor threaten nor <br/>
bribe. My one reaction to the question was in earnest... I don&#39;t know <br/>
what I&#39;d do if I found one of my kids having sex, but it would be <br/>
similar to what I&#39;d do if I found one playing Russian Roulette. I <br/>
would do everything in my power to stop it, because I feel that <br/>
strongly that sex can be dangerous, especially for vulnerable <br/>
teenagers. Of course it&#39;s dangerous for adults too, but that&#39;s why I <br/>
believe in and practice monogamy.<br/>
<br/>
We are unschoolers. We have never &quot;required&quot; anything (except respect <br/>
for each other!) We don&#39;t have curricula or schedules ... our kids <br/>
choose all their own learning methods and subjects and tools. I have <br/>
always been a believer in real life learning. 17 years ago when I <br/>
started, I tried a curriculum - that lasted about a half a day.<br/>
<br/>
We do go to church, and the kids are free to come or not, as they <br/>
choose. Until the oldest turned 19, he chose to come. At 19 he chose <br/>
to not come. That&#39;s his choice and there were no &quot;parent imposed&quot; <br/>
consequences. Soon after he moved out, into an apt, and within two <br/>
years graduated with a degree in INM and has a fabulous job in <br/>
Phoenix.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe with sex I feel more stongly and impose a little more of my <br/>
beliefs, but I can&#39;t not do something I feel that strongly about. I <br/>
don&#39;t think minors should be having sex. (A lot of adults probably <br/>
shouldn&#39;t either!) But once the kids are &quot;of age&quot; it&#39;s their choice. <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t let a child beat up a sibling either. Or break windows... <br/>
I dunno, maybe because I have this &quot;hangup&quot; about sex being sacred <br/>
I&#39;m not really an unshcooler. But I doubt it. <br/>
<br/>
And I think respect means respecting oneself also.<br/>

   I think you should *not* let it get to you; why let smthg like <br/>
that ruin a perfectly good name for you? If you do, then you&#39;re <br/>

I wasn&#39;t doubting that they caught something from having sex only three <br/>
times.  I was rather tongue in check thinking &quot;wow&quot; only had sex three times in <br/>

not...<br/>

That reminds me of &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;, when the Protestant husband was<br/>
informing his wife that their Catholic neighbors were not supposed to use<br/>
contraception, in order to beget a child with every intercourse. Then his<br/>
wife says, &quot;But we have two children&quot;.<br/>

you&#39;re good at being with things until they reveal their names to you?<br/>

the meantime? When I was PG w/#2, #1 wanted to name the baby. She <br/>
had a whole lineup of original names: stupid train, stupid <br/>
lightpost, stupid ___ (fill in the blank with any non-sentient <br/>
object). I nixed them all. Finally, she offered &quot;Shoo lie lou,&quot; from <br/>
a song. We agreed to call #2 that until birth, when we&#39;d see who it <br/>
was, and then decide on a permanent name. Funny: after the birth, <br/>
the midwife was filling out the birth record papers and asked how we <br/>
spelled shoo lie lou. She thought that&#39;s what we were calling the <br/>
baby for real! Said she&#39;d heard plenty more unusual. :-)<br/>
