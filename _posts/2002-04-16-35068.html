<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446278619">Here&#39;s what an unschooling moment at my house looked like this morning.<br/>
<br/>
At 10:40, my son came by and asked me what 20 times 60 was.  (He wanted to know how many seconds it was<br/>
until 11am.)<br/>
<br/>
I took a minute to understand what he wanted and figure out whether I was jumbling the units.  I gave him the answer.  (I didn&#39;t think he really wanted me to explain the &quot;unit analysis&quot; part.  I&#39;ll save that for another day.)<br/>
<br/>
Then he got playful and said &quot;I wonder what the math after the aftermath is?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When he did this, he was undressed and batting a balloon down the hall.  I figure this is worth extra unschooling &quot;style&quot; points &#39;cause it included (a) freedom of expression in clothing, (b) whimsical kinesthetic stuff, and (c) word play.  (My favorite!)<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine him in a classroom!  And if he had to wear a uniform and put the balloon down, and answer questions instead of asking them, I&#39;m sure he wouldn&#39;t want to go.<br/>
