<div id="ygrps-yiv-659556274">thanks Julie, it&#39;s nice of you to remember me ...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been keeping up w/ all the posts but I&#39;ve been SUPER BUSY getting ready<br/>
for our 1st grandbaby (NO, I&#39;m NOT THAT OLD, ha, @ least I keep telling<br/>
myself that, ha) ... dd will be induced on Sept 14th if she doesn&#39;t have the<br/>
baby sooner ...  by that date, she&#39;ll be 41 wks and her dr wants to get<br/>
things rolling (which I&#39;m NOT happy about but whattdoIknowI&#39;mjustGramby!!!)<br/>
... bless her heart, my poor dd is just MISERABLE in the Dallas heat (109*<br/>
yesterday!!!) BLAH :P<br/>
<br/>
dh, dss and I will be present @ the *big event* and I&#39;m SO EXCITED!!!<br/>
wellllll, let me rephrase that statement, my fellas won&#39;t actually be *w/*<br/>
dd but Gramby WILL, I can&#39;t wait!!!   she started to have home birth but<br/>
complications won&#39;t allow; I keep telling her the goal is healthy<br/>
baby/mommie ... dh will be on vacation from mid-Sept-mid-Oct, so we&#39;ll be<br/>
free to enjoy the next few wks *playing* w/ little Kinsey Mc Lane or Samuel<br/>
Alexander &lt;VBG&gt; ... I&#39;ll have more time to participate when we return and<br/>
life gets back to *normal*, whatever that means, lol :)<br/>
<br/>
Pris ~&gt; WARNING: I cannot be help responsible for the above, as apparently<br/>
my cats have learned how to type ...<br/>
