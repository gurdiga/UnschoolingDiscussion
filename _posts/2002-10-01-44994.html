&lt;&lt; Sandra, I&#39;m not trying to be a bitch or anything but I was reading the <br/>
unschooling boards and read about the boy who wouldn&#39;t shower.  You suggested <br/>
to pay him a dollar.  I don&#39;t understand the difference between the two? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am writing this without reading any other responses, so I hope it hasn&#39;t <br/>
already been said.<br/>
I see it this way.<br/>
The not showering is only annoying to those around the teen. Not dangerous, <br/>
not psychologically harmful, only annoying because of smell issues.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t truly hurt the teen to not shower either. So you&#39;re paying him for <br/>
the convenience of not having to smell some stink. It&#39;s not a reward, it&#39;s <br/>
simply telling him that you are willing to pay for a convenience which is not <br/>
absolutely necessary.<br/>
On the other hand, hitting is harmful.<br/>
It&#39;s emotionally and physically damaging. There is a motivating factor behind <br/>
the hitting which indicates a lack of self control....normal for certain <br/>
ages, but not something you can let go.<br/>
It&#39;s not about paying for a convenience....it&#39;s about safety, and nurture and <br/>
behavioral urges. It&#39;s about allowing abuse to take place. And a child must <br/>
learn self control at some point or else you have an abusive adult harming <br/>
other humans.<br/>
I believe self control grows on it&#39;s own to some degree. But in the mean time <br/>
there is a lot a parent can do to protect the weaker one and give the <br/>
agressor more tools to use.<br/>
It is our job to help them get more tools.<br/>
You don&#39;t give them tools by controlling them. You don&#39;t help them understand <br/>
their own motivations or be self analytical by rewarding and controlling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-546022559">Just wanted to adress this last sentence - in my son&#39;s case, his motivation is to purposely hurt someone else. He knows and understands that is wrong, but does not care. What we do with the hearts is not a reward so much as a reminder. It&#39;s not money he can spend on anything, he doesn&#39;t get special things he can&#39;t get any other way with it. The hearts serve as a reminder to be loving and gentle, and he can trade them in to do activities like getting a special color bath that night or staying up 15 minutes past his bedtime or checking out an extra book on library day. Nothing big, nothing worth very much, but just enough to remind him that he did a good job that day. <br/>

motivation is to purposely hurt someone else. He knows and understands that <br/>
is wrong, but does not care. What we do with the hearts is not a reward so <br/>

<br/>
Okay I&#39;m just talking out loud here. It seems that so far, the things you <br/>
are giving you son with the heart is something big and worth something to <br/>
him. He obviously enjoys what these things are or what he gets to do. So <br/>
maybe you see it as not worth much but he sees it differently. Wonder if he <br/>
wasn&#39;t harmful, then he couldn&#39;t get the chance to be &#39;good&#39; and have his <br/>
rewards. So to get the rewards, he has to show the other side too or else <br/>
the rewards would eventually stop. Have you tried to give him a color bath <br/>
when he wants and let him stay up late when he wants and check out an extra <br/>
book when he wants.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I can&#39;t imagine with holding those things from a child if thats <br/>
what they want. Big deal to a kid but not to a parent. Just throwing out <br/>
ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112271415">No, the things he uses the hearts for can be had any time, just by him asking for them. Except for the extra library book - DH has a limit of 20 books a week for him, so it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a big difference between 20 and 21 books. <br/>
<br/>
We do not use the heart system when we&#39;re not at home, so he has plenty of chances to act right without the &quot;reward&quot; of getting hearts. However, he does not do so unless we are somewhere that keeps him very busy and interested. If he goes to my parents house, for example, he ends up having to sit alone in a room or still on the couch because he just goes wild and will/can not calm down on his own. <br/>
<br/>
The hearts give him a tangible reminder of loving, soft feelings plus are a reminder that nice, sweet behavior is better than hurtful behavior.  They have made such a huge difference here, he is so much happier and his little brother is not constantly crying from being hurt. <br/>

reward to train him to do the right thing. If he doesn&#39;t care about the<br/>
shower (or the lawn ;-) then it makes sense pay him to do something for the<br/>
mom that she wants done.<br/>
<br/>
But, as Sandra said, it was just one of a bunch of ideas.<br/>
