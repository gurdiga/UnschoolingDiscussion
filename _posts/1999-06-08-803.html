<div id="ygrps-yiv-582215062">For those of you who have kids who &quot;play&quot; on the computer (although mine did<br/>
not until I got this)...<br/>
There is a company (actually there&#39;s a few of them, this is just the one I have)<br/>
that makes educational CD Roms.<br/>
The one we have is JumpStart 1st Grade.<br/>
But there is a whole JumpStart Learning System.<br/>
You can pick them up at your local computer store or go to :<br/>

For the direct route:<br/>

I just had to mention that my niece (the one who is reading books now at<br/>
age three) has done the jumpstart series through Kindergarten (Toddler,<br/>
Pre-K and K.)  They are a &quot;toy&quot; for her and her parents have to limit her<br/>
computer time or she would be on all day.  She gets grounded from the<br/>
computer when she is really naughty.  Anyway she just LOVES them, and she<br/>
was a whiz with the computer (particularly with the mouse) by age 2.  I am<br/>
going to get them for my guys soon, as they are having trouble staying away<br/>
from this machine!<br/>
