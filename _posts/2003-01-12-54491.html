maybe some of you who have some extra time cold go to this page and see if <br/>
you know of good things to add, or see if you find outdated or non-working <br/>
things, or other errors or ideas for improvements.  Maybe you&#39;ll find <br/>
something you needed to know!  OR maybe, since synchronicity has already come <br/>
up once this morning, you&#39;ll find something someone else will need to know <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927344942">Hey Sandra, there are some cool sites here.  I checked them all out and<br/>
found the following:<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;review&quot; link after the &quot;Inspirit&quot; link, has a page not found message,<br/>
but says to try &quot;eho.org&quot; which is the next link you mention.<br/>
<br/>
Under contacts for UK and Europe, the specifically &quot;Europe&quot; link is not<br/>
found.<br/>
And &quot;Choice in Education&quot; has a page cannot be displayed message.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Scout School&quot; has moved.  Both &quot;Scout School&quot; and &quot;Campfire&quot; are at the<br/>
same site, now.<br/>
<br/>
HTH,<br/>
