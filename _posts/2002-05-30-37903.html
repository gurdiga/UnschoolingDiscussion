<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415424656">We went to a Pick Your Own berry patch this morning.  I have never in my<br/>
life been berry picking and we had such a ball.  The warm early morning<br/>
sunshine, feeling the mud on your feet from last night&#39;s rain, the kids<br/>
giggling and running around, the black and red berries and the juice on your<br/>
fingers when you pull too hard, Danny eating handful after handful, funny<br/>
faces when the kids would get a sour one.<br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful morning.<br/>
<br/>
Julie---with many pies to make  :)</div>

Aaaah, thanks for the warm, fuzzy memories of Oregon.<br/>
I have GOT to go berry picking soon. I can still see my little three y.o. <br/>
Trevor, just done picking Strawberries, sitting on the kitchen counter with <br/>
juice and dirt all running down his chin and a big, goofy smile on his face.  <br/>
Sigh....<br/>
