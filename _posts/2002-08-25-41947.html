Ned, you&#39;ve quoted me, but it&#39;s not about me.  I was answering a question.  <br/>
You could have answered the poster&#39;s question too!  And perhaps you have, by <br/>
saying &quot;tell them the truth.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know (AND YOU KNOW) that I recommended that clearly.<br/>
Then I went on to make humorous and facetious suggestions in case the family <br/>
wasn&#39;t confident enough to say &quot;Back Off&quot; to the schools.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are braver than others.<br/>
Some are more able to tell the plain truth than others.<br/>
