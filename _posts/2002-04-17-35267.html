<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729679667">I have a question regarding the kids taking classes at JC..<br/>
<br/>
I havent done much research yet, what I&#39;m interested in is anyone with personal knowledge, preferably in California..<br/>
<br/>
Do you know what age they would have to be to take classes, and any other info on this, mine range from 12 to 14 all just about to move up to the next age...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
Kate<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312736262">Every one is different in CA.  I worked at SRJC in Sonoma County.  They<br/>
didn&#39;t have a minimum age.  Up here at CR they don&#39;t allow anyone under the<br/>
age of 16.<br/>
<br/>
However, they also have non-credit classes that have different rules and<br/>
regs than the credit classes have and the ages are set by the instructors in<br/>
those classes.<br/>
<br/>
So, what you will have to do is check with the JCs nearest your home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323160103">Well just don&#39;t call them &quot;JC&quot; anymore &lt;G&gt;. No longer &quot;junior colleges&quot; -- <br/>
they are &quot;community colleges.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The ed code in California says that community colleges must be open to anyone <br/>
who is 18 or a high school graduate. They MAY be open to students under that <br/>
age. It is up to them. Most are - but they can set their own rules.<br/>
<br/>
Most have some sort of form for underage kids to have their parents and their <br/>
school fill out. It usually requires a signature from a school counselor. If <br/>
you file an R4, then you have to sign it yourself and try to get them to <br/>
understand you are a private school. <br/>
<br/>
They will often want to have you get approval from the instructor of the <br/>
class you want to take, as an underage student. Or it might be that you need <br/>
approval from the dean of admissions. Or you might need approval of someone <br/>
else at the college. <br/>
<br/>
Most community colleges limit the number of units a younger student can take. <br/>
Some don&#39;t. Some have a list of courses that the underage student is not <br/>
allowed to enroll in -- human sexuality courses, for example. Some will not <br/>
allow underage students to take &quot;remedial&quot; courses - courses that they could <br/>
take at a high school, for example. Some will not allow courses that they <br/>
consider vocational - courses such as guitar, that could be taken elsewhere, <br/>
at a city recreation department, for example. Some colleges don&#39;t limit the <br/>
courses that underage students can take, at all.<br/>
<br/>
The way to get started is to go get a copy of the college &quot;catalog&quot; and a <br/>
copy of the next session&#39;s schedule of classes. You can get them in the <br/>
college bookstore, probably. If not, try the admissions office. Look to see <br/>
if there is a course you want to sign up for. If so, you must apply for <br/>
admission to the college by filing an application just like any other <br/>
student. There will probably be an extra form for underage students, too. At <br/>
the college where I teach it is called a &quot;bridging form.&quot; Take the <br/>
application form to the admissions office, they&#39;ll let you know if you need <br/>
an extra form. Get them filled out completely and turn them in. <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll get a registration appointment. Some schools make underage students <br/>
take the very last registration times, which means the class might be closed <br/>
when you try to register for it. You can &quot;petition&quot; the class -- this means <br/>
show up on the first day and the teacher may let you in. I always let <br/>
everyone in who petitions my classes - as long as there are chairs for them. <br/>
Some teachers don&#39;t let anybody in. <br/>
<br/>
So - those are the technicalities.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to also suggest that if a child cannot handle most of this process <br/>
her/himself, he is not ready for college. Although these are community <br/>
colleges, they are REAL college courses. An art class, for example, is not <br/>
like a city recreation department art class - it is an academic course where <br/>
serious studying and learning is expected. There will be exams and grades, <br/>
remember &lt;G&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
You know how they always talk about your &quot;permanent record?&quot; Well - college <br/>
transcripts really are that. The courses a 13 yo takes at a college are on <br/>
those college transcripts forever. <br/>
<br/>
Kids should be able to go to class on their own and handle whatever happens <br/>
there - meet all the requirements - just like any other college student. Few <br/>
13 yo&#39;s would be ready for that - many 16 yo&#39;s are. <br/>
<br/>
I have heard reports of a number of community colleges &quot;cracking down&quot; on <br/>
underage students based on having had trouble with them. My college is one of <br/>
those. Although many underage kids do great - there have been a few that have <br/>
been problems, especially in the fine arts courses. <br/>
<br/>
My now-17 yo started at 13, with a voice class. She went on to take more <br/>
music and then ceramics and has completed a large number of academic courses <br/>
-- about 60 units total. It has been a very positive experience for her. <br/>
<br/>
My now-14 yo is there now, for her first semester. She is also taking a voice <br/>
class, but also website design and Intro to Opera (about opera - not singing <br/>
opera). <br/>
<br/>
They both keep track of what they&#39;re doing at the college all on their own. I <br/>
do not even know about homework, tests, etc. <br/>
<br/>
They are very excited about what they are learning and see the whole college <br/>
as a gigantic resource - filled with people who are there to share their <br/>
expertise with them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-193936594">The name of some of the colleges &quot;is&quot; JC as in Santa Rosa Junior College and<br/>
Modesto Junior College.  They all belong to the California Community<br/>
Colleges but they are still known as and named Jr.  Hey some of them are<br/>
still named &quot;city&quot; colleges and &quot;tech&quot; colleges.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a link to find the closest one and to get a copy of available classes<br/>
online <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cccco.edu/find/alphabetical.htm">http://www.cccco.edu/find/alphabetical.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Some of them have agreements with local ps districts and that has an effect<br/>
on their enrollment regs for under-age students.  For example, locally, they<br/>
can only take two classes per symester and can&#39;t enroll until they are 16.<br/>
They have to take an entrance exam.<br/>
<br/>
As to grades, they can op for a credit/no credit and choose no credit if<br/>
they think they won&#39;t get a B or better and that way it won&#39;t have an affect<br/>
on their GPA.<br/>
<br/>
Also, a lot of the colleges offer online coarses and televised coarses.<br/>
These are another way of taking the classes without the stress of an actual<br/>
classroom.<br/>

have kept the name junior college. Anywhere else, I thought it might be <br/>
