&gt; MY neighbor told me her 6 yr old had 14 pages of work today, on the 2nd day<br/>
&gt; of school. My question was if he enjoyed it. She said evidently....but<br/>
&gt; why??? Why would a very active little boy enjoy sitting and working on<br/>
&gt; paper? and then get home to have mom tell him his m&#39;s were sloppy and needed<br/>
&gt; to practice those and vocabulary for another hour....I simply don&#39; t get<br/>
&gt; it:(<br/>

There&#39;s a difference between genius and stupidity: Genius has an end, but<br/>
there&#39;s no end to stupidity.<br/>
<br/>
When there come to be enough people who think as you do, some of the<br/>
stupidity will stop and education will change.<br/>
