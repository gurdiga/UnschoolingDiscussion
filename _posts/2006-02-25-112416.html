&gt; origins?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t guess the root word is &quot;nibble&quot;. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The way I find word origins is to go to google and put in the word,  <br/>
and then the word etymology<br/>
<br/>
so<br/>
cannibal etymology<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Found some:<br/>
 From Spanish Caníbalis, name (as recorded by Christopher Columbus)  <br/>
of the allegedly cannibalistic Caribs of Cuba and Haiti, from earlier  <br/>
Carib karibna, person, Carib.<br/>
<br/>
cannibal ￼<br/>
1553, from Sp. canibal &quot;a savage, cannibal,&quot; from Caniba, Christopher  <br/>
Columbus&#39; rendition of the Caribs&#39; name for themselves, Galibi &quot;brave  <br/>
men.&quot; The natives were believed to be anthropophagites. Columbus,  <br/>
seeking evidence that he was in Asia, thought the name meant the  <br/>
natives were subjects of the Great Khan. Shakespeare&#39;s Caliban (in  <br/>
&quot;The Tempest&quot;) is a version of this word, with -n- and -l-  <br/>
interchanged, found in Hakluyt&#39;s &quot;Voyages&quot; (1599). Cannibalize of  <br/>
machinery, etc., first recorded 1943, reflecting war-time shortages.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-767851993">Hey, Marji!   Glad to see your smiling....  sigline.  Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
The site Marji linked, etymonline.com, was the second one I quoted.   <br/>
It&#39;s a good one, and usually comes up first, but I still go through  <br/>
google because it&#39;s easier to type google.com than  <br/>
etymonlineANYthing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

how to figure out some of them, and then you just have to look them  <br/>
up for confirmation!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some people hear a word as a whole word, and some are more likely to  <br/>
see it as its literal parts.  Sometimes a word will come across as  <br/>
just a sound for a thing for YEARS and then one day you see it fresh,  <br/>
as I did with this word:<br/>
<br/>
trailer<br/>
<br/>
I never thought about what it was.  I KNEW what trailers were, but I  <br/>
had never heard the word &quot;trail&quot; in there, to follow.<br/>

There&#39;s some stuff there, but before you go and look, maybe see what  <br/>
you and your daughter can cipher out of the names of the weeks and  <br/>
the month. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&quot;English from the Roots Up&quot; is really cool. We played with it for a  <br/>
long time - I kept the book on top of the refrigerator. We have a  <br/>
white board on the front of the fridge. I&#39;d write a root word on the  <br/>
white board - like &quot;Photos,&quot; for example.  Over the next few days -  <br/>
anybody who thinks of a word, containing that root or a variation of  <br/>
it, writes it on the white board. &quot;Photographs,&quot; &quot;Telephoto,&quot;  <br/>
&quot;Photosynthesis,&quot; and so on. After people had a chance to write stuff  <br/>
- I&#39;d add others (from the book) that nobody thought of. Then we&#39;d  <br/>
guess the meaning of the root word - somebody would write something,  <br/>
others would add their thoughts, or, if we just happened to be  <br/>
hanging around in the kitchen, we might talk about it. People could  <br/>
guess as long as they wanted, or just ask, or look in the book. All  <br/>
very casual - different for different words, kids, and times. But  <br/>
always fun.<br/>

Pam!  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter loved that book when she was about 12 and 13, and would<br/>
carry around and write out index cards like they showed in the book. <br/>
<br/>
We were always finding those cards everywhere in the house, used them<br/>
as bookmarks and as scraps of paper for notes and such for years.  I<br/>
found one just the other day.  It was fun, like finding a page from a<br/>
word-a-day calendar that had been forgotten.<br/>

only one copy in our (pretty large) library consortium.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141975227">Some library systems will order a book if a patron requests it.  Makes sense<br/>
to use patron requests to help inform their buy list.  It couldn&#39;t hurt to<br/>
ask your local librarian.  You will need the title, author and publisher and<br/>
of course it needs to be in print.<br/>
