<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942247576">&lt;&lt;What would make unschooling bad for anyone?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the downfall of unschooling for many people is that you have to be<br/>
willing to examine yourself, what you are doing, what you are thinking, in a<br/>
really tough way.  That is extremely threatening for some people.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was Sandra posted something about how she had never come across a<br/>
family meeting where the parents didn&#39;t already have a plan in mind and the<br/>
kids were supposed to rubber stamp it.<br/>
<br/>
I know this happens a lot.  I see it with friends quite a bit.  I think<br/>
unschooling parents have to be very aware of the imbalance of power in the<br/>
relationship with their kids.<br/>
<br/>
It is kind of like a &quot;therapist/patient&quot; relationship in that the parent can<br/>
twist things to make the kids do what they want them to do seemingly<br/>
willingly.  The parent can use just the right inflection, the right amount<br/>
of eye contact, the right wording to manipulate their children into not<br/>
expressing their true choices.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents have to be willing to take a look at themselves and see<br/>
what is going on.<br/>

hi there...i&#39;ve been lurking here digesting (and marveling at) all of the<br/>
discussions for about a week and annoying my husband with the onslaught<br/>
of messages in our inbox. ;)  now i feel a desire to chime in! <br/>
introduction to follow later!<br/>
<br/>
i hear this all the time...*you&#39;re so brave to homeschool* *i&#39;m not<br/>
patient (smart, dedicated, etc) enough to do that!* *don&#39;t you get sick<br/>
of being with your kids all the time?* among other things i&#39;m sure you&#39;ve<br/>
all heard before.  and beyond being simply amazed that people actually<br/>
say these things out loud, let alone think them, i&#39;m always left<br/>
confused.  while i realize that a lot of decisions i make are not<br/>
*normal* in our society these days, i don&#39;t consider myself exceptionally<br/>
strong or unique because i make them.  and i don&#39;t consider my choices to<br/>
be harder than those of other, more mainstream choices.  in fact, i&#39;d<br/>
have to argue that most everything i do (or have done) is somewhat based<br/>
in my inherent laziness. ;)  it&#39;s just easier to nurse my baby in the<br/>
middle of the night than to drag my butt all the way downstairs and fix a<br/>
bottle.  and it&#39;s easier to sleep with my kids than to shove them off<br/>
somewhere else and have to get up to deal with their resulting<br/>
insecurities in the middle of the night.  it&#39;s easier for me to listen to<br/>
their needs than to put them off and hear them scream about it.  in the<br/>
same way, it&#39;s easier to sit back and enjoy the amazing ways my children<br/>
manage to learn what they want, when they choose to!  it feels natural to<br/>
me, just like the rest of our lives.  i never sat and chose to unschool<br/>
our kids...i didn&#39;t even know what it meant until i became interested in<br/>
homeschooling and figured out we&#39;d been living it all along!  <br/>
<br/>
i think perhaps what&#39;s unique about a parent who chooses the road of<br/>
unschooling is that they have the courage to follow their instincts above<br/>
their schooling and that they&#39;re not so thoroughly drenched in the path<br/>
that was chosen for them that they can&#39;t see the light when it&#39;s opened<br/>
to them.  i suppose some people never even know they have options.  most<br/>
people are taught that we have roles to play in life that are<br/>
predetermined and they just follow them.  i&#39;ve always been a rule breaker<br/>
and now, as an adult, i&#39;m glad of it!  a whole new world is opening up to<br/>
me that most will never know exists and i believe that following this new<br/>
route has the potential to break the cycle of imbalance in our times.<br/>
<br/>
but i digress...people seem to perceive anything different from *normal*<br/>
choices as more difficult.  it feels to me like it&#39;s easier for most<br/>
people to avoid the compassion to pick up their crying infant in the<br/>
middle of the night because they&#39;re told it will make them more<br/>
independent to put themselves back to sleep.  easier to bottle feed a<br/>
baby, even with the chore of sterilizing and filling bottles, because<br/>
they can sidestep the intimacy of suckling which is considered unpopular,<br/>
embarrassing, low-tech, and unnecessary these days.  easier to send their<br/>
kids to school for someone else to *educate* because it&#39;s too much work<br/>
having to come up with and follow a curriculum.  easier to trust someone<br/>
else than to trust themselves or their children&#39;s inherent goodness and<br/>
curiosity.  children are born incapable of thought.  they must be trained<br/>
to act appropriately...schooled to become proper productively functioning<br/>
citizens.  and yet, is it working?  everyone complains about schools and<br/>
their multitude of problems.  but the focus only seems to shift slightly<br/>
sideways...if the classes were smaller, the teachers better paid, etc.,<br/>
everything would be perfect.  but we all know this is far off the mark. <br/>
we have to stop sending our children away when they don&#39;t choose it. <br/>
stop pretending we know better than them what is interesting to them. <br/>
and just breathe and love and relax and trust.  <br/>
<br/>
maybe it is an extra special thing to be a parent who lives this way...at<br/>
least in our culture.  maybe it does take some little something extra. <br/>
mostly, i think it&#39;s openness to new ideas and the ability to genuinely<br/>
follow your heart.  unschooling children is an natural extension of<br/>
unschooling ourselves.  its all interrelated.<br/>
<br/>
have i gone on enough yet?  yeesh... :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-997389005">I think that it takes a mother who is willing to interact with and listen to<br/>
her children.  That sounds so simple, but I know a lot of people who don&#39;t<br/>
*really* listen to their children and whose interactions with them are<br/>
limited to telling them what they&#39;ve done wrong.<br/>

<br/>
So true.<br/>
<br/>
My son withdrew from high school today. He told his friends he had decided to &quot;take the <br/>
road less traveled.&quot; His school friends are jealous; his teachers, genuinely sad to lose him <br/>
(he particpates in class, of all things!).<br/>
<br/>
And he is so happy today. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had a great (nearly) two years with our younger kids and see unschooling going <br/>
swimmingly for them. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m excited to see what happens with my oldest... I can feel the scales fall from our eyes.<br/>
<br/>
And who knows what my sophomore daughter will do come the end of the semester? <br/>

What would make unschooling a bad choice for someone?**<br/>
<br/>
Being uptight and controlling probably isn&#39;t a good start for an <br/>
unschooling parent.  That&#39;s the first thing that pops to mind.<br/>
<br/>
Caring a lot about what other people think, that is being the kind of <br/>
person that will crumple if a sister-in-law totally doesn&#39;t get <br/>
unschooling and sneers at it would be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Being cynical and derisive would be a total handicap (and sad for the <br/>
kids). <br/>
<br/>
Who&#39;s got PamS&#39;s list of positive adjectives?  Those are inspiring.<br/>
<br/>
**don&#39;t you get sick<br/>
of being with your kids all the time?**<br/>
<br/>
OK, liking your kids and wanting to spend time with them seems like a <br/>
necessary condition for happy healthy and fruitful unschooling.<br/>
<br/>

PS   I&#39;m not assuming that anyone who asks about this actually has these <br/>
qualities.  These are just examples, writ large, of what temperaments <br/>
might not mesh with unschooling.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-676384381">thanks so much!  i finally feel warmly welcome here alongside my<br/>
like-minded sisters and brothers (are there any fathers on the<br/>
list??)...and, i must say, it feels mighty good. :)  i voraciously read<br/>
through all of these posts throughout the day and it seems that just when<br/>
i&#39;m struggling with something, someone happens to pipe up about it.  i&#39;m<br/>
glad to have found this resource!<br/>
<br/>
julie, <br/>
many congratulations to your son today!  sounds like he&#39;s following his<br/>
heart (and his mind), which is very commendable.  i find for myself that<br/>
i&#39;m able to best clarify what i&#39;m after by experiencing what&#39;s not quite<br/>
right.  (did that make sense?  sometimes i don&#39;t articulate myself well.)<br/>
 it always seems clearer by contrast.  sounds like he experienced this in<br/>
school.  he went, he participated, he *succeeded* by their standards, yet<br/>
it still wasn&#39;t right for him.  lesson learned!  how fantastic!<br/>
<br/>
happy day!<br/>
