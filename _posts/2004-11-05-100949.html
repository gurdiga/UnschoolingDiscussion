&gt; On Monday I myself bought a video game, for myself.  Well, for everyone.  &gt; Well... it&#39;s not for fingers.  It&#39;s for arms, shoulders, and if you hold the bongos <br/>
&gt; between your legs, for other parts.  The first long session Kirby played he <br/>
&gt; could hardly get up and walk afterwards, and was whining about his <br/>
&gt; shoulders hurting. &lt;g&gt;  I sit close to the table and wedge my drums between <br/>
&gt; me and the edge of the table.  Some hold them in laps (one dropped them <br/>
&gt; while clapping.   Some leave them on the table.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633503137">My daughter discovered that screaming registers as a clap too.  She <br/>
figured it out on one of the games where you juggle and when you clap <br/>
the monkey throws you more things to juggle. Well, she was getting <br/>
excited and shrieking and we couldn&#39;t figure out why everytime she <br/>
played the monkey went crazy throwing her bananas. ;)  Finally we <br/>
realized he hears her screaming in excitement and thinks it&#39;s a <br/>
clap.  <br/>
<br/>
So today she was playing with her friend and all I heard coming out <br/>
of the room was 2 pre-teen girls&#39; shrieking screams during the parts <br/>
of the songs requiring lots of clapping.  They said they get more <br/>
coins and their hands don&#39;t get sore from clapping.  I wonder if <br/>
their throats are sore now instead of their hands? lol <br/>
