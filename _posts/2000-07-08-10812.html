&lt;&lt; all of my neighbors have beautifully decorated homes. i tell <br/>
 them i am sorry i have made their property values go down...&gt;&gt;<br/>

 Bridget, you crack me up!  :)  I just came in a little while ago from <br/>
working outside in the yard--it took me about 2 hrs, because I had so much to <br/>
catch up on, and while I was out there, I was thinking to myself that I <br/>
should send a written apology to my neighbors! ha ha!  To think that I used <br/>
to have several hours a week to spend out in our yard-- amazing how a house <br/>
full of little ones changes all of that!  :)  Hey, btw, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re still <br/>
on the list!  ~Karen</div>
