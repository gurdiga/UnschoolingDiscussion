Actually, we have tried the Nayonnaise brand and I guess I&#39;m pretty<br/>
fussy about my mayonaise because I do find it to be too tangy/acetic for<br/>
my liking.  I LOVE spice and add cayenne to everything but in the case<br/>
of a mayonaise-type spread I need mild and creamy.  I will try your<br/>
homemade recipe and invite you to forward any other suggestions for<br/>
spreads/sandwiches you might have.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate you being one of my new resources in the vegan way,<br/>

&gt; Hello Sonia,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We usually buy Nayonnaise-which is a vegan mayonnaise by Nasoya. It&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; tangy like the Hain vegan mayonnaise. It&#39;s very mild=at least we think so.<br/>
&gt; When we make our own, we use this recipe:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tofu Mayonnaise:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3/4 cup soft or medium tofu (the best kind to use for this is by Mori<br/>
&gt; Nu-usually found in the Asian grocery section doesn&#39;t have to be chilled)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2 tbsp lemon juice OR vinegar<br/>
&gt; 1/2 tsp salt<br/>
&gt; dash of pepper (optional-I don&#39;t use it)<br/>
&gt; 2 tbsp oil<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In a blender or food processor (I use my food processor) blend together on<br/>
&gt; high, the tofu, lemon juice, salt, pepper-if using, and oil until thick and<br/>
&gt; creamy. Adjust any ingredients for desired taste. Store in the refrigerator<br/>
&gt; in a clean, dry container with a tight fitting lid. Will keep for 7-10 days.<br/>
&gt; Makes about 1 1/2 cups.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, let me know if there are any other things you are trying to use vegan<br/>
&gt; replacements for. I have so many recipes that it would be impossible for me<br/>
&gt; to send them all. But I&#39;d be happy to send a few, and I can recommend some<br/>
&gt; great cookbooks/informative books that are vegan only.<br/>

I never have been a &quot;miracle whip&quot; fan, and I have found that the<br/>
Nayonaise smacks very much of that.  I keep trying it hoping my<br/>
tastebuds will adjust, but so far they have not!  I was/am a Hellmann&#39;s<br/>
fan all the way...Love the smooth, mild, creamy flavour and how it<br/>
enhances without overpowering.  The soy-based products still seem very<br/>
much influenced by vinegar!  I appreciate your encouragement and will<br/>
keep trying and agree wholeheartedly that the avocado, lettuce, tomato<br/>
and red onion sandwich is the way to go!!!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are big fans of Nayonaise, buy it by the case through our coop.<br/>
&gt; Its not exactly like a mayonaise, a little more zing like a miracle whip<br/>
&gt; spread, but not tart. I do not like any other brand.  It is soy based<br/>
&gt; also.  Lowfat and fatfree.  We also love using avocado for our<br/>

        Hi--In addition to what mayo recipes you may  have, here are two <br/>
recipes that you might try, too;  I don&#39;t know if you eat eggs, but the 2nd <br/>
recipe does not call for eggs, if that works better for you.                    <br/>
                                                                    Real <br/>
Mayo:  1 egg, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp mustard, 3 Tbsp lemon juice, 1/2 c olive <br/>
oil, 1/2 c safflower oil............mix egg,salt,mustard, and lemon juice in <br/>
blender.  Add oil very slowly.  Mixture should be very thick.  Refrigerate in <br/>
tightly sealed container                                                        <br/>
                                Imitation Mayo:  1c low-fat cottage cheese, 1 <br/>
Tbsp lemon juice, 1 Tbsp Sweet Cloud Rice Syrup  (found at health food <br/>
stores).........Mix all ingredients in blender.  Store in glass jar in <br/>
refrigerator.                                                                   <br/>
                    Hope you can use these.  :)  ~Karen</div>
