<div id="ygrps-yiv-958779828">Hello all.  My name is Wendy and I am the mother of an amazing and <br/>
incredible 11 year old boy.  We are new to unschooling and I am extremely <br/>
nervous and intimidated.  I have been lurking here for a few days in order to <br/>
get the feel of things.  <br/>
       My son went to public school for &quot;K-3rd grade&quot; and we&#39;ve been <br/>
homeschooling ever since.  He didn&#39;t have any particular problems in public <br/>
school.  He got decent grades, no behavioral problems or anything like that.  <br/>
I just felt like he was being forced think and live in a box.  &quot;Raise your <br/>
hand before you speak.  No talking in the lunch room,&quot; etc.  Originally, I <br/>
felt that I could do a much better job of teaching him at home.   I felt that <br/>
one on one (he&#39;s an only child) attention would make him some sort of <br/>
motivated learner.  I forgot that, as a child,  I hated school and learning <br/>
and reading until I stumbled upon them quite be chance, on my own terms.  <br/>
       When I think back to  that first year that we HSed, all I did was to <br/>
duplicate the &quot;classroom&quot; in the living room.  I&#39;ve gotten somewhat better <br/>
over the past few years, but recently (literally days ago) my son approached <br/>
me with the idea of unschooling.  To be honest, I have wanted to try it from <br/>
the start, I just haven&#39;t been able to muster the courage or faith in either <br/>
of us to go for it.  I&#39;m ashamed to admit that, but it&#39;s true.  Now, with a <br/>
lot of prayer and faith, we&#39;re &quot;letting go.&quot;  However, I&#39;m still a nervous <br/>
wreck.  I don&#39;t know why.  I have never been a typical learner myself.  I <br/>
hated school, failed miserably, mystified my parents (who could not <br/>
understand why I &quot;tested&quot; so high and performed so poorly), and eventually <br/>
latched on to my own interests and am now an avid reader, writer, learner, <br/>
liver, etc.  Why can&#39;t I trust my son to do the same?  I am really trying to <br/>
relax, but I could sure use some help and encouragement.  I&#39;m afraid he&#39;ll <br/>
never be motivated to pick up a book or look up something that he&#39;s <br/>
interested in.  I worry that college will be out of his reach.  <br/>
       Okay.  I&#39;m ready for that encouragement now!  Thanks for listening to <br/>
me rant a bit, or more that a bit :o)...<br/>

Hi, Wendy --<br/>
<br/>
Many of us have our nervous moments.  Is there any way you could meet<br/>
some real unschooled kids?  My son is almost 9 and has always been<br/>
unschooled.  He has never filled out a math worksheet, and sometimes<br/>
this makes me nervous, but if you had a conversation with him about the<br/>
subject you would find that he knows a lot about math.  He&#39;s proof to me<br/>
that the method works.  He&#39;s also happy, creative, alert, and interested<br/>
in lots of things that school children tend to find repulsive.<br/>
<br/>
My husband taught junior high school in badly run school in a poor<br/>
neighborhood last year.  Believe me, from his stories I learned how hard<br/>
it is to make anyone learn something when they&#39;ve made up their mind not<br/>
to learn.  (&quot;La la la, I&#39;m not liiiissssttteeennnning&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Try to let go of the idea, if you have it, that it&#39;s possible to have an<br/>
education without &quot;gaps&quot;.  Also, try to get rid of the idea that there<br/>
is an appropriate sequence and speed for learning.  If you can dump<br/>
these two ideas, and never measure your kid against school frameworks,<br/>
you can probably enjoy watching your child develop.<br/>
<br/>
Also, try searching the unschooling.com message boards for the word<br/>
&quot;deschooling&quot;.  That may help you.<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt;Hello all.  My name is Wendy and I am the mother of an amazing and <br/>
incredible 11 year old boy.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just remember this first sentence. What makes him so amazing and <br/>
incredible? School, your school at home or just because he is? I bet <br/>
it&#39;s the last one. In which case, how can he not be amazing and <br/>
incredible without schooling? It works and you have to believe that. <br/>
Read here, read books and just watch your son. Watch him closely and <br/>
see how he learns all the time. See how happy he will be and what he <br/>
finds fascinating. Soon the time will pass and you will know it works <br/>
for him. Just work on trusting him and yourself to let some time pass <br/>
so that you can see all of this.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209388906">Hi.  I wanted to thank everyone who responded to my fears.  You all <br/>
have been very encouraging and I can&#39;t tell you how much it&#39;s meant <br/>
to me.  I am still a work in progress (and proud to say that I always <br/>
will be!), but I am really starting to relax and allow my son to get <br/>
in touch with his own goals and interests instead of trying to define <br/>
him based on what I think that he should be at any given age or <br/>
level, etc.  Thanks again!  This group is turning out to be a real <br/>
blessing.  <br/>
