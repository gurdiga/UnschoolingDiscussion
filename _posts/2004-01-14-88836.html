This has to be short but...<br/>
if your child would benefit from some services at school which you cannot <br/>
provide, see if you can get them at home or at the school with you taking them <br/>
just for that.  Or you can look into finding a service provider NOT through the <br/>
school system!<br/>
As a former special ed teacher my advice is DON&#39;T put &#39;em in school!  The <br/>
system is designed to help at best the &quot;regular&quot; kids and an hour or 2 of spec ed <br/>
services in a week is just not a good reason to put them in that system which <br/>
is designed against their best interests!<br/>
Good luck<br/>
