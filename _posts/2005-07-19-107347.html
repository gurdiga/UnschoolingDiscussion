<div id="ygrps-yiv-591051036">OK, after the confrontation I wrote about at the end of Part 2 (a <br/>
BIG Thank You to those who are reading these long posts.  This is <br/>
helping me tremendously to write about it and try to be objective--<br/>
although I fail!)  During Noelle&#39;s visit I sometimes felt like an <br/>
observer watching school vs. unschool, distrust vs. trust, no choice <br/>
vs. choice.  <br/>
<br/>
After I told Noelle she needed to go home our conversation continued.<br/>
<br/>
Noelle:  You&#39;re the one who wanted me to come.<br/>
<br/>
Me: Wait a minute.  You&#39;re Mom set this up and she said you wanted <br/>
to come.<br/>
<br/>
Noelle:  I didn&#39;t want to come and I told my parents that.<br/>
<br/>
Me:  You told them you didn&#39;t want to come and they made you anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Noelle:  Yes, I told them I didn&#39;t want to come and they said I had <br/>
to.  Then I asked if I could come for only a week and they said no <br/>
to that, too.  When my Dad called on Sunday I asked if I could come <br/>
home and they said no.<br/>
<br/>
(Note:  During the 10 days that Noelle was with us.  Her Dad called <br/>
her once and her mother not at all.  Even after she told them she <br/>
was miserable and wanted to come home nobody bothered to tell me or <br/>
my husband and they also didn&#39;t call to check on her.  I am still <br/>
saddened and amazed by this.)<br/>
<br/>
Me:  Well, I will call them and we will get you home.  <br/>
<br/>
Noelle:  They won&#39;t let me.<br/>
<br/>
Me:  They will have no choice.  I can make that happen for you.<br/>
<br/>
Noelle:  No, I&#39;ll get in trouble for stressing you out.  I can&#39;t be <br/>
stressing you out that much.  (I know you can&#39;t read tone or emotion <br/>
in these words but if you can imagine a 14 year old girl in tears <br/>
and yelling in a panicky voice.)<br/>
<br/>
Me:  I won&#39;t make it about me it will be about you.  I&#39;ll tell them <br/>
you&#39;re unhappy here and you want to come home.<br/>
<br/>
Noelle:  That won&#39;t work with them.<br/>
<br/>
Me:  What do you want me to do?<br/>
<br/>
Noelle:  I don&#39;t know what I want.  (She runs upstairs to her room.)<br/>
<br/>
I was shocked and sad and confused and I felt tremendous sympathy <br/>
for this poor child who had no choice and was trying to get what she <br/>
needed--which was to go home.  At the same time I was furious with <br/>
her parents for sending her here under false pretenses and for not <br/>
letting us know what was going on. <br/>
<br/>
My daughters Sarah (6) and Olivia (3.5) witnessed this exchange.  I <br/>
thought it might upset them and confuse them but after Noelle ran <br/>
upstairs they continued with their breakfasts happy as little larks, <br/>
talking and laughing.  They asked me if Noelle was going home.  I <br/>
told them yes in a day or two.  They seemed relieved.  Sarah <br/>
said, &quot;I&#39;m glad she is going, Mommy.  She is rude to you.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
We got ready to go to Bible School and went out to the car.  I was <br/>
helping the girls in their seats when Noelle came out the front <br/>
door, crying.  I put my arms around her and said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t mean to hurt your feelings.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Noelle was sobbing and she said, &quot;You think that I think you&#39;re a <br/>
bad mother.  I don&#39;t think that.  I think you&#39;re a good mother.  <br/>
It&#39;s just that Sarah and Olivia get to do whatever they want and I <br/>
never get to do anything I want and it is so hard for me to be <br/>
around that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I put my arms around her again and told her that when we started <br/>
parenting differently and decided that choice was better than no <br/>
choice that I had those feelings, too, because I had little or no <br/>
choice when I was growing up.  <br/>
<br/>
We got in the car and I tried to talk with her more about what she <br/>
had just said.  (What a revelation!)  But she took out her iPod and <br/>
put the earphones in--ending any conversation we could have had.<br/>
<br/>
After Bible School Noelle wanted to stay on at the church until <br/>
9pm.  She was going to watch a &quot;Star Wars&quot; marathon and eat pizza <br/>
with a group of kids her age.  I was relieved that she had something <br/>
she wanted to do and that we would have a break from her as well.<br/>
<br/>
When I got home I called Noelle&#39;s Dad, my brother-in-law.<br/>
<br/>
Me:  This is Linda<br/>
<br/>
BIL:  Hi, how&#39;s it going?<br/>
<br/>
Me:  Not well, Noelle is very unhappy here and wants to come home.<br/>
<br/>
BIL:  I&#39;m not surprised.  She wasn&#39;t too happy when she left.<br/>
<br/>
Me:  And you sent her anyway?<br/>
<br/>
BIL:  (Pause . . .)  We thought she&#39;d get over it.<br/>
<br/>
Me:  You need to think about listening to her and giving her what <br/>
she wants.<br/>
<br/>
BIL:  Who gets a life like that?<br/>
<br/>
Me:  A kid should.<br/>
<br/>
BIL:  Hmpf<br/>
<br/>
Me:  A kid should at least get a taste of it so she knows what to <br/>
shoot for as an adult.<br/>
<br/>
BIL:  I&#39;ll have her mother call you.<br/>
<br/>
Me:  You need to change her flight.  She wants to come home as soon <br/>
as possible.<br/>
<br/>
BIL:  I&#39;ll have her mother call you.  (Code for:  I&#39;m not doing a<br/>
&%#$% thing.) (I got a feeling for what Noelle <br/>
is dealing with.)<br/>
<br/>
I was so angry with I got off of the phone.  This poor obnoxious kid <br/>
who doesn&#39;t read a book unless forced and is the biggest pain in the <br/>
you-know-what, well, you can just see where this comes from.  At <br/>
that moment I felt so grateful that I can stay home with my children <br/>
and keep them with me and not in school.  <br/>
<br/>
End of Part 3:  Next Noelle&#39;s mother calls, we send Noelle home, and <br/>
a wrap-up of Noelle&#39;s comments about homeschooling (which I found <br/>
amazing).  Thank you to all the hardy souls who have read to the end!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-332218898"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My instinct would be for her to stay.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wanted that, too.  I think that&#39;s why it took so long for me to <br/>
figure out what was going on.  I just kept thinking that if I <br/>
treated her with an unschool attitude that she would have a vacation <br/>
from being forced to do things and she would come around.  There <br/>
were a few moments like that but I think what it boiled down to was <br/>
that she wanted her parents to listen to her and she wanted them to <br/>
want her at home.  That&#39;s my guess.<br/>
 <br/>
A few &quot;good&quot; examples:<br/>
<br/>
We left her with Sarah for a morning and it was really getting hot <br/>
outside and we had the back door open.  Before I left I told her <br/>
that if they got hot they could close the door and turn the air <br/>
conditioner on.  I showed her where the thermostat was and told her <br/>
to make herself comfortable--whatever temp that might be.  She <br/>
said, &quot;Wow, at my house only my Dad gets to touch the thermostat.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Also, we subscribe to Netflix and Noelle wants a subscription but <br/>
doesn&#39;t have one.  I told her to go on mine and pick out whatever <br/>
she wanted for the next movie.  She told me she had it narrowed down <br/>
to three and told me what they were--I think she expected me to tell <br/>
her she couldn&#39;t watch them.  I said, well, whatever you want and <br/>
she chose &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; and got it and watched it.<br/>
<br/>
There were good moments but I was overwhelmed by her comments and <br/>
coercive energy by the 7th day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My mom used to say that it wasn&#39;t fair for people to take in the &quot;Fresh Air&quot; <br/>
kids from the inner cities in the summer because they would just have to <br/>
return to the city, and they would be bummed about what they didn&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, I know several adults who, when they lived in NYC as children growing <br/>
up in single-parent families living in poverty, had tiny little vacations <br/>
(like the &quot;Fresh Air&quot; program) in other areas of NYS, which sparked the <br/>
desire to someday move out of the city, and they did.<br/>
<br/>
My own experiences, coming from a family in which parents parented in a way <br/>
that bordered on abuse, are similar. When I was a teen, I was asked to go on <br/>
vacation with a family I regularly babysat for, so that the parents would <br/>
have a built-in babysitter along with them. This family never hit their <br/>
kids, and they spoke to them in respectful ways. Working with this family <br/>
and vacationing with them was my first experience with other-parenting. <br/>
Then, when I was in college, a family on a college bulletin board offered <br/>
room/board to a college student for the same reason --- to have a built-in <br/>
babysitter in the house. The parents liked to go out without much planning, <br/>
and, if I was there and wasn&#39;t planning to go out, they would ask if it <br/>
would work for me to hang with the kids while they were out. They, too, did <br/>
not hit their kids, and they also prioritized respectful relationships with <br/>
their kids. These two experiences set up what I wanted to have with any <br/>
children I might ever have. I knew I didn&#39;t want the seat-of-the-pants <br/>
powering-over parenting that was standard in my family. I wanted to <br/>
prioritize the long-term relationship with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Linda, I am delighted to read your saga --- and I&#39;m sure there are many <br/>
others here reading that haven&#39;t told you about the sparkle that your saga <br/>
has put into their days. I also want to tell you not to underestimate the <br/>
power of the simple conversations and example you&#39;ve set. Now, Noelle has a <br/>
clue that things can be different; that&#39;s a lot.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And I want to respond to that as well. I also came from a family that <br/>
was borderline-abusive in those ways that pass for normal parenting in <br/>
our culture. It is amazing to me that I have been able to enter into a <br/>
12-year, healthy and happy relationship, and raise my young children <br/>
with respect, because I certainly didn&#39;t learn any of that at home. A <br/>
friend who suffered horrific abuse as a child and I have talked about <br/>
what makes it possible for some kids to do things so very differently <br/>
from how they were raised, and we think one important piece is that <br/>
something happens for them (as happened for us) that allows them to <br/>
imagine another possibility. For me, I remember a friend I loved <br/>
visiting because I could tell when I was in her house that her parents <br/>
liked each other and liked her. Knowing parents who seemed to like <br/>
their kids made my relationship with my parents more painful, but it <br/>
also offered me a vision of something else I might have.<br/>
<br/>
My badly-abused friend remembers that when she was five or six, she was <br/>
crying in a public place--she can&#39;t remember why--and a strange woman <br/>
took her into her arms and held her until she stopped crying and for a <br/>
long time after. She had never been held like that by her mother, or by <br/>
anyone else, and that feeling of sinking into the body of a loving <br/>
adult was revelatory for her. She remembered it for the rest of her <br/>
childhood. That one moment became a kind of talisman for her, and an <br/>
image of love that she consciously went looking for once she was out on <br/>
her own in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Nicole&#39;s visit to a different kind of family may make her homelife more <br/>
painful for awhile. It may also stay with her and open the possibility <br/>
of eventual transformation for her. It may be a life-changing gift that <br/>
she has been given. We can certainly hope so.<br/>

not stir everything up more so that she&#39;d be feeling even more<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095347627">Something else that sprang to mind for me was your<br/>
mention that Noelle is schooled.  I know it was true<br/>
for me (and maybe for her as well) that school was<br/>
almost the only place I felt any comfort, safety or<br/>
acceptance.  It sure wasn&#39;t happening at home.<br/>
<br/>
So we get used to non-acceptance from our family<br/>
members and throw ourselves in conditional acceptance<br/>
areas (like school or work or maybe even gangs?)<br/>
because it&#39;s better than nothing.  Some of us will<br/>
spend the rest of our lives trying to get used to<br/>
people who DO love us thoroughly, no strings attached<br/>
if you will, because we&#39;re so accustomed to having to<br/>
perform for positive attention.<br/>
<br/>
I hope Noelle finds those special moments that help<br/>
her feel loved and then more special moments that<br/>
teach her she has value as an individual.<br/>
