<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756968971">Homeschool Family Postcards and More<br/>
This is a fun new group for Homeschooling families to exchange <br/>
monthly postcards, and/or greeting cards with other familles from <br/>
different areas. It can be a great Geography lesson! We have a penpal <br/>
database for kids, teens, and moms looking for a penpal. A state <br/>
envelope of information swap will also be starting soon.<br/>
In order to be a part of this group you MUST exchange a <br/>
postcard/greeting card each month. And you must follow through once <br/>
you sign up. We don&#39;t want any hurt children waiting for a card that <br/>
never arrives!Anyone who does not send out their card will be <br/>
unsubbed from the group. A card will be sent to anyone who doesn&#39;t <br/>
receive one from another family.<br/>
This will be fun for all involved!! This group is very organized and <br/>
so far we have had one very successful exchange. You choose a <br/>
family/state each month that you would like to receive a card from. <br/>
This way no one is receiving cards from the same place or their own <br/>
state over and over again. To join please go to;<br/>

<br/>
I let this post through even though I learned (from experience and <br/>
participation) to distrust and to fear such exchanges.<br/>
<br/>
It would be good if more people would see them as the math lessons they <br/>
really are.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; You choose a <br/>
<br/>
family/state each month that you would like to receive a card from. <br/>
<br/>
This way no one is receiving cards from the same place or their own <br/>
<br/>
state over and over again.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Right.  <br/>
<br/>
And when I was on a list with several hundred families (some states had <br/>
nearly a hundred just from that one state--California and Texas), and I was either <br/>
the only or one of two from New Mexico, GUESS WHAT!?<br/>
<br/>
LOTS of people in those states were going to be lacking a post card (and now <br/>
they&#39;re up to PACKETS!?  ON REQUEST!?) from New Mexico.  Either that, or I <br/>
would&#39;ve been mailing out hundreds of post cards.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not going to work in the real world the way it sounds when someone just <br/>
says &quot;Oooh, there are fifty states, and so everyone just has to send 49 <br/>
things!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wrong-o<br/>
