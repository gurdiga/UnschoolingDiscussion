 </span></blockquote>We have two onlies.   Honest!  10 years between kids leaves them each pretty <br/>
much an only.  Sure it was a bit harder to encourage them to learn to play on <br/>
their own and find activities to keep them busy.  OTOH, we learned how much <br/>
fun it is to play with our child.  I love that part of it.  He has helped me <br/>
remember it&#39;s not all work, work, work.  Life should include some play and <br/>
fun!  (especially important to me as my health will not allow me to expend <br/>
much energy on anything right now...it&#39;s nice to be able to &#39;legitimately&#39; <br/>
play with my boy.  heheheh)<br/>
<br/>
As for helping find friends.  I just got out of the way and he finds his own! <br/>
 This little scamp brought home a playmate from the post office!  Actually, <br/>
we didn&#39;t either of us go to the other&#39;s home at first...you know how things <br/>
are in big cities these days.  But, the boys would not leave each other until <br/>
we had made a play date.  Exchanged phone numbers while still at the post <br/>
office and met at a park a couple times before visiting each other at home.  <br/>
Turned out to be just one example of a pretty good friendship.<br/>
<br/>
Also, look outside the box!  For instance, assuming your kid is as nice as <br/>
mine &lt;insertful prideful grin for which I&#39;ll probably burn forever (if I <br/>
believed such things)&gt; nursing homes would probably LOVE visits.  It seems a <br/>
little strange to do at first, but it makes such a difference in these <br/>
people&#39;s lives.  Especially if he&#39;s willing to take a game with him and offer <br/>
to play checkers or something with someone there.  Don&#39;t know anyone at a <br/>
nursing home?  Show up and ask them at the front desk or nursing station if <br/>
there is someone that needs a friend or tell them you&#39;d like to adopt a g&#39;ma <br/>
or g&#39;pa.<br/>
<br/>
I sure agree about the assumption you have more time to make arrangements!  <br/>
We run into that, too.   Plus, my illnes is not so readily obvious to the <br/>
casual observer.  I don&#39;t like to inflict my pain on others, so most people <br/>
that meet and visit with me don&#39;t know that I&#39;m in almost constant pain and <br/>
have major fatigue.  Sometimes there is disappointment when I can&#39;t jump in <br/>
and do more.  It looks like a matter of won&#39;t rather than can&#39;t.  Plus, I <br/>
can&#39;t even know for sure ahead of time that I can make any appointment I <br/>
might make...so no sense arranging something there&#39;s a good chance I can&#39;t <br/>
attend when the time comes.  But, I suppose that&#39;s another story, too.  sorry <br/>
for rambling.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, savvy parent that you are, this is probably all old hat and I&#39;m <br/>
rambling.  But &#39;only&#39;s can be such fun!  (of course, it&#39;s some jealousy <br/>
enters in here...I would so much like to have had more kids or the <br/>
opportunity to adopt.  But that&#39;s another story and I don&#39;t like sour grapes! <br/>
 So, when I decide we don&#39;t have enough kidlets around here, I borrow someone <br/>
elses!  They are happy to come visit and mom gets a little break.)<br/>
<br/>
Have a good day,<br/>
