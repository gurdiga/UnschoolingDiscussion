<div id="ygrps-yiv-460582889">Well, we took the plunge and are total unschoolers. Of course my son (8) <br/>
always wanted to be an unschooler but of course the grown-up thinks you have <br/>
to do workbooks and have some sort of schedule for it to work. I trying to <br/>
really change my way of thinking. The school at home approach was not working <br/>
at all and everyone was becoming very stressed. Last week it all can to a <br/>
head and we just said this isn&#39;t working lets go this way and see where life <br/>
leads us. I know my son needs time to deschool (sorta speak) but since we <br/>
shifted all he wants to do is play video games. I&#39;m really having to bite my <br/>
tongue and just let it ride and see want happens. I don&#39;t want to take games <br/>
and TV away just to get him to try something else.  Will this stage pass? I&#39;m <br/>
truly hoping so. My husband is not totally on board but letting us try it. <br/>
I&#39;m hoping things with the games will change, in the mean time I intend to do <br/>
a lot of reading on-line and off for support to keep me from trying to push <br/>
him in any direction.<br/>

<br/>
A week isn&#39;t long enough to deschool.<br/>
<br/>
MONTHS won&#39;t be long enough.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Will this stage pass?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The stage in which you think plaing video games and watching TV are the lack <br/>
of doing something instead of the presence of learning will pass but only if <br/>
you REALLY try.  <br/>
<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/games/page">http://sandradodd.com/games/page</a><br/>
<br/>
I recommend you read everything there, and play games WITH him, and watch <br/>
videos or shows WITH him, and calmly and thoughtfully and slowly and really <br/>
see what he likes about them.<br/>
<br/>
I watched a lot of Ninja Turtles and Power Rangers when my kids were little, <br/>
and I could have resented it and resisted it and shamed and belittled them, <br/>
but instead I went there freely, and came to really see what was important to <br/>
them about it.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m hoping things with the games will change, in the mean time I intend to <br/>
do <br/>
a lot of reading on-line and off for support to keep me from trying to push <br/>
him in any direction.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our games sit sometimes for days or weeks, and sometimes never get cold for <br/>
72 hours.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to make him obsess about video games is to limit them.<br/>

really love) and suddenly found yourself with access to all the books you<br/>
love and the freedom to read. What if your husband decided there were better<br/>

clean more. Or study something that he felt was worthwhile so you could make<br/>
something of your life. What if at some point he decided there had been<br/>
enough book reading and not enough other stuff that he thought was a better<br/>
use of time and decided to limit how much time you could read. How would you<br/>
feel about the atmosphere he was creating? Would it make you want to do<br/>
other things? How would you feel about the books you couldn&#39;t read? How<br/>
would you feel about him?<br/>

Though if you suddenly had the freedom to read, you probably would read for<br/>
a long time. Weeks, months. But do you really think you&#39;d spend the rest of<br/>
your life reading? Isn&#39;t just knowing that you *could* read for the rest of<br/>
your life enough to give you the freedom to do other things? (Though it<br/>
would take those weeks or months for you to feel confident that this freedom<br/>
wasn&#39;t going to go away.) You would eventually know that if you went off to<br/>
something else that you could come back and the freedom would still be there<br/>
so there would be no need to hoard it and do nothing but read because you<br/>
would know you could read any time you want.<br/>
<br/>
How would you want your husband to treat you with your new found freedom?<br/>
Would you want him to delight in your happiness? Would you want him to ask<br/>
questions about your favorite books so you had someone to share with? Or<br/>
would you want him to hover, waiting for you to do something more important?<br/>
Or would you want him to grump at you for not doing what he thought was a<br/>
good use of time?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I think the best way to get a kid to obsess about almost anything is to <br/>
limit it, or worse make it really totally off-limits.<br/>
<br/>
We have friends who only get three tv channels and limit their kids&#39; tv <br/>
watching. Guess what they want to do when they come over? We&#39;ve learned <br/>
to make sure the tv is off, or the kids won&#39;t play. My kids, otoh, <br/>
sometimes watch a lot of tv and other times are much too busy. It <br/>
depends.<br/>

Joyce, you are so right about how I would feel it my husband or someone else <br/>
tried to limit anything I wanted to do. I just don&#39;t think along those lines <br/>
but I will be now. Before I say anything to my son I will ask myself &quot;How <br/>
would I feel about this?&quot;. I think that will stop me in my tracks about <br/>
limiting or pushing him to do anything.<br/>
Sandra, as soon as I finished writing the letter I headed to your website and <br/>
read everything about games and more. It was all so helpful and now I can go <br/>
back just for support.<br/>
Our life now is so much more relaxed and that&#39;s the way I want it to stay.<br/>
Thanks again for all the advise. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062036418">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I had to throw in my two cents regarding the issue of limiting TV and video <br/>
games.  Our kids have a lot of access to Game Boy and Nintendo, but we do not <br/>
have TV at all.  When we first moved to Georgia, we had TV, cable and all.  <br/>
We found that there was so much garbage on cable that it wasn&#39;t worth <br/>
keeping, so we got rid of it.  Then about a month later our antennae broke, <br/>
and we ended up with no channels.  No one seemed to miss it, so we just never <br/>
replaced the antennae.  We have a VCR and a DVD player and the kids can watch <br/>
movies whenever they want.  We have a real issue with all the negative and <br/>
blatantly sexually explicit media images out there - it&#39;s scary that they <br/>
even use sex to sell children&#39;s products (I saw a very suggestive commercial <br/>
for &quot;Fruit by the Foot&quot;).  We feel that those subtle innuendoes are <br/>
unnecessary and damaging.  At our friends&#39; houses, the kids can take TV or <br/>
leave it.  They aren&#39;t really &quot;into&quot; the latest trends, bands, fashions, <br/>
etc., and we like it that way!  Pokemon was the big thing when our TV died, <br/>
so they sort of stalled there :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I guess I just wanted to say that removing TV is not always a bad <br/>
thing.  I do agree that by restricting or denying access to something you are <br/>
inviting an obsession, but it just doesn&#39;t seem to have happened in our case. <br/>
 Maybe it&#39;s because the stuff they enjoyed watching on TV (nature <br/>
documentaries, for the most part, and Pokemon) are all available on video, so <br/>
they don&#39;t feel like they are missing anything.<br/>

If he hasn&#39;t wanted to play, then why the need to restrict on certain days?<br/>

I understand the wanting/needing balance. But it&#39;s not balance unless it <br/>

of it - three times.  Twice in a row and then once later on.  I thought we <br/>
were in for a ballet fest, but this morning Nathan put in There Goes a <br/>
Bulldozer and watched it three times in a row.  <br/>
<br/>
As long as I&#39;m not the one suggesting they put in a tape or dvd, I think they <br/>
find their own balance and know when enough is enough.  It help that they <br/>
treat Swan Lake as an exercise video - Nathan wants to jump as high as <br/>
Nureyev.  I have found myself doing the suggesting lately (why don&#39;t we put <br/>
in a video, so I can do X) and that bothers me.  Guilt.  They don&#39;t stay <br/>
planted for too long, though.<br/>
