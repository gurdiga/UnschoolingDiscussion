<div id="ygrps-yiv-681865009">Someone, maybe Ren, was talking about this gameboy game. There are more<br/>
than one title. How do I chose? Anyone know what the differences are? I&#39;d<br/>
like to get this for my 8yo ds. It sounded really up his alley with numbers<br/>
and such. Is there a game guide? I didn&#39;t see one at Toys R Us but I haven&#39;t<br/>
looked anywhere else yet. Thanks for any recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
  What do you all think of Kingdom Hearts for PS2? He wants this one so...<br/>
bad. This will be under the tree too. ;-) Gamings not my thing but he really<br/>
loves it. <br/>
<br/>
  Oh and an update. Billy and Nancy at FUN Books were very gererous in<br/>
replacing my lost book from the conference. Fast delivery too. Thanks again!<br/>

How old is he? My 10 year old who has had no problem working through Final Fantasy X (with help from a strategy guide but no gameshark codes) just gave up on KH. It looks like a really cool game BUT he says it is really hard and he just got so frustrated.  He can&#39;t decide if he&#39;s gonna trade it in for something else (like LOTR) or keep it and come back in a few months. It really depends of your child thrives on challenges. Mine does not like it to be too frustrating. He says it makes the games no fun for him.<br/>

    He&#39;s 8yo. He also has 13 and 17yo brothers. They work together mostly.<br/>
Thanks for the warning though. We&#39;ll have to wait and see. I know my 17yo<br/>
can&#39;t wait now. I told him and he&#39;s player it at a friends house and really<br/>
enjoyed it. :-)<br/>

    Thanks for the link. I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t think of that. I&#39;m sure<br/>
we&#39;ll have great fun with the game.<br/>
<br/>
    Ren, Do you have the game, booster packs, or tin? Maybe all three?<br/>
Pokemon was big with ds13 years ago. He told me last week that that&#39;s what<br/>
really helped him to read.:-) Now Yu-Gi-Oh with ds8 now. LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-613838962">O.k. we&#39;re slow around here, but 11yods is just now getting into Yu-Gi-<br/>
Oh.  We have been on a couple of sites to learn more.  Wow!  Never knew <br/>
this game was soooo complicated.  I can&#39;t imagine keeping up with all <br/>
the rules and strategy and all.  I know ds can though.  Ds does not <br/>
like to read so I am reading the info to him.  We are learning together.<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know the best place to go to learn the basics of the game; <br/>
and is there one starter deck that is better to buy than the others?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.  I&#39;m totally lost.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is an instructional DVD about how to play Yu-gi-oh -- we got it<br/>
packaged in when we bought something else, but I bet if you asked at<br/>
your toy store, they could tell you if it was sold alone or which<br/>
things you would need to buy in order to get it.  It&#39;s very easy to<br/>
follow.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you rent or buy the first few episodes of the show, they talk<br/>
a *lot* about how to play the game.  We picked up most of our<br/>
knowledge from there, then just filled in with the rules.<br/>
<br/>
Starter Decks  -- The Kaiba Evolution deck plays very well, as does<br/>
the new Zombie Structure deck (the last is really hard to beat).  But<br/>
what you want as far as a deck will also depend on what characters and<br/>
monsters your child likes.  For example, if he&#39;s dying to have a Dark<br/>
Magician, you need the Yugi deck. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a website with the card lists for all the starter decks:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yugiohcardguide.com/">http://www.yugiohcardguide.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
The starter decks are only enough for one person, so make sure to get<br/>
two decks so you can both play. <br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s fun to get a few booster packs as well, so you can start<br/>
playing with expanding and tweaking a deck. <br/>
<br/>

getting into it.  I just love that kid&#39;s hair. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

This is the official Yu-gi-oh trading card site, and if you click<br/>
Training, and scroll through the text rules, you&#39;ll find video<br/>
segments of how to play each phase of a turn.<br/>

playing it for awhile I really had a good feel for the rules.  The <br/>
cartoon does explain the rules, but they cheat a lot, no big deal if <br/>
he is just going to duel you, but if he ever wants to go to a <br/>
tournament, he&#39;ll need to know the &quot;real&quot; rules.  My husband was able <br/>
to find a game online where you duel Yugi, it is called Yugi The <br/>
Destiny.  If you can find it, it would be a good way to learn to play <br/>
too.<br/>

Richard (9) has Yugi the Destiny for PC, he used to play it daily, he loves it and he learned the rules quickly.  I believe that you can play online but Richard never did, just against the computer.  There is also another PC game out now, Kaiba maybe?  Richard is a little less into YuGiOh now so I am not sure.  <br/>
