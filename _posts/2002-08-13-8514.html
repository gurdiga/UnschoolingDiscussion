unexpectedly (she was napping) came into the kitchen where my husband <br/>
was doing the dishes and watching The Exorcist--just at one of the more <br/>
graphic Linda Blair scenes. She was terribly unpset and talked about it <br/>
for ages afterwards.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445742869">I didn&#39;t like this either.  But then I never liked<br/>
haunted houses or horror movies.  I&#39;m not a timid<br/>
person and I do take calculated risks.  I love roller<br/>
coasters, and used to ski very fast.  I have often<br/>
been sailing in high wind in the San Francisco Bay<br/>
(which anyone who has done it knows is not as tame as<br/>
it sounds).  <br/>
<br/>
I think the folks who got upset on the other lists<br/>
must have likely been responding to the adrenaline<br/>
rush in a self protective/defensive way.  I don&#39;t like<br/>
to be startled either.<br/>
<br/>
That brings up an entire other line of discussion<br/>
though.  WHY do some people like to be startled and<br/>
others do not?  The theory of the startle/adrenaline<br/>
rush attraction is that it is a &quot;safe&quot; thrill,<br/>
intellectually you know there is no danger and so<br/>
people enjoy the &quot;thrill&quot; of the biochemical reaction<br/>
to scary movies and the like.  On the other hand you<br/>
have the thrill seekers, who do things with great<br/>
elements of danger (racing, jumping out of/off of<br/>
things, etc) consistently.  These are not safe<br/>
activities, so the adrenal rish is that much greater,<br/>
and the psycological thrill which accompanies it. <br/>
Some people have a greater need or desire for that<br/>
feeling, and so seek those situations.  The gene<br/>
mapping scientists have found a &quot;danger seeking gene&quot;<br/>
which some people carry and others do not.  That&#39;s a<br/>
good thing.  We need both kinds of folks.<br/>
<br/>
But what about this kind of thing, this simple<br/>
startle?  What bothers me and some other people about<br/>
it?  Why does it upset me to be unsettled, off<br/>
balance, and nervy/jumpy, to feel that adrenal rush<br/>
tingling through my body and my heart pounding?  My<br/>
own theory has to do with my upbringing.  Having many<br/>
bad associations with adrenaline rushes early on (like<br/>
violence at or around me) and a great deal of stress<br/>
and childhood depression left me ill equipped to deal<br/>
with stressful situations in adulthood.  I feel that<br/>
it is a great handicap.  I don&#39;t like not being able<br/>
to handle stress and emotional situations without<br/>
being hard pressed to maintain some sort of composure.<br/>
 I think it is important to protect children from too<br/>
much stress and fear.  The more secure and happy a<br/>
childhood, the stronger the adult.  We all know that a<br/>
baby left to cry is afraid, insecure, unsure of their<br/>
safety and caretaking.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like to be scared.  In fact I hate to be<br/>
scared.  There have been so many real and shadow fears<br/>
in my life that I actively seek to avoid more.  I<br/>
don&#39;t read scary books, don&#39;t like disturbing movies,<br/>
don&#39;t like to be startled.  I am still afraid of the<br/>
dark, though I love the night.  I ocassionally have<br/>
that ankle-grabbing-under-the-bed-monster fear, or the<br/>
following-you-in-the-dark-hallway fear.  I still have<br/>
nightmares, although they are MUCH reduced in the last<br/>
5 years.  Maybe there will come a time when I can<br/>
handle a startle better, or even find it amusing.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know.<br/>

<br/>
There was a time in human history when if we weren&#39;t always paying<br/>
attention, always alert, we could become the lunch of a hungry predator.<br/>
A startle is a rude awakening that we let our defenses down and shouldn&#39;t<br/>
have.<br/>
A startle like that a long time ago could have been the begining of the<br/>
natural conclusion to a fatal mistake on our part.  <br/>
We still have a lot of these left overs.  That &quot;gut&quot; feeling that<br/>
something is wrong,  the hair on the back or our necks standing up.  I<br/>
think startle reflex is among those.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-926509391">i agree, nancy...this thing startled me (and my partner) badly.  i don&#39;t purposefully startle/scare my children or anyone else, and i don&#39;t appreciate being startled/scared just through reading my emails!  i&#39;m very sensitive to the emotional/physical/energetic reactions that this kind of thing can create in people....it upset me emotionally and gave me a bad headache too.<br/>
<br/>
i didn&#39;t have a violent upbringing, so i can&#39;t attribute my sensitivity to that.  but i do think some people are just sensitive.  mostly i don&#39;t think that&#39;s a bad thing, and as a massage therapist, i think it serves me well.  but i would like it to be respected, even just theoretically, and sincerely hope that i don&#39;t encounter anything similar to this on an email list again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-664466147">My first reaction was a jump but then I laughed too.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We were at California Adventure yesterday.  I love California Screaming, <br/>
the coaster that goes from 1-60 mph in like 5 seconds and then goes <br/>
upside down.  But I also hate it.  I can&#39;t have the restraint too tight, <br/>
when I sit down and put the restraint on I get very anxious. Wanna get <br/>
off but Lexie&#39;s usually next to me and I can&#39;t.  I have probably <br/>
breathing as we pull out and to the place where they make you wait <br/>
anxously until it takes off.  There is no warning, or anything, you just <br/>
go from standing still to really fast quick.  At the top of the first <br/>
hill, I can enjoy myself, even put my hands in the air and laugh and <br/>
have fun, but man, the first time I do the ride I&#39;m scared to death. <br/>
 Each visit, the first time is horrid.  But the 2nd... I don&#39;t go <br/>
through any of this.  strange.  <br/>
<br/>
But I like a minor scare.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945869833">I think tha children trying new foods has a litttle<br/>
bit to do with security and trust.  Trust  that<br/>
parents won&#39;t force them to consume things unwholesome<br/>
 or bad tasting or nasty or from the family pet. <br/>
Trust that it is OK to like some things and not others<br/>
and trust that if they want to spit it out, it isn&#39;t<br/>
the end of the world. Security that even if they don&#39;t<br/>
like the newly introduced flavor they won&#39;t have to<br/>
suffer hunger pangs for very long...and especially<br/>
won&#39;t have to suffer hunger as a punishment. Or have<br/>
to suffer over-full as a punishment. An equally<br/>
horrible feeling.<br/>
<br/>
New tastes are like new music....I think....sometimes<br/>
it takes a moment to get the rythem.<br/>

just<br/>

around the<br/>
