now, if I even get a hint of the taste of liver, I gag. I am blessed with a <br/>
7yr old who has a huge gag reflex. If he even thinks he might not like <br/>
something, up it comes. Needless to say, I do not try to force stuff on him. <br/>
Not that I would anyways.<br/>
Perhaps we were totured by our parents in order to save our children the <br/>
same fate?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I never was made to eat anything I didn&#39;t want to. I certainly never <br/>
made any of my kids do that either. Even with Tara &lt;bg&gt; although I worried <br/>
when she was little as to what she ate and wouldn&#39;t eat. Some people here <br/>
say the reason they wouldn&#39;t make their child eat something they didn&#39;t want <br/>
is because they were forced and know how awful it is. I&#39;m wondering about <br/>
the people who do force their kids? What could possibly be the reason <br/>
someone would force someone else to eat something they didn&#39;t like? Just <br/>
seems so clear to me not to do it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I take care of a 5yr old girl my friends recently adopted. This little person <br/>
is forced to eat all her lunch, she told my son. He brings it up every day, <br/>
obviously really bothers him. Her new parents use a lot of control and power <br/>
in raising her, and it seems as though the compulsory eating has to do with <br/>
the &quot;do as you are told&quot; mentality. <br/>
The little girl has food issues here, and so I have filled a basket with <br/>
healthy snacks, and some not so healthy ones, and put it in the fridge. She <br/>
is welcome to help herself at anytime, and after 3 months she still runs to <br/>
the fridge first thing and checks the basket and Still asks repeatedly if <br/>
it&#39;s ok if she eats the things in it.<br/>
