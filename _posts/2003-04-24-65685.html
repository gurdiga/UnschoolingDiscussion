<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184438224">(here&#39;s a little exerpt from an email I&#39;ve sent out regarding this <br/>
show)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The O&#39;Keefes&quot; is making a mockery of homeschoolers, and causing <br/>
great distress in the homeschool world, who has yet to overcome many <br/>
of the sterreotypes without this added publicly presented bias.<br/>
<br/>
I am very upset at this show being allowed to air.  The pilot ideas <br/>
presented should have been regarded as politically incorrect from the <br/>
conception of such a misguided idea.<br/>
<br/>
We can look forward to more misconceptions and bias from misinformed <br/>
people from that point forward.  It&#39;s bad enough having to deal with <br/>
folks who know little or nothing about homeschooling let alone those <br/>
who are made to think something entirely wrong. Easier to guide than <br/>
to reteach. And homeschooling is so diverse in it&#39;s own right, as <br/>
there are so many ways to parent a child as to &quot;teach at home&quot;.  The <br/>
show will not only point reference to the children being incapable of <br/>
social interaction but also create an equally wrong assumption that <br/>
that homeschooling depicted on the show is &quot;textbook&quot; to <br/>
homeschooling at all.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling is not so well known as the plight of other races, <br/>
religions, et/cetera who have also had to struggle to gain <br/>
understanding and acceptance and avoidance of stereotyping.  <br/>
Homeschooling as we know it now, still in it&#39;s modern-day infancy, <br/>
will need every effort from every person to off-set those attempts to <br/>
ill-inform the populous. <br/>
<br/>
WB, though never a favourite in our home, is even less popular with <br/>
us for having allowed such a thing to air at all. I have seen shows <br/>
that depict people who live in trailer parks as trash and Catholics <br/>
as statue toting weirdos, and witches who fly around on brooms and <br/>
just about every ridiculous stereotype.  It is out there and does <br/>
abound because such a mockery of diversity is still existant in the <br/>
world at large. And America being such a great &quot;melting pot&quot; there is <br/>
a lot for bias persons to mock. <br/>
<br/>
This one hits home.  It&#39;s not nice to label anyone. And, being on <br/>
such a broad scale WB should know better.</div>

 </span></blockquote>During the race, the now new SC governor was considering homeschooling his <br/>
children. The &quot;mansion&quot; is downtown in a bad school district---and there&#39;s <br/>
ALWAYS a question of where the gov will send his kids to school! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Well, as SOON as he mentioned the possibility, the tv ads started popping up! <br/>
There was an over-stereotypical &quot;white trash&quot; couple sitting in their mobile <br/>
home living room discussing the candidate&#39;s homeschooling: &quot;That Sanders sez <br/>
that if&#39;n he&#39;s &#39;lected, he&#39;s gonna HOMEschool his chirrun! Ken you belIEVE <br/>
that the guvner would HOMEschool his chirrun? GAWSH! Maybe awr schools aren&#39;t <br/>
GOOD enuff fer him. Maybe they ain&#39;t good enuff fer US! Maybe we otta <br/>
&quot;TRAILER&quot;-school little Bubba!&quot; Guffaws of laughter follow. And then the ad <br/>
for the other candidate....<br/>
<br/>
Sanders WAS elected. And he decided to send his kids to the private school! <br/>
<br/>
Wimp! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen &quot;The O&#39;keefe&#39;s&quot; I didn&#39;t realize it was on yet.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll wait to see it before I start bitching.<br/>
<br/>
My concern with sending out letters (to tv execs, etc.) is that they should <br/>
be proofread, spell-checked and maybe grammar-checked. If that was THE letter <br/>
that went out, it could be used as more ammo! <br/>

The word is &quot;populace.&quot;  &quot;Populous&quot; is another word entirely.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Writing like this won&#39;t impress people who don&#39;t like homeschooling already.<br/>
<br/>
If homeschoolers don&#39;t roll with real life, we&#39;ll be GUILTY (not just <br/>
accused) of avoiding real life.  People are made fun of on TV.  In movies.  <br/>
In magazines.  It&#39;s not great, but humor aimed at groups been going on since <br/>
before the written word.  <br/>

<br/>
The idea of witches flying on brooms MUCH predates the very staid and <br/>
self-serious wiccans of today, many of whom seem unaware of the history of <br/>
their own &quot;religion.&quot;  Has the author of this never lived in a mobile home or <br/>
had &quot;trailer trash&quot; relatives?  I have done both.   Many normal Catholics DO <br/>
have some statue-toting fact about them, inside the house, inside the car, <br/>
sometimes St. Anthony buried in the back yard.  Head down.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This one hits home.  It&#39;s not nice to label anyone. And, being on <br/>

<br/>
How would sitcoms operate if they made fun of NOBODY?<br/>

I think you are referring to St. Joseph.  I learned this last year when<br/>
we moved.   Something about burying St.Joseph head down or toward the<br/>
house.  He is patron of homes and families,  so this is generally used<br/>
when a family is moving.  Then you are supposed to dig him up when the<br/>
house is sold and bring him to your new home,  displaying him in a place<br/>
of honor.  Kind of a way of asking him to intercede in asking blessings<br/>
upon your family and your new home.   Apparently it&#39;s big around here<br/>
(Greater Cincinnati area),  though I never heard of it until last year. <br/>

<br/>
St. Anthony to find lost things.   This was from Chicago area.  Pray to him <br/>
if you lose something.  If you don&#39;t find it, pray again and bury the statue <br/>
in the yard.  If THAT doesn&#39;t work, third phase is dig him up and bury him <br/>
head down.  <br/>

statues.  There was an article that referred to burying St. Joseph being<br/>
a Chicago tradition.  I used &quot;buryint st. statue traditions&quot;  and<br/>
burying st Anthony atatue&quot; to search.<br/>
