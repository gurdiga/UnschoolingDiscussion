<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806724939">To be nobody-but-yourself--in a world which is doing its best night and day,<br/>
to make you everybody else--means to fight the hardest battle which any<br/>
human being can fight; and never stop fighting. -- e.e. cummings<br/>
<br/>
It takes courage to grow up and turn out to be who you really are. -- e.e.<br/>
cummings<br/>
<br/>
This is why it&#39;s so important to root out any generic dreams you may have,<br/>
and replace them with your own dreams.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363881528">I must have deleted John&#39;s post about higher education, but want to<br/>
respond.  I have a friend whose father insisted they learn a trade first,<br/>
so she went to beauty school.  Later, she earned a degree in psychology. <br/>
Now she is staying at home with her three year old daughter and cutting<br/>
hair, doing perms, etc. in her home while her daughter is there with her.<br/>
 I have her cut my hair.  It is so much easier to get a haircut when I<br/>
can bring my kids along and not have to worry about them being in the<br/>
way.  Plus, she gets to keep all the money - doesn&#39;t have to share it<br/>
with a shop.<br/>
So here is my fantasy:  I&#39;m an expert in auto mechanics and I do tune-ups<br/>
& oil changes in people&#39;s own garage.  They know that my children will be<br/>
with me.  Or if they prefer, they can come to my house and their kids can<br/>
play with mine while I do the job. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-670345663">It can be a reality, we have one here in town and there was one where we<br/>
use to live.  The one here calls himself &quot;The Car Doctor&quot; and I think his<br/>
van says something like &quot;The only doctor that still makes house calls.&quot;<br/>
