Socially and culturally, I love it too.  Anyone ever<br/>
been to a midnite showing of it where people dress up<br/>
and bring props and throw things and say the lines,<br/>

Used to do it all the time as a teenager, gotta find<br/>
out where/when it&#39;s being done and go again.  <br/>

Used to do that a lot....then a couple years ago we took Julian and his best <br/>
friend, Nick. They were 12. It had gotten a lot racier. The first thing they <br/>
did, before the movie started, was invite women to come up and show their <br/>
thongs.<br/>
<br/>
I turned to Nick and said, &quot;I am SO glad I asked your mom before bring you <br/>
here!&quot; He cracked up.<br/>
<br/>
But we all had a blast. The boys blushed, but they were fine.<br/>

We took Holly a few years back, too.  It was nasty.  There were four adults <br/>
there she knew, and she went back and between where Wendy and I were, and the <br/>
couple she knew, when she was bored.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s different theater to theater (and night to night sometimes), but I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t recommend the going in person anymore.  Whatever you might&#39;ve expected, it <br/>
probably won&#39;t be as cool, or peaceful, or movie-related.<br/>
<br/>
But the video itself is quiet and relatively peaceful. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Ours involved licking chocolate syrup off a teenaged girl who hadn&#39;t seen the <br/>
movie before.  And a guy with a backpack water walking up the aisles spraying <br/>
people during  the rain storm.<br/>
<br/>
But we saw it live, and they had little packets of stuff to throw and do.  A <br/>
light stick.  Two cards.  About three squares of toilet paper. One sheet of <br/>
newspaper.  In the olden times, people flipped up half a deck of cards EACH on <br/>
each half of the cards verse.  Pieces of toast.  Rice.   Lighters for &quot;there&#39;s <br/>
a light.&quot;  And HOW could a theater catch fire if every patron has a full <br/>
squirt gun? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But the good old days are gone.<br/>

Repertory Theatre.  It was great.  Most people dressed, and the only <br/>
thing I would have felt even vaguely uncomfortable with with friends <br/>
was the black V on my forehead (for Rocky Horror Virgin).  I guess <br/>
it would be a good idea to screen before taking along your kiddos, <br/>
or call ahead and talk to the theater.  Another idea is having your <br/>
own Rocky Horror movie night where you did your own theatrics; there <br/>
are detailed scripts online.  <br/>

someone has the perfect verses in their heads.  A psalm or something <br/>

If they&#39;re very religious and well-read,  then try to use a Catholic Bible <br/>
for quoting.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re doing a really sweet thing.  I hope people are able to help you find <br/>
something perfect.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-310596551">***Another idea is having your own Rocky Horror movie night where <br/>
you did your own theatrics***<br/>
<br/>
This is a great idea.  We&#39;ve been Rocky Horror fans at my house for <br/>
years and I have the tape.  When I found out that it was playing at <br/>
a theater close enough to go, Erica who was 13 at the time and I <br/>
went.  The theater we went to wasn&#39;t as risque as the ones Kathryn <br/>
and Sandra went to, but it was the original, uncut movie.  You could <br/>
see lots of body and pubic hair on Frankenfurter and on the one I <br/>
have at home you can&#39;t.  It was airbrushed out.  The scene with <br/>
Frankie and Janet in bed, then Frankie and Brad was cut short in the <br/>
home version, too.  It is still there, but it moves so quickly to <br/>
the next scene that you don&#39;t think about it much.  It was a cool <br/>
experience seeing it in a theater, but I think we&#39;ll wait until <br/>
Erica&#39;s older to see it there again.  <br/>
