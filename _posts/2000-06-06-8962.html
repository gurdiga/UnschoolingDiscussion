Ruth Beechick&#39;s great little books are a set of 3 small books: A Home Start<br/>
in Reading, An Easy Start in Arithmetic, and A Strong Start in Language.<br/>
All are written for grades K-3, are about 30 pages long and give practical<br/>
advice on how to start.  You can find them in just about any homeschool<br/>
catalog (www.rainbowresource.com, www.lifetimeonline.com)  The BOB books are<br/>
small paperback books that come in sets of 6-8.  Each book introduces 3-5<br/>
letters/sounds.  They have cute pictures to go with the &quot;story&quot;.  You can<br/>
find them at any bookstore, I think even Target has them.<br/>
<br/>
We have always read to our children, daily.  I think that gives them a very<br/>
strong start, as they love to read.  When Dillon seemed like he was<br/>
beginning to try to read I began by introducing sounds of letters (he had<br/>
known his ABC&#39;s for a long time).  I actually began with his name,<br/>
introduced the D sound & showed him other words with the D sound.  The we<br/>
used to BOB books which introduce 2-3 new sounds (phonics) with each book.<br/>
We went through 2 sets of BOB books, doing 1-3 a day.  Once he got that far<br/>
he understood what we were doing as far as decoding, so I began to introduce<br/>
real books.....books he had enjoyed me reading to him like Mercer Mayer&#39;s<br/>
Little Critter books.  Then we progressed to Henry & Mudge type books and<br/>
other &quot;reading&quot; chapter books.  Now he reads whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I think it very important to know when the child is ready not only to begin,<br/>
but when the child is ready to move out of the instructional mode into<br/>
actual reading.  That leaves the pleasure in reading rather than making it a<br/>
lesson.  We did not cover every letter sound before beginning to read, to<br/>
have done that would have spoiled the excitement of learning to read.  We<br/>
did have a time daily when Dillon would read to me, so I could help with the<br/>
decoding and letters sounds we had not &quot;done&quot; yet....also it let me see how<br/>
he was progressing.  He rarely reads to me now but reads to his little<br/>
sister a lot.<br/>
<br/>
As far as phonics vs whole language or site reading, that depends on the<br/>
child.  Some pick it up easily with just phonics, others will be later<br/>
readers using site words.  Other use a combination hence whole language.<br/>
You just have to try one & see how the child does to know which will suit<br/>
her.<br/>
