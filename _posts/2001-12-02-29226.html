<br/>
 </span></blockquote>1 C applesauce smooth variety<br/>
1 1/2 C cinnamon<br/>
<br/>
Some recipes call for glue the one I have doesn&#39;t. We<br/>
still have some of our cinnamin ornaments from three<br/>
years ago. I don&#39;t think you have to have it. <br/>
<br/>
Combine the applesauce with one cup cinnamon until<br/>
well mixed. Add cinnamon a teaspoon at a time until it<br/>
has a firm consistency so its easy to roll out but not<br/>
dry. If I remember correctly I didn&#39;t need all my<br/>
cinnamon the first time I did it. I found that it work<br/>
better to only cut a few at a time. <br/>
<br/>
Small cookie cutters work best. I have successfully<br/>
done some medium sized ones. Prick a hole in the<br/>
cookie of you want to hang them with a toothpick. Cook<br/>
them in an oven at the lowest temperature for about<br/>
two hours. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906010555">We&#39;ve used two different recipes (one with glue, one without) but the<br/>
kidlets and I like this one the best.<br/>
<br/>
Lynda<br/>
========<br/>
Cinnamon Ornaments<br/>
<br/>
1 1/4 cups flour<br/>
 3/4 cups mixture of cinnamon and cloves, ground up<br/>
1 cup salt<br/>
1 cup water<br/>
<br/>
Pparchment paper or paper bag cut to size of your cookie sheet.  The 3/4 cup<br/>
of spices can be changed to a spice or spices of your own choice. Use about<br/>
1/2 clove and 1/2 cinnamon to make 3/4 cup of spices.<br/>
<br/>
Mix all ingredients together and knead. If it gets to sticky add more spice,<br/>
not the flour.<br/>
<br/>
 Roll dough out on a well powdered surface using cinnamon not flour.  Roll<br/>
to 1/2 inch thickness and cut with any cookie cutter of your choice.<br/>
<br/>
 Poke a small hole in the top of each ornament for hanging on tree (a wooden<br/>
shish kabob stick works well). Place on baking sheet covered with parchment<br/>
paper or paper bag.<br/>
<br/>
Lightly sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake at 350F for about 25 minutes (Time may<br/>
vary -- depending on your oven and thickness of ornament)<br/>
<br/>
When cool, you can paint and coat with spray acrylic finish. This will cut<br/>
down of the fragrance if you spray it with the finish.<br/>
<br/>
 I usually get about 24 little ornaments out of one batch. I have small 1<br/>
inch gingerbread man and stars that eldest son made me which we use for<br/>
small size trees. For a regular size tree a normal size cookie cutter works<br/>
best.  One year the kidlets made designs and cut the shapes out with one of<br/>
those wire things that folks who work in clay use.<br/>
