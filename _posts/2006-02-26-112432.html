<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149804235">I&#39;m trying to find a show-hoping for DVD or even video-that I loved as a kid <br/>
and would love to share with my kids. It was on around 1974-77 (not sure if it <br/>
was on longer), I happened to see it in my English class once a week-it may <br/>
have been recorded (could they do that in the mid &#39;70s?), may have been live... <br/>
I believe it was a PBS show. It dealt with Latin prefixes and suffixes (I <br/>
think-it was definitely word parts and their history and meanings), my memory is <br/>
bringing up &quot;Word Smith&quot; as the name, but I&#39;m not sure. The guy that &quot;hosted&quot; <br/>
the show had the word parts on  3-4&quot; white balls which he dropped into this <br/>
very 70&#39;s looking ball-on-a-pedestal (or maybe he started with them there-I just <br/>
remember the funny slide-whistle sound when he dropped the word-ball for <br/>
viewing or when it was finished) sculpture thing.... That&#39;s about as much detail <br/>
as I can remember. I could probably search for it if I had the name, but I&#39;ve <br/>
looked briefly under &quot;word smith&quot; and found zilch. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone else remember that show? I know that no one I&#39;ve talked to around here <br/>
has any CLUE what I&#39;m talking about :~)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
