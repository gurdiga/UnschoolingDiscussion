&lt;&lt; arcie,  After reading your post, I want to share that I ,too, was a <br/>
teacher. <br/>
  I know exactly what you are saying about being able to change.  I want to <br/>
be <br/>
 able to trust the kids,too, but it is very difficult.  It is as if we, the <br/>
 ex-teachers , need the de-schooling.  All the yrs as children in schools, <br/>
 then college, then teaching in the schools adds up to alot to shut out of a <br/>
 person&#39;s mind, no matter how much other philophies make sense.  I have read <br/>
 Holt, and agree with most everything I have read.  He,too, was a teacher; <br/>
 however, I don&#39;t think he was a parent.  My point is that living with <br/>
 children 24hrs a day, 7 days a week, is different than being with them for <br/>
 prescribed hours each day.  When I taught, I was not a parent.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
Karen, what a great post!  I am so glad that we can share our challenges <br/>
here.  <br/>
<br/>
I was also the one in my family who needed deschooling, along with my oldest <br/>
daughter, who had a very traumatic 4th grade year in our highly rated public <br/>
school system.  I still deal with my own parents (who moved south this year, <br/>
fortunately) who were both educators and strongly oppose our home schooling.  <br/>
The distance has helped, as has John and I gaining confidence in what we&#39;re <br/>
doing.  <br/>
<br/>
We knew over a year ago that we were going to home school, because we needed <br/>
something better for our oldest.  The funny thing is that our middle daughter <br/>
would have had big problems in school this year, I think.  She is a born <br/>
unschooler if there ever was one.  Very self-directed, very much a homebody, <br/>
yet a leader and very independent in social situations.  And I think that&#39;s <br/>
because she is comfortable with herself and doesn&#39;t need friends to feel <br/>
complete.  Of course, she is the one that people are drawn to and she has <br/>
many friends.  But she simply cannot be forced to do anything she doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to do.  She&#39;ll say &quot;sure&quot; or &quot;yes, ma&#39;am&quot; and blow it off.  And, at 6, <br/>
she is reading (can you believe this??) at a 6th or 7th grade level.  No one <br/>
taught her phonics, no one knows how she learned to read,  she won&#39;t do the <br/>
spelling workbooks I have for her, but her reading, vocabulary, and writing <br/>
(when she wants it to be), are amazing.  John and I catch ourselves all the <br/>
time, because it&#39;s very hard to remember that she is only 6.<br/>
<br/>
What an incredible time this has become for me.  I think that I am the one <br/>
who is benefiting most from our unschooling adventure!<br/>
