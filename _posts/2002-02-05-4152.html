<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191812489">Well, it&#39;s one of them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m grumpy with Angelfire (and I suppose they were grumpy with me first! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;), so as I&#39;m putting all my stuff on a geocities site, I came across this, <br/>
which I don&#39;t really need at the new site, so I figured rather than just lose <br/>
it forever, I&#39;d deposit it here! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The links were some of mine, some of other people&#39;s, as usual.<br/>
<br/>
My Favorite things about Unschooling <br/>
<br/>
*   You can do it at home! <br/>
*   Your kids are there! <br/>
*   It makes all of life a peaceful learning lab. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a subset of homeschooling. Unschooling is the radical, <br/>
philosophical end of homeschooling. Unschooling is living a rich life and <br/>
letting learning drop into your lap and into your ears and mind while you <br/>
laugh and listen to music and play games. Unschooling is seeing the magic in <br/>
every day, and the joy in yourself and the people around you. If your <br/>
children don&#39;t go to school, why should you bring school home? Be free! There <br/>
is nothing in school that isn&#39;t also in the real world. (And if there IS, why <br/>
would you be needing to know it if it doesn&#39;t exist outside?) Use primary <br/>
sources, not textbooks. Look at real nature, not photos of nature in a book.<br/>
---------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here is bored and wants to help me iron out glitches in links on <br/>
the rabbit-warren of unschooling stuff which begins at sandradodd.com, I&#39;d <br/>
appreciate the help.  If you have better things to do, I TOTALLY understand <br/>
that! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
(If anything links to an expage.com page with advertisements, that is a <br/>
glitch.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, but I have to pay $9 a month protection money.<br/>
I&#39;ve put almost everything I ever wrote (well... some stuff) and haven&#39;t used <br/>
up 2% of my $9 a month storage space, but at least there aren&#39;t <br/>
advertisements.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s through geocities/yahoo.<br/>
