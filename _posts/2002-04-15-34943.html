<div id="ygrps-yiv-637892595">For what it is worth I do not even get t.v. reception.  When I do I watch<br/>
one or two shows a week maybe.<br/>
<br/>
There is far more crime going on than they can fit in the news.  When my<br/>
daughter and I were sitting in her living room and the front door came down<br/>
frame and all and there were two men standing there with shotguns pointed at<br/>
us, that was not in the news.  When my other daughter was raped, that was<br/>
not in the news.  When the crack heads down the road busted down my front<br/>
door and stold all the food and baby things, that was not in the news, when<br/>
a drive by shooter fired a shot that embedded in the chair 6 inches from my<br/>
heart, that was not in the news.  3 months ago another daughters car was<br/>
stolen and that was not in the news.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is this......you think the crime rate is down and I think it is<br/>
not.  I don&#39;t trust what the news says and I don&#39;t trust what the law<br/>
enforcement agencies say and my brother is a member of the secret service<br/>
and I do not trust what the government says.  Some of us have had far<br/>
broader lives than others and you will never change my mind or convince me.<br/>
My life has been on the line too  many times.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway this is an unschooling list not a crime analysis list and I have had<br/>
enough of this particular subject.<br/>

Perhaps your personal incidents weren&#39;t on the TV news, but were they <br/>
reported to the police?  Statistics don&#39;t come from TV news.<br/>
<br/>
My mother was raped by her brother.  That wasn&#39;t reported to the police.<br/>
<br/>
My sister was raped at knifepoint by two 20ish guys who raped several other <br/>
girls and one was eventually imprisoned.  But she didn&#39;t report it because <br/>
they threatened her younger friend who wasn&#39;t even her boyfriend.  She was 14.<br/>
<br/>
I had a bookbag stolen with a new, maple alto recorder in it once.<br/>
My husband, as a teen, had an druggie ex-roommate steal all his albums to <br/>
pawn.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not been crime in my life.  Either I lucked out or was careful or had <br/>
good karma or none of the above.  <br/>
<br/>
But the lack of crime in my life could be totally random, and it doesn&#39;t <br/>
affect the statistics.<br/>
<br/>
Is a crime-hampered life really broader?  Maybe the resultant fear would make <br/>
it smaller.<br/>
<br/>
If others had &quot;broader lives&quot; would their personal stats match govt. stats <br/>
better?<br/>

<br/>
This is a detailed description of the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting <br/>
methodology. Here is one interesting bit from it: &gt;&gt;Based on records of all <br/>
reports of crime received from victims, officers who discover infractions, or <br/>
other sources, law enforcement agencies across the country tabulate the <br/>
number of Crime Index or Part I offenses brought to their attention each <br/>
month. Specifically, the crimes reported to the FBI are murder and <br/>
nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, <br/>
burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever complaints of crime are determined through investigation to be <br/>
unfounded or false, they are eliminated from an agency&#39;s count. The number of <br/>
&quot;actual offenses known&quot; is reported to the FBI regardless of whether anyone <br/>
is arrested for the crime, stolen property is recovered, or prosecution is <br/>
undertaken.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot more - they make herculean attempts to keep the statistics <br/>
consistent - the whole point is to be able to make comparisons over time. The <br/>
trends, especially very noticeable ones, such as the decreased violent crime <br/>
rate over the last decade, are probably quite accurate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881630184">Crime hampered life?  That is a pretty ugly thing to say I think.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say my life had been broader BECAUSE I had been a victim of crime.<br/>
<br/>
I will not participate in one of these pointless timewasting debates.  And I<br/>
will not sit and trade insults with you either.<br/>
