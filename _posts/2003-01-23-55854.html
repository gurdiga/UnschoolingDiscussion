<div id="ygrps-yiv-480418911">I just thought it would be fun to sending greetings to all my friends <br/>
from Aramango! This is in northwest Italy (not too far from Turin), <br/>
in the Piemontese region. (Go get out those maps!) An interesting <br/>
place, especially because folks don&#39;t really speak Italian, but a <br/>
local dialect (Piemontese) -- doesn&#39;t matter much to me, as I speak <br/>
neither!<br/>
 <br/>
So what am I doing here?<br/>
<br/>
Having completed my new homeschooling book (Homeschooling and the <br/>
Voyage of Self-Discovery -- out March 1, you can read a little bit <br/>
about it at www.skylarksings.com, though my site is also going <br/>
through an upgrade), and two books on the uses of storytelling --<br/>
&quot;The Healing Heart-Families: Storytelling to Encourage Resilient and <br/>
Healthy Families&quot; and &quot;The Healing Heart-Communities: Storytelling to <br/>
Build Strong and Health Communities&quot;, also out on March 1, I am in <br/>
Italy working with the original author to bring out an English <br/>
edition of a book about my Indian &quot;parents&quot; -- on their land reform <br/>
efforts, and their struggles against multinational prawn farming <br/>
interests that are destroying the coastal areas of south India. It is <br/>
a profound and very moving story, and I feel very privileged to be <br/>
involved in telling it! Last night, I got to address a group in <br/>
Milan -- there is quite a lot of interest in Fair Trade, <br/>
globalization, and third world issues here, and they were shocked <br/>
when I explained how ignorant about foreign issues the American <br/>
public is generally speaking. <br/>
<br/>
Public meetings here BEGIN at 9 o&#39;clock, and people bring their <br/>
children! (so I got to speak a little bit about homeschooling, too, <br/>
which is not unknown here, but relatively rare.) But mostly it was a <br/>
celebration of my parents work on land reform, community development <br/>
and child welfare.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers have been part of it, too. Last year, with royalties <br/>
from &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me&quot; and with contributions from <br/>
homeschoolers, we managed to purchased two cinderblock making <br/>
machines, so that people in this desperately poor area of South India <br/>
can build their own cyclone-proof housing (they formerly lived in rat-<br/>
infested mud and straw housing that would often be destroyed in <br/>
floods.) The local people make bricks, sell them into the cities at a <br/>
profit, and use the profits to buy more raw materials to build their <br/>
own homes. And since cinderblock doesn&#39;t require any firing (as do <br/>
more traditional bricks), it saves very scare lumber resources, and <br/>
is very good on the environment. We hope to build (or help people <br/>
themselves build) 10,000 homes -- these are people who were landless <br/>
laborers (from &quot;untouchable&quot;) castes for some 8 or 10 centuries, and <br/>
through land reform struggles, 10,000 families (70,000 people) now <br/>
have land. But the pollution of the land by multinational prawn <br/>
interests, backed by the World Bank, has been terrible!  We brought <br/>
plenty of pictures and slides.<br/>
<br/>
My mother also collects children -- by the side of the road, living <br/>
on the margins of garbage dumps, under bridges, and we now have about <br/>
140 children living in hostels in 3 locations. Most of them <br/>
are &quot;adopted&quot; (supported, not brought to Italy) by Italian aid <br/>
agencies, and many the donors were at my public meeting last night.<br/>
<br/>
So, for me, my work with homeschoolers and with social development in <br/>
India -- both among my great loves -- is coming together, and I feel <br/>
privileged to be allowed to be part of both of them. And I get to <br/>
drink wine and eat the most wonderful cheese. I&#39;m a lucky guy!</div>
