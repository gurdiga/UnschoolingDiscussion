&lt;&lt; I would say this is an accurate description of cigarette companies though. <br/>
 They ARE marketing to the younger crowd and taking advantage of the peer <br/>
pressure that goes on there. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids have three friends who smoke, each in a totally different social <br/>
group, each the only one in that group (at least to my own kids&#39; interface) who <br/>
smokes.<br/>
<br/>
One is 25, tattooed, rough-appearing and very mannerly and interesting.   The <br/>
others he knows all razz him.  He started smoking when he was in high school <br/>
and is an addict, but very considerate, considering.<br/>
<br/>
One is 15, has been in and out of homeschooling, has always been desperate to <br/>
be grown soon, now, since he was nine and we met him (so probably before <br/>
then).   Last year he went back to school, was put on Ritalin, and started <br/>
smoking.   Not because of advertising, because of trying to impress kids at school.<br/>
<br/>
The other is 18, started smoking because friends at school did (she always <br/>
went to school, her mom is a teacher), and has been smoking for three years <br/>
already.  Not because of advertising.<br/>
<br/>
My mom died last year, of lung and other organ problems blamed officially on <br/>
a lifetime of drinking and smoking.    She started smoking because a marriage <br/>
counsellor recommended it.  My parents were married almost four years before I <br/>
was born (I&#39;m oldest).    They had gone to a marriage counsellor and when she <br/>
complained that my dad would light a cigarette after dinner even before she <br/>
was through eating and the smoke kept her from enjoying the rest of her food.  <br/>
This professional they had paid money to told her that if she were to just <br/>
start smoking too, that cigarettes wouldn&#39;t bother her anymore, and that she <br/>
would have something else in common with her husband.<br/>
<br/>
Tobacco companies are competing for brand switchers.   Kids smoke because <br/>
other people smoke, not because of advertising.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I remember walking to school with my best friend at the time, Ellen, when I <br/>
was in the fourth grade.  I told Ellen that I would definitely be a smoker <br/>
when I got to be old enough because my parents both smoked and they were <br/>
very cool.  I was really impressed by my parents, smoking their Pall Mall <br/>
cigarettes.  I loved the way my mom&#39;s hand looked so graceful holding the <br/>
cigarette, and when she and my dad would rest their cigarettes in the <br/>
ashtray, the smoke looked so calm and pretty rising up from the burning <br/>
cigarette.  They were artsy folks, and they made these really cool ashtrays <br/>
and stuff like that.  I was completely sold!<br/>
<br/>
I started smoking when I was 13 years old because everyone else in my <br/>
circle at school did and I desperately wanted to be cool and fit in with <br/>
these folks, especially since I was convinced I was not all that cool and <br/>
smoking cigarettes would definitely help me become more cool.  I loved the <br/>
cigarette pack holders and the lighters and all that paraphernalia <br/>
stuff.  That&#39;s another reason why I smoked.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason I quit was because I perceived (don&#39;t know if it was really <br/>
true or not) that my vocal range was a little diminished, and messing up my <br/>
voice was one thing I could not and would not tolerate.  So, I quit &quot;cold <br/>
turkey&quot; and gave a brand-new carton of cigarettes to my friend when I was <br/>
20 years old.  Although I had tried and failed at quitting many times <br/>
before that, quitting then was the easiest thing for me because I was <br/>
really freaked out about my voice.  I never smoked again.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I enjoyed the cigarette (the jingles and stuff) advertisements, <br/>
they had absolutely nothing to do with me starting to smoke or continuing <br/>
to smoke (in fact, I really never got that business in the ads about <br/>
&quot;taste&quot;!).  To start smoking was entirely a decision I made because of the <br/>
people I admired.<br/>

I was wondering how well does advertising work on homeschooled kids who <br/>
are subject to waaaay less peer-pressure than schooled kids?  (typically)<br/>

**Like how come sometimes they left the turn signal<br/>
on after they&#39;d already made the turn?**<br/>
<br/>
I heard on Car Talk this weekend that in Germany people keep the left <br/>
turn signal on the whole time they are passing in the passing lane.  The <br/>
car hosts were suggesting that this is a good way to communicate with <br/>
the car behind us that tailgates and flashes its lights.  (If we adopted <br/>
the convention here.)</div>
