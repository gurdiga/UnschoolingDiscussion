 </span></blockquote>If we get an ant invasion, we sprinkle crushed and torn-up bay leaves <br/>
around the entire perimeter of the house.  It really does the trick; those <br/>
guys won&#39;t cross bay leaves.  They also won&#39;t cross cinnamon, but that&#39;s <br/>
messier.  Eventually, the ants stop coming.  It&#39;s not instantaneous, but <br/>
that&#39;s okay.  When I see ants on the counter, I collect them and <br/>
&quot;rehabilitate&quot; them.<br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t had a flea problem in years, and we believe it&#39;s because our <br/>
guys are healthy.  We give them a brewer&#39;s yeast and garlic supplement to <br/>
help with that, and it really seems to do the trick.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really like the idea of bay leaves and/or cinnamon.  In the past, I<br/>
have put a line of dish soap (like Ivory or Bi-O-Kleen) around the<br/>
kitchen (or whatever room the ants have invaded).  This works a lot and<br/>
the ants leave.<br/>
<br/>
I take out bugs, too, unless they are dangerous bugs (like scorpions-<br/>
haven&#39;t had one of those for a while, but I do kill them and it does<br/>
make me sad but I can&#39;t drive a half an hour away just to save a<br/>
scorpion).<br/>
