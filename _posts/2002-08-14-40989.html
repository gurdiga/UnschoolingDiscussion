<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659736736">**My school experience had the effect of alienating me from my parents. They<br/>
seemed to see themselves merely as the launchpad for me to be influenced<br/>
deeply by others. We ended up mostly estranged. But, in comparison to that,<br/>
Luz and I are incredibly close to our son -- he still wants us to be the<br/>
first to know his secrets. To me, that&#39;s a triumph and a treasure.**<br/>

Hi, Ned --<br/>
<br/>
I like the picture you paint of family closeness.  That&#39;s a major goal<br/>
in my life as well.<br/>
<br/>
Estrangement and distance in the family may not even be the worst<br/>
effects of schooling.  Having the parent be highly involved in the<br/>
schooling process and be the enforcer that makes the child do homework<br/>
may be even worse than having the parent be uninvolved.  The idea that<br/>
often a school parent may &quot;take sides&quot; and act in favor of the school<br/>
and against their own child is just repulsive to me.<br/>
<br/>
My bias is showing, but I find the stronger and stronger emphasis on<br/>
having very young children do homework to be hideous.  A good friend of<br/>
mine had her oldest in a full-day kindergarden that gave 5 homework<br/>
assignments per week.  Her son even had homework assigned during Xmas<br/>
vacation!  When I went to Kindergarden (nearly 40 years ago) I went to a<br/>
half day program, and we even took a daily nap.  There was certainly no<br/>
homework.  Seems like they think kids today are made of sterner stuff. <br/>
