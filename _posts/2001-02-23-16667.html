I would agree with this. It seems like &quot;schooled&quot; kids are always waiting for <br/>
someone to tell them what their next assignment is. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-634881408">It has always been someone whose kids go to school.  I think it scares them<br/>
to think kids don&#39;t need to be told what to do all the time.  My kids don&#39;t<br/>
get bored.  There&#39;s always something they are interested in doing, and they<br/>
have no problem just sitting and thinking sometimes.  I think if your whole<br/>
life is scheduled you never learn how to just be.  We&#39;re off to spend the<br/>
day with a schooled ten year old cousin and my sister who doesn&#39;t think we<br/>
do anything all day because our schedule doesn&#39;t compare to her daughter&#39;s 6<br/>
hours of gymnastics, 2 hours of skating, viola, trombone, and chorus<br/>
practice EACH WEEK!  Makes me tired just thinking about it. - Rue<br/>

most of the time......... I could offer all kids of suggestions and <br/>
outings, but she always said &quot;NO&quot;.<br/>
The boredom got less and less - and on the odd occasion she comes to <br/>
me and says she is bored, within 10mins I see her busy doing <br/>
something, which leads to some thing else which leads to some thing <br/>
else.<br/>
I do wonder if perhaps an only child gets bored easier.....<br/>

<br>
<br>They must. &nbsp;Their options are less than half of a child with one sibling, and 
<br>some mathematical relation I don&#39;t want to think about (because of the age 
<br>differences factors) from one with multiples.
<br>
<br>When Marty said &quot;bored&quot; it meant not only did he not want to interact with 
<br>Kirby (or vice versa) but that he wasn&#39;t sufficiently unhappy about that to 
<br>find something to do to prevent the very possibility of needing that 
<br>interaction.
<br>
<br>If one child doesn&#39;t want to play with another, it&#39;s often because they&#39;re 
<br>engrossed in a one-person activity. &nbsp;They don&#39;t need to go straight from a 
<br>one-person activity to another one-person activity, though. &nbsp;They get some 
<br>variation. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>I played with Kirby a LOT when he was little--board games, make believe, 
<br>running, ball, playgrounds. &nbsp;With Marty, I didn&#39;t need to. &nbsp;There was Kirby, 
<br>there were the younger siblings of friends of Kirby. &nbsp;There&#39;s some sort of 
<br>exponential thing that goes on, but I don&#39;t do math.
<br>
<br>I don&#39;t remember hearing &quot;bored&quot; from either of the boys for a long time.
<br>
<br>Holly, 9, being the youngest and only girl, says &quot;bored&quot; maybe once a month, 
<br>and I give her two or three suggestions, or in an extreme case (usually 
<br>compounded by some sort of unahppiness or disappointment) I give her a box of 
<br>my old stuff--buttons and sewing supplies, or souvenirs, or jewelry from her 
<br>great aunt. &nbsp;

<div id="ygrps-yiv-777395901">My dd gets bored but it has more to do with a lack of playmates.  She is <br/>
social to the extreme and thrives on interaction with other people.  When her <br/>
friends are in school or have too much homework to play she gets frustrated <br/>
and &quot;bored&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
However, I think it&#39;s good for her.  She has to push herself beyond just <br/>
complaining and satisfy her own need for stimulation.  It&#39;s something we all <br/>
have to do our entire lives.  She learns a lot about herself and what <br/>
captures her interest in these times.  I had to learn to let go of my <br/>
imagined responsibility for her boredom.  I&#39;ll offer suggestions and even <br/>
play with her if asked but I have to let her figure this out for herself.<br/>

<br/>
My four kids have never been to school and I very rarely hear that they are<br/>
bored. When they are I normally suggest they go lie on their beds and watch<br/>
the sky!<br/>
<br/>
If kids are never left to entertain themselves, their imagination muscle<br/>
atrophies I believe. The most creative times my children have had have<br/>
normally resulted from an extended period of &quot;boredom&#39;&quot;<br/>

I have 3 boys.  There is 4 and a half years between oldest and <br/>
youngest.  They very rarely got bored.  They had each other and each <br/>
others friends....... My youngest son is 18yrs older than dd.  so dd <br/>
is an only one.  I found it much easier having 3 close together than <br/>
one on her own!<br/>
marianne - who also has another dd. 8 yrs younger than youngest ds <br/>

My dd is the same.  She loves company.  Does have lots of friends - <br/>
but friends are at ps and do have home work.<br/>
AND like you I felt it was my job to solve her boredom - I dont <br/>
anymore - I do suggest things occasionally if I think she is REALLY <br/>
bored - but most times she does find some thing to do....<br/>
