&quot;Listen to your life. See it for the fathomless mystery that it<br/>
is.  In the boredom and pain of it no less than in the<br/>
excitement and gladness: touch, taste, smell your way to<br/>
the holy and hidden heart of it because in the last<br/>
analysis all moments are key moments, and life itself is<br/>
grace.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022628448">Hi Wendy,<br/>
<br/>
this is Stefanie from Germany. We are near Cologne and would be happy to <br/>
meet you. When are you leaving and where will you be stationed? I know <br/>
Brenda who is stationed near Frankfurt. Her 7yo is now in school, one of <br/>
the reasons (I think) being that they found it difficult to homeschool <br/>
with practically no other children around during the day. Hopefully <br/>
there will be a homeschooling community of some sorts at your base. As <br/>
others have mentioned, homeschooling is illegal in Germany, but these <br/>
laws won&#39;t apply for you. It just means, there won&#39;t be any German <br/>
homeschoolers to get together with. I would be happy to hear from you!<br/>
<br/>
All the best from Germany,<br/>
Stefanie<br/>
