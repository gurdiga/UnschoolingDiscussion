<div id="ygrps-yiv-909444245">We just started playing Quoridor and have been having a blast.  My <br/>
12yo dd is frightening good at it.  She beats us consistantly.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know the rules?  The rules that come with it are not <br/>
very detailed.  Is it allowed to jump someone &quot;around the corner?&quot;  <br/>
What happens when your only choices are to do that or move backwards.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>
<br/>
Tina</div>
