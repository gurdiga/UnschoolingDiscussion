<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289603472">My ds is 11, always sucked his thumb, probably will for the next who knows how many years. But as it&#39;s his thumb, and there is no sign that his teeth are going in any direction other than straight, I figure it&#39;s none of my business that he sucks his thumb.<br/>

We have been able to help him prepare a response to Rude Folk who even consider commenting on it. And do you know what - it&#39;s only those related by accident of birth who dare to say anything about it. But they only say it once. His response of - Thank you for your thoughts - tend stop them commenting further.<br/>

This line works on most things the Rude Folk tend to try and pass comment on with the way he lives his life.<br/>
