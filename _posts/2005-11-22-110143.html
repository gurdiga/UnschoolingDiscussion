<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654411881">&quot;Just because Sandra says her kids would never run away from home does <br/>
not<br/>
mean that they never would, nor that other unschool kids wouldn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really hard for me to wrap my mind around one of Sandra&#39;s kids <br/>
EVER running away. I can&#39;t imagine any child running away in a home <br/>
that lives the way we&#39;re advocating here.<br/>
<br/>
If Trevor really didn&#39;t want to live with us, I&#39;d help him find a way <br/>
to get out. He wouldn&#39;t NEED to run away. When you are your child&#39;s <br/>
advocate, when you want to help them get what they want, what would be <br/>
the motivation for running away?<br/>
<br/>
Running away is an ESCAPE. It&#39;s getting out of a situation you don&#39;t <br/>
feel  you have control over. I was a teen that wanted with all my <br/>
might to run away at times. My parents didn&#39;t do things at ALL the way <br/>
we advocate here. If that boy trusted his parents, if he knew they&#39;d <br/>
help him get what HE wanted, he wouldn&#39;t have left without telling <br/>
them. They broke his trust. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-304389174">Certainly true, and will always be true... but things can change, sometimes<br/>
in ways we cannot predict, given outside circumstances, mental illnesses,<br/>
new influences, etc.  Who is to say?  I am confident I can adapt to<br/>
anything, and offer a safe haven for my kids under all circumstances, but I<br/>
have seen enough and read enough biography and autobiography over the years<br/>
to know that shit happens.  I don&#39;t think it will ever happen to me either,<br/>
because it never has.  Life is a mysterious process sometimes and we figure<br/>
it out as we go along and help our kids to do the same.<br/>
