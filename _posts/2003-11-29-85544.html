&lt;&lt; But I am having a nagging feeling that it is the more the method (even<br/>
though she does seem to be enjoying the workbooks most days) than anything<br/>
else.  My goal still is to have her LOVE to learn, but I want to help her<br/>
get where she wants to go as well.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re right.<br/>
<br/>
Kids sometimes REALLY want to learn to read (I remember my little brother <br/>
saying &quot;Teach me to read&quot; with a plaintive begging tone when he was too little to <br/>
read), but they think it&#39;s something you can show them in just a few days or <br/>
weeks.   And some parents think so too, but it&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
When we were kids my dad worked for a mining company in a place where horses <br/>
sometimes grazed--totally unrelated to what he was doing.  One Saturday we and <br/>
the boss&#39;s kids had gone with the dads while they did something, so we could <br/>
just goof around in the office, in the hills, wherever around there.   The <br/>
moms were there too.<br/>
<br/>
Kids and adults were lounging here and there when one of the other girls, <br/>
eight or nine or so, came running in YELLING &quot;COME LOOK!!!!  COME SEE WHAT I <br/>
TAUGHT THE HORSES TO DO!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We ALL ran to look.<br/>
<br/>
The horses were doing what horses occasionally do, but it was circus-like to <br/>
the kids.   They were having exhuberant horse-sex.<br/>
<br/>
She didn&#39;t teach them to do that, but she had said or done something toward <br/>
them, and off they went.<br/>
<br/>
So it is sometimes when an adult DOES think she&#39;s taught a child to read.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re there about the right time and reading clicks for them, I think <br/>
it&#39;s easy to think you taught them to do that.<br/>
<br/>
And if my slightly-younger-friend Pam had tried to get them to do that trick <br/>
again, or to get other horses to do that trick, she might have thought those <br/>
horses weren&#39;t too smart, or were uncooperative, or that she needed to tweak <br/>
her training methods.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of things you can do to help her learn to read, but maybe the <br/>
best thing you can do is tell her it takes years, and she has already started <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter was frustrated to be &quot;a late reader&quot; (MAYBE) yet when she did get <br/>
it, she zoomed away past her friends who had believed themselves to be <br/>
reading for a year or more.   They eased into reading (or were dragged in) the <br/>
old-timey, show-progress way, so when she was having to ask people to read her <br/>
Harry Potter cards do her, her friends were reading their own.  Kind of.  Badly <br/>
and with errors that affected the game sometimes.  But Holly was in awe, still, <br/>
and embarrassed sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
When it came to her it was like a wave that carried her past and over them, <br/>
and now she sight reads &quot;with comprehension&quot; while they&#39;re still sounding out <br/>
words they don&#39;t understand.<br/>
<br/>
Reading without comprehension, by the way, is one of the most insane school <br/>
concepts ever imagined.   For ANY practical purposes &quot;reading without <br/>
comprehension&quot; means &quot;not reading,&quot; but in school kids do it ALL the time.  They teach <br/>
reading separate from comprehension, just about.  What is THAT!?  It&#39;s the <br/>
epitomy of phonics.  The kind of phonics my Macintosh can do.   The Mac has no <br/>
idea what it read, when it sounds out words with its voice simulation function.  <br/>
 Kids at school do that too, and teachers say &quot;Good!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not the kind of reading that helps kids read chapter books in bed at <br/>
night.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve collected lots of reading accounts here:<br/>

<br/>
I think the easiest way to help her read is to tread lightly around <br/>
traditional methods.   They&#39;ve proven in the past to help MANY children fear and hate <br/>
reading or anything that looks like reading.<br/>
