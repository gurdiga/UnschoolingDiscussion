<div id="ygrps-yiv-874869884"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;My husband is a tile/marble contractor.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ahhhhh..... I always said I would never trade my husband for<br/>
anything/one... but this week I would be STRONGLY tempted to trade him in<br/>
for an experienced tile/marble contractor!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We are redoing our shower, because of water damage behind the tile.<br/>
<br/>
After all the demolition was done, we each spent 14 hours working last<br/>
Tuesday and Wednesday to re-sheetrock the walls and install and plumb the<br/>
shower pan.  (A heavy, man-made &quot;marble&quot;).  It was pitiful and comical at<br/>
the same time -- kind of like a real life episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.  It<br/>
involved broken pipes, many trips to the hardware store, and extended<br/>
amounts of crawling under the house and swearing.<br/>
<br/>
All that time, effort and sweat and the shower still doesn&#39;t drain right! <br/>
(The drain isn&#39;t completely flush to the surface of the pan.)<br/>
<br/>
I now see the wisdom of hiring a pro.  My hindsight is certainly much<br/>
better than my foresight.<br/>
<br/>
However, the whole experience was VERY educational.<br/>

<br>The drain has to be at the low point of the pan -- obviously -- but this is 
<br>not always obvious to the naked eye. &nbsp;It&#39;s a slight grade. &nbsp;I do recall thay 
<br>my husband says this is a difficult task -- he &quot;muds in&quot; a floor, then puts 
<br>down a pan, I think.
<br>
<br>I can ask him more later if you want.

Dont do anything drastic, yet. My husband is a<br/>
carpenter, and every part of my house is 1/2 finished.<br/>
He does beautiful work when paid, but here its more of<br/>
a hapless hobby, so beware! I hear this happens to<br/>
lots of women who think they have found the perfect<br/>
tradesman(husband,lol)<br/>
