&lt;&lt;   I don&#39;t think I would draw a line. When I&#39;m in my mind observing <br/>
someone&#39;s<br/>
method, or reading a post, I usually don&#39;t think &quot;that isn&#39;t unschooling,&quot;<br/>
but I really might think &quot;that sure doesn&#39;t seem to be working for them,&quot; or<br/>
&quot;damn, that sounds like a lot of work for nothing.&quot;<br/>
   :-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really like words.  They&#39;re my favorite toys and collectibles.  So I don&#39;t <br/>
like people pointing at a handtruck and saying &quot;wheelbarrow,&quot; but I don&#39;t <br/>
mind at all if they point at a handtruck and say &quot;dolly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some things are the same and some things are not even nearly close enough.<br/>
<br/>
A sow bug might be a roly poly might be a millipede, but the flow of options <br/>
only goes so far, and it is NOT a bumble bee.<br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t care as much about is politics.  Some care a great deal about <br/>
politics.<br/>
<br/>
I care about how people learn, and with many people, they learn by <br/>
categorizing and comparing and contrasting.  And those things, when it comes <br/>
to ideas and philosophies, take words.<br/>
<br/>
So for my personal interest in learning and unschooling, terminology is the <br/>
toolbox I use.  <br/>
<br/>
And in addition to keeping an unschooling home (in the way some people keep a <br/>
kosher home, I mean down to the cabinets and calendars), I also help <br/>
unschoolers outside my family.   <br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m asked to speak about unschooling (which I&#39;m doing in town here in a <br/>
couple of weeks) it just won&#39;t do for me to stand up and say I don&#39;t really  <br/>
know or much care what it is, and that there&#39;s no one clear definition so <br/>
whatever they do when they leave there can be unschooling if they want, or <br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
I could tell them to call a couch a footstool, but it would make them look <br/>
like dopes if they went to buy one, or had company and said &quot;let&#39;s all sit on <br/>
this big footstool!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s a victimless footstool.  I mean couch.<br/>
<br/>
If I mislead people about the potential wonders of unschooling, they could <br/>
waste years on some kinda-schoolish structured unit studies coercion &quot;I&#39;m the <br/>
teacher but they mostly have freedom&quot; stuff instead of moving directly toward <br/>
something LOTS of us know can work gloriously.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of helping people move directly from confusion to glory if <br/>
possible.<br/>

I just thought it up as a way to indicate that it&#39;s more than just physical <br/>

I agree with Sandra.   Muddy definitions lead to<br/>
meaninglessness.  Either a word means something or it<br/>
doesn&#39;t.   It can&#39;t mean everything.  By the same<br/>
token, either a philosophy has some guiding principles<br/>
or it doesn&#39;t.  If it doesn&#39;t, then it&#39;s not really a<br/>
philosophy or a belief, or whatever, it&#39;s nothing.<br/>
