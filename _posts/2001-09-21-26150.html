<div id="ygrps-yiv-446743124">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
Since having both kids at home all the time there seems to be a never ending <br/>
stream of laundry either waiting to be done, waiting to go in the dryer, <br/>
waiting to be folded, waiting to be put away..... Plus more and more <br/>
housework, which I cannot possib.y keep up with.  The first order of business <br/>
next week is to get a cleaner.  I told hubby if we were not going to be <br/>
paying $600 per month for Waldorf we could definately afford a $50 cleaner <br/>
once every 2 weeks.  He agreed.<br/>

<br/>
Encourage kids to go without socks ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Have a separate laundry hamper for each person and one for towels and sheets<br/>
so the laundry is already sorted.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t separate whites and coloreds. (Integration is a good thing ;-) Does it<br/>
really make a difference with kids&#39; play clothes?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t fold, except for good stuff that needs to be presentable. Get larger<br/>
dressers and just toss t-shirts in one drawer, sweat pants in another,<br/>
underwear in another, socks (if you can&#39;t wean them off them ;-) in another<br/>
-- and make sure they&#39;re all the same color and style. Or perhaps different<br/>
styles for each kid. Minimize the clothes they have access to so there can<br/>
never be that many things to wash. How many shirts and pants does one kid<br/>
need? In many parts of the world one pair of pants is it.<br/>
<br/>
Teach the kids how to run the washer and dryer.<br/>
<br/>
Have kids (and adults if you can persuade them!) dress and undress in the<br/>
laundry room. Then get rid of dressers in the bedrooms and you can have<br/>
utility shelves with baskets for each person&#39;s clothes and a rack for<br/>

Hi Joyace<br/>
Do you really do this stuff?<br/>
Sharon <br/>
<br/>
Except for the no socks which was my daughter&#39;s idea, the only one I use is<br/>
the last one, the husband who does laundry. :-) But I love brainstorming new<br/>
ideas for other people to implement. If I try to do it for myself I edit to<br/>
much and put too many roadblocks in my own way.<br/>
<br/>
Though actually the most radical idea, keeping the clothes in the laundry<br/>
room, was used and suggested by some other real live homeschooler.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-119669019">We&#39;ve used odd socks for everything we can think of<br/>
from hobby horse heads, stuffings, puppets,to<br/>
dolls,dog chews, to bandages for burned hands, etc.<br/>
But what I want to know is the ultimate modern<br/>
question of WHERE ARE THE OTHER SOCKS? I&#39;ve read many<br/>
theories and done actual searches in the interior of<br/>
washing machines, under beds, in closet corners, even<br/>
UNDER bathroom floors, outside, under the car seats,<br/>
sofas, inside of upholstered furniture....and still<br/>
there are missing socks.  Is there a parralel world<br/>
filled with beings somehow making use of all the OTHER<br/>
socks? Perhaps there is some relationship to thrift<br/>
stores that have mountains of unmatched shoes?<br/>

something.  Paper clips?<br/>
<br/>
And then paper clips turn into coat hangers.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes there are LOTS of paper clips and sometimes none, and then there <br/>
will be wire coat hangers you&#39;ve never seen before.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-907849444">It seems I&#39;m always 2-3 loads behind at my house, but here&#39;s a different <br/>
perspective. Ds learned all about the toilet works the other night (11:30p!!) <br/>
and wanted to see the washing machine work next. As we&#39;re standing there <br/>
watching it swish back and forth and I&#39;m telling him how great it is that it <br/>
washes things for us, and how we&#39;d have to do it if we didn&#39;t have a washer, <br/>
it hit me. Without that machine I&#39;d have to scrub each item of clothing by <br/>
hand. Every bath towel, dish towel, shirt, sock, bra, etc. This probably <br/>
sounds extrordinarily hokey and pollyannish, but I have a whole new outlook <br/>
on laundry. It&#39;s almost a fun, sacred thing.  I was just overwhelmed with <br/>
gratitude over that whole thing. Just thought I&#39;d share.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969728267">Being mom to six children, I understand completely. I even have my great<br/>
grandmother&#39;s washing board handing up in my laundry room. Whenever I get<br/>
discouraged with the never ending flow of laundry, I look up and think about<br/>
all the things she had to do by hand. She also had six kids, 2 girls and 4<br/>
boys with the girls at each end.<br/>

&gt; It seems I&#39;m always 2-3 loads behind at my house, but here&#39;s a different<br/>
&gt; perspective. Ds learned all about the toilet works the other night<br/>
(11:30p!!)<br/>
&gt; and wanted to see the washing machine work next. As we&#39;re standing there<br/>
&gt; watching it swish back and forth and I&#39;m telling him how great it is that<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; washes things for us, and how we&#39;d have to do it if we didn&#39;t have a<br/>
washer,<br/>
&gt; it hit me. Without that machine I&#39;d have to scrub each item of clothing by<br/>
&gt; hand. Every bath towel, dish towel, shirt, sock, bra, etc. This probably<br/>
&gt; sounds extrordinarily hokey and pollyannish, but I have a whole new<br/>
outlook<br/>
&gt; on laundry. It&#39;s almost a fun, sacred thing.  I was just overwhelmed with<br/>
&gt; gratitude over that whole thing. Just thought I&#39;d share.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-849874738">I was laughing as I read this because when my best friend and I were<br/>
teenagers, we used to swap socks as a sign of friendship. Rarely did we have<br/>
matching socks. The red and yellow pair was our favorite.<br/>

&gt; &gt; My daughter wears two different colored socks.  She started it when she<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3  since she wanted more color in her outfits.  Now it is part of her<br/>
&gt; &gt; fashion.  A couple of other girls she plays with have started it too.<br/>
One<br/>
&gt; &gt; is older and she made the comment that she didn&#39;t have to sort her socks<br/>
&gt; &gt; now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have to sort Megan&#39;s socks - they just go in a bin in her drawer<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; she picks out what she wants to wear that day.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you for releasing another law from my head! Just socks, but I&#39;m<br/>
reading<br/>
&gt; this thinking, &#39;can she do that?!? mismatched socks?!? well, I guess she<br/>
&gt; could, wow!&#39; Amazing how many guidelines I follow without even thinking<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
