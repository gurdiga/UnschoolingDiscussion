&gt;<br/>
&gt; Its warm here today too.  We packed up our bikes and went over to our<br/>
&gt; church&#39;s parking lot.  The boys had fun zooming all around, Cal said<br/>
&gt; he was going 456mph according to his &quot;speed monitor&quot;  LOL.. He does<br/>
&gt; have a speedometer on his bike, but hey, speed monitor works too.<br/>
&gt; Lydie and I just sat in the van and talked.   OH,yeah, I went to the<br/>
&gt; Dollar store and racked up on lots of cheap gifts I can wrap up for<br/>
&gt; treats before Christmas OR I can use them for stocking stuffers if<br/>
&gt; they dont end up opening all of them.  Acutally, Phillip hasnt asked<br/>
&gt; to open any gifts today, but I did give him some new crayons<br/>
&gt; with &quot;flesh&quot; color in them to finish coloring Shaggy on his poster.<br/>
&gt; I gotta go whip up some lunch.. Hope everyone else is having a good<br/>
&gt; day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It was in the low 60&#39;s here (Phoenix, AZ) today and we went for a bike ride<br/>
to the park - about 3/4 mile away.<br/>
I&#39;ve been taking our dog along too (our Vizsla), him trotting along beside<br/>
the bike, so he could get some much needed exercise. (yes I know that&#39;s<br/>
dangerous but I think we were both doing fine and under control).<br/>
<br/>
When we got to the park, it was blissfully empty &lt;g&gt; but we found that they<br/>
had a fence around the playground equipment and this truck/tractor thing<br/>
started digging a deep hole. Our guess is that they&#39;re working on putting in<br/>
new playground equipment. Anyway, it was fun to watch and at least the<br/>
swings were available and the boys had fun with that for about a 1/2  hour.<br/>
Then we cycled home and were almost there when 2 dogs came out of a fenced<br/>
yard where the gate was open and starting barking at us. Oh, I HATE that! We<br/>
stopped and stood our ground and when it looked like it was safe and they<br/>
weren&#39;t going to run after us and attack us, we went on home. Irresponsible<br/>
pet owners....(mumbling and grumbling)<br/>
