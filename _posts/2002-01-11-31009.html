<div id="ygrps-yiv-640035742">About Dr. Laura, I realize I&#39;m quite out numbered here, but that hasn&#39;t stopped me in the past with other things, so I&#39;ll comment anyway.  Since I analyze everything, it was easy for me to get past the rude, abrasiveness once I figured out that her main interest is to try to help inform her listeners that the behavior the caller has had can cause serious consequences.  She understands that in 3 min. it is unlikely she can really help a stranger over the phone.  However, if the people listening somehow get the message that, say, it is important for parents to be home with their kids, divorce can be devastating to children, certain behavior is destructive to marriages, yada yada yada, then maybe she has helped someone.  She often mentions what her PhD is in, that she is no longer a licensed clinical psychologist, that preferably mothers need to be home with their kids for at least the first year, even why she speaks to people the way she does and uses the words she uses.  She is a very religious person and uses her religious beliefs in forming some of her opinions.  I don&#39;t hold that against her.  I try to put personalities aside and listen to what people are saying, sometimes it is what I choose to agree with, sometimes not.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know the exact reason she got out of private practice however she often speaks disparagingly of the research being published and used and how it often has no scientific basis.  The one situation I can remember was regarding adults having sex with children.  As I remember, based on a paper that was published, psychologists were no longer to consider incest and other such acts to be harmful to children.  Dr. Laura had a real problem with this one and because she made such a stink, it actually was dealt with on the congressional level and the paper discredited.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599875603">I really have to disagree here.  She does *not* give callers 3 minutes or<br/>
even 3 seconds in some instances.  Some folks hardly get their question out<br/>
and she cuts them off.<br/>
<br/>
However, my biggest problem with her is that she is a bigot and a hypocrit.<br/>
<br/>
1)  &quot;moral health program&quot;  &quot;no promiscuity&quot;  &quot;no intercourse without<br/>
marriage&quot; blah, blah, blah.<br/>
<br/>
This from a woman who posed for nude photos, who was dating a married man<br/>
and then lived with her current husband before marrying him.  (PLEASE NOTE,<br/>
I am not against these things, they are listed as evidence of hypocricy)<br/>
<br/>
2)  mothers shouldn&#39;t work.  She&#39;s been working as long as her son has been<br/>
alive.<br/>
<br/>
3)  claims to be a rabbi (she&#39;s a woman, she can&#39;t be a rabbi) and a<br/>
&quot;prophet&quot;<br/>
<br/>
4)  She is not and never has been a clinical psychologist no matter how many<br/>
times she says it.  She got a certificate as an MFCC.<br/>
<br/>
5)  Although she has been on radio making all these claims for 25 years, she<br/>
has only had her cert as a MFCC for 12 years.  That leaves 13 years of<br/>
fraudom.<br/>
<br/>
And, since this needs to not be too long, I will leave off the umpteen<br/>
zillion things she has &quot;actively&quot; done to denegrate homosexuals and foster<br/>
homophobia.<br/>

a MFCC.  Her PhD is in physiology.  As far as I know her license lapsed<br/>
because she is not practicing nor does she keep up on her ECUs.<br/>

Maybe she can get a job as Howard Sterns sidekick???<br/>
<br/>
did anyone else catch the program way back when where she didn&#39;t know the<br/>
mic was on and she was reaming her son up one side and down the other?  Sure<br/>
did show her true colors when it comes to child raising!<br/>

 &gt; I&#39;d say Dr. Laura needs to find out what her gift is, then because it<br/>
comes across as smart-*ss remarks rather than helpful insights.<br/>
 &gt; Maybe a stand up comic?<br/>

 &gt;   &lt;&lt;to at least have some clue about what they are doing&gt;&gt;<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt;   I agree.  But having a degree or training doesn&#39;t mean you have a clue.<br/>
 &gt;   Means you know what the books say.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt;   My grandmother is the best vet I know.  She has never even been to<br/>
college,<br/>
 &gt;   much less vet school.  But she has lived with animals of all types for<br/>
all<br/>
 &gt;   her years.  She is an expert.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt;   Now if you want to say you object to misrepresentation, then yes I<br/>
agree.<br/>
 &gt;   But I have spent enough time with docs, therapists, what have you, to<br/>
know<br/>
 &gt;   that the sheepskin isn&#39;t worth diddly.  The person either has the gift<br/>
of<br/>
 &gt;   healing or they don&#39;t.<br/>
