<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848682334">Glena,<br/>
You say you never got a direct &quot;NO&quot; about the math and kept pushing, <br/>
and yet THIS was your first post on the topic:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So I have the conversation about what you are going to do with your <br/>
life and <br/>
get the usual response that they are going to go to college and <br/>
become a <br/>
doctor. Always the same answer since this child was five. I expected <br/>
it <br/>
would change somewhere along the line but it hasn&#39;t. So am I helping <br/>
prepare <br/>
her to meet her dreams and hopes for the future?<br/>
<br/>
I think I probably am, except maybe in math which she seems to lack <br/>
much <br/>
interest in so I don&#39;t bring it up. We&#39;ve studied latin together, <br/>
we&#39;ve <br/>
studied so much together actually BUT you HAVE to be strong in math <br/>
to get in <br/>
a premed program, you just have too. <br/>
<br/>
So, I tell her maybe she would want to look at some Algebra stuff <br/>
that I <br/>
bought for the computer. And she doesn&#39;t. So I suggest maybe she look <br/>
online and see what kind of stuff google will offer her with the <br/>
typing of <br/>
Algebra. She doesn&#39;t care.<br/>
<br/>
Then I have to go into a lengthy discussion that while I don&#39;t care <br/>
if she <br/>
ever learns algebra or not, that SHE wants to go to medical school <br/>
and at <br/>
some point if she can&#39;t bring herself to learn math she&#39;s just not <br/>
going to <br/>
see that dream realized, which is fine by me, but I want her to know <br/>
the <br/>
facts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds to me like a Mom that is pushing.<br/>
THAT is what we were responding to.<br/>
<br/>
You also said that you hoped a book I suggested would MAKE her want <br/>
math. It was all about what you thought she needed and hoping she&#39;d <br/>
learn a certain thing.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that you keep using your dd&#39;s math resistance as ammo <br/>
against this list is more than slightly frustrating, in light of what <br/>
you wrote.<br/>
<br/>
Strewing their paths is not about what we WANT them to absorb.<br/>
It&#39;s just about living interesting lives and sharing our passions <br/>
with each other. <br/>
I don&#39;t try to get math into my kids but I do expose them to lots of <br/>
opportunities.<br/>
There is a world of difference.<br/>
Can you not see that?</div>

  I don&#39;t think the issue is laying the computer game out to be seen. The issue is that math is your issue not hers. If you want to foster a love or get her to be exposed go explore math yourself and do it for yourself not  with the intent of manipulting her to like it. It seems like you are having trouble hearing on this topic. Explore within yourself why you want her to have math. Unschooling philosophy believes she will do it when it is important to her. This math thing to me sounds like your own insecurities or your fears for her or your dreams tied up in her life. Just a thought.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t WANT to explore math if I did it would be artificial and fake, she <br/>
would know.  I never had a love of math, even though it WAS something I HAD <br/>
to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I hear that you have things strewn around for your children to explore and <br/>
experience, things that you either KNOW your children are already interested <br/>
in or HOPE they might enjoy.  AND (and I know you don&#39;t start a sentence with <br/>
a preposition but like I explained to my lit teacher, writing is a STYLE all <br/>
do it differently) when they show an interest in something, we/you foster <br/>
that interest and hopefully they are doing it because the LOVE/LIKE it and <br/>
WANT to  do it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s still the point some aren&#39;t understanding.  Some have and responded <br/>
very with very helpful advice.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about FOSTERING a LOVE of math.  Of course at some point she is going to <br/>
learn it and I would hope, even if it&#39;s because she HAS to, that she won&#39;t <br/>
have such reservations to think it a horrible chore.  Hopefully because it&#39;s <br/>
something that at some point there was FUN in learning.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, I&#39;ve HEARD all about how when/if she HAS to learn it, she will but I <br/>
want more for her than that.  I want her to have a love of all things <br/>
learning, not just because down the road it&#39;s a means to an end.  That&#39;s the <br/>
way I learned.  I learned because it was expected, required, mandatory, not <br/>
for the LOVE of learning.<br/>
<br/>
No matter if it&#39;s poetry or algebra, art or geometry I want her to be able to <br/>
embrace each part of learning with enjoyment of absorbing and learning <br/>
something new.<br/>
<br/>
I just didn&#39;t have any idea how MATH could possibly be FUN or enjoyable and <br/>
not just a task to be completed or learned.  Others apparently KNOW how to <br/>
make math fun and to even LOVE math, that maybe is MY problem.   Wanting her <br/>
to LOVE EVERY aspect of learning, even the things you need/want/have to learn <br/>
later in life to reach your goals.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just am not very good at explaining because I feel like I&#39;ve tried <br/>
over and over again and for some that understand there is someone else who <br/>
thinks because I wanted to know what FUN things you do with MATH and want my <br/>
child to LOVE it when she chooses to do it that I&#39;m being pushy.<br/>
<br/>
I do thank those who for whatever reason are able to understand my point and <br/>
I thank you for the links and the suggestions and the advice you have <br/>
offered.  Lots of things about math I have never been exposed to and lots of <br/>
good FUN things that will come in handy when she wants it.  Not just a <br/>
horrible textbook that&#39;s hard to understand!<br/>

She may never need/want/care about more than very basic arithmetic to<br/>

<br/>
What I think you are missing is that no one loves every aspect of learning.  <br/>
EVEN when they WANT to learn it.  I love food.  Most of the time I love <br/>
cooking it, too.  I want to learn more about cooking and healthy eating, but <br/>
I don&#39;t always enjoy every little aspect of it.  I don&#39;t like cleaning the <br/>
dishes!  I don&#39;t like how messy my kitchen gets just to cook a decent meal.  <br/>
That doesn&#39;t stop me from wanting to learn better eating habits, better <br/>
recipes, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is highly unrealistic to want anyone to LOVE EVERY aspect of <br/>
learning.  Even in the best of unschooling situations, completely child-led, <br/>
the child will come across something he doesn&#39;t enjoy, much less LOVE!  <br/>
Sometimes, it IS the means to an end!  I think perservering through the <br/>
yucky spots helps us take even more pride in our success!<br/>
<br/>
If you can stop your brain tape of (Oh ick, how Dr. Phil of me!) what YOU <br/>
want for HER to love then you can begin to allow HER to find what SHE loves. <br/>
  Does that make sense?  I don&#39;t know how else to say it to help you <br/>
understand, I&#39;m sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Just hang in there and keep listening.  Grab a pen and paper and write down <br/>
all YOUR wants, needs, desires for her and go back and see if it is in YOUR <br/>
interest, or hers.  I think you may be a bit surprised.<br/>
<br/>
We all want the best for our children.  I think it is important to <br/>
understand they aren&#39;t us though.  They can&#39;t make up for our failures, <br/>
shorcomings or relive our lives for us.  It is perfectly ok to want better <br/>
for our children, but we have to stop our own brain baggage and let them <br/>
find their own way.  She may very well grow up HATING math!  What would that <br/>
mean to you?  Does that mean she failed?  Does that mean YOU failed?  What <br/>
if she absorbs herself in writing and becomes an author someday, instead of <br/>
a doctor?  She&#39;ll only need enough math to balance her checkbook and count <br/>
change and that should pretty well cover any other math skills needed for <br/>
the average person on an average day.  I don&#39;t think that is such a bad <br/>
thing.  I wonder if you do, though?<br/>

What makes you think she will?<br/>
Did you?<br/>
<br/>
Was it a chore?<br/>
<br/>
Your attitude toward math, if you decide solidly NOT to try to change your <br/>
attitude toward math, will be apparent to your daughter.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That&#39;s still the point some aren&#39;t understanding. &gt;&gt;<br/>

something new.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What if it&#39;s tree pollen or the Napoleonic Wars or macrame or calypso?<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re still very schoolish in your thinking and many people have tried many <br/>
ways to point that out to you.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Others apparently KNOW how to <br/>
make math fun and to even LOVE math, that maybe is MY problem. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s your problem, but you&#39;re looking at the wrong solutions.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I guess I just am not very good at explaining because I feel like I&#39;ve tried <br/>
over and over again&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that you&#39;re not explaining well, it&#39;s that you&#39;re trying to write <br/>
what others want to hear without doing what others think you need to do, <br/>
which is post less and BE with your kids more.  See what they&#39;re already <br/>
doing, and disassemble the model in your head which has lists of things you <br/>
think they need to learn. Whether they love it or not, whether they wait <br/>
until they &quot;need&quot; to know it or not, those aren&#39;t the issues.  The issue is <br/>
your own need to deschool yourself, to come to a new model of learning inside <br/>
your own mind and your own soul.<br/>
<br/>
Your explanations are pretty clear, but you&#39;re having a hard time seeing them <br/>
the way others are seeing them.  No matter how many words I spin to describe <br/>
to you the German Shepherd we own, and how much I&#39;m SURE it&#39;s a German <br/>
Shepherd and yes, I&#39;m proud to own one, fact that the dog we have is actually <br/>
an Australian Cattle Dog.   Ten or twenty similarities don&#39;t make it what <br/>
it&#39;s not.  Me saying &quot;Well, I guess I know my own dog better than anyone <br/>
else&quot; wouldn&#39;t change the delusion.<br/>

Maybe one day I will. Maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
Will the lack of love for Shakespeare hinder my life?. No. (And I do get many <br/>
of the jokes! &lt;g&gt; &#39;cause I DID suffer through reading it!)<br/>
<br/>
Why is it important to YOU that she love math? Can she be passionate about <br/>
other things (and never math) and it still be OK? Some people just don&#39;t like <br/>
math. Some people just hate grammar. I&#39;m the Grammar Nazi. What if *I* decide <br/>
that everyone should LOVE grammar? Where does that put everyone who HATES it <br/>
---or is indifferent to it?<br/>
<br/>
Some people love math. Some don&#39;t. Whether they&#39;re unschooled or not. Or <br/>
whether they have YEARS of schooling behind them. Will more kids learn to <br/>
love math by being unschooled? Maybe. But it doesn&#39;t really matter. Let her <br/>
love what she loves.<br/>

of analogies):<br/>
Schools are making gingerbread cookies<br/>
Unschoolers are making chocolate chip cookies<br/>
Ginger is teaching what you think kids should learn<br/>
Chocolate chips are interesting things you strew their paths with<br/>
You keep asking us when we&#39;re going to add the ginger, and how to add <br/>
the ginger, and how much ginger to add, and how to avoid adding so <br/>
much ginger that they&#39;re inedible.  We&#39;re answering that we don&#39;t add <br/>
ginger at all.  We stir in some chocolate chips now and then, but <br/>

  Maybe thinking about it like this will help (yes, I&#39;m endlessly full <br/>
  of analogies):<br/>
  Schools are making gingerbread cookies<br/>
  Unschoolers are making chocolate chip cookies<br/>
  Ginger is teaching what you think kids should learn<br/>
  Chocolate chips are interesting things you strew their paths with<br/>
  You keep asking us when we&#39;re going to add the ginger, and how to add <br/>
  the ginger, and how much ginger to add, and how to avoid adding so <br/>
  much ginger that they&#39;re inedible.  We&#39;re answering that we don&#39;t add <br/>
  ginger at all.  We stir in some chocolate chips now and then, but <br/>
  they have a different flavor than ginger.  You keep insisting that at <br/>
  some point these cookies will need ginger. And gingerbread cookies <br/>
  will.  But chocolate chip cookies never will.  You can&#39;t get past <br/>

Well, yes and no.  Your job is to EXPOSE her to things by being interested yourself, but its up to HER to decide if she&#39;s interested or not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There is nothing wrong with learning it just becuase it fills a practical need.  Why does it HAVE to be more than that?  Why is learning solely for a practical need &quot;less than&quot;?  Do you LOVE Grocery shopping?  I don&#39;t.  It fills a practical need and thats about it.  But there ARE people who love to grocery shop becasue they also love to cook and they love to plan that for themselves and their families, or the love to be thrifty and see how much they can save.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I want her to have a love of all things <br/>
 </span></blockquote>learning, not just because down the road it&#39;s a means to an end. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
But here again...this is what YOU want.  YOU want her to have a love of all things learning......<br/>
<br/>
This is what you are not getting.  If you are going to unschool successfully you&#39;ve got to stop projecting what YOU want onto her and accept what SHE wants even if it means she NEVER cares about math, other than to fill a practical need in her life.<br/>

She has indicated that she is NOT interested but you keep seeking ideas about math.  Why?  Why do you have to have these ideas now?  Why not wait until she IS interested, and then you won&#39;t NEED our ideas!  She&#39;ll have ideas of her OWN.<br/>

  &gt; If you want to foster a love or get her to be exposed go explore math <br/>
  &gt; yourself and do it for yourself not  with the intent of manipulting her to <br/>
  &gt; like it. It seems like you are having trouble hearing on this topic. <br/>
  &gt; Explore <br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t WANT to explore math if I did it would be artificial and fake, she <br/>
  would know.  I never had a love of math, even though it WAS something I HAD <br/>
  to learn.<br/>
<br/>
  I hear that you have things strewn around for your children to explore and <br/>
  experience, things that you either KNOW your children are already interested <br/>
  in or HOPE they might enjoy.  AND (and I know you don&#39;t start a sentence with <br/>
  a preposition but like I explained to my lit teacher, writing is a STYLE all <br/>
  do it differently) when they show an interest in something, we/you foster <br/>
  that interest and hopefully they are doing it because the LOVE/LIKE it and <br/>
  WANT to  do it.<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s still the point some aren&#39;t understanding.  Some have and responded <br/>
  very with very helpful advice.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s about FOSTERING a LOVE of math.  Of course at some point she is going to <br/>
  learn it and I would hope, even if it&#39;s because she HAS to, that she won&#39;t <br/>
  have such reservations to think it a horrible chore.  Hopefully because it&#39;s <br/>
  something that at some point there was FUN in learning.<br/>
<br/>
  Sure, I&#39;ve HEARD all about how when/if she HAS to learn it, she will but I <br/>
  want more for her than that.  I want her to have a love of all things <br/>
  learning, not just because down the road it&#39;s a means to an end.  That&#39;s the <br/>
  way I learned.  I learned because it was expected, required, mandatory, not <br/>
  for the LOVE of learning.<br/>
<br/>
  No matter if it&#39;s poetry or algebra, art or geometry I want her to be able to <br/>
  embrace each part of learning with enjoyment of absorbing and learning <br/>
  something new.<br/>
<br/>
  I just didn&#39;t have any idea how MATH could possibly be FUN or enjoyable and <br/>
  not just a task to be completed or learned.  Others apparently KNOW how to <br/>
  make math fun and to even LOVE math, that maybe is MY problem.   Wanting her <br/>
  to LOVE EVERY aspect of learning, even the things you need/want/have to learn <br/>
  later in life to reach your goals.<br/>
<br/>
  I guess I just am not very good at explaining because I feel like I&#39;ve tried <br/>
  over and over again and for some that understand there is someone else who <br/>
  thinks because I wanted to know what FUN things you do with MATH and want my <br/>
  child to LOVE it when she chooses to do it that I&#39;m being pushy.<br/>
<br/>
  I do thank those who for whatever reason are able to understand my point and <br/>
  I thank you for the links and the suggestions and the advice you have <br/>
  offered.  Lots of things about math I have never been exposed to and lots of <br/>
  good FUN things that will come in handy when she wants it.  Not just a <br/>
  horrible textbook that&#39;s hard to understand!<br/>

&gt; Thanks for the food for thought, I&#39;ve been thinking about it but can&#39;t yet <br/>
 </span></blockquote>see the comparison, but I&#39;m trying to get it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe instead of completely different types of cookies, they are the slice <br/>
and bakes or microwaved instead of a conventional oven.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t in the end the result/goal the same?  Happy productive citizens?  I <br/>
don&#39;t agree with HOW they do it in school, or I guess I&#39;d have them educating <br/>
my children, but it&#39;s that it is DONE differently, not truly a different <br/>
animal is it?<br/>
<br/>
Actually it&#39;s not DONE at all, it&#39;s child led but it&#39;s still learning just in <br/>
a different better way (much better).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not disputing or arguing your analogy, just sharing with you what I am <br/>
thinking so maybe you can see the flaw in my thinking and share with me about <br/>
being a better facilitator of unschooling for my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Kinda like &quot;this&quot; is how I am seeing it, what exactly is the difference.  I <br/>
see it as sorta the same end, as in children grow up, go on to college or to <br/>
their futures as whatever they choose to be and they are gonna get there, <br/>
nothing is going to change that, but the way they end up there makes a big <br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
Gingerbread or chocolate chips?  Maybe, but I&#39;m just see it as a different <br/>
way, a much better way of course but the goal is learning isn&#39;t it?  Just the <br/>
unschooling way turns out much better chocolate chips with much less burning <br/>
and scorching and pain than the schooling cookies, they all may not look as <br/>
uniform as the ones sliced from the roll, but they are SO much better even if <br/>
it takes a different route to get them that way.<br/>
<br/>
OK, I&#39;m going to bed, it was a LONG, but great weekend and I think I am <br/>
rambling and making no sense, even to myself... sorry...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for making me THINK, I LOVE it!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra, thank you so much for taking such an active role in helping me to so <br/>
deeply search my motives and I can appreciate that you can know the meaning <br/>
in my words beyond even my own comprehension.<br/>
<br/>
I send just as much time with my child as is required or accepted by her but <br/>
thank you for thinking of me and letting me know once again that my questions <br/>
and posts have become tiresome to you.  I&#39;ll think about it, might not change <br/>
anything as far as questioning because I think I get GREAT advice and LOTS to <br/>
think about and explore but I do appreciate you pointing out yet again that <br/>
you think I post too much.<br/>
<br/>
You telling me you have a German Shepherd and having an Australian Cattle dog <br/>
is not a very good analogy of me stating what I KNOW to be a fact in my life, <br/>
asking about it, or discussing it with others who might have more insight <br/>
than I do.<br/>
<br/>
If I say I would love for my daughter to enjoy learning about EVERYTHING in <br/>
her life, guess what?  I mean that I would LOVE for my daughter to enjoy <br/>
learning about EVERYTHING that she learns.  Nothing less, nothing more. <br/>
<br/>
Please point out to me how that is flawed thinking?  That because I WANT her <br/>
to ENJOY learning and I look or ask about fun or exciting things that I might <br/>
never know about it&#39;s somehow a different reality than you experience?  Of <br/>
course it is, it&#39;s MY reality.<br/>
<br/>
I get some really GOOD ADVICE here.  If I don&#39;t ask, if I don&#39;t talk about or <br/>
discuss where I am and what my thinking is, how will anyone ever point out to <br/>
me the flaws in my thinking and help me to find this nirvana that you have?<br/>
<br/>
glena who is forever grateful for those with the kindness of heart and <br/>
patience of soul to discuss and suggest, nurture and guide me to be the best <br/>
I can be at unschooling <br/>

Thats the point we are trying to make.<br/>
<br/>
It WILL be a relaxed and enjoyable thing for her if she comes into it at her own time in her own way.  You don&#39;t need to &quot;make&quot; it that way.<br/>

You don&#39;t need to be worrying about it right now because she is not interested...so drop it.  When she is interested, THEN come back and ask about it.<br/>

goal for me anyway.  I think she has much higher expectations than I do.  <br/>
Ever since she&#39;s been a tiny little girl, everyone has noticed how nurturing <br/>
she is.  Her older siblings often comment that they would not be surprise if <br/>
she turns out to be a SAHM of a dozen children.  I don&#39;t care what they <br/>
become as long as they are happy.  <br/>
<br/>
One of my children has a college degree, one works in the construction <br/>
industry, one is currently a college student, not wholeheartedly but for the <br/>
&quot;experience&quot; and to play baseball, to him it&#39;s not about learning from books <br/>
at all, it&#39;s about having more life experiences and for him to do what he <br/>
wants (play college ball) he HAS to pass classes so he does.  I know he <br/>
doesn&#39;t LOVE the &quot;schooling&quot; part at all, but he DOES love the baseball and <br/>
the frats and all that stuff.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that is about ME, is being the best mother I can possibly be, <br/>
learning and growing and providing whatever it takes to meet their needs and <br/>
help them on their journey in life.<br/>

&lt;&lt; It&#39;s about FOSTERING a LOVE of math.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But Glena, THAT is exactly why we were telling you that the way you were <br/>
handling it was not the best way to acheive this.<br/>
PLEASE read this again:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;BUT you HAVE to be strong in math to get in <br/>
a premed program, you just have too. <br/>
<br/>
So, I tell her maybe she would want to look at some Algebra stuff that I <br/>
bought for the computer. And she doesn&#39;t. So I suggest maybe she look <br/>
online and see what kind of stuff google will offer her with the typing of <br/>
Algebra. She doesn&#39;t care.<br/>
<br/>
Then I have to go into a lengthy discussion that while I don&#39;t care if she <br/>
ever learns algebra or not, that SHE wants to go to medical school and at <br/>
some point if she can&#39;t bring herself to learn math she&#39;s just not going to <br/>
see that dream realized, which is fine by me, but I want her to know the <br/>
facts.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Those were your very own words about you, your dd and math!!<br/>
This is NOT jiving with what you&#39;re saying now, which is that you never, ever <br/>
pushed her or kept offering something after she showed no interest.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t understand why you can&#39;t just admit you handled it differently <br/>
than the way you would now and move on.<br/>
We all make mistakes with our children, we all learn and hopefully admit it <br/>
could have been  handled better.<br/>
<br/>
What you were doing was NOT strewing, it was pushing. And what we&#39;re saying <br/>
is the BEST way to foster a love of anything in your children is to be a <br/>
shining example.<br/>
If it would be fake for you to even show an interest in anything math <br/>
related, then they probably are going to pick up on that. You are sending a <br/>
message.<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to heal your own math phobia, then you might pass it to <br/>
your child.<br/>
That&#39;s just how it very often works out. <br/>
I chose to get interested in math concepts for ME. So I wouldn&#39;t feel so <br/>
frustrated and I would learn to enjoy something that would help open doors in <br/>
both my world and my childrens.          <br/>

so, guess we will leave it as I&#39;m that helpless hopeless faking unschooler <br/>
that someone sent me the private post that I am.<br/>
<br/>
WHATEVER, I am here for the same reasons that everyone else is, well that <br/>
many are here for, to learn and grow and help my children on their journey in <br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
Someone else brought it up yet again and maybe they want to make an example I <br/>
don&#39;t know.  Someone always brings it up when I ask about most anything.  I <br/>
haven&#39;t asked about the math at all since previously, but it keeps getting <br/>
brought up and things are said that are not at all what is happening in my <br/>
life.  I hope to explain that and move on or have someone offer advice but it <br/>
seems to be that I posted about wanting my daughter, no NEEDING my daughter <br/>
to learn math so, in the eyes of many it seems condemns me to never moving <br/>
forward.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care, I&#39;m doing the best I can and asking for help when I need it.  <br/>
Trying to incorporate ideas and move forward on the unschooling journey,<br/>
<br/>
Like it was pointed out, take what you need from the list, use the delete key <br/>
and for heavens sake quit judging me from one post that seems to go on and <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
And for those of you who have the time to check, please do so, you can <br/>
clearly see that once again someone ELSE brought up the math, I did discuss <br/>
it yet again though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-123352492">Glena,<br/>
<br/>
When I brought my son home he hated math.  Now, he doesn&#39;t mind it at all so <br/>
long as it is life math. He hates any pushed on math, book math or question <br/>
math. If he is living life and stumbles along to a math thing like cooking <br/>
measurements or shopping or how long he will have to save now per week to get <br/>
the car he wants at 16 he does it.<br/>
My son could not do simple math to save his life 2 1/2 years ago cuz it was <br/>
pushed math/book math.  What I found out is that they where using &quot;set&quot; <br/>
formulas to get the answers and he was frustrated because he knew his own way <br/>
and they would not let him do it.<br/>
A child that could not do math on paper in school now does it in his head <br/>
faster than I ever could!<br/>
Glena, my son was tested LD, labeled and stuffed in the resource room at <br/>
school. They told me he will always have math and reading issues. He is doing <br/>
wonderful now!<br/>
I dont know if this helped you but I want you to know, I hear you, I had the <br/>
same worries last year.  Maybe if you set a date to recheck your concerns. <br/>
Give her a year, I bet you both will feel much different next year. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you, I can tell you it almost (yep almost) makes me just want to send <br/>
her right back to school.  Apparently because I want learning to be fun and <br/>
exciting and to be the best it&#39;s just a lie that I haven&#39;t even yet let <br/>
myself admit.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even bring math up, I REALLY don&#39;t but apparently that&#39;s all I can be <br/>
judged on and judged I am for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I was just ready to say forget it, obviously I am NEVER going to get this if <br/>
those &quot;in the know&quot; think I am some fake liar, well, I must be harming my <br/>
child right?  That is the VERY LAST thing I would ever want to do.<br/>
<br/>
So if someone is going to harm her, let it be the school system right?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your kind post, I can&#39;t tell you how much I needed it this very <br/>
minute.<br/>

shrugged, that was the end of it, EXCEPT for my panic that maybe it was the <br/>
WRONG stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I NEVER sat her down and demanded she do ANYTHING much less math related <br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Since that round of posts I try NOT to think about math but somehow it keeps <br/>
coming up that because of that one incident which I repeatedly say I&#39;ve <br/>
learned from, keeps me from doing anything in an unschooling manner.<br/>
<br/>
I admitted I was scared, I admitted that my friend, a high school principal <br/>
had told me in no uncertain words the irreparable harm I was doing by <br/>
avoiding math all together because she didn&#39;t ask about it.  I admitted I <br/>
didn&#39;t love math, I just did it.  I said I wished a better experience for <br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
All of that is wrong.  I get it, that you tell me I am forever doomed because <br/>
of this ONE instance, I get it that no matter what I ask about or discuss <br/>
someone will ALWAYS find the post about MATH and say &quot;see, you know nothing, <br/>
you can&#39;t do this, you will NEVER do this&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So, I accept that.  I also accept that in between those posts I get posts <br/>
from those who really LISTEN and don&#39;t jump back to a page that might have <br/>
been taken out of context and try to skew it to fit the current discussion <br/>
and put me back into the hole someone has carved for me.  Those are the posts <br/>
that help, those are the posts that point out ways to think or do differently <br/>
or offer advice on how to do something not just tell me that I&#39;m NOT doing <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
That is the help that I stay here for and I try to always say how grateful I <br/>
am for it.<br/>

<br/>
I have got to say this!<br/>
<br/>
Glena asked a question that some others including my self would have asked. <br/>
As a matter a fact I asked a group that question last year.<br/>
We Unschool our children and allow them their own directions and tell adults <br/>
not to control, push, etc., whatever words where used. But some are attacking <br/>
this person who joined this group for support and encouragement. <br/>
I think advice is fine but when it is email after email of attacking her and <br/>
her motherhood it&#39;s doing nothing but driving her away. <br/>
Glena please do not leave and please dont put your daughter back in ps <br/>
because of math. <br/>
<br/>
My understanding of this group is:<br/>
To assist others in their Unschooling goals<br/>
To help those who need support<br/>
To ...hey.... ((((give a hug)))) when someone needs it why not!<br/>
<br/>
I just read about an hour ago to calm an upset child is to bring them close <br/>
to you, give them a hug. We are all human and sometimes, yes even as adults <br/>
we need a hug.<br/>
To meet other Unschooling families<br/>

&lt;&lt;thank you for thinking of me and letting me know once again that my <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;I do appreciate you pointing out yet again that <br/>

&lt;&lt;Please point out to me how that is flawed thinking? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The examples you gave were schoolish.  They were academic.  No more, no less.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I get some really GOOD ADVICE here. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you do.  LOTS of good advice.  And you choose a litte bit of it to <br/>
accept and a huge amount to reject, repeatedly, repetitively.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I don&#39;t ask, if I don&#39;t talk about or discuss where I am and what my <br/>
thinking is, how will anyone ever point out to me the flaws in my thinking <br/>
and help me to find this nirvana that you have?&gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306208489">Hi Glena<br/>
<br/>
commisserating (sp?) with you, since I&#39;ve been in your boat. &quot;HOw <br/>
will they ever get along if they don&#39;t learn (Fill in the blank)?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I recommended the Sudbury site for you to click around in, and now <br/>
I&#39;m going to prescribe: John Holt&#39;s writings. Also, John Taylor <br/>
Gatto. These authors rocked my world, and redefined education (it&#39;s <br/>
about learning, not teaching) for me. <br/>
<br/>
I used to post lots of questions here, similar to yours, then I went <br/>
away for a few months, and read the above authors and learned this: <br/>
There IS no core knowledge that everyone must have in order to <br/>
succeed. Many successful, happy people move along in life just fine <br/>
without (fill in the blank).<br/>
<br/>
Every human being needs to know different things, and each human <br/>
being will learn the things he needs to know. In an unschooling <br/>
scenario, when the need comes up, the learner will find someone to <br/>
teach it to him. And then! it&#39;ll be like a sponge sucking up <br/>
moisture, the learning will come so easy and so fast and the kid will <br/>
love it...until he masters it, or turns to something else. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s happening with my eight year old whose &quot;formal math education&quot; <br/>
amounted to my teaching her how to write her numbers when she was <br/>
five. While I was busy fretting about her late verbal abilities, she <br/>
was figuring out how to subtract, how many quarters in $1.00, .50, <br/>
and .75, how to count by two, five, ten, and heh 25, how to tell time <br/>
without any help from me. That, even more than Holt and Gatto, is <br/>
what brought me back to this group. The fact that my kid was picking <br/>
up math without me teaching it to her, thus proving not only what is <br/>
being said here and at several unschooling pages (articles), but also <br/>
what Holt and Gatto say in their writings: the human brain will take <br/>
up knowledge. It&#39;s part of us. <br/>
<br/>
The point is, when your girl is ready to get into algebra, she will. <br/>
But she might not ever, and that&#39;s okay. But if you let her come to <br/>
algebra on her own, so that she is learning it because she needs it <br/>
or wants it, she will be more likely to learn it well, than if she is <br/>
told she needs it, reminded that she needs it, hinted at that she <br/>
should learn it, etc. and finally gives in and forces herself to <br/>
learn it, in order to please someone else besides herself.<br/>
<br/>
sheesh. I didn&#39;t mean to go on so long. I&#39;m at the very beginning of <br/>
trusting this, myself. I&#39;m going to be biting my tongue IN HALF while <br/>
my middle child (by far the most &quot;schooled&quot; of the three) deschools. <br/>
But I do know that they&#39;ll learn what life teaches them they need to <br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
peace, heidiC who is just at the beginning of this unschooling thing, <br/>
herself.<br/>
