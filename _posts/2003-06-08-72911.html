<div id="ygrps-yiv-128792222">My DH went to high school with Kyle Chandler and they still e-mail each other.  I think kyle is glad to have a friend who is so far removed from the Hollywood scene.   I told DH that someone here (was it Mary?) is a fan and called him &quot;doable&quot; and he is going to pass on the info. to kyle who i think will get a big kick out of being added to such a prestigious list of &quot;doables&quot;.   I met him twice.  He is very grounded and a great dad and husband, and really cute too!<br/>

&lt;&lt;My DH went to high school with Kyle Chandler and they still e-mail each<br/>
other.  I think kyle is glad to have a friend who is so far removed from the<br/>
Hollywood scene.   I told DH that someone here (was it Mary?) is a fan and<br/>
called him &quot;doable&quot; and he is going to pass on the info. to kyle who i think<br/>
will get a big kick out of being added to such a prestigious list of<br/>
&quot;doables&quot;.   I met him twice.  He is very grounded and a great dad and<br/>

Sorry, guess it was someone else! He was the lead actor on &quot;Early Edition&quot; (about the newspaper that tells the next day&#39;s events)and is about to be on somr new show with a ton of other great actors this fall - can&#39;t remember the name. he was also on a great show with Joan Cusack (I love her) that got cancelled after one season. <br/>

was the one who said he was do-able, yet I couldn&#39;t remember his name!!! LOL I <br/>
don&#39;t know that you should share that part with him though, he may think I was <br/>
calling him a one-nite stand!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-906680975">Was this the same guy that was on a show that took place during WWII and he tries to get onto a baseball team?  I&#39;m thinking it is....  I watched the first few episodes of Early Edition because of that.   Unfortunately I didn&#39;t like this show enough to watch every week.   Having said that I&#39;ll have to agree this guy is definitely do-able in my book too.  lol  I&#39;m really glad to hear what a cool guy really is.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oooooh, oh yeah, he used to play a pro baseball player in a series that was <br/>
on about 10 years ago. Can&#39;t remember the name of that either. Home something <br/>
or something home. It was a WWII drama series. DH and I were addicted but it <br/>
only lasted, I think, one season.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who thinks Kyle Chandler is do-able and even more so now that I&#39;m <br/>
reminded he has a name.<br/>
