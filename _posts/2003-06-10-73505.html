No NO, Brenda!  I&#39;ve seen quite a few introverts.  I agree with Julie<br/>

<br/>
I really think having four children had turned me into a &quot;J&quot;.  I have<br/>
always hung on that borderline, but  I realized last year what an<br/>
extreme planner I had become.  That all changed when we moved and both<br/>
my parents became critically ill at the same time.  I learned that<br/>
planning for much more than the next moment was almost useless.  I am<br/>
much more strongly in the &quot;go with the flow&quot;, spontaneity live in the<br/>
moment and don&#39;t think of tomorrow mode these days.<br/>

Internet. It&#39;s been such a great vehicle for getting to know these <br/>
otherwise more guarded ladies.<br/>
<br/>
And one of my INFJ friends says that Is need Es to catalyze them. <br/>
That&#39;s why lots of marriages are a combo.<br/>
<br/>
I figure there are as many Is unschooling as Es, but Es are just <br/>
so much more vocal on email lists. :)<br/>

extreme planner I had become.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the questions that really bothered me was about spontaneity or <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
I DO plan, but when plans fail I&#39;m in my finest element---the emergency <br/>
rescue.<br/>
I don&#39;t plan for emergency rescues, but I thrive there.<br/>
<br/>
Here were my quibble-points:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You consider the scientific approach to be the best&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
REAL scientific approach, yes.  Observation and logic, testing and openness.<br/>
Not what passes for scientific method lately, which is prove the first <br/>
correlation and use it to sell something or justify continuing the status quo.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You know how to put every minute of your<br/>
time to good purpose&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I suspect the person who wrote that wouldn&#39;t consider hanging out in the yard <br/>
talking, or sleeping late, or vegetating a day or two a week to be &quot;good <br/>
purpose.&quot;   If I get to define &quot;purpose,&quot; then HELL yes, I put ever SECOND to good <br/>
purpose.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You are inclined to rely more on improvisation<br/>
than on careful planning&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
That was the one.  Improvisation.  <br/>
My careful planning is sometimes overwhelmed by others&#39; failures, and so I <br/>
improvise really well.  I relay on my ability to improvise when the careful <br/>
planning occasionally fails.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Strict observance of the established rules<br/>
is likely to prevent attaining a good outcome&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Insufficient information.  Give me a specific situation and I shall detail it <br/>
into the 8th move.  <br/>
I don&#39;t play chess well, but I can play complex situations the way good chess <br/>
players play chess.<br/>
What rules?  What was the outcome?  What&#39;s at stake?  Who&#39;s involved?<br/>
Some rules are worth observing.  &quot;The established rules&quot; is no elemental <br/>
concept.<br/>

Caring for Your Introvert <br/>
<br/>
The habits and needs of a little-understood group<br/>
<br/>
by Jonathan Rauch <br/>
<br/>
..... <br/>
<br/>
o you know someone who needs hours alone every day? Who loves quiet <br/>
conversations about feelings or ideas, and can give a dynamite <br/>
presentation to a big audience, but seems awkward in groups and <br/>
maladroit at small talk? Who has to be dragged to parties and then <br/>
needs the rest of the day to recuperate? Who growls or scowls or <br/>
grunts or winces when accosted with pleasantries by people who are <br/>
just trying to be nice?<br/>
<br/>
If so, do you tell this person he is &quot;too serious,&quot; or ask if he is <br/>
okay? Regard him as aloof, arrogant, rude? Redouble your efforts to <br/>
draw him out?<br/>
<br/>
If you answered yes to these questions, chances are that you have an <br/>
introvert on your hands-and that you aren&#39;t caring for him properly. <br/>
Science has learned a good deal in recent years about the habits and <br/>
requirements of introverts. It has even learned, by means of brain <br/>
scans, that introverts process information differently from other <br/>
people (I am not making this up). If you are behind the curve on this <br/>
important matter, be reassured that you are not alone. Introverts may <br/>
be common, but they are also among the most misunderstood and <br/>
aggrieved groups in America, possibly the world.<br/>
<br/>
I know. My name is Jonathan, and I am an introvert.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, for years I denied it. After all, I have good social skills. I am <br/>
not morose or misanthropic. Usually. I am far from shy. I love long <br/>
conversations that explore intimate thoughts or passionate interests. <br/>
But at last I have self-identified and come out to my friends and <br/>
colleagues. In doing so, I have found myself liberated from any <br/>
number of damaging misconceptions and stereotypes. Now I am here to <br/>
tell you what you need to know in order to respond sensitively and <br/>
supportively to your own introverted family members, friends, and <br/>
colleagues. Remember, someone you know, respect, and interact with <br/>
every day is an introvert, and you are probably driving this person <br/>
nuts. It pays to learn the warning signs.<br/>
<br/>
What is introversion? In its modern sense, the concept goes back to <br/>
the 1920s and the psychologist Carl Jung. Today it is a mainstay of <br/>
personality tests, including the widely used Myers-Briggs Type <br/>
Indicator. Introverts are not necessarily shy. Shy people are anxious <br/>
or frightened or self-excoriating in social settings; introverts <br/>
generally are not. Introverts are also not misanthropic, though some <br/>
of us do go along with Sartre as far as to say &quot;Hell is other people <br/>
at breakfast.&quot; Rather, introverts are people who find other people <br/>
tiring.<br/>
<br/>
Extroverts are energized by people, and wilt or fade when alone. They <br/>
often seem bored by themselves, in both senses of the _expression. <br/>
Leave an extrovert alone for two minutes and he will reach for his <br/>
cell phone. In contrast, after an hour or two of being socially &quot;on,&quot; <br/>
we introverts need to turn off and recharge. My own formula is <br/>
roughly two hours alone for every hour of socializing. This isn&#39;t <br/>
antisocial. It isn&#39;t a sign of depression. It does not call for <br/>
medication. For introverts, to be alone with our thoughts is as <br/>
restorative as sleeping, as nourishing as eating. Our motto: &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
okay, you&#39;re okay-in small doses.&quot;<br/>
How many people are introverts? I performed exhaustive research on <br/>
this question, in the form of a quick Google search. The answer: <br/>
About 25 percent. Or: Just under half. Or-my favorite-&quot;a minority in <br/>
the regular population but a majority in the gifted population.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Are introverts misunderstood? Wildly. That, it appears, is our lot in <br/>
life. &quot;It is very difficult for an extrovert to understand an <br/>
introvert,&quot; write the education experts Jill D. Burruss and Lisa <br/>
Kaenzig. (They are also the source of the quotation in the previous <br/>
paragraph.) Extroverts are easy for introverts to understand, because <br/>
extroverts spend so much of their time working out who they are in <br/>
voluble, and frequently inescapable, interaction with other people. <br/>
They are as inscrutable as puppy dogs. But the street does not run <br/>
both ways. Extroverts have little or no grasp of introversion. They <br/>
assume that company, especially their own, is always welcome. They <br/>
cannot imagine why someone would need to be alone; indeed, they often <br/>
take umbrage at the suggestion. As often as I have tried to explain <br/>
the matter to extroverts, I have never sensed that any of them really <br/>
understood. They listen for a moment and then go back to barking and <br/>
yipping.<br/>
<br/>
Are introverts oppressed? I would have to say so. For one thing, <br/>
extroverts are overrepresented in politics, a profession in which <br/>
only the garrulous are really comfortable. Look at George W. Bush. <br/>
Look at Bill Clinton. They seem to come fully to life only around <br/>
other people. To think of the few introverts who did rise to the top <br/>
in politics-Calvin Coolidge, Richard Nixon-is merely to drive home <br/>
the point. With the possible exception of Ronald Reagan, whose fabled <br/>
aloofness and privateness were probably signs of a deep introverted <br/>
streak (many actors, I&#39;ve read, are introverts, and many introverts, <br/>
when socializing, feel like actors), introverts are not <br/>
considered &quot;naturals&quot; in politics.<br/>
<br/>
Extroverts therefore dominate public life. This is a pity. If we <br/>
introverts ran the world, it would no doubt be a calmer, saner, more <br/>
peaceful sort of place. As Coolidge is supposed to have said, &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>
you know that four fifths of all our troubles in this life would <br/>
disappear if we would just sit down and keep still?&quot; (He is also <br/>
supposed to have said, &quot;If you don&#39;t say anything, you won&#39;t be <br/>
called on to repeat it.&quot; The only thing a true introvert dislikes <br/>
more than talking about himself is repeating himself.)<br/>
<br/>
With their endless appetite for talk and attention, extroverts also <br/>
dominate social life, so they tend to set expectations. In our <br/>
extrovertist society, being outgoing is considered normal and <br/>
therefore desirable, a mark of happiness, confidence, leadership. <br/>
Extroverts are seen as bighearted, vibrant, warm, empathic. &quot;People <br/>
person&quot; is a compliment. Introverts are described with words <br/>
like &quot;guarded,&quot; &quot;loner,&quot; &quot;reserved,&quot; &quot;taciturn,&quot; &quot;self-<br/>
contained,&quot; &quot;private&quot;-narrow, ungenerous words, words that suggest <br/>
emotional parsimony and smallness of personality. Female introverts, <br/>
I suspect, must suffer especially. In certain circles, particularly <br/>
in the Midwest, a man can still sometimes get away with being what <br/>
they used to call a strong and silent type; introverted women, <br/>
lacking that alternative, are even more likely than men to be <br/>
perceived as timid, withdrawn, haughty.<br/>
<br/>
Are introverts arrogant? Hardly. I suppose this common misconception <br/>
has to do with our being more intelligent, more reflective, more <br/>
independent, more level-headed, more refined, and more sensitive than <br/>
extroverts. Also, it is probably due to our lack of small talk, a <br/>
lack that extroverts often mistake for disdain. We tend to think <br/>
before talking, whereas extroverts tend to think by talking, which is <br/>
why their meetings never last less than six hours. &quot;Introverts,&quot; <br/>
writes a perceptive fellow named Thomas P. Crouser, in an online <br/>
review of a recent book called Why Should Extroverts Make All the <br/>
Money? (I&#39;m not making that up, either), &quot;are driven to distraction <br/>
by the semi-internal dialogue extroverts tend to conduct. Introverts <br/>
don&#39;t outwardly complain, instead roll their eyes and silently curse <br/>
the darkness.&quot; Just so.<br/>
<br/>
The worst of it is that extroverts have no idea of the torment they <br/>
put us through. Sometimes, as we gasp for air amid the fog of their <br/>
98-percent-content-free talk, we wonder if extroverts even bother to <br/>
listen to themselves. Still, we endure stoically, because the <br/>
etiquette books-written, no doubt, by extroverts-regard declining to <br/>
banter as rude and gaps in conversation as awkward. We can only dream <br/>
that someday, when our condition is more widely understood, when <br/>
perhaps an Introverts&#39; Rights movement has blossomed and borne fruit, <br/>
it will not be impolite to say &quot;I&#39;m an introvert. You are a wonderful <br/>
person and I like you. But now please shush.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How can I let the introvert in my life know that I support him and <br/>
respect his choice? First, recognize that it&#39;s not a choice. It&#39;s not <br/>
a lifestyle. It&#39;s an orientation.<br/>
<br/>
Second, when you see an introvert lost in thought, don&#39;t say &quot;What&#39;s <br/>
the matter?&quot; or &quot;Are you all right?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Third, don&#39;t say anything else, either.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-567028148">I am a strong introvert,  but actually was a quite effective public<br/>
speaker a few years back (in my working days).  Introverts-intuitives<br/>
can usually articulate well in writing.  I think e-lists are hard due to<br/>
the fact that introverts generally tend to mull things over before<br/>
responding.  Often the subjects have changed a week later, or the<br/>
extroverts have already articulated it well enough.   But communicating<br/>
in articles or books is good....if you can get readers.  <br/>
<br/>
And again,  many introverts are excellent public speakers or communicate<br/>
well with small groups.  I think introverts would be important for grass<br/>
roots movements.  And I think Brenda pointed out....introverts DO<br/>
function well in large groups,  but would not choose to spend lots of<br/>
time there,  and may need alone time to recuperate from the energy<br/>
drain.<br/>

Caring for Your Introvert <br/>
<br/>
The habits and needs of a little-understood group<br/>
<br/>
by Jonathan Rauch <br/>
<br/>
..... <br/>
<br/>
o you know someone who needs hours alone every day? Who loves quiet <br/>
conversations about feelings or ideas, and can give a dynamite <br/>
presentation to a big audience, but seems awkward in groups and <br/>
maladroit at small talk? Who has to be dragged to parties and then <br/>
needs the rest of the day to recuperate? Who growls or scowls or <br/>
grunts or winces when accosted with pleasantries by people who are <br/>
just trying to be nice?<br/>
<br/>
If so, do you tell this person he is &quot;too serious,&quot; or ask if he is <br/>
okay? Regard him as aloof, arrogant, rude? Redouble your efforts to <br/>
draw him out?<br/>
<br/>
If you answered yes to these questions, chances are that you have an <br/>
introvert on your hands-and that you aren&#39;t caring for him properly. <br/>
Science has learned a good deal in recent years about the habits and <br/>
requirements of introverts. It has even learned, by means of brain <br/>
scans, that introverts process information differently from other <br/>
people (I am not making this up). If you are behind the curve on this <br/>
important matter, be reassured that you are not alone. Introverts may <br/>
be common, but they are also among the most misunderstood and <br/>
aggrieved groups in America, possibly the world.<br/>
<br/>
I know. My name is Jonathan, and I am an introvert.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, for years I denied it. After all, I have good social skills. I am <br/>
not morose or misanthropic. Usually. I am far from shy. I love long <br/>
conversations that explore intimate thoughts or passionate interests. <br/>
But at last I have self-identified and come out to my friends and <br/>
colleagues. In doing so, I have found myself liberated from any <br/>
number of damaging misconceptions and stereotypes. Now I am here to <br/>
tell you what you need to know in order to respond sensitively and <br/>
supportively to your own introverted family members, friends, and <br/>
colleagues. Remember, someone you know, respect, and interact with <br/>
every day is an introvert, and you are probably driving this person <br/>
nuts. It pays to learn the warning signs.<br/>
<br/>
What is introversion? In its modern sense, the concept goes back to <br/>
the 1920s and the psychologist Carl Jung. Today it is a mainstay of <br/>
personality tests, including the widely used Myers-Briggs Type <br/>
Indicator. Introverts are not necessarily shy. Shy people are anxious <br/>
or frightened or self-excoriating in social settings; introverts <br/>
generally are not. Introverts are also not misanthropic, though some <br/>
of us do go along with Sartre as far as to say &quot;Hell is other people <br/>
at breakfast.&quot; Rather, introverts are people who find other people <br/>
tiring.<br/>
<br/>
Extroverts are energized by people, and wilt or fade when alone. They <br/>
often seem bored by themselves, in both senses of the _expression. <br/>
Leave an extrovert alone for two minutes and he will reach for his <br/>
cell phone. In contrast, after an hour or two of being socially &quot;on,&quot; <br/>
we introverts need to turn off and recharge. My own formula is <br/>
roughly two hours alone for every hour of socializing. This isn&#39;t <br/>
antisocial. It isn&#39;t a sign of depression. It does not call for <br/>
medication. For introverts, to be alone with our thoughts is as <br/>
restorative as sleeping, as nourishing as eating. Our motto: &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
okay, you&#39;re okay-in small doses.&quot;<br/>
How many people are introverts? I performed exhaustive research on <br/>
this question, in the form of a quick Google search. The answer: <br/>
About 25 percent. Or: Just under half. Or-my favorite-&quot;a minority in <br/>
the regular population but a majority in the gifted population.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Are introverts misunderstood? Wildly. That, it appears, is our lot in <br/>
life. &quot;It is very difficult for an extrovert to understand an <br/>
introvert,&quot; write the education experts Jill D. Burruss and Lisa <br/>
Kaenzig. (They are also the source of the quotation in the previous <br/>
paragraph.) Extroverts are easy for introverts to understand, because <br/>
extroverts spend so much of their time working out who they are in <br/>
voluble, and frequently inescapable, interaction with other people. <br/>
They are as inscrutable as puppy dogs. But the street does not run <br/>
both ways. Extroverts have little or no grasp of introversion. They <br/>
assume that company, especially their own, is always welcome. They <br/>
cannot imagine why someone would need to be alone; indeed, they often <br/>
take umbrage at the suggestion. As often as I have tried to explain <br/>
the matter to extroverts, I have never sensed that any of them really <br/>
understood. They listen for a moment and then go back to barking and <br/>
yipping.<br/>
<br/>
Are introverts oppressed? I would have to say so. For one thing, <br/>
extroverts are overrepresented in politics, a profession in which <br/>
only the garrulous are really comfortable. Look at George W. Bush. <br/>
Look at Bill Clinton. They seem to come fully to life only around <br/>
other people. To think of the few introverts who did rise to the top <br/>
in politics-Calvin Coolidge, Richard Nixon-is merely to drive home <br/>
the point. With the possible exception of Ronald Reagan, whose fabled <br/>
aloofness and privateness were probably signs of a deep introverted <br/>
streak (many actors, I&#39;ve read, are introverts, and many introverts, <br/>
when socializing, feel like actors), introverts are not <br/>
considered &quot;naturals&quot; in politics.<br/>
<br/>
Extroverts therefore dominate public life. This is a pity. If we <br/>
introverts ran the world, it would no doubt be a calmer, saner, more <br/>
peaceful sort of place. As Coolidge is supposed to have said, &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>
you know that four fifths of all our troubles in this life would <br/>
disappear if we would just sit down and keep still?&quot; (He is also <br/>
supposed to have said, &quot;If you don&#39;t say anything, you won&#39;t be <br/>
called on to repeat it.&quot; The only thing a true introvert dislikes <br/>
more than talking about himself is repeating himself.)<br/>
<br/>

dominate social life, so they tend to set expectations. In our <br/>
extrovertist society, being outgoing is considered normal and <br/>
therefore desirable, a mark of happiness, confidence, leadership. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134201314">Thanks Tim for catching me on that Good/Bad label I seem to put on people. <br/>
Very nasty habit of mine I wish I could kick!<br/>
<br/>
That is so strange that feeling psychic is a common feeling for INFJ people. <br/>
I, in no means think I am psychic but maybe that explains all the feelings and <br/>
thoughts I&#39;ve had since childhood. I&#39;m being honest here, I normally don&#39;t <br/>
tell people any of this anymore because they don&#39;t believe me or they think I&#39;m <br/>
strange! <br/>
For example about 2 years ago, I was washing dishes and I had this thought <br/>
that my parents (who are retired and live alone) would have their house broken <br/>
into. No reason why, I was just doing dishes. I told my parents that night <br/>
because this thought bugged me all day. They told me that they would make sure to <br/>
lock the doors and they did every night. 10 days later, my parents woke in the <br/>
middle of the night to an intruder in the house who was going through my <br/>
mothers jewelry. This guy had got in through a window, the doors were locked. <br/>
<br/>
My mother said when I was little I would always say things like that I vision <br/>
something happening/had happened or I know that person is up to no good and <br/>
so on. As I get older though I find that I have more and more vibes when <br/>
meeting people and more visions & thoughts during the day but none at night while I <br/>
sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Another one of the many thoughts I had was on my wedding day. When I said &quot;I <br/>
Do&quot; to my then husband.&lt;g&gt;Really! I had this awful thought that I would not be <br/>
with this man, who I thought I loved very much, for more than a year. I <br/>
chalked it up to insecurity but thought it was odd because I&#39;ve really never been <br/>
insecure BUT I did have a funny feeling about him. My parents said it was <br/>
probably that I was scared to get married because I was young. 11 months after the <br/>
wedding, he left and took everything we owned with him, including all of our <br/>
money! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned over the years to pay more attention to my thoughts, vibes and <br/>
such. I really believed for along time that maybe I had these thoughts because <br/>
I wanted things like that to happen. I am definitely learning otherwise!<br/>
<br/>
The first day I took our son to the new school here (we had just moved here), <br/>
I had a really odd feeling come over me. Weird but true. As my husband and I <br/>
stood there waiting for our son to enter the school (he was standing in line) <br/>
I saw this boy waiting in another line for a different class than our sons. I <br/>
thought that the boy was trouble and that he would one day cause our son a lot <br/>
of misery. He was just standing there! My husband told me that was <br/>
ridiculous, the kid wasn&#39;t even in our sons class, just the mommy worries. After 3 <br/>
months of school, that same boy was transferred to our sons class because he <br/>
couldn&#39;t get along with the kids in the class he was in. He tormented our son every <br/>
day and in the end he was the leader of the kids that caused our sons injuries.<br/>

Yes.<br/>
<br/>
We have lately been discussing &quot;the bathroom in [one&#39;s] pants,&quot; as when <br/>
someone &quot;goes to the bathroom in his pants.&quot;  Euphemisms are so funny sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
So as to the topic above,  it&#39;s bad enough I have a bathrom in my pants <br/>
without letting someone ELSE use it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Hey Brenda!  Over here! ::Waving:: (in that quiet introverted way &lt;g&gt;). I&#39;m<br/>
an INFJ too - and same as you, strong I & J, weaker on the N & F. I actually<br/>
got 100% for introversion - doesn&#39;t surprise me at all (or anyone else that<br/>
knows me).  Too bad I&#39;m not coming to the conference, I won&#39;t get to meet<br/>
you (course I&#39;d have to run and hide for a while afterwards anyhow &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Thought I&#39;d pass on for the introverts here, a book I read recently called<br/>
The Introvert Advantage. It really helped me understand a lot more about my<br/>
(frequently misunderstood) personality - I was shocked how much more insight<br/>
I now have into what goes on in my head and how to meet my own needs. Sorry<br/>
I can&#39;t remember the author and feeling too lazy to look it up right now but<br/>
I know it&#39;s at amazon.com<br/>
