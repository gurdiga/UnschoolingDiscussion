<br/>
I showed Lee several places we could use and he chose that one, partly  <br/>
for the background probably, and partly maybe because there was a big  <br/>
empty table there for equipment (perhaps).<br/>
<br/>
The room we were in was documented last year because someone said I  <br/>
was an anti-intellectual or anti-book person or something.<br/>

<br/>
The second video there.  The chair that shows when I was showing the  <br/>
folklore and philosophy section is right where I was sitting the day  <br/>
Lee Stranahan recorded that interview!   The card table wasn&#39;t there.   <br/>
There was a big jigsaw puzzle there the day of the library tour, and I  <br/>
don&#39;t think I ever did turn around and show the table.  It&#39;s a folding  <br/>
gate-leg table, and it&#39;s not always up and out in there, but it was  <br/>
both of those days.<br/>

That can be nearly dangerous!  There are some odd things in there.   <br/>
One person has a rant or two (presentation) about unschooling, and  <br/>
then one assuring the world that Christmas is actually some kind of  <br/>
mushroom-worshiping holiday and all should do &#39;shrooms.   (If that  <br/>
person is on this list, I&#39;m not apologizing.   Sheesh!  Way to make us  <br/>
all look like lunatics!)<br/>
<br/>
There are some that are reviews of what others have written and said,  <br/>
designed to funnel people toward certain websites or beliefs and away  <br/>
from the general availability of unschooling information.  That  <br/>
bothers me.   I did name my website, but the very first page leads out  <br/>
to lots of other websites.   God knows I don&#39;t try to keep people  <br/>
stuck on my pages or this list.    I&#39;m saying all the time &quot;If you  <br/>
don&#39;t like it, scoot!&quot;  (I guess I&#39;ve not said it in exactly those  <br/>
words until now...)<br/>
<br/>
The quality of information and motive isn&#39;t uniformly high.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few things that could be easily uploaded and put to an  <br/>
iPod or mp3 player, and some of those are available because of Lee  <br/>
Stranahan too (and Lauren, who&#39;s on this list).  You can go to the  <br/>
source of these and download them directly to listen to elsewhere.   <br/>
They&#39;re me, and one has me and Richard Prystowsky, and one is Ren  <br/>
Allen and me:<br/>

<br/>
Uh... Thanks!   Yes, thanks.  I had to think about it a minute. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I always think Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s site is the ultimate convincer of  <br/>
husbands.   But hey, we have LOTS for them (and increasing more).<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/dads">http://sandradodd.com/dads</a><br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t write as much as we do, those dads.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lyleperry">http://sandradodd.com/lyleperry</a><br/>
<br/>
Lyle Perry did write a lot, for a while.  Although he didn&#39;t talk  <br/>
about it much on the list, he was working and being house-husband and  <br/>
taking care of his two boys and his wife, who was bedridden with  <br/>
mental illness, but he kept on taking care of her and dealing with her  <br/>
parents who acted like (and said!) there was nothing wrong with her,  <br/>
she was fine.   He wanted to get unschooling quickly, and he did.  He  <br/>
helped others get it too, by being willing to share his changing  <br/>
thoughts in public.<br/>
<br/>
They moved from the small midwestern home in which they had grown up  <br/>
to a mountainous western place (not near me, unfortunately) and I  <br/>
still hear from him occasionally.  They&#39;re ALL, every one of them,  <br/>
much better.   They all get out and explore and his kids have been  <br/>
offered opportunities kind of the way my kids have, and it&#39;s good!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to find a few families to keep up with on the side, too, as  <br/>
you move into and through this unschooling world.  Not everyone can  <br/>
share everything online, but sometimes side friendships can blossom  <br/>
and stay.<br/>
<br/>
Also, January in Santa Fe, there will be a whole Friday afternoon for  <br/>
the dads to talk without moms saying &quot;Yeah, but.&quot;   It pains me to  <br/>
think of the things Keith might say, because he still comes out with  <br/>
some ghost-inside-him sayings now and again, but I bet with the group  <br/>
of them all in one place some strength will come, too.  And laughter,  <br/>
for sure, because I know sometimes the guys are afraid.   It will help  <br/>
for them to see the dads of teens being calm and smiling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My husband will be there, too. He definitely has his own unique <br/>
perspective on unschooling. He&#39;s from Iran - such a different culture <br/>
than the one we live in. So he had to make two HUGE shifts, over the <br/>
years. First to a Southern California American culture and then to <br/>
radical unschooling. If you think radical unschooling is a shift for <br/>
westerners, think about what an incredible shift it is for someone who <br/>
comes from such a paternalistic, authoritarian, traditional, and <br/>
sometimes quite brutal and oppressive cultural background. His schooling <br/>
was brutal by our worst public school standards. It was 6 days per week, <br/>
much longer school days. The typical educational method involved <br/>
assigning work to be done at home and then presented in front of the <br/>
class. Those whose presentations were not adequate were shamed and <br/>
humiliated and physically punished. For example, the teacher would weave <br/>
a pencil between a child&#39;s fingers and, with the hand flat on the desk, <br/>
the teacher would hit their hand. The teacher would put rice on the <br/>
floor and make the child kneel on it with bare knees, for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is  kind and gentle and sweet. He was raised in what I&#39;d call <br/>
a very enlightened family. He came to this country at 23 years old, <br/>
though, so he grew up with all that stuff. Children were expected to <br/>
jump when told to jump and to be extremely obedient - obedience is a <br/>
very highly valued trait in that culture.<br/>
<br/>
He has adjusted to unschooling, never really fully &quot;getting it&quot; but <br/>
knowing that our kids were doing well. Over time, he&#39;s been pretty happy <br/>
with it. Most definitely he&#39;s happy with the kinds of relationships we <br/>
have with our kids which is VERY different than any adult-child <br/>
relationships he&#39;d ever known. He&#39;s still a little taken aback with how <br/>
independent our kids are and how self-confident they are. He still <br/>
sometimes thinks they should &quot;ask permission&quot; more often. Rosie, who is <br/>
18, has planned a trip with her boyfriend and other friends to go visit <br/>
someone two states away - they&#39;ll be gone about 2 weeks. They&#39;re very <br/>
responsible and are carefully making plans. Great kids. But he was <br/>
irritated that she told us they were going instead of asking if she <br/>
could go. These kinds of irritations pop up for him - mostly it has to <br/>
do with this kind of thing - them making their own (big) plans. Partly <br/>
this is his reaction to them growing up, too. In Iran, as long as girls <br/>
aren&#39;t married, while they still live at home, they are completely under <br/>
the thumb of their father. They wouldn&#39;t dream of making plans without <br/>
getting his approval first.<br/>
<br/>
So - each step of the way, as we&#39;ve moved from babies to toddlers to <br/>
mid-age children to teens to young adults, there have been new <br/>
challenges for him. It hasn&#39;t always been easy.<br/>

So - like Sandra - I cringe a little thinking of what my husband MIGHT <br/>
say, but it will be good for other dads to hear his concerns and how <br/>
they&#39;ve evaporated (again and again). It&#39;ll probably be good for my <br/>
husband, too. He doesn&#39;t spend much time thinking about any of this <br/>
stuff - it&#39;ll help him to look back over the years and get some perspective.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-537677280">-=- Rosie, who is<br/>
18, has planned a trip with her boyfriend and other friends to go visit<br/>
someone two states away - they&#39;ll be gone about 2 weeks. They&#39;re very<br/>
responsible and are carefully making plans. Great kids. But he was<br/>
irritated that she told us they were going instead of asking if she<br/>
could go. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I read this to Holly, and we got big eyes.   I said &quot;Marty still asks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly said &quot;We always ask.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Yeah, but sometimes it means  &#39;...so will you help make sure  <br/>
this happens?&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They ask.  Our answer would never be &quot;no you can&#39;t,&quot; but it might be  <br/>
&quot;Have you thought about this, and this and this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then I said Marty didn&#39;t ask when he, Brett Henry and Julie McClure  <br/>
got the wild idea to to see Kirby RIGHT THEN.   But he did come and  <br/>
tell us, as he was gathering stuff up and we were asking him all kinds  <br/>
of checklisty questions and asking whether they might not want to wait  <br/>
until the next week, but they were fired up to go.   He was 19, they  <br/>
went in Brett&#39;s car, and they were back in two days.   Because of  <br/>
phones and  texts, we were able to know where they were and that they  <br/>
were fine.  We had a chance to talk him out of it.  He didn&#39;t sneak  <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids ask if they can do something, it&#39;s not with the  <br/>
expectation that we&#39;ll say &quot;no.&quot;  It&#39;s the same way I ask Keith or  <br/>
Keith asks me.   It&#39;s &quot;Am I forgetting a prior commitment, or would I  <br/>
be unavailable for something I didn&#39;t know about, or is the car needed  <br/>
for other things?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course Rosie &quot;asked&quot; about the trip in many ways. She didn&#39;t count on <br/>
it without running it by us, but her approach was not to go to him and <br/>
say, &quot;I would like your permission to begin planning this trip.&quot; It was <br/>
the group of friends, over time, vaguely talking about it and, <br/>
eventually, the timing seemed right and the possibility became real. It <br/>
developed. And then she ran it by us, when it seemed like they might <br/>
really be able to make it happen.<br/>
<br/>
The first I heard of it was, &quot;Hey, we&#39;re thinking about going up to <br/>
Washington to visit Davin.&quot; Pause. Waiting for my input. Me: &quot;Good <br/>
idea.Who is going and when are you thinking of going?&quot; Rosie tells me <br/>
who is involved and says: &quot;We still need to figure out how long it&#39;ll <br/>
take to get there and how long we want to stay and all that.&quot; Me: <br/>
&quot;You&#39;ll need somewhere to stay along the way, too, because it is too far <br/>
to drive in one day - its probably around 20 hours of actual driving <br/>
time.&quot; Rosie: &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m just running it by you to see what you think, <br/>
we haven&#39;t got the plans all made yet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Followed by a LOT of discussions about dates and where to stay and did <br/>
his mom want you to stay there and lots of other considerations.<br/>
<br/>
Cyrus heard about it the same way - but with the plans a little more <br/>
firm-sounding because she&#39;d already talked to me.<br/>
<br/>
And it is all still under discussion and the original dates were <br/>
switched around to make room for a soccer tournament that Cyrus was <br/>
thinking about taking a team to, but hadn&#39;t mentioned to anybody yet.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t like she would come and sort of belligerently say, &quot;I&#39;m going <br/>
on a trip and you can&#39;t stop me and I don&#39;t care whether it is <br/>
convenient for you or not,&quot; or anything like that.<br/>
<br/>
If Holly and Brett decided they&#39;d like to take a trip to, say, <br/>
California (which would be cool, by the way), they probably wouldn&#39;t go <br/>
to Keith and say, &quot;We are coming to for your permission to take a trip <br/>
to California. Do you give us your permission or not?&quot; They&#39;d probably <br/>
say, &quot;We were thinking about a trip to California. What do you think?&quot; <br/>
And then discuss it. And they&#39;d be asking with the assumption that he&#39;d <br/>
be helpful in figuring out how to make it happen or in helping them see <br/>
why it wasn&#39;t a good idea. They really wouldn&#39;t be going to him simply <br/>
for his &quot;permission&quot; - his absolute &quot;yes&quot; versus &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What Cyrus&#39;s background gives him is the urge to be the one who gets to <br/>
make absolutely arbitrary immediate decisions for his children, no <br/>
matter how old they are or how responsible.  In his sometimes-wished-for <br/>
scenario it would go like this - Rosie: &quot;Baba, can I have your <br/>
permission to plan a trip this summer to Washington?&quot; Cyrus: &quot;No.&quot; <br/>
Rosie: &quot;Okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Done. What he wants (once in a while has the urge, I mean, not most of <br/>
the time) is that kind of unquestioning immediately obedient handing <br/>
over of control to himself. That&#39;s how he grew up. He might say, &quot;Can I <br/>
go outside?&quot; And an adult would say, &quot;No.&quot; He wasn&#39;t allowed to question <br/>
that response. He might be shamed or even hit or beaten if he questioned <br/>
it.  Our kids might just go outside or they might say, &quot;I&#39;m going out <br/>
side&quot; and wait for any objection or comment or they might say, &quot;Is it <br/>
okay with you if I go outside?&quot; and expect us to either say yes or say <br/>
why we don&#39;t think it is a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
So - he&#39;s not like this. I&#39;m afraid now I&#39;m giving a false impression. I <br/>
was confessing that, indeed, he fights these internal battles because of <br/>
HIS own background - far more extreme than most Americans, at least, can <br/>
probably imagine.<br/>
<br/>
And, once in a while, these urges rear their ugly head - usually it is <br/>
when other emotions are involved (like Rosie even HAVING a boyfriend at <br/>
all comes with its own issues for him, as her dad).<br/>
<br/>
So - I&#39;m saying he might bring up that kind of thing to the other men at <br/>
the event in Santa Fe. He doesn&#39;t go to many of the unschooling events - <br/>
he isn&#39;t that interested in talking about unschooling -too much of it is <br/>
boring to him. But he&#39;s agreed to this one - so he&#39;ll be there.<br/>

I can&#39;t predict the San Diego behavior, but I think because we&#39;re the  <br/>

This is how we were brought up too.  In America.  It was definitely <br/>

anything I would have admitted to as a child.<br/>
<br/>
Asking questions about the no&#39;s we usually received to requests was <br/>
spoken of as &quot;back talking&quot; or &quot;sassing your momma/daddy.&quot;  How&#39;s that <br/>
for old-fashioned?  We knew better than to ask &quot;why&quot; or get too <br/>
obviously disappointed because there was that &quot;don&#39;t be a baby&quot; about <br/>
disappointments and the threat of a spanking if we made them feel too <br/>

<br/>
Bob was SO good!  There were several of us, singing harmonies and I  <br/>
got to play some flute parts on the recorder, and he was great.  I  <br/>
think of that night pretty often.<br/>
<br/>
If this next January symposium in Santa Fe goes well, meaning if  <br/>
people like the facilities, I&#39;d like to do another thing specifically  <br/>
on music, and one on art (and unschooling, but mostly art and music).   <br/>
I figured it could be a couple or three days of show&#39;n&#39;tell and  <br/>
sharing knowledge and tricks.<br/>
<br/>
At the Arizona conference I did The Titanic with sing-alongs, and in  <br/>
San Diego Keith and I are going to do the Snap, Crackle, Pop song with  <br/>
the best of other singers who will learn it between now and then.   I  <br/>
just sent a solicitation to the list for that conference, and before  <br/>
Joanna reminded me of having sung with her husband years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of you will be in San Diego in September and haven&#39;t joined  <br/>
that list yet, or maybe some of you would like to learn this to sing  <br/>
it in Santa Fe in February, or just wherever. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I sent:<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no big rush to know, but if there&#39;s anyone here who feels<br/>
confident enough to sing one on a part the &quot;Snap, Crackle, Pop&quot; song,<br/>
I have a three-minute talent-show job for you.<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I are in, and we could use one more person, or four more, or<br/>
seven more... I don&#39;t care how many we have on a part, as long as<br/>
each singer is good enough to be precise so that the other parts can<br/>
be heard. There will be much confusion.<br/>
<br/>
The song is here, and I&#39;ve ordered some music, but I&#39;m not sure if it<br/>
will be over-simplified or &quot;as originally written&quot; as opposed to &quot;as<br/>
performed.&quot; If anyone goes to the song and feels brave and able,<br/>
though, please e-mail me and I&#39;ll let you know (when I know) whether<br/>
the music is useable or whether we&#39;ll be doing it by ear from this:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com/2009/03/snap-crackle-pop.html">http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com/2009/03/snap-crackle-pop.html</a><br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t need to learn all three parts, just one, so pick the one<br/>
you like best or that fits your voice best. They&#39;re all the same<br/>
range, basically, but &quot;Snap&quot; goes lower. Crackle goes to the top of<br/>
the range, but the last line in each part does the octave up to that<br/>
anyway. That last line might be the hardest part.<br/>
<br/>
After the performance, others can sing with us later, but I want<br/>
strong voices for the talent show (and then we can share it around for<br/>
the rest of the conference).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
One thing I noticed is that both yes and no are extremes.  The vast <br/>
majority of the info about doing and not doing are in between or maybe <br/>
even aside or apart from yes or no.  Guess who I noticed that from: <br/>
Karl.  He consistently avoids verbally saying yes or no.  And I think I <br/>
posted not very long ago somewhere that when I commented to Karl that <br/>
he rarely uses those words (and I was irritated about it at the time), <br/>
he said that he had already said it.  &quot;Mom, when I mean yes I do this&quot; <br/>
...  his eyes light up and a little enthusiastic body language follows. <br/>
  &quot;And when I mean no, I do this,&quot; followed by quiet and a sidelong <br/>
glance away from the conversation, so ... more body language.  I know I <br/>
do that a lot too, many times without realizing it.  It&#39;s amazing to me <br/>
how clear Karl is about that and how fuzzy I was about it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about answers.  What about questions?  They&#39;re interesting too.<br/>
<br/>
When Karl &quot;asks&quot; something it&#39;s rarely in the form of a question.  I <br/>
know I&#39;ve written about that before here on this list.  Rather than <br/>
ask, he comments about a plan to do something, and if I have an <br/>
objection to his plan for some reason he&#39;s fine with amending the plan <br/>
after a little discussion to something better or safer or more timely <br/>
or whatever.  That kind of communication builds trust in the <br/>
relationship, whereas asking for permission and waiting for a verbal <br/>
yes or no doesn&#39;t have the same kind of effect.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-885257633">I feel, like you with James, that I am so lucky to have David. He&#39;ll be talking about food choice at Life is Good, something that was once a big stumbling block for both of us. And because he watched and listened and researched and got a handle and it moved out into everything else he can tell me when to back down and to breathe and to relax. And he feels comfortable enough with his role in our family to help other people to get a handle on unschooling. I feel very lucky. <br/>

Looks like we will be at Good Vibrations. Look like we&#39;ll be doing nitrogen <br/>
ice cream. James will talk to anyone about his perspective - and he won&#39;t <br/>
support anyone in their bs. I can&#39;t even begin to fathom how much harder my <br/>
life would be with a dh who didn&#39;t get unschooling. He knows it in his heart <br/>
and soul - it&#39;s in him - intuitively. He would have been a perfect kid to be <br/>
an unschooler if only his parents were up for it. I am so lucky.<br/>

<br/>
******************************<br/>
I didn’t expect to like to lose arguments.<br/>
I enjoy it when my kids win an argument with me or Keith. We&#39;ve  <br/>
laughed about that later when we&#39;re alone. Keith used to be bothered  <br/>
if they were that way, years ago. He didn&#39;t call it &quot;talking back&quot; or  <br/>
anything, but he was surprised each time he saw it. I told him I  <br/>
figured if they could win arguments with me, they&#39;d do okay for  <br/>
themselves out in the world. That made sense to him, so he started  <br/>
willingly engaging them in &quot;yeah, but...&quot; kinds of discussions, and as  <br/>
time passed we all got better at it and clearer about our priorities.<br/>
<br/>
******************************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I answered the 20 questions survey project here (it&#39;s not up yet, but  <br/>
I&#39;ll let you know when it is) and linked the unforeseen benefits of  <br/>
unschooling.   I think I only did 18 questions, but still it was a lot  <br/>
of writing, so when the question was what was unexpected came up, I  <br/>
opted to link instead of write again.   I liked the quote above in  <br/>
light of the discussion about asking and telling and fatherly  <br/>
expectations.<br/>

ask, he comments about a plan to do something, and if I have an <br/>
objection to his plan for some reason he&#39;s fine with amending the plan <br/>
after a little discussion to something better or safer or more timely <br/>
or whatever.  That kind of communication builds trust in the <br/>
relationship, whereas asking for permission and waiting for a verbal <br/>
yes or no doesn&#39;t have the same kind of effect. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

Karl frequently comes up with something else entirely or introduces the <br/>
funniest tweaks ever.. and not infrequently, he makes it plain how I&#39;m <br/>
not right about something.  I still resist admitting that.<br/>
