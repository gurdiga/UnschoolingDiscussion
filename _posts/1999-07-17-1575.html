<div id="ygrps-yiv-777907154">Oh, they do enjoy her so much.  And she enjoys watching them.  When she gets tired of hearing them she just turns down her hearing aide!  (wouldn&#39;t that be nice some times?)<br/>
She is the one who mentioned to my Mom that she is bored and never gets out.  I think she would really enjoy going outside and watching the kids.  She always worries about us doing to much for her.  She was always taking care<br/>
of everyone else.  I keep telling her it is about time we return the favor.<br/>

&gt; Ann,<br/>
&gt; I think you will want to listen to your grandmother on what she wants to do in regard to &#39;getting out of the house&#39;.  What Lisa found with her grandmother is typical (i.e., short outings,  a few hours,  to familiar places).<br/>
&gt; Grandparents may not want to be upfront about physical/medical limitations (they often don&#39;t want to worry or burden family).  Try to be respectful of her wishes.<br/>
&gt; I am speaking from a decade of experience in geriatric social work.<br/>
&gt; I imagine your children will benefit greatly from this trip!  Hope they get lots of &#39;stories&#39; and &#39;family history&#39;.<br/>
