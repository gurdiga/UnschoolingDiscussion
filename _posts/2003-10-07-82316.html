<div id="ygrps-yiv-480898039">I am tempted to mention about Las Vegas, so I will &lt;g&gt;  -- before my <br/>
first trip there, at the age of 30-something for a national conference, I <br/>
studied guides to casino games and their relative odds, memorized the blackjack <br/>
combinations and  underlying frequencies, when to fold or double down, and why, <br/>
et cetera. <br/>
<br/>
       Fascinating stuff, a surreal world of <br/>
they-never-taught-me-this-in-school math wrapped in chandeliers, tuxedoes and the kind of magic and illusions <br/>
that both dreams and nightmares are made of. (I also studied how the casinos <br/>
operate psychologically, but that is for another thread!)<br/>
<br/>
       A big eye-opener for me was realizing that gambling games are math <br/>
magic and that math magic and illusions are just like all magic and illusions -- <br/>
from tic-tac-toe to Houdini -- once you &quot;get&quot; the underlying structure and why <br/>
it works, it is less interesting to just see it or do it over and over the <br/>
same way. The fun is in the discovery of new tricks and then sharing them with <br/>
each other! &lt;g&gt;  JJ<br/>

&gt; There are lots of ways to change game rules - sometimes a simple <br/>
&gt; seemingly innocuous change can have major impacts on how the game plays <br/>
&gt; out and what the outcome is.  What if you let people have the option of <br/>
&gt; skipping a turn, for example? Or - what if at the end of a turn they <br/>
&gt; roll a die and call out a number - if they get a match with the number <br/>
&gt; on the die, they get an extra turn.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh - and when you make up games and they flop - be sure to examine why <br/>
&gt; they flop - that is a big huge part of what mathematicians do, too.<br/>
