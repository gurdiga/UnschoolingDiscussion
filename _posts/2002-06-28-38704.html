&lt;&lt; I personally can&#39;t imagine what is so attractive about video games, and <br/>
would never have the patience to do something so repetitive. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something in the challenge and the doing, and many of the more <br/>
repetitive are math puzzles.  My husband likes Minesweeper.   You find bombs <br/>
without setting them off.  You know how many but you don&#39;t know where they <br/>
are until you mathematically determine it.  Holly and Keith are on a quest to <br/>
figure out whether Holly&#39;s analysis of how the program works is right.  <br/>
Holly&#39;s ten.  Keith&#39;s a real professonional math-using engineer.  Holly says <br/>
the first move will never be a bomb.  Keith hadn&#39;t thought of that, and <br/>
they&#39;re playing with that theory.<br/>
<br/>
I called Keith at work, and he said:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Minesweeper involves seeing pattern possibilities based on the exposed <br/>
information.  It&#39;s about permutations.<br/>
When you have one number exposed and everything else around it is not exposed <br/>
there are eight possible connecting blocks, and the number will tell you <br/>
there are two bombs, or four bombs, and you figure out all the permutations.  <br/>
Sometimes it is just guessing.  Sometimes it&#39;s not.  The more information <br/>
you&#39;re working with, the more you can resolve the problem.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s deductive reasoning based on patterns.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When Keith plays, he&#39;s taking a break from physical activity.  He&#39;s zoning <br/>
out, in a way, but while he&#39;s doing a mathematical puzzle (which is relaxing <br/>
for him), he can think about all KINDS of things, and other people will leave <br/>
him alone because he&#39;s &quot;concentrating.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
When Holly plays and discusses her thoughts with Keith, she&#39;s doing math with <br/>
a professional mathematician.  Not many ten year olds get to do that!<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I might be playing Tetris Plus on the Mac in the other room while <br/>
I&#39;m on the phone talking to my sister or a friend.  I like it because it&#39;s <br/>
fast.  I like it because it involves color and patterns and srategies unlike <br/>
what I use in my regular days.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;On the other <br/>
hand, I can see the attraction to some of the role playing games. In the case <br/>
of role playing games though, I can&#39;t see spending so much time and effort in <br/>
a fantasy world, when that same amount of effort expended in real life, might <br/>
lead to real accomplishments in the real world. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is reading a novel &quot;real life&quot;?  <br/>
Is reading poetry real accomplishment? <br/>
Going to plays?<br/>
Reading literature is HUGELY prized by academia.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid read Oliver Twist (which I read three times before I was out of my <br/>
teens) it&#39;s not as much reading and thought as my own boys have expended in <br/>
role playing games already, and they&#39;re 13 and 15.  Reading the cards, the <br/>
guide books, the rule books, the related novels, not just discussing or <br/>
thinking about the behavior of different Japanese clans for L5R but acting <br/>
from that place is more &quot;literary analysis&quot; than most kids get in the best <br/>
high schools.  It&#39;s just different &quot;literature.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What we called plot they call &quot;story line.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not passive, like reading a book, but they can make decisions that <br/>
affect other people&#39;s character.<br/>
<br/>
Those who have played a lot of role playing games will gain the kinds of <br/>
experiences useful in being writers, lawyers, analysts of various kinds, <br/>
historians (what happened and how and why?)...   Why not get those skills in <br/>
a way that seems like &quot;just playing&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As to repetitive actions and productivity...<br/>
<br/>
Crocheting afghans.    WHY do people do that?<br/>
You can buy an afghan at a thrift store for $8.  You can&#39;t even buy the yarn <br/>
to make one for that much.  There are afghans enough in the world.  Why make <br/>
more?<br/>
<br/>
Knitting sweaters.  Why?<br/>
Socks?  Insane, since they&#39;re available for a dollar a pair.<br/>
<br/>
Yet people justify those things on the basis of relaxation, artistic <br/>
expression, labors of love, something to do with their hands while they watch <br/>
movies or listen to music or talk with people.<br/>
<br/>
Why is it virtue for grown women, but &quot;wastefulness&quot; if it&#39;s boys?<br/>
<br/>
I think the prejudice against kids is one of the first things unschoolers <br/>
should dump.  It helps a lot to know that kids LIKE repetition, the like to <br/>
sing songs over and over, to see the same cartoon more than once, to play a <br/>
game again even though they beat it.<br/>

One of my favorite hobbies is cutting perfectly good fabric into little<br/>
pieces and then sewing it back together again in geometric patterns.  It<br/>
sounds pretty silly when I describe it like that.  And I&#39;m not doing it<br/>
to keep anyone warm at night.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916071911">And then there are the really strange people who pay the big bucks for little peices of $2.77/yard fabric that&#39;s been cut into little<br/>
pieces and sewn back together again...WAY more than $2.77/yard for those!<br/>
