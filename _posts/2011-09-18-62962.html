<div id="ygrps-yiv-109861343">Yesterday I was feeling out of sorts, so I thought I might pick up Sandra&#39;s Big <br/>
Book of Unschooling, for some inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
I just opened it up and was reading random pages, and after a couple pages, I <br/>
hit upon the page with &quot;Service&quot; on it. There were some sweet stories about kids <br/>
helping with groceries, and being helpful without being asked or ever coerced.<br/>
<br/>
Right as I was reading it, my daughter, who is 7, came over and offered me a <br/>
foot rub. With lotion. I broke my leg 10 weeks ago and still cant walk on it. <br/>
She has been giving me foot rubs almost daily since then. She does a really <br/>
fabulous job, which I tell her, of course. She also likes to tell all our <br/>
friends how good she is at it and how much I love it. Its very nice, and <br/>
completely voluntary. Maybe she also thought it would be something to lift my <br/>
mood, which it did, and we talked about some things  we want to do when I can <br/>
walk again and we had a nice moment. <br/>
