<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460573570">--I have heard tattoos can be addicting and it seems to be <br/>
playing out with him. She want&#39;s to go with him to get hers.<br/>
I really wish I could change her mind.<br/>
Any tattooed teens out there?<br/>
Or tattooed adults that regret it? Or don&#39;t.<br/>
Help!<br/>
--<br/>
<br/>
I dont know about &quot;addicting&quot;, but I have 3 and hope to have more someday after I am done being pregnant and breastfeeding (which could be a while!)<br/>
<br/>
I am glad I didnt get the illegal tattoo I wanted at age 17. It was the logo of a band that I didnt even like all that much. I wanted it on my upper outside arm. In my state you have to be 18 so they wouldnt do it. But, I am pretty sure that if it was a loving memorial of a lost family member, that I got at a reputable, legal place, that would be a totally different scenario. And if I could share it with my father? What a memory that would be.<br/>
<br/>
I did get a different one at 19, then another at 23 and then my third and largest at 24. Im sure I will get more someday. I like them and I like the way they look.<br/>
<br/>
What she wants seems really important to her (not like, just getting a tatto to have one) and its going to be in a private place (not her neck). Seems like something I could support. Do you support your husbands choice?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My first piece of advice for a new tat is: Get it somewhere *you* can see it<br/>
and enjoy it!!<br/>
I got my first tat (on my L ankle) at 25, I&#39;d always known I&#39;d get a moon<br/>
tattoo (diana=moon goddess) and I&#39;ve never regretted it (of course, that tat<br/>
is how I got my favorite nickname: Nani Moon, from my best friend&#39;s little<br/>
guy - who is now 17 and not so little anymore!)<br/>
At DH&#39;s funeral #2, lots of *strangers* (they knew him, not me) handed me<br/>
cash saying, &quot;In lieu of flowers&quot; Now I don&#39;t know any Lou Flowers :::bg:::<br/>
but he sure did buy me a cool new tattoo :D Mitch and I had planned to get<br/>
matching Gemini/Monkey tats; an idea he quashed when he got sick, so I got<br/>
it on my back as a memorial for him. It&#39;s a beautiful tat, I only wish I<br/>
could SEE it!!<br/>
I got one for Hannah, over my heart, it&#39;s a symbol representing Bodhicitta<br/>
with her initials and dates... then I thought it wise to head off fate and<br/>
get one for Hayden - BEFORE he died :::vbg::: I got a calf tat of a tiger<br/>
(H) having his tail pulled by a monkey (me). The artist put some of Hannah&#39;s<br/>
ashes in the ink :D<br/>
<br/>
Having said all that, implore her to be careful about what she chooses and<br/>
*who* she chooses to do the art!! My cousin got an angel tat on her back for<br/>
her gramma -- it is FUGLY (f&#39;n ugly) and it&#39;s huge and there&#39;s no recourse<br/>
for a tat gone bad :&#39;(<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t buy the whole *addicting* spiel, what people witness (and then label<br/>
addiction) is the freedom from fear that is required to get the first ink,<br/>
then we&#39;re reminded of what it means to be fearless each time we get a new<br/>
one & when we don&#39;t care what people think of the ones we have :D Kinda like<br/>
an empowering spin on The Scarlet Letter :::vbg:::<br/>
<br/>
Memorializing Sam this way will bring her comfort in ways unimaginable to<br/>
anyone else... your support here means the world to her &lt;3<br/>

Me either!  And I just have one tat that I got when I was 22!!  I&#39;ve<br/>
thought about having a toe ring tattooed on, but I think it would hurt<br/>
too much!! [:O] But I can honestly say, I never got &quot;addicted&quot; to them. <br/>
In fact, I know a lot of people with just one tattoo!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also had my nose pierced, I took it out when I had babies cause<br/>
they liked to grab at them...ouch!   All this talk is making me want to<br/>
go back and get another though!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;When I saw Carly drawing the tattoos today, I asked her if she was<br/>
really going to get one and she said &quot;not if you don&#39;t let me.&quot;  I<br/>
said, &quot;it&#39;s your body, I&#39;m not going to say no, I would just prefer you<br/>
wait.&quot;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If your asking for my vote, I&#39;d let her get it, and I&#39;d at least help<br/>
her pay.  It sounds so thought out and it sounds like it&#39;s for such a<br/>
great reason that I can&#39;t imagine she&#39;ll have any regrets!!  She&#39;s<br/>
taking the time to design it herself, this isn&#39;t just some whim with<br/>
friends.  She sounds like she&#39;s put some real thought into it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s just my 2 cents!<br/>
