<div id="ygrps-yiv-427146893">***Yeah. I&#39;m the &quot;magnet&quot; here. Ben laughs and yells, &quot;There are <br/>
twenty-three<br/>
HUNDRED square feet in this house, and all the living things are within<br/>
INCHES of YOU!&quot; &lt;g&gt;****<br/>
<br/>
LOL!  Didn&#39;t you just say *MY* husband yells that??  We got into the dumbest <br/>
fight today because he wants me to look for an efficiency apartment instead <br/>
of a house because the kids are all still &quot;umbilically attached and won&#39;t <br/>
stretch all the way into their new rooms anyway&quot;.  Sheesh.  Husbands! &lt;bg&gt;<br/>
