<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433728350">Hi everybody,<br/>
<br/>
Great news from the Far Eastern front: An EXCELLENT article on home-based <br/>
learning appears today in a major Japanese newspaper!<br/>
<br/>
You can see the Japan Times article on the paper&#39;s website at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?fl20000629a2.htm">http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?fl20000629a2.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
However, the article is just too good to pass up sharing with others, so <br/>
I&#39;ll take the liberty of posting it here. The writer, Carol Hui, does a <br/>
superb job of framing the current conditions of Japan&#39;s homelearning <br/>
environment -- especially regarding the motivations of Japanese <br/>
homelearners vs. foreign-resident ones. This is one of the few stories on <br/>
homelearning that I&#39;ve seen in Japan by the English-language press.<br/>
<br/>
Kudos to Ms. Hui for a job well-done!<br/>
<br/>
This article, while it stands solidly on its own merits, should be viewed <br/>
in the bigger picture of media coverage of homelearning issues in Japan: <br/>
The Japanese press, as I&#39;ve been pointing out, is generally treating the <br/>
idea and practice of homelearning in Japan these days with a high degree <br/>
of seriousness and respect not ususally found in other areas of news <br/>
coverage in this country. This is a very good sign.<br/>
<br/>
The homelearning community in Japan faces many struggles ahead, <br/>
obviously, but articles like this help tremendously in spreading the word <br/>
in a positive way.<br/>
<br/>
Who said media coverage of homelearning couldn&#39;t be done well? Pass *this <br/>
one* around!<br/>

Making home a school away from school <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By CAROL HUI <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A typical day at school for 12-year-old Sophie Kimura could be a social <br/>
studies lesson which involves finding out what life is like in Illinois <br/>
where her &quot;e-pal&quot; Dawn lives.<br/>
<br/>
Or it could be spent expanding her vocabulary skills by reading the <br/>
latest adventure of Harry Potter. It could also be used to write a review <br/>
of a Marc Chagall exhibit for Kidstown.global, a Web site produced by <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
What Sophie ends up doing that day largely depends on herself. &quot;I&#39;m my <br/>
own teacher,&quot; she explains.<br/>
<br/>
For the last two years, Sophie has been a homeschooler after attending a <br/>
public Japanese school until the third grade. Her mother, Katherine <br/>
Combs, felt that kids in the later elementary years do not have enough <br/>
time to spend with their families, due to mandatory participation in <br/>
clubs. After teaching English in Japan for over 14 years, Combs also <br/>
observed that the Japanese school system did not teach students, <br/>
especially girls, self-expression.<br/>
<br/>
Honing Sophie&#39;s communication skills -- from being able to speak with <br/>
adults to writing down her opinions -- was a major educational <br/>
motivation. While these skills take time for students in any educational <br/>
system to develop, the more easily achievable goal of raising Sophie&#39;s <br/>
English reading and writing abilities to native fluency was reached <br/>
surprisingly quickly. Sophie has the answer why: &quot;You get to study what <br/>
you want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is impossible to gauge the number of students being homeschooled in <br/>
Japan because of the various forms that type of schooling takes. Some <br/>
families simply supplement their children&#39;s school education with the <br/>
teaching of subjects such as language or religion, while others instruct <br/>
their children entirely at home.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the educational goals set by each family, the style of <br/>
homeschooling also differs radically. Some use a standardized curriculum <br/>
that corresponds to a particular school system. Materials based on <br/>
development, not age, are there to help parents individualize their <br/>
children&#39;s learning capabilities. Some, like Sophie, are &quot;unschooled&quot; -- <br/>
she does not follow any particular curriculum but learns by going on <br/>
field trips and writing and reading about topics she finds interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling is not a new trend and has always been practiced by foreign <br/>
parents in Japan, particularly those on Christian missions. However, as <br/>
the foreign community grows and diversifies, parents are homeschooling <br/>
for a wider variety of reasons, and it is becoming an appealing <br/>
alternative to the expense and exclusivity of international schools.<br/>
<br/>
Singaporean Aileen Kawagoe laments the price tag of a quality education <br/>
in Japan. &quot;In Singapore, it would only cost a fraction of what <br/>
international schools do here,&quot; she says. To ensure that her son is <br/>
bilingual and has a global perspective on life, she supplements his <br/>
Japanese education with afterschooling at home.<br/>
<br/>
Kawagoe shares her extensive research on homeschooling and other <br/>
educational issues in Japan in an informative newsletter, which covers <br/>
everything from comparisons of preschools using the Montessori and <br/>
Waldorf methods to bullying prevention tactics. The newsletter is <br/>
featured on a Web site Combs set up last October in an attempt to reach <br/>
out to other homeschooling practitioners in Japan. The site also includes <br/>
information on events, resources and suggested educational outings.<br/>
<br/>
The majority of practitioners, both children and parents, seem to enjoy <br/>
the homeschooling experience. Joseph Jones, who homeschools the older <br/>
five of his seven children, is committed to this style of teaching. As a <br/>
missionary for 10 years, he often worked as a private tutor.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This experience showed me the tremendous potential of being able to mold <br/>
children in a life that is free of peer pressure and more supportive of <br/>
their individual interests. I can instill in them a biblical attitude of <br/>
not living for yourself but helping one another and showing concern for <br/>
the disadvantaged by your actions.&quot; His children like not having to wake <br/>
up early in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
For homeschooling parents, the biggest challenge is to provide <br/>
interesting material constantly to stimulate their children. The School <br/>
Support Service of the Christian Academy in Higashi Kurume has been an <br/>
essential resource in providing material and support for parents.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling is also done by Japanese parents, but it is often a <br/>
reactive decision propelled by circumstances such as bullying or school <br/>
refusal. For many foreign parents who school at home, it is a proactive <br/>
choice intended to enhance their children&#39;s education.<br/>
<br/>
A major difference is that many foreign universities recognize <br/>
alternative forms of education and base entrance on aptitude test scores, <br/>
not high school pedigrees. This remains a major advantage for <br/>
homeschooling in English. The stigma of homeschooling in Japanese means <br/>
that it is difficult (though not impossible) to enter Japanese <br/>
universities without the conventional credentials. As pressure increases <br/>
to develop more open policies, this is also changing.<br/>
<br/>
Combs feels Japanese parents should have more confidence in teaching <br/>
their own children, especially if they have concerns about the Japanese <br/>
school system.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I hear many mothers who say that they could not possibly teach,&quot; she <br/>
says. &quot;It&#39;s much easier if you take the attitude of learning along with <br/>
your children. I feel no pressure to provide all the answers in every <br/>
subject myself, but I do present learning as fun. I believe all knowledge <br/>
is connected and one thing will lead to another, so I&#39;m enjoying the <br/>
wonder of discovery along with my children.&quot;<br/>
