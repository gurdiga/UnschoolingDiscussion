BRINGING UP BABIES AROUND THE WORLD IS AN EDUCATION<br/>
<br/>
Child rearing is generally regarded as one of the toughest jobs in the <br/>
world. In Japan, limited child-care support makes the task even more <br/>
difficult. Some mothers, regardless of whether they work, even see it as <br/>
a burden.<br/>
<br/>
Japanese women who have been abroad with their children, however, claim <br/>
their experiences were much more enjoyable. They say this country has <br/>
much to learn about the way to raise better children.<br/>

UNIVERSITIES IN A DESPERATE BATTLE FOR LAND IN THE HEART OF TOKYO<br/>
<br/>
Tough times are looming for private universities and junior colleges in <br/>
Japan as they enter an era which could see many engulfed by bankruptcy.<br/>
<br/>
This past spring, nearly 30 percent of universities and 60 percent of <br/>
junior colleges inducted below-capacity numbers of freshmen, an <br/>
unsurprising fact given the national decline in the population of <br/>
18-year-olds.<br/>

VILLAGE PRAISES PLAN FOR REWARDING KIDS<br/>
<br/>
Kids respond to rewards. If you want them to behave themselves, start <br/>
praising them for being good sports. Or face the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the idea behind Maetsue&#39;s decision to adopt an ordinance to praise <br/>
and reward children　for their good behavior outside of school this month.<br/>

GOVERNMENT PLANS TO REVIEW MORAL EDUCATION CLASSES<br/>
<br/>
The Education Ministry will review its textbook-oriented moral education <br/>
program at primary　and middle schools and examine the possibility of <br/>
employing new teaching methods, such as　field studies, lectures by <br/>
elderly people and those working in their communities, as well as　the <br/>
use of newspaper articles and related literature in classes, The Yomiuri <br/>
Shimbun has　learned.<br/>

SHIRAKAWA CALLS FOR EDUCATION REFORM<br/>
<br/>
Hideki Shirakawa, professor emeritus of Tsukuba University and winner of <br/>
the 2000 Nobel Prize　in Chemistry, on Friday stressed the need to <br/>
establish an education system in Japan that　attaches importance to the <br/>
personality and unique abilities of each student.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking at a press conference at the Foreign Correspondents&#39; Club of <br/>
Japan in Tokyo, he　said: &quot;Is it necessary to turn out students to a <br/>
uniform standard? If those who are　enthusiastic about something special <br/>
can only receive the same level of education -- for the　sake of <br/>
standardization -- they will surely end up disliking science.&quot;<br/>
