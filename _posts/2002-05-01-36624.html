<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191352765">&lt;&lt;If this is what you people think then why couldn&#39;t a TCS parent always<br/>
reason with their kid and never coerce?  As we suggest...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because, just like adults, kids are often agreeable to things and then<br/>
change their minds.  Because, just like adults, sometimes kids have trouble<br/>
controlling their behavior and emotions.  Because, just like adults,<br/>
sometimes they require coercion to do what is most appropriate for the group<br/>
(since none of us live in a vacuum).<br/>
<br/>
True life example from last night:<br/>
<br/>
Zach (8) has a Little League Game.  We eat dinner then load up all the kids<br/>
with snacks and juiceboxes and head out.  We set up lawn chairs on one side<br/>
of the field where there are lots of rocks and dirt that the kids like to<br/>
play in.  On the other side are swings.  Danny (3) and Michelle (2) ask me<br/>
to take them to the swings.  I agree to take them but say that I am not<br/>
willing to push them because I want to watch Zach&#39;s game.  (Zach is doing<br/>
really well this year and quite naturally wants us to watch him).  I can<br/>
stand by the field and watch the game and the swings but if I go to the<br/>
swings I can&#39;t see the game.<br/>
<br/>
The youngsters agreed to swing themselves (laying on their stomachs) and off<br/>
we went.  After a few minutes, Danny comes running up and wants me to push<br/>
him in the swing.  I reminded him that I wanted to watch the game, that I<br/>
had told Zach I would watch the game, that Zach would be sad if he looked up<br/>
and I was gone, that Danny had agreed to swing himself, etc..  Danny began<br/>
to whine.  I suggested he ask Michelle to take turns pushing each other, or<br/>
go ask Adriane (11) or see if Daddy wanted to push.  Danny&#39;s response was<br/>
louder whines, flop onto the grass and screams of &quot;But I want<br/>
Y-o-o-u-u-u!!&quot;.  I told him I would hold him, we could sit together, we<br/>
could play however he wanted as long I could also watch Zach.  Danny howled<br/>
that he wanted me to push him in the swing.  At this point, I got mad and<br/>
said &quot;I am going to watch the game now.  If you want to stay here with me,<br/>
you need to cut it out&quot; and I turned to watch the game.  The yelling<br/>
simmered into glares and eventually stopped. Within 5 minutes, Danny is<br/>
running around catching various bugs which he brings to me to &quot;ooh&quot; and<br/>
&quot;aaah&quot; over.<br/>
<br/>
The dilemma was that I have responsibilities to more people than just Danny.<br/>
I have responsibilities to the older kids to be an attentive parent.  I have<br/>
responsibilities to Michelle to stay near her while she plays so she can be<br/>
safe (I couldn&#39;t leave the swing area).  Danny is 3.  I have the<br/>
responsibility to him to be understanding when he has difficulty seeing that<br/>
I am more than just HIS MOM, but also mom to the other kids as well.</div>
