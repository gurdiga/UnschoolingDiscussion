<div id="ygrps-yiv-535141876">&lt;&lt;        Let us live vicariously through your experiences. Enlighten us, <br/>
share <br/>
with us. How was the conference you attended/presented at? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
After that video discussion I stood and talked with Kathy Ward and another <br/>
couple of people for a while, and that was really pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
At lunchtime I went to the appointed place to meet with some people from the <br/>
Always Learning list for lunch.  Eight altogether, and it was perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Then Richard Prystowsky and I did our joint workshop, which is becoming a <br/>
tradition.  This year we did &quot;Peaceful Parenting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s the exciting part for me:<br/>
<br/>
Frank Smith was there, the author of The Book of Learning and Forgetting (and <br/>
other books, including a new one about math-learning.<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago, Laura Derrick pressed me to read that book and I whimpered <br/>
and she bought a copy and laid it on me and said READ.  She was right.  <br/>
<br/>
So Frank Smith was the second speaker Saturday morning, part of the <br/>
keynote/intro stuff, and he was wonderful.  Spoke without notes, clearly, <br/>
simply, sincerely and directly.  I was mightily impressed.<br/>
<br/>
So the weekend whizzed by, I played recorder with Carol Narigon in the talent <br/>
show, and later did a ballad with a singalong part (words calligraphed by me <br/>
years ago on a long paper banner, held by Pam Sorooshian&#39;s daughter Roxana <br/>
who knew the song, and her assistants), talked with lots of people, laughed, <br/>
played...<br/>
<br/>
Sunday spoke twice, went to lunch (already told that part, but I&#39;m coming to <br/>
a new aspect.<br/>
<br/>
When we were sitting to talk at lunch, Laura Derrick was just beaming.  She <br/>
had something to say.  It was this:  &quot;Frank Smith talked about you in his <br/>
session.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After the initial presentation, there were two Frank Smith question/answer <br/>
sessions, one on Saturday and one on Sunday at 9:15.  <br/>
<br/>
The 9:15 was in the same room where I had spoken earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Someone else in the lunch group (Meghan?  Pam Hartley?) had heard it too and <br/>
said someone asked him what he had thought of my session and he said he had <br/>
really liked it, especially the bit about not defining &quot;science&quot; and <br/>
&quot;history&quot; (or some such, and his sessions weren&#39;t taped so I can&#39;t double <br/>
check).<br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t even seen that he was in my session, which makes me think maybe <br/>
there were more than sixty people, or he was sitting behind someone bigger.<br/>
<br/>
And he mentioned me two other times in that session on his own, after the <br/>
initial question.<br/>
<br/>
So that was pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
When I was speaking with Richard I saw Frank Smith was in the audience!   We <br/>
had a turns-taking schedule and about twenty minutes in when I knew Richard <br/>
had a ten minute segment coming up, I went to refill my water, and get him an <br/>
extra one.  While I was at the water table, Mr./Dr./Prof. whatever he is <br/>
Smith rushed over to the table (not knowing, I guess, I was going to fill up <br/>
two glasses and stall around anyway), and shook my hand VERY warmly and said <br/>
he wanted to tell me how much he enjoyed my unschooling talk, and I thanked <br/>
him and said I was flattered to hear he had mentioned me.  He kinda shrugged <br/>
shyly and politely and we talked about him being in this session, and I went <br/>
on back.  <br/>
<br/>
He left about 2/3 of the way through it, but that&#39;s fine because except for <br/>
an early mention of Maslow&#39;s heirarchy of needs and people needing to feel <br/>
safe and secure in order to learn well, the rest wasn&#39;t about learning but <br/>
about parenting and family life.<br/>
<br/>
My personal favorite type of homeschooling exchange is online bulletin <br/>
boards, because people can get a variety of answers and some discussion on <br/>
those answers without leaving home.  I like writing because it can be used <br/>
twice.<br/>
<br/>
But I know some people really like and need the visual and aural input of a <br/>
live speaker.  And the energy of that many homeschoolers (very many <br/>
unschoolers in the case of the HSC conference) and their VERY fun kids all <br/>
around is another kind of input that can give people months of wondrous <br/>
confidence.<br/>
<br/>
So I think a conference can be a boost to unschooling confidence that&#39;s just <br/>
not available otherwise. <br/>
<br/>
Conferences have an aspect that&#39;s like a party.  It can&#39;t be entirely <br/>
predicted or guaranteed how the electricity of the combination of people will <br/>
flow, but when it&#39;s good it&#39;s GREAT and when it&#39;s slow it&#39;s still an <br/>
opportunity to hear a variety of in-person voices and see dads interacting <br/>
with their kids, and to see the vendors&#39; stuff in person and to see people&#39;s <br/>
eyes when they speak.<br/>
<br/>
As parties go, this year&#39;s HSC conference was a bubbly happy one!!<br/>
