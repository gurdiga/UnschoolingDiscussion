<div id="ygrps-yiv-258162288">Hi :)<br/>
<br/>
My name is Yelena and I&#39;m new to the list and not unschooling yet (two year old kiddo) but <br/>
am weeding my way through the archives and need some directions (think toddler in <br/>
unfamiliar environment type links?).  Stella and I get along famously most of the time <br/>
except when we&#39;re around my and my husband&#39;s family, and some conventional friends <br/>
(those I can avoid though :).  I find that being at their houses for extended periods of time <br/>
gets very stressful for her because there&#39;s a veiled undercurrent of &quot;the kid&#39;s running a <br/>
muck and we (parents) aren&#39;t doing anything about it.  We live on opposite coasts and  <br/>
(typed a &#39;have to&#39; here but deleted it ;)) spend chunks of time at their houses.   Now since <br/>
it&#39;s grandparents we&#39;re talking about, they never just say &#39;no, I&#39;d like her not to do that at <br/>
my house&#39;, they just say yes to whatever she requests and then give looks and sighs so I <br/>
know that it&#39;s not a good idea.  It&#39;s as though they yes her just to see how demanding she <br/>
can get and then expect me to step in and tell her to cool it.  My parents have mentioned <br/>
that they think she&#39;s spoiled, whiny, etc.  She&#39;s super funny, smart, can negotiate her <br/>
needs and mine, sometimes while screaming, sometimes while whining.  Sometimes she <br/>
just wants things her way just time to leave a store/eat (for me)/drive for a commitment <br/>
and then we get in trouble.  I start finding myself telling her &#39;no this is not ok here, try <br/>
something else&quot;, and come up with ideas on how to involve her in something else.  <br/>
<br/>
My problem is that I end up playing catch up -- she senses that I&#39;m trying to get her to <br/>
change direction and starts NOing ideas while I desperately try to come up with ways to <br/>
make her happy.  Even in moments that we&#39;re not in the family members&#39; presence we&#39;re <br/>
having disagreements about most mundane things, just because the precedent for <br/>
adversarial interaction has been set.  Any suggestions are appreciated here -- how do you <br/>
navigate the &#39;outside&#39; world?!  I&#39;m not trying to train her, I&#39;m not trying make her behave a <br/>
certain way.  I really am just looking for a way we can stay on (or close to) the happy <br/>
wavelength that we&#39;re on around unschoolers, all the while being around family.   <br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I read the thread about gravel and mulch and how throwing it is not ok cuz it <br/>
belongs to someone else -- so to me this is sort of a similar situation (other people&#39;s <br/>
homes, belongings, food, etc.)  I just don&#39;t know how to approach this and what the <br/>
principal behind it is -- she&#39;s obviously not hurting anyone or herself, but I AM missing <br/>
something here and I can&#39;t put my finger on it...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Yelena</div>

<br/>
I don&#39;t understand what &quot;negotiate her needs and mine&quot; means and  <br/>
whether you think screaming and whining is a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
If I say &quot;screaming and whining mean she&#39;s unhappy,&quot; then I worry  <br/>
that people reading might think I mean &quot;do anything to stop the  <br/>
screaming and whining,&quot; but what I mean is figure out at home, in  <br/>
peaceful moments, why the communications aren&#39;t going better, and  <br/>
improve that.  Practice at home figuring out how to communicate  <br/>
before the whining and screaming start--how to know they  might be  <br/>
coming and avoid them, or to help the child (even a young child)  <br/>
express herself differently.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t always work, but if it *sometimes* works you&#39;re closer to  <br/>
peace and social acceptability than if you don&#39;t even attempt it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sometimes she just wants things her way just time to leave a store/ <br/>
eat (for me)/drive for a commitment and then we get in trouble. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Did you leave a word out?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I start finding myself telling her &#39;no this is not ok here, try  <br/>
something else&quot;, and come up with ideas on how to involve her in  <br/>
something else. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Why is that &quot;in trouble&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Any suggestions are appreciated here -- how do you navigate the  <br/>
&#39;outside&#39; world?! I&#39;m not trying to train her, I&#39;m not trying make  <br/>
her behave a certain way.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Be living in the outside world.  Don&#39;t have one way of being for home  <br/>
and another whole set of problems &quot;outside.&quot;   You don&#39;t have to  <br/>
trying to make her behave in a certain way to be helping her  <br/>
understand what ways are more acceptable to other people.  I know  <br/>
there are some unschoolers seeming to say say that children should  <br/>
express themselves in whatever ways they want to while mother stand  <br/>
by like serene cattle, but I think they&#39;re as wrong as can be.  Being  <br/>
a child&#39;s partner means helping them know what to do and how to be.<br/>
<br/>
-=-she&#39;s obviously not hurting anyone or herself, but I AM missing  <br/>
something here and I can&#39;t put my finger on it...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Wy do you think it&#39;s not hurting anyone else for her to scream and  <br/>
whine?<br/>
<br/>
Why do you think it&#39;s not hurting her for other people to decide they  <br/>
don&#39;t want to be around screaming and whining?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe sometimes when people hear that a child shouldn&#39;t be punished  <br/>
for screaming and whining, they jump to the opposite of that, and  <br/>
think that children should be rewarded for screaming and whining (or  <br/>
at least not discouraged from screaming and whining).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My best suggestion is to continue getting along when you in other<br/>
places.  The dynamics change in certain places, where the focus is on<br/>
adult interaction, but you don&#39;t have to let that happen.  You can keep<br/>
the focus on your interaction with you child and poriferally interact<br/>
with the other adults.  It  could be as simple as sitting on the floor<br/>
with toys in front of you, rather than on the couch.<br/>
<br/>
Take breaks from even being in the same room as all the adults, go for<br/>
quick walk abouts outside or to the kitchen to get drinks or snacks, or<br/>
to the bathroom and check out soap and lotion.  Your parenting goal is<br/>
to NOT have a seen and not heard child, so don&#39;t fall into that scenario<br/>
that creates that.  You can&#39;t have it both ways, you can&#39;t expect to<br/>
have a seen and not heard child and an active and ever present<br/>
interactiveness with your child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My parents have mentioned<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; needs and mine, sometimes while screaming, sometimes while whining.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t get to a point where there is screaming and whining.  I do<br/>
understand that little ones get tired and overstimulated, especially in<br/>
large family gatherings, so expect to be on gaurd the WHOLE time,<br/>
creating breaks and down time in quiet rooms.  If you are removing your<br/>
child from the room, other people won&#39;t see or hear her being whiney and<br/>
screaming.  If you are in an enclosed quiet room, they won&#39;t know how<br/>
you are treating your child and there won&#39;t be any issues for them to<br/>
pick apart.  What they&#39;ll see and know is that you are handling the<br/>
situation and that there isn&#39;t screaming and whining.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-365954980">Disclosure:  Russian is my first language so some Russian grammar and syntax still creep <br/>
into my writing on a regular basis.  Think of the phrase:  &quot;you think I should what?!&quot; and <br/>
you&#39;ll understand the run on sentences and overuse of pronouns.  Hopefully I&#39;m being <br/>
clearer this time...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Rephrase: -=-... tries to keep negotiating, sometimes while screaming, sometimes while <br/>
whining.-=-<br/>
<br/>
What I should have said was:  She still makes rational and logical arguments while <br/>
screaming and whining.  She is attempting to explain her position while losing her cool at <br/>
the same time -- and I usually take her in the other room when she&#39;s obviously trying to <br/>
tell me something and it&#39;s not coming out quite as composed as others are used to.   I do <br/>
see this as a good thing because she&#39;s *really* trying to get her point across.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I say &quot;screaming and whining mean she&#39;s unhappy,&quot; then I worry  <br/>
 that people reading might think I mean &quot;do anything to stop the  <br/>
 screaming and whining,&quot; but what I mean is figure out at home, in  <br/>
 peaceful moments, why the communications aren&#39;t going better, and  <br/>
 improve that. &gt;&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I do a lot &#39;do anything to stop the screaming and whining&#39;, and am trying to break away <br/>
from that pattern.  I also know why communications aren&#39;t going better in the case of <br/>
being around our family, I just haven&#39;t been able to come up with alternatives that <br/>
*always* -- she can&#39;t sleep around unfamiliar surroundings unless she&#39;s exhausted, she <br/>
gets overtired and the only way to calm her down is to leave the place we&#39;re at or go to a <br/>
private room and play there.  She can&#39;t fall asleep even in the car most of the time unless <br/>
she&#39;s dead tired (evening time usually).  Same goes for food -- I bring her the things she <br/>
usually likes to eat at home, but the M&M&#39;s and cookies and ice cream at grandma&#39;s call <br/>
her name much louder than any protein or veggies or fruit or chocolate from home.  Then <br/>
she&#39;s overtired and hyper.   Can I tell her &#39;not right now&#39; on the sweets without stifling her?  <br/>
My husband has the same issue at MIL&#39;s house and I remind them both that they&#39;ll feel like <br/>
crap afterwards but that doesn&#39;t stop either one of binging on the stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing is that she gets &#39;stuck&#39; on a certain interaction.  My grandma speaks only <br/>
Russian and Stella doesn&#39;t understand a word of what she says most of the time.  My <br/>
grandma also asks a lot of questions.  Questions + Stella usually = &#39;NO&#39; so she&#39;s made <br/>
some association with my grandma and the word &#39;NO&#39; even if a question is a harmless one <br/>
or there is no question at all.  Whenever my grandma comes near her or tries to touch her <br/>
Stella yells &quot;NO&quot;.   I&#39;ve asked my grandma politely to respect Stella&#39;s requests for space but <br/>
she has a short term memory issue and forgets.  My dad gets mad at the kiddo for telling <br/>
my grandma no.  Stella&#39;s trying to protect her space, my dad&#39;s trying to protect my <br/>
grandma&#39;s feelings and to me both are valid.  Stella asks for me to take her to a quiet spot <br/>
to nurse which I do...<br/>
<br/>
I could spend a visit in a room by myself with her (short bursts only help for a little while <br/>
and they work so we don&#39;t spend the *whole* day with them), but if we visit family that&#39;s <br/>
not an acceptable solution is it?  Or is it?  I&#39;m really confused now...  (I am still with said <br/>
family as we speak and a bit emotional about all this).    <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Practice at home figuring out how to communicate  <br/>
 before the whining and screaming start--how to know they  might be  <br/>
 coming and avoid them, or to help the child (even a young child)  <br/>
 express herself differently.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Will do...  Like I said at home things are easier and I can focus on prevention techniques, <br/>
maybe a play about grandma&#39;s house or something... (any other practical creative <br/>
suggestions?) We&#39;re obsessed with puppets over here :)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why do you think it&#39;s not hurting anyone else for her to scream and whine?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Why do you think it&#39;s not hurting her for other people to decide they  <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to be around screaming and whining?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I meant the things she does to warrant being called spoiled are things that aren&#39;t hurting <br/>
anyone or her.  I think I cut and pasted the post a couple of times and that sentence ended <br/>
up in the wrong part of the paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
What if they are not comfortable with her for walking up and down the stairs by herself <br/>
and she does it all the time at home?  They get nervous and tell her not to or tell her to be <br/>
careful in an alarming voice, I tell them she does it all the time and they think I&#39;m letting <br/>
her walk all over me?   What if they are not comfortable with her eating desert before she&#39;s <br/>
had her dinner and I think it&#39;s fine and they think she&#39;s walking all over me?  What if they <br/>
tell her *she* should pick up a mess but I think it&#39;s fine to do it for her and they think <br/>
she&#39;s walking all over me?  That&#39;s the situation where I &#39;get in trouble&#39; as in I don&#39;t know <br/>
what to do -- I start telling her no it&#39;s not ok to eat desert here first, no it makes grandma <br/>
nervous that she&#39;s walking up the stairs by herself, grandpa &#39;needs&#39; her to pick up the <br/>
mess herself.  (These are just examples, but very typical of the things I&#39;m talking about)  <br/>
Stella knows what she&#39;s capable of, she knows she has a sweet tooth and desert is more <br/>
appealing at the moment, and she is feeling hurt that her freedom is being taken away.  <br/>
That&#39;s when she gets whiny and angry most -- the after effects of feeling this way last for <br/>
a while too, like I said she gets stuck in a dynamic for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Do I just work on not feeling uncomfortable with their judging me for &#39;letting her get away <br/>
with stuff&#39; or do I try and get her to eat desert after dinner and hold her hand up the <br/>
stairs, and talk her into cleaning up?  Is there a middle ground?  I still think in extremes <br/>
sometimes (any links you can think of on the websites?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again :)<br/>

I don&#39;t mind, because if we&#39;re looking for the principles in what&#39;s  <br/>

<br/>
-=-Can I tell her &#39;not right now&#39; on the sweets without stifling her?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I brought this up above the rest of the paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
I think the answer is &quot;no.&quot;  You could ask the grandma not to put  <br/>
that all out, but I wouldn&#39;t. Let it be fun and exciting.  Try to go  <br/>
with the flow.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Same goes for food -- I bring her the things she usually likes to  <br/>
eat at home, but the M&M&#39;s and cookies and ice cream at grandma&#39;s  <br/>

chocolate from home. Then she&#39;s overtired and hyper. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Try not to blame sugar for &quot;hyper.&quot;  It&#39;s a bad, cheap trick.  Anyone  <br/>
can be on edge in a different place.  And what&#39;s &quot;overtired&quot; got to  <br/>
do with food?  If she doesn&#39;t like to sleep in other places, that  <br/>
would make her tired.  If she&#39;s seeing things she&#39;s not used to, her  <br/>
mind is running fast.  That would make her tired.  My kids were  <br/>
always WAY  more exhausted from mental exercise than physical.   <br/>
Running and playing might not get them exhausted, but a day of  <br/>
learning and seeing and meeting and thinking would zonk them out for  <br/>
HOURS.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My husband has the same issue at MIL&#39;s house and I remind them  <br/>
both that they&#39;ll feel like crap afterwards but that doesn&#39;t stop  <br/>
either one of binging on the stuff. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe telling them they&#39;ll feel like crap feels worse than the  <br/>
aftereffects of eating M&Ms.  And honestly, why would they binge?  If  <br/>
you had those things available at home, they wouldn&#39;t be a big draw  <br/>
at the grandma&#39;s house.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My dad gets mad at the kiddo for telling my grandma no. Stella&#39;s  <br/>
trying to protect her space, my dad&#39;s trying to protect my grandma&#39;s  <br/>
feelings and to me both are valid. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You and Stella can protect her space without your accepting her  <br/>
yelling no at old women.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I could spend a visit in a room by myself with her (short bursts  <br/>
only help for a little while<br/>
<br/>

now... (I am still with said<br/>
family as we speak and a bit emotional about all this). -=-<br/>
<br/>
Not all day, no.  But breaks once in a while to lie down and nurse?   <br/>
Sure.  A walk around the block?  Maybe EVERYone could get out of the  <br/>
house a couple of times a day to a place where your daughter could  <br/>
run around.  A food place with a playground.  A park.  Then she could  <br/>
run and be cute in neutral territory.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What if they are not comfortable with her for walking up and down  <br/>
the stairs by herself and she does it all the time at home? They get  <br/>
nervous and tell her not to or tell her to be careful in an alarming  <br/>
voice, I tell them she does it all the time -=-<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t &quot;do it all the time.&quot;  Those aren&#39;t your stairs.  At my  <br/>
house, I get to say who goes up and down my stairs.  If you want her  <br/>
on the stairs, be right there holding her hand, if they&#39;re nervous,  <br/>
because it&#39;s their house and their stairs.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What if they are not comfortable with her eating desert before  <br/>
she&#39;s had her dinner and I think it&#39;s fine and they think she&#39;s  <br/>
walking all over me?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then you&#39;re walking all over them.  You can&#39;t go to someone else&#39;s  <br/>
house and call all the shots. You can go and negotiate, or explain  <br/>
what you&#39;re doing and why, or you could give her a snack.<br/>
<br/>
And if she&#39;s been eating M&Ms and ice cream all day, why are you  <br/>
defending dessert before dinner anyway?<br/>
<br/>
-=-What if they tell her *she* should pick up a mess but I think it&#39;s  <br/>
fine to do it for her and they think she&#39;s walking all over me?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s really that bad, don&#39;t visit, or don&#39;t visit in their home.  <br/>
Public places.  You could help her clean the mess up.  You can&#39;t  <br/>
change them altogether.  You could explain your thoughts when there&#39;s  <br/>
not even a mess down, but you can&#39;t commandeer their whole  house.<br/>
<br/>
-=-and she is feeling hurt that her freedom is being taken away.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s when she gets whiny and angry most -- the after effects of  <br/>
feeling this way last for<br/>
a while too, like I said she gets stuck in a dynamic for a while.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why does she even SEE &quot;dessert&quot;?   Do you &quot;do dessert&quot; at your  <br/>
house?  Why?  We just don&#39;t.  There are meals. And at the end of the  <br/>
meal, that&#39;s the end of the meal.  And somewhere in the house  <br/>
there&#39;s  undoubtedly cake or ice cream or something, but that&#39;s a  <br/>
whole separate thing from meals.  At the end of meals, kids aren&#39;t  <br/>
expecting to get sweets, nor looking forward to sweets.  That&#39;s a  <br/>
conditioning thing, and a tradition of reward.  I&#39;d just avoid it  <br/>
(but then I never started with it).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-172166241">Thanks for clarifying all that, makes a lot of sense actually.  Off to *not* walk all over my <br/>
in laws and parents and elderly grandma :)  Leaving tomorrow and what a relief!  I&#39;ll buy <br/>
Stella some M&M&#39;s and myself an organic version and we&#39;ll binge together!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Then you&#39;re walking all over them.  You can&#39;t go to someone else&#39;s  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; house and call all the shots. You can go and negotiate, or explain  <br/>
&gt; what you&#39;re doing and why, or you could give her a snack.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See?  I wouldn&#39;t have though of it that way, but that&#39;s exactly how they see it I bet.  I <br/>
thought my kid, my call... I&#39;ll stick to going with the flow -- I&#39;ve got my hands full with my <br/>
deschooling, the kiddo, and keeping track of sanity.  Explaining parenting my methods to <br/>
Russian grandparents (think &#39;cry it out&#39; in a 4 week old) is going to have to come at a later <br/>
date :)  They are actually a bit more enlightened than that now (Nikitin family lived off the <br/>
grid and my mom read about them when I was little) but the  mentality is still there.<br/>
<br/>
And while driving around today it dawned on me that while I thought I let go of all my <br/>
food issues -- obviously I&#39;m not buying M&M&#39;s and cookies and if I did she wouldn&#39;t binge <br/>
on them at grandma&#39;s!  Doi! (Stella&#39;s word)  Reading your response was no surprise then :)  <br/>
I thought -- she can have whatever she wants wherever she sees it, she hasn&#39;t asked me <br/>
to buy them -- but now I realize that she associates grandma&#39;s house with chinese food <br/>
(aka M&M&#39;s) and gets all bingy.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And if she&#39;s been eating M&Ms and ice cream all day, why are you<br/>
defending dessert before dinner anyway?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Different houses -- my parents no candy, no stairs, yelling at grandma...  Inlaws -- when <br/>
it&#39;s dinner time they say &#39;you can have desert after dinner&#39;,  before that it&#39;s a free for all!  <br/>
Once dinner starts cooking it&#39;s off limits till dinner is done.  It&#39;s the craziest thing I&#39;ve ever <br/>
seen!  I know, my issues, but I&#39;m not surprised Stella&#39;s confused.    She knows about desert <br/>
from going out to dinner with us and grandma asking her all excited like if she&#39;d like some <br/>
-- she really thinks it&#39;s something special (grandma and by extension Stella).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I know why I&#39;m stressed now -- all the doing what feels yicky at other people&#39;s <br/>
houses, going against the flow.  If it feels yicky, don&#39;t do it... and have some stuff to mull <br/>
over for next time (Feb).  <br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m at it though... A respect others&#39; house question -- I bring my own food to my in <br/>
laws&#39; house because otherwise I&#39;d eat pizza pockets and miracle whip sandwiches -- is <br/>
that disrespectful? LOL :S  Seriously -- I know my mil feels weird about it, she <br/>
understands that I grew up eating differently but still...  We spend like 4 hours at a time <br/>
there and I get GRUMPY if I don&#39;t eat.  and my milk supply kinda dwindles... <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, not crying anymore :)  Mental fog has lifted for now.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t mind, because if we&#39;re looking for the principles in what&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; going on, it will help others who are reading too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-Can I tell her &#39;not right now&#39; on the sweets without stifling her?-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I brought this up above the rest of the paragraph.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the answer is &quot;no.&quot;  You could ask the grandma not to put  <br/>
&gt; that all out, but I wouldn&#39;t. Let it be fun and exciting.  Try to go  <br/>
&gt; with the flow.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-Same goes for food -- I bring her the things she usually likes to  <br/>
&gt; eat at home, but the M&M&#39;s and cookies and ice cream at grandma&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; call her name much louder than any protein or veggies or fruit or  <br/>
&gt; chocolate from home. Then she&#39;s overtired and hyper. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Try not to blame sugar for &quot;hyper.&quot;  It&#39;s a bad, cheap trick.  Anyone  <br/>
&gt; can be on edge in a different place.  And what&#39;s &quot;overtired&quot; got to  <br/>
&gt; do with food?  If she doesn&#39;t like to sleep in other places, that  <br/>
&gt; would make her tired.  If she&#39;s seeing things she&#39;s not used to, her  <br/>
&gt; mind is running fast.  That would make her tired.  My kids were  <br/>
&gt; always WAY  more exhausted from mental exercise than physical.   <br/>
&gt; Running and playing might not get them exhausted, but a day of  <br/>
&gt; learning and seeing and meeting and thinking would zonk them out for  <br/>
&gt; HOURS.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-My husband has the same issue at MIL&#39;s house and I remind them  <br/>
&gt; both that they&#39;ll feel like crap afterwards but that doesn&#39;t stop  <br/>
&gt; either one of binging on the stuff. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe telling them they&#39;ll feel like crap feels worse than the  <br/>
&gt; aftereffects of eating M&Ms.  And honestly, why would they binge?  If  <br/>
&gt; you had those things available at home, they wouldn&#39;t be a big draw  <br/>
&gt; at the grandma&#39;s house.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-My dad gets mad at the kiddo for telling my grandma no. Stella&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; trying to protect her space, my dad&#39;s trying to protect my grandma&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; feelings and to me both are valid. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You and Stella can protect her space without your accepting her  <br/>
&gt; yelling no at old women.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-I could spend a visit in a room by myself with her (short bursts  <br/>
&gt; only help for a little while<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and they work so we don&#39;t spend the *whole* day with them), but if we  <br/>
&gt; visit family that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not an acceptable solution is it? Or is it? I&#39;m really confused  <br/>
&gt; now... (I am still with said<br/>
&gt; family as we speak and a bit emotional about all this). -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not all day, no.  But breaks once in a while to lie down and nurse?   <br/>
&gt; Sure.  A walk around the block?  Maybe EVERYone could get out of the  <br/>
&gt; house a couple of times a day to a place where your daughter could  <br/>
&gt; run around.  A food place with a playground.  A park.  Then she could  <br/>
&gt; run and be cute in neutral territory.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-What if they are not comfortable with her for walking up and down  <br/>
&gt; the stairs by herself and she does it all the time at home? They get  <br/>
&gt; nervous and tell her not to or tell her to be careful in an alarming  <br/>
&gt; voice, I tell them she does it all the time -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She doesn&#39;t &quot;do it all the time.&quot;  Those aren&#39;t your stairs.  At my  <br/>
&gt; house, I get to say who goes up and down my stairs.  If you want her  <br/>
&gt; on the stairs, be right there holding her hand, if they&#39;re nervous,  <br/>
&gt; because it&#39;s their house and their stairs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-What if they are not comfortable with her eating desert before  <br/>
&gt; she&#39;s had her dinner and I think it&#39;s fine and they think she&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; walking all over me?-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And if she&#39;s been eating M&Ms and ice cream all day, why are you  <br/>
&gt; defending dessert before dinner anyway?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-What if they tell her *she* should pick up a mess but I think it&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; fine to do it for her and they think she&#39;s walking all over me?-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If it&#39;s really that bad, don&#39;t visit, or don&#39;t visit in their home.  <br/>
&gt; Public places.  You could help her clean the mess up.  You can&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; change them altogether.  You could explain your thoughts when there&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; not even a mess down, but you can&#39;t commandeer their whole  house.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-and she is feeling hurt that her freedom is being taken away.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s when she gets whiny and angry most -- the after effects of  <br/>
&gt; feeling this way last for<br/>
&gt; a while too, like I said she gets stuck in a dynamic for a while.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why does she even SEE &quot;dessert&quot;?   Do you &quot;do dessert&quot; at your  <br/>
&gt; house?  Why?  We just don&#39;t.  There are meals. And at the end of the  <br/>
&gt; meal, that&#39;s the end of the meal.  And somewhere in the house  <br/>
&gt; there&#39;s  undoubtedly cake or ice cream or something, but that&#39;s a  <br/>
&gt; whole separate thing from meals.  At the end of meals, kids aren&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; expecting to get sweets, nor looking forward to sweets.  That&#39;s a  <br/>
&gt; conditioning thing, and a tradition of reward.  I&#39;d just avoid it  <br/>
&gt; (but then I never started with it).<br/>

<br/>
And only cuz I&#39;ve never seen it first hand so it&#39;s VERY difficult to model, support etc...  My <br/>
husband and I have agreed that compromise is just when nobody gets what they want -- <br/>
it&#39;s a running joke at our house cuz neither one of us has the actual concept down.  <br/>
Sometimes I feel like I need a script but my drafts aren&#39;t cutting it.  I say &quot;Sammy doesn&#39;t <br/>
like it when you hurt her feelings&quot;  Stella says &quot;but she does like it&quot; (she is half kidding but <br/>
half not).  I say &quot;Don&#39;t hit the baby (not mine, I&#39;d go nuts with two :)) and she says &quot;but I <br/>
have to hit the baby&quot;.  So I just make sure she doesn&#39;t get close enough to hit the baby <br/>
and that&#39;s about where it stalls out...<br/>
<br/>
Also she&#39;s very little and we&#39;re very sarcastic and have a weird sense of humor at our <br/>
house.  We kid around a lot and that doesn&#39;t translate into the outside world at all.  I know <br/>
she&#39;s confused when something we laugh about at home is taken in a different way when <br/>
we&#39;re out.<br/>

<br/>
Yelena liked what Joanna wrote too, but this is tie-in trivia.  It&#39;s  <br/>
Jiminy Cricket.  He&#39;s not a two-faced Greek-based cricket, he&#39;s J.C.  <br/>
Before the Disney Pinocchio movie ever came out, &quot;Jiminy Cricket&quot; was  <br/>
a euphemism for &quot;Jesus Christ.&quot;  It was NOT okay for kids to say  <br/>
&quot;Jesus CHRIST!&quot; but it was okay to say &quot;Jiminy Cricket.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the story, Jiminy Cricket is conscience and integrity.    Gemini  <br/>
and Janus and other dualism symbols are in a whole &#39;nother realm.<br/>

Would you like for someone to say to you &quot;Sammy doesn&#39;t like it when  <br/>
you hurt her feelings&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter is verbal and analytical enough to know what that  <br/>
means, then she already knows about hurt feelings.  You could say  <br/>
&quot;That wasn&#39;t nice.&quot;  You could say &quot;There were other things you could  <br/>
have done.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What she does reflects on you.  I think when she&#39;s old enough to  <br/>
understand that, you could tell her so.  What she does reflects on  <br/>
her dad.  If you&#39;re going to be part of her team, she should know  <br/>
there&#39;s a team, not that she  has a team of minders who make sure she  <br/>
has the freedom to do whatever she damned well pleased no matter  <br/>
where she is.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s the bad message that&#39;s getting out elsewhere in the  <br/>
unschooling world.  Maybe some people are interpretting &quot;be your  <br/>

together!&quot;<br/>

The alarms went off at that one.<br/>
<br/>
Sarcasm is funny sometimes.  Some people get stuck there, and then  <br/>
they&#39;re not fun to be around.  It&#39;s cynicism and negativity turned to  <br/>
humor, but it&#39;s still cynical and negative. Sarcasm isn&#39;t kindness.   <br/>
It&#39;s not peace.  It&#39;s not respect.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Sarcasm is always humor at someone&#39;s expense.  It&#39;s always mean.   I  <br/>
used to have friends whose relationships with me were almost all  <br/>
banter--we insulted each other often and well, but it gets old, and  <br/>
it becomes nearly impossible to talk about anything of consequence.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind the idea of teasing and &quot;smack talk&quot; when the person  <br/>
knows when to stop.  It&#39;s like playing very roughly (slugging,  <br/>
wrestling, bopping the backs of heads, poking, slapping), and  <br/>
sometimes people can enjoy that in small doses too.  But it needs to  <br/>
be mutual and it can go from fun to NOT fun in half a second.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If your daughter is verbal and analytical enough to know what that <br/>
means, then she already knows about hurt feelings. You could say <br/>
&quot;That wasn&#39;t nice.&quot; You could say &quot;There were other things you could <br/>
have done.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have been meaning to respond to this thread, and also the thread on<br/>
logical thinking and when that develops - and i have a question.  my<br/>
understanding is that recent research has revealed that the frontal<br/>
lobe, which is responsible for &quot;executive function&quot;, impulse control,<br/>
predictive skills, etc., does not reach maturity until sometime<br/>
between the ages of 14 and 31 YEARS of age.  a young child, under this<br/>
model, possesses only a fraction of future capacity in these areas. <br/>
<br/>
 if this is true, then it seems to me that even saying &quot;that wasn&#39;t<br/>
nice&quot; is futile at best, and harmful at worst - futile because as much<br/>
as the child may learn and know that, they are neurologically<br/>
incapable, much of the time, of holding that in the &quot;forefront&quot; of<br/>
their mind and using it to make a decision - and harmful at worst<br/>
because if they really &quot;did have to hit him&quot; that might be their way<br/>
of saying that they had NO impulse control....and &quot;that wasn&#39;t nice&quot;<br/>
suddenly becomes, from the child&#39;s perspective &quot;you aren&#39;t nice&quot; -<br/>
does that make any sense to anyone else?  it seems shaming and harsh<br/>
in light of assuming that they truly couldn&#39;t help it.  so - if this<br/>
way of viewing a child&#39;s brain is correct, i would think that we, as<br/>
parents, need to be their &quot;surrogate frontal lobe&quot; - just as ross<br/>
greene talks about in &quot;the explosive child&quot; - except for kids who<br/>
aren&#39;t &quot;explosive&quot; but just developmentally unready for consistently<br/>
utilizing frontal lobe functions. <br/>
<br/>
i would think we need to *prevent*, redirect, and avoid areas of<br/>
conflict and impulse that would be destructive, and if WE fail to<br/>
predict our child&#39;s actions (our frontal lobe at work!) then shaming<br/>
the child is useless and just that - shaming.  i have actually seen<br/>
wonderful responses from the adult APOLOGZING to the child for not<br/>
getting there in time - to prevent the hit, to use OUR frontal lobe<br/>
capacity while the child&#39;s was undeveloped....because it doesn&#39;t feel<br/>
GOOD to a child to &quot;lose control.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and if we are unable to do so -get there in time - or if we misguess<br/>
our child&#39;s reactions, it seems incumbent upon us to take<br/>
responsibility for that...<br/>
<br/>
would others interpret this research/line of thinking differently? <br/>

I don&#39;t doubt the 31 years thing.  I have had adult students for  <br/>
years, learning in one-on-one and small-group ways how to be virtuous  <br/>

age of 30.  I announced about ten years ago that I would never take  <br/>
another student under the age of 30, and one 25 year old made some  <br/>
noise about it, and when she was 30 came back and apologized.<br/>
<br/>
I never said I wouldn&#39;t bother to discuss better and worse choices  <br/>
with my children before they were 30.  There are teens in prison as  <br/>
adults.  My kids are so far not even nearly among them, and there are  <br/>

<br/>
Good point.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t think of it as &quot;compromise&quot; here, but as consideration and  <br/>
generosity.  When the priorities are known (at our house, happiness  <br/>
and learning) then when there&#39;s a conflict, the thing that leads more  <br/>
toward learning or fulfilling obligations (kids being at work on  <br/>
time, getting purchases to the post office) or things that lead to  <br/>
more peace will get the first car keys and money.  Other things can  <br/>
wait.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids were babies, we tried to  make them comfortable.  In no  <br/>
time at all, we started seeing them trying to make other people  <br/>
comfortable, too.<br/>

well - yes, if you believe they really had a choice. if one believes that they didn&#39;t have the impulse control, (which you say above you don&#39;t - but let&#39;s say at SOME age they don&#39;t - let&#39;s a say a kid who doesn&#39;t say &quot;i had to&quot; but jus dose it and then runs off) then perhaps a vote of confidence that they WILL eventually be able to control themselves is life serving, along the same lines, and doesn&#39;t suggest taht they had a choice but made the &quot;wrong&quot; one, even if they didn&#39;t have a real choice? <br/>

but if a child is *developmentally* incapable of impulse control, due to the limitations of their brain and its development - they *won&#39;t* have tools whether mother is dead or alive. that&#39;s like saying, in my opinion, that we shouldn&#39;t co-sleep with a child because what if mom died - how woudl they ever get to bed by themselves? i have heard many people say that actually... <br/>

Yes.  But they&#39;re BEFORE the next time.  Waiting until it happens  <br/>
each time and then deciding not to discuss it because the child is  <br/>
too young isn&#39;t as good as discussing how to begin to decide how to  <br/>

Yes.  Let&#39;s not treat all children like a point on a curve, assuming  <br/>
that they don&#39;t understand us so we might as well not try to  <br/>
communicate.<br/>
<br/>
Some children will NEVER understand language, and that&#39;s very  <br/>
unfortunate.   Some might understand it and never have the physical  <br/>
or mental ability to use it in return.<br/>
We&#39;ve been talking about a young child who is very verbal.  How did  <br/>
she get verbal?  Probably her parents  were talking to her even  <br/>
before she could understand the words.  We don&#39;t wait until children  <br/>
are old enough to speak to talk to them.  We don&#39;t need to wait until  <br/>
they&#39;re old enough to be analytical about emotions to talk about  <br/>
emotions to them.  We don&#39;t need to wait until they have reached  <br/>
anyone&#39;s definition of the age of accountability to talk to them  <br/>
about accountability (not in those terms, but in simple terms).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right--for me this is an important point.  This stuff on brain development, while valuable <br/>
for its information about the generalities of development, can mistakenly (IMHO) imply <br/>
that there is some magic point where the ability is there and then that&#39;s when a person is <br/>
accountable.  That just doesn&#39;t match my own experience of how people learn and <br/>
develop.  <br/>
<br/>
A child doesn&#39;t wait to walk until they can--they go through all the steps, spending a long <br/>
time on some steps, flying through others, skipping others entirely, until the day that they <br/>
take their first step.  Growth is happening, learning is happening.  Brain, body, emotions, <br/>
abilities are all changing and expanding every day, and connected parents are responding <br/>
to what is going on right now--not in a hypothetical world.<br/>
<br/>
Just because an area of the brain isn&#39;t the primary area being used doesn&#39;t mean it is dead <br/>
until the switch goes on.  I&#39;m imagining that connections would be forming, systems <br/>
would be in a state of flux as input comes in, and that there would be processes whereby <br/>
a person would be testing which response gets which reaction, and those responses are <br/>
coming from different places--for example, if I hit, which feels easy, natural and <br/>
instinctive I get this reaction.  If I walk away, then this happens.  If I say, &quot;No,&quot; then <br/>
something else happens.  If I ask, &quot;Please,&quot; which may be more difficult to pull off at first, <br/>
then something different happens.  We have a range available even before one set course <br/>
of action is consistently chosen.<br/>

Why are they highly developed by 14 in some people and seemingly never  <br/>

<br/>
To say a child has only a fraction of their future capacity isn&#39;t to  <br/>
say that they have no capacity and it certainly isn&#39;t to say that they  <br/>
have no capacity to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I have a daughter who will turn 24 in a couple of weeks. I&#39;ve watched  <br/>
her develop a LOT of  impulse control over just the past year. But  <br/>
that doesn&#39;t mean she had NO ability to develop impulse control 20  <br/>
years ago, when she was only 4 years old.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing that these executive functions are still developing is  <br/>
encouraging to parents, I think, since it means the kids are &quot;still  <br/>
learning&quot; - that&#39;s nice to know when your kid makes lousy decisions.  <br/>
And it is good to have reasonable expectations about our children&#39;s  <br/>
abilities, of course. I mean, those who swat little babies because  <br/>
kicking and squirming during diaper changes shows they are being  <br/>
rebellious could benefit by knowing that those babies aren&#39;t even  <br/>
cognitively capable of that kind of thinking. &quot;Ages and stages&quot;  <br/>

isn&#39;t nice. It&#39;s beyond the hurt to intention and motivation. It<br/>
wasn&#39;t an accident.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just want to chime in again -- been busy traveling and unpacking and <br/>
so have had no time to respond to all the ideas here.  We&#39;re back <br/>
from the family visit and working our way back to balance.  My <br/>
husband actually said to me that he can tell I&#39;ve been around my <br/>
family from the way I&#39;m dealing with Stella right now. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, the kid *does* know that it hurts and she plays little puppet <br/>
games where one puppet hits the other one, the other one cries and <br/>
she does the same &#39;i have to hit you&#39; and then makes them feel better <br/>
bit every time.  It had never occured to me to *ask her* what else <br/>
she can do in the situation.  I always *told* her that she can hit <br/>
other things, but the telling turned her off the idea.  Yesterday we <br/>
played at our friend&#39;s house and I told her before we got there that <br/>
even though she may *need* to hit and scream at her friend when we <br/>
get there (it&#39;s happened before and like I said she gets stuck in <br/>
some interactions, I wasn&#39;t just being pessimistic) we&#39;ve got to find <br/>
another way to deal with it.  Her friend did get whacked with a brush <br/>
(hairdresser was having a tough moment :) but then I reminded Stella <br/>
that she can choose to do something else.  *She* suggested hitting <br/>
and pushing a Dora doll and we did that for a good 15 minutes before <br/>
everything calmed down to the point where the kids could play <br/>
together again without fighting. I still have to get physically <br/>
involved, but hopefully after employing these ideas it will become <br/>
less frequent.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, not that I have to reiterate, but these episodes are not the <br/>
norm for us, only in stressful/tired states does she lash out, and <br/>
usually only when I&#39;m around her.  She&#39;s very polite in public and <br/>
almost eerily (if we&#39;re talking about kids being developmentally at a <br/>
certain point) capable of holding a conversation with an adult. If <br/>
I&#39;m not in the room, she uses her communication/social &#39;fitting in&#39; <br/>
skills more efficiently then when I&#39;m with her.  She knows that if <br/>
I&#39;m not there to help her figure things out it&#39;s better to take the <br/>
safe route.  The problem really is my rebellious vibes I think :)<br/>
<br/>
The good news is I&#39;m missing little pieces and that&#39;s what I&#39;m here <br/>
for -- to fill in the gaps in my understanding of how to deal with <br/>
people, little and big.<br/>
<br/>

with her. Or at least you and her, together. I know my kids wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
want to keep hanging out with another child who lashed out physically  <br/>
more than a time or two.<br/>
<br/>
You seem to be aware of what leads up to her lashing out. Do you not  <br/>
notice the stress building up in time to intervene before the lashing  <br/>
out takes place? Are you helping her recognize the signs, in advance,  <br/>
so that she can have more self-awareness. When she is aware that her  <br/>
own stress level is building up, there are lots of things she can do  <br/>
(and I&#39;m talking about things other than beating on some alternative  <br/>
to the other child, which, yeah, is better than beating on her friend,  <br/>
but still means she&#39;s gotten to a very extreme point). Why don&#39;t you  <br/>
and she together talk about how she&#39;s feeling BEFORE she explodes -  <br/>
and then come up with some things to do when she&#39;s starting to have  <br/>
those feelings - breathe deeply, go to the bathroom, go get a drink of  <br/>
water, calmly express the feelings verbally, get help with whatever is  <br/>
frustrating her - ask an adult for help or even her friend.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m confused about why she&#39;s doing this only when you&#39;re present. Are  <br/>
you sure about that? Have you asked her why that is?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369244756">One thing I really try to do with my kids is help them with tools to<br/>
deal with situations like that.    The ones we have talked about most<br/>
are verbal (asking for space and *me* keeping a sharp ear out for it -<br/>
HUGE part of it) and breathing deeply.  Breathing deeply has mostly<br/>
been from me talking about how I&#39;m frustrated and need to calm down<br/>
and *me* doing it.  My daughter (5) has started using it too.  We&#39;ve<br/>
also started talking about drinking a glass of water to calm down -<br/>
something that works well for me.  The idea came from my grandmother<br/>
who found it helpful with her children.  I also like to be by myself<br/>
for a couple minutes if I am frustrated.  I talk about it with them.<br/>
<br/>
I have not encouraged them to beat up dolls or toys.  Honestly, I<br/>
think it is very threatening.  If an adult got really mad at me and<br/>
starting hitting the wall, a toy, etc. I would find it frightening and<br/>
threatening.    Asking for space, saying no (nicely, if possible),<br/>
breathing... I think those are good peaceful tools.  Beating the crap<br/>
out of a doll doesn&#39;t seem like a great tool, although it is better<br/>
than hitting the friend.  I think that focusing on different tools<br/>
would be even better.<br/>
<br/>
fwiw - my daughter is a little older, but my son is about your<br/>
daughter&#39;s age.  We started talking about &quot;space&quot; before he was two<br/>
and he was using it regularly by then.  I figured that with two of<br/>
them,  conflict was going to happen and I wanted to make sure they had<br/>
some tools to deal with things in a better way than hitting and<br/>
scraming.  &quot;Space&quot; worked very well for us.   The other ones are<br/>
starting to help too.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just want to chime in again -- been busy traveling and unpacking and<br/>
&gt; so have had no time to respond to all the ideas here. We&#39;re back<br/>
&gt; from the family visit and working our way back to balance. My<br/>
&gt; husband actually said to me that he can tell I&#39;ve been around my<br/>
&gt; family from the way I&#39;m dealing with Stella right now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyhoo, the kid *does* know that it hurts and she plays little puppet<br/>
&gt; games where one puppet hits the other one, the other one cries and<br/>
&gt; she does the same &#39;i have to hit you&#39; and then makes them feel better<br/>
&gt; bit every time. It had never occured to me to *ask her* what else<br/>
&gt; she can do in the situation. I always *told* her that she can hit<br/>
&gt; other things, but the telling turned her off the idea. Yesterday we<br/>
&gt; played at our friend&#39;s house and I told her before we got there that<br/>
&gt; even though she may *need* to hit and scream at her friend when we<br/>
&gt; get there (it&#39;s happened before and like I said she gets stuck in<br/>
&gt; some interactions, I wasn&#39;t just being pessimistic) we&#39;ve got to find<br/>
&gt; another way to deal with it. Her friend did get whacked with a brush<br/>
&gt; (hairdresser was having a tough moment :) but then I reminded Stella<br/>
&gt; that she can choose to do something else. *She* suggested hitting<br/>
&gt; and pushing a Dora doll and we did that for a good 15 minutes before<br/>
&gt; everything calmed down to the point where the kids could play<br/>
&gt; together again without fighting. I still have to get physically<br/>
&gt; involved, but hopefully after employing these ideas it will become<br/>
&gt; less frequent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, not that I have to reiterate, but these episodes are not the<br/>
&gt; norm for us, only in stressful/tired states does she lash out, and<br/>
&gt; usually only when I&#39;m around her. She&#39;s very polite in public and<br/>
&gt; almost eerily (if we&#39;re talking about kids being developmentally at a<br/>
&gt; certain point) capable of holding a conversation with an adult. If<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not in the room, she uses her communication/social &#39;fitting in&#39;<br/>
&gt; skills more efficiently then when I&#39;m with her. She knows that if<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not there to help her figure things out it&#39;s better to take the<br/>
&gt; safe route. The problem really is my rebellious vibes I think :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The good news is I&#39;m missing little pieces and that&#39;s what I&#39;m here<br/>
&gt; for -- to fill in the gaps in my understanding of how to deal with<br/>
&gt; people, little and big.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks again for your insights!<br/>

<br/>
That happened at a party my kids were at at another friend&#39;s house.   <br/>
Someone who was primarily my friend, 30ish, was at this party.  He  <br/>
was probably the oldest one there.  Many were mid-20&#39;s.  At some  <br/>
point he started to feel frustrated about having misunderstood a  <br/>
social situation (wanting to protect Holly from something she didn&#39;t  <br/>
need to be protected from) and he started hitting the front door,  <br/>
with his fists, from the inside.  They had been playing a drinking  <br/>
game and he had &quot;won.&quot;  (Not a good plan, overall.)   So Marty called  <br/>
me and asked me to go and pick him up, and I did.<br/>
<br/>
Hitting the door was better than hitting a person, and better than  <br/>
stumbling out into the dark and trying to walk somewhere.  But  <br/>
hitting the door was not good.  It wasn&#39;t his door.  Doors are  <br/>
important and shouldn&#39;t be broken.  And any male of any species  <br/>
performing repeated shows of strength is probably going to be  <br/>
perceived as a danger or a threat.  (Not just male, I guess.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
One of Kirby&#39;s irritating things, when he was young, wasn&#39;t hitting,  <br/>
but it was being more talkative and attention-getting than other  <br/>
kids.  He could steal the spotlight without meaning to, and at  <br/>
something like a birthday party that&#39;s *very* rude. The term I used  <br/>
with him was &quot;Don&#39;t breathe more than your share of the air.&quot;  And as  <br/>
he got older, sometimes I would ask him to make sure that the guest  <br/>
of  honor, or someone there from out of town, or someone who had  <br/>
recently had a disappointment of some sort, would be comfortable and  <br/>
get attention.  So he would use some of the attention-getting power  <br/>
he had and redirect it toward someone else.  It wasn&#39;t like he had  <br/>
the responsibility to make someone else happy, but it was a way for  <br/>
him to remember, when the irresistable urge came to say or do  <br/>
something notable, that he wasn&#39;t the guest of honor.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132900593">&lt;&lt; I&#39;m surprised that you still have other families who want to hang out<br/>

want to keep hanging out with another child who lashed out physically<br/>
more than a time or two.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They keep hanging out with us because the kids have fun together and I get along with <br/>
their moms and because it doesn&#39;t happen more than a time or two with any particular <br/>
family.  And it doesn&#39;t happen with most everyone we know.  Once I know what triggers it <br/>
in a particular dynamic I can prevent it and/or not go over their house if it&#39;s an <br/>
incompatibility issue.   What I haven&#39;t been able to do is predict the trigger in new <br/>
situations with new kids.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You seem to be aware of what leads up to her lashing out. Do you not  <br/>
notice the stress building up in time to intervene before the lashing out takes place? Are <br/>
you helping her recognize the signs, in advance,  so that she can have more self-<br/>
awareness.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most of the time I am, but sometimes I don&#39;t know why she does it -- she can&#39;t tell me <br/>
anything other than that her friend likes it.  She is embarrassed to talk about it, looks down <br/>
and can&#39;t explain what makes her do it.  I haven&#39;t talked to her about being aware of the <br/>
stress ahead of time and coming up with other alternatives to handling it -- I honestly <br/>
haven&#39;t even though that she might know that it&#39;s happening.  I viewed it as typical <br/>
impulsive toddler behavior and thought that she would grow out of it.  She&#39;s been hit and <br/>
yelled at by other toddlers when I wasn&#39;t near her and that&#39;s when her lashing out started <br/>
(not as a direct retaliation, but at a later date)  I haven&#39;t seen much evidence that we&#39;re <br/>
going through something out of the ordinary and I suspect she thinks that&#39;s how things <br/>
roll?   I hate it, I wish she never experienced it, it bothers me to no end that I haven&#39;t been <br/>
able to stop it from happening again and that&#39;s why I posted it here.  How can I explain to <br/>
her that other kids hit but that she shouldn&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been operating under the wrong assumption that if a kid is angry, they need to get <br/>
that out -- don&#39;t hit your friend, hit a pillow instead (I think it&#39;s in How To Talk So Kids <br/>
Will Listen).  I&#39;m happy to see that there are other alternatives, honestly I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
come up with those on my own right now because the only thought that&#39;s running through <br/>
my head is &quot;why?&quot;  Why does she feel threatened enough to hit?  What did I do as her mom <br/>
to make her feel that scared to be out in the world?  I thought I did good last night (yes, it <br/>
was the other kiddo&#39;s Dora I&#39;m sorry to say... we didn&#39;t bring any toys with us) but I guess <br/>
I&#39;ve still got a lot to work on.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;m confused about why she&#39;s doing this only when you&#39;re present. Are  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you sure about that? Have you asked her why that is?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know why for sure.  Sometimes I think it&#39;s because she feels that I&#39;ll bring her out <br/>
of harm&#39;s way if the other kid was to hit her.  I do know that she&#39;s been in a situations (3 <br/>
or 4) where other kids literally ripped things out of her hands while I wasn&#39;t within <br/>
intervention distance and she didn&#39;t do anything to retaliate, she just tries to reason with <br/>
them and then cries because they don&#39;t listen.  I also know that it takes her about a month <br/>
after being in a situation where she got hit/pushed/disrespected by a kid to come back to <br/>
normal, not &#39;on high alert&#39; self.  Would it make sense to keep her out of social situations <br/>
after such an encounter for a while? <br/>
<br/>
 If I&#39;m out of sight (like in the next room or hallway) she&#39;ll do everything in her power to <br/>
use her words and tells the other kids that they can take turns, she&#39;s not done yet, they <br/>
can have something else, etc... She can play for an hour or more if I&#39;m just around the <br/>
corner and not in the room.  I notice that if I&#39;m hovering over her because I&#39;m afraid she&#39;ll <br/>
do something by accident and or on purpose, she does something on purpose almost for <br/>
sure.  That&#39;s what happened last night -- I was afraid she&#39;d pull her friend&#39;s hair while <br/>
brushing it and I kept telling her to be careful.  I think she got mad at me and whacked her <br/>
friend.   I guess instead of hovering I should have taken her to another room -- she was <br/>
very tired and I should have known better.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, off to cry myself to sleep on my huge pillah...<br/>
<br/>
Will do more soul searching/reading tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you :)<br/>
