<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854370348">Some of you may remember that I posted a story recently about a local La <br/>
Leche Leader and homeschooling mom of Ben (7) and Lucy (2) laughing <br/>
about my Emily (7) taking a mother to task for her not-so-gentle <br/>
parenting style. Joanne is an amazingly strong woman who has already <br/>
dealt with so much with her young daughter Lucy over the past year, and <br/>
now this! You can read more about Joanne&#39;s story here: <br/>

<br/>
This wonderful, giving woman has just been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin&#39;s <br/>
Lymphoma. All of this has happened so quickly! She went in for what she <br/>
feared might be strep throat, was flown to Washington Hospital Center <br/>
and has now finished her first round of chemotherapy--all in just over a <br/>
week! This is a tremendous amount of emotional trauma and upheaval for <br/>
the family to process, and those of us trying to help are working <br/>
quickly to identify the most practical and effective ways to expend our <br/>
energy.<br/>
<br/>
Our goal is to provide the family with allergy-free meals at least twice <br/>
a week, and there is a small group of people willing and able to cook <br/>
under such rigorous conditions. Others are offering to do the grocery <br/>
shopping to ensure that the family has a good stock of allergy-free <br/>
foods in the home as well. This is where we feel our energy will be most <br/>
usefully spent during these difficult times.<br/>
<br/>
During this Season of Giving, we are trying to raise as much money as we <br/>
can so that the folks doing the shopping can buy the groceries and leave <br/>
them for the family as a gift during these emotionally and financially <br/>
stressful times. Any little bit that we can raise will go a long way <br/>
towards easing this family&#39;s burden.<br/>
<br/>
I know so many of you have crises on your own homefront, and I&#39;m hoping <br/>
that this appeal does not come across as inappropriate in these forums. <br/>
I feel that I need to reach out to help this homeschooling family in any <br/>
way I can because they are having to endure more than any family ought. <br/>
Please feel free to hit the delete key and move on; I am reaching out <br/>
here to make peace in my own heart.  Thank you all so much for reading!<br/>
<br/>
