 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Can you tell me what you did today?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Joseph (8) and Sierra (7) were up before Alyssa (2) and I were. They were <br/>
out playing battleship for about almost an hour. Then Sierra went on the <br/>
computer, Alyssa and I went outside with the dogs and Joseph went in his <br/>
room working on his drawings. Sierra ate at the computer and Joseph and <br/>
Alyssa joined her, watching and eating as well. Joseph finished and went and <br/>
watched Stanley on TV, then back to his drawings. Alyssa and I watched <br/>
discovery health, babies being born. The I read to her while Sierra was <br/>
still on the computer. She finished and went to play, Alyssa left with her. <br/>
I&#39;m getting my mail, talking with my oldest Tara (17) and cleaning as usual. <br/>
All 3 kids have been back and forth between Joseph&#39;s room and the girls&#39; <br/>
room&#39;s. They have out dolls, beads, games and are playing movies. I told <br/>
them last night that today was a stay home day all day long. I think they <br/>
were looking forward to it as they have been busy and playing and pretty <br/>
quiet. It&#39;s almost 5:00 and they have been happily playing since about 10:00 <br/>
this morning. TV hasn&#39;t been on since Joseph turned off Stanley. oops. just <br/>
heard the Tv in the playroom come on. Joseph and Sierra are seeing what&#39;s on <br/>
and Alyssa is at my side. I asked them what they were playing before and it <br/>
turns out they both made up a card game that entails building structures and <br/>
saving people all at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Too all my relatives and most friends, it would sound like they did <br/>
absolutely nothing all day. Most days of ours are like that. But we know <br/>
different!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Can  you tell me your definition of unschooling?  Do you use any workbook <br/>
at all or is that what unschooling is all about?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Joseph and Sierra have asked for workbooks on occasion. It came from them <br/>
asking for things to do when they were starting to read. I printed out some <br/>
sheets from the internet and asked if that&#39;s what they wanted. It was and <br/>
when we found workbooks that were similar, they would use those too. The <br/>
last sheet or workbook was about a year ago. Haven&#39;t picked one up since. If <br/>
they would ask again, I would get them but I don&#39;t go out and buy them and <br/>
have them laying around trying to entice. &lt;BG&gt; It&#39;s all a matter of what <br/>
they want and what they are interested in.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My day started unusually early. Bryn (9)  charged into my bedroom at 8 am to tell me what he learned about Venus and Mercury. He was clutching a DK Guide to Space and proceeded to read it out loud.<br/>
Heather (10) came in an hour later to show me the new doll&#39;s dress she has sewn. I managed to get another hours doze while they went downstairs.<br/>
Once I got up Rhodri played on the PS while Bryn printed out maths worksheets from the web. Heather sat reading one of the endless Anne of Green Gables books (either she&#39;s re-reading them or there&#39;s an<br/>
awful lot).<br/>
Bryn sat at the table and did the worksheets while I tidied away breakfast and drank coffee.<br/>
Rhodri got out the cuisinaire rods and made towers with them :-) while Heather played the PS. Bryn went back to his space book and then surfed the NASA web site which prevented me from reading email so<br/>
I fixed my bicycle.<br/>
Rhodri and I then went for a walk round the neighbourhood and watched kids get on the 11.30 school bus.<br/>
After lunch, we went to a homeschooling drama class at the local library. Bryn didn&#39;t want to do it so we went to the supermarket while the other two did the class.<br/>
Since we got back I&#39;ve been playing on the PC while the kids made snowflakes out of paper and Bryn finsihed his maths (he wants to be a mission controller for NASA which is why he&#39;s hot on maths this<br/>
week).<br/>
<br/>
Pretty typical day for us. Sometimes we see people (though rare as nearly everyone is a School at home type), sometimes we go to the museums in DC. Bryn wants to go to the Air and Space museum as soon<br/>
as possible.<br/>
Basically the kids do what they want. Sometimes that involves me, sometimes it doesn&#39;t.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;Can you tell me what you did today?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our day today (most times approximate):<br/>
<br/>
6:55 - I get up, thinking I&#39;ll get some email time before the kids <br/>
get up. Make tea, fire up computer<br/>
7:10 - Kids get up, they play with Paintbrush on their computer while <br/>
I finish up email<br/>
7:30 - Kids and I make pancakes, DH heads off to work<br/>
8:15 - Kids and I clean up kitchen after breakfast, they go off to <br/>
play upstairs. Son builds &quot;Transformer Dinosaur&quot; out of Legos that <br/>
becomes a &quot;prehistoric walking whale&quot;<br/>
9:15 - We get dressed and ready to bicycle to the pool<br/>
10:00 - Free play time at the pool<br/>
10:30 - Daughter has her swim lesson, my son and I work on his <br/>
freestyle swimming. He jumps into the deep end and swims to the side <br/>
for the first time. Yay!<br/>
11:00 - Hot tub and showers, then we have a picnic lunch on the deck <br/>
overlooking the pool<br/>
12:15 - Kids go into the childcare area. Daughter paints and draws, <br/>
son builds enormous Lego castle contraption. I cycle and run<br/>
2:00 - Pick up kids from childcare. Go to library<br/>
3:30 - Home. Kids build &quot;Train Race Ramp&quot; on our driveway with Brio <br/>
train tracks and trains. I make salad dressing, cook yams, and thaw <br/>
Tofurkey for dinner. Work in garden, kids help.<br/>
4:00 - Kids decide to join me making yeast bread. DH home from work <br/>
and goes for a run<br/>
4:30 - Bread rising, I chop wood, daughter and son work together to <br/>
crumple newspaper and lay down kindling for fire. I light fire.<br/>
5:00 - I check email, print out chapters I need to read for writer&#39;s <br/>
group. Kids want to know how yeast works. I find a webpage with <br/>
several different experiments <br/>
5:15 - I read/edit chapters and have some tea. Son is making a &quot;Pin <br/>
the tail on the donkey&quot; game. Daughter is playing with toy snakes<br/>
6:00 - I&#39;ll put the bread in the oven, finish dinner. DH and the kids <br/>
will eat. I&#39;ll leave for my writer&#39;s group. DH will do one of the <br/>
yeast experiments with the kids, then he will most likely wrestle <br/>
with the kids and have bounce session on the bed (their favorite <br/>
evening activity) then settle down for story reading. The kids will <br/>
most likely be asleep by the time I get home (10:00). DH and I will <br/>
watch a movie.<br/>
<br/>
In general, we have no &quot;typical&quot; days, although there are days of the <br/>
week when we often go to the same scheduled activities (tomorrow, for <br/>
instance, we will go to our Homeschool group&#39;s play time at the <br/>
gymnastics center). We also have several things that usually happen <br/>
in any given day, like reading books is pretty much a constant. And <br/>
some days we try to take advantage of the weather if it&#39;s nice, <br/>
taking a hike or going flying or bicycling or to the snow. What the <br/>
kids do whenever they&#39;re at home is always different, and depends on <br/>
what they&#39;re into at the moment. In general, my son is very into <br/>
Legos, and creating all sorts of experiments and projects. His <br/>
greatest desire is to build a RUbe Goldberg-type device, and I think <br/>
that&#39;s what he&#39;s turning his room into. My daughter is into music. <br/>
She is often listening to music on her tape player, playing it on the <br/>
piano, recorder, harmonica, or whatever she can find, or singing. She <br/>
sings about 8 hours a day, I swear! It sounds like Rogers & <br/>
Hammerstein around here most of the time :-)<br/>
