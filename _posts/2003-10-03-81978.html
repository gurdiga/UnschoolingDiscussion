Ok, who&#39;s in that area?  Anybody?<br/>
Tia in Canada <br/>
<br/>
We are in the Southeastern part of Florida. Not very helpful.<br/>
As far as finding others who think &quot;outside the box&quot; you might want to try attending a service at a UU church. LOTS of free thinkers there.<br/>
It&#39;s were I met the mom who inspired me to become an unschooler.<br/>
My four year old is currently teaching himself to read. The whole thing is entirely his idea. And, thanks to the wisdom of this list, I am not messing with the process. I help when he asks for help. I read to him when he brings me a book and asks me to read it. I believe that he will be able to read without intervention, at his own pace and in his own time. And he will carry a love of reading with him for the rest of his days.<br/>
I see no reason why this would not carry over to all the other things he wants to learn in his life.<br/>
As always, thanks to this list for helping me see the obvious.<br/>
