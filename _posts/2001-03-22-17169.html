<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876558414">For anyone interested, we are investigating the possibility of <br/>
Cohousing, or a similar such ecovilliage community, in NW Washington <br/>
most likely.  We are looking into existing communities, and thinking <br/>
over beginning putting together our own, should we not be able to <br/>
find what we are looking for.  We will be moving up there in the next <br/>
several years, with the time frame depending on what we eventually <br/>
decide to do.<br/>
<br/>
Right now we own our home in SE Idaho, and would not be able to <br/>
liquidate that for at least a year.  We do not want to rent, as we <br/>
consider that a waste of money, but may have to out of necessity, <br/>
until we get settled on land for our more permanent home.  Our <br/>
primary consideration right now is to get over there (to NW WA) so <br/>
that we can be local to investigate properties and opportunities, <br/>
and begin forming relationships with prospective community members.<br/>
<br/>
We are not looking to create an exclusive or exclusionary community, <br/>
and are not limiting based on race, sex, sexual orientation, <br/>
religion, age, physical condition, etc.  We will however, be looking <br/>
for mentally sound members who can contribute to the greater good of <br/>
the community  We are looking more for folks with a general attitude <br/>
of earth stewardship and openmindedness who can enrich and diversify <br/>
a community living lightly on the land, in individual family homes <br/>
around shared common space, gardens, land and group facilities.  One <br/>
group facility would be a group house, with space for optional shared <br/>
meals, socializing, child care, entertainment, laundry, projects, <br/>
crafts, meetings, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone with interest and or/experience in this area is welcome to <br/>
contact us privately and offer advice, encouragement, ideas, etc.  I <br/>
have begun an email group for sharing on this topic, limited to <br/>
serious prospective community members, as well as those with <br/>
experience in community living, sustainable living and related <br/>
issues, from whom we can all learn.  Contact me if you are interested <br/>
in discussing it.<br/>

Nanci, wow, I am so jealous!  I would love to be part <br/>
of something like that, I don&#39;t think my dh would ever <br/>
countenance it :-(  The very idea!  UGH!  Though i may <br/>
yet be surprised...  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, more power to your elbow, and I&#39;ll be living <br/>
vicariously through you while you do!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nanci, good for you! Communities are such a vital part of life and it&#39;s sad<br/>
that most neighborhoods are no longer really communities. We had the same<br/>
ideas as you all, we were living in NW Washington and we visited some of the<br/>
communities there. If you can, Sharingwood is a great community to visit,<br/>
just Northeast of Seattle. I think they have a website up somewhere. We<br/>
wanted to start a community, out in Central Oregon, but found the task too<br/>
daunting and figured out that by the time we really got it off the ground,<br/>
our kids would be older than we wanted them to be. Instead, we ended up<br/>
moving here to Eugene and we live right next to an intentional neighborhood<br/>
community which we will hopefully join at some point (they are growing). Our<br/>
whole neighborhood is so community-oriented, it is great. We know all our<br/>
neighbors and do many things with them, we&#39;ve had holiday parties and<br/>
canning get-togethers and we get gardening advice and so much more.<br/>
Community definitely makes a big difference in how our lives go on a daily<br/>
basis. The one thing I like about where we are now is that we have community<br/>
and we&#39;re also right in town, so we can bicycle anywhere and have all the<br/>
advantages of being in town. Anyways, if you&#39;re interested in visiting our<br/>
neighborhood and the community that is down the street, let me know! It&#39;s a<br/>
bit unique, because instead of going rural to form their community, these<br/>
people all bought lots in a subdivision and built their own houses around a<br/>
cul-de-sac in town. But the houses are not your typical suburban houses, the<br/>
re&#39;s a strawbale house and some made out of rast-crete (sp?) and other<br/>
alternative building materials.<br/>
