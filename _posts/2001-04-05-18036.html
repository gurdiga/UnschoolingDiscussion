I agree with you Johanna. But I also think that the reason some things have<br/>
gotten better is because a lot of &quot;doom and gloomers&quot; took the time and<br/>
energy to be outspoken. Without the &quot;save the whales&quot; and &quot;treehugger&quot;<br/>
types, I think things would be much, much worse than they are. Sandra was<br/>
putting down someone who was strongly stating her preferences for leading an<br/>

And also, let&#39;s not rest on our laurels. Here in Oregon, the Willamette<br/>
River was one of those &quot;success&quot; stories like you mentioned. A previously<br/>
filthy river that was cleaned up in the 70&#39;s and became beautiful and<br/>
swimmable. Well, now it is very polluted again and they are urging us not to<br/>
swim in it anymore. So we must be ever vigilant even about the changes we<br/>
have wrought. We have an enormous impact on the whole earth. Women in the<br/>
few small aboriginal tribes left on earth have environmental pollutants in<br/>
their breastmilk. I&#39;ve personally traveled to remote uninhabited beaches<br/>
halfway around the world and seen garbage washing up on the shore. I&#39;m<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056866435">You are so right, Robin!!!  And what is doubly sad is that while we are<br/>
affecting some changes here, all that we know is bad and harmful is being<br/>
sent elsewhere.  Go down to Mexico and see what the companies that have left<br/>
the U.S. are doing there!  We ship our medical wastes on barges and dump<br/>
them in other countries, U.S. companies still manufacturer DDT and sell it<br/>
in other countries and the list goes on.<br/>
<br/>
We need more folks that try to live in the sunshine while actively working<br/>
to keep the darkness away!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>     SO true, Lynda!  I just came online this morning and found this debate <br/>
raging here on the list.  Hopefully, everyone will be able to state their <br/>
views, hear other people&#39;s views, and not storm off the list in anger.  <br/>
     I think one reason so many people are not comforted by assurances that <br/>
GMOs, current pesticides, nuclear power plants, etc. are not as safe as many <br/>
proclaim them to be is that those same proclamations were made by many <br/>
politicians and &quot;experts&quot; in years past about things that were anything but <br/>
safe.  Every generation arrogantly assumes that it knows so much NOW and <br/>
arrogantly imposes its so-called knowledge and destructive practices on other <br/>
human beings, those alive at the time as well as those yet to be born.<br/>
     It is certainly possible to be an upbeat, happy, at peace person while <br/>
still speaking out strongly for a safer, more fair way of life for all human <br/>
beings.  In fact, any happiness that doesn&#39;t strive for this seems rather <br/>
shallow and unstable.<br/>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp; I will never buy all of the doom and gloom out there. I think man 
can sometimes think himself too powerful, and that he can have a massive effect 
on earth. I look at man as ant size as far as the planet goes, if that big. I 
see neglected buildings on occasion, and just notice how the earth swallows them 
up. The vines, insects, grasses, trees,&nbsp;rain all help turn the building 
into dust and naturally cleanse the area. Polluted areas too, once left alone by 
man, they heal. Even if something is polluted for a couple of hundred years, 
that is very short earth time. </div>
<div>I don&#39;t mean it is a good thing to pollute and be wasteful- people should 
be considerate and respectful of nature, but for some people that is more of a 
challenge.</div>

Australian aborigines shaped the environment of Australia just with fire.<br/>
They&#39;re also suspected of causing a mass extinction 40,000 years ago when they<br/>
came to Australia, and the American Indians are suspected of causing one<br/>
11,000 years ago when they came to the Americas.  (There&#39;s no doubt there was<br/>
mass extinctions on those continents; some people prefer to blame climate<br/>
change entirely, without reference to human hunters.)  And extinct species<br/>
don&#39;t come back in a couple of hundred years.<br/>
<br/>
The civilization of Easter Island collapsed after they chopped down all the<br/>
trees.  Small island, yes, but there are 6 billion humans on the planet.  Not<br/>
ant-size.  <br/>
<br/>
And this is stone age technology.<br/>
<br/>
There are a bunch of civilizations which have collapsed due to climate change,<br/>
but I don&#39;t know cases well enough to list &quot;natural change&quot; or &quot;screwed<br/>
themselves&quot;.  Jared Diamond&#39;s next book should be about just this, though:<br/>
societies which did themselves in environmentally.<br/>

<br/>
But it seems it is natural for species and civilizations to die out on this <br/>
planet.  It has happened since before humans arrived.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The civilization of Easter Island collapsed after they chopped down all the<br/>
trees.  Small island, yes, but there are 6 billion humans on the planet.  Not<br/>
ant-size.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And this is stone age technology.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And so we&#39;re not so guilty--we just have fancier tools.<br/>
And we have knowledge, but it could be we will be considered in retrospect to <br/>
have been are misusing our knowledge as surely as it seems to some people now <br/>
that too much wood cutting on an island or a desert area in New Meixco in <br/>
prehistoric times was stupid.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t see it as about respecting nature.  I see it as about not fouling<br/>
our nest.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What would the Easter Island natives have done to amend the problem with what <br/>
they knew?  Plant trees?  Use other building methods or fire methods? (Whale <br/>
oil? That saves trees, but talk about political incorrectness applied <br/>
retroactively!!)  Move to another island BEFORE they cut all the wood there?<br/>
<br/>
We judge other cultures, past and present, too much by our own awarenesses <br/>
and sensibilities, and we judge our own too much by that too.  We don&#39;t <br/>
understand as much as we think we do.  There are VERY many technological <br/>
&quot;advances&quot; with which we have screwed ourselves and continue to do so.     <br/>
But we will screw ourselves with or without clean air and water if we as a <br/>
species, as a culture, as a subculture, as a family, as an individual, live a <br/>
life without hope and joy and happiness.<br/>
<br/>
And about ANY scientific theory, we could be laughably and entirely wrong.<br/>
Which was dumber, using leaches or saying that all those who used leaches <br/>
were unscientific quacks?  We encourage interracial marriage (meaning more <br/>
generally, inter-group-of-all-kinds marriage.  I know, I do too.  But it&#39;s <br/>
starting to seem it causes more cesareans (and maybe other reproductive <br/>
problems, I don&#39;t know).  Still being looked at, but those who suggest it are <br/>
scorned as racist.<br/>

  even about the changes we<br>have wrought. We have an enormous impact on the

&gt; they came to Australia, and the American Indians are suspected of causing<br/>

&gt; planet.  It has happened since before humans arrived.<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s &#39;natural&#39; for giant rocks to occasionally thwack the planet and wipe out<br/>
90% of all life.  Doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;d want to risk aerobraking large asteroids<br/>
into Earth orbit.  <br/>
<br/>
But my point in replying to Wendy wasn&#39;t to allocate blame, it was to point<br/>
out that humans have affected their environment, and with primitive<br/>
technology.  Humans have occasionally destroyed their local environment.  6<br/>
billion humans with modern tools are not like ants.<br/>
<br/>
(Which is a bad example anyway; _ants_ aren&#39;t like &#39;ants&#39;.  Something to get<br/>
your kids interested in, perhaps: most of the animal biomass is insects and<br/>
worms, and most of the insects are ants.  (Although there are more species of<br/>
beetle.)  I&#39;m fairly sure I&#39;ve read that ants have major roles in the<br/>
ecosystem, and if ants species went extinct things would collapse, at least<br/>
for a while.)<br/>
<br/>
So we&#39;ve had Collette saying humans are like a plague of superbugs, and Wendy<br/>
saying we&#39;re like ants and the Earth will survive anything we do, and for all<br/>
my earlier arguing with Collette and Robin I&#39;m closer to their position.  We<br/>
certainly have the power to be a plague of superbugs; my argument was simply<br/>
against exagerrating problems.  It&#39;s not as if they need it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And so we&#39;re not so guilty--we just have fancier tools.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, this isn&#39;t about guilt.  Guilt&#39;s pointless, here.  I&#39;m not here to say<br/>
&quot;bad aborigines, you wiped out all those species!&quot;  Or even &quot;bad Brazilians,<br/>
cutting down all those rainforests!&quot;  But it happened, and it&#39;s happening, and<br/>
if we have a light impact on the Earth it&#39;ll be because we work for that, not<br/>
because the Earth is big.<br/>
<br/>
People used to not worry about overfishing or overhunting because hey, the<br/>
Earth is big, there are lots of animals, we couldn&#39;t really hunt enough to<br/>
wipe out a whole species, could we?  Oops.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; they knew?  Plant trees?  Use other building methods or fire methods? (Whale <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Applying one of the many Polynesian taboos to their trees might have helped.<br/>
It&#39;s not as if they were all going for firewood; rollers for all those statues<br/>
seems to have been the main consumer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And about ANY scientific theory, we could be laughably and entirely wrong.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But what are you going to do?  Generally the scientific theory is the current<br/>
best guess, right or wrong.  And the guesses get better as measurements<br/>
improve.<br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>_Science_ had a special section on human migrations just a few weeks ago -- 2<br/>
March 2001 issue.  According to those articles, the evidence that Indians were<br/>
here at all before 11,800 years ago is still hotly debated, and &quot;long before&quot;,<br/>
well, depends on what you mean by &#39;long&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a layer in the strata called Clovis, from the site it was first found<br/>
at.  This layer and its distinctive tools are pretty much found throughout the<br/>
Americas.  The oldest dated artifacts are from 11,800 years Before Present,<br/>
corresponding with the Bering land bridge having been blocked by ice between<br/>
13,000 and 12,000 years BP.  Also corresponding with lots of large animals<br/>
going extinct in North America.<br/>
<br/>
There are various other sites with claims of dates before Clovis, the oldest<br/>
being Meadowcroft in Pennsylvania, with a claim of 19,000 years BP.  None of<br/>
these have been embraced by the scientific community, with questions about<br/>
either the dates or the human origin of the alleged stone tools.  (And with<br/>
Pennsylvania, I have to wonder who would have been living there then --<br/>
perhaps people swept away from Europe or Africa.  No human bones were<br/>
mentioned in this article.)  All of these sites are scattered in space and<br/>
time; Clovis is pervasive, like a plague of superbugs. :)<br/>
<br/>
There is no hint of questioning of the land bridge idea, which makes perfect<br/>
sense: glaciers lower the sea level, but block the exposed land, except for a<br/>
brief window.<br/>
<br/>
So there were humans everywhere a bit after 12,000 years ago (sorry for being<br/>
off 1000 in my first post) and possibly some before then, but we&#39;re not sure,<br/>
and not sure how they&#39;d have gotten there, and they didn&#39;t get far.  (Clovis<br/>
also refers to a distinct culture, judging by tool shapes.)<br/>

That&#39;s what I heard, from a midwife.  That in cultures wihtout intermarriage<br/>
CPD is unheard of.<br/>
<br/>
***Okay, the only cases of &quot;CPD&quot; I&#39;ve ever heard of were of couples the same<br/>
race. (CPD meaning the pelvis is too small for the mother to birth the<br/>
baby.) Thing is, CPD is used as a huge excuse to hurry up the delivery. I&#39;ve<br/>
heard of doctors saying &quot;The baby was in there &#39;funny&#39;&quot; or &quot;You don&#39;t want<br/>
to be in pain, do you?&quot; (like c-sections...surgery...doesn&#39;t hurt?) and even<br/>
&quot;We could be here all night&quot; (those pesky babies, taking more than 8 hours<br/>
to be born). So they say, it&#39;s CPD, it&#39;s out of our hands, we have to do<br/>
this. And this is generally after a whole bunch of intervention already:<br/>
being connected to machines and given drugs.<br/>
<br/>
My midwife, who&#39;s assisted with over 2000 babies over the past 25 years<br/>
never said anything about inter-racial couples having trouble with birthing.<br/>
I&#39;ll email and ask her, though. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me. The only<br/>
person I know who truly had a pelvis too small to birth vaginally is my sil.<br/>
She grew up poor in Europe and had lousy health care. So she didn&#39;t develop<br/>
as well as she should have. She married within her &quot;race&quot; to a man of normal<br/>
proportion. Their babies were healthy and not too large, but there was no<br/>
way they could get past her pelvic bone.<br/>
<br/>
The inter-racial couples I know (black/white, Asian/white) had no problem.<br/>
If CPD is &quot;unheard of&quot; in cultures without inter-racial marriage perhaps<br/>
it&#39;s because those countries have better birthing practices?<br/>

The Beringia Interpretive Center in Whitehorse, YT, is a fascinating <br/>
place. We visit it on almost every trip to Alaska and always learn <br/>
something new!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-797274138">You have stated &quot;I was told&quot; and &quot;studies are being done.&quot;  While you might<br/>
not being &quot;putting forward&quot; this theory, obviously someone or many<br/>
individuals are &quot;placing a theory/idea in front of a group for review,&quot; that<br/>
is putting forward.<br/>
<br/>
As to what it is based on, we are back to junk science.  In the few<br/>
countries where there is little or no interracial marriage (African natives,<br/>
Australian Aboriginis, Alaskan Natives), there would be more c-sections if<br/>
such medical care was available and the designated population were aware of<br/>
its necessity.  At this point in time, the maternal death stats could be<br/>
dramatically reduced by the advent of c-section availability in those<br/>
countries.  Most *necessary* c-sections (I say necessary as most in the U.S.<br/>
are NOT necessary but merely a convenience) have nothing to do with the size<br/>
of the pelvic region or the birth canal.  Most necessary c-sections are due<br/>
to placenta previa, fetal distress, maternal distress (extremely elevated<br/>
blood pressure), poor nutrition of the mother resulting in things such as<br/>
toxemia and internal bleeding.  Those are not related to size of the fetus.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576587778">CPD is due to alot of factors-race possibly being one, though I haven&#39;t seen<br/>
it in practice.<br/>
The kind of labor, the position of the baby, the shape of the pelvis, and<br/>
the birth attendant&#39;s level of patience all have to do with whether the baby<br/>
makes the journey throught the birth canal. Plenty of women had CPD for one<br/>
baby and have birthed the next vaginally, sometimes a bigger size baby. They<br/>
used to predict CPD by looking at xrays (horror) and also have also tried to<br/>
predict with ultrasound. Ultrasound predicts weights + or - 1lb. or<br/>
sometimes more.  A midwife or doctor can feel a pelvis and get a sense of<br/>
shape and dimensions beforehand, but basically it doesn&#39;t mean alot until<br/>
the labor happens. The best pelvimeter is the baby&#39;s head during a long<br/>
enough experience of active labor.<br/>

It makes a difference, y&#39;know.  <br/>

Different size babies than that race left to itself would have produced.  <br/>

<br/>
     I have to say that this kind of statement still concerns me even though <br/>
I understand that you, Sandra, have said that you aren&#39;t saying whether the <br/>
cesarean thing is true.  What would such a thing possibly mean?  Is it even <br/>
conceivable that it would be &quot;irresponsible&quot; for people of different racial <br/>
backgrounds to have children together?  From various replies on here, we have <br/>
heard some evidence already to the contrary.<br/>
     I think it is normal and healthy to heavily question inflamatory <br/>
statements and demand evidence for those kinds of claims.  Humans have been <br/>
far too quick to accept ridiculous theories that brought about great harm on <br/>
their fellow human beings (racial and otherwise).  If someone casually threw <br/>
out some theory about homeschooled kids turning out to commit suicide more <br/>
than schooled kids (totally made up here), I would think that you and any of <br/>
us would question that pretty strongly.  These theories may seem like no big <br/>
deal to the people tossing them about (who aren&#39;t the group being spoken of) <br/>
but history tells us they can cause great horrors.<br/>

<br/>
My point is being missed, but it&#39;s a weird point.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I would argue (and did!  and do!), but SOME of this stuff is going to be <br/>
shown to be dangerously wrong.  We don&#39;t know what; that&#39;s my point.<br/>
<br/>
What is &quot;correct&quot; and &quot;obvious&quot; to people while they live is often dismissed <br/>
as baseless fifty or a hundred years later.<br/>
<br/>
My example of leeches--the came, they went, they&#39;re back--is prime.  People <br/>
were wise, in the early leech days, to know how to use them.  Then for a few <br/>
hundred years that was scoffed at BIGTIME as &quot;How STUPID can people BE!?  <br/>
They used to use LEECHES!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now people are using leeches again, succesfully and scientifically, with full <br/>
biochemical explanations and justifications and now they scorn the anti-leech <br/>
years for being smug and intolerant and lacking in actual scientific inquiry <br/>
but too quick to condemn out of hand.<br/>
<br/>
Dentistry doesn&#39;t look at other cultures for comparison.  <br/>
Just lately pre-natal factors and the idea of caries being a communicable <br/>
disease have been discussed by the mainstream.  Five years ago when I <br/>
mentioned to the kids&#39; dentist that I had read that cavities were contagious, <br/>
he gave me the look as though I had said &quot;Do you use leeches?&quot; and said in <br/>
that &quot;I&#39;m a doctor and you&#39;re not&quot; voice, &quot;I don&#39;t know where you would have <br/>
read THAT; I&#39;ve never heard of that.<br/>
<br/>
Huh.<br/>
<br/>
Now because HE read it somewhere, it&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
The example about cesareans is SO politically incorrect that people here have <br/>
jumped on it hard.  All the talking and example-giving we go through here <br/>
won&#39;t matter, if when we&#39;ve all been dead 20 years it&#39;s looked back at as a <br/>
legitimate factor.  I AM NOT SAYING IT WILL BE.   I&#39;m saying it is something <br/>
I heard from a professional in the field as a possibility, and it is <br/>
something which will NOT be considered or researched because it&#39;s too <br/>
volatile, but someday it might possibly be considered in a different light.  <br/>
And if not that one, hundreds of other things we consider now to be safe, <br/>
right and good.<br/>
<br/>
There was a time (in recent memory, and NOW for some people) that <br/>
Christianity was considered MUCH more important than any native culture or <br/>
language or dress.  I have heard that when Presbyterian or Anglican <br/>
missionaries went to the south Pacific in the 19th century, they had <br/>
islanders wearing Victorian clothes and some died of the heat--they were <br/>
SUPPOSED to be mostly naked.  But because it was a sin, it was &quot;better&quot; for <br/>
them to be saved and die and go to heaven than to continue to live naked and <br/>
then burn in hell.<br/>
<br/>
That seems insane to some of us, and to some it will probably still seem <br/>
justifiable.<br/>
<br/>
Whole languages have been lost.  But are languages more important than the <br/>
prevailing culture?  Languages have been being lost since before there was <br/>
much knowledge of what language is, how it works, where it comes from, and <br/>
what you can tell from a language.  So scholars bemoan the loss of a clue in <br/>
their history-of-the-world puzzle, but the people who would have spoken that <br/>
language are all dead anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Except for some of the Indian languages.  Is restoring a language (Inuit or <br/>
Navajo) by teaching it in school ANYTHING like natural transmission?   It&#39;s a <br/>
shadow of a hint, only.  But it&#39;s kind of like captive breeding.  Some people <br/>
base their lives on it.  Some think it&#39;s a waste of time and produces <br/>
unnaturally-gotten infants of a species with no &quot;culture&quot; to return to and <br/>
learn from.<br/>
<br/>
History will interpret what we&#39;re doing differently than we do ourselves, and <br/>
some of our best ideas will be discredited, and some of our lamest might be <br/>
&quot;future truth.&quot;<br/>

those days have been so ignorant?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We look back and we know Galileo was an alright guy.<br/>
<br/>
In his time he was NOT considered an alright guy.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who were considered alright guys a hundred years ago who <br/>
aren&#39;t now.<br/>
<br/>
There are people considered nobel-prize-winning heroes now who will, for <br/>
reasons as yet unknown to ANY of us, be considered monstrous and lacking in <br/>

it.<br/>

<br/>
     Of course this is true at times and I have talked about this same thing <br/>
with others, saying that we should all learn the lesson to not be too <br/>
arrogant about the current ways of doing things.  However, this can be taken <br/>
to an extreme which prevents people from having convictions on anything.  <br/>
What if some expert 200 years from now claims homeschooling was horrible?  <br/>
There are some things that are true, period, not just based on the times a <br/>
person is living in.  Hitler and his followers are not going to be found good <br/>
and intelligent in the future, except by those who are as screwed up and evil <br/>
as they were.<br/>
     And, going back to the environmental issues that led into this, no, we <br/>
don&#39;t know the effects of everything we&#39;re doing or all the solutions.  But <br/>
that is precisely the problem with the current uses of umpteen chemicals, <br/>
radioactive wastes generated by nuclear power plants, etc.  If we don&#39;t know <br/>
completely what we&#39;re doing, isn&#39;t it rather stupid and arrogant to just <br/>
assume that somebody sometime in the future will come up with a solution or <br/>
that it probably won&#39;t cause much damage?  And I don&#39;t think this is an issue <br/>
of judging our current generation too harshly.  We don&#39;t have to condemn <br/>
someone to say that what he/she&#39;s doing is stupid and needs to be stopped, <br/>
especially things that affect everyone alive today and in the future.<br/>
     Also, this is not at all in the same league as the c-section theory you <br/>
brought up.  There are many respected scientists who are very concerned about <br/>
pollution issues and have solid evidence of the problems caused.  That is not <br/>
the case with the theory you told us about.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177057367">Well, would seem you aren&#39;t getting the point as your slightly racist remark<br/>
didn&#39;t not help make any point.  Nor did it have any bearing on the topic at<br/>
hand.  To be blunt, none of the genocide/eugenics type<br/>
theories/gossip/innuendos/beliefs has yet to be proven scientifically or<br/>
otherwise as they were practiced to throughout history.<br/>
<br/>
As to leaches, facts are that they were used in one manner but have since<br/>
been found to be somewhat helpful in another.  So the one does not prove the<br/>
other.  And, most folks, for some reason read about the use of maggots and<br/>
somehow end up thinking it is the leeches that have been given a new status<br/>
by scientists.  Blood letting be it by leech or knife or needle has not been<br/>
proven to have been good medicine.<br/>
<br/>
Nor have you actually answered the question that I asked but then folks<br/>
generally don&#39;t.<br/>
