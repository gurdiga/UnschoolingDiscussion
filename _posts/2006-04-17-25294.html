&quot;The other piece of this for me is that often the<br/>
behaviors that tempt me to punish Eric are behaviors<br/>
that he really is not in control of. He&#39;s a great kid<br/>
who wants to do what&#39;s right and has a lot of respect<br/>
for other people but he is sometimes too tired, too<br/>
hungry, too over-wrought, or, recently for a period of<br/>
several months, apparently going through some kind of<br/>
mysterious developmental process we don&#39;t understand.<br/>
As hard as his behavior has been for me  <br/>
during that period, there&#39;s no point in punishing<br/>
because if he could control himself, he would!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
thanks for this Su! this is a perfect description of<br/>
how things are with Galen (3) too. it&#39;s so important<br/>
to remember this at those moments when I&#39;m really<br/>
frustrated with him-- he&#39;s probably really frustrated<br/>
with himself, too! or with me (gasp!)!! when all his<br/>
reserves are filled up, there are no problems. I<br/>
forget if it&#39;s inductive or deductive logic (never did<br/>
get that right in school lol), but at any rate I can<br/>
infer or deduce from that statement that problems<br/>
indicate a reserve is in need of a refill. as he grows<br/>
and learns how to voice what refill he needs the<br/>
&quot;problem&quot; behaviors I see now will be replaced with<br/>
words that I can understand better. of course, this<br/>
will be a long time coming, but I know it&#39;s coming! :D<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It came for us literally overnight about two weeks ago. I went to bed  <br/>
one night at my wit&#39;s end; I wanted to be sympathetic with Eric&#39;s  <br/>
whining, seemingly non-proportional responses to tiny problems, his  <br/>
pecking away at our personal space (literally poke...poke...poke),  <br/>
this endless parade of challenging behaviors that had been going on  <br/>
for weeks...maybe months, it&#39;s all a blur!  But I felt like I was  <br/>
constantly at the limit of my patience, or beyond. In bed, I wept on  <br/>
my partner&#39;s shoulder. &quot;This isn&#39;t the relationship I want with him!  <br/>
This isn&#39;t the mom I want to be!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The next morning, Eric woke up cheerful (rare for him even at the  <br/>
best of times). All day, he handled small frustrations with aplomb  <br/>
(&quot;We&#39;re out of pudding? That&#39;s OK, we&#39;ll get more when we go to the  <br/>
store.&quot;), he participated cheerfully in decision-making, he respected  <br/>
requests for personal space. He started taking himself to the  <br/>
bathroom instead of wanting company, and even closing the door for  <br/>
privacy while he was in there. He started cheerfully dressing himself  <br/>
in the morning. And he&#39;s been like that ever since. We joke that his  <br/>
software was upgraded during the night!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll be 5 in about six weeks.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with the &quot;developmental fix&quot; having happened is that I  <br/>
did _not_ solve my problems with impatience, I did _not_ figure out  <br/>
better strategies for planning our time or using our days better, I  <br/>
was _not_ able to figure out what underlying need Eric had that  <br/>
wasn&#39;t getting met. I feel like I got a lucky break, but there are  <br/>
still some mom-skills to be further developed for the next  <br/>
challenging stage.<br/>

<br/>
You might never have a challenging stage.   Sometimes lives ARE easy,  <br/>
and we don&#39;t have to hold our breath waiting for the next challenge.<br/>
<br/>
Very cool story, about Eric.<br/>
<br/>
I remember it was almost disturbing to me when one of my kids would  <br/>
wake up one day and look different—the smile or face would have  <br/>
changed.  Just suddenly older.<br/>
