<br/>
I am angry, I was hoping that it would pass but it is not. My 12yro plays <br/>
basketball on our church team, he has played different sports with the same kids <br/>
(and coaches) for the last several years. He likes to participate and has <br/>
always been very happy with being a team player. I have let a number of issues <br/>
pass because he has not had a problem I have. As in most organizations there are <br/>
a few fathers that always coach, they have the time and the interest and from <br/>
observation I can see how their kids perform is very important to them. The <br/>
mothers are exactly the same, they know every sport intimately and can get quite <br/>
riled though they keep it within acceptable (so they don&#39;t get thrown out <br/>
acceptable) limits. <br/>
<br/>
Except for volleyball which has a mother coaching who is wonderful and fair <br/>
my son sits out a good bit. He is a good player but I guess he is not a &quot;star&quot; <br/>
player. (I also think how the coach plays a player and the message he sends <br/>
affects a persons playing, we live up or down to others expectations but that is <br/>
another post)<br/>
<br/>
Both coaches sons are &quot;star&quot; players, there are a number of very good players <br/>
on the team. My son missed both practices last week and was therefore <br/>
relegated to playing just a few minutes of one quarter. It was never put into words <br/>
but a comment made at team picture day Sunday confirmed what we already <br/>
thought, sitting out longer than usual was a punitive measure. What really hurt was <br/>
that one of our older boys came and also one of my son&#39;s friends. <br/>
<br/>
This is getting wordy, please bear with me. <br/>
<br/>
I am having a real problem with all of this because even if my son went to <br/>
both practices he only ever gets to play a quarter at most. I might even be able <br/>
to swallow that had I not witnessed this. The assistant Coaches son has a <br/>
hard time staying calm, when he is getting stressed because they are behind or he <br/>
has made a mistake he does something so that he can act like he is injured so <br/>
he can go sit down and cry, when he is finished crying he wants right back in <br/>
the game. I watched a few weeks ago this whole scenario and watched him get <br/>
back up and say something to his father who right away reached over (they were <br/>
having a time out) and tap my son on the shoulder, my son&#39;s face dropped, he <br/>
too knew what was going on. This happend every time.<br/>
<br/>
I watched it happen again this week with a different kid since my son was <br/>
benched anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
My DH thinks I should let it go, I am gagging on it. I do not want to call <br/>
and scream at them, I want to call and explain how this all looks from another <br/>
POV.  My son has signed up to play baseball with pretty much the same people <br/>
and I am trying to find a way to get through this. <br/>
<br/>
Should I call the coach about the inconsistencies I see or should I let it <br/>
go? If I should let it go I need to find a way to look at the situation that <br/>
does now appall me.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I am angry, I was hoping that it would pass but it is not. My 12yro plays <br/>
basketball on our church team, he has played different sports with the same <br/>
kids <br/>
(and coaches) for the last several years. He likes to participate and has <br/>
always been very happy with being a team player. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I want to pick three words out of this and tell you what my first impression <br/>
was:<br/>
<br/>
church<br/>
team<br/>
happy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Churches always have and always will have social problems.  Some of them ARE <br/>
social problems.<br/>
<br/>
Teams always have and always will have problems.  Either they&#39;re run &quot;fairly&quot; <br/>
and they stink, or they&#39;re run to win, and that stinks for those who don&#39;t <br/>
feel it was fair.  That problem has existed since people said &quot;let&#39;s share.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Happy&quot; is the main one.  If your so is happy, he will still go.  If he&#39;s not <br/>
happy, don&#39;t press him to go.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t change church.  You can&#39;t change teams.<br/>
<br/>
And part of your complaint is the overinvolvement of parents.  Don&#39;t become <br/>
one.  <br/>
<br/>
If YOUR happiness depends on your son&#39;s happiness, that&#39;s co-dependency.  <br/>
You&#39;re not on the team.  You&#39;re not even on the team of coach-supporting, <br/>
kid-pushing moms, it doesn&#39;t sound like.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re freaking out on the side, will your son be trying to decide what to <br/>
do based in part on whether it will make you happy?   That&#39;s too much <br/>
responsibility for him.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can just tell him once a week or less &quot;You don&#39;t have to go if you <br/>
don&#39;t want to.&quot; But if the not going involves practices, that will cost him at <br/>
games.  <br/>
<br/>
Not all kids are great athletes or singers or actors or swimmers, and in a <br/>
case in which a team is trying to fulfill a goal, that goal is rarely to give <br/>
everyone a chance.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My DH thinks I should let it go, I am gagging on it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How does your son feel?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I do not want to call <br/>
and scream at them,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I want to call and explain how this all looks from another POV.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to do anything, put it in writing.  Then you can polish it <br/>
and say your whole piece without the coach interrupting or justifying.  Print <br/>
it out.  Make a copy.  Sign it in pretty ink.  Give it to him in writing so <br/>
he can&#39;t forget or misquote or ignore.   <br/>
<br/>
It probably won&#39;t help him, but it might help you.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I should let it go I need to find a way to look at the situation that <br/>
does now appall me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you have to go to the games yourself?   Really.  Marty wants to play ice <br/>
hockey again this coming year.  We bought him skates on Saturday.   We went to <br/>
the rink and picked up the schedule.  He would be on the dregs team (our term, <br/>
not theirs) for being a homeschooler, with kids from high schools not big <br/>
enough to have a team, but that&#39;s fine.  But if he does play, I intend to solicit <br/>
hockey-fan friends of ours to go and cheer him on.  I do NOT want to watch <br/>
him play.  I watched him when he was 8/9 and it was not easy.  His dad was in <br/>
Minneapolis working and so I was the one to take him to games.  I care SO much <br/>
more about Marty&#39;s safety and his pretty face than I do about hockey.  It&#39;s so <br/>
stressful for me that I&#39;m a detriment.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think maybe if watching the games makes you a bundle of motherly <br/>
frustration that you could just go shopping during games or maybe stay home and <br/>
cook him his very favorite foods so when he gets home he can tell you the good <br/>
parts of the game without you editorializing what he says because you saw what <br/>
one of the other dads looked like or heard what one of the moms said?  It seems <br/>
like what&#39;s smallish to him is huge to you, perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
There are options, though.  Maybe you don&#39;t have to be at every game.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We had a similar experience this past fall with<br/>
volleyball.  Sarah was playing on a private school&#39;s<br/>
team.  The year before the emphasis had been on fun,<br/>
gaining experience, and team work.  It was the first<br/>
year the school had a team.<br/>
<br/>
This year it was on winning.  <br/>
<br/>
The coach asked the girls if winning was important and<br/>
if she should play them all equally or put the best<br/>
players in to win.<br/>
<br/>
Of course the girls all said to play the best players,<br/>
because who wants to be accused of causing the team to<br/>
lose and disappoint everyone else, just because of<br/>
their &quot;selfish&quot; desire to play?  Sheesh...<br/>
<br/>
They were still expected to come to all the practices<br/>
though, and put in as much effort as the star players.<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

<br/>
If Howard Gardner&#39;s right (and why wouldn&#39;t he be? &lt;g&gt;) then there is an <br/>
intelligence that covers physical ability (kinesthetic).  More than one for sports <br/>
(kinesthetic, spatial, logical, interpersonal).<br/>
<br/>
Some kids WILL have more than others, whether they spend the whole game <br/>
playing or on the bench, whether they go to 40 practices or none.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the coaches&#39; kids are better because of genetics and opportunity.  <br/>
They were good before the dads decided to coach, probably, rather than the <br/>
other way around.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;However, that the team(s) are<br/>
<br/>
associated with the church may give you room to speak with the pastor<br/>
<br/>
about your premise and theirs, and s/he may have some perspective on<br/>
<br/>
the whole thing, as well.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Still, though, if the majority of the kids are enjoying it, it wouldn&#39;t make <br/>
sense to change the system for one or two kids.<br/>
<br/>
Very cool story, Jen.  I&#39;d want to work with him too!<br/>

The other day I was watching &quot;The Apprentice&quot; (the &quot;reality&quot; show<br/>
<br/>
where D. Trump is &quot;interviewing&quot; for someone to run one of his<br/>
<br/>
companies for a year).  A fellow named Bowie was chucked (I think<br/>
<br/>
because he waffled on his answer of who was the worst player), but in<br/>
<br/>
his cab ride of shame, instead of insulting Trump, the other players,<br/>
<br/>
or the process, he thanked Trump, the show, and his fellow players,<br/>
<br/>
and wished them the best.  If I had a company, I&#39;d have been calling<br/>
<br/>
the guy that night--there&#39;s one classy fellow.  (I&#39;m betting we *DO*<br/>
<br/>
see him hired on by a firm).-=-<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do agree and as 12yro is my 6th son I have seen a good many teams, I do <br/>
know how they work (or don&#39;t work for everyone as the case may be). I won&#39;t <br/>
pretend I like it at least in the younger age groups. I was always under the <br/>
impression that the younger teams were developmental teams which I took to mean &quot;we <br/>
are learning the game in a fun, safe environment for all&quot;. I learned long ago <br/>
that while I may come across a good team/coach just as I came across good <br/>
caring teachers when my kids were in school that I shouldn&#39;t come to expect that <br/>
as the norm cause it just wasn&#39;t so. It has been my experience for the most <br/>
part that as one thing you mentioned &quot;They are in it to win&quot;, the kids feelings <br/>
be damned.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;And part of your complaint is the overinvolvement of parents.  Don&#39;t become <br/>
one&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t intend to which is why I wrote asking for help with perspective. I <br/>
did ask my DH to go in for picture day because I didn&#39;t feel up to going in and <br/>
making nice.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;If YOUR happiness depends on your son&#39;s happiness, that&#39;s co-dependency.  <br/>
You&#39;re not on the team.  You&#39;re not even on the team of coach-supporting, <br/>
kid-pushing moms, it doesn&#39;t sound like.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re freaking out on the side, will your son be trying to decide what to <br/>
<br/>
do based in part on whether it will make you happy?   That&#39;s too much <br/>
responsibility for him.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t give him my feelings. Last week he walked out at the end of the <br/>
game and did not want to go to the end of game coach huddle thing, we did not <br/>
force him, he was angry and upset and we just let him have that. I love that my <br/>
DH is very OK with who our kids are though he sees what I see.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<br/>
Maybe you can just tell him once a week or less &quot;You don&#39;t have to go if you <br/>
don&#39;t want to.&quot; But if the not going involves practices, that will cost him <br/>
at <br/>
games.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We did talk about it and I let the decision to go to practice or not be his, <br/>
I don&#39;t think he realized they would be punitive about it though. Now he <br/>
knows. <br/>
<br/>
Just talking it out or writing it out has helped I can pinpoint my problem, I <br/>
am just angry at the inconsistency and what I perceive as smugness on their <br/>
part in letting my son know &quot;the rules.&quot; As my mother would so aptly put it I <br/>
want to rip their masks off.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;How does your son feel?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I try hard not to give him my anger, that is too much to deal with. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I <br/>
If you really want to do anything, put it in writing.  Then you can polish it <br/>
<br/>
and say your whole piece without the coach interrupting or justifying.  Print <br/>
<br/>

he can&#39;t forget or misquote or ignore.   <br/>
<br/>
It probably won&#39;t help him, but it might help you.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good idea, yes, I admit this is all about me and my anger at them. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I <br/>
There are options, though.  Maybe you don&#39;t have to be at every game.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have skipped a couple of basketball games and I may have to sit out a few <br/>
baseball. In a way it is almost a sad thing to sit back from this and see how <br/>
important these sports are to these people. I feel sorry for their kids too <br/>
even if they seem to enjoy it. It is all done towards a goal, I am sure they are <br/>
looking to high school and the college scholarships and we are just not on <br/>
that track. It is hard when we are playing for different reasons. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>One thing I have truly enjoyed is watching one boy who is what I would call <br/>
just gifted in this game, I would bet he is good at other sports as well. What <br/>
I so much enjoyed in this kid is that he was not a starliner, he played well, <br/>
with grace and natural ability that can&#39;t be faked. He was also one of the <br/>
most generous kids on the team, while the coaches son rarely passed the ball to <br/>
my son this kid did not have the &quot;team&quot; mindset, he had not played with this <br/>
particular group of boys before so he didn&#39;t have the &quot;game  plan&quot; so to speak <br/>
in his mind, in other words he did not know my son&#39;s &quot;place&quot; on the team and <br/>
consistantly passed my son the ball, which allowed my son in one game to make an <br/>
excellent play, a lay-up which he would have never been allowed to try <br/>
normally. It was one of those rare moments.<br/>
<br/>
I just thought of another thing that I realize has been working on me. It&#39;s <br/>
how whenever my son would do something good the coach moms would always make <br/>
sure to tell me what a good job he did. They don&#39;t reassure each other when <br/>
their boys do something good. I guess that has always made me feel singled out as <br/>
though my son doing something good was really something to shout about. Just <br/>
odd things that stick in ones crawl.I think these are also things that are <br/>
affecting the way I feel. (I would never have said to the one coach mom, It&#39;s so <br/>
good to see K make it through the game this week w/o falling apart, he must be <br/>
maturing, you must be proud.)<br/>

<br/>
&lt;You may want to have some conversations with your kid along the lines<br/>
of what you consider important (being part of the team, giving 100%<br/>
even if you&#39;re only called .05% of the time, practicing to become a<br/>
better player, the value of sportsmanship). &gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have had this conversation before and we just had it again. I don&#39;t care <br/>
if you play or not but if you play here are the rules of the team. If you <br/>
choose not to follow them all, or not all of the time then you need to understand <br/>
what the consequences are. <br/>

He did not want to go do the team picture Sunday because he was still mad but <br/>
I explained that the baseball team is made up of the same kids and a mix of <br/>
the same coaches and they will not forget if you mess up their team picture. I <br/>
let it be his choice whether to go or not but made sure he understood that <br/>
there might be repercussions. He decided to go...with dad, LOL<br/>

There are options, though.  Maybe you don&#39;t have to be at every game.<br/>

Sandra<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve coached lots of teams, my children have played on lots more.  I&#39;ve seen <br/>
the faces and heard the words of the kids who have parents who do NOT come to <br/>
their games.  I&#39;d ask my child if it was important to them that I be at their <br/>
games.  Most times it is very important to them.<br/>
<br/>
My 19 year old has played on teams since he was three, every year, every <br/>
season.  When he gets angry at me and wants to throw something at me to &quot;prove&quot; <br/>
I&#39;ve been a neglectful mother in some way, he will still say, remember those two <br/>
times you didn&#39;t come to my games?  I&#39;ll remind him it was only one game I&#39;ve <br/>
missed in sixteen years. He&#39;ll remind me the game I sat in the car and <br/>
watched in the freezing rain the day I was released from the hospital after giving <br/>
birth counts as NOT being at the game because he couldn&#39;t see or hear me, <br/>
although I could see him play.<br/>
<br/>
The other game I missed, I was in the middle of giving birth, no chance I <br/>
could be there.  Sometimes it&#39;s VERY important to them.  He rarely remembers I <br/>
rescheduled surgery three times one spring so I could see his play off games <br/>
when he had pro scouts watching him pitch.  It&#39;s the times that I wasn&#39;t there <br/>
that stick out most in his mind.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry it hurts him so much to remember me not being there. <br/>
<br/>
 I definitely would ask.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and many times it IS hard to watch as a mother, but I do it because I <br/>
love him and it&#39;s important to him.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that it&#39;s up to a coach to find a way to win games including the <br/>
team.  If one or two players playing part of a ballgame of any kind cause you <br/>
to not win, then as a coach you aren&#39;t really coaching very well, in my <br/>
opinion.  You win as a team, you loose as a team, but I know it doesn&#39;t always work <br/>
out that way, I&#39;m sorry for those children the coach has less faith in.  They <br/>
surprise you most sometimes I think.  Great heart always wins with me over <br/>
great talent with attitude...<br/>
<br/>
If you did talk to the coach, maybe mentioning very calmly that your child <br/>
would be so lifted up by getting in the game a little more and he feels he <br/>
really needs to contribute to the team more than he currently is doing.  I&#39;d leave <br/>
it at that.  Make it seem like it&#39;s all about your child, not the coach&#39;s <br/>
coaching style.  After all isn&#39;t it supposed to be about the KIDS anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck with this situation.<br/>

I feel sorry for their kids too <br/>
even if they seem to enjoy it. It is all done towards a goal, I am sure they <br/>

Laura<br/>

<br/>
Laura,<br/>
<br/>
One thing did come to mind as I read and re-read your post.  Being on <br/>
different tracks.  For some kids it is their ultimate dream to play some pro sport.  <br/>
They never miss a practice, they work at home, they read books, heck some <br/>
sleep with their baseball glove or a football or whatever.  It&#39;s their dream.  <br/>
They see it on TV or wherever and they WANT it for themselves.  Some parents work <br/>
hard to help their child achieve whatever dreams they have.  Buying expensive <br/>
equipment (did you know some baseball bats are $500.00?), driving them to and <br/>
from practice, making arrangements to be at games.  Whatever they can think <br/>
of to support their son or daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Other parents have children that just want to play a sport.  Just for the fun <br/>
of it, just to be a part of a team and around other children.  They have no <br/>
intense desire to make it a life long goal of achievement, they know this, <br/>
their parents know this.  They play on a different level.  Practice really isn&#39;t <br/>
that important to them, because the &quot;game&quot; (as in general not as in one <br/>
particular day of seven innings or whatever), it&#39;s just a PART of what makes them <br/>
happy and who they are.<br/>
<br/>
So two children and two (or four or six) parents come to the same game with <br/>
the same coaches with completely different agendas.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally if a child misses practice, they sit, no matter who.  Even the <br/>
&quot;star&quot; would sit the first half or first innings.  As a coach, you recognize that <br/>
everyone has other &quot;stuff&quot; to do, some make practice a priority and some <br/>
don&#39;t.  The one&#39;s who do, obviously want to play.  Now if there is a funeral or <br/>
wedding or something other than then child just choosing to not come, that&#39;s <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
I still believe that every child who commits to being on a team should be <br/>
treated as a team member and be given playing time.  Should every child get the <br/>
exact same number of innings/quarters?  I firmly believe that in the younger <br/>
ages, maybe nine and younger that should be true.  Most often around here that&#39;s <br/>
how it goes.  Everyone plays the same number of innings/quarters, for the <br/>
most part.  If you miss practice however, that means you sit, regardless.  The <br/>
older teams don&#39;t do that fairness, number of innings thing, they do sit you if <br/>
you don&#39;t practice.<br/>
<br/>
Should they base playing time on ability?  Maybe dedication to the team?  <br/>
Maybe who&#39;s dad coaches?  Most likely it&#39;s going to be based on putting the best <br/>
nine or five or twelve on the field to win the game.  But in any given game, <br/>
in any given play, ANY child should be able to be considered one of the best, <br/>
five, nine or twelve on the field/court.<br/>
<br/>
I have always respected the child that comes to me personally and told me <br/>
they felt they could do more to help the team out, by being on the field more, <br/>
playing more innings and were willing to do whatever it took to get into the <br/>
game more.  I&#39;ve never much been affected by the parent who comes to me with the <br/>
same concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe have your son approach the coach and tell him he&#39;s wants to step up his <br/>
play to the next level, to play more and sit less and what could he do to <br/>
accomplish that goal?<br/>
<br/>
I hope your son has a great time with basketball AND baseball, my very <br/>
favorite sport!<br/>

Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] A cry for perspective....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;        I am not sure this would fall under any unschooling topic but I<br/>
hope a<br/>
&gt; few of you can offer me a few options on how I might handle this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am angry, I was hoping that it would pass but it is not. My 12yro plays<br/>
&gt; basketball on our church team, he has played different sports with the<br/>
same kids<br/>
&gt; (and coaches) for the last several years. He likes to participate and has<br/>
&gt; always been very happy with being a team player. I have let a number of<br/>
issues<br/>
&gt; pass because he has not had a problem I have. As in most organizations<br/>
there are<br/>
&gt; a few fathers that always coach, they have the time and the interest and<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; observation I can see how their kids perform is very important to them.<br/>
The<br/>
&gt; mothers are exactly the same, they know every sport intimately and can get<br/>
quite<br/>
&gt; riled though they keep it within acceptable (so they don&#39;t get thrown out<br/>
&gt; acceptable) limits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Except for volleyball which has a mother coaching who is wonderful and<br/>
fair<br/>
&gt; my son sits out a good bit. He is a good player but I guess he is not a<br/>
&quot;star&quot;<br/>
&gt; player. (I also think how the coach plays a player and the message he<br/>
sends<br/>
&gt; affects a persons playing, we live up or down to others expectations but<br/>
that is<br/>
&gt; another post)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Both coaches sons are &quot;star&quot; players, there are a number of very good<br/>
players<br/>
&gt; on the team. My son missed both practices last week and was therefore<br/>
&gt; relegated to playing just a few minutes of one quarter. It was never put<br/>
into words<br/>
&gt; but a comment made at team picture day Sunday confirmed what we already<br/>
&gt; thought, sitting out longer than usual was a punitive measure. What really<br/>
hurt was<br/>
&gt; that one of our older boys came and also one of my son&#39;s friends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is getting wordy, please bear with me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am having a real problem with all of this because even if my son went to<br/>
&gt; both practices he only ever gets to play a quarter at most. I might even<br/>
be able<br/>
&gt; to swallow that had I not witnessed this. The assistant Coaches son has a<br/>
&gt; hard time staying calm, when he is getting stressed because they are<br/>
behind or he<br/>
&gt; has made a mistake he does something so that he can act like he is injured<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; he can go sit down and cry, when he is finished crying he wants right back<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the game. I watched a few weeks ago this whole scenario and watched him<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; back up and say something to his father who right away reached over (they<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; having a time out) and tap my son on the shoulder, my son&#39;s face dropped,<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; too knew what was going on. This happend every time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I watched it happen again this week with a different kid since my son was<br/>
&gt; benched anyhow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My DH thinks I should let it go, I am gagging on it. I do not want to call<br/>
&gt; and scream at them, I want to call and explain how this all looks from<br/>
another<br/>
&gt; POV.  My son has signed up to play baseball with pretty much the same<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; and I am trying to find a way to get through this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Help!<br/>

<br/>
I refused to suck it up. ALL the parents were sitting on the sidelines <br/>
(baseball) and bitching all through the games and practices about what a jerk he was <br/>
and what an awful coach. Of course they said nothing.<br/>
<br/>
First I went through all the &quot;chains of command&quot;: I talked (sweetly! I *AM* <br/>
Southern, ya&#39; know!) to the coach. Then to the next guy up, the next, and the <br/>
next. Finally I was at the top of the pile, and still nothing was being <br/>
done---although each said he would talk to the coach and work it out. Eventually I <br/>
started yelling on the sidelines. <br/>
<br/>
The final straw came when he scheduled an extra &quot;optional&quot; practice on a <br/>
Saturday afternoon. June in Columbia! Guys, it&#39;s HOT! They practiced from <br/>
12:00-3:00 with ONE water break----and then had a game at 4:00. (This jerk sat in the <br/>
shade, yelling the whole time---showing NO respect to these kids). THEN he got <br/>
mad when they weren&#39;t hustling at the game from 4:00 to 6:00.<br/>
<br/>
The jerk actually told my husband that Ben needed to get control over ME! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
Well, that didn&#39;t go over too well. Ben told him that if he had a problem <br/>
with me, that HE needed to deal with me himself, if he&#39;s man enough. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cameron liked baseball until this coach. Cameron (and all the other boys on <br/>
the team) were glad that I was standing up for them because they had no other <br/>
options. THEY couldn&#39;t; their parents wouldn&#39;t. Sad. I actually got cheers from <br/>
the kids! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At one of his stupid practices, Cameron shattered his index finger----broke <br/>
it into four-five pieces. Three pins to repair it. He was out the second half <br/>
of the season.<br/>
<br/>
This idiot actually had the gall to call me the next year to try to get me to <br/>
have Cameron play for him again, &quot;I&#39;ll let bygones be bygones...&quot; crap. I <br/>
flat out told him he was a horrible coach, a horrible person, and that he should <br/>
never be allowed near any children EVER. I followed it up with a letter to the <br/>
Park & Recs about how horrible he was and about how I wasn&#39;t listened to all <br/>
season.<br/>
<br/>
Which leads me to now! &lt;g&gt; Duncan wants to play baseball this spring! UGH!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-634999716">One good sport to try is swimming...although I&#39;m sure that can have some of the same problems, depending on the coach.<br/>
<br/>
We have found that even if our kids aren&#39;t swimming live heats, they can improve their own times, which is a success in and of itself.  Its both an individual sport and a team sport.<br/>
<br/>
I had my daughter on a soccer team.  It was AWFUL.  The coach was very &quot;win&quot; oriented and was rude to the kids.  Some of the parents were worse than the coach.  I hated it.  My daughter hated it, and we quit.<br/>
<br/>
We are trying cheerleading next.  I&#39;m hoping that this cheering squad is what its portrayed to be:  inclusive and non-competitive.  They do actually compete in the fall, but not in the spring.  Spring is mostly for learning.  So, I hope it works out.<br/>

  This is one reason I have never put my son in sports! This stuff happens all the time, and I just don&#39;t want to deal with it. I hope you figure this out, and soon! Good luck!<br/>

    Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] A cry for perspective....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
           I am not sure this would fall under any unschooling topic but I hope a <br/>
    few of you can offer me a few options on how I might handle this.<br/>
<br/>
    I am angry, I was hoping that it would pass but it is not. My 12yro plays <br/>
    basketball on our church team, he has played different sports with the same kids <br/>
    (and coaches) for the last several years. He likes to participate and has <br/>
    always been very happy with being a team player. I have let a number of issues <br/>
    pass because he has not had a problem I have. As in most organizations there are <br/>
    a few fathers that always coach, they have the time and the interest and from <br/>
    observation I can see how their kids perform is very important to them. The <br/>
    mothers are exactly the same, they know every sport intimately and can get quite <br/>
    riled though they keep it within acceptable (so they don&#39;t get thrown out <br/>
    acceptable) limits. <br/>
<br/>
    Except for volleyball which has a mother coaching who is wonderful and fair <br/>
    my son sits out a good bit. He is a good player but I guess he is not a &quot;star&quot; <br/>
    player. (I also think how the coach plays a player and the message he sends <br/>
    affects a persons playing, we live up or down to others expectations but that is <br/>
    another post)<br/>
<br/>
    Both coaches sons are &quot;star&quot; players, there are a number of very good players <br/>
    on the team. My son missed both practices last week and was therefore <br/>
    relegated to playing just a few minutes of one quarter. It was never put into words <br/>
    but a comment made at team picture day Sunday confirmed what we already <br/>
    thought, sitting out longer than usual was a punitive measure. What really hurt was <br/>
    that one of our older boys came and also one of my son&#39;s friends. <br/>
<br/>
    This is getting wordy, please bear with me. <br/>
<br/>
    I am having a real problem with all of this because even if my son went to <br/>
    both practices he only ever gets to play a quarter at most. I might even be able <br/>
    to swallow that had I not witnessed this. The assistant Coaches son has a <br/>
    hard time staying calm, when he is getting stressed because they are behind or he <br/>
    has made a mistake he does something so that he can act like he is injured so <br/>
    he can go sit down and cry, when he is finished crying he wants right back in <br/>
    the game. I watched a few weeks ago this whole scenario and watched him get <br/>
    back up and say something to his father who right away reached over (they were <br/>
    having a time out) and tap my son on the shoulder, my son&#39;s face dropped, he <br/>
    too knew what was going on. This happend every time.<br/>
<br/>
    I watched it happen again this week with a different kid since my son was <br/>
    benched anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
    My DH thinks I should let it go, I am gagging on it. I do not want to call <br/>
    and scream at them, I want to call and explain how this all looks from another <br/>
    POV.  My son has signed up to play baseball with pretty much the same people <br/>
    and I am trying to find a way to get through this. <br/>
<br/>
    Should I call the coach about the inconsistencies I see or should I let it <br/>
    go? If I should let it go I need to find a way to look at the situation that <br/>
    does now appall me.<br/>
    Help!<br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time> 3 Feb 2004, at  2:52pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295017806">I actually got cheers from <br/>
the kids! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This happened to me too one day when all the kids were standing in a long long line to get refreshments at the pool.  It was an &quot;adult only&quot; swim break and the concession stand only opened ONE window even though there were 3 girls working in there.<br/>
<br/>
As one little boy bought his treat, he left and didn&#39;t take his change.  I was right behind him when the girl behind the counter (probably about 14 or 15) said &quot;stupid kid&quot;.  That was IT.  I told her &quot;he is NOT stupid, he is YOUNG&quot;, and then went on to why don&#39;t they open both windows instead of making these kids wait forever, it is hot after all.  I also told them they could not count change to save their lives and that I was going to call the manager, which I did.<br/>
<br/>
All the kids behind me were cheering LOL.<br/>
<br/>
It was worth every single second of looking like a bitch/mama.  LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am fully aware of that, I also fill volunteer positions in life.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Second, I would remember that lots of coaches&#39; kids are star players.  Not<br/>
necessarily because the coach is unfair but because the parent is a coach as<br/>
a way of supporting their kids&#39; interest in that sport.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I also understand this, however, in taking the position he agreed to coach <br/>
all of the kids on the team. We also try to do our part whenever we can, we paid <br/>
for the team party last year and we help out when we are needed. We attend <br/>
all of the games also while a good many of the parents don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Third, I would ask my son how he feels about what is going on before I poked<br/>
my nose in it.  After all, it is about him right?  Not about your sense of<br/>
fairness.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Which is exactly why I have not done anything up to this point. I have been <br/>
thinking on it a long time. I don&#39;t usually act rashly, this is no exception. <br/>
What I was asking for in part was a way to look at this differently in order to <br/>
find a way to live with it so that I can go on supporting my son. I also <br/>
vented a bit and feel better for having done so, thanks for letting me.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Fourth, I would volunteer to coach next year.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LOL, that would be hilarious! I assure you they would not have me, I am <br/>
basketball impaired, it would be an interesting proposition though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s why I&#39;ve enjoyed SO MUCH watching the videos of Tony Hawk&#39;s <br/>
Gigantic Skate Park Tour and reading about his life. Talk about an <br/>
amazingly gifted guy who can be competitive and generous all at the <br/>
same time. He&#39;s the &quot;king&quot; but the guys of extreme sports are all a <br/>
very different kind of athlete. They&#39;ll compete against each other to <br/>
later get together as teams. They&#39;ll cheer each other even after being <br/>
beaten out of a medal. It&#39;s really just lovely to see the dynamics <br/>
between these guys. Another good video is the 2000 X Games (it has the <br/>
event that propelled Tony Hawk into god-like status).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868590859">***When he gets angry at me and wants to throw something at me to &quot;prove&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a neglectful mother in some way, he will still say, remember<br/>
those two <br/>
times you didn&#39;t come to my games?***<br/>
<br/>
This seems strange. <br/>
I realize you haven&#39;t always been unschoolers but this strikes me as<br/>
manipulative and unhealthy.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend whose really terrible childhood has affected every part<br/>
of her life including, sadly, her parenting.   In her mind her children&#39;s<br/>
love for her is directly related to their performance.  If one of them<br/>
does poorly in school, gets in trouble, doesn&#39;t want to do the dishes<br/>
when she asks, she feels they don&#39;t love her.   She&#39;s used this<br/>
manipulation on them until they&#39;ve learned to use it on her.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a strange and unhealthy thing.  <br/>
<br/>
Little kids like their parents around, but big kids who love sports want<br/>
to play whether their parents can come or not.   Why wouldn&#39;t a kid<br/>
understand if a parent couldn&#39;t be there once or twice?   Punishment and<br/>
guilt and manipulation are learned.   This post disturbs me. <br/>
<br/>
***He&#39;ll remind me the game I sat in the car and <br/>
watched in the freezing rain the day I was released from the hospital<br/>
after giving <br/>
birth counts as NOT being at the game because he couldn&#39;t see or hear me,<br/>
<br/>
although I could see him play. ***<br/>
<br/>
Why would he do this to you?  What kind of relationship allows for<br/>
unhealthy grudge holding and guilty manipulation.  <br/>
<br/>
***The other game I missed, I was in the middle of giving birth, no<br/>
chance I <br/>
could be there. ***<br/>
<br/>
And he guilts you about it?   <br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;m sorry it hurts him so much to remember me not being there.***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m having a hard time believing this whole thing.  He was<br/>
totally unable to understand two day&#39;s you missed in his entire career in<br/>
kid sports?  <br/>
<br/>
I went to Dylan&#39;s martial arts classes until he was comfortable there,<br/>
and because I liked to be there.  By the time he was nine he wanted to be<br/>
there and was so busy and involved there he would have been fine without<br/>
me.   There is no insecurity in him, no belief that my absence from his<br/>
class would in any way be related to how much I love him.   He&#39;d think me<br/>
a more than a little strange if I hated to sit there but did it anyway<br/>
and made sure I told him it was because I loved him.   That would be<br/>
manipulative and warped and he understands that right now and would have<br/>
four years ago, too. <br/>

&lt;&lt;  I&#39;d ask my child if it was important to them that I be at their <br/>
games.  Most times it is very important to them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but if the mom is so upset she can&#39;t be helpful, useful and supportive, <br/>
it might be better for her not to go.<br/>
<br/>
If a child wants a mom to do something and it&#39;s not something the mother can <br/>
in good conscience do or support, the kid might be better off with the dad <br/>
there than the mom.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s the times that I wasn&#39;t there <br/>
that stick out most in his mind.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I&#39;m sorry it hurts him so much to remember me not being there. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds totally unreasonable to me.  He should get over it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Oh, and many times it IS hard to watch as a mother, but I do it because I <br/>
love him and it&#39;s important to him.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It seems perhaps you&#39;re saying that a mother who doesn&#39;t go to every game, or <br/>
at least sit in the car the day after giving birth, doesn&#39;t love her children <br/>
and doesn&#39;t care what&#39;s important to thim.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s at all true.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;m sorry for those children the coach has less faith in. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Faith is based on something real, like ability and trust.  It doesn&#39;t make <br/>
sense to expect a coach to have equal faith in every child.<br/>

<br/>
 We just looked at each other and I wrote it down on the envelope I keep my <br/>

control the change (by somehow making people behave the way we want them<br/>
to.)<br/>
<br/>
Help your son see what choices he does have rather than being upset with<br/>
things that are beyond his control. He can choose not to play volleyball. He<br/>
could find some other team. He could put up with the &quot;rain&quot; and enjoy<br/>
himself despite the weather.<br/>

<br/>
If he didn&#39;t apprecitate the 2000 gifts I&#39;d given and resented the 2 times<br/>
he hadn&#39;t gotten a gift, he needed to do some serious thinking. And since I<br/>
now knew how he saw my gifts, I would be getting less enjoyment out of<br/>
giving them and he&#39;d be getting them less frequently.<br/>

Or the father regularly uses this with the mother. Or the child has heard this at school or in friends&#39; houses and has learned what a great tool it can be to get his own way. Schools and daycares are filled with &quot;If you don&#39;t do x, then I won&#39;t be your friend anymore&quot; or &quot;If you do x, I&#39;ll be your best friend.&quot; Not a big leap to &quot;If you love me, then you&#39;ll do x.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Definitely a learned behavior, but the mother&#39;s not the only plausible source.  Definitely disturbing no matter what the source.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
You are right, it&#39;s not healthy I am sure.  I suppose maybe he does feel it&#39;s <br/>
something he&#39;s entitled to, my presence at things that are important to him.  <br/>
I&#39;ve always done it with ease and with great pleasure.  I did miss basketball <br/>
games once when I was in the hospital but he doesn&#39;t care at all about those <br/>
apparently.  Just the baseball games.  Guess they are more important to him.<br/>
<br/>
I think I know he will say the things about the two games in anger because he <br/>
knows that I always take a breath to know that I did pain him by not being <br/>
there.  <br/>
<br/>
My older daughter and DH always say to me, well if that is the WORST thing he <br/>
can say about you when he&#39;s angry, then you should just consider that you&#39;ve <br/>
been a wonderful mother to him!<br/>
<br/>
I have rearranged every step of my life for motherhood.  Something I really <br/>
never thought I wanted until I had it.  I didn&#39;t want to miss a second of it, <br/>
especially since I know it can be taken from you in a blink of an eye.<br/>
<br/>
A doctor did once tell me when this same son was seven months old that it <br/>
wasn&#39;t &quot;healthy&quot; for him to be so attached to me.  What if I did, the child would <br/>
go crazy with grief.  I think he&#39;d have been more resilient than that if he <br/>
had to be, but I&#39;m glad I could be there with him every single second.<br/>
<br/>
Some of my greatest joys in life are seeing that very same young man stand on <br/>
the pitchers mound, roll that baseball around in his hand, I see the finger <br/>
placement, I see the grip, I see his mind counting the stitches, I see him <br/>
bring his glove to his chest, I see him lift his leg, I see him  bend his back and <br/>
point his toe towards the heavens and I hear the ball whiz right by the <br/>
batter who wonders where it came from, I see the joy in my son&#39;s face.  I love that <br/>
boy.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s right, I wish I hadn&#39;t missed ANY of his games.  Who wants to miss a <br/>
second of seeing their child&#39;s dream happen and come to life?  But life happens, <br/>
and sometimes you miss a bit or two or even more and then one morning you <br/>
bring your child juice into his room and there is a grown man laying in his bed <br/>
and you wonder how did THIS happen?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is great, it affords you almost ALL those moments in between.  <br/>

It seems perhaps you&#39;re saying that a mother who doesn&#39;t go to every game, or <br/>
at least sit in the car the day after giving birth, doesn&#39;t love her children <br/>
and doesn&#39;t care what&#39;s important to thim.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s at all true<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not true at all.  There are many reasons parents can&#39;t be at games.  <br/>
I&#39;ve missed games.  Sometimes it can&#39;t be helped.  I also know some children <br/>
who REALLY don&#39;t want their parents at their games.  It&#39;s THEIR time.  I know <br/>
some children who cry because they mom or dad SAID they would be there and <br/>
didn&#39;t show up.<br/>
<br/>
For some children sports are just another part of many things they do, it&#39;s <br/>
not that important, or at least not one of the top important things in their <br/>
lives.  To some children it is very important and they want to share it with <br/>
their parents.<br/>
<br/>
I think a parent is the best judge of their own child.  I certainly do not <br/>
believe that if a parent misses a child&#39;s baseball or football game or whatever <br/>
event that the parent doesn&#39;t love their children or care what&#39;s important to <br/>
them.  The way my son uses that as a weapon when he&#39;s angry would seem to <br/>
indicate that he feels I let him down or missed out on something really important <br/>
in his childhood those two days.  Those two days stick out in his mind vividly.<br/>
<br/>
I think I will ask him today what happened on those days besides me not <br/>
&quot;seeing&quot; him play.  Even though I got play by plays at the time from him.  Maybe <br/>
there is more he&#39;d like to tell me.  He does seemed pained by this and he is 19, <br/>
there must be something more than me just missing the game.<br/>

He&#39;d think me<br/>
a more than a little strange if I hated to sit there but did it anyway<br/>
and made sure I told him it was because I loved him.   That would be<br/>
manipulative and warped and he understands that right now and would have<br/>
four years ago, too. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First, I didn&#39;t HATE to be there.  I LOVE watching my son doing something he <br/>
absolutely loves.  He knows this.  I didn&#39;t sit at practices which I&#39;m <br/>
guessing would be like the Martial Art classes.  I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t miss one of <br/>
his meets(?) if you could help it, if it was important to your son.  Even if you <br/>
did, he might not be the one that remembers you not being there years later.  <br/>
Maybe because to my son, baseball is his passion.  He&#39;s been pretty much one <br/>
tracked about that since, I guess before he was three. <br/>
<br/>
My other children have a variety of things they do.  John has played <br/>
basketball but he never really cared much if I was there or not, it just wasn&#39;t <br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think in his mind it was about where I was or why, to him I just wasn&#39;<br/>
t there.  It isn&#39;t about manipulation at all.  He&#39;s not trying to manipulate <br/>
anything.  In the heat of anger he&#39;s thinking of something to say to hurt me <br/>
or let me know he&#39;s really angry.  He used to RAGE when he was little.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t do that so much anymore, if at all.<br/>
<br/>
Some children just scream out &quot;I HATE YOU&quot;, to their parent.  I know I wanted <br/>
to say it to my parents when I was young.  Some say other things when they <br/>
are angry, some say nothing and sulk.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that if he tried really hard he could come up with lots of <br/>
things other than missing baseball games that have hurt him. I think to him it&#39;s a <br/>
symbol of sorts to say this thing to me.  I know he&#39;s needing more of my <br/>
attention and that I need to stop and really hear him.  Sometimes when are children <br/>
are nearly grown (he&#39;s 19) and fairly independent and yet he still needs to <br/>
feel connected at a basic level, sometimes more than others.  The basics of <br/>
growing up and pulling away and then learning to come back.  He hasn&#39;t had that <br/>
&quot;going away&quot; part yet.  He still lives at home and goes to Community College. <br/>
<br/>
Saying I missed two baseball games is really about a lot more than just <br/>
baseball games.  If we were having just a regular conversation he would find it <br/>
just as irrational as most everyone here does.  Most times these days it&#39;s about <br/>
I&#39;m really angry and I think I just need a hug and a good cry, a reconnection <br/>
of sorts.  Something 19 year old boys sometimes have a hard time expressing.<br/>
<br/>
I do appreciate all the comments I&#39;ve gotten from everyone.  I&#39;ve thought <br/>
about it a lot more than usual and while I KNOW it was never really about the <br/>
missed games, today I&#39;m going to ask him about those two games and what he <br/>
remembers about those days (besides me not being there) and really HEAR about them.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

<br/>
One thing our Little League does around here that I like, is that they have<br/>
2 seasons.  Fall Ball is super fair, little pressure to perform to a<br/>
standard, just everybody learn and have fun.....The coaches think of it as<br/>
an instructional league.<br/>
<br/>
Spring Ball is Little League in all its glory and gore, everybody plays but<br/>
some may only play an inning.  You miss practice, you sit.  You goof around<br/>
, you sit, .....those kinds of things.<br/>
<br/>
Then we also have what we call competitive teams.  These are the kids that<br/>
LIVE baseball.  They travel to different towns, many have batting cages at<br/>
their homes, etc..<br/>
<br/>
This way people can choose their track.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds pretty normal to me. Kids who are the better players get to <br/>
play more on competitive sports teams.<br/>
<br/>
If he played recreational AYSO soccer, they&#39;d always let him play half <br/>
the game (and probably 3/4 of the game). That&#39;s a rule and the motto of <br/>
the organization, &quot;Everyone plays.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But the reason they HAVE that rule and that motto is in response to <br/>
other sports organizations where that is pretty much never true.<br/>
<br/>
And sitting out more because he missed that week&#39;s practices is also <br/>
normal. I think if you think of this from the point of view of the <br/>
coach who can&#39;t &quot;coach&quot; kids who aren&#39;t at practice, that it&#39;ll make <br/>
sense to you that kids who come to games but not practices shouldn&#39;t <br/>
get as much play time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry that the coach favors his own kid, but sometimes there are <br/>
things you don&#39;t know. For example, isn&#39;t it nice that he&#39;s letting his <br/>
kid have a chance to cry in private? I&#39;m always happy to see a coach be <br/>
KIND to a kid, not think the kid needs to &quot;get tough.&quot; And that he <br/>
pulls the weaker players in and out as subs when his kid needs to get <br/>
out for a few minutes, to cry or recover his composure, makes perfect <br/>
sense to me. That&#39;s how sports are - stronger players get more play <br/>
time, weaker players are used as subs.<br/>
<br/>
I would pull my kids off sports teams when the coach was too harsh, too <br/>
verbally insulting and my child was unhappy. I pulled my oldest <br/>
daughter off a soccer team once when the coach had them run around and <br/>
around a track before every practice and insulted my daughter <br/>
throughout the whole ordeal, yelling, &quot;Sorooshian, get your butt in <br/>
gear,&quot; and &quot;Sorooshian, they&#39;re lapping you AGAIN!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter was about 9 and kind of pudgy and NOT fast at running. She <br/>
was a really good soccer player and loved it, and was known as &#39;big <br/>
foot&#39; for her great kicks. This coach was under the impression that <br/>
making fun of her and humiliating her because she couldn&#39;t keep up when <br/>
the team was running would encourage her to run more and lose some <br/>
weight and become an even better player. What it did was make her <br/>
miserable enough to decide to quit playing soccer altogether.<br/>
<br/>
There are quite a few really bad coaches around, but I&#39;d be careful as <br/>
a mom, about making that call FOR my kid. You&#39;re talking about actual <br/>
coaching decisions and that ought to be left up to the coach, within <br/>
the rules of the organization. You didn&#39;t say he is being abusive in <br/>
any way, just letting stronger players play more and kids who miss <br/>
practice play less. That&#39;s absolutely normal for sports teams. Kids on <br/>
a team usually can totally accept that the strongest players play more <br/>
- they are usually very realistic about their own skills relative to <br/>
others on the team. In fact, isn&#39;t that part of learning from being on <br/>
a team - to contribute your part, to learn from those who have more <br/>
skills, etc?<br/>
<br/>
If you talk to the coach about this, I think you&#39;d be out of line and <br/>
you&#39;ll either be ignored or resented. Worst case is that some of that <br/>
resentment will be taken out on your child.<br/>
<br/>
ON the other hand, if you son is complaining that he wants to play <br/>
more, there is nothing wrong with HIM discussing that with the coach, <br/>
saying he is committed to the team and intends to show that by working <br/>
hard in practices (has to BE there to work hard) and that he hopes that <br/>
by showing that commitment to improving his skills that he&#39;ll get more <br/>
play time too. A coach would be much more inclined to respond <br/>
positively to that kind of approach than to a mom complaining that her <br/>
son isn&#39;t getting to play enough.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;d add to this, LISTEN to your husband when it comes to this <br/>
stuff. Dads sometimes have a much better grasp on the reality of sports <br/>
teams than moms do. (NOT always, I know....)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe to help yourself see things a bit differently, you need to list, <br/>
for yourself, the learning he gets from being on the team. It isn&#39;t all <br/>
about getting to play, I bet.<br/>
