<div id="ygrps-yiv-499091848"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dia if I interpret Trisha&#39;s  comments correctly, it may be a case of<br/>
&gt; canned fruit and other prepared foods etc sometimes being cheaper than<br/>
&gt; fresh but loaded with sugar. Diabetics have to control sugar and fat (to<br/>
&gt; keep caloric intake down ) in order to get adequate nutrition without<br/>
&gt; overloading their systems with refined sugars and risking diabetic<br/>
&gt; blackouts/comas.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am very familiar with diabetic needs as I am one of the few in my family<br/>
who does *not* have diabetes, my birth family that is, not my married<br/>
family.  Fresh fruit is a healthful option for diabetics, apples and bananas<br/>
must some times be avoided as they have high sugar contents, but not always.<br/>
When food is eaten has a lot to do with controlling diabetic problems.<br/>
Canned fruit is also available in sugar free form in grocery stores.  If it<br/>
is available where I live, it must be available most everywhere, since I am<br/>
in a small town.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of interesting new options for controlling diabetes, or even<br/>
preventing it.  Given my family history, it is something I take quite<br/>
seriously.<br/>
