are, does it?  The dentist can&#39;t change it, and when the teeth come in,<br/>
you&#39;ll know if they are crooked or problematic or whatever!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-535023821">Am I missing something? Beside the cost, What is the down side to a modern<br/>
dental X-ray? <br/>
<br/>
I guess it is like anything, you weigh the costs and the benefits. Life is a<br/>
risky endeavor and it seems to me, the dentist helps make it a more<br/>
comfortable, enjoyable journey.<br/>
<br/>
As I understand,<br/>
Benefits:<br/>
Dental X-rays are an important diagnostic tool for assessing your (or your<br/>
child&#39;s) oral health. They give your dentist detailed information about<br/>
possible gum, bone and tooth diseases, as well as seeing those hidden<br/>
cavities between the teeth. This seems like a wealth of information for a<br/>
small amount of radiation. And I mean small.<br/>
<br/>
Radiation:<br/>
A full set of dental X-rays, from 12 to 18 images from any machine made<br/>
after about 1966, (doses could have been massively higher before this time)<br/>
gives a radiation dose equal to environmental exposure of about a typical<br/>
day outdoors. These are the full set used for baseline comparisons,<br/>
typically given every 3-5 years. The four bitewing images that are<br/>
recommended every year or two are a fraction of that. The statistics say<br/>
that a set of bitewings will trigger a cancer or other abnormality every one<br/>
to ten million. You can&#39;t beat these odds getting up from your computer<br/>
chair.<br/>
<br/>
I hear of concerns about Hypothyroidism. These claims seem to stem from<br/>
radiation doses magnitudes higher than the present day machines. I can&#39;t<br/>
find any solid evidence or tested studies of these claims.<br/>
<br/>
None of this supercedes finding a dentist (or any healthcare professional)<br/>
that you can talk to openly and honestly who will listen to your concerns<br/>
and develop a long term relationship with. If you can&#39;t talk honestly to<br/>
someone who will listen, keep looking.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen pictures of my ancestors and their teeth. It would be very<br/>
difficult to convince me that regular check ups and cleanings are not a<br/>
beneficial thing, helping me reach an enjoyable and comfortable old age.<br/>
