<div id="ygrps-yiv-687960175">Actually, both pronunciations are correct for &quot;cinco&quot;; it just depends on<br/>
where in the world you are. In Spain, &quot;c&quot; before &quot;i&quot; gets a distinct &quot;th&quot;<br/>
sound, whereas in Mexico and the Caribbean, it sounds more like an &quot;s.&quot;<br/>
Dictionaries will differ depending on where they are printed, although<br/>
Castillian Spanish (the Spanish spoken in Madrid, Spain) is supposed to be<br/>
the universally accepted dialect. But in the US, Spanish is more influenced<br/>
by the dialects in Puerto Rico, Cuba, Mexico, and other parts of Latin<br/>
America.<br/>
<br/>
Way more than you probably wanted to know, but I enjoy this topic so I&#39;ve<br/>
rattled on uncontrollably.<br/>
