 </span></blockquote>I am using a public charter home school program for<br/>
the first time this year. I personally have found it a<br/>
saving grace for me this year. I am a single parent<br/>
that has recently moved into a new community and I am<br/>
looking for work and not finding much available to do<br/>
from home. Therefore I am finding it a real struggle<br/>
to survive financially at the moment. The &quot;budget&quot; I<br/>
have been given has helped me to aquire the materials<br/>
that I would like to use to unschool my daughter in a<br/>
waldorfy manner.I have to say though, I&#39;m hoping that<br/>
I&#39;ll be in a better financial situation next year (or<br/>
sooner, I hope!) and then I will choose to take her<br/>
out of the program (mainly because I don&#39;t like the<br/>
testing thing). I don&#39;t feel as though I have been<br/>
&quot;sucked in&quot; and I also know that I am free to leave at<br/>
any time and file an R4 (in CA). Regardless of my<br/>
financial situation, if they started changing the<br/>
requirements (and giving me less freedom) I would pull<br/>
her out in a second! Also I belong to a great,<br/>
supportive homeschool group in my area that I found<br/>
through HSC. We are a very diverse group. Some of us<br/>
use public charter school programs, others use a<br/>
private homeschool program and yet others do the R4<br/>
thing. So I think there is room for everyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-880501362">They get paid for the test.  Now, what everyone up here is doing is the kids<br/>
are going to be &quot;ill&quot; that day.<br/>
<br/>
The new legislation as far as I have heard is going to ding the schools if<br/>
the kids don&#39;t do the test or take the make up test since the paying them<br/>
for the test hasn&#39;t really worked.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooled kids routinely score higher and they need those scores to raise<br/>
the average.<br/>
