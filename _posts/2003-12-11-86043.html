<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423637014">**It really only takes once to become terminally ill<br/>
with HIV or chronically ill with herpes or syphilis,<br/>
or even just very ill with the clap or yeast<br/>
infections.**<br/>
<br/>
Going off on a tangent here, but did anyone see Angels in America (part <br/>
1) on HBO on Sunday?  (Or previously on stage?)<br/>
<br/>
Very impressive and heartbreaking.<br/>
<br/>
Part 2 will be on this Sunday night, 8pm EST.<br/>
