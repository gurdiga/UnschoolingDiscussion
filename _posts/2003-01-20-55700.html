<div id="ygrps-yiv-758539281">Kelly, I had totally forgotten that part of growing up.  My folks<br/>
always said cow&#39;s milk is for baby cows, not baby people.  We<br/>
were nursed for about a year and after that liquids were free<br/>
rein.  My accommodating father, a doc, sent in a &quot;milk allergy&quot;<br/>
note.<br/>
<br/>
On the flip side when our 24 y.o. was a toddler we had to use day<br/>
care for a while.  I didn&#39;t know that he was intolerant of milk,<br/>
because he had never had cow&#39;s milk.  It actually took about 3<br/>
explosive episodes before I made the connection.  It was hard to<br/>
make the folks there believe me, but the &quot;both ends, with vigor&quot;<br/>
response was triggered within about an hour of drinking milk, so<br/>
any attempt to test Mom&#39;s opinion was promptly revealed and<br/>
almost as unpleasant for the day care as for the child.<br/>

| It&#39;s not a question of whether allergies actually exist.  It&#39;s<br/>
whether some<br/>

no allergy,<br/>
| &gt; just<br/>
| &gt; to control something in their world.<br/>
|<br/>
| In school, I was &quot;allergic&quot; to milk. I HATE milk. Always hated<br/>
it. So after<br/>
| seeing friends get away with all sorts of real allergies, I<br/>
made mine up. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
| To control MY world! &lt;GGG&gt; I wasn&#39;t &quot;made&quot; to drink milk at<br/>
home, but I WAS<br/>
| at school and at friends&#39; houses. BLECH! My &quot;allergy &quot;worked&quot;!<br/>
