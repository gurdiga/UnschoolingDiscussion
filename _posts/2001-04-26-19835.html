&gt;  I like spiders<br/>
&gt;outside eating bugs. When they&#39;re in my house I&#39;m not very friendly.<br/>

I&#39;m with you, Valerie - I don&#39;t like those critters in my house. So <br/>
I&#39;ve been wondering about those electronic bug deterrent devices. <br/>
Anyone have any experience with them? Do they really do what they <br/>
claim to do, which is keep all the creepy crawlies at bay? Apparently <br/>
some even work for rodents...<br/>
<br/>

I do not know about the insect one but my neighbors report that the rodent <br/>
one works. Insects are such a problem in the orchards and gardens too. <br/>
Sometimes having fresh veggies and fruit hardly seem worth it because of <br/>
them, but still I do it. Maybe I should get one of these items for the <br/>
garden!!<br/>
