<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>14 Feb 2003, at  4:08pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271086370">My thoughts and prayers to you Liza, and to you Janis on your dad&#39;s birthday.<br/>
<br/>
I am lucky enough to have both my parents.  But my husband lost both of his.  I didn&#39;t know his father.  But I miss his mother terribly.<br/>
<br/>
Take care of yourselves and be kind to yourselves,<br/>
<br/>
