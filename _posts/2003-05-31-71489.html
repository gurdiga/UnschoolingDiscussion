<div id="ygrps-yiv-11833051">WooHoo! I&#39;m 9 digest behind but I just can&#39;t let this go by without<br/>
comment. I just can&#39;t wait to meet and see you all. TOMORROW is June 1st!<br/>
    I don&#39;t even have to worry about my car braking down like I did last<br/>
year. We just bought a 2003 Ford Escape. I haven&#39;t had a new car in 25 yrs.<br/>
I&#39;m so.. phyched!<br/>
    Is anyone collecting the state quarters? I&#39;d be happy to trade and watch<br/>
for those others are having trouble finding. PA mint are easy to find here.<br/>
Denver mint more difficult.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Me!  Me!!  And I&#39;m missing all of the 2003 quarters at this point.  Would<br/>
you believe that we have an American bank on post (Community Bank, run by<br/>
Bank of America) but they never get the new quarters?  I&#39;ve been only trying<br/>
to just get one of each, forget trying to find the different mints.<br/>
<br/>
And as far as money goes, I&#39;ve offered this before, but if you&#39;re interested<br/>
in Euros, I will bring some to trade away.  If you have a complete set in<br/>
mind (1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 cent, 1 and 2 euro; worth about $4), email me in<br/>
advance of July 15 (I leave for America then) so I bring you a set.  I also<br/>
have a pretty good sized bag of cool but worthless European money - USSR,<br/>
East German, Yugoslavian, etc. - that my son was given by a coin dealer.<br/>
He&#39;s sorted out what he wants, so the rest is up for grabs.  Look for me in<br/>
SC if you&#39;re interested.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90816237">Hey Brenda,<br/>
<br/>
If there are no other takers, my kids would definitely be interested in <br/>
that bag of European money!  How do I find you?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You got it Brenda. I don&#39;t have any of these either. Some probably<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t been released yet. I&#39;ll save some for you too when I see them. The<br/>
&gt; boy like their coins we got from you. Thanks again. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Glad to hear they like them.  I&#39;ve been saving up for the conference; I have<br/>
lots of non-German euros now!  You&#39;ll have to come take a peek.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll see you in SC, with quarters.  Thanks much.  I&#39;m glad that I&#39;ll finally<br/>
get to meet you, since Columbus never happened!<br/>

<br/>
We should be able to pretty easily split the coins up between anyone who&#39;s<br/>
interested.  There&#39;s a LOT of coins, and many, many of them are duplicates.<br/>
I&#39;ll sort you out some before I leave, if I have time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be easy to find -- I&#39;ll be the one Kelly is running around like her<br/>
personal conference-slave!  (I&#39;m coming in early and hanging around in S.C.<br/>
for two weeks beforehand to see old friends, new friends, and hopefully be<br/>
reasonably useful to Kelly.)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll find each other.  Promise!<br/>
