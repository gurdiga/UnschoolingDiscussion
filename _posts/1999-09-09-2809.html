<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285982364">I have been on this list for about a week now and thought it was time I<br/>
introduced myself. My name is Cathy.  We have been homeschooling for 5<br/>
years now.  My son is 10 years old and loves the freedom of  homeschool.<br/>
We do not totally unschool but are working our way there.  Up until this<br/>
year we have had a lot of structure and it was not working.  He answered<br/>
the questions then promptly forgot because it was not anything he was<br/>
interested in.  We had been working on verbs, nouns, adverbs, ect. for<br/>
several years now, starting over every year because he would forget what he<br/>
knew.  This year we got a computer and several games for him to play<br/>
including several educational game.  One of the games required that he know<br/>
the several parts of speech in order to beat the game.  He learned them in<br/>
two days and beat the game.  Now as we are riding in the car he wants me to<br/>
make up sentences so he can tell me  the direct object or adverb or other<br/>
parts of speech.  <br/>
Anyway that is what really sold me on unshooling.  Thanks for all the good<br/>
advise and tips in the messages.  It has really help me to put things in to<br/>
perspective.<br/>
God Bless You <br/>

We live in central GA, way back in the country.  We are surrounded on 3<br/>
sides by wooded areas and the other by a large open field.  My son can get<br/>
out and play, whoop and holler all he wants and no one but his parents know<br/>
or care.  We have 3 dogs, several chickens and we raise quail.  We all love<br/>
the country life.  Just walking to our mail box and back is a nature walk.<br/>

absolutely loved to go to the country for Thanksgiving, my uncle lived on a <br/>
huge farm, with horses to ride, and a stream running thru, then up a slight <br/>
hill into the woods.  Heaven on earth!  I miss it and am so sorry that my <br/>
boys have to miss it too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-388074251">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
O.K., after that intense first post, I&#39;ve collected myself a bit and I&#39;ll<br/>
write a general quick intro :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Carolyn, mother to Annabel Hope, who is just 2, and wife to Erik.  We&#39;re<br/>
living in NC since February, when we moved from West Philadelphia to give<br/>
our daughter a better life.<br/>
<br/>
My background before I decided to stay home with Annie is in adult basic ed<br/>
(and before that, theatre and dramatic literature) and I&#39;ve fairly much<br/>
decided to offer Annie the best education I know how, which is IMO<br/>
learner-centered, participatory, and community-based.  Unschooling as I&#39;m<br/>
understanding it is very similar to what we did, in a group setting, at the<br/>
very progressive learning center I worked in in NYC before moving to Phila<br/>
to return to grad school.  I really doubt I&#39;ll change my mind and send her<br/>
to a school--public school is fairly much out of the question and the only<br/>
other philosophy I connect with, and not at all entirely, is Waldorf, and we<br/>
simply don&#39;t have the $$$$$ for that.  Of course Annie&#39;s interests and<br/>
passions will inform these decisions as the years go by, too.<br/>
<br/>
Well, more later--I&#39;m enjoying so much reading the posts and my first<br/>
research into the actual nuts and bolts of unschooling with kids.  I really<br/>
admire y&#39;all&#39;s (getting a little Southern) commitment and the depth of some<br/>
of the discussions. I hope you don&#39;t think I&#39;m a raving wild-eyed nut<br/>
because of my first post.  I&#39;m really capable of calm rational discussion!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, and I look forward to reading more,<br/>
Carolyn</div>

Nope, guess your not!  But welcome, I am sure you will have fun and learn a <br/>
lot. And teach and share a lot too.  <br/>
It must be hard to live next door to that, very sad.  Thank goodness my guys <br/>
are older and I don&#39;t have to be tempted, naw, I have to much backbone to let <br/>
anyone tell me how to raise my kids, church or grandparents, especially when <br/>
it means beat your kids into submission.  I have, and I will give them a <br/>
smack on the bottom if I think it necessary, but that rarely happens, and, as <br/>
with their stubborn mom, taking away privileges hurts worse and gets the <br/>
point across.  Especially take away Dragon Ball Z! LOL.  Anyway my point is, <br/>
even if my church told me this was wonderful and all my friends were doing <br/>
it, I may look into it, but once I saw what was being done, no way.  Sortta <br/>
like &quot;all my friends think sending their kids to school is wonderful and they <br/>
all do it&quot;  LOL  LOL ,  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990849449">Hi, my name is Carol, and I am new to the list. It was so pleasant seeing<br/>
everyone be so supportive of the Mom with the daughter who had &quot;friend<br/>
problems.&quot; That&#39;s really great to see!<br/>
<br/>
We have homeschooled for two years now. We love it! Our oldest daughter<br/>
is involved in the college hsing/dual enrollment program, but the other<br/>
three are home with us. I think I can honestly say my 16 year old FINALLY<br/>
understands the concept of unschooling. She is doing her own thing, and<br/>
knows what she needs to work on to be responsible for her own education.<br/>
We are probably closer to being eclectic or relaxed homeschoolers with<br/>
the other two. We use a wide range of resources with the kids. Anything<br/>
and everything. The library is well used, as is the internet and anything<br/>
not nailed down. <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing more about the members of this list. I am still<br/>
having trouble diving completely into unschooling as my youngest son is<br/>
obsessive about his sport of choice (surfing). If I didn&#39;t give him a<br/>
framework to work within, he would only come in for food and sleep. And<br/>
I&#39;m not kidding either. <br/>

I have been lurking for the past week and thought I should introduce myself <br/>
and family. My name is Karen and I am married to David. We have two dd, <br/>
Britney 10 and Brooke 8. We have been homeschooling for about Two years and <br/>
have slowly slid in to unschooling. We live in Southern California.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-500219129">Hello!  I am new to the list.  I thought I would wait for a few more days to<br/>
introduce myself but, after reading several of Sharon&#39;s posts, I decided to<br/>
jump in now.  Like Sharon, I have a large family.  We have nine surviving of<br/>
ten children, consisting of his, mine, ours and more of ours (this last grop<br/>
being our adopted children).  Needless to say, they are ALL ours.  We each<br/>
brought a boy and a girl into this marriage.  Those &quot;children&quot; are now 29,<br/>
29, 26, and 25.  The two girls are married and one has a 2 year old son, with<br/>
a new baby daughter on the way.  We have two girls from this marriage, aged<br/>
14 and 12.  We were foster parents for quite some time, having 40 foster<br/>
children, over the years.  Of those forty, we adopted four, although,<br/>
tragically, our first adopted son died from a surgical error.  The ages of<br/>
the youngest set of children is 10, 6, and 5.  Our two oldest &quot;still at home&quot;<br/>
daughters are dyslexic and the youngest three have a number of special<br/>
needs.  We homeschool four of our five children who are still at home.  We<br/>
hope to someday be able to homeschool our 10 yo boy, too.  His needs are<br/>
numerous and I haven&#39;t been able to figure out how to be able to meet his<br/>
needs, plus the other four.  Also, I am caring for my dad, who is terminally<br/>
ill.  This is our ninth year of homeschooling.  Like many, we began with a<br/>
more formal approach than we have now.  We are basically unschoolers now<br/>
although, I still find myself worrying that, especially the oldest, are not<br/>
getting enough. Old habits die hard.<br/>
<br/>
Although I won&#39;t go heavily into the religious discussion that has been going<br/>
on, I will say that I especially liked Sharon&#39;s response, as well as several<br/>
of the others.  As I&#39;ve grown older, I have seen, more and more, the need for<br/>
tolerance.  We all walk different paths and have come from different places.<br/>
What is appropriate and meaningful to one person may not be at all right for<br/>
another, IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
Enough rambling.  I&#39;m looking forward to the sharing on this list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-702786011">Hello.  My name is Lorrie.  I am new to the list and to unschooling.  <br/>
I have three kids.  17 yo girl, 7 yo boy and a 10 month old boy.  My <br/>
daughter is unfortunately a victim of the system.  After one year of <br/>
ps for my 7 yo I finally had enough.<br/>
<br/>
So this is my first year of homeschooling.  I gathered all kinds of <br/>
information and read and read.  I got the scope and sequence for <br/>
first grade and set out to meet those goals.  Well it did not take <br/>
long to see that my son hates learning from a book and doing <br/>
worksheets.  After many days of fighting I almost gave up.  Then I <br/>
remembered reading about unschooling.  So here I am.  <br/>
<br/>
Now I don&#39;t know what I am suppose to do.  My son likes not having a <br/>
structued lesson every day but I don&#39;t feel like he&#39;s learning <br/>
anything.  I know I can teach him through everyday life but I am now <br/>
very confused as to what I should be teaching him at this age or how <br/>
to go about it.  I always felt that reading was the most important <br/>
thing.  He knows how to read but not very well.  I can&#39;t seem to find <br/>
an approach to further his skills.  One way I can get him to read is <br/>
having a treasure hunt however, I can not supply him with a new toy <br/>
every day so he will read.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions as to where to start or how to proceed would be <br/>
appreciated.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-712852778">Welcome to unschooling, Lorrie!<br/>
<br/>
You will find your way as you go along.  Trial and error is a great teacher.<br/>
<br/>
My son didn&#39;t do much reading until age 9. But, we read to him constantly!<br/>
MOrning, noon and night, and in between.  Fiction, non-fiction, science<br/>
fiction, fantasy, etc.  He is now 11, and we still read to him, morning and<br/>
night.  We all love it! Usually my husband reads him one book, and I read<br/>
him another, and, now that he reads regularly, he reads another.  Sometimes<br/>
we even have a  fourth book going for family reading aloud time.<br/>
<br/>
We always read books on topics my son was interested in.  We use the<br/>
library heavily.  <br/>
<br/>
As a result of listening to all this reading aloud, his vocabulary is<br/>
fabulous and he has a great sense of proper grammar.<br/>
<br/>
My son started reading for pleasure by reading &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; and<br/>
&quot;Garfield&quot; collections.  We have them all.  (I never anticipated spending<br/>
money on comic collections!)  He still likes to re-read them repeatedly at<br/>
bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
How does you son learn?  Observe him and find out.<br/>
<br/>
My son absorbs info from PBS specials like NOVA.  Tonight he watched a<br/>
special on the Hindenbergh disaster, then came in and explained the whole<br/>
thing to us in detail.  I was impressed.<br/>
<br/>
At age 7 my son loved to build with Legos, loved to pretend and tell me<br/>
stories about his pretend characters.  I think developing the imagination<br/>
is most important.<br/>
<br/>
This is a start.  Feel free to ask questions.  I look forward tocomments<br/>
from others.<br/>

Your  experience sounds just like mine.  I &#39;discovered&#39; unschooling <br/>
about two months ago.  I have read some great books that have really <br/>
helped.  The Relaxed Homeschool by Mary Hood is very easy to <br/>
read and very good.  I enjoyed Dumbing us Down by John Gatto, not <br/>
as easy to read, but very eye opening about the wrongness of <br/>
compulsory school and duplicating school-at-home.  I am now <br/>
reading books by John Holt and am enjoying them greatly.  <br/>
<br/>
I know this is right for my family, I just hope I can resist the <br/>
temptation of going back to the workbooks.<br/>

We have been learning with our kids at home for 6 years, and started unschooling &quot;officially&quot; last year. So far, we love it, though sometimes I worry. It&#39;s hard to let go and just trust that they will pursue their interests without me leading them each step of the way. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to mention a website that some of you might find interesting. It&#39;s a women&#39;s website, though a lot of men visit there as well. They have lots of great info on just about every topic you can think of, but the best part of the site is the discussion forums. They have several &quot;homeschooling&quot; forums, as well as an unschooling forum.<br/>
