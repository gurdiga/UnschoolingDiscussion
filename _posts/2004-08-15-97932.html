At what age are children no longer able to choose their actions and <br/>

what to do? This seems to be the catch in trying to accept that <br/>

I think this is too theological for discussion here.   <br/>
If people want help setting up a side-list to discuss unschooling strictly <br/>
within a Christian context, I&#39;d be glad to help.  (Yahoogroups is really very <br/>
easy to use, though, and they walk you through.)<br/>
<br/>
You can announce the list here if you get one going, and I&#39;d be glad to link <br/>
it on my other lists page:<br/>
