Wouldn&#39;t THAT be something: if we could get people to spew ONLY unschooling <br/>
advice or (if they won&#39;t,...) start their own groups and not align themselves <br/>
with *us*?!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OH GOSH!!!!<br/>
<br/>
My stomach fell. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d have to have a system for approving leaders, and it honestly seems the <br/>
LLL leadership stuff is based on Catholic nuns.  There are leader applicants <br/>
(novices) and then there is a leader who is in charge of corresponding with <br/>
them, checking out their temperament and beliefs (their faith, as it were) and <br/>
that would be the sister assigned to train the novices.  And the leaders have to <br/>
see them in action with their kids and to testify/avow that the mom is really <br/>
practicing the LLL way of life.  And the principles have to be agreed to <br/>
individually.   I was put on hold because instead of saying back exactly what the <br/>
leader applicant correspondent wanted me to say (I knew the right answer, and <br/>
asked my sponsoring leader whether I should just recite the right answers and <br/>
she said no, be honest), I questioned the item about breastfeeding making <br/>
discipline easier (don&#39;t remember the wording anymore), and anyway, then I got <br/>
pregnant with Marty and was more involved with the Ceasarean Prevention Movement <br/>
(an organization that was later renamed) and I dropped out of the leader <br/>
applicant process.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t want to do that for unschoolers, even though sometimes it does <br/>
bother me that someone will be going on and on about unschooling and when I see <br/>
her and her kids in their own natural environment it doesn&#39;t seem they&#39;re <br/>
living as the mom said they were.  Some people talk bigger and grow into it later.  <br/>
<br/>
To match LLL and API we&#39;d have to have an approved reading list.  And we&#39;d <br/>
have to have a required reading list for leaders.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t sound fun to me and I hope nobody ever does it, but what are the <br/>
odds?  People like to make rules and clubs and laws and all.   I was in the SCA <br/>
when the whole rule book was about 20 pages long, and the rules for fighting <br/>
fit on one page, and were mostly &quot;Be nice and be honest.&quot;  Now there are Way, <br/>
way way too many rules about everything, and once a rule is approved and <br/>
accepted, it&#39;s nearly impossible to undo it.<br/>
<br/>
About unschooling, I think it should be kept mysterious to the point that <br/>
only those who can figure out what it is and how it works will do it.  If there <br/>
are TOO many easy entry points and if people were to start guiding others <br/>
through it step by step in person with weekly organized prescribed-topic meetings, <br/>
wouldn&#39;t we end up with people who didn&#39;t have the temperament for it and who <br/>
couldn&#39;t do it if the external directives stopped?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m wrong, but it seems those who want step by step instructions won&#39;t <br/>
be able to sustain unschooling for the years it takes for kids to grow up and  <br/>
be out on their own.<br/>
<br/>
It takes creativity and awareness and initiative and interactions that others <br/>
can&#39;t direct.  We can help people see it and try it, but we can&#39;t sustain it <br/>
for them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This post makes me think of that TV show SuperNanny.  It upsets me <br/>
and I don&#39;t know why I keep watching it, kind of like looking at a <br/>
car wreck...<br/>
<br/>
I was watching it tonight.  There was one particularly <br/>
sad/angry/frustrated little boy and it disgusted me that they were <br/>
happy about breaking his little spirit.  It made me think an <br/>
unschooler mom should have a show to counteract this one!    <br/>
