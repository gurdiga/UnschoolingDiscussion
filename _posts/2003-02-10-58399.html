No, it&#39;s a portable but was in a brown-cloth covered wooden case.<br/>
The top part is just about like the treadle machines were but it has a motor.<br/>
<br/>
I had it refurbished a few years ago and when I got it back something wasn&#39;t <br/>
right, but I didn&#39;t take it back in.  It&#39;s still fixable.  It&#39;s straight <br/>
stitch only, but it will go backwards without holding anything, so that&#39;s <br/>
useful sometimes.  And it&#39;s strong enough to do felled seams on denim, and to <br/>
sew suede.<br/>
