I will  try to keep your examples in mind and hope I<br/>
can come up with something to  preserve Ellis&#39;<br/>
friendship without sacrificing his  dignity.<br/>

I&#39;m afraid I wouldn&#39;t be so cheery, if someone snapped at my son like  that.  <br/>
I&#39;d look disapprovingly at her if it was her kid she was snapping  at.  But <br/>
my son?  No.  I&#39;d probably put myself between him and  her, look her in the eye <br/>
and say, &quot;He&#39;s getting them.&quot;  In case that wasn&#39;t  enough, I&#39;d say, &quot;don&#39;t <br/>
talk to my son like that.&quot;  I might say, &quot;please&quot;,  if I were in the mood.<br/>
 <br/>
(Is this considered &quot;violent communication&quot;?  Good.)<br/>

She&#39;s using you for childcare.  She&#39;s not going to drop you like a  rock <br/>
because you set so small a boundary.  She&#39;ll rationalize it some way  or another <br/>
just so she can be rid of her kid when she wants.<br/>

Long-term, the solution is to encourage friendships with kids whose <br/>
parents are sane, aren&#39;t after your husband, and don&#39;t bark at their <br/>
children.<br/>

Yeah, I probably would, too, eventually.  Divorce really makes people  act <br/>
crazy sometimes, but it&#39;s no excuse for putting the eye on someone else&#39;s  <br/>
husband.  I&#39;d probably worry more about her being attracted to my husband  than the <br/>
way she treated my kid.  I can keep my kid away from her.   I&#39;m not sure I <br/>
could keep her away from my husband.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Preachin&#39; to the choir ;)  When my dress rehearsal<br/>
marriage ended (it was lousy which guaranteed the<br/>
performance is great), a dear friend told me that I<br/>
would be insane for a minimum of two years.  I<br/>
immediately dismissed him as a nutbar.  Two years<br/>
later, I came out of the divorce-induced madness<br/>
older, wiser and absolutely amazed and sometimes<br/>
appalled at the things I did and said during that<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
I have very clearly stated to my husband what I see as<br/>
potential problems.  He, after 10 years, doesn&#39;t<br/>
realize he&#39;s adorable.  I&#39;m not worried about his<br/>
reaction to any potential advances.  He thinks she&#39;s<br/>
creepy.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we&#39;re both just wanting Ellis to have the<br/>
opportunity to have a friend.  Our neighbors are all<br/>
retired and he loves them but there&#39;s a kid shortage. <br/>
And when you eliminate all the abusive and mean ones,<br/>
the pool is really shallow.  He&#39;s just not a<br/>
run-and-scream type of kid for the most part.  When he<br/>
gets in those social situations, he shuts down or he<br/>
tries to interact and has no idea he&#39;s being made the<br/>
butt of jokes or kid-cruelty.<br/>
<br/>
Helping him navigate the social waters is one of our<br/>
biggest challenges.  I guess we try to manipulate the<br/>
winds as much as possible so his sails stay full.<br/>
