Michelle,<br/>
Is your hip dysplasia congenital?  I&#39;m wondering because my 1 year old <br/>
daughter who has a brachial plexus injury also has hip dysplasia.  We took <br/>
her to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon when she was a week old, and he put her <br/>
in a special harness for 6 weeks.  He said that usually does the trick - but <br/>
it didn&#39;t in her case.  She&#39;s in another type of brace now - a hard plastic <br/>
one - that she wears to bed at night.  She has a check up with the orthopedic <br/>
doctor the end of this month.  Hopefully her hip will look good enough to <br/>
take her out of the brace.  I guess I&#39;d just like to know how your hip <br/>
dysplasia has affected you.  How painful is it?  Do you think there is any <br/>
connection between hip dysplasia and low muscle tone?  Does your hip pop <br/>
often?  Do your other joints click or pop often?  I&#39;d really appreciate any <br/>
information you or anyone else could give me.  Oh, and thank you for the <br/>
chiropractic information. I&#39;m seriously considering making an appointment for <br/>
the baby.  <br/>
