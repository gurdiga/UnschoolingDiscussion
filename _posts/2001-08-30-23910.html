  &lt;&lt;guns don&#39;t really kill people its all pretend.  Subconsciously that<br/>
  thought patter will follow into adulthood (paraphrase)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I ask you to place a real gun and a plastic gun (even one that looks real)<br/>
  in front of any one over about the age of 3 and ask them which one can<br/>
  really kill someone and which one is just pretend.    I await the response<br/>
  of your research.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-11599530">&lt;&lt;This test has been done many times&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Could you point me to where I might read about it?  I truly cannot fathom<br/>
someone mistaking a real gun for a toy.  A real gun is quite heavy and<br/>
solid, in fact surprisingly so.  But actually my question was not which was<br/>
real, but which one really kills.  The poster said that thoughts of guns and<br/>
death simply being pretend would continue in some form into adulthood.  I<br/>
cannot imagine anyone not being able to understand that real guns really<br/>
kill things.<br/>
