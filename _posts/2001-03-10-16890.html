<div id="ygrps-yiv-558108646">As I cut up a particularly sweet and juicey pineapple tonight I was<br/>
reminded of an idea I once heard.  I knew someone who grew a pineapple<br/>
plant from the green, leafy top of a pineapple.  Just a regular<br/>
pineapple fruit from the grocery store does it apparently.  I can no<br/>
longer access that person for the specifics and I was wondering if<br/>
anyone out there in unschooler-land knew anything about this?  I can&#39;t<br/>
remember if the plant is capable of eventually bearing fruit itself...? <br/>
It seems to me the technique is rather simple; like just sticking the<br/>
top in some soil is enough to get it going?...?<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.<br/>

I have done this in the past and you are correct that the technique is very<br/>
simple.   We left just a bit of the fruit itself and barely covered the &quot;stem&quot;.<br/>
Alas, I do not know how big it would eventually grow and if it would ever bear<br/>
fruit.   Ours did increase in size and grew for months but that could have been<br/>
&quot;beginner&#39;s luck&quot;.      Experiment and see what works!     Maybe get a few more<br/>
from the same place as that particularly juicy sweet on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339939904">When you remove the top before planting twist it off the fruit, leave it for<br/>
a week then plant it.   It takes two years for the plant to bear fruit and<br/>
it needs a really sunny position.  I will always remember the one I planted<br/>
when I was seven and it took an eternity for the fruit to grow, but when it<br/>
did it was well worth it.<br/>
<br/>
I just noticed that you are in Saskatchewan, maybe you will have a problem,<br/>
the weather isn&#39;t exactly tropical or semi-tropical there.   I was in<br/>
Queensland Australia when I grew mine..  Maybe if you had a heated green<br/>
house or were able to grow it in a large container that you could have in a<br/>
really sunny position indoors once temperatures drop below about 40.<br/>

<br>In our old house the floor was all concrete slab, but in the house we&#39;re in

<br>New Mexico. Plenty of light, in winter, just not ambient heat. &nbsp;We have that 
<br>moonscape (desert) problem--the difference between the sunny midday and the 
<br>dark evening of the same day (without other factors) can be 30 degrees. &nbsp;So 
<br>even though it&#39;s 60 degrees in the daytime and people are going around 
<br>without jackets, it can freeze at night.
