<div id="ygrps-yiv-84893824">OK.. I just asked Anna..<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How does it make you feel when someone says they are proud of you&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She says.. &quot;Good!&quot;    I say, &quot;It makes you feel good?&quot;  She says. with big <br/>
eye roll and a snort.. &quot;Uhh, no, Mom, it makes me feel awful,   come on, what <br/>
kind of question is that anyway?&quot;    I said, &quot;I was just checking.. lol, just <br/>
wondering&quot;  She said, &quot;Well, of course, good, unless it is said sarcastically&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Like I said before, conveying pride, offering encouragement and praise, does <br/>
not have to contain the word &quot;proud&quot;, it can be communicated in various ways.. <br/>
verbally and even non verbally.   But, again, I would not avoid the word <br/>
proud out of fear of being somehow misguided in my feelings.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558810062">&quot;I&#39;m so proud of you,&quot; I think does convey an underlying attitude that <br/>
might be something unschoolers, in particular, are trying to avoid.<br/>
<br/>
My father used to say he was proud of me, a lot. My mother just said <br/>
she loved me and, also, especially when I was an adult, that she <br/>
admired different things about me or things I did.<br/>
<br/>
When my father said he was proud of me, it made me feel good. No doubt <br/>
about that. A whole lot like getting an &quot;A&quot; in school made me feel <br/>
good. BUT - the question is what else did it do. Were there further <br/>
impacts on my life that weren&#39;t so good, even though it made me feel <br/>
good? I&#39;d say yes. I made major schooling and career decisions in order <br/>
to make sure my father would still be &quot;proud&quot; of me. MAJOR ones!!! <br/>
Instead of examining my own individual interests and passions and my <br/>
own desires for my future, I was extremely heavily influenced by what <br/>
would make my father proud of me.<br/>
<br/>
When my mother said she admired me - she said she admired how hard I <br/>
worked, how persistent I was, what a conscientious mom I was, and so <br/>
on, those kinds of comments made me feel proud of myself, true, but <br/>
they made me want to &quot;be myself&quot; even more than before.<br/>
<br/>
I really think &quot;pride&quot; has an ownership sense to it, at least as most <br/>
people use it. It conveys a  feeling of &quot;I&#39;m basking in the reflected <br/>
glory.&quot; And so a sort of underlying message got conveyed along with the <br/>
pride - and that was that my behavior was better if it reflected well <br/>
on him. My mom&#39;s &quot;I so admire that you breastfed your kids, even as <br/>
they got older,&quot; never felt like she was taking part of the ownership <br/>
of what I did. It seemed like something she&#39;d say to anybody she <br/>
admired. She definitely gave ME full ownership of (and responsibility <br/>
for) my own behavior and didn&#39;t expect me to do something in order make <br/>
her proud.<br/>
<br/>
Basing my behavior on trying to make other people proud of me - <br/>
including doing well in school, especially - sent my life off in <br/>
directions that were not truly where I wish, now looking back, I&#39;d gone.<br/>

think of a time I have.  My parents didn&#39;t either.  I do remember after my mother <br/>
died, it was a few years after, having family come up to me and say &quot;your <br/>
mother would be so proud of you and how your life are turning out.&quot; (or something <br/>
like that) it made me feel very good to think that she would have approved of <br/>
how I am living my life.  Not that I need her approval but not having her <br/>
around that gave me a warm feeling to think about.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Make me proud&quot; is a heck of a parting instruction that a lot of kids get <br/>
when they go out for competitions or to school or whatever.   It&#39;s a directive to <br/>
make your decisions based on what the parent wants.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty much the theme of one character&#39;s life on Dead Poet&#39;s Society.<br/>
<br/>
I had a boyfriend who was in the predicament.  He knew with every move he <br/>
made whether he was getting warm or cold on the &quot;make me proud&quot; directive his dad <br/>
had put on him.<br/>
<br/>
He was living a small part of his dad&#39;s life.<br/>

of you&quot;   I would never tell anyone to make me proud.  That is the misguided <br/>
pride I spoke of earlier.  There IS a difference.<br/>

<br/>
Busted!  I said that to Lars the other day, in front of an older friend of<br/>
his.<br/>
Aside from the fact that it was said in public (embarrassment) I always<br/>
thought of this as affirming the parent&#39;s belief in the child or teen&#39;s<br/>
ability *to* make good choices.  But I guess that would only be true if the<br/>
parent really does believe in the child&#39;s ability to do so, which I do.  I<br/>
always thought it was a lot better than, &quot;Behave yourself&quot; or, &quot;Stay out of<br/>
trouble&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So what *do* some of you say to your teens when they&#39;re heading off to do<br/>
something where they might be tempted to make not-so-good choices?<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; So what *do* some of you say to your teens when they&#39;re heading off to do<br/>
 something where they might be tempted to make not-so-good choices?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have talked about making good choices, or I should say the best choice at<br/>
the time with my kids. Never yell that out to them &lt;BG&gt; but we talk about<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
If there is a situation I may know about ahead of time, like my kids being<br/>
around someone they have had trouble with before, we talk before we get<br/>
there about what to do if such and such will happen. Talk about being<br/>
respectful and so on. I&#39;m always right there with them though anyway. When<br/>
they 2 middle kids off without me, that&#39;s only at sports camp. I have never<br/>
had a hard time with anything happening there. The coaches are extremely<br/>
aware of kids respecting each other and there are little reminders all day<br/>
about that and also encouraging one another too. So when I send them off at<br/>
the park, I always just say have fun. That&#39;s what I want them to do and I&#39;m<br/>
very comfortable in knowing they are well looked after.<br/>
<br/>
When Tara goes out, I always call out to her to *be careful*, then I love<br/>
you. We  have talked about what my *be careful* means, so she knows all that<br/>
it entails. Mostly if she&#39;s driving, it means to be aware of what&#39;s going on<br/>
around her. Don&#39;t be playing with the radio and gabbing on her phone while<br/>
driving. Watch if she&#39;s being followed home and watch if she&#39;s out alone<br/>
walking to her car. Don&#39;t stay or go where trouble is. Always call if she<br/>
needs help in any way. So my little *be careful* is loaded and it&#39;s just a<br/>
reminder to her. I always tell her to have fun too. Sometimes I&#39;ll say to<br/>
her, &quot;don&#39;t do anything I wouldn&#39;t do&quot; which she responds with, &quot;well that<br/>
just gives me unlimited choices doesn&#39;t it?!&quot;<br/>

Marty and Keith just pulled in after being gone two days, camping.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is not back yet from a weekend in Denver.  There is one adult couple <br/>
I&#39;ve known longer than I&#39;ve known Kirby that I can get some feedback from, but I <br/>
just said &quot;I hope everything goes well!  Have fun!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For Marty, I thought of several things and rejected them, and ended up saying <br/>
&quot;Have a good time.&quot;   But I told Keith-the-Dad (where Marty couldn&#39;t hear <br/>
me), &quot;Take care of my baby who&#39;s too big to need me anymore.&quot;  Keith said, &quot;Oh, <br/>
he needs you more ways than he knows&quot; and kissed me.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;d told any of them &quot;be good&quot; or &quot;be careful,&quot; it wouldn&#39;t have been as <br/>
good for any of us.<br/>
<br/>
Today Holly was walking with a younger friend of hers along a crowded <br/>
two-lane rural road in a little tourist town FULL of cars parked, cars driving, and <br/>
at one point we separated so I could go get the van and meet them up at the <br/>
other end of town.  I wanted to say nothing, but it seemed wrong so I said <br/>
&quot;PLEASE watch for cars.&quot;  It sounded lame, but one wasn&#39;t my child, so it seemed the <br/>
magic mom-ju-ju that was appropriate for abandoning someone else&#39;s child to <br/>
unnatural elements in distracting circumstances.<br/>

choices, he was off with a young man I had never met until then, probably 18<br/>
or 19, so 4 or 5 years older.  I did ask the bike shop owner, who knows all<br/>
the kids who ride, about him and another young man about the same age.  His<br/>
answer reassured me, but still they were going overnight, extreme biking at<br/>
a ski mountain 3 or 4 hours drive away.  I guess in that situation, &quot;Be<br/>
careful&quot; wouldn&#39;t be out of line.<br/>
<br/>
The other situation is spending time with one friend of his who really does<br/>
tend to make bad choices, often.  Funny, I just realized that it was *his*<br/>
mother I first heard say that.  Interesting.  I&#39;ll be thinking about that<br/>
one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816931650">Wow Pam,<br/>
<br/>
I never saw it from that perspective!  When you talked about your <br/>
father, I could totally relate!  I did not get so much the proud, <br/>
but comments like &quot;You&#39;re the smart one, you take after me.&quot; or <br/>
comments related to looking attractive.  To this day I still have <br/>
major issues with those things.  I make an effort to watch the way <br/>
in which I compliment my son.  It is so natural to tell him how <br/>
handsome he is but I try instead to tell him I think he is smart or <br/>
funny or kind.  My Dad made me feel like if I was not attractive or <br/>
had gained weight than I was not lovable.  I would never want to <br/>
pass that on to my kids.  I had not analyzed the &quot;proud&quot; comments <br/>
and I do say those quite a bit.  I will have to change that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
