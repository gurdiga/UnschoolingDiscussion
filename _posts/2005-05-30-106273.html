<div id="ygrps-yiv-399817146">The raw egg story reminds me of my two littler kids. They were about 8 and <br/>
6, I guess, and just loved to put their hands in my big bin of white flour <br/>
that I keep in the basement. It used to bug the crud out of me, and I tried <br/>
many things, including not only the standard shouting, but also politely <br/>
asking, and explaining &quot;why&quot; I didn&#39;t want them sticking their hands in the <br/>
flour bin.<br/>
<br/>
Then one day, I set them down on the floor, opened up the bin, and said <br/>
&quot;Play&quot; Which they did. Hands, arms, legs, faces. Hair. All white with flour. <br/>
They played until they were done, when we dusted them off, stuck them in a <br/>
shower, and I swept up the floor. That cool, soft feeling on their hands <br/>
must have been so nice. I figure, it couldn&#39;t have cost me more than five <br/>
bucks to replace that flour, and they had a terrific time.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, they haven&#39;t stuck their hands in the flour. If they wanted to, <br/>
we&#39;d do it again. amazing, what saying &quot;yes&quot; will do.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;For instance, today he really wanted to play with the raw eggs --<br/>
&gt;he didn&#39;t understand the difference between the hardboiled ones I<br/>
&gt;usually give him and the raw ones in the fridge -- so I brought one<br/>
&gt;raw egg up to the bathtub, stripped him to his diaper, and let him<br/>
&gt;play with it there.  Boy, was he surprised when it broke!  It was fun<br/>
&gt;to watch. </span></blockquote></div>
