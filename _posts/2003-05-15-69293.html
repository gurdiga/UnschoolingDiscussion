<div id="ygrps-yiv-793242022">This thread started over a book I recommended &quot;Through Indian Eyes, or a<br/>
site - in any case, a book, Indian in the Cupboard is listed under &quot;Books to<br/>
Avoid&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That led us to discuss racism.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot convince you that racism against American Indians is alive, well<br/>
and accepted much more than is admitted or perhaps recognized.<br/>
I do know racism when I see it (or read it)<br/>
When I spoke of the terrible things done to American Indians, I was speaking<br/>
of things that have happened in my life time. The sterilization of our women<br/>
goes on now. It isn&#39;t as widespread - but it happens.<br/>
The abduction of our children goes on now - if a family wants to raise their<br/>
children in the old way - we cannot. We must have gas, electricity, indoor<br/>
plumbing. In cases of mixed marriages, most often the children go w/ the<br/>
non-Indian parent - even if the parent has proven him or herself to be<br/>
abusive. That&#39;s the truth.<br/>
Because courts are used does not make it right.<br/>
I know American Indians that have not seen their children in years because<br/>
all the non-native (usually white) parent has to say is &quot;....is drinking &<br/>
therefore not capable of raising/caring for our children&quot;<br/>
I know of grandmothers that have lost their grandchildren - with those<br/>
grandchildren going to a second cousin of the dead white parents.<br/>
I know that this happens today.<br/>
<br/>
Again - if the People that is affected - in this case - the American Indians<br/>
say - this is racist or &#39;avoid&#39; this book - how can you, a white woman claim<br/>
that it is not racist?<br/>
Is that not like a man denying there is sexism?<br/>
<br/>
I can not change you this day.<br/>
But please, realize that some of what you have said is very racist. Step<br/>
back from the tress and check out the forest.<br/>
<br/>
Read this.<br/>
This is about one of our children - the children of Turtle Island. The<br/>
children who can follow an unbroken link to the far past, to the ancestors.<br/>
When our children walk on Mother Earth, they walk in the paths that are a<br/>
thousand generations old.<br/>

SuAnne Big Crow<br/>
<br/>
SuAnne led Pine Ridge to a State &quot;A&quot; Championship in 1989, making<br/>
Pine  Ridge<br/>
the only native amercian girls team to win a state championship in<br/>
South Dakota.<br/>
Here is a story of her leadership:<br/>
In the fall of 1988, the Pine Ridge Lady Thorpes went to Lead to play<br/>
a basketball game. SuAnne was a full member of the team by then. She was a<br/>
freshman, fourteen years old. Getting ready in the locker room, the<br/>
Pine Ridge girls could hear the din from the fans. They were yelling<br/>
 fake-indian war cries, a &quot;woo-woo-woo&quot; sound. The usual plan for the<br/>
pre-game<br/>
warm-up was for the visiting team to run onto the court in a line, take a<br/>
lap or<br/>
two around the floor, shoot some baskets, and then go to their bench at<br/>
courtside. After that, the home team and then the game would begin. Usually<br/>
the Thorpes lined up for their entry - more or less according to height,<br/>
which meant that senior Doni De Cory,<br/>
one of the tallest, went first. As the team waited in the hallway leading<br/>
from<br/>
 the locker room, the heckling got louder. The Lead fans were yelling<br/>
like &quot;squaw&quot; and &quot;gut-eater.&quot; Some were waving food stamps, a<br/>
reference to the reservation&#39;s receiving federal aid. Others yelled,<br/>
&quot;Where&#39;s the<br/>
 cheese?<br/>
The joke being that if Indians were lining up, it must be to get commodity<br/>
cheese. The Lead high school band had joined in, with fake-Indian<br/>
 drumming<br/>
and a fake-Indian tune. Doni De Cory looked out the door and told her<br/>
teammates, &quot;I can&#39;t handle this.&quot; SuAnne quickly offered to go first<br/>
 her place. She was so eager that Doni became suspicious. &quot;Don&#39;t embarrass<br/>
 us,&quot; Doni told her. SuAnne said, &quot;I won&#39;t, I won&#39;t embarrass you.&quot; Doni<br/>
gave her the ball and SuAnne stood first in line.<br/>
She came running onto the court dribbling the basketball, with her teammates<br/>
running behind. On the court, the noise was deafeningly loud. SuAnne went<br/>
right down the middle; but instead of running a full lap, she<br/>
suddenly stopped when she got to center court. her teammates were taken by<br/>
 surprise, and some bumped into one another. Coach Zimiga at the rear of the<br/>
line did not know why they had stopped. Su Anne turned to Doni De Cory and<br/>
tossed her the ball. Then she stepped into the jump-ball circle at center<br/>
court, in front of the Lead fans. She unbuttoned her warm-up jacket, took it<br/>
off, draped it over her shoulders, and began to do the Lakota shawl dance.<br/>
 SuAnne knew all the traditional dances she had competed in many powwows as<br/>
a<br/>
 little girl and the dance she chose is a young woman&#39;s dance, graceful and<br/>
modest<br/>
and show-offy all at the same time. &quot;I couldn&#39;t believe it she was powwowin&#39;<br/>
 like, &#39;get down!&#39;&quot; Doni De Cory recalled. &quot;And then she started to<br/>
 sing.&quot;<br/>
SuAnne began to sing in Lakota, swaying back and forth in the<br/>
jump-ball circle, doing the shawl dance, using her warm-up jacket for a<br/>
shawl.<br/>
The crowd went completely silent. &quot;All that stuff the Lead fans were<br/>
yelling - it was like she reversed it somehow,&quot; a teammate said. In the<br/>
sudden<br/>
quiet, all you could hear was her Lakota song. SuAnne stood up, dropped her<br/>
jacket,<br/>
took the ball from Doni De Cory, and ran a lap around the court dribbling<br/>
expertly and fast. The fans began to cheer and applaud. She sprinted to<br/>
 the basket, went up in the air, and laid the ball through the hoop, with<br/>
the<br/>
fans cheering loudly now. Of course, Pine Ridge went on to win the game.<br/>
&quot;It was funny,&quot; Doni De Cory says, &quot;but after that game the<br/>
relationship between Lead and us was tremendous. When we played Lead again,<br/>
the<br/>
games were really good, and we got to know some of the girls on the team.<br/>
<br/>
 Later, when we went to a tournament and Lead was there, we were hanging out<br/>
with<br/>
the Lead girls and eating pizza with them. We got to know some of their<br/>
parents, too. What SuAnne did made a lasting impression and changed the<br/>
whole situation with us and Lead. We found out there are some really good<br/>
people in Lead.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

Frankly, I do not see how I can stay on this list.<br/>
I feel it would, in some way, be agreeing with you.<br/>

I will speak no more of this, wasichu<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for sharing this story, it was beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, my first thought while reading it was that the very<br/>
act of schooling contributes so much to situations like this. Without school<br/>
and its teams and its us-vs-them and its power-plays by kids who are<br/>
powerless to control much else, there wouldn&#39;t be as much of this kind of<br/>
crap going around. I think most &quot;isms&quot; - racism, sexism, whatever-ism are<br/>
basically plays by the powerless to control *someone* else, to put *someone*<br/>
else lower than themselves. By unschooling, by freeing kids from being<br/>
raised in an environment of powerlessness, we stop so much of this. My kids<br/>
wouldn&#39;t think of putting down someone else, it just wouldn&#39;t occur to them<br/>
to do so. My kids take each person they meet at face value, they don&#39;t have<br/>
to learn to judge them by outward characteristics because such things don&#39;t<br/>
mean much unless you&#39;re in a prisonlike powerless environment.<br/>
<br/>
I think the very act of unschooling combats racism. The very act of being<br/>
with my kids every day and being able to share my own values with them,<br/>
instead of having them learn values of the oppressed and the opressor in a<br/>
school is freeing them from this vicious cycle.<br/>
<br/>
Even if we do nothing else to &quot;save the world&quot; (and I sincerely doubt that<br/>
even one person on this list doesn&#39;t do other wonderful, beneficial things<br/>
as well), unschooling is breaking the chains of the &quot;isms&quot; of the world.<br/>
