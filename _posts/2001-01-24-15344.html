<div id="ygrps-yiv-178268717">I&#39;ve been away from my computer for days now getting ready for my <br/>
son&#39;s 8th birthday party and our family coming over to celebrate.  <br/>
Last night was the big shindig and today I&#39;m still reeling from some <br/>
of the comments from family members.  It did take me days to get <br/>
ready for company because our house is always an obvious testimony to <br/>
the fact the we have 3 children who are home most of the time and who <br/>
have the freedom to explore our world!!<br/>
<br/>
The big question last night to my 8yo was, &quot;What did you do in school <br/>
today?&quot;.  I was a little surprised when he responded, &quot;I took the day <br/>
off.&quot;  That must have meant that he was busy helping Mom clean and <br/>
help get meals ready for the younger two.  Or it may have meant that <br/>
he didn&#39;t know quite how to respond!?  The funny part, to me, is that <br/>
I didn&#39;t hear anyone ask the ps children what THEY did in school that <br/>
day!  I think that when people come here they expect to find a <br/>
classroom in one of our rooms.  I think that they have a hard time <br/>
seeing our whole house as the &quot;classroom&quot;, but each room reflects <br/>
exactly that.  My s-i-l (with no children) told my son that she felt <br/>
bad for him that he didn&#39;t get to play games at school for his <br/>
birthday!  Do ps children really have all day long to play and <br/>
celebrate their birthdays?<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s family doesn&#39;t ask me about homeschooling or <br/>
unschooling, and I know that they themselves really don&#39;t know <br/>
anything about either except that it&#39;s different or weird to them.<br/>
<br/>
In our home, since the day my first was born, I&#39;ve shared a bed with <br/>
my children.  I could never imagine it any other way.  There were <br/>
many times over the years that I&#39;ve felt like they &quot;should&quot; be <br/>
sleeping in their own beds since that&#39;s the way everyone does it.  My <br/>
6yo daughter does sleep in her own bed every night and has for years <br/>
(does not like sleeping in our bed at all, but occassionally likes me <br/>
to sleep in her bed).  Whenever I &quot;should&quot; on myself, I normally <br/>
regret it because what my heart says and what &quot;should&quot; says are <br/>
normally polar opposites!<br/>
<br/>
My mother-in-law took the opportunity last night to talk to my sons <br/>
to try to convince them that they should be sleeping in their own <br/>
beds, starting last night!!  My 3yo told grandma that Jason the 8yo <br/>
was going to sleep in my bed forever and take it with him when he <br/>
moves out!!!  I loved it, especially because that&#39;s exactly what <br/>
Jason says.  We do have a baby due in March and Jason is talking a <br/>
lot about sleeping in his own bed.  We&#39;ll have to see how that goes <br/>
when the baby comes home.  With this fourth child, I see little point <br/>
in even bringing the crib out because I know that he&#39;ll sleep in my <br/>
bed at home, just like he&#39;ll sleep in my arms at the hospital, much <br/>
to the nurses&#39; dismay!<br/>
<br/>
I whole-heartedly support &quot;shared sleep&quot;, if that&#39;s what&#39;s right for <br/>
your family and only you know that.  Just like all of the other <br/>
different or weird decision we&#39;ve made with raising our children!<br/>
<br/>
A normal morning in our house would be my children doing their own <br/>
thing up until about lunchtime.  I think that they felt that their <br/>
family is expecting them to be &quot;schooling&quot; all day so this morning <br/>
they got out magnets and we played, discussed and experimented.  Then <br/>
out came the clock and I was asked for a &quot;lesson&quot; in time by my <br/>
daughter.  By lunchtime, I was schooled-out and escaped to these <br/>
message boards to hear from so many like-minded people!<br/>
<br/>
These are my 2 cents on some recent topics!<br/>
<br/>
Chris<br/>
Mommy to Jason (8), Angela (6-1/2), Daniel (3-1/2) and baby due in <br/>
March!!<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  2000 years doesn&#39;t really change things much, individuals will <br/>
always have their belief or disbelief in who Jesus is (or was, for <br/>
some).  I agree with keeping this particular message board to <br/>
unschooling.  Maybe there is a place out in egroups that is both <br/>
unschooling and religious, or maybe someone can start one for a place <br/>
to share ideas...another$.02</div>

<br>
<br>Thanks for your e-mail! &nbsp;We are having company this Sunday for the Superbowl 
<br>and I am worrying about all the comments that may or may not be made to my 8 
<br>yo son. &nbsp;One set of neighbors doesn&#39;t even know yet that he is homeschooled. &nbsp;
<br>We just started in November, and between all the holidays and sicknesses that 
<br>ran through the house, we haven&#39;t gotten together with them since before that!
<br>
<br>Oh and then there is my house to worry about! &nbsp;It looks like three kids 
<br>(8,5,3) run it! &nbsp;Oh well, if they don&#39;t like my dirty floors - too bad! &nbsp;We 
<br>will have about 10 kids in the house for Sunday - I certainly am not going to 
<br>kill myself cleaning before!
<br>
<br>Ahhh life. &nbsp;The things we moms worry about. &nbsp;Your e-mail helped me get ready 
<br>for the onslaught of stupid questions myself and my son will have to deal 
<br>with.... Thank for you two cents...it was a gold mine to me!

for our company...<br/>
<br/>
My mil, her mother and one of my sister-in-laws are truly obsessive <br/>
compulsive cleaners.  The day-to-day reality of my home would choke <br/>
them!!  When it came to the kids rooms, they really did the best that <br/>
they could, but picture perfect would be a far cry from the truth.  <br/>
They, of course, don&#39;t want me to go in there in clean it for them; <br/>
I&#39;d ruin everything in their minds!  So, when my husband was having a <br/>
last-minute conniption (sp?) about their rooms and the fact that I <br/>
had locked OUR bedroom up and off limits, I was sooo mad!!  What does <br/>
he or anyone else expect?  A part of me envies the people who are <br/>
organized and are always &quot;company ready&quot;; the other part loves the <br/>
fact that I enjoy my children and many other things in our lives, but <br/>
don&#39;t enjoy being tied down to a schedule, and I didn&#39;t hire on to be <br/>
a housekeeper.<br/>
<br/>
So, thank you for your response; it&#39;s comforting to know I&#39;m not the <br/>
only one...<br/>
