That is not all who attend though.  I went to the first one.  We had been <br/>
unschooling but I knew of no one else who was.  I had been searching the web, <br/>
and <br/>
ran across the SOS sight and thought it sounded like a good place to see more <br/>
unschooling in action.  Although I had no idea it would be so child friendly. <br/>
It was refreshing and that is where I heard about the unschooling dotcom <br/>
list and a few months later joined.  <br/>
Thanks Kelly.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

<br/>
My pleasure!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And this year&#39;s tapes (as well as last year&#39;s) are now available. I&#39;ll be <br/>
posting the link, etc. when I have it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-873018477">Thanks to all who made the Live & Learn conference happen last week. <br/>
It was our first and we had a blast!<br/>
<br/>
My dd, Corrina, made lots of new friends and is missing them!  If any<br/>
of your kids met her and would like to IM/email her, please email me<br/>
off-list.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, all!<br/>
