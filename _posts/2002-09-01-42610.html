  A Major Scientific Advance: The Etiology and Treatment of Childhood<br/>
<br/>
         THE ETIOLOGY AND TREATMENT OF CHILDHOOD<br/>
                 Jordan W. Smoller<br/>
                 University of Pennsylvania<br/>
<br/>
Childhood is a syndrome which has only recently begun to receive<br/>
serious attention from clinicians. The syndrome itself, however,<br/>
is not at all recent. As early as the 8th century, the Persian<br/>
historian Kidnom made references to &quot;short, noisy creatures,&quot; who<br/>
may well have been what we now call &quot;children.&quot; The treatment of<br/>
children, however, was unknown until this century, when so-called<br/>
&quot;child psychologists&quot; and &quot;child psychiatrists&quot; became common. Despite<br/>
this history of clinical neglect, it has been estimated that well over<br/>
half of all Americans alive today have experienced childhood directly<br/>
(Suess, 1983). In fact, the actual numbers are probably much higher,<br/>
since these data are based on self-reports which may be subject to<br/>
social desirability biases and retrospective distortion.<br/>
<br/>
The growing acceptance of childhood as a distinct phenomenon is<br/>
reflected in the proposed inclusion of the syndrome in the upcoming<br/>
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition,<br/>
or DSM-IV, of the American Psychiatric Association (1990). Clinicians<br/>
are still in disagreement about the significant clinical features of<br/>
childhood, but the proposed DSM-IV will almost certainly include the<br/>
following core features:<br/>
<br/>
1.    Congenital onset<br/>
2.    Dwarfism<br/>
3.    Emotional lability and immaturity<br/>
4.    Knowledgy deficits<br/>
5.    Legume anorexia<br/>
<br/>
Clinical Features of Childhood<br/>
<br/>
Although the focus of this paper is on the efficacy of conventional<br/>
treatment of childhood, the five clinical markers mentioned above merit<br/>
further discussion for those unfamiliar with this patient population.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CONGENITAL ONSET<br/>
<br/>
In one of the few existing literature reviews on childhood, Temple-Black<br/>
(1982) has noted that childhood is almost always present at birth,<br/>
although it may go undetected for years or even remain subclinical<br/>
indefinitely. This observation has led some investigators to speculate<br/>
on biological contribution to childhood. As one psychologist has put<br/>
it, &quot;we may soon be in a position to distinguish organic childhood from<br/>
functional childhood&quot; (Rogers, 1979).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DWARFISM<br/>
<br/>
This is certainly the most familiar marker of childhood. It is widely<br/>
known that children are physically short relative to the population at<br/>
large. Indeed, common clinical wisdom suggests that the treatment of<br/>
the so-called &quot;small child&quot; (or &quot;tot&quot;) is particularly difficult. These<br/>
children are known to exhibit infantile behavior and display a startling<br/>
lack of insight (Tom and Jerry, 1967).<br/>
<br/>
EMOTIONAL LABILITY AND IMMATURITY<br/>
<br/>
This aspect of childhood is often the only basis for a clinician&#39;s<br/>
diagnosis. As a result, many otherwise normal adults are misdiagnosed as<br/>
children and must suffer the unnecessary social stigma of being labelled<br/>
a &quot;child&quot; by professionals and friends alike.<br/>
<br/>
KNOWLEDGE DEFICITS<br/>
<br/>
While many children have IQs with or even above the norm, almost all<br/>
will manifest knowledge deficits. Anyone who has known a real child<br/>
has experienced the frustration of trying to discuss any topic that<br/>
requires some general knowledge. Children seem to have little knowledge<br/>
about the world they live in. Politics, art, and science--children are<br/>
largely ignorant of these. Perhaps it is because of this ignorance, but<br/>
the sad fact that most children have few friends who are not,<br/>
themselves, children.<br/>
<br/>
LEGUME ANOREXIA<br/>
<br/>
This last identifying feature is perhaps the most unexpected.  Folk<br/>
wisdom is supported by empirical observation--children will rarely<br/>
eat their vegetables (see Popeye, 1957, for review).<br/>
<br/>
Causes of Childhood<br/>
<br/>
Now that we know what it is, what can we say about the causes of<br/>
childhood?  Recent years have seen a flurry of theory and speculation<br/>
from a number of perspectives. Some of the most prominent are reviewed<br/>
below.<br/>
<br/>
Sociological Model<br/>
<br/>
Emile Durkind was perhaps the first to speculate about sociological<br/>
causes of childhood. He points out two key observations about children:<br/>
<br/>
         1.    the vast majority of children are unemployed, and<br/>
<br/>
         2.    children represent one of the least educated segments of<br/>
               our society.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, it has been estimated that less than 20% of children have had<br/>
more than fourth grad education.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, children are an &quot;out-group.&quot; Because of their intellectual<br/>
handicap, children are even denied the right to vote. From the<br/>
sociologist&#39;s perspective, treatment should be aimed at helping<br/>
assimilate children into mainstream society. Unfortunately, some<br/>
victims are so incapacitated by their childhood that they are simply<br/>
not competent to work. One promising rehabilitaion program (Spanky and<br/>
Alfalfa, 1978) has trained victims of severe childhood to sell lemonade.<br/>
<br/>
Biological Model<br/>
<br/>
The observation that childhood is usually present from birth has led<br/>
some to speculate on a biological contribution. An early investigation<br/>
by Flintstone and Jetson (1939) indicated that childhood runs in<br/>
families.  Their survey of over 8,000 American families revealed that<br/>
over half contained more than one child. Further investigation revealed<br/>
that even most non-child family members had experienced childhood at<br/>
some point. Cross-cultural studies (e.g., Mowgli and Din, 1950)<br/>
indicated that family childhood is even more prevalent in the Far East.<br/>
For example, in Indian and Chinese families, as many as three out of<br/>
four family members may have childhood.<br/>
<br/>
Impressive evidence of a genetic component of childhood comes from a<br/>
large-scale twin study by Brady and Partridge (1972). These authors<br/>
studied over 106 pairs of twins, looking at concordance rates for<br/>
childhood. Among identical or monozygotic twins, concordance was<br/>
unusually high (0.92), i.e., when one twin was diagnosed with<br/>
childhood, the other twin was almost always a child as well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Psychological Models<br/>
<br/>
A considerable number of psychologically-based theories of the<br/>
development of childhood exist. They are too numerous to review<br/>
here. Among the more familiar models are Seligman&#39;s &quot;learned<br/>
childishness&quot; model. According to this model, individuals who are<br/>
treated like children eventually give up and become children. As<br/>
a counterpoint to such theories, some experts have claimed that<br/>
childhood does not really exist. Szasz (1980) has called &quot;childhood&quot;<br/>
an expedient label. In seeking conformity, we handicap those whom<br/>
we find unruly or too short to deal with by labelling them &quot;children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Treatment of Childhood<br/>
<br/>
Efforts to treat childhood are as old as the syndrome itself. Only in<br/>
modern times, however, have human and systematic treatment protocols<br/>
been applied.  In part, this increased attention to the problem may be<br/>
due to the sheer number of individuals suffering from childhood.<br/>
<br/>
Government statistics (DHHS) reveal that there are more children alive<br/>
today than at any time in our history. To paraphrase P.T. Barnum:<br/>
&quot;There&#39;s a child born every minute.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The overwhelming number of children has made government intervention<br/>
inevitable. The nineteenth century saw the institution of what remains<br/>
the largest single program for the treatment of childhood-- so-called<br/>
&quot;public schools.&quot; Under this colossal program, individuals are placed<br/>
into treatment groups based on the severity of their condition. For<br/>
example, those most severely afflicted may be placed in a<br/>
&quot;kindergarten&quot; program. Patients at this level are typically short,<br/>
unruly, emotionally immature, and intellectually deficient. Given this<br/>
type of individual, therapy is essentially one of patient management<br/>
and of helping the child master basic skills (e.g. finger-painting).<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the &quot;school&quot; system has been largely ineffective.  Not<br/>
only is the problem a massive tax burden, but it has failed even to<br/>
slow down the rising incidence of childhood.<br/>
<br/>
Faced with this failure and the growing epidemic of childhood,<br/>
mental health professionals are devoting increasing attention<br/>
to the treatment of childhood. Given a theoretical framework by<br/>
Freud&#39;s landmark treatises on childhood, child psychiatrists and<br/>
psychologists claimed great successes in their clinical intervention.<br/>
<br/>
By the 1950&#39;s, however, the clinicians&#39; optimism had waned. Even after<br/>
years of costly analysis, many victims remained children. The following<br/>
case (taken from Gumbie and Poke, 1957) is typical.<br/>
<br/>
*    Billy J., age 8, was brought to treatment by his parents.<br/>
Billy&#39;s affliction was painfully obvious. He stood only 4&#39;3&quot; high<br/>
and weighed a scant 70 lbs., despite the fact that he ate voraciously.<br/>
Billy presented a variety of troubling symptoms. His voice was<br/>
noticably high for a man. He displayed legume anorexia, and, according<br/>
to his parents, often refused to bathe. His intellectual functioning<br/>
was also below normal--he had little general knowledge and could barely<br/>
write a structured sentence. Social skills were also deficient. He often<br/>
spoke inappropriately and exhibited &quot;whining behaviour.&quot; His sexual<br/>
experience was non-existent. Indeed, Billy considered women &quot;icky.&quot; His<br/>
parents reported that his condition had been present from birth,<br/>
improving gradually after he was placed in a school at age 5.<br/>
   The diagnosis was &quot;primary childhood.&quot; After years of painstaking<br/>
treatment, Billy improved gradually. At age 11, his height and weight<br/>
have increased, his social skills are broader, and he is now functional<br/>
enough to hold down a &quot;paper route.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After years of this kind of frustration, startling new evidence has<br/>
come to light which suggests that the prognosis in cases of childhood<br/>
may not be all gloom. A critical review by Fudd (1972) noted that<br/>
studies of the childhood syndrome tend to lack careful follow-up.<br/>
Acting on this observation, Moe, Larrie, and Kirly (1974) began a<br/>
large-scale longitudinal study. These investigators studied two<br/>
groups. The first group consisted of 34 children currently engaged in<br/>
a long-term conventional treatment program. The second was a group of<br/>
42 children receiving no treatment. All subjects had been diagnosed as<br/>
children at least 4 years previously, with a mean duration of<br/>
childhood at 6.4 years.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of one year, the results confirmed the clinical wisdom<br/>
that childhood is a refractory disorder--virtually all symptoms<br/>
persisted and the treatment group was only slightly better off than<br/>
the controls.<br/>
<br/>
The results, however, of a careful 10-year follow-up were startling.<br/>
The investigators (Moe, Larrie, Kirly, & Shemp, 1984) assessed the<br/>
original cohort on a variety of measures. General knowledge and<br/>
emotional maturity were assessed with standard measures. Height was<br/>
assess by the &quot;metric system&quot; (see Ruler, 1923), and legume appetite<br/>
by the Vegetable Appetite Test (VAT) designed by Popeye (1968). Moe<br/>
et al. found that subjects improved uniformly on all measures. Indeed,<br/>
in most cases, the subjects appeared to be symptom-free. Moe et al.<br/>
report a spontaneous remission rate of 95%, a finding which is certain<br/>
to revolutionize the clinical approach to childhood.<br/>
<br/>
These recent results suggests that the prognosis for victims of<br/>
childhood may not be so bad as we have feared. We must not, however,<br/>
become too complacent. Despite its apparently high spontaneous<br/>
remission rate, childhood remains one of the most serious and rapidly<br/>
growing disorders facing mental health professionals today. And, beyond<br/>
the psychological pain it brings, childhood has recently been linked to<br/>
a number of physical disorders. Twenty years ago, Howdi, Doodi, and<br/>
Beauzeau (1965) demonstrated a six-fold increased risk of chicken pox,<br/>
measles, and mumps among children as compared with normal controls.<br/>
Later, Barby and Kenn (1971) linked childhood to an elevated risk of<br/>
accidents--compared with normal adults, victims of childhood were much<br/>
more likely to scrape their knees, lose their teeth, and fall off their<br/>
bikes.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, much more research is need before we can give any real hope<br/>
to the millions of victims wracked by this insidious disorder.<br/>
