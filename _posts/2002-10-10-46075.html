<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761691131">Do you actually want an answer?  Do you actually believe that those who are religious haven&#39;t thought of these questions themselves?  That religious people have just sat there, impassively, allowing words and thoughts to come in without resopnse?<br/>
<br/>
I think that is what aggrevates me...I understand a truth request for information.  What I don&#39;t understand is the attitude of those who seem to imply that those who accept the bible have somehow lost their brains and given no thought to the matter.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I am in a cloud.  Judaism has always encouraged questioning and thought and don&#39;t accept this lightly.  From the time I was young we were encouraged to seek and understanding, not just accept a belief, about what we were learning, and I at least, was never put off by my teachers when I asked an honest question.<br/>

  &gt;   Just the logistics of gathering and loading every species into an <br/>
  ark<br/>
  &gt;   would make it impossible, IMO. Most only live in certain <br/>
  habitats, so<br/>
  &gt;   they&#39;d either have to walk or fly to the ark, or the ark would <br/>
  have to<br/>
  &gt;   make a pretty long trip picking them up.<br/>
<br/>
  They didn&#39;t live in different habitats before the flood.  The <br/>
  atmospheric conditions were much different before the water cycle <br/>
  began than it is now.  <br/>
<br/>
  Then there&#39;s the sheer number of<br/>
  &gt;   different species.There are hundreds of different species of small<br/>
  &gt;   grayish moths. There are hundreds of thousands of different <br/>
  species of<br/>
  &gt;   beetles. If they didn&#39;t evolve, they would have all had to be on <br/>
  the<br/>
  &gt;   ark... <br/>
<br/>
  Probably what some would call micro evolution occurred.  He probably <br/>
  had 2 of the same kind (genus) of every animal, and different species <br/>
  occurred after the flood.  Some animals he was commanded to bring 7 <br/>
  of too.  <br/>
<br/>
  Micro evolution is just different genes being dispersed to offspring <br/>
  in different combinations rather than one type of animal turning into <br/>
  a completely different type of animal (macro evolution)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798454632">My conclusion after many years of seeing what seemed like outright<br/>
disrespect of those who take a literal belief in the Bible is that most<br/>
folks don&#39;t even know how they sound.  For some it&#39;s easier to quiet<br/>
their own doubts to assume that we shut off our brains in order to accept<br/>
the Bible.<br/>
<br/>
Since I was, at one time, on the other side of the fence and did my share<br/>
of scoffing I get a better picture of why it happens.  Faith, even in<br/>
nothing, is hard and often disquieting.  Sometimes scoffing or jokes are<br/>
just outward coping mechanisms.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well... since I was raised Catholic, and many of my questions at Catholic<br/>
school were answered with  statements like, &quot;If you had asked that 500<br/>
years ago you would have been burned at the stake as a heretic&quot;, it&#39;s<br/>
pretty clear to me that at least some religious people don&#39;t ask<br/>
questions. The important thing, the way I was taught, was to have faith,<br/>
and questioning displayed a lack of faith. <br/>
<br/>
And I have learned from this thread - I&#39;ve learned that some bible<br/>
literalists believe that some evolution did happen - Sheila wrote:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Micro evolution is just different genes being dispersed to offspring <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  in different combinations rather than one type of animal turning into <br/>
  a completely different type of animal (macro evolution)&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
But neither of these is actually evolution of any sort - different genes<br/>
being dispersed to offspring is simply normal variation, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
explain how you get a new species (You said he brought two of every<br/>
genus). Neanderthal man and modern humans were in the same genus, as are<br/>
a lot of animals that look very different.<br/>
<br/>
And evolution isn&#39;t about an animal turning into a different kind of<br/>
animal at all, that&#39;s not how it works.<br/>
<br/>
Sheila also wrote:<br/>

<br/>
Is there evidence of this? The atmospheric conditions arebased on things<br/>
like distance from the sun, and that hasn&#39;t changed. And if animals<br/>
didn&#39;t live in different habitats, what habitat did they all live in?<br/>
They *need* different habitats, you couldn&#39;t put a polar bear and a<br/>
howler monkey and a gila monster and an alligator all in the same<br/>
habitat, 3 of them wouldn&#39;t make it - and if they lived in the same<br/>
habitat they would look and *be* different, they would be fit to live in<br/>
that habitat.  <br/>
