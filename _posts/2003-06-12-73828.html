&lt;&lt; I wish I&#39;d known earlier... before I left my shoes out in the rain,<br/>
forgot my yoga class this afternoon and mailed the satellite TV bill to<br/>
the telephone company.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Kirby called me from work and asked for food.  We didn&#39;t have <br/>
anything he loved in the fridge, so I drove to Wendy&#39;s, three miles away , right <br/>
past where he works, to get his favorite meal.  On the way back I was thinking <br/>
dreamily of whether his grandparents have seen where he works, and that when <br/>
Brenda visits we&#39;ll surely go there, since it&#39;s right next to a good used <br/>
bookstore, and see where he works.  HOW NICE, where he works.   I&#39;m so nice to take <br/>
him food.<br/>
<br/>
Then I noticed I was almost home.  So was the food, still on the seat next to <br/>
me.  I had thought SO vividly about where he worked and how perfectly lovely <br/>
it was, that I had fulfilled my urge to go there.  <br/>
<br/>
So I turned around, drove BACK a mile and some, and gave him his lunch.<br/>

This comforts me.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
It&#39;s really funny, but it comforts me. <br/>
