<div id="ygrps-yiv-292112132">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to thank everyone for their great advice and words of<br/>
encouragement.  All of the things that everyone said I agree with.  My heart<br/>
is an unschooler, but my brain is catching on slowly!<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the reasons that I have had such a difficult time with the<br/>
concept of unschooling is because a family that we spend a LOT of time with<br/>
is very traditional in their schooling.  When I see what they are doing I<br/>
feel like we are doing nothing!  I truly need to connect with other<br/>
unschoolers as well.  I have to tell myself the reason I chose to homeschool<br/>
was because I wanted dd to have fun and live a very relaxed childhood.<br/>
Isn&#39;t that what unschooling is?<br/>
<br/>
Any other advice is greatly appreciated.  I am very grateful to have found<br/>
this group.  It has helped me tremendously!<br/>
<br/>
Live life,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Keep on deschooling yourself, Mindy! :o) Your kids are young, your oldest is <br/>
reading (the big anxiety lots of parents give themselves ulcers over), <br/>
you&#39;ve got the time to kick back and relax! Let the unschooling ideas flow <br/>
over and around you. Pretty soon you&#39;ll just float away with them.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;&gt;doing I feel like we are doing nothing!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Stop looking at their schoolwork! Start looking at what those kids are doing <br/>
in their free time. How are they using all those traditional academics? Are <br/>
they incorporating what they &quot;learn&quot; into real, meaningful activities? If <br/>
not, then what&#39;s up with that? Could there be a beter way?<br/>
<br/>
And keep on looking at what your kids like to do and then DO IT! Invite that <br/>
other family along to do something really amazingly cool on a Tuesday <br/>
morning, and then feel sad that they have no time because of schoolwork. <br/>
This happens to us all the time. I&#39;ll never understand missing a trip to <br/>
explore caves because the kids have to practice handwriting. :-P~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I truly need to connect with other unschoolers as well.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Keep connecting here and at www.unschooling.com. It really helps!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I have to tell myself the reason I chose to homeschool was because I <br/>
&gt;&gt;wanted dd to have fun and live a very relaxed childhood.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t that what unschooling is?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For me it&#39;s that and even more. It&#39;s about learning because there&#39;s <br/>
something you want to know. It&#39;s about keeping that spark alive that all <br/>
children are born with. It&#39;s about keeping a child whole.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Live life,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YES! Unschooling is also about allowing children to live life right now. Not <br/>
making them prepare for 12 years to start living.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
