<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603675645">One of my proudest moments in mothering is when Rowan got kicked out of swim<br/>
class, at age 4, because he kept dropping off the wall and swimming circles<br/>
around the teacher&#39;s legs. She got angry that he was swimming instead of<br/>
listening to instructions, so she threw him out of the class. I love being<br/>
able to say that he got thrown out of swim class for swimming too much. =)<br/>
And even at that stage, Rowan got how completely ridiculous the whole<br/>
situation was. What&#39;s funny is that Jason and I were totally proud of him<br/>
for the swimming he was doing, and the parents on the bleachers around us<br/>
were seriously encouraging us to reprimand him and &quot;make him go back into<br/>
class.&quot; Um... if the point is to teach him to swim, and he&#39;s swimming, then<br/>
what&#39;s the point? Oh yeah. Compliance. Riiiiiiiiiiiight.<br/>

That was also the absolutely definitive moment when I realized that there<br/>
was no way school and/or schoolish environments were going to work for us.<br/>

The best swimmer of my three kids is Holly, who didn&#39;t take lessons.   <br/>
She played with friends who had a pool at their apartments, and  <br/>
played with Marty on family outings, and with her dad.  The boys took  <br/>
lessons.  Kirby doesn&#39;t enjoy it, and Marty learned more by being  <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a classic.<br/>
<br/>
Reminds me of when my son was nine and playing baseball at that time.<br/>
He joined a midweek &quot;after school&quot; kids baseball clinic. When we<br/>
arrived at the first session, it turned out they were going to play<br/>
T-ball. So Pat refused to play and walked off the field. The coach<br/>
came after him and talk about pressure to comply - we&#39;re all here to<br/>
have fun together and the rest. So Pat said, &quot;I&#39;m not playing T-ball.&quot;<br/>
I was so, so proud of him. I would never have done that when I was his<br/>
age. I would have complied immediately! And my parents would have<br/>
backed up the coach as well. So I said to the coach, &quot;He doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to play T-ball&quot; and took Pat home. So many times my children have<br/>
brought out qualities in me I didn&#39;t know I had until they came along. :)</div>

 </span></blockquote>I took my daughter (8) to Mommy and Me swim classes when she was 2.  It <br/>
turned out to be a disaster.  At the end of the third day, the <br/>
instructor took each child from their mom and dunked them under water.  <br/>
When it was my daughter&#39;s turn, she was screaming and hanging on to <br/>
me.  He yanked her from me and dunked her under water.  then he <br/>
informed the parents that they children would be dunked again on the <br/>
last (fifth) day.  On the fourth day, my daughter would not even go <br/>
into the pool.  Everytime the instructor even looked at her, she began <br/>
screaming.  I informed him that we would not be coming on the last day, <br/>
but he wanted us to come and for me to get her back in the water on the <br/>
other side, away from the class.  I did, but it was wasted time.  It <br/>
would have been better if I had taken her to a completely different <br/>
pool.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter became extremely afraid of water to the point that she had <br/>
bad dreams and would not go into the bathtub. She gradually lost her <br/>
fear of bathtubs and small wading pools, but was still scared of big <br/>
swimming pools.  Last summer, we spent a lot of time at my sister-in-<br/>
laws house (she has a pool).  My daughter learned to swim with a little <br/>
help from her 5 year old cousin.  She got brave enough to put her whole <br/>
head under water, and by the end of summer, was swimming under water.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781422898">This isn&#39;t quite the same thing, but some children in our neighborhood are told to  &quot;go <br/>
outside and play.&quot;  This means that when they come to our door, to see if my dd wants to <br/>
play, they can&#39;t step foot inside--the have to play outside.  When this new rule went into <br/>
effect, they pulled up our porch chairs and huddled by the open window to watch my son <br/>
play WOW.  I&#39;m not sure, but I think their mom got wise and put an end to that.  Maybe now <br/>
there is a rule that they must keep moving!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179403563">From babyhood, Michelle was unhappy in the water. She&#39;d scream in the  <br/>
bath, so I would give her sponge baths only. As she got older, she  <br/>
gradually got more comfortable and would have baths (sometimes 3 or 4  <br/>
a day &lt;g&gt;) and liked warm pools, but would not go under the water. She  <br/>
didn&#39;t like the water in her eyes. But at about age 6, I offered  <br/>
lessons and she thought she&#39;d like to take them because her  <br/>
homeschooling friends were going to be there.<br/>
<br/>
One of the first things the instructor had the kids in the class do  <br/>
was put their faces in the water. That was not going to fly with  <br/>
Michelle and she balked, soon dissolving into defensiveness and tears.  <br/>
I was right there and asked her if she wanted to stop. She said yes,  <br/>
so I took her out to the other, non-lesson pool. The instructor came  <br/>
over to me to say that Michelle *had* to put her face in the water to  <br/>
continue in the lessons and &quot;learn to swim&quot;. I told her Michelle  <br/>
wanted to be happy in the water and if she was currently afraid to put  <br/>
her face in the water, I was not going to make her do it. The  <br/>
instructor shrugged and went back to the class.<br/>
<br/>
We tried a couple more sessions, provided at private home pools, but  <br/>
we bailed out of those, too. Instead, whenever we traveled, we&#39;d find  <br/>
a hotel with a pool. We&#39;d spend lots of time in the water with her,  <br/>
just playing, using floatie things. We bought her a swim mask (the  <br/>
kind you use to go snorkeling) and she soon went happily underwater  <br/>
with it.  Since then, she&#39;s been like a little fish and can&#39;t wait to  <br/>
get into a pool. She still uses her mask, still likes floatie things  <br/>
at 13.<br/>
<br/>
It took patience, opportunity and the enjoyment of wherever she was in  <br/>
her swimming journey. Sort of like how she learned to read &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
