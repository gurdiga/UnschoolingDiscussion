If *she* feels she is needing more social time then you can help her find<br/>
some friends with the same interests and invite them over to play as often<br/>
as she needs them.  You could start a themed club (crafts, horses, dance,<br/>
etc)and post it on a local homeschooling list and see what kind of response<br/>
you get.  You could go to some homeschool support meetings and tell people<br/>
you are looking to find friends for your dd.  You could join after school<br/>
activities and hope to meet some local kids.  There are all sorts of ways to<br/>
find friends for your children without sending them to school.  <br/>

<br/>
There are a few good social aspects for school when a kid is lucky, and MANY very negative social aspects even for the luckiest.  <br/>
<br/>
If by &quot;social aspects&quot; you mean playing with other kids, there are other kids in girl scouts, dance classes, soccer teams, 4-H, parks, McDonalds&#39; playgrounds, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt you&#39;re talking about dealing with bullies or snooty kids who giggle behind their hands and then laugh and walk away.  I doubt you&#39;re talking about dealing with mean teachers who put kids down without even noticing they do it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I had a pretty great time in school, but I remember lots of sad, bad times.  For some reason you have your daughter at home, so move toward what you envision, don&#39;t envision back toward school as an ideal.  It will always be there if you change your mind, but try the non-school world fully before you think school could do better.<br/>
<br/>
Step away from the school. If you can still see it out of the corner of your eye, you&#39;re too close.  If you&#39;re still comparing her to your mind&#39;s eye&#39;s image of a perfect schoolkid, you&#39;re still too close.<br/>
