<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313067392">I am repulsed, personally, by the series of Whatever for Dummies books.    If <br/>
the topic I most wanted to know about in the world was only available in that <br/>
format, I wouldn&#39;t buy the book.   I know I haven&#39;t put a dent in their <br/>
profits. &lt;g&gt;   It&#39;s personal.   I think people having been called and having <br/>
thought of themselves as &quot;dumb&quot; is deeply sad and pervasive in our culture, from <br/>
schools, from parents, from other kids, neighbors, relatives, strangers.    <br/>
Having it in dark black on yellow bookcovers in nice bookstores makes it worse.    <br/>
&quot;Come buy this, you DUMMY!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I might be the only one who feels that way.<br/>
<br/>
Undoubtedly there are millions of people who have bought a book or two from <br/>
that series who are confident and whole and never even in their moments of <br/>
half-sleepfulness think they&#39;re dummies in any way.   <br/>
<br/>
So because of all that personal emotional swirl, I believe there are probably <br/>
some people who respond viscerally to the titles of &quot;What your Third Grader <br/>
Needs to Know&quot; and its setmates.   I don&#39;t have an adverse reaction, because <br/>
I&#39;ve never had &quot;a third grader&quot; and I&#39;m clear, waking and sleeping, that there&#39;s <br/>
more in the world than anyone can ever know, and my kids are getting all they <br/>
need and more.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also lived and shared the idea that not finishing something is PERFECT, <br/>
that dropping projects or setting them on shelves or back burners or in <br/>
trashbins is way okay.   So the idea of &quot;a checklist&quot; doesn&#39;t act as an anchor on my <br/>
soul either.   I really like magazine articles like &quot;fifty ways to find more <br/>
storage in your kitchen&quot; or &quot;the ten most important movies of all time&quot; or <br/>
whatever.   I just like them for fun, not as tests or measures.   And a list of <br/>
what kindergarteners need to know is just another one of those for me.<br/>
<br/>
If I had to choose betwee the Hirsch books and our South Park videos and CDs, <br/>
I&#39;d keep South Park.   But I don&#39;t have to choose, so I&#39;m keeping both.    I <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; read, watch, care about, learn or finish any of them.<br/>
