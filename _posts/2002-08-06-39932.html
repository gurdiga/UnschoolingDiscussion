But - my point is that it isn&#39;t the &#39;funding source&#39; of the school that I <br/>
object to or that John Holt was writing about - it isn&#39;t because the public <br/>
schools are government-schools. My objections to &quot;schooling&quot; are just as much <br/>
relevant to private schools and to parents who use similar or even worse <br/>
method on their own kids at home.<br/>
<br/>

my limited experience) are exactly as you described.  The parochial <br/>
schools use the same boring textbooks as the public schools (they go in <br/>
on the purchase orders together) and then they throw in the extra <br/>
religion class.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to come to the CA conference that many of you will be at but <br/>
I&#39;m stuck in Nebraska.  :-(<br/>

out Southwest&#39;s rates!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I know - maybe too late for the Sacramento conference -- but maybe the South <br/>
Carolina one or the one in Houston?  I said I couldn&#39;t go to them, when the  <br/>
air rates were higher - but now I&#39;m reconsidering!!!<br/>
