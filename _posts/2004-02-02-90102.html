<br/>
       Imo unschoolers believe kids will learn what they need and want, when <br/>
they need and want it, UNLESS someone screws it all up for them. Unschooling <br/>
is no absolute guarantee but certainly neither is school (see above) so it <br/>
comes down to doing the best you can and making the most of the journey.<br/>
<br/>
       OTOH, if you&#39;re asking specifically for an explanation of the <br/>
statistical claims about millions of illiterate adults, that&#39;s a whole other kettle of <br/>
fish. There are many varying &quot;definitions&quot; of literacy, and significant <br/>
numbers of people for whom English isn&#39;t their first -- or even a current -- <br/>
language but whose comprehension skills are measured in English anyway for the <br/>
purpose of such statistics, and people with all sorts of disadvantages and <br/>
disabilities and major illnesses (not counting unschooling or schooling as any of <br/>
these btw!) and even varying definitions of &quot;adult.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I taught, I saw 15 year olds who couldn&#39;t read -- <br/>
our &quot;assessment&quot; of them (based on previous experience and made in <br/>
private) was that they probably wouldn&#39;t learn.  I worked with some <br/>
pretty good reading teachers (an oxymoron, perhaps, but I mean in the <br/>
schooling sense) -- they spent time after school with students, they <br/>
tried not to shame them, they really tried to build on successes.  <br/>
But when I watched these students, whenever printed words were <br/>
brought out (as they are so often in school -- instructions, letters <br/>
to the home, report cards, lunch menus -- nearly everything is <br/>
printed), they didn&#39;t bring out their limited reading skills, they <br/>
brought out their defense and survival skills.  They might ask the <br/>
teacher, ask a friend, look around for cues, blow it off, doodle, <br/>
start &quot;acting out,&quot; -- whatever.  They didn&#39;t bother looking at the <br/>
paper (unless their strategy was to pretend to read) -- they&#39;d <br/>
learned long ago that what they needed to survive wasn&#39;t going to be <br/>
there.  <br/>
<br/>
So when all the cognitive processes *did* start to come together in <br/>
their brains and they would have been ready to read if they&#39;d been <br/>
left alone, everyone missed it.  The defenses were too high, <br/>
the &quot;skills&quot; they had so far were too laborious, the work was too far <br/>
removed from anything they cared about.  And so they left my school <br/>
and high school not just unable to read, but defined by that -- many <br/>
of these kids could do things that I couldn&#39;t (fix cars, dance hip <br/>
hop, farm land, etc.) but a good part of their life had been spent on <br/>
focusing on what they were told they couldn&#39;t do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d really wanted to be with kids and &quot;help&quot; kids when I went into <br/>
teaching, but schools are not the place to do those things.<br/>
<br/>

can you explain the Millions of Americans that cant read? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But they are able to LEARN how to read......they just don&#39;t believe it<br/>
anymore....or have been shamed into thinking they are stupid.<br/>
<br/>
My ds is teaching himself to read at age 10.  He went to Kindergarten for 3<br/>
months....within those 3 months, he didn&#39;t learn to read at age 5 so his<br/>
teacher wanted him to repeat K.  That would hav started the process of Zach<br/>
seeing himself as &quot;less than&quot;......as it was I messed him up by trying to do<br/>
Kindergarten at home.<br/>
<br/>
Zach got so freaked out that I was asking him to do something that he<br/>
obviously wasn&#39;t ready for that he refused to look at a book for about 3<br/>
years.  During those years, I read anything he asked me to for him,<br/>
directions to games, TV guide, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Then he discovered the world of 10 yo boys and Yu-Gi-Oh.   Not exactly cool<br/>
to have to run to mom before you make your play, hard to remember what each<br/>
monster does....it was worth it to learn to read.<br/>

tested until they&#39;re 16-17. After that, you&#39;d be hard pressed to know <br/>
if someone can or cannot read. Still, there is also the case of the <br/>
functionally illiterate, people who pass those exams as &#39;readers&#39;. <br/>
Tests and assessments are very, very, misleading.<br/>

<br/>
A good way to make someone hates something is to make them do it.<br/>
<br/>
A good way to make sure someone is certain they can&#39;t do something is to<br/>
humiliate them when they try.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about not doing any of that. It&#39;s about the child having<br/>
pleasant experiences with text: reading what and when the child wants. No<br/>
pressure to read by a particular age. No humiliation. No standards about<br/>
what the child should read. There&#39;s no outside agenda.<br/>

A kid with a copy of Nintendo Power in school would probably have it <br/>
confiscated.<br/>
We paid for Kirby&#39;s and helped him keep them organized.  We got him a <br/>
library-style magazine cover so that his current issue was in heavy plastic, and when <br/>
the next one came he transfered the old issue into the file box.<br/>
<br/>
A child in school wanting to do a book report on something he read online or <br/>
in a comic book or on a video game or text-based role playing game would be <br/>
told that wasn&#39;t really reading.<br/>
<br/>
It is.<br/>

You may find it fascinating to learn that America&#39;s 17th president, <br/>
Andrew Johnson (1808-1875), was taught to read and write by his <br/>
WIFE!!!!!  <br/>
<br/>
He married her when he was 19 (1827) and when he was 22 (1830) years <br/>
old he was elected the mayor of Greeneville, Tennessee.   <br/>
<br/>
He was known as a brave, thoughtful and intelligent man that was <br/>
popular with the &quot;common&quot; people.   So much so that when Abraham <br/>
Lincoln(R) ran for re-election in 1864, the man he picked as his vice-<br/>
president was Andrew Johnson(D).<br/>
<br/>
Most historians will agree that his impeachment was not due to <br/>
presidential incompetence, but was the loss of a political fight with <br/>
the US congress over aspects of the reconstruction of a war torn <br/>
country.<br/>
<br/>
Who is to say that someone who learns to read after the age of 9 is <br/>
doomed to be a failure in life???   There are many famous people in <br/>
history who were late on the learning curve.<br/>
<br/>
We have a friend whose son was an academic whiz and they had high <br/>
hopes of him pursuing some great degree and becoming a <br/>
big &quot;somebody.&quot;   They were very disappointed when he dropped out of <br/>
a very prestigious college and took up a job at a fast-food <br/>
restaurant.   He was burnt out on the rat race and wanted life to <br/>
slow down.    Even though their relationship with him is getting <br/>
better there is still a lot of tension.   <br/>
<br/>
Both of these stories have elements of success or failure depending <br/>
upon personal perceptions and expectations.    I choose to see both <br/>
as success stories.<br/>
