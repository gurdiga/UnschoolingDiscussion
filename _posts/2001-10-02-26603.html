<div id="ygrps-yiv-930172535">Hey Nance, <br/>
I&#39;ve ordered the book through my local library here in Toronto. I&#39;m excited, the books title and the authors name are great already. <br/>
Thanks for your help and encouragement.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Great!  And there are a lot of other choices in math reading.  Maybe your <br/>
library has others.  Math is fun and I&#39;d hate to see someone turned off to it <br/>
because they are just  using the wrong material.  <br/>
<br/>
Our latest &quot;math project&quot; involved figuring out how much wrapping paper we <br/>
needed to wrap Dad&#39;s birthday gift -- a 20&#39; flag pole.  The answer:  LOTS!!<br/>
<br/>
Later.<br/>
