<div id="ygrps-yiv-860112509"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; &gt; I have no faith that someone who doesn&#39;t know me OR my children will<br/>
 </span></blockquote>know what they need to know. I *DO* know that Cameron&#39;s friends are having a<br/>
really hard time in high school now---and I&#39;m NOT talking academically:<br/>
they&#39;re all &quot;passing&quot; their classes. They&#39;re having a hard time emotionally,<br/>
spiritually (not Christian-based---but in their own hearts---the &quot;breath&quot;<br/>
part of spiritual), socially, economically---not to mention<br/>
relationship-wise with their families and with the world. They have no<br/>
direction. No passions. NOTHING. They&#39;re empty. My unschooled teen is RICH<br/>
with ALL those things. I have all the proof *I* need. I usually just wave my<br/>
hand and say that the proof is in the pudding. And I&#39;m a patient cook. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I am a very patient reader of the digest versions of this inspired and<br/>
inspiring list for years - don&#39;t seem to get a chance to post often, but<br/>
would like to thank every one who does for their questions and their answers<br/>
and their meandering pondering - it uplifts me daily.<br/>
<br/>
And the above paragraph of Kelly&#39;s is brilliant! I really want to take a<br/>
quick moment to laud her for it.<br/>
<br/>
This is, far and away, the hugest reason for unschooling that I can possibly<br/>
imagine. . .having teens who defy every stereotype about teens that the<br/>
modern world can configure. . .actually having relationships with your teens<br/>
that are mutually respectful and gratifying, and downright fun! (now that<br/>
they can finally grok my sense of humor!) . . .having whole teens who are<br/>
not shut down, toughened up and angry. . .who are involved and caring and<br/>
kind. . .whose interests are vast and varied . . .and . . .I could go on,<br/>
but the proof is in the pudding, for sure. <br/>
<br/>
Those of you reading this with little ones - firstly, ENJOY! - it is a very<br/>
very short path . . .and be prepared to have relationships that are<br/>
marvelous and enriching with those children when they are teens, unlike what<br/>
the &quot;world&quot; tells you will happen when they are teens.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite moments was when my children were encouraging me to find<br/>
another way in my future in order not to work so hard and my youngest son,<br/>
Bay, suggested that I write a book . . .&quot;about what,&quot; I inquired . . .pause.<br/>
. .&quot;The title could be &#39;How to Have Children Who Really Like You!&quot; was his<br/>
answer.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh. The pudding.<br/>
<br/>
In aloha,<br/>

Well, thank you, Lee---and for pulling it out as one of the *many* inspirational ones written by others on this list! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Huge reason for me, too---but I  didn&#39;t know that when we started. That was a big, unexpected side-benefit! And it seems across-the-board true too! *None* of teh nschooled teens I&#39;ve met come with that baggage.<br/>

Unschooled teens are NOTHING like the rest I see everywhere. NOTHING.<br/>
