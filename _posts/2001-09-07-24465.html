<div id="ygrps-yiv-899685915">Like I said originally you are entitled to your opinions I just think that making fun of others for what they may believe to be the right way to live is not a very polite way of carrying on a conversation.  What you or I may believe as far as obeying isn&#39;t really the point here......its more the fact that you felt the need to ridicule someone who may believe in that lifestyle.  That was my point.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wanna know what I think? Well, okay,maybe you don&#39;t but here goes anyway. It <br/>
didnt&#39; seem to me she was making fun or ridiculing. . . looked to me more <br/>
like her telling her opinion in her own way, and not being politically <br/>
correct about it. . . I don&#39;t call that ridicule, I call that &quot;Sandra Dodd <br/>
Honesty&quot;.  It may put me off for a minute, but when I re-read and ponder <br/>
there is always something there to consider and chew on. Things that push our <br/>
buttons really have a lot of opportunity for us if we can only open our eyes.<br/>

Honesty&quot;.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oops.  I was invoked in a defense of insulting Christians.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not a lot of sense in discussing with serious, practicing <br/>
fundamentalists about the details of their religion unless you can quote <br/>
Bible verses back at them.  If a woman believes in and practices &#39;surrender&#39; <br/>
and obedience and all that, there&#39;s no sense insulting it.  It is difficult <br/>
for unschooling to cohabitate with such choices, true.  It&#39;s a common pattern <br/>
for structured Christian homeschoolers to consider the husband the <br/>
superintendant of the home school, and the mother the teacher.  For many of <br/>
those families obedience is the #1 priority:  child&#39;s obedience to mother, <br/>
mother&#39;s obedience to husband, husband&#39;s obedience to God.<br/>
<br/>
Having been Baptist and known (been related to, too) lots of fundamentalists, <br/>
I know they&#39;re sincere, I know they have a large support base, and they think <br/>
they&#39;re doing the one true right thing.<br/>
<br/>
But there are resources for Christian unschoolers, and there are unschoolers <br/>
even among some of the staunchest Bible-believing Christians.  They do <br/>
re-phrase some of the jargon to be Bible-friendly.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>
