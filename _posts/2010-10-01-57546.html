<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048026255">My son is 7.  <br/>
<br/>
So, today at the bank, I was just doing an atm withdrawal and I didn&#39;t need to go inside.  My son said he wanted a lollipop.  I said that I didn&#39;t have anything to go inside for and I offered him the lollipop I had in my bag.  <br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t like the flavor and was a little nasty about it.  Like I was offering him something yucky.<br/>
<br/>
I offered to take him home and get a lollipop.  He said he didn&#39;t want to go home.  I thought in my head &quot;how can I get him a lollipop?&quot; and while I was thinking this, he starts whining and crying.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be honest with you.  I don&#39;t like the whining, I don&#39;t like the <br/>
crying, and I get a bit irritated when he doesn&#39;t trust me to help get him what he wants.  His knee-jerk reaction is to cry and maybe whine.<br/>
<br/>
I responded in an angry way that I&#39;d rather not repeat, but I&#39;m at a loss as for what to replace it with and I would really appreciate your views. <br/>
<br/>
thank you.  Lisa</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-796685419">I am confused by why you&#39;d have found it easier to go home than to go inside the bank to get him a lollypop?  also, if he whines and cries and  doesn&#39;t trust that you will help him, you might examine *that* - take it as communication of something...maybe next time, instead of *thinking* &quot;how can I get him a lollypop&quot;  - SAY it out loud   then he will know for certain you want to help.  <br/>
what did you feel angry about specifically?  it can help to deconstruct your thought patterns and identify what was pushing your buttons.  what were you telling yourself about his whining or about his wanting a lollypop?<br/>

lollipop? (I&#39;m assuming they give them away in there and he knew it, right?)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-398664034">You could go in the bank and have him ask a teller nicely if he could have a<br/>
lollipop.  I know you have no business inside the bank but I don&#39;t think<br/>
they would mind.  They would probably think it&#39;s cute.  I learned over time<br/>
to go outside my comfort zone to make my kids happy if it didn&#39;t hurt anyone<br/>
else.  You are a member of that bank and they do give them out for free.<br/>
You could say something light, like, My son wants to know if he still gets a<br/>
free lollipop when we use the atm?  And smile.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;d give it to<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But honestly, I don&#39;t like whining either.  When my kids were little, I&#39;d<br/>
ask them to rephrase it without whining  if I knew that I&#39;d be feeling<br/>
resentment at doing something.  I was up front with them and just stated it<br/>
like a fact.when you ask me in that voice, it doesn&#39;t make me want to get it<br/>
for you.  I&#39;d be happy to get it for you if you ask me in a nice voice.<br/>
When I was matter of fact about it, it didn&#39;t escalate things and it didn&#39;t<br/>
take long at all before they knew that if they asked nicely, I&#39;d do my best<br/>
to find a way to get them what they wanted.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But it was that trust that really made the difference.  Once they KNEW that<br/>
I always tried to find a way to meet their needs, they became less needy and<br/>
less whiney.<br/>

Even, I&#39;d bet, if you aren&#39;t a customer of theirs. (Can you imagine a  <br/>
bank with a policy that might turn away potential customers over the  <br/>
price of a lollipop?)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m suspecting he didn&#39;t so much need a lollipop as the bank brought  <br/>
it to mind. Haven&#39;t you ever wanted something special as part of an  <br/>
event or part of a routine?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Try seeing him as helpless. (Which he is.) Nearly everything he wants  <br/>
and needs he has to go through you. He&#39;s wants and needs are at the  <br/>
mercy of your decision. You might decide it&#39;s too much trouble. You  <br/>
might decide he doesn&#39;t need it. You might decide it&#39;s inconvenient  <br/>
right now and he has to wait. You might decide it&#39;s too expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Picture living your life like that. Everything you want and need, is  <br/>
at the mercy of your husband&#39;s decision. And sometimes his decisions  <br/>
and explanations don&#39;t make much sense to you. (I&#39;m sure your son  <br/>
couldn&#39;t imagine a reason you couldn&#39;t walk into the bank and ask for  <br/>
a lollipop like you&#39;ve done before.)<br/>
<br/>
The more generous you are with your time and effort now, the more  <br/>
generous your son will be when you&#39;re old and confined to bed at the  <br/>
mercy of other&#39;s compassionate willingness to make their life more  <br/>
difficult to make your life a little easier! ;-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See kids reactions as communication. *You* think you&#39;re trustworthy to  <br/>
meet his needs but he doesn&#39;t and he&#39;s going to respond to *his*  <br/>
perception of the world not to your intentions. The whining is his way  <br/>
of trying to meet his need since you can&#39;t (yet) be trusted.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a good way! It&#39;s undoubtedly often counterproductive for him!  <br/>
But instead of seeing him as deliberately using a tool you dont&#39; like,  <br/>
see him as needing help. Trust that he&#39;s doing the best he can with  <br/>
the tools and understanding of the world he has and he needs help  <br/>
getting his needs met.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than trying to pry that tool out of his hands and forcibly  <br/>
replace it with someone else, you use a better tool. (Though first,  <br/>
see what you can do to anticipate his needs and respond in a way that  <br/>
earns his trust so he doesn&#39;t need to resort to the tool.)<br/>
<br/>
Some kids do whine. And if you are working hard at meeting his needs,  <br/>
*then* you can say &quot;I can&#39;t understand you. If you speak calmly I can  <br/>
help you better.&quot; (Make it about you meeting his needs rather than  <br/>
about him meeting your needs to not hear whining.)<br/>
<br/>
And often when kids are at their worst, what they need most is a  <br/>
hug. :-)<br/>

You could have taken him into the bank, if they have lollipops, and  <br/>
asked for one.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So, today at the bank, I was just doing an atm withdrawal and I  <br/>

<br/>
You could have gone inside for a lollipop.<br/>
If there was a drive-through, maybe you could have used that instead  <br/>
of the ATM, and asked for a lollipop there.<br/>
<br/>
If you were outside a place that sold cold drinks and you wanted one,  <br/>
and your husband or friend (that would be soon-to-be-EX-friend, I  <br/>
think) offered you a bottle of warm water that was already in the car,  <br/>
or an old half a bottle of juice or soda from their backpack, I don&#39;t  <br/>
think you would feel loved.  You might even whine and cry.  But you  <br/>
would be old enough to get out of the car and go in and get your own  <br/>
cold drink.  Your son is not, yet.<br/>
<br/>
You asked for help with your reaction, but I think backing up more to  <br/>
your action (which would have prevented your child&#39;s reaction AND your  <br/>
reaction) is more important.<br/>
<br/>
Very often people come to discussions such as this one asking what to  <br/>
do in response to a child&#39;s unreasonable actions, but seen in the  <br/>
light of radical unschooling, the child&#39;s actions were perfectly  <br/>
sensible responses to something arbitrary the parent was trying to  <br/>
enforce for leftover reasons.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;I get a bit irritated when he doesn&#39;t trust me to help get him what  <br/>

<br/>
You just explained to us that you did NOT help him get what he wanted-- <br/>
a lollipop from the bank. And you were still (I presume) right outside  <br/>
the bank, or in the parking lot.<br/>
Perhaps you have defined your actions in ways that protect your own  <br/>
feelings, at the expense of your child&#39;s feelings.   You were right,  <br/>
and he should have trusted that you DO help him get what he wants, you  <br/>
seem to be saying.<br/>
<br/>
But the story itself, as you told it, showed that you were not  <br/>
trustworthy, and should not have been irritated with him.<br/>
<br/>
What it shows is a lack of partnership.  Antagonism was there.  You  <br/>
were irritated.  He was MORE irritated.  Your team lost.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I like to share something about this trust thing. Long before I became a<br/>
unschooling parent I was a regular &quot;control freak always saying NO first&quot;<br/>
parent. My daughter who is now 9 years old faced my ugly parenting for<br/>
almost four years. It has been five years since I have been changing my ways<br/>
and always try to say and do affirmative things and avoid &quot;NO&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Yet the reaction &quot;NO&quot; is so damaging that even today I see her hesitating<br/>
before asking for something as simple as an ice cream.  It shatters my heart<br/>
to look at her face.<br/>
<br/>
The power of NO is very hard to wear off. But if we practice YES, the child<br/>
becomes self assured, confident and secure human being.<br/>
<br/>
The choice is for you to make. YES or NO.<br/>
<br/>
For older kids you can try and say &quot;sure baby I will get it for you or do it<br/>
for you, but it would be great if we could wait till....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But to get there, try and say YES as much as you can now.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045801064">-=-I did not WANT to go in the bank though. I wanted to use the ATM  <br/>

<br/>
It seems you&#39;re stamping your feet now because we didn&#39;t defend your  <br/>
stamping your feet that day.<br/>
<br/>
There is always a genetic component in biological children, and  <br/>
psychologists/psychiatrists have said for 100 years or more that  <br/>
parents are sometimes sharply bothered by behaviors in their children  <br/>
that are the most like their own bad traits.  Partly, and especially  <br/>
with unschooling, it could be, it&#39;s because of a deep, subconscious  <br/>
jealousy that our child is getting what we didn&#39;t get, or a vague  <br/>
early memory of having gotten in trouble for doing that same thing the  <br/>
child is doing.<br/>
<br/>
If your mother EVER said no to you about a lollipop or anything  <br/>
similar, consider that you might not have cleaned early-childhood  <br/>
house, and that&#39;s affecting your happiness and that of your son.  If  <br/>
so, that&#39;s probably affecting the happiness of your marriage and  <br/>
larger family, too.  Each bit of memory you can dredge up, turn over,  <br/>
and let dry in the sun of adult awareness will clear out space for you  <br/>
to patient and loving with yourself, your inner child, and your  <br/>
offspring.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do you guys always do exactly what your children want when they  <br/>
want it?-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We guys&quot; cannot answer as a group.  For me, I do not now and did not  <br/>
then &quot;do exactly what your children want when they want it,&quot; and  <br/>
unless I&#39;m misreading you, there&#39;s an insult there.  If we say &quot;yes,&quot;  <br/>
then we&#39;re something.  Doormats?  Pushovers?  If we say &quot;no,&quot; then you  <br/>
might think &quot;WELL then; I was right.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Neither of those is right or good.  Neither extreme is balance.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do you guys always do exactly what your children want when they  <br/>
want it?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I did when my children were younger and I do now that they are 18, 21  <br/>
and 24, do what my children want if I can, and as soon as I can, if  <br/>
it&#39;s something useful, non-harmful, fun and that leads to learning,  <br/>
especially.  I *always* pause and make sure I&#39;m not being selfish if I  <br/>
feel a whine or objection building up in me.  It took a few years to  <br/>
get solidly there, but I started intentionally getting there when  <br/>
Kirby was a baby and only child.  If people had fed me the traditional  <br/>
&quot;they&#39;re just kids; you&#39;re the adult&quot; stuff when they were young, we  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have the relationship we have today.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Is every request to be fulfilled?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s simple and reasonable, why not?  If you can afford it, why  <br/>
not?  A free lollipop would only have cost you time and a little  <br/>
patience, and it would be good practice for you to do something  <br/>
selfless that involves patience; it will make it easier the next time,  <br/>
and even easier the third time, and soon you will lose track of  <br/>
counting how many times you were soft and calm and patient.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Is there never a time when you say &quot;It would be easier for me to  <br/>
do it this way and that&#39;s how I am going to do it&quot; .. ?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Never.  Not in those terms.  Not &quot;and that&#39;s how I am going to do  <br/>
it.&quot;  Not to someone I love.  Not to my husband, not to my kids.  I  <br/>
might explain why I think another way would be easier, and because I  <br/>
have been patient countless times, they&#39;re very likely to be patient  <br/>
and accepting (soft and calm and selfless) with me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also, I think that whining and crying everytime you don&#39;t get your  <br/>
way and don&#39;t get what you want is behavior that should be discouraged- <br/>
=-<br/>
<br/>
Clearly you do.  And you want us all to think so, too, even though our  <br/>
children aren&#39;t whining and crying as much as yours is (possibly).<br/>
<br/>
-=-I read stuff from Sandra all the time that says that she  <br/>

Please, not for the good of me or the list, but for the good of your  <br/>
son, read every one of them again slowly, breathing calmly, thinking  <br/>
perhaps you missed something the first time.  The suggestion was made  <br/>
several times that perhaps you were wrong and your son was right.    <br/>
Whining and crying is no worse than a mom saying no when a yes was  <br/>
immediately at hand.<br/>
<br/>
I have and still do &quot;discourage certain behavior&quot; in my children, but  <br/>
we have long been at the very-fine-tuning stages of that.<br/>
<br/>
This example is evidence on MY side, though.  Notes below.<br/>
<br/>
====================<br/>
<br/>
Here is an example. This is a quote from Sandra on a past post. I see  <br/>
whining and crying when you don&#39;t get your way right up there with  <br/>
throwing a fit when you lose a game or gloating when you win.<br/>
<br/>
++++_____++++++ There&#39;s a young adult in my life (friend of my kids,  <br/>
not one of mine)<br/>
and I forgot that I intended to avoid playing with her. She isn&#39;t fun<br/>
anymore if it looks like she&#39;s not going to win. She&#39;s nowhere near<br/>
four years old. I don&#39;t need &quot;creative ways for multiple [people]<br/>
to win; I need to avoid being at the gaming table with her. Maybe<br/>
she&#39;ll change, but I won&#39;t. I don&#39;t like to be made to feel guilty,<br/>
and I would rather throw the game than deal with a childish<br/>
reaction. The problem with some people like that is if you throw the<br/>
game they get just as angry as if you legitimately win. The only way<br/>
for ME to win is either to work hard to win, but lose and accept the<br/>
gloating.<br/>
<br/>
That behavior should&#39;ve been discouraged years ago, by someone besides<br/>
me. All I can do is avoid the games.<br/>
+++++++++++++---------++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
================================================<br/>
<br/>
That wasn&#39;t an unschooler.  That wasn&#39;t one of my children.  That is  <br/>
someone who spends more time at my house than at her parents&#39; house.   <br/>
That is someone who is not honest with her parents and stopped being  <br/>
honest with them a dozen years or more ago.  Her parents tease her and  <br/>
criticize her.    I gave that as a bad example.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to continue being critical of your son and defensive of  <br/>
your selfish stance, you&#39;re headed toward that girl&#39;s life, not my  <br/>
children&#39;s lives.<br/>
<br/>
Your relationship with your son should be more important than which  <br/>
lollipop is which.  You and he are not the same age.  You don&#39;t have  <br/>
the same awareness or responsibility.  If you are a team (which is  <br/>
what you need to work toward for unschooling to work as it&#39;s described  <br/>
on this list), then you *will* do most of the work and the bending and  <br/>
fetching for a while.  And when he&#39;s older, IF you&#39;re a team, he will  <br/>
begin to do more.  If when he gets older you are not a team, it will  <br/>
be too late to get him that lollipop when he was seven.<br/>
<br/>
If you re-read the earlier posts in this topic, I think you will see  <br/>
those same things said in different ways by other people already.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are people on this list who never post here, but do post  <br/>
on another list or two, that they invite people over there when they  <br/>
are &quot;attacked&quot; here.  So if you consider this an attack on you,  <br/>
because people didn&#39;t sooth and &quot;support,&quot; I have no doubt you will  <br/>
get a side invitation to another list where they don&#39;t discuss  <br/>
unschooling so much as they badmouth other people.  I also know many  <br/>
people are shocked when they write to a group of women and those women  <br/>
don&#39;t commiserate and say &quot;It is SO HARD having kids, isn&#39;t it?  We&#39;re  <br/>
all doing the best we can.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have zero interest in investing my time and energy in that, past  <br/>
this collection where I put those statements when I find them:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/support">http://sandradodd.com/support</a><br/>
<br/>
This list exists to support the potential of your son being unschooled  <br/>
by a happy and confident mom.  We&#39;re on his side.<br/>

After I read my post, I could see that it was more about my response to his response than it was about the lollipop, and that the lollipop could have been a non-issue ....  but I still can&#39;t figure out how to get past that hurdle.<br/>
<br/>
My mom didn&#39;t ever deny me a lollipop, because I wouldn&#39;t have dared to ask for one.  I was downright beaten by mother and step-father until I was bigger than my mom and even after that I was still threatened with extreme physical harm by my step-father who was bigger than me.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t even begin to tell you the horror that was my childhood.  And I can be grateful for that because it led me to unschooling and to a good relationship with my son now, but I still can&#39;t get over that hurdle of the way people TREAT ME and the way people behave around me.<br/>
<br/>
I want to be happy and confident too.  And I&#39;m not sure how to get there from here.  I&#39;m a lot happier and a lot more confident than I used to be, but nowhere near what I want to be and I don&#39;t know where to go and what to do now.<br/>

<br/>
imagine for a moment what those nasty adults with a sense of entitlement likely experienced as children...just sit with it and imagine. is it easier for you to imagine that they had a bounty of their needs met, readily and lovingly, as children, or that they did not - and instead were deprived of even the right to FEEL desires without reprimand...for me it is abundantly obvious that it is the latter.<br/>

<br/>
Were they unschooled?<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot;<br/>
You can&#39;t get to it be writing, about it.  You need to get to it by  <br/>
making choices about interactions with your son.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t listened to this talk, it has good examples about  <br/>
choices.  It&#39;s at the bottom of this page:<br/>

<br/>
-=-You say examine old memories with adult awareness ... how? How do I  <br/>
do this? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Gradually.  When a memory comes, try not to go with the emotion of it,  <br/>
but with something that could have gone differently.  Just imagine a  <br/>
time when you were afraid to ask and think what it might have been  <br/>
like if your mom had been different and you had asked and she had said  <br/>
yes.  That would be enough for one &quot;session.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe think back to what you might know of your mother&#39;s childhood.   <br/>
What if that had been different?  Sometimes just let your mind go to  <br/>
that place, but don&#39;t try to stay there and make up a big story, just  <br/>
a little peek, with a &quot;what if&quot; thought.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I can&#39;t even begin to tell you the horror that was my childhood.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t.  And don&#39;t continue to review it in your mind.  It messed up  <br/>
your early life.  Do not allow it to mess up this year, or next year.   <br/>
DO NOT allowe it to mess up your son&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
-=- And I can be grateful for that because it led me to unschooling  <br/>
and to a good relationship with my son now, but I still can&#39;t get over  <br/>
that hurdle of the way people TREAT ME and the way people behave  <br/>
around me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Many children grow up limited and deprived and cannot WAIT for their  <br/>
promised &quot;turn,&quot; when they finally &quot;can do anything they want to,&quot; and  <br/>
like fraternity or military hazing, they turn on their children (or  <br/>
other people&#39;s children) and limit and deprive them, because it is  <br/>
their turn.  And they accepted the idea that children are and SHOULD  <br/>
BE powerless, that children are not important, adults are; that  <br/>
children&#39;s desires are not important, adults&#39; are.   And by doing  <br/>
that, the cycle is not broken.<br/>
<br/>
Someone has to decide to forego that turn to &quot;be big&quot; at the expense  <br/>
of younger human beings.    Someone has to NOT do to others as was  <br/>
done to her, or that family legacy will continue.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to be different, you can&#39;t keep being the same way.<br/>
<br/>
There are some wonderfully ambiguous lyrics in a song by Sister  <br/>
Hazel.  It was used as the closing song of a movie called Bedazzled,  <br/>
which comes across as a comedy but is one of those rare movies that&#39;s  <br/>
all about philosophy and spiritual issues.   The chorus is<br/>
<br/>
If you want to be somebody else<br/>
If you&#39;re tired of fighting battles with yourself<br/>
If you want to be somebody else<br/>
Change your mind.<br/>
<br/>
Either way you interpret the last line makes deep sense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012133235">Tonight I was at Publix for 2 items. My son who is 8 and doesn&#39;t let me go anywhere without him asked if the deli was still open. It was after 9 and at Kroger it would be closed. I said I&#39;m not sure but we&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
Well I got my items and went to the checkout and in the checkout he asked again because he wanted a cookie.<br/>
<br/>
I totally forgot just in those few minutes. I asked the clerk if it was open because he wants a cookie. They told me it was, so after I paid for the items we went to the bakery area. nobody was there, we waited a few minutes, then I went to the deli counter and asked them. They went and got the person at the bakery and gave my son a cookie.<br/>

It really was no big deal and only took a few minutes :)<br/>

&quot;Children do not need to be made to learn to be better, told what to do or shown how. If they are given access to enough of the world, they will see clearly enough what things are truly important to themselves and to others, and they will make for themselves a better path into that world then anyone else could make for them.&quot; <br/>

I deeply feel for your childhood. And always remember if you too feel deeply<br/>
for your &quot;inner child&quot;, that is &quot;you&quot; at whatever age you were traumatized,<br/>
then you will stop right now what you are doing with your son.<br/>
<br/>
The only way to heal the scars of your childhood is by being &quot;now&quot; exactly<br/>
the way you wish your childhood &quot;had been&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Every time &quot;your response&quot; is the same as that of &quot;your moms or stepdad&#39;s&quot;<br/>
you are only perpetuating the same pattern of anger and violence.<br/>
<br/>
Please be kind to your &quot;inner child&quot; love her, comfort her, praise her, hold<br/>
her. Indulge her the way you wished your mom and stepfather had, and see how<br/>
your response to your son changes miraculously.<br/>
<br/>
With every new response from you your confidence in yourself will grow by<br/>
leaps and bounds and your near and dear ones will also grow in love.<br/>
<br/>
Can you see a little &quot;now&quot; how it was never about your son. The root is<br/>
always the self and not the other.<br/>

<h4>Jennifer Schuelein</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-836255295">I have learned over time that when I go above and beyond for my son and his seemingly simple needs (we adults think of a lolly or a cookie as something to dismiss, sometimes), I am repaid in thankfulness and I also feel very good. Helping my son navigate the world makes me full...by making him full, I am full, you see. We need to keep our children full and not dismiss their needs and desires. You might try asking yourself if the thing he is asking will hurt him or anyone around. If not, then do it! Also, if something so simple can make a child very happy then well, it&#39;s always my attitude to make it happen. Don&#39;t take those little moments for granted. <br/>
<br/>
My mother was a single mom and left me alone a great deal. I had an ok childhood, but it wasn&#39;t anything near as wonderful as what I am giving my child. I strive to give him everything I lacked, to keep him full and happy. In the end, when he is older, I am confident he will be a loving, joyful, considerate, caring person that goes above and beyond for his loved ones. He, too, had the &quot;gimmies&quot; as I call them (where he whined and begged for things). He went through a demanding phase and a phase where he seemed spoiled. We rode the wave and focused on reminding him of more pleasant behaviors. Also, distraction is a great tool. If you have to disappoint, fill the void with something else, but make it equally as interesting (which can be a simple thing like looking at a dog across the street or counting how many people are wearing blue on the sidewalk - silly, fun things).<br/>
<br/>
The thing I like to always remind myself of is that growing up and learning about life is a journey and that I have a responsibility to my child, due to my choices of attachment parenting and radical unschooling, to make life interesting and to pay attention to my sons needs all the time. Let your journey be a happy one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354461346"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&quot;I am not stomping my feet.  I am trying to understand.  How can a child who <br/>
&gt;&gt;gets every wish fulfilled if possible, whose parents bend over backwards to try <br/>
&gt;&gt;to help them and give them everything they want - how can that child not grow up <br/>
&gt;&gt;thinking they are entitled to everything they want, and entitled to have other <br/>
&gt;&gt;people get it for them?&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because what the child is seeing and experiencing is generosity and love and <br/>
kindness. The more you are kind to your child the more they will know kindness. <br/>
The more you are generous with him the more generous he will know how to be. It <br/>
isn&#39;t entitlement that they grow up knowing, it is kindness and care and love. <br/>
<br/>
When Linnaea was little, and Simon was like this a bit, it felt like she wanted <br/>
everything. But she didn&#39;t. She wanted some things. Learning to come up with <br/>
ways to get her those things, bouncy balls from a vending machine every time we <br/>
went swimming, stuffed animals from the zoo every time we went to the zoo, dolls <br/>
every time we went to the toy store, and so on, has helped her to grow into a <br/>
child who is fairly discerning in what she gets. I wouldn&#39;t have predicted that <br/>
when I was trying to fight my tendency to say no. In full justification of the <br/>
nos I might have said I could have talked about entitlement and about how these <br/>
aren&#39;t things she needs and how she wouldn&#39;t play with them for long and on and <br/>
on. But what the yesses gave her was a sense of being valued, of being listened <br/>
to, of having her choices and desires supported. She knows that David and I are <br/>
willing to work to meet her needs and aren&#39;t going to sit in judgement on which <br/>
of her needs is the one we&#39;ll choose to support. <br/>
<br/>
It was hard to say yes in the beginning and so I gave both she and Simon an <br/>
allowance so that they could use their money when I was too whatever to use my <br/>
own. Too grouchy, too hungry, too worried about money, too whatever. It also <br/>
gave them the power to save for something. And they do. We went to Hamley&#39;s in <br/>
London on Tuesday and they bought Yugioh cards. I was happy to buy them for <br/>
them, but they both wanted to pay for them, and they used their saved allowances <br/>
to do so. They are not particularly frivolous, but they are generous. They are <br/>
rarely broke. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&quot;You say examine old memories with adult awareness ... how?  How do I do <br/>
&gt;&gt;this?&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can remember getting things I didn&#39;t necessarily want simply because my <br/>
parents offered to buy them. There was a broom from Pioneer Village in Minden, <br/>
Nebraska. It was a small broom, and it was made there, and I wanted it because I <br/>
could have it. There were the acid washed papers of the Gettysburg Address from <br/>
a trip to Gettysburg and the Constitution in similarly prematurely aged form, I <br/>
didn&#39;t really want them, but they were within the things my parents would get <br/>
me, so I was excited to get them. I got a bunch of books on marine biology <br/>
because my mom thought that was an okay interest to support, but I really wanted <br/>
books on Alastair Crowley, which she didn&#39;t think were things I should be <br/>
reading. I bought a cardigan once that I still have, it&#39;s my cautionary <br/>
cardigan, because David told me I could have it. I don&#39;t particularly like it, <br/>
but I was allowed to have it, so I wanted it. I&#39;ve had both Simon and Linnaea <br/>
regularly turn things down that I&#39;ve offered to buy them. It amazes me every <br/>
time. I&#39;m fully willing to buy them something and they turn it down because it <br/>
isn&#39;t something that they want. <br/>
<br/>
Being able to see that the reason they can turn things down is because they have <br/>
been given the things they want is a big way of examining my own relationship <br/>
with buying and needing things. Seeing how supporting them and what they are <br/>
interested in has helped them to feel fuller and bigger and more sated and less <br/>
needy and small and unheard has been a powerful instrument in looking at my own <br/>
need for reassurance and permission to buy something. <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t entitlement that comes from being loving and kind, it is an overflowing <br/>
cup of love and kindness. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-872399385">&lt;&lt;I&#39;ll be honest with you.<br/>
I did not WANT to go in the bank though. I wanted to use the ATM and get him<br/>
a lolliop somewhere else.&gt;&gt;<br/>
and<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t like the whining&gt;&gt; wrote Lisa, yet, the whole tone of your email<br/>
is *whine*.   I am sorry to break it to you but the way you describe your<br/>
son in demeaning terms, when he is expressing distress is a sign you need to<br/>
re-think your relationship.<br/>
<br/>
 Most of the &quot;whiney adults&quot; I know cannot stand it in others especially<br/>
children.  They use their adult power to judge and to shut down disempowered<br/>
children, rather than empathize with them.<br/>
<br/>
  Here&#39;s how is sounded from your child&#39;s perspective:<br/>
I wanted a lollipop.  My mother offered me a different lollipop. She then<br/>
became more irrational about how to get me a lollipop and  her banking needs<br/>
somehow cancelled my lollipop needs, just because she didn&#39;t want to go in a<br/>
bank.  She was completely distracted by her own &quot;playing&quot; to deal with my<br/>
serious request for a lollipop.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you guys always do exactly what your children want when they want it?<br/>
Is every request to be fulfilled? Is there never a time when you say &quot;It<br/>
would be easier for me to do it this way and that&#39;s how I am going to do it&quot;<br/>
.. ?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think that whining and crying everytime you don&#39;t get your way and<br/>
don&#39;t get what you want is behavior that should be discouraged. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a fourteen, seven, and ten year old and they don&#39;t always get what<br/>
they want.  Some time they have conflicting needs/desires/ideas.  We do a<br/>
lot of talking, discussing and arguing.  As the parent you hold yourself to<br/>
higher standards of patience because you have more resources or at least<br/>
*most* parents  on this list do this and that allows them to embrace<br/>
children who are upset, rather than rant, rave and have an email *meltdown*,<br/>
where they present themselves as injured by a child&#39;s request and subsequent<br/>
disappointment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-138177279">&lt;Being able to see that the reason they can turn things down is because they<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading about unschooling and putting it into practice since my<br/>
oldest was 5.  She&#39;s 15 now.  They know that we will always do our best to<br/>
get them what they want.  They are and never have been those bratty kind of<br/>
kids who want EVERYTHING.  Those are the kids who don&#39;t feel loved and are<br/>
trying to fill the void with stuff.  It will never be enough because what<br/>
they want is love an acceptance and what they are getting is stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Money is tight for us this year. Between medical bills and less overtime we<br/>
are going to have to tighten our belts for a while.  We&#39;ve talked about it<br/>
with the girls.  My oldest offered to pay for all her riding lessons because<br/>
she can work them off at the barn.<br/>
<br/>
 I asked my youngest the other day what she would like for Christmas so I<br/>
can start shopping now and pick up things when I find sales.  She told me<br/>
she&#39;d really like a pair of shipping boots (for her horse and they are about<br/>
$60) but that she couldn&#39;t really think of anything else she &quot;needed.&quot;  She<br/>
said she&#39;d think about it.  Despite her very difficult year (and that&#39;s the<br/>
understatement of the year), her cup is pretty full and she doesn&#39;t feel<br/>
like she &quot;needs&quot; anything for Christmas.  It&#39;s because she feels LOVED!<br/>

<br/>
This is really important. Go get a cup of tea or something and take some<br/>
time to really sit with this. Because this right here is where you need to<br/>
unkink your think, and depart from our culture.<br/>
<br/>
Our culture leads you to believe that at base children are bad and require<br/>
correction. The moment you realize, deep in your gut, that at base, they&#39;re<br/>
awesome and require love, the whole thing just shifts over.<br/>
<br/>
I found that reading Polly Berends really helped. I also found Continuum<br/>
Concept to be useful. But honestly? Just thinking about it, and watching my<br/>
own kids, was what really turned the corner for me. You don&#39;t have to stop<br/>
them from being evil and entitled. You have to recognize that they&#39;re<br/>
inherently spectacular, and all you have to do is love and support and<br/>
encourage them, and they blossom. And in the act of learning how to do that,<br/>
you&#39;ll discover along the way that you blossom too.<br/>
<br/>
I too had bits of my childhood that were pretty horrific. For me, taking<br/>
each bit out and examining it was way way way too much for me to deal with.<br/>
So I locked most of that junk up in a pretty box labeled &quot;unfortunate<br/>
circumstance&quot; and put it on a shelf. It neither defines me, nor informs my<br/>
current actions.<br/>
<br/>
Say yes. Choose love. Get on with making your corner of the world as<br/>
wonderful as possible. Let the rest sort itself out.<br/>

<br/>
Were they lavished with love and care and &quot;let me help you&quot; as children? Every adult I know who is demanding in that way heard a whole lot of &quot;no&quot; as a child, or was given things in place of affection. The adults I know who have been in prison did not come from homes where care was lavished on them. They did come from homes where they heard a lot of &quot;you can&#39;t always get what you want&quot;.  <br/>

And so its natural for you to want &quot;your turn&quot; at being the one to say no - its wonderful that you&#39;re trying to do it more kindly! But you can go beyond that. Be the kindness and compassion you would have wanted from your own parents. Not only will your child benefit, you will too! Give Yourself the gift of being the kind, gentle compassionate mother you wanted and re-parent yourself. That&#39;s one of the wonderful parts of unschooling, it lets you heal your own hurts in addition to keeping you from passing them on to your kids. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a sort of strange fallacy to think that it&#39;s somehow possible to Always get what one wants!<br/>
<br/>
About three weeks ago I got some kites - they were on clearance and I figured I&#39;d stock up - and ever since Mo has wanted to fly a kite. Well, the wind has not cooperated! It has been light and erratic and not very good for kite flying. We&#39;ve tried a few different places: the neighbors mown hillside, a local park that&#39;s often a perfect spot for kites, a field outside my workplace. Not much luck, alas. The One thing my 9yo would dearly love right now, and she can&#39;t have it. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s used to the idea that she *can&#39;t* always get what she wants, but also to the idea that I and her dad will try to help her get what she wants when we can. She&#39;s made do by racing up and down the driveway with the kite on a short string so the speed of the run will create enough lift to keep the kite afloat. Its pretty adorable. <br/>
<br/>
In conventional parenting &quot;you can&#39;t always get what you want&quot; is an end game. In unschooling its just another challenge to problem solve around. But it Gets to be &quot;just another challenge&quot; because of parents&#39; willingness to try do whatever they can. Grab every easy Yes you can and be glad its an easy one! Life will throw enough challenges in your path that you don&#39;t ever have to add a single one. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868680328">-=-I was happy to buy them for<br/>
them, but they both wanted to pay for them, and they used their saved  <br/>
allowances<br/>
to do so. They are not particularly frivolous, but they are generous.  <br/>
They are<br/>
rarely broke. -=-<br/>
<br/>
My kids were that way with allowances too.  Sometimes they would buy  <br/>
something that I would rather have bought for them so they could save  <br/>
their allowance.  I hadn&#39;t foreseen that they were learning about  <br/>
money in ways I had never predicted. I would *never* have spent my  <br/>
meagre allowance on practicalities.  My mother showed me selfishness  <br/>
and limits, and she was NOT getting any of my money.<br/>
<br/>
When I was little and had received money gifts when I was too young to  <br/>
spend them, my mom didn&#39;t save them for me; she spent them.  When my  <br/>
kids were too little and would get a card from the other grandparents  <br/>
with money in it ($2 for a two year old, $3 for a three year old...),  <br/>
I would leave the money in the card sometimes, and leave it in a  <br/>
folder of things for that child.  When they were older, on some slack  <br/>
day with not much to do, or if they asked about handwriting or grandma  <br/>
and grandpa, or whatever it was, I would get that folder (different  <br/>
for each child, different times, casual) and look through things and  <br/>
they would discover excitedly that they had money they hadn&#39;t known  <br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
I did that to honor the little girl I had been whose &quot;property&quot; and  <br/>
gifts were not respected or maintained, but were coveted and resented  <br/>
by my mother.  (My dad was a sweet man who didn&#39;t cross my mother much  <br/>
about the children.)  But in doing what I thought was right and good,  <br/>
I became a person who was conscious of making decisions in my child&#39;s  <br/>
favor.  Once I BECAME that person, I wasn&#39;t having to think very hard  <br/>
to make those decisions.  It&#39;s harder at first, when other people&#39;s  <br/>
voices are in your head saying &quot;You fed him and bought him clothes;  <br/>
keep that money,&quot; or &quot;He&#39;s just a child; he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s  <br/>
talking about,&quot; or &quot;He might *want* that but he doesn&#39;t *NEED* it.&quot;   <br/>
When you try to hear those voices and identify which parent,  <br/>
grandparent, aunt, neighbor, friend it is, you can say to that  <br/>
recording in your head &quot;Enough; no more.&quot;  And the next time you start  <br/>
to hear it, realize that is not your thoughts, that&#39;s a tape of  <br/>
something that was said that made you feel embarrassment or shame or  <br/>
to think you were wrong or small.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone has those message in them, I think.  And probably some nice,  <br/>
positive ones, too.  In Freudian terms, that&#39;s the superego, where  <br/>
rules are, where &quot;should&quot; lives.  Don&#39;t try to get rid of it, just be  <br/>
aware that it collects odd things and doesn&#39;t identify the quotes when  <br/>
they come pouring out.  Just clean the superego closet when you find  <br/>
something that&#39;s harmful to you or your child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093595928">-=- I&#39;ve had both Simon and Linnaea<br/>
regularly turn things down that I&#39;ve offered to buy them. It amazes me  <br/>
every<br/>
time. I&#39;m fully willing to buy them something and they turn it down  <br/>
because it<br/>
isn&#39;t something that they want. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The thing that struck me most about what my kids would turn down was  <br/>
eating out.  If we were on errands, I would (still do, and still get  <br/>
turned down half the time or more) say &quot;Do you want to eat  <br/>
[wherever]?&quot;  Or &quot;Do you want me to drive through somewhere?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When they were little and they wanted the toy, they would want fast  <br/>
food kid meals.  If they didn&#39;t want the toy, they didn&#39;t want the meal.<br/>
<br/>
When they got older, they were often happier to come home and eat  <br/>
something I made than to eat something out.  Sometimes they said it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t worth the money, and sometimes they said they just liked my  <br/>
food better.<br/>
<br/>
I never liked my mom&#39;s food better.  It was all tainted with years of  <br/>
meanness, and I knew she slammed around resentfully when she cooked,  <br/>
which soured the whole thing, too.  It wasn&#39;t a gift, it was &quot;here&#39;s  <br/>
your damned food&quot; with a lingering tone of &quot;and I hope you choke on  <br/>
it.&quot;  Though if I had choked on it, she would have yelled at me for  <br/>
not chewing right, for not swallowing right.<br/>
<br/>
The opposite of that is making food for a child and learning not to be  <br/>
whiney or petulant if the child doesn&#39;t want that thing, or isn&#39;t  <br/>
hungry.  My children don&#39;t eat what they don&#39;t want.  How healthy is  <br/>
that!?  I would eat just to eat, because food outside my house had a  <br/>
joy and niceness that I needed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-336259334">---------It&#39;s a sort of strange fallacy to think that it&#39;s somehow possible to Always get what one wants!--------------<br/>
<br/>
It is also interesting to note when adults, in the guise of teaching their children that they can&#39;t always have what they want, are actually trying to get exactly what it is s/he (the adult) wants, be it spending less money, avoiding &quot;wasting&quot; time.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-733880601">This is beautiful:<br/>
<br/>
-=-The thing I like to always remind myself of is that growing up and  <br/>
learning about life is a journey and that I have a responsibility to  <br/>
my child, due to my choices of attachment parenting and radical  <br/>
unschooling, to make life interesting and to pay attention to my sons  <br/>
needs all the time. Let your journey be a happy one.-=-<br/>
<br/>
No one has ever been court ordered to unschool.  It&#39;s a choice every  <br/>
single time.  Jennifer has described wonderfully what it means in  <br/>
terms of choices after the unschooling decision is made.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling badly isn&#39;t a good option for anyone.  That can lead to  <br/>
court orders to put kids in school.   So if people are going to do it,  <br/>
they should really do it.<br/>

<br/>
-=-I have learned over time that when I go above and beyond for my son  <br/>
and his seemingly simple needs (we adults think of a lolly or a cookie  <br/>
as something to dismiss, sometimes), I am repaid in thankfulness and I  <br/>
also feel very good. Helping my son navigate the world makes me  <br/>
full...by making him full, I am full, you see. We need to keep our  <br/>
children full and not dismiss their needs and desires. -=-<br/>
<br/>
My middle child, Marty, has a girlfriend.  He&#39;s 21.  She&#39;s 24.  She  <br/>
was at the Santa Fe unschooling symposium I sponsored last January.  I  <br/>
passed by as she was talking to one of the unschooling moms and heard  <br/>
her say &quot;He treats me like a princess.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wrote this last week, and what Jennifer wrote about being full  <br/>
reminded me of it:<br/>
