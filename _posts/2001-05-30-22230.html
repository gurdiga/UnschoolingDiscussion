 </span></blockquote>Hi Cindy, the weather in Eugene in June is usually beautiful and <br/>
about 80 degrees but sometimes we do still get some rain in June, so <br/>
you never know. July is usually high-80&#39;s and sunny (though last year <br/>
we did have a couple of cooler rainy days in the first week of July). <br/>
May I ask what event you&#39;re coming here for? We&#39;ve never gone to an <br/>
SCA event, but I think my son would really like it so I&#39;d be <br/>
interested in finding out more.  You can email me at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:robinc@...">robinc@...</a> if you want to discuss it off-list.<br/>
