<div id="ygrps-yiv-982723063">Hello!!  All of this talk about 4 and 5 yo kids reading and such is<br/>
making me wonder...  my oldest is a 5yo ds and has little interest in<br/>
writing.  He will on occasion but is more interested in building and<br/>
sort of inventing.  He also does not read on his own yet.  Even as a<br/>
toddler  never liked the typical memorizing of the alphabet, etc -- just<br/>
seemed too busy for it.  He likes being read to and has some favorite<br/>
books just about memorized but I am curious if anyone else has had<br/>
experiences similar-- especially if your kids are older now??  This is<br/>
actually part of the reason we are homeschooling--we did not want to<br/>

If you hang around long enough you&#39;ll hear the opposite end of the spectrum<br/>
of kids not reading until they&#39;re nearly teens. They learn in ways that are<br/>
more meaningful to them. The range of learning to read is much broader than<br/>
schools lead us to believe. And when there is no stigma for not being able<br/>
to read, kids will learn it when *they&#39;re* ready.<br/>
<br/>
Very few kids are reading at 5. In school they might be recognizing words or<br/>
the alphabet, but that&#39;s not reading. It isn&#39;t even really a stepping stone<br/>
to reading if it&#39;s forced on them. It&#39;s just a way for schools to be able to<br/>
check off that they were taught certain skills, whether those skills are<br/>
meaningful to them or not.<br/>

I have a daughter who just decided reading was a good thing this year, she is 10. It&#39;s ok for your ds to wait. Let him explore his interests at his own pace. Reading will come when he needs it.<br/>

My kids learned to recognize letter because of Sesame Street and us just <br/>
playing around with letters on cardboard boxes or signs or menus.   They <br/>
learned them in order because there&#39;s a song (and additional tunes and <br/>
cartoons on Sesame Street).  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby could name letters before he could tell how old he was, because I <br/>
remember one time he was naming refrigerator magnets at our La Leche League <br/>
Leader&#39;s house, and she squatted down and asked him how old he was.  He had <br/>
no idea what she was talking about, so he looked at her a couple of seconds <br/>
and then turned to the refrigerator and started naming letters again.  He was <br/>
a year and a half old.  <br/>
<br/>
That same boy didn&#39;t read until he was nearly nine.<br/>
His brother, at nine.<br/>
His sister, at ten, is still not fluent (but she&#39;s getting there).<br/>
<br/>
None of them waited to learn, though, and</div>

dense text -- which is anything denser than a comic strip -- is still not<br/>
easy for her. She will read gaming guides and magazines because what she<br/>
gets out of them is worth the effort but still prefers to be read to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-331116460">Thanks everyone for your responses.  I am very green about all of this<br/>
and although I know in my heart unschooling is the way for me and my<br/>
family I do at times need encouragement and to keep hearing that it will<br/>
happen when it&#39;s time.  <br/>
<br/>
My ds that I am referring to has little interest in writing as I said<br/>
and at times does ask for help to write his name so that&#39;s when we &quot; do<br/>
&quot; writing.  He tends to get frustrated at times if it doesn&#39;t come out<br/>
how he intended so I am not pushing this as I want him to enjoy himself<br/>
while writing,  etc.  But it is helpful for me to be able to come here<br/>
and talk about this and hear others say it&#39;s ok to let them take their<br/>
time...that it worked for your family,too.. instead of hearing that he<br/>
better get going!!  Thanks again for all of your stories and input.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-330900797">hello my boy did not like to write at all when he was<br/>
5,6 and he just turn seven this past month.  He is<br/>
just starting to pick the pencil up to do inventive<br/>
spelling on his secrets formulas LOL.  He write<br/>
numbers down here and there.  Mostly when I get a bill<br/>
for his serivces lol.  He is trying to save money for<br/>
a video game.  I did buy this book called family<br/>
writing.  I bought the old edition at half.com.  It<br/>
had some interesting thoughts on journaling if your<br/>
into that. It suggested that you let your child draw a<br/>
picture and have a written conversation on a piece of<br/>
paper about the picture.  He wrote different symbols<br/>
for what words meant(he had to translate), but he was<br/>
writing.  My son really enjoyed it.  Like I said he<br/>
does not write very often , but this was fun.  <br/>
<br/>
I think writing can be stressful.  To stand there and<br/>
look at all these symbols and then have to figure out<br/>
what order they go in can be something he is just not<br/>
ready for.  I would not focus on it at all, his time<br/>
will come.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Probably lots of us.  I think there are probably just as many kids who read <br/>
&quot;late&quot; as read &quot;early&quot;.  My son was not really reading at all at age 12.  I <br/>
pushed him into doing phonics with me at that time (something I thoroughly <br/>
regret).  He still doesn&#39;t read well at age 14, though he&#39;s getting better <br/>
at it.  I&#39;m not concerned about it now (in large part thanks to this group) <br/>
because I suspect he&#39;s never going to learn things by reading as his <br/>
preferred method.  He&#39;s a doer who learns mostly by doing and sometimes by <br/>
watching.  Listening is next on the list, and reading is last.  So now I <br/>
look for ways to support his learning style rather than mine.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

matter what the schools would like us to believe. For some kids, especially <br/>
boys it seems, it&#39;s too young to even want to give it thought. Your son will <br/>
start writing when he has a need to communicate something in that form. In <br/>
the meantime, you can support him by reading to him, playing with him, <br/>
providing materials for drawing and writing, and letting him be exactly <br/>
where he is right now. It&#39;s the perfect place for him.<br/>

<br/>
My son didn&#39;t read until he was 10.  My girls were both reading (or <br/>
starting to) at 5.  I think that it takes a lot of (but not all) boys <br/>
longer.  If your son is just five, I&#39;d let it go for many years yet <br/>
unless he expressed an interest or frustration.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629431022">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My 8 yo dd was worried because she isn&#39;t reading as well as her sister <br/>
(now 12) was at age 8. At the end of 2nd grade, the older sis was <br/>
reading at a sixth grade level. I explained to dd#2 that her sister was <br/>
bored to tears in school, and they wouldn&#39;t let her do anything else <br/>
(this was essentially why we started homeschooling). You, on the other <br/>
hand, I told her, are homeschooling and are free to explore what you <br/>
want, and you read fine. Since your current interests seem to be more <br/>
math oriented -- she loves anything with numbers, and is learning <br/>
various math concepts with a great deal of enthusiasm, -- there&#39;s no <br/>
need to worry about your reading.  Just read what you like and it will <br/>
come. She&#39;s also teaching herself to  play the flute. She&#39;s busy, she&#39;s <br/>
learning, she&#39;s having fun, and she&#39;s doing it on her terms.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s building and inventing -- well, that&#39;s so cool. Let him. Strew a <br/>
few books on builders and inventors and interesting inventions around <br/>
the house. He&#39;ll read when he&#39;s interested and ready.<br/>
<br/>
