<div id="ygrps-yiv-92128924">First of all let me send my sympathy and also prayers to those who need them <br/>
now from losing someone so dear.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t intend on responding to this but my dads birthday is in 2 weeks and <br/>
missing him just as much now as I did when he passed 18 years ago made me <br/>
want to put it in writing.<br/>
<br/>
My dad was the most incredible man I have ever known. Anyone who knew him <br/>
thought the same. He was the best as a father. Never a harsh word to me of <br/>
any kind. Very giving and kind. Honest, hard working and loved by literally <br/>
everyone who knew him. My friends adored my dad. Our whole town did. When he <br/>
passed, there was a line around the block of people who came to pay their <br/>
respects. It was quite a show of how much he meant to so many. Now that I <br/>
look at this, these words just don&#39;t do enough. His passing has changed my <br/>
life. I&#39;ve lost many close friends and relatives since his passing and none <br/>
really seem to have any impact on me.<br/>
<br/>
The saddest thing is that my father never got to know my husband and even <br/>
worse, see any of this grandchildren. He would have loved grandkids and <br/>
well, I was his only hope for that. My kids have missed out on a great guy. <br/>
My husbands father passed before any of our children were born also. Three <br/>
of my 4 children have never known a grandpa.<br/>
<br/>
Celebrate your dads. No matter how hard the times, celebrate them.<br/>
<br/>

Boy my husband sure does! Sometimes even more so than I am; on some<br/>
particular issues, such as what could broadly be called &quot;Jayn&#39;s health&quot; he<br/>
wants to be a bit more controlling and coercive (nb health issues in this<br/>
case does NOT include food which he is completely free about). However, it<br/>
actually took the last conference for me to really understand and believe<br/>
that my darling sweetheart really does get it, and believe in unschooling<br/>
and freedom with his whole soul. He is much better than me at dealing with<br/>
other people who don&#39;t understand how we are living. Last summer Jayn had<br/>
been doing a lot of screaming, which bugged our neighbor. Having her telling<br/>
Jayn not to scream, while playing, only made Jayn laugh and scream louder.<br/>
She later complained that Jayn shouldn&#39;t be allowed to scream ever, and<br/>
James just calmly told her that &quot;this is where she is right now&quot;. (I should<br/>
add that we discourage it when Jayn is outside since it does echo around the<br/>
building. The apartments are soundproofed so inside it doesn&#39;t carry from<br/>
inside our place - plus she seems to have outgrown the need.) It&#39;s the old<br/>
pot calling the kettle black btw - you should hear her screaming for her<br/>
dogs to come in! Doesn&#39;t bother me, except in the raised eyebrow of irony<br/>
that she complains about other people&#39;s noises.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  How about you&#39;ve been HSing so long you&#39;d like some new ideas in case you&#39;re getting stale? Conferences are rarely for people new to things though they can be a great intro. Conferences and conventions seem to me to be mostly places where people who&#39;ve been involved in a certain thing for years go to get inspired and trade knowledge. If I was a brain surgeon I certainly wouldn&#39;t be staying home from brain surgery conferences. I&#39;d go to keep informed and in the loop. It&#39;s also a chance to socialize and party with a bunch of people who share a particular interest, just plain fun. <br/>

and unschooling. I feel very fortunate.  Tell your husband that the unschooling <br/>
conference is not about homeschooling and is so different from homeschooling <br/>
conferences.  Jackson is coming to the conference again this year.  We all <br/>
enjoy it.<br/>

the kids are saying what is going on with them and saying no when <br/>
they need too. He does not understand and yesterday just about broke <br/>
my nine year olds heart by yelling at him. <br/>
How do we live with two sets of principles..I am unsure how to put <br/>
it all together. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108415541">We are dealing with this sort of thing too.  Dh is just not getting it.  Sometimes it seems like he understands it, but now he wants the kids to just sit down and &quot;do&quot; some school. And he aggravated ds 9 last night by making him ask for something over and over because he didn&#39;t like his &quot;tone&quot;.  Ds just ended up walking away and was very frustrated and I was frustrated too.  Doesn&#39;t he see that he is pushing them away by doing this?  I ordered some dumb books from half.com. Comprehensive curr. so we can just hurry up and fill them in to satisfy his &quot;do&quot;.  It won&#39;t last long but it sucks.  I wish he had the time to make them sit and &quot;do&quot; school.  One thing it has shown me is the advances they have made in their reading and other stuff all on thier own with no one forcing them to do it.  I am pointing it out to them the sucess they have made on their own.  Other than that it is just drudgery. I find that I resent having to do it as much as they do.  I&#39;m trying not to show it.  Dh is usually so good interacting with them in his own way, I just don&#39;t understand what has crawled up his *** lately.Some of it I think is he thinks we are just having fun and he has to work, although I have offered several times to go to work to help him.  And he turns down the offer everytime.  (better stop asking him LOL)...  Stepheny<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Dh is just not getting it.  Sometimes it seems like he understands it, <br/>
but now he wants the kids to just sit down and &quot;do&quot; some school. And he <br/>
aggravated ds 9 last night by making him ask for something over and over because he <br/>
didn&#39;t like his &quot;tone&quot;.  Ds just ended up walking away and was very frustrated <br/>
and I was frustrated too.  Doesn&#39;t he see that he is pushing them away by doing <br/>
this?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can you try to tell your husband that if he treats them like he treats people <br/>
he likes, they will more quickly BECOME people he likes?   And if he treats <br/>
them like stupid kids, does that mean he believes they are stupid kids?   Put <br/>
the pressure on him to consider what he&#39;s doing and to THINK about what he does.<br/>
<br/>
Ask him, maybe, how many different responses he considers before he speaks to <br/>
them.  He might realize he considers none at all.   If he can try to consider <br/>
two and then choose the better one, he can come incrementally closer to <br/>
choosing from three, and never having those rejected-worse choices in his &quot;menu&quot; <br/>
again.<br/>

I&#39;m wondering if maybe he does get it but is just falling back on old habits. <br/>
 I find myself doing that but less and less frequently as time goes on.  Once <br/>
I really realized and saw in my own life how disrespectful I was being to my <br/>
children, I had to change.  My advice would be to keep talking about what you <br/>
feel and what you see, and keep modelling respectful parenting.  <br/>

I wonder if in his mind he&#39;s still separating their learning from their living.  He might understand when you tell them what they&#39;re learning, but still can&#39;t understand that it&#39;s all part of a much bigger picture than simply &quot;education&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Ask him to treat the children the same way he treats you, or his parents, or whoever he respects and trusts.  If he wouldn&#39;t say &quot;it&quot; to you, then don&#39;t say it to them.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for some people to give up control.  It takes a lot of conscious effort, and a constant self-policing of their thoughts and actions for a while.  It can be tough.  <br/>
<br/>
(I haven&#39;t had time to read any of the other responses, so if I&#39;m repeating....sorry.)<br/>

David knew what he wanted for Dylan before Dylan was even born.  He knew,<br/>
but when he&#39;s living in each moment sometimes the only things in the<br/>
parenting center of his brain are the various prerecorded obnoxious<br/>
messages in his father&#39;s loud voice.<br/>
<br/>
I think the parent who gets the most time with a kid also gets a lot of<br/>
time to reflect on the relationship and what might make it better.  I<br/>
think the parent who has only a little time at home with the kids only<br/>
takes time to react.  <br/>
<br/>
Sandra suggested you ask him if he thought of different responses before<br/>
he spoke.  This really helps my husband.  He has that ever present voice<br/>
of his dad banging around in his head.  But he&#39;s found he doesn&#39;t have to<br/>
let it out and he can choose to be David Lewis instead of Ron Lewis. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many partners get left in the dust of the parent zooming<br/>
toward unschooling?  Or toward respectful parenting?   We have to share<br/>
the ground we&#39;re gaining if we want them standing beside us when we look<br/>
up.&lt;g&gt;  When you find posts you think would speak to the concerns of your<br/>
family see if he&#39;ll read them too.  <br/>
<br/>
Is he easy to talk to?  Can you just say you want to be nicer to the kids<br/>
because it&#39;ll mean they&#39;ll be nicer people and nicer to their own kids?  <br/>
If he doesn&#39;t want to talk much about the whole philosophy can you just<br/>
slide that little bit in?  <br/>

  ***************************************<br/>
<br/>
  Yes!  I printed those posts out for my dh.  Any that really spoke truths to me,  I would hit *print*. He could then read little bursts of info.   We had Joyce&#39;s posts in the bif, Sandra&#39;s posts in the car, Mary G.&#39;s posts in another room.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  It is hard for the spouse that isn&#39;t at home and isn&#39;t doing the researching.  They aren&#39;t living it, they aren&#39;t seeing it at work, like us. <br/>
<br/>
  Also it was nice that these words were coming from other people&#39;s mouths.  Not mine.  So that he wouldn&#39;t take it personal or I wouldn&#39;t get emotional or something like that.   One big point that really struck home with my hubby was, &quot;would you speak that way to a friend of yours?&quot;  The whole respect thing was something that he never considered, yet it really made so much sense when I pointed it out.  (I think it was one of Joyce&#39;s posts that really hit home for him.  Thanks, Joyce!) <br/>
<br/>
  He read about not requiring chores, dealing with others questions, how great these unschooled kids were turning out,  all sorts of stories.<br/>
<br/>
  He is now a wonderful unschooling advocate!  But it did take some time and effort on both of our parts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  For those of you whose spouses are having a hard time with understanding it all,  the conference would be an awesome way to get to that advocacy level. &lt;g&gt; Really.  If you can get to the Live and Learn Conference, do it!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve written before about the profound effect the conference had on our lives <br/>
last year.  My husband (who is step-dad to my kids) has been supportive of <br/>
our homeschooling lifestyle since we met 7 years ago and the children were 3 and <br/>
7.  He happily went to the conference with us last year and although I had <br/>
talked about unschooling some I think he still expected a &quot;homeschool <br/>
conference&quot;  where I have actually sprinted out of speeches where someone was talking <br/>
about how to train up their children.  It was the beginning of our unschooling <br/>
journey and he came away from the conference as the children and I did.<br/>
We felt like we had found a home.....a place where we belonged.  <br/>
<br/>
These past few months have been so exciting and freeing for all of us.  I <br/>
could never have explained it all to him if he had not been there.  It wasn&#39;t so <br/>
much the speakers (although they were superb) but the little moments on the <br/>
elevators with wide-eyed giggling children, teenagers with their skateboards who <br/>
took the time to talk to us and the acceptance that I felt in every <br/>
conversation I had with total strangers who by the end of the weekend felt like <br/>
friends.  I know my husband is glad he went and we&#39;ll all be there again this year.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Model it for  him.  That&#39;s what worked for us.  Sometimes Mark still falls <br/>
back on old behavior, I just heard him raise his voice with the kids downstairs. <br/>
 But I told him that my only resolution this year was to raise my voice and <br/>
yell less.  And he agreed that was a great one.  Better than all those lose <br/>
weight, exercise things we always talk about.  I have every confidence we will <br/>
get there together.  <br/>
<br/>
I have found that he really can&#39;t be told what I object to in terms of how he <br/>
interacts with the kids.  Some Dads might welcome hints now and then, mine <br/>
doesn&#39;t.  But he will watch and repeat my behavior at a later date.  He rarely <br/>
uses the sing-songy voice with the kids anymore, for example.  And he tries to <br/>
get their sides of the story and work through disagreements.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not easy, but remember that he&#39;s not as focused as you on this path, so <br/>
he&#39;ll hit more bumpy spots.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428311296">Ok alot of thinking about this.  He is not as willing to listen to me make so many suggestions at once, so I have to go slow.  A little bit at a time.  He swallows it easier. <br/>
<br/>
However I just talked to the kids, Alyssa esp., it is bothering her the most.  I told her I let the list know what was being required of us, and also the things you suggested about doing while we did the worksheets, sit back and relax, that we are still unschoolers.  She thought we wouldn&#39;t be unschoolers anymore, and would not be allowed to any more conferences LOL.  Well I have a better perspective about it, and it seems he is happy if we only sit and do it once or twice a week.  Great suggestions.  I was just thinking drudgery drudgery just when I was starting to feel so free.  Stepheny<br/>
