<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753611937">I need some input about spelling.  After a huge failure of trying to <br/>
teach and instruct studies we came back to un schooling  and things <br/>
are going great, better then great.  It took a while to decompress <br/>
and I had some major unschooling to do my self. <br/>
<br/>
Now my son almost 9 who was totally refusing to read the simplest of <br/>
stores readers 1,2,3, over the years has jumped to adult reading <br/>
material. Marvel and Star Wars We have all these book about every <br/>
last detail of Spiderman and Star Wars. My son now is drawing ! Oh <br/>
yea that another cool thing, him putting a pencil in his hand. :) <br/>
<br/>
He wants to write a story. He want me or his dad to write the story <br/>
while he tells it to us. Of course the schoolish thinking is creeping <br/>
back. I want him to use this opportunity to learn how to do it for <br/>
him self.   If he was writing a Cat and Hat book there would be no <br/>
problem. I got him a really nice kids dictionary and showed him a bit <br/>
how to use it not wanting to overwhelm him. But as I suspected any <br/>
word he wants to spell won&#39;t be in that dictionary. First thing this <br/>
morning he wanted to know how to spell unlimited.  His use of words <br/>
and vocabulary are so much higher then is ability or even the kids <br/>
dictionary. I&#39;ve told him he can use his other books to spell the <br/>
words ne needs.<br/>
<br/>
Were at a good place of learning together and mending our <br/>
relationship how do I help him with spelling and writing with out <br/>
going to the traditional stand by method of learning this. Doing it <br/>
that was was turn off the first time I think it will be again. <br/>
Letting him go with it on his own and giving him a tool of the <br/>
dictionary isn&#39;t going to works either as his need is greater then <br/>
the resources allows for. So how do I foster this new desire he has <br/>
with out spoiling it again for him. Either by it being so hard doing <br/>
it on his own he quits in frustration or I step in and give him tools <br/>
that don&#39;t help and frustrate him and he quits.<br/>
<br/>
My instinct after writing this is to do the dictation but the <br/>
schoolish part of me says no this is opportunity for him to learn <br/>
spelling.<br/>
Any suggestion<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-367860031">Go with your instinct. Do the dictation. What a wonderful gift he is <br/>
giving you of telling you the story as he goes! My brother, who makes <br/>
his living writing, gets freaked out if anyone reads what he is writing <br/>
before he is finished. Think about all the stories and moments of shared <br/>
joy you will be missing if you tell him that it is something he needs to <br/>
do on his own. You have this brilliant opportunity to be with your son.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373857644"><html>One of the good things the kids&#39; school taught us was to take dictation. At the time I was hesitant because *I&#39;d* always been told it was a child&#39;s job to write it out. But really, what is the long term goal? The long term goal was to foster a love of creative writing, and self expression. You are not harming the child in the slightest by facilitating that. Hank Zipzer is a great story with a child&#39;s point of view....his favorite teacher is the one who tells you how to spell a word without making you feel stupid. Every child feels that way...because really, when you&#39;re asking for help, that&#39;s the most basic tool! and think about regular development....every child goes through that phase, then they reach a point where they don&#39;t need you, or the process takes too long.<div><br class="ygrps-yiv-1373857644khtml-block-placeholder"></div><div>I&#39;d say to spell what he wants. Write what he wants. Offer him other tools like the computer to type (Josh loves to make stories with powerpoint because you can type, do pictures, and then it&#39;s a slide show) The hardest part for us schooly thoughts is to let misspelling go, but really do! I&#39;ve seen my kids misspell things over and over, and then weeks or months later come back and say &quot;Wow, that&#39;s misspelled!&quot;. <div><br class="ygrps-yiv-1373857644khtml-block-placeholder"></div><div>You&#39;re at a good place, why would you risk that?

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966002472"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; He wants to write a story. He want me or his dad to write the <br/>
&gt; story while he tells it to us. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And there you have the whole answer! He wants to write a story, and he <br/>
is clear about what help he wants from you to do it. Go for it!<br/>
<br/>
Writing and spelling are two different skill sets anyway. Plenty of <br/>
talented writers aren&#39;t great spellers--that&#39;s what spellcheck and <br/>
copy editors are for. And many, many great spellers are not good <br/>
writers. <br/>
<br/>
Right now, it sounds like he wants to play around with writing--<br/>
crafting a story. Confusing that with penmanship, poetry, punctuation, <br/>
papermaking, or spelling isn&#39;t likely to help him *or* your <br/>
relationship.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-240909782"><div>He&#39;s not even 9?&nbsp; And he has a great story to tell? Let him dictate it! Spell out whatever words he wants spelled. My kids haven&#39;t had a spelling lesson and they have all learned to spell. Some better than others, but they all spell.&nbsp;&nbsp; My 15 year old son was working on a 4-H project this morning, he has to write a short summery of what he learned with his pet this year. The worst thing I did for this kid was try to&nbsp;show him spelling rules! He is a very orderly, linear type kid and he wants every word to fit into some rule.&nbsp;He wants a few basic rules that will apply to all words. &nbsp;And we all know that the English language has more exceptions to the rules than words that follow the rules.....at least it feels that way to Karl!&nbsp; Spelling is not his strong suit and watching him this morning and seeing his frustration for how words are spelled, a light bulb finally went off! I told him to forget the rules. He has an amazing ability to memorize. I told him to just remember how the words are spelled instead of trying to figure out a pattern and rule for them. He has been trying to spell using a formula. I think if he can switch gears to memorizing instead of using a formula, he&#39;ll soon be a whiz and spelling. I, on the other hand, had all the usual years of spelling lessons and tests and still can&#39;t spell. Thank goodness for spell-check!

[from Pam Sorooshian to elsewhere some weeks ago, about spelling:]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just sent this post to my state group (apologies to those who are<br/>
on both). I think it might be useful for those people who have kids<br/>
who are reading later than they might feel comfortable with - but, if<br/>
you read down farther, there is also a part about my 15 yo daughter<br/>
and her spelling journey.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have three daughters - the first read at four and a half years old<br/>
and LOVED to read, play word games, started writing her own stories<br/>
at five, etc. She still writes and even runs writing workshops and<br/>
poetry marathons at camps and where she works, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The second learned to read all on her own at three years old - spent<br/>
a few weeks driving her older sister crazy by constantly asking her,<br/>
&#39;What&#39;s this word? What&#39;s this word?&quot; and then she had it figured<br/>
out. &quot;I&quot; didn&#39;t even know she could read - I wasn&#39;t expecting it,<br/>
wasn&#39;t looking for it, and it apparently happened so fast that I<br/>
missed it. My neighbor is the one who told me - she brought Roxana<br/>
back from playing at her house and said, &quot;I can&#39;t believe she reads<br/>
like that.&quot; I said, &quot;Hmmm, like what?&quot; She said, &quot;Well, she was<br/>
reading to the other kids.&quot; I had NO idea. So later I gave her some<br/>
books, ones we&#39;d never read together, and she read them. She&#39;s still<br/>
very very into words - at 18 she loves literature, linguistics,<br/>
etymology, theater, and anything else that has to do with words and<br/>
writing and will probably major in literature, in college. It is her<br/>
passion.<br/>
<br/>
My third child didn&#39;t learn to read until she was well into being<br/>
eight years old. She has a very very different learning style than<br/>
the other two and her focus was on other things. She&#39;s very physical<br/>
- loves sports (has been on a swim team, played soccer since she was<br/>
four, rides horses, and now is very into karate - and she&#39;s always<br/>
loved puzzles and games - especially strategy games and playing cards<br/>
(including figuring odds) and role-playing games. As the years went<br/>
by, she loved to listen to books and, as she got older, she got a<br/>
little frustrated that she couldn&#39;t read. I reminded her that<br/>
everybody is different and that she was learning all kinds of other<br/>
things and that reading would come, not to worry. I gave her some<br/>
help - we played a lot of word games, especially while driving in the<br/>
car, but, to be honest, she really wasn&#39;t &quot;getting&quot; the idea of<br/>
phonics and too much trying to play games based on phonics just got<br/>
her extremely frustrated and we&#39;d back off immediately. Slowly,<br/>
however, she built up a set of memorized words that she could easily<br/>
recognize. And she started trying to read words by guessing based on<br/>
the first letter and, a bit later, based on first and last letters.<br/>
We joined a theater group and she played the little Indian boy in &quot;A<br/>
Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream.&quot; She carried the script with her all<br/>
throughout the early rehearsals, just like everyone else, but &quot;I&quot;<br/>
knew she couldn&#39;t really read it. Night after night, she &quot;pretended&quot;<br/>
to be following the script. Then, one day, I walked in the front door<br/>
of our house and there she was, upside down, head on the floor, legs<br/>
up over the back of the couch &lt;G&gt;, reading out loud from the<br/>
Midsummer script, with GREAT expression, and reading ALL the parts,<br/>
not just her own. I thought - &quot;WOW - she&#39;s got quite a memory!!&quot; But<br/>
I had been fooled again - she was really reading (with a lot of help<br/>
from her memory of the show, of course). Somehow those weeks of<br/>
&quot;pretending&quot; to follow along in the script had allowed her to break<br/>
the code - she &quot;got&quot; the idea and she could suddenly read. That<br/>
ability transferred over to all reading material. That was it - she<br/>
read everything she could get her hands on. There were LOTS of words<br/>
she couldn&#39;t read, at first, because she didn&#39;t recognize them and<br/>
still wasn&#39;t &quot;sounding out&quot; well. But her reading improved super fast<br/>
and within a few months she was reading as well as my other kids had<br/>
been at eight years old - which was VERY advanced for their age -<br/>
high school, college level - as well as most adults.<br/>
<br/>
But, there is more - she STILL couldn&#39;t write anything that others<br/>
could understand because her spelling was SO poor. She couldn&#39;t<br/>
consistently spell common three-letter words correctly. She usually<br/>
got the right letters in the word, but added letters and mixed up the<br/>
order in odd ways. She spelled the word, &quot;dear,&quot; as &quot;derar,&quot; or<br/>
&quot;drenar,&quot; for example. Very far off - unreadable. And she had a habit<br/>
of sticking the letter &quot;n&quot; into words, seemingly randomly. Her<br/>
spelling problems continued for years - she was 13 years old and<br/>
still having trouble writing well enough for others to understand.<br/>
She wanted to do better, but I knew from my research that regular<br/>
spelling lessons were not likely to be helpful. I read a book called,<br/>
&quot;My Kid Can&#39;t Spell: Understanding and Assisting Your Child&#39;s<br/>
Literacy Development,&quot; by Richard Gentry. In that book, he talked<br/>
about a spelling disorder as a very distinct and separate thing from<br/>
other learning disorders, and he gave a lot of ways to cope with it<br/>
and to help a child or adult who really just can&#39;t spell. So, rather<br/>
than focus on her inability to spell and rather than banging our<br/>
heads against the wall with spelling lessons, etc.,  I helped my<br/>
daughter learn some of those coping skills. She liked that because it<br/>
helped her function better, immediately. Then she got AIM and started<br/>
talking, online, to friends. Her spelling was still so bad people<br/>
couldn&#39;t understand her, but one of her &quot;coping skills,&quot; was to just<br/>
try again with a different possible spelling. Turned out that if she<br/>
wrote a word a whole bunch of different possible ways, she could<br/>
usually recognize the correct spelling when she saw it, even though<br/>
she couldn&#39;t just write it down correctly, the first time. So, if<br/>
someone didn&#39;t understand her, she&#39;d just try again with a bit<br/>
different spelling. AND, she started to write stories - fan fiction -<br/>
online, too. For those she used spell checkers (which, as we all<br/>
know, only help so much), but, again, it was interesting that she<br/>
could nearly always pick the correct spelling out of the suggestions<br/>
made by the spell checker. Very slowly, her spelling was clearly<br/>
improving. She signed up for NANOWRIMO (National Novel Writing Month)<br/>
and wrote a 50,000 word novel in 30 days. Spelling wasn&#39;t great but<br/>
not NEARLY as bad as I&#39;d thought it would be. She continued to write<br/>
and chat with friends, online, and to read a lot. She did NANOWRIMO<br/>
again the next year. And after it was done, she went back and edited<br/>
it and painstakingly checked spelling until every word was correct<br/>
and Lulu press, a self-publishing company, published one copy of each<br/>
book completed by NANOWRIMO writers. So she got a lovely bound<br/>
published copy of her book. That was last November. She&#39;s 15. In the<br/>
months since then, she&#39;s become an outstanding speller - she spells<br/>
easily, now. She still asks, once in a while, to make sure she&#39;s<br/>
right, but she nearly always IS right. Last night she wasn&#39;t sure if<br/>
it should be &quot;resistance&quot; or &quot;resistence&quot; - but as soon as she asked<br/>
out loud she said, &quot;Oh, never mind, I know now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am SO glad that I didn&#39;t push her or insist on reading or spelling<br/>
lessons. I truly do not believe it would have helped her, I think it<br/>
would have created a power struggle between us and the main lessons<br/>
she would have learned would have been, &quot;Learning is hard,&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
not smart.&quot; Instead, I repeatedly pointed out the ways she WAS smart,<br/>
supported her in doing the things she was good at, the things she<br/>
loved, and put a high value on those things. I reassured her over and<br/>
over again, that reading would happen for her and I pointed out to<br/>
her how different people were different in so many ways. It helped<br/>
TREMENDOUSLY to have other families around who were also relaxed and<br/>
comfortable about later reading and who had kids who were later<br/>
readers. My daughter did read at 8, with isn&#39;t all that &quot;late&quot; - but<br/>
it was when she was showing no signs of learning to read at 5, 6, and<br/>
7, that things might have gone very differently, if I hadn&#39;t made the<br/>
decision to accept later reading as natural and normal &quot;for her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Other kids I know well were still not reading at 8, 9, 10, 11, and<br/>
even 12 or 13. They now read, read very very well, love books, love<br/>
learning. As older teens, they are well-educated, well-informed, and<br/>
well-read kids. If you want to hear more about later readers and how<br/>
wonderful it can be to support them in developing in their own way,<br/>
come to the Live and Learn conference and don&#39;t miss Dan Vilter&#39;s<br/>
talk - his son is turning 17 next week, didn&#39;t read until<br/>
very much later than the norm - and Dan has a LOT of insight to share<br/>
with those who are concerned about their later-reading children.<br/>

I made up a game while driving a long distance with my kids: rather <br/>
than asking the kids to spell, I spelled a word aloud and they figured <br/>
out what it was.  It&#39;s a cool game; you have to visualize the letters <br/>
as you hear them, which is a different skill than spelling, or reading, <br/>
or writing.<br/>

summery :-)))  which illustrates the limitations of spell checkers!)</div>

so concerned over it.&nbsp; Rather the same way I feel about memorizing all
those math facts. &nbsp;Why?&nbsp; We have calculators. &nbsp;Eventually, I
would think most kids would know them just by working with real math. &nbsp;Same
with spelling.&nbsp; There are spell checkers, dictionaries, and older people
to help. &nbsp;I have an 8 yr old dd.&nbsp; I spell any word that she asks.&nbsp;
I never make her look anything up.&nbsp; She likes to type on the computer plus
she has a blog. &nbsp;She uses the spell checker, and that has helped quite a
bit. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve always thought it would be insulting to tell someone when
they ask for a spelling &#8220;go look it up&#8221;. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t
understand that thinking.&nbsp; They can take 3 to 5 minutes to look it up or I
can reply immediately. &nbsp;Almost seems like a punishment for not being a
mature speller.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure the thought there is that by looking up
the word they will learn to spell it faster and it will stay in their long term
memory better. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t know about that.&nbsp; My older two both
spell okay. &nbsp;My oldest (16) isn&#8217;t what you call a natural born
speller, but she does fine. &nbsp;I still tell her how to spell words if she
asks.&nbsp; (I do the same for my husband.) &nbsp;My 14 yr old dd is a great
speller, but she likes words so it might be more natural for her. &nbsp;Also,
writing and spelling are not the same thing.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t kill a passion
for writing by making a spelling lesson out of it. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve typed lots
of stories for my girls as they dictated them. &nbsp;I think that&#8217;s a
great idea.&nbsp; That way, he&#8217;ll see the correct spelling, too, and he
won&#8217;t have to stress over making a mistake and will be able to
concentrate on the story.</span></font></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919810887">
<html><head>
 
 
<style></style>
</head>



 
<div>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;And there you have the whole answer! He wants to write a story, 
 </div></span></blockquote>and he <br>is clear about what help he wants from you to do it. Go for 
it!<br><br>Writing and spelling are two different skill sets anyway. Plenty of 
<br>talented writers aren&#39;t great spellers--that&#39; s what spellcheck and 
<br>copy editors are for. And many, many great spellers are not good 
<br>writers.&lt;&lt;&lt; <br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Good point! &nbsp;I think I am confusing writing and spelling skills and 
what he is wanting to do.&nbsp; I think it came form when I said something to 
him and he freaked out and said he couldn&#39;t do that because he couldn&#39;t spell. 
If I peruse spelling and writing&nbsp;with him it&nbsp;will discourage him form 
every wanting to write again. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I did teach him to read from birth and he was successfully completing 
jumpstart preschool and &nbsp;kindergarten on the computer&nbsp;when he was 9 
months old.&nbsp; I was his mouse. &nbsp;So when kindergarten came along I 
really thought he&#39;d just start reading out loud. I knew he knew how to read but 
he would just freeze up if for a second he thought he was reading it 
wrong.&nbsp; He is perfectionist. &nbsp;I remember at about 2 1/2 we were 
looking at a gerbil but I mistakenly called it a hamster he corrected me and 
said gerbil. I asked how he knew he pointed to the sign. So I pushed for him to 
read out loud and read books to me, thinking obviously he was ready. The next 
few years were really bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;He&nbsp; shut down and refused to read 
anything and wouldn&#39;t even let us read to him.&nbsp;So I didn&#39;t want to repeat 
that mistake. We&#39;ve just started coming back from that&nbsp;place.&nbsp;&nbsp;He 
uses google and we have many computer programs, I love to spelling, &nbsp;Disney 
learning read, &nbsp;Jump starts, DK&nbsp; dictionary,&nbsp;typing tutor and so 
much more. I just got him a new Scooby Doo computer program he finished it in 
less then&nbsp;2 hours the entire game.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#39;s known how to read music 
from age 2 but every time he sees a new song he just freaks out saying he can&#39;t 
read it.&nbsp; Really he did refuse to do read anything.&nbsp;Now that he is 
finally asking about spelling I am&nbsp;happily spelling for him&nbsp;without 
any pressure. We use the spell checker to get the spelling.&nbsp;He&#39;s just now 
finding it&#39;s something that he wants to do rather then what I had wanted him to 
do. So if I start to show him something like how to use the dictionary it better 
be a quick&nbsp; lesson or I loose his interest, &nbsp;if it&#39;s not easy for him 
he freezes.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&#39;m sure he&#39;s still nervous I&#39;m going to make him sit 
and do formal studies again. It&#39;s only been a 1 1/2&nbsp; years since&nbsp;we&#39;ve 
gone back to unschooling. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It&#39;s very easy to step back into a more formal <u>teaching</u> and 
I&nbsp;knew we couldn&#39;t go there again. I knew he needed to write this story. 
He&#39;s been trying for some time. &nbsp;I just couldn&#39;t get past that he had to do 
it by himself. Now that I think about it that just crazy thinking on my 
part.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We do a lot of back door type reading, listening to stories on CD&#39;s TV and 
video games. He has great comprehension and a great imagination he act out 
movies with his action figures ,has long dialogs and voices for each charter. It 
was just hard for me to think of a back door type writing and spelling skills to 
help him to the next step. I was making it more difficult then need be. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As soon as I posted this morning&nbsp; I went with my instincts and&nbsp;we 
began the story. He dictated it to me and he&#39;s so excited. He wanted to act it 
out as he tells me the story. We&#39;re going to add his drawings to the 
story&nbsp;then take it to staples where they will bind it in a book. He&#39;s so 
excited.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>His dream is to either be actor or co writer with Stan Lee on his next 
film. He wrote a letter to Stan Lee a few weeks ago. &nbsp; I did try to get him 
to write&nbsp;in&nbsp;a journal and he dabbled with it drawing pictures but was 
frustrated because he wanted to write a story and he wasn&#39;t confident about his 
drawings.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think making his&nbsp;own book will inspire him to do 
more which is what I want for him to be self-confident. It&#39;s nice to see him 
draw. Thanks for all your responses it helped a lot. &nbsp;I appreciate your 
advise.</div>
<div>T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I&#39;m more like your husband Sandra, &nbsp;spelling isn&#39;t my&nbsp;best 
subject, typing either.&nbsp; but I keep trying <img title="Smiley emoticon"

 <br/>
He didn&#39;t just know it didn&#39;t say hamster he said &quot; gerbil &quot; to me. <br/>
He read it out loud to me. He was quite instant it was a gerbil. I <br/>
then asked how he knew it was a gerbil and not a hamster I thought he <br/>
might tell by the look of him.  It was then he pointed to the sign <br/>
and said gerbil again. Very clearly which is why I looked at the sign <br/>
and read it my self because I thought it was a hamster and I was <br/>
surprised the sign said gerbil. <br/>
 <br/>
That was just one example of his early reading and comprehension.<br/>
 <br/>
I realize now he wasn&#39;t ready for reading in the sense of reading out <br/>
loud or chapter books demonstrating his ability in a formal way.  But <br/>
everywhere else in society it is pushed to be a early reader no <br/>
matter what damage it may cause. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Be careful about putting things on this list that won&#39;t help <br/>

 <br/>
IMO Bad example of things are a good way to see unschooling better <br/>
and for others to see the damage it can cause. I don&#39;t put it out <br/>
there as a wow try this, because it didn&#39;t work and damaged the <br/>
relationship. I can&#39;t ignore that we did this method of early reading <br/>
with him. It didn&#39;t work in a positive way or the way we expected and <br/>
it had negative consequences, unrealistic expectation and caused much <br/>
damage to our relationship. <br/>
 <br/>
A good example of what not to do. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are two points.<br/>
<br/>
One: Early reading wasn&#39;t the negative. It was not listening to what  <br/>
the child said he wanted and didn&#39;t want to do. So what you  <br/>
experienced is more universal than trying to get a child to read  <br/>
early. It applies to any areas of a child&#39;s life we try to mold to  <br/>
our liking against a child&#39;s wishes. Schools try to push all sorts of  <br/>
information and skills into kids and mold them into &quot;college prepared  <br/>
products&quot; but when the child has no interest, one result can be  <br/>
pulling back and never wanting to have anything to do with that  <br/>
knowledge or those skills.<br/>
<br/>
Two: From your story it appears you believe you taught him to read.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids figure out reading at 2 because that&#39;s the way their brains  <br/>
are wired but a parent can&#39;t begin with any infant and have them  <br/>
reading by 2.<br/>
<br/>
And it doesn&#39;t help anyone unschool to think that there&#39;s an  <br/>
advantage *to the child* even if there were some program to have any  <br/>
child reading at 2. Why would 2 yos need to read? How would it help  <br/>
them to be better 2 yos?<br/>
<br/>
Not that a 2 yo who does figure out reading should be stopped! ;-)  <br/>
Just as with any unschooled child, help them do what they&#39;re trying  <br/>
to do and listen to them when their actions say back off.<br/>
<br/>
As you point out our society is full of messages that the earlier the  <br/>
better for all things academic. Have them read at 2, calculus at 6,  <br/>
Harvard at 8.<br/>
<br/>
But unschoolers want people to think about what purpose is there *to  <br/>
a child* to rush through childhood? What advantage *to the child* is  <br/>
there in spending time at 3 trying to do things they will do  <br/>
effortlessly at 12? Getting young kids to do older kid and adult  <br/>
things just steals time away from them doing 2 yo and 3 yo and 4 yo  <br/>
things that they *can&#39;t* do when they&#39;re older.<br/>
<br/>
Trying to find ways to get typical kids to do things that geniuses  <br/>
often do spontaneously doesn&#39;t turn typical kids into geniuses.<br/>
<br/>
(Note, that isn&#39;t commentary on what you believe. It&#39;s commentary on  <br/>
the idea of getting early academics into kids.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-474414935">Several days ago when this topic was first introduced, I wrote a lengthy<br/>
reply. I felt like I could finally contribute to help someone else.<br/>
Unfortunately, I sat down to write it as my sink was filling with water to<br/>
wash the dishes because my dishwasher wasn&#39;t working right.  I forgot about<br/>
the running water until my kids came in from swimming and told me it was all<br/>
over the kitchen.  &lt;sigh&gt; It had run down into my dh&#39;s office below,<br/>
wrecking books and computer parts, etc.  Sometimes I feel like I am getting<br/>
my come-uppance because I used to complain, in my younger days, about other<br/>
people&#39;s inability to multi-task.  Seems it gets harder all the time for me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So, after all the clean up, I came back to the computer only to find that an<br/>
error had occurred in Firefox and it shut down without my having saved the<br/>
post, which was written on the yahoo site not in my email program. &lt;bigger<br/>
sigh&gt;  Since that day I&#39;ve been quite busy and haven&#39;t managed to sit back<br/>
down and get my thoughts written out.  (We went to Pony Club Dressage Rally<br/>
on Saturday and the girls&#39; team took 5th place, which was AWESOME!  We were<br/>
gone from 5:15 a.m. till 8:15 p.m. though, very long day)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My advice was to please take dictation for the youngster who wanted his mom<br/>
to write his story down.  My youngest dd&#39;s (9) inspiration for learning to<br/>
write came from her desire to communicate with pen pals and to get her<br/>
stories down.  She began having pen pals at 4.5 years old (older cousins and<br/>
their friends) and I had to point to each letter for her to copy so she<br/>
could write to them.  She loved it and that was her first interest in the<br/>
written word.  Sometimes when her arm or hand got tired, I&#39;d write for her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Shortly after that, she began story telling stories and I would take<br/>
dictation for her for hours.  After about a three hour stint I would need a<br/>
break and she would be frustrated because she still had a story to tell.<br/>
(We have MANY on our computer and they are such a treasure!)  We solved the<br/>
problem by getting her a tape recorder and then I could type them at my<br/>
leisure.  But just having the tape recorder to tape them also made her feel<br/>
empowered to not have to wait on me to do the typing.  Sometimes we never<br/>
got them typed out but she felt good about telling her stories.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What always amazed me was that I often couldn&#39;t imagine how she was going to<br/>
tie all the different chapters together in the end because they all seemed<br/>
too disconnected, but she always pulled it off.  I found it amazing.  I have<br/>
a much more linear way of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I never turned it into a lesson, yet she learned to spell and<br/>
punctuate very well regardless of that.  It really all started to come<br/>
together when she got her own email address and began writing to friends.<br/>
She now has several pen pals that she got through Young Rider (common<br/>
interest of horses) that she writes to by email and snail mail. She also has<br/>
one email horse-friend that she met on neopets that she writes to almost<br/>
daily.  This girl is 14 yo but she also loves to ride dressage, which is<br/>
Lilly&#39;s riding style of choice.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Lilly doesn&#39;t choose to bother to punctuate all her emails<br/>
correctly, but I know she knows how to.  She learned it by watching me<br/>
punctuate her stories and letters when she was done writing them.  She often<br/>
now types her own stories and she&#39;s quick on the keyboard although she still<br/>
hunts and pecks.  I just happened to write something on one of the white<br/>
boards in the barn the other day and just out of curiosity, I asked the<br/>
girls if they could punctuate it and they both did it correctly.  (9 yo<br/>
missed a comma, I think)  The sentence was:  Sugar says, &quot;don&#39;t forget to<br/>
fly spray and sunblock me.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I still find it so encouraging to see that as the kids see a need for<br/>
something, they are quick to learn it, whether or not it is an easy thing to<br/>
do.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I was also going to comment on the summer library programs to get kids<br/>
reading.  I was going to say that my kids signed up one year when they were<br/>
maybe 5 and 7 and they were so disappointed by the prizes.  We just wrote<br/>
down the books that we read anyway and that was enough (I could read to them<br/>
at that age) to qualified for the cheesey prizes they gave out.  They gave<br/>
the kids plastic trolls.  They never wanted to do it again.that is till<br/>
yesterday.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We were at Barnes and Noble and when we checked out (bought some new<br/>
madlibs, which my kids love) they asked if we were in the summer reading<br/>
program.  They sent us home with the forms which I thought we&#39;d throw away,<br/>
but alas, dd (9) was interested when she learned that you can get a free<br/>
book.  You have to read 8 books, then you get a free book. (and you don&#39;t<br/>
have to buy them there)  As she sat in the chair at home later on reading a<br/>
book so she could mark it down, she looked up and commented, &quot;If they have<br/>
this program to bribe children to read, why do they give them a free book as<br/>
a prize?  I would think the kids who need to be bribed to read wouldn&#39;t want<br/>
another book that their parents will probably make them read.&quot;  LOL!  I<br/>
thought that was very insightful.  She went on to say that they should give<br/>
away money or something that kids who don&#39;t like to read would like.  She<br/>
went on to say that she likes to read and couldn&#39;t wait to get a free book.<br/>
That said, she&#39;s only read a handful of books in her young life so far.  She<br/>
does read constantly while playing games, emailing, playing online games,<br/>
reading short non-fiction snippets, etc.  The books she usually chooses are<br/>
not easy reader books, but pretty long chapter books.  She did however, look<br/>
at the length of the books that she would be reading in order to get the<br/>
free book and she chose based on books that not only interested her, but<br/>
weren&#39;t TOO long so that she could finish 8 of them before summer is over.<br/>
(She picked a Junie B. Jones book for the program but she is also reading a<br/>
Phantom Stallion book on the side that is much longer and more difficult to<br/>
read.)  She read one Junie B. Jones book in one sitting last night.  I am so<br/>
glad that I didn&#39;t push reading and that I&#39;ve let the girls come to it in<br/>
their own time and way.  Hearing the words, &quot;I love to read&quot; makes me happy.<br/>
That was my goal for my kids with regard to reading.  I just wanted them to<br/>
like it.<br/>

Yesterday Holly said that now she feels like she would be able to  <br/>
handle anything she might ever need to read.  I told her I didn&#39;t  <br/>
know she&#39;d been worried about it.  She said she was a little worried  <br/>
about driver&#39;s ed (which she intends to take in November), but she&#39;s  <br/>
not worried anymore.   I guess she had picked up some kids&#39; books and  <br/>
just flown through them.  She&#39;s read several &quot;young adult novels&quot; and  <br/>
reads on the internet quite a bit.    Oh, I asked &quot;even cursive?&quot; and  <br/>
she said no, not cursive.   The other day there was something or other <br/>
�a letter from ten years ago or so�and I read it and summarized what  <br/>
was in it as I was reading.  When it was clear to her that I was  <br/>
reading something from the closing paragraph, she said &quot;You can read  <br/>
cursive as fast as you can read print?&quot;   I said yes, if it was  <br/>
fairly clear or I knew the person&#39;s handwriting.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing Holly can&#39;t do, at 14, besides read cursive fluently is  <br/>
to scan.  She can&#39;t scan a list or directory or menu.   She doesn&#39;t  <br/>
know yet how to ignore the words she doesn&#39;t want to read.  She&#39;s  <br/>
asked me sometimes how it is that I can find things on a menu, so I  <br/>
showed her what I skip.  Drinks, beef, seafood�I&#39;m headed for chicken  <br/>
or combinations or specials.   When I had kids, I looked at the kids&#39;  <br/>
menu first.     Somehow Kirby and Marty had no problem with that, and  <br/>
just as I was typing this I think I&#39;ve realized why.  Most of their  <br/>
reading started off being gaming manuals and little rules booklets  <br/>
for card games and complicated board games.  They skimmed before they  <br/>
really read, probably.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
About a year or two ago I came to terms with the fact that my kids may never<br/>
enjoy reading the way I do.  And I am really ok with that. (and my older dd<br/>
has never uttered those words although she reads a lot, mostly magazines and<br/>
non-fiction) However, I get so much pleasure and information from reading<br/>
that I still have always hoped that they would one day find it an enjoyable<br/>
thing to do too.  Hearing my dd utter the words, &quot;I love reading&quot; really<br/>
does make me happy.  I am happy that she has found one more thing that she<br/>
enjoys.  I hope that she gets as much enjoyment out of reading as I have<br/>
over the years.  I enjoy fiction and non-fiction.  I enjoy the internet,<br/>
email, and these lists.  Reading has really broadened my horizons and I hope<br/>
that it does the same for my children. It makes me happy to see that they<br/>
are happy learners.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Funny story:  My younger dd has been going with a public schooled friend to<br/>
a teacher&#39;s house after school for tutoring once a week.  (the friend gets<br/>
tutored and Lilly just goes along)  The teacher just so happens to be my<br/>
husband&#39;s aunt who, when she heard we were going to homeschool 6 years ago<br/>
said, &quot;I am very sorry for your children.&quot;  Ack!  Anyway, somehow or another<br/>
Lilly got invited once because the teacher and the friend were at the barn<br/>
together where both girls take lessons and the friend asked if she could<br/>
come along.  Ever since that one time, Lilly has been invited to come every<br/>
week because the friend not only acts better when Lilly is there, but she<br/>
also cooperates better for her lessons.  The teacher often makes a game of<br/>
the lessons and Lilly happily plays along.  The teacher has commented<br/>
several times to my husband that Lilly is such a pleasure to have around and<br/>
such a nice kid.  I don&#39;t place a lot of value on her opinion for a couple<br/>
reasons, but it made me chuckle to hear it.<br/>
