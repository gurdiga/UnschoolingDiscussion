<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243322347">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Sounds interesting.  I am a 57 year old full time dad.  We have two<br/>
older daughters, 10 and 14, who are in public school, and a 7 year old<br/>
son that I home school.  We adopted the girls from Russia two years ago,<br/>
and I home schooled them for the first year.  Now, they are in public<br/>
school, but I still home school my son, Taylor.  <br/>
<br/>
We always had the idea of home schooling Taylor, because he seems<br/>
especially bright.  The homeschooling is paying off very well, as he<br/>
functions way above grade level in all subjects.  He loves it, and I<br/>
love it.  We work hard and play hard every day.<br/>
<br/>
We would be happy to participate,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Dear Friends,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My name is Rhonda Barfield and I&#39;m an author (some of you may have heard of<br/>
&gt; my books,15-Minute Cooking and Eat Healthy for $50 a Week) and homeschooling<br/>
&gt; mother of four. I need your help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m writing a book on lifestyles of homeschooling families, and I&#39;m looking<br/>
&gt; for a wide variety of parents who are of all races, religions, and homeschool<br/>
&gt; philosophies, as well as from many different regions of the U.S. I am<br/>
&gt; purposely avoiding well-known homeschoolers, preferring to write about<br/>
&gt; everyday people. High on my priority list are homeschoolers who are Hispanic<br/>
&gt; and/or immigrants, fathers who homeschool, observant Jews, people of other<br/>
&gt; religions, people who live in a large city like New York, and unschoolers, as<br/>
&gt; I have plenty of contacts for WASP families. Would some of you be interested<br/>
&gt; in being included as one of the &lt;&lt;stories&gt;&gt; in my book?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your part would involve answering about 50 questions, either by phone or<br/>
&gt; e-mail, about how homeschool works in your family. I will take the answers<br/>
&gt; and write them up as a story. Then you get a rough draft, to make sure of<br/>
&gt; accuracy and your approval or suggestions for change. I finalize, send you a<br/>
&gt; second draft, you approve and that&#39;s that. I would include the first and last<br/>
&gt; names of each member of your family, but no city, only a state. You may be<br/>
&gt; asked to provide some photos.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The book will be published by Kensington Publishing in New York and<br/>
&gt; distributed nationally. I&#39;m negotiating with my publisher so that every<br/>
&gt; participating family will receive at least a couple of free copies of the<br/>
&gt; book, tentatively called &lt;&lt;Real-Life Homeschooling: The Stories of 25<br/>
&gt; Families Who Teach Their Children at Home.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please let me know if any of you are interested in being part of this book.<br/>
&gt; Thank you in advance!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
