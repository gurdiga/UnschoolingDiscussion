Nor can I imagine Jesus striking a child.  Yet it seems to be some<br/>
&quot;Christians&quot; who believe are most defensive of their spanking.  I never<br/>
found striking my 4 children as neccessary.  And yet they came through the<br/>
&#39;60s drug age and the &quot;blackboard jungle&quot; and the riots of the &#39;60s with our<br/>
be violent and are still solid citizens doing well for themselves and for<br/>
society.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I recognize Bill, that you are not necessarily smearing all Christians<br/>
with this post, but for clarification purposes as I responded earlier in<br/>
this debate, I will state that it is only &quot;certain&quot; Christians who have<br/>
totally misquoted and misinterpreted scripture, who see it as their<br/>
&quot;duty&quot; to spank children.  This is not Orthodox Christian thought.  This<br/>
understanding by otherwise well-meaning individuals is a complete<br/>
bastardization of translation and not what God intended for His dear<br/>
treasures - the CHILDREN.<br/>
