<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053341096">Sorry if this has been &quot;resolved&quot;... I&#39;m way behind in reading my<br/>
digests... it&#39;s artificial blue coloring that does it. Turns poop green,<br/>
I mean. I figured it out after I started drinking Blue Coconut beverages<br/>
at Sonic. It was very entertaining ~:^ )<br/>
<br/>
Something tells me all that artificial coloring can&#39;t be good for ya.<br/>
