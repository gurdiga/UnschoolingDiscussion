Diana has said that they would love to receive flowers.  The weather is<br/>
gloomy and some color would brighten their days.  Anyone who wants to send<br/>
flowers can send them to her home:<br/>
<br/>
1218 South First Avenue<br/>
Sioux Falls, SD 57105<br/>
<br/>
Also, they are putting together a slideshow, and would appreciate people<br/>
emailing any photos they would like to be included on the dvd to Karen<br/>

I asked Kelli what we could do for Hayden. She feels very strongly<br/>
that the<br/>
computer fund is the best thing we can do for him - that it&#39;s<br/>
something that<br/>
would really bring him joy.  So anything that can be done as far as<br/>
spreading the word about and contributing to the fundraising site<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dianasheart.com/)">http://www.dianasheart.com/)</a> will be greatly appreciated.<br/>
One idea Kathryn and I had for the NE conference was the possibility of<br/>
running a $10/ticket raffle.  My first thought was that maybe we could put<br/>
together another quilt. Unfortunately I&#39;m useless with a needle, so this<br/>
idea would require a volunteer to put the quilt together.  If anyone would<br/>
be willing to volunteer or has another idea for something we could raffle,<br/>
please let us know.<br/>
