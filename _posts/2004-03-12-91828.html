&gt;<br/>
&gt; Welcome:-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>thank you.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well if you mean normal as in what the &quot;norm&quot; in today&#39;s society is, I would<br/>
say yes.<br/>
<br/>
--Yes that&#39;s what I meant by &quot;normal.&quot; Get the nursery room ready and the<br/>
crib up, get signed up for preschool, all that. Dont let your kid nurse on<br/>
demand(why let them tell you when  they are hungry...lets teach them to<br/>
ignore their bodies while they are young, there goes THAT boundary)<br/>
I just did what felt right, asked for many opinions (I had bad<br/>
parenting..was clueless about good &quot;normal&quot; or healthy parenting.) read a<br/>
lot, watched what&#39;s her name??, the British woman who was on PBS years<br/>
ago...she really gave me courage to put my child first.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;ve been amazed at the number of people I run across lately saying their<br/>
children have been diagnosed with one of these diseases.<br/>
<br/>
----Yes the percentage of immmune system diseases is very high now compared<br/>
to even 20 years ago. There&#39;s a new book out discussing this. Lab 257-- Plum<br/>
Island. I may have the title a bit off. By Michael Carroll.<br/>
Looks interesting. Hope he doesn&#39;t get hurt for writing it.(telling the<br/>
truth can be risky you know)<br/>
<br/>
. I think we live in a society of overdiansosis<br/>
<br/>
or misdiagnosis = mistreatment. I agree there.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m from NC btw. Do you have any idea what area you will be looking in?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>--I am looking in the outlying areas of Raleigh, Oxford, Zebulon, and also<br/>
the outlying regions of Huntersville, above Charlotte as far west as Burke<br/>
Cty, altho I love the area of Black Mtn. Looking for a small farm, with some<br/>
pasture barn and a decent house. Where are you? I went to HS in Henderson,<br/>
and college in Greenville. Feel free to contact me by email.<br/>
thanks for the nice welcome I enjoy reading here and feel at home. Glad to<br/>
connect with other parents who are geared this way. Not too much of our<br/>
society makes much sense to me. BTW I am a former art teacher. (at least<br/>
most of the kids enjoyed my classes...)<br/>

&gt;   Hi I am new here and have been reading for a few weeks. I find it quite<br/>
&gt;   refreshing and totally natural.I wonder if you mind a few questions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>we<br/>
