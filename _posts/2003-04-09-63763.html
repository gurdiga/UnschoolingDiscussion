<div id="ygrps-yiv-270502460">When my son went to his second time there the teacher told him he had to give her the stool because it was circle time. He has always been one to not give up lightly so he refused. Of course she used her power and he sat on the floor while she sat on the chair. He never went back and knew that school was not completely for him.<br/>
<br/>
He went to  a Montessori kindergarten and liked it fine as long as they left him alone to do his tasks.When they didn&#39;t then he would no longer want to be there. As it turned out he came home half way through because his sisters were coming home. They have never looked back. <br/>
<br/>
There cousin whose mother is a teacher comes over and for a long time they would play teacher. I noticed the teacher was always bossy, pushy,and demanding. The cousin would play the teacher or a really defiant kid in class.Guess they worked it out cause now they just play Yu Gi Oh.<br/>
