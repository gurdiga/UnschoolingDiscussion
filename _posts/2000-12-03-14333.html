<div id="ygrps-yiv-133496356">but one whose existance depends upon consumerism<br/>
<br/>
Your existance must depend on consumerism; you live in a capitalist <br/>
state. One can practice cooperative socialism or the like, but may <br/>
only take it so far when the econemy and social structure in which <br/>
one exists is capitalist.  I recently whent on a search for a <br/>
socially responsible mutual fund.  I looked at Pax, Domini, and the <br/>
rest, adn was satisfied with none.  Nike here, Wal-mart there, Intel <br/>
over there.  I expressed my frustration to a long-time socialist and <br/>
wa-resistor.  He basically told me the same thing I am stating here.  <br/>
One cannot live purely in a socialist of communist or anarchist way <br/>
unless one is living on land far away from society and self-<br/>
sustaining.  There is a community like this in Denmark, Christiana (I <br/>
think I spelled that right).  Ther are pretty much a self-sustaining <br/>
community.  And the Danish government leaves them alone.  Of course, <br/>
Denmark is socialist (as is Sweeden, Norway, France, Germany, . . .)  <br/>
You would never see that in this country.<br/>
<br/>
What one must do then is to use the power of the consumerm, the laws <br/>
of supply and demand, to force the economy further in the wanted <br/>
direction.  Just like what you are asking.  Take hemp papere for <br/>
example.  Demand is low, supply is low, prices are high.  If however, <br/>
demand were to increase, and systenms were developed to mass produce <br/>
hemp paper, it would cost less than wood paper today (the production <br/>
requires less resources).  It&#39;s hard because most often those of us <br/>
who wish for that utopian economy are those who can afford the higher <br/>
prices of &quot;buying right&quot;.  Instead our pocket books tell us to go to <br/>
Wal-mart instead of the family business on the corner.<br/>
<br/>
OK, I&#39;m rambling (it is just too hard to express a truly solid <br/>
argument for these without writing a book; everything is integral to <br/>
the everything else).  The points are:<br/>
<br/>
1)  If you live in today&#39;s America, you have to participate in <br/>
consumerism to survive. The question is to what degree should you <br/>
participate in consumerism (X-mas is all about profits as far as the <br/>
markets are concerned, but that is another story).<br/>
<br/>
2)  One must support food coops, art coops, and the rest whenever <br/>
possible to increase awareness, drive down prices in that market, and <br/>
decrease revenues in others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194812935">About a year and a half ago we began grocery shopping at a natural food <br/>
store so we could buy more organic items. This was mainly my idea and, at <br/>
first, my husband would complain about the increase in our grocery bill <br/>
(about $25 per week). Now he has gotten used to it. Plus, he sees that we <br/>
actually buy less junk and throw away less food. Our choices are more <br/>
deliberate. We used to buy large quantities of things because they were on <br/>
sale, stockpile them (esp. canned goods) for future use or assume we could <br/>
eat that much (with a family of only three!), then throw them away months <br/>
later when they had passed their expiration dates or had rotted in the <br/>
refrigerator.  It was a waste. Now we eat almost everything we buy before <br/>
our next shopping trip. I am working on using less paper, plastic and <br/>
cleaners. My son is learning along with us, about the ingredients in foods <br/>
and recycling, etc.<br/>
<br/>
You are right about consumer support of environmentally-friendly items <br/>
being important. I think it will eventually bring the prices down; someone <br/>
has to start somewhere if that is what one supports.  I have been reading a <br/>
lot about organic cotton and hemp and would love to see more products made <br/>
of these materials, but the prices now are so high that they are <br/>
prohibitive for most of us. It is really hard to justify (esp. to DH) <br/>
spending $50 for a pair of organic cotton pants when I could get the same, <br/>
non-organic pair at a discount store for $15. It is my goal for  2001 to <br/>
try to &quot;put my money where my mouth is&quot; when it comes to &quot;green&quot; living <br/>
whenever I can.<br/>
<br/>
I think I may have asked this before, but does anyone know of a discussion <br/>
list online that deals with transitioning to a more &quot;green&quot; lifestyle?<br/>

&gt; We grow our own fruits and vegetables. I prefer no meat but my son and<br/>
honey<br/>
&gt; loves it ( YUK) I also grow our own herbs and some spices. So if I could<br/>
&gt; only find an organic grocer here I would be hapy!!<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;About a year and a half ago we began grocery shopping at a natural food<br/>
&gt; &gt;store so we could buy more organic items. This was mainly my idea and, at<br/>
&gt; &gt;first, my husband would complain about the increase in our grocery bill<br/>
&gt; &gt;(about $25 per week). Now he has gotten used to it. Plus, he sees that we<br/>
&gt; &gt;actually buy less junk and throw away less food. Our choices are more<br/>
&gt; &gt;deliberate. We used to buy large quantities of things because they were<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; &gt;sale, stockpile them (esp. canned goods) for future use or assume we<br/>
could<br/>
&gt; &gt;eat that much (with a family of only three!), then throw them away months<br/>
&gt; &gt;later when they had passed their expiration dates or had rotted in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;refrigerator.  It was a waste. Now we eat almost everything we buy before<br/>
&gt; &gt;our next shopping trip. I am working on using less paper, plastic and<br/>
&gt; &gt;cleaners. My son is learning along with us, about the ingredients in<br/>
foods<br/>
&gt; &gt;and recycling, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;You are right about consumer support of environmentally-friendly items<br/>
&gt; &gt;being important. I think it will eventually bring the prices down;<br/>
someone<br/>
&gt; &gt;has to start somewhere if that is what one supports.  I have been reading<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt;lot about organic cotton and hemp and would love to see more products<br/>
made<br/>
&gt; &gt;of these materials, but the prices now are so high that they are<br/>
&gt; &gt;prohibitive for most of us. It is really hard to justify (esp. to DH)<br/>
&gt; &gt;spending $50 for a pair of organic cotton pants when I could get the<br/>
same,<br/>
&gt; &gt;non-organic pair at a discount store for $15. It is my goal for  2001 to<br/>
&gt; &gt;try to &quot;put my money where my mouth is&quot; when it comes to &quot;green&quot; living<br/>
&gt; &gt;whenever I can.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I think I may have asked this before, but does anyone know of a<br/>
discussion<br/>
&gt; &gt;list online that deals with transitioning to a more &quot;green&quot; lifestyle?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;This is a great point. I&#39;m so excited to see very mainstream things<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;going<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;organic&quot;. I picked up some Gold Medal organic flour at my local<br/>
&gt; &gt;supermarket<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;for Christmas baking. General Mills is making an organic breakfast<br/>
&gt; &gt;cereal,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Western Family now has organic apple juice in the gigantic economy jug,<br/>
&gt; &gt;etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;etc. Obviously, all  us people &quot;voting with our dollars&quot; are doing some<br/>
&gt; &gt;good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;if the mainstream companies are starting to purchase organically grown<br/>
&gt; &gt;items<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;for their products.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;My husband often despairs over our grocery bill because it&#39;s 25% higher<br/>
&gt; &gt;than<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;it would be if I didn&#39;t buy organic/local and shop at our neighborhood<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;store. I figure as long as we can afford it, or during the times in<br/>
which<br/>
&gt; &gt;we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;can afford it, we should do it to &quot;pave the way&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570427109">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been checking in on the list and the whole consumerism topic.  I&#39;d<br/>
like to join a list too.  We sure are bombarded with consumerism.  It<br/>
would be nice to have a greenparenting list.   Or would organicparenting<br/>
be better.  I&#39;ve been teaching my son that you can often make things<br/>
rather than buy them.  Most of our Christmas gifts are handmade.  Nice<br/>
to hear of so many other folks bringing up the same issue.  If any of<br/>
you folks out there are of a Christian background or even if you are not<br/>
get a hold of Earthministry.  You can get a hold of them a<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:emoffice@...">emoffice@...</a>.  They also have a websight.    They had a<br/>
book review of a book called &quot;Stories of the Land: A Place-basssed<br/>
Envirionmental Education Anthololgy&quot;   I haven&#39;t seen it but it&#39;s<br/>
designed to teach children about their own backyard envirionment and<br/>
designed for schools.  I want to get a copy through the library if<br/>
possible.  Well back to making more Christmas presents.  I&#39;m currently<br/>
making velvet shopping bags (using velvet scraps given to me) with<br/>
canvas liners with canvas my husband last job through out.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
