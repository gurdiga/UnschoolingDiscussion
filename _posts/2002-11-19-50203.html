&lt;&lt; Hey, I&#39;m gonna have to use this one! I never quite thought about it <br/>
 that way. Problem is, dh might decide to turn the tables on me and <br/>
 use the same excuse to fill the garage with power tools!!&lt;LOL&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But power tools are SO useful!! I love power tools. I shop with dh for new <br/>
tools and get all excited when I find one with great features (like that <br/>
adjustable compound miter saw I&#39;ve been drooling over :).<br/>
<br/>
The book issue drives dh batty though.<br/>
He bought me &quot;Going Home&quot; by Thich Nhat Hanh a couple nights ago, and when I <br/>
begged for it he said &quot;You&#39;re supposed to be getting RID of books, not <br/>
getting MORE&quot; in an exasperated tone. I asked him since when??!!<br/>
He bought it anyway. :)<br/>
