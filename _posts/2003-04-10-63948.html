 </span></blockquote>Hi Yoki, I&#39;m not sure if you had a chance to read the post about dinosaurs, but my daughter is 4 and well to say the least she is into dinosaurs at the moment. Your right there aren&#39;t too many things out there to do hands on with the dinosaurs, so Kiele and I made up our own, we made a dinosaur game using posterboard, markers, and dinosaur figures the object of the game was to get to the cave first.  We used dice and made the spaces look like dinosaur footprints, Kiele colored them in and drew some of her own dinosaurs along side of them.  I drew a volcano, some trees, a T-Rex and she colored all of this in.  On some of the spaces I marked things like chased by a T-rex go back 2 spaces, not enough food go back to start, can&#39;t find water, go back 3 and well you get the picture.  She loves it and has asked to make other games.  Another thing that we did was making our own fossils.  I bought plaster of paris (you can find it at walmart)took some sand from the sandbox , and then she pressed some of her smaller dinosaur figures into the sand to make impressions, removed the dinosaurs and filled in the impressions with the plaster of paris.  After it was dry she excavated and played &quot;Palentologist&quot; using a paintbrush to clean off all the sand, then she painted the dinosaurs.  We also did this with sea shells!  If you need more ideas here are some links...<br/>

  It is easier said than done to shut my mother up. She has been the source of many issues and therapists for both me and another sister of mine. The things is that...I don&#39;t know... it seems as if I am failing. I have heard that it is not important for a child to read, or forced to read at 5, I have a friend was a former public school teacher who homeschools her children, tell me the same thing. Just go by when they are ready. But when you have a mother who insists on this MUST be done by such and such an age.....can you sense some issues here with me, lol.<br/>
<br/>
  What interests the children. That is a good thing. They both love to talk and are fascinated with stories. The boy with dinosaurs and the other with any thing hands on. So I guess that is what I should be working to do. IS find hands on dinosaur related things for them to do. I know they both love the Magic school bus. Science experiments.<br/>
  Ok I see a plan developing.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks  Tia   :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620256699">Thanks Heather. I especially like the game part. It looks like it could really be a cool way to ;earn about the different dinos and their habitats and so on. I will most definitely check out the links  :o)<br/>
