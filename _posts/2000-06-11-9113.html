<div id="ygrps-yiv-242562038">ok, my turn ...<br/>
<br/>
Why do you un/homeschool:<br/>
<br/>
we took our dss out of school @ Christmas break our oldest ds (3rd gr) was<br/>
invited to be part of a *gang* and he was ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED b/c he didn&#39;t<br/>
KNOW the boys but was THREATENED if he didn&#39;t join their *gang* he&#39;d be beat<br/>
up ... dh and I had a conference w/ his teacher and b/c a school official<br/>
wasn&#39;t present, they had no way of knowing if this was true/not and their<br/>
hands were tied!!!  B~U~T, the teacher said &quot;DS NEEDS TO BE ON RITALIN!!!&quot;<br/>
*HUH*???  dh, normally very quiet spoken mild mannered person went BALLISTIC<br/>
and asked the teacher &quot;HOW in the name of heavens does DOPING a child up<br/>
RESOLVE THE GANG PROB and WHEN DID THE STATE OF TEXAS LICENSE YOU TO<br/>
PRESCRIBE MEDICINE!!!???&quot; ... the teacher responded w/ &quot;uhhhhhhhh, Mr. F we<br/>
DO NOT HAVE THOSE TYPES OF PROBS (gang) IN *OUR* SCHOOL SYST!!!&quot;   my dh<br/>
turned to me and said &quot;go and collect dss&#39; belongings and I&#39;m going to the<br/>
office to WITHDRAW BOTH BOYS FROM SCHOOL&quot; ... he proceeded to tell dt (dear<br/>
teacher),  &quot;you and the ps system have done QUITE ENOUGH DAMAGE, my child is<br/>
THROWING UP, CRYING b/c he&#39;s TERRIFIED TO COME TO SCHOOL b/c of these<br/>
threats, UHHHHHH THANKS, we&#39;ll TEACH THEM @ HOME!!!&quot;   I almost had a heart<br/>
attack right on the spot b/c I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT H-S&#39;ING, I didn&#39;t even<br/>
know if it was LEGAL, etc, etc!!!  ... I always say, we&#39;re the first h-s&#39;rs<br/>
we ever knew!!!     butttttttttt, fast forward three yrs later and we&#39;re<br/>
having the time of our lives and both dss are doing beautifully and my ONLY<br/>
regret is we didn&#39;t h-s our older dch, too :)<br/>
<br/>
How many children do you have?<br/>
<br/>
we have two generations of dch @ our house ... Sarah (24 yo), is married to<br/>
Matt, a wonderful fella, and we&#39;re expecting our 1st grandbaby (Kinsey<br/>
McLane or Samuel Alexander) in mid-Sept ... Matthew (21 yo) is a senior in<br/>
college (YES, *ONLY* 2 more years of college tuition; he&#39;s going to work on<br/>
his masters); our older dch weren&#39;t h-s&#39;d ... THEN our 2nd generation of<br/>
dch, ds Taylor is 11 yo and ds Nash is 9 yo were adopted @ birth and both<br/>
are an absolute joy ...<br/>
<br/>
What are your children&#39;s most recent interests?  ds 11 is quite an artist,<br/>
he&#39;s drawn our Christmas cards since he was 4 yo, he&#39;ll read anything he can<br/>
get his hands on, is taking piano and violin lessons, too ...  our *baby*<br/>
(9) enjoys piano, will begin saxophone lessons in the fall and enjoys<br/>
Lego&#39;s, k-nix (sp?) and working in the garden w/ his mama ...  both boys are<br/>
basically fluent in sign language (I took ASL in college as my foreign<br/>
language) and they are involved in church activities ... just think, if we<br/>
were still STUCK in the system, they wouldn&#39;t have time after school for all<br/>
these NEAT things!!!   both boys live and and breathe baseball, soccer,<br/>
basketball, swim team, and biking ...  yes, sports season runs all year long<br/>
@ our house but I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way!!!<br/>
<br/>
What area does your family live in?<br/>
<br/>
in the suburbs of a very HOT south, TX ...<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any pets?<br/>
<br/>
... three dogs; two Dalmatians Charlie (4yo) and Dottie (11mths), Lady (13<br/>
yo), a very old Manchester Doberman who thinks like a BIG DOBIE ... two<br/>
cats; Simon (6yrs) and Ms. Wiggins (6 yrs), both felines just ADORE my dh<br/>
and *tolerate* the rest of us; give me a break!!!  lol!!!  ... we have<br/>
tropical fish galore ...<br/>
<br/>
Anything else you would like to add?<br/>
<br/>
we&#39;ve h-s&#39;d for 3 yrs (wow, time flies when you&#39;re having fun) ... we&#39;re<br/>
going to unschool for the first time this year b/c we&#39;re all REALLY SICK OF<br/>
WORKBOOKS and replicating *SCHOOL* ... it also really grates my last nerve<br/>
that MOST of the h-s curriculum available was written by h-s&#39;ing moms but<br/>
it&#39;s taken me 3 yrs to finally figure this out; yes, I&#39;m SLOW!!!   what I<br/>
mean is, these people don&#39;t have anymore credentials than I do (I have a BA<br/>
in anthropology) and they&#39;re supplementing their income by writing h-s<br/>
curriculum; SORRY, I hope I&#39;m not offending anyone!!!    a h-s friend of<br/>
mine unschools her ds and once I saw what they were doing, I was HOOKED and<br/>
KNEW this would be perfect for my boys ... this spring I&#39;ve been<br/>
reading/learning about Charlotte Mason and PUO (Parent&#39;s Union<br/>
Organization)... even though I don&#39;t agree w/ everything the CM and PUO<br/>
suggests, I&#39;m going to modify some of their suggestions and use living books<br/>
which will suit our fm&#39;s needs ... isn&#39;t h-s&#39;ing *grand*??? &lt;G&gt; ...<br/>
<br/>
uhhhhhhhh ... dh and I will be married for 28 yrs (ACK, NO I&#39;M NOT THAT OLD,<br/>
he robbed the cradle!!!) ... dh, Tim is an rr engineer and I&#39;m a sahm ... we<br/>
cared for foster children for yrs but it b/c too difficult to say our<br/>
*good-byes*, so we decided it was time to give up that part of our lives ...<br/>
our fm is Southern Baptist and dh and I take care of the newborn nursery so<br/>
we can get our baby fix every Sunday ... we LOVE camping, esp in the spring<br/>
and winter (mind you, our winters are 50-60*s, lol) ... dh and I were the<br/>
first couple to have dad in the delivery room of the hospital we used and<br/>
when my babies were little I was very involved in the LLL and I also b-fed<br/>
our adopted babies, too ...<br/>
<br/>
soooooo, that&#39;s about it, hope I didn&#39;t bore anyone w/ my novel &lt;G&gt; ...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-59172865">Why do you un/homeschool:<br/>
<br/>
We believe that children learn best if they are directing their own<br/>
learning.  I know that no one knows my children better than we do and that<br/>
all we need to do is encourage them in pursuing their interests.  I believe<br/>
we are al learning all the time and we don&#39;t need to separate learning from<br/>
life.  Plus I don&#39;t want them exposed to the idea that &quot;boys will be boys&quot;<br/>
and that you have to fit into certain roles to be accepted in life.<br/>
<br/>
How many children do you have?<br/>
2<br/>
Morgan who will be 6 on Wednesday<br/>
Colin who was 2 in March<br/>
<br/>
What are your children&#39;s most recent interests? <br/>
Morgan is into all things Oz.  He is reading the Oz series of books and<br/>
thinking of ways to convert them to plays, he is asking to learn to spell,<br/>
and wants to learn about the constitution so he can be president.  He says<br/>
his first law will be that the $$$  has to be split equally :)  He<br/>
especially loves Glinda and Ozma.  He loves math and logic puzzles too.<br/>
Colin loves to draw and paint.  He loves being read to and pretending to<br/>
cut the lawn.<br/>
<br/>
What area does your family live in?<br/>
New York (60 miles from NYC)  <br/>
<br/>
Do you have any pets?<br/>
<br/>
a frog<br/>
<br/>
Anything else you would like to add?<br/>
<br/>
I love this group, but I mostly lurk.  I hope I&#39;ll have more to add soon.<br/>
We had to begin reporting to the state this year and I am trying my best<br/>
not to have that influence my outlook and actions wrt unschooling<br/>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I loved reading your novel :). It&#39;s so sad that you had to get to a point like you did with your childrens&#39; schools to enter homeschooling, but I&#39;m so glad it worked out for you. I read that you are proficient in ASL. I&#39;m really interested in teaching dd ASL and baby signs so we&#39;re better able to communicate before she becomes verbal (she&#39;s fully hearing, BTW). I have board books that give diagrams of the signs (ex. First Book of Animal Signs), but I have such a hard time figuring a lot of them out since I know next to nothing of ASL. Apart from taking a class, are there any resources you could recommend that would help me out?<br>

Why do you un/homeschool:<br>
<br>
My daughter is only a year, but we&#39;ve already discovered that the best way for her to get the most out of learning and her own education will be to let her take the lead and explore her interests rather than putting her in the hands of someone who is handing out manufactured educations to 20-some other children.<br>
<br>
How many children do you have?<br>
One - Accalia will be one year on Wednesday (Happy birthday also to Morgan!)<br>
<br>
<br>
What are your children&#39;s most recent interests? <br>
Accalia is discovering the joy of standing up unassisted. She loves being outside in nature and examining every little rock and blade of grass. She&#39;s becoming more fascinated by books as something other than just a chew toy. And she loves opening and closing, taking things out (we&#39;re working on putting them back again :)).<br>
<br>
What area does your family live in?<br>
southeastern South Dakota &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Do you have any pets?<br>
<br>
Lucy, our two-year-old lab/chow mix<br>
<br>
Anything else you would like to add?<br>

Looking forward to hearing from all of you wise parents!</tt></blockquote>
