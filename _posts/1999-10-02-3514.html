<div id="ygrps-yiv-290343916">&lt;&lt;we didnt do santa (etc) at my home growing up and i really still dont get <br/>
as easily stirred up as some about the magical and mysterious!  i have had a <br/>
disadvantage there i think and am sooo glad that the religion that is my own <br/>
has plenty of it to ignite those other senses besides intellectual...  it is <br/>
easy to just &quot;be practical&quot; for me, but if that is our focus we sure miss out <br/>
on a lot...  honesty is important but it is not about that.  if we look <br/>
deeper than face value and literalism-- we can see that we can share the <br/>
&quot;embodiment of&quot; or &quot;spirit of&quot; without literally saying &quot;sorry kiddos, its <br/>
all a lie!&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Actually, and in my personal experience, the opposite is true.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
david,<br/>
you may have misunderstood, but i was saying this from MY personal <br/>
experience, too.   It did have an effect on me not to have had those sorts of <br/>
experiences.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;(I think you<br/>
are covering for them, thinking that since it has no such effect upon<br/>
you as an adult, it is unlikely to have such an effect on kids.)&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
i am not sure what you are referring to here.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;If we can find ways to use Santa Claus in a way<br/>
which nurtures a child&#39;s natural sense of good will -- the Santa Claus<br/>
within -- then it can become very powerful indeed.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
this part anyway, we seem to agree on!<br/>
my point is that the magical can be quite powerful in communicating the less <br/>
tangible messages and mysteries behind what the season means to us!  that st. <br/>
nick and the stories we pass down are all important parts of the vehicles in <br/>
which we share the meaning of the season.  <br/>
<br/>
i dont play up the untrue parts because that does lead to lying.  i have <br/>
simply been able to share in ways that impart the intangibility of santa and <br/>
other things.  so that as the child grows older it is a gradual &quot;catching on&quot; <br/>
to the spirit of the thing.  (similar to the &quot;yes, virginia&quot; response.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Santa comes with so much baggage attached &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
hmm, carry-on or....<br/>
