<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092038959">Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
I have a question for everybody.  First off, our household is way more <br/>
relaxed ever since I let go of controlling my kid&#39;s eating, TV watching, <br/>
bedtimes (my kids are ages 3 and 4).  I am happier, my husband is happier, <br/>
and my kids are happier.  However, there is still one event that takes place <br/>
every evening that seems to still send everybody into a tizzy.  The simple <br/>
act of brushing my children&#39;s teeth and getting them into something <br/>
comfortable to wear to bed.<br/>
<br/>
It usually goes something like this....I get tired and inform my children <br/>
that I am going to go lie down soon and that I want to brush their teeth and <br/>
get them ready for bed.  This is met with, &quot;I don&#39;t want to go to bed!&quot;  I <br/>
explain that they don&#39;t have to go to bed, but that they need their teeth <br/>
brushed and to get into pajamas, and then they can play the rest of the <br/>
night if they want to.  So then I usually tell them that we will brush their <br/>
teeth in the next five minutes.  Five minutes later I attempt again and it <br/>
is met with a lot of struggle.  Then I usually have to just be firm and make <br/>
them do it which is not fun.  I am tired at this time of day and do not have <br/>
tons of patience. After that they are fine but irritated with being <br/>
interrupted in their play.  As far as their pajamas go, they usually just <br/>
sleep in that day&#39;s T-shirt, which is fine.  After the teeth brushing, they <br/>
are fine staying up and playing and then just go to sleep when they are <br/>
tired.<br/>
<br/>
I have explained the importance of brushing teeth and why we do it.  We have <br/>
gone out and picked out fun brushes and special cups for rinsing.  I have <br/>
asked why they don&#39;t like it and I get mixed responses from &quot;it hurts&quot; to &quot;I <br/>
just don&#39;t want to.&quot;  I make sure I am very gentle and my son knows to raise <br/>
his hand in the air if he wants me to stop brushing.  I try to think of <br/>
something fun we can do afterwards like read a book in bed.  Nothing works.<br/>
<br/>
So I am assuming that I am just not getting something here.  Should I just <br/>
not even suggest that they change into clothes for sleeping in?  That I can <br/>
see would make sense.  Maybe I should get them pajamas that they can change <br/>
into by themselves so they have that choice.  But with the teeth thing I am <br/>
at a loss.  I feel like it is my parental duty to make sure they have clean <br/>
teeth before they go to sleep, and that they are too young to understand the <br/>
importance of this.  What if I just gave up and later in life they had bad <br/>
teeth - I don&#39;t think they would appreciate that.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody else deal with this before?  Any advice would be greatly <br/>
appreciated.  I think our whole family really dreads the teeth brushing <br/>
every night and I would love to get past it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Erika  :)<br/>

until bedtime. If it&#39;s part of the dinner routine, perhaps it won&#39;t feel like they&#39;re being <br/>
yanked away from what they are doing at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Second, they are very young so they may not know why they don&#39;t want to brush their <br/>
teeth. I had a daughter who could not ever get dressed in the morning without a wrestling <br/>
match but was perfectly happy if she picked out her clothes the night before. Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
I might be tempted to moving the teeth brushing time to a different of day and trust that <br/>
that one time per day was enough while they are resistant. Maybe ask them the &quot;When do <br/>
you want me to brush your teeth - after dinner every day or after lunch?&quot; Or set a timer <br/>
that goes off and when it buzzes, that&#39;s the time.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

  =========================================================<br/>
<br/>
I had the same response as Julie--move the brushing time. Even if they eat something afterwards, their teeth&#39;ll still be getting brushed twice a day, and that&#39;s a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m wondering why you have to brush them. My kids (6, 5, and 3) all brush their own teeth, always brushed them by themselves first before I had a go when they were *very* young, and they all love to brush their teeth. I think it&#39;s more important for the kids to take care of their own teeth and enjoy doing it than it is to make sure that a perfect job is done. Once in a while, I&#39;ll ask my little guy to let me have a turn--sometimes he says yes, sometimes no. They all have great teeth and no cavities--maybe good genetics.  But, I think the important thing is that it&#39;s always been something fun to do instead of a battleground, you know?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say relax about it, talk to them about how important it is to *you* that they brush their teeth every day and how it would best work for them to get that done.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343565600">About a year or so ago, during a regular night of the brushing <br/>
argument, I somehow lifted the top lip of my then 2 1/2 year old (the youngest of 3). <br/>
I was shocked to see that all along her gumline her top teeth were all <br/>
corroded. She was actually the one who always brushed her teeth without any <br/>
argument. I felt awful. I always allowed her to brush her own teeth. I guess she <br/>
didn&#39;t always do such a good job. I&#39;m not sure how long it took for that to happen <br/>
to her. I guess I just never lifted her top lip, even if I brushed for her. <br/>
       My 9 yo. who brushes his teeth the least has the fewest (only one or <br/>
two) cavities. My middle one, 6yo, brushes most of the time and has a few more <br/>
than him and now the little one has horrible teeth. The dentist insists that <br/>
it is bottle rot, even though she has been exclusively nursed since birth. They <br/>
said I should stop the night nursings (I didn&#39;t though). I just try harder to <br/>
clean her teeth before bed and sometimes during the night I sneak in there <br/>
and wipe them. Anyway, she&#39;s had extensive dental work done including at least 5 <br/>
root canals and 2 caps on her molars so she can chew.<br/>
       I nursed my first 2 children the same way that I did her. The only <br/>
difference is that maybe my diet has not been as good with her and I have to <br/>
admit I drink too much diet coke. I do wonder if that is what may have caused the <br/>
problems. It may sound awful that a mother could drink diet coke while nursing <br/>
her child. I do so many things for my children but that is one thing that is <br/>
an addiction. If anyone has any literature about the effects of diet coke on <br/>
the body or nursing I would like to see it. <br/>
       I guess my point is be careful about being too lax and even if you <br/>
don&#39;t force them to brush, keep an eye on their teeth.<br/>
       good luck, Teresa<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333649566">My seven year old often puts on a clean outfit for the next day the night<br/>
before and sleeps in that.  She hates to get dressed and that cuts down on<br/>
the amount of times she has to change her clothes. (And on days where we<br/>
don&#39;t go anywhere, both girls stay in their pajamas all day and sleep in<br/>
them again that night unless they are completely filthy.)  I have also found<br/>
that by phrasing some sentences as requests (would you be willing to brush<br/>
your teeth now so that I won&#39;t feel anxious and worried about you getting<br/>
cavities?)  works well for my kids. They don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve demanded<br/>
something of them.  They can choose not to and I&#39;ll drop it.  They know that<br/>
I am asking out of concern for them.  Most of the time they are<br/>
willing...but often they want to do it in their own time frame and feel more<br/>
in control if they choose the time.  (I&#39;ll do it during the next commercial,<br/>
Mom.)  Happy Mom, Happy kids.  Hope that helps.<br/>

<br/>
This tooth brushing issue has been discussed before to the point that it<br/>
really seems to be absolutely genetic � everyone has examples of folks who<br/>
almost never grab a toothbrush yet have wonderful teeth, and the polar<br/>
opposite too. <br/>
<br/>
With Jayn I have totally let go. She is 4 and at the moment is refusing to<br/>
brush with �no thanks� when I invite her to do so � usually while I am<br/>
brushing. We go through stages of lots of brushing, and I have to say that<br/>
she often asks for new little brushes and new toothpastes at the market when<br/>
she sees them, but then uses the paste for painting the sink pink! She hates<br/>
all flavors that we have tried, including the new �orange� one (urk!). When<br/>
she brushes she uses water. I think she has one cavity in one tooth, but I<br/>
would rather let her have that and go to the dentist when she is more<br/>
mature, than force her, drag her to the dentist, make her afraid and angry<br/>
and generally lose any chance of her being willing to engage in good oral<br/>
care as she ages. After all she will lose these teeth, and they are not very<br/>
old since she didn�t get any teeth at all until she was one. I want her to<br/>
grow up seeing her health as in her own hands with the medical professionals<br/>
being her helpers and advisors, rather than magisterial authorities. I have<br/>
shown her pictures from the internet of bad teeth as an encouragement � it<br/>
may have backfired as she certainly sees nothing like it in her mouth. She<br/>
also drinks lots of water, especially at night, so hopefully that helps to<br/>
rinse them a bit. <br/>
<br/>
As for pyjamas � Jayn sometimes changes into her princess pj�s because she<br/>
loves them, sometimes sleeps in her clothes if they are soft and comfy, and<br/>
sometimes just wears her panties. This changing into special sleepwear is a<br/>
carry over from the traditional parenting (which I call �ordinary<br/>
parenting�) idea that you MUST have a ROUTINE in order to get the children<br/>
to bed at BEDTIME � kind of Pavlov�s kids. The purpose of routine is to<br/>
remove questioning and free thought or alternative desires as much as<br/>
possible. Stop caring what they wear to sleep. Seriously. Let them see that<br/>
you are taking care of your own needs and going to bed when you need to, but<br/>
let them be. If they really want to wear pj�s themselves, let them be slip<br/>
over types and maybe the elders could help the younger if really needed. <br/>

<br/>
Note: It often takes at least sixty days without *any* aspartame or <br/>
nutrasweet to see a significant improvement. Improvement in health is <br/>
also often accompanied by weight loss. Check all labels very carefully <br/>
(including vitamins and pharmaceuticals). Look for the word &quot;aspartame&quot; <br/>
on the label and avoid it. (Also, it is a good idea to avoid <br/>
&quot;acesulfame-k&quot; or &quot;sunette.&quot;) Finally, avoid getting nutrition <br/>
information from junk food industry PR organizations such as IFIC or <br/>
organizations that accept large sums of money from the junk and chemical <br/>
food industry such as the American Dietetic Association.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447248772">They can brush their own teeth, Erika. If you&#39;re worried about them  <br/>
doing a good job, get them the little battery operated ones - they do a  <br/>
good job. AND - they don&#39;t need toothpaste - maybe that&#39;s part of what  <br/>
they don&#39;t like about it. They can sit and watch tv with the electric  <br/>
toothbrush in their mouth and that&#39;ll work fine. Show them how to use  <br/>
it - going over each surface of each tooth.<br/>

&gt; Hey all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a question for everybody.  First off, our household is way more<br/>
&gt; relaxed ever since I let go of controlling my kid&#39;s eating, TV  <br/>
&gt; watching,<br/>
&gt; bedtimes (my kids are ages 3 and 4).  I am happier, my husband is  <br/>
&gt; happier,<br/>
&gt; and my kids are happier.  However, there is still one event that takes  <br/>
&gt; place<br/>
&gt; every evening that seems to still send everybody into a tizzy.  The  <br/>
&gt; simple<br/>
&gt; act of brushing my children&#39;s teeth and getting them into something<br/>
&gt; comfortable to wear to bed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It usually goes something like this....I get tired and inform my  <br/>
&gt; children<br/>
&gt; that I am going to go lie down soon and that I want to brush their  <br/>
&gt; teeth and<br/>
&gt; get them ready for bed.  This is met with, &quot;I don&#39;t want to go to  <br/>
&gt; bed!&quot;  I<br/>
&gt; explain that they don&#39;t have to go to bed, but that they need their  <br/>
&gt; teeth<br/>
&gt; brushed and to get into pajamas, and then they can play the rest of the<br/>
&gt; night if they want to.  So then I usually tell them that we will brush  <br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; teeth in the next five minutes.  Five minutes later I attempt again  <br/>
&gt; and it<br/>
&gt; is met with a lot of struggle.  Then I usually have to just be firm  <br/>
&gt; and make<br/>
&gt; them do it which is not fun.  I am tired at this time of day and do  <br/>
&gt; not have<br/>
&gt; tons of patience. After that they are fine but irritated with being<br/>
&gt; interrupted in their play.  As far as their pajamas go, they usually  <br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; sleep in that day&#39;s T-shirt, which is fine.  After the teeth brushing,  <br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; are fine staying up and playing and then just go to sleep when they are<br/>
&gt; tired.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have explained the importance of brushing teeth and why we do it.   <br/>
&gt; We have<br/>
&gt; gone out and picked out fun brushes and special cups for rinsing.  I  <br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; asked why they don&#39;t like it and I get mixed responses from &quot;it hurts&quot;  <br/>
&gt; to &quot;I<br/>
&gt; just don&#39;t want to.&quot;  I make sure I am very gentle and my son knows to  <br/>
&gt; raise<br/>
&gt; his hand in the air if he wants me to stop brushing.  I try to think of<br/>
&gt; something fun we can do afterwards like read a book in bed.  Nothing  <br/>
&gt; works.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I am assuming that I am just not getting something here.  Should I  <br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; not even suggest that they change into clothes for sleeping in?  That  <br/>
&gt; I can<br/>
&gt; see would make sense.  Maybe I should get them pajamas that they can  <br/>
&gt; change<br/>
&gt; into by themselves so they have that choice.  But with the teeth thing  <br/>
&gt; I am<br/>
&gt; at a loss.  I feel like it is my parental duty to make sure they have  <br/>
&gt; clean<br/>
&gt; teeth before they go to sleep, and that they are too young to  <br/>
&gt; understand the<br/>
&gt; importance of this.  What if I just gave up and later in life they had  <br/>
&gt; bad<br/>
&gt; teeth - I don&#39;t think they would appreciate that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anybody else deal with this before?  Any advice would be greatly<br/>
&gt; appreciated.  I think our whole family really dreads the teeth brushing<br/>
&gt; every night and I would love to get past it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you,<br/>
&gt; Erika  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132978830">Oh yeah - our pediatric dentist told me that the important thing was <br/>
getting teeth brushed at least once every 24 hours and not to do it at <br/>
bedtime if it was a bad time (I&#39;m like you, really tired and NOT filled <br/>
with calm and patience at night). He said that it was nice to brush <br/>
teeth after every meal and at bedtime, but that realistically what <br/>
really mattered was just getting them done sometime each day.<br/>

Three kids - one little tiny cavity between them all - just a spot on <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m beginning to wonder about all these cavities, especially in the US. My <br/>
kids had a dental exam just before we moved to VA. All fine, no cavities etc <br/>
etc, one might need braces as his teeth were crowded.<br/>
We then saw a dentist 6 months later in VA. He said Heather was clear, Bryn <br/>
had a grey area that *might* become a cavity but lets wait and see and Rhodri <br/>
was fine apart from having 5 teeth knocked out with a golf club.<br/>
8 months later we saw a paediatric dentist as the first had stopped seeing <br/>
children. Very swish offices....<br/>
According to him, Heather had 9 cavities, Bryn none and Rhodri 5. They all <br/>
needed pre-brace braces. He strated talking payment plans etc etc. I told him <br/>
I&#39;d think about it as we were moving home shortly.<br/>
Back home we went to see a dentist and gosh, no cavities anywhere. I told him <br/>
about the VA dentist and he was shocked. He said the kids teeth were fine and <br/>
that it is extremely rare that a child under about 12 needs something as <br/>
drastic as root canal. Root canals trap bacteria inside the tooth and lead the <br/>
problems later. They are nasty things and to be avoided unless you have an abcess <br/>
under that tooth that can&#39;t be drained any other way.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I think when a dentist who is paid by how many procedures he does <br/>
like in the US, suggests something then get a second and third opinion before <br/>
submitting your child to a lifetime of fillings. I don&#39;t know any child here <br/>
who has root canals. Plently have normal fillings. But in VA they seemed more <br/>
common than braces (which are of course, compulsory in the US..;-)    )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074546717">Brushing teeth has become a bit of a game for us here.  For the past year my five year old is obsessed with counting so we count to ten together while both brushing our own teeth in one spot at a time.  She now asks me to brush the spots where she can&#39;t reach.  I&#39;ve never forced my kids to brush their teeth as i don&#39;t force them to brush their hair or take a bath or shower.  I was told by a dental hygienist that as long as the plaque is disturbed (brushed) once in a 24hour period that&#39;s enough.<br/>
<br/>
As for pjs.  Well clothes choices are just that - choices...my kids sleep in anything from pjs to the clothes they&#39;ve worn that day to nothing at all.<br/>

<br/>
We moved from a dentist we trusted to another state without any clue who to go to. We <br/>
took a recommendation from a friend.<br/>
<br/>
Acouple of the kids had had one or two cavities but nothing much. Suddenly three out of <br/>
five had cavities and one of them supposedly had five cavities!!!<br/>
<br/>
I found another dentist who says things like, &quot;Well, I see one developping there but it&#39;s a <br/>
baby tooth and if he&#39;s not complaining, let&#39;s just leave it until it falls out.&quot; The interesting <br/>
thing is that since we switched dentists, only one of my kids has had one cavity (in two <br/>
years).<br/>
<br/>
First dentist: very fancy office.<br/>
<br/>
Second dentist: ugly little out of the way thing.<br/>
<br/>
Had the very same thing happen with braces too and did research into the &quot;phase&quot; style <br/>
braces treatments. Paid over $7000 for the first child. Have come to the conclusion it&#39;s a <br/>
money making racket. We use the old fashioned style braces for half of the price now.<br/>
<br/>
A good friend who gave up his private dentistry practice to do dentistry with the elderly <br/>
(this is a good man) told us that waiting until your permanent teeth come in is perfectly <br/>
acceptable for braces treatment and that there will be less likelihood of teeth shifting after <br/>
treatment... which is why adults who wear braces wear them for less time and it costs far <br/>
less money (which we discovered when my dh wore tham at age 32).<br/>

in such horrible shape. THe dentist tried telling me it was because <br/>
of her diet. I felt horrible. Her diet is really pretty okay, I <br/>
thought.. Then I talked to her bio grandma.. It is genetic. The <br/>
family has horrible teeth. Grandma said her mother had all gold <br/>
teeth for her entire life.  Grandma  also said she does not have a <br/>
tooth that has not been rebuilt. I had a foster daughter that had <br/>
not been to a dentist in nine years. She did not have one cavity. <br/>
She rarely brushed. I think far more things of that nature are <br/>
genetic. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-503325313">We recently switched dentists, cause the first one was obnoxious (although highly recommended by everyone I asked).  Dentist 1 had said that Lydia had 2 cavities, we got one filled by him and then switched dentists because I was so unhappy with his behavior during the filling.  The Dentist 2 said that Dentist 1 had taken the xrays wrong and that Lydia did *not* have a second cavity.   Made me wonder about being paid by the procedure also. <br/>
<br/>
Lydia didn&#39;t brush with toothpaste until she was over 6, and now uses a toothpaste that is &quot;low foaming&quot; which she likes. The toothpaste cap also plays music for the lenght of time you are supposed to brush - which is corny but she really likes it. <br/>
<br/>
We never forced brushing (although we did a lot of playing, like counting teeth and singing songs, etc., when she was younger).  About 3 days a week, brushing just didn&#39;t happen.  She has had only the one cavity (which I am now suspicious of whether she had it or not).  I agree with the people who think cavities are largely controlled by genes. <br/>
<br/>
Oddly enough, Jonathan (16 months) LOVES to brush his teeth.  He brushes his teeth (pretty well, too, I might add - of course, he only has 10) every time we go into the bathroom.  I guess it is just somehting that he sees adults and his older sister doing.  <br/>
<br/>
Back to the rest of the original issue, also - the kids and I all wear loose cotton clothes all day and usually sleep in them.  Lydia does have some princess nightgowns which she sometimes chooses to wear -- but mostly she sleeps in clothes. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128096035">Since I have not posted on this list before, I feel a little <br/>
background is in order before I broach my question.  I will try to be <br/>
brief...<br/>
<br/>
I have 6 children ages 19 months, 4,8,11, 13(in Jan) and 14 years.  I <br/>
left their father in March 2004 and am now divorced.  (He has many <br/>
issues and has subsequently been labelled &quot;Narcissistic Personality <br/>
Disorder.&quot;  His visitation w/the kids has been suspended since May <br/>
2005 by CPS because of some bizarre behavior on his part--loonng <br/>
story.)  My oldest three spent some time in ps (2,3, qnd 4 years <br/>
respectively)  Jossilyn (now 8) had not gone to ps at all until last <br/>
fall.  She begged to go and I allowed others to convince me it would <br/>
be &quot;easier&quot; to send the kids back to ps--boy were they ever wrong!!  A <br/>
few weeks into the year they were all back at home.  We have always <br/>
been more unschoolers towards &quot;school stuff&quot; but their father is a <br/>
major control freak so had strict rules for just about everything.<br/>
<br/>
  In May Jossilyn was diagnosed with AML (acute myeloid leukemia.)  <br/>
She and I spent most of the summer in the hospital 90 miles from home <br/>
and in August we went to Boston (210 miles away) for a bone marrow <br/>
transplant.  We came home in Oct.  (Her father was allowed visits in <br/>
hospital w/Jossilyn--the others still haven&#39;t seen him since May.)<br/>
The kids stayed with my parents--not great but...--and with good <br/>
friends--better but limited time possible.<br/>
<br/>
Now that we are home, everyone wants to be with Mom.  Which brings me <br/>
to the bedtime question.  Pre-cancer, the little ones went to bed <br/>
earlier--between 8-9pm.  The baby was nursing and Kaylin would go to <br/>
bed with us and fall asleep.  The others would wander off to bed at <br/>
various times, usually leaving Jacob and I and sometimes Kelsey to <br/>
stay up later.  Jacob(almost 13) has ALWAYS been a nightowl and would <br/>
often read in bed until 2am even when he was 8.  Those late nights <br/>
kind of became &quot;our&quot; time to chat or whatever.  Kelsey (14)joining us <br/>
was never a problem because he has always been close to her.<br/>
<br/>
Over the summer things changed, of course.  Kaylin had no bedtime, and <br/>
would just fall asleep where-ever and when-ever.  My mother &quot;made&quot; the <br/>
older kids go to bed by 11, which they did not fuss about.  In the <br/>
hospital, Jossilyn developed a new schedule, often staying up until <br/>
2am watching TV.  She had always been a very active, healthy child and <br/>
the inactivity and confinement were tough.  Still, not a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Now that we are home NO ONE WANTS TO GO TO BED!  Even if they are so <br/>
tired they just can&#39;t stand themselves.  Still, I understand that they <br/>
missed me and the little ones have separation anxiety, etc.  I could <br/>
deal with it.  But the older ones really miss &quot;our&quot; time together <br/>
without the littles.  I&#39;ve tried putting them to bed, but the instant <br/>
I get back up, Kaylin wakes up screaming.  Or she bugs Josie so she <br/>
won&#39;t go to sleep.  To top it all off, when the others do go to bed <br/>
Jacob has taken to harassing the others until the entire house is in <br/>
an uproar and we are lucky to settle down by 3am.  Josie is usually up <br/>
by 7am, like clockwork so I get up with her.  Naps are scarce.  I&#39;m <br/>
exhausted.  What to do?  <br/>
<br/>
I wanted to keep this brief, and I don&#39;t even know if I was very <br/>
clear.  I forgot to mention that my mother was putting Josie to bed <br/>
with a bottle of milk, or attempts at breaking the habit is also <br/>
adding to bedtime difficulties.  I don&#39;t think bedtimes would really <br/>
be helpful, but I really need some sleep.  <br/>

with your kids.  They might have some great ideas about how to get _you_ <br/>
completely rested so that you can be the best mother that you can be. <br/>
Since you have older children, could they watch the younger ones while <br/>
you napped?  Can you sleep only when the youngest sleeps?  Can you hire <br/>
a mother&#39;s helper for a couple of hours in the early morning so that you <br/>
could sleep or spend time with a subset of your children?  Sleep <br/>
deprivation is a difficult situation!<br/>

it, Jossilyn&#39;s post-transplant restrictions are very conservative.  No <br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the hiring is out due to Jossilyn&#39;s post-transplant <br/>
restictions.  And I HAVE talked with them, and they are really <br/>
helpful.  Unfortunately, Kaylin(4) just wants me ALL the time--no <br/>
one can get anything for her, do anything for her, etc. except me.  <br/>
(She hasn&#39;t always been like this, it&#39;s just since the cancer <br/>
diagnosis and treatment when I was gone so much.  I do hope and <br/>
expect that to get better over time.) <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really Jacob&#39;s current decision to antagonize everyone in the <br/>
house.  There are all kinds of dynamics going on, with a variety of <br/>
contributing factors.  One aspect is that he really misses that time <br/>
we used to share after everyone went to bed.  I&#39;ve tried talking to <br/>
him about why this is going on and what would be helpful.<br/>
I&#39;ve tried arranging one on one time, which can be a challenge.  But <br/>
it seems like its not enough... Do I sound like I am blaming him?  I <br/>
hope not, but when it is 3AM and I am woken up by kids screaming at <br/>
each other over purposely annoying behavior, I am NOT a happy <br/>
person. <br/>
<br/>
Most days I just think of how much better our lives have been since <br/>
we don&#39;t live with their father anymore, even considering Jossilyn&#39;s <br/>
diagnosis.  I expect this will sort out and become one of those &quot;Do <br/>
you remember when...&quot; things.    <br/>

house so that she can recover and YOU can recover.   But why can&#39;t all people <br/>
be in the same room (those who want to?) And why can&#39;t that baby have a <br/>
bottle to go to sleep?   If you&#39;re worried about sugar, maybe water?   <br/>
<br/>
Anything you do that creates less comfort is flatly less comforting.<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s no excuse for kids screaming in the middle of the night in the <br/>
absence of blood.   If they&#39;re not old enough to be quiet if they&#39;re awake, then <br/>
they&#39;re too young to make the decision to stay up.<br/>
<br/>
There are reasons for quiet.   Quiet doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;get in bed with the <br/>
lights out and go to sleep or get a spanking.&quot;   There&#39;s a wide world of <br/>
option between that and screaming at 3:00 a.m.   They are absolutely and not even <br/>
NEAR the only two choices.   <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
He probably doesn&#39;t know what would be helpful.   You&#39;re grown and you&#39;re not <br/>
figuring it out, so don&#39;t expect him to know.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Do the kids feel the same way?<br/>
Does Jacob feel his life is better?   <br/>
(You don&#39;t need to answer that on the list, but you should consider it inside <br/>
yourself.)<br/>
<br/>
Be careful of using &quot;we&quot; and &quot;our&quot; if you can&#39;t really speak for everyone in <br/>
the group.   <br/>
Maybe you&#39;re right and &quot;our&quot; was the thing to use, but it sounds pretty close <br/>
to unmanageable, and maybe therapy for the dad and the marriage would have <br/>
been better than a divorce.   Maybe not, but you&#39;ve made choices that affect <br/>
other people, and you might need to make that up to them, and be sensitive to <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do I sound like I am blaming him?  I hope not-=-<br/>
-=-It&#39;s really Jacob&#39;s current decision to antagonize everyone in the <br/>
house.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When you post to this list, please be as kind toward your children as you can <br/>
be, and please be as carefully honest as you can be.   If you hoped it didn&#39;t <br/>
sound like you were blaming him, you could have edited the paragraph.   The <br/>
simple act of editing your paragraph to make it consistent would have been <br/>
therapeutic and revealing for you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-when it is 3AM and I am woken up by kids screaming at<br/>
each other over purposely annoying behavior, I am NOT a happy<br/>
person.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t sound like they&#39;re happy people either, but at 3:00 your house <br/>
should REALLY be quiet.   There are probably laws being violated if anyone is <br/>
your house is screaming at 3:00 a.m. unless you live way out in the country with <br/>
no neighbors.   You could quite honestly tell your children that police or <br/>
social services people could step in if they can&#39;t be quiet from 10:00 at night <br/>
to morning on &quot;school nights,&quot; because that&#39;s the plain and honest truth.   But <br/>
don&#39;t shame them about it, because you decided not to have a bedtime without <br/>
having corresponding deals in place to make it safe and peaceful at night.   <br/>
EVERYone in your family needs quiet and peace, but you&#39;re the oldest and wisest <br/>
and it&#39;s your responsibility.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387339760">Can everyone just bunker down in one big family bed? I&#39;ve had two big beds<br/>
in the living room during particularly tough times in our family. It does<br/>
sound like a time to bring everyone closer, if they&#39;re willing and if that&#39;s<br/>
OK for your daughter&#39;s recovery. It could be one big slumber party for a<br/>
while. Acknowledging the stress everyone is going through might make them<br/>
feel somewhat better. Missing both parents for a while had to have been very<br/>
difficult.<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to say that my just-shy-of-4-year-old also frequently insists<br/>

Aahh, but you should see what it is doing to her little baby <br/>
teeth... (One of my sisters is a dental hygienist.)  But Josie still <br/>
gets her bottle, usually with water unless she really wants milk.  <br/>
But last night all bottles disappeared in the shuffle and we had a <br/>
very angry little girl...  <br/>

Hmmm, did I insinuate otherwise?   As I said (I think) Jacob has <br/>
always stayed up late, quietly reading or on his computer or <br/>
whatever.  If the others are up, it is usually fine--TV, books, <br/>
maybe a low key game.  When the older ones are tired, they go to <br/>
bed.  The yelling at each other has occurred three times in the past <br/>
week, so I need to contemplate what is going on to create this new <br/>
behavior.  Perhaps is has been from recent discussions to reinstate <br/>
visits with dad? (Just rhetorical musing on my part...) <br/>

Oh, I can answer on list and the answer is a resounding YES!  Jacob <br/>
was his father&#39;s favorite scapegoat.  I know he still has <br/>
conflicting emotions about his father but he has come to an <br/>
acceptance (of sorts) of his father&#39;s limitations.  This does not <br/>

made.  It is not so unmanageable now as it sounds, believe it or <br/>
not.  I posted in a state of high frustration, which I should know <br/>
better than to do but there you have it.  Ross(their father) is in <br/>
therapy, has been in therapy and there is little improvment to be <br/>
expected given his &quot;diagnosis.&quot;  Given the fact that he still <br/>
COMPLETELY denies that there is any problem after more than two <br/>
years of therapy, and a few different psych evals, improvement will <br/>
be a loonnggg time coming.  The description of NPD does not even <br/>
begin to convey the difficulty of living with someone who is that <br/>
way.  (I am not a big fan of the label wagon, but this one has <br/>
helped return sanity to my life.) <br/>

&gt; -=-Do I sound like I am blaming him?  I hope not-=-<br/>
&gt; -=-It&#39;s really Jacob&#39;s current decision to antagonize everyone in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; house.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you post to this list, please be as kind toward your children <br/>
as you can <br/>
&gt; be, and please be as carefully honest as you can be.   If you <br/>
hoped it didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; sound like you were blaming him, you could have edited the <br/>
paragraph.   The <br/>
&gt; simple act of editing your paragraph to make it consistent would <br/>
have been <br/>
&gt; therapeutic and revealing for you.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I did edit the paragraph because as it was first written, <br/>
it was completely unacceptable and not true.   I mean, even worse <br/>
than what it ended up as, &#39;cause that is unacceptable and not true <br/>
also.  To be honest, I guess I knew it still sounded blaming but I <br/>
just didn&#39;t know how to say what I wanted to say.  Heck, I&#39;ll skip <br/>
the excuses.  I was operating on about 3 hours sleep when I wrote it <br/>
and was still pissed off.  Meanwhile, all the kids except Josie were <br/>
still sleeping.  After I wrote about it, I felt better and we have <br/>
had a good day.  We are all in the living room watching the <br/>
Discovery channel.  Kaylin is asleep on the floor and Josie is out <br/>
on the futon.  Life seems normal. <br/>
<br/>
   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-when it is 3AM and I am woken up by kids screaming at<br/>
&gt; each other over purposely annoying behavior, I am NOT a happy<br/>
&gt; person.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It doesn&#39;t sound like they&#39;re happy people either, but at 3:00 <br/>
your house <br/>
&gt; should REALLY be quiet.   There are probably laws being violated <br/>
if anyone is <br/>
&gt; your house is screaming at 3:00 a.m. unless you live way out in <br/>
the country with <br/>
&gt; no neighbors.   You could quite honestly tell your children that <br/>
police or <br/>
&gt; social services people could step in if they can&#39;t be quiet from <br/>
10:00 at night <br/>
&gt; to morning on &quot;school nights,&quot; because that&#39;s the plain and honest <br/>
truth.   But <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t shame them about it, because you decided not to have a <br/>
bedtime without <br/>
&gt; having corresponding deals in place to make it safe and peaceful <br/>
at night.   <br/>
<br/>
There has never been a need to spell out a &quot;corresponding deal&quot; <br/>
because it has never been a problem.  I never expected it to be a <br/>
problem.<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; EVERYone in your family needs quiet and peace, but you&#39;re the <br/>
oldest and wisest <br/>
&gt; and it&#39;s your responsibility.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-508087799">There are reasons for quiet.   Quiet doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;get in bed with the <br/>
lights out and go to sleep or get a spanking.&quot;   There&#39;s a wide world of <br/>
option between that and screaming at 3:00 a.m.   They are absolutely and not even <br/>
NEAR the only two choices.   <br/>
________________<br/>
   <br/>
  We had to try a few options because just eliminating bedtime didn&#39;t work for us either.  We have &#39;bedroom time&#39;.  This is is so that Dad can get the rest he needs to be at work by 8am.  Thus Sunday-Thursday everyone goes to their own rooms at that time, they may do anything they want in their room as long as no one else hears them.  If it ever even once disturbs some one else, then that activity is off the list of choices for that time.  My teen often listens to music with headphones on and falls asleep that way.  My 12 year old often reads or draws for about an hour but then goes to sleep.  My 11 yr old son is a &#39;lark&#39;, he usually puts himself to bed around 9. <br/>
   <br/>
   If I had a little one, I would let them have a bottle anytime they wanted.  Recovering from traumatic family circumstances means that whatever aids comfort and healing needs to be the priortiy.  Do your little ones co-sleep?  When mine were little, just being in bed with me, having their bottle or nursing with lights out and quiet setled them down very quickly.  Oh and it really helped to give them a nice warm bath before bed it was a soothing transition thing.  Even now, my kids like a hot shower before bed.  I hope something works for you and you get some sleep soon.  It sounds like you have really been through hell.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325826729">I&#39;d guess that the reality at your house is that everyone is tired and <br/>
everyone has been really stressed out by your daughter&#39;s illness and by <br/>
dad leaving.  On top of that there might naturally be a feeling of <br/>
sibling rivalry and jealousy in the hearts of the kids that weren&#39;t sick <br/>
and didn&#39;t get the extra time and worry that one child did get.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really hard that you can&#39;t have people over to babysit or help <br/>
because of the immune issues.  Maybe people can at least leave <br/>
casseroles on your porch or loan you some new DVDs and books on tape?  <br/>
(When I&#39;m exhausted, I think the easiest way to love a kid is <br/>
half-asleep cuddling on the couch while they watch something on TV.)  <br/>
Maybe they can take one or two of the kids on outings?  Or chat with <br/>
your kids on the phone or at least be penpals?  Secret Santas?<br/>
<br/>
Give as much love and attention as you can, possibly looking for the <br/>
easiest ways you can think of to make your kids feel great. (Hugs in <br/>
passing?  Tiny favors?  Serving special foods?  Reading very favorite <br/>
books?)  Your life will be easier and their behavior better once they <br/>
feel more secure.  You are undoubtedly frazzled, but summon up as much <br/>
gooey love and serenity as you possibly can in each moment.  Smell the <br/>
kids heads and remember everything you love most about them.  Get out <br/>
photo albums and talk to them affectionately about things they did when <br/>
they were little.<br/>
<br/>
Some of my favorite stress-management techniques are deep breathing, <br/>
laughing and singing.  While listening to music cheers me up, singing <br/>
along feels like an even better stress release.  So play some Christmas <br/>
carols, or other music that you like, and sing and frolic a little with <br/>
your kids.  It&#39;s the cheapest therapy I can think of.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Betsy<br/>

PS  I encourage my son to go to bed at around 10 because his dad gets up <br/>
at 5:30 and it&#39;s easier to get enough sleep.  Often he&#39;ll just read <br/>
until he falls asleep.  If he feels to energetic to do that, then he <br/>
stays up watching TV until 11 or so, but that isn&#39;t great for me, as our <br/>
house is fairly open and he laughs really loud at The Simpsons.  My <br/>
personal rule isn&#39;t &quot;no bedtimes&quot; it&#39;s &quot;no bullying the kid into going <br/>
to bed&quot;.</div>
