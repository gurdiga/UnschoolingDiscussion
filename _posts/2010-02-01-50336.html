<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804802348">If not for unschooling my daughter Ashlin would&#39;ve started school today. (In Australia the academic year runs from late Jan to mid Dec.) So this is it - we are officially unschooling! Several of Ashlin&#39;s friends started school today, so I&#39;ve been hearing lots over the last few months about uniforms, lunch boxes, drop-off and pick-up, blah blah blah. Several mums have been quite open about the fact that starting school marks the end of their time as the primary influence in their children&#39;s lives. I found it a bit sad that they could be so matter-of-fact about what seems to me to be a significant separation from their children. <br/>
<br/>
All I can think is that this is so much the right decision for us. We had a lovely day today playing with toy animals, going to the park, going to a kids&#39; music session, watching Harry Potter.  Unschooling is fantastic! <br/>

AH!  Maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been selling what seemed like an inordinate  <br/>
number of books to Australia.  It was schoolyear decision/inspiration  <br/>
time!  Thanks for that; I never knew that.   I&#39;ll go and google  <br/>
somewhere to see what holiday breaks there are in there.<br/>

But it is, literally, a matter of fact, when school is accepted as  <br/>
natural and inevitable.<br/>

Beautiful.  So many other kids had such other things happening that day.<br/>

scary first day of kindergarten and crying for their mums who tore <br/>
themselves away and went home to cry alone.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m glad to hear of someone who played with toy animals and went to <br/>
the park, instead!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-938011466">Good for you!!  I remember the feeling I had when I watched the bus pick <br/>
up the neighbor kids at the start of the school year which would have <br/>
been my daughter&#39;s first day.  I have not regretted my decision to keep <br/>
her home and we are enjoying &quot;unschooling&quot; more than I dreamed!  Enjoy, <br/>
Carrie<br/>

was really good -- as high as 93 US cents to $1 Aussie. (About 5 <br/>
years ago it was as low as 50 US cents to $1 Aus, so it makes a <br/>
really big difference.) I&#39;ve been on a spending spree buying books <br/>
from Amazon (and from The Book Depository in the UK -- free postage <br/>
to Australia!) I&#39;ll have to hurry and order your book, Sandra, it&#39;s <br/>
been on my list and the US dollar is starting to rise again, so it <br/>
will cost more if I wait too long.<br/>
