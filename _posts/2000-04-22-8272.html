&lt;&lt;The baby book my mom had when she was pregnant with me admonished women not<br/>
to talk to any doctors but their own or to talk to other women about what<br/>
their doctors were telling them about pregnancy/birth/breastfeeding. The<br/>
authors thought that would only confuse us poor dears. &gt;&gt;<br/>

I just heard the some old argument put to a new purpose this morning.  A food <br/>
industry spokesman doesn&#39;t feel that labelling genetically modified food will <br/>
help inform the public.  (Even though more than 90% of the people in this <br/>
country are in favor of labelling.)  Obviously, he&#39;s afraid that we might not <br/>
buy his labelled food, and he&#39;d rather not give us that choice.  Grrrrrrr.<br/>
