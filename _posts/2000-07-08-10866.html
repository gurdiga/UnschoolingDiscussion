&gt;  just slices of bread fried in the drippings from the bacon?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The latter.  If the bacon fat is a little scant, you can  spread the bread - <br/>
eg with margarine - before frying. You need to have the fat very hot, so that <br/>
it fries quickly and becomes fairly crisp. I actually prefer it soggy, but <br/>
it&#39;s not SUPPOSED to be that way! <br/>
<br/>
As Tracy pointed out, it&#39;s a cholesterol nightmare, but it is truly tasty.  <br/>
British food, is, of course, renowned for its awfulness. Our French students  <br/>
used to trun their noses up at meal times on a fairly regular basis, with <br/>
varying degrees of politeness. But the one thing they almost always liked was <br/>
a British fried breakfast. Oh, and custard.....<br/>

PS Not not WITH it! Come on, it&#39;s not THAT bad... :-)<br/>
PPS Thank you for the viola suggestion Tracy. It was definitely an instrument <br/>
that was supposed to be played upright, though. I think they make <br/>
reduced-sized cellos for tiny beginners.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482729451">Did it have an adjustable spike, with a butterfly nut or something <br/>
similar sticking out the bottom?  If so, then it was a cello, or <br/>
maybe a medieval &#39;viol?&#39; <br/>
