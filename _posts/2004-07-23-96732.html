<div id="ygrps-yiv-642921460">Part of the beauty is knowing that I have made a choice to have a <br/>
child in my life and with that comes changes. A small child will only <br/>
be small for a short time. A friend of mine says &quot;the days are long, <br/>
but the years are short&quot;. The mantra &quot;this too shall pass&quot; is <br/>
powerful. Also, another friend mentored me that &quot;as soon as you <br/>
figure it out, it changes&quot;. These are useful self-talk tools to put <br/>
my choices in perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, if I mentally reframe the situation, it is empowering. At <br/>
times, I choose to submit to all that parenting offers. Part of that <br/>
is learning to stretch my own ability to delay gratification. VERY <br/>
HARD when I am tired or hungary. I have learned what my priority core <br/>
needs are. I know that I must meet those in order to nurture the <br/>
needs and challenges of others. When these are not met, my creative <br/>
problem solving abilities suffer.<br/>
<br/>
The book, Living Joyfully With Children by Win and Bill Sweet is <br/>
inspirational about the value of self care. It offers suggestions on <br/>
incorporating conscious choices in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
Another valuable book is Happiness is A Choice, by Barry Kaufman. It <br/>
is amazing how empowering our choice of perspective can be to <br/>
enjoying life in all situations.<br/>
<br/>
Tactically, giving information is the post powerful way for the 3 y/o <br/>
to learn, not comply, but learn how and why &quot;bugging&quot; her sibling is <br/>
disturbing. We use no punishment or rewards, but our 3 y/o <br/>
understands that playing his drums while someone is sleeping means <br/>
that someone can&#39;t rest. <br/>
<br/>
Engaging her in special time together during this time is one choice, <br/>
instead of &quot;time for yourself&quot;. Basically, she is engaging you <br/>
anyway, so make it enjoyable for both of you. Time enjoyed together <br/>
IS time for yourself. Another suggestion is to explain how important <br/>
time alone is to you. Just as she probably prefers to do some things <br/>
alone, she can understand. IT JUST TAKES TIME. You may not see the <br/>
learning, but it is happening. <br/>
<br/>
I consider this an opportunity for me to see how small steps add up <br/>
to a long term goal. Modeling patience during this process is in <br/>
itself a very valuable skill for my son to see. <br/>
<br/>
I read that &quot;our children teach us what we most need to learn&quot;. <br/>
Parenting is a humbling and fascinating opportunity to learn, change <br/>
and grow with my son.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866983705">I always give information to my 3 and 4 yo about why this or why not that.<br/>
To use one of my mother&#39;s sayings (which I&#39;ve actually never said to either<br/>
of them, surprisingly):  It goes in one ear and out the other.  They say<br/>
they understand that I need quiet in order for their baby brother to settle<br/>
down to sleep, but are screaming or jumping on the bed or calling me (loudly<br/>
and repeatedly) within minutes--sometimes as soon as I lay down with the<br/>
baby and he has just begun to nurse.  Often, he will have just drifted off<br/>
when they start and it wakes him and he then wants to get up and get in on<br/>
the action, whatever it is.  This frustrates me no end!  If I try to remind<br/>
them that he is trying to sleep, I wake him up further.  If I just lay there<br/>
hoping they will stop soon, it escalates.  I usually have to say something<br/>
and accept that I will be lying there awhile longer trying to get him to<br/>
sleep--often doing this several times, and I often have to actually get up<br/>
and go into their room and settle some difference and remind them to be<br/>
quiet.  Many times, I wind up yelling at them, which I feel horrible about.<br/>
BUT THEY JUST WON&#39;T STOP.  I&#39;m not kidding! I&#39;m seriously at my wits end<br/>
about this.<br/>
<br/>
Alas, as I said in my other post, I&#39;ve been trying to have them go to<br/>
seperate rooms to sleep, and it has helped for the last couple of nights.<br/>
Hope it continues to go well.<br/>
<br/>
I kind of got off the topic, though.  I responded to this post, because no<br/>
matter how I explain things to my children, they just don&#39;t seem to care<br/>
really.  It doesn&#39;t do much to change the behavior at all.  Perhaps this is<br/>
because of their age.   I know that eventually they will be more<br/>
considerate, but right now, they really don&#39;t seem to give a rat&#39;s a** that<br/>
I need quiet time, or the baby needs to sleep.  And it&#39;s not for lack of<br/>
modeling.  I don&#39;t let the baby go in their rooms when they are sleeping in<br/>
the morning, and when one of the tells me she needs time to herself, I make<br/>
sure she gets it. I respect their needs and attend to them.   I know they<br/>
are young, but I keep hearing on this list about all these amazing young<br/>
children who get it when you explain something to them.  I admit, when I had<br/>
only one, she was like that, but now with 3...ugh...no way.  They wear me<br/>
down and ignore me, etc...  It&#39;s like I don&#39;t have a voice.  I&#39;m exhausted.<br/>
I can&#39;t even explain how hard it gets around here.  I feel like a lame,<br/>
ineffectual, unimportant nobody.<br/>

Maybe you&#39;ve said the same thing too much.  I&#39;ve been around some parents who <br/>
are being ignored by the kids, but it seems sometimes (maybe not in your <br/>
case, I&#39;m just throwing out a guess) that the parents are saying their same thing <br/>
in an automatic-sounding voice which the kids seem to have learned to ignore <br/>
years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Try to say something they&#39;ve never heard before every time you talk to them, <br/>
maybe.<br/>

Another for example from us -- my daughter used to want to wake me up to tell me things if I went to bed (with the baby) before she did.  Now she and my husband write me a note and leave it on the computer so that I will see it when I get up of all the things that she wanted to tell me.

<br/>
My 2-3 year old really liked headphones. I used to save books on tape or music for when I <br/>
had ot nurse. He&#39;d wear the headphones and have to be quiet to enjoy the stories or music <br/>
inside. We also had little rocking chairs so they could rock while I rocked.<br/>
<br/>
Videos worked well for us too. Low volume.<br/>
<br/>
And I remember the exhaustion of parenting and needing to sleep. Any chance to hire a <br/>
girl to come play with the kids once a week in a playroom while you get one solid nap with <br/>
baby? Worth all the money to be able to count on one good day a week...<br/>

Good idea.  Maybe once a day!  Maybe a neighbor kid could come every day <br/>
after school.  It would be a good break for her and for you too!<br/>

When you have an only child, or only one quite young child, that child is<br/>
living more in an adult-thinking oriented world.<br/>
<br/>
When you have 3 little kids living together, they are living more in a<br/>
child-thinking oriented world.<br/>
<br/>
When you have the only child, you can explain that you need quiet time and<br/>
the child understands and goes along with it.<br/>

When you have 3 little children, you can explain that you need quiet time<br/>
and the children understand and go along with it until somebody starts<br/>
giggling, or somebody speaks brusquely or somebody forgets to say please.<br/>
Then child B responds to child A in a slightly rowdy manner and Child A<br/>
responds to child B in a slightly more rowdy manner and then it is<br/>
katy-bar-the-door.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say (having 3 kids myself within 3 years of each other) that I<br/>
think your expectations of them aren&#39;t reasonable.  I know it wouldn&#39;t work<br/>
in our house for me to go off to lay down with the baby in another room and<br/>
expect the others to be quiet or even to get along for very long.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t catch the age of your baby....but what about a sling?  What about<br/>
sitting down with the kids, all cuddled up together eating popcorn and<br/>
watching a movie, to nurse the baby?<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

&gt; I always give information to my 3 and 4 yo about why this or why not that.<br/>
&gt; To use one of my mother&#39;s sayings (which I&#39;ve actually never said to<br/>
either<br/>
&gt; of them, surprisingly):  It goes in one ear and out the other.  They say<br/>
&gt; they understand that I need quiet in order for their baby brother to<br/>
settle<br/>
&gt; down to sleep, but are screaming or jumping on the bed or calling me<br/>
(loudly<br/>
&gt; and repeatedly) within minutes--sometimes as soon as I lay down with the<br/>
&gt; baby and he has just begun to nurse.  Often, he will have just drifted off<br/>
&gt; when they start and it wakes him and he then wants to get up and get in on<br/>
&gt; the action, whatever it is.  This frustrates me no end!  If I try to<br/>
remind<br/>
&gt; them that he is trying to sleep, I wake him up further.  If I just lay<br/>
there<br/>
&gt; hoping they will stop soon, it escalates.  I usually have to say something<br/>
&gt; and accept that I will be lying there awhile longer trying to get him to<br/>
&gt; sleep--often doing this several times, and I often have to actually get up<br/>
&gt; and go into their room and settle some difference and remind them to be<br/>
&gt; quiet.  Many times, I wind up yelling at them, which I feel horrible<br/>
about.<br/>
&gt; BUT THEY JUST WON&#39;T STOP.  I&#39;m not kidding! I&#39;m seriously at my wits end<br/>
&gt; about this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Alas, as I said in my other post, I&#39;ve been trying to have them go to<br/>
&gt; seperate rooms to sleep, and it has helped for the last couple of nights.<br/>
&gt; Hope it continues to go well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I kind of got off the topic, though.  I responded to this post, because no<br/>
&gt; matter how I explain things to my children, they just don&#39;t seem to care<br/>
&gt; really.  It doesn&#39;t do much to change the behavior at all.  Perhaps this<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; because of their age.   I know that eventually they will be more<br/>
&gt; considerate, but right now, they really don&#39;t seem to give a rat&#39;s a**<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; I need quiet time, or the baby needs to sleep.  And it&#39;s not for lack of<br/>
&gt; modeling.  I don&#39;t let the baby go in their rooms when they are sleeping<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the morning, and when one of the tells me she needs time to herself, I<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; sure she gets it. I respect their needs and attend to them.   I know they<br/>
&gt; are young, but I keep hearing on this list about all these amazing young<br/>
&gt; children who get it when you explain something to them.  I admit, when I<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; only one, she was like that, but now with 3...ugh...no way.  They wear me<br/>
&gt; down and ignore me, etc...  It&#39;s like I don&#39;t have a voice.  I&#39;m<br/>
exhausted.<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t even explain how hard it gets around here.  I feel like a lame,<br/>
&gt; ineffectual, unimportant nobody.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry you are struggling so.  Having 3 young children is hard.  A sound machine would really help with the noise issue, with that on in our room a band could play in the hall and it wouldn&#39;t wake us :)  I believe it is unrealistic to think two small children are going to be perfectly quite while you put a baby down to sleep.  I have found if I engage my kids in something fun then after that they are ready to play by themselves while I do something else.  It may seem to you like they don&#39;t care but my guess is they really just want more attention and are sensing the negative energy you have about it.  Kids can be little barometers of our stress and energy. So getting yourself to a better place should be a priority, IMO.   A mother&#39;s helper or engaging your spouse (if you have one) or other friends or family members might help also.  This time will pass quickly, although I know it doesn&#39;t feel that way when you are in the thick of it.  Good luck.<br/>

My first three were born three in three and a half years. The next four are pretty close together, too. I found that I couldn&#39;t expect the kids to play quietly together while I was off elsewhere or with the baby - the sheer numbers enouraged a different sort of play,. :-) <br/>
<br/>
The movie idea is a good one. We would often pop on a video or watch the children&#39;s afternoon TV shows, with pillows and snacks ,and I would sit down with my feet up and feed the baby - we would all get a little break for a short period of time. Lots of talking about the shows, too.<br/>

Sometimes, one of the younger kids would fall asleep in front of the TV, on their pillow, ...Leonie<br/>

They want your attention, too.  It might be easier if you offered to  read a <br/>
book to them while you nursed the baby, or perhaps some other quiet  activity. <br/>
 Could they play Go Fish with you quietly, while the baby helped  play your <br/>
hand and nursed?  Maybe there&#39;s a really interesting picture book  that <br/>
everyone could look at and talk quietly about while the baby settles  in?  Maybe you <br/>
could all watch a video together?  Let them choose  it.  Make sure you turn <br/>
all the lights down, get the house quiet, and keep  the outside distractions to <br/>
a minimum.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s obvious that you want their cooperation in getting the baby to  sleep.  <br/>
They probably feel left out because the baby gets your undivided  attention.  <br/>
They&#39;re too young to rationalize that they get their time with  you later.  If <br/>
you really want their cooperation, you&#39;re going to have to  involve them in <br/>
the process.  I could be a really lovely time for all 4 of  you.  So what if <br/>
the baby doesn&#39;t go to sleep as quickly?  It&#39;s not  like he is getting a <br/>
peaceful time of it now, either.  Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-136857169">The girls get a lot of my attention.  I read to them many times during the<br/>
day and evening, both before and after getting the baby down, too.  I also<br/>
sing songs and &quot;tickle&quot; their tummies and backs before sleep (this is really<br/>
just running my fingers lightly over their skin to relax them--my 4yo in<br/>
particular loves this.) and talk to them about each of their days.<br/>
Sometimes I have to nurse the baby while I sing and talk, and other times,<br/>
he&#39;s already asleep and I can just lay down next to them (they take turns<br/>
having me next to them each night, but I always stroke and cuddle each some<br/>
before bed.)  I&#39;ve tried to read while nursing Evan, but he just sits up and<br/>
grabs the pages and my face, because he&#39;s tired and wants my full attention,<br/>
too, so it works better to just turn off the lights, (or turn them down if<br/>
the girls want to play quietly) and then take him into our room to go to<br/>
sleep.   Once I get him down, if they aren&#39;t sleeping and especially if I<br/>
haven&#39;t had a chance to read and sing to them yet, I will go and read to<br/>
them and sing.  If I&#39;ve already done that I&#39;ll go and ask them if they need<br/>
water or to go to the bathroom, and then I will cuddle them again before<br/>
going off to read, knit, watch an adult-themed movie or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s frustrating is that they will often bicker and fuss as soon as I go<br/>
to put Evan down, or after I&#39;ve got him down and spent time with them.<br/>
Whether they are choosing to go to sleep or &quot;play quietly in their room&quot;<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to matter.  Inevitably, some ruckus starts up that requires my<br/>
attention at the very least or wakes up Evan for the umpteenth time.  I do<br/>
think sharing a bed has been a big problem, because when Annie was still in<br/>
her crib and Stella had her own bed, yet they shared a room, this wasn&#39;t so<br/>
much a problem.  Annie tends to find ways to aggravate Stella (and<br/>
occasionally it&#39;s the other way around.) And the last few nights of seperate<br/>
beds has really helped.<br/>
<br/>
The video trick, that others have suggested too, is worth trying, though<br/>
often what has happened is they have just finished watching a movie with me<br/>
and are tired and ready to get in bed.  Still, they somehow get going again,<br/>
and besides, part of my trouble is that *I* need quiet time, not  movies<br/>
with them.  I need time to think about the day and sort out the next.  I<br/>
like to knit and read uninterrupted.  I know they are little and it won&#39;t be<br/>
like this forever.  I have a 15 yo son and he eventually came to regulate<br/>
himself quite well and could be in another room for a few hours in the<br/>
evening without me. (for that matter, he was just a mellow guy most of the<br/>
time anyway, and I didn&#39;t much mind him being in the same room with me!)<br/>
Having three little ones at once is so different from that.  I really, truly<br/>
feel that I need some space in order to be a good mom the next day.<br/>

An hour is a really long time for a toddler.<br/>
Their attention spans are short, their understanding is NOT what they say it <br/>
is, or what you hope it would be.  <br/>

Maybe this post has shown up late, but I thought there were several <br/>
suggestions of making sure the noisy toys were up, and doing something quiet with him.<br/>

<br/>
I wanted to add to the other suggestions, that it takes a time and mucho<br/>
repetition. I still have to ask Jayn not to make too much noise almost every<br/>
time, and I avoid using any kind of &quot;how many times do I have to tell<br/>
you....&quot; or &quot;why can&#39;t you remember....&quot; phrases. When I say to Jayn<br/>
something like &quot;That&#39;s too loud and will disturb Daddy&quot; she will often<br/>
immediately come up with several alternatives like &quot;Can I pretend to hit<br/>
it?&quot; or &quot;Can I hit this chair?&quot;. The work it takes to do the same thing<br/>
quietly (think of just tapping drums instead of beating on them) means that<br/>
she usually quits and finds another game after a few minutes. <br/>
<br/>
In the case of Jumping - &quot;Can I tippy toe jump?&quot; It&#39;s really just too cute.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My husband used to get mad - right off the bat. And then he&#39;d lecture. <br/>
&quot;Your mom is tired and taking a nap and you need to be quiet and not <br/>
wake her up so stop singing so loud and don&#39;t jump up and down anymore. <br/>
No you can&#39;t watch tv right now. blah blah blah.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t have much understanding of little kids - what was reasonable <br/>
to expect, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t ever get him to read the whole book, but I taught him some <br/>
very specific things from the &quot;How to Talk...&quot; book. And, lucky for me, <br/>
my credibility went sky high because we had a little minor miracle &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
He has a thing about damp towels being left draped over the couch back <br/>
or chair backs. Hates it. So our oldest child was probably about 5 and <br/>
she stood right in front of us and started to lay her wet towel on the <br/>
couch. Normally that would have set my dh off on a tirade - but I&#39;d <br/>
told him about the idea (from the book) of just saying a word or two - <br/>
so instead he just said, calmly, &quot;towel.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She looked up, startled, bounced back to the towel and grabbed it and <br/>
trotted to the bathroom and hung it up happily.<br/>
<br/>
He was STUNNED.<br/>
<br/>
And willing to try other ideas from the book, too, after that.<br/>
Just giving brief information, not making demands or requests or long <br/>
explanations - &quot;Dad is sleeping,&quot; &quot;Wet towels make the furniture damp,&quot; <br/>
&quot;Dirty dishes attract ants,&quot; &quot;Somebody could trip on those legos,,&quot; is <br/>
another thing my dh learned to do well. These things REALLY helped him.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t come naturally to him and when he&#39;s tired or stressed he <br/>
still loses touch with a lot of what he now knows about how to talk to <br/>
kids. But I give him a break because we DO stress him beyond reason <br/>
around here - with our messes and nonstop activity, we exhaust him. It <br/>
isn&#39;t really the lifestyle he&#39;d choose, or would have chosen if he&#39;d <br/>
had a crystal ball 25 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - the original question - about a child who seems to understand <br/>
but doesn&#39;t carry through on that understanding -- my answer is that it <br/>
is rude and annoying for the parent to continue to explain something <br/>
the child has been told before and seems to understand. Instead, just <br/>
be helpful and give minimal reminders, distractions, help, etc. Use one <br/>
word reminders, if you tend to explain too repetitively.<br/>
<br/>
My girls are 19, 16, and 13. When their dad goes to bed early and we&#39;re <br/>
all out in the living room watching tv, playing games, doing arts and <br/>
crafts projects, etc., I am STILL more aware of his need for us to be <br/>
reasonably quiet, than they are. So even at their ages I am the one who <br/>
will, about 80 percent of the time, say, &quot;Your dad is sleeping.&quot; (Just <br/>
state the fact - they KNOW what it means and why I&#39;m saying it.) But - <br/>
they&#39;ve ALSO certainly said it to me and each other: &quot;Mom, that&#39;s <br/>
loud.&quot; &lt;G&gt; (They don&#39;t say to me, &quot;Mom, that is loud and you know dad <br/>
is trying to sleep and it is important that we be quiet so he can get a <br/>
good sleep because he has to go to work and if he doesn&#39;t sleep enough <br/>
he&#39;ll be cranky and why don&#39;t you put that down and come play this <br/>
quiet game with us and blah blah blah.....&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
The original question immediately made me think of &quot;How to Talk so Kids <br/>
will Listen and listen so Kids will Talk.&quot; Such a practical book! What <br/>
a life-changing book for so many people!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758820869">Apparently it is more important to him to have some auditory or <br/>
tactile (?) benefit from the experience of drumming or whatever than <br/>
the alternative activities available.<br/>
<br/>
We also have some electric drums which came with a headset. We have a <br/>
practice pad that gives him the same physical sensation. We have <br/>
pretend paper drums that he &quot;plays&quot; and makes the drumming sounds <br/>
vocally. We have drum videos that he watches with the volume turned <br/>
softer. We have many ways of meeting our son&#39;s sensory experiences of <br/>
drumming which are not all disturbing to the house. He also has <br/>
outdoor activities and a jump-o-lene to meet his jumping needs, etc...<br/>
<br/>
What is the need the child is trying to meet? What is the need you <br/>
are trying to meet?<br/>
<br/>
Many suggestions are available for the sleeping individual too. Ear <br/>
plugs, white-noise in the sleeping space, soft music in the sleeping <br/>
space, close doors, move the drums to another site (garage, porch), <br/>
etc. <br/>
<br/>
Basically, I believe our son is ready/able to not disturb others with <br/>
his drums but that doesn&#39;t mean your son is ready/able (endowed with <br/>
the tools/toys/restraint to do so yet) otherwise I believe he would. <br/>
Why choose to disturb people unless some need is perceived as being <br/>
met by doing so? <br/>
<br/>
Children and adults do things for a reason. Discover the need/reason <br/>
and work together to met each person&#39;s needs creatively. Share your <br/>
observations of patterns of his behaviors as information for him to <br/>
incorporate in his self-awareness. Your observations may or may not <br/>
be correct. As he matures he will become more able to state his needs <br/>
and reasons for his behavior/actions with requests and words and <br/>
strategy to meet them if he has had problem solving modeled. Rather <br/>
than having his needs suppressed, ignored, or punished for <br/>
demonstration (behavior) that is disharmoneous to you and others show <br/>
him how his behavior effects others (give information) and work <br/>
together make his needs as important of a priority as your own. I <br/>
believe this is how he will learn to see your needs as important as <br/>
his own. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748790969">This solution may not be agreeable to all parties. Again it might.<br/>
<br/>
If only one person&#39;s solution is considered, there really is no <br/>
consideration occuring. There are many possible solutions to meet <br/>
needs, sometimes removing the temptation is useful. I do this by <br/>
putting chocolate out of my site. But I choose this. No one decides <br/>
for me. <br/>
<br/>
For instance, a choice of no drums in the house or drums in the <br/>
sleeping room are limited solutions which may or may not meet the <br/>
needs of all parties involved. <br/>
<br/>
My prioriity is for my son to learn to solve problems through <br/>
consideration of other&#39;s needs. If I don&#39;t demonstrate this <br/>
consideration of his needs (above a quiet house even), how will he <br/>
learn? The need for a quiet house can be met many ways also. I work <br/>
to creatively find a way to meet both of our needs. (not implying <br/>
that you don&#39;t).<br/>

Sheesh-sometimes you really have to hit me over the head with something for that <br/>
little lightbulb to go on! As I was reading your post, I remembered something: <br/>
Wyl has a tendency to go off (downstairs, outside, etc.) and leave his bedroom <br/>
door open (he doesn&#39;t like the cats getting in his room) and the big, <br/>
overhead light on. After a while, I got tired of, &quot;Wyl, you left your light on and <br/>
the door open. You need to go up and shut off the light and close your door&quot;, I <br/>
wanted a REALLY short way to say all that, so we came up with acronyms: <br/>
SYD-pronounced like Sid-(Shut Your Door) TOYL-pronounced &quot;toil&quot; (Turn Off Your <br/>
LIght) and that would be his name when he forgot to do those things. Oddly enough, <br/>
it doesn&#39;t seem to have helped him remember to do those things much, but it <br/>
has taken the conflict out of that particular &quot;reminder&quot;. I don&#39;t get upset and <br/>
&quot;long-winded&quot; because he didn&#39;t remember for the &quot;umpteenth&quot; time, and he <br/>
doesn&#39;t get exasperated with me reminding him and lecturing. Just a simple name, <br/>
&quot;Sid Toyl&quot;, its done and we&#39;re continuing with where we were! Now, why couldn&#39;t <br/>
I put 2 and 2 together there and see I could do that in other areas?! For <br/>
someone who&#39;s pretty bright sometimes, I&#39;m often fairly dense! LOL Thanks for the <br/>
reminder, Pam. I&#39;ve GOT to get that book from the library one of these <br/>
days...!<br/>
