<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206548322">This was Ned&#39;s response on teh other list. I thought it was good enough to <br/>
post here too:<br/>
<br/>
You write, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would prefer not having regrets when it is all done&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What you probably want &quot;when it is all done&quot; is to have the love, trust, and<br/>
respect of your children. One sure way to put that in jeopardy is to become<br/>
some sort of schoolteacher to them. It changes your role from loving,<br/>
reassuring, nurturing to judge, jury and taskmaster. You have enough to do<br/>
just being a good parent. Answer their questions, but don&#39;t decide what they<br/>
need to think about or do. <br/>
<br/>
The big thing is trust. Tell them that you trust them. Mean it. Do it. They<br/>
will always love you for that. If you don&#39;t have trust, you will definitely<br/>
regret it. It starts now. You have to earn it every day.<br/>
