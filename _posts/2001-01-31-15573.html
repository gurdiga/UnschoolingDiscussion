I&#39;m checking into the &quot;materials&quot; donation question now.  The e-mail<br/>
from Gujarat was sent throughout India as well as to me, so I think they<br/>
were hoping to get materials locally.<br/>
<br/>
However, I have an inquiry into the American Friends Service Committee<br/>
in Philadelphia to see whether they are working on a materials shipment.<br/>
<br/>
Funds are obviously more flexible for them to use.  My friends live in<br/>
VERY rural areas, where transport under normal conditions is pretty<br/>
difficult.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>ok... I was going to concentrate on blackberries, but I am far too curious <br/>
and had to continue reading! LOL I had to answer this if I could with all due <br/>
respect to all in the conversation:) <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t that simple because human beings are not that simple. Let me explain <br/>
a bit and hope I wont get slammed. This is not necessarily my viewpoint <br/>
though I am pro life. <br/>
<br/>
To people who believe that really is a child inside that there womb, then to <br/>
take that life truly is murder. To people who believe that ... children are <br/>
going in the clinics alive and coming out dead. That is what they see. To <br/>
them ... standing by and watching that is no different then standing by and <br/>
watching a holocaust. <br/>
<br/>
That is why this issue won&#39;t go away. Pro choice people passionately believe <br/>
they are right and pro life people passionately believe they are right. you <br/>
have an impasse no matter how you look at it. <br/>
<br/>
Back to Blackberries:) <br/>
