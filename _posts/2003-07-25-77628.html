<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128059059">We have been happily homeschooling in Michigan for several years <br/>
now. The state&#39;s laws are some of the most liberal in the country, <br/>
making our unschooling style a breeze. Unfortunately we are faced <br/>
with job loss in these economically stressed times and may have to <br/>
take work in a less friendly state. We look at the map of &quot;free <br/>
states&quot; and see there are very few. We are wondering what will <br/>
happen if we move to a state like New York or Pennsylvania and simply <br/>
ignore the registration and reporting requirements? Since our kids <br/>
have never been enrolled there, are they likely to track us down and <br/>
hassle us? We don&#39;t have time for these foolish regulations and <br/>
testing requirements. We are too busy discovering and learning. <br/>
Please help. Is there anyone out there bucking the system in one or <br/>
more of the most rigid states? Thanks Caroline</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-327108646">Hi Caroline,<br/>
 <br/>
We moved to Virginia from easy to home-educate in England. After I read al the rules on a notice of Intent and testing I just ignored it. We managed 18 months before someone turned me in. That was at Xmas 2002. The state sent me all their stuff so I sent it back written in Welsh. No word from them for months then they write claiming they&#39;ve heard nothing. I called them up to clarify a few points of th law but so far have done nothing and not hearda peep out of them. I&#39;m hoping that this state of affairs will continue until we leave the country at Xmas. There&#39;s no way I&#39;m testing my kids.<br/>
If we were staying I would purchase the tests and do &#39;em myself This way I&#39;m happy cos my kids are not tested, the state is happy cos they have a piece of paper with some numbers on. I don&#39;t consider it cheating personally (although some people on another list accused me of being spawn from hell for suggesting the idea...) cos I&#39;m not claiming anything for my children. The point is that bits of paper move roound and everyone is happy. It&#39;s not like in 15 years time people wil give a stuff about supposed scores in Grade 2 or whatever.<br/>
Anyway, personally I&#39;d just stay underground and on the offchance someone snitches on you, then claim ignorance. But thats just me. I resent laws that tell me what the state thinks I should be doing with my own children. &lt;cue land of the free rant, what would the founding fathers think etc etc&gt;<br/>
 <br/>

PS. Don&#39;t move to Stepford, North Virginia unless you look likea soccer Mom ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-327035416">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We live in Maine. I know of a couple of people that do not report or register <br/>
with the state. To my knowledge they have never been harassed by the state.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-486030775">Regarding not registering - I saved the following post from a discussion some time ago on this list.  IMO it&#39;s a good idea :-)<br/>
<br/>
I hope it helps<br/>

This was posted by Sandra 3/15/03 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;BUT, I took Sandra&#39;s advice and got all my paperwork in order back in <br/>
November, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So Sandra, what was your advice?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First, both Ren and Dave & Nancy who are here had done the same thing so it&#39;s <br/>
kinda cool that it DID help.<br/>
<br/>
Left over from some New Mexico policy that&#39;s no longer in effect, it was this:<br/>
<br/>
Get the forms filled out, get them notarized so you have an official date on <br/>
them, make copies of the forms that you can give to relatives or neighbors or <br/>
anybody, and just don&#39;t send the original to the state (or district or <br/>
wherever your law says it goes, but here it was state).  Just put the <br/>
original somewhere safe.  County landfill,  under the couch...<br/>
<br/>
But IF someone wants proof of your registration, show them the copies with <br/>
the date.  Say, &quot;Look, I have copies.  Do you want one?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can send a copy to the state later if they say &quot;We don&#39;t have your <br/>
registration.&quot;<br/>
You say &quot;Oh.  Sorry.  Here&#39;s a copy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Since at their end they have some minimum wage file clerk in charge of <br/>
opening envelope and putting the papers in a filing cabinet, their failure to <br/>
produce a copy could easily mean mail problem, mis-file, loss under THEIR <br/>
couch or in the landfill, but if they have a copy to put in the file, then <br/>
they have their copy, legally dated before whatever deadline it was.<br/>
<br/>
The reason people were doing that here was they could show that they had <br/>
written their intent to homeschool in time, but it didn&#39;t actually get their <br/>
kid&#39;s name on the to-be-tested list.  <br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s something to distribute to suspicious relatives.<br/>
<br/>
I always recommended not lying.  Don&#39;t say &quot;We sent it.&quot;  Just say &quot;I have a <br/>
copy, do you want one?&quot;  Because that&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Just move to whichever part in New Jersey is closest to either state <br/>
and commute. Will save you a bunch of headaches.<br/>
