<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605953785">I apologize in advance if you see this on more than one list as it gets<br/>
passed around.<br/>
<br/>
US News & World Report is preparing to do an article on unschooling. This<br/>
article will focus on unschooling and not just homeschooling in general. If<br/>
you would like to contribute, there are actually two opportunities. Caroline<br/>
Kleiner is the reporter working on the article and she would love to hear<br/>
from you about your unschooling experiences and she may be interested in<br/>
interviewing you (by phone or e-mail, so your location is not critical).<br/>
Please see her contact information below.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, if you are in the DC area (including Northern Virginia or<br/>
Maryland, but no more than about 90 minutes from DC), she is interested in<br/>
observing your family for a day. If your family is available on August 29,<br/>
30, or 31 (a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday), and you are willing to share<br/>
your day with her, please contact her right away.<br/>
