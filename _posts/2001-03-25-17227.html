&gt; Babywise Publisher Plans Contract Cancellation<br/>
&gt; Multnomah editor now considers Ezzo book &quot;dangerous.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By Corrie Cutrer | posted 3/23/01<br/>
&gt; Multnomah Publishers, a small Christian publishing company in<br/>
&gt; Sisters, Oregon, has begun severing ties with one of its most<br/>
&gt; profitable and controversial authors, Gary Ezzo, according to a<br/>
&gt; reliable company source.<br/>
&gt; A household name among many Christian parents with newborns, Ezzo has<br/>
&gt; been unable to shed doubts about the child-rearing methods in his<br/>
&gt; popular book On Becoming Babywise. In addition, church leaders with<br/>
&gt; past ties to Ezzo describe him as &quot;disqualified&quot; for Christian<br/>
&gt; ministry and his parenting materials as &quot;fraught with danger&quot; (CT,<br/>
&gt; Nov. 13, 2000, p. 70).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A central element of the Ezzo plan is feeding newborns on a<br/>
&gt; structured schedule controlled by parents, rather than &quot;on-demand,&quot;<br/>
&gt; whenever an infant indicates hunger. Ezzo&#39;s program teaches that in<br/>
&gt; order to develop respectful, obedient, and godly children, parents<br/>
&gt; must exercise restrictive control. Ezzo and his Growing Families<br/>
&gt; International (GFI) organization report that more than 500,000<br/>
&gt; infants have been trained to sleep soundly through the night through<br/>
&gt; the method.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yet many breast-feeding mothers have reported a failure to produce an<br/>
&gt; adequate milk supply when following the program. Some pediatricians<br/>
&gt; see inadequate weight gain, dehydration, and failure to thrive among<br/>
&gt; newborns on the program. Ezzo has also instructed parents of the<br/>
&gt; importance of leaving infants alone in their cribs so the infants<br/>
&gt; will experience periods of solitude. Many parents have admitted,<br/>
&gt; however, that they left their children crying alone for too long<br/>
&gt; while trying to follow Ezzo&#39;s recommendations for scheduled feeding<br/>
&gt; and nap times. Critics also question other Ezzo emphases, such as<br/>
&gt; introducing a form of spanking in children younger than 2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Multnomah&#39;s decision to break ties with the author came after years<br/>
&gt; of persistent controversy regarding Ezzo&#39;s professional and personal<br/>
&gt; integrity. Several churches that Ezzo and his wife, Anne Marie, have<br/>
&gt; attended have publicly rebuked the author for his lack of<br/>
&gt; truthfulness and failure to distinguish between his preferences and<br/>
&gt; biblical teaching.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Despite having no medical training or health-care certification, Ezzo<br/>
&gt; first published his methods in Preparation for Parenting, a book that<br/>
&gt; contained many biblical references. Later, he removed the religious<br/>
&gt; references and renamed the book On Becoming Babywise. Robert Bucknam,<br/>
&gt; a Colorado physician, is listed as coauthor of Babywise, although no<br/>
&gt; substantial changes were made to the original text or to the methods<br/>
&gt; taught after Bucknam signed on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Multnomah began investigating the allegations by contacting<br/>
&gt; physicians and other professionals qualified to discuss early<br/>
&gt; childhood development. The inquiry itself was a reversal for the<br/>
&gt; publisher. About a year ago, Multnomah issued a lengthy statement<br/>
&gt; defending Ezzo and his parenting philosophies. But ongoing public<br/>
&gt; pressure from journalist Frank York, one of Ezzo&#39;s former employees,<br/>
&gt; as well as Matthew Aney, a pediatrician affiliated with the American<br/>
&gt; Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), prompted the company to take a deeper<br/>
&gt; look. Aney wrote a detailed article, published by the AAP two years<br/>
&gt; ago, listing the potential dangers of Ezzo&#39;s methods.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Multnomah&#39;s Jeff Gerke, who has edited several of Ezzo&#39;s books,<br/>
&gt; spearheaded his company&#39;s investigation. In early March, when Aney<br/>
&gt; became convinced that Multnomah was not prepared to fully disclose<br/>
&gt; its findings, he contacted Christianity Today. Aney provided CT with<br/>
&gt; several e-mails between Gerke and himself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Gerke told Aney that he initially investigated the allegations<br/>
&gt; believing that Ezzo had been unfairly attacked, but later changed his<br/>
&gt; mind. &quot;I&#39;m personally convinced Gary Ezzo and his infant care<br/>
&gt; materials are dangerous,&quot; Gerke wrote. &quot;He has no medical training<br/>
&gt; and therefore no business writing medical books-or disregarding the<br/>
&gt; advice of bona fide medical professionals.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Later, after a meeting when Multnomah executives decided to sever<br/>
&gt; ties, Gerke e-mailed to Aney: &quot;The bomb has been dropped.&quot; According<br/>
&gt; to Gerke, Multnomah vice president Kyle Cummings called Ezzo in mid-<br/>
&gt; March to inform the author of the company&#39;s decision. &quot;Gary was<br/>
&gt; instantly broken,&quot; Gerke wrote Aney. &quot;He was very hurt that we would<br/>
&gt; have to sever ties with him.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Christianity Today contacted Ezzo at his southern California office,<br/>
&gt; but Ezzo refused to discuss Multnomah&#39;s decision, claiming there was<br/>
&gt; more to the story. Ezzo told CT he was planning to meet in person<br/>
&gt; with Multnomah executives. But in an interview with CT, Multnomah<br/>
&gt; president Don Jacobson said an official statement would be released<br/>
&gt; within weeks. &quot;This [investigation] has been under way for quite some<br/>
&gt; time and has reached a new height and level,&quot; he said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The publishing company could face legal repercussions for its role in<br/>
&gt; promoting Ezzo&#39;s materials. Gerke admitted to Aney that Multnomah did<br/>
&gt; not have a medical editor who reviewed Ezzo&#39;s manuscripts. &quot;Besides<br/>
&gt; these [Babywise] books, we don&#39;t do any medical books,&quot; Gerke wrote.<br/>
&gt; Moreover, the AAP has issued a statement saying that Ezzo&#39;s infant<br/>
&gt; feeding schedule is inconsistent with the academy&#39;s own feeding<br/>
&gt; recommendations for newborns.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Aney believes Multnomah should issue a public apology for misleading<br/>
&gt; the public for so many years. &quot;They&#39;re publishing a medical book with<br/>
&gt; medical information in it, and they couldn&#39;t even spend the money and<br/>
&gt; time to get a medical consultant to review the book and get a<br/>
&gt; comment,&quot; he told CT. &quot;It&#39;s insane. Multnomah should recall [the<br/>
&gt; books]. They should acknowledge that they&#39;ve been deceived by Ezzo.<br/>
&gt; They are an accomplice and a victim. But they&#39;re not innocent.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the process of gathering research, Aney says, he discovered<br/>
&gt; multiple cases of children suffering because of Ezzo&#39;s methods: &quot;It<br/>
&gt; was literally an endless web of information regarding medical<br/>
&gt; problems associated with it.&quot; Aney has documented the ten most<br/>
&gt; serious cases.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In defending Babywise, Ezzo has dismissed reports of problems as poor<br/>
&gt; parenting, inability to follow Babywise methods, or infant problems<br/>
&gt; unconnected to Babywise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Frank York was GFI&#39;s editorial director for two years before the<br/>
&gt; organization fired him. York said he was instructed to examine the<br/>
&gt; complaints being made against Babywise. Yet when he presented his<br/>
&gt; findings to Ezzo, York says, the author appeared aloof and claimed<br/>
&gt; certain parents were exaggerating their problems.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Although GFI told York he was being fired because he did not meet the<br/>
&gt; company&#39;s editorial needs, York believes differently. &quot;They realized<br/>
&gt; I was not a Gary-worshiper,&quot; he said. &quot;I pointed out all sorts of<br/>
&gt; medical problems. I was very honest in the report. Gary does not like<br/>
&gt; to be told that he&#39;s wrong.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; York wrote an open letter to Multnomah last January strongly urging<br/>
&gt; an investigation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is unclear whether GFI or Ezzo himself will gain control of the<br/>
&gt; copyrights to the Babywise materials. &quot;There are babies who are still<br/>
&gt; going to be harmed,&quot; Aney said. &quot;Churches are still going to want to<br/>
&gt; teach it.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hundreds of church leaders have distributed Ezzo&#39;s materials in their<br/>
&gt; congregations to first-time parents. Others have parenting classes<br/>
&gt; using Babywise methods. &quot;The more people find out about Gary&#39;s<br/>
&gt; character, he&#39;s losing influence gradually,&quot; York said. &quot;Multnomah<br/>
&gt; has had a reputation for integrity in the past, but they have been<br/>
&gt; deceived by Gary for years. It seems that they have finally come to<br/>
&gt; the conclusion that Gary lacks personal integrity. This has been a<br/>
&gt; long time coming, but I am gratified that Multnomah is choosing<br/>
&gt; integrity over profits.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Babywise Publisher Plans Contract Cancellation<br/>
&gt; &gt; Multnomah editor now considers Ezzo book &quot;dangerous.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; going to be harmed,&quot; Aney said. &quot;Churches are still going to want to<br/>
&gt; &gt; teach it.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hundreds of church leaders have distributed Ezzo&#39;s materials in their<br/>
&gt; &gt; congregations to first-time parents. Others have parenting classes<br/>
&gt; &gt; using Babywise methods. &quot;The more people find out about Gary&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; character, he&#39;s losing influence gradually,&quot; York said. &quot;Multnomah<br/>
&gt; &gt; has had a reputation for integrity in the past, but they have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; deceived by Gary for years. It seems that they have finally come to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the conclusion that Gary lacks personal integrity. This has been a<br/>
&gt; &gt; long time coming, but I am gratified that Multnomah is choosing<br/>
&gt; &gt; integrity over profits.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Are Ezzos Culturally Insensitive? (Aug. 19, 1993)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Susan Wise Bauer reviewed Babywise and other parenting books for<br/>
&gt; &gt; Christianity Today sister publication Books & Culture.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; At press time, Multnomah&#39;s Web site still promoted Ezzo&#39;s books.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Steven and Kateri Rein&#39;s &quot;Concerns about the Ezzos&#39; Preparation for<br/>
&gt; &gt; Parenting Class&quot; site offers criticism of the Ezzos from theological,<br/>
&gt; &gt; biological, historical, and other perspectives. It also reprints and<br/>
&gt; &gt; links to several articles in the mainstream press. It has a copy of<br/>
&gt; &gt; York&#39;s open letter to Multnomah and Aney&#39;s AAP article.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ezzo responded to CT&#39;s earlier coverage on the Growing Families<br/>
&gt; &gt; International site.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; World magazine also profiled Ezzo&#39;s techniques, resulting in an<br/>
&gt; &gt; controversial response by Ezzo.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Two major evangelical publishers are focusing on physical health<br/>
&gt; &gt; from a Christian perspective,&quot; reports Publishers Weekly. &quot;Thomas<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nelson and Zondervan are leading the charge into the health category,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and they predict others will follow.&quot;<br/>
