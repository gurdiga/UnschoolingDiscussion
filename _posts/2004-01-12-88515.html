<div id="ygrps-yiv-502140541">A friend of mine wrote this to me:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I guess I just wonder that if you have no benchmarks or external ways to <br/>
measure progress than I&#39;d personally be concerned about whether he was <br/>
getting basic academics at an age-appropriate level.  Things like math <br/>
beyond the basics, fundamentals of English and grammar, vocabulary, <br/>
geography, history (US and world) etc etc etc.  I mean, what if it doesn&#39;t <br/>
pan out and at some point, say when he&#39;s 14 or 15, he wants (or needs to) <br/>
return to school?  If it were me, I&#39;d want to be sure that he could at least <br/>
go back at a grade somewhat in line with his age.  It would be pretty tough <br/>
to have to start at 6th grade at that point.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I define &quot;child led&quot; learning differently.  To me, it means that if <br/>
Chase demonstrates an interest in say, dinosaurs, I would check out some <br/>
books from the library on that, take him to the Museum of Science in Boston <br/>
and spend extra time those exhibits and maybe find some documentaries on the <br/>
topic and build some models of some or maybe incorporate dinosaurs in art <br/>
work at home (make some with play doh or draw different ones.)  I&#39;d probably <br/>
use that interest as a jumping off point to teach him about evolution and <br/>
other related areas as well.  I see it as encouraging and developing areas <br/>
where he shows aptitude and interest, but NOT to the detriment of other <br/>
areas of learning.  I just worry about a child being limited in academics at <br/>
an early age and what impact that has on long term educational prospects - <br/>
ie college.  It&#39;s pretty tough to write a solid entrance essay if you&#39;ve <br/>
never had critical writing work, KWIM?  I&#39;m all for encouraging interests, <br/>
but I think that there are some areas that may not be &quot;fun&quot; but are <br/>
intrinsic to a well-rounded academic education.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How do I answer her? Several people keep asking me about unschooling and <br/>
telling me I am neglecting my son! How can I nicely deal with these people?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Don&#39;t answer her. Hand her a list of websites, books and articles. If she&#39;s really as concerned as she seems she can do the reading herself. You&#39;ve done all the research that lead you to your decision and it has reassured you that this is the right thing for your child.   If others care enough about your son to claim neglect, they should certainly care enough to go to the library and take out some books you point them to. <br/>
     The other thing is, I really suck at explaining unschooling and maybe you do to. :) There are times when I try when it reallly does sound like I&#39;m describing neglect. Explain that to the questioners before you hand them your list of resources they can check. <br/>
      When people question like this I think of it as a little laziness. If they really want answers instead of just a confrontation, they would do the legwork themselves to find out what they needed to know.<br/>

They had already made up their minds before talking to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why do you have to deal nicely with them when they are<br/>
talking so condescendingly to you?<br/>
<br/>
A nice question about unschooling would be, &quot;Wendy, I<br/>
hear you are unschooling.  Wow! How does that work?<br/>
Don&#39;t you worry about your child not getting into<br/>
college?&quot; (or whatever...fill in the blank with the<br/>
concern of the week) and then pausing to listen to<br/>
Wendy&#39;s answer.<br/>
<br/>
Spouting off a tirade about how Wendy&#39;s child will<br/>
never amount to anything and will end up back in 6th<br/>
grade if he ever has to go back to school is not<br/>
asking in a friendly, nice way.  It is justifying<br/>
their own choices by belittling Wendy&#39;s.  They don&#39;t<br/>
want to know why unschooling works or how it works. <br/>
If they can get Wendy&#39;s kids to wear the same chains<br/>
their kids do, then they don&#39;t have to admit there are<br/>
chains at all.<br/>
<br/>
My answer to such people is simply, &quot;We have<br/>
researched it carefully and believe this to be the<br/>
best educational choice for our children.  I am glad<br/>
you are satisfied and happy with yours.&quot; and then say,<br/>
&quot;BUH-BYE!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the approach is the nice way, then I give a couple<br/>
recent examples of learning taking place, explain a<br/>
bit about child-led parent-facilitated learning, and<br/>
offer a few book titles and web sites.  If they keep<br/>
asking, in a nice way, I keep responding.  When they<br/>
start dismissing what I am saying, I know the<br/>
conversation is over and change the subject.<br/>

<br/>
When my sister in law was on us regularly I told her I&#39;d done my research<br/>
and put a lot of careful consideration into it and asked if she could<br/>
understand that - or hadn&#39;t she researched the public schools her kids<br/>
would be going to?  HA!  She hadn&#39;t.  She didn&#39;t.  She didn&#39;t want to.  <br/>
<br/>
Now I tell people instead of putting my faith and time and energy into<br/>
government statistics,  national standards, curriculum developers, school<br/>
politics, frustrated teachers and school bullies,  I looked at my son,<br/>
saw a perfect, learning person and I put my faith and time and energy<br/>
into him. <br/>
<br/>
My kid has never had one moment with a bully or one humiliation from a<br/>
teacher or one blow to his self esteem from a stupid grade.   Neglect<br/>
would be letting those things happen to your kid again and again and<br/>
calling it necessary and normal.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe Wendy could make some bookmarks with a list of unschooling books<br/>
and websites and pass them out with a promise to talk after the<br/>
questioner has educated him/herself.&lt;g&gt;   Tell them you *really* believe<br/>
in self directed learning. &lt;G&gt;  &lt;snort&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately most people are full of misconceptions about how learning<br/>
needs to happen. And they draw reasonable sounding but erroneous conclusions<br/>
from those misconceptions.<br/>
<br/>
I like Dawn&#39;s answer. Your friend is feeling uncomfortable with your<br/>
decisions. But it isn&#39;t your obligation to justify your decisions to her. It<br/>
isn&#39;t your obligation to educate her. Her hostile questioning -- eg, saying<br/>
in various ways that you can&#39;t possibly be right -- is saying you do owe her<br/>
an explanation because you&#39;re obviously not operating on all cylinders to<br/>
care so little about your child.<br/>
<br/>
Of course saying that sounds hostile ;-)<br/>
<br/>
You could say you&#39;d be happy to answer some of her questions if she can turn<br/>
off the assumptions that unschooling can&#39;t possibly work. By assuming<br/>
unschooling can&#39;t work she&#39;s saying you&#39;re an idiot for blindly believing in<br/>
something impossible. You could answer her questions more affectively if she<br/>
assumes there is an answer to her question but she just can&#39;t conceive of<br/>
the answer because she doesn&#39;t know enough about how unschooling works.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some answers to her specific questions:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I mean, what if it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; pan out and at some point, say when he&#39;s 14 or 15, he wants (or needs to)<br/>
&gt; return to school?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Natural learning works so kids won&#39;t be behind in understanding the broader<br/>
concepts as people assume they will be. There may be details they&#39;ll need to<br/>
fill in but teachers spend several weeks reviewing at the beginning of the<br/>
year. And if someone wants to attend school, they&#39;re going to be willing to<br/>
put in the effort to do what they need to to understand. The catch up work<br/>
-- as other unschooling kids who&#39;ve tried school have found -- is, if any is<br/>
even needed, on the order of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
That idea bothers many people because it says all the work they&#39;re doing to<br/>
keep up isn&#39;t necessary. But just because something is disturbing doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean it isn&#39;t true.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If it were me, I&#39;d want to be sure that he could at least<br/>
&gt; go back at a grade somewhat in line with his age.  It would be pretty tough<br/>
&gt; to have to start at 6th grade at that point.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Spending hours cramming in what schooled kids do to prepare for an event<br/>
that probably won&#39;t happen -- especially if the preparation only takes a<br/>
short amount of time -- is going to be time that&#39;s better spent on things he<br/>
wants to learn.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To me, it means that if<br/>
&gt; Chase demonstrates an interest in say, dinosaurs, I would check out some<br/>
&gt; books from the library on that ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling can look like that but the exploration happens at the child&#39;s<br/>
speed.<br/>
<br/>
The essential difference is that with other forms of learning the impulse<br/>
comes from outside, pushing what someone else wants inward.<br/>
<br/>
With unschooling, the impulse comes from the child, drawing *in* what they<br/>
want. The unschooling parent&#39;s job is to help kids know what&#39;s available<br/>
that they could be interested in. It&#39;s not hands off by any means! A child<br/>
can&#39;t know they&#39;re interested in dinosaurs or evolution unless they stumble<br/>
across them in an interesting context! So the unschooling parents job is to<br/>
expose kids to the richness of the world. But not to force them to explore<br/>
it in any particular way or any particular order.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I just worry about a child being limited in academics at<br/>
&gt; an early age and what impact that has on long term educational prospects -<br/>
&gt; ie college.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which implies that I&#39;m not. It&#39;s best to assume there&#39;s an answer that you<br/>
don&#39;t yet understand.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m all for encouraging interests,<br/>
&gt; but I think that there are some areas that may not be &quot;fun&quot; but are<br/>
&gt; intrinsic to a well-rounded academic education.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which, again, assumes that I don&#39;t care about that. Unschooling works in<br/>
ways that most people don&#39;t understand. But it does work.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s pretty tough to write a solid entrance essay if you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; never had critical writing work, KWIM?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is an assumption most people make. But it is an assumption and a false<br/>
one at that.<br/>
<br/>
There *is* an answer. It&#39;s impossible to grasp unschooling if someone<br/>
assumes that it&#39;s impossible.<br/>
<br/>
Writing for real personally meaningful reasons is orders of magnitude easier<br/>
than writing something someone doesn&#39;t want to write for an audience who<br/>
doesn&#39;t want the information. (The teacher &quot;wants&quot; the paper but is only<br/>
interested in the how well skills are employed, not in the information.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a more general answer about unschooling:<br/>
<br/>
Most of what we believe we know about how learning must happen comes from<br/>
the decisions schools make about education.<br/>
<br/>
But schools don&#39;t make the decisions they do based on what&#39;s best for<br/>
children. They make the decisions they do based on what&#39;s best for schools.<br/>
And that makes sense. What&#39;s best for the schools is what&#39;s (seemingly) best<br/>
for the children since if the schools can&#39;t operate, the children can&#39;t<br/>
(supposedly) learn.<br/>
<br/>
But schools are also assembly lines. Assembly lines are cheap and efficient.<br/>
Most teachers would agree that one-on-one learning or at least very small<br/>
groups is best for learning and yet children are taught 30 at a time because<br/>
it would cost too much to have one teacher for each child or even each half<br/>
dozen children.<br/>
<br/>
Having large class sizes is a huge compromise in what children need to learn<br/>
but it&#39;s done for practical reasons. What&#39;s gained by having schools that<br/>
can operate (by not costing too much) seems better than not having schools<br/>
at all.<br/>
<br/>
So kids are taught assembly line fashion because it&#39;s cost efficient. And<br/>
because assembly lines are necessary for schools, schools make the decisions<br/>
they do that keep the assembly line functioning smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
*Children* don&#39;t need to read independently by 9. *Schools* need children to<br/>
read independently by 9. (And what&#39;s best for schools is (supposedly) best<br/>
for children.) Schools as they are can&#39;t effectively help children who can&#39;t<br/>
read independently by 9 so all children *must* read by 9.<br/>
<br/>
That goes for everything that schools teach. Children don&#39;t need biology at<br/>
15. Kids will acquire and draw on biological knowledge when they need it.<br/>
But to run efficiently schools need to have all children learning biology at<br/>
15.<br/>
<br/>
So how can they learn biology and algebra and everything else unless it&#39;s<br/>
taught to them?<br/>
<br/>
The same way they learned English: as a tool to get what they want. By using<br/>
English to get what they want they get better at it as a side effect. And<br/>
the beauty is that it&#39;s self correcting because the goal is to get something<br/>
that works rather than to acquire something that&#39;s right.<br/>
<br/>
If we think of how they learned English versus how kids (supposedly) learn a<br/>
foreign language in school, which worked better? English is learned<br/>
practically effortlessly. But we don&#39;t take that learning seriously as real<br/>
learning. It seems some magical process that applies only to very young<br/>
children learning their native language.<br/>
<br/>
If we assume the only legitimate knowledge is what&#39;s in textbooks, and the<br/>
only legitimate form it can take is what&#39;s in textbooks, then it&#39;s going to<br/>
be hard to understand unschooling. Few people will be encountering and<br/>
solving 2x = 3y = 27 in their daily lives. Few people will absorb the<br/>
important factors of the Teapot Dome scandal by living life. (Those who do<br/>
need it because of their interests, though, *will* be getting that.)<br/>
<br/>
But textbooks are like the details. And real learning is about building up<br/>
an understanding of how the big picture works. Schools hope that kids will<br/>
understand the big picture by cramming in the details but if it happens it&#39;s<br/>
a side effect. But unfortunately schools are handicapped by having to prove<br/>
to administrators and parents and the state that learning is happening. So,<br/>
despite wanting something better for kids, schools need to concentrate on<br/>
the type of learning that can be demonstrated, that is the kind that is<br/>
testable. It&#39;s hard to test understanding so schools settle for testing what<br/>
can be memorized and hope that understanding happens as a side effect.<br/>
<br/>
So kids in school learn the details and might gain an understanding of the<br/>
big picture at the same time. But it&#39;s hard and often not successful. It&#39;s<br/>
hard to grasp the concept of what percentage means in a larger context, when<br/>
immersed in figuring out 37.2% of 128. But by absorbing the big picture,<br/>
building it up slowly of when and why percentages are used in real life<br/>
contexts, then the details fit easily into the big picture. And by absorbing<br/>
from real life, they aren&#39;t picking up negative associations with<br/>
percentages. Percentages are just a useful tool to them.<br/>
<br/>
The world is a naturally fascinating place! Kids want to explore it. There<br/>
isn&#39;t a reason for a child to avoid learning fascinating things. *Unless*<br/>
someone gives them the idea that learning is something to be avoided.<br/>
*Unless* someone packages up the world into dry textbooks and locks them up<br/>
in rooms and makes them memorize it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-299455026">***Can I use it? &lt;BEG&gt;***<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t mean anything to the person who wrote to Wendy though. : /<br/>
She wrote about academics and never once about self worth or self esteem<br/>
or wholeness or joy. <br/>
<br/>
She wrote:<br/>
*** benchmarks or external ways to measure progress ***<br/>
***whether he was getting basic academics at an age-appropriate level.<br/>
***<br/>
***use that interest as a jumping off point to teach him ***<br/>
***I just worry about a child being limited in academics at an early age<br/>
and what impact that has on long term educational prospects*** <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s leaving little room in her thinking for real life.   A person this<br/>
wrapped up in academics will have a hard time understanding a philosophy<br/>
of peaceful, joyful learning.  It will take more than a conversation or<br/>
two.   <br/>
<br/>
When people are consumed with measuring progress and age appropriate this<br/>
or that and long term educational blah, blah, blah, they&#39;re not thinking<br/>
about the wholeness of a person&#39;s self, only about the potential of a<br/>
good education.   Maybe there&#39;s a far off someday life out there but it&#39;s<br/>
now for their children.<br/>
<br/>
I have family members like the woman who wrote to Wendy and the thing<br/>
that shushed them some was Dylan.  When their dire predictions didn&#39;t<br/>
come true and they got a look at a kid who was smart and bright and kind<br/>
and whole they got a little quieter.&lt;g&gt;  And I care less now about what<br/>
they think than I used to.  <br/>
Their lives and their kids lives don&#39;t look like any kind of perfect<br/>
example I should be trying to live up to. <br/>
<br/>
So, neener. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *Children* don&#39;t need to read independently by 9. *Schools* need children <br/>

&gt; for children.) Schools as they are can&#39;t effectively help children who can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; read independently by 9 so all children *must* read by 9.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>WOW, so true, enlightening to see it framed this way!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;But it&#39;s hard and often not successful. It&#39;s<br/>
hard to grasp the concept of what percentage means in a larger context, when<br/>
immersed in figuring out 37.2% of 128. But by absorbing the big picture,<br/>
building it up slowly of when and why percentages are used in real life<br/>
contexts, then the details fit easily into the big picture. And by absorbing<br/>
from real life, they aren&#39;t picking up negative associations with<br/>
percentages. Percentages are just a useful tool to them.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is exactly how it happened with my 12yro. We had a conversation one day <br/>
in the car about fractions and percentages in relation to his life, I mean he <br/>
was asking questions about something he wanted to buy. We had touched on <br/>
fractions here and there but had never discussed percentages. As we talked I only <br/>
provided the information he requested, not the answers, then he would sit and <br/>
think. This is the kid who will tell me to let him think too if I get too <br/>
eager. It was so exciting to witness, it was just like boom, he figured it out and <br/>
had the answer. I think that was one of the most exciting days for me, to see <br/>
how much learning had happened w/o someone being &quot;taught&quot;. That day was a <br/>
turning point for me, well, I had already made the turn but after that I breathed <br/>
easier, LOL.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670328158">In my sweet, nonarrogant voice, I simply say,  &quot;I am so glad to have <br/>
this opportunity to enlighten you.  We incorporate a constructivist <br/>
approach with the experiential learning model.  This is sometimes <br/>
referred to as &quot;unschooling&quot; due to it&#39;s promotion of higher level <br/>
thinking skills (which, more often than not, just does not happen in <br/>
school). By the way, our nation&#39;s 4H program has been doing this <br/>
active, hands on approach for many years.  Feel free to do a google <br/>
search to find the abundant research which indicates how this still <br/>
is a preferred approach.  Presently, hundreds of colleges are <br/>
actively courting such homeschooled students for thier overall <br/>
educational excellence, intelligence and creativity.&quot;<br/>

young unschooled woman (age 16) wanted to start at the community college <br/>

critique them. Then she took the test and got 96%.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166051112">This judgment could be right on (though I don&#39;t see the point of <br/>
trying to determine that either way, from a couple of lines in one post). <br/>
<br/>
       For any particular questioners who are indeed hostile and toxic, a <br/>
list of ways to blow them off might come in handy. That&#39;s fine with me, let&#39;s <br/>
make a long one! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       But I figure the vast majority of adults I encounter in daily life <br/>
know little about homeschooling and probably have never even heard of <br/>
unschooling. People are largely ignorant about it and haven&#39;t given their own educational <br/>
assumptions much thought in any case. Not ALL of them will be hostile or <br/>
toxic.<br/>

a little -- with our own words?  JJ<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I mean, what if it doesn&#39;t <br/>
pan out and at some point, say when he&#39;s 14 or 15, he wants (or needs to) <br/>
return to school?  If it were me, I&#39;d want to be sure that he could at least <br/>
go back at a grade somewhat in line with his age.  It would be pretty tough <br/>
to have to start at 6th grade at that point. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would say to that that schools will not TAKE a 14 year old in 6th grade, <br/>
because school&#39;s grades are based on age.  And within any 6th or 10th grade <br/>
class, there are kids who will &quot;test out&quot; at any grade from 2nd to college.   <br/>
<br/>
Oh wait!  I just saw Dawn&#39;s response that you should just give her resources <br/>
so she can look it up herself.  That makes more sense.  It&#39;s not what I <br/>
personally usually do, though.  I wrestle them into that sputtery frustration where <br/>
they know they need to have some facts on THEIR side, not just be spouting <br/>
things their teachers have told them about how important school is to their <br/>
futures.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s where that stuff comes from, from things parents and teachers and <br/>
relatives said, just kind of in passing, to keep the herd in the chute.   &quot;School <br/>
is your job&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t drop out&quot; and those little slogans.<br/>
<br/>
Last night we had a ton of kids, and one who&#39;s young, like 11 maybe, had <br/>
parents come to get him.  He&#39;s a little yuck and I&#39;m never sorry to see him go <br/>
(GUESS!!!   NOT, by a far stretch, a homeschooler.  His mom gets rid of him as <br/>
often as she can, and I&#39;m never happy when my house is his home of the day, but <br/>
he comes with an older homeschooled teen and she&#39;s in charge of him so I just <br/>
occasionally have to negotiate with her).   He said &quot;I want to stay!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was 6:00 or so on a Sunday.   The mom&#39;s boyfriend (the only one of the <br/>
batch I might keep) said, &quot;You have to go to school tomorrow.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  They all have to be inconvenienced and he has to leave a really good <br/>
party because of him.   Because of what HE has to do.   But it&#39;s &quot;have to,&quot; so no <br/>
option.  The whole message, which I surely heard hundreds of times when I was <br/>
a kid (because you have to go to school tomorrow) did, for the first time, <br/>
gag me.   I wanted to just leave the room or maybe magically wire them all up <br/>
for visceral and brain-wave response to the statement.   <br/>
<br/>
Not worth it.  <br/>
<br/>
I would say &quot;I&#39;m rambling,&quot; but no, I&#39;m ranting now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;When people question like this I think of it as a little laziness. If they <br/>
really want answers instead of just a confrontation, they would do the legwork <br/>
themselves to find out what they needed to know.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You could coat it in flattery, sticky-sweet too.  You could say &quot;You&#39;re <br/>
*OBviously* really interested in this, and so I just *Know* you would *LOVE* to <br/>
read some of the things that convinced us that school was *so* harmful to people <br/>
who then grow up and can&#39;t even tell how brainwashed they are.&quot;   Then look <br/>
deep into her eyes and bat your eyelashes, sparkle your eyes, flounce, and march <br/>
away like a cartoon character.  Then definitely follow up with an e-mail or a <br/>
note on paper with a few web articles.<br/>
<br/>
And if you really want to finish her off, check back every couple of days to <br/>
see if she&#39;s read them yet.  If so, give her some more.  If not, remind her.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;        But I took her question to mean she wanted some help to present <br/>
unschooling effectively in such conversations, in her own words.  I hope to <br/>
hear <br/>
some discussion that takes that approach to her question, because it seems to <br/>
me <br/>
we lucky ones have an obligation to do that in the larger world, whenever we <br/>
have good opportunity to get through to someone. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People can only be themselves, though, and some are mousy conversationalists, <br/>
and NOT debaters.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done pretty well by just asking the person a couple of questions back.  <br/>
If I know them, it&#39;s easy.   <br/>
<br/>
Few of them really want to understand unschooling.  They&#39;re making <br/>
conversation, or they&#39;re being belligerent, or they&#39;re trying to prove their superiority <br/>
in some small social way.  It&#39;s friendlier, in some cases (like you&#39;re both <br/>
at someone else&#39;s party) to do an aikido thing and lift them up with the force <br/>
of their own question, set them back down and both laugh about it.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re intrigued enough to ask you again later, you have the advantage.  <br/>
If they figure out you really DO have some basis for your belief, they might <br/>
just leave it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard enough to explain it clearly to people who have kids who aren&#39;t in <br/>
school who are looking for something to do today.  It can sometimes be a waste <br/>
to even begin to explain it to people who have no children, or whose children <br/>
are on the scholarship track and can&#39;t decide between a Rhodes scholarship or <br/>
the air force academy.  That was my friend Kim and me last Friday at lunch at <br/>
Chow&#39;s Chinese Restaurant on Juan Tabo.  Kim knows my kids and thinks they <br/>
are lovely exceptions to the rule.  So we just have a nice lunch and I coo about <br/>
her kids&#39; school successes.   Doesn&#39;t bother me.<br/>
<br/>
But when someone DOES care, you get to the core of their own thinking by <br/>
talking about their own experiences.   Ask them what they would change about their <br/>
schooling, maybe, if they could go back.  Or what their worst experiences <br/>
were.   <br/>
<br/>
What I do when I think someone cares is I ask if they know about the open <br/>
classroom theories of the early 1970&#39;s.  If they say yes, I say &quot;it&#39;s like that, <br/>
but with the whole world as a classroom.&quot;   If they say no, I say &quot;School <br/>
reformers knew clearly THEN that kids will only learn what they discover and find <br/>
interesting.&quot;   Then I gauge their reaction.  If it&#39;s forward/positive, I go <br/>
on.  If it&#39;s &quot;Der? Huh?&quot; (not verbally, but in posture and eyes), I give <br/>
examples, or discuss what they do/know and how they might have learned the best <br/>
parts of it.<br/>
<br/>
If someone was &quot;a good student&quot; and I know it, I ask them how many times they <br/>
remember being told again what the subject and predicate of the sentence <br/>
were, and by then they&#39;re already laughing with recognition of the fact that <br/>
school is a whole lot of repetition.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I tell them that when I was teaching I realized that for just about <br/>
anything I was about to tell the kids, ten already knew and ten didn&#39;t care, <br/>
so I&#39;d aim my comments at those ten in the middle.   <br/>
<br/>
But these answers are about how I respond, and I don&#39;t think canned answers <br/>
will really cut it, because people need to have enough inside them to carry on <br/>
a short or long conversation without needing more script.   So for someone who <br/>
isn&#39;t confident enough to do that, I think passing on websites or names of <br/>
books is a good way to acknowledge the other person&#39;s curiosity (or over-honor <br/>
it elaborately, if they don&#39;t really care) and to get gracefully out of the <br/>
conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Another argument I&#39;ve used sometimes is to say that if my kids decide later <br/>
they want to go to school, schools will still be there, but if they decide <br/>
later they wish their kids had NOT gone to school it will be too late.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  They don&#39;t<br/>
want to know why unschooling works or how it works. <br/>
If they can get Wendy&#39;s kids to wear the same chains<br/>
their kids do, then they don&#39;t have to admit there are<br/>
chains at all. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s why so many women were FURIOUS with other women in &quot;women&#39;s liberation&quot; <br/>
days.  They were where they were because they had no choice and were going to <br/>
make the best of it.   They really, truly did NOT want anyone shining a light <br/>
on it and saying &quot;You have a choice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I still remember the intensity of some of the &quot;anti-women&#39;s-lib&quot; rhetoric.   <br/>
Much more intense than anything abut homeschooling, but a good parallel, I <br/>
think.<br/>
<br/>
And that movement made a HUGE difference in people&#39;s lives.   It made a <br/>
difference even in the life of any woman who did what could have been considered a <br/>
50&#39;s-esque thing and got pregnant, got married, had kids and stayed home with <br/>
them.    Or went to college to find a guy, got married, had kids and stayed <br/>
home.   Because if you&#39;ve done it in the past twenty years, you did it because <br/>
you chose to.   You could choose to because you had choices.<br/>

I know a lot of highschoolers who have a very limited vocabulary, know little <br/>

A friend of my daughters who is an honors student at her school can&#39;t write a <br/>

<br/>
Perhaps more to the point though is that you can learn a lot of the stuff <br/>
your friend pointed out very fairly quickly if you want to.  I don&#39;t want my <br/>
children spending their time being forced to do things now because of what might <br/>
happen at some future time.  We&#39;ll deal with the future when it gets here, and <br/>
if there are things my children need to learn for a future school situation <br/>
that they choose, I&#39;ll be happy to help them however they want me to.<br/>

mean here.  This has not been my experience nor the experience of the<br/>
unschooled teens and young adults that I have read about and met.  If fact,<br/>
my life experiences have shown the exact opposite of what you say to be<br/>
true.<br/>
