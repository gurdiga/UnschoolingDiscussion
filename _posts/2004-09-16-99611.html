<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932045885">I�m very happy to hear that Ren is safe. I hope her house turns out to be<br/>
undamaged also. The satellite photos look somewhat promising in that area.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I guess the hotel won�t let them take their rat inside? It could be funny<br/>
(in a sick kind of way) if it got out and roamed the hotel I guess. �Fawlty<br/>
Towers� anyone?<br/>
