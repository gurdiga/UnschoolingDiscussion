<div id="ygrps-yiv-797571544">&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve been meaning to ask: Did anyone receive the message from Lisa this<br/>
morning about the &quot;News from AHA-Networking&quot; and the Statement about the<br/>
recent Gentle Spirit Magazine lawsuit? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft updated my email program the last time I was online and reset my<br/>
defaults for me.  Yesterday it seems  I sent things out in HTML format.<br/>
Sigh, sometimes helpful things aren&#39;t so helpful.  Sorry for the confusion.<br/>
