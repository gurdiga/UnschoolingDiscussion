<div id="ygrps-yiv-186588014">My son Logan just turned 2 years old.<br/>
<br/>
One of his favorite activities is to sit in my lap, or my DH&#39;s lap and watch videos on the <br/>
computer.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s learned many things, watching Sesame Street clips, or They Might Be Giants videos <br/>
from &quot;Here Come the ABC&#39;s&quot;. Along with us reading to him,  these videos got his interest <br/>
sparked about the alphabet, numbers, and shapes. I know they have also helped increase <br/>
his vocabulary.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, there are some days that he would like to sit and veg in front of the <br/>
computer for hours. I can intice him away on occasion with coloring or painting, which he <br/>
also loves, or banging wooden spoons on our metal garbage can. I also tell him we can go <br/>
to a museum or the park, but it&#39;s been a cold winter here in NYC, and he doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
go outside as much as I&#39;d like to, hesays, &quot;Stay home&quot;. I&#39;m hoping in the Spring we&#39;ll be <br/>
outside more, and this will run it&#39;s natural course.<br/>
<br/>
He will watch TV on occasion, but I think he prefers the computer for a few reasons.<br/>
One is the intimacy of sitting on my husband&#39;s lap, or my lap, where he will nurse while <br/>
viewing the computer. He also can point to videos he likes to watch on different web sites, <br/>
it gives him some control. I can open another window or work on the computer, or I <br/>
sing along with him. We both get something out of it.<br/>
<br/>
So, here is my problem. I feel like a lazy parent when I let him watch for long periods of <br/>
time. Yesterday he got bored with it on his own, but that rarely happens.<br/>
Anybody go through anything similar? What would be an &quot;Unschooling&quot; approach to this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Meryl</div>

I liked your account of how much he&#39;s learning and how comfortable he  <br/>
is.  So in the context of your whole post, one phrase jumps out as  <br/>
not matching the rest:<br/>
<br/>
-=-there are some days that he would like to sit and veg in front of the<br/>

<br/>
I think a better way for you to see this and think of it would to  <br/>
consider words and prejudices.  He&#39;s a nursing baby, for one thing.   <br/>
How can he &quot;veg&quot;?<br/>

When you use negative words, even just in your own thoughts, it&#39;s not  <br/>
best for your relationship with him.  Our culture is full of put- <br/>
downs of kids.  While your son is still young, you can start weeding  <br/>
those out of  your vocabulary.   That will help.<br/>
<br/>
Some of these might help:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-129783115">Karl is very technically inclined at this point in his life.  One of the<br/>
things that can be done for ourselves as parents is like Sandra says ....<br/>
change our perception and way of talking about these things.  Karl may not<br/>
continue to be interested in the stuff on the computer.  It&#39;s a strong<br/>
current interest though.<br/>
<br/>
Lately I&#39;ve seen signs of him wanting more and different things to do too.<br/>
Along with his regular computer, gameboying activities, I place extra things<br/>
I think he might like.  Karl enjoys sound effects.  I just accidentally<br/>
found out a couple of days ago that he likes the voice on Storynory<br/>
(Natasha) and played it to wake up by in the morning as well as for his<br/>
bedtime story in the dark, which he has not been as interested in lately (we<br/>
usually tell our own stories).  Just to change things up a bit.  Little by<br/>
little.  Introducing possible new interests ... for however long they last.<br/>
<br/>
That way, continuing to find things new to him is a way to keep our<br/>
experiences lively in the home.<br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness for childhood.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with vegging out.<br/>
That&#39;s strong work ethic talking, which is fine but not the *only* thing to<br/>
aspire to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>for long periods of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My thinking is that any parent willing to let a nursing toddler sit on<br/>
their lap for hours at a time watching videos and such on the internet,<br/>
isn&#39;t a lazy parent.  Now if the parent were watching videos on the<br/>
internet and ignoring the toddler while the toddler were watching videos<br/>
on tv, and there was virtually no interaction between parent and child,<br/>
THAT would be lazy parenting.<br/>
<br/>
The distinction I&#39;ve always made for myself, has been active regular<br/>
engagement.  If I go for an hour without any kind of active engagement<br/>
with one of my kids, then I&#39;m not really mindfully present.  With much<br/>
older kids you can go for longer stretches, but even with my 14 yro, I<br/>
have conversations, and look at things with her, and bring her food and<br/>
drinks, and check out her make-up and fashion of the day, or show her<br/>
new and interesting things.<br/>
<br/>
Really honestly, any parent that can sit for hours with a toddler is not<br/>
lazy!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004624200">Thank you so much for your responses.<br/>
Although I have not used the word &quot;Veg&quot; in front of Logan, of course  <br/>
he can feel my negative energy.<br/>
It&#39;s time for me to go with the flow, and enjoy the intimacy of our  <br/>
time in front of the computer.<br/>
<br/>
The link to the &quot;Phrases to Hear and Avoid&quot; brought me right back to  <br/>
my childhood.<br/>
My mom used to say, &quot;Because I&#39;m the mother&quot;.<br/>
It still gives me anxiety  to this day when I think of it.<br/>
So much damage can be done with words.<br/>
<br/>
There is some cool stuff on the Art Ideas and links page.<br/>
I will continue explore it further.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-599180224">One distinction is that if my child is deeply involved and not wanting<br/>
interruptions, I don&#39;t interact in a way that looks very obvious to others.<br/>
I am paying attention, and if Karl needs something like food, drink, some<br/>
quick reminder he wants then I&#39;m there and yes he knows.  I may seem to be<br/>
lazy at times, yet I&#39;m not.  As an infant, Karl wanted to be held at *all*<br/>
times (it was rare he didn&#39;t want me to hold him), and I love those<br/>
memories.  People thought I wasn&#39;t being a &quot;good&quot; parent to let that go on<br/>
for months and years at a time.  Well.  Good thing we had so much holding<br/>
because at 5, Karl is not near as interested in it as he once was.  :)  He<br/>
loves hugs and we enjoy them but hugs, let alone holding, are much less<br/>
frequent at this time in his life.<br/>
