<div id="ygrps-yiv-170852417"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt;I&#39;d rather have a fat happy dog than to throw meat scraps (or cheese or<br/>
&gt; anything a dog would like to eat) away right in front of a dog.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well a fat dog may be happy but he&#39;s not necessarily healthy and has better<br/>
&gt; chances of not living as long and healthy either.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very true, Mary.  On the other hand, I&#39;m not exactly the ideal weight,<br/>
either.  I&#39;ve been trying to watch what I eat and get more exercise, which<br/>
has paid off in stabalizing my weight and *extraordinarily* slowly reducing<br/>
it.  I realize that not making a truly concerted, ongoing, serious attempt<br/>
at losing that extra weight may give me health problems as well.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have spent time discussing this, and in the end, we&#39;ve<br/>
concluded that working in the right direction while accepting my weight at<br/>
the moment makes me happy.  Maybe it&#39;s crass to compare a person with a dog.<br/>
But I&#39;d be really peeved if my husband insisted I eat occasional treats<br/>
while sticking to nothing but dry diet foods while everyone around me ate<br/>
well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A little OT, but I feed my dogs dry food with about a tbsp of cottage cheese<br/>
or plain yogurt and a tbsp of cod liver oil mixed in with it. They really<br/>
love it and feel like they are getting something *special* for dinner. They<br/>
also get occasional scraps, too. Pizza crusts are their absolute favorite.<br/>

Yeah but there is a big difference in people and dogs just because of how we <br/>
make choices. You are choosing to stay or not stay a certain way. Dogs in <br/>
the wild and domestic dogs way back then didn&#39;t live nearly as long as they <br/>
do now. In a way, they count on us to take care of them to prolong their <br/>
lives and give them quality. Those aren&#39;t decisions they can make <br/>
themselves. They will drink anti freeze and eat poison with no regard to <br/>
what it will do. They will run out in to the street. That&#39;s where <br/>
responsible ownership should come in. For us as people to make good <br/>
decisions on their behalf. Dogs don&#39;t live as long in general as people and <br/>
aren&#39;t as large either, that&#39;s why just 5 lbs can make a difference in their <br/>
quality and quantity of life.<br/>
