<div id="ygrps-yiv-869504543">Hi Group,<br/>
<br/>
It was suggested to read Adelle Faber books.  I need<br/>
someone to walk me thru this.  How many books has she<br/>
written and which one should I read first?  If I ever<br/>
heard of Adelle Faber it went in one ear and out the<br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since we have been unschooling I have been learning<br/>
the educational aspect of it; everyone in the home is<br/>
doing very well with it.  I am now seeing the<br/>
connection between the learning and the disciple. <br/>
Diane is a good enough friend to tell me that I have<br/>
control issues with the children. YIKES! I need to get<br/>
away from that and allow the children the<br/>
opportunities to work out their own problems. <br/>
<br/>
Trusting that the children will learn what they need<br/>
is good here, but trusting that the children will<br/>
solve their problems between themselves does make me<br/>
nervous.  But I know what we are doing isn&#39;t working,<br/>
so I am open to try something different even if that<br/>
means doing it on &quot;blind faith&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Those aren&#39;t the only two choices.  I hate the idea of children being left to <br/>
solve their own problems.  But I don&#39;t like a parent just saying &quot;you <br/>
do/sit/say this, and you respond with this, and now it&#39;s all fixed,&quot; because <br/>
that&#39;s not true.<br/>
<br/>
With my kids, I talk them through, individually, what they&#39;re angry about and <br/>
what might help.  I don&#39;t play trial with them in the same room telling their <br/>
sides.  That just makes for more antagonism.  I go back and forth, three or <br/>
four passes, until each of them has heard (second hand/filtered) the other&#39;s <br/>
concerns, with my mom-concerns added, and by then they&#39;re calm, they&#39;ve <br/>
expressed themselves, they&#39;re soothed, and they have ideas for prevention <br/>
next time.<br/>

<br/>
The family tried this last week.  The goal that I had<br/>
set was that the children would find compromise with<br/>
each other.  The process took everyone to a different<br/>
insight.  The conversation provided the children of an<br/>
understanding that we as a family can share the same<br/>
experience (such as a walk around the block) and each<br/>
of us has our own perception of that experience.  <br/>
<br/>
But this took 2 hrs.  I was lucky that the 2 yr old<br/>
was asleep at the time, and hubby was busy playing<br/>

Sounds like &quot;the family&quot; didn&#39;t try anything, YOU did something to a subset <br/>
of your family.<br/>
<br/>
Just reflecting back what you wrote.<br/>
<br/>
It helps, when people are looking at their parenting and unschooling, to be <br/>
careful not to say &quot;we&quot; when you really mean &quot;I.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what you did worked out, but it doesn&#39;t sound like a family owned and <br/>
operated activity.  <br/>
If it was your kids&#39; idea to do it, I&#39;ll feel differently about it, maybe <br/>
(depending where they got the idea &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>
<br/>
I find that when the kids are made to confront each other, things are said in <br/>
anger which  can never be unsaid, and that doesn&#39;t help.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
You are correct; it wasn&#39;t family owned.  I was<br/>
running it.  The children were told when they could<br/>
talk and when they had to listen. : (  It also<br/>
re-enforced the idea of someone needing a punishment.<br/>
<br/>
I am not going to say more on this topic.  I am going<br/>
to the bookstore. I will also follow the insights and<br/>
experiences, etc. of the group.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

You don&#39;t need anything but to just keep reading this list, maybe <br/>
www.unschooling.com, not TCS (too extreme for me).  It&#39;s just awareness.  <br/>
Nothing special.  Just being aware of thoughts and words and actions.  Being <br/>

find if I listen to her feelings - and it&#39;s often hard for me when the<br/>

out.  I&#39;m her facilitator, if you will.<br/>

should let the children work it out between themselves, with little or no<br/>

feel I spend way too much time sorting it out.  Any suggestions? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When kids are at a stage of physically hitting or when there&#39;s a risk of <br/>
property damage, I think a parent who leave kids to work it out are being <br/>
neglectful at best and contributing to the violence.  My parents raised two <br/>
of my cousins, female, about the ages of me and my younger sister.   The <br/>
younger cousin was mean and strong, and hit HARD.  She only wailed on me <br/>
once, but if my parents had been like some parents I&#39;ve known since and read <br/>
about, she could have done it weekly or better, in the name of working things <br/>
out on her own.<br/>
<br/>
Even just a mean name-calling session is more than a child deserves just for <br/>
being born into a family with other siblings neither of his choosin nor <br/>
creation.  <br/>
<br/>
Had Kirby been an only child he would have other problems, perhaps, but since <br/>
I brought Marty in to live with him, I need to protect Kirby from Marty, and <br/>
vice versa.  It&#39;s not that hard.  And if in the same act of protection I also <br/>
help them sort out various options on how to think about and respond to <br/>
sibling difficulties, I&#39;m just being a responsible and attentive mom, in my <br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t TELL them what they have to do (other than to get their adrenaline <br/>
out and figure out a better thing to do that to yell, hit, or slam things <br/>
around).  I let them express their anger and frustration to me.  That gets it <br/>
out where I can try to soothe and sympathize and remind them I love them, and <br/>
maybe remind them they&#39;ve been like that other kid, but things get better <br/>
with age and experience.<br/>
<br/>
How much time helping a child understand the world and how to be a happier <br/>
and better person could be &quot;too much time&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If you go past the point that the kids are receptive, that might be too much. <br/>
 But my guess from what you wrote is that your hands-off friends might want <br/>
you to be more hands off so they don&#39;t feel they need to do what you&#39;re <br/>
doing.   Sad, but that happens.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863017934">So many books...<br/>
<br/>
I just finished Child&#39;s Work, by Nancy Wallace.  I enjoyed it VERY much.  I<br/>
had also read her first book, Better Than School.  She began homeschooling<br/>
her two children in the 80&#39;s and had quite a struggle with the local school<br/>
district in the early years.  Child&#39;s Work discusses her personal struggle<br/>
between what society thinks children should be doing and how her own<br/>
children learned what they needed from everything that they did.  They were<br/>
friends with John Holt, who makes a few appearances in the book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-262847276">Ok, my sons are both have spring birthdays and they&#39;re turning 2 and 5,<br/>
so I&#39;m not pretending to have life-long answers, but they do get along<br/>
extremely well, so I thought I&#39;d share some of the ways I handle their<br/>
disagreements.  <br/>
 <br/>
First, I approach it as though they are both in the right and it&#39;s<br/>
merely the situation, and their conflicting goals, causing the problem.<br/>
For example, when the &quot;baby&quot; was a little younger he went through a<br/>
period of knocking down block towers.  His brother obviously didn&#39;t<br/>
appreciate it.  When I saw a block tower get knocked down, before my<br/>
oldest had a chance to react, I&#39;d say, &quot;Oh, look, your brother is<br/>
pretending to be a giant dinosaur and he&#39;s having a lot of fun knocking<br/>
down your blocks!  That&#39;s so nice of you to build a block tower for<br/>
him!&quot;  Now, some kids might look at me like I was an idiot, but my son<br/>
actually looked at it from the point of view I was trying to show and<br/>
starting building towers and then saying, &quot;Come on, knock this one<br/>
down!&quot; and having great fun.  And then during his brother&#39;s naps I&#39;d<br/>
remind him that it would be a perfect chance to build something that<br/>
doesn&#39;t get knocked down.<br/>
 <br/>
Also, if one of them hits the other, I say, &quot;Oops!  Your frustration got<br/>
so big that you forgot not to hit your brother!&quot;  I acknowledge the<br/>
feelings of both parties and I emphasize the source of the conflict and<br/>
how we can solve it.  Now it&#39;s at the point where the 5 year old never<br/>
hits his brother anymore, and the 2 year old sometimes still does, but<br/>
his brother doesn&#39;t retaliate, he just says, &quot;We don&#39;t hit people.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
When my younger son was first born, I made up a song about how much I<br/>
love him and how much I love his brother.  I&#39;d sit holding the baby in<br/>
the same room his brother was playing in.  Even though the baby didn&#39;t<br/>
understand the words (to him it was just a snuggle and a song), his<br/>
brother *did* understand the words and knew that even though I was<br/>
spending so much time with the new baby, that they were both my boys and<br/>
I love them both.  I&#39;ve always emphasized how wonderful it is for both<br/>
of them to have a brother to play with and how much I love my own<br/>
brother (who&#39;s a Marine and stationed in the Persian Gulf right now; I&#39;m<br/>
not being phony when I say it&#39;s wonderful to be able to play with your<br/>
brother.  I really do wish my brother was still sitting in the living<br/>
room playing legos with me instead of sitting on a ship half-way around<br/>
the world).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270846748">Great wonderful suggestions! I have a two and a half year old who has a brand new sister (Nora is 3 months) and I have made up several Sadie and Nora songs for them. I always try to include Sadie in whatever aspect of caring for Nora that she wants to and I am always happily surprised at how much she does want to do. She loves to put powder on Nora&#39;s little butt while I change her and to remind me that Nora needs diapers but she doesn&#39;t anymore. Talk about a reminder that children will learn when they are ready: Sadie just decided one day a month ago that she had had it with diapers and was ready to move on. Two days later she was potty trained. All we did was push those well meaning grandparents away when they tried to pressure her about it and read a couple books about the subject and she knew when she was ready and now she is so proud to not be the &quot;baby&quot; like little Nora:) <br/>

feelings of both parties and I emphasize the source of the conflict and<br/>
how we can solve it.  Now it&#39;s at the point where the 5 year old never<br/>
hits his brother anymore, and the 2 year old sometimes still does, but<br/>
his brother doesn&#39;t retaliate, he just says, &quot;We don&#39;t hit people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When my younger son was first born, I made up a song about how much I<br/>
love him and how much I love his brother.  I&#39;d sit holding the baby in<br/>
the same room his brother was playing in.  Even though the baby didn&#39;t<br/>
understand the words (to him it was just a snuggle and a song), his<br/>
brother *did* understand the words and knew that even though I was<br/>
spending so much time with the new baby, that they were both my boys and<br/>
I love them both.  I&#39;ve always emphasized how wonderful it is for both<br/>
of them to have a brother to play with and how much I love my own<br/>
brother (who&#39;s a Marine and stationed in the Persian Gulf right now; I&#39;m<br/>
not being phony when I say it&#39;s wonderful to be able to play with your<br/>
brother.  I really do wish my brother was still sitting in the living<br/>
room playing legos with me instead of sitting on a ship half-way around<br/>
the world).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514170474">My son learned the potty on his own, but not as early as your daughter.<br/>
When he was nearly two, my parents gave him a potty.  He started<br/>
screaming and threw it down the stairs.  The plastic broke and we threw<br/>
it away.<br/>
 <br/>
When he was 2 ½, my parents said, Were not trying to pressure you, but<br/>
heres a potty-training video for Christmas.  My son was not<br/>
interested.<br/>
 <br/>
At three, he was still not interested.  As he was turning four, I was<br/>
getting a lot of comments from my parents and they thought they were<br/>
being proved right, that children wont learn on their own and need to<br/>
be trained.  I kept changing his diapers without pressuring him.  Id<br/>
ask now and then if he wanted to try the potty and he said no.<br/>
 <br/>
Well, one day when he was nearly four and a half, my husband was<br/>
attempting to put a diaper on him after a bath and he said, Im a big<br/>
boy.  Bring me some underwear.   He started wearing only underwear and<br/>
using the potty every time.  Just like that.  Hes never had a single<br/>
accident.  Not once.<br/>
 <br/>
A lot of parents might not be willing to wait until a childs 4 ½, but<br/>
it did prove to me that hell learn (and learn well) when hes ready<br/>
(and not one week before!).  Now hes been showing his brother how the<br/>
potty works, and his brother has been taking off his diaper and sitting<br/>
on it, which is more than my older son ever did at 23 months.  He cheers<br/>
for his brother and hugs him and tells him hes doing great.  My mom<br/>
said, Hell potty train his brother and then youll be done changing<br/>
diapers!  But Im not in a hurry.  I know it might still be a few<br/>
years, and I know that it will work out just fine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-331362165">It&#39;s so funny because I kept thinking over the last couple of months &quot;How did I potty train Molly (my ten year old)?&quot; and for the life of me I couldn&#39;t remember and I think that is because I didn&#39;t train Molly to do anything, she did it on her own. Sadie was young to make this initiative on her own. She has had a couple pee pee accidents and we just get cleaned up and move on with life. I asked her if she wanted to wear her diapers again when she had a solid day of wetting everytime and she said no way! So we just do with that. I think having the younger sibling made her want to distinguish herself. <br/>

&lt;&lt; This is so true my sister was tormented as a child she wet the bed until <br/>
she was 8 or so and the school kids would call her names like pee-body.  To <br/>
this day my sister has very low self esteem and I believe that this had a big <br/>
part in it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Marty peed the bed until lately, nine or ten.  He wore adult diapers at <br/>
night.  Anyone I found had made fun of him got a personal visitation from me. <br/>
 (Kirby and a couple of his friends, not much, not too hard.)   <br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s self esteem is nearly dangerously high.  And he doesn&#39;t pee the bed <br/>
anymore, nor has he ever as far as I know had a bad dream about it, nor even <br/>
ever cried.<br/>
<br/>
It was treated very matter of factly and supportively.  <br/>
<br/>
I learned that from talking to a female friend who peed the bed into school <br/>
age and was shamed publically (her grandmother would hang the sheet on the <br/>
front fence and tell the neighbors, literally), and my husband, who wasn&#39;t <br/>
dry until he was eight or so.<br/>

  back to her diaper. We have cute little panties from Sierra that I think she <br/>
  would like to wear but is definitely not ready yet.<br/>
<br/>
  I have no problem with it aside from the MIL. Next time I&#39;ll just say we <br/>
  train our dogs, not our kids.<br/>

It&#39;s so sad that people, (especially one&#39;s own grandmother) could be so damaging!  <br/>

  &lt;&lt; This is so true my sister was tormented as a child she wet the bed until <br/>
  she was 8 or so and the school kids would call her names like pee-body.  To <br/>
  this day my sister has very low self esteem and I believe that this had a big <br/>
  part in it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Marty peed the bed until lately, nine or ten.  He wore adult diapers at <br/>
  night.  Anyone I found had made fun of him got a personal visitation from me. <br/>
  (Kirby and a couple of his friends, not much, not too hard.)   <br/>
<br/>
  Marty&#39;s self esteem is nearly dangerously high.  And he doesn&#39;t pee the bed <br/>
  anymore, nor has he ever as far as I know had a bad dream about it, nor even <br/>
  ever cried.<br/>
<br/>
  It was treated very matter of factly and supportively.  <br/>
<br/>
  I learned that from talking to a female friend who peed the bed into school <br/>
  age and was shamed publically (her grandmother would hang the sheet on the <br/>
  front fence and tell the neighbors, literally), and my husband, who wasn&#39;t <br/>
  dry until he was eight or so.<br/>
