<div id="ygrps-yiv-18086947">Never lie to your kids - if algebra makes you want to schedule a<br/>
root canal instead, you may as well say so upfront.  You can<br/>
honestly say &quot;I never really got it, but lots of folks do and<br/>
love it.  It certainly seems to come in handy for some things; I<br/>
have always been aware that there was a hole in my knowledge<br/>
because I don&#39;t get it.  If you want to learn it, I bet you can<br/>
do so without more effort than it is worth&quot;  or something<br/>
similar.<br/>

your algebra<br/>

| &gt; Go to www.hsc.org and look for last year&#39;s conference tapes<br/>
and buy<br/>

| &gt; Try and convince your librarian to buy Frank Smith&#39;s book<br/>
about math<br/>

ideas.  They<br/>

tomorrow she came and<br/>

answer sound<br/>

at that<br/>

Ok...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-517797131">I totally agree. I have always been honest w/ Brianna. She, in turn, is - hopefully -always honest w/ me.<br/>
As some of you may know, Brianna is my granddaughter. Her mother - my daughter- has two other kids w/ a man not Brianna&#39;s father. He&#39;s black. The 6 y.o. - who is obviously bi-racial has been told that her dad (the black man) is Brianna&#39;s dad. Obviously this is something that the 6 y.o. will come to know is a lie. It&#39;s obvious by simply looking at the girls!!<br/>
My daughter is very upset that Brianna & I will not lie about this. In fact, my daughter has &#39;talked&#39; to Brianna and feels that Brianna is disrespecting her by not being dishonest.<br/>
Brianna listens - then usually says that her relationship w/ her sisters is between her ( Brianna) and them. Not their mother.She says also that she will not lie to them. I&#39;m so proud of Brianna for this because she kind of is afraid that she&#39;ll not see her mother because of it. (Once time we didn&#39;t hear from her for over ten months!)<br/>
She has the strength to do this because she knows that she doesn&#39;t have to lie. She knows this because I don&#39;t lie to her.<br/>
<br/>
I am amazed how &#39;simple&#39; this whole child rearing thing is -Be the adult you want your kids to be.<br/>
