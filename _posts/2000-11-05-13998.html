<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800299584">For the believers in Santa and their kidlets.  Take the naughty or nice<br/>
quiz.  Be sure and go to the Reindeer barn (for big kids) and the Elf School<br/>
(for little kids and a cute &quot;Elf Diploma&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Mine came back:  &quot;Nice, but has been naughty at times. Neatness and<br/>
politeness have been very good over the last two weeks. Shows proper respect<br/>
for others. Shares well, but could always be better. With a little more<br/>
effort could be near top of &quot;nice&quot; list.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Waaaaa, and here I thought I was perfect &lt;&lt;&lt;BEWG&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
