<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118061018">Is there anyone else out there (besides me) whose kids constantly <br/>
want to go somewhere and never seem to just want to hang around home?<br/>
We seem to run into problems where my almost-4yo and I really like <br/>
to be home a lot and do home-y things, while my older two boys (8 <br/>
and 10) want to go from one adventure/outing to the next.  I get so <br/>
exhausted with the pace of life that they want.  We have plenty of <br/>
things to do around the house- zillions of toys/books/board <br/>
games/computer games/video games/instruments/art <br/>
supplies/DVDs/videos/cooking ingredients/cable tv, etc. but if we <br/>
aren&#39;t running out the door to &quot;Do Something&quot;, or at least planning <br/>
to in the near future, they claim they&#39;re bored-  meaning that <br/>
staying within our four walls or yard is boring no matter how many <br/>
things there are to do.  The only time our house isn&#39;t &quot;boring&quot; is <br/>
when they each have a friend or two here to play with all their <br/>
stuff *with* them- the more kids the less &quot;boring.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
If they could plan it their way we&#39;d have a big outing daily (think <br/>
skateparks, amusement parks, fishing trips, laser tag, arcades) or <br/>
at least several small ones, and preferably we&#39;d pack in several <br/>
extra kids along with us and then bring them all to our tiny house <br/>
for a loud rambunctious sleepover.  I&#39;m fine doing this several <br/>
times a week, but not all day every day... I just plain burn out.<br/>
We could be just arriving home after being out and busily doing for <br/>
several hours, and my middle son will *immediately* start saying (in <br/>
a whiny voice :-/) that he wants to &quot;go somewhere,&quot; and I find <br/>
myself feeling seriously irritated and in need of some down time.  <br/>
If there&#39;s nothing on our big wall calendar they will say, <br/>
outraged, &quot;we don&#39;t have anything to DO today!?&quot;  It doesn&#39;t help to <br/>
have our nearby family members translate this into boredom with <br/>
homeschooling in general and a need to be in school with other <br/>
kids.  The fact that school is the last type of &quot;outing&quot; my boys <br/>
have in mind is lost on them.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m just venting and at the same time wondering if anyone <br/>
else has this frantic pace of life.<br/>
Mabye I just need a new perspective..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-706739660">It starts at the ages your boys are at. With mine it did.<br/>
My son would plan the night before where we would be<br/>
going the next day.<br/>
I had to put and end to it really fast, and the pouting<br/>
about being bored.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t easy on me putting my foot down.<br/>
My reponse to I&#39;m bored, is you better find something to<br/>
do, or I will find you something to do.<br/>
You may want to promt them at bed time, and let them<br/>
know that you are staying home tomorrow so they are<br/>
forewarned.<br/>
The go, go, go is very addicting to kids, and I think kids need<br/>
to learn to entertain themselves when they are at home.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Could it be that even though there&#39;s lots of stuff for them to do at <br/>
home, that they get more of your undivided attention when they&#39;re out <br/>
somewhere?  Maybe if you make a conscious effort to do &quot;something <br/>
big&quot; at home, you could make all 3 kids happy. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe find a really cool kit of some kind, or a cool activity printed <br/>
out from the internet, and say, &quot;I&#39;m going to put on the calender <br/>
that on such and such a date we&#39;re going to do this.  Tie dye t-<br/>
shirts or do an experiment with crickets or do something from a <br/>
chemistry kit.  Something really cool that would really appeal to <br/>
them that you could do at home every other day.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618196792">My kids don&#39;t necessarily want to go anywhere so much<br/>
as they want to be outside. Sarah especially..she<br/>
remembers Florida and being able to pretty much be<br/>
outside nonstop except for meals (when she wasn&#39;t<br/>
eating outside!!). Logan doesn&#39;t remember Florida that<br/>
I can tell, but he and Megan are both outside types.<br/>
So am I...being in MA has been hard on us. <br/>

<br/>
This isn&#39;t really taking the childs needs into account.<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; is a call for Mom to help them come up with something fun and <br/>
creative, help them learn how to problem solve in a positive way.<br/>
Not shut down an opportunity to help them.<br/>
