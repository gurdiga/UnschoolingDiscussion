<div id="ygrps-yiv-830589428">Someone please help me before I drive my whole family nuts! <br/>
I&#39;m trying to think of a memorable name for my new business; selling nappies, <br/>
slings, etc. (types that aren&#39;t currently available in the UK, AFAIK, so <br/>
hopefully not treading on anyone&#39;s toes here. If I am then I apologise. <br/>
Sorry.) Every really good name I&#39;ve come up with so far has been taken <br/>
already. :-(<br/>
Stu (dh) is so desperate to have me stop firing random words at him in the <br/>
middle of talking about something else that he has suggested offering a very <br/>
cute nappy as a thank you for the person who suggests the name I end up <br/>
using.<br/>
So what do you think? Feeling creative? <br/>

(Did I mention boring?!) But hey, not too many hits on<br/>
the web, and StuffForBabies.com might still even be<br/>
available!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621527788">I  read some material that suggests you create a business name that your <br/>
perspective customers remember, one that describes what you sell and what <br/>
your name is. <br/>
<br/>
 My business name is The SoapSmith. I bet you can figure out what I sell (and <br/>
make) and what my last name is. :)  Good Luck. <br/>
<br/>
Joy:) <br/>

&quot;High and Dry&quot; would be descriptive, but doesn&#39;t have the warm, safe <br/>

How about &quot;Safe and Warm&quot;?</div>
