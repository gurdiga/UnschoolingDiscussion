<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884756899"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Very true!  But on the flip side, don&#39;t you remember friends at college <br/>
&gt;&gt;(during the time they managed to stay) who couldn&#39;t focus and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>get the work done,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, my dear husband!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;because they were so unregulated at home that they never learned how to <br/>
&gt;&gt;focus, and how to a plough through the difficult stuff to get to their <br/>
&gt;&gt;goal.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope that wasn&#39;t the reason. His parents did try to &quot;teach&quot; him how to focus <br/>
on what they thought was important. He just refused to play the game. So <br/>
maybe he was unregulated, but it wasn&#39;t a parental choice. He was just an <br/>
unschooler at heart. He thought that school was a &quot;waste of his time&quot; (His <br/>
words) and so he wouldn&#39;t bring the focus other people thought he should <br/>
have. He made his own choices because no one could force him to do <br/>
otherwise. He&#39;s an accomplished writer, a computer programmer, a candle <br/>
maker and a chef in training. It didn&#39;t matter that he didn&#39;t achieve the <br/>
school goals, because they weren&#39;t HIS goals.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;This would require quite a long essay - maybe I will find the time to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>write it one day :) but not likely, as one of the pitfalls of my<br/>
unschooling history is, lots of good ideas but no self-regulation to put <br/>
them into effect!!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you want to write, then write!! :o) Your unschooly, unstructured <br/>
childhood is NOT holding you back. You are holding you back. You have right <br/>
now, this moment, to have an idea. To jot it down. To mull it over. It took <br/>
me 40 years to find my writing soul again. I blamed school, you blame <br/>
unschool. But really, all we have is ourselves in THIS moment. It was very <br/>
freeing for me to discover that I have the power to change my path. My past <br/>
does NOT have to determine my future. Freeing.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
