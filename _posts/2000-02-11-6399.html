<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668890249">&lt;P.S.  New thread??  My husband and I are talking about him working less<br/>
and I<br/>
really feel it would be great (long overdue) and I also think the whole<br/>
hsing/unschooling going on at home is part of that &quot;simplifying my life&quot;<br/>
<br/>
attitude which I seem to be creeping up on.  Everybody else already<br/>
BTDT??&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re trying to simplify.  It doesn&#39;t require my husband working less<br/>
but does require us moving back into our old house (which we&#39;ve had<br/>
rented for the past five years) back into the city and not having to<br/>
drive 45 minutes to get to everywhere.  We will have added two more kids<br/>
by then (our 6th is due in July) and it will be 1000 sq. ft less than<br/>
what we have now.  Our idea of &quot;living in the country&quot; and keeping it<br/>
simply just didn&#39;t pan out.<br/>
<br/>
We currently have the house we&#39;re living in now up for sale and have had<br/>
lots of calls (we&#39;re selling on our own) but only 4 lookers.  But, it<br/>
hasn&#39;t even been two weeks yet.  The best news is after we move, the<br/>
house we move back into will be paid off!<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is, we could have sold both, bought a big fancy house<br/>
in the &#39;burbs and been strapped for mortgage, but instead choose to live<br/>
in a smaller space and make do.<br/>
<br/>
Both of our vehicles are over 130,000 miles and are 1987 and 1988<br/>
models, we joke that after we move maybe my husband can buy a new one<br/>
that will be a 1990!  (But, hey both are paid off.)<br/>
