<div id="ygrps-yiv-646143737">WOW Mary that is a neat story. I had a memory when you were talking about your Dad. I remember being able to figure out math problems, I think addition, without taking the steps REQUIRED. I remember my teacher telling me that the problem was wrong though the answer was right because I did not follow the STEPS! That may be why I dont like math to this day, because I dont want to do it &quot;wrong&quot;. How awful, I have always carried this fear that I am doing it wrong. That may be why! Ok- dont laugh everyone- major epiphany going on here! :-)<br/>
God bless<br/>

  &gt;&gt;My brother almost didn&#39;t graduate high school, from all his f&#39;s in<br/>
  English.  He skipped English to go to the computer lab and play with<br/>
  computers.  Fortunately my sister tutored him that last six months of<br/>
  prison, I mean high school, so he was set free, I mean graduated.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  This was my Dad! Well, except that they didn&#39;t have computer lab in 1939. <br/>
  ;-) But he also had loads of trouble in school due to poor English grades. <br/>
  And they&#39;d also mark his math papers wrong, or worse failed for cheating, <br/>
  becasue he didn&#39;t show his steps when he solved problems.<br/>
<br/>
  This man definitely dreams in numbers. I wouldn&#39;t recognize his house if he <br/>
  didn&#39;t have long strings of numbers listed on papers on various desk tops <br/>
  and counters throughout the house. He hated his one year in Cooper Union <br/>
  College and went on to become an Electrical Engineer on his own. He told me <br/>
  that the schools step by step process didn&#39;t make sense to him. He had to <br/>
  make sense of the numbers on his own.<br/>
<br/>
  Now, the best part of the story follows. This man who failed every English <br/>
  class, who hated to read, who swore he couldn&#39;t write or spell, has written <br/>
  a book. When he retired he became one of those guys who does geneology. He <br/>
  does nothing but read, write, research and use his beloved numbers <br/>
  practically every day. He wrote a book on his findings and they put it in <br/>
  his local library for other researchers to use. He is just my best example <br/>
  of *they&#39;ll learn it because they need it and have an interest*.<br/>
<br/>
  Life is good.<br/>
