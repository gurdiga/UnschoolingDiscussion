 </span></blockquote>Oh, Erin, it sounds like you&#39;re having a frustrating day!  <br/>
<br/>
When I have a frustrating day, my husband, who&#39;s a really staunch supporter <br/>
of unschooling, and my best cheerleader, reminds me that it is not my <br/>
responsibility to keep our children occupied every hour of the day.  Kids <br/>
need the time to veg, be creative and innovative, develop initiative.  <br/>
<br/>
He also reminds me that unschooling is more than just letting children learn <br/>
at their own pace.  Children must also be allowed to learn what they need <br/>
when they need it.  It is conceivable that some children may never actually <br/>
learn math beyond how to operate a calculator.  If they don&#39;t need math, why <br/>
bother with it?   When they need it they will take steps to learn it.  If <br/>
they need me to help them, I&#39;m right there.  <br/>
<br/>
That has taken a lot of pressure off me and I worry a lot less.  This is not <br/>
to say that I don&#39;t present them with opportunities or make suggestions.  I <br/>
certainly do.  Sometimes they act on it, sometimes not.  Whichever way is <br/>
okay.  <br/>
<br/>
Just passing along some thoughts that have helped me over the hump a few <br/>
times.  <br/>
