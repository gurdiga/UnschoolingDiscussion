P.S.   I looked it up.  It&#39;s a fancy term for thinking.  I figured.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845093100">Kicking myself for being caught flat-footed (which I am - never heard <br/>
of it) but  as intrigued by the term as you are. There&#39;s a pretty cool annual <br/>
Robotics competition/showcase in Orlando but I don&#39;t think this is it. In <br/>
that, teams are given a design problem such as making a robot that can function as <br/>
a conference guest, from tipping the valet and finding the lecture rooms to <br/>
schmoozing with the speakers and other attendees. (That was one of my personal <br/>
favorites &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
       I&#39;ll poke around IRL in the next day or two -- JJ<br/>
