<div id="ygrps-yiv-46599411">Hi!  I&#39;ve never posted to the group before, although I do read <br/>
posted messages every now and then for inspiration/validation <br/>
about unschooling.  I have been homeschooling my son for two <br/>
years with no curriculum to speak of.  He was really beat down <br/>
from public schooling and needed a break from the grading <br/>
system and the peer pressure.  We started him a year early in <br/>
kindergarten in school, because he was reading/writing at age <br/>
three.  But we now realize that might have been a mistake as he <br/>
wasn&#39;t emotionally mature to deal with all the social issues.  <br/>
Now he is 13.  He stopped public school after 6th grade, was <br/>
homeschooled for 2 years (for 7th and 8th), and now we want <br/>
him to restart public school in grade 8 where he will be with kids <br/>
his own age rather than with kids a year older than him (he is <br/>
fine with this).  We really want him to have a traditional school <br/>
experience and I think he is ready to reintegrate.  <br/>
<br/>
My question is, in order to restart 8th grade the school system is <br/>
asking that I show my records and the curriculum I used for two <br/>
years.  How do I do that with unschooling?  Since the whole point <br/>
of it is that is unstructered?  I really have to records other than a <br/>
more well adjusted kid who has learned maybe not the three &quot;r&quot;s <br/>
but has learned his place in the world?  thanks, PrincessSputnik</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013527079">Why do you want him to have a traditional school experience?  Does he want this?  How do you think he could go back to school without becoming &quot;beat down&quot; again?  Have you found local homeschool/unschool support?<br/>
<br/>
As far as records, I would probably just make a list of the things he has done while not attending school.  It is usually pretty easy to write a child&#39;s activities in a way that makes them appear schoolish.<br/>

<br/>
Depending where you are, state law might say you &quot;have&quot; to follow a course of <br/>
study.  You did, it was just a loose one!<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t think it depends what state you&#39;re in (if you&#39;re in the U.S.), <br/>
real &quot;credits&quot; don&#39;t begin until 9th grade/high school freshman.  <br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re worried, ask them if they have a placement test.  (They probably <br/>
don&#39;t!)<br/>
If you want to push back, ask if they have tests for him to test out of 7th <br/>
grade so he can get go into 8th having proven something (whatever it might be <br/>
&lt;g&gt;) to them.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;d just go with Carol Narigon&#39;s outline and write up something <br/>
summarizing the things he&#39;s done in vague terms and give it to them.<br/>

<br/>
To understand what the school wants, I would try to look at it from<br/>
their point of view.  The school&#39;s objective is probably to see if your<br/>
son can handle the 9th grade curriculum.  Many states (such as CA) have<br/>
their curriculum for each grade listed at their Department of Education<br/>
website.  Looking at what middle schools are supposed to cover for 7th<br/>
and 8th grade can give you an idea whether your son is &quot;prepared&quot; for<br/>
9th grade, or not.  <br/>
<br/>
You may also want to look over the curriculum standards for your state<br/>
for 9th grade to see if they are the slightest bit interesting.  Will<br/>
your son get anything out of the school curriculum?  Is it worth<br/>
spending 9 months on?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t let the &quot;standards&quot; intimidate you.  I&#39;m very skeptical that any<br/>
teacher in an average school can actually get a whole class full of kids<br/>
to perform on that level.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975086765">I want my child to have a traditional school experience partly <br/>
because I feel he is entitled to it, partly because I had one and I <br/>
think it can be a positive experience, and partly because I want <br/>
him to feel part of something larger.  He has mixed feelings <br/>
about going back to public school.  He wants to go because he <br/>
wants &quot;normalcy&quot; in his life (do the same things, have the same <br/>
experiences that his friends -and the society at large- have).  But <br/>
he is worried about the structure and the sitting in a classroom, <br/>
the grades and whether he is &quot;smart enough&quot;,  and doing the <br/>
homework  which was a major issue.  He doesn&#39;t understand <br/>
having to do a sheet of math problems when he knows how to <br/>
do it after one problem.  Hates writing personal narratives <br/>
through a dictated structure ... how are they his writings if <br/>
someone else is telling him how to construct the paragraph?  <br/>
He was picked on at school for being different (as everyone who <br/>
is any bit unusual is in middle school) which he did not handle <br/>
well.  Without going into the long story, I think that he lacked the <br/>
maturity needed to deal with kids a year older (or more) than him <br/>
and his own intelligence. I think the last two years have taught <br/>
him to be more observant of how the world works and how to fit <br/>
in better without compromising his own principles. And coping <br/>
skills to help avoid &quot;mean&quot; people.<br/>
<br/>
We have been doing the homeschool/unschool thing on our <br/>
own.  We have a younger daughter going into 5th grade who <br/>
goes to public school and loves it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-543805893">Thanks for that link.  I printed out that &quot;curriculum&quot;  and will try<br/>
to <br/>
fit my sons experiences into something like that.  Although I am <br/>

will be presenting as &quot;proof&quot;.  I don&#39;t handle conflict well (yeah, I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223276527">Hi, I live in Delaware.  On the education website here they have <br/>
somewhat listed what each grade will be expected to learn in <br/>
&quot;school -ese&quot; language.  They have big PDF files full of this sort <br/>
of hard to read stuff (I&#39;m not a total idiot ... I did get a<br/>
bachelors <br/>
degree in college ... and I even wonder why they need twenty five <br/>
words to say something that could be summarized in a five word <br/>
sentence).   <br/>
<br/>
Delaware is pretty liberal (in theory only) about homeschooling.  <br/>
Kind of a &quot;don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell&quot; policy.  They don&#39;t want to know <br/>
exactly what you are doing but you better be doing what they <br/>
want.  I can kind of feel an unspoken hostility from the <br/>
established education community about homeschooling in <br/>
general.  Bringing up &quot;unschooling&quot; would probably bring <br/>
spoken hostility.  I am reluctant to tell my son&#39;s school that I <br/>
unschooled him.  That would be like telling them that they <br/>
screwed up and I had to do it (undo it) on my own.    !?!<br/>
<br/>
We picked &quot;unschooling&quot; as the way to teach my son because <br/>
my son refused to do anything that even smelled of school for <br/>
the longest time after pulling him out of public school 7th grade <br/>
after only two weeks.  I tried a packaged curriculum the first year <br/>
and that made him shut down.  I purchased tons of <br/>
homeschooling theory books and none of them fit us.  <br/>
Unschooling seemed to be what my son wanted and needed... a <br/>
chance to decompress away from structure and find his own way <br/>
of learning.  I&#39;m not just a little scared that  sending him back to <br/>
public school won&#39;t send him spiraling back to &quot;an unhappy <br/>
place&quot; in his own mind.  But I think that we are both (or  all three <br/>
of us since my husband is involved) are ready to take a chance <br/>
again at public school.  He will going to 8th grade in the fall (we <br/>
are considering his two years of homeschooling as 7th grade so <br/>
that he can be with kids his own age again).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396877536">I wish your son the best of luck.  He and you might find Grace Llewellyn&#39;s books helpful in preparation for returning - Guerilla Learning.  If he is set on going back to school, I would especially recommend that you both read Guerilla Learning.  If he still isn&#39;t sure about going back, then he might enjoy The Teenage Liberation Handbook, also by Llewellyn.<br/>
<br/>
Of course this decision is for your family, but from reading your posts I feel like the best advice is Stay Out of School!  It sounds as if returning to school is something that YOU want for him more than he wants for himself.  There are many ways to feel a part of something larger besides attending public school.  If you want any ideas for that, I&#39;m sure people on this list could give lots of them.<br/>
<br/>
However, consider the source when you read my opinion.  This IS an unschooling list.  If I went to a vegetarian list and asked for advice on transitioning back to eating meat, I would expect that many people would advise that I NOT return to eating meat.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know how it turns out.<br/>

There is no need to worry about transcripts...tell them he was homeschooled and he&#39;s entering 8th grade, if they are really concerned they can give him a placement test I suppose.<br/>

I&#39;m not hearing that he wants to go back to school or that he&#39;s not wanting<br/>

there are ways to change those things for him so he can get what he wants<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129923785">Aaack!  Too much help, too much help! I can&#39;t possibly answer each<br/>
persons advice individually so I will try to answer back to all.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of you are concerned that it is too much what &quot;I want&quot; and not<br/>
enough what &quot;he wants&quot;.  That may be true... but I do want the best<br/>
for my son and I feel that choices I have made for him about his<br/>
schooling are affecting him adversely.   <br/>
<br/>
I talked to my son some today about the issues I have been thinking<br/>
about and his major concern about homeschooling (among many) is that<br/>
he is NOT being schooled.  But on the other hand, he doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
BE schooled by me or anyone.  We have discussed the concept of<br/>
independent study before, that he selects what he wants to learn and<br/>
goes about learning it.  But no matter what he does or studies, he<br/>
just can&#39;t see what he does as learning because it doesn&#39;t happen in a<br/>
classroom and it doesn&#39;t come from a book.  He isn&#39;t feeling like he<br/>
is learning and I don&#39;t know how to communicate to him that he is.<br/>
Parenting is just so hard.  I would teach him a<br/>
reading/writing/arithmatic kind of school if he would let me.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This reason is such a huge reason why my dh and I have made the decision to homeschool. I feel like my children will be part of something so large and so great! I feel like by taking this step we are somehow saying yes to our family and no to the dictates of the society with which we live and that is large indeed. I feel like finding and seeking out fellow homeschoolers to spend time with and finding a friends in other activities aside from the state run public schools is definitely something larger. Really, not to sound hoaky here but when dh approached me with this idea, I said, &quot;wow, that is definitely huge!&quot;  Kelli<br/>

I think MOST kids&#39; school experiences are pretty bad.  I think a few have <br/>
good experiences (mostly good).    I think a large subset of school kids don&#39;t <br/>
seem to be having a particularly bad time *only* because they have given up <br/>
hoping for a good time and have settled for dulling their awareness to get through.<br/>
<br/>
When I was bubbling on about my own good school experiences once when telling <br/>
a friend that her four year old &quot;MIGHT really like school!  I did!&quot; she told <br/>
me that Kirby might have as miserable a time at school as she did, that she <br/>
had really hated it.  And she said this thing which echoed in me to this day:    <br/>
&quot;What are the odds?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And as it turned out, Kirby never went to school and her daughter only <br/>
homeschooled maybe a year and a half, and that with her school-teacher-trained dad <br/>
fussing over her and muttering the whole time.<br/>
<br/>
Her dad trained to teach elementary, but chose to work selling clothes and <br/>
gifts at the big Harley Davidson store here.  Yet he insisted his kids should <br/>
just buck up and go to school.<br/>

reading/writing/arithmatic kind of school if he would let me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like unschooling definitely never took place in your house, not the way it should ideally work. You still have the notion that book learning is a great thing and it would be wonderful to teach your child that way. Unschooling is seeing learning in everything. You being able to do that would help your child see it. <br/>
Meet people that are successful and did not pursue traditional schooling, do things you both love (what are YOUR passions/interests?), treat him as though he were worthy and intelligent and not in need of &quot;filling up&quot; with information.<br/>
It sounds like you both need to de-school BIG time if you both think school -like learning is still necessary. <br/>
I don&#39;t think he needs traditional school at all, I think you&#39;re pouring your own fears into your child and not seeing what he&#39;s learning without school!<br/>
<br/>
Here are a couple of websites I think you should visit:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dreamsbbs.com/nikleba/unschool.html">http://www.dreamsbbs.com/nikleba/unschool.html</a><br/>
Laurie was raised in the unschooling style from birth, read about her successes and pursuits.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.peterkowalke.com/">http://www.peterkowalke.com/</a><br/>
Peter is also a raised unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Life is a journey, each bit of information we get, each new experience helps us build mental models of the world. As your son connects new pieces of information he is interested in, it will stick. Because it is TRUE learning. Memorizing bits and pieces to jump through some stupid hoop (ie:test, homework) is not real learning and doesn&#39;t have any meaning for the person having it foisted upon them.<br/>
Your ds doesn&#39;t want school...what a smart guy.<br/>
Listen to him, find the things he loves doing and do them! Do the things YOU love to do, show him what a life long learner looks like (wow, was that a lot of &quot;L&#39;s&quot; or WHAT!!!).<br/>
:)<br/>
Anyway, I think he needs to follow his heart and you need to listen better...that&#39;s my opinion. School is not the answer, nor is schooling at home.<br/>
I&#39;m surprised you can be lurking at this list and not understand that essential information. Especially the part about letting children choose their own lives.<br/>
