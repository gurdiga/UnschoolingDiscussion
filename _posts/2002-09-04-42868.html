<div id="ygrps-yiv-580638489">&lt;&lt;Don&#39;t forget 4-H&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We LOVE 4-H.  This year my kids are showing goats, raising rabbits, training<br/>
dogs, gardening, doing karate, and sewing all as 4-H projects.  They love<br/>
it.  I love it because it is fairly non-coercive.  You have to do the<br/>
paperwork to get a pin at the end of the year...but if you don&#39;t want a pin,<br/>
you most certainly don&#39;t HAVE to do much of anything.  Most of our projects<br/>
have kids of all ages involved.<br/>
