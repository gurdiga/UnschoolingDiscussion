<br/>
When my leg was broken in October/November/December (sad) the house got <br/>
messier.  Nobody was surprised.<br/>
<br/>
Once I was up and about, it got cleaner.  No big surprise.<br/>

It&#39;s March.  The Christmas decorations&#39; boxes are still in the living room.  <br/>
Holly and I did pack them up tighter a couple of weeks ago, but carrying them <br/>
out to the shed in back (after sealing and clearly labelling) hasn&#39;t <br/>
happened.  <br/>
<br/>
There are various other boxes still unpacked/unexcavated from the room <br/>
switching Holly and I started in October.  Still not finished on my part.  <br/>
Her room is great and she&#39;s keeping it really nice.<br/>
<br/>
But I went to Saskatoon for four days and while I was gone things continued.  <br/>
Keith stayed home, and laundry was kept up, and dishes were done.  <br/>
<br/>
One funny thing:  I have three little kitchen counter areas I keep clean and <br/>
open, and the stove top.  The rest gets cluttery.  There&#39;s a big kind of <br/>
island/bar between two parts of the room.  It collects the odd jar and glass <br/>
and box of cards and book and schedule/flyer/ticket, art supplies... you know.<br/>
<br/>
So my husband who hates such &quot;piles&quot; had shoved it all over so there was <br/>
about a foot clear in front, about three feet wide.  I guess that was his <br/>
work space.<br/>
<br/>
Not a problem.<br/>
<br/>
But these flat surfaces hadn&#39;t been washed since I left.  I wash the stove <br/>
top and in front of the toaster and all that.  There might be a pile of <br/>
cards, but it&#39;s clean enough to put bread down to make a sandwich, when I <br/>
clean it.   Keith wanted space to put plates and trays down.<br/>
<br/>
Just a difference in priorities and habits.<br/>
<br/>
When I was younger I probably would have been grouchy about it, but I&#39;m not <br/>
younger.  Good! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269683819">I&#39;ve noticed that since I&#39;ve dropped any expectations about the chores, the kids are much more willing to help out, and often without my asking.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember when I was a kid, I HATED when my mother asked me to do chores.  I wanted to be able to do it without someone telling me to do it, but I also wanted to do it on my own time schedule, not on hers.<br/>
<br/>
She could never let me alone long enough for me to do something and surprise her just because I finally wanted to.<br/>
I never &quot;finally wanted to&quot; bec. she never let me alone.  It was  HUGE point of contention between us for many years.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad that isn&#39;t true at our house most of the time except for those occasional neurotic moments that I have, or my husband has LOL.  <br/>
<br/>
I confess, after I put the milk away for the 4th time last night (in about an hour) I was just a little bit annoyed.<br/>

<br/>
Yesterday I was waiting for my midwife who was running an hour late.  The <br/>
waiting room was filled with magazines, so i didn&#39;t mind much, although I <br/>
wish I had brought in my worm composting book.  Anyway, I was reading one of <br/>
those Ladies-Home- Compantion-Day-Self-Book magazines and there was a list of <br/>
the top ten things never to try to change in a man.  I can&#39;t remember what <br/>
they all were, but it included putting the seat down and such.  I kept <br/>
laughing and thinking &quot;why the hell would I try to change THAT!&quot;  As if there <br/>
aren&#39;t bigger fish to fry.<br/>
<br/>
If I want the house cleaned the way I want it done, I do it.  Usually with my <br/>
headphones on and a nice book on tape.   If someone is wanting it cleaned in <br/>
a different way, that&#39;s ok too.  I mean, why did I ever have to insist on a <br/>
separate bin for the dinosaurs?  It&#39;s not like I play with the stuff.  In our <br/>
house, dinosaurs build block houses with sheep and cows.  Stuffed dolphins <br/>
yesterday gave me a beautiful bunch of tinker toy roses.  And Drusselmeyer <br/>
(Nathan) helped Clara (Julia) off with her tights and underpants while I was <br/>
in another room.<br/>
<br/>
It took me a long time and a lot of work to get here.  I like it here.  It&#39;s <br/>
a good thing not to be younger and grouchier.<br/>

<br/>
The afternoon&#39;s report on this:<br/>
<br/>
In the recycling are about ten shampoo and conditioner bottles.  Kirby, for <br/>
some reason no one understands, kind of likes for them to just be empty on <br/>
the floor of his shower.  Nobody shares with him.  Every few months, it seems <br/>
dangerous.   At least three times I have myself gone and gathered them.  <br/>
Keith did it once, and grumped loudly.  Holly did it once, when she and I <br/>
were cleaning Kirby&#39;s room as a surprise.   Kirby did it resentfully once <br/>
when I told him he really needed to do it because it wasn&#39;t my job, <br/>
na-na-na-na.<br/>
<br/>
Today, without a word spoken, Kirby brought them all to the recycling.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier today I was messing with kindling, making some sticks to use to make <br/>
&quot;waxy sticks&quot; (dipped in leftover wax, for fire-starting purposes).  No <br/>
hurry.  But while I was by the fire place, Holly was talking to me and said, <br/>
&quot;We should clean the front of the fireplace.&quot;  It smoked a couple of times <br/>
when the wind was high, and a few rows of bricks were grubby looking.<br/>
<br/>
I had a lull while noodles were cooking and I thought I should do that.  So I <br/>
sprayed it with orange foam stuff, found a scrub brush and a spray bottle of <br/>
water and some rags.  Went and scrubbed a while.   <br/>
<br/>
Holly saw and said &quot;Can I do that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sure, I said.  Showed her were the various things needed to end up and she <br/>
very happily and proudly finished the job, and well.<br/>

&lt;&lt; What are waxy sticks and how do you use them?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just kindling sticks dipped in melted wax, kept separate from the other <br/>
kindling.<br/>
<br/>
We used to go to LOTS of medieval feasts.  Not so many lately.  But we&#39;d end <br/>
up with lots of wax drippings and candle stubs.  When Keith and I were <br/>
younger and poorer, we would make more candles with the scrap.  but now that <br/>
we can afford new candles and have a fireplace, we collect it in a can, melt <br/>
it, and dip sticks in.  Holly loves to help.  It might not be the best thing <br/>
for keeping the chimney clean, but luckily we can afford to have the chimney <br/>
cleaned too.  <br/>
<br/>
They make starting fires when camping easier too.  When we are going to camp, <br/>
I throw in a basket of waxed kindling too.  It&#39;s prettier (and more medieval <br/>
in appearance, for sure) than newspaper or cardboard, and safer too.  Burning <br/>
paper can go up the chimney and come down on the roof (or worse, our <br/>
neighbor&#39;s roof).<br/>
