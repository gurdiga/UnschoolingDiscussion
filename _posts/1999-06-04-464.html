 I too have a question about the testing. My oldest daughter is 5, at what age<br/>

&gt;In Washington (we live in Olympia), you are supposed to register your<br/>
&gt;child with the school district as a homeschooler when she is over age<br/>
&gt;8.  It&#39;s no big deal.  Then you have a choice -- either a standardized<br/>
&gt;test (MAT, CAT or any of the other alphabeticals), the results of which<br/>
&gt;you do NOT have to give to the school district or to anyone else, or<br/>
&gt;have the child &quot;evaluated&quot; by a certified teacher - again, you are NOT<br/>
&gt;required to share that evaluation with anyone, just prove that you did<br/>
&gt;it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-367169390">Hello everyone,<br/>
I am new here and have never been to a support group(homeschooling)<br/>
either.  I have been trying to catch up on mailing list before I<br/>
introduce myself, but cant&#39; seem to catch up, so here goes.<br/>
<br/>
I am a unschooling my 2 kids in Central Washington state.  My son,<br/>
Skyler is 8 years old, and my daughter, Cheyenne is 6.  Since my oldest<br/>
was a baby, I was curious about homeschooking and that is when I first<br/>
started to read about it(read some John Holt & others).  It sounded<br/>
wonderful to me, but I didn&#39;t think about it too seriously since it<br/>
seemed I had all the time in the world(before school age)back then. <br/>
Meanwhile, I realize now, I was unschooling both of my children since<br/>
birth.  <br/>
	The first day of school arrived much quicker than I could&#39;ve imagined. <br/>
I had a lot of mixed feelings, but my son did attend Kindergarten.  I<br/>
was very layed back with my son when he was in Kindergarten, allowing<br/>
him to stay home often for &quot;no good reason&quot;:), and his baby sister and I<br/>
would volunteer in the classroom at least once a week.  This went O.K.<br/>
and it was only 2 1/2 hours a day.  I noticed right away that he was<br/>
probably the only child in the classroom(30 kids) that had never<br/>
attended some sort of daycare or preschool.  I couldn&#39;t believe it!  I<br/>
noticed he got very little 1-to-1 attention from his teacher, as she had<br/>
29 other 5/6 year old to attend to, and many of them needed help(which<br/>
is why the teachers like students like Skyler, who listen well, follow<br/>
directions, learn quickly, and work independently), because they don&#39;t<br/>
need the attention.  I was actually told this one day.  Maybe that is<br/>
when I started thinking more about homeschooling?  For me, my early<br/>
school years were fairly pleasant.  I liked school, until I got older,<br/>
for the most part, always did well, and was usually the teachers pet.  I<br/>
excelled at school, I suppose you could say.   I just didn&#39;t want to<br/>
decide to homeschool, in case my son might like school.<br/>
	Then, when my son started 1st grade, I think our little unschooled<br/>
family went into some sort of culture shock, hehee!  Seriously, he was 7<br/>
yrs.old, and suddenly he was gone for 7+hours a day, 5 days a week.  Boy<br/>
did this take some major adjusting.  I was very depressed at first, but<br/>
I adjusted.  My kids adjusted too, they grew apart, and started<br/>
quarelling more.  My son would be very tired, and irritable upon coming<br/>
home.  He was always so tired, and didn&#39;t like school much at all.  He<br/>
said they always had to sit still on the floor for long periods of time,<br/>
and listen a lot, and he was bored.  One thing my son rarely was back<br/>
then(at home) was bored.  So, I went once and observed.  50<br/>
students(ages 6-8), 2 teachers.  It was enough to convince me I had to<br/>
make a decision.  I basicly let my son make the decision, and he<br/>
decided, rather easily(more easily than I), he wanted to come home.  He<br/>
also got picked on on the playground by some older kids, and teased<br/>
about having curly hair(after which he always wanted it cut very short,<br/>
and became overly self-conscious, I feel).  So, even that short<br/>
experiencs with the ps, had some negative consequences.  I am just so<br/>
grateful that I decided to pull him out of ps as soon as I did, and had<br/>
the courage to go through with it, because I was very unsure at first.  <br/>
	Since that time(year and 1/2), I have thought about using curiculum,<br/>
but in my indecision, have wound up unschooling.  I love the philosophy<br/>
of child led natural learning, and really it&#39;s so simple because it&#39;s<br/>
what I&#39;ve been doing all along.  I just need to learn to trust myself,<br/>
my own intuition, and this process more.  The support of this group will<br/>
surely help immensley.<br/>
	I have a 2 questions:  (1)do I have to report my 8 year old to the<br/>
school district?  I have not yet filled out any paperwork or notified<br/>
them that he is homeschooling.  When am I supposed to do this?<br/>
(2)I&#39;ve heard some about testing.  Is it required and when and how?  How<br/>
do you do testing and unschooling too?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing all your stories.  This is great!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Hi all, <br/>
  I too have a question about the testing. My oldest daughter is 5, at what <br/>
age<br/>
 do we start testing? Also, if I am not mistaken, the test(s) is supposed to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tanya, in Washington, you do not need to register your child until the year <br/>
they are 8.  What this means is that if your child&#39;s birthday is in November, <br/>
you do not need to do ANYTHING until the FOLLOWING year, when she would be 8 <br/>
at the school entry deadline.  Does that make sense?  Another way.  If your <br/>
dd turned 5 in November, she would not have attended school that year, as the <br/>
cutoff date is Sept. 18th(?).  So, apply that rule to when she turns 8, and <br/>
that is when you need to register, and test.<br/>
