&gt; Hundred dollar bills would be educational. We&#39;ve never seen one before :-)<br/>

I saw a 100 euro bill at the Karstadt Dept. Store over the Christmas<br/>
shopping season.  The clerk thought I was going to try to steal it, I think.<br/>
My son and I started poking each other and whispering and craning our necks<br/>
to see it!  (You have to understand that all the euro bills are different<br/>
colors, so the attraction was that I&#39;ve never seen a bill of that color.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, it was funny, the look the sales clerk gave us.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

look very carefully at the bills when I go down to the States.<br/>
