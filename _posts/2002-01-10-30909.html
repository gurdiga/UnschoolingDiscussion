<div id="ygrps-yiv-99676191">&lt;&lt;Maybe I&#39;m naive.....there must be more reasons why the judge found in<br/>
favor of the father&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was a foster parent for several years and spent quite a bit of time in the<br/>
family courts.  I sat through 3 parental right termination....and yes, I<br/>
have to say you are naive.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to do anything illegal to lose custody of your children,<br/>
particularly in a divorce situation.  Somebody is going to win and that<br/>
somebody is the person who is able to provide the lifestyle that seems the<br/>
best TO THE JUDGE.  A woman in Texas lost custody of her child to the<br/>
father, whom she had never married.  She had to put the infant in daycare<br/>
while she worked but the father had the paternal grandmother to look after<br/>
the child while he worked.<br/>
