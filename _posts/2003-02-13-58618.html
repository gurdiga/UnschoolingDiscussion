Yes, the older ones do seem jealous, although I think there is more to<br/>
it. They were brainwashed and it will take time to be unbrainwashed. We<br/>
now have a foster child who goes to a specialized school. I am not sure<br/>
why because we haven&#39;t been told much yet. He has been here for a week.<br/>
He is on heavy med&#39;s though for ADHD and to sleep at night. He keeps<br/>
busy every moment with projects; painting, building with anything he can<br/>
find, playing nintendo, reading, etc. He has himself on his own<br/>
schedule. I&#39;m here for backup:) He&#39;s 10. Our youngest is 12 going on 20.<br/>
So far so good. My kids really like the new Sims Park and learning about<br/>
economy, animals, etc. that way.They stay on for hours. I haven&#39;t been<br/>
on it yet. We also talk constantly about what ever interests us so they<br/>
learn a lot that way, too. We just finished a project on Two Towers that<br/>
they liked. We are very unstructured here. We eat when we feel like it.<br/>
My eldest daughter and her fiance who don&#39;t live with us are on Weight<br/>
Watchers. Since my 12 year old goes there every week just about, he has<br/>
been learning about that. He is going with the flow of not eating tons<br/>
of candy. It has been his choice. My 14 year old has decided to quit<br/>
therapy after 4 years. It is a little scary yet, he seems much more<br/>
balanced lately. He has taken up cigerette smoking:( He got a ticket<br/>
last week and the police called me at 9:30 at night to tell me they had<br/>
talked to him. It is illegal to smoke in public under 18 here. I learned<br/>
something. I was glad he wasn&#39;t calling to tell me my son was arrested<br/>
or worse. I was still snippy with the officer which I do and then punish<br/>
myself for. I wish I wasn&#39;t such a b-word sometimes. At least it was one<br/>
of the nicer officers. My son has bipolar and has done a great job<br/>
learning how to express himself in healthier ways. Alot of this happened<br/>
after he was out of public school. He has friends that smoke cigerettes<br/>
and stay away from the stronger stuff. I admit I am not full of joy to<br/>
be going through the teen years again for the umteenth time. I am not<br/>
super strict. I figure that they know a lot already and this is their<br/>
experience. We talk all the time about everything except what they don&#39;t<br/>
want to tell me:) My 14 year old tells me he feels guilty and telling me<br/>
stuff relieves his anxiety. I usually let them know they aren&#39;t really<br/>
doing anything others haven&#39;t done and guide them to be safe. Anyone who<br/>
has kids knows kids do what they feel like doing, especially teens. I am<br/>
happy he feels he can talk to me or one of his siblings. We are a close<br/>
family. I am proud of that. We are givers and not so good at receiving.<br/>
We are working on that now. I&#39;ve rambled on long enough:) Michele  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745095476">Hello my name is Lynda - I have been reading your emails for two days now; you all are a prolific bunch, so I feel I have a general idea of the direction of this Yahoo Loop.  I fear to post an idea, but I will try, and brace myself for the replies!  My idea is in regard to unlimited access to television, computer, gameboy, etc.  If we let our kids have unlimited access to &quot;junk&quot; tv, etc, don&#39;t your think they will take advantage of it in the same way they will take advantage of &quot;junk&quot; food, if we stocked our pantry full of an unlimited supply.  Isn&#39;t it our responsibility to offer a healthy assortment of food from which to choose, including some not-so-healthy treats, to enjoy on occasion, and in the same way, isn&#39;t it our responsibility to provide a healthy assortment of entertainment options.  I realize this is hard to do in the case of television, unless you plain just don&#39;t own one, but with games and cd-roms, we do have more ability to offer a nice array of options, in a limited supply, so that outdoor play and face-to-face social interaction (more organic human activities), are the more available option, and I would strongly argue, the healthier option.  I do believe there is much value in the electronic world, and pleasure in the enjoyment of delicious treats, but is there a way to offer these, without the attractive packaging and addictive quality that they offer to both adults and children, the quality that marketers work hard to improve in order to persuade us to buy more!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m ducking my head waiting for the comments to fly! - Lynda (who thought she was &quot;unschooling&quot; until she stumbled on this group!)<br/>

  This is scary stuff. My kids would be scared to leave home, not knowing <br/>
  what would be gone next.  After reading more on their web site I would <br/>
  guess the tv and computer.<br/>
<br/>
  I like this line:<br/>
  &gt;  If you are looking for support and information on home and/or <br/>
  &gt; un-schooling based on a Waldorf Inspired Curriculum, you have come to the <br/>
  &gt; right place!<br/>
<br/>
  And the official answers are given by a Ph.D. My father has a Ph.D. in <br/>
  education and spent just about zip-all time interacting with his kids.<br/>

  This is horrible! I can&#39;t conceive of lying to Brianna like this! This is a<br/>
  total lack of respect for the child, the child&#39;s likes, possessions. I would<br/>
  never do this. Brianna is a collector; rocks, small statues, feathers,<br/>
  shells. She likes to collect, she chooses to collect.those are her choices.<br/>
  Her room is a mess, (my home isn&#39;t to far behind!) That will pass. Once in a<br/>
  while I&#39;ll say something..when she &#39;finishes&#39; a project and everything is on<br/>
  my table or kitchen floor and there&#39;s a danger to the puppy, but to trick,<br/>
  lie, steal, collude..that&#39;s just wrong! There are so many issues here. I don<br/>
  &#39;t want Brianna leaving people in my home w/o my permission or when no one<br/>
  is home, I don&#39;t want Brianna deciding what I should have or get rid of; I<br/>
  don&#39;t want Brianna to lie to me. I don&#39;t want her to trick me. How can I do<br/>
  these things to her? How is she to feel secure?<br/>
  How can a parent do those things w/o the child feeling betrayed?  All of<br/>
  those plastic toys? Pass them on. For the future? Talk to your child about<br/>
  choices. I have w/ Brianna. She still wants some things that I roll my eyes<br/>
  (figuratively) over, but her choices now are much better. Tickets to plays,<br/>
  (We live near some wonderful theaters), clothes, healthy, well chosen toys<br/>
  for her puppy..and she&#39;s now the proud owner of a savings bond.<br/>
  I&#39;ve only lied to Brianna once, it had to do w/ something her bio mom did.<br/>
  I would never steal from her. This is criminal.<br/>

  &gt;&gt;There are actually How -To&#39;s on getting rid of a child&#39;s entire collection<br/>
  &gt;&gt;of toys, here:<br/>

<br/>
  Oh yuck! They not only recommend taking away all the kids toys, they<br/>
  advocate lying about it and saying the &quot;magical toy fairy&quot; came<br/>
  and did it. Here&#39;s a quote: &quot;The secret is, if &quot;you&quot; are not<br/>
  responsible...and a fairy (or elf, or gnome) did it...then it MUST be best!&quot;<br/>
  But a<br/>
  fairy DID NOT really do it and the parent IS responsible. Where does that<br/>
  leave us?<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;I&#39;d been looking into the Waldorf approach...seems to come with the AP<br/>
  territory...but this sort of thing is enough to turn me off<br/>
  completely. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Back in my former schooling-mom life, I sent my son to a Waldorf inspired<br/>
  school. It was very dogmatic and controlling. There was<br/>
  only one right way for children to &quot;progress&quot; and they apparently had the<br/>
  answer. It was NOT a nurturing time for us.<br/>

  &gt; This destructive behavior usually happens so fast, we<br/>
  &gt; cant stop it.  To &quot;channel&quot; thier aggression elsewhere would require CONSTANT<br/>
  &gt; supervision., which seems unreasonable for kids thier age..( and really,<br/>
  &gt; impossible) <br/>
<br/>
  How does talking to them about it go? Does it end up having the general feel<br/>
  of you telling them what they need to do to do better and them agreeing?<br/>
<br/>
  Or are you there as their partner? To help them learn to be more aware of<br/>
  their emotions and the build up of their emotions before they get to the<br/>
  explosion stage. You think it&#39;s fast. They probably even think it&#39;s fast.<br/>
  But there is a build up that they could be helped to be more aware of.<br/>
<br/>
  I think you need to forget their ages and what is reasonable or not<br/>
  reasonable. They are where they are and you need to be there to help them<br/>
  get where they&#39;d like to be.<br/>
<br/>
  Ask them if they want help in not destroying game controllers. How they<br/>
  respond is going to depend on your motivations. If you are focused on<br/>
  stopping them from destroying things, they&#39;re going to sense that your help<br/>
  is about controlling them. If you are focused on helping them gain skills<br/>
  that they&#39;d like to have, they&#39;ll be more open.<br/>
<br/>
  You could suggest that they not play unless you can be there with them.<br/>
  (That won&#39;t work if they are sensing you want to control them. They might<br/>
  think it&#39;s a good idea if they sense that you want to help them.)<br/>
<br/>
  There&#39;s other suggestions you could make but it will all dependon whether<br/>
  they see you as their partner or the protector of the stuff in the house. It<br/>
  might also take some extra work to convince them that you really do want to<br/>
  help them if your interactions with them have always been about changing<br/>
  their behavior to behavior you think is acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; But, I also know that if I dont encourage and sometimes even<br/>
  &gt; insist that he go somewhere or try something new ,he would never know that he<br/>
  &gt; DOES like it.   Is that wrong????<br/>
<br/>
  Well I think that a good outcome to something &quot;bad&quot; doesn&#39;t justify doing<br/>
  something bad. Lots of kids have terrible times in school and end up<br/>
  &quot;successful&quot; and thankful that they were pushed. But it doesn&#39;t justify<br/>
  pushing in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
  What does he want you to do? Ask him now while he isn&#39;t faced with going<br/>
  somewhere he doesn&#39;t want to go. Does he want you to make him go? And ask<br/>
  him again after you&#39;ve tried out his answer a couple of times. Ask him to<br/>
  think about how he feels now that you pushing or not pushing. What does he<br/>
  want you to do? It would help him be more aware of his feelings.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; I dont &quot;make&quot; him try new foods.. but I<br/>
  &gt; have paid him to taste something.. Lots of times he finds  out that he likes<br/>
  &gt; it!!!!<br/>
<br/>
  What about the times he doesn&#39;t like it? Again, ask him what he&#39;d like you<br/>
  to do. Point out the times he has really liked something after being made to<br/>
  eat it and the times he hasn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
  And if he doesn&#39;t want to be urged, what difference does it make? If you had<br/>
  very limited tastes and people kept urging you to eat stuff you didn&#39;t want<br/>
  to, wouldn&#39;t it be annoying?<br/>

  Subject: Re: school/unschooling<br/>
<br/>
  I feel like I am pulled in many directions lately. I have an 18 year old<br/>
  who has been feeling very depressed. She is on med&#39;s and refuses<br/>
  counseling. She is determined to get a highschool diploma. Nothing else<br/>
  that has been offered suits her. I am supporting her wishes and watching<br/>
  her struggle. I went in to her 504 meeting with her, that turned out to<br/>
  not be a 504 meeting because the principle thought it wasn&#39;t one. This<br/>
  principle told my daughter that there weren&#39;t any funds to help her -<br/>
  that she (principle) has to go beg for money for the school. They always<br/>
  say that by the way... We do have a strong ally who is assisting my<br/>
  daughter. Without this person - who is constantly overstressed, having<br/>
  migranes, running to the nurses office, and calling her support people -<br/>
  my daughter would not be getting a diploma from public school. The<br/>
  principle mentioned something like &quot;we can&#39;t have kids making up their<br/>
  own schooling.&quot; My daughter had a suggestion on how she could best be<br/>
  taught. I really &quot;couldn&#39;t hold it&quot; any longer and uttered &quot;heaven<br/>
  forbid a child would have something to do with deciding how they are<br/>
  educated.&quot; It didn&#39;t go over very well.<br/>
  I feel very frustrated because this daughter has been feeling suicidal -<br/>
  school knows and she is getting help - has been on a 504 for depression<br/>
  for atleast 3 years, etc. School is about money, I know...<br/>
  I wanted to come home and bathe in unschooling territory. For some<br/>
  reason the older kids now 20 and 21 keep pestering me about &quot;teaching.&quot;<br/>
  I feel obligated to explain to them once again what is happening as far<br/>
  as unteaching their younger siblings goes. My 21 year old was very upset<br/>
  about thinking the 12 year old should be writing essays to prepare for<br/>
  college. I get so frustrated I don&#39;t know what to say. I told her that<br/>
  if the 12 year old decides to go to a school/college he will be ready<br/>
  because it will be his choice, he will be prepared, etc. She then<br/>
  screamed at me. She said I don&#39;t know how to talk to people. I mentioned<br/>
  the fact that he is 12 and has a while to decide about any form of<br/>
  higher education he chooses. She said that is not enough structure. I<br/>
  tried to explain that she is correct. There isn&#39;t a lot of structure in<br/>
  the way I am unteaching. I write down everything they do - which is alot<br/>
  - every day. I personally think they are learning more than ever<br/>
  especially my now 15 year old who has been labeled dyslexic and bipolar.<br/>
  They are right though, it doesn&#39;t look anything like public school and I<br/>
  for one am very grateful for that. Michele<br/>

  &gt; Maybe you are right, but I wonder if part of the problem for you is what he<br/>
  &gt; is interested in.  What if his only interest was working complicated<br/>
  &gt; mathematical problems?  Wouldn&#39;t that be something to brag about!  Or what<br/>
  &gt; if he did nothing but program computers?  Somehow it is harder to tell the<br/>
  &gt; world, (and friends, family, and neighbors) that &quot;all my kid does is play<br/>
  &gt; nintendo&quot;!  There is pressure from those outside the homeschooling world to<br/>
  &gt; &quot;prove&quot; that homeschooling produces kids who excel in all things academic,<br/>
  &gt; not in all things considered by most to be recreational.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
<br/>
  Nah, I dont have any predisposed ideas about what is &quot;good&quot; or valuable to be <br/>
  interested in.   To me, ANYTHING he wants to do is valuable.  And no less <br/>
  valuable than &#39;academic&quot; stuff.   Yes, the world in general, and even our <br/>
  close family and friends puts much more value on &quot;book learning&quot;   But as for <br/>
  me, it makes no difference if hes does math problems or finishes a level on <br/>
  Mario.. or pumps up the tires on his bike.   What matters most to me is a <br/>
  smile on his face, and a sense of worth and accomplishment in his heart.    <br/>

<br/>
  Yes.. the concern is not over how many or what interests he has.  The concern <br/>
  comes over the fact that even the stuff he likes and enjoys causes him <br/>
  frustration and emotional upset.  I talked about the video game stuff.. But <br/>
  really, it could be anything.. He loves biking, but often he will come in <br/>
  angry, crying, upset, because his bike is not cooperating the way he wants it <br/>
  to. .Maybe some piece of accessory is not working just right. maybe the wind <br/>
  is blowing too hard.. maybe no one wants to ride with him . He loves jumping <br/>
  on the trampoline,, but he could come in with similar complaints.  It seems <br/>
  he is only satisfied and happy with even his limited interests for a very <br/>
  short time.  Then he gets upset and angry or sad.. he feels like &quot;nothing <br/>
  works for him&quot;  , like everyone and everything is against him.      And, the <br/>
  other concern is that how can he know what might interest him, what he may <br/>
  really excel at or enjoy if he won&#39;t try new things.. Im not talking about <br/>
  overload here.. Im talking ANY new thing.. heck, maybe trying something new <br/>
  once a month, or even every 2 months    But as of now, he resists anything <br/>
  &quot;new&quot;<br/>

  Subject: Foster kids/adopted kids<br/>
<br/>
  Hi Sheila,<br/>
<br/>
  My 5 kids were adopted, 3 through the foster system.  We had a total of 14<br/>
  foster kids so the behaviors you describe are very familiar to me.  I think<br/>
  it is important to remember that often these kids are spending so much<br/>
  energy protecting themselves from perceived threats (like &quot;I love you and<br/>
  want you to be part of the family&quot;) that they don&#39;t have the energy left to<br/>
  learn new behaviors.  I believe that stressing kids to &quot;improve&quot; before they<br/>
  feel safe and have developed a bond is a recipe for disaster.<br/>
<br/>
  Marsie came to us at 1 day of age.  Her bio mother is retarded and<br/>
  psychotic.  Her bio father is &quot;slow&quot; and abusive.  2 siblings had lived in<br/>
  our home previously, both were retarded with attachment problems and one was<br/>
  psychotic.  At ages 2 and 3, these kids had to be placed in special<br/>
  therapeutic residences because they were so destructive and out of control<br/>
  (sleeping only a couple of hours per night, attacking other kids without any<br/>
  known provocation, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
  At 5 months of age, Marsie still couldn&#39;t turn over and just seemed somewhat<br/>
  &quot;behind&quot;.  I took her to an &quot;occupational&quot; therapist who gave me the best<br/>
  advice I&#39;ve ever been given.  She said &quot;Don&#39;t worry about dirt or germs with<br/>
  this kid.  Let her do what she needs to do to learn.&quot;  So Marsie grew older<br/>
  with ready access to anything she wanted, even the kitchen garbage (we just<br/>
  washed her good when she was through), even fire ants (she can pick them up<br/>
  and let them crawl all over her and never gets bit).  Marsie is now 6yo and<br/>
  just smart as a whip.  She is learning to read off and on and has been<br/>
  playing with multiplication stuff the last couple of days.  She does have a<br/>
  temper but rarely completely loses it.<br/>
<br/>
  She is so far past where her siblings were at her age.  I truly believe it<br/>
  is because she felt safe and accepted.  So as a foster mom, adoptive mom,<br/>
  unschooling mom and Master&#39;s level therapist, I would advise that you work<br/>
  only on your relationship with your son.  Do nothing, absolutely nothing,<br/>
  that will damage it.<br/>

  I&#39;ve had the most wonderful and overwhelming requests for my <br/>
  article...It&#39;s amazing to me how many people can relate to <br/>
  unschooling a unique, quirky, out-of-sync child.  Thanks to all who <br/>
  have written and asked to read it.<br/>
<br/>
  I wanted to write here again to let those interested know that I have <br/>
  been asked to speak on this topic (unschooling *out-of-sync* <br/>
  children) at three conferences:  in Connecticut, Maryland and South <br/>
  Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
  If you are in or near any of those states, and are interested in <br/>
  conference details, let me know.<br/>
<br/>
  I invest my computer time at the message boards at unschooling.com.  <br/>
  So if anyone would like to pop over there and read the special needs <br/>
  folders, we always have wonderful conversations going on.  Right now <br/>
  there&#39;s a great conversation in progress about Indigo Children.  <br/>
<br/>

  You might want to consider still meeting her.  I know people who like a lot<br/>
  of the Waldorf ideas but don&#39;t go in for their rigidity.  My daughter, for<br/>
  instance, is attracted to all the nature, art, and music stuff that they do.<br/>
  She also doesn&#39;t care much for the plastic stuff, but she would never take<br/>
  the stuff away from her kids.  She buys wooden toys and simple dolls for<br/>
  them but also things that they want that she doesn&#39;t much like.  (And she&#39;s<br/>
  the one who was still nursing her daughter at age 6.)<br/>

  Are these older kids half-siblings?  Did they go to school?  I&#39;m wondering<br/>
  if they&#39;re really jealous without realizing it.  They could be covering up<br/>
  their jealousy by focusing on their &quot;concerns&quot;.  You can tell them why<br/>
  you&#39;re doing things the way you are with the younger ones, but you may just<br/>
  have to pull the, &quot;I&#39;m the parent.  When you have kids you can raise them<br/>
  the way you think is best.  I wish I had unschooled you as well, but we<br/>
  can&#39;t change the past.&quot;  Or something along those lines.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
    I&#39;ve had the most wonderful and overwhelming requests for my <br/>
    article...It&#39;s amazing to me how many people can relate to <br/>
    unschooling a unique, quirky, out-of-sync child.  Thanks to all who <br/>
    have written and asked to read it.<br/>
<br/>
    I wanted to write here again to let those interested know that I have <br/>
    been asked to speak on this topic (unschooling *out-of-sync* <br/>
    children) at three conferences:  in Connecticut, Maryland and South <br/>
    Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
    If you are in or near any of those states, and are interested in <br/>
    conference details, let me know.<br/>

<br/>
  Teresa ~ how do you handle it when he feels like everything is <br/>
  against him?<br/>
<br/>
  What does your son do that makes him SHINE?  <br/>
<br/>
  A difficult and challenging aspect of children like this is the fact <br/>
  that the reality of their body&#39;s capabilities does not match the <br/>
  vision they hold in their mind.<br/>
<br/>
  The KEY is to direct them to those things that they CAN do and do <br/>
  well.  Those things that make them SHINE.  <br/>
<br/>
  In Carol Stock Kranowitz&#39;s book *The Out of Sync Child,* she says <br/>
  something like, &quot;Even the best-loved child in the world will feel <br/>
  unloved.&quot;  I know what she&#39;s talking about.  It was my life.  It&#39;s my <br/>
  son&#39;s life.  <br/>
<br/>
  Yes, they feel like many things are against them.  How you handle <br/>
  that is key.<br/>
<br/>
  It is imperative that you don&#39;t just write it off.  It is important <br/>
  to acknowledge how he feels.  How frustrated he is.  And, yes, how <br/>
  difficult life can be for him at times.<br/>
<br/>
  But then it&#39;s important to move on.  Don&#39;t dwell on the negative.  Go <br/>
  on to something where he can SHINE.<br/>
<br/>
  WHen my son is totally frustrated, I&#39;ll hug him and say, &quot;It&#39;s a <br/>
  difficult job to be Jake, isn&#39;t it?&quot;  He&#39;ll collapse in my arms and <br/>
  cry.  And then I&#39;ll let him know that I think he&#39;s wonderful, and I <br/>
  think he&#39;s doing a great job at being Jake.<br/>
<br/>
  And then we move on to those things that make him Jake.  We&#39;ll talk <br/>
  about his comic strips that he draws, or his monsters.  We&#39;ll talk <br/>
  about his video games, or the book he&#39;s reading.  Or we&#39;ll curl up <br/>
  together and read a book or watch a movie.<br/>
<br/>
  There is a lot of stress and anxiety in these children&#39;s lives.  Do <br/>
  what you can to move away from that and move towards the Joy and the <br/>
  Love and the Strengths.<br/>
<br/>
  There is no need to push anything new.  Let him stay where he is <br/>
  comfortable.  Go to his world, in his place of comfort.  Meet him <br/>
  there and get to know him there.  Let him enlighten your world and <br/>
  let him know that his unique perspective on life enlightens your own <br/>
  life.<br/>
<br/>
  Time helps, also.  My son would try to draw a couple of years ago, <br/>
  and get so frustrated and cry.  A friend of mine told me the same <br/>
  story about her 5 year old son.  He would draw something and take it <br/>
  to her and angrily say, &quot;Would you just throw this away because I <br/>
  HATE IT!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s what I said:  their vision does not match their physical <br/>
  capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
  My son stopped drawing and began working with clay (Sculpey).  He was <br/>
  AMAZING with it.  He made Pokemon after Pokemon with it, and they <br/>
  were WONDERFUL.<br/>
<br/>
  This helped his confidence, and his motor skills.  After awhile, he <br/>
  tried drawing again, and was better at it.  So he kept drawing.  Now <br/>
  he&#39;s a wonderful artist and creates his own comic strips.<br/>
<br/>
  I think most parents approach a frustrated child in the wrong <br/>
  manner.  They always try to fix what went wrong.  That&#39;s not what the <br/>
  child wants ~ especially these perfectionist children.  They want to <br/>
  fix it themselves.  And right now, they just want to be frustrated <br/>
  with it.<br/>
<br/>
  They are learning.  They are learning about the world.  They are <br/>
  learning about themselves.  They are learning how to handle having <br/>
  video games in their home.  They are learning how to handle <br/>
  frustration and challenge.<br/>
<br/>
  How YOU handle it and approach it will be their *teacher.*  <br/>
<br/>

  Subject: Re: helping with household stuff<br/>
<br/>
  Kathy - I like the way this kind of stuff is talked about in the &quot;How <br/>
  to Talk so Kids will Listen and....&quot; books.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not much of a housekeeper (understatement of the year) and my kids <br/>
  don&#39;t get asked to do much, since I&#39;m not doing much either. But - if <br/>
  they are walking through the living room to get clean laundry off the <br/>
  floor, wearing a wet towel from their shower, and if they drop the wet <br/>
  towel on the couch and put on their clean clothes right there - I will <br/>
  say: &quot;Wet towel?&quot; and they&#39;ll pick it up and hang it up. If they don&#39;t <br/>
  - if they get distracted - I&#39;ll just do it.<br/>
<br/>
  I often say: &quot;Hey Roxana - can you find time in the next hour or so to <br/>
  do a couple of things to help get the house under control?&quot; She&#39;ll <br/>
  decided what needs doing (she&#39;s 15) or she&#39;ll ask me what I want and <br/>
  I&#39;ll say: &quot;Well - unload the dishwasher and fold that laundry on the <br/>
  living room floor and put it on each person&#39;s bed.&quot; Often I&#39;ll ask her <br/>
  to declutter some specific area of the house - like clear off and put <br/>
  away all the stuff on the dining room table. Sometimes she is too <br/>
  involved in what she&#39;s doing and she forgets. Gee, kind of like ME!!! <br/>
  So I remind her and she does it -- or if she&#39;s run out of time, then I <br/>
  just let it go.<br/>
<br/>
  She&#39;s the most cooperative of my three kids, in this regard. That&#39;s <br/>
  because she LIKES things to be more orderly - I&#39;m sure she&#39;d help even <br/>
  more if I was into it &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;d LOVE to have a clean orderly house - but I can&#39;t drag myself away <br/>
  from talking to all of YOU to get around to making that happen!!!<br/>

  &gt;   Thankyou Joyce for your reply. I respect your<br/>
  &gt; opinion very much. I have not read the archives yet<br/>
  &gt; and hope I am not repeating specific topics too much.<br/>
  &gt; I dont know how you have arrived at the opinion that<br/>
  &gt; the chores belong to the parents. It cant be this<br/>
  &gt; black and white. If this is so, then when does that<br/>
  &gt; change? Sandra mentioned something about being too<br/>
  &gt; tired to cook one eve. and that her kids were old<br/>
  &gt; enough to make something for themselves anyway. Maybe<br/>
  &gt; the distinction is that we dont have a right to demand<br/>
  &gt; anything of anyone. But cant we expect a little help.<br/>
  &gt; Taking some responsibility for oneself? &quot;Expect&quot; may<br/>
  &gt; even be too harsh a word. But cant we explain that<br/>
  &gt; (for example, if this were the case) mom or dad have<br/>
  &gt; xy &z going on and that we cant do all that needs to<br/>
  &gt; be done and still keep our sweet and happy tones<br/>
  &gt; going? OK, I guess the answer is that we have to be<br/>
  &gt; willing to deal with a NO from them. And then they may<br/>
  &gt; have to deal with certain consequences like their<br/>
  &gt; laundry doesnt get done or whatever. Am I on the right<br/>
  &gt; track?<br/>
  &gt;  I dont really understand how a child in a family is<br/>
  &gt; not already on the team just by virtue of the fact<br/>
  &gt; that he/she is a part of the family. ( I believe that<br/>
  &gt; we all choose very purposefully where to<br/>
  &gt; incarnate--not that &quot;they did not ask to be born and<br/>
  &gt; therfore they are not responsible&quot;--like they are<br/>
  &gt; innocent bystanders or something). Are you saying that<br/>
  &gt; if they want to eat in their room and dont want to<br/>
  &gt; pick up the fallen food and then there is a big ant<br/>
  &gt; infestation that they dont need to take responsibility<br/>
  &gt; for that? I dont think thats what you mean. I did read<br/>
  &gt; some of Sandras stuff in the archives related to this.<br/>
  &gt; That it all depends on whats going on in the family<br/>
  &gt; etc, who has the time and energy to help clean up the<br/>
  &gt; mess. We dont want to trash our kids for the sake of<br/>
  &gt; an ant infestation. I love that point she made. I&#39;m<br/>
  &gt; just talking about teaching responsibility for ones<br/>
  &gt; actions. I dont think its a given that the parents are<br/>
  &gt; responsible for everything. Probably nature will take<br/>
  &gt; its course in these instances, over time, as it does<br/>
  &gt; everwhere and the kids will strive to be responsible<br/>
  &gt; -&quot;because that is their nature&quot;.<br/>
  &gt;&gt; Anyway, thanks.<br/>

  If you e-mail me, I&#39;ll send you the info as soon as I have it.<br/>
<br/>
  The important thing to remember about unschooling math is that it&#39;s <br/>
  not doing nothing.  Sometimes it&#39;s thinking out loud, talking out <br/>
  loud, figuring out answsers yourself out loud.  It&#39;s conversations <br/>
  about patterns, numbers.  It&#39;s doing puzzles, computer games, <br/>
  blocks.  It&#39;s weighing produce at the grocery store and calculating <br/>
  the cost.  It&#39;s saving for something you love, figuring tax, also.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ll always remember when my son came to me and told me he had thirty-<br/>
  some dollars and some cents.  I went into his room and looked at his <br/>
  bed...he had piles of coins all over it.  I never sat down with him <br/>
  and told him the value of the coins.  He learned from using them.  He <br/>
  learned from gumball machines (well, they&#39;re not gumballs anymore, <br/>
  and they&#39;re not a penny anymore either!)!  He learned from using.  <br/>
  From living.  And he poured out his bank and counted all his coins <br/>
  because he wanted to know if he had enough money for something he <br/>
  wanted to buy. <br/>
<br/>
  Think of unschooling math in those terms, and compare that in your <br/>
  mind to schooling math.  Which would REALLY inspire true learning in <br/>
  your child?  Sitting down to a worksheet with numbers?  Or real life <br/>
  situations where the child has a need and desire to find an <br/>
  answer...usually associated with something joyful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-698999304">Hi Lynda,<br/>
<br/>
Comments interspersed:<br/>
  My idea is in regard to unlimited access to television, computer, gameboy, etc.  If we let our kids have unlimited access to &quot;junk&quot; tv, etc, don&#39;t your think they will take advantage of it in the same way they will take advantage of &quot;junk&quot; food, if we stocked our pantry full of an unlimited supply.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  Are you sure that if you had your pantry stocked with junk food but never made an issue out of it being &quot;junk&quot; that that is what they would choose to eat?<br/>
<br/>
  We have cable and HBO.  I don&#39;t limit what my kids watch or when.  They&#39;ve seen it all, right down to Howard Stern (ok, I do strongly recommend that they change the channel then :o), but ususlaly because a younger sibling is nearby or even becuase *I&#39;m* nearby and I can&#39;t stand that guy).<br/>
<br/>
  As for junk food, I have stopped limiting the junk food, but our budget dictates that we buy the healthy stuff first because we can&#39;t really afford to stock equal amounts of both junk and healthy stuff.<br/>
<br/>
  I buy junk, but when its gone, its gone.  I just don&#39;t have the money to replace it all week and the kids know that. But I will give them a bit of money here and there and they go to the store and buy their own.<br/>
<br/>
  Just the other night to my surprise, my 7 year old and I went out to dinner at Hoss&#39;s.  They have that great dessert bar, doncha know!  Well, when it came time for dessert, she got a tiny little ice cream cone and told me she just wouldn&#39;t be able to eat more than that.<br/>
<br/>
  That surprised me because I would have gorged myself on it if it had been me :o).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;Isn&#39;t it our responsibility to offer a healthy assortment of food from which to choose, including some not-so-healthy treats, to enjoy on occasion, and in the same way, isn&#39;t it our responsibility to provide a healthy assortment of entertainment options.  I realize this is hard to do in the case of television,&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I think its our responsibility to provide an assortment, *including* healthy stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
  When it comes to TV and entertainment, we really don&#39;t know what kinds of things are going through our childrens&#39; minds as they play them or watch shows. They could be making connections that we hadn&#39;t even thought about.<br/>

If you&#39;ve only rad for two days you&#39;ve missed all the discussion about how <br/>
many families here don&#39;t limit those things and kids don&#39;t &quot;take advantage&quot; <br/>
(a concept that can&#39;t even really apply in the absence of limits).<br/>
<br/>
We always have something sweet here, whether candy or ice cream or homemade <br/>
cookies or SOMETHING.   Right now, there&#39;s half a tray of brownies (REALLY <br/>
GOOD ONES) and I&#39;m about the only one eating any.  But there were two trays <br/>
Sunday, half a tray was eaten while they were hot, and a few others between <br/>
then and now.   We have ice cream bars and popsicles which have been here <br/>
over a week.  Some have been eaten.  All will be eaten, but nobody&#39;s in a <br/>
hurry, because it&#39;s not unusual for them to be there.  They&#39;ll be there <br/>
later.   We have M&Ms.  Most of the peanut ones were eaten Sunday by <br/>
jigsaw-puzzle-working teens, but there are still 1/4 of what we had.  More <br/>
than half of the plain ones are left.  They&#39;re in a see-through plastic <br/>
containter right on the counter.  Kids can have as many as they want.  &quot;As <br/>
many as they want&quot; is not very many, because they ONLY eat them when they <br/>
actually, really would rather eat them than not.  <br/>
<br/>
Kids who get candy only occasionally will tend to eat it quickly and <br/>
thoroughly.  Kids who are used to it being there have no urgency and no <br/>
feeling of having wanted and waited and finally obtained.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If we let our kids have unlimited access to &quot;junk&quot; tv, etc, don&#39;t your <br/>
think ...-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t &quot;think&quot; anything about it except that I have kids who are 16, 14 and <br/>
11 and you would be amazed at them turning TVs and games off to do other <br/>
things, and with them having lived their whole lives with access to candy and <br/>
sweets, and asking for fruit and cheese and pasta when we go to the store.   <br/>
<br/>
What SEEMS would happen, what people THINK would happen, and what many of our <br/>
parents SWORE would happen does not actually happen when the measurements and <br/>
restrictions and availability and shaming and warnings are just sweetly and <br/>

I&#39;m curious about how you came to think someone is NOT advocating having a <br/>
healthy assortment of food NOT to enjoy on occasion, but to have every single <br/>

to &quot;provide a healthy assortment of entertainment options&quot;?<br/>
