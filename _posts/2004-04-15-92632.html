<div id="ygrps-yiv-287443932">Hi all, <br/>
I just have to say hi to everyone. I&#39;ve been off-line since Nov. We <br/>
have moved from San Diego to Michigan and I our computer was hooked <br/>
back up today, and this was the first place I had to come to. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Our lives have completley changed in the past few months, Jason has <br/>
started school full time, I&#39;m working for the first time in 8 years, <br/>
we have a small house with a backyard for the boys, a great <br/>
neighborhood with lots of kids, and we are expecting a new addition <br/>
to our family. Our lives are crazy, but wonderful. <br/>
<br/>
I have soooooo much catching up to do, but I just had to say hi to <br/>
everyone.<br/>
<br/>
~Rebecca</div>
