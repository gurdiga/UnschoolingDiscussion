<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322961522">Hi Shelly,  You just tell them that it is not required and only a suggested procedure.  Don&#39;t let &#39;em bully you!!!  You can talk to CURE as well...the woman I spoke to was very helpful.  I was never bothered and then I got a letter one day asking for my letter of intent.  I informed them very politely that I appreciated their interest (HA!) but, as they knew this was not required and that I didn&#39;t require any of their services...I did not see this changeing in the future...If it did I would let them know.  You get the idea.  Hope this helps.  In Ct some people follow suggested guidelines and others don&#39;t.<br/>
Peace<br/>
Linda<br/>

&gt; Hi Linda,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I didnt know that we didnt have to do the portfolio reviews. I honestly<br/>
&gt; figured it was a lottery thing as I have heard from others in my town that<br/>
&gt; they have never had to do a portfolio. I figured I had to do one because I<br/>
&gt; made such a big stink when I pulled my kids out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will go check out CHEA&#39;s site I remember seeing something in a newletter<br/>
&gt; but I didnt understand how you get around it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Blessings Shelly<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can (a) not file Notice of Intent (b) politely decline the <br/>
portfolio review when requested if you did already file NOI (since <br/>
on the NOI indicates that you will have a review) - you <br/>
simply &quot;changed your mind&quot; in the interim after having read the LAWS.<br/>

Another good site for CT legal stuff is NHELD.com</div>
