Dover has lots of inexpensive paper dolls, coloring books, classics, paper<br/>
models, etc. (most under $5). We carry some in our catalog and special order<br/>
others. If you order directly from Dover during December expect a delay.<br/>
Over the next couple of weeks they are installing new &quot;Y2K compatible<br/>
software&quot; and aren&#39;t processing orders (talk about waiting until the last<br/>
minute!)<br/>
<br/>
Write and ask for a copy of their catalog of juvenile titles. I believe they<br/>
also have a catalog of all their titles arranged alphabetically. They have<br/>
many other catalogs arranged by subject, such as the juvenile catalog, and<br/>
these are nice because they show pictures of the books (their complete<br/>
catalog is text only).<br/>
<br/>
In my catalog, I saw these:<br/>
<br/>
Russian Imperial Costume Paper Dolls $4.95<br/>
Anastasia from Russia Sticker Paper Doll (smaller format) $1<br/>
<br/>
There may be other titles too.<br/>
