<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842559684">The parents were divorced but the mother was a dr. She chose to be with the<br/>
children rather than work so they lived in their car or with relatives<br/>
according to the boy, he and his two sisters. He says they have an apartment<br/>
now though. He has been accepted to Bob Jones Univesity. Sounds like he has<br/>
turned out to be a great kid inspite of his seemingly unsettled life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-421698728">O.K., am I the odd man out here or does anyone else have a problem with the<br/>
mother being a doctor and choosing to be a SAHM which put them in the<br/>
position of being homeless?  Or was the article I read about her not<br/>
correct?  Does anyone else know??  I mean, if it came to the difference with<br/>
the kidlets of a roof over their heads or working, then I&#39;d find some sort<br/>
of graveyard shift work to keep a roof.<br/>

  <br/>
That is an interesting question!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she thought it was better for her kids to live in a car with their<br/>
mother than to be latchkey kids because as a doctor she couldn&#39;t find a<br/>
job unless she was willing to work 50+ hours per week plus be on call and<br/>
never see her kids?  Or for some reason didn&#39;t want to leave her kids<br/>
home alone at night and didn&#39;t have anyone she trusted enough to stay<br/>
with them?<br/>

Unless the father is dead or in jail, why wasn&#39;t he making sure his<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-724628211">Sorry, all doctors don&#39;t work 50+ hours a week, nor do all doctors work<br/>
on-call.  Clinic doctors are 9 to 5&#39;ers and don&#39;t do on-calls or weekends.<br/>
ER docs work shifts and can work as few or as many as they want.  Insurance<br/>
companies are constantly hiring docs to do reviews, paperwork from 9 to 5.<br/>
There are docs that do insurance exams for policies.  There are docs working<br/>
for the state that do workers comp exams.  There are docs working for the<br/>
feds that do disability exams.  There are many, many options for doctors<br/>
that the rest of the folks earning a living don&#39;t have.  In fact, they can<br/>
make as much working one day a week as some folks make working 5 days a<br/>
week.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I don&#39;t consider 17 year old kids to exactly fall into the latch key<br/>
and needing mommy home every minute of the day category.<br/>
<br/>
And I believe that in one of the interviews she stated that she choose to be<br/>
a SAHM which is why I wondered by someone with all those qualifications and<br/>
all those options to work anywhere, at any hours they choose and for lots of<br/>
$$$ would choose to be homeless.<br/>
