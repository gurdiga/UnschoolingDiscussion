&quot;the whole issue of &quot;coloring&quot; really amuses me.  My boyz HATE to color&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is one of my pet peeves as well.  My second child (who went to ps) was <br/>
quite the artist when he was younger - may be still, but doesn&#39;t do much <br/>
with it now - but when he was in 6th grade and even some of the younger <br/>
grades, whenever he did an assignment and drew a picture he got a lower <br/>
grade because he just used pencil or pen and ink and basically refused to <br/>
add color to his pictures.<br/>
<br/>
I finally went to his art teacher and explained his situation and she looked <br/>
at his work and said he did such a good job with shading, etc. that he <br/>
didn&#39;t have to add color - duh!  You can buy pictures like his and people <br/>
don&#39;t expect the artists to add color - why do teachers think it&#39;s <br/>
important???  Everyone sees things differently and coloring is not an art <br/>
form for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
The more I remember about ps with the older kids the happier I am I pulled <br/>
my youngest.<br/>
