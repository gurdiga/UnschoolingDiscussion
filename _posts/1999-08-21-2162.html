<div id="ygrps-yiv-870895368">I also want to add that school is sometimes a lifesaver for children. These<br/>
children come from stressed families with a multitude of problems, of<br/>
course, but school is the only safe place, the only place they get a meal,<br/>
and the teacher is the only consistant person in thier lives. Not all<br/>
parents are responsible and loving and the schools can help children in<br/>
need.<br/>
<br/>
Another instance is with children with handicaps (mental, physical,<br/>
multiple, etc.). School gives these parents a much needed break and access<br/>
to resources that would otherwise be difficult to find.<br/>
<br/>
I do know kids who love school and thrive in the environment. And I know<br/>
parents who should not home/unschool. It is about choices, not proving our<br/>
choice is better for everyone, just better for us.<br/>

&gt; regarding emac&#39;s question on your 10yr old, we have a 10yr old daughter too.<br/>
&gt; your question made me wonder if you knew her motivation for wanting to go?  i<br/>
&gt; try to keep the discussion open, but focus on the reasons-- like you<br/>
&gt; mentioned, curiosity--feeling left out, whatever.  my daughter and i joke<br/>
&gt; about having a field trip to school, but actually that would not be a bad<br/>
&gt; idea!  if you have a friend her age who attends a private school, they would<br/>
&gt; probably allow something, even if it was just a partial day.  or see about<br/>
&gt; sitting in on a class together with her.  they would probably allow it if<br/>
&gt; they thought you were considering attending.  opening up the discussion with<br/>
&gt; my daughter occasionally about how she might feel odd not knowing what school<br/>
&gt; is really like and empathizing with her curiousity may be all it takes to<br/>
&gt; move off the issue!  dont we sometimes say things just to bring up an idea,<br/>
&gt; not to neccesarily take action on it?  maybe she would like an<br/>
&gt; email/homeschool penpal!  or other ways to make her feel connected to our<br/>
&gt; cultural subgroup :)!<br/>

&lt;&lt; i think your daughter learned the truth for her self. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Which was my point :-) albeit put rather badly.<br/>
<br/>
I always said I&#39;d let her go if she wanted to.  Which isn&#39;t to say I wasn&#39;t <br/>
nervous. I was worried that the praise of school and being around all the <br/>
other kids would blind her to the subtle damage that schools can do.  <br/>
Fortunately my trust paid off and she was able to see the bad parts and weigh <br/>
them against the good parts and eventually come to a decision all on her own.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;d be very uncomfortable telling my daughter my opinion of the <br/>
damage schools do and then leaving her to face all her friends who go to <br/>
school.  How could she reconcile what I was saying with what her friends were <br/>
saying about school and with how they behaved?  (They&#39;re still young so they <br/>
still rather like school.)<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess I&#39;d suggest letting your (emac&#39;s) daughter go.  It&#39;s empowering <br/>
for her to be able to make such a huge decision for herself.  I think you can <br/>
trust the dullness of meaningless homework, forced changing of subjects each <br/>
hour, the lack of choice in what to study, the attitudes of peers, the <br/>
isolation by age group to overwhelm the attraction of being with so many <br/>
other kids.  I&#39;d watch for the subtle indoctrination of believing learning is <br/>
for grades, and that peer opinions out weigh her own opinions and devaluing <br/>
of family opinions.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m ashamed to say that I don&#39;t even try to reason with these people <br/>
anymore.....they have no confidence in their own abilities...they have no <br/>
confidence in their children&#39;s abilities...and when I (used to) talk about <br/>
unschooling, they looked at me like I was crazy.  I KNOW that by discussing <br/>
this I might &quot;convert&quot; someone, but how long do you have to try?<br/>

learning will tell the story best.  there needn&#39;t be any pressure to <br/>
&quot;evangelize&quot; people to home/unschooling...  <br/>
i, too, sometimes share the feeling that we could/should be doing more to let <br/>
people know that there are wonderful alternatives to their misery, but i <br/>
remind myself that i cannot change them til they are fed up with their <br/>
situation/ ready for change.  then they will be asking... each of us sharing <br/>
with others who are interested and drawn to our style will share in the most <br/>
natural way.  people are more impressed with our actions than our words, <br/>
right?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-840037011">regarding emac&#39;s question on your 10yr old, we have a 10yr old daughter too.  <br/>
your question made me wonder if you knew her motivation for wanting to go?  i <br/>
try to keep the discussion open, but focus on the reasons-- like you <br/>
mentioned, curiosity--feeling left out, whatever.  my daughter and i joke <br/>
about having a field trip to school, but actually that would not be a bad <br/>
idea!  if you have a friend her age who attends a private school, they would <br/>
probably allow something, even if it was just a partial day.  or see about <br/>
sitting in on a class together with her.  they would probably allow it if <br/>
they thought you were considering attending.  opening up the discussion with <br/>
my daughter occasionally about how she might feel odd not knowing what school <br/>
is really like and empathizing with her curiousity may be all it takes to <br/>
move off the issue!  dont we sometimes say things just to bring up an idea, <br/>
not to neccesarily take action on it?  maybe she would like an <br/>
email/homeschool penpal!  or other ways to make her feel connected to our <br/>
cultural subgroup :)!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710461937">Thanks for the replies.It has given me something to think about. Our school year starts in February and I&#39;ve told my daughter she will have to wait until then. Although she is not going on about it, she will refer to &quot;when I go back to school...&quot;.I like the idea that she may &quot;find&quot; other homeschoolers via the online community. She enjoys writing . There seems to be enormous pressure to conform to the &#39;school&#39; model.Up until now I haven&#39;t really taken it on board , but lately I have felt that friends and family that encouraged me to take the step in the first place have now done an about turn. I feel as if I&#39;m not doing my job well enough in their eyes. It&#39;s something I&#39;m working through and have really appreciated this online support.</div>

&lt;&lt; I also want to add that school is sometimes a lifesaver for children. These<br/>
 children come from stressed families with a multitude of problems, of<br/>
 course, but school is the only safe place, the only place they get a meal,<br/>
 and the teacher is the only consistant person in thier lives. Not all<br/>
 parents are responsible and loving and the schools can help children in<br/>
 need. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can &quot;ditto&quot; this from experience.  I was one of these children.  I thrived <br/>
in school -- okay not in the sense that we all hope our children thrive in <br/>
unschooling.  But it was the very best thing offerred in my situation.  I <br/>
went through multiple marriages with each of my parents, and had parents who <br/>
placed their own drug and alcohol abuse above the love and care of their <br/>
children (Don&#39;t even get me started on the undertow of co-dependent tides <br/>
which nearly carried us all out to sea!).  <br/>
<br/>
For me, school was my constant.  School was where I felt loved, special, <br/>
important.  I could be anyone and do anything.  But, I must also admit, that <br/>
I feel I had very good teachers.  At least the not-so-good ones have been <br/>
blocked out over the years!  I had teachers whom I knew I could go to with <br/>
anything -- even if it had nothing to do with school.  They were mentors.  <br/>
They were friends.  In many instances, they were parents.  I do not feel that <br/>
my parents could have done a better job by homeschooling me.  They were too <br/>
selfish and immature at the time -- and very young.  But, at the same time, I <br/>
do not hesitate to believe that I can do a better job for my daughter.  I <br/>
believe it is all relative.  You must look at the whole situation and <br/>
determine what is best for the children.  For me, it definitely would not <br/>
have been homeschooling -- unless it had been done by someone other than my <br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
Now, there&#39;s a thought -- I wonder, have any of you unschooled or are any of <br/>
you unschooling any children who are not your own?  How did it come about?  <br/>
Would you do it again?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-221353990">It is important for me (son of a school teacher) to remember that school is not<br/>
prison for all kids......well it is...... but for some kids that equals a safer,<br/>
happier place than home.... a sorry state of affairs but true nonetheless.  I also<br/>
remember that there was the occasional teacher who treated children with respect<br/>
and caring not just authoritarian bullying ( the rule in my experience).  I have<br/>
known very compassionate individuals who are school teachers.  Their presence like<br/>
kind-hearted guards in prison can make the place bearable when it might otherwise<br/>
be the death of some people.   It doesn&#39;t excuse the institutionalized brutality<br/>
and cruelty of the system as a whole but it does give it a more human face.<br/>
