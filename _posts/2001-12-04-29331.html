<div id="ygrps-yiv-935701005">&lt;&lt;maybe we need to find some fun poems&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Limericks, perhaps?<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite childhood memories is writing letters back and forth with<br/>
my grandmother.  We did everything in limerick form.  It was so much fun.<br/>

<br/>
Limericks are a good possibility.......That reminded me how much fun we had<br/>
last spring helping her 12yo friend with homework.  The assignment was to<br/>
write haiku.....the friend did the writing and oldest dd came up with quite<br/>
a few ideas.<br/>
Susan......the unschooling Mom to whom most of the neighborhood children<br/>
come for assistance with &#39;school&#39; projects!<br/>
