<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>16 Dec 2002, at 12:15pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787191803">This is interesting.  I just had a discussion with my14 year old son.<br/>
<br/>
He came in at 2am one night.  He *did* call me around 10pm to let me know where he was and I had asked him if he was going to stay overnight or if he was going to come home (it was right across the street).  He said he woudl call me back but he didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t very worried.  I knew where he was.  I would just have liked to know what he was going to do.<br/>
<br/>
When he came in at 2am he was worried he&#39;d be in trouble.  I told him he&#39;s not in trouble, but we are going to have to work on some kind of agreement. Since I like to go to bed, I&#39;d like to hear from him with a decision by a certain time.<br/>
<br/>
I got to thinking &quot;what is wrong with me?&quot; LOL since I wasn&#39;t upset about it.   I know other parents would have a FIT for no other reason than its 2am.  <br/>
<br/>
I figure, whenever they leave my direct sight, they are doing whatever they want.  I can&#39;t control them.  I can only offer my advice and experience and hope they take it.   <br/>
<br/>
Anything that can happen at night can happen during the day too.  THinking kids are safe just because they are home by a certain time is naieve.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...we all sleep LATE here.  So, 2am, is like 9pm to most people.  Its all relative in my opinion.<br/>

more &quot;meaness&quot; goes on after midnight.. Maybe call a police officer and ask <br/>
them.   I dont have a curfew for my son because he doesnt want to be out that <br/>

night.<br/>

<br/>
Quote me statistics please, worthy ones.  If more people are out and about in <br/>
the daytime, then there are probably more crimes going on then, by virtue of <br/>
the law of averages.<br/>
Perhaps more theft goes on in the cover of night, as does more drinking. That <br/>
does not suddenly make the world a less safe place than it is in the daytime. <br/>
Statistically speaking, there are far more car wrecks during the day.<br/>
Just because someone is out after midnight, does not mean they are anywhere <br/>
in the vicinity of bars, nor on the road.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476457879">I leave work at 3am.  I work in a Trauma ICU.  Yes, the bars close at 2am, but by 3, there is almost NOBODY on the roads.  There are accidents after then, but not many, and there are just as many taht just dozed off as there are that are drunk.<br/>
<br/>
I can also tell you that when I worked in the ER, the slowest times were from 11pm to about 3am, and the closer to 3 it got, the slower it was. A few times I worked till 7am, and it was just as slow then.<br/>
<br/>
I MUCH prefer driving home at 3am to 11pm for that reason alone.  Maybe the drunks are passed out somewhere by then.<br/>

<br/>
Well I can&#39;t agree with that at all. Maybe it has something to do with where <br/>
you live. Not sure. I just know it doesn&#39;t hold water here. I have quite a <br/>
few friends who are police officers in the area. My cousin is one of them. <br/>
My husband is also a private investigator and very familiar with being out <br/>
and about late at night. Can&#39;t see what happens as being anything to do with <br/>
what time it is. Now maybe in what particular location you are in, but time, <br/>
as far as I see it has nothing to do with trouble.<br/>

<br/>
I have to go with Ren on this one.  I grew up in a law enforcement family<br/>
and dh is in the fire department so we most always have the scanner on.  The<br/>
&quot;busy&quot; times for law enforcement and emergency services is from 3 to 6 in<br/>
the afternoon (after school is out and before parents get home from work)<br/>
and about 8 to 10 (Dad has had time to tie one on and light into Mom).  I<br/>
also think it is very important to remember that if you take out the violent<br/>
crimes committed within families and between two criminals, the statistics<br/>
go WAY down.<br/>
