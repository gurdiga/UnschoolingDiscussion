<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421379716">Hi all!  I just have a quick thought to add to this thread.  My second<br/>
daughter&#39;s birthday is at the end of December, and as we aren&#39;t Christian,<br/>
I&#39;d prefer not to celebrate Christmas, but it&#39;s unavoidable without claiming<br/>
another religion, (I&#39;m veering towards Paganism, it makes sense to celebrate<br/>
the planet we live on than some &#39;higher&#39; being or beings I don&#39;t believe in,<br/>
but anyway...)  So we TRY to make Christmas lower key, the family<br/>
get-together, and make the birthdays more special for the children, after<br/>
all, it&#39;s THEIR day.  This is specifically because of A&#39;s birthday, but<br/>
also, I feel hypocritical &#39;doing&#39; Christmas when I don&#39;t believe the Bible.<br/>

&gt; Hi all!  I just have a quick thought to add to this thread.  My second<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; daughter&#39;s birthday is at the end of December, and as we aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; Christian,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d prefer not to celebrate Christmas, but it&#39;s unavoidable without<br/>
&gt; claiming<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are other alternatives.  As Quakers, as a religious matter we<br/>
don&#39;t celebrate any holidays (or, more accurately, all days are holidays<br/>
as they hold equal promise for revealing the divine to us); as a<br/>
cultural matter, we are free to do as we choose.  We are very conscious,<br/>
however, of how important Christmas is to the people around us, and we<br/>
try hard to honor that.  For several years now, my wife has taken my<br/>
daughter (a violinist) to the local hospital on Christmas Day where she<br/>
(daughter) goes from room to room playing carols for kids who can&#39;t get<br/>
home for Christmas and their families.  My younger one (a pianist) goes<br/>
to the local nursing home to play.Prior to holiday, they usually set up<br/>
shop outside the local supermarket and play and collect money for the<br/>
local homeless shelter at which we all volunteer.  The day after<br/>
Christmas we have a family tradition of heading to Seattle to a<br/>
Unitarian church which has the largest Handel&#39;s Messiah Sing-and-Play-In<br/>
in western Washington.  (when we lived in coastal California, the day<br/>
after Christmas was a day to go visit the elephant seals, and celebrate<br/>
the natural world around us.)<br/>
<br/>
 We also celebrate Chanukah -- but with the militarist story removed --<br/>
rather as a celebration of light in the darkness, hope in hard times. We<br/>
do it up with lights, potato pancakes, and the whole bit.  We also<br/>
celebrate Diwali -- the Hindu festival of lights -- commemorating the<br/>
victory of good over evil.  My kids developed a puppet show to go with<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
The point is that lack of strong religious belief in your case, or<br/>
objection to adult myths foisted upon children in mine, has to take away<br/>
from the opportunity of celebrating who we are as a family, or as part<br/>
of a larger community.  There is so much to celebrate!<br/>
