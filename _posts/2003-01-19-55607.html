&lt;&lt; It has also been said that possibly it&#39;s not the sugar itself, but the <br/>
food <br/>
 it comes from that can cause a change. Like sugar from corn wouldn&#39;t bother <br/>
 a child but sugar from sugar beets would. Therefore it&#39;s not really the <br/>
 sugar itself but the food it came from. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My oldest has a food sensitivity to cane products......doesn&#39;t have much of a <br/>
problem anymore, but it can cause his immune system to get sluggish and if he <br/>
eats too much dairy and sugar he gets stuffy.<br/>
So it could be more related to the persons allergies/food sensitivities.....<br/>

Well....actually.....they all get converted to glucose, this is true.<br/>
BUT, Honey has some trace minerals that sugar doesn&#39;t contain because it&#39;s <br/>
over processed (raw sugar would still contain the trace minerals).<br/>
Also, the spikes in insulin vary from sugar to sugar and how much in one dose <br/>
you get.<br/>

  I have a son who is truly reactive to sugar- eczema, aggressive behavior,weepiness out of his ordinary way and of course as some others have seen, higher energy. I have handled the higher energy but have a harder time with the aggressive beh. as he really has his self esteem impacted because it is often beyond his control to moderate his behavior. He is seven and over the years we have seen that honey has a less drastic impact on his body so this becomes more of a choice.<br/>
  I have really struggled with the food restriction choice because I do see the boomerang affect on them wanting everything. My dilema has been the reactions that everyone of my children experience. Their allergic reactions vary such as ear infections and vomiting from milk. They monitor themselves easily. Eczema they are more likely to indulge. I did not like to see the food issue problems that restricting creates for them so I have been working to balance the amount of discomfort I go thru when they eat sugar, wheat, and food colring which are the worst culprits with their need to eat freely. They are aware of my concerns and my need for not always having to do doctors, naturopaths or homeopathy to aid their weak immune systems and now we are starting to find a mutual balance. Our next challenge is that two for sure have thyroid malfunctions and we are working with the naturopath ,after years of knowing something was off, to finally find a treatment. This means my 2 kids are being asked to limit their carb intake as it really stresses an already stressed adrenal and thyriod system.The challenge is to do this without disrespecting and depriving anyone to the point of shame or emotional damage.<br/>
  So I guess my real point is that their are many circumstances that motivate us to makee our choices in life<br/>

<br/>
I likes the way you think Deb!!<br/>
And I&#39;m glad you mentioned the pasta, because ANY simple carb will <br/>
get turned to glucose and can often have the same effect as other <br/>
sugars.<br/>
I used to be very strict about our diets...another place I had to let <br/>
go of control (man I had some issues!!).<br/>
I&#39;ve seen my children go from hoarding any candy they got and NEVER <br/>
sharing, to becoming very generous well balanced individuals. <br/>
I don&#39;t say no at the store anymore.<br/>
I still fill my house with healthy options and amazingly enough, they <br/>
will ask for brocolli or carrots as often as candy or ice cream.<br/>
<br/>
I got over the sugar/healthy foods issue by realizing that <br/>
mental/emotional health was FAR more important than diet.<br/>
My children&#39;s happiness level will affect their health and futures <br/>
MUCH more intensely than how much sugar they get as children!<br/>
And they are learning how to be in touch with their own bodies and <br/>
what makes them feel better.<br/>
That can&#39;t happen if a parent is controlling the diet.<br/>
I think control of a childs diet is a huge factor in eating disorders <br/>
later on....or at least food hang ups.<br/>
I don&#39;t want them to have those issues, now or later. So they choose.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t educate them on food/nutrition, I do. But <br/>
I&#39;d hate another persons diet convictions to be forced on ME, why <br/>
would I force my personal convictions on them?</div>

wanted so he&#39;s eating them. I&#39;m so grateful to have learned to let the food <br/>
issue go with my kids - that is, it&#39;s not an issue - because I had such <br/>
screwed up eating for almost as long as I can remember. By watching them I <br/>
have learned to be less controlling of my own eating. It still amazes me to <br/>
see the variety they choose every day.<br/>
<br/>
My sister and her husband control their kids&#39; eating to some degree. When <br/>
we were visiting them at their cottage she was astounded that my son Eric <br/>
left a part of an Oreo on his plate. She said her kids would never have <br/>
done that. Well, Eric knows that if he wants a cookie later he will <br/>
probably get one, so when he is full, or has satisfied his Oreo desire, he <br/>
stops.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-176696501">It has helped me and my family with our hay fever and allergies. I do<br/>
it about 3 weeks before hay fever season:<br/>
<br/>
To help &quot;immunize&quot; yourself against pollen, eat 1 tablespoon of really<br/>
raw honey (locally produced if possible) with the addition of about<br/>
1/2 tablespoon of fresh bee pollen. With the bee pollen, start with a<br/>
few granules and gradually increase to the full dose. Eat foods high<br/>
in the full vitamin C complex such as sprouts, sauerkraut, raw milk<br/>
and fresh berries. Also, take a supplement with these components such<br/>
as Cataplex C or Collagen C from Standard Process, or acerola berries,<br/>
about 250 mg. three times a day,<br/>
<br/>
I remember that as a child, my allergies and hay fever was not as bad<br/>
as now and I think it has to do with the fact that my favorite lunch<br/>
was a peanut butter and honey sandwich. ;)<br/>

Yep. I try to always buy local honey. Raw of course.<br/>
It helps the body build up immunity to local pollens. If you can get local <br/>
bee pollen that is more intense, but you have to be careful because of that. <br/>
Take small amounts at first.<br/>
Any honey gathered within 50 miles of your home is optimal.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>yes!  we got some local honey that was unfiltered-- it had a small<br/>
amount of visible pollen granules and bits of wax in it.  these little<br/>
bits are actually quite yummy, and the honey is superb.   it is hard<br/>
to get honey like this, you need to ask a local beekeeper and they<br/>
will look at you like you&#39;re crazy, but it is the best.  <br/>
<br/>
the trick is that most honey that is labeled &quot;unpasturized&quot; is usually<br/>
still heated in order to be filtered.  completely unheated honey has<br/>
never been heated above the temperature that it is in the hive, and it<br/>
is full of enzymes, pollen, and beneficial yeasts.<br/>
