<div id="ygrps-yiv-984301331">Lots and lots of quippy comebacks being offered, so I&#39;ll jump in<br/>
with a somewhat different perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Neighbor troubles are the pits - especially if there are kids<br/>
involved.  I think you are wise to do as much as possible to<br/>
avoid making the problem any worse.  BUT you do need to do<br/>
something if it has gotten to the point you are this<br/>
uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
When I have a &quot;big&quot; conversation coming up, I practice.<br/>
<br/>
First, I identify my goal - is it to convert them to your<br/>
beliefs, to demonstrate that you are superior, to get them to<br/>
quit talking about it altogether, to get them to quit talking<br/>
about it in a way that relates to you and your family?<br/>
<br/>
Second, I look at why they are doing the thing that is<br/>
bothersome.  Here it can help to have a friend or spouse take<br/>
your position while you argue theirs - you may try out &quot;I want to<br/>
talk about God to you because I am a deluded, low-brow Baptist,&quot;<br/>
or &quot;I want to talk about God to you because so much of my life is<br/>
tied into the Church, I really don&#39;t have any other small talk&quot;<br/>
or &quot;I have the most precious gift of all time, it delights me so<br/>
much I want to share it with you as part of a friendship.&quot;  Which<br/>
of these or a myriad other possibilities rings truest to you as<br/>
you argue their point will tell you more about why they are<br/>
pushing religion than any &quot;just thinking&quot; about the why will.<br/>
<br/>
Third, I look for convergence between my goal and their<br/>
motivation - trying hard to remember that I may have inadequate<br/>
information or perception to be accurate about their goal and may<br/>
need to shift ground.<br/>
<br/>
Then practice making your pitch to a friend/spouse/maybe even a<br/>
kid, asking them to react as your neighbor would - then critique<br/>
how each step made each other feel.  I&#39;ve even done this on video<br/>
tape for clients who really had a very big pitch to make, but<br/>
just practice and de brief works wonders.<br/>
<br/>
Finally (almost) decide where and how to set your stage. If they<br/>
are perhaps simply following their peer group experience of<br/>
making friends by evangelizing, you might want to invite them<br/>
over for a small social/friendly thing as part of the setting -<br/>
say a watermelon cutting or something similarly low key.  If they<br/>
<br/>
Then (and this is the final step) make your pitch shortly after<br/>
they enquire about the state of your soul.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

&lt;&lt; or &quot;I have the most precious gift of all time, it delights me so<br/>

you argue their point will tell you more about why... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One thing about Baptists and Mormons, though.  It is their duty to try to <br/>
convert you.  They do it by having strong families and hoping you&#39;ll ask what <br/>
it is that makes their family so happy, so they can say &quot;I&#39;m glad you asked <br/>
that question!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But along with their duty comes a shut-off point.  Especially with  Mormons, <br/>
but somewhat with Baptists, if you reject the message they are no longer <br/>
under obligation to be your friend or impress you.  And in strictest <br/>
interpretation of that, they might feel the need to cut off communication as <br/>
you might then be a danger to their kids or families.  Or at best a waste of <br/>
their time.<br/>
<br/>
I realize there can be real, true friendships in which the people will pay no <br/>
mind to the technicalities of their obligations.  But *IF* the friendship is <br/>
based in any part on their proslytizing duties, beware of a &quot;Really, I&#39;m not <br/>
interested and will not GET interested&quot; speech.  <br/>
<br/>
If you want the friendship to last longer, decide whether it&#39;s worth keeping <br/>
the slightest, most formal/technical possibility open that you might consider <br/>
thinking about converting later on.  If you do, they can continue to set a <br/>
good example for you and invite you to church once in a while, and then you <br/>
can keep the friendship a long time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is very helpful, thank you.  I think their intentions are generally<br/>
good, although I also think they see us as potentially useful in several<br/>
ways.  The most difficult part for me is keeping my emotions in check and<br/>
remaining objective.  It amazes me that after 12 years this still feels so<br/>
raw.  I will have to keep reminding myself to breath.<br/>
