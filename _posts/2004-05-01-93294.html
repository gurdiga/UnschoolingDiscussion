<div id="ygrps-yiv-736119612">Angela, I know exactly how you feel. <br/>
<br/>
*It is so refreshing to be a part of something, where I don&#39;t <br/>
have to explain myself or my reasons for doing what I am doing.*<br/>
<br/>
 I posted my intro a few weeks ago (too soon as I didn&#39;t read the list <br/>
policies :) sorry).  I am also excited to find a place to discuss unschooling <br/>
without having to explain what it is.  I have tried to discuss it with a few close <br/>
friends at work who knew we started to homeschool last year and I feel so <br/>
overwhelmed when I try.  I feel like I am speaking a foreign language or trying to <br/>
described the practice of aliens from outer space.  But reading this list <br/>
definetly helps me put my feelings and thoughts into words.<br/>
<br/>
*I really want to get my husband on board, but he just does not &quot;get <br/>
it&quot; yet. I have tried explaining unschooling to him, but it seems <br/>
like we never finish a conversation.*<br/>
<br/>
I feel fortunate that my husband has supported my changing views about <br/>
schools, education, learning, etc.  He came with me to a David Albert talk in <br/>
Orlando in January and that helped to reassure him that interest led learning works. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208221254">Thanks for that. I did not intend to make it seem like my husband <br/>
does not support me, but I do feel like he needs to be a part of it, <br/>
and wish he could see and know what I have learned. When I try to <br/>
explain things to people, I feel like I have a million things to say <br/>
and there is only a small straw to get them out (my mouth), and it <br/>
all comes out like a jumbled up mess. I think it is hormones from <br/>
having my baby. Anyway, I am going to talk to him about the <br/>
Unschooling conference, as someone on here (sorry can&#39;t remember <br/>
names yet) told me about. I think that would be awesome! Hope to <br/>
talk to you again soon! <br/>

If you are in or near FL, you&#39;ll want to mark your calendar for Ren&#39;s <br/>
unschooling at the beach shindig sometime next year.<br/>

PS  It&#39;s *not* true that I unschool because I&#39;m too disorganized to use <br/>
curriculum. &lt;ggg&gt;</div>

It&#39;s not being discussed much because the press is now to get people to <br/>
Boston!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe October 2005, though, but BOSTON!  August 2004! (Peabody, for those <br/>
nearer who know the difference).</div>

<br/>
Mabye instead of words, let it unfold and let him learn it by seeing it all <br/>
around him.   <br/>
My husband wishes I knew as much as he knows about using tools, but I&#39;d <br/>
rather just ask him to do the hard tool-monkey jobs.  He doesn&#39;t know as much about <br/>
learning and the world of children as I do, but he&#39;s willing to trust me.  <br/>
And he knows he doesn&#39;t want to know that much.   One thing I know that he has <br/>
NO interest in knowing is the relative knowledge bases of other kids my kids <br/>
hang around with.  I know their family histories to some extent, and have met <br/>
their parents in most cases, and keep tabs on their romances in a casual way.   <br/>
Keith knows their names and whether they&#39;re athletic or not. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So don&#39;t spend too much energy being frustrated that your husband doesn&#39;t <br/>
understand it completely.  Spend more energy changing the house and yourself so <br/>
that it just starts blooming.<br/>
<br/>
Rose bushes look like dangerous crap, don&#39;t they?  When they sell them to <br/>
you, all pruned down to thorn-sticks?  But after a few years they&#39;re gorgeous.  <br/>
<br/>
When he sees some blooming roses (at a conference, or at your house in a year <br/>
or two) he&#39;ll calm down.<br/>
