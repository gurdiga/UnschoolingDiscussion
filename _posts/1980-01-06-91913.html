<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807122483">Hi there, I am<br/>
Suzan with a Z, wife to beloved husband Steve & happy mommy to my blessings;<br/>
&quot;sweet girl&quot; Cassia &#39;94, &quot;beany boy&quot; Benjamin &#39;97,  &quot;totkins&quot; Aaron 2K.<br/>
I usually lurk and read a lot, because I don&#39;t have much time to talk alot.<br/>
I live in North Las vegas, down a couple of miles from Elissa Wahl.  We are<br/>
in a couple of homeschool groups together.  One is Christain and the other<br/>
is Inclusive.  The people are just peolple.  We all have our quirks and<br/>
oddities.  Some of the not so &quot;christian&quot; people are nicer as people, but<br/>
it&#39;s more of a homeschooler thing than anything else, and the church that we<br/>
go to and is the sponsor of one of our groups is considdered by some people<br/>
to be oh so liberal. At least that&#39;s what I heard.<br/>
As for me I couldn&#39;t homeschool the way I do; lax, un, relaxed, delight<br/>
directed, whatever with out the support of God, my friends, and groups like<br/>
this.  No matter who you might think you are a blessing from, you are still<br/>
a blessing to me.<br/>
Come visit us in Sin City (Las Vegas) some time.<br/>
