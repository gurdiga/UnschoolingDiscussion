<div id="ygrps-yiv-974117324">Odds Bodkin is another storyteller worth checking out.  He is quite a<br/>
bit more animated that Jim Weiss...his voice isn&#39;t calm like Jim&#39;s...I<br/>
don&#39;t think he has much going-to-bed material out there. But listening<br/>
to him is very engrossing and fun.  He does all of his own voices with<br/>
the accompanyment of guitar.  He has some stories for the very young<br/>
set (Little Proto series- stories about dinosaurs) that my ds just<br/>
loves.  He does others for little kids too...there is one tape/cd of a<br/>
medley of fairy tales for the younger set (THe Three Little Pigs is<br/>
hiliarous), and one about stories of strong girls.<br/>
<br/>
There are more Bodkin tapes for the older set, including The Odyssey<br/>
and a few others...check the library or Fun Books  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://fun-books.com">http://fun-books.com</a></div>

Odds Bodkin was a favorite. Little Proto especially was listened to numerous<br/>
times. (There&#39;re are 2 sequels now.)<br/>
