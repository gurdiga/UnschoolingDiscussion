I do not dribble a basketball well.  I have tried and tried but I don&#39;t do<br/>
it well.  My guess would be that if you did some type of neuro mapping of me<br/>
dribbling and Michael Jordan, or even a kid on the local basketball team,<br/>
dribbling, our mapping would look considerably different.  Does that mean<br/>
that there is some neurological cause for my inability to dribble well?  Do<br/>
I have Dys-bounce-ia?  And if there is a core neurological difference, is<br/>
that a difference or a disability?  Where do we draw the line between normal<br/>
variation and anomaly?<br/>
<br/>

would tend to guess that reading ability, mathematics ability, etc. also<br/>
fall along a bell curve.  Is it possible that LD people are simply the<br/>
bottom end of the bell curve on that particular skill?  We don&#39;t say that<br/>
short people are Growing Disabled, or that poor dribblers are Bouncing<br/>
Disabled, why do we say poor readers are Learning Disabled?<br/>
<br/>
Is disability, something being &quot;wrong&quot; with you, determined by how much that<br/>
ability is favored or utilized by the society in which you live?  Were there<br/>
Learning Disabled people 500 years ago or simply people on the low end of<br/>
the bell curve, people for whom a skill was more difficult?  If the society<br/>
in which you live determines whether or not you are &quot;disabled&quot;, is the<br/>
diagnosis a reflection of you or of your society?  If it is a reflection of<br/>
your society, can it truly be considered a diagnosis at all?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078189326">May I ask you a question???<br/>
Why do you seem to believe that diagnosing a problem is bad?  You <br/>
seem to be saying that we should just accept ourselves and not try to <br/>
make improvements.  I can&#39;t believe that is what you really mean, but <br/>
that is how it sounds to me when you say that things like dyslexia <br/>
should just be left alone and the person will learn to deal with it <br/>
eventually.  But at what cost?  How much of that person&#39;s life will <br/>
be spent unhappy trying to learn to cope, when there are people who <br/>
can help find and address the problems?<br/>
And maybe that is part of the problem, Have you, maybe, lumped the <br/>
whole thing together into one issue - schools?  Just because the <br/>
schools misdiagnose, misuse valid diagnoses. over react to diagnoses, <br/>
etc.  should not mean that we have to completely abandon everything <br/>
that is available in the world of educational psychology. <br/>

You have a very clear and level headed way of looking at this issue. You have <br/>
definitely given me food for thought and things to ponder on. I really like <br/>
when that happens. It is really easy to give into other people&#39;s diagnosis&#39;s <br/>
and perceptions of who they think we are and how to fix that. There are lots <br/>
of those types of things that are fairly new and I suspect some day will be <br/>
looked back on as voodoo medicine maybe. It has happened all throughout our <br/>
history really. Anyway, just a thank you for giving me something to think on.<br/>
<br/>

Remember that every act is an act of self-definition.  Every thought<br/>
carries the energy of creation.  Every word is a declaration of what is true<br/>
for you. Look to see what you are doing today.  Is this how you choose to <br/>
define yourself? Look to see what you are thinking today.  Is this what you <br/>
wish to create? Look to see what you are saying today.  Is this what you <br/>
desire to be so? Each moment of your life is a holy moment, a moment of <br/>
creation<br/>

Well put!<br/>
<br/>
In an earlier post, I described how I didnt learn to tell time until I was<br/>
12, even though I was a straight-A student almost all the way through<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
I neglected to mention that I cant yo-yo; can only whistle in (not by<br/>
blowing out); learned to ride a bike at about the same age I learned to tell<br/>
time (even though my balance was great when I practiced judo); and (a great<br/>
failing in certain circles) never did learn to burp at will. And Ill be<br/>
darned if I ever did actually understand any of the Chemistry I aced in high<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm. Wonder what label that constellation of symptoms would get me these<br/>
days?<br/>
