<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also, Sandra, I recently received a brochure for a Waldorf Homeschool<br/>
&gt;Conference in Oct.  Have you ever attended this, and if so what did you<br/>
&gt;think?  When I began homeschooling it was partly because I wanted to send<br/>
&gt;the girls to a Waldorf school but couldn&#39;t afford it and there wasn&#39;t one<br/>
&gt;close enough.  Now that we&#39;ve been doing it awhile I&#39;ve moved away from<br/>
&gt;Waldorf and toward unschooling.  It did look like they had some interesting<br/>
&gt;and informative speakers and topics scheduled.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I attended the first Waldorf Homeschooling conference and presented at the<br/>
second.  I missed last year&#39;s due to recovering from a really difficult<br/>
birth.  This year&#39;s line up does look very interesting.  I am very surprised<br/>
to see Pat Montgomery lined up as a key note speaker, because her philosophy<br/>
of relaxed, child-led learning is in direct contrast to  the conservative<br/>
Waldorf approach of teacher as repository of knowledge and culture.  Agaf<br/>
Dancy heatedly refuted student initiated learning in the elementary years at<br/>
the first WE conference, claiming the young child is not old enough or wise<br/>
enough to know what is available for him to learn so he needs a teacher to<br/>
expose him to the world.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow,  I personally discovered Waldorf methods when my just a few years<br/>
ago when my oldest was five, and it was amazing to me that what I was doing<br/>
with my children resembled Waldorf immensely.  I wanted to do a very<br/>
holistic approach to life with my children, to keep them immersed in the<br/>
natural rhythms of nature, and show them as many crafts and arts as<br/>
possible.  This is one of the things Steiner had in mind, and when I read<br/>
his Kingdom of Childhood most of what he said reminded me of John Holt.<br/>
Steiner said he wanted the students to see shoemakers and every craft and<br/>
trade, and that the first Waldorf school was stunted by the teachers he had<br/>
at the time.<br/>
<br/>
What we do in our home resembles &quot;unschooling&quot; more than Waldorf in that we<br/>
do not resemble a Waldorf school; I considered getting Waldorf teacher<br/>
certification and really immersed myself in the reading for about a year<br/>
before deciding that the whole school set-up by necessity is limiting and<br/>
not representative of life and culture.  I felt that the curriculum of the<br/>
schools did not take into account the individuality of each student, and<br/>
also felt at odds over the cost of tuition in Waldorf schools.  Education<br/>
that is not available to all is not of value to the entire society at large.<br/>
<br/>
I strongly feel that all of the debate over homeschooling in the elementary<br/>
and secondary years is so misguided; we should all really be working for<br/>
universal higher education.  The world would be a vastly different place if<br/>
everyone could go to college/grad school and study and do what they want to<br/>
do, and contribute their God-given gifts towards a better world.<br/>
