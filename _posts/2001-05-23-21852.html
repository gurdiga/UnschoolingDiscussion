<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019803513">I have a question that may or may not have anything to do with the <br/>
unschooling viewpoint but here goes anyway ...<br/>
<br/>
Do you all have a list of chores that you expect your children to <br/>
do?  For instance, do you expect them to clean their room and do <br/>
their share of the work around the house ... even if it is just <br/>
taking the garbage down to the road or picking up their own gear and <br/>
not leave it for mom?<br/>
<br/>
The reason I ask this is because I have a friend that is seriously <br/>
interested in the idea of unschooling but has real concerns about how <br/>
it would impact the needs of the family unit.  Maybe I&#39;m not saying <br/>
this completely right ... does the loose or non-existant &quot;control&quot; of <br/>
the child&#39;s education STOP when it comes to their responsible <br/>
participation in the everyday running of the family household?<br/>
<br/>
Do you have consequences when they don&#39;t do their share of the <br/>
chores?  Do they have tv or stereo taken away?  Are these <br/>
consequences consistently enforced?<br/>
<br/>
If they are, then how does that go back to not enforcing consequences <br/>
if the child doesn&#39;t do anything &quot;constructive&quot; towards his or her <br/>
education during the week.  And I&#39;m sure constructive isn&#39;t exactly <br/>
the right word to use either ... that definition and labels issue <br/>
again ... but how do you deal with the issue of being permissive in <br/>
their education and not being or being too permissive in their <br/>
participation in the family&#39;s life?<br/>
<br/>
OK, I&#39;m done now ... &lt;sigh&gt; ... the questions were just flying at me <br/>
from a friend and I didn&#39;t have a ready answer for her since I <br/>
unschool with just one of my four children and can live like that.  <br/>
But, I know a bunch of unschoolers wouldn&#39;t agree that I was <br/>
unschooling since I&#39;m not doing it with all my kids.  Oh <br/>
raspberries ... I&#39;m sure someone out of the 500 or so members on this <br/>
list understanding what I mean.  I appreciate any constructive &lt;grin&gt; <br/>
feedback you can offer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re talking philosophy here, not experience, &#39;cause my kids are young. But <br/>
chores or housekeeping to keep the house livable are different from chores <br/>
&quot;cause they might as well learn now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One is part of life, and one is part of schooling.<br/>
