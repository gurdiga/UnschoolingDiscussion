<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171487378">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
My son has been receiving Highlites magazine (gift sub from my mom) but has<br/>
decided that he&#39;d rather get something like Puzzlemania - has anyone ever<br/>
heard of this as a subscription, and if so, do you have any links or a ph#<br/>
where I can get more info?<br/>
<br/>
Or do you have any other magazine suggestions for a 7yo boy?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Both published by Highlights -- I think-- at least Puzzlemania is.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Puzzlemania - has anyone ever<br/>
heard of this as a subscription, and if so, do you have any links or a ph#<br/>
where I can get more info?<br/>
<br/>
Or do you have any other magazine suggestions for a 7yo boy? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Games magazine has some stuff that&#39;s not too hard for seven, and if he saved <br/>
the back issues he could eventually get to all of it.<br/>
<br/>
I thought Puzzlemania was put out by Highlites (but I could be wrong--I only <br/>
get them at thrift stores &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
My favorite is World, by National Geographic, but my kids haven&#39;t warmed up <br/>
to it themselves.    I should just subscribe for me and leave it lying <br/>
around...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d just go to google.com and enter &quot;puzzlemania&quot; and &quot;subscription&quot; and if <br/>
that doesn&#39;t do you, try &quot;back issues.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

&quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439270429">Thanks everyone for your suggestions! I am emailing the link to Puzzlemania to my mom to look over - and if she doesn&#39;t decide to get it for my son, I may just order it myself! :-)<br/>
