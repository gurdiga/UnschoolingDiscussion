Hi Both my daughters have had the exact same problem (my eldest is now 10)<br/>
and we did the whole test-thing; blood tests, x-rays, ultrasounds. She would<br/>
wake up at night crying with the pain some times so I knew it wasn&#39;t &quot;just&quot;<br/>
an attention-getting thing (my Mother-in-law&#39;s take on it!!) Eventually,<br/>
they found that both girls had enlarged kidneys but this is supposedly an<br/>
asymptomatic condition . In other words, this shouldn&#39;t have been causing<br/>
the pain etc.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing ever was diagnosed and they both seem to have out grown it by about<br/>
9/10 years old. i have no idea what caused it but having done the gamut of<br/>
tests, eventually treated it as I would a headache ie. mild Pamol (ummmmm I<br/>
think US = Tylenol??) drink of water and rest. I know that sounds dumb but<br/>
nothing was ever diagnosed so that was the best I could do.<br/>
It was scary though and I am very glad that it just kind of ebbed away<br/>
within about a year. A friend suggested it was maybe connected to the<br/>
ovaries maturing etc. but I really couldn&#39;t say. Good luck!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633294801">Hi Sonia,<br/>
             We just went through a similar situation with our 7 year old<br/>
daughter. The doctor finally ordered a stomach x-ray (not an ultrasound) and<br/>
it showed that her intestinal tract was completly backed up with poop. This<br/>
came as a complete shock to me since I knew that she was going on a daily<br/>
basis.  The doc said she was probably going just enough to relieve herself,<br/>
but for whatever reason (too busy playing, etc.) she just wasn&#39;t going<br/>
enough to empty herself. We began her on a regiment of natural vegetable<br/>
laxative, very high fiber diet, and some behavior modification, which<br/>
included sitting on the toilet for 15 min. upon waking, after lunch and<br/>
before bed and asking her several times a day if she needed to go. This,<br/>
combined with the fact that she ended up catching a stomach bug and had a<br/>
week of diarreah (yuck) seems to have done the trick. I hope this helps.<br/>
Sorry for the long explanation. Good Luck.<br/>
Amy<br/>

&gt; I need some friendly parenting advice:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For about 6 months now my 7 year old daughter has complained of<br/>
&gt; non-descript cramps/tummy aches.  I am at my wit&#39;s end trying to figure<br/>
&gt; out the cause.  The doctor gave my daughter a general exam and ordered<br/>
&gt; routine tests and an ultrasound but nothing came up.  For a while I<br/>
&gt; wondered if she could suddenly be gluten or dairy sensitive and we tried<br/>
&gt; the appropriate diets with no success.  Still lots of cramps with no<br/>
&gt; real rhyme or reason, at all times of the day or night.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can anyone shed any light on this situation?<br/>

&gt; P.S. Further to all the discussion re: baby diets and nursing and<br/>
&gt; introduction to solids etc. our situation with our children has always<br/>

&gt; advanced age.  (So I am hoping this is not allergy-related!!!)<br/>

Yup... this was the exact same thing that was wrong with my DD a couple of <br/>
years ago. The doctor also wanted her to drink a cup of apple cider a day. <br/>
wiht diet change it worked itself out. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-253543919">I have a son that also has cramps like this.  One MD told me it is more than<br/>
likely a pocket of gas trapped in the upper small intestine. He even had a<br/>
name for it.  He said there was an area up under the left rib cage where the<br/>
intestine can rise upward, causing things not to flow well.  The reason<br/>
there is no logical pattern to the cramps is that it&#39;s dependent on what the<br/>
kids have eaten and when. Given daily fluctuations in eating time,<br/>
combinations of food, and activity, you can&#39;t nail it down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099515338">To Sonia,    <br/>
                       My family and I have been using homeopathy as our main <br/>
source of healing for over 10 years.  One thing I have learned is that most <br/>
of our physical symptoms begin as an emotion whether or not we are aware of <br/>
it.  I am suggesting you think about what was going on in your daughter&#39;s <br/>
life when she first started feeling the stomach pains.  This may help you <br/>
determine the cause and help her deal with it.  Good luck to you and your <br/>
daughter!     Jackie</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130626170">Have you tried acidopholous (I know, I know, I can&#39;t spell worth figs!). <br/>
Hubby has the tummy problem and has started taking it and no more cramps or<br/>
other related problems.  He has also taken up eating yogurt.  The theory<br/>
behind this was that his problems were caused by upsetting the normal<br/>
&quot;flora and fauna&quot; that reside in your innerds (anything can do this from<br/>
too much of a particular food to antibiotics to allergies) and yogurt and<br/>
acidopholous encourage the &quot;good&quot; bacteria and balance your system.  It&#39;s<br/>
just a thought and it worked for him.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a son that was born with colic.  Absolutely nothing helped<br/>
except taking him for rides in the car.  I was nursing him and everyone<br/>
said it was what I was eating, so I completely changed my diet (slowly<br/>
removing anything/everything that might be the cause) and that didn&#39;t help.<br/>
 Even LLL gave up on trying to figure something and advised trying the goat<br/>
milk routine.  This didn&#39;t help either.  When he reached about 3ish, I<br/>
started giving him the acidopholous and yogurt and that helped somewhat. <br/>
Anything was better!  We finally figured out that he needed to just pass<br/>
gas whenever he got the urge.  He had always held it in, politeness sake, I<br/>
guess, and once he started heading for the bathroom at the first sign of an<br/>
ache or cramp, it was &quot;cured.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019187781">Sonia,<br/>
Wow, I have read all the responses to your post.  How amazing all the <br/>
different things that cause the stomach problems.<br/>
Here is mine. When I was in first grade, not ever before, right after lunch I <br/>
would go out to play for 30 min. (back in the stone age schools used to let <br/>
kids do that) then back to the class for afternoon classes.  I would then get <br/>
horrible cramps and have to lay in the hall (not on the floor, there was a <br/>
little bed behind a screen).  This went on every afternoon for 3 or 4 days.  <br/>
Finally, the teacher from the next room (a real shrew) came by and told my <br/>
teacher that It sure was funny to her how I could go out and play before I <br/>
got sick.  She said some other mean stuff, all where I could hear.  I went <br/>
home and started crying and telling my mom. She went bananas, she was so mad <br/>
at what the teacher had said.  First, she took me to the dr. he did exam, <br/>
then made an appointment to have scratch tests done.  Turned out I was <br/>
allergic to the world!  Milk and dairy products, citrus (pretty major when <br/>
you live in Fla. and have grapefruit growing outside your bedroom window)! <br/>
Plus chocolate and nylon, that was just to begin with.  At any rate, what <br/>
happened was that until I was this age, 6 or 7 this didn&#39;t start to make <br/>
itself known.  Drs. back then did a lot of allergy testing.  Now days they <br/>
want to do other things, so, if your doctor didn&#39;t say anything about <br/>
allergies, maybe you should check it out.  I had these awful cramps all the <br/>
time.  Even after I took the shot series and stuff, I almost died because I <br/>
had these awful cramps for several days.  We thought it was from the <br/>
allergies, and didn&#39;t really do much about it, my appendix burst, and by the <br/>
time I got to the hospital, the dr told my mom I would have been dead in 30 <br/>
min if I had stayed at home.  this was on a Wednesday night and my parents <br/>
were going to prayer meeting.  They said if I wasn&#39;t better by the time they <br/>
got home they were taking me to the dr.  I started crying and said I want to <br/>
go now. When mom called the dr and told him the symptoms, he had the surgical <br/>
team and OR ready for emergency appendectomy, I ended up in the ICU 3 days, <br/>
never knew it, had a drain in cause the peritonitis had spread all over.<br/>
Geesh! sorry to be so long winded.  Point is, people don&#39;t really associate <br/>
cramps with allergies very often, so it is a possibility you might want to <br/>
suggest to your dr.<br/>
