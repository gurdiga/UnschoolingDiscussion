<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019397921"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Lets take a poll, how many of you use algebra in<br/>
&gt;your jobs????<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ummm, I think most people use algebra everyday.  Whether they know it or not may be another thing.  And whether it gets used in the formal way of writing equations or not may be another things.<br/>
<br/>
Everytime one thinks -- If I buy one 12 oz can of peaches for 1.00 or two 7 oz cans for $ .95, which is the better deal -- one is using algebra.  Everytime one tries to figure out how many yards of material it will take to make 3 costumes -- if one is for an adult and two are for children -- and the children are about 2/3 the size of the adult -- one is using algebra.  Everytime I figure if it takes me 20 minutes to get to the bakery and 15 minutes to get from the bakery to the dry cleaners  -- how long will it take me to do the entire trip -- one is using algebra.  When one adds in variable such as how much gas one has, how much money one has, how much time one has, and maybe how much patience one has &lt;g&gt;, one is living algebra.<br/>

<br/>
Please share these. <br/>
 I have not introduced myself as yet.  We are an unschooling family,<br/>
living in Canada.  We have three children, ages 13/f, almost 12/m, <br/>
and 7/f.  <br/>
Our son is forever challenging us.  Some of his friends have joined a<br/>
league for pool, grrr... I think there is another name for this, .. <br/>
ahhh!!!  billiards... and our son has decided that he wants to learn <br/>
physics, so that he will be better skilled at playing pool.   He must <br/>
learn a few more math facts, if he is to understand the equations in <br/>
physics.  We are definitely NOT a textbook family.  If you have <br/>
some non textbook approaches to learning algebra, we would <br/>
LOVE to hear them.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll be happy to share.  My dd has an aversion to textbooks of<br/>
all kinds, so I&#39;ll add in her favorite physics references, too.<br/>
Actually, she did physics before she did math, so you may<br/>
actually be more interested in those :).<br/>
<br/>
For Algebra, we like Isaac Asimov&#39;s _Realm of Algebra_ if you can<br/>
find it.  Then there&#39;s _Algebra Unplugged_ by Kenn Amdahl and Jim<br/>
Loats (the concepts without the problem sets)  and _Algebra The<br/>
Easy Way_ by Douglas Downing.  (He also has Trig and Calculus the<br/>
Easy Way) which does have the problems but presents things like a<br/>
story.  Those are what we&#39;ve used here.  I&#39;m in the process of<br/>
trying to clean up all my disks of goodies from over the years<br/>
and if I find any other good things I&#39;ll let you know - but it<br/>
may take me another 6 months &lt;g&gt;!<br/>
<br/>
For physics she liked Isaac Asimov&#39;s _Understanding Physics_ for<br/>
a general overview of the field, F. Capra&#39;s _The Tao of Physics_<br/>
and anything by Martin Gardner - if it&#39;s not physics, it&#39;s math!<br/>
She started with _The Relativity Explosion._<br/>

grocery shopping that way. I ask him to aproximate and then to let me know<br/>
which is a better deal. Cool.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not Carol but I have a suggestion for you anyway! Harold Jacob&#39;s<br/>
&quot;Mathematics: A Human Endeavor (A Book for Those Who Think They Don&#39;t Like<br/>
the Subject)&quot; is a textbook but a lovely one! (He also has an algebra book<br/>
but I haven&#39;t seen that yet.)<br/>
<br/>
The first chapter of A Human Endeavor is about billiards. I bet your son<br/>
would love it! I got this book used from Powells (www.powells.com) and I<br/>
think it&#39;s also available new and used from PA Homeschoolers<br/>

that wonderful explanation! Now why didn&#39;t &quot;school&quot; teach me that? And why <br/>
did I have to do all those stupid &quot;algebra worksheets&quot; in school? What was <br/>
the point? When I am figuring out problems in my daily life, I never stop and <br/>

to take care of a horse for a year (as part of their lobbying for their own <br/>
horses!). They did checked out<br/>
mail order catalogs(decided that  you use up whatever you save in shipping <br/>
and you don&#39;t get to see the stuff before you buy it and you might have to <br/>
pay for return shipping if you don&#39;t like it). We took them to tack shops and <br/>
the Farmer&#39;s Exchange. they made a list of what they&#39;d need, transferred it <br/>
to a chart they developed, and listed prices. They added up the cost of what <br/>
they thought they&#39;d need, including the horse, fencing, the barn(wealready <br/>
have one but it need lots of work), etc., and were amazed at the total. They <br/>
then figured that the 1st year would be the most expensive, since they&#39;d have <br/>
a lot of one-time expenses.  The other mom and I provided transportation and <br/>
whatever else they asked for, period. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165730639">**I think what is happening is that her peer group of <br/>
homeschoolers are &quot;school-at-home&quot; types and she compares <br/>
our life to theirs and worries that we aren&#39;t being conscientious. <br/>
She&#39;s beginning to see that this isn&#39;t so, but she is also nervous <br/>
about her weaknesses.**<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she&#39;ll eventually get into enough conversations about Algebra with some <br/>
of them to find out that quite a few are probably not really getting it, <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago, my always unschooled daughter was getting pressure from a <br/>
homeschooled aquaintance about Algebra - the girl never let a chance pass to <br/>
point out to Melissa how far along she was in her algebra book and how hard she <br/>
was working. After one conversation she ranted at me &quot;She was complaining that <br/>
she has a hard time remembering formulas and figuring out what formula she&#39;s <br/>
supposed to use when. She doesn&#39;t have the slightest idea how to think about a <br/>
problem, how to decide what you&#39;re trying to find out so that you can decide <br/>
how to find it. And she thinks &quot;I&#39;M* in need of studying algebra. Hmmmph.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I hope your daughter finds a resource that helps her to understand. <br/>
Continuing to beat her head against the wall of her incomprehension will not bring the <br/>
wall down but might damage her. :(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-262050033">We have used and enjoyed Hands-On Equations. It&#39;s a kit with cubes with numbers on them and you put them on a balance (on paper) and work out equations with them. We have used them in groups at co-op also. They are from Borenson Assoc. 610-398-6908.<br/>
My kids also enjoy the Key to Algebra (and other Key To...) math books. They have an interesting math history story at the beginning of each book, and the material is presented in a common sense way. They are from Key Curriculum Press (they have a website).<br/>
