Why is the word &quot;lazy&quot; a negative word to you? Is it not possible for you to<br/>
think that it may not be a negative, but a positive or even just an<br/>
indifferent, word to others? If not, why not? What about other words? Don&#39;t<br/>
you think there are words out there that mean totally different things to<br/>
different people? Why shouldn&#39;t people have the freedom to look at words any<br/>
way they want to?<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lazy in this society in the language of our time is a negative word. If you<br/>
tell your boss or your neighbor, &quot;you&#39;re lazy&quot;, he&#39;s not going to ask you,<br/>
&quot;do you mean that as a negative, or a positive?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t really be saying you think we should all use whatever words we<br/>
feel the urge to, without regard to their currently accepted definitions? I<br/>
should feel free to toss around racial slurs and perhaps call my daughters<br/>
sluts, as long as I say it with a smile? And when my daughters repeat these<br/>
words to label others, smiling away, the consequences are not my fault?<br/>
<br/>
The poster who asked what happens when the siblings start calling the one<br/>
child &quot;lazy&quot; has a very valid point. And when they call people outside the<br/>
family, &quot;lazy&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Lazy has a definition. It can&#39;t and doesn&#39;t mean, in general society,<br/>
whatever you want it to. I will also wager real money that in your head it<br/>
means, &quot;slower than I would like him to be&quot;. If it did not mean that, it<br/>
would not come into your head. The words in your head were you comfortable<br/>
with your son&#39;s speed would be more along the lines of, &quot;he&#39;s so relaxed;<br/>
he&#39;s wonderfully introspective; he really takes his time about things<br/>
instead of haring off all over the place.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you think your child is not picking up on the negative meaning just<br/>
because you smile when you say it, I think you&#39;re wrong. If you started to<br/>
apply positive thoughts about his moving more slowly than the rest of the<br/>
bipeds in the household, I hope you&#39;d find the word &quot;lazy&quot; would suddenly<br/>
leave a bad taste in your mouth.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son and I had an interesting conversation the other day.  Someone had <br/>
mentioned to him that his middle finger was a bad finger.  I told him that <br/>
he had no bad fingers; all his fingers were only fingers and there were no <br/>
bad ones.  But, I told him that when you wave your hand at someone you <br/>
don&#39;t have to say anything else for them to know that you&#39;re saying hello <br/>
or goodbye.  I told him that in our society, holding up your middle finger <br/>
all by itself is a symbol for other people to know that you&#39;re saying <br/>
something really mean to them, whether you have a smile on your face or <br/>
not.  Communication is like that; we have symbols and symbols have meanings <br/>
and everyone agrees to honor these definitions.  I told my son that if he <br/>
tried it out to see what would happen, he could get himself in a heap of <br/>
trouble!  (I&#39;m glad we had that little conversation!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434506728">Hmmm, ok thanks! I tried to look it up in my dictionary - AND IT&#39;S NOT THERE!!!! Weird. So I looked it up online: 1 a : disinclined to activity or exertion : not energetic or vigorous b : encouraging inactivity or indolence &lt;a lazy summer day&gt; <br/>
2 : moving slowly <br/>
3 : DROOPY, LAX &lt;a rabbit with lazy ears&gt; <br/>
4 : placed on its side &lt;lazy E livestock brand&gt; <br/>
5 : not rigorous or strict &lt;lazy scholarship&gt; <br/>
<br/>
None of these seem negative at all to me, rather they are descriptive. But I do respect others&#39; opinions that it is negative to them, and I will be sure and work it into a conversation with the boys that some people may be insulted if the word is said to them. <br/>
<br/>
And, yes they do call each other by nicknames, if that&#39;s what you mean. If something bothers them, they ask the other to stop, and it is stopped immediately. No problems. <br/>
<br/>
I have nothing but positive thoughts about the rate he chooses to move/learn/do. I have no desire to hurry him up, he&#39;s perfect the way he is, as are all my children. <br/>
