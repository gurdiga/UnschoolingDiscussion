Dear mierons, You&#39;re on the right path, now start taking longer steps. We&#39;re<br/>
with you all the way.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I feel that my <br/>
&gt; children do much better when I let them pick the subject areas that<br/>
&gt; interest them and delve abit more into it than what the text books<br/>
&gt; offer. So............. where do I start.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Start by following what you&#39;re telling us -- LET the children make the<br/>
decisions. In other words, STOP doing what you&#39;re doing. Life is NOT<br/>
&quot;subject areas.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I live in Arkansas and they have mandatory testing in the 5th, 7th<br/>
&gt; and 10th grades. So I have that that I will have to somehow have to<br/>
&gt; deal with. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>First of all, they probably don&#39;t have &quot;mandatory passing&quot; of those tests,<br/>
and I can bet the farm that not all the school kids pass all those tests.<br/>
By homeschooling, especially unschooling, your kids are almost guaranteed to<br/>
be years ahead of school kids, but acadamically and emotionally. So, DON&quot;T<br/>
WORRY ABOUT TESTS. Homeschooling is not about preparing kids for the tests<br/>
that put schoolkids in boxes.  You have some unlearning to do, some<br/>
de-schooling. UNschool yourself. It&#39;s for the children&#39;s sake.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also would like to know how do you all really teach the kids.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Entirely by example. By being kind to them, nurturing for them, helping them<br/>
become who they want to be. By not doing to them what the schools do to<br/>
them, including &quot;teach&quot;. The less teaching that happens, the more learning<br/>
takes place. <br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; know that I have desided this year to try to get as much as I can<br/>
&gt; off of the internet.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When you get something, be sure NOT to tell the kids about it. Let them get<br/>
what they want from the internet and anyplace else.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I would guess the biggest subject area that I<br/>
&gt; really finding difficult to find is math that is taught as a fun<br/>
&gt; game that will slowly build up on its self teaching as they have<br/>
&gt; fun. I would appriciate any help anyone could offer.<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Go to www.borntoexplore.org/unschool  and read Luz&#39;s article  called,<br/>
&quot;A Few Words About Math.&quot;  It will change your ideas about &quot;teaching&quot; math,<br/>
I&#39;m sure. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think we do unschoolers (all homeschoolers really) a disservice when we <br/>
continually talk about how homeschooled kids are almost guaranteed to be <br/>
years ahead of school kids.  Here we are saying that kids should decide <br/>
what and when to learn stuff, and then we assume they&#39;ll be ahead of grade <br/>
level.  A kid who chooses not to learn to read until age 10, 12, or even <br/>
later is not going to be years ahead of school kids.  He&#39;ll likely have <br/>
lots of other strengths, but he could well be years *behind* the average <br/>
school kid his age, like mine.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
