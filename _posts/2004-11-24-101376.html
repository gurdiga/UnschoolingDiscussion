<br/>
Yesterday we celebrated the release of the new U2 cd.   My niece (in<br/>
college in Missoula) is a U2 fan and she was coming over for the long<br/>
Thanksgiving weekend.  We picked up the cd for her, (one for us, one for<br/>
her dad &lt;g&gt;) and the Live Aid dvd (for the U2 bits).   We printed little<br/>
thumbnail photo&#39;s of Bono, The Edge, Adam and Larry and cut them out for<br/>
confetti.  We made lots of food and played the music loud and made up U2<br/>
trivia questions and danced.  We copied CD covers and strung them on<br/>
streamers.  We played pin the shades on Bono. <br/>
<br/>
The little confetti dudes were Dylan&#39;s idea and he originally wanted to<br/>
pin the *nose* on Bono, but his favorite part of party planning is<br/>
deciding on snack foods.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977056612">Oh you are a woman after my own heart!!! I love the &quot;pin the shades on Bono&quot; idea! We are <br/>
all things U2 around here this week. My U2 iPod came in the mail yesterday and I <br/>
downloaded the complete box set last night (took hours).<br/>
<br/>
Today, we&#39;re all singing.<br/>
<br/>
Bono is one of my enduring icons of what it is to be fully human, spiritual and artistic all <br/>
rolled into one.<br/>
<br/>
Did you see them on SNL? Awesome!<br/>
<br/>
I even got to write part of a book about his lyrics:<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s always a pleasure to find another U2 fan, and I agree about Bono.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***Did you see them on SNL? Awesome!***<br/>
<br/>
Yes! Bono looked and sounded so young when they were singing &quot;Out of<br/>
Control&quot; or maybe I was just flashing back twenty four years and feeling<br/>
young again myself. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***I even got to write part of a book about his lyrics:<br/>

<br/>
Well, this is cool!  I hadn&#39;t seen it before but now I think I&#39;ll find a<br/>
copy and give it a look. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

Last night, Cameron, Duncan, and I took one of Duncan&#39;s friends home with  <br/>
the understanding that we&#39;d run by to pick up &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot;  <br/>
(for me and Cameron) and SpongeBob, SquarePants&#39; Soundtrack CD for Duncan.   <br/>
Successfully making our purchase, we all listened to SpongeBob on the way home <br/>
 in deference to Duncan and for his pleasure.  It actually is very  good.  <br/>
What&#39;s interesting is that Rolling Stone rated both of the  CDs in its latest <br/>
edition.  According to Rolling Stone, SpongeBob  and Patrick rated equal to Bono <br/>
and The Edge.<br/>
 <br/>
All together now .... &quot;Who lives in a pineapple under the sea ....  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-290896759">We have Lord of the Rings parties whenever we buy the extended <br/>
version of one of the movies. We will get the third at Christmastime <br/>
so our next party will be then.<br/>
<br/>
We dress up in costumes, decorate our apartment like Middle Earth <br/>
and cook food from the books and movies.  We made a quote game and <br/>
play trivia and watch the movies.  It is loads of fun!  A few times, <br/>
we&#39;ve just had LOTR parties for &quot;no reason,&quot; not even to celebrate <br/>
the Extended Edition releases. :)</div>

household, too!<br/>

especially for a family like ours that is very food-oriented.<br/>
