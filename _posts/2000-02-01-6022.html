<div id="ygrps-yiv-407947467">Hi Heather glad you survived the ps to live to tell about it here! You would<br/>
have probably been put into a gifted program in lots of schools nowadays.<br/>
They don&#39;t have them up here. BTW who are you voting for tomorrow email me<br/>
privately if those teachers made you feel too shy to say here in my little<br/>
hs poll!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Heather.  Your experience sounds similar to mine in some ways.  I was in<br/>
the GATE program from 3rd grade on, but always got reports that said I<br/>
didn&#39;t do assignments, didn&#39;t finish work, that kind of thing.  I frankly,<br/>
didn&#39;t care.  I was so disillusioned and disgusted with the IS&#39;s offerings<br/>
and their entire system, that I was already unschooling myself as much as<br/>
possible as early as I could.  I had access to great museums, libraries,<br/>
and cultural things in the city, as well as learning opportunites presented<br/>
by peers and other factors.  I got failing grades in most things and often<br/>
ended up in summer school (which was a waste of time and rediculously easy<br/>
work, not to mention getting beat up every summer!)  but I really did not<br/>
care a whit about any of it.  If it were not for the terrible blows my self<br/>
esteem were taking in the IS system, I might have largely ignored it<br/>
alltogether.  I ALWAYS, from day one, hated, HATED school.  I used to hide<br/>
under my bed when I was little or feign illness to avoid going.  When I got<br/>
older, I just began to cut school as often as possible.  My parents never<br/>
did anythig to try and improve my schooling, change my evnironment,<br/>
interest me in school, etc.  They just trusted the system to &quot;educate&quot; me.<br/>
