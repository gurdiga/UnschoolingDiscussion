&lt;&lt; Shawn said he wanted to look at their bones and then I read a little bit <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; about what the paleontologists said and I asked him if he knew what a <br/>
 &gt; paleontologist was and he said &quot;a scientist that studies bones.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That was really cool that he was relating it that way, but a paleontologist <br/>
is actually a scientist that studies fossils.<br/>
Very different actually.<br/>
You could look up some stuff on Jack Horner and Egg Mountain, I bet he&#39;d <br/>
really dig that! ( no pun intended ) hehe<br/>

growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
