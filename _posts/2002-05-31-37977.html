Well, mine too if you read the rest of my posts. I&#39;m using a term that  IS <br/>
used by some people though, to explain how they do categorize and divide <br/>
students every day.<br/>
I was explaining the difference in how they use those terms.<br/>

&lt;&lt; It&#39;s really more of a question, really. We all know<br/>
 that children learn like CRAZY during their first 5<br/>
 years. Does anyone know if anyone&#39;s ever done a study<br/>
 that correlates the slow-down in learning to a a<br/>
 child&#39;s introduction into a school environment. In<br/>
 other words, has anyone ever shown that NOT putting a<br/>
 child in a school environment, but instead keeping a<br/>
 child in a natural, self-directed environment (you<br/>
 know, like the one they&#39;re in BEFORE they&#39;re sent to<br/>
 public school!) eliminates or at least diminishes the<br/>
 slow-down in learning?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, as unschoolers we&#39;re experts on that topic!!! LOL<br/>
I don&#39;t believe there has ever been a formal study done, but I could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
There has, however, been a lot written on the topic by people like John Holt, <br/>
Rachel Carson and others.<br/>
In fact, what you said greatly reminded me of something Rachel Carson wrote <br/>
in &quot;The joy of wonder&quot;...I&#39;ll look it up later.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ren, I&#39;m reading &quot;Learning All the Time&quot; right now.<br/>
I&#39;m really enjoying it. It just makes SO MUCH SENSE.<br/>
It&#39;s funny, I&#39;m reading the section on math right now,<br/>
and at age 36, his words are showing things to me<br/>
about math that I just hadn&#39;t really gotten before! (I<br/>
actually made it through trig/calc in high school.<br/>
I&#39;ve always been able to DO math, I just don&#39;t really<br/>
KNOW math.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard of Rachel Carson. I&#39;ll have to put<br/>
that name on my book list.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>no i didn&#39;t mean your use of them are stupid :) <br/>
but i suppose they work for their intended purpose in schools and doctor&#39;s <br/>
offices. Sorry about the confusion <br/>
