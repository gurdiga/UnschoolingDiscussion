<div id="ygrps-yiv-726959735">FYI - Target&#39;s $1 section has some great back to school stuff!  I would say<br/>
most of it is pre-school elementary ages and some of it general teacher<br/>
decor like calendars and such.  Anyway, I just got Aden some alphabet and<br/>
number window clings.  He has been really focusing on letters and numbers so<br/>
I thought they would be fun.  I also got him some board books in that<br/>
section. <br/>

To nine lists, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t cross post to this list, especially as many of our list  <br/>
members are in places where Target stores don&#39;t even exist.  If you  <br/>
want to tell us a story about how your son used something in an  <br/>
interesting way or something that will help other people unschool  <br/>
better, that would be great.  It&#39;s more appropriate for a local group  <br/>
than an international discussion group.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054800149">I didn&#39;t so much take it as a heads up about Target in particular <br/>
(though in that context I would have loved to have heard about it a few <br/>
days sooner, lol) but just as a reminder that so-called &quot;school <br/>
supplies&quot; can really enrich your unschooling experience. Also that if <br/>
they&#39;re on sale at Target they&#39;re probably on sale elsewhere too. If <br/>
they&#39;re on sale we&#39;re more likely to be generous and carefree with <br/>
them, esp. those of us on really tight budgets.<br/>
<br/>
IOW, even unschoolers can buy school supplies without necessarily using <br/>
them for schooly purposes. Maybe our more seasoned unschoolers don&#39;t <br/>
need reminders of this, but maybe newer ones do?<br/>
<br/>
I used to get excited about new boxes of crayons when it was back to <br/>
school time, not because I was excited about school, just because <br/>
there&#39;s something exciting about a new box of crayons. Wouldn&#39;t it have <br/>
been nice to get a new box of crayons from time to time &quot;just because&quot; <br/>
instead of having to have a reason?<br/>

<br/>
This is true and worth talking about.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean I want this list to be one of nine that gets the  <br/>
same post.  If anyone here wants to set up a list and not be at all  <br/>
particular what&#39;s on it, it will be your list.  If you can&#39;t figure  <br/>
out how to set one up, there are lots of people here who would be  <br/>
willing to help you!<br/>
<br/>
I used to think my kids would want school supplies, but they didn&#39;t.   <br/>
They can keep the same set of crayons for a long time, and take care  <br/>
of them. We used to have an old-time school supply store that sold  <br/>
individual crayons of the basic 16 Crayola colors.  They had little  <br/>
packets of metallics, too, and a skin-tones set.   But my kids would  <br/>
replace their most used-up crayons and keep the same box. Without  <br/>
school desks to contend with, crayons can last a long time.<br/>
<br/>
And they have the same binders and notebooks for a long time, too.   <br/>
When Kirby took community college classes, he used some Ninja Turtle  <br/>
folders (the kind that go into a three-ring binder) that I had bought  <br/>
him when he was six or seven.  He had used them for several different  <br/>
things over the years, but he cleaned them out and took them to class.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the school-trained one who smells autumn and wants new paper.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little lots of their toys and supplies were stored  <br/>
in school lunchboxes.  They fit on shelves well and it was an excuse  <br/>
to buy some, though we usually got them from thrift stores.  And  <br/>
three-ring binders became holders for Pokemon cards and various  <br/>
things in sheet protectors.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mmmmmmmm! I read this and instantly had the memory of the smell of a <br/>
new box of crayons. I love the fact that I can get a box of 64 <br/>
crayons at a dollar store any time - I always resented my mom buying <br/>
me 16 or 24. I also remember being told over and over as a kid &quot;you <br/>
can&#39;t make a living coloring&quot;. Now when I&#39;m designing a quilt for a <br/>
customer I&#39;ll photocopy the basic design and spend the day with a <br/>
box of 64 crayons, coloring it all different ways. Actually, all the <br/>
things I do for money these days are &quot;hobbies&quot; that were maligned <br/>
when I was a child in favor of &quot;academics&quot;. Ironic. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll look at &quot;school supplies&quot; at least once - this year <br/>
in our state we have a limited time tax break on school supplies <br/>
coming up in August. There&#39;s a bunch of computer stuff included, but <br/>
somehow I don&#39;t think the SIMS Expansion pack will be on the list - <br/>
go figure....<br/>
