Help your son see what choices he does have rather than being upset with<br/>
things that are beyond his control. He can choose not to play volleyball. He<br/>
could find some other team. He could put up with the &quot;rain&quot; and enjoy<br/>
himself despite the weather.&lt;&lt;<br/>

I love this response.  You can offer information and perspective to the<br/>
offending person.  What he does with that is out of your control but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s wasted.  After that the changes you *can* make are within<br/>
yourself.  You can take the person way less seriously, you can set up<br/>
boundaries so that the coach knows how the kid feels and the child has some<br/>
control over how much he is willing to take before saying that&#39;s enough and<br/>
finding another team or sport.<br/>
<br/>
My dd was reduced to tears by a director who just had too few skills.  He&#39;s<br/>
older and though he seems to love working with children, he relies heavily<br/>
on empty threats, bluster and embarrassing kids to get them to do what he<br/>
needs them to do.  I was furious and ready to pull her out of the play but<br/>
that wasn&#39;t what she wanted.  (she&#39;s 8).   Sydney said she was going to tell<br/>
him what she thought of him the last day and until then she just didn&#39;t care<br/>
what he said because she didn&#39;t respect him anymore.  She certainly wasn&#39;t<br/>
going to sign up for any more of his productions.  We had a lot of talks<br/>
about the effect words have on people, the responsibility we have to be<br/>
respectful to people and why this man wasn&#39;t.  (he was rarely rude to the<br/>
adults - just the kids).  She learned a lot, finished the play and by the<br/>
end wanted to do it again.  By this time DH an I had found her another group<br/>
and she chose to do that instead.<br/>
<br/>
I dealt with the situation as best as I could.  Stuffing all that anger<br/>
ended up making me rather sick - so I learned a lesson too.  In the end I<br/>
gave him a copy of How to talk so kids can learn and to my surprise, he<br/>
received it graciously and said he would read it.  If Sydney had decided to<br/>
bail I would have left that man behind and shaken the dust from my shoes but<br/>
I&#39;m glad she knew what she wanted and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t unload on him before<br/>
I was able to pass on that book. Next time I will know not to bury my anger<br/>
though.<br/>
