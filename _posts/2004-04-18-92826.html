<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888987204">***If you get mice in your kitchen will you decide their right to live<br/>
there is as great as yours?<br/>
If not, what will you do?***<br/>
<br/>
Two stories!  A woman on the MontanaUnschoolers list (who might be here<br/>
too?) found that a mouse her cat killed had babies under her sink.  She<br/>
tried to save them, fed them breast milk from teeny little bottles.  I<br/>
they didn&#39;t survived, but not for lack of trying.  <br/>
<br/>
My sister found a frost bitten mouse in her shed and moved it into her<br/>
house, in a box, and nursed it back to health  She now has quite a<br/>
lovable pet mouse with a peg leg.  Not really a peg leg, just a little<br/>
stumpy leg where it&#39;s frost bitten foot fell off. <br/>
<br/>
I think mice have as much right to live as I do, but I don&#39;t think they<br/>
have as much right to live in my house as I do. &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;ve only had one<br/>
mouse and we caught her in a live trap and let her go in the field across<br/>
the river.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re the people take spiders outside so the cats won&#39;t eat them, or to<br/>
the basement in the winter so they won&#39;t freeze. (So they can grow huge<br/>
and come back upstairs later) <br/>
<br/>
When my husband cleaned the basement I told him to be sure not to vacuum<br/>
in the corner where the funnel web spider lived and to watch out for the<br/>
little camel cricket that always hung out by the dryer.  He said , &quot;You<br/>
know honey, most people clean their basements to get rid of those<br/>
things.&quot;  &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
What was my point?   OH!  That if mousicide is distasteful there are<br/>
other (very strange) options. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-274138059">We, too, do not kill insects that we find in the house.  In our <br/>
bathroom cabinet we have two Dixie cups labelled &quot;Life Preservers,&quot; <br/>
and we use them to capture our unwanted guests and transplant them <br/>
outside.    <br/>
