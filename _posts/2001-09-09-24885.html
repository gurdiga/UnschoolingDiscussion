<br/>
Just doing a check - how many folx are unschooling an only child? I<br/>
dropped a note on the message boards about this too, and then realized<br/>
I&#39;d really like to discuss some of the differences that other folx see.<br/>

So we do sports and the local homeschool group and the local Y. What do<br/>

are multi kids, and I don&#39;t mind one bit!  Our boys get along better when <br/>
there&#39;s another boy in the mix.  There are games they can play with three, <br/>
and if the guest-only gets tired of Marty&#39;s loud, puppy-like boisterous ways, <br/>
he can go hang out with darker, more cerebral yet more irritating Kirby!<br/>
<br/>
One of our onlies moved out of state and I miss him.  He calls sometimes, and <br/>
they&#39;re all still in contact by e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
Another one is here a couple of three times a week and he&#39;s great.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had a regular-schooled-only around a lot lately.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-165082759">I have one son.  He had three good friends/play pals who moved away last<br/>
year.   He has a hard time making friends, not because he&#39;s not social (<br/>
that word ) but because he&#39;s so different from the kids around here, they<br/>
don&#39;t accept him readily.  It&#39;s been frustrating.   He has grown ups in<br/>
his life who still like to play though, so I think all is well.  ( found<br/>
my husband in the tree last night )<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am. We don&#39;t tend to have problems with her missing the companionship<br/>
of other kids, though - she ends up playing with another kid or kids most<br/>
days, because it seems like we&#39;re always doing something, and she also<br/>
enjoys just hanging out with the adults and teens in her life.... she<br/>
typically does 2 or 3 regular activities a week (theater, soccer,<br/>
volunteering, etc.) but that&#39;s not really the same as just playing with<br/>
friends. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-908200469">I was once an only child, because of divorce.  I really think I am<br/>
special because I wasn&#39;t always with kids my age, but with elderly people<br/>
who are great examples and sources of information.  I did play with other<br/>
children, just not that often.  I remember spending time alone in nature<br/>
on the farm.  With pets.  And I think maybe he is not different, but<br/>
unique and not peer pressured.  Books were my companions, but there were<br/>
times, just at the right time, when I would providentially make friends<br/>
with another child and it would keep me from going over that edge of<br/>
loneliness, (these were times when my parents were not there for me). <br/>
And the friends I did make were true friends.  I believe if you follow<br/>
your son&#39;s interests, it will lead you to the friends he is in need of,<br/>
young or old.<br/>

interests are pretty varied, so I&#39;m hangin&#39; in there.<br/>
