<div id="ygrps-yiv-816655363">Do I need to ask people to private post me about starting our own group and<br/>
getting a couple of experienced people so that we can particiapate and ask<br/>
questions without being treated as though we had commited some sort of<br/>
unforgivable sin or something?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Where oh where did anyone ever say any of your questions were not worthy or <br/>
worth asking?<br/>
From what I&#39;ve read, you didn&#39;t like the brand of advice given to you and got <br/>
very angry at any suggestions that were made which were anything but patting <br/>
you on the back.<br/>
It&#39;s too bad when a person asks for advice but has already decided what kind <br/>
of answers they want.<br/>
In no way did I ever say that your posts &quot;spoiled&quot; the list. I said it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be wise for seasoned unschoolers to not answer the post by pointing <br/>
to unschooling.<br/>
That&#39;s all.<br/>
I think whatever way you find support that is great.<br/>
But please don&#39;t twist my words and advice meant completely and totally for <br/>
the purpose of help, to sound like I was shunning anyone.<br/>
I love answering the questions of new unschoolers.<br/>
I also remember you saying you weren&#39;t an unschooler, so maybe there-in lies <br/>
the problem?<br/>
Maybe we are pointing to unschooling because that&#39;s what this list is here <br/>
for, and you don&#39;t want unschooling advice at all?<br/>
I really don&#39;t know.<br/>
Trying to understand how my advice to look for math in every day, and many <br/>
materials and not worry about trading lessons, go twisted to mean negativity.<br/>
Still confused...<br/>
