What a great idea... Zak wants some more trains for his Thomas Track and I <br/>
think I&#39;ll start that with him.  We already use his &quot;money box&quot; to buy <br/>
trains, but that money has usually come from grandparents and us putting <br/>
change in there... When we go to the store he takes his whole money box with <br/>
him and plops it on the counter.  Most of the time there&#39;s not enough but I <br/>
haven&#39;t let him know that so far.<br/>

I know we have invested over $500 (shudder) as he has lots of track and <br/>
nearly all the trains, bridges and other working parts that go with it.  Zak <br/>
plays with it everyday for a good period of time and has done so since he was <br/>
3 years old.  He doesn&#39;t ever seem to get bored with making up stories about <br/>
what the trains are doing.  I&#39;ve had relatives buy him different pieces for <br/>
gifts.  Also though he&#39;s received the other things for various behaviors we <br/>
wanted him to work on and that he&#39;d changed...  Hopefully this last sentence <br/>
won&#39;t set off a thread about changing kids behaviors (LOL)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691667184">I know what you mean.  Do you guys have any railroads nearby that have <br/>
Thomas Days?  We just loved doing that.  My son is really looking forward to <br/>
the movie coming out soon.  We are hoping that it will respark his interest <br/>
with the trains and he will play with them some more.  (He did play with <br/>
them from about 18 months - well into 4)<br/>
<br/>
You are new and you weren&#39;t on the list when I mentioned my son&#39;s webpage  <br/>
www.geocities.com/Heartland/Valley/8284<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you like it.  My husband and son are supposed to be updating <br/>
it.  Maybe they will get around to it this weekend.  He wants to add <br/>
skyscrapers to it now.<br/>

Thank you so much for the page (or should I thank your son)... I&#39;ve just <br/>
saved it as a favorite to show Zak later... I know he&#39;ll love it... We don&#39;t <br/>
have Thomas Days here although we would love to... I&#39;m not sure how that <br/>
happens... Do you know?  I did contact the local train store and my mum is <br/>
going to take Zak there next Friday as they have several tracks laid out with <br/>
lots of different trains on them.  Also going to start looking at yard sales <br/>
for Lionel Trains as well..<br/>
