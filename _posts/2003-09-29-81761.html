&lt;&lt; Ma said, No, Laura could only wear pink because her hair was brown and <br/>
Mary had to wear blue because her hair was blond. What was THAT all about? As <br/>
a <br/>
child, I always wondered &quot;What&#39;s the big deal? Why can&#39;t she wear whatever <br/>
color she wants?&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There were just too many rules in those days.<br/>
<br/>
In my own family, when we took my cousins in, there were two girls in (I&#39;ll <br/>
pick a year at random, but the pattern continued) fifth grade, and two in <br/>
second.  Our cousins were older, but having started school in Texas with fall <br/>
birthdays, they were a year &quot;behind&quot; New Mexico starting years.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if that&#39;s considered in comparing test scores?  The Texas kids were <br/>
on average older in the same grade than the New Mexico kids who started <br/>
&quot;early.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
With a summer birthday I was the same in either state.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my mom would get the same dress in two colors.  We ended up dressed <br/>
like friggin&#39; TWINS and weren&#39;t even sisters.   Sadistic or lazy, hard to say.  <br/>
Both, to a degree.<br/>
<br/>
And for a while we had &quot;colors,&quot; so that if some plastic toy had been bought, <br/>
pink was my sister&#39;s, blue was Nadine&#39;s, red was Nada&#39;s and green or black <br/>
would be mine.  Then we could tell our stuff apart.<br/>
<br/>
WELL duh.  I find that even though I can&#39;t tell my boys&#39; stuff apart, THEY <br/>
can.  I ask them.<br/>
<br/>
My mom had elaborate schemes to keep us from fighting over things.  <br/>
<br/>
At Christmas she got us the same things.  Four etch-a-sketches.  Four stuffed <br/>
monkeys with bananas.   She would mark them with our colors in a small <br/>
corner, or with thread.  Socks were marked with a stitch of &quot;our color.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps like an orphanage, or like we used to have rats, in psych lab, with <br/>
identifying stripes on their tales put on with magic marker.<br/>
<br/>
I used to usher for the Santa Fe opera, as a teen.  We wore expensive, <br/>
access-controlled long hand-woven ponchos from Ortega&#39;s in Chimayo.   Most were <br/>
striped in browns and oranges, but a very few were blue.<br/>
<br/>
The blue ones were pretty, but every single night, someone who had chosen <br/>
blue ended up with the least attractive leftover brown because of this:<br/>
<br/>
The organizer&#39;s daughter had red, strawberry blond hair, and she and her <br/>
mother said it ONLY looked good with the blue, so every week as the rest of us <br/>
rushed for the prettiest colors, Karen yawned and hung out by the door, sauntered <br/>
over and claimed the blue one she wanted when she felt like it.<br/>
<br/>
So I DO understand the ribbon colors thing, from personal experience, two <br/>
ways.  <br/>
<br/>
If they had the same color ribbons, the mom might have had to settle fights <br/>
about whose were whose.   <br/>
<br/>
Oh!!!  And it&#39;s worse.  There were traditional &quot;rules&quot; about what color <br/>
&quot;clashed&quot; with another.  My mom refused us wearing green and blue together &quot;because <br/>
they clash.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No consideration of how those particular two particular shades looked <br/>
together, just &quot;take it off, it clashes.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Same with pink and red.  &quot;They clash.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My mom wasn&#39;t an artist at all.  She just feared to break any of the <br/>
near-magic-powered mysterious unfounded &quot;rules&quot; which had crept up inside her from <br/>
every direction.  <br/>
<br/>
No fish with milk.  You might die.<br/>

<br/>
Or blue flowers with green leaves.<br/>
Or water in lakes.<br/>
<br/>
I think green and blue are Great together.  In fact today I bought some <br/>
cotton tennis shoes and plan to dip one end in blue dye and then later the other <br/>
end in green so where they meet they&#39;ll be halfy-half.  I have lots of blue and <br/>
green t-shirts.  (Some are blue, and some are green, and white shoes will just <br/>
be brown and black too soon.)<br/>
