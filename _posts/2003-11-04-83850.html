<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726314227">&lt;&lt;and it is just sharing of information, take it or leave it&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, its not.  First, it is not SHARING information, it is cramming<br/>
down a little kids throat.  When that child approaches a home on Halloween<br/>
which has its porch light on (the secret code of i&#39;ll play trick or treat),<br/>
the child is expecting a certain scenario.  By turning on the light or<br/>
giving whatever indication that you will engage in trick or treating, the<br/>
adult is indicating to that child that they will engage in said scenario.<br/>
What the kid gets is somebody&#39;s version of God, not candy.  It&#39;s like a<br/>
fraud.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I used to belong to one of those churches that used tracts.  They<br/>
were scary even to me and I was used to being around people who could fit<br/>
the phrase &quot;washed in the blood&quot; in every day conversation.  The pictures<br/>
and prose are purposely set up to incite fear and guilt.  To me, it is no<br/>
different than if somebody showed my small child the movie &quot;Halloween&quot; for<br/>
the express purpose of scarying them.<br/>
