&quot;To parents I say, above all else, don&#39;t let your home become some <br/>
terrible miniature copy of the school.  No  lesson plans!  No quizzes!  <br/>
No tests!  No report cards! Even leaving your kids alone would be <br/>
better; at least they could figure out some things on their own.  Live <br/>
together, as well as you can; enjoy life together, as much as you can.&quot;<br/>
