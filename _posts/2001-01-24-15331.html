 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t agree with that. Jesus is THE son of God and the Christ. The <br/>
original Hebrew tells us that Jesus is the son of God, not just a son of <br/>
God. As for interpertation, I am a Babtist and I take the Bible literally. <br/>
This is the first thing I&#39;ve said on this list that will probably make <br/>
someone mad or at least irritated with me, but I am not going to conceal my <br/>
faith to avoid upsetting someone. That&#39;s the least of my worries. -Ren<br/>

sees him as a shaman. My children see him much the same way I do. A<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s why I get a little perplexed when people choose to take the bible <br/>
literally word for word, and then take those words out of context.  It&#39;s a <br/>
written account of people many years ago, not the direct voice of god.  And <br/>
it has been translated many many times.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the source of this information- but I was told that the <br/>
original word for virgin in the context of The Virgin Mary, meant young <br/>
girl, not our meaning of the word virgin.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in God, and I believe that he speaks directly to our hearts.<br/>
