It&#39;s a really, really good story.  If she&#39;s nervous about it, I&#39;d understand <br/>
and won&#39;t press.  If she wants to add or tell it in her own words or whatever <br/>
that would be great.  I&#39;ll put as much or as little (or nothing) as she wants.<br/>

Right. &quot;And *I* turned out just fine&quot; seems to be the mantra.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*****************<br/>
<br/>
       DD14 just told me about a conversation along these lines.<br/>
<br/>
       She performed in a recital/musical theatre revue on Saturday. It <br/>
involved all ages, but her own peer group within the &quot;company&quot; is six or <br/>
seven <br/>
girls and a couple of boys, age 13-16 or so. (A couple are homeschooled, none <br/>
is <br/>
unschooled except DD, but a few others do have thoughtful, mindful parents.) <br/>
They&#39;d been together in the theatre almost around the clock, what with dress <br/>
rehearsal and an earlier show that day, and they were cooling their heels in <br/>
the <br/>
wings in costume, before the first number of the second show. <br/>
<br/>
       As DD tells it, someone mentioned what a brat one of the youngest <br/>
dancers was, what a pain, why didn&#39;t her parents make her behave better, be <br/>
quieter and less of a prima donna.  DD helps work with the younger ones and <br/>
knows <br/>
them pretty well, so she said oh, no, really they&#39;re all great kids. <br/>
<br/>
       Several of the others turned on her and said not this one, this one <br/>
needs lots morems, like DD, had never been <br/>
spanked or slapped or even given a &quot;time-out.&quot;.) <br/>
<br/>
       One of these girls suggested maybe all the spanking and swatting could <br/>
be part of the problem rather than the answer, to a chorus of angry denial <br/>
from those who grew up being hit by their parents. They started telling <br/>
stories <br/>
to show being spanked was necessary to being raised right, saying &quot;DUH - <br/>
that&#39;s why they call it *discipline*!&quot; and that it had made them moral and <br/>
well-behaved -- if ganging up to make mean remarks about some smaller child <br/>
in your <br/>
circle can be considered moral or well-behaved &lt;grrr&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       What was really interesting though, and the reason I bring it up now, <br/>
is that DD said she realized at that point there was nothing to say. At least <br/>
there was nothing anyone who&#39;d never been hit or punished could say. Her few <br/>
gently parented peers there just seemed to sense that anything they said <br/>
would <br/>
sound like a put-down of someone else&#39;s parents. And that it wouldn&#39;t help <br/>
anybody, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
       Here is the Power of Story I see in this. By the teen years, being <br/>
spanked and smacked becomes something its victims must either internalize and <br/>
defend, or break from their family&#39;s teachings to reject (two really poor <br/>
life <br/>
choices for a young teen, imo). But NOT being smacked and spanked seems by <br/>
the <br/>
teen years to foster a natural, internal kind of moral, well-behaved <br/>
sensitivity (one that even the girls themselves weren&#39;t conscious of). <br/>
<br/>
       These lovely, thoughtful, beautifully mannered, compassionate and <br/>
happy girls were just sad and felt sorry about what others had been taught to <br/>
believe, and so today I&#39;m thinking of this as one of the first world windows <br/>
through which DD and her similarly parented peers are seeing for themselves <br/>
the <br/>
logical results of how humans treat each other --  and DD and I both are <br/>
despairing  of how to ever share this with those who&#39;ve had other <br/>
sensibilities beaten <br/>
into (or out of) them. JJ<br/>
