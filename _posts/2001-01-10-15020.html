Hi Ashley. It&#39;s on Nickelodeon. When I first saw it, I thought, &quot;Eew. Did<br/>
they have to draw the characters like that?&quot; but it grew on me. Mostly<br/>
because the main character, Eliza, reminds me of my own pre-adolescent<br/>
daughters. And the fact that they unschool. The idea is, the family creates<br/>
a nature show for TV. They travel all over the world. To make it really<br/>
interesting, Eliza magically has the ability to talk with animals. So we get<br/>
to learn about animals and other cultures, etc. And it&#39;s just funny. The<br/>
sisters fight and complain, but they all definitely love each other. There&#39;s<br/>
also Darwin the chimp and Donny the wild boy they adopted. I don&#39;t know if<br/>
your kids are old enough to really enjoy it, though. My 4.5 yo can take it<br/>
or leave it.<br/>

<br>any cable, you will not be able to see the show.
<br>
<br>Also, for the post about age relevance and interest in the show my youngest 
<br>is 3 1/2 &nbsp;and this has been her favorite Nick show for over a year.
<br>
<br>And, about Tim Curry, he has done cartoon voices for the original Rugrats 
<br>Movie and on several Nickolodeon shows other than Thornberry&#39;s (ie: real 
<br>monsters, rugrats etc.) &nbsp;He has also &quot;guest voiced&quot; on some prime time 
<br>animation shows as well. &nbsp;He is quite versatile in his talents.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105180684">Ok, I KNOW, I KNOW this topic is soooo old but I<br/>
really really REALLY wanted to comment on it when it<br/>
first came up and didn&#39;t have time and then more and<br/>
more topics came up and I forgot about this one and<br/>
then more and then more and then sickness and then<br/>
stuff and then more stuff and then kids and then<br/>
lunch.........<br/>
you get the picture.<br/>
ahem.<br/>
I LOVE WILD THORNBERRYS!!!!!!!!<br/>
so do the kids, but I think I like it a bit more. :)<br/>
sometimes I get all excited when i see it coming on<br/>
and yell &quot;Look kids! thornberrys!&quot; and they get giggly<br/>
at MY extreme happiness to see it. :)<br/>
I&#39;m very attached to it. The first time I saw it my<br/>
daughter was just a baby -ish sort (I can&#39;t remember<br/>
how old but it seems soooo small and young compared to<br/>
3)  :( and my son...must have been like 3 1/2 or 4 or<br/>
something...<br/>
and we were travelling (my son&#39;s favorite thing to do,<br/>
he was so &quot;easy&quot; to travel with, too) with my oldest<br/>
sister who had left doing Electrical contracting<br/>
-owned her own business (cuz of all the stupid<br/>
politics involved with doing ANYTHING of any authority<br/>
as a woman),- to do &quot;wax hands&quot; (make wax molds of<br/>
people&#39;s hands) at fairs and festivals across the<br/>
country on her own and thus make money expressing<br/>
herself creatively and doing something she really<br/>
loved- travelling. Well, I had gone with her while<br/>
pregnant with dd, travelling up the east coast -ending<br/>
up in NY before coming home- and seeing alot of things<br/>
we (ds and me) may not have seen otherwise. Alot of<br/>
our time was spent in a small RV (our &quot;temporary<br/>
home&quot;) and we loved it. It was not a popular move to<br/>
some people, travelling all summer while pregnant and<br/>
&quot;dragging&quot; your 2 yr old along with you, with nothing<br/>
but two other women and your 13 yr old niece, not a<br/>
man in sight! (*gasp*), but my son still remembers it.<br/>
<br/>
oh my I&#39;ve gotten off on a tangent again. anyway,<br/>
after dd was born we travelled just somewhat locally<br/>
with my sister, cuz it was a relaxed creative way to<br/>
make money and expose my kids to alot of interesting<br/>
people and places, and on our way home dd got a little<br/>
bit of a cold, along with me, and we decided to spend<br/>
the day in our hotel room (RV was not around for this<br/>
trip) and order in for food and swim and watch TV. ds<br/>
(and me I must admit) loves NickJr so we turned there<br/>
of course, expecting to find Blue&#39;s Clues and lo and<br/>
behold there is this new show that they are having a<br/>
MARATHON of, allll day long. and it is about AN<br/>
UNORTHADOX TRAVELLING FAMILY WITH *****SMART**** KIDS<br/>
THAT DON&#39;T GO TO SCHOOL!!!!! I was in heaven , and<br/>
THEN I heard Nigel&#39;s voice. Being a HUGE, and let me<br/>
emphasize *HUGE* Tim Curry fan, it really couldn&#39;t<br/>
have gotten any better for me. Ds said &quot;Mom look! they<br/>
have a driving house just like we did! Cool!&quot; <br/>
 And surprisingly, my kids have actually learned alot<br/>
about some very interesting animals that I didn&#39;t even<br/>
know existed cuz they saw them on Thornberrys and then<br/>
thought they were so cool that we had to read more<br/>
about them. <br/>
<br/>
I love that show. I think it actually is my very<br/>
favorite current cartoon. Dd&#39;s is Dora the Explorer.<br/>
Dora&#39;s her hero. :)<br/>
hm. well, thanks for taking the time to read this<br/>
extremely looong rambling if you&#39;re still reading. :)<br/>
