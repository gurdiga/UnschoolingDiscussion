<div id="ygrps-yiv-17488144">Kolleen, <br/>
Would you please forward this to the unschooling list for me? I unsubbed <br/>
myself and was unable to get this posted today. It&#39;s an update on <br/>
something I said I&#39;d look up and get back to.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Sarah Carothers<br/>

It took me awhile but I finally found the book with figures on the <br/>
insurance premiums doctors face. The book is<br/>
Opportunities in Physician Careers by Jan Sugar-Webb 1999.<br/>
<br/>
On pg. 79 under the OB/GYN category:<br/>
&quot;But malpractice premiums, which can amount to *more* than $50,000 a <br/>
year, are a major issue for this profession.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and on pg.39 under the heading of family practice:<br/>
&quot;All self-employed physcians must pay liability insurance. The average <br/>
liability premium a year for all physicians in 1996 was $14,100; the <br/>
average premium for family physicians was $8,400.&quot;<br/>
and<br/>
&quot;The average gross income of a family physician is approximately <br/>
$139,000.&quot;<br/>
