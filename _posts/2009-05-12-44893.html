<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670284946">The other day my son was mad at something his grandma said or did. So<br/>
instead of asking why he was mad, my MIL told my son (who is 4.5, almost 5)<br/>
that he can&#39;t be mad. It was the weirdest thing. She said he could be angry<br/>
but not mad because that meant he was crazy like a lunatic or insane. I said<br/>
he could be mad if he wants to be! He is mad in the sense that he is angry,<br/>
there are multiple definitions of many words. (Meanwhile I just wanted to<br/>
try to figure out WHY he was saying he was mad at her, so we could possibly<br/>
remedy that feeling or she could explain whatever she said or did that made<br/>
him mad, which she completely ignored by trying to control his emotions!) <br/>
 <br/>
It doesn&#39;t make sense to correct a 4yr old when he is not even wrong. I&#39;ve<br/>
been around several people who like to do this and I don&#39;t get it. Is this<br/>
just their way of being right? Despite the harmful or uneasy feelings they<br/>
conjure when they do this? <br/>
 <br/>
I just looked up the definition at dictionary.com and yes, MAD can mean<br/>
insane, but it can also mean angry. It can also mean overcome by desire (to<br/>
be mad about opera was the example) as well as rabid and a few other<br/>
definitions.<br/>
 <br/>
I was (mad/angry/resentful) when she pointed this out during dinner, and<br/>
when I argued, my husband agreed with his mom!!! Why do people feel the need<br/>
to tell other people how to live or how to feel? It just felt like one more<br/>
&quot;schooly&quot; influence, like a way for her to assert a little control over us<br/>
or something. Maybe I am paranoid. I am mostly trying to remember the<br/>
beautiful day we spent at the beach with my MIL, everyone getting along<br/>
wonderfully and lots of fun had by all. :) I know it seems trivial compared<br/>
to a lot of the posts on here, but if anyone has any insight or an example<br/>
of how you would have handled this, that would be great. I am contemplating<br/>
sending the dictionary definition to my DH and MIL. There is even a little<br/>
line about how some teachers like to correct people by saying that insane is<br/>
the only acceptable usage for the word mad, but it has been used to mean<br/>
angry since 1300 and is now quite acceptable.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sympathetic to you and your frustration with your mother in law.    <br/>
Even though I know the want-to-do-something feeling of wishing a  <br/>
husband&#39;s mother wouldn&#39;t be a dope with a young child (I&#39;ve known it  <br/>
personally and repeatedly), still I&#39;m going to comment in way of  <br/>
trying to help you see a balance.<br/>
<br/>
The literal answer to your subect question, &quot;why can&#39;t we be MAD?&quot; is  <br/>
because it doesn&#39;t create peace or learning in your home.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I was (mad/angry/resentful) when she pointed this out during  <br/>
dinner, and<br/>
when I argued, my husband agreed with his mom!!! Why do people feel  <br/>
the need<br/>
to tell other people how to live or how to feel?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, though, you&#39;re wishing your husband had told her how to live  <br/>
and how to feel.<br/>
<br/>
-=- It just felt like one more &quot;schooly&quot; influence,...-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is way beyond and separate from school.   There were in-laws  <br/>
before school was ever considered, and there&#39;s a biological/genetic  <br/>
thing going here.   So don&#39;t think &quot;school,&quot; if you can help it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-... like a way for her to assert a little control over us<br/>
or something. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like she was defending herself, and maybe trying to be a little  <br/>
funny (not that it worked well) and maybe trying to influence your  <br/>
son&#39;s mood.   I can think of a dozen worse things she could&#39;ve done  <br/>
without even thinking hard.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe I am paranoid.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You have motherly instincts.  Those can feel like vigilance which can  <br/>
feel like paranoia, but don&#39;t exaggerate them past their own natural  <br/>
strength.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I am mostly trying to remember the beautiful day we spent at the  <br/>
beach with my MIL, everyone getting along wonderfully and lots of fun  <br/>
had by all. :) -=-<br/>
<br/>
So you have a good example and a bad example.  Don&#39;t dwell on the bad  <br/>
one.  Think of what you could do to nurture or induce the good stuff  <br/>
next time.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your son could&#39;ve done something different.  It&#39;s worth  <br/>
discussing it with him.  Rather than try to change his grandmother,  <br/>
you might try to &quot;grandmother-proof&quot; him with some suggestions about  <br/>
how to respond to her, or to dodge questions or criticisms in sweet  <br/>
ways.   Holly asks about the tortoises and the yard.   How cute can  <br/>
that be?   They can ask her all about her hair dye or clothes or  <br/>
boyfriend and she can say &quot;Are there baby tortoises yet?&quot; and smile.   <br/>
My kids learned tricks about grandma&#39;s house at an early age.<br/>
<br/>
Holly will be there today, with Keith.   His mom is not likely to live  <br/>
much longer, though she&#39;s having her hair done this morning.  She has  <br/>
cancer in several places including ribs, and she had an arm amputated  <br/>
in early March.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I know it seems trivial compared<br/>
to a lot of the posts on here, but if anyone has any insight or an  <br/>
example<br/>
of how you would have handled this, that would be great. I am  <br/>
contemplating<br/>
sending the dictionary definition to my DH and MIL. There is even a  <br/>
little<br/>
line about how some teachers like to correct people by saying that  <br/>
insane is<br/>
the only acceptable usage for the word mad, but it has been used to mean<br/>
angry since 1300 and is now quite acceptable.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t pursue that definition.  Let it dissolve, breathe yourself  <br/>
calmer and happier, and think of the next time, not the last time.<br/>
<br/>
There might be parallels in this list of how to screw up unschooling.   <br/>
Maybe you could put your energy into a list of how to screw up visits  <br/>
with grandma.  Then you&#39;ll have a mental checklist of good things to  <br/>
do.   Mine always included getting the kids and grandparents out to a  <br/>
public place like the children&#39;s museum in Albuquerque or the train  <br/>
museum in Alamogordo or someplace where kids could be cute and smart,  <br/>
and it wasn&#39;t grandma&#39;s territory/chairs/property.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps you could&#39;ve scooped him up and asked him why he was so angry,<br/>
and completely sidestepped the whole mincing of words!  His grandma has<br/>
already proven to be manipulative and bossy and I&#39;m sure your son felt<br/>
that, and maybe he even couldn&#39;t articulate why he was angry, but felt<br/>
it none the less.  Perhaps help him find a way to articulate what makes<br/>
him angry when he is with his grandma, so that he doesn&#39;t get so angry,<br/>
so that he can say &quot;please don&#39;t do that.&quot; and then change the subject<br/>
and move onto something else.<br/>
<br/>
That is a really hard skill for some kids to be able to do, but worth<br/>
encouraging!</div>
