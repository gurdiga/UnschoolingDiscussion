If a child wants a fish, get him/her one<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s all how one defines &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;learn&quot;. If you look at the etymology you find this:<br/>
<br/>
 Teach: &quot;Middle English techen to show, instruct, from Old English tæ?can; akin to Old English tacn sign&quot;<br/>
from Merriam-Webster Online<br/>
<br/>
Learn: Middle English lernen, from Old English leornian; akin to Old High German lernen to learn, Old English last footprint, Latin lira furrow, track <br/>
from Merriam-Webster Online<br/>
<br/>
With regard to teaching: if you take it as a root meaning, &quot;to show&quot;, then learning has nothing to do with &quot;teaching as being the cause of learning&quot;. Learning and teaching are opposite sides of the coin. They balance each other out. They are one and separate (like the left and right sides of a stick; together they are the stick, you can&#39;t take one away.) In the root meaning, we all have the ability to &quot;teach&quot;. If my son wants to learn how to tie his shoes I can show him. <br/>
<br/>
With regard to learning: if you take it&#39;s root as &quot;furrow&quot;, how does one make a furrow? Well, it&#39;s done with effort and repetition by oneself. When my son learns how to tie his laces, the learning comes from within himself...all I have done was offer a gift of my own learning, my own know-how. He has to &quot;dig his own furrow&quot; so to speak. When he has tied them himself, then he has &quot;mastered&quot; the technique...he&#39;s learned how.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, &quot;teaching a child to learn&quot; seems absurd in this respect. Learning is a &quot;doing thing&quot;, done by the &quot;doer&quot;. It&#39;s active and done by choice. And we can learn from all sorts of teachers: wind, rain, food, animals, religion, culture, art, our own emotions, experience, etc.<br/>
<br/>
No one can make anyone do anything. I wholeheartedly belive this to be true. However, in our society, I would also say that &quot;forcing one to learn&quot; is true. Learning IS a choice. However, if you are in a very stressful situation, you may choose to learn how to do something at a particular time/place that you would not have if you had other choices. I also think &quot;learning under duress&quot; creates a shallow furrow....that&#39;s why most of us forgot what we &quot;learned&quot; all those years ago in our public &quot;learning&quot; institutions. <br/>

<br/>
First, let me thank you for this opportunity. <br/>
I would agree that one can teach without anyone learning, however, I would not agree that one can learn without a teacher. My point is that &quot;Teach&quot;, as in &quot;to show&quot;, is always right in front of us. We can choose to learn, to know cause and effect, to discern &quot;what is&quot; if we chose to do so. This definition/point of view is not antagonistic or limited; it&#39;s meant to be open and holistic. And, if you can &quot;demonstrate and explain&quot;, then I would say one has learned....regardless of your feelings or the other person&#39;s emotional response.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A furrow is usually made in one pass of a plow. A tractor can make <br/>
several furrows at the same time. Not a good analogy, and doesn&#39;t <br/>
take repetition.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A furrow, throughout history, and even today does take a great deal of effort. It depends on how far you look. If you where able to own an oxen or horse there is effort in the care and training of the animal. From what I have read in agricultural literature, plowing a field with an oxen or horse is not an easy endeavor. Even today, if a furrow is dug by a tractor, it has taken a great deal of time and energy, resources to produce that tractor and maybe even to buy it. Effort is there. If you ever have the opportunity to plow a field with a tractor you may find it takes some skill.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;-=-And we can learn from all sorts of teachers: wind, rain, food, <br/>

Why does that make them teachers?<br/>
Just because I learn from art doesn&#39;t mean art was my teacher.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Again, I mean it from the perspective that &quot;teach&quot; is &quot;to show&quot;. Everything, the whole universe is here and now, it&#39;s all right in front of you.  One can choose to see how things are or one can choose not to. If I spit in the wind, the wind &quot;shows/ has taught me&quot; what happens. Show/teach is not necessarily a force directed at someone, it&#39;s what is. As per your example, art is in front of you, it&#39;s an experience. You can choose to glean something from it or not. As another example, if I learn how to pollinate my squash by watching the bees, I would say, with gratitude, that the bees are my teacher. If the art or the bees weren&#39;t there for me to see/experience I wouldn&#39;t have learned from them.<br/>
One can teach/show another anything in a forceful, negative way. If so, then that is your way. It doesn&#39;t make the teaching, the showing itself negative...it&#39;s the intent, the person who is expressing negativity - the showing is the same. Either Hitler of Mother Theresa could have shown a child how to tie a shoe. The process/mechanics  are the same (give or take differences in technique) - it&#39;s the intent that may be different. They are both showing/teaching. <br/>
Art is not a being of free will. It cannot actively direct itself at you....however, it can teach/show you many things about history, other peoples customs or yourself.  Humans and other sentient beings, however, can choose to teach/show with intention and with and out of love (or out of the desire to control). Teaching/showing can be a gift from one to another. A gift is freely given and acceptance is a choice.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537489716">Thought I&#39;d share some &quot;teacher&quot; wisdom.  I was at a lifeguard training class last night and 3 people in the class are teachers.  The instructor asked one of the teachers to put in a dvd and turn on the tv and find the correct remote.  It took about 10 minutes for her to find the remote in a pile of 4 remotes.  It didn&#39;t take long for the other 2 teachers to jump in and help.  It was the funniest thing ever, 3 teachers talking back and forth, all of them sounding like 3 year olds learning to use a tv and remote, none of them had a clue what they were doing.  All the other people in class were just watching and only the teachers tried to help.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad they weren&#39;t &quot;teaching&quot; the class and I&#39;m glad my kids aren&#39;t in any of their classes.<br/>

  So what if you learn something by doing it?<br/>
  Who is your &quot;teacher&quot;?<br/>
  Kids do this even more than adults (before someone tells them they need to &quot;learn&quot; from a &quot;teacher&quot;).They learn by doing, They try until they get it and than perfect it to their satisfaction or ability.<br/>
  I can give lots of examples of things I learned by myself, including reading at about 4 and a half and no my mom did not have time to read books to us. She seldom did but we had lots of them at home.<br/>

while they fashion and use tools, and learn by watching and imitating,  <br/>
they don&#39;t teach each other, even their own offspring.  Humans, on the  <br/>

joyfully, gaining pleasure from it and rewarding the learner with  <br/>
encouragement and praise, so that both parties are engaged and happy.<br/>

<br/>
**I** don&#39;t &quot;agree&quot; that one can teach without anyone learning.  One  <br/>
can talk, write on a board, show slides, tell stories, sing and  <br/>
dance, but if no one learned anything, they didn&#39;t teach anything.    <br/>
The accounting departments of school districts define &quot;teaching&quot;  <br/>
differently, but for the purposes of helping people understand  <br/>
unschooling, that definition isn&#39;t at all useful.<br/>

Choosing to do something isn&#39;t as simple as it sounds.  There are  <br/>
many people who can&#39;t discern things that come easily to others.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re going to too much effort to defend your original statement:   <br/>
&quot;if you take it&#39;s root as &quot;furrow&quot;, how does one make a furrow? Well,  <br/>
it&#39;s done with effort and repetition by oneself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A furrow can be made with a stick in the ground, and however much  <br/>
effort it might be to find the stick and sharpen it and drag it  <br/>
forcefully through the dirt, it&#39;s not &quot;repetition by oneself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Etymology is great.  I LOVE etymology.  It doesn&#39;t make a teacher of  <br/>
a bee, though.  People didn&#39;t know bees were pollinating plants for a  <br/>
LONG time.  They didn&#39;t know men were &quot;pollinating&quot; women for a long  <br/>
time.  The theories on reproduction of people, plants and animals are  <br/>
fun to hear or read about, but only what really happens happens.  The  <br/>
idea that there were eggs in women wasn&#39;t obvious.    Genetics isn&#39;t  <br/>
an ancient science, and it&#39;s not something each person learns  <br/>
separately by watching bees.   Just as a tractor involved centuries  <br/>
of development in plow design, metal refinement, invention of the  <br/>
internal combustion engine and all that, genetics and shoe-tying have  <br/>
histories too.<br/>
<br/>
People learn by building on what they know.  However they come upon  <br/>
what they know, adding to it is done all inside them.<br/>

find the remote in a pile of 4 remotes.  It didn&#39;t take long for the other 2 <br/>
teachers to jump in and help.  It was the funniest thing ever, 3 teachers <br/>
talking back and forth, all of them sounding like 3 year olds learning to <br/>

other people in class were just watching and only the teachers tried to <br/>

I don&#39;t quite get your point. Was it a test to discover the right remote?<br/>

Why didn&#39;t the first person just ask the instructor which was the right one <br/>
and save 9 of the 10 minutes?<br/>

Teacher is a word describing someone who teaches -- that&#39;s something <br/>
one does, actively.  <br/>
<br/>
If you really feel a need to give some credit to the source for what <br/>
you learn, it would be more accurate to say &quot;seeing the effects of <br/>
the wind on other things was my lesson&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The bigger question, tho, of whether a child must be taught to learn <br/>
isn&#39;t just one of semantics.  People are born learning.  Even if no <br/>
one actively engages in teaching a child, he will learn from his <br/>
surroundings.  <br/>
<br/>
The whole concept of teaching a child to learn has always bothered <br/>
me.  It presumes that children are not only blank slates, but that <br/>
the ability to learn isn&#39;t inborn.  If it&#39;s something that must be <br/>
taught (or learned) then it&#39;s also something that can be lost or <br/>
never devlop at all.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one of my favorite quotes -- from one of my favorite books <br/>
about the topic of learning.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The official theory that learning requires structure and effort has <br/>
enormous destructive power.&quot;  Frank Smith, from The Book of Learning <br/>
and Forgetting<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t if the person who owns that tagline, or any defenders of <br/>
the &#39;teach children to learn&#39; concept have read this book, but it&#39;s <br/>
the one I recommend first and most often to anyone asking about <br/>
unschooling.  And the author isn&#39;t even an unschooler, but he&#39;s put <br/>
together an amazing amount of data about how people learn, and <br/>
why &#39;teaching&#39; as it&#39;s done in schools today, fails children. <br/>

teacher and that I should follow his lead. He may have seen that  reading was <br/>
*possible* by seeing and hearing others read, but no one taught  him what age <br/>

Bottom line--- I liked the sig line... it isn&#39;t perfect, but makes a neat point... I think it is more about exposure than &quot;teaching&quot;, but if there is a subject of particular interest, it seems that pursuing a &quot;teacher&quot; with vast experience would make sense to me (though it may be a truck driver or mechanic in my son&#39;s case).<br/>

and &quot;f&quot; match a little more similar, for the artistic effect.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t &quot;teach him calligraphy.&quot;  I chose that font because he&#39;s a  <br/>
lefty and it&#39;s a 0-degree slant and he was using felt-tipped pens.  I  <br/>
told him that.<br/>

<br/>
Teaching, in school terms, is pushing knowledge that someone else  <br/>
wants into a child.<br/>
<br/>
Learning, in unschooling terms, is the child pulling what interests  <br/>
the child in.<br/>
<br/>
While we can see the world in terms of teaching -- that a table above  <br/>
us &quot;teaches&quot; us not to stand up under it ;-) -- to understand  <br/>
unschooling, it&#39;s far more helpful to see the world in terms of  <br/>
learners.<br/>
<br/>
To see how the child chooses to pull in what interests him, is to see  <br/>
that it works far more effectively when someone&#39;s not pushing to get  <br/>
it -- or worse something else -- in.<br/>
<br/>
So you *can*, if you wish, see teachers everywhere. But it won&#39;t  <br/>
help, and will probably hinder, your understanding of unschooling.  <br/>
(And if you already understand, then pointing out the teachers could  <br/>
possibly hinder someone else&#39;s understanding.)<br/>
<br/>
Lots of &quot;getting&quot; unschooling is a matter of shifting viewpoint. One  <br/>
of those viewpoints is shifting from seeing teaching to seeing learning.<br/>

<br/>
This is skirting dangerously close to the idea that there are &quot;basic skills&quot; <br/>
that are too important to allow the Unschooling process to unfold so they <br/>
must therefore be taught.<br/>
<br/>
Long time Unschoolers have found that to be a false assumption.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of &quot;teaching&quot; is that the person with the knowledge controls the <br/>
experience, controls the schedule, the pace the ordering of the imparting. <br/>
In natural learning the learner is in charge of their own processes.<br/>
<br/>
The issue for Unschoolers is not &quot;does/should teaching exist&quot; but &quot;how do we <br/>
move towards Unschooling?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you want to move towards Unschooling let go of seeing yourself as your <br/>
child&#39;s teacher. A really useful exercise is conciously and mindfully to <br/>
replace all permutations of the word &quot;teach&quot; with permutations of the word <br/>
&quot;learn&quot; whenever the word comes up in your speech or thinking. Sometimes it <br/>
takes a real effort!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
****Isn&#39;t one facet of learning to use the knowledge and experience of <br/>
competence models and knowledgable people to inspire the &quot;student&quot; see more <br/>
possibilities. It is important to let children and adults follow their <br/>
interests, and see the connections between all knowledge. It is often <br/>
helpful to have a more experienced person be available to the student to <br/>
answer questions.****<br/>
<br/>
It is also worth examining why one is retaining an attachment to the words <br/>
and idea of teach teaching, teacher. It is one way to discover any &quot;hold <br/>
out&quot; assumptions, the last barriers preventing the full embracing of <br/>
Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I guess that I envision a world devoid of teachers as a world where <br/>
much time is spent recreating the wheel. Not that there might not be some <br/>
pretty cool wheels created, but it would come at a price--- for some reason <br/>
I am thinking of learning to drive a stick shift with no teacher.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Funnily enough I was just thinking about the idea of &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; <br/>
last night. There is a kind of cultural assumption that this must <br/>
necessarily always be a bad thing, along with the idea of time being wasted. <br/>
Yet in school every child is supposed to follow along with the history of <br/>
the wheel, to extend the metaphor.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose the ability and freedom to reinvent the wheel were celebrated and <br/>
extolled in our culture instead. What would happen?<br/>
<br/>
My experience with Jayn is that if she invents her wheel in her own way, it <br/>
is a wheel that she intimately understands and appreciates and can use - a <br/>
better wheel for her - a better way of *making* a wheel for her. The price <br/>
of not allowing her to have that process is much higher than any difficulty <br/>
within that process.<br/>
<br/>
No child&#39;s learning experience is time wasted.<br/>
<br/>
A world devoid of teachers is not a world devoid of people doing stuff. The <br/>
absence of teaching is NOT the absence of knowledge or the willingness to <br/>
share experience or modelling or the answering of questions.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t *need* a teacher to drive a stick shift, just the opportunity to <br/>
watch someone doing it, the chance to sit in the driver&#39;s seat, and support <br/>
to ask questions without being judged for doing so.<br/>
<br/>
Insert ANY skill instead of the phrase &quot;drive a stick shift&quot; and you <br/>
have...Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Missing out on stuff - knowledge gaps - lack of exposure to certain ideas or <br/>
skills - another post (maybe a long one).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would not agree that one can learn without a teacher. My point is  <br/>
that &quot;Teach&quot;, as in &quot;to show&quot;, is always right in front of us.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you define absolutely anything that contributes to learning as &quot;a  <br/>
teacher, then of course nobody could, by your definition, learn  <br/>
anything without a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
But, a &quot;teacher&quot; is not just anything that contributes to learning -  <br/>
it is &quot;a person who teaches, especially in a school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A useful point to make - that we can learn from anything we come into  <br/>
contact with and, in fact, makes the point that we don&#39;t NEED &quot;a  <br/>
teacher&quot; in order to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Why hang onto a school-word, trying to stretch its meaning to fit this  <br/>
very different view of how learning happens?<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to do this - she used to say that I taught my kids to  <br/>
read. But I never did - I provided them with an environment that  <br/>
allowed them to learn to read. To say, &quot;I was their reading teacher&quot;  <br/>
would give a false impression because it would lead people to think I  <br/>
gave them reading instructions, that I prepared lessons, that I  <br/>
actually taught them. She would say, &quot;Well, you designed the  <br/>
curriculum.&quot; &lt;G&gt; I&#39;d say, &quot;Huh? What curriculum?&quot; She&#39;d say, &quot;Well,  <br/>
I&#39;d call creating an interesting, stimulating environment the same as  <br/>
creating a really wonderful perfectly individualized curriculum.&quot; I&#39;d  <br/>
say, &quot;You can call it that, but it isn&#39;t what other people are going  <br/>
to think you mean by it, so why purposely cause that kind of confusion  <br/>
by making up your own meanings for common words?&quot;<br/>

It reminded me of sandras page that described a typical day.  From an outsiders point of view not much happened that day.  From an unschoolers point of view it was much different and I don&#39;t have time to write a book to explain everything that went on in our day.<br/>

The teachers all jumped in with the attitude that they are teachers and they can do anything.  The other people in the class were teenagers who are used to being in class and having the teacher lead the class, so they didn&#39;t offer to help.  And I just sat back and observed and chuckled to myself.  Maybe not nice of me, but it was funny.</div>

Do you have time to explain it to your husband or help him to stop  <br/>
expecting any &quot;school work&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Both  parents must understand and support unschooling for it to  <br/>
work.  It  might not happen all at once, but if you don&#39;t move toward  <br/>
it, you might find yourself moving quickly away from it permanently.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I misunderstood and the note you found was old, not current.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911753723">I have been thinking about this lately.  In the mainstream world (as  <br/>
in my husband&#39;s family!) there is this huge assumption that  <br/>
everything that schooled kids learn during their school years comes  <br/>
directly from the school.  We know an unschoolers life will provide  <br/>
them with all of the learning and skills that they need, but are  <br/>
schooled kids simply unconsciously unschooling?  Of course we know  <br/>
this to be true, but I wonder just how true it is?  Just how much of  <br/>
a schooled kids knowledge was acquired through life learning while in  <br/>
school?<br/>
<br/>
My older two kids (8,9) attended public school for a period and we  <br/>
are still heavily in the de-schooling mode.  But my 6 yo who has  <br/>
never gone to school has an amazing way of learning things.  Well I  <br/>
suppose it really isn&#39;t amazing, just normal.  I just love to sit and  <br/>
watch him think.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; If a child comes home from school and you ask them &quot;What did you  <br/>
&gt; learn today&quot; The answer is usually Nothing. Or they will say  <br/>
&gt; something that interests them like &quot;Billy has a pet snake&quot;<br/>
&gt; Everyday, all the time, people are learning things. It is constant.  <br/>
&gt; We don&#39;t realize that the learning is taking place, we just live  <br/>
&gt; and experience life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057884906">Well, obviously I see things differently than many of you on this list. <br/>
Thanks<br/>
for the discussion. I do respect your point of view. It&#39;s just too <br/>
limited for<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
How is a perspective learning happens naturally and independently of a <br/>
teacher or agenda, limited? <br/>
