<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601719561">Hi Michelle:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how or if this friendship thing is going to change... But <br/>
certainly as I&#39;ve grown older and moved from continent to continent I have <br/>
lost touch with people with whom the connection was very strong.  I think I <br/>
discovered that our friendships were based on us having certain things in <br/>
common and when we no longer had those things in common anymore the <br/>
friendship did fade.  I think I can expect that from some of the friends who <br/>
will be sending their kids to public school because I won&#39;t have those same <br/>
experiences to talk about with them and that&#39;s what our relationship was <br/>
based on in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
I know that my &quot;best friend&quot; that I first met when I came to the US is no <br/>
more as I couldn&#39;t come to terms with her dumping her daughter in daycare at <br/>
6 weeks so she could get back to work to make the almighty buck that is so <br/>
revered here.  She said she&#39;d be bored if she was forced to stay home with <br/>
her daughter and couldn&#39;t understand anyone wanting to do that.  It was so <br/>
hard for me to be around someone like that, I decided to step back from her.  <br/>
This wasn&#39;t an issue when we were single, picking up guys, doing drugs and <br/>
generally making fools of ourselves.  Everything changed when we married the <br/>
men we did.  Her husband&#39;s priorities is making as much money and having as <br/>
many things as possible.  My husband&#39;s priority is our family and having as <br/>
much time together as possible... Things come later, if then.<br/>
<br/>
Two of my friends are public school teachers who are adamant about the <br/>
teachers union being the best thing and public education being a necessity <br/>
and it wasn&#39;t until these past couple of years that I gave it much thought.  <br/>
The more I come to learn about unschooling the less and less comfortable I am <br/>
around those friends and public schools and what they churn out.  <br/>
<br/>
So maybe some of it is the schooling decision and some is just that we all <br/>
grow up and apart as we age.  The only friend I still have from long ago is <br/>
my friend in England whom I&#39;ve known since we went to school together at the <br/>
age of 11.  We are both now 40 and still see each other and keep in touch, <br/>
valuing each other&#39;s differences, although there doesn&#39;t seem to be many.  <br/>
Now how do I introduce her to unschooling... she&#39;s just had her first baby in <br/>
February.....<br/>

I have moved quite a bit in my life and not been able (despite lots of effort) to get any friends from other places interested in corresponding and maintaining a relationship.  I try and try with people and I just cannot seem to make good, lasting friendships.  Now that we have been in Idaho over a year we FINALLY have two or three friends that we are getting pretty close to, and I hope like heck that they last!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-689962453">Nanci, I know just what u mean!  There are a couple of folk I <br/>
went to school with that I keep in contact with, but only because <br/>
we all go out every now and then...  We were the off-the-wall <br/>
types in school, some things just don&#39;t change much &lt;g&gt;  Apart <br/>
from that, there are several folk I&#39;ve made &#39;contact&#39; with, one way <br/>
or another, but just not kept up the association...<br/>
