Unless you have a theory on why people who have suddenly stopped<br/>
reporting crimes. <br/>

I had an identity theft thing in, I think, 1999, where they cleaned out<br/>
my bank account and then cycled some bogus checks through it to get more<br/>
money, it totaled around $5000 at the end...  stupid bank was letting<br/>
this woman make huge withdrawala when she didn&#39;t even know the account<br/>
number, was using counter slips, her fake DL had everything wrong except<br/>
the name... sheesh.<br/>
