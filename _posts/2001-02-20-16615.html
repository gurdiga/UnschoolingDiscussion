<br/>
What we did was take some styrofoam balls of different sizes and paint them <br/>
up, then hung them from the ceiling in his room.  As we painted each one, I <br/>
described what it looked like and where in reference to the earth it was <br/>
along with what it was made from.  It made a great day of both crafting and <br/>
learning, and since he helped he was more attentive during the project.<br/>
