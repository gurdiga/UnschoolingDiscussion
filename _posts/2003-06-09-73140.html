 </span></blockquote>Make every day MORE FUN than school could possibly be---even on a *good* <br/>
school day!<br/>
<br/>
Go out to eat. <br/>
Go to a movie---or three. <br/>
Go to the beach.<br/>
Or the mountains. <br/>
Go for a walk.<br/>
And a picnic.<br/>
Buy a new skateboard.<br/>
And some ice cream.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t need to think about what he wants to &quot;study&quot;. He needs time to do <br/>
&quot;apparently&quot; do nothing. Let him unwind from school. <br/>
<br/>
School is very draining. He might watch tv for weeks. Play video games for <br/>
weeks. At that age, he may very well SLEEP for weeks. <br/>
<br/>
Mine did. When he finally awoke, he was *almost* ready to explore his world <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
He needs time to heal and get interested in learning again.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t nag. You&#39;ll have to &quot;start over&quot;! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Let him just be a tired human for a while. He&#39;ll come out when he&#39;s ready. <br/>
Meanwhile, enjoy him. Talk with him. PLAY with him.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suspect what you mean is that you read fun books to make learning fun.<br/>
<br/>
I read fun books because I don&#39;t like reading unfun ones ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The principle of unschooling isn&#39;t to make school learning fun. It&#39;s to<br/>
provide freedom for children to live life in. Part of that freedom is the<br/>
freedom to not have to read unfun books :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He could then <br/>

&gt; his future.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re wanting him to homeschool for that reason it won&#39;t hold much<br/>
attraction for him. You want him to want what you want for him. It&#39;s not<br/>
that you want bad things for him. It sounds like you want good things for<br/>
him. But no matter how good a thing someone else wants for us, if it isn&#39;t<br/>
what we want, then it&#39;s a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
If your life were a movie, your son would be a world class skateboarder with<br/>
a mom who wanted nothing more than for him to put down the skateboard and to<br/>
study to get into college. It would be obvious to the audience the son was<br/>
right to pursue his dream and the mom was wrong to make him want to pursue<br/>
her dream for him.<br/>
<br/>
Real life isn&#39;t quite so obvious but the principles are the same. Honor him<br/>
for who he is. Who he is is someone who likes skateboarding magazines right<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
(Also while he&#39;s in school, who he is is someone who is trying to use what<br/>
little time he has in the day that isn&#39;t dealing with school to follow his<br/>
interests, recover from school pressures, and be social with his friends.<br/>
And maybe squeeze in some family time. But if family time has any negative<br/>
feelings about how he spends his time, it probably feels better to spend the<br/>
time away from family.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think he feels disappointed<br/>
&gt; with himself but not sure what he wants to do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s getting conflicting signals. The world says he&#39;s not worth anything<br/>
unless he succeeds in school. His internal voice may be saying but there are<br/>
things I value more than school so what does that make me?<br/>
<br/>
He  needs time to figure out who *he* is, not time to find interests that<br/>
are limited to just subjects that the world deems worthwhile. Let the whole<br/>
world be allowable for interests. Right now it&#39;s skateboarding magazines.<br/>
Could he get a job in a skateboarding shop? Go to skateboarding<br/>
competitions? Visit all the skate parks in the area?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s interested in photography. Maybe he could take pictures. Maybe he<br/>
could find out magazines require of photographs and send some in.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d rather see him want to UNschool. Homeschool brings in subjects <br/>
and schoolish thinking. Unschool brings in life. If you offer him a <br/>
happy, fun, interesting, full life without school right NOW, he may <br/>
just decide to skip school. I&#39;d make sure he knows that what you&#39;re <br/>
talking about is very different from schooling at home.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;He could then take time to study and think about what he really <br/>

<br/>
Why not let him just do what he wants to do NOW rather than thinking <br/>
about it for the future? He doesn&#39;t need to study. He needs to pursue <br/>
his interests, live his dreams and explore his world. And it&#39;s all <br/>
available to him NOW. <br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-306581992">Well, I lost the post, but someone mentioned Depression. Judy I think. <br/>
Anyway, I have considered that too. We had a councelor for a while and he <br/>
thought maybe he was. He didn&#39;t prescribe anything tho. I have considered asking <br/>
to the doc and trying one. If he needs it, itwill help if he doesn&#39;t it won&#39;t <br/>
and we will discontinue. The hormone changes can really mess one up. Poor kid.<br/>

Okay, so I said in my last post I need to not talk so much, but DH and I had <br/>
this talk just today while eating our leftover-roast-tacos. This paragraph <br/>
reminds me of that new commercial running in California right now by First Five, <br/>
a supposedly educational group. It begins with a college student saying if he <br/>
goes to college, he will be a happier adult, then to a high school student <br/>
saying if he does &quot;well&quot; in high school, he&#39;ll get into a &quot;good&quot; college, then <br/>
down to jr high, then down to elementary and then get this: If I attend <br/>
preschool and do well....WHAT???? Talk about getting kids out of the house at an early <br/>
age!!! This is the exact propaganda that makes children believe if they don&#39;t <br/>
fit the mold, their lives won&#39;t be happy and therefore possibly not worthy of <br/>
living. I mean teens are killing each other and themselves at an alarming <br/>
rate and yet here&#39;s our state trying to shove them into those ugly little desks <br/>
when they can hardly wipe their a$$ well.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who is feeling a rant coming on and better stop now so she can get <br/>
thru this mail!!!<br/>
