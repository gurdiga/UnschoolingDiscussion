<div id="ygrps-yiv-14953620">Sounds like you have very pushy neighbors.  It&#39;s none of their beeswax <br/>
what you do in your own home. You just continue to do things your way <br/>
for your kids.  If  their kids ask them about why they do things their <br/>
way it&#39;s up to them to deal with it.  It&#39;s not your job.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re probably trying to be helpful eventhough their doing it like <br/>
lunkheads.  So treat them like lunkheads.  You don&#39;t need to be <br/>
unpleasant -- just firm.  Put on your tightest little smile and say over <br/>
and over like a mantra,  &quot;We already have a homeschooling group that <br/>
we&#39;re quite happy with.  Thanks anyway.&quot;  Just keep repeating until they <br/>
get it.  Then start chirping about how much you love what they&#39;ve done <br/>
to their yard, how cute their little daughters are and how much you <br/>
enjoy having them come and visit, yadda, yadda.  <br/>
<br/>
Among other things, I  advise political candidates on how to deal with <br/>
the media.  When they get a persistent questioner, I tell them to use <br/>
the same technique.  You don&#39;t have to answer to phone just because the <br/>
bell rings.      <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Their girls (11 and 13) practically live at our house and they <br/>

&gt; do this?  Why don&#39;t you *let* him go to school?  Why don&#39;t you *make* <br/>
&gt; him go to church?  Why don&#39;t you *make* M sit on the potty till she <br/>
&gt; goes (she&#39;s almost 3 and not at all interested in potty training).  I <br/>
&gt; can see it coming.  Their parents are hard-line fundamental Southern <br/>
&gt; Baptists.  We are.... hmmmm I guess if we need a label for the sake of <br/>
&gt; understanding where I&#39;m coming from,  we would be closest to Unitarian <br/>
&gt; Universalists...with pagan interests.  We&#39;re not in SCA (I am looking <br/>

&gt; our house is full of &quot;cool&quot; stuff.  Lately I have overheard them <br/>
&gt; questioning their parents about why they have to go to school and <br/>
&gt; church along with everything else we do differently than they do. <br/>
&gt;<br/>

said that!  I will continue to do so and I think it&#39;s a good idea to<br/>
compliment them a lot on their kids.  I get the impression that a little<br/>
flattery will probably go a long way with them. At least I hope so.  We seem<br/>
to have made an impression on their girls with our lifestyle as they have<br/>
made an impression on our kids with theirs.  My son has become good at that<br/>
tight lipped smile when he says, no thanks, I really don&#39;t *want* to go to<br/>
church with you.  They have their kids asking us now too.  I think the kids<br/>
are afraid we will all go to hell or something....then where would they go?<br/>

We have a similar problem as yours, but it is not a next door neighbor but a<br/>
friend.  They keep asking us to join their fundamentalist homeschooling<br/>
group.  I have said &quot;no&quot; several times, and they keep asking.  I just<br/>
continue to be polite, saying no and go on.  My latest description or our<br/>
&quot;religion&quot; is spiritual agnostic.  (this week anyway).  I had to add the<br/>
spiritual only because I LOVE my tarot cards!!!  he he he!<br/>
<br/>
We also have kids asking why our kids don&#39;t go to school, or church, and I<br/>
say that every family has their different ways of doing things, and noone is<br/>
wrong.  We also go through it with the fact that we do not do anything dairy<br/>
(as a choice).  And, we have a few other alternative food habits that some<br/>
of the boys friends think is strange.  Our boys are fine with  it, and just<br/>
go back to playing after answering questions.<br/>
<br/>
We have a lot of pressure from friends wanting our kids to go to VBS this<br/>
summer.  There seems to be one every week of summer.  Last year, we gave in,<br/>
and the kids went to one with friends and had a blast.  Our only problem is<br/>
all the songs they learned, and all the stuff they came home with.  We just<br/>
told them that is how some people believe, but there are many other ways.<br/>
This year, they have all expressed that they do not want to go to VBS.  I am<br/>
happy with that.  They are going to a young naturalist day camp, and an<br/>
acting day camp instead.<br/>

our kids have way more freedom than they do.  Our kids get to choose how to<br/>
decorate their rooms, what to wear, what to eat (from what we have here),<br/>
what to learn and my son gets to ride further on his bike than they do.  At<br/>
11 and 13 they are still only allowed to go the end of the street and it is<br/>
only 6 houses long.<br/>

told him that if he went and liked it he could keep going and if he didn&#39;t<br/>
like it he did not have to go back.  It was completely up to him.  Well<br/>
after one day he decided that he did not want to go back.  He thought the<br/>
games and crafts were fun but the rest of it was pretty dumb.  He didn&#39;t say<br/>
that in front of them, he was very polite.  When they came over the next day<br/>
(I&quot;m officially watching them all summer while the parents are at work) they<br/>
were very upset that I wasn&#39;t making him go.  The discussion has continued<br/>
every single morning this week like I was going to change my mind or<br/>
something.  I would just look at C and ask him whether he wanted to go.<br/>
When he said no that was that.  They still can&#39;t understand why he gets<br/>
choices.  Today I mentioned that we had to get ready for camp tomorrow and<br/>
the first thing out of the youngest&#39;s mouth was &quot;is it christian camp?&quot;  I<br/>
am really having to bite my tongue.  It is really starting to get on my<br/>
nerves and the urge to snap back with something sarcastic is becoming<br/>
tempting.  But that would just make me look bad &lt;sigh&gt;.  So I am venting<br/>
here!<br/>

Holly should really come and visit.  I might want to ask why the little <br/>

calls them.   <br/>
<br/>
Once over a year ago she and Holly got stuck in her room WITH their big <br/>

and yelling.<br/>

We have a family JUST LIKE THAT.  Baptist.  Dad is no-nonsense.  The kids <br/>
adore being over here (especially the boys, because they play video games, <br/>
and WELL, which is not available at their house).  But I censor the music <br/>
that&#39;s playing and the tv and videos that are on while they&#39;re here.  If they <br/>
weren&#39;t cool kids I might come to resent it, but they like being here, and <br/>
they like me and the kids, and I want to keep that vent and door open for <br/>
them for future purposes.<br/>

That is how I feel about them too.  The 13 year old girl sat down by my<br/>
husband last night while he was gaming and told him that I was her closest<br/>
friend.  She talks to me and I answer her questions. I think she needs that<br/>
so I want to handle this in a way that won&#39;t make her parents feel like they<br/>
have to keep their kids away from our house.<br/>
<br/>
I think they are allowed here because my husband and I came out of a very<br/>
religious background.  Many years ago we were both very involved in church.<br/>
We also worked together in christian radio and in a christian bookstore.  We<br/>
got burned (multiple times) and neither of us wants a repeat performance,<br/>
nor do we want to see our kids go through that crap.  However, we know how<br/>
to &quot;talk&quot; and &quot;act&quot; around those people so I think they are assuming we have<br/>
not found the &quot;right&quot; church or something.  They will figure it out soon<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Their youngest daughter (11) was giving my son the &quot;you need to be saved&quot;<br/>
routine yesterday.  I heard him say &quot;what&#39;s sin?&quot; from the other room and I<br/>
quickly found something to do closer to them so I could hear what was going<br/>
on.  I am sure she is doing this because they are baptist and that is what<br/>
they are taught to do.  If you don&#39;t save your friends they are going to<br/>
burn in hell.  Nice way to scare kids if you ask me and somewhat warped to<br/>
have them always fearing for their friends.  I know because I was raised the<br/>
same way.  It is what is making her so pushy about it, I think, so I am<br/>
trying to be kind about it all.  Really though, inside I am seething about<br/>
the whole situation....probably because it hits such a raw nerve with me.<br/>
<br/>
When she finished with her &quot;presentation&quot; I explained to C that that is what<br/>
Christians believe.  He has been exposed to it before along with the basics<br/>
of other religions.  There are many different beliefs held by friends and<br/>
other family members which he is beginning to notice.  He looked relieved<br/>
and just said &quot;well, I am not Christian.&quot;  She looked horrified as I then<br/>
said &quot;that&#39;s ok, you don&#39;t have to be if that&#39;s not what you want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think the parents are still letting them come over and are still talking<br/>
to us because we are their pet project.  It would be a big deal if they<br/>
could &quot;get us back into the fold.&quot;  My husband also used to be a youth<br/>
minister.  When they found out about that I felt like the vultures were<br/>
circling again.  Oh the ways they could use us.....I can see the glint in<br/>
their eyes. &lt;sigh&gt;  I hate feeling so cynical but I have been through this<br/>
way too many times to do it again.  I truly just don&#39;t want to alienate good<br/>
neighbors (they really are) or my kid&#39;s friends and playmates over religion.<br/>
It is so annoying.<br/>
<br/>
To those of you still reading through this, thanks for letting me vent.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t realize how much I needed it until I saw how long these emails are<br/>
getting...lol.<br/>

I grew up Baptist too, and I totally understand.<br/>
<br/>
My former-preacher uncle died in May.  His very-Baptist daughters found out <br/>
in June.  I would have told them sooner if they hadn&#39;t re-confirmed in <br/>
January (in responses to a letter from me) that they wanted absolutely <br/>
nothing to do with him, down to not wanting to tell him how many kids they <br/>
had these days or what their addresses were.<br/>
<br/>
I suffered through a phone call June 19th.  There was a follow-up letter.  <br/>
I&#39;ve composed a letter, and am sending copies of several of his letters to me <br/>
over the past ten years for them to have to see how things were going.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out they though (I don&#39;t know why) that he had joined &quot;the Ramtha cult&quot; <br/>
and was under demonic influence.  (I kid you not, non-Baptists here reading; <br/>
it&#39;s a quote.)  *If* he ever so much as visited a Ramtha gathering, it wasn&#39;t <br/>
in the past ten years or so, because he&#39;s been telling me all kinds of stuff <br/>
he was doing, and although there was a new-age bent to it it wasn&#39;t THAT <br/>
weird.<br/>
<br/>
So...  In the course of summarizing what WAS true in the last dozen or so <br/>
years of his life, religion had to come up.  Because all they wanted was any <br/>
glimmer of hope that he had died saved.  The fact that he had a degree from <br/>
Hardin Simmons and the seminary in Dallas, had been a music director and (for <br/>
a while) a preacher matters nought to them.   So Baptist &quot;realities&quot; were <br/>
discussed and I&#39;m holding the letter wondering whether to send it or not.  <br/>
Probably will.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s outside the larger stresses of homeschooling conflicts.  (They&#39;re <br/>
not homeschoolers, as far as I know, but I mean homeschoolers in general in <br/>
the world.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s rough.  I understand their fears and concerns,  but the real world <br/>
outside &quot;southern Baptistism&quot; &lt;g&gt; is so much kinder and wiser and happier.  <br/>

Have you ever seen the Isaac Bonewits Cult Danger Evaluation?  It is very<br/>
interesting.  A few of the churches I attended would rate pretty high on the<br/>
scale.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.neopagan.net/ABCDEF.html">http://www.neopagan.net/ABCDEF.html</a><br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am a little concerned here too.  Not that they can do anything about us<br/>
homeschooling.  We&#39;re in Texas and the laws are pretty lenient here<br/>
regarding HS. I can&#39;t think of any reason they could come up with to call<br/>
CPS but you never know.  We are in the Southern Baptist capital here....so<br/>
irrational fears exist.<br/>

spent 10 years of my late teens/early adulthood entrenched in it.  Sometimes<br/>
I feel like I wasted all that time but I suppose I wouldn&#39;t be who I am now<br/>
if not for all of it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ROFL...I should have just checked google.  I don&#39;t think I was ever a<br/>
fundie.  I have always had too much of a rebellious streak in me.<br/>
One time while I was working at the christian bookstore a man came up to the<br/>
counter and asked me if the little black nissan pulsar outside was mine.  I<br/>
said yes and he informed me that my hubcaps had a 5-pointed star on them.<br/>
Without missing a beat I just said &quot;oh, well, I&#39;ll be sure not to park with<br/>
the points down.&quot;  Needless to say he went off in a huff to report me to the<br/>
owner and I got yelled at for being rude to a customer.<br/>
thanks Sandra,<br/>
