<div id="ygrps-yiv-589061969">&lt;&lt;the issue of &#39;requiring&#39; came up when someone suggested that if you<br/>
require anything of your children, you are not unschooling, including<br/>
chores&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually the issue came up when someone described themselves and their<br/>
family as unschoolers and then stated they require their children to write<br/>
in journals.<br/>
<br/>
If I trust my son to be able to learn all the algebra he needs in his chosen<br/>
path through life, how can I not trust my son to be able to learn to live<br/>
with others and meet his obligations and responsibilities?  I either trust<br/>
him or I don&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256933306">&lt;&lt;when you keep saying &quot;no requirements&quot; it sure sounds like mom has to do<br/>
it all&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Only if you assume other family members are not willing to help.  Rather<br/>
than think of it as &quot;adult/child&quot; interactions, think of how you interact<br/>
with your spouse.  Before there were kids.<br/>
<br/>
Did dh require you to do laundry?  Did you require dh to mow the lawn?<br/>
Probably not.  Each person did the things they enjoyed or at least didn&#39;t<br/>
hate.  At least in our family, the things everyone hates get divvied up or<br/>
put off until company is coming  :)<br/>
<br/>
If you, if Dh is willing to pitch in to do things voluntarily, why wouldn&#39;t<br/>
a child?  My 11yo voluntarily cleans her room, cares for her many animals<br/>
and does the dishes after supper.  The 8yo voluntarily helps with the yard<br/>
and cares for his animals and helped me start all my seeds yesterday.  My<br/>
5yo loves to help cook, particularly cutting vegetables for salads.  My 3yo<br/>
enjoys the laundry.  My 2yo sets the table every evening.  These are things<br/>
the kids ASK to do.<br/>
