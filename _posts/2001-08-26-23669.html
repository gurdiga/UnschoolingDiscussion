<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132748181">I also wanted to clarify that the quote from the book was not from the<br/>
authors, though it&#39;s too bad they felt the need to include the part about<br/>
mothers.  They could have left that part out.  I&#39;ve thought about writing<br/>
a note to the authors to point out that the passage quoted sounded<br/>
exactly like school!  Other than that, I think it is a book worth<br/>
reading.  It was put together after doing two specials on the subject on<br/>
PBS.<br/>
