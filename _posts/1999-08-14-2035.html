keep her from posting these messages? I feel they are clogging up my mailbox and<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859218147">I thought there is a general agreement that one should stay on-topic on a list<br/>
related to a subject.  The temptation to go on at length about restorative<br/>
justice (my current passion) is great but I resist.  Anyone interested can<br/>
click on the website attached to my signature.  Perhaps Tanya could do<br/>
something similar for those causes she supports or email list members<br/>
individually to make her pitch for what may be outstanding causes.<br/>
<br/>
The interconnectedness of everything can lead to me telling you all about my<br/>
grandmothers collection of paper ephemera which I inherited (and another<br/>
passion).....however it stretches the boundaries a little much imo.<br/>

<br/>
Agreed, I was wondering if anyone else was noticing this. If I wanted to be<br/>
on a list that perpetuated this kind of e mail I would have joined &quot;spam r<br/>
us&quot; in the first place. What gets me is a month or so ago folks were<br/>
practically pinned to the wall for saying the &quot;C&quot; word in here even though<br/>
it has a remote relationship to unschooling (as in, we unschool, don&#39;t use<br/>
that stuff) but this random spam is so irrelevant as to be down right<br/>
irritating. Thanks for speaking up Lisa!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;1. You can email someone privately and discuss it.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Personally I thought something like this was the listowners responsibility.<br/>
I would be bothered to receive an unsolicited private e mail myself so I try<br/>
not to send them. It is a list issue so should be something we can discuss<br/>
as a list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; 2. You can ignore any emails with their name on them.<br/>
<br/>
 Joyce&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
True, and maybe the best solution for those of us who are bothered by it but<br/>
what if Tanya posted something meaningful to the group? We would be out of<br/>
the loop. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
