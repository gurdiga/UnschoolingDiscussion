<br/>
I&#39;ve really followed this thread with interest - simply because I<br/>
continuely have held the view that the single thing I feel least able to<br/>
handle in my parenting path is the intensity with which my children can be<br/>
so &#39;mean&#39; to one another and the powerlessness I feel sometimes during<br/>
these &#39;events.&#39; I have really absorbed the responses to the original post<br/>
and found several of them to be particularly heartfelt and potentially<br/>
effective. I have noticed, however, that there are ebbs and flows to the<br/>
negative interactions between my children and shifts in the dynamics at<br/>
various times. (With three of them . . .there are more possibilities for<br/>
combinations!) I wanted the original mom (Patti? . . . sorry, I don&#39;t<br/>
remember) to know that I truly believe this disheartening situation will<br/>
change, evolve and shift in time. And partly, that will it will be how she<br/>
views it and holds it in her consciousness. Not, that one should simply<br/>
wait . . . all the various suggestions are worthy of contemplation and<br/>
possible application . . . but it should cease to serve them someday. And,<br/>
I wonder does she get the feedback from other people how amazing her boys<br/>
are together when not with her? That one always gets me! . . . often people<br/>
comment on how devoted and caring and supportive my children are of each<br/>
other when elsewhere.  In all honesty, I see it too - many times - but<br/>
somehow the loud, argumentative, hostile, rude times make a huger<br/>
impression. My involvement always makes it worse if I am charged . . .<br/>
hence, I like Sandra&#39;s last suggestion. But, at times like that I like to<br/>
remember the adage - Energy flows where attention goes. <br/>
<br/>
Enough of my rambling. Perhaps I merely settled my own thoughts some.<br/>

In aloha,<br/>
