<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468653452">Sara: public television, paper and pencil, library,<br/>
seeds and dirt (yard or pot), your voice and your body<br/>
of knowledge, interacting with baby, watching the<br/>
weather (one year mine made a chart for prevailing<br/>
winds, her only tool being her wet finger), divided<br/>
attention (undivided attention being unrealistic,<br/>
never say &quot;I can&#39;t listen or talk to you now&quot;), go for<br/>
a short walk, visit a neighbor, learn that time brings<br/>
change.  Life is a constant education, each moment<br/>
brings important choices that affect the future, the<br/>
best of it is free and the rest can be extremely<br/>
inexpensive.  That&#39;s how we did it.<br/>
