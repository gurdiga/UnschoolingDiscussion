<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473076466">I know sometimes its hard to leave things unfinished, esp when its so <br/>
close to &quot;being done&quot; (in my son&#39;s case he just never went back, and <br/>
didnt say goodbye to anyone at the school, or even get his <br/>
stuff)....but i have to say that my only regret about pulling my son <br/>
out of school is that i waited so long to do it. <br/>

school in 4th grade and that was the thing she was anxious about <br/>
missing. That and 5th grade graduation &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
She got over it VERY quickly - got lots of other much more wonderful <br/>
camping in place of it. And then got Not-Back-to-School Camp when she <br/>
was older. An excellent trade-off. Make him an offer to compensate for <br/>
what he has to give up.<br/>

Cheese&#39;s at least once a month for lunch and play -- it&#39;s Fisher&#39;s <br/>
favorite place in the world.  I have to laugh when I compare it to <br/>
the usual school reward &quot;pizza party.&quot;<br/>
