 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m starting to thing potty training may be almost<br/>
&#39;genetic&#39;.  My mother thought my sister and I potty<br/>
trained early because we were naked most of the time. <br/>
I think mine potty trained early because they weren&#39;t.<br/>
 Almost from the day they were born I noticed they<br/>
would pee or poop almost as soon as I took their<br/>
diapers off (often before I had a chance to put the<br/>
new diaper under them.) Just since this discussion<br/>
have I realized that that is probably why they always<br/>
went on the potty when I put them on.  They were going<br/>
to go where ever because I took their diaper off and<br/>
they potty became a habit. But they probably would<br/>
have potty trained early no matter what I did because<br/>
it is sort of pre-programed that way for them. My<br/>
sister and I and our children all potty trained at<br/>
18-22 months - but my brother, who is adopted, didn&#39;t<br/>
potty train until he was about 3-3.5 and neither did<br/>
his children, which is what makes me wonder about some<br/>
sort of genetic connection.<br/>
