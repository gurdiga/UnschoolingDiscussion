<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356582689">It used to be that if there was a mention of homeschooling in the  <br/>
media ALL homeschoolers knew it within a day.<br/>
<br/>
Last Sunday, on CBS Sunday Morning (a 90 minute magazine show), there  <br/>
was a long piece on homeschooling and I haven&#39;t seen mention of it  <br/>
anywhere.  It was good!  I took notes and I don&#39;t know where they  <br/>
are, but a mom had taken a 14 year old boy out of school in NYC.   <br/>
African-American family.  She was a professor I think, but I guess  <br/>
had taken a leave of absence to homeschool him.  And at 16 he had  <br/>
been accepted to a school for the arts (he plays cello), so I guess  <br/>
Julliard but it might&#39;ve been another one; they didn&#39;t specify.<br/>
<br/>
Then they talked about Calvert curriculum and showed them loading  <br/>
boxes assembly-line style, and talked about how old Calvert is, and  <br/>
then they interviewed a dad who  has made a curriculum and is making  <br/>
tons of money.<br/>
<br/>
What I thought was cool is that they creditted the 60&#39;s and hippies  <br/>
for starting it, and then said something about John Holt probably  <br/>
(Honestly, I don&#39;t remember) and then said fundamentalist Christians  <br/>
came to homeschooling in droves after it was legal. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
VERY often it has been told from the Christian homeschooling  <br/>
perspective, where they take credit for ALL of homeschooling&#39;s  <br/>
existence and legality, and then throw in a snarky comment on non- <br/>
Christians who jumped on their pristine bandwagon.<br/>
<br/>
So this one was closer to objective than any major story I&#39;ve ever seen.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t about unschooling, but that&#39;s fine.<br/>

Thanks!!<br/>
<br/>
The proof of progress, I thought, was that something can be on like  <br/>
that and the homeschoolers don&#39;t all run hooting like monkeys.  It&#39;s  <br/>
common now for people to know about homeschooling.  So that&#39;s  <br/>
progress.  Or maybe it wasn&#39;t being mentioned much because it wasn&#39;t  <br/>
all about conservative politics. &lt;g&gt;  (American reference only...)<br/>
