<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887253415"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Ah ha! Finally someone who, like me, eats in front of the computer, often<br/>
&gt; while reading here!<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been known to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner while reading at the<br/>
&gt; computer depending on if I&#39;m eating alone and if my dh is home, in which<br/>
&gt; case I defnitely eat with him.<br/>
&gt; Anyone else do this?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well sure.  I think the most difficult food is hot chicken wings, with all <br/>
that eat, wipe, drink, type going on.<br/>
