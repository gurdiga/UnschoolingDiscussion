<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What do the rest of you do for *me* time? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see a massage therapist every Thursday morning. I *could* spend that money <br/>
on a housekeeper or a WHOLE lot of chocolate or maybe a little less wine! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
But it&#39;s what keeps me up and loose and happy. I&#39;ve tried to forego it; I&#39;m <br/>
miserable. Going on weekly for eight years in December.<br/>
<br/>
But I have older kids. And I never had two &#39;littluns&quot; at the same time (eight <br/>
years in between mine). Ben occasionally takes the boys camping or visiting <br/>
his mom for the weekend. So I get several days alone. I like to be by myself, <br/>
so it&#39;s nice.  And he gets the boys without me. That&#39;s good for them too.<br/>
<br/>
But as they get older, they *require* your presence less and less (not that <br/>
they don&#39;t NEED you! &lt;G&gt;), so enjoying what you&#39;ve got when you&#39;ve got it is a <br/>
healthy way to look at it. They&#39;ll soon want to do so much on their own--and <br/>
you&#39;ll get PLENTY of alone time *then*! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cameron&#39;s best friend died in a bus accident when they were five. A day <br/>
hasn&#39;t gone by in ten years that I haven&#39;t thought of Jacob&#39;s mom, Lisa. Whenever I <br/>
start to feel &quot;put upon&quot; by one or both of the boys, a quick glimpse into how <br/>
I would feel without one of them QUICKLY puts things into perspective. I <br/>
*can* give just a little more. I *can* do just a little more. What in the world <br/>
would I do without them?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;would I do without them?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is so true, Kelly.  My second son died from meningitis when he was<br/>
12mos 22days old three years ago.  It is amazing how much I think about him<br/>
and miss him everyday.  And I thank G*d that I had Connor to wake up to and<br/>
had a reason to get out of bed every morning.  I felt completely lost for<br/>
the longest time because I didn&#39;t have this little person running around<br/>
signing for &quot;more&quot;.  Now I have another little blessing running around<br/>
signing for &quot;more&quot;.  At the time, I felt like I had been robbed.  And now,<br/>
with Quinn, it&#39;s like I have been given back what was taken away from me<br/>
three years ago.  Babies are such blessings and create such a bright spot in<br/>
our lives.<br/>
