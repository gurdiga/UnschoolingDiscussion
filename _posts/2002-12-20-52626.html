&lt;&lt;    I wonder <br/>
 what started, &quot; you have to wait an hour to swim after eating&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Probably taking information that is good to follow if you&#39;re actually working <br/>
out, and then applying it to anyone in the water.<br/>
Blood goes to the stomache area during digestion. This could be troublesome <br/>
if you&#39;re trying to work out as the muscles need more blood. It leads to <br/>
cramping.<br/>
I bet people were swimming laps and getting cramps, so people started saying <br/>
you shouldn&#39;t swim for an hour after eating. Actually, you shouldn&#39;t eat <br/>
right before working out, that&#39;s all. And every person is different, so some <br/>
people could!!<br/>
It&#39;s all about knowing your own body.<br/>

&quot;Knowledge will not always take the place of simple observation.&quot;<br/>
