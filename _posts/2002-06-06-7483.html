<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992168091">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
The reason I finally took the leap of faith and began unschooling three months ago was because I realized that life holds no guarantees, and I didn&#39;t want to waste time focusing on the future at the expense of today.  I wanted to enjoy life TODAY, as you never really know how much time you have together as a family.  Ironically, as soon as I made this decision, my oldest daughter, then 13, came down with a virus.  The symptoms never went away, and after various guesses and many tests, we finally have a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia.  I won&#39;t go into the details, but it is a chronic illness, and my daughter has been bedridden for three months now.  I have three other children, ages 10, 7, and 2.  I have been focusing much of my time and energy trying to make sure their life is as normal as possible.  Fortunately, my 14 year old daughter can be left home alone for a few hours at a time, and my husband works close to home.  So as long as we take our cell phones, I can still get out of the house sometimes with the other kids.  <br/>
<br/>
If I stand outside the situation, and look at it objectively, I can see that everything will work out in the end, and that unschooling will still be successful.  But I can&#39;t always look at it that way, and I am very worried.  I am not free to be with my kids in the way I would want to be.  My first challenge is having a two year old!  Although she won&#39;t be two forever, for now, it hinders many activities.  Next challenge is having to spend some time on the computer each day doing research on Fibromyalgia.  It is a fairly newly recognized illness, with no known cause or cure.  There is laundry, and general clean up. Then of course I do need to spend time with my oldest daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I am not really providing the type of environment I would want for my kids.  Some days I don&#39;t even get a chance to read to them.  Since we are still new to unschooling, and the other freedoms I have given as an extension of the unschooling way of life, such as TV and Gameboy, etc.., they do spend much of their day watching TV.  My 7 year old son loves TV so much, and is sure that at any moment I will take away his freedom.  He can hardly be distracted, even to see a snake in our yard or tadpoles growing legs and becoming frogs!  I have read all the posts on TV, and I do trust that this is ok.  What I don&#39;t like is that I cannot watch it with him.  Maybe for a few minutes a day, but mostly he is on his own if he chooses to watch TV.  This does not feel good to me.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are not complaining about how their day plays out.  Maybe it would have been the same, even if my oldest wasn&#39;t sick. Maybe this is deschooling in action.  <br/>
<br/>
I know my kids are learning things, such as compassion for the ill, and all about Fibromyalgia.  But I envisioned being able to offer them the world, and I can&#39;t.  We are very limited now in what we can do.  I spend about one hour a day with them. (When we are home)  I&#39;m with them more than that, but REALLY there and paying attention - about an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Can this still work?  Do others have days where your kids are pretty much unattended for most of the day?  Maybe I just need to make sure we get out of the house more.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice or comments on unschooling life with a chronically ill child would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Lisa<br/>

<br/>
Can he watch in the room where your 14 year old is?  Then she would have <br/>
company, HE would have company (and someone to discuss the stories and art <br/>
and songs with), and you would have less guilt.   Holly loves Arthur, and I&#39;m <br/>
glad she has two friends who do too, because they talk about it in detail.  <br/>
&quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Did you notice...&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Yes it can.  Yes those days happen.<br/>
I think getting out is a great thing, myself.  And not even out to something <br/>
fancy.  Just out to the sky and  street you&#39;ve never driven down can be <br/>
sufficient news to stimulate thought and discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had a chronically ill child, but if she&#39;s up to interaction with <br/>
the other kids (one at a time?) or watching videos or TV, or whatever with <br/>
another kid, it seems two birds with one stone.<br/>

He does at times, watch with her.  But I never thought how this could give Tiffany a feeling of purpose. With all she now can&#39;t do, she can start thinking about things she CAN do!<br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;m not sure that the frustration you&#39;re experiencing is entirely the<br/>
result of your daughter&#39;s illness.  I feel some of the same frustrations<br/>
with 4 perfectly healthy kids.  Some of mine is due to my being less<br/>
organized than I should be, and much of it is due to the vast number of<br/>
activities my kids participate in.  Some days are great, some days I<br/>
feel like I don&#39;t do near enough with my kids and that the months are<br/>
slipping away from us way too fast.  But my kids still get so many great<br/>
things out of the life that we lead that I try not to guilt trip too<br/>
much that it isn&#39;t as perfect as I&#39;d like.  And I think that if things<br/>
are really going in a direction that makes you feel entirely<br/>
uncomfortable, something that you can&#39;t predict right now will happen to<br/>
change your routines and take you in a different direction.  This is<br/>
what I figure with our activity schedule.  Sometimes it makes me<br/>
uncomfortable, but if it&#39;s not meant to be, it will change.  A kid will<br/>
lose interest in something, or we&#39;ll run out of money, or a better<br/>
opportunity will come along, or a conflict will intervene, or one of my<br/>
little gymnasts will sprain something.  Not that I&#39;m wishing for<br/>
injuries, but I think that things end up taking the turns they need to<br/>
take.  I&#39;m not a religious person at all, but do think that life happens<br/>
the way it&#39;s supposed to.  You sound like you and your kids will be fine<br/>
in the end.  Enjoy what you can, and don&#39;t feel guilty about the rest.<br/>
And I have to take a kid to the gym now!<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re right.  I suspect there will always be lazy days, sick child or not.  And nothing is ever perfect.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m not a religious person at all, but do think that life happens<br/>
the way it&#39;s supposed to&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a point I&#39;m trying to get across to Tiffany.  Even though she is ill, I feel there must be a reason for it, and something good will come out of it.  The challenge is to find out &quot;how to make lemonade from the lemons she was given.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Lisa, could you put her bed in the living room?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve made a deal that she spend a few hours each day in the family room, where she can still rest on the couch.  This way she is still interacting with the family, and avoiding some mental atrophy that might occur shut up in her room by herself.  Her happiest moments are when the 2 year old comes to snuggle!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the input.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-824075222">Dear Lisa,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Life is what happens when you are making other<br/>
plans.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Someone please assist on the author.  I love that<br/>
quote, but am terrible at remembering where I picked<br/>
up all the trinkets of wisdom that swirl in my mind.<br/>
(Maybe, John Lennon.)<br/>
<br/>
That pretty much sums it up.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t underestimate the level of compassion their<br/>
sister&#39;s illness gives the rest of the family an<br/>
opportunity to develop.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I can&#39;t think of a greater trait to<br/>
nurture.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us deal with some type of &quot;issue&quot; that impedes<br/>
us from living out our &quot;perfect unschooler&quot; vision. <br/>
<br/>
Money is a big one.  Wouldn&#39;t we all like to travel<br/>
&#39;round the world with our children?<br/>
<br/>
I have 4. It is not fiscally possible.<br/>
<br/>
Time.  Many unschool parents must work.  Laundry and<br/>
dishes and cleaning all take time. Especially for<br/>
unschoolers who extrapolate not requiring chores as a<br/>
feature of the freedom they grant their children.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s dandy if you have 1 or 2 children. <br/>
More than that and it becomes a physical<br/>
impossibility.  Family chores must be shared among<br/>
able family members.  I think that assuming<br/>
responsibility is a Good Thing.  How else do we learn?<br/>
<br/>
The idea of parent/tutor is a lovely and romantic one.<br/>
 I guess there are some households that are actually<br/>
able to pull this off.  If mom gets up at 5 am to do<br/>
all the cruddy housework and chores and can still<br/>
manage to put on a happy face when she serves the hot<br/>
breakfast at 8:30, followed by a day devoted to the<br/>
individual pursuits of an only child ...   Well, what<br/>
child wouldn&#39;t feel they&#39;d hit the jackpot?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they&#39;d end up completely egocentric and<br/>
unappreciative of what was made to appear so<br/>
effortless.<br/>
<br/>
For me, &quot;unschooler&quot; is simply a word that I apply to<br/>
denote those in my household who must be legally<br/>
documented- those 7-16 years old who are not attending<br/>
school.  We are all just Living.  Living our lives to<br/>
the fullest each and every day.  Some days are<br/>
better-more enjoyable- than others.  Some days you&#39;d<br/>
like to get a re-do on.  <br/>
<br/>
Our outside activities used to be severely compromised<br/>
by my youngest son.  He had Severe ADHD. (I have no<br/>
interest in going into that debate.)  Suffice it to<br/>
say, he is my 3rd son and he was not &quot;normal&quot; in<br/>
comparison to the other 2 ...  or any other child you<br/>
could comfortably take out in public.<br/>
<br/>
But, he is part of the family and so we all had to<br/>
make adjustments.  We did things at home.  We did as<br/>
much as we could at home.  I arranged for the other 2<br/>
to do things with friends and family.  I took them<br/>
places when their dad was home.  Or, he took them<br/>
places. <br/>
<br/>
If we HAD to go somewhere, Dr&#39;s, etc...   I would try<br/>
to time it right and hold my breath that we didn&#39;t<br/>
pick a &quot;bad&quot; day.<br/>
<br/>
This was our life from the time he was 2-9.  He&#39;ll be<br/>
10 next month and the severity of the behaviors has<br/>
lessened dramatically.  Thank Goodness.  <br/>
<br/>
I assume since you are posting here that you have<br/>
internet access.<br/>
<br/>
The whole world is right here.  No library in the<br/>
world has better research capabilities than the web.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also a great place for kids to connect with<br/>
others who share their interests.  (Supervised of<br/>
course)<br/>
<br/>
Do what you can and forget about what you can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
No positive results will come from your torturing<br/>
yourself over  the idyllic unschool family you&#39;d like<br/>
to be.<br/>
<br/>
And take comfort; they don&#39;t exist anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you give yourself permission to do the best<br/>
that you can each day,  plan activities/outings that<br/>
are doable within your present life situation, and<br/>
RELAX, you&#39;ll be fine.<br/>
<br/>
I would try checking out local homeschool support<br/>
groups.  You might be able to find another family with<br/>
various ages/interests  that you can trade off with. <br/>
An older sibling might enjoy the company of your<br/>
daughter while the mom could take your younger ones<br/>
for awhile.  <br/>
<br/>
There are endless opportunities, options and<br/>
possibilities- once you let go of the one- that isn&#39;t<br/>
available to you.<br/>
<br/>
That letting go is the hard part.  I know that.<br/>
<br/>
Especially as unschoolers, (that weird little minority<br/>
of the already weird-enough  ; b  homeschooler<br/>
population), we pressure ourselves to make it all<br/>
&quot;work&quot;.  To be daily examples of &quot;the wonder of<br/>
learning&quot;, etc...<br/>
<br/>
I think that the better you are at forgetting about<br/>
the label, &quot;unschooler&quot; ...  <br/>
<br/>
And remembering that this is your life   ...  Every<br/>
day is a new opportunity to be what you came to this<br/>
planet to be- Which is Completely up to you to decide<br/>
and act on-<br/>
<br/>
The more the Joyful and Abundant Opportunities will<br/>
present themselves.<br/>
<br/>
They are there.  Don&#39;t be afraid to let go of your<br/>
plans and embrace Life as it happens.<br/>

better-more enjoyable- than others.  Some days you&#39;d<br/>
like to get a re-do on.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
This is a concept I didn&#39;t grow up with myself, even the fantasy idea that <br/>
you could &quot;rewind&quot; a day.<br/>
<br/>
My kids, though, play Harvest Moon, where at the end of the day you choose <br/>
whether to write in your diary or not.  &quot;Writing in the diary&quot; is just saving <br/>
the game at that point.  If you choose &quot;no,&quot; then you go to sleep, wake up, <br/>
and it&#39;s the same day again.  If you choose &quot;yes&quot; then the points you made or <br/>
lost, the livestock that you gained or lost, whatever happened &quot;really <br/>
happened&quot; and the game continues.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure they have thought sometimes of not saving one of their real days.<br/>
<br/>
Even with the fantasy switch in their heads, even though it doesn&#39;t work, I <br/>
bet it does sometimes make them more careful about their choices.<br/>

My heart goes out to you and your daughter. I have been living with <br/>
Fibromyalgia since I was about her age. Unfortunately, I was 21 <br/>
before I was diagnosed.<br/>
<br/>
I think the main thing that keeps me going is that I WANT TO LIVE! <br/>
not just exist. So I continue doing everything that I want to do, <br/>
within my limitations. I often Thank God that I had developed it when <br/>
I was young, since I grew up learning to cope with it. I find that <br/>
people who develop it later in life have more difficulty adjusting in <br/>
the long run (as a general rule, everyone is different.)<br/>
<br/>
I was the editor for the Canadian Fibromyalgia Society&#39;s newsletter <br/>
for two years before it lost it&#39;s funding and became defunct. If <br/>
there is anything I can help you with please feel free to contact me <br/>
off-line. I still have many back issues of the newsletter.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read any of Devin Starlanyl&#39;s books? <br/>
<br/>
Try to get your daughter as active as she is capable of. Immobility <br/>
of body and brain are detrimental to the sufferer of Fibromyalgia. <br/>
Also watch for signs of depression, as this is common with any <br/>
chronic illness.<br/>

Today, my 10 year old daughter, who never felt she measured up academically when I was that strict school at home mom, wrote a beautiful poem for her sister.  Not that I&#39;m looking for something so blatantly academic; I&#39;m commenting on the fact that she felt good about herself and her accomplishment, and I learned that days, weeks, months can go by when I imagine days are wasted, and then this...a wonderful, heartfelt poem showing compassion and caring!<br/>

I am so confused about this.  She says she cannot get out of bed because it makes her hurt more, yet we keep getting advice to get her moving.  I don&#39;t want to force her, or make her upset.  Today I called the doc and asked for pain meds to give occasionally, when she has an appointment.  Maybe this will help her try to get up.<br/>

&gt; smoothly in other families.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The summer before my father died, when he was very ill and we were caring<br/>
for him at home, was anything but smooth.  My son was eight and I also<br/>
had my three nieces here, nine, ten and thirteen.  <br/>
<br/>
There was rarely time, money or chance to go anywhere, but when we got an<br/>
hour, go we did.  Walking, bike riding,  just out for a soda.  The oldest<br/>
girl didn&#39;t mind looking out for the younger kids, for short periods, and<br/>
would take them swimming, or over to the creek.  We found a trampoline at<br/>
a garage sale and what a wonderful diversion that turned out to be.  We<br/>
set up the tent in the back yard so anyone who couldn&#39;t stand to listen<br/>
to a sick person anymore could escape.  <br/>
We took the small TV / VCR out there and a portable stereo.   The kids<br/>
often ate their dinner out there.  The girls are my husbands sister&#39;s<br/>
children, so they were not comfortable around my father.  But Dylan would<br/>
read to him, tell stories, draw new pictures for him every few days.  He<br/>
painted a garden on an old bed sheet and hung it on the wall, since my<br/>
dad couldn&#39;t get outside.   My father was a gardener and Dylan would tell<br/>
him what was growing, which bugs were out, what was blooming.   <br/>
We really tried to pay attention to what the kids needed and my husband<br/>
would take them to movies on the weekend, or out kite flying.   We<br/>
worried that they were having a lousy time, but they came back the next<br/>
summer with fond memories and they&#39;ll be here again in four days.  ( Oh<br/>
dear! )  <br/>
Kids are so adaptable.  If you don&#39;t despair and if you meet their needs<br/>
the best you can, they won&#39;t remember a horrible summer when their sister<br/>
was sick, they&#39;ll remember how cool it was to picnic in the back yard, or<br/>
stay up late with you watching video&#39;s.   It really will work out ok.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a beautician here in town who will come to the home&#39;s of people<br/>
who are ill and give them make overs.  Maybe your daughter would like<br/>
something like that?   Maybe you&#39;re other children and/or extra kids from<br/>
the neighborhood would like to put on plays for her, or build puppets for<br/>
puppet shows?  Dylan did a Bing Crosby show for my dad once, maybe your<br/>
daughter would like to see Madonna,(or whoever ) LIVE, in concert, if you<br/>
can find some Madonna clothes (yeah, like everyone has pointy boobs lying<br/>
around ). Or a rap concert!   Rap lyrics are really fun.  I don&#39;t know if<br/>
she&#39;s on a special diet, but maybe the other kids would like to make<br/>
interesting foods for her.  I&#39;m not sure how you make a Britney Spears<br/>
(sp?)  --man I&#39;m old --  cake, but I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s possible.  <br/>
<br/>
Hang in there. <br/>

One of the worst times for people with Fibro is getting up in the <br/>
morning. (or anytime after lying or sitting for extended periods).<br/>
<br/>
When I was nineteen, I had to crawl into the bathroom in the <br/>
mornings, because I couldn&#39;t put any weight on my feet. Then I would <br/>
take a warm bath to get my circulation going and my muscles relaxed.<br/>
<br/>
I still hate getting up in the morning. I need to brace myself up <br/>
against the wall and hobble around. However, it is very important <br/>
that I do get up. <br/>
<br/>
Try to encourage her to focus on other things besides the pain. I <br/>
know it is very hard, because the pain is overwhelming. Let her know <br/>
that this is only one aspect of her. It does not define her. <br/>
<br/>
The first few months after onset can be the most difficult because no <br/>
one can understand the level of pain she is suffering, and she can <br/>
feel so helpless. With any chronic illness, there is a grieving <br/>
process that needs to be addressed. Encourage her to find her passion <br/>
for life again. It is a vital part of coping with any chronic <br/>
condition.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and my prayers are with you.<br/>

<br/>
I usually use my walker to pull myself from bed.<br/>
Sometimes I avoid going to bed so that I don&#39;t have to<br/>
get up!!  But I don&#39;t recommend :-) The pain barrier<br/>
is really hard to break!  However, often it DOES get <br/>
better after an hour or so...after I get distracted<br/>
from myself....for me that is the best way to deal<br/>
with chronic pain...to remove yourself from it as much<br/>
as you can. Think about other things, other people,<br/>
ideas outside of ones own body. Doing, thinking,<br/>
creating, laughing.......and yes, a pain med to help<br/>
over a hump, because sometimes the pain is too<br/>
demanding to even attempt to ignore and there are<br/>
things to be done anyway.  Like living. :-)  And<br/>
everybody else has their lives, too.<br/>
<br/>
Chronic pain uses up the serotin and causes stress<br/>
hormones to be released and  some other unfortunate<br/>
stuff too.  If the depression evolves too far, it can<br/>
be as debilitating as physical pain. And a body get<br/>
trapped by inactivity.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know your daughter or the particulars of her<br/>
illness, but if your healers (docs, holistic, or<br/>
whoever) say that she won&#39;t actually be damaged by<br/>
activity....they she NEEDS to be as active as she can.<br/>
<br/>
It is so much easier to keep muscle tone to to have to<br/>
acquire it.<br/>
<br/>
And you, Mama, how are you holding up?  Do you ever<br/>
get to sleep, yourself? Or read a book for the fun of<br/>
it? Is there any time left to take care of yourself?<br/>

&gt;moving.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It can be really hard to find the balance.  (I&#39;m still working on it.)  It <br/>
*is* important to move, but it&#39;s also important to listen to your <br/>
body.  For your daughter, it might start out as simple exercises done in <br/>
bed, *very* gently and gradually.  It might start, as I think you said, <br/>
with just getting out of bed and spending some time in the family room each <br/>
day.  It might mean walking up and down the hall once before settling on <br/>
the couch.  Then after a week or so, it might mean twice up and down the <br/>
hall.<br/>
When I was first diagnosed, I started using the rebounder.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
actually jump.  I still don&#39;t.  I just genly bounced on it for several <br/>
minutes.  I gradually increased the time until I could do 15 or 20 <br/>
minutes.  Then I hit the wall.  That&#39;s all I can do.  The distance I can <br/>
walk doesn&#39;t change either, even when I walk every day.  She&#39;ll have to <br/>
find her personal wall.<br/>
I&#39;ve found for myself that I can accomplish quite a bit if I vary my <br/>
activities and space the physical work throughout the day.  It&#39;s hard to <br/>
get a feel for that at first.  This spring I was trying to beat the weeds <br/>
to the strawberries.  (Actually I was trying to find them among the weeds <br/>
before they finished blooming.)  I would work till I was tired and then <br/>
push it a little longer.  Then I was completely wiped and in pain for the <br/>
day.  That would take maybe 30 minutes.  Lately I&#39;ve been quitting <br/>
gardening or housework sooner, at the first sign of tiredness.  I&#39;m finding <br/>
that doing it that way lets me put in 3 or 4 sessions in a day.  I also am <br/>
unable to think clearly for more than a couple of hours at a time.  So I <br/>
alternate short (15-20 minutes) of activity with an hour or two at the <br/>
computer and/or practising my instruments.  It seems to be working, and I&#39;m <br/>
getting more accomplished than I have in years.<br/>
You have to be especially careful of exercise if the diagnosis is or could <br/>
be chronic fatigue syndrome as well as fibro.  Many people with CFS are <br/>
exercise-intolerant, and even a little too much can send them into a major <br/>
flare.  Your daughter really needs to learn how to listen to her own <br/>
body.  You can help by gently nudging her to try the gentlest forms of <br/>
exercise and find her own limits, then keep gently pushing them.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
A person with fms can suffer for days or even weeks if they push themselves<br/>
too hard for one afternoon.  Since it affects different people in such<br/>
drastically different ways it is really important for the person who has the<br/>
fms to learn to gauge how much she can do at any given moment.  Of course,<br/>
that&#39;s something that can only be learned over time, and by listening to the<br/>
signals that her body sends her.  For me, personally, if I push through my<br/>
&quot;pain barrier&quot; I end up not sleeping *at all* for up to a week, my word<br/>
recall abilities drop, every thing I pick up drops, my pain level<br/>
skyrockets, and I spend the next week or two trying to get back to &quot;normal&quot;.<br/>
I&#39;m much better off stopping before I reach that point.  It probably took me<br/>
2 years to figure out where that point is for me.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, she should be as active as she *can*, but I certainly wouldn&#39;t tell<br/>
her to push through her pain.   ~Rue<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Seems that I was encouraging you to push too hard to<br/>
overcome that initial inertia.  I&#39;m sorry.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean do jumping jacks....I meant, learn how<br/>
to roll-over with minimal discomfort....as there seems<br/>
to be no way to avoid discomfort all together....and<br/>
get positioned so she can watch cartoons or Mickey<br/>
Blue Eyes or Maverick or ? pet the cat, cuddle the 2<br/>
year old, maybe even read to the little one after a<br/>
while. Hold a beverage to sip on. That is the pain<br/>
barrier I meant.  The one that is so bad you feel you<br/>
can&#39;t get up, even though you know you muscles should<br/>
work, if you can just figure out HOW.<br/>
<br/>
You are all in my prayers.<br/>
Thank you for all that you have done<br/>
Sharon of the Swamp<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-147736672">Oh Rue, you certainly didn&#39;t say anything that needed<br/>
apologizing for!  Thank you for be gentle with my<br/>
feelings too...thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I love email.  I would never have had contact with ANY<br/>
of you without it.  Just a hermit out here in the<br/>
woods :-)  I&#39;m GLAD when my posts are corrected, when<br/>
mistaken or poorly worded, or enhanced, added to,<br/>
clarified, or best of all....when my posts actually<br/>
contribute something :-) to a discussion.<br/>
<br/>
So.  Thank you again for clarifying....it was needed.<br/>
Please don&#39;t be afraid to do that whenever you see the<br/>
need. My feelings certainly won&#39;t be hurt.<br/>
<br/>
I am experiencing language deficits. Drives me nuts<br/>
(enough to be noticed beyond my normal eccentricity).<br/>
Oh well. I do tend to run on.<br/>
<br/>
I am SO grateful that my older children didn&#39;t have to<br/>
experience fibromylagia or MS or CFS or anything like<br/>
it as children. Knock on wood.  Roy is only 8.<br/>
That would be MUCH harder than being ill oneself. I<br/>
had friends who lost children to terminal illness or<br/>
accidents. Those Mama&#39;s suffered, in their health,<br/>
much more than I ever do.  My own worst times are when<br/>
I have to tell Roy, that I just can&#39;t do it....I feel<br/>
so ashamed then, and I pray, inside, that Roy learns<br/>
compassion rather than feeling deprived. Though I fear<br/>
it is both.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway. Thanks.<br/>

I have long-term health problems due to a neurological trauma.  My symptoms <br/>
include fatigue, cognitive/memory problems, and chronic, severe pain, among <br/>
other things.  I can relate to everything you have said.  I hate having to <br/>
explain to the kids why mama can&#39;t do something they want me to do.  They <br/>
rush and tumble over themselves to reassure me that &quot;that&#39;s okay, mom - <br/>
really!&quot;  Those sweet little reassurances that they &quot;don&#39;t mind&quot; make me feel <br/>
worse than anything!  On one hand I admire their compassion and patience.  On <br/>
the other hand, I cringe to think about their disappointment and worry.  I&#39;m <br/>
glad this topic has come up on the list.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Sharon.  What you might not have noticed is that I mostly just read <br/>
posts when I&#39;m resting.  I answer or comment on the easy stuff.  Things I <br/>
want to think about before answering get saved for morning, when I can <br/>
think most clearly.  That&#39;s also when I do my writing work, though I&#39;ve <br/>
been pretty unmotivated for that lately.  (might have something to do with <br/>
being caught up in Jean Auel&#39;s latest book - grin)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, none of my children have epilepsy, but I do have a seizure disorder.  <br/>
My son also takes anti-seizure drugs (for a different purpose).  So I do have <br/>
a pretty good understanding about how seizure disorder, and the meds used to <br/>
treat it, can affect one&#39;s life.  I&#39;ll be happy to tell you anything I know!  <br/>
