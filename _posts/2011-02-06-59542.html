<div id="ygrps-yiv-143919684">“our babies/ourselves” by meredith small and “attachment parenting” by katie allison granju – I have read the former and not the latter, so the second title is not a specific endorsement...<br/>
our babies ourselves has the full title of “Our Babies Ourselves - How Biology and Culture Shape the Way We Parent”<br/>
<br/>
some other books not specifically about parenting practices, but about attachment and the science of it, and the intersection between that and parenting are:<br/>
<br/>
“A General Theory of Love” by thomas lewis and “Touching” by Ashley Montague<br/>
<br/>
There are also a lot of articles on the subject:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep05102183.pdf">http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep05102183.pdf</a> – evolutionary psychology: back to basics infant care’<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.drmomma.org/2009/11/science-of-attachment-biological-roots.html">http://www.drmomma.org/2009/11/science-of-attachment-biological-roots.html</a> – science of attachment – the biological roots of love<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://naturalchild.org/articles/attachment_parenting.html">http://naturalchild.org/articles/attachment_parenting.html</a>  the attachment parenting collection of articles on “the natural child” web site<br/>
<br/>
are just a few.<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps!<br/>
