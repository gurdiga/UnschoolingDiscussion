Even when when we were able to start our own small homeschooler troop <br/>
(just three moms and three Brownies) iIt was still too official and <br/>
officious for my personal comfort -- the paperwork and forms and fees <br/>
and &quot;assignments&quot; and schedules were annoying and pointless to DD and <br/>
me, not to mention the emphasis on the cookie sale. (I *hate* <br/>
fundraising) <br/>

This is not to say the Scouts don&#39;t help many girls or that the <br/>
organization doesn&#39;t deserve support or that Scouts can&#39;t have fun, <br/>
only that I personally felt boxed in by it and much prefer child-led <br/>
exploration rather than Scout-led exploration. :)  JJ<br/>

One thing to keep in mind is that Girl Scouts activities are SUPPOSED to be <br/>
girl-planned. I recognize that doesn&#39;t always happen.<br/>
