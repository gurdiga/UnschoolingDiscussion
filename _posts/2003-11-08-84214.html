My 11yo has just strated chaging her clothes several times a day and is <br/>
now being fussy about what she wears. One of her friends told her she <br/>
was ugly and unfashionable so I now have to deal with daily meltdowns <br/>
about what she&#39;s going to put on when she used to throw on any old <br/>
thing. Money is tight yet she feels she has to have nice clothes to be <br/>
&#39;accepted&#39;. Grrrrr<br/>

That&#39;s so sad. She&#39;s really lovely, smart, and very nice and interesting. <br/>
Julian and I had a great time sharing lunch with her in South Carolina.<br/>
