<div id="ygrps-yiv-999816925">We went to Harry Potter at 11:55 this morning. Had to see the first showing! <br/>
It wasn&#39;t crowded---maybe twenty people. Only one other child. <br/>
<br/>
Duncan, six, was sooo excited. We bought out the concession stand---popcorn <br/>
and candy and cokes--and settled in to watch. Duncan sat in the front row; <br/>
the rest of us were further back. Ben went up to sit with Duncan about <br/>
halfway through after Ben came back from the restroom. Afterwards, as we were <br/>
leaving, Ben quietly told me that Duncan had peed his pants! He&#39;d said, &quot;Dad, <br/>
it&#39;s just too good. I didn&#39;t want to miss a THING!&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So GO! It&#39;s so good you&#39;ll pee in your pants! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
But I wouldn&#39;t sit in the front row! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
BTW, Duncan was in no way embarrassed! He was just TOO thrilled to be there <br/>
to be worried about wet britches!</div>

 </span></blockquote>That is SOOOO cool, Kelly!!  Liam did something like that at the movies, <br/>
too.  I think it was Star Wars.  He had absolutely no shame about it at <br/>
all.  I&#39;m so glad he and you had a good time.  I beginning to think that <br/>
shame is a learned response.  I&#39;m glad that Duncan and Liam haven&#39;t learned <br/>
it, at least not about peeing in their pants.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-367735721">My kids are so depressed as we won&#39;t get it here until maybe sometime in<br/>
January! But at least by then we can go to the movies during the day and<br/>
actually eat popcorn (it&#39;s ramadan here so no food or drink during daylight).<br/>
<br/>
But they are scanning the souks for bootleg dvd of it (friends already have<br/>
it). Still it&#39;s not the same as the big screen.<br/>
