<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373325891">Julie, so glad your last 18 months has been more than you expected.  <br/>
Mine have too!  My dh, mom and dad talk about our last 12 months <br/>
pretty much weekly.<br/>
<br/>
I did want to add an offshoot to Sandra&#39;s comment about school kids <br/>
deciding something was &#39;stupid&#39;, even if the subject was near to <br/>
heart for another kid and being made to feel little for loving the <br/>
subject (paraphrased of course).  A few weeks ago, my 11yo dd was <br/>
considering going to summer school with her school buddies just to <br/>
basically hang out and be with them.  Then one mentioned that my dd <br/>
would have to take reading and math along with the fun classes, and <br/>
math in middle school was HARD.  When she shared this conversation <br/>
with me I could honestly see the angst on this kids face.  It made me <br/>
cry inside, you see, because her dad and I were both math teachers, <br/>
him in hs and I in ms.  I told her that the middle school math in <br/>
summer school was really not that hard.  She said that I would say <br/>
that because I had taught it.  I told her fair enough, but let me <br/>
tell you about the math I taught in middle school last summer (a <br/>
month before they fired me).  The kids were given a materials list <br/>
(toothpicks, 10 cents apiece and clay, some amount per square inch) <br/>
and were instructed to build a building yea high.  They were also <br/>
given a budget to come in under.  They only had two days to do this, <br/>
although many really got into it and would really have benefitted <br/>
from more TIME to make mistakes and explore, we had to move on <br/>
(different thread).  I then asked my dd if this didn&#39;t sound like <br/>
much of what she did this whole year on her own.  She said yes, but <br/>
she thought there would be multiplication tables involved and I <br/>
didn&#39;t TEACH that to her this year (she looked ready to cry this <br/>
time).  I told her that that wasn&#39;t something she communicated to me <br/>
she wanted to LEARN.  Then I listed the &#39;mathy&#39; things she did do, <br/>
Zoombinis (for unlimited hours and is better at it than me!), <br/>
Backyard baseball (studying statistics to build strong teams), Math <br/>
Shop (obvious), building her treehouse, planning and having yard <br/>
sales to buy stereo equipment, cooking with me, helping me plan and <br/>
buy for the family meals, sewing 9 block quilts and arranging the <br/>
squares so they are visually appealing and so on.  I then told her <br/>
that the math she DID do this year may not have been with paper and <br/>
pencil like her peers, but it WAS math that she would never forget, <br/>
enjoyed, wasn&#39;t afraid of and that put her ahead of her peers, maybe <br/>
not now, but down the road when they&#39;re still afraid of math, she <br/>
won&#39;t have any problems.  I also told her if she wanted to practice <br/>
her multiplication tables, I would do that with her too.  So far she <br/>
hasn&#39;t.  Just ticks me off that these turkeys scared my baby like <br/>
that!</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh Sally, you touched a raw nerve here with me. I hope some of you who are more <br/>
experienced can address this. <br/>
<br/>
One of the things I saw with my kids is that their &quot;schooled&quot; peers *intimidate* them. <br/>
When schooled kids discuss their grades, projects, tests and &quot;hard&quot; classes, my kids <br/>
immediately see themselves as not capable of that kind of work (or at least show some <br/>
concern that they might not be). <br/>
<br/>
My daughter went to school part time partly (I think) to test the theory - to see if she could <br/>
keep up with her peers in a school setting. Turned out she did great! But I still hear her <br/>
saying that &quot;so-and-so&quot; is &quot;really smart&quot; because she&#39;s getting all As in her honors classes. <br/>
Grrrr.<br/>
<br/>
My son is convinced he can&#39;t &quot;cut it&quot; but he also cares about that a lot less than his sister.<br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t like is when I hear the schooled kids repeat the propaganda - &quot;You mean you <br/>
haven&#39;t studied ___________ in homeschool? But you have to to go to college&quot; or <br/>
&quot;_____________ is really important. You can&#39;t learn that at home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Grrrr.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

Be patient.<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron heard all that too. Thought he was stupid and was doomed to be a  <br/>
failure for the rest of his life.<br/>
 <br/>
Now those same kids who were needling him for &quot;goofing off&quot; are now DYING  to <br/>
be in his shoes. They&#39;ve pretty much blown off school----to the point that  <br/>
they probably CAN&#39;T get into college! Meanwhile he&#39;s blossomed into someone <br/>
he&#39;s  happy---no THRILLED! to be.<br/>
 <br/>
In fact, last weekend he bought himself a sarong! I&#39;m tickled PINK that  he&#39;s <br/>
comfortable enough with himself to do something so &quot;daring&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>

My husband wears a kakoi (at least that&#39;s how it sounds when he says it)<br/>
around the house and outside, which is basically an African version of a<br/>
sarong for men. It is a very soft woven cotton with some striping woven in<br/>
to the fabric. He was so pleased to find a mail order vendor online and now<br/>
has several new ones. His old one was from when he used to live in Africa<br/>
15+ years ago.<br/>
 <br/>
I had an old boyfriend quite a few years ago in Australia whose preferred<br/>
casual wear was also a sarong. He was a writer, screen printer, musician<br/>
hippy type artist and the sarong was just perfect for him. I have to say he<br/>
didn&#39;t generally wear it down the pub, but pretty much any place else, and<br/>
while doing his art work.<br/>

Send him over to Kauai . . . he would fit right in! Pretty much standard<br/>
casual wear - at least with those most comfortable with themselves . .<br/>
.very comfy after-surf wear!<br/>
