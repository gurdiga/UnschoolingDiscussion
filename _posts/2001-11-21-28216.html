I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;re hurting!<br/>
I was in an accident and suffered from severe<br/>
whiplash. I had hideous migraines several times a<br/>
month. My friend is a Reiki master and gave me Reiki<br/>
one. The migraines have now subsided to about 1 every<br/>
few months or so and are getting less and less<br/>
frequent. The great thing about Reiki for me is that I<br/>
can do it to myself at no cost anytime I feel the<br/>
signs of a migraine coming on. I don&#39;t even have to be<br/>
at home (I&#39;ve done it in a public restroom, my car,<br/>
etc.). Even if it doesn&#39;t make it go away completely,<br/>
the pain is much less intense after a treatment. The<br/>
other thing that helps me is an Ibuprofen (motrin) gel<br/>
that you rub into your skin. I get mine from the UK<br/>
(friends bring it to me) and I don&#39;t know if you can<br/>
get it here but your doctor may know of it. It&#39;s the<br/>
only med that I use or need when &#39;under attack&#39;. I<br/>
don&#39;t know if it would help with the nerve pain but it<br/>
works great on any muscle related pain.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I was in an accident 7 years ago and have nerve<br/>
damage and soft <br/>
tissue <br/>
problems in my back. I was on so many different meds<br/>
and had a bout w/ <br/>
ulcerative colitis and then a problem was caught 2<br/>
weeks before they <br/>
took my <br/>
one med off the market for killing people. Lovely.<br/>
Right now I have a <br/>
major <br/>
headache from my neck and my back is burning and<br/>
killing me, I&#39;ll be up <br/>
most <br/>
of the night. I refuse to take anything anymore<br/>
though. I only wish I <br/>
could <br/>
afford my therapies more than once a month. I would<br/>
feel 100 times <br/>
better w/ <br/>
weekly or more treatments for a period of time.<br/>
