<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017531946">Thank you to everyone who answered my questions about homeschooling <br/>
in California.  We were considering what it would take to move *if* <br/>
my husband found work there, so this was pretty early speculation.<br/>
I&#39;m not too big on the idea of change myself, especially since it <br/>
mostly falls to me to make it okay for my children who don&#39;t like <br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
Both my husband&#39;s family and mine are in the Chicago area, and we <br/>
have always thought that we might go back there eventually. When I <br/>
mentioned it again last night, my husband really jumped at the idea.<br/>
The advantage there would be that we have family who could help us <br/>
with looking for a home, moving, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what area we would be looking at. The cost of living <br/>
is higher in Chicago than Ohio, I know that, but I know that some <br/>
areas are less expensive than others.  One of our big concerns would <br/>
be finding a school for our daughter, who does love school, but we  <br/>
know we are enormously lucky to have found a good fit for her in <br/>
school here.  When I think of the work involved in finding new <br/>
medical professionals, new gyms, new churches, new everything, my <br/>
head just about spins.  Still, in the long run it would be wonderful <br/>
to be near family and be able to see them without a big production. <br/>
And to be able to have them watch our kids some of the time.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, my family lives not too far from O&#39;Hare Airport, and my <br/>
husband&#39;s family lives in the far south suburbs.  If anyone on the <br/>
list lives in the Chicago area, would you please e-mail me so I can <br/>
start collecting the information I need about local groups, <br/>
regulations, etc.?  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
