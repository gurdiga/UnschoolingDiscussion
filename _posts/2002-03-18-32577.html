<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276010118">I&#39;d like to pass along a link suggested on another<br/>
group list.  It&#39;s the sign-up page for pre-tests and<br/>
study modules based on the new (January 2002) GED<br/>
test.  Looks great so far.  I signed up my 13-yr-old<br/>
so we can start using it as a basic guide in the major<br/>
academic areas.  I found the GED study guide book to<br/>
be a great resource, starting when my first daughter<br/>
was about that age.  Whether or not one wishes to take<br/>
a GED test or even finish the study program, it&#39;s a<br/>
free resource for activities and educational websites.<br/>
 It also offers information about local PBS<br/>
programming and how to order workbooks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041089669">Last night I dreamt that I was back at my old high school and was getting in<br/>
trouble by the vice-principal (as usual) and as I stood there, I realized<br/>
that I was of legal age to drop out and I could take my GED. It was an<br/>
empowering thought because I knew from reading these lists and boards that<br/>
this was OK to do and I wouldn&#39;t be a loser pumping gas my whole life. So I<br/>
signed this clipboard and was FREE!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-665349310">I&#39;m new on the list with a 5 yr old and an almost 3 yr old. Elissa your<br/>
post made me think. When I was growing up I totally bought into the myth<br/>
that you had to finish school with honors and get a college degree or<br/>
you would be a total loser. I still wish I would have taken the<br/>
cosmetology classes offered for free that would have allowed me to get<br/>
certified in at least 3 different areas instead of taking the honors<br/>
classes. Not that I would have stuck with cosmetology for my entire life<br/>
but it would have made working through college much easier. I hope that<br/>
I can instill in my kids that there is no one path and they should go<br/>
down the path that is right for them.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you! That&#39;s all I ask.<br/>
Not really related but this came to mind.<br/>
I said to my son&#39;s stepmother the other day.<br/>
No matter what we do,  public school, school at home, or unschooling, Zack<br/>
will still reach the age of 18 with the same basic body of knowledge. It&#39;s<br/>
not the destination, it&#39;s the Journey. I don&#39;t care about his grade point<br/>
average, it&#39;s meaningless in the big picture.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not to nitpick, but that body of knowledge probably won&#39;t be exactly the <br/>
same. IMO the unschooled child&#39;s knowledge will be broader, more in-depth, <br/>
full of life, questioning and ever continuing. However, it may not contain <br/>
some of the facts, figures, outlines and dates that were forced on a <br/>
schooled child.<br/>
