&gt;  I guess I was just wondering about easing up on swords and arrows, while<br/>
&gt; still keeping a &quot;no guns&quot; rule, as I just cannot find any redemptive value<br/>
&gt; in pretending to spray someone with bullets.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not really about what you find redemptive value in, though -- it&#39;s<br/>
about what THEY find redemptive value in.<br/>
<br/>
If they want to pretend to spray each other with bullets in the midst of a<br/>
game in the living room, I would let them. If I had *any* fear that they did<br/>
not realize that real bullets would injure or kill, I&#39;d find ways to bring<br/>
that up (just as when my daughters were pretending they could fly by jumping<br/>
off the chairs -- if I had had any concerns that they might really think<br/>
they could fly and might head up to the roof to try it, I&#39;d have mentioned<br/>
the fact).<br/>
<br/>
As with anything else, if I didn&#39;t want to play I would just tell them that.<br/>
&quot;Please don&#39;t shoot me, I don&#39;t like to play shooting games.&quot; And that would<br/>
be respected, just as I respect their desire to do and not do what they like<br/>
and don&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
You talk about &quot;easing up&quot; and a &quot;no guns&quot; rule -- these things *are* doing<br/>
what Ren was talking about, which is forcing your views on your children.<br/>
