Sometimes there&#39;s a genetic characteristic of not being overtly talkative and <br/>
conversational.   But I thought of a couple of suggetions.  One is <br/>
restaurants.  Go to a cafe even just for a soda or tea, and go when it&#39;s not busy so you <br/>
can sit and talk without inconveniencing other customers.   If there&#39;s <br/>
nothing else to do but talk, talking comes easier.<br/>
<br/>
In the car, maybe don&#39;t put the radio or CD on a soon as you get in.   Leave <br/>
it quiet.  Or start a conversation based on a song or commercial, and turn the <br/>
radio off to discuss it.  (This happens in our car all the time.)<br/>
<br/>
And side-by-side opportunities to talk have been the best side-effect of our <br/>
&quot;strewing&quot; here.  Two people playing with magnets are likely to talk about <br/>
things other than the magnets after a bit.<br/>

can easily get annoyed at me trying to talk to him about his <br/>

It&#39;s easy to get discouraged if you try to talk about something <br/>
several times and don&#39;t get much response. Lol, it&#39;s like strewing <br/>
your attention in front of someone--if they want it, they can take <br/>
it, but it shouldn&#39;t be taken as an insult if they don&#39;t! Easier said <br/>
than done, esp. with grumpy introverts...<br/>

Drawing on placemats has filled some quiet time for me before, not with my <br/>
kids so much, but with adult friends who really wanted to talk but had a hard <br/>
time getting started.  We would doodle together in silence a while.  Maybe if <br/>
it&#39;s too quiet, doodle or color.  Maybe take your own paper and pens just in <br/>
case.<br/>
