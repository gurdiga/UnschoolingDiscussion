&lt;&lt;  If you&#39;re in the mood to make more<br/>
 trips like this, I can strongly recommend Williamsburg (including Jamestown,<br/>
 Yorktown and Carter&#39;s Grove), Plymouth Plantation, and Concord and<br/>
 Lexington.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in Williamsburg, check their web page <br/>

<br/>
Tickets are regularly $35 for adults.  HOWEVER, they hold Home Educators Week <br/>
in Jan and Sept where tickets are $8.50 per person.  Search for Home Educator <br/>
to get more information on the program.  <br/>
<br/>
Bush Gardens (a theme park where you can go to England (Shakespeare&#39;s time), <br/>
France and a few othere European countries) is nearby.  <br/>
