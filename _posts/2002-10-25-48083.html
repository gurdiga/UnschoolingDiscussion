&lt;&lt; She said if I ever have <br/>
another baby I need to get a pump from a reputable company, and apparently <br/>
they are expensive. But I am just mad, so mad. Do you all see how mad I am? <br/>
Why are formula companies making breast pumps? How fair is that? So many <br/>
women, discouraged at the 1/2 oz. of milk produced after 15 minutes of <br/>
pumping! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just for the record, I have used cheapo ones with good results, but Holly had <br/>
a weird oddity about her and I had to use an electric pumps at first. The <br/>
electric pump was expensive, I rented it from a woman who was also a LLLeader <br/>
and that&#39;s all fine and good.<br/>
<br/>
About the little ones, it will work if you think of needing to stimulate the <br/>
let-down of the milk.<br/>
<br/>
Now if a guy goes to donate sperm, I hear they put him in a room with some <br/>
certain sort of magazines to look at.    If they put him in a room with <br/>
certain OTHER kinds of magazines to look at, he would not be able to do <br/>
what&#39;s necessary to unnaturally ... you know.<br/>
<br/>
So with breast pumps.  It helps if you have a t-shirt of the baby to smell, <br/>
and a photo of the baby, and you sit in a quiet, partly dark room and THINK <br/>
about the baby. Because there needs to be a biochemical change for the milk <br/>
to let down.  And you can think the biochemical change into happening.<br/>
<br/>
I could get two or three ounces at a time.   But after a while, I got to <br/>
where I would just express into a mixing bowl (awkward position, but more <br/>
milk quicker sometimes).  <br/>
<br/>
(Nancy, if you knew all that sorry for repeating it, but maybe there are <br/>
other yet-to-nurse-babies moms here who didn&#39;t know.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976623873">I actually tried two from a store that were more like torture for me. I&#39;ve <br/>
always had a lot of milk and new what drips I was getting just wasn&#39;t quite <br/>
right. I finally ended up just manually expressing into a container. After <br/>
my first, I just made sure I was never far away from the baby to need one. <br/>
Of course movies were out for long time but what the heck!! It was for a <br/>
good cause!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, no! Thank you! The reason I posted was because I thought others should <br/>
know. I&#39;m glad others didn&#39;t have the problems I had with the pumps. I loved <br/>
to nurse, I just wished at times that Darin could have fed them (he really <br/>
wanted to) or I could have been away from them for more than two to four <br/>
hours. And when I found out that formula companies make breast pumps, I was <br/>
slightly outraged. I mean, why make a product that would help someone so they <br/>
didn&#39;t have to use the product you are making millions and billions on? And <br/>
that is why they make them so ineffective, so moms will quit and use formula. <br/>
I wanted any other mom to know that *if* they were having problems pumping, <br/>
and thought it was just them, that they might want to try another, not made <br/>
by a formula co. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14516803">This topic might be over by now, the delay in my catching up on emails is <br/>
annoying even me!<br/>
<br/>
I worked until my babies were 6 and 18 months, so I pumped a lot.  I had a <br/>
Medela pump in style and got very proficient at it.  Nursed my first until 11 <br/>
months when I had to stop because of a placenta preevia bleed, was <br/>
hospitalized and needed to end all possible uterine contractions or my <br/>
daughter would have come even earlier.  I used the pump with my daughter too, <br/>
but as soon as I quit my job, she refused to take a bottle and I ended up <br/>
tossing a lot of the frozen breast milk.  I got so good with that machine <br/>
that my best place to pump was in the car, in traffic on my way to and from <br/>
work.  It was a little tricky to operate a stick shift and the pump, but it <br/>
worked fine.<br/>
<br/>
I do know, however, that pumps and their efficiency is a highly personal <br/>
thing for each mom.  I never could hand express, but know a lot of moms who <br/>
could and did that exclusively.<br/>
