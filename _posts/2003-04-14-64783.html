<div id="ygrps-yiv-696862683">&lt;If they don&#39;t go to school, she says, then they wont learn the culture,<br/>
language etc and become successful in the new country. She cites &gt;             This is a very interesting debate. The first thing that came to my mind, however, was is ps the only place a child can learn about the culture of a country? I can think of libraries, museums, support groups, parks, movies, books neighborhood friends, the grocery store... I could go on and on about learning opportunities outside of the ps system where the immigrant child might learn about the language and culture without being subject to the criticism and neglect that the United States ps system has placed on many immigrnat students here. Just my thoughts.. Kelli<br/>
