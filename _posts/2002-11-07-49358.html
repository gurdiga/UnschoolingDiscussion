<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634054594">&lt;&lt;Holly wanted to stay home as early as six, when I would go to the store 2<br/>
blocks away&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, thanks, thanks.  Marsie (5) wants to be able to stay by herself but<br/>
I have been having to tell her no because it is a drive to get anywhere from<br/>
here.  I had never thought of when we go on walks (up our couple of block<br/>
long road with very little traffic) or when I am out in the barn in the<br/>
mornings (within hollering distance) that I often do leave her alone if she<br/>
isn&#39;t interested in joining in.  I hadn&#39;t thought of it as us &quot;going<br/>
anywhere&quot;.  Thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
