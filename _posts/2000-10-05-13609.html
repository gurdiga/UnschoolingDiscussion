<br/>
Greetings fellow rockhound,<br/>
<br/>
Are you a faceter or interested in learning how to facet? If so, the<br/>
following information may be of interest to you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Bob Keller, the current moderator and administrator for the American<br/>
Federation of Mineralogical Societies Faceters List. This week marks the<br/>
AFMS Faceters List&#39;s first year anniversary online. I am writing on this<br/>
occasion to extend an open invitation on behalf of the AFMS to those of you<br/>
who may be unfamiliar with this information resource to check out the<br/>
Federation&#39;s home page for faceters and the AFMS Faceters List FAQs which<br/>
are online at:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amfed.org/faceters">http://www.amfed.org/faceters</a><br/>
<br/>
You are of course welcome to subscribe and join our online discussion group<br/>
for faceters and faceting related topics. Our membership spans all levels of<br/>
experience and expertise from some of the world&#39;s foremost authorities on<br/>
faceting and gemstone design, to faceter wannabes who have yet to cut their<br/>
first stone and are seeking advice and help in getting started. Regardless<br/>
of your own level of experience and knowledge, if you are interested in<br/>
faceting I am confident you will enjoy reading and participating on the AFMS<br/>
Faceters List.<br/>
<br/>
Our home page also provides an automated list bot for subscribing and<br/>
unsubscribing, as well as lists of resources for faceters, how-to articles,<br/>
a downloadable collection of freely available gemstone designs, and a search<br/>
engine for our list archives. You can also subscribe and unsubscribe from<br/>
the AFMS Faceters List at any time by sending a manual request to:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:faceters@...">faceters@...</a><br/>
<br/>
May all your girdles be level, and keep on rock&#39;n!<br/>
<br/>
Bob Keller<br/>
