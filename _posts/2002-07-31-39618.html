<div id="ygrps-yiv-204133743">Here&#39;s a neat site.  I guess their goal is to make the whole world a <br/>
library where you&#39;ll never know where you&#39;ll find a book.  You drop <br/>
off books at used book stores, park benches, airports, etc. with a <br/>
label in that they&#39;re part of this program.  People who find the book <br/>
are supposed to go to the website and enter into a journal you&#39;ve <br/>
made up for the book where the book ended up, whether or not they <br/>
liked the book, etc.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bookcrossing.com">http://www.bookcrossing.com</a></div>
