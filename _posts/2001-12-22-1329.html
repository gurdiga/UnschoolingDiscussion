<div id="ygrps-yiv-275687065">I&#39;ve been thinking about the number of religious threads on this list<br/>
and it&#39;s made me wonder something that I hope I can phrase correctly.<br/>
<br/>
What makes you interested in them?<br/>
<br/>
I think I understand when a person who is a member of a particular<br/>
religious group wants to discuss certain aspects of that religion, after<br/>
all it is a part of her life.  But when it&#39;s not, when it&#39;s something<br/>
you have rejected, what about it peaks your interest in it?<br/>
<br/>
All the usual disclaimers apply.  I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
interested, I&#39;m not saying they shouldn&#39;t be posted, I&#39;m not even saying<br/>
it isn&#39;t an interesting subject matter.  I&#39;m just really curious about<br/>
why someone would want to debate (argue?) about something they&#39;ve<br/>
rejected.  What aspects hook you emotionally or intellectually?<br/>

Religions rarely exist in a vacuum.  Religious organizations often have <br/>
social and political agendas and attitudes which affect people not involved <br/>
in their religions.  One normally has contact with people whose religions <br/>
affect their behavior.  Past understanding and discussing something for its <br/>
own sake, knowing where someone stands on an issue is a good thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434799123">I like this question.  <br/>
The answer for me, I think, would be in the hope of gaining understanding<br/>
of my fellow human beings.  I read about serial killers too.  And<br/>
environmental activists.  And terrorists.   And artists.    Did you mean<br/>
to suggest perhaps that atheist have latent spiritual tendencies? &lt;g&gt; &quot;<br/>
Wake up and smell the loaves and fishes people, you know you&#39;re<br/>
searching?&quot;<br/>
