&lt;&lt; From Susan Shay:<br/>
&quot;Won&#39;t they miss out on learning a lot of important stuff? I mean,<br/>
how will they ever learn to stand in line?&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kids know how to stand in line in different circumstances.   Trying to get <br/>
into an R rated movie if you&#39;re not old enough, act very mature in the line, <br/>
and not giddy.  Stand next to a friendly-looking family that might be willing <br/>
to say you&#39;re with them, and be nice to them in case you see they&#39;re carding <br/>
people, when you get closer.<br/>
<br/>
But standing in lines in the U.S. (or &quot;on line&quot; as they do in NYC, because <br/>
English is spoken strangely there) hardly prepares people to queue up in the <br/>
U.K.   If two people are waiting for a bus, they queue.   If somoene fails to <br/>
queue properly, one of the older women there will &quot;snip you,&quot; meaning tell you to <br/>
do it and to do it right, and now.   It doesn&#39;t matter that the bus isn&#39;t <br/>
coming for fifteen minutes.  <br/>
<br/>
Where we live, we&#39;re used to milling around but knowing who was there just <br/>
before us, so we defer to those who were there earlier, and then defer to the <br/>
elderly or the in-a-big-hurry.  Even at checkouts at the grocery store, the line <br/>
might look (but not be) kinda nebulous, as those who are waiting keep <br/>
shopping around the area.   My favorite post office has a &quot;take a number&quot; system, <br/>
with places to sit and lots of wall displays to look at while you wait.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, schoolkids learn that getting in line means shoving and arguing <br/>
and then getting yelled at, and they learn how to look innocent while pinching <br/>
or stepping on other kids without it being apparent or proveable that they did. <br/>
 My kids didn&#39;t learn that.  <br/>
<br/>
I was standing in line outside the building waiting for the teacher to come <br/>
and lead us into the classroom after lunch when I heard that President Kennedy  <br/>
had been shot.<br/>
