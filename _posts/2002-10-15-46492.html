&gt; Hmmmm.... how would you recommend changing (or telling your kids to ignore)<br/>
&gt; others&#39; house rules? Especially people that should be respected, like<br/>
&gt; grandparents? (honestly curious and interested)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t try to change anyone&#39;s house rules, we just don&#39;t hang around people<br/>
who try to control or belittle my daughters about what they eat and when,<br/>
whether they watch tv, whether they know some factoid, etc.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters have great &quot;company manners&quot; simply from observing and from<br/>
having people treat them respectfully. I don&#39;t ask them to take what I don&#39;t<br/>
want them to dish out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948904848">Oh, I see, I thought something different from your pervious post. It sounded to me like you wouldn&#39;t require a child to follow whatever the rules were in other households. Sorry! <br/>
