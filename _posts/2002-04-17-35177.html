<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958837152">That isn&#39;t true.  I&#39;ve never been asked for grades for any of the &quot;adopted&quot;<br/>
kids that have lived with us, nor for my nieces and nephews.  My sil was<br/>
told they would have to be tested for appropriate grade level &quot;because, you<br/>
know, most homeschooled children are sadly lacking in academics.&quot;  They<br/>
passed way ahead of their supposed grade level and we never touched a school<br/>
book or did anything that even resembled curriculum!<br/>
<br/>
The only time that CA usually gives someone static is if they are in 9-12<br/>
and are planning on graduating with their class.  Then they want some sort<br/>
of proof of having passed certain classes.<br/>
<br/>
I worked as registra at the local school district and we asked what grade<br/>
level they thought they should be in and informed the parents that if the<br/>
child couldn&#39;t keep up we would have to place them in a lower grade than<br/>
what the parents indicated.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a link to the California standards.  Click on each subject area.  It<br/>
is slow to load.  If you use the PDF, there will be a column on the left.<br/>
Then click on 2nd grade and you&#39;ll go direct to that section and that years<br/>
standards.<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] unusual unschooling situation<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m Ruby, and just joined this list.  I have sort of an unusual<br/>
&gt; situation on my hands, and would greatly appreciate any advice you<br/>
&gt; can give me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve vacillated in my approach to home learning, but basically have<br/>
&gt; remained somewhat of a &#39;radical&#39; unschooler, in that I can barely<br/>
&gt; stomache anything that even looks like &#39;school&#39;.  I don&#39;t judge<br/>
&gt; anyone else for thier different approaches to home learning, but for<br/>
&gt; our family, this just &#39;fits&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I will definately &#39;bend&#39; in this particular situation, which<br/>
&gt; will &#39;probably&#39; be temporary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I live in Oregon, and tried to access the &#39;orsig&#39; group, but it was<br/>
&gt; unavailable for some reason.  I don&#39;t know of any other groups for my<br/>
&gt; state, so I decided to come here, because I&#39;m an unschooler, and you<br/>
&gt; have lots of members for me to draw advice from.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m raising my grandson, and we&#39;ve been, (for the most part),<br/>
&gt; unschooling since he was a baby.  He&#39;s almost 7 now, and smart as a<br/>
&gt; whip, a whiz with math, yet slow to warm up to reading, or any type<br/>
&gt; of &#39;busywork&#39;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oregon is a homeschooling friendly state, and basically stays out of<br/>
&gt; our business, with the exception of testing every three years.  By<br/>
&gt; the time my grandson is seven, I will need to file an &#39;intent to<br/>
&gt; homeschool&#39; with the school district, and have him tested every three<br/>
&gt; years from there on out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t been involved in any homeschool support groups, because<br/>
&gt; there just hasn&#39;t been the need for it thus far, and some of the<br/>
&gt; things I&#39;ve read about &#39;cliques&#39;, and &#39;elitism&#39; in some homeschool<br/>
&gt; groups, I don&#39;t know if I ever will join one, because I&#39;m very<br/>
&gt; unconventional in my beliefs and in our home learning, I just don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; see me finding a group that would be supportive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a friend who homeschools her children, in much the same way as<br/>
&gt; I do, and we get together often for outings and such, and that seems<br/>
&gt; to satisfy my grandson&#39;s need for social interaction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay, at long last, here&#39;s the situation.  Another grandson, from<br/>
&gt; another state...California, who is almost eight, is here with us now,<br/>
&gt; and will be with us at least until the end of the school year.  There<br/>
&gt; were some serious personal problems in his family that prompted his<br/>
&gt; coming to us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The two of them get along wonderfully, except for the<br/>
&gt; usual &#39;bullying&#39; type stuff that he learned in public school, and in<br/>
&gt; his life thus far.  But the new grandson responds beautifully to<br/>
&gt; being loved and respected, and has a sweet spirit in him that just<br/>
&gt; needs a little more encouragement than most, because his life has<br/>
&gt; been nothing but unpredictable, neglected, and emotionally abused.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He has expressed a great desire to be homeschooled with the other<br/>
&gt; one, rather than go to our local public elementary school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I believe this would be the best for everyone concerned, but when his<br/>
&gt; mother disenrolled him in California, she was told that he would have<br/>
&gt; to recieve a passing grade to be enrolled again in California next<br/>
&gt; year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t have a clue where to begin to find out what the requirements<br/>
&gt; are for a passing grade in California for second grade.  I know I can<br/>
&gt; have him tested here, in Oregon, but I&#39;m sure they test for Oregon<br/>
&gt; requirements.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is a great likelihood that he might remain here with us in<br/>
&gt; Oregon after the current family crisis is over, but should things<br/>
&gt; improve enough that he should return to his mother, I don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; send him home without the requirements to enter third grade in<br/>
&gt; California.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any advice you have would be so greatly appreciated!  Thank you in<br/>
&gt; advance for anything you can advise me on here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Was that said by someone in the schools?  It&#39;s one of my pet peeves!  <br/>
What academics are we talking about?  <br/>
<br/>
Being able to conjugate a verb and name the different tenses?  Does my <br/>
mechanic need to know that?<br/>
<br/>
Being able to solve a quadratic equation?  Does the person writing the <br/>
food column in my newspaper need that?<br/>
<br/>
Being able to recite the right dates of the &#39;importnant&#39; events in <br/>
history?  Whose history do we use?  And who decides which things were <br/>
important?  And does that really help us understand the world around <br/>
us?  Or would some other ways of learning about history help us <br/>
better?<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem with the schools is their expectation that <br/>
everyone needs to know the same things when they grow up!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424243576">Well stated.  That is one of my biggest sore spots regarding schools.  That<br/>
and their pushing everybody to learn it all at the same time too.  Not when<br/>
they are interested or ready to comprehend.<br/>

That was my biggest problem when I was homeschooling before I began<br/>
unschooling.  It is why I always felt like a failure, since my children<br/>
really only learned what they wanted, no matter how I tried to shove<br/>
other stuff down their throats.  It is why many children grow to think of<br/>
themselves as &quot;stupid&quot;, when they just don&#39;t get what other people get. <br/>
&quot;Getting it&quot; is a myth, anyway.  Most people are good at faking &quot;getting<br/>
it&quot;.<br/>
