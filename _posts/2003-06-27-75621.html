<div id="ygrps-yiv-578942617"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Dylan would like that.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He has a plunger collection and a kind of plunger obsession.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>WhoooooHoooooo..........<br/>
Welcome to my world!!!<br/>
Thank God you can get them for a buck at the dollar store!<br/>
Jimmy has at least ten, maybe more.  Big ones, little ones, black ones, <br/>
orange ones, and my all time favorite (even though it cost a bit more) a green one <br/>
with a crystal sculpted plastic handle.  <br/>
We take at least one each time we get in the car.  We check the bathroom in <br/>
every store to see if they have one.  <br/>
They stick really good to the glass cover on the bathroom light.  They suck <br/>
the tiles right off the kitchen floor.  They stick to each other.  They can be <br/>
used to unhook the chain lock on the door.  Yep, you can never have enough <br/>
plungers.<br/>
I can&#39;t BELIEVE that someone else has a &quot;thing&quot; for plungers.  That is too <br/>
funny.<br/>
