 </span></blockquote>We pretty much gave up doing after school work - it was too terrible. Even<br/>
though I knew the kids would have fun once they knew what to do, it was too<br/>
hard to get them to even listen to the first ideas. I felt bad because I<br/>
knew what they had been through all day.<br/>

After school programs should be running around and screaming or watching<br/>
movies &lt;gg&gt;.<br/>
