together.  He cries for 20 minutes when we arrive, and spends the rest of<br/>
the time hiding from the other children.  He would play inside when they<br/>
were in the yard, upstairs when they were down, etc.  We stopped going<br/>
alltogether.  It was too much for me, as I am mostly introverted as well,<br/>
and I would end up exhausted.  My other, older son seemed to really enjoy<br/>
the other kids, as he is quite extroverted and gregarious and hyperactive.<br/>
But he would get TOO wound up from the amount of people as well, and would<br/>
end up having a melt-down every time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-993015835"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt; They argue that homeschooled children are very precious while young,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but they often turn into odd maladapted adults who struggle in their<br/>
relationships.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to hear these people prove that the schools turn out<br/>
well-adapted adults.  High divorce rates, dysfunctional families, lots of<br/>
depressed people, etc.  Unless you live in an isolated, rural area, it is<br/>
likely that your unschooled child will end up becoming involved in<br/>
activities as she grows and will have plenty of opportunity to interact<br/>
with others.  Besides, children learn how to &quot;relate&quot; to others within<br/>
the family first.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m with Dawn.  I wish I could say no to more of the numerous<br/>
opportunities my children have to spend with others.  Monday was a school<br/>
holiday so they played with neighborhood schooled friends.  Tuesday, dd<br/>
was invited to a neighbor&#39;s house, then both dd spent the evening with<br/>
friends while I attended the babysitting co-op meeting.  Today,<br/>
homeschooled friends came to play from 11 to 3, then we went roller<br/>
skating for two hours.  Tomorrow we have girl scouts (a homeschool<br/>
troop).  Friday they will come with me to a LLL meeting, where there will<br/>
be other children.  This week is a little busier than usual, but fairly<br/>
typical.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-790016020">How true!! My daughter is 4, but we have always known we were going to hs. When it would come up in conversation, I would get the usual blow off statement &quot;Oh, I couldn&#39;t hs MY children, they are too social for that.&quot; My daughter is I think, the most social person I know. Not only do we hs, but she is also an only child. She has many friends, she is involved with theater groups, gymnastics, and she has a whole lot of fun doing beauty pageants. With the pageants, she gets to do charity work, have parties, ect.  Courtney nearly always has something going, and is about the busiest 4 year old I know. I think many people say comments like that because they have misconceptions about home schooling. Same goes with pageantry. They don&#39;t see the whole picture, I think they get hung up on one aspect, and don&#39;t find out any more.<br/>
I completely agree that hs children are, from what I have seen, at least as much, if not more social than ps children.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  I appreciated your comments on socialization, Bridget. Something that <br/>
  I have been doing since starting with unschooling in November is to <br/>
  log the number of hours that my kids socialize. Amazingly, I see the <br/>
  time going up, compared to when they were in school.<br/>
<br/>
  A parent of a ps student told me flat out that I was exaggerating <br/>
  because &quot;all the time in school the kids are socializing&quot; I wonder if <br/>
  this parent spends much time in the classroom and sees what happens <br/>
  when children try to socialize in class ... they get ridiculed or <br/>
  worse, put in the hallway. I will grant that they do get to freely <br/>
  socialize on the playground for about 1 1/2 hour during the day.<br/>
<br/>
  Because I feel less stressed with the kids being at home and because <br/>
  they don&#39;t have homework at night, I allow their friends to come over <br/>
  almost every night. They socialize between 3 and 5 hours a day during <br/>
  the week and as many as 12 hours per day on the weekends, not <br/>
  including the nights they have sleepovers. How much more social do <br/>
  they need to be???<br/>
<br/>
  I have also been fed the argument that my kids won&#39;t be able to <br/>
  identify with their ps buddies as they won&#39;t have the same <br/>
  experiences and won&#39;t have any reason to maintain their relationships <br/>
  (eg. school dances, field trips etc.) To this I respond, that I have <br/>
  kept in contact with a grand total of 1 (one) friend from my <br/>
  junior/senior high school years out of the 600 people I graduated <br/>
  with. The school environment did not help me foster life-long <br/>
  friendships.<br/>
<br/>
  My kids didn&#39;t play with kids from their ps school anyway. I sent <br/>
  them to a school outside of our designated district, so for the most <br/>
  part, their friends are our neighbours, not their classmates. <br/>

&lt;&lt; I think that with all that is happen in our public schools today, it <br/>
 is time we reclaim the &quot;S&quot; word for ourselves.  When someone questions <br/>
 you about socialization, don&#39;t be defensive about it.  In fact mount <br/>
 an offense, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I love doing that. One of my favorite questions for parents of toddlers was <br/>
&quot;Is she/he a social person?&quot; <br/>
Inevitably the answer would be yes.....then I could say &quot;OH, but how did <br/>
he/she gain social skills without being in school?&quot;<br/>
It usually causes people to do the round mouthed &quot;OH&quot; like a lightbulb came <br/>
on for the first time!!!<br/>
