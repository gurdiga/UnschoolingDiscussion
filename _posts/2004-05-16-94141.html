<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And you know, that is all I have been saying.  As opposed to &quot;I have never,<br/>
ever heard or read that phrase when it wasn&#39;t intended to tell someone that<br/>
you were not going to do what they unreasonably wanted, because you had some<br/>
status they didn&#39;t have.   Please, if I&#39;m wrong show me.  If I&#39;m right, say<br/>
uncle and stop defending it.&quot; or (paraphrase) &quot;some phrases don&#39;t even exist<br/>
outside of put-downs of children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I even posted that perhaps if we find ourselves using cliches we should<br/>
examine what is going on.<br/>
<br/>
The entire point was that a poster, I believe, Joylyn used the phrase and<br/>
the phrase was jumped on as being mean, not pointed out as something she<br/>
might want to take a look at.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am sorry people have been so injured by the words of others that they<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The whole point is to gain awareness of what we are communicating to our<br/>
&gt; children and become mindful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You seem to be responding to the list of phrases as though it&#39;s being<br/>
&gt; presented as the ultimate test to determine if you&#39;re mean or not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t see the list that way. I see it as something that might help some<br/>
&gt; (one? a dozen?) people be more aware of what they&#39;re doing when they hear<br/>
&gt; those phrases automatically coming out of their mouths.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is someone mindful if they don&#39;t say those phrases or if they stop saying<br/>
&gt; them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does saying the phrases automatically mean someone isn&#39;t mindful?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s just something that might help someone be more self-aware. We don&#39;t<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; enough feed back -- from kids themselves or from other people -- on how we<br/>
&gt; sound to kids, especially if we sound like conventional parents. We need<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; be able to hear ourselves.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think objecting to the list of phrases will help anyone be more<br/>
&gt; aware. But if you want to expand on the topic and have other ideas on how<br/>
&gt; people can become more aware of how they come across to their children,<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; would be helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676105387">&lt;&lt;My mom has said it on several occassions to my dad.  He had very<br/>
particular<br/>
tastes and didn&#39;t like things that are commonly put together to be together,<br/>
etc..  She would often do as he asked but sometimes she didn&#39;t.  She would<br/>
laughingly say &quot;I love you but I&#39;m not the short-order cook.  There is the<br/>
fridge, help yourself.&quot;  And kiss the top of his head.<br/>
<br/>
Does that count?  Or does she have some status he doesn&#39;t have?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She probably had status in the kitchen of being the person who did most of<br/>
the cooking or of being the best cook.<br/>
<br/>
As an adult your father already had sense of the real meaning of that short<br/>
order cook phrase. Unless you are talking to someone who actually works in a<br/>
restaurant, it is a euphemism with a number of levels of meaning: &quot;you are<br/>
perfectly capable of doing it yourself&quot; and &quot;I am too<br/>
busy/overwhelmed/tired/unwilling right now&quot; and &quot;you have crossed the line<br/>
into too demanding&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
But those are just the top layers of meaning. There is a lot more in that<br/>
phrase - in some cases, especially when said to children &quot;Independence and<br/>
self sufficiency is to be valued and encouraged (or forced on them if they<br/>
aren&#39;t doing it themselves)&quot; and &quot;my time and energy is for more important<br/>
things than you&quot; and &quot;you are less important than I am&quot; and &quot;revenge is<br/>
sweet&quot; and &quot;no-one does stuff for me and I&#39;m neglected&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I read the above story and wonder what your father actually felt at those<br/>
moments, and if they were at all predictable. Maybe he felt loved. Maybe he<br/>
felt confused, &quot;What&#39;s different about this request compared to yesterday<br/>
when she was perfectly happy to get me a sandwich?&quot;. Maybe he felt sheepish,<br/>
&quot;well it was worth a try.&quot; What if your father felt sad? &quot;Gee, I&#39;d hoped she<br/>
would show love by doing something totally unnecessary for me&quot; or &quot;Why is<br/>
she laughing at me asking for something&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I mention these possibilities not to criticize, but to try to come back to<br/>
*children* in this discussion. How might using such a phrase make your child<br/>
feel? <br/>
<br/>
Children do not have a sense of that cultural history of the phrase. It is<br/>
tough for little children to know where the &quot;uncrossable line into too<br/>
demanding&quot; is on any given day. To them it comes out of nowhere, and it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they felt all the force of &quot;you are less important<br/>
than I am&quot; as the primary meaning of it, no matter how cheerily it is said. <br/>
<br/>
There have been times when I have felt irritated by numerous requests from<br/>
either James (dh) or Jayn. It is when I am feeling negative emotions that I<br/>
try even harder to use simple factual language - this list has taught me<br/>
that over the last couple of years. Loaded emotional terms or cultural<br/>
shorthand are less useful than saying, &quot;I&#39;m a little tired right now. Will<br/>
you get it instead?&quot; or &quot;can I do that later?&quot; or &quot;I need some help. Will<br/>
you do such-and-such?&quot; (especially necessary with James who just assumes I<br/>
don&#39;t need help/am not overwhelmed unless I say so).<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I am unsure how you can<br/>
<br/>
&quot;defend&quot; the statement that they do not exist for anyone outside of those<br/>
<br/>
contexts.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I defend it by saying that in all my 50 years I have heard those phrases <br/>
dozens to hundreds of times (depending on the phrase), used to kids&#39; faces or in <br/>
snarky mom-conversations behind kids&#39; backs.  And in all those years I have <br/>
never heard any of those phrases used other times (unless maybe by a drunk trying <br/>
to start a fight, in the cases of things like &quot;Who do you think you are?&quot; and <br/>
&quot;You are so full of yourself,&quot; but they&#39;re usually reserved for the putting <br/>
down of children.<br/>
<br/>
So I defend my statement by giving my reasons for making the statement in <br/>
public where I knew I could be called on to defend it.<br/>
<br/>
And if anyone wants to refute it, they need to have more than just &quot;I doubt <br/>
it&quot; or &quot;but if they did,&quot; I think.<br/>
<br/>
Julie, I know you can come up with good, clear arguments, so I&#39;m confused as <br/>
to why you&#39;re clinging to your defense of the possibility (or more) of the <br/>
casual use of such exact word, exact tone of voice phrases in ways that have <br/>
nothing to do with their broad and longterm use in kid put-down.<br/>
<br/>
Did you grow up without ever hearing those phrases used to or of you?<br/>
<br/>
If so, I think you&#39;re in a small minority.<br/>
<br/>
I think your mom had at least one of them used on her, and she&#39;s used it <br/>
again, at least on your dad.  I doubt that if she heard it as a kid she got a <br/>
smile and a kiss on the head after.   And if she&#39;s been married to your dad long, <br/>
wouldn&#39;t she know what food he likes or will eat?  And isn&#39;t the purpose of <br/>
food prep and presentation more than just &quot;I did it, eat it or not?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those questions move it on to another topic, I suppose, or maybe straight <br/>
back to the original.   <br/>
<br/>
Feeding families is more than cooking one meal because it&#39;s 5:00.   That&#39;s a <br/>
rule kind of thing, a checklist.  &quot;I&#39;m the mom, it&#39;s dinner time, I cooked, <br/>
I&#39;m done.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But the principle is that people need to eat and if they go to bed hungry <br/>
they might not sleep well, and both food and sleep are important.  So if it&#39;s <br/>
important, the mom needs to plan life so that somehow, by whatever necessary <br/>
combination of factors, everyone has enough food he or she will eat that the <br/>
principle is fulfilled.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t sweep well, and I don&#39;t like sweeping.  If I have a list that says <br/>
&quot;sweep&quot; and I sweep, I can cross that off.  If the list says or means &quot;get the <br/>
floor clean&quot; it&#39;s going to be more work before I can cross it off, but the real <br/>
purpose is &quot;get the floor clean&quot; not &quot;move broom all over floor and call it <br/>
good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think school and chores are a combination that make lots of adults <br/>
(millions and millions of adults) think that if they moved their eyes across something <br/>
they read it; if they cast their eyes toward a person or a kid-project, they <br/>
looked at it; if music played and their ears perceived it they listened to it. <br/>
 But the person asking them to read, or look, or listen wasn&#39;t asking them to <br/>
indicate whether their nervous system registered stimuli.   They really <br/>
wanted attentive, thoughtful interaction.   <br/>
<br/>
When someone wants to eat, they often want attentive, thoughtful interaction <br/>
(and food).  It doesn&#39;t happen every time.  One of our biggest fallbacks is an <br/>
extra freezer with kid-favorite microwave stuff.  And I got really grumpy <br/>

&lt;&lt; Children do not have a sense of that cultural history of the phrase.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I heard it for years before I found out what it literally meant.  Just <br/>
because I didn&#39;t know what it meant in the adult world, at a restaurant, didn&#39;t mean <br/>
I didn&#39;t know that it meant &quot;You&#39;re not getting what you want&quot; and &quot;You made <br/>
a  mistake even asking.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another thing my mom used to say that meant a little bit of nothing and a <br/>
WHOLE lot of something bad was some variant of &quot;Who do you think you are, Miss <br/>
Aster?&quot; or to someone else with me standing there, &quot;Little Miss Aster thinks...&quot; <br/>
and then a story would be told of how I wanted something too good, too <br/>
expensive.  I had no earthly idea who &quot;Miss Aster&quot; was, and I wouldn&#39;t swear my mom <br/>
did.  I asked her when I was nine or so and she said she was a millionaire <br/>
with lots of servants, and she had inherited her money and not earned it, so she <br/>
was spoiled and got anything she wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe my mom was the meanest mom in the whole world and none of you had <br/>
put-down moms, and if I could believe that or make it any more true for wishing it, <br/>
I would LOVE that.   But I knew moms then and now who were even worse than my <br/>
mom, and moms reinforced one another (often right in front of kids) and <br/>
&quot;supported&quot; each other to be mean, insulting, and punitive.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want ANY of that for my kids.  I don&#39;t even want the box it came in.  <br/>
I would be glad for them to find it hard to believe that any mother would <br/>
ever say those things to a child.  I hope they will  be indignant if they hear <br/>
it, and never ttolerate or support others who are that way, when they&#39;re adults. <br/>
 I hope it dies out completely.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, some people are keeping it flamed and ready.  Unfortunately, a <br/>
lot of them are structured homeschoolers.<br/>

<br/>
Oh, no! You&#39;re not the only one! My mother had a whole littany of names for<br/>
me, none of which were very nice, made me feel loved or remotely good about<br/>
myself.<br/>
<br/>
Calamity Jane, Mrs. Magoo (Mr. Magoo, for those who recall, was blind,<br/>
bumbling and often ran into things), Linda Lightfoot, etc. The last one has<br/>
always been a major point of contention between the two of us. My mother<br/>
went to a two year college for her associate&#39;s degree in home-ec, though it<br/>
was basically finishing school. She always corrected my grammar (to this<br/>
day, I growl back that I&#39;m using the vernacular), insisted upon Emily Post<br/>
manners and used to flick my elbows off the table, and used to walk so<br/>
quietly that she could sneak up on my pretty much any time of the day and<br/>
just start talking right behind me. Being a person who startles very easily,<br/>
this has *always* majorly bugged me, and she has never done anything to give<br/>
me advance warning of her approach but instead implies that I&#39;m heavy-footed<br/>
and oafish.<br/>
<br/>
The really interesting thing about these nicknames in retrospect is that I&#39;m<br/>
actually a quite athletic and coordinated person, so they do little to<br/>
reflect any reality about me. They certainly wouldn&#39;t be any better if they<br/>
*did* reflect reality, but it seems telling that she needed to put me down<br/>
for the sake of putting me down. She&#39;s an extremely negative and selfish<br/>
person, and she&#39;s probably been the single greatest influence in my own<br/>
mothering--it&#39;s just too bad that it couldn&#39;t have been in a good way. I<br/>
accepted a long time ago that I couldn&#39;t change her, but my children will<br/>
*never* have a mother like she was--that much I do have contol over. I work<br/>
every day to ensure that my kids have the best mom they can have, and I&#39;m<br/>
grateful to have support for that here on this list and irl with LLL, AP and<br/>
unschooling friends.<br/>

<br/>
Julie, even your example of your mother saying it to your father - that <br/>
sounds like a sweet and mild rebuke, to me. Her way of telling him, <br/>
sweetly, that he&#39;s asking too much of her. Again, it makes him wrong, <br/>
even if she&#39;s making it clear that she&#39;s not upset with him for it. And <br/>
that&#39;s fine between adults - maybe he should have known not to ask so <br/>
much of her and he just needed a little gentle reminder.<br/>
<br/>
But when we&#39;re the parent and our child is asking for special food, <br/>
that&#39;s PERFECTLY okay for the child to ask, isn&#39;t it? Do we want to <br/>
make them feel like they are being rebuked for asking? Like they should <br/>
have known better? Like they&#39;re treating us badly by not recognizing <br/>
themselves that we&#39;re &quot;not a short-order cook?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Like I said before, I said this once. I said it nicely and sweetly and <br/>
I smiled - like in Julie&#39;s example of her mother. But the minute the <br/>
words were out of my mouth I felt I had rebuked my child just for <br/>
asking if I&#39;d make her waffles instead of pancakes. Why should she NOT <br/>
be asking. I can say no without making it seem like she made a mistake <br/>
to even ask.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-330772222">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Did you grow up without ever hearing those phrases used to or of you?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; If so, I think you&#39;re in a small minority.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To my knowledge, I have never had those types of phrases used to me.  Or at<br/>
least not in a manner that made me remember them.  I truly don&#39;t remember my<br/>
parents (who have been married since 1959) ever making comments to put me or<br/>
my siblings down.  Doesn&#39;t mean they were always sweet love and pink clouds<br/>
with us but that we had a realistic view of their world and never questioned<br/>
their devotion to us.<br/>
<br/>
My dad was a peace officer and always worked at least 2 jobs, sometimes 3.<br/>
My mom always worked as well. It was obvious to all of us that if or when<br/>
they were unable to do something for us they just didn&#39;t have the time or<br/>
energy or both.  I just can&#39;t imagine myself or my siblings or any of my<br/>
kids getting bummed at someone who spent the time and effort to make me a<br/>
dinner simply because I wanted them to make me something else and they were<br/>
too tired to want to do it. To be honest, it seems tremendously selfish.<br/>
<br/>
And in my 40 years, this is my experience of most of the families I know.<br/>
Sure, I also know some really crappy parents and I know some really crappy<br/>
kids but for the most part, the people I know have very loving dynamics in<br/>
thier families and understand that use of a cliche doesn&#39;t indicate a lack<br/>
of love.<br/>
<br/>
I talked with my dh about this because I thought perhaps I just had a wierd<br/>
family.  He laughed and said that he had used the phrase on his mom at the<br/>
last family reunion (we grew up on opposite ends of the country) in a joking<br/>
manner after spending time cooking breakfast while his mom was sleeping and<br/>
her wanting something just as he was starting to clean up.<br/>
<br/>
So I know it doesn&#39;t have to do with where you grew up, or in which<br/>
particular family you grew up.  I now know of at least 2 situations in which<br/>
that phrase was used in a manner that wasn&#39;t intended to put anyone down but<br/>
rather in a joking manner.  I think it has a lot to do with how people grow<br/>
up, whether they feel overall that they were loved or not, which was my<br/>
original post on this topic.<br/>
<br/>
I think perhaps it is just a difference in temperament or something.  If you<br/>
want to offend me, you are going to have to try a lot harder than to say<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not a short-order cook.&quot;  &lt;grin&gt;<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;  I am unsure how you can<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;defend&quot; the statement that they do not exist for anyone outside of those<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; contexts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I defend it by saying that in all my 50 years I have heard those phrases<br/>
&gt; dozens to hundreds of times (depending on the phrase), used to kids&#39; faces<br/>
or in<br/>
&gt; snarky mom-conversations behind kids&#39; backs.  And in all those years I<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; never heard any of those phrases used other times (unless maybe by a drunk<br/>
trying<br/>
&gt; to start a fight, in the cases of things like &quot;Who do you think you are?&quot;<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &quot;You are so full of yourself,&quot; but they&#39;re usually reserved for the<br/>
putting<br/>
&gt; down of children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I defend my statement by giving my reasons for making the statement in<br/>
&gt; public where I knew I could be called on to defend it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And if anyone wants to refute it, they need to have more than just &quot;I<br/>
doubt<br/>
&gt; it&quot; or &quot;but if they did,&quot; I think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Julie, I know you can come up with good, clear arguments, so I&#39;m confused<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; to why you&#39;re clinging to your defense of the possibility (or more) of the<br/>
&gt; casual use of such exact word, exact tone of voice phrases in ways that<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; nothing to do with their broad and longterm use in kid put-down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Did you grow up without ever hearing those phrases used to or of you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If so, I think you&#39;re in a small minority.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think your mom had at least one of them used on her, and she&#39;s used it<br/>
&gt; again, at least on your dad.  I doubt that if she heard it as a kid she<br/>
got a<br/>
&gt; smile and a kiss on the head after.   And if she&#39;s been married to your<br/>
dad long,<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t she know what food he likes or will eat?  And isn&#39;t the purpose<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; food prep and presentation more than just &quot;I did it, eat it or not?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Those questions move it on to another topic, I suppose, or maybe straight<br/>
&gt; back to the original.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Feeding families is more than cooking one meal because it&#39;s 5:00.   That&#39;s<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; rule kind of thing, a checklist.  &quot;I&#39;m the mom, it&#39;s dinner time, I<br/>
cooked,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m done.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But the principle is that people need to eat and if they go to bed hungry<br/>
&gt; they might not sleep well, and both food and sleep are important.  So if<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; important, the mom needs to plan life so that somehow, by whatever<br/>
necessary<br/>
&gt; combination of factors, everyone has enough food he or she will eat that<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; principle is fulfilled.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t sweep well, and I don&#39;t like sweeping.  If I have a list that says<br/>
&gt; &quot;sweep&quot; and I sweep, I can cross that off.  If the list says or means &quot;get<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; floor clean&quot; it&#39;s going to be more work before I can cross it off, but the<br/>
real<br/>
&gt; purpose is &quot;get the floor clean&quot; not &quot;move broom all over floor and call<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; good.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think school and chores are a combination that make lots of adults<br/>
&gt; (millions and millions of adults) think that if they moved their eyes<br/>
across something<br/>
&gt; they read it; if they cast their eyes toward a person or a kid-project,<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; looked at it; if music played and their ears perceived it they listened to<br/>
it.<br/>
&gt;  But the person asking them to read, or look, or listen wasn&#39;t asking them<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; indicate whether their nervous system registered stimuli.   They really<br/>
&gt; wanted attentive, thoughtful interaction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When someone wants to eat, they often want attentive, thoughtful<br/>
interaction<br/>
&gt; (and food).  It doesn&#39;t happen every time.  One of our biggest fallbacks<br/>
is an<br/>
&gt; extra freezer with kid-favorite microwave stuff.  And I got really grumpy<br/>
&gt; earlier because Keith ate my cheeseburger and left me with the no cheese,<br/>
green<br/>
&gt; chile that he had ordered.  Life&#39;s not perfect.   But it&#39;s a step in the<br/>
right<br/>
&gt; direction for people to honestly think and honestly look and carefully<br/>
speak<br/>
&gt; instead of reciting phrases from another set of principles.<br/>

How was his mother to know all the energy he&#39;d been spending while she was<br/>
asleep? It&#39;s a way of saying &quot;You should just be able to know what a drained<br/>
state I&#39;m in and not even bother to ask.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
His mother probably got what he meant since she&#39;s an adult and has<br/>
undoubtedly ended up in similar situations. But a child doesn&#39;t have that<br/>
understanding and can&#39;t have it until she&#39;s grown and has spent all morning<br/>
cooking or doing things for others. The child is just suddenly in a<br/>
situation where she&#39;s expressed what she needs as she usually does and for<br/>
some mysterious reason the person she&#39;s asking gives her a reply that<br/>
implies she shouldn&#39;t have asked and she should have realized she shouldn&#39;t<br/>
have asked.<br/>
<br/>
For a child to not hear that as a rebuke or to understand that &quot;not a short<br/>
order cook&quot; is just code for &quot;I&#39;m exhausted,&quot; they need an atmosphere of<br/>
hearing people express their real feelings and offering alternatives. They<br/>
need to hear things like &quot;I&#39;m really tired. Could I get you something<br/>
simpler?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How to create that atmosphere would be more useful than &quot;That doesn&#39;t bother<br/>
me.&quot; Because if it doesn&#39;t bother you, it probably came out of an atmosphere<br/>
of people being honest with their feelings. And it would be useful for<br/>
people to see how that atmosphere gets created.<br/>

&gt; to make?&quot; or even &quot;Oh - gosh - I really don&#39;t feel like getting the <br/>
&gt; waffle iron out now and then having to clean it and all that...&quot;  -- <br/>
&gt; those are &quot;real&quot; answers and they take responsibility for not being <br/>
&gt; willing or able to do what the child wants right then.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But to say, &quot;I am NOT a short-order cook,&quot; implies that the person <br/>
&gt; asking is being unreasonable. It implies that they are trying to take <br/>
&gt; advantage of you.  It makes the child &quot;wrong&quot; in asking.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>     What if the person asking is in fact being unreasonable and trying to <br/>
take advantage? Really unreasonable, I mean, to the point of being &quot;wrong&quot; to <br/>
pile that request/demand on Mom?<br/>
<br/>
       Not saying this is a good response even then. But I do think there&#39;s <br/>
some difference between saying it that way, and saying it in a steady flow of <br/>
imprinted bitterness and resentment of the people you live with. Now wondering <br/>
if this is the sticking point Julie has been getting at-- that  this phrase is <br/>
also used in exasperated response to a truly unreasonable expectation or <br/>
demand, as a sort of warning sign or signal? I think I&#39;ve heard it in both <br/>
contexts, as a child and as an adult.<br/>
<br/>
       I&#39;m thinking that words and tone used generally reflect the feelings <br/>
that cause them. So if Mom doesn&#39;t feel taken advantage of in the first place, <br/>
she won&#39;t feel like spouting these snappy little cliches we&#39;ve been <br/>
discussing, right? <br/>
<br/>
       If this is right, then the ideal unschooler response wouldn&#39;t be just <br/>
to tell Mom she&#39;s wrong to say it even when she honestly feels it, but also to <br/>
help her see (with clear eyes) and feel good about the often-unreasonable -- <br/>
but really lovable! -- people with whom she lives. <br/>
<br/>
       Which is what the list is trying to do?  :)  JJ<br/>

&lt;&lt; I talked with my dh about this because I thought perhaps I just had a wierd<br/>
<br/>
family.  He laughed and said that he had used the phrase on his mom at the<br/>
<br/>
last family reunion (we grew up on opposite ends of the country) in a joking<br/>
<br/>
manner after spending time cooking breakfast while his mom was sleeping and<br/>
<br/>
her wanting something just as he was starting to clean up. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if he had never heard the phrase, he would never have used it on his <br/>
mother.<br/>
Maybe if he had memories of his mother making him special food even when she <br/>
was tired, he would have made his mother some food even though he was &quot;through <br/>
with his task.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if the task were redefined to provide food until everyone had eaten, it <br/>
would be better than the &quot;I cooked, you weren&#39;t here, tough&quot; stance you <br/>
described above.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So I know it doesn&#39;t have to do with where you grew up, or in which<br/>
<br/>
particular family you grew up.  I now know of at least 2 situations in which<br/>
<br/>
that phrase was used in a manner that wasn&#39;t intended to put anyone down but<br/>
<br/>
rather in a joking manner. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Okay, then you did prove your point.<br/>
But I think mine stands.<br/>
<br/>
You know two instances where you include that it was used sweetly or <br/>
jokingly, but it was used as a justification for choosing NOT to feed a family member.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m  not happy to do better than my mom.  I want to do better than I did <br/>
yesterday, and to save a few of those phrases to use later with a husband or <br/>
parent is not part of my longterm plan.<br/>
<br/>
I honestly do think it&#39;s important enough to merit consideration.<br/>

<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t unreasonable and they don&#39;t take advantage of me.<br/>
I think it&#39;s directly because I have been really generous with them.<br/>
Because I have given freely, &quot;take advantage of&quot; hardly even applies.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s back to principles and priorities. <br/>
If the principle is people get fed, then people get fed (or there is easy <br/>
food they can get to).   If my priority is peace and positive feelings with the <br/>
kids at night, then someone about to go to bed hungry is NOT in keeping with <br/>
the priorities.<br/>
<br/>
But in exchange for that, the kids are really understanding.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s when the parent draws a line and says &quot;This is me and mine, and over <br/>
there is you and yours&quot; that &quot;taking advantage&quot; and balking rebellion happen.  <br/>
And that&#39;s not to say that we don&#39;t &quot;have boundaries&quot; here.  Not at all.  It&#39;s <br/>
just the boundaries are based on principles too. If someone is sick or tired or <br/>
distraught or hungry, he has more territory than the others.  But the <br/>
territory is offered and maintained by the rest of the family, not claimed by the <br/>
needy one.<br/>

<br/>
I think that&#39;s true.  But I think the suspect phrases both reflect and create <br/>
unnecessary negativity.   Even positive phrases like &quot;I love you&quot; aren&#39;t as <br/>
cool as honest, heartfelt personalized messages along the same lines.   &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
really happy we&#39;re getting along so well even though everything&#39;s breaking and <br/>
going weird&quot; or &quot;I was watching you across the room at the party and thinking <br/>
nobody had as good a husband, and it just made me want to come right home&quot; <br/>
might be better than &quot;I love you&quot; without any clue or detail. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You were really helpful today, thanks&quot; beats &quot;You&#39;re a good kid.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
That is a far stance from &quot;tough&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t make her breakfast.<br/>
He didn&#39;t (according to your account) say &quot;I&#39;m really sorry, mom, I&#39;m tired.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean &quot;tough&quot; like rough and tough, I meant &quot;tough&quot; as in &quot;you don&#39;t <br/>
get what you wanted.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe &quot;That&#39;s tough&quot; should go on my list of things that can be harsh.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s not a phrase you knew because your parents didn&#39;t use stock <br/>
phrases.<br/>
<br/>
My grandmother (granny/maternal) had another one.  A rhyming phrase meaning <br/>
&quot;serves you right&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That&#39;ll learn ya, durn ya.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It also rhymes in third person.  &quot;That&#39;ll learn him, durn &#39;im.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it was said in a friendly, almost affectionate way, but just <br/>
because it was one of the nicest put-down phrases I remember her using, that didn&#39;t <br/>
keep it from being a put-down phrase.  It meant &quot;You got what you deserve,&quot; or <br/>
&quot;he had it comin&#39; to him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &quot;legalistic&quot; or picky at all to recommend people avoid <br/>
those things if they can.  I think it&#39;s to the principle of being compassionate, <br/>
of treating kids like people we like.  [&quot;Legalistic&quot; is such a <br/>
former-fundamentalist Christian term to use of such things.  I don&#39;t remember who used it, <br/>
and that&#39;s fine.]<br/>
