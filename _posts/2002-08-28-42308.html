<div id="ygrps-yiv-265824222">**Or - buy a book &lt;G&gt;. &quot;How much is a million?&quot; Great book!!! I read<br/>
picture <br/>
books aloud to my statistics and economics college students, by the way.<br/>
They <br/>
LOVE it. I read &quot;The Story of Money&quot; to my introductory macroeconomics<br/>
class <br/>
last night. **<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pam, I was inspired by you to request The Greedy Triangle and The<br/>
Librarian Who Measured the Earth from my local library.  (Don&#39;t have<br/>
them in my greedy hands yet.)<br/>

Math would be a lot more approachable if there were more math stories<br/>
and math songs.  ARE there any math songs other than Tom Lehrer and<br/>
maybe Schoolhouse Rock?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We like books by Mitsumasa Anno for math stories. Our current favorite is <br/>
Anno&#39;s Mysterious Multiplying Jar. Also, Anno&#39;s Magic Seeds, Anno&#39;s Math <br/>
Games, Anno&#39;s Math Games II and III. If you like these *math* books and want <br/>
something (I think is) similar (kind of) for when kids want to know more <br/>
about words, try Ruth Heller&#39;s series. (some of which are out of print, and <br/>
hard to find. I have all but one, I think, and am still looking for it.) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-987025988">Other cool math authors include Theodore Pappas and Marilyn Burns (The I Hate Mathematics Book and all her picture books on the subject like The Grapes of Math).  And there are math songs for all kinds of audiences:  Bible based skip counting songs, and mutiplication raps, and Sarah Jordan&#39;s &quot;Math Unplugged&quot;....  any hs resource store should have lots of stuff.
