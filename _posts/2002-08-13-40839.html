<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552626700"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;There is a pre-unschooling list on Yahoo, but it&#39;s all full of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>curricula, plans and schedules. I&#39;m planning to unsub, but haven&#39;t<br/>
gotten around to it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a preschool-age folder on the unschooling.com message boards. I <br/>
haven&#39;t spent much time there (mine are 8 & 13) but I doubt that curriculum <br/>
talk is the focus there. Might be another resource for folks to check out. <br/>
