<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112254706">Hi. I consider myself to be on the edge between relaxed homeschooler (altho I refer to it as home education, which is more commonly used here in the UK, disliking the term homeschooling) and unschooler. I would say that I follow an unschooling approach but am still seeking to understand the radical unschooling approach. Anyway, I have a question: how do people deal with the education authorities (if they do?) when they are unschooling? I have a visit next week from the &#39;Flexible Learning Educational Service&#39; to assess the education provision for my 5 year old son, which I am nervous about although I&#39;ve heard this particular officer is supportive of autonomous learning. I guess it&#39;s the &#39;full time education provision&#39; stipulation that worries me - because of course I believe that learning happens all the time, but whether they will understand that is uncertain. I talked to my son about what we would say when this woman comes, and after telling me he would say to her that he reads a lot of books and finds out about birds, he also said he would tell her he &#39;eats sweets and watches TV&#39; - so I&#39;m a little worried! (I tried to explain why that might not be a good idea!) Last year I refused a visit and submitted a report instead, but I&#39;ve decided to have the visit now as I think it&#39;s in our best interests - mainly because my son&#39;s dad (we are long separated) is vehemently anti home education and should it come to court, it probably won&#39;t reflect well on me if I refuse education authorities admittance to my home. <br/>
<br/>
Your thoughts/insights/suggestions are welcome...thank you for reading this.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071518358">I would try the UK Unschooling  Network Facebook group for this question - it doesn&#39;t seem to be on Sandra&#39;s list.  The moderator has a lot of experience with dealing with authorities and it is made up of a wide range of unschoolers, not all of whom are radical. <br/>

I&#39;ve tried only to have the most radical-unschooling groups listed, because that&#39;s what people are looking for when they ask me.  It&#39;s not always possible, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone should be in contact with other unschoolers from their own jurisdictions (state, province, country�whatever level the laws are, applicable to you).    That&#39;s not the purpose of this discussion. <br/>
<br/>
Those who are in places with no requirements are better off not even thinking about tests, reports or portfolios.<br/>
Those are required to consider such things might get good ideas from some of the examples here:  <br/>

<br/>
Let&#39;s continue to avoid making it the focus of the Always Learning discussion, though.  Thanks! <br/>

And people in the UK might want to be reminded of two opportunities to hear Joyce Fetteroll and me speak:  <br/>
