<div id="ygrps-yiv-1104788598">&quot;&gt; Some people (men in my family) really live in the moment.  Rarely do<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they<br/>
&gt; think ahead to what they want to do in the next day, much less next<br/>
&gt; week.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d bet they had mothers who did all their thinking ahead for them so<br/>
they didn&#39;t develop that ability.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My absent-minded dh certainly didn&#39;t have that.  His parents expected him to<br/>
remember everything, and really came down on him hard when he didn&#39;t :(.<br/>
We&#39;re trying much more gentle ways to help absent-minded ds learn how to<br/>
organize.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225310087"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;We try always to check the night before about who needs to be where when,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>or<br/>
who wants to sleep extra late, or who is expecting a phone call or company.<br/>
It&#39;s helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Ds also writes himself a note the night before because the alarm will go off<br/>
in the morning, and he won&#39;t remember what he was getting up for.<br/>
