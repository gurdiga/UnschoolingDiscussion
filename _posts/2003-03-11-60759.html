<br/>
<br/>
I learned this just last week! During colonial times, we only had spoons and <br/>
knives. The fork was invented in Europe. There was a shipment of spoons <br/>
expected in the colonies, but a shipment of forks arrived by mistake. The <br/>
colonists had only used spoons, so they USED them as spoons to &quot;scoop&quot; <br/>
instead of their original purpose, to STAB. The only ones who could afford <br/>
the forks were the rich, so they got to develop the &quot;correct etiquette&quot; of <br/>
using forks, which has been handed down to today. <br/>
<br/>
Cool, huh?<br/>

So...<br/>
In Europe do they &quot;gig their peas&quot;?<br/>
I was told &quot;Don&#39;t gig your peas.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We were required to use forks to scoop, not to stab, except for switching <br/>
hands and stabbing meat to hold it while we cut it with our right hands.<br/>
<br/>
The only other use of &quot;gig&quot; that I know of is the term for a horribly <br/>
dangerous looking tool which is a little trident at the end of a stick like a <br/>
rake handle, called a &quot;frog gigger.&quot;  So between those I know what &quot;gig&quot; is.<br/>

How to Use a Knife, Fork, and Spoon<br/>
<br/>
An Introduction<br/>
The rules that specify how knife, fork, and spoon must be used have evolved <br/>
along with the &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cuisinenet.com/glossary/utensils.html&quot;">http://www.cuisinenet.com/glossary/utensils.html&quot;</a>&gt;forms of the utensils&lt;/A&gt; themselves. In general, these rules are <br/>
explicitly intended to prevent the utensils from appearing threatening. <br/>
Margaret Visser, in her book The Rituals of Dinner, points out that etiquette <br/>
and the ritual it imposes helps to control the violence inherent in the <br/>
preparation and serving of meals. Animals are slaughtered and consumed, the <br/>
guest-host relationship is, in itself, a complicated interweaving of the <br/>
imposition of &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cuisinenet.com/glossary/abe.html&quot;">http://www.cuisinenet.com/glossary/abe.html&quot;</a>&gt;obligation&lt;/A&gt; and suspension of &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cuisinenet.com/glossary/odysseus.html&quot;">http://www.cuisinenet.com/glossary/odysseus.html&quot;</a>&gt;hostility&lt;/A&gt;, and the ordinary table <br/>
knife is related to actual weapons of war. Consequently, flatware is held <br/>
delicately, carefully balanced on the prescribed fingers and guided by the <br/>
fingertips. To hold any utensil in a fist or to manipulate it in such a way <br/>
that is pointed at anyone would hint at potential danger, as would even <br/>
setting it down in an inappropriate way. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Holding a Utensil<br/>
In general use, both spoon and fork are held horizontally by balancing them <br/>
between the first knuckle of the middle finger and the tip of the index <br/>
finger while the thumb steadies the handle. The knife is used with the tip of <br/>
the index finger gently pressing out over the top of the blade to guide as <br/>
you cut. <br/>
<br/>
The Zig Zag Method<br/>
By American custom, which was brought about partly by the late introduction <br/>
of the fork into the culture, all three utensils are intended for use <br/>
primarily with the right hand, which is the more capable hand for most <br/>
people. This leads to some complicated maneuvering when foods, such as meat, <br/>
require the use of knife and fork to obtain a bite of manageable size. When <br/>
this is the case, the fork is held in the left hand, turned so that the tines <br/>
point downward, the better to hold the meat in place while the right hand <br/>
operates the knife. After a bite-sized piece has been cut, the diner sets the <br/>
knife down on the plate and transfers the fork to the right hand, so that it <br/>
can be used to carry the newly cut morsel to the mouth. Emily Post calls this <br/>
the &quot;zig-zag&quot; style. <br/>
<br/>
European Style<br/>
The European, or &quot;Continental,&quot; style of using knife and fork is somewhat <br/>
more efficient, and its practice is also common in the United States, where <br/>
left-handed children are no longer forced to learn to wield a fork with their <br/>
right hands. According to this method, the fork is held continuously in the <br/>
left hand and used for eating. When food must be cut, the fork is used <br/>
exactly as in the American style, except that once the bite has been <br/>
separated from the whole, it is conveyed directly to the mouth on the <br/>
downward-facing fork. Regardless of which style is used to operate fork and <br/>
knife, it is important never to cut more than one or two bites at one time.<br/>
<br/>
Peas!<br/>
Another significant difference between the American and the Continental <br/>
styles of using knife and fork is the American insistence that even the most <br/>
awkward and contrary foods (peas being the traditional example) must be <br/>
captured by the unaided fork. In Europe it is permitted to use the knife or a <br/>
small bit of bread to ease a stubborn item onto the fork.   <br/>

 <br/>
We waited until baby brother was asleep so we could have a private<br/>
picnic.  We ate apples cut into tiny pieces, which we speared with<br/>
condiment forks.  <br/>
 <br/>
Then, you know the nursery rhyme where the dish runs away with the<br/>
spoon?  Well, the cup ran away with the fork.  The cup and the fork ran<br/>
away, all the way across the living room to the sliding glass door to<br/>
look out and see what was out there in the wide, wide world.<br/>
 <br/>
I got to be cup and he got to be fork.  Cup and fork had a nice long<br/>
talk about all sorts of things that have been on fork&#39;s mind lately.<br/>

However, I play gigs all the time -- it&#39;s the work freelance musicians do.<br/>
Wedding gigs, receptions, orchestras, chamber concerts, etc.  We gig.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t recorder players gig?  (I always knew there was something wrong with<br/>
those early music folks...)  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt; A thought a gig was a job playing music.  &lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess especially if you overcharge!</div>

You could gig things with a pennywhistle, but not a recorder.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007996440">I do not know how I &quot;learned&quot; the way I eat. I was shuffled and also <br/>
did alot of victorian research even at a young age. My son calls me a <br/>
pea cutter because I eat my hotdogs and sometimes my hamburgers with <br/>
a fork and knife. I also eat food with the upside down fork after <br/>
cutting it with my knife. I do not &quot;gig&quot; my peas. <br/>
<br/>
This was a neat and interesting discussion. My son is 16 and this <br/>
gave us a whole learning coversation. I also learned about myself. <br/>
Thanks, Jodie</div>
