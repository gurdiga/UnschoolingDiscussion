<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470164761">I too was a bed-wetter & I think that my pediatrician hit upon the answer, at least for me.  I was dreaming that I was in the bathroom, on the toilet.  I would have those dreams sometimes even when I was in college!  I still have very vivid dreams, always have.  <br/>
<br/>
So when my daughter began wetting the bed, after diapers, we did the pull-ups thing for a while too.  But she found them uncomfortable, bulky to wear.  At the time my mother was an invalid, so I used what the nurses used for Mama, those large, square pads they use in hospitals and nursing homes.  You can get them at a hospital supply store, they are very reasonably priced.  I bought 4.  I would put down 2, on top of her sheet and she lay on them...2 made it safe for her to roll over.  They are soft, they don&#39;t make crunchy noises when she rolls over like a mattress cover does, and most importantly, they wash just like a towel, but protect the bed.  If she wet the bed I only had to wash her gown & the pads, put down the other 2 for the next night, and never mentioned it to her.  If she said something about it, I just told her that lots of people wet the bed until they are 10-12, as I did, and it&#39;s no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
During the months that she wet the bed almost every night, I kept the extra 2 pads and a dry gown next to the bed so that when she woke up (or I did, as we slept together) from the cold or wet, she wouldn&#39;t even really wake up in the time it took to take off the wet pads & gown & put on the dry ones.  She never remembered it the next morning and I think this helped her stop wetting sooner, that along with telling how I dreamt of being on the toilet those times she said something to me about it.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s not wet the bed for a year or more, but I still sleep-walk her to the bathroom every night, just in case.  <br/>
