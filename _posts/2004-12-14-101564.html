<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710538029">My son said today he&#39;d like to start writing to a boy about his age. <br/>
He watched Arthur today and it was the episode where Arthur had a <br/>
pen pal from Turkey. He&#39;s really interested in either writing <br/>
someone who lives in San Antonio, where we will be moving in 06, but <br/>
he&#39;s also interested in writing with someone that lives somewhere <br/>
we&#39;ve never been. <br/>
Soo, if you have a son who is around 6 1/2 and would be interested, <br/>
please email me off list. Thanks.<br/>
