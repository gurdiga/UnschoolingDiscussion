<br/>
Well, the dishes are dirty, the laundry is still in a pile, the living room<br/>
needs to be swept, and the cat boxes are dirty BUT the kids are still alive,<br/>
so I did ok.<br/>
<br/>
I do think our real job is to keep them going.  Happy, loved, etc.  The<br/>
house stuff and all the rest is part of how we do it, but we can let that go<br/>
if we are doing some other part of it.  Like taking them to the park, the<br/>
pool and a friend&#39;s house all in one day.<br/>

watch videos, read books, make a mess, eat junk food.  We stay in our pj&#39;s, <br/>
order pizza for dinner, and fight a bit about who has to get up to pee for the <br/>
other person. lol  (Sometimes it works)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-623763887">Oh, snowdays!!!! Our favorite around here, all five of us curl up together on the pull out couch and eat really crappy food and watch great movies and sleep and goof off! I love snowdays, all days should be snowdays, I think unschooling days are kind of like snowdays, maybe that is why I am loving unschooling so much:) Kelli<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is a lot like snowdays every day, but sometimes I have to remind <br/>
myself of that, so we go to extremes, and Mama&#39;s get the day off too!  <br/>
<br/>
My mom, she works as a school nurse, when she has a snow day, she stays in <br/>
her pj&#39;s too!  All day!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL This reminds me of my childhood. Whenever adults wanted to talk, they&#39;d <br/>
ask us kids to each go pee for a specific person. My grandparents only had one <br/>
bathroom, so all us grandkids would stand in line waiting our turn to pee for <br/>
someone else!!! It was disappointing when we figured out we weren&#39;t really <br/>
relieving anyone&#39;s bladder, but giving them privacy instead!<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for prompting another good memory of my childhood!<br/>
