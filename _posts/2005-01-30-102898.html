<div id="ygrps-yiv-74598790">We went to a local High school for a MOIS (Michigan Occupational  <br/>
Investigation)  It is only offered through school Id... anyway they let us  go to their <br/>
Library to take the test... a test that has similar test<br/>
 available on the Internet. for free but we went with the 4 H and  thought it <br/>
might add more<br/>
anyway we entered the school and my son was wearing a zipper sweat shirt  <br/>
with a hood.  We were in the building about 20 sec when some lady walked by  and <br/>
said to him we don&#39;t allow hats in this school... he looked at her and  <br/>
nodded.... she brushed her head and said take it off... again he looked at her  and <br/>
nodded... acknowledging her and started to walk down the hall...she reached  <br/>
out and grabbed his arm and said I mean you... he looked at me.  I shrugged  I <br/>
really didn&#39;t know what she was talking about... I looked at him and he  had <br/>
his hood on.  I said I think she wants you to take off your hood.   so he did.  <br/>
We continued down the hall.... keep in mind we weren&#39;t sure  where we were <br/>
going and were looking for the office at this time.... and we  live in Northern <br/>
Michigan where it is darn cold out.  The next person  we ran into said We <br/>
don&#39;t allow zipped coats in this school.... okay now  this is just ridiculous but <br/>
being the polite boy he is he un zippers his  sweat shirt... at this time I <br/>
lean over and stage whisper so this women could  hear... Next thing you know <br/>
they will want you to turn your coat inside out....  it had a skull like thing on <br/>
it...  he leans back and says then I  am leaving this joint and waiting in <br/>
the car....  <br/>
 <br/>
i should have left at this point but it was a 4H thing and I felt like  being <br/>
polite and my kids being the  nice people they are were willing to  put up <br/>
with this....<br/>
 <br/>
so we get to the computers and the councilor sets us up.... first she is  <br/>
taking them step by step until she realizes they can run a computer with out her  <br/>
help.  Well then a buzzer goes off that just about makes my daughter jump  <br/>
out of her chair.... she whips around and says to me &quot;what was that?/?&quot;  I  said <br/>
&quot;I think that was the signal that class is done&quot;.  &quot;They have to be  told <br/>
when a subject is done?&quot; she says.  I reply  &quot;Well yeah they have  to go to their <br/>
next class&quot;... ah the logic of children... :&quot;they couldn&#39;t figure  that out <br/>
by themselves&quot; she says.  so she returns to the computer and about  5 minutes <br/>
later it rings again.... she turns and says &quot;so whats that?   class begins?&quot;  <br/>
&quot;yep&quot;  &quot;how stupid you have to be told when to leave  and you can&#39;t figure out <br/>
when to be in the next class?&quot;  I tried to explain  and before I finished she <br/>
says so you have to finish before you may be done and  start something else <br/>
with a 5 minute break?  uh yeah... so when do you eat  or pee.... ah in that 5 <br/>
minute but you probably aren&#39;t allowed to eat until  Lunch at this time the <br/>
principal of the school comes in and is eager to  tell us all about classes we <br/>
can take here.... and My independent daughter says  &quot;Why would I want to do <br/>
that?&quot;  He starts telling her all the reasons why  and she looks him straight in <br/>
the eye and says &quot; You have a bell to tell me when  I am not supposed to be <br/>
interested any more... a bell to tell me when to use the  bathroom and if I am <br/>
cold I can&#39;t zip up my coat.... what would entice me to be  here?&quot;  &quot; Well the <br/>
experience to learn&quot; he says... Heaven help her she  began to laugh and <br/>
couldn&#39;t stop.  Needless to say we then walked out and  both my kids looked at me and <br/>
said no way are we ever going to a place like  that.<br/>
 <br/>
So from the woman that worries about everything... two hours at a High  <br/>
showed that the right decision has been made... I don&#39;t think my daughter will  <br/>
ever say again that she thinks that going to school would be  fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659573402">Thank you for sharing!  I needed a laugh this morning.  You must feel <br/>
very proud you have such bright children that know a BAD thing when <br/>
they see it!  My 13 yr old son NEVER wants to go to school after having <br/>
spent time there thru 4th grade.  Three years later he still doesn&#39;t <br/>
like the thought of anything having to do with the word &quot;learn&quot;.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to learn about anything, which makes it difficult to log <br/>
any hours.  I feel very sad for him.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that I would have been so calm as you if a total stranger <br/>
grabbed my son&#39;s arm.  I probably would have opened my big mouth and <br/>
have gotten us all in trouble!  : )<br/>

I can&#39;t recommend enough that you bring him to the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference this October in St Louis. He would be surrounded by teens---many of whom were in his position of hating to learn. Others have always been unschooled---and he could compare them both! He could listen to the presenters (which intrigued my son, Cameron) as well as hang around the teens and do *fun* things----fun things that *count* as learning. He could see that learning isn&#39;t painful----it&#39;s what we DO.<br/>
<br/>
Please consider it. Many folks make this their family&#39;s vacation. It could make a world of difference to him!<br/>

We are definitely coming.  We live in St. Louis and I was so excited to <br/>
hear that it would be here this year!  I have 3 little ones at home and <br/>
knew I wouldn&#39;t make it if the conference was anywhere else.  I try to <br/>

1000 hours, but I find I have to give him little nudges to fill in the <br/>
hours.  It also doesn&#39;t help that my husband hasn&#39;t quite come to the <br/>

<br/>
More importantly, you desperately need to understand that what he&#39;s doing IS unschooling! You need to accept Halo2 as unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Tell your husband that it&#39;s not yet &quot;working&quot; because you haven&#39;t given it the time it deserves. You both need to back off and quit expecting it to look like school. It won&#39;t. Probably ever. Bur he WILL be learning. What he needs. When he needs it.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t stress enough important TRUST is in this whole process. Neither you or your husband is showing *any* trust in your son. CELEBRATE Halo2!!! Have Halo2 parties! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There will be wonderful opportunities for all of you in October---but you can (and need to) start NOW!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-728362366">***I try to<br/>
let him unschool, but he literally wants to do nothing but play Halo 2<br/>
or other games. I don&#39;t mind but if the state ever showed up to see my<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
Speaking of loving to play Halo 2,  :)<br/>
 <br/>
You should have seen/heard the conversation that my son(11) had with my father(73).  All coming from his knowledge that he acquired from playing Halo and Halo 2.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
The whole artillery thing and weapons knowledge.   Alec, ds, was telling me all about  the different guns and vehicles that he uses and asking me questions.  Well,, I don&#39;t know anything about them.  We googled, we researched,  I learned a lot, he already knew most of what we found.  But I couldn&#39;t really answer some of his questions.   Really technical ones that were too hard to google.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Christmas was approaching and we were going to be seeing my mom and dad, so I told Alec that he should tell Grandpa about Halo 2 and that he would probably get into talking about the weapons and stuff.  That he would probably know the answers to some of his questions.<br/>
 <br/>
It was so cool.  First Alec was asking my dad if there were certain kinds of machine guns, then certain kinds of tanks,  then they got on to the mechanics of machine guns,, I think there were was steam operated ones, if I heard that right.   The conversation was very technical and over my head. &lt;g&gt;  Also the mechanics of tanks, the hydraulics systems of them. lol<br/>
 <br/>
They talked about my dad&#39;s time in Korea.  My dad&#39;s duties,, his training.<br/>
 <br/>
It was an amazing connection for grandson and grandpa.  They touched on WW1, WW2,  and the Korean War.  So, Halo 2 can cover your history, science and math requirements.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t say how much it means to your child to just support what they are doing.  Like Kelly said give a Halo2 party!  Equally, I can&#39;t say how much they do learn from those games.  <br/>
 <br/>
Ah, games,  if only people would give them the credit they deserve.  If my son&#39;s head was in a book or if he was researching some biological function of some animal, people wouldn&#39;t ask,  &quot;how long has he been doing that?&quot;  But since its a game, its not quite right that he&#39;s doing this so indepthly.    I find his passion amazing and incredible.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Faith,  its great that you&#39;ll be able to come to the conference.  Its a life changing event!  :)<br/>
 <br/>
And there  will be lots of Halo loving people there that your son can talk with!<br/>
 <br/>

know how I would feel in your shoes.  But when I was in high school<br/>
there was a required health class that was making me miserable.  It<br/>
spent a lot of time on mental health, and telling us saccharine stuff<br/>
about how the family is the center of your being while many of my<br/>
friends were going through very abusive home situations.  I would leave<br/>
the class physically shaking with rage every day.  Turned out that you<br/>
could be exempted from the class if your parents wrote a letter that<br/>
they objected on religious grounds (there was a sex ed component.)  So<br/>
my agnostic mom just sat down and wrote the &quot;how dare you teach my son<br/>
this devil inspired filth&quot; letter and I was right out.<br/>
<br/>
How might your logs ever be checked?  Do you feel bound to try to fill<br/>
them out in good faith on principle, or because the consequences of<br/>
being &quot;caught&quot; are severe?  Might be worth thinking about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108547011">Faith,<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of questions for you.  Are there any other options besides<br/>
logging hours as far as meeting the requirements for homeschooling in your<br/>
state?  Options that would be less invasive?  Also, could you figure out<br/>
what subjects the things he does (games) cover and log them without his<br/>
input.  Is there any reading in Halo 2, any historical stuff, any math?  If<br/>
there is, you can just put it under all three.  How detailed does your log<br/>
need to be.  Could you just write  &quot;covered history from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.&quot;<br/>
Are you sure about how detailed you have to be?  From what I&#39;ve read, hslda<br/>
is big on scare tactics.  It keeps the money coming.  But you need to make<br/>
sure you know what the law reads exactly, not just how hslda translates it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s possible to find a sympathetic teacher/reviewer in your state<br/>
who supports unschooling and might be willing to sign on the dotted line<br/>
without your keeping such detailed records.  Some people do realize that<br/>
learning happens all the time and not just with a curriculum.  Have you<br/>
asked on a local list if there are any teacher/reviews available who support<br/>
unschooling?  If you can find one and find out exactly how much detail<br/>
she/he requires, it might take some of the burden off your shoulders.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t have to turn it in to anybody. There is nobody authorized to <br/>
see it - you just &quot;maintain&quot; it at your own house. You&#39;re sweating way <br/>
too much over something that nobody else is ever going to see.<br/>
<br/>
AND - just don&#39;t let your kids even know you ARE keeping records - YOU <br/>
do it - keep them out of it. Whether you&#39;re trying to make it accurate <br/>
or completely fabricating it - one way or the other - keep the poor <br/>
kids from having to even know it is happening. It isn&#39;t good for them.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t do it at all, personally. Unless you have some reason to <br/>
think that somebody is going to take you to court - you&#39;ll never need <br/>
it.  I might use the unschooling recordkeeping form in the files area <br/>
of this list, along with the unschooling course of study (ACME) in the <br/>
files area - and maybe a box to throw stuff into if the kids created <br/>
anything that might look like a &quot;work sample.&quot; All that just casually <br/>
and in case I needed to create records for some unexpected reason.<br/>
<br/>
But - I&#39;m a bit of a risk taker and confident in my ability to talk my <br/>
way out of problems with educrats.<br/>

We live  in Missouri.  We get the Court Report mag from HSLDA and read <br/>
the  different stories.  I&#39;m realizing more everyday that I don&#39;t need <br/>
to  be reading those stories or pay for a membership.  After all,  <br/>
homeschooling is legal here. And your right, unschooling should come  <br/>
first.  I apparently suck at this .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
------------<br/>
 <br/>
Right.  HSLDA will suck the peace out of ANYone&#39;s life, and you pay  them for <br/>
that service.<br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t read any more.<br/>

It&#39;s not about &quot;bad words.&quot;<br/>

That would be my answer.<br/>
Its an unreasonable law and no one may ever see it and your kids would <br/>
never know.<br/>
Nor would anyone know that you HAD lied if you ever had to produce said <br/>
book.<br/>
Of course if I had to produce the log I&#39;d just say I lost it......<br/>
