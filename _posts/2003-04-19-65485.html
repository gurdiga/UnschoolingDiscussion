&lt;&lt;Well...<br/>
The world itself?&gt;&gt;<br/>

LOL! I *knew* there was a reason unschooling fit so well !  ;)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think trying to narrow it to a show or magazine or product is, again, <br/>
trying to focus an all-directions flow.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to narrow it down, I&#39;m just looking for any additional suggestions to open it up some more.  But I think I understand your point that, divergent thinkers especially, like to have lots of input to process and by trying to identify specific things, even those that &quot;fit with their learning/thinking styles&quot;, you may be doing them a disservice by inadvertently narrowing down the flow.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;With learning styles and thinking styles in mind, what I&#39;ve always tried to <br/>
do is rather than try to analyze any one child, I just provide and keep <br/>
swirling through lots of means of input and experience for them--sound, <br/>
sight, smell, texture, taste.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good point and that&#39;s definitely my goal. However, being a relative newbie, I sometimes wonder if I&#39;m providing &quot;enough&quot; input and experience for them, especially when the more typical ones (homeschool field trips, outside &quot;classes&quot; etc.) are currently of no interest.  So I&#39;m always on the lookout for new &quot;input&quot;, especially stuff I think they will enjoy.<br/>
