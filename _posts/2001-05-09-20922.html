<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836268629">To homeschoolers in the military and others interested in the topic<br/>
of homeschooling and the military:<br/>
<br/>
As homeschoolers in the military are aware, the Department of Defense<br/>
is in the process of conducting Home School Focus Groups in order to<br/>
collect information to pass along to an eventual Home Schooling Task<br/>
Force meeting in Arlington, Virginia, in the Fall.  As far as we<br/>
understand, the focus groups are being asked to discuss a set of<br/>
questions. The discussions have already begun and will continue at<br/>
least until later this month. The questions, as discussed last month<br/>
at one installation in Germany, are posted on the web at:<br/>

<br/>
NHEN is in the process of drafting a letter of information that<br/>
homeschoolers may take with them to the focus group meetings, and we<br/>
solicit your input as we draft the letter.<br/>
<br/>
As NHEN has followed this issue, we have been struck by how similar<br/>
the concerns of the military, from the installation commanders on up,<br/>
are to those of the civilian education authorities. Whether to<br/>
regulate homeschooling, under what authority it is regulated, and how<br/>
to regulate homeschooling are perennial issues that homeschoolers<br/>
have faced in all the fifty states. The questionnaires prepared for<br/>
the homeschool focus groups raise familiar questions, such as: &quot;How<br/>
can you tell the difference between homeschooling and truancy?&quot;<br/>
and &quot;How much difficulty do homeschoolers have if they choose to<br/>
enroll in school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As a national homeschool network connecting thousands of<br/>
homeschoolers, NHEN can provide the military with the fruits of years<br/>
of experience in homeschooling under many different regulations in<br/>
all 50 states.  We are able to provide the military with information<br/>
on states that have minimal requirements and to emphasize that<br/>
homeschooling in those states continues to be as successful and<br/>
productive as in states with more onerous requirements.<br/>
<br/>
We encourage any homeschoolers who are in the military and would like<br/>
to contribute their thoughts about NHEN&#39;s proposed letter to write us<br/>
immediately. Please indicate your military installation and let us<br/>
know anything you think would be helpful to us as we draft our<br/>
letter. Non-military input is welcome, of course; just indicate so in<br/>
your response. Unless you indicate otherwise, we will treat your<br/>
letters as confidential, meant only to help us write the best letter<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
Email your responses to info@nhen within a week [before May 15] in<br/>
order to give us your input before the letter is finished.  Later<br/>
replies are also welcome, as we will be following this issue through<br/>
the summer.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your assistance.<br/>
<br/>
The Board at NHEN<br/>
<br/>
PS from Nicky:  please feel free to post about it here on the<br/>
Legislative Board, too.  I&#39;ll pass along whatever gets posted here.<br/>
