<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036578125">Julie and Liza.. . about preparing a meal and all sitting down to eat..  .. <br/>
ME TOO.  Ditto on what both of you ladies said regarding this.   If I dont <br/>
cook a nice sit down meal in a couple of days.. the kids complain and get out <br/>
of sorts.  They really like the security and comfort of a home cooked meal <br/>
shared together.  I&#39;de say I cook a big sit down meal at least 5 times a <br/>
week.   Breakfast and lunch are pretty much &quot;as you go&quot; , but Dinner is a our <br/>
family meal.  But, hey, Im a great cook too, so my family is spoiled :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We still ask our kids to sit at the table with us. Dinner is not just <br/>
&gt;about eating, it is about socializing. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s a matter of what works for your family. One thing I like about our unschooling/unjobbing lifestyle is that we all get to spend a lot of time together. We don&#39;t have to make a point to take time to connect or socialize, because we do that at various times during the day. Today I snuggled in bed with the kids for half an hour, then I went swimming and DH spent 3 hours with the kids, then DH went to work for awhile and I spent the late morning/afternoon with the kids, then DH came home and we all went for a walk down to the store for a popsicle and walked home in the rain. We&#39;ll spend the evening hours as a family, then DH and I will get time together after the kids go to sleep. It all works out somehow.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;When it comes to eating and socializing, Americans should take a cue <br/>
&gt;from the rest of the world. Really. The chef in me takes offense at how <br/>
&gt;people treat food. There is no soul to it, no joy. At home, especially, <br/>
&gt;most people just eat to eat, they don&#39;t dine. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, for me I&#39;m an on-the-go kind of person. There&#39;s a lot of things I&#39;d rather be doing than eating, frankly. I like food, it&#39;s good nourishment for the body, but that&#39;s mostly what it is to me. If you gave me the choice between being able to have a really gorgeous 4-course meal and going on a 40 mile bike ride, I&#39;d choose the cycling any old day. Now someone else might choose the meal, but that doesn&#39;t make them any more joyful, soulful, or refined than me. I get my joy elsewheres.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t eat out much, mostly because we&#39;d rather spend the money on other things, so we do eat at home, and I do cook sometimes (like the yummy Phad Thai tonight), but as often as not, our family is snacking our way through the day. We eat a lot of fresh fruits and veggies, and I try to add in some kind of protein and grains along the way. Sometimes the kids are hungry when I&#39;m not. Often I&#39;m eating or DH is eating when no-one else is since both of us are training and frequently hungry. I do bake things with the kids, we made bread yesterday and muffins the day before, but frankly for me the big sit-down meal is overrated. My body also feels a lot better when I eat smaller meals more frequently. I don&#39;t like to ever feel full, I feel slowed down for hours after a big meal.<br/>
<br/>
Every now and then I like to &quot;dine&quot; and really sit back and enjoy some good food, but the rest of the time just fuel me up!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes I agree. I have always cooked meals daily. Meals as I knew them with <br/>
meat, starch and veggies and possibly salad too. I have been doing this for <br/>
26 years non stop. Even when I was single and unattached (briefly &lt;BEG&gt;) I <br/>
still cooked for myself every day. About 6 months ago, possibly more, I <br/>
noticed that the children weren&#39;t eating like they usually did and I was <br/>
throwing out a lot of leftovers. I was wasting food and hating it. We were <br/>
all so busy and everyone was on their own hunger schedule and mealtime for <br/>
us, well, it actually was a hassle. Didn&#39;t seem like anyone wanted to really <br/>
come to the table when it &quot;was time&quot;. And I AM a good cook. LOL!!! That&#39;s <br/>
when I started to question whether it was necessary for me to keep the <br/>
dinner routine (yes routine) going. That&#39;s when I realized that we were <br/>
spending a lot of time together talking and playing and sharing, dinner <br/>
wasn&#39;t important for us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Well, for me I&#39;m an on-the-go kind of person. There&#39;s a lot of things I&#39;d <br/>
rather be doing than eating, frankly. I like food, it&#39;s good nourishment for <br/>

the day.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what we do now. And the kids actually eat better and seem to do <br/>
better because of it. My husband and I try to every night sit down together <br/>
alone and eat. For us, it is necessary to connect. Our time together is much <br/>
less than with the kids. And during the day, well I know how you feel about <br/>
rather doing other things. Joe will actually call me to find out if I ate <br/>
anything. I just tend to forget I&#39;m so busy with other things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Every now and then I like to &quot;dine&quot; and really sit back and enjoy some <br/>
good food, but the rest of the time just fuel me up!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Same here. Every so often I have a great need to go out with Joe to a <br/>
restaurant and have someone else wait on me and bring me good food!! I&#39;m <br/>
starting to feel that again these days. It&#39;s time!!!<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s about thinking outside the box.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t think it was about forcing compliance. I thought it was <br/>
about whether dinner time was an appealing family time, worth <br/>
putting out for. If I thought that most nights my kdis wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
interested in eating together, then you&#39;re right! Why would I make <br/>
a meal or set the table?<br/>
<br/>
But in our house, dinner turns out to be really fun and special to <br/>
us. So it&#39;s worth putting out the effort to cook well and make a <br/>
lovely table. <br/>
<br/>
The fact that no two families practice dinner the same way is fine <br/>
by me. But sometimes in our rush to make all things optional, <br/>
we might actually forget to *offer* something that is predictable <br/>
and rich and full of other benefits.<br/>
<br/>
You knowThanksgiving is typically celebrated by all Americans <br/>
every year. This year we had ham instead of turkey. But we did <br/>
still celebrate. And maybe many others didn&#39;t, but most people <br/>
do enjoy and appreciate T-giving. If I hadn&#39;t been celebrating for a <br/>
number of years, it might be nice to hear an &quot;ad&quot; for why it is a <br/>
fun holiday to celebrate.<br/>
<br/>
I feel similarly about eating meals together. I know that we don&#39;t <br/>
always eat together every night (we rarely eat together on Sunday <br/>
nights, for instance) but it is a family habit that we enjoy and I just <br/>
thought it was worth mentioning the merits of it again.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all!<br/>
<br/>
If you like to do it another waygreat.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it helps me to have someone say, &quot;Hey, this &quot;X&quot; is <br/>
great&quot; or &quot;Try this, you might have forgotten how good it can be.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, my DH runs a cleaning business where he cleans airplanes <br/>
(corporate planes like Learjets). So he sets his own hours and <br/>
chooses which clients he wants to take. I like the idea that we can <br/>
have conversations like we did last night:<br/>
DH: I&#39;m so tired of the rain, I want to be someplace sunny.<br/>
Me: Well, why don&#39;t we drive to Southern California?<br/>
DH: How about next week?<br/>
Me: I have the homeschool fair to do, how about the week after?<br/>
DH: Okay<br/>
<br/>
Having the flexibility of controlling our own time is very important <br/>
to us!<br/>
<br/>
He also became his own contractor this year and built an 8,000 sq ft. <br/>
hangar. That was a learning experience for him as he had never done <br/>
contracting, dealt with getting permits from the city, pouring <br/>
gigantic slabs of cement, getting plumbers and electricians, etc. In <br/>
a sense, it&#39;s like unschooling for grownups, it was something he was <br/>
really excited to do. He also did some flight instructing this year, <br/>
and as flying is a great passion for him, that&#39;s more play than work <br/>
as well. Now that he&#39;s done, he&#39;s looking around to see what kind of <br/>
project he&#39;d like to tackle next. Meanwhile, I wrote my first novel <br/>
and am now in the process of editing it. I hope to shop it around to <br/>
agents and publishers in a couple of months. I just finished writing <br/>
my first article as well, and I might try my hand at some more if I <br/>
can sell the first one to a magazine. <br/>
<br/>
We try to each do things that we love to do, and try to make enough <br/>
money to get by. Our goal for both of us is to have enough money <br/>
coming in eventually from our various enterprises that any work we do <br/>
will be optional. I really like the approach detailed in books <br/>
like &quot;Multiple Streams of Income&quot;. Neither of us ever wants to work <br/>
in a job where one hour of our life equals some bit of money, where <br/>
we are basically selling our time. It&#39;s our goal to use our passions <br/>
to create projects (like a hangar we can rent out or a book that <br/>
produces royalties) that will keep generating income so that we don&#39;t <br/>
have to be wage slaves.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, our sporadic approach to work means that one of us <br/>
is always with the kids, and that DH gets to take a more equal hand <br/>
in parenting than many fathers get to. It works well for our family.<br/>
