<h4>The White&#39;s</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-427680174">Another idea for &quot;keeping&quot; artwork is to take pictures of it.  Especially if<br/>
you have a digital camera, you can keep photos of artwork without taking up<br/>
so much room.  That way you do have room to keep the really special ones.<br/>
And don&#39;t forget to frame really nice ones to keep forever.  Dad has some<br/>
&quot;original&quot; artwork framed and hanging is his office :-)<br/>
<br/>
I love taking pictures of my little artist standing next to or holding<br/>
his/her work of art, it puts more history and perspective into the art when<br/>
you reminisce.<br/>
