<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723102646">Our website is up and running!!! LeaAnn is checking it as I write, to make <br/>
sure everything is working.<br/>
Everyone that emailed me about the list of ideas from my conference workshop <br/>
can go to our website and find the list (hopefully, if it&#39;s all working ok).<br/>
So if anyone still wants me to mail it the old fashion way, I&#39;ll be happy to.<br/>
But this may be a lot quicker, and you can check out our other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
We have a list of book recommendations and they are linked to Amazon so you <br/>
can read reviews on them, and purchase them new or used if you wish.<br/>
<br/>
There will be links to loads of cool unschooling, attachment parenting and <br/>
fun stuff to do sites.  Book and magazine recommendations, essays on <br/>
unschooling and more.<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of you come visit the L.I.F.E. support group site. (Learning in <br/>
Freedom Everyday)<br/>
It&#39;s at www.pensacolaunschoolers.com<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just took a moment to go check it out, looks great! I love the background. <br/>
The links had lots of great information. I put it in my favorite places so I <br/>
can go back later for a better look-see. Great Job!!!<br/>

Thanks Nancy...I didn&#39;t do the actual site building part, but thanks.<br/>
There will be a lot more eventually, but at least it&#39;s up and running now!!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has ideas, we&#39;d love to hear them.<br/>
