logging in highlights of your day is a daily?  just because you want to?  <br/>
perhaps this is enjoyable to you and you find it rewarding, grrrrreat!  or do <br/>
you see it as necc for your state&#39;s hs requirements?  just wondering bc when <br/>
i did that (because i thought i &quot;should&quot;) i found it verrrrry difficult to <br/>
keep up.  and might save you some computer time if you did it another way...  <br/>

I try to make a few notes each day. If I don&#39;t put my thoughts down before<br/>
I go to sleep, I&#39;ll forget by the next night, and I surely will forget by<br/>
the end of the week. (Old age is setting in!) I know some people only<br/>
record activities once a week or less. The log is our chosen method of<br/>
assessment, and I do have to provide something for the town in the spring.<br/>
I don&#39;t log hours, just make notes of special activities. It doesn&#39;t take a<br/>
lot of my time to do, and it helps me remember topics that my son may have<br/>
touched on, but wanted to come back to later. The bigger issue is time for<br/>
me at the end of the day, not necessarily computer time. Sometimes this<br/>
time involves just looking at a book or watching TV. I just have to make<br/>
time for my husband first before time for me. Good thing I am a late night<br/>
person. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

i do a similar thing with notes on my daily calendar just to track interests, <br/>
etc. like you said.  and yes, doesnt take as long or as burdensome as what i <br/>
had once tried.  i guess the word &quot;log&quot; is what made me think it was lots!<br/>
