<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045383821">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
We were packed, and watched fire, but didn&#39;t have to leave here in Santee. <br/>
 We now have electricity back.  Hope all are doing well out there.<br/>
<br/>
Wanted to pass this on.  Have you ever walked into a book store and seen a <br/>
lonely author sitting by a stack of their books???  Don&#39;t let that be me!  :-0 <br/>
 Join Homefires, and talk to me on Monday!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Connie<br/>

Homefires Free Virtual Homeschool Conference Presents...<br/>
<br/>
Connie Colten, Author of Homeschooling Reflections<br/>
Monday, November 3rd, from 9AM to 5PM<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Connie Colten removed two of her five children from public school in <br/>
California in 1981 and has homeschooled all of them over the past two decades. They <br/>
all remained at home until entering college. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Connie&#39;s kids are all doing well. One is married and has a daughter, and is <br/>
working as an accountant. Another graduates in December with a degree in <br/>
Theatre, and is applying for graduate school. One child is a journey man in the <br/>
heating/air conditioning field. Her daughter, Donika, majors in music and dance at <br/>
Grossmont Community College, and Trevor at 15 is still home. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Connie says, “It has been an amazing life experience, not only to watch my <br/>
children grow to young adults...but also to watch the growth of the <br/>
un/homeschooling movement.” Join us as she shares her experiences and offers sage advice <br/>
to those who have questions about homeschooling and unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

released book, Homeschooling Reflections, at: &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homefires.com/farticles/conniecolten.html&quot;">http://www.homefires.com/farticles/conniecolten.html&quot;</a>&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Note: This is a perfect opportunity for those who are considering <br/>
homeschooling to find out more about it!  If you know someone who needs answers to their <br/>
questions about homeschooling, please invite them to join the Homefires <br/>
