<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120364892">I&#39;m writing more out of a need to vent than from anything else.  <br/>
We&#39;ve just moved to the north of England from Albuquerque and are <br/>
slowly moving through our sense of isolation and the interminable <br/>
darkness.  <br/>
<br/>
When we first arrived there seemed to be no homeschoolers in our <br/>
area so we&#39;d drive the long drive to Newcastle to meet up with the <br/>
group there.  For about the last month a group has begun forming in <br/>
our area.  It is slow and very committee minded.  Everyone concerned <br/>
that it functions as a democracy, something I must admit to being <br/>
only nominally interested in.  Fortunately I am vocal and pushy and <br/>
am able to be somewhat effective in molding the group to fit my <br/>
needs.  All I want is a group that meets regularly and that gives my <br/>
kids some other kids to play with.  At least that is what I profess <br/>
to wanting.  I find, however, as time goes by that what I really <br/>
want is a group of unschoolers who hang out and trust that children <br/>
learn what they need to learn as they need to learn it.  It isn&#39;t <br/>
going to happen.  Many of the other people involved in this <br/>
fledgling organization have children who are still in school; are <br/>
very concerned with educational opportunities; are incredibly <br/>
curriculum minded.  There are a couple of yahoo lists to help <br/>
organize meetings in the area and the level of discussion about <br/>
curriculum is so very discouraging.  There is a trip planned for <br/>
today to some Roman ruins and one mother of a 4 and 2 year old has a <br/>
couple of worksheets for them to do most specifically on Roman <br/>
numerals.  I don&#39;t understand it.  I don&#39;t know Roman Numerals.  I <br/>
can get to about 39.  And the only time I am really curious or in <br/>
need is doing crossword puzzles or trying to figure out the <br/>
copyright on some old movie.  <br/>
<br/>
The other day we wrote out words using Braille coding.  Simon wanted <br/>
to know what Braille was so I looked on line for an alphabet and <br/>
then we did a few words in Braille.  He can&#39;t read or write with the <br/>
English alphabet, but it didn&#39;t stop him from writing mom and Simon <br/>
and Linnaea in Braille.  And then he got bored.  I wrote a brief <br/>
paragraph because it fascinated me, but by the time I was done he <br/>
was typing out math problems on the typewriter.  As I write this it <br/>
sounds like such an academic pursuit.  But most days we sit and <br/>
watch a lot of television.  We watch DVDs on the computer, we play <br/>
Harry Potter II, we play Reader Rabbit (which I loathe but they <br/>
love) we staple paper to paper to make picture frames (okay, so that <br/>
just happened yesterday and today and Simon taught me how to do it) <br/>
we play a game on occasion, we read books, we build card houses, we <br/>
walk the dog.  But the Braille was his curiosity.  And there was no <br/>
testing and there were no worksheets and when he was done he was <br/>
done.  <br/>
<br/>
And that isn&#39;t the problem.  I don&#39;t mind how Simon learns or how <br/>
Linnaea learns.  What I mind is how little trust these people have <br/>
in their children.  I realized recently that I am a real, at my <br/>
core, evolutionist.  I believe that what they need to know they will <br/>
master.  If reading is something they have to have to get by in life <br/>
they will have reading.  If math makes a difference for them they <br/>
will have math.  And I believe that those things are necessary for <br/>
quality of life.  Since they are likely to live in a world similar <br/>
to mine, they will acquire those skills as they move through life.  <br/>
But whether or not they know Roman numerals or whether or not they <br/>
passed their GCSE&#39;s or whatever tests they have to take seems moot.  <br/>
And mere dressing.  I think dressing is a wonderful thing, I have of <br/>
lots of dressing, the best stories are made up primarily of <br/>
dressing, but what dressing you get and how you get that dressing is <br/>
surely an individuals own choice.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not even that I consider myself a very good unschooler. I have <br/>
moments of &quot;screw their choices, what about me.&quot; Moments of &quot;if they <br/>
just did what they were told to do this wouldn&#39;t take so long.&quot; And <br/>
I have to read and reread posts at unschooling.com and at chat <br/>
groups.  I don&#39;t post, I don&#39;t trust enough that I know what I am <br/>
doing to know what I am describing. But, I absolutely, without <br/>
question (well without more than the occasional question) believe <br/>
that they will learn without being taught.  And so will I.  And in <br/>
the U.S. we spent most of our time with schooling homeschoolers or <br/>
with schooled children.  It just wasn&#39;t such an issue, and they were <br/>
far more relaxed about their children&#39;s education.  And the only <br/>
concern was how well they got along.  And unschooling is a more <br/>
common concept in the US.  Once you&#39;ve announced that you don&#39;t <br/>
school you have fewer conversations about what curriculum you are <br/>
using.  Everyone here is scared about testing.  Testing in the UK is <br/>
how you know your child is going to succeed in the world.  If they <br/>
can&#39;t pass the tests they can&#39;t get into University.  If they don&#39;t <br/>
get into University they won&#39;t have any kind of future.  And once <br/>
the world is defined in those boxes it is hard to see around them.  <br/>
How do I live in a world full of boxes I don&#39;t believe in?  Sigh<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I am just feeling bogged down in a world with too few like-<br/>
minded individuals. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It should get better.  The new group you are describing sounds like the group <br/>
I am in only a few years back.  This group is very curriculum oriented but <br/>
they have evolved into smaller groups with direction.  There is one person <br/>
who organizes a certain activity etc.  And the one that we participate in is <br/>
the play group.  Originally organized by one of the moms.  It is a very <br/>
relaxed group because the &quot;agenda&quot; is for the children to have free time to <br/>
play.  For them it is like recess at their &quot;homeschool&quot;.  My boys get to play <br/>
with other children.  I choose not to participate in the more &quot;schooly&quot; like <br/>
activities.  When they go on a field trip we go if it is interesting for us.  <br/>
We throw the worksheets in the back and we meander away from the group to see <br/>
what we want to see.  It allows us to get into places for a reduced rate but <br/>
we don&#39;t feel like we have to participate the way the rest of the group does. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And I have a couple of unschooling lists that I enjoy for the unschooling <br/>
chatter.  Hang in there.<br/>

<br/>
Your Roman numerals story made me laugh.  My son got a terrific book out of<br/>
the library on Roman numerals.  It was really, really funny.  So he has<br/>
learned them.  And he&#39;s taught them to me, or at least he&#39;s tried.  I don&#39;t<br/>
get into them as much as he does, so 50 and 500 aren&#39;t sticking.  One is D,<br/>
one is L, and I still can&#39;t remember which.  My poor little teacher, his<br/>
student isn&#39;t very good at this!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have an answer to the school for the future, to get ready for<br/>
university mentality.  Hmmm, is it possible to smile sweetly and announce<br/>
that many colleges in the states will take you so long as you can pay for<br/>
your education, so you just don&#39;t care about your kids passing the tests?  I<br/>
suppose that doesn&#39;t help you find friends, but it might ferret out a few<br/>
(undercover) like-minded people!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043356821">I love Durham -- that&#39;s where my grandmothers folks were from. The<br/>
cathedral is lovely isn&#39;t it. BUT the winters suck and I know what you mean<br/>
by the darkness. My last year in the UK I had 4 and 2 year old and I<br/>
suffered from terrible seasonal depression. It really sucked. Take every<br/>
advantage of any good days you get plus hang out with the group even if you<br/>
don&#39;t always agree or enjoy it because just getting out helps to make the<br/>
winter pass faster. Soon it will be lovely and light and sometimes sunny<br/>
