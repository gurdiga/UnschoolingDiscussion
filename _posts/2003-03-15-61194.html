<br/>
An Interview with Major Doug Rokke<br/>

<br/>
Doug Rokke has a PhD in health physics and was originally trained as a <br/>
forensic scientist. When the Gulf War started, he was assigned to <br/>
prepare soldiers to respond to nuclear, biological, and chemical <br/>
warfare, and sent to the Gulf. What he experienced has made him a <br/>
passionate voice for peace, traveling the country to speak out. The <br/>
following interview was conducted by the director of the Traprock Peace <br/>
Center, Sunny Miller, supplemented with questions from YES! editors.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
QUESTION: Any viewer who saw the war on television had the impression <br/>
this was an easy war, fought from a distance and soldiers coming back <br/>
relatively unharmed. Is this an accurate picture?<br/>
<br/>
ROKKE: At the completion of the Gulf War, when we came back to the <br/>
United States in the fall of 1991, we had a total casualty count of 760: <br/>
294 dead, a little over 400 wounded or ill. But the casualty rate now <br/>
for Gulf War veterans is approximately 30 percent. Of those stationed in <br/>
the theater, including after the conflict, 221,000 have been awarded <br/>
disability, according to a Veterans Affairs (VA) report issued September <br/>
10, 2002.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the US casualties died as a direct result of uranium munitions <br/>
friendly fire. US forces killed and wounded US forces.<br/>
<br/>
We recommended care for anybody downwind of any uranium dust, anybody <br/>
working in and around uranium contamination, and anyone within a <br/>
vehicle, structure, or building that’s struck with uranium munitions. <br/>
That’s thousands upon thousands of individuals, but not only US troops. <br/>
You should provide medical care not only for the enemy soldiers but for <br/>
the Iraqi women and children affected, and clean up all of the <br/>
contamination in Iraq.<br/>
<br/>
And it’s not just children in Iraq. It’s children born to soldiers after <br/>
they came back home. The military admitted that they were finding <br/>
uranium excreted in the semen of the soldiers. If you’ve got uranium in <br/>
the semen, the genetics are messed up. So when the children were <br/>
conceived—the alpha particles cause such tremendous cell damage and <br/>
genetics damage that everything goes bad. Studies have found that male <br/>
soldiers who served in the Gulf War were almost twice as likely to have <br/>
a child with a birth defect and female soldiers almost three times as <br/>
likely.<br/>
<br/>
Q: You have been a military man for over 35 years. You served in Vietnam <br/>
as a bombardier and you are still in the US Army Reserves. Now you’re <br/>
going around the country speaking about the dangers of depleted uranium <br/>
(DU). What made you decide you had to speak publicly about DU?<br/>
<br/>
ROKKE: Everybody on my team was getting sick. My best friend John Sitton <br/>
was dying. The military refused him medical care, and he died. John set <br/>
up the medical evacuation communication system for the entire theater. <br/>
Then he got contaminated doing the work.<br/>
<br/>
John and Rolla Dolph and I were best friends in the civilian world, the <br/>
military world, forever. Rolla got sick. I personally got the order that <br/>
sent him to war. We were both activated together. I was given the <br/>
assignment to teach nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare and make <br/>
sure soldiers came back alive and safe. I take it seriously. I was sent <br/>
to the Gulf with this instruction: Bring ‘em back alive. Clear as could <br/>
be. But when I got all the training together, all the environmental <br/>
cleanup procedures together, all the medical directives, nothing happened.<br/>
<br/>
More than 100 American soldiers were exposed to DU in friendly fire <br/>
accidents, plus untold numbers of soldiers who climbed on and entered <br/>
tanks that had been hit with DU, taking photos and gathering souvenirs <br/>
to take home. They didn’t know about the hazards.<br/>
<br/>
DU is an extremely effective weapon. Each tank round is 10 pounds of <br/>
solid uranium-238 contaminated with plutonium, neptunium, americium. It <br/>
is pyrophoric, generating intense heat on impact, penetrating a tank <br/>
because of the heavy weight of its metal. When uranium munitions hit, <br/>
it’s like a firestorm inside any vehicle or structure, and so we saw <br/>
tremendous burns, tremendous injuries. It was devastating.<br/>
<br/>
The US military decided to blow up Saddam’s chemical, biological, and <br/>
radiological stockpiles in place, which released the contamination back <br/>
on the US troops and on everybody in the whole region. The chemical <br/>
agent detectors and radiological monitors were going off all over the <br/>
place. We had all of the various nerve agents. We think there were <br/>
biological agents, and there were destroyed nuclear reactor facilities. <br/>
It was a toxic wasteland. And we had DU added to this whole mess.<br/>
<br/>
When we first got assigned to clean up the DU and arrived in northern <br/>
Saudi Arabia, we started getting sick within 72 hours. Respiratory <br/>
problems, rashes, bleeding, open sores started almost immediately.<br/>
<br/>
When you have a mass dose of radioactive particulates and you start <br/>
breathing that in, the deposit sits in the back of the pharynx, where <br/>
the cancer started initially on the first guy. It doesn’t take a lot of <br/>
time. I had a father and son working with me. The father is already dead <br/>
from lung cancer, and the sick son is still denied medical care.<br/>
<br/>
Q: Did you suspect what was happening?<br/>
<br/>
ROKKE: We didn’t know anything about DU when the Gulf War started. As a <br/>
warrior, you’re listening to your leaders, and they’re saying there are <br/>
no health effects from the DU. But, as we started to study this, to go <br/>
back to what we learned in physics and our engineering—I was a professor <br/>
of environmental science and engineering—you learn rapidly that what <br/>
they’re telling you doesn’t agree with what you know and observe.<br/>
<br/>
In June of 1991, when I got back to the States, I was sick. Respiratory <br/>
problems and the rashes and neurological things were starting to show up.<br/>
<br/>
Q: Why didn’t you go to the VA with a medical complaint?<br/>
<br/>
ROKKE: Because I was still in the Army, and I was told I couldn’t file. <br/>
You have to have the information that connects your exposure to your <br/>
service before you go to the VA. The VA obviously wasn’t going to take <br/>
care of me, so I went to my private physician. We had no idea what it <br/>
was, but so many good people were coming back sick.<br/>
<br/>
They didn’t do tests on me or my team members. According to the <br/>
Department of Defense’s own guidelines put out in 1992, any excretion <br/>
level in the urine above 15 micrograms of uranium per day should result <br/>
in immediate medical testing, and when you get up to 250 micrograms of <br/>
total uranium excreted per day, you’re supposed to be under continuous <br/>
medical care.<br/>
<br/>
Finally the US Department of Energy performed a radiobioassay on me in <br/>
November 1994, while I was director of the Depleted Uranium Project for <br/>
the Department of Defense. My excretion rate was approximately 1500 <br/>
micrograms per day. My level was 5 to 6 times beyond the level that <br/>
requires continuous medical care.<br/>
<br/>
But they didn’t tell me for two and a half years.<br/>
<br/>
Q: What are the symptoms of exposure to DU?<br/>
<br/>
ROKKE: Fibromyalgia. Eye cataracts from the radiation. When uranium <br/>
impacts any type of vehicle or structure, uranium oxide dust and pieces <br/>
of uranium explode all over the place. This can be breathed in or go <br/>
into a wound. Once it gets in the body, a portion of this stuff is <br/>
soluble, which means it goes into the blood stream and all of your <br/>
organs. The insoluble fraction stays—in the lungs, for example. The <br/>
radiation damage and the particulates destroy the lungs.<br/>
<br/>
Q: What kind of training have the troops had, who are getting called up <br/>
right now—the ones being shipped to the vicinity of what may be the next <br/>
Gulf War?<br/>
<br/>
ROKKE: As the director of the Depleted Uranium Project, I developed a <br/>
40-hour block of training. All that curriculum has been shelved. They <br/>
turned what I wrote into a 20-minute program that’s full of distortions. <br/>
It doesn’t deal with the reality of uranium munitions.<br/>
<br/>
The equipment is defective. The General Accounting Office verified that <br/>
the gas masks leak, the chemical protective suits leak. Unbelievably, <br/>
Defense Department officials recently said the defects can be fixed with <br/>
duct tape.<br/>
<br/>
Q: If my neighbors are being sent off to combat with equipment and <br/>
training that is inadequate, and into battle with a toxic weapon, DU, <br/>
who can speak up?<br/>
<br/>
ROKKE: Every husband and wife, son and daughter, grandparent, aunt and <br/>
uncle, needs to call their congressmen and cite these official <br/>
government reports and force the military to ensure that our troops have <br/>
adequate equipment and adequate training. If we don’t take care of our <br/>
American veterans after a war, as happened with the Gulf War, and now <br/>
we’re about ready to send them into a war again—we can’t do it. We can’t <br/>
do it. It’s a crime against God. It’s a crime against humanity to use <br/>
uranium munitions in a war, and it’s devastating to ignore the <br/>
consequences of war.<br/>
<br/>
These consequences last for eternity. The half life of uranium 238 is <br/>
4.5 billion years. And we left over 320 tons all over the place in Iraq.<br/>
<br/>
We also bombarded Vieques, Puerto Rico, with DU in preparation for the <br/>
war in Kosovo. That’s affecting American citizens on American territory. <br/>
When I tried to activate our team from the Department of Defense <br/>
responsible for radiological safety and DU cleanup in Vieques, I was <br/>
told no. When I tried to activate medical care, I was told no.<br/>
<br/>
The US Army made me their expert. I went into the project with the total <br/>
intent to ensure they could use uranium munitions in war, because I’m a <br/>
warrior. What I saw as director of the project, doing the research and <br/>
working with my own medical conditions and everybody else’s, led me to <br/>
one conclusion: uranium munitions must be banned from the planet, for <br/>
eternity, and medical care must be provided for everyone, not just the <br/>
US or the Canadians or the British or the Germans or the French but for <br/>
the American citizens of Vieques, for the residents of Iraq, of Okinawa, <br/>
of Scotland, of Indiana, of Maryland, and now Afghanistan and Kosovo.<br/>
<br/>
Q: If your information got out widely, do you think there’s a <br/>
possibility that the families of those soldiers would beg them to refuse?<br/>
<br/>
ROKKE: If you’re going to be sent into a toxic wasteland, and you know <br/>
you’re going to wear gas masks and chemical protective suits that leak, <br/>
and you’re not going to get any medical care after you’re exposed to all <br/>
of these things, would you go? Suppose they gave a war and nobody came. <br/>
You’ve got to start peace sometime.<br/>
<br/>
Q: It does sound remarkable for someone who has been in the military for <br/>
35 years to be talking about when peace should begin.<br/>
<br/>
ROKKE: When I do these talks, especially in churches, I’m reminded that <br/>
these religions say, “And a child will lead us to peace.” But if we <br/>
contaminate the environment, where will the child come from? The <br/>
children won’t be there. War has become obsolete, because we can’t deal <br/>
with the consequences on our warriors or the environment, but more <br/>
important, on the noncombatants. When you reach a point in war when the <br/>
contamination and the health effects of war can’t be cleaned up because <br/>
of the weapons you use, and medical care can’t be given to the soldiers <br/>
who participated in the war on either side or to the civilians affected, <br/>
then it’s time for peace.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It may not be helping you specifically, but it&#39;s helping some of us <br/>
unschool.  In our family, the social and political ramifications of what&#39;s <br/>
going on in the world is talked about with our kids.  I knew about some <br/>
non-soldier-friendly things the armed forces were doing (like anthrax <br/>
vaccines), but this was news to me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I regret reading it, but scanning through the digests, I don&#39;t always catch<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, if one is sensitive to a particular topic, it is always good to read <br/>
the subject lines!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My husband is being sent to the Middle East, probably within the next month.<br/>
&gt;I do NOT need to read this kind of stuff right now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, it&#39;s your perogative to think it&#39;s not helpful in your particular <br/>
situation, but if *my* husband were to be in a hostile environment where he <br/>
would have to make decisions over touch-don&#39;t touch possibly contaminated <br/>
things, I&#39;d sure as heck want him to have this particular information.  It <br/>
might save his life and the lives of the people in his platoon.  Or, it <br/>
could make us examine if we shouldn&#39;t store a little &#39;manly essence&#39; in <br/>
case we want healthy future children and he returns contaminated.  The <br/>
ability to make those kinds of decisions is worth a little discomfort any <br/>
day of the week!<br/>
My opinion and it needn&#39;t be anyone elses.<br/>

have hurt feelings all around and, from other lists I have been on, War talk <br/>
usually leads to hurt feelings.  <br/>
