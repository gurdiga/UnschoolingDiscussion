<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333479725">It has been a decade since the fall of the Berlin Wall.  Perhaps that is the<br/>
single most remembered event when people ponder the fall of communism and<br/>
the end of the Cold War.<br/>
<br/>
A century from now, many historians could likely conclude that in terms of<br/>
significance to world history, the two most important years of the 20th<br/>
century are 1945 and 1989; 1945 marking the end of WW II and a radically<br/>
changed and politically and economically realigned world, and 1989 marking<br/>
the collapse of communism and another major political and economic<br/>
realignment.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the events of 1989 will also emerge as the most poignant modern<br/>
example of just how much influence average citizens can have when they<br/>
muster the courage to get actively involved.  Oppressive governments and<br/>
failed ideologies can be pulled down and swept away (even without bloodshed)<br/>
if enough people are willing to take the risk by speaking and acting as<br/>
their consciences dictate.<br/>
<br/>
Those who feel they&#39;re powerless to make changes, would do well to educate<br/>
themselves in the history of the events leading up to the fall of the Berlin<br/>
Wall.  That history is a message of hope, a reaffirmation that the power is<br/>
within<br/>
each and every one of us to create a better world if we are willing to put<br/>
forth the<br/>
effort.<br/>
