<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832703128">I missed the earlier post and took the liberty of writing to Suzanne<br/>
off-list, since this isn&#39;t very related to Unschooling.<br/>
I have indeed taught English to Japanese students  ages 2 to 75. Now I only<br/>
teach at the college level and only very very part-time. I&#39;d love to talk to<br/>
anyone who&#39;s interested about my experiences, feel free to email me<br/>
privately.<br/>
