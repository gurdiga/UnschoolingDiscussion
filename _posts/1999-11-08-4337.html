 </span></blockquote>    This is a hard one. I do think kids today in general are more <br/>
disrespectful. Maybe I&#39;m old fashioned but a lot of what I hear bothers me. <br/>
We do not allow our boys to talk down to us. We both have a wonderful sense <br/>
of humor and do allow them to joke with us within reason. This is a hard <br/>
issue to resolve though. This mentality has permeated our whole culture, we <br/>
fight an exhausting battle. Other than modeling what we expect from our kids <br/>
and correcting them when they slip I have no other answers.<br/>

speaking back at them.  Mom tried when I was 20 - just before I left home.<br/>
I love my parents dearly and I understand the need for respectful children<br/>
but I now feel there has to be a balance.  I raise my girls to be<br/>
respectful and expect it, but I also expect them to be free to state their<br/>
case when they disagree with whatever is going on.  They can say anything<br/>
they need to as long as it is done with a proper tone and respectfully.  I<br/>
may still overrule them - but they know they can say whatever is on their<br/>
minds.  I didn&#39;t feel I could growing up.  I don&#39;t want that for my kids.<br/>
My Dad sees this as total disrespect. So I guess your viewpoint will effect<br/>
the result on this one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-272294572">Seems like most of this comes down to one thing.  Negotiation.  I&#39;m trying hard<br/>
to teach my kids to negotiate with each other, and trying hard to learn myself<br/>
that now that my kids are growing up a bit, I am not boss.  I am learning how to<br/>
negotiate with them too.  It is a great process, but I have to constantly remind<br/>
myself to take the time to do it.  It really takes a bit longer, and some<br/>
practice.<br/>
