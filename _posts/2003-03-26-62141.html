&lt;&lt; Do you think that they can be exposed daily to the<br/>
 ads without falling for them? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you?<br/>
How is it that WE don&#39;t fall for all these ads? How is it that all ads are <br/>
bad?<br/>
I see a lot of cool things advertised. I discuss the creative ways that ads <br/>
make you want what they advertise.<br/>
Why would you want to try and hide societal views from your children? This IS <br/>
our society, like it or not. I think kids exposed to tons of views and <br/>
information are far better equipped to make healthy decisions than those that <br/>
were kept from some part of information.<br/>
Our children will have different views than us on a lot of things. Why would <br/>
our personal feelings about sugar or tv be better than their own feelings?<br/>
Kids can make up their own minds about stuff, just like we do.<br/>

me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876703109">Okay, I just have known people who have fallen for the ads and it&#39;s really<br/>
SAD! But you&#39;re right, if we are encouraging our children to think for<br/>
themselves we can trust that they will.<br/>
Thanks again. (We&#39;re going over to visit friends today who don&#39;t own a TV<br/>
and we will be talking about my decision to take away the limits from the<br/>
TV. That was the one area I wasn&#39;t sure about.)<br/>
