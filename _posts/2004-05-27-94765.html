Oh, did it look great.....for about 6 months until it all started to yellow.<br/>
And I do not mean a nice patina looking yellow. I stripped that and<br/>
used another brand&quot;also top drawer&quot; with the same nasty results.<br/>
<br/>
The long and short of a solution that I have found, has been thin coats of<br/>
either the clear coat on &quot;Patio Paints&quot; yes the bitty bottles or Glossy Mod<br/>
Podge. Sure it wears off and needs a recoat but not the huge mess the good<br/>
stuff turned out to be. And the focal point&quot; sink&quot; retains that beautiful<br/>
wet look rather than the rocks you wonder why you brought home once they dry<br/>
out..&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think I have some additional suggestions. <br/>
<br/>
If you are not particularly worried about how long the finish lasts - if you<br/>
are using Mod Podge for instance - you can probably save a ton money by<br/>
using (only) a couple of layers of Future Floor Wax from the supermarket - a<br/>
secret weapon of theater set and prop builders. It is water based, quick<br/>
drying, increasingly glossy and actually much longer lasting than you would<br/>
think. It can be tinted with paint tints for faux paint effects, which will<br/>
then settle to the bottom of your container and allow you to pour off the<br/>
newly clean Future for future use! It can go over basically any surface,<br/>
including crafts projects.<br/>
<br/>
For a certain industrial look in your decorating, Future really looks nice<br/>
over unfinished concrete or cement floors or countertops, giving a nice<br/>
patina.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the time, when I was still designing in Australia, when I have<br/>
needed to seal a painted floor and enhance the depth of color and texture,<br/>
again for sets, I have used Acrylic Emulsion which I purchased from another<br/>
theater in bulk. They bought a 44 gallon drum annually, and I would buy 5<br/>
gallons at a time and it would last for a whole season on our little stage.<br/>
Acrylic Emulsion is one of the key ingredients in white craft glues - it is<br/>
white, less viscous than glue, and then dries clear. It is goes on with a<br/>
roller or brush - beware of too much rolling over or you get tiny air<br/>
bubbles that are very faintly milky when dry (but it takes a serious effort<br/>
to do that). It would dry overnight and be a satin finish. It stood up to at<br/>
least 8 weeks plus classes. I never had to refinish a set, and it took the<br/>
next layer of paint beautifully.<br/>
<br/>
Another floor that is really durable is non-skid garage flooring - it has<br/>
the little raised circles, and I think rolls out just like vinyls. <br/>
<br/>
Thinking about wall painters and renters and refinishing woes - a product<br/>
that is used in low budget filmmaking a lot, is Sand Blast masking paper -<br/>
that comes in 50 yard rolls. It has a good sticky surface, stronger than say<br/>
Contact Paper, yet will still peel off walls or formica or that cheap white<br/>
coated furniture. The outside is a somewhat absorbent brown paper - like<br/>
grocery bags but thicker and more durable. It takes paint really well,<br/>
including standing up to faux finishing - hence its popularity in films when<br/>
working at locations that cannot be damaged in any way. I bet if you can<br/>
find a sand blaster - ie someone doing decorative glass sandblasting, not<br/>
cleaning stone buildings - they may sell some. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672803646">Thanks so much Kathryn. Your sink sounds gorgeous! Our house is wall to wall <br/>
saltillo tile except for that one bedroom so we have water based tile sealer <br/>
here. I&#39;m not sure, but I think the Thomson&#39;s is different. If it yellows I&#39;m <br/>
thinking it&#39;s probably a polyurethane based sealant. <br/>
<br/>
Robyn~Wow I love inexpensive, creative set ideas!! Thanks so much. We have <br/>
older dogs that have accidents every day, would the Future Floor Wax hold up <br/>
under the conditions of constant cleaning? I&#39;m actually very pleasantly surprised <br/>
by the floor. I really like it better than the tile. It&#39;s been a week or so <br/>
and the unsealed floor is really wearing....I want to touch up and then seal <br/>
and protect it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the ideas, I&#39;m going to file them away and save them.<br/>

<br/>
I think it depends on the cleaning material you are using - ie longer if<br/>
just water, shorter if strong detergents - and the number of coats you put<br/>
on initially. However I think the bottle has some info on that score. In<br/>
your situation you may have to reapply more often - when you notice the<br/>
shine fading. It&#39;s so cheap though.<br/>
