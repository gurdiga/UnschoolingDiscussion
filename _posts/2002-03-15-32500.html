<div id="ygrps-yiv-385443252">KathrynJB, I&#39;ve been condemned by &quot;just folks&quot; for so<br/>
many of my choices, I tend to feel I&#39;m probably being<br/>
untrue to myself whenever someone thinks they can<br/>
understand and tolerate me.  I usually notice I&#39;m a<br/>
much happier person and have much nicer children than<br/>
those who want to look down on me.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s often a challenge to find common ground, but<br/>
that&#39;s what I always try to do.  With homeschooling,<br/>
though -- which in my mind has and should and always<br/>
will be unschooling -- the only common ground is<br/>
concern for the child.  I&#39;ve explained myself so many<br/>
times over the last 18 years that I&#39;m no longer upset<br/>
in any way by the questions and criticisms.  Of course<br/>
there are things about myself I wouldn&#39;t share with<br/>
hardly anyone, but keeping my kids out of school is<br/>
one of the defining characteristics of my lifestyle,<br/>
so I do talk about it. No one who gets to know my<br/>
daughters can point to any lack, but of course some<br/>
people like to think their way would have been better.<br/>
 Sometimes I let those very people contribute.  For<br/>
example, one concerned individual introduced us to a<br/>
zoo curator, who gave us a personal tour and lecture<br/>
of his insectarium, including the back rooms.  That&#39;s<br/>
when we held a tarantula and a &quot;walking leaf&quot; and<br/>
petted a Hercules beetle. I will always remember that<br/>
as MY best zoo trip.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know this brought up a rant in my head that I have with the <br/>
acceptance issue.. and well.. i&#39;m going to rant.. so stop here if you <br/>
don&#39;t want to hear it!!! &lt;&lt;&lt;bg&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When people hear I don&#39;t send my kid to school (its usually right after <br/>
they ask what school he goes to) and THEN they question me about the <br/>
legality of it.. a LOT of them all of a sudden say that they FEEL BETTER <br/>
that NYS has these silly regulations up the wazooo!! They show this sigh <br/>
of relief and many have actually said that &#39;now they feel better about <br/>
it&#39; because parents are accountable in their eyes now...??<br/>
<br/>
As if the parents that beat their children and then send them to ps are <br/>
OKAY because they send them to school!!???? I mean, its not like theres <br/>
accountability there.. ??<br/>
<br/>
Abuse comes in many forms.. and if someone is going to be abusive.. <br/>
either educationally neglectful.. physically.. mentally.. or sexually.. <br/>
they are going to do it... regardless.<br/>
<br/>
How the h*ll does filling out exhausting paperwork somehow make it <br/>
better??????<br/>
<br/>

&quot;People take different roads seeking <br/>
fulfillment and happiness. Just <br/>
because they&#39;re not on your road <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ve gotten lost.&quot;<br/>
