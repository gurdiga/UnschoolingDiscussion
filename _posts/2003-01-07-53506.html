  This really got me to thinking.  I wonder if we all use the same word, <br/>
boredom, to describe an emotion that really may be unique to each of us.<br/>
  For me, boredom usually occurs when I want to do something, but am kept <br/>
from doing it, and nothing else is quite as good.  So it&#39;s closely related to <br/>
frustration.  I WANT to play on the computer, but someone else is sitting <br/>
there.  I WAS PLANNING to spend the day with my daughter (she&#39;s grown up and <br/>
moved out), but the car isn&#39;t running.  Now, I COULD wash the dishes or fold <br/>
the clothes.  There&#39;s always plenty of housework to do.  But I&#39;d still be <br/>
bored.  Boredom isn&#39;t having nothing to do, it&#39;s being unable to do what I <br/>
really want to be doing.<br/>
  I think (based on some conversations I&#39;ve heard) that when kids say &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
bored&quot;, parents hear &quot;I don&#39;t have anything to do&quot; or &quot;I want you to help me <br/>
think of something to do&quot;.  Maybe that&#39;s not what the kids are saying (maybe <br/>
it is).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess, to me, boredom would be described as the lack of inspiration or<br/>
excitement in the things I do. It is the monotony of the day in/day out<br/>
things I have to do to keep my family clothed and fed, and keep my house<br/>
from having a sign hung on it saying *Danger Zone*. I do find much<br/>
enjoyment in seeing my children grow, learn, interact, love. And the<br/>
processes they go through to achieve these things is anything but boring.<br/>
But it seems that in my life, I can&#39;t find that balance. I&#39;m sure this<br/>
all will change as my 5yo and 3yo get older, but these years have so much<br/>
impact on the rest of their life that I want to find this balance before<br/>
it is too late. I&#39;m also a person very much effected by the weather, and<br/>
it has been just miserable here for weeks. I know I won&#39;t feel so bored<br/>
or disenchanted with life once the sun comes out, and I&#39;m sure my<br/>
children will respond positively to my new ambitions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-922859120">Boredom to me is having plenty to do, but its not what you truely what to be doing!<br/>
 <br/>
I remember  when I was a child,  I was bored alot!   I think if I would have had art supplies or instruments around I probably wouldn&#39;t have felt that way,   a way to express myself,   but that didn&#39;t happen until I was older.     <br/>
 <br/>
When instrument lessons came along,  in school,  I was no longer bored,  (although I was with the lessons)   When at home,  I could take out my violin or play the piano.       I never did get to paint at home though or play with clay,  poor me, huh?    Pity party for Kelli,  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt;Mary J<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi<br/>
     Hard to describe really as it varies, boredom has different qualities <br/>
for me. Sometimes it&#39;s when I know I want to do something (actually I NEED <br/>
to do something) and I can&#39;t figure out what that &#39;something&#39; is, nothing <br/>
else will do...it makes me feel sick.<br/>
<br/>
Other times it feels like I&#39;m slowly dying, this is usually when I work for <br/>
someone else, in fact more than once while employed (and on courses) it&#39;s <br/>
ended in clinical depression. It&#39;s like a deadening of the soul...I need <br/>
something more interesting than this kind of thing but more so. This always <br/>
happes within 3 months of starting whatever it is.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s haunted my life I haven&#39;t been able to stick to a &#39;normal&#39; job. This <br/>
isn&#39;t something I normaly talk about as to tell the truth I feel a failure, <br/>
even though I&#39;ve chosen to stay at home with my children my failure to stay <br/>
in a job or stick a course still haunts me. I do like being at home but over <br/>
here it has even less standing than in the US.<br/>
<br/>
I like being at home but I always think I should be doing something else, <br/>
maybe something to do with my upbringing? Brought up in a single parent <br/>
hosuehold where working is they key to self esteem. My mother actually said <br/>
top OD once &quot; it doesn&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t have any fun in life as long as <br/>
you&#39;ve got a good job&quot;  I mean...what!<br/>
<br/>
This is turning out to be much harder than I thought. I think it isn&#39;t just <br/>
boredom I have a problem with. Everyone here (UK) seems to think the key to <br/>
everything is working at paid employment or being self employed. Even in <br/>
counselling this comes in. Maybe I&#39;m just suited to being a domestic person? <br/>
I feel so restless but maybe it&#39;s coming from beig uder constat pressure to <br/>
be a &#39;success&#39;? Annoys the hell out of me though that the majority of people <br/>
assume you must be stupid if you&#39;re at home full time. I really hate that <br/>
lack of respect.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s sounding like it has some elements of depression. Maybe Sensonal<br/>
Affective Disorder (SAD) which sun as people suggested helps. The worst part<br/>
about depression is that it&#39;s self-perpetuating. Sometimes there may be a<br/>
specific something that has build up to make us feel trapped but depression<br/>
makes none of the solutions seem worthwhile.<br/>
<br/>
So is it the monotony of life that&#39;s making you feel bored/depressed? Or is<br/>
it the depression that&#39;s making life seem monotonous?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a problem like that.  I get extremely bored with my surroundings, what <br/>
I&#39;m doing, whatever, and I have to make a change.  I&#39;m surprised I&#39;ve only <br/>
been married twice.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I usually make jobs last more than 3 months, though.  Unless it&#39;s a temp job. <br/>
 I walked out of a temp job a couple of years ago.  Secretly spirited my <br/>
office plants away, left for lunch and never went back.  I was so INCREDIBLY <br/>
bored.  But they all loved me there so much that I had negotiated reduced <br/>
hours (the work was too easy for me).  <br/>
<br/>
I also move a lot.  The longest I&#39;ve been in any one house is 5 years, <br/>
although I&#39;ve lived in the same city for 10 (with a little break to somewhere <br/>
else in between).  Luckily I married someone who grew up in the Air Force, so <br/>
he&#39;s not averse.  My kids have suffered in some ways, but I believe they have <br/>
benefitted, as well.  <br/>
<br/>
I never thought that I would be one to travel a lot.  But I did start <br/>
travelling about 8 years ago, and it has made a heck of a difference.  I just <br/>
need to get outta Dodge every once in a while, and it helps me not want to <br/>
move entirely.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I used to rationalize all the moves and discontent as circumstantial, but as <br/>
I look back now on 20 years of it, I can see that it&#39;s a pattern for me.  It <br/>
would be good to know exactly why it&#39;s so appealing.<br/>
<br/>
All that said, I&#39;m going back to work (temporarily &lt;g&gt;).  Dh wants to start a <br/>
side business this year, and the economy has his job on the edge, so we&#39;re <br/>
trying to get our ducks in a row.  So if you don&#39;t see me around here much, <br/>
you&#39;ll know why.<br/>
