&lt;&lt; I am interested in hearing a little of a typical day in the life of an<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Today was typical -- it all fell apart -- how&#39;s that for a plan?<br/>
<br/>
Son (7 yo) had his piano lesson scheduled for 2:00.  He practiced as much as <br/>
he felt he needed to.  (His teacher is very pleased. And we like her.)  We <br/>
went.  The class had been cancelled.  We went for ice cream cones <br/>
anyway--something we do after most piano lessons -- the teacher&#39;s house is on <br/>
the way!!  :)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (6 yo) and I usually go to the library while son is at piano.  So <br/>
now that has been postponed until tomorrow.  Along with haircuts.  Also <br/>
conveniently located.  But last time my daughter freaked out at haircuts <br/>
because she said the barber looked scary -- so we&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
Projects -- we have (maybe because they are younger) few long-term need a lot <br/>
of commitment type projects.  We have a couple of raised bed gardens and the <br/>
kids and I putter there, we feed the birds (we did a birdwatching project <br/>
last year), we take care of the cats and fish.  But art and science and <br/>
reading -- any of that is usually done at a sitting.  Or at most involves a <br/>
trip to the store to get supplies -- plaster of Paris is now on the list -- <br/>
my MIL got us a cool &quot;science projects&quot; book for Christmas -- mostly fun <br/>
stuff -- how to make goop and a volcano and your own spray paint -- hmmm, <br/>
maybe she doesn&#39;t like me a much as I thought!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Handwriting -- my son is an extremely reluctant writer and I don&#39;t push it.  <br/>
He uses the computer when needed.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter, otoh, has lovely handwriting for 6 and likes to make up stories <br/>
and, latest, do crossword puzzles.<br/>
<br/>
So we putter and do a lot of different things and keep a lot of materials <br/>
available -- computer and art supplies and microscope and, yesterday we <br/>
downloaded Beatles songs and danced and so what subject is that -- is that a <br/>
project?<br/>
<br/>
Math is a series of CDs and a chalkboard and books and graph paper and money <br/>
to spend (yesterday my daughter and I totalled up her life savings -- over <br/>
$21 so she is happy), etc., etc.  Just one darn thing after another. <br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s &quot;lesson&quot; also included a trip to the Goodwill drop off location in <br/>
our town.  Along with the appropriate answers to the usual questions.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well...The kids slept in today (yippeeH!) So I got to<br/>
eat my toast and jam and drink my coffee in peace and<br/>
quiet. While the youngest/ds woke up off and on and<br/>
nursed. Finally...about 11:30 the kids decided to wake<br/>
up. Ds wanted to go outside and ride his bike so we<br/>
got dressed. He rode around the apartment complex. <br/>
<br/>
By the time we got back dh(he works from home) had<br/>
started some lunch and dd was dressed. Dd was playing<br/>
with her dolls. I finished fixing lunch then we sat<br/>
down to eat. after lunch dd did some drawing she is<br/>
really getting into drawing faces and making sure all<br/>
the body parts are accounted ie. noses, hair etc. Ds<br/>
joined in with her drawing. Then ds wanted a marker dd<br/>
had so we did some talking about taking turns sharing<br/>
etc. The conflict never really got resolved. <br/>
<br/>
Dd went to her room and drew for a while then she came<br/>
out to watch a Magic School Bus Video. Several<br/>
conflicts arose with dd saying ds was being loud and<br/>
where each of them wanted to sit. All those needed to<br/>
be worked out then finally peace they watch the video.<br/>
While the kids did things independently I tried to<br/>
pick up the house a little and read a book. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tried to get the kids outside a bit today but not<br/>
motivated so we didn&#39;t. Dd is getting ready to get<br/>
some special dad time running some errands with her<br/>
father. Ds will be going down for a late nap most<br/>
likely. ---woops change of plans dd decided to stay<br/>
home, ds will go with dad. <br/>
<br/>
What will the evening hold? Good question. Most likely<br/>
diner. Lots of questions like how do I spell this mom.<br/>
Reading books. Watching videos. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say we have a typical day ever. We have a<br/>
loose weekly schedule of going to library at least<br/>
once a week and dd has dance class. My dh and I and<br/>
the kids attend a weekly class for some studies we are<br/>
doing together. <br/>
<br/>
Things my kids have known to do during the day<br/>
include: Make flour salt etc. concoctions, paint,<br/>
draw, watch lots of videos, read, practice writing, go<br/>
grocery shopping, thrift store shopping, I check my<br/>
email, bake cookies, play, and play, and play...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Does each child have a project they are working on?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No projects currently here kids have their focuses.<br/>
ds-2 likes me to read him anything about big trucks<br/>
and big concstruction equipment. Dd-5 is practicing<br/>
writing some words. Sometimes she writes them herself<br/>
but often she uses a stencil.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you approach the art of writing with<br/>
&gt; unschooling? <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Writing as just learning how to write letters or<br/>
writing to get accross ideas or both? dd-5 is<br/>
practicing her letters. She likes to type some words<br/>
on the computer, especially her name. As far as<br/>
getting ideas accross. I figure when getting something<br/>
accross in words on paper become important to them<br/>
they will. <br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>
Samantha<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-588486786">A typicla day...  hmmmm...  well, maybe I can tell you <br/>
about today instead :-)  The kids usually get up before <br/>
us unless there&#39;s a particular reason for getting up.  <br/>
They play together (they&#39;re 5 and 4, wow, I can&#39;t <br/>
believe it!) until we get up or they get hungry, we <br/>
eat, they play some more, they draw or paint or <br/>
whatever.  Today we de-trimmed the tree, and they found <br/>
a cd-rom which hasn&#39;t been in circulation for a while, <br/>
so they did some of that.  Later, they watched Madeline <br/>
while I made meatballs to freeze, and now they&#39;re <br/>
asleep.  This was a fairly quiet day, we didn&#39;t have <br/>
anywhere to go or particular to do (except for the <br/>
meatballs :-) )<br/>

<div><font size="2">This isn&#39;t always a typical day, (I wonder if there is such a 
thing??).&nbsp; But here is what we&#39;ve been up to.&nbsp; My kids are son (12), 
daughter (8), and daughter (5).</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">Over the past 6 weeks we have been truly &quot;unschooling&quot;.&nbsp; 
Most of the time I&#39;m more of a relaxed homeschooler, and not a strictly 
unschooler as it is defined by many.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">This week we went back to &quot;structure&quot; which only includes one 
sentence of copywork, some kind of math, and reading.&nbsp; The rest is entirely 
up to them.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">I&#39;ll tell you about today:</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">We got up, showered, ate breakfast, worked on our Bible verse 
for the week (we&#39;re doing some catechism work), prayed together.&nbsp; Then we 
did a handwriting exercise in lieu of copywork.&nbsp; After that we did some 
Saxon math.&nbsp; My son picked up some books on Wed from the library on coin 
collecting.&nbsp; He decided to check out the US Mint online and read about 
different states and their state facts, as well as looked at some of their state 
quarters. He decided he&#39;d like to design his own quarter...and thinks he will 
have to look up facts about another state (since PA is already 
done).</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">My daughter has been working on fabric painting.&nbsp; My son 
joined in briefly but we didn&#39;t have enough supplies and then we had to leave 
for the pediatrician.&nbsp; After that, my daughter had swim team 
practice.&nbsp; Tonight, my son is watching discovery channel, and my daughter 
is probably reading a book.&nbsp; My youngest daughter kind of dabbles in 
whatever the others are doing.</font></div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure we have typical days, but we do have seasonal patterns that I<br/>
pretty much count on.  Winter finds us content to stay at home more and we<br/>
tend to eat more &#39;meals&#39;, as opposed to just snacking.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does each child have a project they are working on?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on how you define project.  The kids stay busy most of the time.<br/>
Today two of my children have guests over, as school is still out here. So<br/>
they are  playing and talking and generally well, driving me nuts.  Lego<br/>
cities or K&#39;nex marathongs happen sometimes. Major outside play will take<br/>
over in the summer.  I forgot to buy binoculars for one child.. shoot.  My<br/>
10 year old reads a great deal in his bedroom, leaving me clueless as to<br/>
what he&#39;s into. For about 6-8 weeks in the early fall we were playing board<br/>
games for hours every day. Chess, Quarto, Set, Five Crowns, and  whole host<br/>
of others.  That has since slowed down to just playnig with<br/>
Dad at night and on the weekends.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of projects were you thinking of?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you approach the art of writing with unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mine are too young or not interested in writing stories or essays at the<br/>
moment.   I&#39;m sort of at a loss to define how we approach it?  I suppose we<br/>
don&#39;t approach it at all.   Does it sound weird to say we either write or we<br/>
don&#39;t?  My current 10 year old son has a different times written out battle<br/>
scenes and when he was in that phase he just did it. He&#39;d ask me to spell a<br/>
word here or there, but he never wanted me to actually read his work.  With<br/>
my 18 year old we went through a few books that talked about writing and I<br/>
found Write Source to have some great sourcebooks that showcased different<br/>
kinds of writing, but she&#39;s never been interested in actually producing<br/>
anything for a reading audience.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of writing are you thinking of?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268194972">I can&#39;t say we have routine. I sometimes wish we did but then I am glad<br/>
we don&#39;t either. Only routine thing in our day is my 1 year old&#39;s naps<br/>
but lately those have not been so routine. *L*<br/>
<br/>
Today we got up ate breakfast together. Nathan 9 job is to feed the dogs<br/>
and take them out so he does that while Chelsea 8 feeds her cat when she<br/>
can find him.  Cody 6 and Chelsea decided to play house most of the<br/>
morning. Brittney 11 was reading about Greek Myths (her latest passion)<br/>
and then got the little ones to play chess with her.<br/>
<br/>
Nathan played legos and built more contraptions. I am amazed at what he<br/>
does with those things. Then asked if I would help him with his new<br/>
Tarot deck. All my kids have a tarot deck. They use them for readings or<br/>
dream work (which they then write into journals) or sometimes a card<br/>
will spark a story. Nate likes Dragons so he got a dragon tarot deck and<br/>
we had fun looking at the pictures and figuring out what they said to<br/>
him. Then he asked me to do a reading with my deck for him which we did<br/>
and led us to talk about Ancient Egypt ( my deck has Gods and Goddess<br/>
from different cultures on it). Lunch time brought us all into the<br/>
kitchen to cook mac and cheese and check on the stew in the crock pot.<br/>
Chelsea then deciced she wanted dessert to go with dinner so we made a<br/>
cake in my bread machine to see if it worked.<br/>
<br/>
Next we read some poems on snow (it started snowing) and danced around<br/>
the house like snowflakes. Acted out a snow man poem and then made<br/>
snowflakes for the window out of silver pipe cleaners and crystal beads.<br/>
Made some popcorn and watched The Willows in Winter.<br/>
<br/>
Later we will make dinner rolls and eat dinner. Clean up and it will be<br/>
reading time and journal time. (ok so that is sort of routine part of<br/>
the day) Kid will play games and then later go to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Thats our day ...today anyhow.<br/>

learning experiences such as these. In Public School,<br/>
sadly, if your son wanted to use his tarot deck in the<br/>
supposed &quot;free time&quot;, he most likely would not be<br/>
encouraged, and would almost definitely be viewed as<br/>
&quot;wierd&quot; for it. I say again, way cool.<br/>
