<div id="ygrps-yiv-89815808">&quot;Can you talk more about the resource day.  Sounds real interesting.  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
We have use of a nice community center every Wed. from 10a-1p. There is a <br/>
large Gymn with Basketball hoops, a stage, a room with Tv/VCR and long tables <br/>
where the Yugio/Mage Knight fans congregate. A dance room has space for <br/>
anything else they want to do, we bring blocks, brio train track, plastic <br/>
bugs/lizards/bats etc... for the younger ones, have parties, play games, <br/>
share interests, play music on their sound system, barter, do art/craft <br/>
projects (the floor is tile, so easy clean up) cook etc..<br/>
Anything goes.<br/>
And the best part is the community center has a wonderful park with picnic <br/>
benches and it&#39;s right on the BAY. A HUGE dock is right next to the center <br/>
and the kids run up and down chasing seagulls and often end up splashing at <br/>
the waters edge or mucking about for fish, watching fishermen etc...<br/>
It&#39;s really awesome and I think we&#39;ve influenced a few folks to really think <br/>
about unschooling in a whole new way.<br/>
We are the only truly inclusive group that I know of and we get all the most <br/>
interesting and open minded folks in Pensacola!! For the most part anyway....<br/>
:)<br/>
AND, we&#39;re hosting the first ever LIFE (Learning In Freedom Everyday) <br/>
FunFest. It&#39;s a mini-conference with speakers (local only), vendors and <br/>
workshops all day.<br/>
We&#39;re really excited!<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
