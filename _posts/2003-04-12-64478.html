&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve always felt that Brianna was meant for me to raise. I&#39;ve told her<br/>
that her bio-mom had to have her because I couldn&#39;t. Have you read anything<br/>
about reincarnation? If you&#39;d like, we can talk of this off list. Although,<br/>
reincarnation has much to do w/ my decision to unschool!!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t given it much thought - being &quot;chosen&quot; by my kids, but one day when<br/>
Mackenzie was 2, he said to me &quot;Remember that time when you were dressed<br/>
like a white princess and you walked down a long trail with lots of people<br/>
beside it and dad was standing on the other end, and I was floating on the<br/>
ceiling and watching you?&quot; All I can figure from that conversation was that<br/>
he was present at our wedding, *years* before he was conceived. Asa has said<br/>
some very similar stuff when she was a young toddler, she mentioned our<br/>
wedding once too. I do believe now that they chose us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545309421">Yes. It&#39;s really amazing to hear what these children say!! As Brianna says, &quot;I can say anything to you!!&quot; That&#39;s what we have. Trust. Love. Honesty. Acceptance.<br/>
I think it takes that for the kids to be able to verbalize these concepts.<br/>
