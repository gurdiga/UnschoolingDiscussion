<div id="ygrps-yiv-84191166">Sigh. A really good AP friend and hsing buddy of mine has decided that unschooling <br/>
is too relaxed for her 5 yo and has seen decided to start The Well Trained Mind<br/>
curriculum. I am so bummed..she actually had read Holt before I did and it seemed<br/>
like we were going along the same path...not exactly sure what happened.<br/>
<br/>
She has gone from very relaxed, letting her kids stay up late to now waking them<br/>
at 8 am to get ready to &quot;do school&quot;. She feels that she and her dd do better with <br/>
structure. It started with her doing 100 EZ lessons...she told me how great it <br/>
was going...how her dd had started sounding out words and was starting to read.<br/>
I had minor pangs of guilt..wondering if I should be doing anything formal with<br/>
Jason...then I asked her a little while later how her dd was enjoying the lessons...<br/>
the response was, oh she hates them, but she is learning! Ack!<br/>
<br/>
Then she was telling me this story...she had planned on playing boggle jr as part of<br/>
their lessons, but had run out of time during &quot;school&quot; time so they played it later<br/>
during the day. Her dh was asking her dd what she had done during &quot;school&quot;. When<br/>
her dd did not mention Boggle, my friend pointed it out and was so happy when her<br/>
dd looked at her and said, &quot;that was school?&quot;. My friend was so excited that her dd<br/>
had learned something without even realizing that it was school...I don&#39;t think that <br/>
she even realized that what her dd was really learning was that learning was only<br/>
supposed to happen during &quot;school time&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I love my friend to death and am so bummed...we seemed to be on the same wavelength<br/>
on so many things (we have known each other since the kids were 1). I haven&#39;t said<br/>
much yet...she knows the arguments for unschooling. It is her choice I realize.<br/>
But it was fun to have someone who &quot;got&quot; where I was coming from. Ah well...<br/>

up in their anxiety that &#39;little Jimmy&#39; isn&#39;t reading at 5 like Mrs Next Door&#39;s child and they start worrying about Harvard when the kids is 6.<br/>
IT&#39;s so sad but I&#39;ve found that saying anything loses me friends or they avoid me anyway cos they feel guilty. It&#39;s also sad for your child losing a freind too. My son really likes a boy in this area.<br/>
They were sort of unschooling (except for maths!) but now she&#39;s gone and and bought curriculum. Son can&#39;t figure out why he can&#39;t see this lad any more. It&#39;s not cos she&#39;s avoiding me (yet) but her<br/>
child is so busy doiing school that he hasn&#39;t got time to play. He&#39;s not allow to sleep-over cos the next day is a &#39;school&#39; day.<br/>
There are days when I feel very lonely and I know my kids do too cos no-one has time to play, to hang out, cos they are all doing &#39;school-at-home&#39;. Then I feel guilty that I made them move from back<br/>
home where everyone we knew was a relaxed unschooler to here where so many poeple are terrified that their child will &#39;fall behind&#39;.<br/>
One woman I knew was giving her daughter hell cos the child couldn&#39;t read at 6. When I pointed out that as the average age of reading is about 7, at least 50% of kids wont read until after they are 7 (I<br/>
noticed people don&#39;t understand averages at all) she snarled that her daughter wasn&#39;t going to be one of those &#39;failures&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I am from Mars sometimes :-(<br/>

<br/>
I agree that it is her choice, but I wonder if she really grasps all of<br/>
the arguments for unschooling.  Does she really understand in her gut<br/>
that if you force children to do things they learn to loathe them and<br/>
may loathe an entire broad category of knowledge just because of a few<br/>
worksheets or one tiresome textbook?<br/>

Stephanie, be patient. She&#39;ll be back. (Well, my <br/>
&quot;gaze-into-my-crystal-ball prediction record <br/>
isn&#39;t flawless, but...) I also was seduced by TWTM. I liked the <br/>
natural approach to history and learning that dovetails well with <br/>
Charlotte Mason. Also it makes the parent feel so &quot;noble&quot; for <br/>
structuring a classical education. And many kids who follow that <br/>
plan do seem to be ahead of their peers in terms of content <br/>
exposure and mastery.<br/>
<br/>
What happened to me was that I encountered a philosophical <br/>
crisis when I realized how much I had taken back control of our <br/>
lives because of following these systems. As I&#39;ve shared before, <br/>
who I am is much more trusting and relaxed. But these books <br/>
are so tempting and the authors always make it sound easy and <br/>
doable... and natural! And TWTM actually debunks unschooling <br/>
in the first chapter as ridiculous. (Sonlight was similar in its <br/>
promise that the system was natural and easy--I know the <br/>
originators of that curricula personally and what it started out as <br/>
and what it&#39;s become are so different. It&#39;s become the noose <br/>
around a homeschooling mother&#39;s neck).<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, though, is what does the mother do when her kids <br/>
are bucking her and  no longer like the system? For moms who <br/>
are naturally more inclined to trust their kids, I think they&#39;ll <br/>
gravitate back to either relaxed homeschooling or even <br/>
unschooling. We have been on that gradual return for years and <br/>
finally are there.<br/>
<br/>
I hate it when friends part philosophical company. I&#39;m <br/>
experiencing this theologically with all of my longterm friends <br/>
and it&#39;s the hardest thing I&#39;ve ever gone through with them. So I <br/>
can empathize totally with the pain.<br/>
<br/>
Hope she comes around!<br/>

take Cameron out of school. I LOVED IT! It would have been right up my own <br/>

<br/>
But it was NOT for my child. And I KNOW that is more important. It took me <br/>
about two more months to find Unschooling, and by then, he was out of school.<br/>

I&#39;D still like to follow TWTM! Maybe I WILL! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

I am another who went from unschooling to relaxed homeschooling to Sonlight<br/>
to TWTM (then TOG) and here I am back to where I started in the first place.<br/>
I agree that most likely the children will convince her that this type of<br/>
schooling won&#39;t work.  I agree that you should be patient.  Keep the<br/>
relationship open, so when she needs to talk about the fact that she cannot<br/>
get her children to complete all this school work, you will be there to tell<br/>
her it doesn&#39;t have to be done that way!<br/>

All of these are Christian curriculums, basically with a classical education<br/>
bent.  All have websites.<br/>
<br/>
TWTM - The Well Trained Mind by Susan Bauer and Jess Wise Bauer (This is a<br/>
book that lays out a method for a classical education and gives ideas and<br/>
resources)<br/>
<br/>
TOG - Tapestry of Grace by Marcia Sommerville  (This is a relatively new<br/>
classical curriculum.  Her Year 2 - which covers the Fall of Rome to the<br/>
Writing of the Constitution is published,  Year 3 is coming out in units now<br/>
and Year 1 is on hold, had to be re-written because of copyright problems).<br/>
<br/>
Sonlight Curriculum - www.sonlight.com - has curriculum for K-12 centered<br/>
around reading historical fiction/non-fiction (real books).  Also recommends<br/>
various math, science, writing programs to be used alongside their stuff.<br/>
Kind of a unit study approach, more reading than hands-on.<br/>

Hi Stephanie,<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like she began having doubts, and reading TWTM gave her a <br/>
planned course to follow that guarantees a well-educated child (or so <br/>
the authors imply &lt;g&gt;).  She might follow it for a while, but it is <br/>
intense, very-structured, and stressful for parents (not to mention <br/>
the kids); I know many &quot;drop-outs&quot; from TWTM.  The book sits on my <br/>
bookshelf; enough said?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Everyone finds their own way to homeschool; your friend might find <br/>
her way back to unschooling, or she might not...she might end up <br/>
somewhere between unschooling and TWTM.  She&#39;s still your friend, and <br/>
I&#39;m sure there are lots of things you can continue to share with <br/>
her.  By continuing the friendship, you are providing her with the <br/>
opportunity to compare the rigors of TWTM with the relaxed, unique <br/>
learning that happens in unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820113668">Oh, that poor kid...sheesh, five years of age and already hating <br/>
learning. <br/>
<br/>
Our pastor&#39;s wife told me of some group, I think in Africa, where <br/>
they start &quot;lessons&quot; when a child has lost the first two teeth and <br/>
can reach his arm up over the top of his head, and touch the lobe of <br/>
the ear on the opposite side with his fingers. There is not a five <br/>
year old on the planet for whom that is true: first two teeth AND <br/>
touch the lobe of the ear. Her little boy, age three, couldn&#39;t even <br/>
touch the top of his opposite ear! She never started &quot;lessons&quot; with <br/>
any of her kids before age 7.<br/>
<br/>
I figure, if we were to go with Well Trained Mind, we&#39;d start about <br/>
NOW...at ages 10 and 8...well, maybe with the 10year old. But this <br/>
starting kids at 3 and 4 years of age...and that is what they discuss <br/>
on the forum for WTM...&quot;what math curriculum would you recommend for <br/>
preschool?&quot; ugh. Poor little kids.<br/>

&gt; grasps all of<br/>
&gt; the arguments for unschooling.  Does she really understand in her gut<br/>
&gt; that if you force children to do things they learn to loathe them and<br/>
&gt; may loathe an entire broad category of knowledge just because of a few<br/>
&gt; worksheets or one tiresome textbook?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know. I do know that she has read all of Holt&#39;s books etc. We met<br/>
on an AP message board and we have always shared a belief that kids do<br/>
things when they are ready (weaning, moving into their own beds etc).<br/>
<br/>
I think that TWTM appeals to her, so she is assuming that the kids will go right<br/>
along. To her it makes sense. I do believe that she is going to take a relaxed<br/>
approach with it (not follow the schedule exactly).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see how it goes I guess...<br/>

<br/>
(I&#39;m guessing and hoping the latter. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
There was another mom who had a close relationship with me for a while.  I <br/>
met her in another state at an SCA event (Pennsic) and she and her whole <br/>
family came to  visit us in New Mexico twice, once just to stay at the house <br/>
and once for an event (Outlandish), and she was my SCA apprentice for a while.<br/>
<br/>
We met because she was homeschooling in Illinois and couldn&#39;t find support, <br/>
and she knew I was in the SCA.  Her three kids were about the same ages as <br/>
mine, but all girls.  <br/>
<br/>
They were very structured homeschoolers, and Christian.  <br/>
<br/>
I tried various ways to point out to her that all the SCA arts she was <br/>
learning she had learned out of pure joyous desire and excitement.  Weaving, <br/>
costuming, all kinds of things.  She was a stenciller and did AMAZING wall <br/>
art in many colors, making her own stencils and had made some good money <br/>
doing that.  She taught other people conventions.  <br/>
<br/>
She just couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t even try to transfer that to her own children&#39;s <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
When they were at my house (these are stories I&#39;ve told before) her daughter <br/>
was helping me make cookies.  She had a measuring cup heaped up with flour, <br/>
and was waiting pointedly for SOMETHING.  I looked at her and she looked at <br/>
me.  She said she needed a tableknife to level the flour with.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  A TABLE knife!  <br/>
<br/>
I gave her one, but inside my thoughts just kinda flew to &quot;why not the handle <br/>
of the other measuring cup?  Why not just shake it over the flour canister <br/>
until it&#39;s level?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But her mom had said there was one right way to do it.<br/>
<br/>
The younger kids had gotten out the coloring book box, and Holly had a <br/>
workbook.  She came to me to read the directions to her.  It said something <br/>
like &quot;in red, circle all the pictures that sound like [whatever]&quot;--something <br/>
like that.  But it specified a color.  She said, &quot;Do I have to use red?&quot;  <br/>
&quot;No, I said, do whatever you want with it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After she went away, the other mom said QUITE snootily that SHE thought it <br/>
was important for kids to learn to follow directions.<br/>
<br/>
Huh.<br/>

Holly HAD followed my direction to do whatever she wanted!! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

This kind of thing is really bugging me right now with friends,  of course, all of their kids are in school.    One keeps saying, &quot;well, won&#39;t it be interesting to see how all our kids turn out!&quot;  in a condescending voice.    <br/>
