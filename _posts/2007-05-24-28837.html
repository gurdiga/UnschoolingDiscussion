 </span></blockquote>I like this one because it is quality over quantity!  There are tons of <br/>
yahoo groups about unschooling but not all of them are any good.  In <br/>
fact there are a few that are very &quot;hopping&quot;, but all drivel, IMO, and <br/>
a waste of my time!  I feel that way about the one linked to the old <br/>
unschooling dot com boards.  It&#39;s almost shameful!  There are a couple <br/>
of good ones that you might like, <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/</a><br/>
and maybe, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shinewithunschooling/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shinewithunschooling/</a><br/>
<br/>
The alwaysunschooled one is good, but it is really directed towards <br/>
those with younger kids.  The shinewithunschooling is really good too, <br/>
mostly because of the people that post there!<br/>
<br/>
I check them sometimes but this list is by far my favorite!  I like <br/>
this one a lot too, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion">http://groups.google.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion</a><br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps some.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been gone for a few days at an SCA campout and I&#39;m kinda fried,  <br/>
and won&#39;t finish all the e-mail tonight, but I did find this nice  <br/>
review and wanted to say how much I appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes this list is very quiet, and I don&#39;t mind.  Years ago there  <br/>
was very little for unschoolers to find to read outside of online  <br/>
discussions or back issues of Growing Without Schooling, and  <br/>
gradually over the years more and more articles and best-of  <br/>
collections showed up on webpages that can be found even with  <br/>
google!  So it&#39;s just easier, nowadays, for people to get the answers  <br/>
to the basic questions than it used to be and I think it&#39;s great for  <br/>
them.   One can read more now in a day than we could read in a year,  <br/>
when my oldest was five.<br/>
<br/>
Good for all of you!  Good for me.  Good for all involved.<br/>
