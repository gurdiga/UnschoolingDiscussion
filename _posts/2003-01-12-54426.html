&gt;  **I personally believe that this culture puts too much stress on kids<br/>

&gt;  becoming &quot;independent.&quot; Right after they&#39;re born they&#39;re supposed to go<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  in a separate bed, in a separate room, separated by school, and later a<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  job and a new family. No wonder why this society is so incredibly<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  dysfunctional. People are continuously pushed away since they&#39;re born!**<br/>

Let&#39;s see....for starters......birthing unassisted at home, not vaxing, <br/>
co-sleeping,baby likes to plate hop (samples everybody&#39;s plate sometimes). <br/>
she can&#39;t stand to have a diaper on so we have stop fighting with her on <br/>
cause she will constantly unsnap it and take it off and since she is going <br/>
potty and we figure that she is only 18 months so it&#39;s no big deal.<br/>
She does like to put on pants now, so I have to go and make her some training <br/>
pants or panties. <br/>
A baby wearer (sling) I have not bought a swing since baby #4. Have not <br/>
bought a stroller since baby #5. Haven&#39;t done pacifiers since baby #5. Will <br/>
often shower and take or bath with my babies..... Haven&#39;t use a crib since <br/>
baby #3.<br/>
 I better stop now.....the list could get pretty long. I don&#39;t wanna bore u <br/>
guys....<br/>

&gt;  they&#39;re lonely or scared or sad. :(  Parents are urged to &quot;hook&quot; their <br/>
&gt;  children on &quot;transitional objects&quot; - blankets or snuggly animals and the <br/>
&gt; like <br/>
&gt;  - to help them separate from the parents easily. (not to be confused with <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is so sad....... some have issues when they see me when I had my little <br/>
one in a sling.....I haven&#39;t bought one of the carriers for the shopping <br/>
carts since baby #5. I feel for kid when parents will not let their kids come <br/>
with them when they are scared. Especially during thunder storms. The ones <br/>
that let their infants cry it out....That burns me....how are you meeting <br/>
their needs?<br/>
<br/>
Seems like a recipe for &gt;  producing a materialistic culture, to me.<br/>

before alot wake up.<br/>
