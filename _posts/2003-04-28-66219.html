<div id="ygrps-yiv-548249557">Hi everyone! Wow, getting through all of these emails is quite a job! I am exhausted and my head is spinning from the last couple of months of reading all of your great opinions and knowledge. Now, I must admit when I first came to your group I was totally floored and very skeptical about my own abilities to do this and about the nature of unschooling itself. So, here I am three months later still reading and still learning so much and I have to say that I am so glad that I stayed. So as I am going along now I think of you all often. I have noticed that it is really not in the &quot;schooling&quot; issues that I think of you all but in the &quot;parenting&quot; issues and I think that that is a good thing, I am redirecting my attention because I think the reality is that unschooling is a philosophy that works it&#39;s way into every  faucet of family life. So, here are a couple of issues that my family is having and I am looking for some discussion on these issues with regard to personal experience and how they fit into the &quot;unschooling&quot; philosophy. Alright, my two year old has decided to destroy her 5 month old sister. From sun up till sundown she is on a mission. With every attempt I try to calmly explain to her that in this house nobody hurts anybody else, mommy doesn&#39;t hurt Sadie (the 2 year old) and Sadie shoudlnt hurt Nora (the baby). She often laughs at me and returns to the game of pummeling again soon after. I know this is probably just a stage but my inclination is to time her out and tell her no no and I am trying to look at it from a different lense. Maybe there is something here that she needs and I need to figure that out and work on that? Ok, issue number two is that my 5 month old won&#39;t sleep through the night. I know,. I know, what 5 month old will? My approach with Molly and Sadie was to let them kind of fuss themselves to sleep by now but tonight when I laid her down and she cried I just couldnt help but second guess myself and wonder if this was really the way to do it/ So I am looking for some advise there and lastly my 10 year old I have written about before. She is my dd from a previous relationship that ended pretty much at birth. It has been a stressful relationship ever since and he is dead set against homeschooling (never mind unschooling which I havent even mentioned) I am at a lose with her. I feel like if anyone could benefit from unschooling it would be her but I am afraid to lose custody of her and I am just afraid of the fight that will go along with pulling her out. Now when she comes home with poor grades my reactions are so different, she knows that I think school is a joke and so she is co0nfused and I just don&#39;t know what the best thing to do for her is! I am so sorry to post such a long post, but here it is! I look forward to hearing advise and experience from some great mothers and fathers out there! Kelli <br/>

I know,. I know, what 5 month old will? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My two year old doesn&#39;t.<br/>
I think for short term benefit for the parent, letting them fuss sounds <br/>
great. Long term health for the child means we put our own sleep needs on <br/>
hold for a few years if necessary and meet their needs.<br/>
I don&#39;t believe a child that is allowed to cry or fuss by themselves is going <br/>
to be as secure as a child that sleeps next to a warm body and gets their <br/>
needs met quickly.<br/>
Jalen still wakes up three or four times a night to nurse.<br/>
I was frustrated a while back, because he was getting up nearly every hour!!! <br/>
Insane for a  toddler I thought.<br/>
But now he&#39;s settled into a nice pattern and is eating a lot of solids (I <br/>
guess we didn&#39;t miss that &quot;window of opportunity&quot; lol) and I know he&#39;s not <br/>
going to be doing this forever.<br/>
Looking back from our childrens teenhood, these few years where our children <br/>
need us intensely are going to seem so shortlived.<br/>
And our children will be so secure and happy throughout their lives, all <br/>
because we didn&#39;t ignore their desires and needs, even when it meant getting <br/>
up all night! :)<br/>

About the baby, can you sleep with her?  If she&#39;s nursing, she could nurse <br/>
when she wakes up and when you get used to that neither of you has to fully <br/>
wake up.<br/>
<br/>
In the daytime, can you wear her in a sling or pack?  Then the sister can&#39;t <br/>
torment her so easily?<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;unschooling&quot; to the other dad.  Just homeschooling, if <br/>
anything.  And I would figure out a way to keep her home without him being <br/>
able to say no.  If he wants a big say, make him pay big bucks, and give her <br/>
some directly for her mental anguish if she has to stay in school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394957238">thanks for the advise Sandra:) I really appreciate it, I will use the sling more. I have one but frequently don&#39;t use it when I should be. I do nurse her during the night. I guess I get too caught up in &quot;what she should be doing&quot; ect without looking at my own instinct as a mother. About Molly, ugh, that&#39;s the hardest one. I will work on it. Kelli<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think most 5 month olds will sleep through the night without some<br/>
amount of coercion. Personally, I&#39;d rather snuggle up to sleep than cry<br/>
myself to sleep, and I&#39;m sure that babies feel the same way. Sleeping with<br/>
babies is a good way to let them know we&#39;re there with them whenever they<br/>
need us, day or night. My son never slept through the night as a baby or<br/>
toddler. I even checked Ferber&#39;s book out of the library on sleep training<br/>
and read through all his assertions that babies *need* to learn how to go to<br/>
sleep on their own or they&#39;ll *never* learn (sound familiar in a schooled<br/>
society?). But I never could let my son cry it out, though he woke every<br/>
hour to nurse. Suddenly at age 2.5, he started sleeping through the night<br/>
and has done so ever since. Like everything, kids will do it when they&#39;re<br/>
developmentally ready. He&#39;s such a sound sleeper now you can&#39;t wake him up<br/>
for anything! So much for needing to be taught... I&#39;d say just bring your<br/>
baby in bed with you and when she awakes, comfort or nurse her. She&#39;ll grow<br/>
out of it soon enough. Now that I have no babies in bed with me (and won&#39;t<br/>
until maybe grandchildren some day), I do miss it.<br/>
<br/>
As for the 2 year old, I&#39;d concentrate on finding ways to make the whole<br/>
situation safe. Obviously, she&#39;s not going to learn to not pummel her sister<br/>
for awhile, she&#39;s in that toddler developmental stage and time will<br/>
eventually change this. I found that my sling was really helpful when my<br/>
second baby was born - I kept her in it for a lot of the day so that she<br/>
could just be with me whatever I was doing with my son. It gave me a lot<br/>
more time and freedom to concentrate on doing things with him because she<br/>
was just right there with me and could nurse or whatever. She was also out<br/>
of harm&#39;s way, a definite side-benefit when you also have an active toddler!<br/>

Avery is the same way! Some nights I feel like a dairy cow ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that the days that he eats well and if he eats before going to bed he wakes up once, maybe twice, to nurce and then it&#39;s more for a quick snack. The days that he wont eat anything, I know that I&#39;ll be up all night, I try to take it a little easier that day and if I can, I catch a nap, that way I&#39;m not dead on my feet the next day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-996246547">Just wanted to chime in on the babies sleeping all night...I noticed that my kids<br/>
sleep seemed to get consistent somewhere between 2.5 and 3 yo. I always wonder if<br/>
they told folks that (instead of the typical 10 weeks) how many people would<br/>
still choose to be parents!<br/>
<br/>
I would have gone crazy if I had not had my youngest in bed with us. It is so easy<br/>
to just roll over! Plus I love how when he was little we would be in sync...I would<br/>
wake up just a minute or so before he did and was able to respond before he got <br/>
upset. SO much nicer that way then being jolted out a deep sleep by a crying baby!<br/>
