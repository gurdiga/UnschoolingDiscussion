<div id="ygrps-yiv-878893874">Ok, after reading everybodies advice, I figured that now was as good as a<br/>
time as any to put it into action. So all day I did nothing. Nothing,<br/>
that is, except what I wanted. My house has been in a total disarray<br/>
since the holidays, so I decided to start putting away some of the<br/>
presents and stuff. When I unpacked some mugs I got, 5dd thought that the<br/>
bubble sacks that they were packed in were pretty cool. She got out her<br/>
beads, pompoms, buttons, yarn, etc. and glued faces and hair on them to<br/>
make hand puppets that she called &quot;poppets&quot;. As she is doing this, I hear<br/>
her and 3yo sis talking back and forth in jibberish. I inquired what<br/>
language she was speaking and she told me &quot;Jennish&quot; (her name is Jenni).<br/>
I went back to my task at hand, and the three of us continued to only<br/>
talk to each other in this newfound language, and could pretty much tell<br/>
what each other was saying. While she was waiting for the glue to dry on<br/>
her &quot;poppets&quot;, she started writing me little notes written in &quot;Jennish&quot;.<br/>
When I didn&#39;t understand what she was trying to tell me in the notes she<br/>
got very frustrated with me. &quot;But Mom, you knew what I meant when I<br/>
talked Jennish, how come you don&#39;t when I write Jennish?&quot; Then we got<br/>
into a discussion about communication, and how her words were not the<br/>
only way I understood what she wanted. I explained that I also watch her<br/>
eyes and her hands, and that you can&#39;t see them when you are reading<br/>
something. Then she asked me if that is why I took so long doing my<br/>
e-mails. I thought, hmmm.....very observant. I told her yes, I have a<br/>
hard time because I don&#39;t always know how people intend to mean things,<br/>
and being fairly new at this whole computer thing, I don&#39;t know how to<br/>
convey and decipher <br/>
e-motions very well. It would be easier if I could see their eyes and<br/>
hands. She thought about this and went back to her poppets. After a while<br/>
or so, she came back to me, finding me buried in a load of wash. &quot;Look<br/>
Mom. My poppets have their own language too&quot;, as she proceeded to pop the<br/>
bubbles to make them talk. I asked her if she knew what they meant. She<br/>
said, &quot;No, but I know they are happy.&quot; &quot;How do you know they are happy?&quot;<br/>
And her reply was this:<br/>
&quot;Mom, sometimes you have to look at mouths too. See the smile I glued<br/>
on?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What a great day! Thanks all for your input.<br/>
