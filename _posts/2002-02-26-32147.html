<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963434662">hello everyone, i&#39;m a married/sahm/ap-np/spiritual/home educator of <br/>
3 girls ages 12, 8 & 7 months. we&#39;ve been h.s. for 3 years now.  we <br/>
have been fairly eclectic in our approach.  somedays we are strict <br/>
with the lessons & other days we unschool.  with a new baby we feel <br/>
it&#39;s best to unschool at this time.  i would like to do this. it <br/>
also fits our lifestyle which is AP/NP (attachment parenting/natural <br/>
parenting).  i feel at times they aren&#39;t learning if we don&#39;t do <br/>
some form of work each day.  we do not have workbooks in the home & <br/>
i do not plan to use them in the future.  can anyone PLEASE give me <br/>
some advice?  thank you!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, you&#39;re asking for a few words to undo years of programming that have<br/>
convinced most of the world that learning must take a certain form and offer<br/>
feedback.<br/>
<br/>
The first piece of advice is stop doing *any* lessons. No formal learning.<br/>
Pretend it&#39;s summer vacation. Unschooling can&#39;t be done part time. It<br/>
undermines the confidence you&#39;re trying to instill in them and yourself that<br/>
life is life&#39;s greatest teacher :-)<br/>
<br/>
And the next piece is to read at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com">http://www.unschooling.com</a> Read the message<br/>
boards especially. Ask lots of questions :-)<br/>
<br/>
Formal learning is being certain you can&#39;t let go of the side of the pool.<br/>
Unschooling is paddling around in the deep end :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sure - relax and take care of the new baby!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been unschooling for 4 years.  My children have continued to learn,<br/>
day after day, without any structured lessons.  My 8yo is picking up<br/>
multiplication on his own.  My 14yo has studied algebra, chemistry and<br/>
American and Texas history on his own initiative.  No workbooks - just<br/>
plenty of access to the library, to the Internet, to Mom and Dad, and to<br/>
other adults who will answer his questions.<br/>
<br/>
Read some of John Holt&#39;s books.  Read this article that was in the Houston<br/>
Chronicle yesterday.   The author, Crispin Sartwell, is chairman of<br/>
humanities and sciences at the Maryland Institute<br/>
College of Art in Baltimore:<br/>

<br/>
Deschool yourself.   Know that the educational system doesn&#39;t work, so that<br/>
copying it won&#39;t work at home either.  People learn naturally because that&#39;s<br/>
what Nature intends for them to do.  Perhaps they won&#39;t learn the same<br/>
things kids at school are learning -  but they&#39;ll be able to learn them, at<br/>
any time they become important.  An education is not just a<br/>
government-mandated set of classes on specific subjects.<br/>
<br/>
The longer we unschool, the happier we are with it.  DH thought it would<br/>
work for our first child, who is intellectually gifted, but didn&#39;t expect it<br/>
to work for our second, who is intellectually average.  It works well for<br/>
both of them.  It&#39;s the &quot;average&quot; kid who&#39;s figuring out multiplication and<br/>
division on his own, with Legos and cookies and video games.<br/>
<br/>
It works!  Trust yourself, trust the kids.<br/>
