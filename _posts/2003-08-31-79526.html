<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692768203">Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
My 9 year old son is determined to be an animal trainer when he <br/>
grows up. We were are the zoo today and the trainers we met <br/>
talked a lot about college, zoology majors etc. as prep for animal <br/>
training. I asked about things he could do now or in the near <br/>
future that were with real animals (he&#39;s interested in cheetahs <br/>
and birds of prey). Pretty much came back with blanks.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone found meaningful ways for their kids to become <br/>
involved with wildlife (not just domestic animals--we&#39;ve had pet <br/>
rats and a bunny and are planning to get a dog)?<br/>
<br/>
And does anyone know if there is a better way to prepare than all <br/>
those in class hours? My son is amazingly knowledgeable about <br/>
the animals he loves and all that without any instruction. He <br/>
reads what interests him and gleans much from nature <br/>
programs and we go to the zoo and out birding together. He&#39;s <br/>
definitely not the kind of kid who is interested in classroom <br/>
instruction of any kind.<br/>
<br/>
I just wondered what experiences some of you may have had <br/>
with kids like this (especially those who have children who went <br/>
into work with wildlife as adults, if there are any of you).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

**************************************************<br/>
<br/>
My dd, Moly (also 9) wants to be a vet. She is trying to volunteer at our <br/>
vet&#39;s office. She spends time at a local wildlife rescue/refuge as well. Her Girl <br/>
Scout leader works there and is a contact for people who have found injured <br/>
wildlife, or need opossums, raccoons, etc. removed from their homes, garages, <br/>
sheds and whatnot. She is the person who got Moly involved in caring for <br/>
animals at the nature center. At this time, they are feeding both a bald and golden <br/>
eagle, a turkey vulture, two coyote pups, an orphaned fawn, various snakes, <br/>
turtles, a cross eyed opossum, and other small birds. <br/>
<br/>
She participates in the local Audubon society, going on bird watching walks, <br/>
and some of the &quot;field trips&quot; (for lack of a better word) they offer. We also <br/>
go to K-State every now and then to go through the vet school where she can <br/>
ask questions, and out to the Kanza Prairie. She also participates in some of <br/>
our local zoo&#39;s educational programs, and although she likes most of the <br/>
programs, she isn&#39;t too happy with the zoo. Lately they have had some problems and <br/>
have been under investigation at various times in the past few years. But, to <br/>
their credit, they are working very hard at improving the conditions for the <br/>
animals; expanding habitats, making the habitats more natural and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Other things Moly does is read tons and tons of books on anything animal <br/>
related, and watch as much Animal Planet as her heart desires. Some of her <br/>
favorite shows are The Crocodile Hunter (and all the spin-offs of that) The Jeff <br/>
Corwin Experience, and Animal Cops. The last one is kind of heart wrenching to <br/>
watch, and depending on her mood, Moly will say she wants to be a vet, so she can <br/>
help the animals on the show. An animal cop, so she can rescue the animals <br/>
and arrest people who mistreat the animals, both a vet and a cop, because <br/>
sometimes the animals need both at the same time. And sometimes she gets so upset <br/>
over some horror, she just wants to do to the people the same things they do to <br/>
the animals. <br/>
<br/>
This past summer, she found out about a protest of a local pet store chain <br/>
because of their known practice of buying and selling puppy mill puppies and she <br/>
wanted to participate, so she did. <br/>
<br/>
There are many, many things a person can do. Look for nature centers, <br/>
wildlife rescues, zoos, shelters, vets... anyone who welcomes volunteers. Keep an eye <br/>
out for injured wildlife on walks, but be careful because injured animals <br/>
tend to bite, some carry rabies and bubonic plague. Raccoons tend to be rabid, <br/>
prairie dogs and gophers tend to carry the plague, crows tend to carry the west <br/>
Nile virus. Also, know that in some areas birds with injured wings are iffy. <br/>
If the wing is repairable and the bird could be returned to the wild, then they <br/>
are, but there are some new laws that state that birds with wings that have <br/>
to be amputated or are otherwise useless cannot be used as teaching birds <br/>
anymore, but must be euthanized. So don&#39;t be discouraged if that is the case in <br/>
your area too. Another thing to be aware of is local and state wildlife laws, if <br/>
your son is a &quot;collector&quot; of pets know that sometimes some animals are <br/>
endangered or protected. Our state reptile, the box turtle, is protected. When my <br/>
kids find one on the road, we let them keep it for a few days to check that it is <br/>
healthy and not in need of vet attention. Then we release them far out in the <br/>
country or at the nature center, as it is illegal to keep them, no matter <br/>
that the kids really want one as a pet! <br/>
<br/>
Good luck to your son!<br/>
~Nancy<br/>
<br/>
We call them dumb animals, and so they are, for they cannot tell us how they <br/>
feel, but they do not suffer less because they have no words. <br/>

I just wondered what experiences some of you may have had <br/>
with kids like this (especially those who have children who went <br/>
into work with wildlife as adults, if there are any of you).<br/>
Columbia has a wildlife rescue organization. It&#39;s mostly raptors, but they <br/>
rehabilitate ANYTHING wild (injured turtles, foxes, opossums, bobcats, bunnies). <br/>
They know about me: I get all their domestic rabbits. When the novelty has <br/>
worn off, some folks think that they can just release a domestic bunny out into <br/>
the wild---or that they can drop it of at Wildlife Care. But since they aren&#39;t <br/>
wild and I have a bunny cage....   Anyway, you might try asking around for <br/>
something similar---or STARTING something similar. Ours was started with grants. <br/>
It&#39;s a small building with a lot of cages (mostly dog crates and bird cages).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m SURE that if your son would start one, he could get plenty of press <br/>
coverage, grants, donations, and volunteers as well as info and assistance from the <br/>
zoo (and not just your own). He would need special permission of some sort to <br/>
handle raptors as it&#39;s illegal to posess many of the birds of prey--or even a <br/>
feather!<br/>
<br/>
The organization here is Wildlife Care of Carolina.  5551 Bush River Road <br/>
Columbia, SC 29212   (803) 772 3994. I can&#39;t imagine that they wouldn&#39;t agree to <br/>
talk with you and answer questions.<br/>
<br/>
We also know of a wolf rehab group in North Carolina. I&#39;m sure that if you <br/>
asked around, you&#39;ll find others nearby with the same interest and SOMEONE <br/>
willing to give him a leg up. I know that Wildlife Care is always in need of money <br/>
AND volunteers!<br/>
<br/>
As for animal TRAINING, he might want to look into movies. If there are any <br/>
movies made in your area, there&#39;s bound to be a wrangler. Hook up with one. <br/>
Agree to kennel sit/scoop poop/water & feed the animals during the week when most <br/>
kids are in school. All that will also work with dog breeders. We often need <br/>
someone to &quot;man the kennel&quot; during a show weekend. With some time, he could <br/>
soon be GOING to the shows as an assistant and handling the dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Ren&#39;s recently gotten into falconry and has been training raptors----she can <br/>
give some info there.<br/>
<br/>
An ability to handle and understand animals is another one of those <br/>
&quot;intelligences&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck! A boy after my own heart!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311037415">OH! And look around for a naturalist! Rudy Mancke is our local guru. He&#39;s <br/>
INCREDIBLE and would be happy to talk with your son about ALL things wild---birds <br/>
and animals and rocks and plants! He is amazing!<br/>
<br/>
You can google him for his webpage---oh hell, so can I :<br/>

<br/>
Actually, go ahead and google him---he pops up several times! I can get you <br/>

who would be willing to talk with your son.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-444281941">I know there are student divisions of the American Zoo Keeper <br/>
Association and the (International?) Association of Avian Educators <br/>
and Trainers.  I think you need to be high school age but they have <br/>
notices of internships, conferences and other opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter wants to be an avian vet and bird trainer.  She has been <br/>
volunteering at the zoo for the last couple of years and they have a <br/>
special bird show.  When I talked to the people who do the show, I <br/>
got the feeling that their education came first so they didn&#39;t even <br/>
consider the fact that you can train animals without a degree.  I <br/>
think in the end though, it will boil down to who does the best job.<br/>
<br/>
I was talking to a long time friend in CO yesterday and she said her <br/>
24 year old daughter will be graduating from college after this <br/>
September and will finally be able to start creating web pages for <br/>
people.  My 13 year old daughter has been making web pages for 2 <br/>
years now and has several clients including a public school plus a <br/>
waiting list.  I don&#39;t think it ever dawned on my friend that you can <br/>
just start learning it on your own. :-)  Same thing with the zoo <br/>
people.<br/>

Also some friends of mine have different pets like reptiles of different types <br/>
and tarantulas and they go into the schools to answer questions and let the kids <br/>
have contact with these animals that they might not otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
My boys love animals so we have lots of them.  Some of the usual pets and <br/>
some of the not so usual pets.  They love going to different shows.  We went to a <br/>
reptile show yesterday, they had lots there to see and touch and my boys <br/>
would ask questions etc and they loved it and the breeders, showers and animal <br/>
rescue groups that were there just loved my boys.<br/>
<br/>
What about an animal shelter.  They always need volunteers.<br/>

Exactly the problem Moly is running into with our vet. She wants to, he would <br/>
love to have her, the insurance might not like it too much! So we plug ahead <br/>

anywhere he could talk to people who take care of those animals, and spend time <br/>
with the animals.  The more he picks up and learns and understands, the more <br/>
likely he&#39;d be able to get a job without a degree.  Some will hire experience <br/>
over knowledge.  He would possibly be limited, but not totally so.  <br/>
<br/>
Or worse comes to worse, maybe he could tackle those courses after he has <br/>
learned so much he can pass the tests and pick up anything he might&#39;ve missed.  <br/>
If he really had a clear purpose for that degree, and there&#39;s no way around <br/>
getting it, I betcha he could whip thru. I dunno, I understand that this is a <br/>
tough thing. <br/>
<br/>
All these questions lately about classes and courses...we have to find ways <br/>
to get this info to these kids without jumping all these ridiculous hoops that <br/>
most people jump without even thinking about it.  Independent study, mail or <br/>
online courses, and the like are a step up, but they still have many of the <br/>
same hoops.  Tests, scores, time limits, etc. <br/>
<br/>
 And getting more info about stuff before we start it, which from my own <br/>
experience, is so hard to do.  I am right now trying to track down a specific <br/>
teacher at the community college because no one seems to know what&#39;s entailed in <br/>
the computer class for kids, there.  From reading other&#39;s experience, and from <br/>
my kid&#39;s concerns, we don&#39;t want to pay for a class where he won&#39;t learn much <br/>
more than he already knows, or is so constrictive he&#39;s going to quit right <br/>
away.  Why is there such a dearth of info? Are they hiding it somewhere, and why? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098159276">Since his interest is in training animals, perhaps he should contact <br/>
an organization that does that, like the people who raise and train <br/>
guide dogs, for instance.  Working with dogs that will eventually <br/>
help people would be quite meaningful.  Guide Dogs for the Blind has <br/>
a training facility in Boring, OR.  I don&#39;t know if they work with <br/>
children, but here&#39;s the link to their website.    <br/>

Good luck finding some animal contact for him!<br/>
