ARG!  I just read this.  First let me say it freaked me out - I&#39;ve never<br/>
seen such.  LOL... Secondly, interestingly, it described me perfectly as<br/>
a child and in to adulthood... But I have to say, pretty much ALL of<br/>
that cleared up once I finally got on the proper dose of thyroid meds.<br/>
Except for maybe the forgetfulness - as I said before, I forget my meds,<br/>
but am reminded when the weird cravings and the negative mental aspects<br/>
set in... :)  &quot;Why am I sad and licking the salt shaker?... Oh, I must<br/>
have forgotten my meds...&quot;  lol... Hm.  Might be worth a comparative<br/>
study of some sort I imagine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just curious, but what freaked you out?  Have you not ever read indications <br/>
for homeopathic remedies before?  They can sound scary, but they&#39;re just <br/>
indications as to what remedy you might need.<br/>

prevented the thyroid problems.  Glad your problems cleared up on <br/>
thyroid.  Mine didn&#39;t completely (fatigue), but that&#39;s explained by the <br/>
fibromyalgia.<br/>

check whether I did or didn&#39;t take it.  (Don&#39;t want to take it twice.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I freaked out cuz it did sound a bit scary - all the negatives, but <br/>
then also because it described to a &quot;T&quot; ...me.  It was truly amazing <br/>
really. :)  Just never saw an alternative explanation/description <br/>
before.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Possibly, yes.  Would have been nice I think.  Saved years of <br/>
sadness, exhaustion, and unexplained symptoms for which no problem <br/>
could ever be found.  Who knows.  I&#39;m still tired as all get out... <br/>
At this moment, I&#39;d kill for a nap, but it&#39;s not happening.  :) And <br/>
every month or so I have a day that I am so profoundly exhausted <br/>
that hubby or one of the girls has to pick up my slack as I cannot <br/>
even function - practically pass out where I stand.  It sux.  :)<br/>
<br/>
 Interestingly, there&#39;s no history of thyroid problems in my family -<br/>
 diabetes, yes, which I had developed secondary to the thyroid - but <br/>
no thyroid as such... I find the whole thing odd.<br/>

I had one of the those... I forgot where I put it.  lol... perhaps I <br/>
should get another?  <br/>
