<div id="ygrps-yiv-265155163">&quot;So I am wondering how does one say &quot;no&quot; to buying food<br/>
 so <br/>
that one does not rack up a huge bill of sugary foods while not making it <br/>
like the sugary foods are &quot;off limits?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I say &quot;No, I don&#39;t have enough money for that right now&quot;:)<br/>
Seriously, we talk about how much we can spend, and what kind of meals they want. They choose whether they want to come with me or not and when I say I don&#39;t have the money, they understand.<br/>
Often, they will remind each other &quot;Sierra, Mom told you we don&#39;t have much money this time!&quot;  Funny.<br/>
Having spent way too much time on a tight budget since we opened our business has led to some creative problem solving. If the kids want cookies, we&#39;ll bake some instead of buying processed. I try to make sure they get foods they want, even on a tight budget. But we never neglect the meal ingredients or important items in favor of sugary snacks.<br/>
The grocery store has SO many wonderful learning opportunities, including budgeting. It pains me to hear an unschooler say they don&#39;t take their kids!! I take my kids into everywhere I can in the world and let them absorb what is there. Grocery stores are full of interesting items, imports and opportunities to ask questions! Important stuff for unschooling. When you can let the grocery shopping be a sparkly, interesting experience for everyone, THEN you&#39;ve got it figured out I think.:)<br/>

On the food topic, our weekly resource day is in an hour. Sierra just came out and asked me if she could make me a sandwich to take. Then she asked if Jalen would like Peanut butter and honey...cool! My 6y.o. is the sandwich maker for all of us today. How sweet.<br/>

I think you have to know your limits, though, too.  I can introduce them to<br/>
all that stuff other ways, and still give them their play time and my calm<br/>
shopping.<br/>
<br/>
But then I&#39;m still at the stage where I&#39;m adjusting to the &quot;we don&#39;t HAVE to<br/>
run all these errands today&quot; part.<br/>
