<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s a concrete example of that. My 9 yr old ds, animal guy, has a big<br/>
book about animals. On  each page is a little map of the world showing the<br/>
range of where that animal lives. One day Quinn went through the whole book<br/>
just looking at the maps and talking about where each animal existed.<br/>
<br/>
If I had to, I would say that that conversation covered a year&#39;s worth of<br/>
school geography.<br/>

zoo but it is more than that, you have to hire staff, create habitats, make <br/>
money to pay for everything, excavate land to build on etc etc.  They love <br/>
it.<br/>

almost-two year old brother sitting next to him, watching in complete<br/>
fascination).  When my husband gets home, they play it together.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh and if it hasn&#39;t already been said {and you have cable or Sat.} <br/>
check out Animal Planet for lots of educational stuff. My oldest <br/>
wants to be a vet as well and she has learned {by interest} all sorts <br/>
of stuff there. <br/>
She loves That&#39;s My Baby {shows all kids of animals being born}. <br/>
There is one of my favorites Jeff Corwin who takes you all over the <br/>
world And Emergency Vets that show a real life view into it all. <br/>
Of course there&#39;s Steve Irwin the Crocodile Hunter{I think that&#39;s <br/>
Discovery channel} but that&#39;s not only about crocks. LOL<br/>
National Geographic is also good for some animal information. <br/>
A lot of what we watch on TV doesn&#39;t talk &quot;down&quot; to kids but it still <br/>
makes it interresting for all ages.<br/>
Hope this helps. :)<br/>
