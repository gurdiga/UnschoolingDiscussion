&lt;&lt;Yes. I honestly don&#39;t think it&#39;s something he can be conscious of unless<br/>
there were some huge reason that would make it more important than what is<br/>
important to his 9 yo self. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
     That&#39;s true.  He was much more excited about getting downstairs with <br/>
those walkie talkies.  And, the kitty didn&#39;t get out, so, no harm done.<br/>

and remind him.  Costs a few bucks, he says.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have two boys 6 and 9.  I know that when they get out of the car they are <br/>
always so excited about whatever it is we are doing that they never look for <br/>
traffic.  So I always remind them.  I always say &quot;watch the traffic&quot; just before <br/>
they get out.  I would do the same with the door and I do.  The basement door <br/>
goes out by the pool and they are usually so excited about going swimming <br/>
that they never shut the door, sometimes Jackson is last so he will close it but <br/>
usually it is one of the boys.  I always say &quot;shut the door please.&quot; just as <br/>
they are heading down the stairs.  There are things they remember to do and <br/>
things that they never remember.  I try to always remind them.  And I don&#39;t make <br/>
a big deal about it if they do leave the door open.  When we had cats, if they <br/>
got out we would all go out and track them down.  Doesn&#39;t matter whose fault <br/>
it was.  <br/>
<br/>
How would you react if it were your dh or a friend who had left the door <br/>
open?  You probably would have thought that they were thinking about other things. <br/>
 You would probably shut the door, maybe a little reminder, probably not.  <br/>
And wouldn&#39;t have thought any more about it.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if I made sense but I don&#39;t worry about them remembering things.  <br/>
They will eventually.  Then again Jackson, dh, forgets things too and so do I.  <br/>
Just try to remember he didn&#39;t do it on purpose.  He wasn&#39;t trying to let the <br/>
cats out.  Just had his mind on more important things.<br/>

him, I was disappointed, but I understand,  he was just busy thinking of other <br/>
things.  <br/>
<br/>
I was spaced out on the puter, it was my fault, I usually walk them out, or <br/>
say bye to him, or remind him to stay close to home, or some other thing, and I <br/>
didn&#39;t.  <br/>

obviously he thinks ahead just fine! lol It&#39;s just that it doesn&#39;t occur to him in <br/>

Live and Learn  (wow where did that come from LOL ).  If the cats got out it <br/>
really doesn&#39;t matter who did it they would have to be chased down ( I hate trying <br/>
to get a cat back LOL). And the family would have tried to come up with a <br/>
better plan.  A sign on the door &quot;shut me&quot;.  Or the spring like you said.<br/>

 It&#39;s just that I guess I tend to notice the one time I don&#39;t say something, <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yah, he is really big for his age.  I&#39;ve just spent the weekend hearing about <br/>
it from numerous people, how mature he is, how he sounds and looks older than <br/>
he is.  Maybe that&#39;s had an influence on my expectations for him.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Right now the running commentary in his head isn&#39;t<br/>
about taking care of things around the house and meeting other peoples<br/>
needs and being responsible. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
        I am very careful not to put other&#39;s needs onto him, nor do I ask him <br/>
to do much around the house, and never anything he doesn&#39;t want to do, he&#39;s <br/>
usually most agreeable.  But I&#39;m concerned, I guess, just about his own growing <br/>
sense of responsiblity and power.  <br/>
<br/>
         I don&#39;t need to be giving him that much responsibility in the first <br/>
place, tho, and walking him out, or at least just checking when I know he&#39;s <br/>
gone out, is not that big of a deal, and lets him be freer, and makes me feel <br/>
better. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think it&#39;s pretty cool that kids can be kids and not have bigger<br/>
worries that household or family stuff might suffer if he&#39;s not on top of<br/>
things. I think it&#39;s a credit to his parents that he&#39;s still idealistic<br/>
at nine and taking for granted his parents are managing things he doesn&#39;t<br/>
need to worry about. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
*sigh*  That makes me feel better, I suppose I have to *finish* getting rid <br/>
of that broken record that my parents played all the time, &quot;you must be <br/>
responsible, blah blah blah.&quot;  And I remember thinking, aren&#39;t they the parents, <br/>
aren&#39;t they the ones supposed to be responsible?    <br/>
<br/>
Um, yeah.  <br/>
