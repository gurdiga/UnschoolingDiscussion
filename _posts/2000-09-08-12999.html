<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283608212">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m part of a group of mostly homeschoolers with a curriculum, mostly a<br/>
Christian curriculum.  I do unschooling or I often say child led<br/>
learning or interest based and we are a mixed religious home.   One of<br/>
my homeschooling friends has used Oakmeadow and is a bit more flexible,<br/>
we&#39;ll be getting together to do things.  We do have a co-op.  The<br/>
classes are segragrated somewhat by age.  They are K-3rd and 4th grade<br/>
on up.  The break down is somewhat flexible.  Also my son who is 6<br/>
wanted to do the older class and I just came with him.   I taught the<br/>
are classes and it was a group of 10 K-3 boys which had included one 3rd<br/>
grade girl and we put her in the next group.  We will be planning our<br/>
next set of classes in two weeks.<br/>
