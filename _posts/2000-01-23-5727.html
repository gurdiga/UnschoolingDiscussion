Dear Homeschooling Friends,<br/>
<br/>
Guess what I did in some of my spare time this Christmas break!...  I created a Web site for home schoolers!  I named it apricot--don&#39;t ask me why.  I have been racking my brain (and anyone else&#39;s brain who got too close to me) this past week, trying to think of fun things home schoolers could do together on the Internet.  Finally, I breathed life into some of these ideas and put them on apricot.  And now, it&#39;s ready for you to see!<br/>
Go see apricot at:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.apricot.itgo.com">http://www.apricot.itgo.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I brought this Web site into the world for all home schoolers to enjoy.  Now, I&#39;m counting on seeing your thoughts, your ideas, your stories, your votes, and your conversations on apricot.  Spread the word to other home schoolers!  I&#39;ll meet you there.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s have fun (at apricot, that is),<br/>
<br/>
