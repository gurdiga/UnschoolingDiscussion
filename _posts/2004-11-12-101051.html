<div id="ygrps-yiv-989001404"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;{it} is not a path to a door but a road leading forever to the <br/>
&gt;horizon&quot; and I think life and unschooling fit that - it&#39;s not <br/>
&gt;someplace you get to and there you are but a journey ever onward <br/>
&gt;with twists and turns and changes, dropping baggage that slows up <br/>
&gt;down or causes problems and picking up things that are useful and <br/>
&gt;helpful on our journey, our paths crossing and intertwining with <br/>
&gt;others, some of whom are going our way and others who are trying to <br/>
&gt;send us off on detours or block our way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i *so* needed to hear this today. :)  thanks for your beautiful<br/>
illustration of the journey we&#39;re on!<br/>
