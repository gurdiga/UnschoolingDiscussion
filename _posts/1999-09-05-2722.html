<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123342960">Star,  Hi!    I am unschooling in England also, in Yorkshire, to be more<br/>
precise.  I was on the UK Home-ed List, but left due to some strange<br/>
behaviour from another list member.  Anyway, welcome, I don&#39;t say much here,<br/>
but you&#39;re welcome to mail me direct...<br/>
<br/>
Regards<br/>
Tracy<br/>
