<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081208488">&quot;(Jason was so happy that he found a way to give Avery what he wanted, <br/>
with out<br/>
moving a real Great White into the house. lol)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know this isn&#39;t a Great White, but I&#39;ve seen smallish creatures in <br/>
fish tanks at pet stores, labeled &quot;sharks&quot;. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re <br/>
true sharks, but they sure looked like tiny sharks.<br/>
Just an idea.:)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;ll be perfectly happy with the remote, it sounds really fun.<br/>
