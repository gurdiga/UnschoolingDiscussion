<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276390888">i&#39;ve always pondered that to mary, my dd was born at 430 am and has never been<br/>
one to sleep late. my ds was born at 730pm and he doesnt really sleep real late<br/>
but does go to bed fairly early on his own.<br/>

&gt; I have always wondered if a persons internal clock had anything to do with<br/>
&gt; what time they were born. MY children were all born at very different times<br/>
&gt; of day and they are all equally different about when they want to sleep (the<br/>
&gt; earliest born being the earliest sleeper in our case). Does anyone have any<br/>
&gt; thoughts or information on this?<br/>
