<div id="ygrps-yiv-928955545">Hi Patti,<br/>
  I our homeschool group, I have heard a few people talk about the same <br/>
thing.<br/>
It seem that the problem is when they are at home. Try staying active out of <br/>
the house.  Sign up for homeschool activities or if you do not have a group <br/>
to join for support create your own activites and put it on a calendar chart <br/>
that your sons can see and look forward to, ask them for suggestions of <br/>
things to do. I have had great luck in m;y community with job shadowing.  I <br/>
find people with interesting jobs that my son is interested in and call them <br/>
and they are very nice about letting him spend the day or part of the day <br/>
watching them do their job. They have fun and so does my son. Some of the <br/>
things he has done is spend a day watching our vet treat animals and even do <br/>
surgery, also going to a horse barn and watching the vet treat the horses. He <br/>
has seen everything from shots to insemination.  He is 10 now and is even <br/>
able to help. He has spent the day with our prosecuting attorney and a day in <br/>
our state capital with our senator.  He has walked streams with and <br/>
enviormental scientist------just to name a few.  He is ten but has been doing <br/>
this since age 8.  I have had such great cooperation and I really think that <br/>
the professionals enjoy him as well.  <br/>
    There are a lot of my friends that  say thier kids fight at home.  You <br/>
won&#39;t have to do it forever just until you break the pattern.<br/>
      I do this because I have an only child and I want to keep him excited <br/>
and not bored or he does not want to do any school work.  Also, he has made <br/>
friends in the community of all ages.  He has really become quite well know <br/>
and it has given a real boust to the homeschooling community. People are <br/>
always impressed and think he is so lucky to be learning this way<br/>
           I did not mean to go on and on ,  but this is such a great part of <br/>
our homeschooling<br/>
                            Don&#39;t send them to school, you may be sorry<br/>
hang in there and just work it out with your kids<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129179320">Hi Patti,<br/>
<br/>
This might sound like a &quot;duh&quot; suggestion, but have you<br/>
tried asking them why they&#39;re fighting so much?  If<br/>
they want other friends besides each other, could you<br/>
let them pick a couple clubs/sports/whatever to join<br/>
separately?  Do they WANT to go to school or is that<br/>
just the last resort solution you have come to?  How<br/>
much of the time are they fighting vs getting along? <br/>
Those questions are mainly rhetorical, BTW.  I&#39;m not<br/>
trying to grill you, just offering some points to<br/>
ponder.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty lucky in that my kids don&#39;t fight all that<br/>
much (yet).  They have their little brawls, sure, but<br/>
if I remember correctly, my brother and I fought a lot<br/>
more.  We also got along splendidly when we weren&#39;t<br/>
fighting, however.  How do your boys get along when<br/>
they&#39;re not going at it?  If you stay home all the<br/>
time, maybe they are just getting on each other&#39;s<br/>
nerves.  Even a little daily trip to the park or<br/>
something might help.  My son and I are both<br/>
homebodies, but my daughter needs to get out more or<br/>
she gets grouchy.  Both kids take dance, and we have a<br/>
park nearby that we visit often, and a little library<br/>
we go to once every week or two.  This stuff is all in<br/>
a little town of 1500 people so it&#39;s not like we are<br/>
traveling the world, but it does keep them from<br/>
getting restless.<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of home/unschoolers have burn-out<br/>
periods.  We had one for pretty much the entire month<br/>
of April and most of May.  I stopped doing anything<br/>
that was remotely school like and they eventually<br/>
settled back down.  Now they are back on track and<br/>
asking for &quot;stuff&quot; again.  Normally my son loves to do<br/>
worksheets and things like that (he asks for them),<br/>
but he was so not interested for that burnout period. <br/>
I am veering off topic here but what I&#39;m saying is<br/>
that maybe the overall balance in your<br/>
house/life/whatever is upset and your sons are<br/>
fighting BECAUSE of that, instead of vice versa.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean anyone is doing anything wrong.  It just<br/>
happens.<br/>
<br/>
My advice is sounding less than sage so I&#39;ll stop now.<br/>
 Good luck with your boys.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207625365">Hey, Patti!<br/>
<br/>
You have my sympathy!  And, my empathy.  You sound like you&#39;re writing from <br/>
a spot that&#39;s between a rock and a hard place, which is a terrible place to <br/>
make a long-term decision from (but a great place to make a short-term <br/>
decision!).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m absolutely no expert at all here!  But, I do have some thoughts on this <br/>
which you are free to completely ignore:<br/>
<br/>
There are two things that occurred to me when I was reading your SOS, the <br/>
answers you got, and the answers you gave.  Here they are, mushed together <br/>
in one thought.  Lisa had wondered if you had asked them why they are <br/>
fighting.  You said that their answers are usually pretty basic (&quot;he just <br/>
bugs me&quot;).   The first thing that struck me was that I wondered if they had <br/>
the vocabulary to express what&#39;s going on for them.  There could be a lot <br/>
of reasons for their fighting that they just don&#39;t know how to express to <br/>
you - or to themselves!  But the very first thing I thought when I read <br/>
your first message was, &quot;Those guys are getting something out of this <br/>
situation.&quot;  In other words, they may not be hating all this fighting as <br/>
much as you do; there may be some kind of unintended reward they get, like <br/>
seeing you in a certain state, or just dragging you into it.  Or, there may <br/>
be some other reward I can&#39;t conceive of.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if there is any way you can avoid breaking up their fights all the <br/>
time.  I wonder if you might sit down with them either together or <br/>
separately at a time when things are really peaceful and good and tell them <br/>
your feelings on the subject:  &quot;I love you but I hate all the fighting you <br/>
do.&quot;  Then, you could ask them to brainstorm with you to find solutions to <br/>
prevent the fighting.  They may come up with nothing at all, but they may <br/>
come up with something that totally surprises you.  Even if they come up <br/>
with nothing at all, you might have planted a seed that would make them <br/>
more conscious of the whole thing and they may look for solutions at other <br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
I could be way off the mark here, but I&#39;m getting the impression that this <br/>
fighting has become a habit for them, and they may be able to replace it <br/>
with something better, if they and you can come up with what that <br/>
is.  Maybe the solution will just be something like &quot;when I&#39;m feeling angry <br/>
towards my brother and I want to hit him, I&#39;m going to go __________ (some <br/>
other place).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I also think about the TV analogy:  They may just not have something that&#39;s <br/>
more interesting to them than fighting with each other.  All that putting <br/>
them in PS would do would be to remove the amount of time they spend <br/>
together, so I wonder if there is a way they can achieve that end by a <br/>
different means (which I know you have been trying, but maybe they can <br/>
brainstorm on that, too).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they could come up with a code word that means, &quot;This is <br/>
serious:  leave me alone right now; I&#39;m about to pop.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These are all goofy suggestions, I know, but they may help them come up <br/>
with some better ideas that they would be able to do and feel good <br/>
about.  I think one of the best things you can do, though, is try to remove <br/>
yourself from their dramas.  When you&#39;re in it, it may become an <br/>
unconscious  competition for them in a way to prove their case or get you <br/>
angry or get your sympathy.<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer:  I am not any kind of expert at all!  I only have one kid, but <br/>
I did grow up with an older sister and an older brother.  But, I have done <br/>
a lot of reading and talking and these are things that have occurred to me <br/>
based on that and observation.<br/>
<br/>
Love and light,<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  You probably have already, but have you read the books written by <br/>
Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish?  They wrote How To Talk So Kids Will Listen <br/>
& Listen So Kids Will Talk, which I would recommend for folks who don&#39;t <br/>
have kids to read, and Siblings Without Rivalry, which I haven&#39;t read, but <br/>
I&#39;ll bet there&#39;s some good stuff in there, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951278433">Marji - I don&#39;t think they are goofy suggestions or observations<br/>
at al!  In reading the e-mails I noticed the mentions of a<br/>
toddler - and that a fight had broken out while Mom was trying to<br/>
get in some time with the toddler.  It could well be simple<br/>
attention seeking - pick a fight and get Mom&#39;s time.  Kids (like<br/>
adults) aren&#39;t too picky about whether the attention they get is<br/>
positive or negative when they really want attention.  Depending<br/>
on what talking to the kids at a calm time yields, a couple of<br/>
thoughts were spurred by your suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
First Patti might want to alter her response.  Rather than<br/>
getting in there and sorting it out for them with lots of<br/>
emotional and actual time, she might devise a strategy in advance<br/>
to separate them and withdraw.  Think of 2 separate, non-punitive<br/>
places.  When there is a fight, do not address the fight, simply<br/>
send each boy to the designated (in her head) place and tell them<br/>
not to come out for 15 minutes or until called.  Low Mom<br/>
contact/involvement - takes away the incentive to fight, if time<br/>
and involvement are the incentive.<br/>
<br/>
Second Patti might set up a token economy based on &quot;Mom time.&quot;<br/>
Our 5 yo craves &quot;Mom time&quot; and &quot;Papa time&quot; more than the other<br/>
kids and calls it by name - Mama time or Papa time, which is what<br/>
makes me use those terms.  That time for her is separate from the<br/>
routine of &quot;lots of time together&quot; that is part of our life - it<br/>
is time to pick out a special book for reading aloud, over and<br/>
above the bed time stories ritual - or to go to see something<br/>
that isn&#39;t part of the routine - or to move an activity ahead of<br/>
where it would fall in a logical critical path plan.  Perhaps<br/>
Patti can determine how much of that &quot;at your service, dear&quot; time<br/>
is feasible for her and dock it with the time she spends breaking<br/>
up fights.<br/>
<br/>
On a different front, it is June.  Even if the kids want to go to<br/>
school, they aren&#39;t headed anywhere for at least a couple of<br/>
months.  There is no reason at all to engage them or Patti in the<br/>
school/unschool issue right now.  They may be pushing her buttons<br/>
with that issue, just for fun.  Patti places a value on<br/>
unschooling - the boys can take that away from her at will by<br/>
rejecting unschooling.  What a fun way to pass the time!  Just<br/>
don&#39;t engage on the topic for a while.  As in - &quot;Mom, we want to<br/>
go to school!&quot; &quot;Fine dear, when school is in, we will talk about<br/>
it; right now I have to deal with what you and your brother are<br/>
doing right now; John 1 go to &quot;x&quot;; John 2 go to&quot;y&quot;&quot;  Calm, quiet,<br/>
buttons hidden.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few more thoughts that might work - or might spur some<br/>
better ones from some other folks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you read &quot;Siblings Without Rivalry&quot; by Adele Faber and Elaine <br/>
Mazlish?<br/>
It could help you very much.<br/>
I have an 11yo dd and 8yo ds who like to pick and argue and be pretty <br/>
darn mean to each other and sometimes hit each other.<br/>
They seem to enjoy it and I realize that I am a huge part of the <br/>
dynamics when it starts to get really bad. We sit down and make big <br/>
changes and it usually gives them a very unsettled feeling because my <br/>
part of the change is to put their behavior back in their hands.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know why , but it seems to be a cycle of them getting along <br/>
fine-then starting to fight more often and me trying to intervene-<br/>
them fighting more-me starting to yell- then an wake up call <br/>
incedent, and a big family discussion and changes.  It just happened <br/>
here a few of days ago!  <br/>
I told them not to involve me anymore.  If they chose to be rude and <br/>
hurtful, not to bring it to me when it got out of control. They can <br/>
come to me for help before it gets out of control, but if they have <br/>
chosen to let it get to a point that they are hitting and name <br/>
calling  and eventually crying, I don&#39;t want to hear about it.  <br/>
Basically I was hearing the aftermath or trying to stop something <br/>
from forming.  It never worked and I was being sucked in.  We talked <br/>
a lot about alternatives they could choose and ways I could be <br/>
helpful IF ASKED.  They tested me once or twice after the <br/>
conversation, but we haven&#39;t had an incedent in a couple of days <br/>
now.  <br/>
This works for my 2 oldest kids.  I am more protective of my younger <br/>
ones and wouldn&#39;t leave them to fend for themselves against their <br/>
older siblings. (though there usually isn&#39;t much incedent there <br/>
anyway) My older 2 understand the consequences of their actions.  <br/>
When I put it all back on them and they realize that they don&#39;t have <br/>
me to come running to, they are more wary of starting trouble.  My <br/>
oldest one also seems to get angry at me for &quot;dropping out of the <br/>
game&quot;.  But I hold strong and it always gets better.  I just have to <br/>
try to keep vigilant on not getting sucked back in down the road.<br/>
I hope things get better.  I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve read the book <br/>
above.  If you have, maybe skim it again, if not, go get it!<br/>
Maybe others have more book suggestions??  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-228459541">dear Patti,<br/>
   It sounds like you are completely burned out and discourged.  Sometimes <br/>
our attitutes and feelings set a subtle pace in our home. Usually when things <br/>
at my house are out of order I can look at myself and see that I created it. <br/>
This is a difficult thing for me to admit and it was a good friend that <br/>
pointed out the possibiliy because of her own experiences.  What we have been <br/>
doing is having some stuff special just for moms.  A homeschool Moms retreat <br/>
and a monthly book club with a dinner. We do this at someones house and each <br/>
bring a dish., If kids need to come we hired a sitter to be at the house and <br/>
entertain them. this way we can still come if we have our kids and we know <br/>
they are safe and we still get to have our time.  We each pitch in a couple <br/>
of dollars .The kids have fun too.  <br/>
    I know what you mean about fitting in, it took me quite a while to find a <br/>
group. I think I was a lot like you in what I did not want.<br/>
         Try to to hang in there. I think the lesser of two evils is to work <br/>
it out.<br/>
What about just ignoring all the fighting and don&#39;t intervine at all. Just <br/>
refuse to hear about the dispute and let them fight it out. At the same time, <br/>
not during the fighting, ofer some suggestions on conflict resolution. There <br/>
are some great books if you need ideas. Any library should have them. <br/>
    I personally think keeping them apart is the wrong message, letting them <br/>
be together and fight it out is better, they will eventually figure it out.<br/>
        Anyway, I can feel your frustration so I am just throughing out a few <br/>
ideas. I know I do not have any idea of what you are dealing with bu;t <br/>
sometimes an outside perspective is helpful.<br/>
            Best of Luck, you sound like a great Mom<br/>

My parents raised two cousins of ours.  One was horribly mean and felt she <br/>
had nothing to lose.  She hit the rest of us and the others defended <br/>
themselves, but I would just roll up and let her hit me because I felt too <br/>
awful to hit her back and it would have just infuriated her.  I can&#39;t imagine <br/>
someone leaving a situation like that going.  Kids at home should be safer <br/>
than that.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t even let strangers wail on each other without intervening, let <br/>
alone my own kids.  As a kid who was hit by another kid, I have to register <br/>
the possibility that one of your children is already in a dangerous situation <br/>
and saying &quot;Don&#39;t tell me your problems&quot; isn&#39;t a momly thing to do if that <br/>
could be the case.<br/>
<br/>
An older child won&#39;t want to admit fear of a younger one.  A boy won&#39;t want <br/>
to admit fear of a girl.<br/>
<br/>
I could be offbase, but I could be more on than you think.  It&#39;s possible.<br/>

Those children didn&#39;t choose to live together, they are stuck with one <br/>

punishment enough!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I was a single working mother of two sons (born two years apart) <br/>
who were still in school, I instituted a now patently absurd rule that I <br/>
would not intervene in their fights, and that if they did choose to <br/>
fight, that I didn&#39;t want to know about it. I expected this to foster in <br/>
them a sense of cooperation and negotiating and getting along.<br/>
<br/>
What began instead was the quiet and frequent victimization of my <br/>
trusting and loving younger son by my more experienced and powerful <br/>
older son (not sexual and not usually violent, lest anyone should <br/>
wonder).  I discovered this when the youngest was 14 and no longer in <br/>
school and enough healing time had passed for him to be able to tell me <br/>
about all the times in which the way things &quot;worked out&quot; was that he <br/>
&quot;gave in&quot; under threat of physical harm or tattling.  <br/>
<br/>
Since then, I have encouraged them to bring their problems to me, and I <br/>
practice hearing what each of them has to say, and relating it back to <br/>
the other, concentrating on making sure we&#39;re talking about perceptions <br/>
and not necessarily facts, and making sure that it all comes down to <br/>
each of them taking responsibility for their own actions, regardless. <br/>
 It&#39;s hard work to help them see that we can only control our own <br/>
actions, and we always have choice.  And it doesn&#39;t stick the first <br/>
time.  In an emotionally charged relationship, it&#39;s tempting to say &quot;I <br/>
did this because always does that!&quot;  But it can&#39;t be true.  We&#39;ve even <br/>
been working on it this week, with them at almost 20 and 18!<br/>
<br/>
How will they learn to negotiate if they have no model?  Who is most <br/>
likely to lose when children are left to their own to work out <br/>
conflicts?  Even James Dobson says you should always protect the younger <br/>
or weaker kid.  I failed at that for many years.  That my younger son <br/>
grandly forgives me is no condolence.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084488850">Hi everyone.  I&#39;m at a point right now where I might be signing my kids<br/>
up for school in the fall despite years of dedicated unschooling, and<br/>
I&#39;m feeling extremely torn and anxious about it and afraid that if they<br/>
do go I will regret it.  Perhaps you all can talk me out of it, or give<br/>
me some alternate advice...<br/>
My sons (ages 7 and 9) fight, bicker and torment each other pretty much<br/>
constantly-  to the point where it&#39;s driving my husband and I insane.<br/>
I&#39;m not exaggerating when I say that peace is practically nonexistant.<br/>
I used to think it was something I was doing wrong as their mother, or<br/>
that it was somehow my fault, but I&#39;m no longer sure... I think it&#39;s a<br/>
combination of the personalities they were born with and the fact that<br/>
they spend practically all of their waking hours together and are tired<br/>
of each other.  An hour or two out of the house alone with me or their<br/>
Dad doesn&#39;t seem to help... they seem to make up for lost time when<br/>
they&#39;re back together.<br/>
Both of them want more friends that are their *own* friends, not shared<br/>
with each other, and I just don&#39;t know where to find them, and honestly<br/>
I&#39;m tired of trying.<br/>
There are only a handful of homeschoolers within a reasonable distance<br/>
of us, and they haven&#39;t clicked with any of them, nor do they have<br/>
anything in common.  They basically spend their days watching cartoons,<br/>
fighting with each other and complaining &quot;when&#39;s it gonna be three<br/>
o&#39;clock??&quot;<br/>
(when their schooled friends arrive back home in the neighborhood).<br/>
I&#39;m feeling extremely discouraged that I&#39;m not living up to what I think<br/>
an ideal unschooling family looks like.  It would hurt me to see them in<br/>
school since I believe in unschooling so much, but I just don&#39;t know<br/>
what to do at this point.<br/>
Family and friends tell my husband and I that they need to go to school,<br/>
make different friends, not be stuck alone with each other all the<br/>
time.  I&#39;m starting to wonder if they&#39;re right. :-/<br/>
I have more to say, but I have to go break up a fight.  Seriously.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220297900"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Sign up for homeschool activities or if you do not have a group<br/>
&gt; to join for support create your own activites and put it on a calendar<br/>
&gt; chart<br/>
&gt; that your sons can see and look forward to, ask them for suggestions<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; things to do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s true that getting out helps, but unfortunately my kids don&#39;t care<br/>
to take a drive (usually considerable distance) to meet up with other<br/>
homeschoolers, whom we&#39;ve learned from experience that we generally<br/>
don&#39;t fit in with- the few that I can find are generally school-at-home,<br/>
no sugar/tv, waldorf types.  Or else there&#39;s the Christian group or two<br/>
which are even worse (not that they&#39;re Christians, but the attitude<br/>
toward children that tends to go with it).<br/>
The types of outings they like (skateboard parks, arcade type places)<br/>
not only add up financially but are difficult with a busy toddler in<br/>
tow.  So yes, it helps to get out when possible but that gets exhausting<br/>
as well, for other reasons.  I&#39;m a homebody, and I like my home to feel<br/>
like a haven.  I don&#39;t want to feel like I need to stay out of it as<br/>
much as possible in order to survive.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have had great luck in m;y community with job shadowing.  I<br/>
&gt; find people with interesting jobs that my son is interested in and<br/>
&gt; call them<br/>
&gt; and they are very nice about letting him spend the day or part of the<br/>
&gt; day<br/>
&gt; watching them do their job.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What a great idea... I&#39;ve never thought of this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do this because I have an only child and I want to keep him excited<br/>
&gt; and not bored or he does not want to do any school work.  Also, he has<br/>
&gt; made<br/>
&gt; friends in the community of all ages.  He has really become quite well<br/>
&gt; know<br/>
&gt; and it has given a real boust to the homeschooling community.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I spend one on one time with either of the older boys it&#39;s<br/>
absolutely amazing how different they are.  It&#39;s like getting a glimpse<br/>
of who they really are, and I remember how much I can enjoy their<br/>
company.<br/>
And then the moment they&#39;re back together it&#39;s right back to<br/>
silliness/chasing/yelling/teasing, &quot;MOM he hit me!!!&quot; &quot;MOM, he took my<br/>
seat!!&quot;  &quot;MOM tell him to stop!!!&quot; &quot;MOOOMMMMM!!!!&quot;   I tried to take a<br/>
few minutes earlier to rock my cranky toddler on the porch swing with a<br/>
book while they seemed to be engrossed enough in something to get along<br/>
for a few minutes.   We were soon interrupted by screams and crying and<br/>
I had to run inside to break up a fistfight.  I&#39;m absolutely horrified<br/>
that they do this, and so sad that my toddler has to see it.<br/>
I just don&#39;t know what to do anymore.  It&#39;s to the point where I simply<br/>
cannot deal with them being together.  I&#39;ve even tried creating separate<br/>
spaces for them in the house and encouraging them to just seek solitude<br/>
and do their own thing when they&#39;re on each other&#39;s nerves, but it<br/>
actually seems like they&#39;d *rather* fight than be apart.  One will<br/>
eventually seek out the other and just start making faces or purposely<br/>
doing something annoying.  I just don&#39;t get it.<br/>
Has anyone else gone through this with close in age boys?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; People are<br/>
&gt; always impressed and think he is so lucky to be learning this way<br/>
&gt;            I did not mean to go on and on ,  but this is such a great<br/>
&gt; part of<br/>
&gt; our homeschooling<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, to those close to us (close family and friends) who know<br/>
my kids well and how they are with each other, the impression of<br/>
home/unschooling isn&#39;t good.  It looks like homeschooling sucks, as I&#39;m<br/>
usually completely frazzled and burned out and desperately looking for a<br/>
break.  My MIL has actually told me that I should stop being a martyr<br/>
already and just put them in school.<br/>
I just want to tell them &quot;but you don&#39;t understand!  Unschooling isn&#39;t<br/>
*supposed* to be this way!  In all the books and magazine articles and<br/>
online forums it sounds wonderful!&quot;<br/>
My day to day reality just doesn&#39;t match the rosy picture, and it&#39;s so<br/>
frustrating to me.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  This might sound like a &quot;duh&quot; suggestion, but have you<br/>
&gt; tried asking them why they&#39;re fighting so much?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  The answer is usually something like &quot;he just bugs me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  If<br/>
&gt; they want other friends besides each other, could you<br/>
&gt; let them pick a couple clubs/sports/whatever to join<br/>
&gt; separately?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 9yo has tried various classes (he&#39;s taking a break from karate right<br/>
now) but they haven&#39;t really led to any real friendships.  It&#39;s occured<br/>
to me that this is because classes of this sort are only once or twice a<br/>
week, and the other kids in the class have friends from school who they<br/>
see every day. The other kids aren&#39;t necessarily looking to meet new<br/>
friends in the way my son is.   There are mabye 100 students in all at<br/>
my son&#39;s karate dojo, and he&#39;s the only one that doesn&#39;t go to school.<br/>
It also seems like most of the students there are there because their<br/>
parents think it&#39;s good for them, not because *they* want to be there,<br/>
so that sort of eliminates the idea of finding friends with similar<br/>
interests.<br/>
His younger brother has thus far had no interest in any classes or clubs<br/>
at all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Do they WANT to go to school or is that<br/>
&gt; just the last resort solution you have come to?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a last resort solution pretty much, but they do often talk about<br/>
how they&#39;d like to at least try school so they have some frame of<br/>
reference since most of their friends attend, most of the books they<br/>
read and movies they watch have a schooly frame of reference, and of<br/>
course there&#39;s that meeting-new-friends aspect that&#39;s appealing to them.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand they can&#39;t imagine sitting still and quiet most of the<br/>
day and doing whatever they&#39;re told.  Mixed feelings all around you<br/>
could say.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  How<br/>
&gt; much of the time are they fighting vs getting along?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm.  At least 50/50 I&#39;d say.  It&#39;s a fine line.  Even when they&#39;re<br/>
&quot;getting along&quot; they are doing things which are borderline, like<br/>
wrestling.  Unfortunately I have a hard time relaxing when they&#39;re<br/>
getting along since it can turn at any moment and I&#39;m always tensed up<br/>
waiting for it.  It&#39;s a horrible dynamic, and I can&#39;t imagine how to<br/>
break out of it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; trying to grill you, just offering some points to<br/>
&gt; ponder<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for pondering with me.  It&#39;s exactly what I need to do!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think a lot of home/unschoolers have burn-out<br/>
&gt; periods.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think so too.  I wish it was more openly discussed, especially among<br/>
the veteran home/unschoolers so that those of us that are newer at it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t feel like such failures.<br/>
My burnout periods are usually in the dead of winter and during shitty<br/>
weather, so this springtime, warm weather burnout is new and, I think,<br/>
coming from a deeper place.<br/>

their children very well.  Neither one of mine is the victim.  It <br/>
would be a true situation if I left my older son and my younger son <br/>
alone.  My younger would be the victim in a situation like this and I <br/>
do step right in if I hear injustice or feel possible violence coming <br/>
on.  With my older two it is definitely a game of sorts that they try <br/>
to drag me into.  When times like these happen it is a wake up call.  <br/>
They do need something from me and or a change in their daily life <br/>
and that happens, but I also step out of the &quot;game&quot; and they take <br/>
control of themselves.  It works.  This past problem was picking and <br/>
teasing everytime we got in the car.   <br/>
Sometimes one is feeling jealous of the other because of attention <br/>
they are getting (my son is a very good soccer player and <br/>
grandparents have been raving.  My dd loves theater and she is <br/>
the &quot;star&quot; during productions....) We work all of these things out.  <br/>
We talk.  We live together.<br/>

My kids are extremely passionate, highly active and a force to be <br/>
reckoned with.  Nothing is simple when it comes to them, but they <br/>
sure make life interesting!<br/>

&gt; much as you do; there may be some kind of unintended reward they get,<br/>
&gt; like<br/>
&gt; seeing you in a certain state, or just dragging you into it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is a big part of it.  They *love* to have a reason to yell<br/>
&quot;MOOOOMMMM!!!!&quot;   One will needle the other until the other hits or<br/>
pushes, then the original antagonizer yells for me and acts like a<br/>
victim.   They will both actually try to outdo each other after I break<br/>
up a fight- exaggerating their &quot;injuries&quot; and trying to outcry each<br/>
other.  Like whoever I feel the most sorry for wins.  Today one of them<br/>
caused the other to fall, and the faller *insisted* that his ankle was<br/>
sprained or broken and that he couldn&#39;t walk.   Within minutes he was<br/>
running around perfectly fine, and they were laughing and playing again.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some common scenarios:<br/>
Older brother is absorbed in something quiet.  Younger brother notices<br/>
and decides to purposely do something to get in his way or make loud<br/>
irritating noises.  Older brother tells him to move it.   Younger<br/>
brother says &quot;I don&#39;t have to if I don&#39;t want to.&quot;  Older brother tells<br/>
him again to move.  Younger brother does not.  Older brother shoves<br/>
younger brother out of the way.  Younger brother falls down dramatically<br/>
and screams his head off.   I&#39;ve responded to this scenario in a variety<br/>
of ways from ignoring it (feels wrong) to walking in and sympathizing<br/>
(feels like stepping into the role they&#39;re designing for me) to acting<br/>
disgusted (&quot;oh please!  How can I feel sorry for you when you got<br/>
exactly what you were looking for?&quot;)  None of these approaches have<br/>
helped in the least.<br/>
Another common scenario is wrestling or having a pillow fight, insisting<br/>
that they want to do it and are having fun.  Invariably someone ends up<br/>
crying because someone does something too hard.<br/>
They chase each other around, sometimes laughing, sometimes crying.<br/>
They slam doors on each other, sometimes laughing and sometimes crying.<br/>
Younger brother hit older brother with a fly swatter today, out of the<br/>
blue, for no apparent reason, followed by chasing and screams of &quot;I&#39;M<br/>
GONNA GET YOU!&quot; from older brother.  More door slamming doors.<br/>
There were various other similar scenarios throughout the day.<br/>
It&#39;s just the four of us here... their Dad won&#39;t be home until late<br/>
tonight.<br/>
We tried calling the couple of good friends they have to break up the<br/>
intense togetherness, but they weren&#39;t available.  (More friend options<br/>
would help- especially if they had different ones- but where to find<br/>
them?)  And we did get out for quite a while, but they just picked on<br/>
each other while we were out (and in the car, and in the restaurant<br/>
waiting for our take out...)<br/>
I can honestly say I&#39;ve never seen anything quite like it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I wonder if there is any way you can avoid breaking up their fights<br/>
&gt; all the<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only reason I can&#39;t do this (not break up a fight) is that they&#39;re<br/>
strong and capable of really hurting each other.  Plus it upsets their<br/>
baby brother.  I feel like I simply have to break it up.<br/>
The times I&#39;ve tried just letting them go at it (like when I&#39;m *truly*<br/>
at the end of my tether) they just escalate until I feel like I have no<br/>
choice but to do something.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe they could come up with a code word that means, &quot;This is<br/>
&gt; serious:  leave me alone right now; I&#39;m about to pop.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But that seems to be their whole point.  They *want* to make each other<br/>
&quot;pop.&quot;  They seem to find it more entertaining than anything else<br/>
available.  And it&#39;s not like they have nothing else to choose from.<br/>
Our house is brimming with things to do- their schooled friends never<br/>
want to leave when they spend time here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think one of the best things you can do, though, is try to remove<br/>
&gt; yourself from their dramas.  When you&#39;re in it, it may become an<br/>
&gt; unconscious  competition for them in a way to prove their case or get<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; angry or get your sympathy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Definitely a big part of it.  But how to remove myself and also keep<br/>
them both safe?  How to create a peaceful environment for all of us, and<br/>
especially my 3yo, with this craziness going on all the time?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
