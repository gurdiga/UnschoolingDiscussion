<div id="ygrps-yiv-797330814">Chatty this morning, aren&#39;t I?  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
   We&#39;ve had a homsechool community theater group for several years and are about to begin work on our 10th production. I&#39;m looking for suggestions for great plays to do.  We have some ideas, but none of them seem quite right at this point.<br/>
<br/>
   In the past we&#39;ve done: Little Women; Filthaven&#39;s Folly (a melodrama); A Christmas Carol; The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; Cinderella, Charlotte&#39;s Web; Anne of Green Gables; Tales from the Arabian Nights and Cheaper by the Dozen.  Each one has been a truly wonderful experience.  Does reading this list bring to mind other plays you&#39;d like to see?  We&#39;d like to include a lot of kids this time, so it needs to be something that can be expanded.<br/>
<br/>
   Anyone else out there with a hs theater group?<br/>
