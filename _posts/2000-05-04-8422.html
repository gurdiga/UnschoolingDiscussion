<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035651295">Okay...I&#39;ll just say it...my kids are driving me nuts.  I guess it&#39;s them - <br/>
maybe it&#39;s me.  Everyone seems so lazy, and I&#39;m not just talking about when <br/>
it comes to so called educational stuff.  They won&#39;t pick up after themselves <br/>
and when I ask them to, they act like I&#39;ve asked them to cut off an arm or <br/>
something.  My son argues with EVERYTHING I say, and he complains about <br/>
almost everything we do, even if it&#39;s something he&#39;ll end up enjoying.  And <br/>
the kids fight constantly.  I don&#39;t think they used to fight as much as they <br/>
do now.  I&#39;m not sure, but it seems like it&#39;s gotten worse since the baby was <br/>
born 15 months ago.   It&#39;s hard for me to ignore the constant bickering, <br/>
believe me - I&#39;ve tried, and I just can&#39;t do it.  I have to say I haven&#39;t <br/>
been behaving much better myself lately.  My temper has become incredibly <br/>
short, and I find myself yelling about the smallest of things. I don&#39;t have <br/>
much time for myself, and I usually don&#39;t mind too much about that, but it&#39;s <br/>
been a real source of irritation lately.  When I try to sneak off to do my <br/>
own thing, it never fails someone finds me, and seems to take delight in <br/>
disrupting me.  I love my family dearly and I&#39;m commited to making <br/>
homeschooling work for us.  We&#39;ve only recently begun to experiment with <br/>
unschooling...maybe that&#39;s part of the problem.  So, tell me...what am I <br/>
doing wrong?  I need help!  <br/>
