It&#39;s not rare in unschooling families. :)<br/>
My 13 y.o. hugs me in public regularly, asks to be tucked in <br/>
occasionally and is not embarassed one bit by the fact that he likes <br/>
his Mum! He&#39;s a cuddly guy.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Well, its not rare in my family either.  We just started <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling in January.   I think alot of it just has to do <br/>
with showing affection, being open and comfortable with each other.  My 13 yo <br/>
daughter  snuggles and hugs and loves up to me all the time. My 11 yo son <br/>
will sit on my lap for while..Well, rather in my knee.  He&#39;s 110 pounds, so <br/>
he doesnt really &quot;fit&quot; on my lap.  I still carry my 7 yo old lots of times.. <br/>
To and from the car... .carry him to bed.  I pick him up and hold him on my <br/>
hip very often, lift him up to see stuff.  It not unusual for me to take a  <br/>
spooned up nap with any ( or a combination of ) them.  My big old 16 yo son <br/>
whose bigger than me gets hugs, and affectionate pats often too.   We are all <br/>
very touchy-feely.. My family was very openly affectionate as I was growing <br/>
up and we still are.  ( My parents, sisters and now my nieces and nephews)  I <br/>
think its wonderful <br/>
