&gt; I got cases of formula delivered to my house that I didn&#39;t request even <br/>
&gt; after <br/>
&gt; my baby died and didn&#39;t come home from the hospital at all!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I wonder where they get these lists to send it to?  The hospital denied <br/>
&gt; having access to any list or giving any lists when we were trying <br/>
&gt; desperately to <br/>
&gt; get removed from them.  They said try the doctors office, doctors office <br/>
&gt; said <br/>
&gt; it HAD to come from the hospital.<br/>

second baby at home and there were no MDs or hospitals.<br/>
