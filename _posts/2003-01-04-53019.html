Canadian black history sites put an end to that notion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-457821410">In the spring of my second year of teaching, I read<br/>
Summerhill, and was forever changed.<br/>
<br/>
It did much the same for me when I read it in grade nine.  After that, it<br/>
was really hard to play the school game anymore.  I eventually &quot;rose up&quot;<br/>
from school in grade eleven and began unschooling myself, many years before<br/>
the word unschooling was coined.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301935262"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever had many fears per se, but I too have had some<br/>
&gt; serious doubts, like when our then 16-year-old son just wasn&#39;t the<br/>
&gt; least bit interested in reading. Nothing. Nada. He seemed to get<br/>
&gt; along fine without reading, so we left him alone (which wasn&#39;t easy,<br/>
&gt; *believe* me), and suddenly one day - nobody knows how - he was<br/>
&gt; reading as well as anyone else in the family (a family of VERY<br/>
&gt; serious readers - hey, we&#39;re *publishers!*). Would he have learned<br/>
&gt; sooner if we&#39;d &quot;encouraged&quot; him? Maybe. But we knew he&#39;d get around<br/>
&gt; to it eventually, and he was getting along just fine without our help<br/>
&gt; - enjoying an extremely busy social life of snowboarding, working,<br/>
&gt; travelling and filming professional-level videos with several<br/>
&gt; friends. Reading just wasn&#39;t on his list of things to do that week.<br/>
&gt; Or month. Or year. But he figured it out somewhere along the way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Neat to hear this, Helen.  Last time this came up on the list he still<br/>
wasn&#39;t reading.<br/>
<br/>
Does he read much now that he can?  I had a hard time accepting that even<br/>
though Lars can now read, he still doesn&#39;t particularly want to.  He&#39;ll<br/>
probably never use reading as his main tool for learning, and he much<br/>
prefers his fiction to be on screen.  Funny thing.  Now he&#39;s jumping into<br/>
film-making as a big interest.  &lt;G&gt;  He wants to make mountain biking<br/>
videos.  We helped him buy a mini-dv camera for Christmas.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not really. Sometimes when he&#39;s bored he&#39;ll pick up a book and read a <br/>
few pages, but he doesn&#39;t read for hours like his brothers will, but <br/>
it&#39;s not surprising given his *very* active personality. In school <br/>
this kid would have been on behavior control meds, no doubt about it. <br/>
At home we just know he&#39;s a fidgeter, always needs to be doing <br/>
something physical - or sleeping. He&#39;ll do cartwheels across the <br/>
living room, powerslide down the hallway, chase the dogs through the <br/>
house (luckily we have a large house and they can do a full circle <br/>
through the front room, kitchen, pantry, hallway, and back into the <br/>
front room &lt;g&gt;). He has a hard time sitting still long enough to eat, <br/>
or to play a game; always has to be tapping his foot or drumming his <br/>
fingers if nothing else. We figure he&#39;ll either outgrow it or learn <br/>
to deal  with it.<br/>
<br/>
We tried to get him interested in sports when we realized how active <br/>
he liked to be, but the only one that ever caught on was <br/>
snowboarding. And swimming in the summer. He loves to walk - will <br/>
hike to and from his best friend&#39;s house three miles away, sometimes <br/>
a couple of times a day. Interesting kid, to say the least. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

who either didn&#39;t read until their teen years or who seem to avoid <br/>
reading whenever possible are seriously interested in film-making. <br/>
And the fidgeter above will sit stock-still through a two-hour movie. <br/>
Is there something about the flickering images fulfilling that &quot;need <br/>
to move&quot; that he seems to have?<br/>

<br/>
Oh, that reminds me.<br/>
<br/>
We just moved, and as a consequence we (temporarily?) changed our<br/>
Nintendo 64 set up.  Previously the system had been in a small room with<br/>
a loveseat just a few feet away.  Now it&#39;s hooked up to the big TV in<br/>
the living room with a lot of empty space.  (The new house is bigger and<br/>
there isn&#39;t money for more furniture.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen a total change in how my son is physically when playing<br/>
Nintendo.  Before he sat pretty still, sometimes talking to himself and<br/>
exclaiming with pleasure.  (He&#39;s not really wiggly by nature.  He has my<br/>
well developed capacity for sitting and vegetating.)  Now that he has<br/>
the bigger space with no close enough place to sit other than the floor,<br/>
he puts his whole body into it, leaping and wriggling all over the<br/>
place.  It looks like a pretty good workout.  Also, I can really see his excitement.<br/>
<br/>
I had to see it with my own eyes, but now I understand more why some<br/>
people say &quot;my kid is quiet like a zombie&quot; when he plays Nintendo or<br/>
watches TV and others say &quot;my kid is very active when playing Nintendo<br/>
or watching TV&quot;.  If this much variation is possible just in the<br/>
behavior of one kid, then I have a clearer understanding of how much<br/>
variation is possible in a whole universe of kids.<br/>

are playing a &quot;virtual&quot; game.. they put thier whole bodies into to. . they <br/>
made sound effects and scream and yell .. its really funny.. And to think, <br/>
most folks view video games as &quot;sedentary&quot;.. LOL.. not in this house :-)<br/>

still watching TV for literally hours but doesn&#39;t like to sit still reading.<br/>
My daughter met a woman whose son had spent most of his growing up time<br/>
watching TV and videos.  He&#39;s now a film-maker.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
