              Strong Words or Taboo Words<br/>
	As one of those feminists who don&#39;t mind words like cunt or <br/>
pussy as long as they aren&#39;t used as a derogatory name for a female, <br/>
I was intrigued by the book Cunt: A Declaration of Independence.  The <br/>
author, Inga Muscio, became interested in the word after completing a <br/>
writing assignment at work and mislabeling &quot;Word Count&quot; as &quot;Word <br/>
Cunt&quot;.  After her supervisor pointed out her obscene misspelling, she <br/>
liked the way it looked and started calling herself the &quot;Word Cunt&quot;.  <br/>
Extreme reactions to this led her to do research on the offending <br/>
word, which produced material that inspired her enough to write a <br/>
book.<br/>
        Muscio says that she would rather say cunt than vagina <br/>
because the latter means &quot;sheath for a sword&quot;.  She thought that her <br/>
body should mean more than what it was in relation to a man, so she <br/>
chose to use cunt because the etymology of that word was much nicer.  <br/>
It had only been made &quot;dirty&quot; because it was a word women used and <br/>
men turned it against them.<br/>
         This is fascinating, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that <br/>
many people shudder when they hear the &quot;c-word&quot;, which is fascinating <br/>
in itself.  The power of one word to turn one&#39;s stomach is amazing.  <br/>
There are certain words that, said without any inflection or written <br/>
alone on a piece of paper, can provoke emotional and sometimes <br/>
physical reactions.  These reactions lessen as we hear the word more <br/>
and more, causing us to become desensitized.<br/>
         I will readily admit that I am desensitized to most words.  <br/>
I knew this for certain when someone asked me if a movie that I had <br/>
just seen had too much cursing in it and I didn&#39;t remember.  I am not <br/>
bothered in the least by profanity in public space, as long as the <br/>
speaker knows other words too.<br/>
        My Aunt Laura used to say that people who cursed had bad <br/>
vocabularies.  When I was young I believed this, but as I got older I <br/>
came upon a revelation: curse words are just words, so if you use a <br/>
curse word then you have mathematically increased your vocabulary.  I <br/>
do know that she really meant that if someone needed to use cursing <br/>
to express him or herself and could find no other way, then their <br/>
vocabulary was limited.  I accepted this, but did not think about it <br/>
any further until I attended the Voodoo Fest last year.<br/>
        The Voodoo Fest is a massive outdoor concert that is held in <br/>
New Orleans the weekend before Halloween.  Ten to twenty bands of <br/>
varying notoriety play on three different stages, artisans set up <br/>
tents, and throngs of people walk around and get dirty, high, drunk, <br/>
sunburned and dehydrated (I&#39;m not going back this year).  One of the <br/>
performers at the 2000 Fest was Eminem, a young rapper much maligned <br/>
for the violence and cursing in his music.  I had heard his hit songs <br/>
and found them catchy if nothing else, so my friends and I planned to <br/>
watch him.<br/>
          Eminem went through a few hits, then launched into one that <br/>
I had never heard before, called I Shit on You.  The chorus was as <br/>
follows:<br/>
	If you don&#39;t like my shit, then you can suck my bad-ass dick! <br/>
&lt;repeat&gt;<br/>
	I shit on you! &lt;repeat several times&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       I finally truly understood what Aunt Laura was talking about <br/>
when she spoke of limited vocabularies.  I was growing annoyed  <br/>
Eminem was using these words like a little kid who has just <br/>
discovered a new toy.  I have long been a student of the proper way <br/>
to cuss someone out and Eminem hadn&#39;t.  The enlightened user of <br/>
profanity blends it with big, confusing words and non-profane <br/>
insults.  I&#39;ll mark that concert as the first time in my short adult <br/>
life that I got sick of &quot;dirty words&quot;.-<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Generally I don&#39;t have a problem with curse words. But for some reason, the <br/>
C word just makes me cringe. Yes I know it shoulnd&#39;t, it&#39;sjust a word but <br/>
that one does it for me. Just the sound of it. I&#39;m thinking, like in the <br/>
article, that it&#39;s because of how I always heard it used. Always to describe <br/>
women in just the worst possible way. I have the same problem with the N <br/>
word too. I know it&#39;s used a lot now in songs and even within the black <br/>
community, as term of endearment, although a lot of black people argue that <br/>
thought too. I just remember growing up and how I heard it used and what I <br/>
know they meant. I guess it&#39;s still with me today on both of those words but <br/>
I deal with it the best I can.<br/>
