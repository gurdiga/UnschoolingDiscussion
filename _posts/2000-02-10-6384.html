Does your mom really have all the information she needs about California?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332061765">Well, it all depends on where you want to live in CA.  For example, I can<br/>
get you 160 acres with a 5 bedroom house for between $120,000 and $150,000<br/>
up here.  Of course, if one is looking for schools, I can&#39;t tell you why<br/>
anyone would choose CA because we are at about the bottom to the list in<br/>
the 50 states so the schools where she is must be really bad or is it not<br/>
academics that she is talking about??  The local schools always test higher<br/>
 (about 40 points higher in reading than the state average) than the state<br/>
average but then, where does the state test compared to other states?<br/>
<br/>
Now, if she wanted to hs, then I would say this is the place to be.  But<br/>
then again, maybe that is only in my neck of the woods since up here the ps<br/>
system gives out info on the local hsing groups, etc.!<br/>
