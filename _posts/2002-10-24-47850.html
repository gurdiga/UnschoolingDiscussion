<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871489243">I used to work in pet stores as a teen and really enjoyed carrying around the <br/>
silky mice we carried in our store I found them friendly and they did not <br/>
potty on my when I had them in my hands or pockets. I always said I preferred <br/>
these to hamsters/gerbils as they seemed to bite and or potty in my hands. <br/>
Does anyone know how mice/silky mice compare as a pet to rats? TIA, Lynn F<br/>

point so we bought two and had a short-lived mice business, for people we<br/>
knew with snakes and large lizards. Rats are bigger, smarter, and<br/>
friendlier. Also, two male mice will almost never get along once they<br/>
reach adulthood, while rats almost always will.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473546937">We&#39;ve had both and Rats are so much better. We just loved our 2 ratties. Hopefully we&#39;ll get some more in the near future.<br/>
