<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510809315">My sister-in-law and I were having a conversation last night <br/>
about kids and homeschooling.  It started because I was telling <br/>
her a story about teenagers, dating, and sex.  Her comment was <br/>
something along the lines of &quot;Well you can&#39;t stop them from <br/>
doing what they really want to do anyway.&quot;  My response was &quot;Of <br/>
course you can!&quot;  If you raise your kids with moral values and <br/>
sense of what&#39;s right and wrong then, they will make the right <br/>
decisions about these things.  She then asked about peer <br/>
pressure and said that kids do lots of the wrong things because <br/>
of that.  That&#39;s how we got onto homeschooling because I told <br/>
her that was one of the hundred reasons my husband and I were <br/>
not sending our daughter to school.  I just don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a <br/>
smart choice to throw a group of kids together, all in the same <br/>
age range, with no life experience and expect them all to do the <br/>
right thing.  <br/>
<br/>
My question though is this: Am I just being na誰ve?  My daughter is <br/>
only 2 and it will be many more years before my husband and I <br/>
have to face dating and boyfriends.  I know that many of you on <br/>
this list have older kids so I wanted to ask you all.  Do &quot;they&quot; <br/>
(meaning teenagers) just go ahead and do what &quot;they&quot; want <br/>
regardless of what &quot;you&quot; (as parents) think?<br/>
<br/>
Hope this makes sense, <br/>
Melissa</div>

<br/>
  I&#39;d like to respond to this, though I rarely post.  When I was very <br/>
young, say between 7 and 12 yo, I used to say with all honesty that <br/>
my Mom was my best friend. I felt immense love towards her.  I told <br/>
her everything.  She was a very permissive parent, meaning I <br/>
basically felt like I could do what I wanted, except for things like <br/>
staying up late (school the next day) and the like.  For a 10 yo <br/>
girl, though, I had it pretty good.   In Jr. High, I began taking <br/>
advantage of my mothers permissiveness, going places without her <br/>
knowledge, sneaking <br/>
cigarettes, tasting little sips of my best friends Dad&#39;d brandy.  I <br/>
was a good girl who was experimenting.  Once my mom found cigarettes <br/>
in my purse.  I lied and told them they were not mine.  She seemed to <br/>
believe me, and I didn&#39;t get in trouble, or even really talked to.  <br/>
From there, I figured that she trusted me so much that I really COULD <br/>
get away with anything, and that is where it began, by the time I was <br/>
13, I was no longer a virgin, had shoplifted, started sneaking out of <br/>
the house at night, been very drunk many <br/>
times, and began smoking pot.  I was hanging out with total losers, <br/>
while still managing to get mostly A&#39;s on my report card and <br/>
remaining first chair clarinet in Symphonic band.  When my mother did <br/>
find out about things that I had done, she&#39;d cry with me, tell me how <br/>
worried she was, and that she loved me.  She made no real moves to <br/>
HELP me get away from the negativity that I was breeeding. She didn&#39;t <br/>
know how she could.  My peers had won over the respect that i had for <br/>
my mom by the time I was 13.  My High school years were even <br/>
worse...My mom did the best she could.  She was working 2 jobs for <br/>
most of my life to keep the bills paid, trying her best to keep 2 <br/>
kids happy.  I am the one who betrayed that trust.  My &quot;friends&quot; had <br/>
such a pull over me that I could not be stopped. If only I could have <br/>
taken a step back and seen those peers for who they really <br/>
were...kids just as troubled and lost as i was, with NO guidance or <br/>
motivation to succeed.  A lot of those kids ended up in jail or <br/>
prison, some became <br/>
junkies, some just got pregnant early and had abortions. Some died. A <br/>
few made it out OK. I was one of the few.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess that is one of the reasons why I unschool.  I want to be <br/>
THERE <br/>
for my daughter (11), not just tell her that I&#39;ll be there when she <br/>
needs me.  She needs my physical presence in her life daily, not just <br/>
for a couple of hours at night.  My relationship with my DD is even <br/>
better than my early relationship with my Mom. I, too, am a <br/>
very permissive parent.  The difference it that I KNOW my daughters <br/>
beliefs on cigarettes, sex, drugs, stuck up people, risky behavior.  <br/>
I know them because we talk about them,alot, not just try to sweep <br/>
them <br/>
under the rug.  When my mom found out that I was having sex at 13 ( <br/>
after all, she did trust that my boyfriend and I were just in my room <br/>
behind closed doors TALKING) she rushed me to the gyno and put me on <br/>
the pill.  We had never before talked about the dangers or risks <br/>
associated with sex.  She trusted me without having a basis for doing <br/>
so.  She automatically assumed that I would not <br/>
do anything to hurt myself or others.  Unfortunately the &#39;friends&#39; <br/>
that I chose and the temptations surrounding those friendships were <br/>
way too alluring.  And the whole time, I just knew I could get away <br/>
with it.  I don&#39;t want my dd to think that she can &#39;get away with <br/>
anything&#39;.  I want her to make responsible choices.  She will not be <br/>
able to make those responsible choices if left completely to her own <br/>
devices, however.  There has to be a good solid foundation from which <br/>
she can grow.  That is why I unschool, and I just hope it works.  It <br/>
scares me to think that my dd could end up making the same mistakes <br/>
as I did.  My dd, however, has a much healthier self-esteem than I <br/>
did at her age. She has a strong sense of who she is and where she <br/>
wants her life to take her.  she is a very different young person <br/>
than I was. That being said,  I am making a concerted effort, every <br/>
day, to keep the lines of communication OPEN.  I will never just <br/>
ASSUME that she knows what my feelings are, or that I know what hers <br/>
are.  We talk about everything. And we do it often.  She is not <br/>
afraid to ask questions about &#39;sensitive&#39; subjects, and I give her <br/>
honest answers, not scare tactics or denial, not threats. Also, I <br/>
know who her friends are.  To me this is KEY.  My mother never had a <br/>
clue as to who the kids were that I was hanging out with. BTW, my mom <br/>
and I now have a very open relationship.  She knows all about my past <br/>
and my poor choices.  We have cried together several times as <br/>
I &#39;confessed&#39; the things that I had done in my youth.  We understand <br/>
each other, and she is, to this day, one of my best friends.  I&#39;m <br/>
just glad that I am still here to be able to say that.</div>

 </span></blockquote>  I have an 18 yo and a 15 yo and I know a lot of unschooled teens. I <br/>
can tell you that now that they are mostly out on their own, with <br/>
infinite opportunities to make their own decisions, they very clearly <br/>
demonstrate that they care a LOT about our (parents) opinions. First, <br/>
they ask what we think - a lot - they want to talk about everything - <br/>
all the dilemmas they face. Second, they tell me that they always have <br/>
my voice in their heads - that even when they don&#39;t talk directly to me <br/>
about things, they are aware of what I&#39;d probably say. They argue with <br/>
me in their heads, too, and that helps them think through things. It <br/>
isn&#39;t all sweet and agreeable and easy -- don&#39;t get me wrong - and <br/>
sometimes it is hard to bite my tongue and NOT try to just give orders <br/>
because I want so MUCH for them to make choices that I agree with - and <br/>
they don&#39;t always.<br/>
<br/>
They will do what they want - but what they want will include serious <br/>
consideration of what we parents think. As an unschooling parent, you <br/>
probably won&#39;t feel totally shut out and you won&#39;t feel like they don&#39;t <br/>
even care what you think at all, which is how it is with MANY schooled <br/>
kids and their parents (but not all, obviously). Unschooled kids have a <br/>
habit of thinking for themselves and a lot of practice taking into <br/>
consideration parental input - they&#39;ve been doing it for many years - <br/>
nothing changes except that the decisions seem to be more serious - <br/>
drugs, alcohol, sex, driving, traveling, working, college, moving out, <br/>
moving away, getting married, having babies, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Start talking about stuff early - parents need practice listening to <br/>
the difficult-to-hear stuff as much as kids need to be comfortable <br/>
talking about it.<br/>
<br/>
Again, they WILL be making their own decisions - so, in that sense, <br/>
they&#39;ll do what they want. But they won&#39;t be like so MANY schooled kids <br/>
who totally disregard parental input - often don&#39;t even get any input <br/>
because, by that time, they are living such separate lives.<br/>
