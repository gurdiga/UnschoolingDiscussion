<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015172000">Hi, I&#39;m new to this list.  We have 3 children ages 13, 12 and 8.  We <br/>
are not new to homeschooling but still not passed the &quot;self-doubt&quot; <br/>
stage, if that is at all possible.  After reading the headlines about <br/>
the Vermont family&#39;s ordeal (educational neglect) and considering we <br/>
have a skeptical Grandmother on our heels, I reacted with, well, <br/>
panic.<br/>
I believe in the &quot;unschooling&quot; approach, yet, I confess that at times <br/>
it does prove un-nerving for me.  Because it would appear that my <br/>
children do &quot;nothing&quot;.  My 8yr. old doesn&#39;t read but has the richest <br/>
imagination, draws anime for hours, and basically enjoys doing his <br/>
own thing.  My oldest son (13) is gifted in music, he is able to play <br/>
many instruments by ear and I take him weekly to a blues club to play <br/>
with musicians of his caliber.  My daughter (12) wants to return to <br/>
school and orchestrates her own learning into weekly assignments <br/>
(which I think is an incredible demonstration of time mgmt., <br/>
organizational skills as well as determination).  This is really an <br/>
abbreviated version of our life.  Does anyone have any suggestions <br/>
for dealing with the doubt, criticisms, etc...that one inevitibly <br/>
goes through.  Oh, did I mention I hate the record keeping part of <br/>
homeschooling?  I keep a journal, but not religiously.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Rhonda</div>

Where are you?  You shouldn&#39;t have to keep a journal anywhere.<br/>

Hang around at www.unschooling.com and help others who are newer, and read <br/>
what&#39;s already there.  That will help you be more confident.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Uh huh. In South Carolina you have to keep a journal, daily log, <br/>
portfolio---some kind of record keeping. In each of the following: reading, <br/>
writing, &#39;rithmatic, social studies, & science. Upper grades: add composition <br/>
& literature. Every state&#39;s different. Check your laws.<br/>

<br/>
A portfolio isn&#39;t a journal.  And none of it has to be done daily.<br/>
<br/>
Teachers don&#39;t keep a journal on each student, or a daily log.  They have <br/>
some kind of record keeping, but it&#39;s TRULY nowhere near a daily journal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-10661873"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;&gt;Where are you?  You shouldn&#39;t have to keep a journal anywhere.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m from Australia so I&#39;m a little unsure of how things work for you guys.<br/>
We are expected to register with the Education Dept and meet with a<br/>
moderator once a year with a program that complies with the &#39;Curriculum<br/>
Framework&#39; that is in use at public schools.<br/>
<br/>
 I haven&#39;t had any problems so far but this is our first year of unschooling<br/>
so I&#39;m thinking a journal would be a good idea. The moderator is new to the<br/>
job and is a very pleasant person but is still teaching and wants to see<br/>
lots of paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not due to see him till later on in the year but I do get panicky when I<br/>
think about it. A friend suggested to me that I make a yearbook. She does<br/>
one and her kids love to read it from time to time to remember the year. She<br/>
puts in favourite pictures, photos, writes about the places they&#39;ve been<br/>
etc. We began one this year and the kids love contributing to it. I&#39;m hoping<br/>
it will count as record keeping!<br/>
