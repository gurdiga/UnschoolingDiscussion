<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409074943">****Rowan Atkinson, who does Mr. Bean, is the only actor I can think of<br/>
who does<br/>
mime AND just voicework (he was Zazu (sp?) the bird who advises Simba on<br/>
Lion<br/>
King).  My favorite of all his stuff is Black Adder.  Especially the<br/>
Elizabethan series.  ****<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Very doable in the Elizabethan role - beard and all - yummy.  Kind of<br/>
reminds me of my husband.<br/>
<br/>
I happen to find Rowan Atkinson very smart and sexy.<br/>
<br/>
Kate<br/>
who is off to find her husband now that I&#39;ve started thinking of him as<br/>
looking (and acting) like Rowan Atkinson</div>
