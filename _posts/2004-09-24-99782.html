<div id="ygrps-yiv-443242607"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As for being assessed by a certified school teacher and<br/>
&gt;handing in portfolios, who knows?  I wouldn&#39;t even know where to begin <br/>
&gt;finding a<br/>
&gt;teacher willing to &quot;assess&quot; an unschooled child and find anything <br/>
&gt;positive.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>when we lived in ohio we belonged to a hs group. in oh you have to either <br/>
test, have a teacher sign that your child is progressing to the best of <br/>
their ability, or some other thing that is agreed upon by the super and the <br/>
parent. in our group there were several teachers who would sign these <br/>
papers. some were strict and wanted paper work and others had group meetings <br/>
where they (parents and children) talked about what they did the previous <br/>
year and what they may want to work on in the future.<br/>
maybe if you look you will find something like this where you live.<br/>
we now live in indiana where the law is that you have to take attendance <br/>
(gosh where did i lose that kid this time?) and provide a list of curriculum <br/>
if asked by the state super for INFORMATIONAL purposes only.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-470795041">Sarah was in a play last year. She played a duck in<br/>
The Frog Prince, put on by the Missoula Children&#39;s<br/>
Theatre. She even had three &quot;quacking&quot; lines (LOL<br/>
speaking!)<br/>
<br/>
I found a local children&#39;s theatre, and it turns out<br/>
the class starts TOMORROW!! They still have openings,<br/>
so she will be able to join in! She is guaranteed a<br/>
spot in the January production (The Music Man),<br/>
although she&#39;ll audition the same as anyone else. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m SO excited for her!! I think this will definitely<br/>
help her to settle in and settle down.<br/>
