<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541495478">Someone asked me why it was necessary to put an age limit on auditions for our current play--sorry it&#39;s taken so long to reply.<br/>
<br/>
There are only 10 characters in the play, the youngest being about 25, most of the others being middle-aged or older, with the oldest being close to 70.  We auditioned kids 12 (I said 13, meant 12) and older.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there are some situations in this play that are somewhat adult in scope and we felt more comfortable dealing with older kids.<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons we picked Pollyanna for the spring is because we&#39;ll be writing our own script and can add lots of parts for all ages. It makes me both tremendously excited and completely exhausted to think about it.<br/>

Please let the list know when those performances are.  Not only are there <br/>
probably some in range to possibly go, but Keith asked me this morning as I <br/>
was taking him to the airport to go to Minneapolis...<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t be his only trip out there this season.<br/>
