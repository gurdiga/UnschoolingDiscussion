<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308819799">Olivia,   I don&#39;t know if you are familiar with Shaklee products or not,<br/>
but they are created by a 50 yr. old company who distributes vitamins,<br/>
household, and personal care products  created with as little impact on<br/>
the environment as possible.  The ingredients are all biodegradable and <br/>
phosphate-free (in the laundry and dishwasher detergents) with the<br/>
breakdown time of the laundry detergent being about 6 hrs.  Their<br/>
dishwasher detergent leaves no residue and works well even in hard water,<br/>
and all their products are highly concentrated so that they are much less<br/>
expensive than supermarket brands.  They also manufacture Basic-H , which<br/>
is probably their best known product.<br/>
I don&#39;t know where you live,  but perhaps you can find a Shaklee<br/>
distributor near you (these products are not sold in stores).  If not, I<br/>
can arrange to get you a product guide if you give me your address (my<br/>
e-mail is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:aspang1@...">aspang1@...</a>).  My family and I have been using Shaklee<br/>
products for about two years, and our health has improved tremendously.<br/>
