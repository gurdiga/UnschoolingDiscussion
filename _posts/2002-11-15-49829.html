&lt;&lt; True.  But unless you tell someone to play something note for note, you <br/>
lose <br/>
 CONTROL!!<br/>
 It did always seem to me in school that precision was stressed over <br/>
 musicality, and mechanics over tone. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is where I feel so gypped!! I was taught by this note to note <br/>
BS....never learned anything by ear.<br/>
I took a few years of piano, a couply  years of flute, was in band and still <br/>
never learned much by ear. I did mess around at home, in between the life <br/>
sucking lessons and actually started to figure out, not the names of the <br/>
notes but listening to, and copying songs.<br/>
We are getting Trevor an electric guitar for Xmas. I think I&#39;m going to take <br/>
lessons with him, just long enough for us both to learn some fingerings, and <br/>
then just do it the gypsy way after that.<br/>
