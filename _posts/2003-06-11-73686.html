I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so much the dresses, but their style....modest.....coupled <br/>
with a Christian lady&#39;s countenance. So many of the unsaved ladies had such a <br/>
hard or aged looked about them. <br/>

9:49 AM     Well, we are not to be conformed to this world,including in <br/>
dress. So, although our dresses are normal to us- they do stick out to the world <br/>
who barely wear more than undies to Walmart!! The thing is, we stick out in a <br/>
good way. We had two saved at WAlmart yesterday because a couple of 30ish ladies <br/>
came up to myself and dds to tell me how well behaved they were and how nice <br/>
they looked in their jumpers! <br/>
<br/>
Saved.<br/>
<br/>
Well I read the whole thing and though someone asked them to expound on <br/>
&quot;saved&quot; I guess that answer hadn&#39;t come back yet.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose occasionally when people have talked to me about my kids&#39; behavior <br/>
in public they were slightly saved, or at least a little shaken.    Not saved <br/>
from brimstone (though it&#39;s not clear the Walmart customers were either), but <br/>
saved from the complacent feeling that kids were doomed to be all the same <br/>
sad, surly way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470383330">&lt;&lt;I remember a lot of<br/>
sermons about witnessing to strangers in stores and getting them saved.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ack!  That would drive me crazy!  We&#39;ve had two missionaries knocking our <br/>
door down and ringing the phone off the wall for almost three weeks.  I&#39;ve <br/>
explained to them that we aren&#39;t interested, we are moving and nine million <br/>
other things.  I&#39;ve asked them not to come by or call anymore (a friend&#39;s <br/>
mom gave them my number...another GRRR altogether!) but they still come.  <br/>
Yesterday, there were four who came to the door and one was poking his nose <br/>
in the front room window trying to get the kids to open the door and another <br/>
was walking around to my backyard!!    I can&#39;t imagine being hounded at a <br/>
store, while trying o shop!<br/>
<br/>
I know they have good intentions but I&#39;m ready to call the police!  My <br/>
grandmother, a devout Christian who believes in spreading the word even <br/>
thinks I should call the police.<br/>
<br/>
What gets my goat is that we pretty much all know that churches exist.  You <br/>
can&#39;t drive 10 miles most places without seeing one....or here in the DFW <br/>
metroplex, fifty.  If you are interested, chances are you can find a place <br/>
of worship!  It&#39;s one thing for them to knock the first time and ask if they <br/>
can &#39;share the word&#39; but when they are asked not to come by or <br/>
call......well....<br/>
<br/>
My husband has a bumper sticker with two missionary-looking people carrying, <br/>
presumably, a bible.  It has a large red circle around it and the picture is <br/>
crossed out.  I&#39;m about to slap it on my front door, tacky as it <br/>
is.....maybe then they will get the hint!<br/>
<br/>
Rant over,<br/>

<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
But surely lots of people will say &quot;Yes, praise Jesus!&quot; just to get out of a <br/>
conversation with proslytizing folks at WalMart.  I doubt they baptized them <br/>
down at sporting goods.    <br/>
<br/>
Maybe they did!  (Thinking of all water sources at a big WalMart.... maybe <br/>
there were even outdoor fountains in the gardening area.  And any passing <br/>
cleaner&#39;s cart has a bottle of windex for sprinkling, if the modestly dressed <br/>
homeschooling family wasn&#39;t of a belief that submersion is required.  Would Windex <br/>
work in a pinch?)<br/>
<br/>
Drinking water aisle... cart... kids&#39; wading pools... (pick up an oversized <br/>
white t-shirt on the way through women&#39;s wear)...<br/>
<br/>
Okay.  It could work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-753905734">Oh ick, hack, barf!  I&#39;m curious, the husbands all say, WE should switch to <br/>
wearing dresses, or, she and *I* decided to wear only dresses, so are the <br/>
men wearing dresses too now?!?!  Har har!  Man!  I was rofl!!  I imagine if <br/>
some of those women knew their husbands eyes were averted so often, they <br/>
might WANT to dress attractively.  Evidently, there are a LOT of insecure <br/>
men on that board, my opinion anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m stubborn and bull-headed; my husband would be afraid to tell me <br/>
what I *couldn&#39;t* wear!  Then again, maybe the men who are saying they wear <br/>
dreses too (hey, that&#39;s how they wrote it) are doing so because they have <br/>
wives like me.  If my husband came home and told me I was to wear dresses <br/>
only, he&#39;d either be booking a hotel room or buying himself a slip and <br/>

allowed to wear dresses. I didn&#39;t get it then and don&#39;t get it now. No, change <br/>
that, I totally get it, but didn&#39;t agree with it then, nor do I agree now. I <br/>
think I posted here before about how much my mom had to be conferenced on how <br/>
LOUD and FAD-Like my dresses were. What a crock, God/dess doesn&#39;t give a <br/>
hootinannie what a person wears. At least in my not-so-humble opinion. LOL does <br/>
not-so-humble equate to prideful in which case I&#39;m probably sinning??? <br/>

equipment, you had to wear shorts under your dress, so that if you were on the slide, <br/>
swings, or monkey bars, no one could see your underwear. You had to show your <br/>
shorts to even be allowed in the play equipment area. I boycotted that whole <br/>
deal early and decided to play handball instead. I don&#39;t think I played on the <br/>
playground since the 1st grade. But I became a handball queen and a <br/>
tetherball princess. In other words, I played tetherball pretty well, but I could kick <br/>
ass on the handball court.<br/>

Still sinning,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is my impression of dresses and why I very very seldom wear one (I own<br/>
one skirt and the last time I wore it was almost 2 years ago).  When I was<br/>
in high school, I found that the &quot;bad&quot; girls always wore dresses or skirts<br/>
because it was a lot easier to do the deed.  Easy access.  The longer and<br/>
poofier the dress, made it even easier.  I&#39;m having a real hard time seeing<br/>
how dresses are more Christian-like.  I can&#39;t do anything in one without my<br/>
underwear showing.<br/>
<br/>
My 6.75 yo daughter wears dresses all the time, but with biker shorts<br/>
underneath.  We have Christian friends that she&#39;ll occasionally play with<br/>
and I often see a bit more of them than they probably realize (and I&#39;m not<br/>
looking!).<br/>

parents that her dresses were too short and we were in K at the time. (This was <br/>
early &#39;70&#39;s when the short frilly baby-doll style dresses were in.) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Or you could be looking to deep in to it, maybe?<br/>
I see it as there is a choice to give freedom or not. Freedom is <br/>
defined as &quot;the condition of being free; the power to act or speak or <br/>
think without externally imposed restraints&quot;. There are wives who <br/>
DON&#39;T have freedom. I do. <br/>
Not much I see as confusing about that.<br/>
But what i said about respect to him. We have a partnership so what I <br/>
do, DOES directly effect him {and my children} and it works the other <br/>
way around. If I blatently do things without thinking of what is best <br/>
all around for US, then I personally feel I&#39;m not holding up my end <br/>
of the deal as a wife or a mother. {say if I was to be gone for a <br/>
week at a time without letting anyone knowing where I am and if I am <br/>
ok} And the end result will be a loss of communication/respect. None <br/>
of what I wrote said that he controls me in any way. There are many <br/>
people {including him above all} that could tell you that is not at <br/>
all the case. :-b <br/>
Just a respect for others feelings and welfare. And the no bikini <br/>
would be a bit more of self-humility/personal morals.<br/>

We were just joking around.  Freedom in the sense that he doesn&#39;t dictate <br/>
what we can and cannot wear, not freedom as in, we have to *get* freedom <br/>
from them to wear what we want to wear.  Is that a bunch of harbledybloo <br/>
too? :)<br/>
<br/>
The men on that board were telling their wives to wear dresses only, some <br/>
were considering it and so on.  I was saying I thought it was rediculous for <br/>
a husband to tell his wife what she can and cannot wear.  Of course, there <br/>
is the unspoken &#39;you shouldn&#39;t wear a bikini to Walmart&#39; type of thing but <br/>
that isn&#39;t dictated by my husband.  Just common sense!<br/>
