<div id="ygrps-yiv-568654534">Around here, way down south, it&#39;s easy to tell the difference between a <br/>
school project and a personal project.  It&#39;s all in the way someone says the word.  <br/>
If its a project, the normal, correct way to ennunicate and pronounce the <br/>
word, then its just a personal something you working on at your own leisure.   My <br/>
kids have several projects going all the time.  A Lego city, a poster they <br/>
are coloring, an concoction in a jar, raising puppies, etc etc.   JP might say.. <br/>
I just added a new building to my lego project.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, if someone is talking about  a school project.. It becomes a Pro-JECT.  <br/>
With the emphasis clearly on the JECT.   It&#39;s just like when the clerk at <br/>
Wal-mart comes on the intercom and calles for the RE-turns.&quot;aisle 5, come to the <br/>
front for your RE-turns&quot;  LOL, I could die laughing.  Or when someone is being <br/>
derogatory and says RE-tard.    If the emphasis is on the wrong syllable , <br/>
it&#39;s probably not a good thing.. :-)<br/>
