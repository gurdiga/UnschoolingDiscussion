<div id="ygrps-yiv-735099982">Remember the little girl who stole a dollar out of the candy sale drawer?  <br/>
Here&#39;s the update.<br/>
<br/>
We talked to her grandmother ahead of time and decided she would help us find <br/>
a way for the girl to earn the dollar back.  We structured our entire meeting <br/>
this weekend around the concept of trustworthiness, honesty and stealing.  I <br/>
mean, we really did it up.  And the girl responded with all the right <br/>
answers, etc.  She *got it*.  I know because I was paying attention.<br/>
<br/>
So, after the meeting my co-leader and I sat down with the girl.  I was very <br/>
gentle with her, reminded her about the incident and how I would know that a <br/>
dollar was missing, and that it was.  She denied that she took it.  We talked <br/>
some more, told her we weren&#39;t upset, etc., and after a while, she admitted <br/>
she took it.  No tears, no remorse, no nothing, though.  She looked at me, <br/>
right in the eye, the whole time.  We brought the grandmother in and the girl <br/>
and she worked out some chores she could do around the house.  <br/>
<br/>
We thought we did a good job, even though my co-leader and I disagreed on the <br/>
girl&#39;s reaction.  She thought the girl was fighting back tears, and I never <br/>
once thought that.  In fact, I thought she was tuning us out, and only <br/>
nodding when necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward to Saturday afternoon&#39;s candy sale.  I took her straight away <br/>
with me from the meeting to the sale.  All the kids were hungry, and she was <br/>
the only one without money, so I bought her a meal on the way, which I didn&#39;t <br/>
mind in the least.  In the Burger King she found a dime that someone had <br/>
dropped (I saw it first).  I said, &quot;Oh, a reward for being honest!&quot; and said <br/>
she could put it in her pocket.<br/>
<br/>
About an hour into the candy sale, she comes up with a quarter and the dime <br/>
and asks if she can buy some of the mints we are selling.  I told her she <br/>
didn&#39;t have enough, but asked her where she got the quarter.  She said, &quot;From <br/>
that man.&quot;  It&#39;s not unusual for people to offer the kids money, and so I <br/>
didn&#39;t think much about it...but I did ask her if he gave any of the other <br/>
kids money.  She said no.  The rest of the day went on without incident.<br/>
<br/>
However, when I get home with the money from the sale, the drawer was $10 <br/>
short.  Now, I KNOW that there are a hundred other explanations to why that <br/>
could be.  I could have given someone change for a $20 instead of a $10, it <br/>
could have blown away, etc.  Our candy is $4/box, so it&#39;s probably not an <br/>
accounting error.  Besides all our inventory is correct, etc.  But this is <br/>
very suspicious.  I have no evidence that says she could have taken it, other <br/>
than her bad reputation.  I did find the lid of the money box kind of ajar a <br/>
couple of times, and I know at least once I had left it that way, and the <br/>
other time I was surprised and thought I&#39;d locked it back.  <br/>
<br/>
Her reputation gets worse, however.  Another parent, who didn&#39;t know about <br/>
the missing dollar or 10, told my co-leader that he heard the girl ask <br/>
someone for a quarter at a candy sale 2 weekends ago.  He said he was too <br/>
shocked to say anything at the time, and just remembered today.  We can&#39;t <br/>
have our kids asking for people&#39;s money to put in their pocket.  There&#39;s no <br/>
excuse for that.  But now we know how she got the quarter yesterday, too.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve decided that since she&#39;s been at enough sales to meet her fair share, <br/>
that she&#39;s not invited back to any more.  I think I will notify the <br/>
grandmother that if the girl turns up with a lot of money or something she <br/>
bought worth $10, then we know where she probably got it.  I&#39;m not going to <br/>
accuse her outright, because I have no evidence.  Luckily for us, we also <br/>
received $20 in donations that day, so I made up the $10 out of that.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading this far.  Does anyone have any input?<br/>

Well I have a comment and a question.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s living with her grandmother for some reason.  Was her mother drinking <br/>
too much?  Is she fetal-alcohol damaged so that her conscience isn&#39;t going to <br/>
develop?  This happens.<br/>
<br/>
And the first comment above, although sensible for the group and probably <br/>
inavoidable, is just one in ten or twenty such rejections she will receive <br/>
before she&#39;s grown, and they will form her basis for justification of her bad <br/>
actions when she&#39;s older.<br/>
<br/>
A child like that is a GOOD justification for religion, even lame religion.  <br/>
If she could be saved and have a church that would pressure her to be good <br/>
out of fear of hell, maybe she could become a more reliable member of <br/>
society.  Or maybe she&#39;d become secretary and steal from the church.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the answer to kids who don&#39;t want to do better.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, she&#39;s not.  She lives with her parents and sister, and the grandmother <br/>
does all the &quot;extra&quot; stuff with them, like Camp Fire.  Although, I do not <br/>
know any of her &quot;history&quot; so to speak.  I met her mother yesterday, who was <br/>
seems so entirely reasonable, but is apparently making it on just her salary. <br/>
 It appears to me that the two families (the boy cousin and the 2 sisters <br/>
live next door to each other in the same apartment complex) are both <br/>
dominated by overbearing fathers.  The boy&#39;s life is further complicated by <br/>
his also over-bearing step-father.  oy.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And the first comment above, although sensible for the group and probably <br/>

<br/>
actions when she&#39;s older.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know.  I keep thinking if I had more time with them all, I would be <br/>
able to have more influence.  But so much is sacrificed for the group and for <br/>
expediency.  I can only hope to be a small part.  I wasn&#39;t going to actually <br/>
inform her that she wasn&#39;t invited back. She&#39;s only 8...she doesn&#39;t know when <br/>
her next turn is, anyway.  The grandmother was simply not going to take her.  <br/>
She&#39;s already been a time when it wasn&#39;t her turn, anyway, and the littlest <br/>
sister is behind in her turns.<br/>
<br/>
But, now that I&#39;ve found the money, I only have to work on the begging issue. <br/>
 Would anyone else call that behavior &quot;begging&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Sandra.<br/>

for institutional education or maybe a good stiff paddle.  (shiver) (no <br/>
offense intended to those of you who find comfort in organized religions.)<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that after her oblique talking to, she did NOT take more money <br/>
(or did I read that wrong?  It was awhile ago.), even though the <br/>
opportunity was there, right in front of her *and* there were times that <br/>
nobody was watching!  She resisted the temptation!  How many adults can <br/>
resist when they really, really want something?!  (c&#39;mon, fess up.  Did you <br/>
finish off that carton of ice cream all by yourself?  Of course you <br/>
didn&#39;t... I got to it first!)<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, what assumptions were made when people thought money had gone <br/>
missing?  Did people assume it was an accounting error, or did they assume <br/>
that the &#39;previously caught&#39; child had taken not one dollar now, but <br/>
Ten.  What does that say about latent expectations for the child?  What <br/>
sort of expectations should we have for the kids who have not yet been <br/>
caught in teh act?  Do those latent expectations (if any) influence how she <br/>
or the other kids are treated?<br/>
<br/>
What she did end up doing was ask a total stranger for money - odd maybe, <br/>
but there it is.  She&#39;s a telemarketer without a phone, a street musician <br/>
without a guitar, a kid without a paying job.  Did she ask for the money in <br/>
the name of the group or for herself and does she know what &#39;accepting <br/>
donations under false pretences&#39; is?  Did the man give the money in the <br/>
expectation that it would go into the group kitty?  Was he just being kind <br/>
to a child?<br/>
<br/>
I asked complete strangers for money once during a Ren Fair maybe 20 years <br/>
ago.  Made a good 8 or 10 bucks by offering to write their names for a <br/>
quarter.  I was a most learned individual, you see.  They&#39;d pay up, I&#39;d <br/>
write a big florid &quot;X&quot;, make an exclamation on how wonderous it was and <br/>
they&#39;d laugh and wander off.  My friend and I got dinner.  Is what we did, <br/>
different from what she did?  I suppose it rests on how she represented <br/>
herself, and to whom exactly the man thought he was donating money (the <br/>
troop or the individual child.)  I don&#39;t suppose you could find and ask the <br/>
man?<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think maybe the child needs a way to make some money of her <br/>
own.  Some that she can keep for herself and use for her own little <br/>
wants... but what kind of safe jobs would be out there for an 8 year old, I <br/>
couldn&#39;t begin to say.<br/>
Maybe she could work a Ren Fair...<br/>

complete strangers for money.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course I counted and recounted the money before I settled on the idea that <br/>
the $10 may have been stolen.  It could have blown away, too.  It&#39;s very easy <br/>
to see how an adult or someone else could have slipped their hand in behind <br/>
me and taken a wad of money.  I didn&#39;t accuse her and had no intentions of <br/>
doing so.  It wasn&#39;t until after I went back and counted and recounted six <br/>
DAYS worth of the money that I found the $10.  That&#39;s how much I didn&#39;t want <br/>
to accuse her.<br/>
<br/>
I am taking your post philosophically, however.  This kind of input is <br/>
exactly what I need to become a better leader.<br/>

If they&#39;re of the opinion that stealing from other people is okay, yes.<br/>

Not just for being opinionated; for lacking a conscience.<br/>

<br/>
It says that once someone doesn&#39;t trust you, you are no longer trustworthy.<br/>
It&#39;s more &quot;fair&quot; and right to be wary of those we shouldn&#39;t trust than to try <br/>
to be so &quot;fair&quot; and openminded and forgiving and non-prejudiced and <br/>
politically correct that we leave our families and our possessions as open to <br/>
potential thieves as to those who have been trustworthy for years.<br/>
<br/>
Some thieves count on the embarrassment others would feel at having a <br/>
suspicious first reaction.  They LIKE to make people feel bad for not having <br/>
trusted them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What <br/>
sort of expectations should we have for the kids who have not yet been <br/>
caught in teh act?  Do those latent expectations (if any) influence how she <br/>
or the other kids are treated?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Some kids don&#39;t like old women because one yelled at them and told them to <br/>
get out of her yard.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids hate teachers.  Some adults still do, til they die.<br/>
<br/>
Prejudices are often based on something that really happened to a person.  If <br/>
a marine in uniform had raped my sister, I would have had an uneasy feeling <br/>
about marines forever more.  But the guy who raped my sister was in everyday <br/>
t-shirt and jeans and it&#39;s harder to be prejudiced against every human (or <br/>
half, even) as it is to be against a limited group.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You make a very good point, but goodness, the kid is only 8!  She&#39;s still <br/>
forming her conscience, her sense of right, wrong and social expectations, <br/>
part of which are being defined by participating in Tuck&#39;s <br/>
group.   Determining individual goods from community goods is another <br/>
distinction that takes some kids a bit of learning.  It took years before <br/>
my daughter would stop giving our &#39;stuff&#39; away.  You needed it?  She gave <br/>
it, sometimes even if you didn&#39;t need it!  Thankfully, it was mostly small <br/>
stuff.  ...and I don&#39;t think I stopped saying, &quot;Honey, that&#39;s socially <br/>
inappropriate.  I Really need you to not do that right now, okay?&quot; until <br/>
the kids were at least 12 or so.  Okay, so I still want to say it sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what seems to speak most strongly to me is that when she was subtly <br/>
remonstrated with for her actions, she stopped the behavior.  (Okay, and <br/>
switched to something a little more odd-ball, granted!)  Anyway, I don&#39;t <br/>
know the kid, I wasn&#39;t there, I won&#39;t be dealing with her, and will <br/>
probably never meet her, but it sounds to me like she&#39;s at least *trying* <br/>
to be trustworthy.  If she&#39;d been reasoned/remonstrated with and still <br/>
continued the behavior, then I&#39;d have to agree with your point to a much <br/>
greater degree.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody&#39;s perfect, myself included.  I could be reading it completely <br/>
wrong... then again, I could be wrong about that too. (grin)<br/>
My hat&#39;s still off to Tuck for dealing with this.  Glad it&#39;s not me!!!<br/>

really in a position to do anything about it *permanently* (i.e., not her <br/>
parent), but I don&#39;t think she got that it&#39;s wrong to steal.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
she thought what she did WAS stealing.  Some things kids don&#39;t get.  I wonder <br/>
whether this one will ever get it.  <br/>
<br/>
And for the record, she did not steal again after we had our little talk.  <br/>
But I think she&#39;s going to have to prove herself before I will trust her. <br/>

&gt; drawer? <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s the update.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We talked to her grandmother ahead of time and decided she would help <br/>
&gt; us find<br/>
&gt; a way for the girl to earn the dollar back.  We structured our entire <br/>
&gt; meeting<br/>
&gt; this weekend around the concept of trustworthiness, honesty and <br/>
&gt; stealing.  I<br/>
&gt; mean, we really did it up.  And the girl responded with all the right<br/>
&gt; answers, etc.  She *got it*.  I know because I was paying attention.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, after the meeting my co-leader and I sat down with the girl.  I <br/>
&gt; was very<br/>
&gt; gentle with her, reminded her about the incident and how I would know <br/>
&gt; that a<br/>
&gt; dollar was missing, and that it was.  She denied that she took it.  We <br/>
&gt; talked<br/>
&gt; some more, told her we weren&#39;t upset, etc., and after a while, she <br/>
&gt; admitted<br/>
&gt; she took it.  No tears, no remorse, no nothing, though.  She looked at <br/>
&gt; me,<br/>
&gt; right in the eye, the whole time.  We brought the grandmother in and <br/>
&gt; the girl<br/>
&gt; and she worked out some chores she could do around the house. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We thought we did a good job, even though my co-leader and I disagreed <br/>
&gt; on the<br/>
&gt; girl&#39;s reaction.  She thought the girl was fighting back tears, and I <br/>
&gt; never<br/>
&gt; once thought that.  In fact, I thought she was tuning us out, and only<br/>
&gt; nodding when necessary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fast forward to Saturday afternoon&#39;s candy sale.  I took her straight <br/>
&gt; away<br/>
&gt; with me from the meeting to the sale.  All the kids were hungry, and <br/>
&gt; she was<br/>
&gt; the only one without money, so I bought her a meal on the way, which I <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; mind in the least.  In the Burger King she found a dime that someone had<br/>
&gt; dropped (I saw it first).  I said, &quot;Oh, a reward for being honest!&quot; <br/>
&gt; and said<br/>
&gt; she could put it in her pocket.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; About an hour into the candy sale, she comes up with a quarter and the <br/>
&gt; dime<br/>
&gt; and asks if she can buy some of the mints we are selling.  I told her she<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t have enough, but asked her where she got the quarter.  She <br/>
&gt; said, &quot;From<br/>
&gt; that man.&quot;  It&#39;s not unusual for people to offer the kids money, and so I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t think much about it...but I did ask her if he gave any of the <br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt; kids money.  She said no.  The rest of the day went on without incident.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, when I get home with the money from the sale, the drawer was $10<br/>
&gt; short.  Now, I KNOW that there are a hundred other explanations to why <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; could be.  I could have given someone change for a $20 instead of a <br/>
&gt; $10, it<br/>
&gt; could have blown away, etc.  Our candy is $4/box, so it&#39;s probably not an<br/>
&gt; accounting error.  Besides all our inventory is correct, etc.  But <br/>
&gt; this is<br/>
&gt; very suspicious.  I have no evidence that says she could have taken <br/>
&gt; it, other<br/>
&gt; than her bad reputation.  I did find the lid of the money box kind of <br/>
&gt; ajar a<br/>
&gt; couple of times, and I know at least once I had left it that way, and the<br/>
&gt; other time I was surprised and thought I&#39;d locked it back. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Her reputation gets worse, however.  Another parent, who didn&#39;t know <br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; the missing dollar or 10, told my co-leader that he heard the girl ask<br/>
&gt; someone for a quarter at a candy sale 2 weekends ago.  He said he was too<br/>
&gt; shocked to say anything at the time, and just remembered today.  We can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have our kids asking for people&#39;s money to put in their pocket.  <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s no<br/>
&gt; excuse for that.  But now we know how she got the quarter yesterday, <br/>
&gt; too. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve decided that since she&#39;s been at enough sales to meet her fair <br/>
&gt; share,<br/>
&gt; that she&#39;s not invited back to any more.  I think I will notify the<br/>
&gt; grandmother that if the girl turns up with a lot of money or something <br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; bought worth $10, then we know where she probably got it.  I&#39;m not <br/>
&gt; going to<br/>
&gt; accuse her outright, because I have no evidence.  Luckily for us, we also<br/>
&gt; received $20 in donations that day, so I made up the $10 out of that. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for reading this far.  Does anyone have any input?<br/>
