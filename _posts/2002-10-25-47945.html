| &gt; I&#39;m curious, what do you think my definition of respect is?<br/>
The only<br/>
| &gt; difference I can see with my definition and most of you all&#39;s<br/>
definition is<br/>
| &gt; you think children should be respected over and above adults,<br/>
while I think<br/>
| &gt; everyone should be respected equally.<br/>
|<br/>
|<br/>
| This is wrong. I don&#39;t even have to say &quot;I think it&#39;s wrong&quot;<br/>
because it&#39;s<br/>
| just plain wrong.<br/>
|<br/>
| What has been said, repeatedly, patiently, and obviously<br/>
uselessly, is that<br/>
| a child&#39;s right to living without pain supercedes an adult&#39;s<br/>
right to cause<br/>
| the child pain.<br/>
|<br/>
| Are we about at the stage where the list moderator should<br/>
consider this<br/>
| intentional disruption of the list&#39;s purpose with appropriate<br/>
action, or am<br/>
| I over-reactive?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-362641452">Absolutely it is real - and will get the same injured howls of<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant&quot; that Myranda has been posting.<br/>
<br/>
If you Google &quot;ethics double effect&quot; you get this as the first<br/>
result - there may be better ones further down, but this is good<br/>
enough and demonstrates how easy it is to find real word<br/>
meanings:<br/>
<br/>
The Doctrine of Double Effect<br/>
This doctrine says that if doing something morally good has a<br/>
morally bad side-effect it&#39;s ethically OK to do it providing the<br/>
bad side-effect wasn&#39;t intended. This is true even if you foresaw<br/>
that the bad effect would probably happen.<br/>
<br/>
The principle is used to justify the case where a doctor gives<br/>
drugs to a patient to relieve distressing symptoms even though he<br/>
knows doing this may shorten the patient&#39;s life.<br/>
... .<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Feelings&quot; about rights were not part of my comments - I was<br/>
commenting on the absolutism of the statement that a child&#39;s<br/>
right not to be hurt is at least as great as the adult&#39;s right to<br/>
hurt.  Here is the statement that I was discussing::<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What has been said, repeatedly, patiently, and obviously<br/>
uselessly, is that a child&#39;s right to living without pain<br/>
supercedes an adult&#39;s right to cause the child pain.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now consider a child who needs chemotherapy to survive cancer - a<br/>
painful and miserable experience for most kids.  Pain is not the<br/>
intended effect - cure is.  Pain is an unavoidable consequence -<br/>
at least for some.<br/>
<br/>
The point is not that I understood anyone to be talking about<br/>
chemotherapy, but that the blanket, &quot;listen to what I mean, not<br/>
what I am saying&quot; is not valid for either side of a meaningful<br/>
discussion.<br/>
