<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312557743">Re: The question on who has good penmanship,,,,,,I&#39;m in the camp with those<br/>
who have good penmasship.  I enjoy writing and the written word.  And also<br/>
do calligraphy as a hobby.  I get compliments on my handwriting<br/>
frequently...ususally by people who *wish*  they had nice penmanship.<br/>
Guess it&#39;s a talent,  and learned (practiced) skill....so for those who love<br/>
it great,  and for others,  as long as people can understand your<br/>
communications, it doesn&#39;t matter.   Hopefully,  we can all appreciate each<br/>
other&#39;s varying talents...i.e.,  people who dont draw or paint well still<br/>
admire Monets,  Renoirs,  etc.<br/>

RE:  The gifted label..........<br/>
I, too,  was good at *school*  as a child - skipped a grade in grade school,<br/>
read way above my grade level.  Our school didnn&#39;t have a gifted program,<br/>
so we were called &quot;brains&quot; (derogatory) by other students.<br/>
Thankfully,  college was generally more of an unschooling experience.  And<br/>
by the time I was finished getting academic awards there....I had also<br/>
gained the self knowledge to know I needed to learn &#39;everyday living&#39;<br/>
skills;  and I had gained the courage to tell my professor that I would not<br/>
be going on to graduate school right away. (he was disappointed,  but I&#39;m<br/>
convinced I would&#39;ve become an *educated dimwit*)  I think I&#39;ve managed to<br/>
gain much more balance between *common sense*  and intelligence.  I&#39;ve also<br/>
gained an appreciation for intelligence....I don&#39;t think I&#39;m superior in<br/>
anyway (in fact I often feel inferior to those with high emotional<br/>
intelligence or &quot;people smarts&quot;)....but I hope I can use the<br/>
intelligence/talents I do have to serve others.<br/>
<br/>
Just my $ 0.02!!<br/>
