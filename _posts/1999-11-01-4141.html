<div id="ygrps-yiv-187738111">Just a few weeks ago, a bright young 18 year old girl from our community<br/>
suffered a severe spinal injury which is expected to leave her permanently<br/>
paralyzed from the waist down.<br/>
<br/>
This accident occurred while she was away at a college where she had entered<br/>
as a freshman just last August.  Luckily, she had been wise enough to<br/>
purchase the medical insurance policy available to students through the<br/>
college.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, she has already almost maxed out her benefits.  She will need<br/>
continuing treatment for many months and years to come.  In addition, her<br/>
parents and younger brother must now move out of the house they were renting<br/>
into another house which will be more suitable for their handicapped<br/>
daughter.  The new house will need to be fitted with a variety of items just<br/>
to allow this daughter to function on a daily basis.  Such adaptations will<br/>
easily add up to tens of thousands of dollars of additional expense.<br/>
<br/>
Friends of the family have already started an effort to raise funds to help<br/>
this family meet these anticipated gigantic financial obligations.<br/>
<br/>
This is just another example of how getting sick or injured in the United<br/>
States can not only devastate your health, but your finances as well.  Hey,<br/>
I won&#39;t argue that it&#39;s a great country to live in as long as you&#39;re young,<br/>
healthy, and have adequate coverage.  It&#39;s just when one or more of those<br/>
factors changes that things can get precarious.  Some time ago, I learned<br/>
that the<br/>
United States and South Africa are the only two major industrialized<br/>
countries<br/>
which don&#39;t provide universal medical coverage for all of their citizens.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that around the turn of this century, fire protection in this<br/>
country was available only to those who purchased it through private<br/>
insurance.  Along came some people who started saying that it would be in<br/>
the best interest of the community for fire protection to be universal.  No<br/>
doubt, those vested in the existing system opposed this proposed change.<br/>
Perhaps they argued that public fire departments were socialist, and ran<br/>
against the<br/>
grain of so-called American &quot;rugged individualism.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But those proposing public fire departments prevailed.  Today, few if anyone<br/>
questions the value of and need for public fire departments.  In fact, many<br/>
self-styled &quot;rugged individualists&quot; would even agree that fire protection is<br/>
one<br/>
of those things which promotes a feeling of security and well-being in a<br/>
community.<br/>

P.S.  This reminds me of a poem I&#39;ve enjoyed for many years:<br/>
<br/>
A Fence or an Ambulance<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Twas a dangerous cliff, as they freely confessed,<br/>
Though to walk near its crest was so pleasant;<br/>
But over its terrible edge there had slipped<br/>
A duke and full many a peasant.<br/>
So the people said something would have to be done,<br/>
But their projects did not at all tally;<br/>
Some said, &quot;Put a fence &#39;round the edge of the cliff,&quot;<br/>
Some, &quot;An ambulance down in the valley.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But the cry for the ambulance carried the day,<br/>
For it spread through the neighboring city;<br/>
A fence may be useful or not, it is true,<br/>
But each heart became full of pity<br/>
For those who slipped over the dangerous cliff;<br/>
And the dwellers in highway and alley<br/>
Gave pounds and gave pence, not to put up a fence,<br/>
But an ambulance down in the valley.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For the cliff is all right, if your careful,&quot; they said,<br/>
&quot;And, if folks even slip and are dropping,<br/>
It isn&#39;t the slipping that hurts them so much<br/>
As the shock down below when they&#39;re stopping.&quot;<br/>
So day after day, as these mishaps occurred,<br/>
Quick forth would those rescuers sally<br/>
To pick up the victims who fell off the cliff,<br/>
With their ambulance down in the valley.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then an old sage remarked: &quot;It&#39;s a marvel to me<br/>
That people give far more attention<br/>
To repairing results than to stopping the cause,<br/>
When they&#39;d much better aim at prevention.<br/>
Let us stop at its source all this mischief,&quot; cried he,<br/>
&quot;Come, neighbors and friends, let us rally;<br/>
If the cliff we will fence, we might almost dispense<br/>
With the ambulance down in the valley.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh he&#39;s a fanatic,&quot; the others rejoined,<br/>
&quot;Dispense with the ambulance? Never!<br/>
He&#39;d dispense with all charities, too, if he could;<br/>
No! No! We&#39;ll support them forever.<br/>
Aren&#39;t we picking up folks just as fast as they fall?<br/>
And shall this man dictate to us? Shall he?<br/>
Why should people of sense stop to put up a fence,<br/>
While the ambulance works in the valley?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But the sensible few, who are practical too,<br/>
Will not bear with such nonsense much longer;<br/>
They believe that prevention is better than cure,<br/>
And their party will soon be the stronger.<br/>
Encourage them then, with your purse, voice, and pen,<br/>
And while other philanthropists dally,<br/>
They will scorn all pretense, and put up a stout fence<br/>
On the cliff that hangs over the valley.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Better guide well the young than reclaim them when old,<br/>
For the voice of true wisdom is calling.<br/>
&quot;To rescue the fallen is good, but &#39;tis best<br/>
To prevent other people from falling.&quot;<br/>
Better close up the source of temptation and crime<br/>
Than deliver from dungeon or galley;<br/>
Better put a strong fence &#39;round the top of the cliff<br/>
Than an ambulance down in the valley.<br/>
<br/>
