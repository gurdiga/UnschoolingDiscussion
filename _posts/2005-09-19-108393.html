<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109946029">Just in case anyone doesn&#39;t know about this: On July 9 at the National Zoo  <br/>
in Washington DC, a male panda was born. It&#39;s still not on display at the zoo,  <br/>
but they have a panda cam so you can see Mei Xiang and her baby. It&#39;s very <br/>
cool!  I&#39;ve been watching them for a while, and she is a VERY good mama.<br/>
