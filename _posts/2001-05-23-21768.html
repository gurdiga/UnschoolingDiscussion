<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154267467">Hi,<br/>
  I think that the cousin who quit school  sounds like an unschooler.  I<br/>
would advise him not to take the GED, but if he already has, disregard it.<br/>
In Friendship,<br/>
Part American Indian Wendy- who likes to learn from and remember the past, ,<br/>
but doesn&#39;t think it is beneficial or respectful to pity a strong people or<br/>
to be hateful on their behalf. Lots of Indian culture survives, and many<br/>
people are drawn to it. There are even people in Europe who love and embrace<br/>
it-probably other places around the globe as well.</div>
