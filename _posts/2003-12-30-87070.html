<div id="ygrps-yiv-330291646">**I don&#39;t think unschoolers are preparing their kids for employment. We&#39;re<br/>
more interested in helping our kids be who they are. Funny thing is, the<br/>
kids who really *are* who they are end up being quite employable.**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not preparing my kids to make a living, I&#39;m preparing them to make a <br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, it&#39;s got problems, they&#39;re already making a life not just preparing for <br/>
one, but still, it&#39;s catchy, no?   :-)<br/>
