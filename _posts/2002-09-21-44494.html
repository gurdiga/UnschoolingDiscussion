<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777827195">&lt;The most important rule of life is never never never never, no never never<br/>
never never<br/>
no never<br/>
no never<br/>
no never leave your wallet on the roof of your car.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a long time since I logged on and read here. I had a wallet stollen<br/>
1 month ago from my unlocked car. Today it was hot, baby T 2.5years threw a<br/>
fit. I brought her shoes with us. Such a terrible mom I am. Well then son 5.5<br/>
was a little wild after homeschool tennis group and wanted to race 4 other<br/>
kids in the parking lot. We are at the high school in town. Not a runable<br/>
parking lot. So I have a new wallet, two kids going a zillion directions and I<br/>
just don&#39;t know what I did with the fine black leather which houses my<br/>
identity and ice cream money. At 3pm I tear the car apart wondering where it<br/>
is. I want to take the kids for ice cream at 4pm. We drive to swim practice,<br/>
the two little one&#39;s and I cool off in the local fountain. All the while I&#39;m<br/>
wondering, did I leave that wallet on top of the car?<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t. Turns out baby T secured my wallet with Bitty baby in her back pack.<br/>
I sure am glad I didn&#39;t leave my wallet on the roof of my car.<br/>
<br/>
We ate sundaes, shopped for birthday gifts, had pizza, and I never never never<br/>
am going to lose this wallet, again.<br/>
