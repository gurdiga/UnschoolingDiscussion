 </span></blockquote>Elizabeth! Well, first here&#39;s a big hug and I&#39;m handing you a nice cuppa tea.<br/>
How are the kids doing? Was it difficult finding a nanny on such short notice?<br/>
My kids often joke that I can&#39;t break my leg because then they&#39;d have to eat<br/>
what their dad cooks. Can we send you some cookies or how about a book or two,<br/>
I sell OOP children&#39;s and young adult books so I have extras sitting about.<br/>
Have an old favorite you&#39;d like to read again now that you&#39;ve got some time?<br/>
Email me and I&#39;ll find you something. I love revisiting old favorites but<br/>
rarely have the time to read them.<br/>

Get a walker at first, maybe, if your leg isn&#39;t all straight out and too long.<br/>
I got a walker without wheels, because I was so afraid of falling again <br/>
before this heals. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really, really sorry to hear you&#39;re hurt.<br/>
Yikes.  Yours sounds way WAY worse than mine.  <br/>

Best bet on crutches: don&#39;t use them.  They hurt your arms and underneath<br/>
your arms.  I hate them!  But it did help me to remember to lotion the place<br/>
they rub a lot; that way I didn&#39;t hurt so much.<br/>

I think I may have mentioned this earlier in an email, but as soon as my <br/>

me two folks to interview by Thursday.  We made the decision then.  I guess <br/>
with the economy, many nannies have been displaced.  She&#39;s high energy and <br/>
has worked with invalid adults, so she&#39;ll be multi-tasking.  It&#39;s very <br/>
difficult for me to have someone else watch my children, but I&#39;m just in the <br/>
living room and will see them throughout the day.  we&#39;ve learned to do a <br/>
double snuggle in the hospital bed we&#39;ve set up and have read &quot;Shoo Fly don&#39;t <br/>

I think maybe wriggling is intranstive.  Worms do it.<br/>
<br/>
Wiggling is transitive.  You do it to something else.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or else they&#39;re just different spellings, like plough and plow and colour and <br/>
color.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146890018">Don&#39;t know if this will help you, but my mom&#39;s physiotherapist told her that crutches work best when adjusted so that you DON&#39;T rest your under-arm on them at all, but instead carry your weight by using only your hands on the hand-grips, and your arms to keep the crutches against your side. Took her a little longer to master this, but it worked really well for her.<br/>

If you want to give a homeopathic remedy a try, arnica works great <br/>
for bruises. You can get it as little tiny sugar pellets that you let <br/>
dissolve under your tongue and as cream that you rub where you&#39;re <br/>
bruised. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-48858137">Hi,<br/>
Don&#39;t put the crutches right at your armpits.  Instead, place them a little <br/>
lower (about the top of your breasts).  Angle them when walking or standing <br/>
so that your full body weight is evenly distributed (or else your wrists and <br/>
lower arms will get sore.)  I learned this from a college roommate with <br/>
cerebral palsy who used crutches.   You might also be able to apply for a <br/>
handicapped tag for your cars and be able to use the closer parking spots <br/>
(doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re not the driver, just as long as you&#39;re in the car.<br/>
