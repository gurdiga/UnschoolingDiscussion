<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441609660">I&#39;ve been lurking for a while, but thought I might introduce myself<br/>
and ask a question sparked by a recent post. My name is Tarasine<br/>
(pronounced &#39;tara-seena&#39;), and although my son is only 8 months old, I<br/>
have been thinking about and researching homeschooling/unschooling for<br/>
about 5 years now. Both my husband and I have really connected with<br/>
the idea of unschooling, since it is easy to see that it is the way WE<br/>
have been learning &quot;what we need to know&quot; our entire lives. I want my<br/>
children to have time/space/freedom to learn this way from the very<br/>
beginning, so I am extremely grateful to have come across so many<br/>
fabulous resources about unschooling as well as real-life unschoolers<br/>
before sending them to school was ever an issue.<br/>
<br/>
So, here&#39;s my question. Recently, Sandra wrote: <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And that maybe since everybody&#39;s looking I might be tempted to<br/>
compromise my beliefs and offer Kirby $1000 to enroll in college,<br/>
PLEASE!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just curious to know how college fits into the unschooling<br/>
philosophy in general and in the actual lives of your children. I<br/>
mean, I realize that an unschooling parent wouldn&#39;t coerce/push/bribe<br/>
(as in Sandra&#39;s humorous example) a child to attend college, or even<br/>
assume that college is a given for their child. But do children who<br/>
have been unschooled feel a need or desire for college? Do those who<br/>
decide on college need to do some preparation to &quot;get them ready&quot; for<br/>
the schoolish way of doing things (e.g. exams, papers, lectures,<br/>
etc.)? What has been your experience?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

As for college, mine are a few years from that, but if they want to go, I <br/>
will do everything I can to help them. If not, fine. My goals for my kids are <br/>
that when they grow up they are happy, healthy, and in love with their lives. <br/>
But those are my goals for my kids today as well. There are colleges all <br/>
across the country and internationally, that are becoming more and more <br/>
acceptable to homeschoolers, some are even actively recruiting homeschoolers. <br/>
I think colleges are interested in the *alternatively educated* A friend of <br/>
mine over at KU says that the admissions office looks at all the same old <br/>
same old day after day. She thinks that an unschooler will have just the <br/>
same, if not better chance at securing a good college admission. And as for <br/>
what is required to get into a college, that differs from college to college, <br/>
but most require an SAT or ACT score and transcripts, if needed, are easily <br/>
made as is a high school diploma. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome Tarasine. Nice name but I have reason to say so. My oldest <br/>
daughter&#39;s name is Tara and one set of her very Italian grandparents called <br/>
her from a baby, Tarasine. You have to put in the Italian accent though. It <br/>
was term of endearment for her and it still sticks today. So welcome.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if I qualify to answer this but I can only go by what I&#39;ve seen <br/>
and heard. My little ones know that college is an option and not a <br/>
prerequisite to life beyond the teen years. My oldest that attends school <br/>
knows the same thing. Sierra (6)has already decided that she wants to start <br/>
college at 16 and not wait until she&#39;s older. But then again she says she&#39;s <br/>
never moving from home either!!! All subject to change.<br/>
<br/>
The homeschoolers I know of have gone to some kind of college whether it was <br/>
dual enrollment at 16, community college at 18 or a University. Haven&#39;t <br/>
really kept up with who finished or not and what they did with it. I know of <br/>
3 that haven&#39;t gone on to school. Two of those 3 have started their own <br/>
businesses. Some of those kids were unschoolers and when the time came to <br/>
take their SAT&#39;s, they took it upon themselves to learn what they needed. <br/>
They did well and were accepted into all schools that they applied to. Some <br/>
of the children I speak of had diploma&#39;s from on line school programs, some <br/>
had a GED and some had nothing. All I know of took the SAT. Now I also know <br/>
some college&#39;s dont&#39; require an SAT at all. Who knows what the next 10 years <br/>
will show us with what colleges want or expect?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733922305">GREETINGS - YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED THIS - <br/>
WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE<br/>
IT<br/>
MEANS THE NEWS IS SPREADING, BUT SORRY FOR <br/>
REPETITION  - PLEASE  RESPOND<br/>
-<br/>
PETITIONS AREN&#39;T THE BEST PROTEST BUT THIS ONE IS <br/>
GATHERING MOMENTUM AND<br/>
MIGHT MAKE THAT DIFFERENCE<br/>
-<br/>
Subject: Fw: Stop Amina Lawal being stoned - forwarded email from<br/>
Amnesty.<br/>
<br/>
Dear All,<br/>
As many of you may have heard, a Nigerian woman was recently <br/>
sentenced<br/>
to<br/>
death- for having a baby out of wedlock. Amina Lawal has been <br/>
sentenced<br/>
to<br/>
death by STONING- she is to buried up to her neck in the ground, <br/>
after<br/>
which<br/>
her punishers will surround her and throw rocks at her head until her<br/>
skull<br/>
is crushed and she dies a painful and horrible death.<br/>
I&#39;m sure you all feel equal shock and disgust at this sentence, and I<br/>
want<br/>
you to know that she has only thirty days - till her baby is weaned - <br/>
to<br/>
appeal her trial.<br/>
<br/>
Please go to the Amnesty International site, <br/>
www.mertonai.org/amina/ and<br/>
sign the letter<br/>
addressed to the President of Nigeria. It literally takes only a <br/>
minute,<br/>
and<br/>
could help to save her life, as well as help put an end to this kind of<br/>
cruel and disgraceful judgement<br/>
<br/>
Please copy and forward this letter to others in your address book <br/>
as<br/>
well.<br/>
Please help her! Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669951783">Don&#39;t you all think this web site and also Pam S. post Digest Number 2357, regarding her experience with college and unschooling would be great material for those doubting in-laws, friends and such.  I know Pam&#39;s post is going up on my fridge for my ps teaching inlaws to read.<br/>
Also thought I&#39;d mention that my dh is coming around to our thinking, he is now sounding like me(to his dad).  They were eating dinner last night and his father brought up the old socializing thing and dh asked him to think back to his own school days.  I think it really hit a chord with him.  People always jump on the socializing bit when they hear hs.  But I think its because its the only thing they know of to ask.  I love pointing out that all the kids are told that they aren&#39;t supposed to socialize in school.  That my kids get to do more socializing!  I was just so excited to hear my dh be excited about our unschooling!!!<br/>
OK,  now this might be a stupid question but would anyone feel like informing me on some abbreviations?  I&#39;ve been reading posts for many months now and still don&#39;t know what the d stands for in dh, dd, ds, and don&#39;t know alot of other abbreviations.  Thanks to anyone who has the time to explain these to me.<br/>

&lt;&lt; You have a beautiful name! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you! It&#39;s Italian--I was born while my father, then in the Air<br/>
Force, was stationed in Italy. Unfortunately, my parents returned to<br/>
the US when I was still an infant, so I don&#39;t remember any of it.<br/>

<br/>
I agree! This is one of the reasons I have been so attracted to<br/>
unschooling--the idea that teaching my children to find their own<br/>
goals and criteria for success will lead to them becoming much<br/>
happier, healthier people than if *I* have certain goals in mind for<br/>
them. In fact, I&#39;m sure that *I* will be much happier and healthier<br/>
with this kind of attitude, too. I have seen my mother go through a<br/>
lot of frustration and disappointment whenever one of her children<br/>
makes a choice that differs from her &quot;plan.&quot; The thing is, all of us<br/>
are doing GREAT--it&#39;s just that we didn&#39;t necessarily do things<br/>
exactly as she wanted (as if any child ever would).  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There are colleges all across the country and internationally, that<br/>
are becoming more and more acceptable to homeschoolers, some are even<br/>
actively recruiting homeschoolers.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;ve heard this from many sources as well. I guess my question<br/>
was more about how unschoolers would do in the school setting of<br/>
college. I appreciate your response, though!<br/>

I think so, too. Although I only found out about unschooling a couple<br/>
of years ago, I realized that I have always understood it as a<br/>
principle. I have learned many more things outside of school than in it!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s going to be interesting to see what route my kids go...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I, too, have felt such a sense of adventure in becoming a parent! It<br/>
has been so *exciting* to see my son explore, learn, and develop--I<br/>
can&#39;t imagine missing any of it by sending him to school!<br/>

Yes, I&#39;m sure this is possible. When I think about the college<br/>
entrance exams I took myself, it is easy to see how *little* of what<br/>
was tested I actually learned in school classes. When my husband was<br/>
studying for the GRE a while ago, we just had to shake our heads at<br/>
how much those standardized tests are really geared toward *tricking*<br/>
the test-taker. What they REALLY test is how well people can take<br/>
standardized tests.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello Tarasine<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted here in ages (hello everyone) but I logged in just <br/>
now and saw the college topic and had to say something. My daughter <br/>
Laurie was unschooled from birth and at age 18 (out of the blue one <br/>
day) announced that she wanted to go to college. I was shocked to say <br/>
the least. She attended 3.5 years and graduated last December with a <br/>
3.98.. she made one B in her final semester. She loved/loves college <br/>
and has so far taken an additional semester of classes just for <br/>
grins. She plans on going another semester next year. <br/>
The only preparation was registering for and taking the ACT (college <br/>
entrance exam). She had never seen a textbook or taken a test and did <br/>
quite well on the tests. And we were total radical unschoolers. We <br/>
sat down at the table one time during her childhood because <br/>
she &quot;wanted to learn math.&quot; That lasted five minutes and she said she <br/>
knew enough. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve written a book about her life and it goes to the <br/>
printers in a month, so will hopefully be in the stores by Xmas. <br/>
Hopefully I&#39;ll drop in here more often.<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie</div>

which Ren is which, so I&#39;m not going to worry about the Todd&#39;s <br/>
