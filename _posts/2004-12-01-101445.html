<div id="ygrps-yiv-460661387">Deb said, &quot;No one writes unless it&#39;s important to them!  Does he think <br/>
people<br/>
everywhere are sitting down to write for no reason?  What do people <br/>
write<br/>
when they have no reason to write, I wonder?   That&#39;s just silly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now wait a minute!  &lt;g&gt;  I just finished trying to do NaNoWriMo - <br/>
trying to write 50,000 words in the month of November, just because.  <br/>
(I only got to 36934, but I tried - having house guests for more than a <br/>
week and a half didn&#39;t help!)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, maybe it wasn&#39;t for no reason at all - I was trying to get over <br/>
my idea that my writing always has to be right - I thought 50,000 words <br/>
would cure me of that!  Maybe that will come in the next 13,066 words, <br/>
or maybe not at all.  &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And Deb, I do agree with you that it&#39;s silly to expect a kid to write <br/>
for no reason.  Just trying to find an &quot;in&quot; in the conversation to say <br/>
that NaNoWriMo is OVER!  Yeah!  And congratulations to all the <br/>
unschoolers, both young and not so young who participated this year.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and you asked, &quot;What do people write when they have no reason to <br/>
write?&quot;  Well, that was probably the most interesting part of the whole <br/>
thing.  The motto of NaNoWriMo is &quot;No Plot, No Problem&quot;  It is amazing <br/>
what comes out when you don&#39;t know what to write!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241067124">I did it for three years but decided not to this year since I have <br/>
a &quot;real&quot; writing project I have to get done.  I was surprised to find <br/>
bits and pieces in my NaNoWriMo writings that were actually good even <br/>
though I&#39;m not a fiction writer.  I cut and pasted them into a file I <br/>
call &quot;Snippets&quot; and will probably use them some time in other <br/>
things.  I even got an unfinished short story out of one. <br/>
<br/>
I went a couple of weeks ago see the guy who started it.  I can&#39;t <br/>
remember his name but just a wrote a book called No Plot? No <br/>
Problem!  He did say that he was still writing everyday despite being <br/>
on tour.  I think it works better in Nov. for people without kids. :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>November is National Novel Writers Month. There&#39;s an organization called<br/>
NaNoWriMo.org that challenges everyone who has ever thought about writing to<br/>
write a 50,000 word novel in 30 days -- between Nov 1 and midnight Nov 30.<br/>
<br/>
The basic idea is that we&#39;re each our biggest roadblocks to writing. We want<br/>
our writing to be great so we think about it too much and put it off or edit<br/>
too much trying to get something perfect. So the challenge is to just write<br/>
without concern for quality. It&#39;s *quantity* that counts in November, not<br/>
quality. :-)<br/>
<br/>
And by not caring about quality people can produce some pretty good writing<br/>
:-) I remember reading in a book on writing that several authors basically<br/>
do write that way. Their goal is to produce 1000 words a day. And one was<br/>
quoted as saying that some days he produces what feels like great stuff and<br/>
some days he produces what feels like crap but then when he reads it later<br/>
they&#39;re both equally good.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter Kathryn (13) and I participated this year. (And completed it!<br/>
Yeah! :-) Hers is done. Mine is still going. (50,000 is the minimum for a<br/>
published novel.) (I probably couldn&#39;t have done it if Kathryn wasn&#39;t too<br/>
since she was perfectly content to write for several hours a day which gave<br/>
me time to also. And also that we didn&#39;t have visitors for Thanksgiving!)<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;d definitely not say writing for NaNoWriMo is &quot;writing for no reason&quot;!<br/>
It was writing for fun! :-)<br/>
<br/>
===========Here&#39;s a bit of Kathryn&#39;s:<br/>
[Hers takes place in this world she&#39;s developed over many years.]<br/>
<br/>
Bane&#39;s Awakening<br/>
<br/>
Story premise recap thing (just so you get the idea of what&#39;s going on):<br/>
<br/>
Avn Hisky is a pearly pink cat that can walk upright like a human. She lives<br/>
in an enormous gigantic company called Katzah Korp. with her friends, Spot,<br/>
Tiger, Pachiki and her little sister Star. And along with about fifty<br/>
thousand other cats. Katzah Korp. is owned by the never seen Mr. Katzah who<br/>
holds classes where the cats in his company make products. Such as comic<br/>
books and comic strips, origami ornaments for all kinds of occasions,<br/>
pottery and other things he can sell at a high price. Mostly, the cats enjoy<br/>
it in Katzah Korp. but try to get back at Mr. Katzah for various reasons.<br/>
Such as, he is an overly powerful rich moron who thinks he&#39;s better than<br/>
everyone else and likes money. But, Mr. Katzah does like one cat. His name<br/>
is Richard Richmond. He has almost as much money as Mr. Katzah does.<br/>
<br/>
Chapter one: The first chapter of many (well, this isn&#39;t actually a chapter<br/>
so much as it is a devisor between the prologue and the actual story)<br/>
<br/>
Avn woke up to a chilly Autumn morning. She pulled herself out of her bed<br/>
and slid into her fuzzy, warm and brown football slippers. She then went<br/>
over to her closet and pulled on a leopard patterned winter robe. Once she<br/>
was ready, Avn headed down stairs to the enormous Breakfast Hall. (Which was<br/>
also the Lunch and Dinner Hall, but anyway).<br/>
<br/>
Avn stared up at the 54 different things that were on the breakfast menu.<br/>
Cats would give ideas and then usually the food ideas would go on the menu.<br/>
There was a new item on the menu called &quot;Bob and Larry&#39;s seafood chili&quot;. For<br/>
some unknown reason, when new items were added, they were added to all of<br/>
the menus. Maybe it was to see for which meal it was usually ordered, then<br/>
the menu person (whomever that may be) would put it on that menu.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What are you going to get?&quot; asked Avn&#39;s best friend Spot as he walked into<br/>
the Breakfast Hall.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Not &#39;Bob and Larry&#39;s seafood chili&#39;,&quot; Avn replied.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Same with me. But that narrows the choice of breakfast down to fifty<br/>
three,&quot; said Spot.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Exactly. How about Pineapple Fruit Bowl?&quot; asked Avn.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Huh? Never heard of that one. What is it?&quot; Spot asked in return.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s a pineapple cut in half lengthwise with some of the fruit scooped out<br/>
to make sort of a bowl. The fruit that was scooped out is then diced and<br/>
mixed together with grapes and other diced fruits like melons, apples and<br/>
oranges and such and then put inside the pineapple half. It&#39;s really good&quot;<br/>
replied Avn.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sounds yummy! I&#39;ll try it!&quot; Said Spot.<br/>
<br/>
They ordered two Pineapple Fruit Bowls and sat down with their breakfasts at<br/>
one of the many many gray plastic tables in the Breakfast Hall.<br/>
<br/>
Then, two of Avn and Spot&#39;s friends walked into the Breakfast Hall, ordered<br/>
breakfast, came over and sat down with Avn and Spot.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yo peeps! How ya doin&#39;?&quot; said the tiger striped one, whose name was Tiger.<br/>
Tiger believed that martians were going to take over the planet and suck out<br/>
everyone&#39;s souls and eat them on their toast.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re doing good! As long as we don&#39;t eat a bowl of Bob and Larry&#39;s seafood<br/>
chili.&quot; Said Avn.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I hear that!&quot; said Tiger raising his glass of ruby red grapefruit juice.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Attention! Attention!&quot; Boomed a loud, commanding and all too familiar voice<br/>
over the loud speaker. It was the voice of Mr. Katzah. &quot;I have a special<br/>
delivery for anyone who can take care of and wants one! Meet me in the Main<br/>
Hall as soon as you can. I&#39;ll be there or I&#39;ll have someone stationed there<br/>
all day. That is all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I wonder what &#39;It&#39; could be?&quot; Avn mused.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Probably the world&#39;s largest Jolly Rancher. Or a living ball of fluffy pink<br/>
and/or blue cotton candy! Ah, heaven...&quot; sighed Tiger.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Uh, yeah. But, knowing Mr. Katzah, it might just be. Who knows?&quot; said<br/>
Pachiki sipping her Fruit Soup.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s in that stuff anyway? I&#39;ve thought about trying it. Is it good?&quot; Avn<br/>
asked Pachiki, pointing at her Fruit Soup.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Fruit juices and the syrup stuff that&#39;s in the cans of fruit for the broth,<br/>
and chopped up fruit and chopped up canned fruit. It&#39;s sweet, but very<br/>
good,&quot; replied Pachiki.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, once I&#39;m done with my Ham and Cheese Scone, I&#39;m going to go see what<br/>
&#39;It&#39; is! Anyone want to join me?&quot; asked Tiger.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sure! I&#39;ll be done with my breakfast soon too,&quot; said Spot.<br/>
<br/>
========= And a bit of my fantasy titled &quot;Flight&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I will rip his eyeballs out and impale them on a spit and roast them until<br/>
they burst. I will rip his nose off and season it with fire pepper and feed<br/>
it to Tagira. I will rip his lips off and&quot; dark haired Magla chanted into<br/>
the warm wind rushing into her as the massive orange tiger beneath her<br/>
bounded over ragged rocks and scrubby scrouse bushes.<br/>
<br/>
Kaya rode near Magla on the back of a jewel blue dragon, its powerful wings<br/>
thrusting rider and mount just a few hand breadths above the ground. This<br/>
was going downward in more ways than one, Kaya thought and tuned out her<br/>
clanmate. Not that Kaya didn&#39;t agree with the sentiment. She just didn&#39;t<br/>
need to hear it graphically spelled out.<br/>
<br/>
Tagira the tiger, carrying her small, spewing rider, leapt over the<br/>
outcropping and dropped down to the dusty rocky path that led around the<br/>
side of the mountain. Chengdo, Kaya&#39;s dragon, banked gracefully to follow<br/>
Tagira, then abruptly plummeted down the side of the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Cheeennngggdooooo!&quot; Kaya screamed pulling at the emerald green reins<br/>
attached to the ruby red halter. But the dragon was oblivious to external<br/>
commands for spilling out of a split in the side of the mountain was a tam<br/>
bush, laden with fat purple berries. A sinuous twist to face upward and the<br/>
dragon slammed into the rocky cliff, golden claws splayed feeling for tiny<br/>
cracks and miniscule crevices. And her dragon began to feed on the one food<br/>
dragons could never resist. Kaya clung to the neck of the dragon, settling<br/>
her bottom on the backrest of the tooled leather dragon saddle, specially<br/>
designed for this inevitable occurrence. She buried her face in the soft<br/>
blue feathery scales of the dragon&#39;s neck and prepared to wait.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kaaaayaaaa!&quot; Magla called from above.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Down here!&quot; called Kaya. &quot;Chengdo spotted tam berries.&quot; She didn&#39;t need to<br/>
say more. Magla&#39;s deep sigh drifted down to her. &quot;Go on without me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, I can&#39;t. This is an insult to both of us. We must confront the beast of<br/>
a monk together.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which was true. Her fist thudded against the dragon&#39;s neck in frustration<br/>
but the dragon paid no heed to her. She could feel the muscles beneath the<br/>
scales working as the dragon stripped the berries from the bush and worked<br/>
them rhythmically into a pulp with his tongue. Chengdo&#39;s breath rumbled<br/>
deeply in his chest like the purring of a contented cat.<br/>
<br/>
Kaya breathed deeply as she&#39;d been taught, letting go of the air and the<br/>
tension and the desire to control what was uncontrollable. After 50 deep<br/>
slow breaths she felt the dragon&#39;s grip relax. Chengdo pushed himself away<br/>
from the craggy cliff. He thrust out his leathery wings catching huge scoops<br/>
of the late spring air to twist acrobatically around until the two of them<br/>
were hovering above Magla and Tagira.<br/>
<br/>
A gentle nudge from Magla and Tagira twisted as gracefully as Chengdo as<br/>
though the two were adversaries in some fall athletic competition. Tagira<br/>
bounded up the mountain, catching purchase where no earthbound creature<br/>
should be able to go. Chengdo followed easily, now a complementary partner<br/>
in their powerful dance across the mountainous terrain.<br/>
<br/>
The two pairs of riders and mounts reached the peak and paused to look down<br/>
at the rock carved monastery and village of the herding people. The tiger<br/>
stood proudly atop the stone perch as the dragon settled next to him.<br/>
<br/>
After a few moments of deep admiration for the patch of emerald green<br/>
nestled in a rocky bowl of the mountain range, Kaya called, &quot;Find Xan.&quot; The<br/>
tiger&#39;s ears flicked back as it caught the familiar name. Then the tiger and<br/>
dragon locked in a contest to be the first to spot the monk.<br/>
<br/>
The tiger won by an eye blink and bounded down the mountain. The dragon<br/>
launched outward twisting and stretching into a banking circle high over the<br/>
curving patch of vegetation, its golden eyes locked onto the one the friends<br/>
sought. With a gathering of wings, Chengdo dropped like hawk after a rabbit.<br/>
This would be no contest for the dragon could drop through the air faster<br/>
than the tiger could bound down the cliff.<br/>
