<div id="ygrps-yiv-422686097">strangely enough, but your description sounds like how i feel when i am<br/>
attempting to be social.<br/>
<br/>
i think part of it for me is that i feel judged by everyone around me...<br/>
maybe you feel judged by your children (some comments you made sound that<br/>
way.)<br/>
<br/>
maybe if you can think of how i can feel free and secure around people, i<br/>
can think of how you can feel free and secure playing with your kids.<br/>

&gt; &gt; You don&#39;t like general suggestions about changing your thinking?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You don&#39;t like discussion of thinking patterns and priorities?<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not so much that I don&#39;t like generalities, more like I am going in<br/>
&gt; circles and I can&#39;t figure out how to get off the merry go round.<br/>
&gt; Generalities seem to make the merry go round go faster.  I have been<br/>
reading<br/>
&gt; here and nodding and absorbing and thinking, I can do that!  Then one<br/>
thing<br/>
&gt; goes wrong and the next thing you know I&#39;m hiding under the basements<br/>
stairs<br/>
&gt; until I can be calm enough to be in the same room with my kids and feel<br/>
&gt; safe.  A lot of this is trying not to repeat patterns. So I am going to<br/>
try<br/>
&gt; to figure out more specifically what it is I am looking for.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, so I went and read a bunch of the links you sent.  Right now I feel<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; having a great big pity party all by myself.  I want to run and hide.  I<br/>
&gt; feel like the biggest failure in the world.  Now that I have that behind<br/>
me,<br/>
&gt; I need to figure out what to do instead.  Since I had my second child my<br/>
&gt; parenting goals have been very simple.  My very basic goal was to not hit<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; kids. The others all seem like easy to me like providing organic food,<br/>
only<br/>
&gt; using non toxic stuff in my house, read to them, make sure they get to<br/>
call<br/>
&gt; their grandmas often enough to have a clue who they are.<br/>
&gt; That just isn&#39;t enough anymore.  It seems like one of the biggest<br/>
obstacles<br/>
&gt; for me is play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Seems like so many people say to me, just get down and play with them.<br/>
&gt; Follow their lead.  It sounds so easy, and often they are looking me in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; eye like, why is that so hard?  To me, it&#39;s like instant panic.  I want to<br/>
&gt; pull up a corner of the carpet and get under it and hide!  Obviously I am<br/>
&gt; working with some serious leftovers that are effecting my parenting.  I am<br/>
&gt; working really hard on it.  However, I still have these awesome kids that<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; love and desperately want to give a better start.  What do I do in the<br/>
&gt; meantime to cope?  I don&#39;t want to give up.  Like I said before, the<br/>
&gt; afternoon is the hardest, so I make my plans accordingly - no changes<br/>
during<br/>
&gt; those times to stress me more.  Ideally we can either be home then, or<br/>
&gt; somewhere where we can stay put that is low key or contained enough that I<br/>
&gt; am not worried about chasing Crispin down every 5 seconds.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I feel like I am whining.  I don&#39;t want to be whining, but I am just<br/>
&gt; drowning.  I am surrounded by awesome attachment parenting mamas who make<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; look easy.  And they spend all day with their kids!  My husband has mine a<br/>
&gt; lot of the time.  I feel so hopeless about being able to keep them home.<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not willing to give up but I am just aching and sinking.  I am treating my<br/>
&gt; kids very much like I was treated minus the hitting.  It is killing me.  I<br/>
&gt; just don&#39;t know how to interact with them like I think I am supposed to,<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; at least want to.  I was a barely seen *never* heard kid without siblings<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; neighborhood kids that were &#39;acceptable&#39; playmates.  My kids have tons of<br/>
&gt; friends to play with but we have to drive to them - which we do regularly.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s the play with mommy part - sigh.  I just never interacted with anyone<br/>
&gt; that way.  It&#39;s almost like I get scared right away at the thought.  I<br/>
&gt; literally sink in my chair and pull my shirt over my head sometimes.  Has<br/>
&gt; anyone else remotely felt like this?  I feel so guilty like my kids are<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; going to hate me for screwing them up.  I wanted to be a cool mom that my<br/>
&gt; kids really like.  My kids *do* like me, but the nasty little voice in my<br/>
&gt; head says it&#39;s just because they don&#39;t know any different.  Eventually<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; will figure out what they are missing like I did.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This doesn&#39;t have to be so hard!!!  I&#39;ve got books, websites, people.  The<br/>
&gt; answer isn&#39;t there, it&#39;s in me.  I keep asking anyway because I hope that<br/>
&gt; something will turn on a light bulb.<br/>
