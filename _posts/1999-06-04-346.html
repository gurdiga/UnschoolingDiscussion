What ABOUT socialization?<br/>
Two women meet at a playground, where their children<br/>
are swinging and playing ball. The women are sitting<br/>
on a bench watching.   Eventually, they begin to talk.<br/>
W1: Hi. My name is Maggie. My kids are the three<br/>
in red shirts --helps me keep track of them.<br/>
W2: (Smiles) I&#39;m Terri. Mine are in the pink and<br/>
yellow shirts. Do you come here a lot?<br/>
W1: Usually two or three times a week, after we go to<br/>
the library.<br/>
W2: Wow. Where do you find the time?<br/>
W1: We home school, so we do it during the day most of<br/>
the time.<br/>
W2: Some of my neighbors home school, but I send my<br/>
kids to public school.<br/>
W1: How do you do it?<br/>
W2: It&#39;s not easy. I go to all the PTO meetings and<br/>
work with the kids every day after school and stay<br/>
real involved.<br/>
W1: But what about socialization? Aren&#39;t you worried<br/>
about them being cooped up all day with kids their own<br/>
ages, never getting the opportunity for natural<br/>
relationships?<br/>
W2: Well, yes. But I work hard to balance that. They<br/>
have some friends who&#39;re home schooled, and we visit<br/>
their grandparents almost every month.<br/>
W1: Sounds like you&#39;re a very dedicated mom. But don&#39;t<br/>
you worry about all the opportunities they&#39;re missing<br/>
out on? I mean they&#39;re so isolated from real life --<br/>
how will they know what the world is like -- what<br/>
people do to make a living -- how to get along with<br/>
all different kinds of people?<br/>
W2: Oh, we discussed that at PTO, and we started a<br/>
fund to bring real people into the classrooms. Last<br/>
month, we had a policeman and a doctor come in to talk<br/>
to every class. And next month, we&#39;re having a woman<br/>
from Japan and a man from Kenya come to speak.<br/>
W1: Oh, we met a man from Japan in the grocery store<br/>
the other week, and he got to talking about his<br/>
childhood in Tokyo. My kids were absolutely<br/>
fascinated. We invited him to dinner and got to meet<br/>
his wife and their three children.<br/>
W2: That&#39;s nice. Hmm. Maybe we should plan some<br/>
Japanese food for the lunchroom on Multicultural Day.<br/>
W1: Maybe your Japanese guest could eat with the<br/>
children.<br/>
W2: Oh, no. She&#39;s on a very tight schedule. She has<br/>
two other schools to visit that day. It&#39;s a<br/>
system-wide thing we&#39;re doing.<br/>
W1: Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Well, maybe you&#39;ll meet someone<br/>
interesting in the grocery store sometime and you&#39;ll<br/>
end up having them over for dinner.<br/>
W2: I don&#39;t think so. I never talk to people in the<br/>
store --certainly not people who might not even speak<br/>
my language. What if that Japanese man hadn&#39;t spoken<br/>
English?<br/>
W1: To tell you the truth, I never had time to think<br/>
about it. Before I even saw him, my six-year-old had<br/>
asked him what he was going to do with all the oranges<br/>
he was buying.<br/>
W2: Your child talks to strangers?<br/>
W1: I was right there with him. He knows that as long<br/>
as he&#39;s with me, he can talk to anyone he wishes.<br/>
W2: But you&#39;re developing dangerous habits in him. My<br/>
children never talk to strangers.<br/>
W1: Not even when they&#39;re with you?<br/>
W2: They&#39;re never with me, except at home after<br/>
school. So you see why it&#39;s so important for them to<br/>
understand<br/>
that talking to strangers is a big no-no.<br/>
W1: Yes, I do. But if they were with you, they could<br/>
get to meet interesting people and still be safe.<br/>
They&#39;d get a taste of the real world, in real<br/>
settings. They&#39;d also get a real feel for how to tell<br/>
when a situation is dangerous or suspicious.<br/>
W2: They&#39;ll get that in the third and fifth grades in<br/>
their health courses.<br/>
W1: Well, I can tell you&#39;re a very caring mom. Let me<br/>
give you my number--if you ever want to talk, give me<br/>
call. It was good to meet you.<br/>
