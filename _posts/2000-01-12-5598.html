<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410131102">Hi Melanie,<br/>
It&#39;s good news that you will be coming to the States.  I don&#39;t know all the<br/>
details about starting your own business, but I think there may be different<br/>
laws in different states.<br/>
<br/>
A free resource you can use is the Better Business Bureau, they have a web<br/>
site but I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know the addy.  They can give you specific<br/>
information on how to start a small business, what licenses you might need,<br/>
phone numbers & addresses you might need, etc.  And it&#39;s all free.  I used<br/>
to work for them long ago, they have lots of info about lots of things, they<br/>
don&#39;t just register complaints and/or conduct mediation/arbritration.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck on you move.<br/>
Cindy</div>
