Hi! I just wanted to share something happy, but heartbreaking. <br/>
<br/>
We literally LEAPED into radical unschooling this past October. Before that <br/>
we did school-at-home, but in a very relaxed way. My now 10yos went to school <br/>
for Kindergarten and it was a NIGHTMARE!! My now 13yos went up through 3rd <br/>
grade. Then we pulled them out of school. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday my 10yos and I were cuddling on my bed, just talking about <br/>
everything and he got very quiet. Suddenly he took my hand and said, &quot;Mom, <br/>
there is something I want to tell you.&quot; I said, &quot;Ok, what is it?&quot; He said <br/>
that when we began homeschooling that he HATED it as much as school, but he <br/>
never wanted to tell me because he didn&#39;t want to hurt me. He said he used to <br/>
sit and listen to me teach and hope that I would be finished, but then I&#39;d <br/>
tell him it was time to do something else...It just broke my heart!!! We did <br/>
this for 3 years before I just QUIT!! It hurts me that I made them suffer for <br/>
three years like that!!! <br/>
<br/>
I told him that the truth was, I hated it, too. And I was glad that he told <br/>
me! I told him that I was sorry that I did that to him. He told me that he <br/>
loves his life now and he loves that he can do what he wants - then went on <br/>
to list all the wonderful, real-life things he is doing. <br/>
<br/>
I felt honored and privileged to listen to him speak. I am SOOOOO thankful <br/>
for this message board and for all of your honesty and truth. I wish I could <br/>
take back those three years and all the years before and do it all <br/>
differently. I wish I could have given this kind of life to my two adult <br/>
children (18ds and 21dd). Fortunately, they still live at home and are <br/>
experiencing this unschooling life with us. What my 10ds said to me just <br/>
reinforces how RIGHT this is and we will look forward from here. <br/>
<br/>
We LOVE our lives right now! Each day is truly and adventure and a place of <br/>
peace and security for my children now. <br/>
<br/>
I hope that those who are new to this board will read everything here with an <br/>
open heart and mind; do not pass judgement without thinking about WHY you <br/>
feel the way you do about something said here. I am so very, very thankful <br/>
that I listened and thought and read and read and read and thought and <br/>
listened. My whole family has been set free!! Thank you! <br/>
<br/>
God Bless, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-102572089">This is very encouraging.  Thank you for posting it.<br/>
<br/>
I may have posted this already, but recently I had the ole &quot;itch&quot; to do something formal again.  (I guess I just miss &quot;teaching&quot; the kids sometimes LOL).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my daughter who has been begging to go back to school has had a complete change of heart.  She says she LIKES the freedom to do what she wants.  (And no she does NOT want to do math LOL.)  <br/>
<br/>
This is significant for her because prior to this she was very influenced by her peers.  She felt our way of life was inferior.  But now I see her being PROactive.  Instead of second guessing who she is and what she wants, or second guessing our lifestyle, she makes her own decisions and even tries to influence her friends to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
She is coming up with new ideas for things SHE wants to do (like design house plans, something I never would have dreamed she&#39;d be interested in!).  She if finally &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; and realizing she wouldn&#39;t be able to do that if she were in school. <br/>
<br/>
Did I mention that she is now writing a letter to the President and the Governor to discuss freedom for school aged kids?  <br/>
<br/>
Its such a *huge* step of independence for her.   This change in her is more valuable than any &quot;math&quot; could EVER be.<br/>

<br/>
But you&#39;ve given him the gift of perspective at the tender age of 10. <br/>
Lots of people don&#39;t ever realize a good thing when they&#39;ve got it. <br/>
Your son does!<br/>
<br/>
Now I would never recommend hurting or frustrating a child just to <br/>
give them perspective. But I also don&#39;t believe in beating yourself <br/>
up after the fact. Don&#39;t regret any part of your life, learn from it.<br/>
<br/>
Wonderful story, Donna.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
