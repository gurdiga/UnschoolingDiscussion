You&#39;ve now made the difference between &quot;living for society&quot; vs &quot;living real&quot;. <br/>
 Your attitude is to be commended, instead of focusing on the &quot;me&quot;, your <br/>
attitude is focused on &quot;what&#39;s best for my family&quot; and not allowing it to get <br/>
torn/wrecked apart.  Your attorney advised you well.  The more you recognize your <br/>
families strengths, the more you will be able to improve and, to be honest, <br/>
this is how relationships improve.  Each observes and changes as one learns or <br/>
discovers what must be done.  Your reactions are critical at this point.  <br/>
<br/>
The more you continually change on the &quot;inside&quot; (living honestly and real, <br/>
not phony or &quot;for others&quot;), the more changes will be recognized on the <br/>
&quot;outside&quot;.  This attitude/heart change is what will baffle DSS the most, and that&#39;s <br/>
just fine.<br/>
