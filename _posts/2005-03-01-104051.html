<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471017420">Last week we were in Chicago and visited the <br/>
Museum of Science and Industry.  The neatest<br/>
exhibit called Body Worlds was there.  Has anyone<br/>
else seen that(it has travelling exhibits)? <br/>
It was an &quot;anatomical exhibition of real human bodies&quot;.<br/>
It was astounding to us.  Our 7 yo loved it, our 8yo<br/>
hated it(said the bodies smelled) and our 10 yo thought<br/>
it was ok.  I feel compelled to tell people about<br/>
it just because it truly is a unique and incredible<br/>
experience.  I am almost in denial that what I saw <br/>
was really what our bodies look like inside, lol!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for reminding me! After reading a thread about it at <br/>
unschooling.com i decided we should drive to Chicago (which i think <br/>
is only about 4 hours from us)for a road trip to see this exhibit. <br/>
According to the website, the exhibit will be open until Sept 5th, so <br/>
i guess we have plenty of time.<br/>

Keith and I saw it in Los Angeles, at Pam Sorooshian&#39;s urging.<br/>
This was discussed at unschooling.com not long ago.<br/>
So was saving money for college, I think. &lt;g&gt;  I know I just  told that whole <br/>
story about savings bonds somewhere....<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I grew up in Chicago (Winnetka, actually) and *loved* that museum.  I <br/>
was always fascinated by the cross sections of real human bodies--they <br/>
were hanging in a staircase as I recall.  After the L&L conference I <br/>
plan to take my kids up to Chicago and show them some of my old <br/>
haunts--there&#39;s an incredible pancake house there!  My house is gone <br/>
now.  My parents bought it in 1979 for about 110k, sold it in 1996 for <br/>
360k, and those people sold it again in 2002 for 650k!  Then they tore <br/>
it down and built a new house on the little lot.  I&#39;m very curious to <br/>
see what my reaction will be when I go by my old schools.  I haven&#39;t <br/>
been back there since I have done all this deschooling and thinking <br/>
about my own school experiences.  Ha--there&#39;s nothing like one of the <br/>
best public school systems in the country to make someone hate school!  <br/>
Except maybe one of the worst, which is what my husband experienced. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the Muesum of Science and Industry is #1 on our list--my then <br/>
5yo will love it!<br/>
<br/>
 Anyone else going to Chicago after the conference?<br/>

I don&#39;t know what that was, but this Body Worlds thing is a new  technology <br/>
called &quot;plastination&quot;, and the display is there for the first  time. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593485964">Hi Jenny,<br/>
My dd and I are going to Chicago before the conference so we can spend one<br/>
day at American Girl Place (dd has been wanting to do this for years).  We<br/>
will spend a few days there before heading to visit friends in Indiana and<br/>
then on to the conference.  We are really looking forward to it!  We are<br/>
flying in from Oregon to Chicago and then flying back from St. Louis.<br/>

we saw Rod Stewart visiting the museum, which was the coolest part <br/>
for ME :-)  But, yeah, the rest of the musuem was great, too.<br/>

<br/>
Winnetka&#39;s high school is in the news today. I know at least one mom who is <br/>
unschooling now because the pressure on kids to excell starts in kindergarten <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At New Trier Township High School, well-known for super-achievers, some <br/>
students start an hour early, eager to squeeze in an extra class among trumpet <br/>
lessons, Japanese and zoology. Snacking on the run, they can take a staggering <br/>
nine classes a day.<br/>
<br/>
But in a move to get students to slow down and enjoy life, a school committee <br/>
has proposed a controversial change: a mandatory lunch period.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s part of a wide-ranging plan that encourages hard-charging students to <br/>
focus on finding subjects that interest them instead of ones that might interest <br/>
Harvard or Yale. The objective, officials say, is to replace a culture that <br/>
emphasizes overachieving with one that discourages overscheduling.&quot;<br/>
