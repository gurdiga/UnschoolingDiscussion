Teenagers, Friends and Bad Decisions<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;To test how the presence of peers influences risk taking, the researchers<br/>
asked 14 young teenagers (ages 14 to 18), 14 college students and 12 young<br/>
adults to play a six-minute video driving game while in a brain scanner.<br/>
Participants were given cash prizes for completing the game in a certain<br/>
time, but players had to make decisions about stopping at yellow lights, and<br/>
being delayed, or racing through yellow lights, which could result in a<br/>
faster time and a bigger prize, but also meant a higher risk for crashing<br/>
and an even longer delay. The children and adults played four rounds of the<br/>
game while undergoing the brain scan. Half the time they played alone, and<br/>
half the time they were told that two same-sex friends who had accompanied<br/>
them to the study were watching the play in the next room.<br/>
<br/>
Among adults and college students, there were no meaningful differences in<br/>
risk taking, regardless of  whether friends were watching. But the young<br/>
teenagers ran about 40 percent more yellow lights and had 60 percent more<br/>
crashes when they knew their friends were watching. And notably, the regions<br/>
of the brain associated with reward showed greater activity when they were<br/>
playing in view of their friends. It was as if the presence of friends, even<br/>
in the next room, prompted the brain�s reward system to drown out any<br/>
warning signals about risk, tipping the balance toward the reward.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There wasn&#39;t any risk of bodily harm. It was a game. It seems fairly  <br/>
common in adults to confuse reality and simulated reality and not be  <br/>
able to tell the difference. I wonder if they&#39;ve done studies on the  <br/>
phenomenon? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But, also, 14-18 are the social years. It&#39;s when kids often get big  <br/>
time into chatting with others in every way possible.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Dr. Steinberg notes that the brain system involved in reward  <br/>
&gt; processing is also involved in the processing of social information,  <br/>
&gt; explaining why peers can have such a pronounced effect on decision  <br/>
&gt; making. The effect is believed to be especially strong in teenagers  <br/>
&gt; because brain changes shortly after puberty appear to make young  <br/>
&gt; people more attentive and aware of what other people are thinking  <br/>
&gt; about them, Dr. Steinberg said.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m betting it&#39;s a more subtle &quot;the sum is stronger and more powerful  <br/>
and funner than each individual.&quot; ;-) It&#39;s a human phenomenon but for  <br/>
teens it&#39;s something they&#39;re first experiencing. I remember feeling  <br/>
charged up in a group as a teen. They do get goofy and silly. I&#39;ve  <br/>
seen it in Kathryn. There&#39;s definitely a chemistry thing going on.<br/>
<br/>
Out in the schooled world, there&#39;s also the factor that from the first  <br/>
day that mom abandons the child to school that peers become sort of a  <br/>
substitute family. So, depending how disconnected kids feel from their  <br/>
families, how dependent they feel on their peers as being a substitute  <br/>
for a family&#39;s unconditional love, it could ramp up what&#39;s already  <br/>
there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411136173">I figured the university students would be more likely to change their behaviour <br/>
if they were being watched by someone who they found attractive. My nephew was <br/>
involved in a very, very ad hoc &quot;made for Australian television&quot; study about <br/>
young men&#39;s  behavioural response to the presence of an attractive woman <br/>
research assistant. They were way more risk taking in her presence than they <br/>
were in front of a young man research assistant. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
David&#39;s response was I bet they get Laurence Steinberg in on it, and boom, next <br/>
paragraph, there he was. It&#39;s his shtick, the idea that the adolescent brain is <br/>
an immature brain that isn&#39;t really making appropriate decisions. I&#39;m guessing <br/>
that the kind of coalition forming that these researchers are finding is <br/>
absolutely important for an adolescent. And I think Joyce is right, it&#39;s really <br/>
important for a school kid, these are a kind of family who can cut you out of <br/>
the will at any moment. They are absolutely essential for your social standing. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the teenagers&#39; friends were closer friends than the other folks&#39; friends? <br/>
Maybe they do more together and so it was more exciting just the idea that they <br/>
were watching? My high school friendships were more intense and more important <br/>
than at any other time in my life. I love the idea that the thrill of hanging <br/>
out with your friends is being looked at and written up in the same kind of way <br/>
that addiction is looked at: the reward pathways of the brain light up more. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of stuff is about making people feel better. If you can <br/>
demonstrate that children, good children, go astray because their brains are <br/>
immature than you can feel justified in lots and lots of decisions that limit <br/>
their access to whatever it is that their immature brains can&#39;t handle. By <br/>
making it biological folks can figure that their isn&#39;t anything environmental at <br/>
play. Usually that&#39;s wrong. Usually biology and environment work in tandem. But <br/>
if a study of 40 people for whom we know nothing about the selection process <br/>
demonstrates that there is a difference in reward function between adolescents <br/>
and young adults and adults, well.... <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think the interesting thing would be exploring what gains there are to <br/>
coalition formation in adolescence. It makes me want to go look at the group <br/>
stuff that Eric Smith and Bruce Winterhalder did and may still be doing. And to <br/>
look at why there is a declining rate at which same sex coalitions are important <br/>
as we age. <br/>

-----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
David and I took the dog for a walk and talked about why would someone move <br/>
toward risky behaviour in an attempt to keep their friends. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I walk past a school when school has just let out, or we drive past <br/>
schoolchildren on their way to school and being with a friend is absolutely <br/>
pivotal. A group of friends is better than one, but one is so many degrees <br/>
better than no other friends. I was on a university campus a few weeks ago and <br/>
it was nothing like that. Folks walked alone or with someone else without much <br/>
regard. There is something about middle school and high school that makes the <br/>
solo child a target. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why would you risk your life to keep a friend? Because your life isn&#39;t worth <br/>
living without a friend. Or because you think that the risks are so great if you <br/>
don&#39;t have a friend that you won&#39;t survive. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would be worth it to the researchers to examine what in their <br/>
environment made these teenagers so willing to put their virtual lives in <br/>
jeopardy that wasn&#39;t still in the environment for the older folks rather than <br/>
just assuming that there is an adaptation that humans have that makes them more <br/>
likely to die when they are between the ages of 12 and 20. <br/>

Abstract: Relations between nonrelative child care (birth to 4 1/2 years) and <br/>
functioning at age 15 were examined (N = 1,364). Both quality and quantity of <br/>
child care were linked to adolescent functioning. Effects were similar in size <br/>
as those observed at younger ages. Higher quality care predicted higher <br/>
cognitive-academic achievement at age 15, with escalating positive effects at <br/>
higher levels of quality. The association between quality and achievement was <br/>
mediated, in part, by earlier child-care effects on achievement. High-quality <br/>
early child care also predicted youth reports of less externalizing behavior. <br/>
More hours of nonrelative care predicted greater risk taking and impulsivity at <br/>
age 15, relations that were partially mediated by earlier child-care effects on <br/>
externalizing behaviors.<br/>

genetics were &quot;experimenting&quot; with the pros and cons of social groups  <br/>
and going it alone. We&#39;ve got these biological pulls going both ways.  <br/>
When we&#39;re secure, we can relax and be loners if we wish. But when we  <br/>
aren&#39;t, being part of a group can feel safer.<br/>

<br/>
It was the relative difference. Without peers watching and with peers watching <br/>
there was a significant difference only between the teens. They were willing to <br/>
risk their virtual lives more with peers watching whereas there was no real <br/>
difference between adults with or without peers watching or university students <br/>
with or without peers watching. It may not be a particularly refined assessment <br/>
of risk, but you are right, they probably can&#39;t get them to take actual risks <br/>
only the virtual ones. <br/>

<br/>
Women who don&#39;t breastfeed don&#39;t have the same hormonal change that <br/>
breastfeeding mothers have. I&#39;m guessing that miscarriage really does have a <br/>
different hormonal profile. I don&#39;t know if there has been anything about risk <br/>
avoidance and motherhood. I remember stuff about motherhood changing behaviour <br/>
of teens mothers, making them more responsible. <br/>

Thats what I was thinking too, but when I looked at the comments at the end of the article, where someone else made that claim, the author responded that:<br/>
--****&quot;FROM TPP  The negative consequence of driving recklessly in the study was to be delayed and lose prize money. In other studies, when the kids weren&#39;t in the M.R.I. scanner and had friends with them, the effect was even more pronounced.&quot;*****(7th comment down, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/teenagers-friends-and-bad-decisions/?src=me&ref=general)">http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/teenagers-friends-and-bad-decisions/?src=me&ref=general)</a><br/>
<br/>
It is really important for me to remember when I read stuff like this how I felt reading &quot;Nurture Shock&quot; and the &quot;Hold Your Kids Tight&quot; books.  I&#39;m not afraid of my daughter&#39;s attachment becoming stronger to her peers than it is to her dad and me. That primary attachment is protected, primarily, by us not sending her off to be on her own for 30+ hours a week.<br/>
<br/>
In &quot;Nurture Shock&quot; I felt angrier and angrier the farther I read because the authors never once seriously looked at SCHOOLING, that what is expected in and created by schools as the origin of all the problems faced by the kids they talk about. School was the elephant in the room. All these messed up kids wouldn&#39;t be messed up at all if they weren&#39;t in school, if they were treasured for their authentic selves, supported in their desires, had their needs met lovingly.<br/>
<br/>
Dangerous thrill seeking seems to hold some promise of autonomy--but if your self-hood is already secure, if your life--and the hours you spend living it--pass for the most part on your own terms, the need to make a (questionable) point about &quot;freedom&quot; fades away.<br/>

The way I see it, when a child is a baby, befriending a child from<br/>
infancy lights up a lot of pathways and makes tons of sweet bonding<br/>
connections. As the child gets older, it&#39;s the same thing. For a<br/>
parent (and other important people in the child&#39;s life but mainly the<br/>
parents for a long time) to keep up the friendship keeps the child&#39;s<br/>

years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-76351086">The study folks linked it to real risk. They talked about the greater risk of <br/>
accident when a teenage driver has peers in the car with them . I don&#39;t know if <br/>
it was done systematically in the paper with citations demonstrating the <br/>
increased real world risk. Of course that finding may be skewed simply because, <br/>
as David is pointing out to me, any teenager with a car is more likely to have <br/>
friends in the car with them than an adult driver is. That would make a teen <br/>
driver much more at risk of having a peer in the car with them when they had an <br/>
accident than an older person. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The argument that an age class is more likely to take risks as a part of a <br/>
developmentally normal pathway is a big statement. The statement isn&#39;t being <br/>
questioned by Tara Parker-Pope in her article. She&#39;s accepting the idea that <br/>
teens are risk taking with their peers because that&#39;s just the way their brains <br/>
are wired. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a fair exploration of this groups findings. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All of the players in the game, the 14 teens, the 14 university students and the <br/>
12 adults (if I&#39;ve got my numbers right) were all playing the same game. Only <br/>
the teens changed their response to risk in the face of having peers watching. <br/>
Here&#39;s an earlier paper Margo Gardner and Laurence Steinberg wrote without the <br/>
fMRI to explore the specific pathways: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/66byotr.">http://tinyurl.com/66byotr.</a> If anyone is <br/>
interested in the game played or the methods used this one is probably similar <br/>
to the more recent study with the fMRI. In this paper they conclude  with this:<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Thus, interventions aimed at reducing risky behavior among ado-<br/>
lescents and young adults—particularly those from ethnic minority<br/>
groups— ought to focus some attention on increasing individuals’<br/>
resistance to peer influence. For reasons not yet understood, the<br/>
presence of peers makes adolescents and youth, but not adults,<br/>
more likely to take risks and more likely to make risky decisions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the later paper I sent the abstract for Laurence Steinberg, among others, <br/>
found: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;More hours of nonrelative care predicted greater risk taking and impulsivity at <br/>
age 15, relations that were partially mediated by earlier child-care effects on <br/>
externalizing behaviors.&quot;<br/>

It seems that the way to minimise the risk taking behaviour of teens and young <br/>
adults is to have more care by relatives and less time in child-care. <br/>

<br/>
If it&#39;s the way teens are wired, is the idea to restrict their access<br/>
to cars? Put them behind bars until they are older? I&#39;m just reaching.<br/>
<br/>
I was 30+ when I engaged in risky behaviors like smoking, for the<br/>
first time ever, due to peer (and family and other cultural)<br/>
influences. What&#39;s a risky behavior? I&#39;ve quit smoking now but lots of<br/>
people don&#39;t. (Was I a regressed adult still in some special sort of<br/>
adolescence?) I&#39;m not the only one. How about men who engage in road<br/>
rage with the wider group of peers (often other male drivers, but<br/>
sometimes female drivers) that is now the society at large? What is a<br/>
peer, really? How far out of one&#39;s age group do one&#39;s peers quit being<br/>
considered one&#39;s peers? I have colleagues who are 20+ years older than<br/>
me. But then the word &quot;peer&quot; would have a lot more specific meaning if<br/>
I were still in school segregated by age, and that distinction<br/>
disappears as soon as a person steps foot in on a college campus and<br/>
meets quite a few younger and older people engaged in very similar<br/>
things.<br/>

Oh. School. Nevermind then. :)<br/>

It&#39;s not what &quot;friends&quot; meant in the study, and I don&#39;t think we should confuse the terms.   <br/>
Keith&#39;s my husband.  We&#39;re also plenty friendly, but if I introduced him as &quot;this is my friend, Keith,&quot; it would not be clarifying.<br/>

I know these kinds of studies generalize, but sometimes they irritate me in <br/>
their generalizations.  I was not a risk taking teenager.  My oldest daughter is <br/>
to some extent, but she&#39;s more considerate of her actions like I was at her age. <br/>
 Partly that&#39;s genetics and partly that&#39;s environment.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to assume that all or most teens brains are wired a <br/>
certain way.  I totally agree with what Schuyler is saying here!  Some teens are <br/>
risk takers, some teens are risk takers because they are reacting to their <br/>
environment and some are that way because they are genetically that way, and <br/>
there&#39;s a big huge mix in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
The peer environment of schooled kids is soooooo far different than the peer <br/>
environment of unschooled teens that it&#39;s hard to look at a study like this and <br/>
not wonder about that effect.  I wonder about it EVERY time I see some kind of <br/>
statistical study done on children and teens.<br/>

If it&#39;s proven, though, it would no longer be an assumption.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen unschooled teens be reckless in groups.  I&#39;ve seen my own kids and lots of their friends grow into, through, and out of teen years, and have seen them show off for each other, and then get older and be less likely to take risks just to compete for approval within the group.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an assumption that there are stages people go through in their normal human development.  It&#39;s been pretty well established for a long time.   &quot;Most&quot; is most.  Not all.   Some people are lifelong adrenaline-loving stunt men or athletes or race car drivers or sky divers or mountain climbers. They are probably (in general, most of them) more careful as adults than they were as teens.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids are very confident and charismatic, and they probably don&#39;t risk as much as those who are needier of attention.  That wan&#39;t tested, nor does it seem to me it needs to be.  there&#39;s no sense labelling and identifying kids as to their level of social desireability or desire.   Being able to advise kids to be careful, and reminding them that there are realities that have to do with being primates, or realities that pre-date schools.  It&#39;s not all about school.<br/>

<br/>
This is something I&#39;ve talked about off and on with a couple of my male co-workers - how our decision making has shifted away from riskier options as a result of becoming parents. The custodial/non-custodial issue interests me, in particular, because it could shed some light on some of Ray&#39;s bio mom&#39;s earlier behaviors. For several years she had the ability to step away from parenting any time she chose, and during that time she engaged in much riskier behavior than she has since her second child, whom she never perceived the option of handing into another&#39;s care.<br/>
<br/>
I think the social forces also change once you have kids - parents who take more risks aren&#39;t seen in the same kind of positive light as parents who are solid and dependable. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That makes sense - child-care tends to set up situations where one of the most reliable strategies for a child to get attention is by risk-taking or otherwise &quot;disruptive&quot; behavior. Not that it doesn&#39;t happen in homes, too, but there&#39;s more of a chance in a home that a child will get attention for &quot;good&quot; behavior, too. <br/>
<br/>
To tie this in to Sandra&#39;s supposition about parents vs non-parents, parents can get attention and &quot;rewards&quot; from peers for &quot;good behavior&quot; - driving like a maniac, for instance, got one of my former housemates into a lot of trouble with his wife - trouble of the &quot;withholding sex&quot; variety. So he was very directly rewarded for more responsible behavior and punished for irresponsible behavior. <br/>
<br/>
Ray has been learning to drive using friends&#39; cars, as his own needs a lot of work in order to run. His friends don&#39;t tend to encourage reckless driving, though - but they&#39;re also older and own the cars he&#39;s driving, as well as being hippie types who don&#39;t want to come to the attention of police in the local small towns. So Ray is encouraged to drive conservatively.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the advantages of having a peer group that isn&#39;t defined within the fairly narrow confines of school - young people get to share a range of experience and strategies and can focus on different goals. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-678102872">But it isn&#39;t proven. Or at least the controls that they had in place weren&#39;t <br/>
sufficient enough, in my opinion, to prove their hypotheses. One of the controls <br/>
that I think is pivotal is parental care given the findings of the study with <br/>
Laurence Steinberg as 5th author that 15 year olds who had less time in daycare <br/>
and non-relative care were more risk averse. I also think that their hypotheses <br/>
are relatively unclear. I think they found something and then wanted to find it <br/>
again and then slapped on an explanation. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I went looking at my favourite demography, the book on the Ache, a hunter <br/>
gatherer group in Paraguay, to see what their age specific mortality looked <br/>
like. Dr.s Hill and Hurtado were kind enough to include the age specific <br/>
mortality profiles for 3 different populations, the Ache, the Yananomo, and the <br/>
!Kung. The data as presented seems to show that the teen years have a pretty low <br/>
risk of death. That finding is at odds with the idea that folks are more likely <br/>
to die or at least put themselves at risk in the teen years because of some <br/>
developmental stage that humans go through.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, it&#39;s kind of disturbing if you go and find age specific mortality data. <br/>
Just reading through a paper by Mike Gurven and Hilly Kaplan there isn&#39;t any <br/>
spike in mortality over the teen years among hunter gatherer groups, among <br/>
peasant groups, from Swedish historical data from 1751-1759, even from <br/>
prehistoric data (presumably from skeletal remains), and for wild chimpanzees <br/>
and captive chimpanzees. Looking at raw number data for the U.S. from 1999 to <br/>
2006, however, there is a spike in car accident deaths involving 15 to 24 year <br/>
olds that then levels back out, although never returning to the lows of earlier <br/>
age groups with boys at a much greater risk than girls across all later age <br/>
groups. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That suggests a cultural condition and not a genetic condition. <br/>

limber and so less likely to be injured doing risky things. And, they <br/>
fight off infection better and are less likely to die from the same <br/>
injury that would kill someone older.<br/>
<br/>
They could be taking more risk because they are less likely to be <br/>
seriously injured and less likely to die if they are.<br/>
<br/>
In that case, noting that they are in fact less likely to be seriously <br/>

that they might be taking more risk.<br/>

Recently, football players are saying they are hitting way harder, using <br/>
their heads to hit way harder, because of the better football helmet <br/>
technology. More protection is leading to greater risk-taking.<br/>
