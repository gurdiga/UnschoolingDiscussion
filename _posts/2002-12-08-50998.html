Philip Berrigan, 79, a pacifist, writer and iron-willed advocate for peace<br/>
whose nonviolent protests against militarism led to repeated imprisonments,<br/>
died of cancer Dec. 6 at his home in Baltimore.<br/>
<br/>
For nearly four decades, Mr. Berrigan, a former Roman Catholic priest, was a<br/>
major figure in the American peace movement, with his stature bolstered by<br/>
his willingness to endure long prison stretches in county, state and federal<br/>
cells.<br/>
<br/>
Believing, as did Martin Luther King Jr., that &quot;war is our government&#39;s<br/>
number one business,&quot; Mr. Berrigan began his dissent against military<br/>
violence in 1967, when he and three others destroyed draft records in a<br/>
government office in Baltimore. In 1968, he and another group struck again<br/>
at a Catonsville, Md., selective service facility, where hundreds of draft<br/>
records were burned with homemade napalm.<br/>
<br/>
Arrested and convicted, he was the first American Catholic priest to be<br/>
jailed for political dissent, according to one biographer. He later<br/>
escalated his high-stakes protests by furtively entering military bases to<br/>
do symbolic damage to warplanes, bombs and other weapons of mass<br/>
destruction.<br/>
<br/>
What juries and judges perceived as lawbreaking -- being &quot;a danger to the<br/>
community&quot; said a North Carolina judge in 1993 -- Mr. Berrigan saw as<br/>
allegiance to international treaties forbidding nations to prepare for wars<br/>
of annihilation.<br/>
<br/>
In time, large numbers of pacifists, modeling themselves after Philip<br/>
Berrigan, would engage in similar antiwar actions. Collectively, they became<br/>
known as the Plowshares Movement, a loosely organized coalition credited<br/>
with more than 80 separate actions that almost always resulted in jail<br/>
terms. Nuns and priests were among those locked up.<br/>
<br/>
Whether by himself or with legal help from such human rights lawyers as<br/>
Ramsey Clark and William M. Kunstler, Mr. Berrigan argued to judges &quot;the<br/>
necessity defense.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In &quot;Fighting the Lamb&#39;s War: Skirmishes with the American Empire,&quot; his 1996<br/>
autobiography, Mr. Berrigan writes: &quot;If a house full of children is burning,<br/>
it is necessary to break the door down to rescue them. [In our trials] the<br/>
government refused to allow the necessity defense, arguing that we could not<br/>
prove that nuclear war was imminent. We explained that nuclear war could<br/>
happen at any time. It was imminent because the government was designing,<br/>
building and deploying nuclear weapons. It was imminent because our air,<br/>
water and food supply were being poisoned with radioactive isotopes. All<br/>
weapons, nuclear and conventional, reflect the spirit of murder, rather than<br/>
of hope.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At a Pennsylvania trial in 1981, the judge snapped: &quot;Nuclear warfare is not<br/>
on trial here. You are.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Through the late 1990s, Mr. Berrigan, a sturdily-built, gregarious man,<br/>
accumulated more than a dozen years of prison time, including federal stints<br/>
in Danbury, Conn., and Lewisburg, Pa.<br/>
<br/>
His methods of resistance often drew criticism. From the right, he was<br/>
ridiculed as a professional prisoner whose actions had no effect on public<br/>
policy. Some on the left said that his destroying of property -- damaging<br/>
weapons, burning draft records -- was itself a form of violence.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is a curious argument,&quot; Mr. Berrigan wrote, &quot;one I&#39;ve heard many times.<br/>
Warheads whose sole purpose is to vaporize cities are hardly to be thought<br/>
legitimate property. Bombs that indiscriminately murder millions of men,<br/>
women and children are not &#39;property.&#39; &quot;<br/>
<br/>
The youngest of six brothers in a Syracuse, N.Y., Irish, Catholic household,<br/>
Mr. Berrigan enthusiastically joined the Army during World War II. As an<br/>
infantry officer, &quot;I was a highly skilled young killer. I thought that&#39;s<br/>
what patriots do. God may tell us not to kill, but when the state calls, we<br/>
must obey. We must become remorseless killers, willing to use any means to<br/>
defend against the enemy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
His conversion to nonviolence was years ahead.<br/>
<br/>
After the war, and a degree from Holy Cross College, Mr. Berrigan studied<br/>
for the priesthood in the Josephite order. Following his ordination in<br/>
Washington in 1955, he served for a year in an impoverished parish in<br/>
Anacostia.<br/>
<br/>
In 1957, he was sent to New Orleans, where he taught theology for seven<br/>
years in an all-black parish high school. It proved to be a radicalizing<br/>
experience: &quot;I set out to discover why my black parishioners lived in<br/>
ghettos, why their children attended all-black schools, why hospitals<br/>
refused black patients, why the police routinely beat and even killed black<br/>
citizens. And the quest always returned to the same poisonous tree [of<br/>
racism], the roots of which were strangling our nation&#39;s soul.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
By the mid-1960s, and now serving in a Josephite parish in Newburgh, N.Y.,<br/>
he was ordered by his superiors to stop speaking out against injustice: &quot;I<br/>
was told, quite literally, to shut my mouth.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He declined.<br/>
<br/>
In 1970, at 43, he married Elizabeth McAlister, a member of the Religious<br/>
Order of the Sacred Heart. Because he was a priest and she a nun, the couple<br/>
at first did not make their union known publicly. When they did, in 1973,<br/>
both were immediately excommunicated by the Catholic church. Eventually Mr.<br/>
Berrigan, gifted with Irish wit, would describe himself as &quot;a Catholic<br/>
trying to become a Christian.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The couple settled in a Baltimore working-class neighborhood. They called<br/>
their home Jonah House, one that soon became a communal haven for prayer<br/>
meetings, antiwar strategizing and students looking for guidance in simple<br/>
living. Mr. Berrigan earned a modest income from house painting, lecturing<br/>
and writing.<br/>
<br/>
Among the regular visitors to Jonah House was the Rev. Daniel Berrigan, a<br/>
Jesuit priest and Philip&#39;s older brother. The two were soul mates and, often<br/>
enough, cellmates. Linguist and political dissident Noam Chomsky called the<br/>
two brothers &quot;heroic individuals, willing to do what many realize should be<br/>
done, regardless of the personal cost, with a simplicity of manner. There<br/>
are not too many people of whom this can be said.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Away from the barricades, Philip Berrigan was known less as a resolute<br/>
defier of state and church power than as a person of deep compassion, faith<br/>
and generosity.<br/>
<br/>
Actor Martin Sheen, a friend, described Mr. Berrigan as &quot;a Christian who<br/>
truly walks the radical way of the cross. [He] overturns the tables of<br/>
injustice and summons us to love our enemies and worship the God of peace.<br/>
Like Thoreau, Gandhi, King and [activist and journalist] Dorothy Day, Phil<br/>
Berrigan exemplifies courage. He is both an inspiration and a challenge to<br/>
me and countless others.&quot;<br/>
