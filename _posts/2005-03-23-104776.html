<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571417447"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Dyslexia doesn&#39;t matter in an unschooling environment.  If a child  <br/>
&gt; learns to<br/>
&gt; read in his own way in his own time, (snip) it will happen whether <br/>
&gt; they have  symptoms<br/>
&gt; of dyslexis or not.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My experience is that if your kids are hanging out with schooled kids, <br/>
they will feel SOME pressure to be &quot;at level&quot; with whatever the <br/>
schooled kids are doing SOME of the time.<br/>
<br/>
My almost 9 year old is really not ready to read yet - she flips and <br/>
confuses many letters and has a hard time understanding what sounds a <br/>
lot of the letters make.  Reading and her inability to read (yet) comes <br/>
up a lot with other people.  People expect an almost 9 yo to be able to <br/>
read.<br/>
<br/>
So, she looks for learning to read programs at the library.  I help her <br/>
as much as I can, but I don&#39;t like the tools we&#39;ve found.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to have better tools to help her with this - so I&#39;m <br/>
reading the Gift of Dyslexia.  I don&#39;t think this is quite the right <br/>
fit, but haven&#39;t found anything better.<br/>
<br/>
She WANTS to learn to read.  I WANT to help her with that.  Everything <br/>
I&#39;ve found to help her is awful.  I know there must be some way I can <br/>
help her more organically, but I don&#39;t know how.<br/>
<br/>
I am an unschooler who wants to help her daughter do something she has <br/>
a lot of desire to do.  I reassure her that it will come - it doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to be forced and it doesn&#39;t have to happen now.  But she is very <br/>
driven to read.  I&#39;m perfectly comfortable with waiting until it comes <br/>
more naturally for her - she is not.  I either need to find something <br/>
that will help her learn to read, or something to help her understand <br/>
that she doesn&#39;t need to force it.<br/>
<br/>
So I think that dyslexia does matter in an unschooling environment <br/>
sometimes.  And I think it is within the scope of this list to provide <br/>
ideas for those who want to help their kids learn something that the <br/>
kid is wanting to learn.  The stuff out there is not great - there must <br/>
be something better.  Maybe someone here can provide the better for <br/>
those of us struggling with this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooling parents really don&#39;t need to worry about dyslexia or  <br/>
&gt; &quot;ADHD.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Honestly, they can be blind and ignore those topics if they want to <br/>
&gt; and the<br/>
&gt; kids will STILL learn in their own way, which is the only way anyone <br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; learn.  And if the moms DO ignore those topics and yet still provide a <br/>
&gt;  safe,<br/>
&gt; happy, rich unschooling environment, and the children grow up <br/>
&gt; unlabelled  and<br/>
&gt; unashamed, they will be ahead of the kids in school who were called <br/>
&gt; disabled  and<br/>
&gt; diseased and slow and difficult.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know that I agree - for the simple reason that we don&#39;t live in <br/>
a bubble.<br/>
<br/>
Reading (and dd&#39;s inability to read) seems to come up a lot with her <br/>
and her friends.  I don&#39;t know why that is.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter wants to be in Brownies - they expect that all the girls <br/>
can read.   The leaders know my philosophy and respect it and provide <br/>
work arounds for her when needed.  But even though the leaders are not <br/>
making it a big deal, and try not to let it stand out - my daughter is <br/>
very forward about saying she can&#39;t read.  Then she can get funny looks <br/>
from the other kids - even though they don&#39;t make a big deal out of it.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s grandma who was a reading specialist before she <br/>
retired.....<br/>

-----------<br/>
 <br/>
They expect them to read or to have the decency to hide and lie if they  <br/>
can&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
Girls who&#39; can&#39;t read yet (and LOTS of kids in school can&#39;t read fluently  <br/>
even by midschool/Jr. High, and a fair number still can&#39;t read fluently by high  <br/>
school) simply won&#39;t join Brownies or Girl Scouts.  They will say &quot;That  club <br/>
is stupid&quot; rather than admit they can&#39;t read.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
I could be wrong, but I don&#39;t think that book will help you teach her to  <br/>
read. I think it will do what people here have been trying to do, which is say  <br/>
that it&#39;s NOT a &quot;disability,&quot; it&#39;s normal for a large portion of humans in  <br/>
general.<br/>
 <br/>
No one can learn to read any other person&#39;s way but her own.<br/>
No one can learn to read before she&#39;s ready, herself, to figure it  out.<br/>
 <br/>
Yes people can help, but only if your helping coincides with the other  <br/>
person&#39;s readiness will it seem that you &quot;taught them,&quot; and in every case, what  <br/>
happened was they figured it out.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-She WANTS to learn to read.  I WANT to help her with that.   Everything <br/>
I&#39;ve found to help her is awful.  I know there must be some  way I can <br/>

 <br/>
Holly was that way at that age.  At ten she still wasn&#39;t  reading.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>
easy, but it didn&#39;t help to keep trying.  The  second she got it, there it <br/>
was.  At 11 she read Judy Blume.  At 12  she read Stephen King.  <br/>
 <br/>
When Holly started reading, she had a huge vocabulary, so her beginning  <br/>
words weren&#39;t limited to the words four or five year olds know.  She was  figuring <br/>
out four and five syllable words right off the bat.  She went from  0 to 60, <br/>
as it were, bypassing years of practice sitting in the driver&#39;s seat,  <br/>
practice reciting lists of three-letter words, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
Her experience in girl scouts is recounted here:<br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/r/hollydodd_">http://sandradodd.com/r/hollydodd_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/r/hollydodd)">http://sandradodd.com/r/hollydodd)</a> <br/>
 <br/>
She quit, but not because she couldn&#39;t read.  She quit because the  leaders <br/>
weren&#39;t very smart (or at least not very energetic or interested in  finding <br/>
answers to her questions) and the other girls weren&#39;t very nice or  interesting. <br/>
  I was sad at the time but in retrospect I think it  was a good call.  That <br/>
particular troop wasn&#39;t into learning, they  were into checking the &quot;I went to <br/>
girl scouts&quot; box off their drab  checklist.  It was dismaying, but there it <br/>
was.  I tried to find her  another troop but the nearest was very school-based <br/>
and didn&#39;t call us  back.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I&#39;m perfectly comfortable with waiting until it comes <br/>
more  naturally for her - she is not.  I either need to find something <br/>
that  will help her learn to read, or something to help her understand <br/>
that she  doesn&#39;t need to force it.<br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Isn&#39;t unschooling itself the thing to help her understand that she can&#39;t  <br/>
force it even if she would like to?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-So I think that dyslexia does matter in an unschooling environment  <br/>
sometimes.  And I think it is within the scope of this list to provide  <br/>
ideas for those who want to help their kids learn something that the <br/>

 <br/>
The list would do well to help the parents learn that dyslexia is a normal  <br/>
condition of VERY many people, and it&#39;s not a disease.  It&#39;s better for  <br/>
parents to learn how kids grow into their abilities in different ways than  for <br/>
parents to want ideas to help their kids learn something the kid isn&#39;t ready  to <br/>
learn yet.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a book (bought long ago, before I came to unschooling) called <br/>
_Montessori Read & Write_ by Lynne Lawrence. It might have some <br/>
different kinds of activities your daughter would like. <br/>
<br/>
Overall, I have tons of problems with the book, but there might be <br/>
bits that are good! <br/>
<br/>
My four year old son is interested in writing letters, but seems to <br/>
get upset at making mistakes. When dd got a Magna-Doodle, which can <br/>
be erased very quickly, ds was suddenly much more interested in <br/>
writing and okay with making mistakes. In the same vein, there are <br/>
lots of activities in this book that involve physical manipulation of <br/>
sandpaper letters, wooden letters, etc. Again, I&#39;m guessing this is <br/>
different than other learning to read programs, but maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, I may try one of the ideas I just saw in the book. Write action <br/>
words on index cards and act out whatever the kids pull out of the <br/>
pile. Sounds like fun on a rainy day, regardless of any skills <br/>
learned or not learned!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, if you google montessori and reading, you&#39;ll find lots of <br/>
products to buy but also some explaining of the (very rigid) methods <br/>
and activities that are occasionally interesting to strew...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772591083">This has some good points. We don&#39;t live in a bubble, and schooled <br/>
kids are going to wonder about differences in other kids,and mostly <br/>
they&#39;re not going to be kind about those differences.<br/>
<br/>
In our case, I wish I had known about &quot;spatial intelligence&quot; years <br/>
ago. I might have used that wording earlier in Katie&#39;s life. In fact, <br/>
that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to talk to her about this afternoon. She&#39;s had <br/>
a tendency to &quot;lead&quot; with her inability to read, when introducing <br/>
herself or talking to a new grown-up. Like &quot;sorry. I can&#39;t read. I <br/>
have dyslexia.&quot; apologetically, almost.<br/>
<br/>
She got a kick out of the description of kids who &quot;can find any item <br/>
anywhere in the house&quot; in a book on different types of minds. It fits <br/>
her to a T. Spatial intelligence. <br/>
<br/>
So, if a kid has gotten into a habit of saying &quot;I&#39;m K---and I&#39;m <br/>
dyslexic&quot;, would you recommend talking to her about it (I already <br/>
have, btw. Just &quot;You know, you have a lot more inside of you than <br/>
just dyslexic.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
and, I&#39;m going to be exploring this spatial intelligence idea with <br/>
her more extensively.<br/>

<br/>
oh. It doesn&#39;t take hanging out with schooled kids for a kid to know. <br/>
When she was three, we took her to speech therapy, and she was quite <br/>
sad that she needed help with her speaking. That&#39;s one decision I do <br/>
regret, though her speech therapist was a sweety.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;read&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My ds Joshua did quit cub scouts partly because he couldn&#39;t read and partly <br/>
because he was no longer enjoying it.  It was a few months after I quit <br/>
being his den leader.  The new leader liked to have the boys play hangman or <br/>
other word games when they had free time, instead of letting them play <br/>
outside on the playground or in the gym.  But Joshua wasn&#39;t yet reading and <br/>
he was no longer having any fun at meetings.  They had become very <br/>
schoolish, with written assignments to bring home.  I had started going to <br/>
school myself and couldn&#39;t be the leader.  This is one of my big regrets! <br/>
But, happily, Joshua has decided that he wants to join boy scouts (ds James <br/>
is in the troop) and be able to go to summer camp and on camping weekends. <br/>
He will be 11 at the end of May and is still only a beginning reader, but he <br/>
seems to be on the verge of breaking through  (he&#39;s my 6th child and I can <br/>
see some signs).  I&#39;ve assured him that I will help him if there is any <br/>
reading or writing that he can&#39;t handle.  What was especially sweet was when <br/>
his brother told him that if he needs any help at camp he will help him (is <br/>
that clear as mud?).  I also just found out that the very academic leader, <br/>
who Joshua wasn&#39;t really wanting to have again (in this pack and troop the <br/>
leaders generally move up with the boys), recently moved away.  I think I <br/>
may need to get back involved with scouts.:-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187240033">Thank you, I&#39;ll be looking it up at the library. <br/>
<br/>
The book I have read is called &quot;One Mind at a Time&quot; by ??? Levine, <br/>
and he does point out the differences in learning styles, and thinks <br/>
they shouldn&#39;t be labeled as disabilities, but he focuses on parents <br/>
and teachers helping kids to get along in a schoolroom setting that <br/>
isn&#39;t conducive to their way of learning. He even mentions night-owl <br/>
kids, saying &quot;It&#39;s too bad there isn&#39;t night school for these kids, <br/>
but because there isn&#39;t, here&#39;s how to help them be alert during the <br/>
day when they&#39;ve been up until 2am the night before...&quot; etc.<br/>

schools operate to accommodate all the learning styles, rather than <br/>
offering strategies for kids with different learning styles to get <br/>
along in traditional school.  He also quotes and discusses John Holt a <br/>
lot.  The one thing he didn&#39;t really get into was curriculum -- he <br/>
didn&#39;t spend too much time (as I remember it, it&#39;s been a few months <br/>

learn.<br/>

Are you sure there IS such a book?<br/>
 <br/>
Can&#39;t you encourage them in their different styles without having a  book?<br/>
 <br/>
Why would a book be better than websites and online resources?<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not just a rephrase situation, it&#39;s a question about why having a book  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-23575342">well, there are books out now about different intelligences. I&#39;d like <br/>
to find one that describes the differences, and then gives non-school <br/>
advice or maybe just &quot;Some ideas for fun with kids who think <br/>
spatially&quot; <br/>
<br/>
and of course I can encourage them without a book. I just tend to be <br/>
a booky person, and would better learn about this myself, by reading <br/>
a book. <br/>
<br/>
and I did say &quot;the&quot; book, in my initial post. The rewording was <br/>
from &quot;finding a book to help my kids,&quot; to &quot;finding a book to help me <br/>
encourage them and not stress about their different styles of <br/>
learning.&quot; It doesn&#39;t help that my mom is fretting over the late-<br/>
starting reader. She cites an adult she knows who can&#39;t read, and <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to hear the theory, that school methods damaged him more <br/>
than helping him.<br/>
<br/>
meanwhile, I read books about different intelligences, and sorta <br/>
shake my head over the abundance of advice for how to help the <br/>
different learners jump through all the school hoops, when what we <br/>
need is a system that lets them learn as they learn, and truly at <br/>
their own pace.<br/>
<br/>
ah, but that&#39;s why we are doing the way we ARE doing, here at home.<br/>
<br/>
and sticking close to the unschooling discussions online!<br/>

Thomas Armstrong recently wrote a book about multiple intelligences for kids, <br/>
called You&#39;re Smarter Than You Think. It&#39;s pretty much what you describe <br/>
above, as well as some fun ideas to flex the intelligences you&#39;re not so strong <br/>
in. <br/>
