<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036771983">I don&#39;t <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;worry &quot; that<br/>
&gt; my son or daughter would be gay or lesbian. I worry that they won&#39;t <br/>
&gt; be a<br/>
&gt; content, happy confident, caring individual.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My nephew is gay.  He played with trucks and dolls, he danced and played<br/>
football. When he told his parents, I thought my brother would die. <br/>
Their relationship is still stressful.  I have asked my brother what he<br/>
believes a good human being should be.  <br/>
His answers, caring, unselfish, helpful, etc.  I remind him these are all<br/>
the qualities his son possesses.  <br/>
<br/>
They have so much in common.  The love of sports, flying, jumping out of<br/>
planes, music, animals.  I just don&#39;t get how this can separate you from<br/>
someone you found so worthy of your love before.<br/>
<br/>
My nephew is an amazing young man, very talented, happy, confident,<br/>
successful.   His father is missing out on so much.  How utterly foolish.<br/>
 Even my old, (eighty)  rigid, traditional mother has told him to get<br/>
over it!<br/>
