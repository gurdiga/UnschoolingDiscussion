<div id="ygrps-yiv-988864459">**How delightful.Â  We don&#39;t have any cables of any sort (no phone, no<br/>
electric) up here, so if they don&#39;t beam it from the heavens or across<br/>
the one valley (the ridge to the north is paper land) . . . well,<br/>
let&#39;s just say I don&#39;t take calls (or even get radio) down in the draw.**<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m really curious - probably because I&#39;m currently looking at all my <br/>
options for finally finally getting off of dial up access and into 21st century <br/>
communications - how do you get internet access down there in the draw without <br/>
cables of any sort? Are there places you can get satellite internet but not <br/>
satellite TV?<br/>
<br/>
My kids are pretty happy with our current cable channel mix, they&#39;re Animal <br/>
Planet and Food Channel devotees, but I&#39;d like the History channel. Whatever we <br/>
decide we&#39;ll have to upgrade to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940396316">Our internet (Air Pipe) does phone and internet using Motorola Canopy,<br/>
which operates on the 5.7 GHz band, but no television.  It&#39;s a little<br/>
like WiFi on NOs . . . and not actually satellite.   I&#39;d guess some do<br/>
all three, and I know a lot of cable cos are doing cable and tv, but<br/>
that&#39;s physically with a cable.  (And I&#39;ve met a number of folks<br/>
online who have webtv and hate the web part of it because it<br/>
apparently interfaces with things like yahoo so poorly).  We might be<br/>
able to do satellite on some of our ridges, but even the GPS gets some<br/>
interference because of our topography.<br/>

I have a Directway satellite internet dish, with TV cone, software and  <br/>
modems that I&#39;m not using anymore, if anyone is interested in it.  <br/>
