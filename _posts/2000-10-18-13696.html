How can we expect to have top-notch talent in the Oval Office when the<br/>
salary is so low?  I think Bush has a good point.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oops.  I think you got that wrong.  The Onion is neither liberal nor<br/>
conservative.  It&#39;s arguably the best example of modern satire in this<br/>
country.  Before The Onion, you would have had to go to Britain for such<br/>
quality satire.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The point of the article was to satirize our culture&#39;s obsession with money.<br/>
It also satirizes how we seem to care &quot;what&#39;s in it for me&quot; more than what<br/>
we can do for others.  The bit about the presidential salary was just the<br/>
vehicle to do that.  Nothing more.<br/>
