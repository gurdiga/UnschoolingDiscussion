you, along with your other band of merry-makers who take the &quot;superiority&quot; road probably succeeded in running off that person. <br/>
I&#39;ve been homeschooling for 15 years and I&#39;ve been on and off these message boards for about the same length of time. It&#39;s amazing to me that  the domination of the boards by a few way back when is *still* going on and, in fact, now revered by so many newbies who don&#39;t know the &#39;history&#39; of how the homeschooling boards often work.<br/>
Here&#39;s an example of how it always seems to go.<br/>
Somebody wrote in message 25793 :<br/>
&lt;I think I&#39;ll go and read some more about the beginnings of this country.  <br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions about good books to read on that?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>MY response can be found in messageS 25798 and 25799. I recommended TWO different resources.<br/>
Now, look what Sandra had to say about them in her response:<br/>
&lt;Earlier someone recommended *a* history series.  If an unschooled child is <br/>
interested in any period of history or any incident, I think they parents <br/>
should scout around for at least five or six pieces of input--movies, videos, <br/>
historical reports (first-hand, eye-witness reports), photos or archeological <br/>
evidence--and never ever think that reading one version of something which is <br/>
the author&#39;s impression should be enough to begin to &quot;know.&quot;  It can spark an <br/>
interest, but can&#39;t constitute a body of knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ms. Superiority strikes again.  Did anybody say these book recommendations were for kids and does that really matter? and does it really matter if those kids are schooled or unschooled? and did anybody say or even infer that one should stop at either of those references and shut the book, declaring them the gospel? NO.  ANY person that knows squat about unschooling knows that one resource is rarely the &#39;end all, be all&#39;. <br/>
Sandra has plenty of opportunities to voice her opinion here and elsewhere (HEM, for instance) and that is not so much my point as is the fact that she chooses to belittle so many other peoples&#39; suggestions, ideas and opinions. *Perhaps* Sandra could take the position of ADDING to someone&#39;s suggestions without finding fault with the original post.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916066761">Would you all do me, the managing editor of this site and list, a favor?<br/>
(read, the person who does the grunt work)   Could you please stop talking<br/>
about individuals?  Please?  There&#39;s simply no reason to take every post<br/>
personally, to assume everyone means to attack in every post, or to critque<br/>
*how* someone writes.<br/>
<br/>
The way to create community is by writing what is meaninful and useful to<br/>
you.  It&#39;s about sharing what works, what isn&#39;t and having discussions on<br/>
how things can be better.  But, in order for this to be the kind of place<br/>
where unschooling is the topic, we have to stop making targets out of<br/>
individuals.<br/>
<br/>
So, please, this last week has been hard enough, without people coming from<br/>
other lists to help stir up trouble, or for people who have a bone to pick<br/>
with any one other person to spend time antgonizing the whole list.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677274638">Dear Lisa <br/>
<br/>
Thankyou for all you have done. <br/>
<br/>
I am sorry that you are having medical<br/>
emergencies..not fun for anyone. I hope and pray that<br/>
good health will return soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thankyou to you and your husband and all reservist for<br/>
being there. My own DH would be too, but he had agent<br/>
orange related prostate cancer. As and Amtrak<br/>
locomotive engineer he&#39;ll keep on keep on.<br/>
<br/>
Thankyou again. You have done much for me personally,<br/>
too.  When I first was hunting for other unschoolers<br/>
or even ANY homeschoolers in my area you assisted me<br/>
via the net in a real and useful way. Your soothing<br/>
voice on the list is much appreciated, as is all the<br/>
&quot;grunt&quot; work that makes it possible for me to post and<br/>
read the, uhmm, stimulating exchanges here.<br/>
<br/>

You feel insulted and now you are retaliating.  <br/>
I think you are being a bit defensive.  You are probably the only one<br/>
who read it as a slam.  To me, that sounded like someone who gets <br/>
annoyed with the fact that so many people rely on one source for <br/>
their information, instead of using a variety.  And your argument was <br/>
that ANYONE who unschools would already know that, so why point it <br/>
out.  Not everyone reading here unschools and not everyone, I would <br/>
imagine,  has ever thought about this fact before.  It may have made <br/>
some people think, &quot;oh, I do tend to feel finished in my reasearch <br/>
after reading a history book about it, maybe I should find some other <br/>
sources&quot;<br/>
It sounded like a helpful, not hurtful post to me.  People trying to <br/>
figure out things, need to hear this type of stuff.  I know I did.<br/>

I will go back to lurkdom and watch how this all pans out. It will be interesting to see if your request/suggestion to &quot;... create community &quot; is heeded by all. (and perhaps even more interesting to see what you do if it isn&#39;t)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And perhaps that&#39;s the point of irritation. Some are seeing this list as an<br/>
opportunity to create a community welcome to all and some are trying to<br/>
create a community welcome to any who want to focus on unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As much as I value open, welcoming, nurturing communities, I also value<br/>
specialized communities.<br/>
<br/>
If a specialized list has something that draws many diverse people, the<br/>
people who came for the specialized aspect of the list are under no<br/>
obligation to adapt the list to accomodate everyone who shows up. A Zen<br/>
Gardening list should be allowed to remain focused on a traditional view of<br/>
Zen Gardening, regardless of how many would like to change it to a general<br/>
discussion list for those who are attracted to certain aspects of Zen<br/>
Gardening.<br/>
