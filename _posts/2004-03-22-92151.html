 </span></blockquote>Not everything that looks fun is worth doing.  Do you really want to<br/>
promote the wastefulness of a food fight?  Many people have<br/>
difficulties being able to afford to buy food to eat, let alone to<br/>
use it as a toy.  This might be a perfect opportunity to discuss<br/>
wastefulness, and perhaps even to encourage a charitable donation to<br/>
a hunger center with the very foods that may have been used in the<br/>
food fight.  I may be a bit biased about this because of my<br/>
upbringing, but my parents lived throught the Second World War in<br/>
Europe and suffered from hunger, so from early on it was instilled in<br/>
me that we do not waste.<br/>
<br/>

I disagree.  It doesn&#39;t have to be a waste.  You could go on a shopping trip<br/>
to find some foods that are so cheap that you could have a very satisfactory<br/>
food fight for a few dollars.  Since no one is eating it, the brand and<br/>
flavor don&#39;t matter.  Jello, rice, old cereal from the pantry that no one<br/>
ate before it went stale.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, maybe spontaneity is what makes a good food fight and<br/>
this much planning kind of squelches it?  Find out what it is that intrigues<br/>
your kids about the Hollywood style food fight.  I remember my brothers and<br/>
I used to fantasize about a pie fight like they had on the Brady bunch<br/>
vacation episode.  We had a lot of fun trying to figure out if they wasted<br/>
all those real pies or if they were just pie tins filled Redi-Whip.<br/>
<br/>
I think my kids love it when serious people like my dh and I do something<br/>
out of character and wacky (even I wish that sort of thing happened more<br/>
often).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanksgiving dinner about 11 years ago. Extended family - maybe 25 <br/>
people at big table - done eating and just having pie. My bil tried to <br/>
take the lid off of some whipped cream - the kind in a canister that <br/>
sprays out - it sort of exploded and whipped cream flew up - stuck on <br/>
the ceiling and also kind of sprayed all over people sitting near him. <br/>
I got it in the face - more than anybody else. So I grabbed another can <br/>
and pointed it at him and sprayed him back. I don&#39;t think the kids ever <br/>
laughed so hard in their lives as they joined in - it was self-limiting <br/>
because we wanted the whipped cream for our pies and there were only a <br/>
few cans, but everybody who wanted to got at least one chance to spray <br/>
somebody. My bil died of leukemia a little over a year later - that was <br/>
our last Thanksgiving together and that memory is just so precious to <br/>
us all. He was a guy who had FAR more spontaneity than the rest of us <br/>
and brought out the fun in us. Even now all these years later, we can <br/>
be kind of a serious family, but each of sometimes thinks, &quot;What would <br/>
Des do?&quot; and then does some totally out of character wacky thing.<br/>
