<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The only reason he will give as to why he will<br/>
&gt; not shower is &quot;because I don&#39;t want to&quot;  Basically, he does not want to take<br/>
&gt; the time to do it.  Lots of folks would call it &quot;too lazy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is it laziness, or does he just not feel like it?  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m lazy,<br/>
per se, but there are days I just do not feel like bothering with getting in<br/>
the shower, getting all wet, getting my hair all wet (tho I probably have<br/>
more hair than he does!), and all that.  I&#39;m conditioned to take a shower<br/>
every couple days or so, so it&#39;s not like I smell.  But I can understand<br/>
where he&#39;s coming from.<br/>
<br/>
My husband would probably love a shower right now, since he&#39;s in a place<br/>
where he&#39;s not getting any!  However, your son might try out the military&#39;s<br/>
favorite, which is a baby wipes shower.  Call it a marine shower, they do,<br/>
and it might go over better.  Not the fancy (expensive) anti-bacterial kind,<br/>
but a few of the cheapies, wiped over most smelly body parts and in joints<br/>
(elbows, knees, etc.) that sweat, too, will vastly improve B.O., and isn&#39;t<br/>
quite so much effort as a shower.<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We lived in a place a few years ago where our well became fouled with oil <br/>
that leaked out of the water pump. There was nothing we could do but let <br/>
the water run out through a garden hose until the oil finally cleared.  It <br/>
took a l_o_n_g time. We could not use our water at all for anything other <br/>
than flushing the toilet for about 3 months.  It was another 3 months on <br/>
top of that before we could use our shower.  We took showers at our <br/>
wonderful neighbors&#39; house, but we couldn&#39;t do that too often, being really <br/>
sensitive about becoming a nuisance.  What we did was use bottled water and <br/>
a washcloth.  My husband call them &quot;birdbaths.&quot;  Man, when you can&#39;t take a <br/>
shower, there&#39;s nothing like taking one!<br/>
<br/>
Brenda, I hope with all my heart that your husband gets to enjoy a long, <br/>
hot, steamy shower soon!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not counting on it.  He&#39;s in Kuwait, waiting to move to Iraq.  Right<br/>
now, he&#39;ll settle for getting email soon.  A long, hot shower is probably<br/>
unforseeable future.<br/>
<br/>
Your well water problems sound like a real pain, though.  Everybody my<br/>
husband is with has the same problem.  But trying to make do in &quot;polite<br/>
society&quot; is a lot harder.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like to think back on that period of time as proof to myself that I can <br/>
do anything if I have to.  We had to have the walls of our bathtub replaced <br/>
last summer, and what we were told would be a 4- to 5-day job turned into a <br/>
couple of weeks that we had to go without using our shower (we eventually <br/>
finished the job ourselves, another story altogether).  Friends were <br/>
sympathetic, but I kept telling them, &quot;This is nuthin&#39;!&quot;  Besides, we have <br/>
a swimming pool!  Liam was never cleaner!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
