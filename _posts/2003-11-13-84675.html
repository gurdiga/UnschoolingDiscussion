<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591095448">Somebody on this list mentioned &quot;CountDown&quot; by Cadaco. I bought this <br/>
game at Target and really like it. It is simple simple simple - but <br/>
somehow a bit addicting. This is especially good for kids who are busy <br/>
enjoying learning all the basic &quot;math facts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The reason I like it so much is that it has a lot of scope for &quot;playing <br/>
around&quot; with the rules - make up your own varations.<br/>
<br/>
I have some variations of this on my blog - <br/>
