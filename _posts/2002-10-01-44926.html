<div id="ygrps-yiv-377156029">Ironically we had a dog unschooling moment this evening.  We were <br/>
leaving our favorite little italian eating place (in Okinawa :) and <br/>
a truck pulled up with a Komondor.  If you&#39;ve ever seen one they are <br/>
the coolist!  The look like a mop!  My kids were enthralled and the <br/>
owner let us pet him.  He was white with dreadlocks at least a foot <br/>
long.  He was so sweet.  We asked all sorts of questions about how <br/>
he handles the heat here and the only problem reported was due to <br/>
the humidity he can have mildew growth!  EWWW!  We came home and <br/>
immediately went to the akc site and looked the Komondor up as well <br/>
as many other breeds and read about their best attributes.  The <br/>
funniest thing was trying to get two very silly tired kids to say <br/>
Shih Tzu!  I was rolling!  I guess this could be classified under <br/>
biology?  We had fun.<br/>
