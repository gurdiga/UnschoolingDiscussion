 </span></blockquote>Dishwashers are pretty expensive back home. I only ever knew one family who had one. It was so novel I even offered to load it for her! Plus the water is metered and a dishwasher used more than a<br/>
washing-up bowl in the sink.<br/>
You know what else I&#39;ll miss? The garbage disposal! We don&#39;t have them at all. Aren&#39;t they fun? I could spend ages playing with one (and have done...) It&#39;s like having  a sharrk in the sink :-)<br/>
<br/>
And could we change the headings now please. Its getting a bit disconcerting!<br/>
