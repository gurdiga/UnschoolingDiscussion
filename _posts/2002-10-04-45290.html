<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511150238">Ooooh, Avila Beach? I haven&#39;t been there for ages!! We wanted to live in San <br/>
Luis Obispo (just up the road) and I still dream of it.<br/>
<br/>
Ren, missing Cali ( and the entire West Coast for that matter)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in San Luis Obispo and I only moved as far away as Berkeley but I <br/>
still miss it.  Avila Beach is the last great undiscovered beach town.  Won&#39;t <br/>
be for long though.  Unical bought up the town (to clean up a spill) and it&#39;s <br/>
getting swankier.<br/>
