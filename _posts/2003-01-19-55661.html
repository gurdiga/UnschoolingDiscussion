&lt;&lt; Somebody will probably tell me that there is<br/>
educational value in the Simpson&#39;s too!!!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
TONS.<br/>
You could talk to Holly for hours and be amazed.  She&#39;s a font of <br/>
connections.  <br/>
But it goes both ways.  The more kids know about history, culture, geography, <br/>
movies, music, religion, musicals, etc., the more Simpsons jokes they&#39;ll get. <br/>
 But gradually as they see and hear all kinds of things, the patterns start <br/>
to form up about what the whole world, past and present, involve, and what&#39;s <br/>
funny, and what some people think is too important to laugh about.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we were talking about &quot;embiggens,&quot; a word having to do with <br/>
Jedediah Springfield, a famous pioneer and founder of their town, and about <br/>
the time Lisa discovered he wasn&#39;t what he claimed to have been.   We were <br/>
talking about whether it was a real word.  It&#39;s not a real word, but it <br/>
follows real-word rules, and it makes sense.  And &quot;enlarges&quot; can sometimes <br/>
mean the same, but &quot;enlarge&quot; can also  mean to set free from prison, as it <br/>
does in the treason scene of Henry V.<br/>
<br/>
We also talked about how important  myths are to people sometimes, and that <br/>
Lisa figured the good that came from people idealizing the guy was better <br/>
than the letdown they would get from the truth.  They would not be <br/>
&quot;embiggened.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The theme song, from the end of that episode:<br/>
<br/>
Jebediah Springfield Theme&quot; (Episode 3F13, Lisa the Iconoclast)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s that team of Jebediah Springfield<br/>
Whip those horses, let that wagon roll<br/>
That a people might embiggen America<br/>
That a man might embiggen his soul, his soul, his souuuul!<br/>

<br/>
&quot;A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I never heard the word &#39;embiggen&#39; until I moved to Springfield.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why not? It&#39;s a perfectly cromulent word.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(&quot;Cromulent&quot; is another Simpsons-word.)<br/>

Trevor says he learned &quot;don&#39;t get drunk and go into a movie theatre&quot; (because <br/>
you&#39;ll keep repeating what they say over and over and everyone will tell you <br/>
to shut up:)<br/>
<br/>
He learned &quot;don&#39;t talk about the key parts of a movie as you&#39;re walking out&quot; <br/>
(all the people waiting to go in will have the movie ruined for them)<br/>
<br/>
See, you can learn stuff from the Simpsons!! hehe<br/>
Actually, where those kind of shows pay off, is in the conversations they <br/>
spark and lead to who knows where. I think one of the episodes had Cuban <br/>
cigars in it, which leads to conversations about why we have sanctions <br/>
against Cuba, Fidel Castro etc.... (there&#39;s your history/social studies bent <br/>
on it)<br/>
And the other night, we learned about what a Grifter is. Trevor is gaining <br/>
quite a vocabulary from tv!! Even the Simpsons.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
