<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246669612">The group I had started for the children is going great!  The kids have <br/>
been wonderful and we even have a few of them that post almost every <br/>
day.  It has been great to see them and for them to talk.  Granted, it is <br/>
kid talk which could be one or two sentences but it is fun :o)<br/>
<br/>
There are about 18 children on here and we are always welcome to more <br/>
joining us!  To do so, just write to <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschooledfriends-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">unschooledfriends-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>  and I will write back to you <br/>
to make sure they have permission to join the group.  Once I get this, they <br/>
are allowed on and can chat away!<br/>

Too often we give children answers to remember rather than problems to solve.<br/>

My daughter would like to join your unschooledfriends list and just wanted<br/>
to make sure the automatic request-for-approval message from Yahoo Groups<br/>
didn&#39;t get lost. She keeps asking every day when she can start reading and<br/>
posting!<br/>
