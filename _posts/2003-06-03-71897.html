&lt;&lt; I think I had a thing for Julie Andrews after I saw &quot;Victor/<br/>
Victoria&quot;.&lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s the androgyny (not that Julie Andrews is usually androgynous)...<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite unschooling/freethinking (any kind of thinking :-/) stories<br/>
is from when Kirby was seven or so and there was a homeschooling kid&#39;s chat <br/>
on AOL.<br/>
He was really excited about that, at first, and I would type for him as he <br/>
spoke what he wanted to say.<br/>
<br/>
One day one of the kids asked, &quot;Who&#39;s your favorite singer?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby had heard LOTS of music, live, recorded, radio, movies... and he had NO <br/>
idea of the fan aspect of &quot;favorite singer&quot; as in &quot;who is coolest at the <br/>
moment,&quot; so he took it as an honest question.<br/>
<br/>
Digression: That &quot;honest question&quot; thing is still in Kirby, and I think it&#39;s <br/>
wonderful.  When his girlfriend asked him, &quot;Do you want to go to the prom?&quot;  <br/>
he didn&#39;t know there was a set answer, a prescribed dialog, and that as her <br/>
boyfriend he had an obligation.  He took it as an honest question about his <br/>
personal desires and preferences.   It wasn&#39;t on his &quot;want list,&quot; and so he calmly <br/>
and sweetly said &quot;No.&quot;  WRONG ANSWER.<br/>
<br/>
Well this is the story of another wrong answer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was thinking and thinking fast.  &quot;Favorite singer&quot; was the category, so <br/>
he was thinking of whose voices he thought were good.    He named Julie <br/>
Andrews and Michael Jackson.<br/>
<br/>
As I was putting those in, separately, the rest were putting theirs.<br/>
<br/>
The list went kind of like this:<br/>
<br/>
Amy Grant<br/>
Amy Grant<br/>
Amy Grant<br/>
Michael Jackson<br/>
Amy Grant<br/>
Amy Grant<br/>
Julie Andrews<br/>
Amy Grant<br/>
Amy Grant.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
NOBODY except Kirby named anyone but Amy Grant.<br/>
<br/>
The question might as well have been (for the rest of them) which current <br/>
Christian singer will your Christian-homeschooling parents let you listen to?<br/>
<br/>
So from my point of view, Kirby was the only one qualified to answer. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From their point of view, Kirby was probably a hedonist freak.<br/>

I like that story. And I like that he still has that quality. He hasn&#39;t<br/>
realized that some people ask not wanting a real answer but the answer they<br/>
are looking for. Or maybe he just doesn&#39;t care to change to suit them.<br/>
Either way I love that he still does that.<br/>
Good for him!<br/>
