Hi everybody,<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a piece of good news from Japan to share for a change....<br/>
<br/>
Last night, the NHK public television network here in Japan aired an <br/>
original documentary on homelearning in the United States. It was covered <br/>
completely from the angle of the homelearners themselves, with no other <br/>
dissenting skeptics. On a scale of 1 to 10, overall I&#39;d personally give <br/>
the documentary an 8 on the positive side.<br/>
<br/>
The 45-minute program, which ran from 10:00 p.m., was titled &quot;I&#39;m Not <br/>
Going to School Anymore: America&#39;s Rapidly Rising Homeschoolers&quot; (rough <br/>
translation). The documentary basically profiled the lives of three <br/>
homelearning youths (their names initialized here out of respect for <br/>
privacy):<br/>
<br/>
-- &quot;S,&quot; age 8, of New York state, whose mother took her out of school and <br/>
began homelearning with her after the girl started showing signs of <br/>
stress and lack of confidence. This was due to S&#39;s cramming for the <br/>
standardized state test that is required for second graders of primary <br/>
school. S has two younger siblings, with Mother raising them and doing <br/>
most of the homelearning activities. Father works outside the home, and <br/>
is a bit cautious about the family&#39;s homelearning endeavor, but supports <br/>
it nonetheless.  <br/>
<br/>
-- &quot;J,&quot; age 12, also of New York, who has been homelearning several years <br/>
under his parents&#39; guidance and says he has grown closer to his mother <br/>
because of it. J, of middle-school age, belongs to the same homelearning <br/>
support network as S, above. J&#39;s dream is to study astrophysics someday. <br/>
After homelearning for several years, he is now contemplating whether or <br/>
not he should enter public school in the near future (three of his seven <br/>
homelearning friends have already done so). Mother is a bit wary of this, <br/>
but will respect and support J&#39;s decision either way.<br/>
<br/>
-- &quot;C,&quot; age 18, a former homelearner and now a student at the Naval <br/>
Academy in Maryland. His dream is to become a pilot someday. He is facing <br/>
a bit of a challenge in having to live such a regimented military life, <br/>
since his years of learning at home were a lot less unstructured. But he <br/>
nevertheless appreciates his homelearning years, and he stands out as a <br/>
positive role model for his peers and staff at the academy.<br/>
<br/>
The documentary showed impressive scenes of homelearning meetings, <br/>
support group functions, parents and children learning together in the <br/>
home, as well as children teaching each other in support group activities.<br/>
<br/>
There were a few other &quot;experts&quot; also featured, but their presence only <br/>
served to strengthen the underlying &quot;homelearning is good&quot; premise of the <br/>
documentary.<br/>
<br/>
One such expert was a child psychologist, who has done studies comparing <br/>
the social behavior of schooled children vs. homelearning children. He <br/>
showed and compared his videotaped research sessions, in which two <br/>
separate groups of children -- schooled and homelearners -- were put into <br/>
a room with toys and things to do. In both groups, the children were <br/>
meeting each other for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
The videotapes showed us that in the schooled children&#39;s session, the <br/>
kids quickly segregated themselves by gender, ignoring each other&#39;s <br/>
subgroups and never once looking up at the lone boy who was too shy to <br/>
approach the subgroups. Then the psychologist showed a tape of the <br/>
homelearning children&#39;s session: The boys and girls all soon worked <br/>
together on something in the center of the room, and when one shy boy <br/>
approached them, they warmly invited him into their group. The doctor&#39;s <br/>
assertion: Homelearning children on the whole react much more naturally <br/>
and openly to &quot;socialization&quot; than schooled children.<br/>
<br/>
Then there was The Educrat -- an employee of the New York education board <br/>
who is in charge of making sure that all homelearners in the state take <br/>
the required standardized tests and file regular reports on the progress <br/>
of their children. Interviewed at his cramped office, walls lined with <br/>
file cabinets, Mr. Sam O. (New Yorkers will instantly know who this is!) <br/>
unwittingly gave the most memorable quote of the whole program: &quot;Progress <br/>
is so important for us -- so that I know the kid isn&#39;t watching TV or <br/>
eating lollipops all day.&quot; It&#39;s a good thing this show was aired on <br/>
Japanese TV and not in the US; this guy would surely never be able to <br/>
live down all the &quot;sucker patrol&quot; jokes that would haunt him for the rest <br/>
of his days.<br/>
<br/>
But that was a bad as it got in this documentary. This guy represented <br/>
Big Brother harassing innocent people, and he turned out to be such a <br/>
bureaucratic clown on camera that he only made the homelearners in the <br/>
show look that much better.<br/>
<br/>
Political activities were featured as well. The controversial Home School <br/>
Legal Defense Association was shown at work, both at its offices and in <br/>
the halls of the US Congress. In the latter, HSLDA-member families broke <br/>
up into groups and went to visit politicians face to face, pressing them <br/>
for more freedoms for homelearning families. The camera caught one such <br/>
politician, Mark Foley of Florida, being confronted in his congressional <br/>
office by a group of these HSLDA adults and children who had come to <br/>
petition his support for home education. He was put on the spot, and came <br/>
across as recognizing the power of homelearners and acknowledging their <br/>
cause.<br/>
<br/>
The NHK documentary ended on an upbeat note, with encouraging words from <br/>
the mother of 8-year-old S, on why homelearning is so important to people <br/>
like them: &quot;I look to my children, too, to give *me* direction. It&#39;s not <br/>
me just giving *them* direction. [I&#39;m] hoping that that will help them in <br/>
the long run. And I&#39;m hoping that that will also help them feel that they <br/>
are confident in decisions that they make, in the directions that they&#39;re <br/>
going -- and knowing that I trust their decisions and that I trust their <br/>
help, their intelligence, their creativity....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All in all, not a bad program. This I say, despite the reservations I <br/>
have about the military and HSLDA portrayed as leading the way for <br/>
homelearners Stateside.<br/>
<br/>
But the most important thing to remember here is that the homelearning <br/>
movement in Japan is still in its infancy, and for many Japanese viewers <br/>
nationwide, this NHK program may be the first time they&#39;ve ever heard of <br/>
learning at home as an alternative to school. Hopefully, this program <br/>
will help them explore that alternative more in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Though Japanese homelearners don&#39;t have the strength in numbers (yet) of <br/>
our counterparts in other countries, there is one advantage over the US <br/>
or other countries that we do have: a news media in Japan that is not <br/>
openly hostile to homelearning. In fact, at this early stage, the <br/>
Japanese media seem to be giving a surprisingly fair shake in exploring <br/>
homelearning and alternative schools as viable educational choices. This <br/>
NHK documentary is proof of that.<br/>
<br/>
There are many theories about why such neutral-to-positive coverage of <br/>
homelearning is appearing in Japan right now, and all the theories <br/>
probably have some merit. But I think the best answer is close to home: <br/>
Lots of reporters and editors in the Japanese mass media have children, <br/>
and they seem to be desperately searching for answers for their own <br/>
families where school is concerned. If this personal searching in the <br/>
Japanese mass media helps advance the cause of homelearning in Japan and <br/>
brings the positive message of alternative education to a much wider <br/>
audience, then long may this coverage continue.<br/>
<br/>
Things may change as time goes on and alternative education in Japan <br/>
actually begins to threaten the foundations of the country&#39;s <br/>
education/industrial complex (as it most certainly will). But for now, at <br/>
least, we have a lot to be thankful for where Japanese media coverage of <br/>
homelearning is concerned.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if we could only get them to point their TV cameras more at <br/>
homelearning families right here IN Japan....!<br/>
