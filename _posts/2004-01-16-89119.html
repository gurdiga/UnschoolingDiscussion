<div id="ygrps-yiv-875436565">I&#39;m in No. Colo. and we have a sweet, little, new unschooling group going, and I<br/>
 would like to reach people farther away for fun filled campouts! <br/>
<br/>
Well put Pensacola on your calender for 2005 then!!<br/>
I&#39;m hosting the Unschoolers beach party in early October 2005...not a conference, just a fun hangout with cool activities to choose from. Everyone is welcome to present a funshop and I will plan low/no cost tourist activities for people to choose from.<br/>
The hotel will be right on the beach, so we&#39;ll have miles of sugar white sand and warm water for swimming. Hopefully the dolphins will be present for all of you...they make appearances now and then.<br/>
I hope some of you will be here, we have quite a few unschooling families living down this way.<br/>
