<div id="ygrps-yiv-160535828">No, different guy. :)  I will also point out that I don&#39;t agree with <br/>
everything that Frank says in his books, but I agree with a lot of <br/>
it.  We all know the difference between homeschooling and <br/>
unschooling.  Well his books are kind of like homechurching vs. <br/>
unchurching.  They are a nice first step and can lead to either <br/>
unchurching or church-at-home, depending on which way you go with it. <br/>
