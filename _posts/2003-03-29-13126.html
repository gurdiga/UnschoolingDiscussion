&lt;&lt; Yesterday I was driving them both to the theater and the friend was<br/>
talking about how her parents always go on and on about the importance of<br/>
proper nutrition (I bought her a kiwi snow bubble with tapioca, which<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem too nutritious but neither of us mentioned it). I asked if<br/>
her parents were always trying to shove protein into her when she has a<br/>
meltdown, and she said no, and added that if she had a meltdown her<br/>
parents would make her stay in her room for 3 hours and then go pick up<br/>
dog poop from the back yard.<br/>

<br/>
And it&#39;s not funny, but it&#39;s ironic.<br/>
<br/>
AND it&#39;s another damned school thing.    School health classes with their <br/>
balanced diets and their pictures of plates with vegetables and all that <br/>
often miss the point.<br/>
<br/>
The four food groups are out and the food pyramid is in.  I bought a food <br/>
pyramid chart years ago, and the kids know it well just from it being an <br/>
abvious visual.  But already, in the years since that change, people are <br/>
saying, &quot;Okay, maybe that&#39;s too much bread and pasta after all, or at least <br/>
go to less processed flour.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Still there&#39;s not much talk about why and when (when is still &quot;every day&quot; or <br/>
which is an improvement over &quot;at every meal&quot;).  <br/>
<br/>
Years ago we were planning a medieval feast.   I was in charge of an event, <br/>
and a friend who&#39;s older than I am and had done LOTS of period re-creation <br/>
stuff, mostly Elizabethan feasts for her Shakespeare-professors&#39;s students <br/>
and colleagues, was going to do her first SCA feast.  She had researched a <br/>
couple of real feasts of this period, for which people had kept lists of what <br/>
was served on specific days, and based one on that.<br/>
<br/>
Every dish was meat based, but she had planned some similar but vegetarian <br/>
substitutes.<br/>
<br/>
Still, what was not in that feast was salad or side veggie dishes.   Because <br/>
she wasn&#39;t doing a post-1950 American restaurant meal.  She was doing a 15th <br/>
century thing.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of women started a campaign of resistance, that if she didn&#39;t add <br/>
side dishes of vegetables not only would they not attend, but they would move <br/>
to have her replaced as cook.<br/>
<br/>
It was SO STUPID.   I remember saying to the one who was closest to me, &quot;Eat <br/>
spinach before you leave, and when you get home have a vegetable snack.  It&#39;s <br/>
One MEAL of one day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No, if you pay for food you should get a vegetable dish on the side.<br/>
<br/>
Too many things we learned at home and school were rules without basis, or <br/>
the application of a principle without the revelation of the principle behind <br/>
it, so that we came to adhere to our best guess at the reasons, or just to <br/>
cling to the practice (vegetable side dish) without any real understanding of <br/>
why.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I don&#39;t need vegetables.  Sometimes I need to get over having the <br/>
squirts, and vegetables do not help in any way.    Sometimes I ate a <br/>
gigantic, exotic salad for lunch and I really don&#39;t need more green farty <br/>
stuff for dinner.   Sometimes I wake up and think I really  need an artichoke <br/>
and an avocado and some spinach.   The other day Holly and I were shopping <br/>
and she wanted a can of artichoke hearts and I got a can of asparagus (since <br/>
I was up on the too-expensive top shelf anyway) and we went home and happily <br/>
ate our green stuff as a luxury snack.<br/>
<br/>
So...  I&#39;m just rambling and ranting, but I know my kids would never fall for <br/>
any panic about needing vegetables NOW because it was mealtime and there MUST <br/>
be a vegetable.  They also wouldn&#39;t fall for &quot;must have meat,&quot; but they do <br/>
know protein alternatives and how long they individually can go without <br/>
protein.  And it&#39;s not usually 24 hours, but it&#39;s more than six or eight <br/>
hours.<br/>

the school uses a film about slaughterhouses and peer pressure from her<br/>
classmates to pressure her to change her ways.  It&#39;s also the episode in<br/>
which the teacher, the principal, and the cafeteria lady all press their<br/>
