<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115952081">We&#39;ve gotten pretty serious abour card playing in the last several weeks. My seven year old <br/>
daughter loves concentration. She discovered quite by accident today, that when she totals <br/>
up how many pairs she has, she can figure out how many individual cards the pairs make <br/>
by counting by twos. She also understood for the first time why we say &quot;seven times two&quot; <br/>
when we are showing how to add up pairs in a large group. She was so happy!<br/>
<br/>
When she had nine pairs, she stopped the game to recalculate. It was such a cool math <br/>
moment. She has not really grasped the relationship of numbers to items and this was a <br/>
breakthrough of her own making. <br/>
<br/>
We also play &quot;I doubt it&quot; which has taught the subtlety of strategy and organization of <br/>
cards into &quot;sets.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t set out to &quot;teach&quot; anything, and there is no lesson going on. But I am in awe again <br/>
of how naturally the concepts you need come up in regular life if you pay attention.<br/>
<br/>
Any other serendipitous learning going on to share here?  I love to hear them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ds 8.5   and I have been on a Monopoly binge, whenever the ds2.5 is sleeping <br/>
or occupied, we play it. Last night we played 2.5 hours, till 11.  He  is <br/>
getting so good at counting the money I am amazed, he just gets it. Its cool to <br/>
watch him just figure things out. Last night we got to buying hotels, and I only <br/>
explained it once and it made sense to him. Sometimes he has trouble <br/>
readingthe chance or community chest cards, so I just do it for him, and the next time <br/>
he finds it easier. Best of all, we had a lot of fun!!!!!! I used to love <br/>
Monopoly as a kid, and it is great to finally have someone to playit with. <br/>
Are there any good books with card game instructions in them, or websites? I <br/>
am a little tired of fish and crazy eights, but other than 21 thats about all <br/>
I know. We want to get a crib board, and just may do that today!!<br/>

<br/>
The set up.  :)  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, as I mentioned, was Joseph&#39;s 12th birthday.  I had found for him a set of handmade runes (he didn&#39;t know if they even existed - niether did I at the time - but had wished for some runes of his own).  I also ordered a book - The Complete Illustrated Guide to Runes.  So yesterday my Mom dropped by the give him his gift and we were all sitting around.  My Mom didn&#39;t know what runes were and I flipped open the book and read just one paragraph aloud from the section &quot;What Are Runes?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In summary it mentioned that runic should not be called an alphabet at all, since alphabet means a row of characters beginning, as the Greek, Hebrew, Roman, and Gaelic do, with the characters alpha, beta, or their equivalents A, B etc.  How other letter-rows have a different order and as such are called by different names.  Runic begins with the letters F,U,Th,A,R,K and so runic &quot;alphabets&quot; are known as futharks.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s as far as I got when my 9yo daughter piped up that she&#39;d already told me about futharks - when she was reading Magical Worlds of Harry Potter.  I told her I probably don&#39;t remember because at the time I didn&#39;t have anything to connect it to.  But now, between our love of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, the Magical Worlds books (for both HP and LOTR), and the stuff we&#39;ve found so far in the guide to runes book, we were making connections right, left, and centre!  The conversation continued for at least 10 minutes and I found out tons of stuff my daughter has picked up and and connections she has made.  Not to mention a bunch of connections I made right then and there.<br/>
<br/>
And my Mom got to watch this cool learning in action to boot!  <br/>

thought I&#39;d resend - sorry if it comes through twice eventually.<br/>

<br/>
We love to play a game called &quot;Trash.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Deal ten cards to each player face down in two rows of five. Put the rest of the cards in the <br/>
middle as a draw and discard pile.<br/>
<br/>
The object of the game is to replace the face down cards with the correct number card to <br/>
go in order from one to ten. Kings are wild cards and can be used for any number. Jacks <br/>
and Queens are worthless.<br/>
<br/>
First player either uses the discard or draws a new card. Look at your face down cards and <br/>
replace the correct one with the drawn card (if it will work). For instance, if player A draws <br/>
a six, she would replace the first card int he second row with the six. Flip the card over <br/>
that is in the six spot and see if it can replace another card in the two rows. If it&#39;s, say, a <br/>
four, then put it in the four position and turn over the card that is there. Let&#39;s say it&#39;s a <br/>
King. Place it anywhere there is a face down card. Flip that card and look to see if it can <br/>
replace another card and so on until you turn up a card that can&#39;t be used (either the slot <br/>
is already full or it&#39;s a Jack or Queen). Discard the card that won&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
(Caveat: If the king is placed in a slot that has a card that can be put where the king is, <br/>
lucky you! You can now move the king to yet another spot until that card is replaced by it&#39;s <br/>
correct number. It is possible to fill up the number rows with up to all four kings-there is <br/>
no need to replace them, but if you can, go ahead.)<br/>
<br/>
Now the next player takes her turn. She can either use the discard or draw a new card. She <br/>
does the same thing - checks to see if the card will work in her two rows and flips up and <br/>
replaces cards until she can&#39;t go any further.<br/>
<br/>
First player to replace all her cards with the correct numbers and/or kings, goes out.<br/>
<br/>
Gather up all the cards and shuffle. Deal them out again only this time, the player who <br/>
&quot;went out&quot; first gets nine cards while the other player gets ten. This time the player with <br/>
nine cards won&#39;t be able to use tens at all, but she&#39;ll have fewer cards to replace.<br/>
<br/>
Play continues like this until one player has gone from ten cards, to nine to eight to seven <br/>
all the way down to one card (which only need be replaced by a King or an ace). <br/>
<br/>
A player wins when she goes out with only one card before the other player (no matter <br/>
how many cards that player has left).<br/>
<br/>
Hope that&#39;s clear enough! My kids love this game and it&#39;s been a wonderful help with <br/>
counting and numeric order. :)<br/>
