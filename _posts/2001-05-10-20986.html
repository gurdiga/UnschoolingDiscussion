<div id="ygrps-yiv-563816997">In the Beginning <br/>
         God created the World<br/>
                     and populated it with Children. <br/>
<br/>
.... and after a time, He looked down and said:<br/>
          &quot;Heavens! This place is a ZOO!!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
So He created Pets.  <br/>
<br/>
.... and after a time, He looked down and said:<br/>
           &quot;What an ungodly MESS!  You kids need a shepherd!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
So He created Dads.  <br/>
<br/>
.... and after a time, He looked down and WAS ASTONISHED!!!<br/>
            To see the whole works going<br/>
                      Straight to HELL IN A HANDBASKET!!!!  <br/>
<br/>
So He created       **  MOMS  **<br/>
<br/>
.... and after a time, The Lord looked down and He said:<br/>
<br/>
                * * *   THIS IS GOOD   * * *<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       Happy Mother&#39;s Day<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Love Kandi <br/>
* We can do no great things; only small things with great love. *<br/>
