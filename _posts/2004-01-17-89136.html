<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852933502">Thanks for the detailed campout information, Pam.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And who was at last year&#39;s Live & Learn Unschooling Conference-----and who <br/>
WON a family registration to the conference in Peabody, MA this August! Yeah!<br/>

Yipee! And this year, we&#39;re flying.  I&#39;m done driving across the country for a while.  By the way, on our way home, we drove straight through (31 hours).  Our kids are champs; it was almost inhumane.  But we were all so homesick.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Well put Pensacola on your calender for 2005 then!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is.  I love beach vacations, since we&#39;re landlocked.<br/>
