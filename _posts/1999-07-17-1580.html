<div id="ygrps-yiv-617352702">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
This is just to let you know that, after much burning of the midnight oil and after<br/>
filling outstanding orders, I actually have the princely sum of *2* copies of my report<br/>
&quot;Unschooling Instead: Aedan & Keszia&#39;s First Year Homeschooling&quot; available for anyone who<br/>
would like a copy.  They are US$19 each including p&p, and can be ordered by emailing me<br/>
directly.<br/>
<br/>
For those who have no idea what I&#39;m talking about, &quot;Unschooling Instead&quot; is basically a<br/>
report about what the kids and I achieved in each subject in a year, using the relaxed<br/>
unschooling method. The children were aged 4 and 3 at the time. The report is 133 pages<br/>
long, A4 size, and includes around 4000 educational references to things they did, under<br/>
the appropriate subject headings. It also includes about 50 photos/copies of the<br/>
children&#39;s work.   Reviews from people who have bought the report can be viewed at<br/>

<br/>
A lot of people recently have been ordering the report to use as both a resource/idea book<br/>
for when starting out homeschooling, particularly at the preschool level, as well as for<br/>
proof to the cynics as to just how much can be achieved in the period of one year, by<br/>
simply following the lead of the childrens� interests and by having quality resources<br/>
easily accessible for them to delve into.  In addition I have listed in the report a<br/>
myriad of everyday activities that we all undertake with children that at first glance we<br/>
don�t think of as �educational�, or if so, into which subject area they would fall under.<br/>
This would help in the learning of &#39;educationalese&#39; for using when speaking to department<br/>
officials, and also as a guide for compiling an exemption from attending school for their<br/>
children, if this is what is required.<br/>
<br/>
It also may be particularly useful to:<br/>
(a) people starting out homeschooling with children of any age;<br/>
(b) people who don&#39;t understand how unschooling can work;<br/>
and (c) people looking for a method of record-keeping.<br/>
<br/>
My apologies to anyone who gets this message more than once.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Mandy Tyler<br/>
