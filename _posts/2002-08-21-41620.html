<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412930670">&lt;Concerning parenting books, I have read too many to count and have found many &#39;so-called experts&#39; don&#39;t know what the hell they&#39;re talking about!!  &gt;<br/>

lol! Joz! I feel the same way. Just yesterday, I was reading yet another book on parenting - the title promised a good read. But, I could only take SO much of hearing of these people&#39;s perfections and  control and how they did everything right in parenting...I said to my dh &quot;These  people make me feel sick&quot;! I, too , have learned most from my children  and experience and from real stories, honest , sharing books/people...Leonie<br/>
