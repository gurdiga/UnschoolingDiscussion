Step back.....take a trip.....&quot;stop thinking about it&quot;.....go to the <br/>
beach.....do anything but pursue - and something will come.....something <br/>
incredible that you couldn&#39;t have thought of..... &gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-93615322">&lt;&lt;There are alternative, code acceptable septic systems.<br/>
Mother Earth News magazine has adverizements and<br/>
addy&#39;s.  Your homesteading list might have ideas.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh Yeah! I should ask them! LOL<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;House building is SLOW. You are doing GREAT. How is<br/>
your balcony garden?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My herbs (not herb) are doing well. Tomorrow I pick up my Tomatoes and<br/>
basil. I can taste the Bruschetta now. Mmmm. I better run to Home Depot<br/>
tonight and get some nice big containers !!<br/>
Also, I just talked to teh realtor. The first one failed, the second and<br/>
third passed but barely. The tester-man is going to do another more into the<br/>
woods where he expects it to pass. And if so, it won&#39;t even involve moving<br/>
the house site! So, it&#39;s not so bad. And we&#39;ll look at otehr lots in the<br/>
meantime.<br/>
I just want this one!!<br/>
Thank you Sharon, for the kind words.<br/>
