<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934943291">Hi I am a mom of 8. 5 still at home and unschooled since birth. The 5 still at home  were adopted out of the Foster Care System.  All were born drug affected so have various &quot;stuff&quot; going on. Our littlest and brightest angel is 8yo. He is an Aspie and a delight! All of them are amazing kids and have brought untold joy and a deeper dimension to our lives.<br/>
We live on 8 beautiful acres not far fromt he WA/ID border. we raise Saanen Goats and one lovley LaManch. We are looking for a good LaMancha buck and a pair of Boers. we also will be adding a milk cow, pigs, chickens and rabbits throught the Spring and Summer. <br/>
<br/>
Our children at home range in age from almost 14yo twin boys down to our 8 yo. Our goal is to make our farm completely sustainable. My hubby and i will be married 15yrs on friday. He is a gem! Works for the USPostal Service and is a master gardener. I am the SAHMom. driver of the beast(15passy van) quilter of stuff, and scaler of Mt. laundry.<br/>
We have ALWAYS unschooled. It really is the only way my kids know. There rare and brief ventures into both Public and Catholic School left them with a much greater appreciation for Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
looking forward to getting to know everyone.<br/>

If they&#39;ve had ventures into public and parochial school (however rare or brief), still unschooling isn&#39;t the only way they know.<br/>
<br/>
Just sayin&#39;. :-)<br/>

There are things happening the NW, but I&#39;m not sure how far NE you are from those.<br/>

Please, for unschooling discussions such as this one, try to use names or ages, but not labels if it can be avoided.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088214837">Chuckling because I read what looked like the first sentence quite literally: &quot;Hi I am a mom of 8.5 still at home and unschooled. . .<br/>
<br/>
I thought, okay, eight children plus another on the way (half a child) or perhaps a stepchild who is there half the time?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-538296095">Sandra,<br/>
Our philosophy does not include NEVER allowing them the experience of institutional schooling. At 2 different times our children have expressed a desire to experience &quot;school&quot;. So they did. Lasted about a month each time. Then they had enough.  I see that as part of our journey.  I would imagine each of our Unschooling styles are as different as each of us. That would include each families journey.<br/>
As far as lableing my child. Well, I only say he is diagnosed as having Aspergers b/c perhaps there are other children Unschooled who are also diagnosed on the Autism Spectrum. They each have different learning capabilities and ways of exploring this world. We can always learn from one another. My way of seeing things is that there is no real &quot;expert&quot; just different levels of experience. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I respect all others parenting philosophies and hope mine wll be respected  as well. <br/>
<br/>
I should also mention that at different times my children have had music lessons. dance, played an organized sport etc.  All good experiences and all desired by the individual child. 2 still take piano from a very genteel older lady and my twins are fascinated by classic guitar and have a great teacher.  I do not see Unschooling as NEVER taking a formal class. I know just for me if I wanted to learn to knit I would likely take a basic class in it. But that is just me,<br/>

Neither does mine.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Neither do I.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I doubt the first part is true, and the second part, as concerns this list, will depend on how clearly the advice and ideas will help someone else understand unschooling better.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I only say he is diagnosed as having Aspergers b/c perhaps there are other children Unschooled who are also diagnosed on the Autism Spectrum. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I know why you said it.  I wish you would read the link I included so that you will know why I objected.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My way of seeing things is that there is no real &quot;expert&quot; just different levels of experience. :-) -=-<br/>
<br/>
Different levels of experience can be an important factor in an unschooling discussion, as can be different levels of experience with the list/discussion itself.<br/>
