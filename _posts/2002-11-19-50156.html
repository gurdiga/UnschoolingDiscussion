Yeah, they are especially nice if you sign up under an umbrella school. No <br/>
laws to bother with after that.<br/>
Or you could just be a rebel and ignore the damn things.....:)<br/>

Denese, I live in Hollywood, just south of Fort Lauderdale.  I find people <br/>
generally very receptive to homeschooling here. Haven&#39;t had a problem with <br/>
anyone I meet regarding this, whether I run into them at the park, museum, <br/>
playhouse or whatever. Most resistence I had came from the in laws!!<br/>
