wouldn&#39;t have a little one for her to read to, would you?  &gt;&gt;<br/>

yesss!  but are they patient enough? hmmm.  not the precocious four year old <br/>
who tells her to hurry up and often finishes the word she is sounding out (bc <br/>
he can hear it coming!)...  and the 2yr old wont sit still for her either :) <br/>
... she could read to the new baby but maybe not get such a sense of <br/>
accomplishment, eh?    offering to listen to her myself more may be <br/>
encouraging.  part of her complaints that night though were that she wanted <br/>
to be able to do it without me.  she wanted to be able to cook without me, as <br/>
if not reading is just holding her up in life!  she wants to break free, move <br/>
on!  but also, wants it to happen by magic.  come to think of it, i have a <br/>
tendency to want things that way too...  :)<br/>

Erin,<br/>
We really must be leading parallel lives...I have a 4 yo and 2 yo also.<br/>
That&#39;s who Tabitha reads to, _if_ they will sit still. Tabitha usually keeps<br/>
reading regardless of whether or not her little sisters have trotted off<br/>
somewhere mid-story. I always try to catch her when she&#39;s reading to<br/>
encourage her. She needs boosts of confidence living in her older sister&#39;s<br/>
shadow. Just last night she complained that it took her so long to read<br/>
something (Harry Potter). I asked if she remembered what she read when she<br/>
was finished. She said yes....I explained many kids her age or older are<br/>
forced to read before they&#39;re ready and they don&#39;t remember anything they<br/>
read. That impressed her.<br/>

Well, that would be nice, wouldn&#39;t it? Ha. Sometimes things like reading<br/>
really do just &quot;click&quot; but not always. Tabitha is such a little woman. She<br/>
takes over the computer to pretend it&#39;s her office, complete with phone,<br/>
memo pad, and little sisters for assistants.<br/>

Okay, I&#39;ll tell Tabitha she has a new e-pal. She also likes snail mail so<br/>
she can draw pictures. It&#39;s supposed to be a nice day but I&#39;ll try to get<br/>
her to write to Lynde sometime today.<br/>
<br/>
Later...Valerie</div>
