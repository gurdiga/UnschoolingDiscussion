For homeschoolers/unschoolers who are required to present a curriculum or<br/>
&quot;course of study&quot;  to be approved by a school employee:<br/>
<br/>
Preface:  In CT, filing a notice of intent to homeschool is optional, and<br/>
even for those who choose to do so, the recommendation by leaders of our<br/>
various HS groups has been, in spirit, as follows: Offer them as little as<br/>
you can. If you opt for a portfolio review, keep it as simple as possible.<br/>
The reasoning is that the portfolio review is not a good time to try to show<br/>
the state what a wonderful and thorough job you are doing and, more<br/>
important, those who &quot;show off&quot; lots of work might raise the bar for others<br/>
unnecessarily.<br/>
<br/>
My own advice: <br/>
1. Find out what the school wants or expects from homeschoolers. It should<br/>
be a written policy. Ask to see it. If it seems too demanding or full of<br/>
busywork or otherwise unreasonable, find out if ALL the school kids are<br/>
required to do it all. (if not, they why should you?)<br/>
<br/>
2. The schools are usually required only to OFFER INSTRUCTION. They are not<br/>
required to be sure that everyone (really anyone) actually learns anything.<br/>
If the school requires Passing Grades on tests, ask how many school kids<br/>
passed and how many failed but were promoted anyway (social promotion). The<br/>
point here is that you or your child should not be asked to do any more than<br/>
the least of the school&#39;s students is asked to do.<br/>
<br/>
3. Armed with the above, you can now figure out what would be the least you<br/>
can offer them and still be OK. Offer them that...don&#39;t offer more or you<br/>
might be held to it. Even though you will be doing far more than what is<br/>
required, don&#39;t include it as a requirement or an offering to them.<br/>
<br/>
4. Figure out ahead of time (at the beginning of the &quot;year&quot; how you will<br/>
make your presentation to them at the end. Ask homeschooling friends if they<br/>
will show you what they presented in order to find out how little you can<br/>
present. <br/>
<br/>
All of this is part of the process of learning that living a normal life (as<br/>
opposed to an artificial life of school/schooling) is an educational<br/>
experience. Example:  For a youth, going (walking) to a hardware store to<br/>
buy a part for a bicycle is an experience that&#39;s filled with learning. It<br/>
can, and should count in anyone&#39;s assessment of a child&#39;s achievement.<br/>
Another: Growing a garden of just one or two vegetables is connected to a<br/>
wide variety of knowledge and skills.<br/>
<br/>
Real life is far more &quot;educational&quot; than school can hope to be.  That&#39;s why<br/>
John Holt said things like, The little value that&#39;s contained in a year of<br/>
schooling can be accomplished in a single morning. John Gatto also says that<br/>
everything that&#39;s useful in an entire school career can be learned in about<br/>
fifty hours.<br/>
<br/>
I would go further...everything of value that&#39;s taught in schools IS learned<br/>
incidentally (without even thinking about it) by normally curious children<br/>
growing up with normal access to the real world -- and it requires no<br/>
schooling at all -- not a single moment of it.<br/>
<br/>
Let the children out to play. That&#39;s what they need most, and today it&#39;s<br/>
what they get the least.<br/>
<br/>
Ned Vare<br/>
PS  We all know how absurd it is for people who have opted out of the public<br/>
schools for many good and varied reasons to be required to be judged (or<br/>
even &quot;reviewed&quot;) by the same people who run the schools we reject, distrust,<br/>
and do not respect.  It is a classic case of dumb people somehow gaining<br/>
power over smart people.<br/>
<br/>
In our ongoing struggle for educational freedom, keep in mind that we are<br/>
the people who are educating our children best, and that the public school<br/>
system is the only system that is failing. This is not a battle of<br/>
homeschoolers against public school employees. It is against bad laws and<br/>
irrelevant and stupid regulations, and that battle is being fought in<br/>
legislatures, not schools.</div>
