<div id="ygrps-yiv-523319609">I have another theory about why all this is so common now, and it&#39;s possibly because most people are only eating a few types of foods all the time. Modern diet for most folks seems to rely on corn (esp. corn syrup, corn starch, corn oil), wheat, dairy and eggs. These same foods in their many forms make up the bulk of what people eat. They are also the most<br/>
common food allergens. When the body has to fight off allergens, it weakens the immune system. This is not my theory alone, it comes from the research I&#39;ve done. There are many books describing this problem and suggesting a food rotation diet and just eating a wider variety of new foods so you don&#39;t develop an allergy to them.<br/>
<br/>
Another reason that<br/>
<br/>
Each generation seems weaker than the<br/>
last. With all the nutritional supplements and advances in traditional<br/>
medicine, why is this happening?<br/>
<br/>
could be lack of exercise for most people. Regular exercise can boost your immune system and give you more energy.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; A Natural Way to Boost Your Immune System by Herb Rubin, D. C.<br/>
&gt;      A disturbing question I1m often asked as a health professional is, &quot;I<br/>
&gt; try to eat right, I take supplements, but I just don1t feel healthy. What<br/>
&gt; can I do?&quot; We are seeing a dramatic rise in degenerative, chronic and<br/>
&gt; autoimmune diseases, even in children. Diseases that were once unusual,<br/>
&gt; such as chronic fatigue, severe allergies, asthma, fibromyalgia, diabetes,<br/>
&gt; candidiasis, severe digestive disorders and environmental/chemical<br/>
&gt; sensitivities are becoming common. More people complain of getting<br/>
&gt; recurring colds, flu and infections. Each generation seems weaker than the<br/>
&gt; last. With all the nutritional supplements and advances in traditional<br/>
&gt; medicine, why is this happening?<br/>
&gt; ....<br/>
&gt;        Generally, intestinal toxemia manifests as one or more of the<br/>
&gt; following: fatigue, nervousness, gastrointestinal upset, impaired<br/>
&gt; nutrition, skin problems, circulatory problems, headaches, arthritis,<br/>
&gt; sciatica and low back pain, allergy, asthma, eye, ear, nose and throat<br/>
&gt; disease, heart irregularities, appendicitis, diverticulitis, irritable<br/>
&gt; bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn1s disease, diabetes, psoriasis,<br/>
&gt; high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and pathological changes<br/>
&gt; in the breasts. All of these have responded to therapy directed at a<br/>
&gt; toxemic state in the&#39; intestine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was just diagnosed with asthma (all 3 of my kids have it too) and my<br/>
&gt; &gt; doctor immediatly started talking about me using an inhaled steroid<br/>
&gt; &gt; (something my kids have never had to do). Do any of you know of any more<br/>
&gt; &gt; natural alternatives?<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: spanking<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I want to just start out by being very clear to everyone that I am talking<br/>
&gt; about what we do in ***my*** family here, and I am answering a direct<br/>
&gt; question, so please do not post nasty messages about being &quot;judgmental&quot;.<br/>
&gt; Got it???<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So if you and I were making a tuna salad together and I told you to get<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; mayo and you handed me something else and I said &quot;no I said get me the<br/>
&gt; mayo<br/>
&gt; &gt; not the butter&quot; and you still didn&#39;t do as I asked it would be ok to spank<br/>
&gt; &gt; you for disobeying me?  Why is it ok to spank a child but not an adult who<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t do what I want them to do?  I&#39;m just interested in the response to<br/>
&gt; &gt; this and let&#39;s leave out &quot;but your not my child and we are equals, because<br/>
&gt; &gt; that&#39;s not a real argument)  If the argument is that spanking stops<br/>
&gt; &gt; disobedience then why would children have to be spanked more than once?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First of all, I can&#39;t leave out &quot;you&#39;re not my child&quot; because that is a very<br/>
&gt; real part of the issue.  It is not my job to train my peers, it is my job to<br/>
&gt; train my kids.  I guess we could make an analogy to countries that use<br/>
&gt; physical punishment for criminals,  it is the job of the country to &quot;train&quot;<br/>
&gt; in a sense the citizens.  Or at least the job of the country to keep the<br/>
&gt; citizens inline with the laws.  I have lived in a country that practices<br/>
&gt; physical punishment, and I have to say that there was very little crime<br/>
&gt; there.  The consequences of sure and swift harsh punishment was a deterrent<br/>
&gt; to crime.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t spank my kids because they don&#39;t do what I want them to do, I spank<br/>
&gt; them because they willingly and knowingly break the rules.  We use spanking<br/>
&gt; along with other consequences.  I do not hit my children, there is a<br/>
&gt; difference.  I was abused as a child, so I know full well what beating is.<br/>
&gt; Spanking is not done because I am angry, but as a consequence for actions.<br/>
&gt; Beating is done in anger for often unknown reasons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You asked why kids have to be spanked more than once if it stops<br/>
&gt; disobedience.  We can ask the same thing of any form of correction, can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; we?  Why do you have to put kids in &quot;time out&quot;, ground a teenager, take away<br/>
&gt; a privilege, or give extra work more than once if these are designed to stop<br/>
&gt; disobedience?  They have to be done more than once because it is a long job<br/>
&gt; to teach our children.  Some things they will do once and never again,<br/>
&gt; others they will do over and over.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When we work with our calves to teach them to lead, they do not learn about<br/>
&gt; the halter the fist time we work with them.  It takes a lot of time to teach<br/>
&gt; them that when the halter is on, they go where we want them to go.  We do it<br/>
&gt; by making it uncomfortable for them when they stop, and comfortable for them<br/>
&gt; when they go.  I am not trying to equate children with animals here, just<br/>
&gt; the concept that it takes time to teach.  Once is not enough.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I appreciate your posts Dawn!<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hi everyone!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;This summer we&#39;re taking the kids up to the mountains about once a week.<br/>
&gt; &gt;We&#39;re taking the tent and lunch and &quot;day camping.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;We set up the tent and the baby has a safe place to roll and practice<br/>
&gt; &gt;crawling, we have naptime in there, it&#39;s way cooler than in town.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;We have lunch and snacks there and when it gets dark head back to town.<br/>
&gt; &gt;It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;about 20 degrees cooler up there than down here, so we really enjoy and<br/>
&gt; &gt;look<br/>
&gt; &gt;forward to it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;:-) Diane<br/>

 Kathy in Avon&gt;&gt;  Kathy, I really agree with you.  I found that I cannot <br/>
digest starchy carbohydrates since my last pregnancy.  For years, I had <br/>
symptoms that were getting progressively worse, such as headaches, excessive <br/>
worrying, allergy symptoms, etc.  I always loved chocolate, and dairy, and <br/>
corn, and potatoes, and the taste of white bread.  Earlier this spring I was <br/>
diagnosed with hypoglycemia.  I have had to learn to eat differently, which <br/>
has not been easy by any means, but it has helped me so much.  Incidentally, <br/>
there has been a virus running through our house.  Amazing to me, that I am <br/>
the only one who has not gotten it.  (I should knock on wood now!)  But, I <br/>
can&#39;t help but think my immune system has gotten stronger from making these <br/>
dietary changes, and out of the rest of the family, my nursing baby has had <br/>
the least difficult time, too.  :)  And, I&#39;m sure you are right about <br/>
exercise boosting the immune system.  Take care.  ~Karen</div>

Could you give me some kind of idea what mainly changed in your diet.  You <br/>
sound like me, although I&#39;ve never had &quot;problems&quot; digesting these things, I <br/>
have had bouts of depression since my kids were born and your old favorites <br/>
sound like mine...<br/>
