<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707300594"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: Samantha Stopple &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sammimag@...">sammimag@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Can I have cookies?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yes, after dinner.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But does it mean they(being the kids) are always happy<br/>
&gt; to wait? It&#39;s not my experience even when stated<br/>
&gt; positively.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I try to remember that it&#39;s not my job to keep my kids continously happy. I<br/>
have to make the best decisions I can for things like their safety (and that<br/>
sometimes means real &quot;No&#39;s&quot; - &quot;No, you can&#39;t run into the street&quot;), for<br/>
their health (&quot;Yes, you may eat cookies after dinner&quot;) and for their<br/>
well-being. Sometimes that makes them unhappy, and that is en emotion they<br/>
need to be able to recognize and deal with effectively. So if the kids are<br/>
not happy to wait, I just empathize with them &quot;It&#39;s frustrating to have to<br/>
wait for something you really want now&quot;. I have these frustrations in my own<br/>
life too, and when I don&#39;t acknowledge them, they build to an unhealthy<br/>
point.<br/>
My mantra is &quot;I&#39;m not responsible for my child&#39;s emotions, I am only<br/>
responsible for my reaction to them.&quot; I try really hard to avoid falling<br/>
into my mom&#39;s pitfall, which is that she always wants to &quot;fix&quot; any &quot;bad&quot;<br/>
emotions. She changes the subject or ignores the negative emotion or tries<br/>
to bribe someone out of it. It took me a very long time as an adult to even<br/>
recognize my emotions and be able to acknowledge them as valid.<br/>
So IMHO, along with changing the way we present things, reflection and<br/>
validation of whatever emotions arise are also useful tools.<br/>
