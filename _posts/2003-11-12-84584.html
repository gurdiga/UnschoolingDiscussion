<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036365815">I was reading an article in Prevention magazine and came upon one entitled The Secret to Raising Great Kids by Edward M. Hallowell, M.D. Just wanted to share a small bit of the article.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The secret to raising happy, well adjusted, fun-to-be-with kids who will lead fulfilling lives when they grow up is simply this: Enjoy them. It sounds so simple, and I suppose it is. But an awful lot of parents, teachers, and coaches don&#39;t get it. They turn the process of raising children into an ordeal, which is a grave mistake.<br/>
<br/>
If you enjoy your children, you will be doing right by them, and if you do right by them, they will develop according to their best abilities and instincts.&quot;<br/>

This is sweet!<br/>
<br/>
I read some of the new issue of The Old Schoolhouse, and it&#39;s wonderful to <br/>
see some kinder, gentler advice.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you enjoy your children, you will be doing right by them, and if you do <br/>
right by them, they will develop according to their best abilities and <br/>
instincts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was Mary B. quoting The Secret to Raising Great Kids by Edward M. <br/>
Hallowell, M.D.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to quote some of the Christian article, but it&#39;s too depressing.  <br/>
Never mind.  <br/>
