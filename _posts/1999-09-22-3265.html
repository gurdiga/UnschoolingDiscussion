&gt; Oh that&#39;s why I haven&#39;t gotten it yet. I ordered it three weeks ago<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; Holt and Assoc. ONe for me and, on faith, one for my very<br/>
&gt; antihomeschooling mother-in-law. From the annotation in the HOlt<br/>
&gt; catelogue<br/>
&gt; it sounded like the kind of gently persuasive book she would enjoy<br/>
&gt; reading<br/>
&gt; and find herself agreeing with in spite of herself. I&#39;m just so tired<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; arguing with someone who is uninformed. I was surprised she agreed to<br/>
&gt; read<br/>
&gt; something about homeschooling b/c she is so absolutely certain that we<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; ruining our children&#39;s lives and that schools are the one and only<br/>
&gt; way.<br/>
&gt; So, Iguess I&#39;m putting a lot of stock in your book as the first book<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; ever read on the subject! If she&#39;s willing after reading your book,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; send her some of Holt&#39;s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve loved everything you&#39;ve said so far in this chat group and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; looking forward to your book.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for your kind words. I promise, really I promise, that the<br/>
book will be gentle.  I&#39;m a Friend (Quaker) -- we try to work hard at it<br/>
(even though sometimes we fail.)  I wrote the book thinking of elderly<br/>
aunt who wants to know what I think I am doing with her darling nieces<br/>
(and would report me to whomever if they weren&#39;t thriving so well!)<br/>
Seriously, I&#39;ve given a lot of thought to making the book accessible to<br/>
doubters.<br/>
<br/>
