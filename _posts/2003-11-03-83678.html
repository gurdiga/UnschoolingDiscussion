<div id="ygrps-yiv-204301342">I have alwasy been an avid reader and when I was in middle school I started <br/>
having a terrible time with reading.   By highschool I would get really tired <br/>
or terrible headaches from reading.   My mother took me to a handful of doctors <br/>
before a optometrist (please correct my spelling) that had the same problem <br/>
helped me.   I can&#39;t remember what it is called, but I have perfect vision, but <br/>
when I read my eyes have a problem with focus.   I just broke my glasses that <br/>
I&#39;ve had for 13 years and I have to get new ones and have no idea what my <br/>
prescription should be.   But, I had invisible bifocals with just enough of <br/>
difference to fix the problem.   It was amazing how well they worked.   I&#39;m having <br/>
problems since my glasses broke =)<br/>
