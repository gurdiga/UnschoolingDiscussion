Since I&#39;m assuming you don&#39;t have a Mac with AppleWorks, I tried translating<br/>
it into a number of standard PC spreadsheet formats. When I tried<br/>
translating it back to AppleWorks, the formulas had all turned into ERRORs.<br/>
So I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the Mac-to-PC translation that&#39;s failing or the<br/>
PC-to-Mac. I could try sending it to you in a number of formats and you and<br/>
your son could try messing around with it to see if it might work.<br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;d also need to be able to use TrueType fonts or monkey around with<br/>
trying to get the English to match up with the kana. Maybe there&#39;s a<br/>
standard correspondence (eg, F=ba and Q=da and so on) in which case it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t matter. But I do have a kana font set that has them in a different<br/>
order :-/<br/>
<br/>
It might be a whole lot easier to see if you can find something on the<br/>
internet!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, katakana. It&#39;s used for foreign words and -- guessing from Pokemon<br/>
names! -- made up words too. (Though the Japanese names include lots of<br/>
foreign references.)<br/>
<br/>
But, to use the spreadsheet he&#39;d need to know it anyway. The program is more<br/>
of a way to double check if we&#39;re translating properly and a way to write<br/>
kana so my daughter can cut and paste it into something else.<br/>
<br/>
A good book that has just the kanas is Kana Pict-o-Graphix<br/>

by Michael Rowley. Each page has one syllable and the corresponding hiragana<br/>
and katakana. But the best thing is that he turns each symbol into a picture<br/>
that relates to the sound it makes. So he&#39;s turned the hiragana symbol for<br/>
&quot;to&quot; into a toe with a thorn in it and the katakana into a bird&#39;s toe. He&#39;s<br/>
a book designer and illustrator (who studied Japanese in Japan) so his<br/>
illustrations are just right :-) It&#39;s pricey for such a tiny thing at $6 but<br/>
we&#39;ve used it loads. (Of course being tiny it&#39;s easily lost too!)<br/>
<br/>
His Kanji Pict-o-Graphix<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0962813702/qid=1022332686/sr=1-1/ref=">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0962813702/qid=1022332686/sr=1-1/ref=</a><br/>
sr_1_1/002-9667572-1150460<br/>
<br/>
does the same for Kanji. He has over 1000 kanji grouped by common graphic<br/>
elements. So on one page are 7 kanji that include the kanji for sun. Each<br/>
changes the kanji into a picture that relates to its meaning. So the kanji<br/>
that means clear, bright has a sun and a candle (that looks like the bottom<br/>
part of the kanji) and a sentence &quot;The sun and candle shine clear and bright<br/>
light.&quot; At the beginning of the book he also includes that graphics for the<br/>
kana. (Some are different than in his Kana Pict-o-Graphix.) You don&#39;t really<br/>
need both if you get the Kanji Pict-o-Graphix.<br/>
<br/>
If he wanted to go beyond those Kanji, there&#39;s Remembering the Kanji: A<br/>
complete course on how not to forget the meaning and writing of Japanese<br/>
characters by James W. Heisig. It&#39;s a lot more wordy and takes more effort<br/>
but the stories and mnemonics can be effective. (We haven&#39;t actually gotten<br/>
very far with any except the Kana book.)<br/>
<br/>
Part 1: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/4889960759/qid=1022333252/sr=1-1/ref=">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/4889960759/qid=1022333252/sr=1-1/ref=</a><br/>
sr_1_1/002-9667572-1150460 which covers over 2000 kanji<br/>
<br/>
Part 2: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0870407481/qid=1022333252/sr=1-2/ref=">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0870407481/qid=1022333252/sr=1-2/ref=</a><br/>
sr_1_2/002-9667572-1150460 which covers I believe the pronounciation of the<br/>
kanji<br/>
<br/>
Part 3: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/087040931X/qid=1022333611/sr=1-3/ref=">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/087040931X/qid=1022333611/sr=1-3/ref=</a><br/>
sr_1_3/002-9667572-1150460 which covers some more for advanced students<br/>
<br/>
And if he wants a dictionary to try to look up kanji, a useful one is The<br/>
Compact Neslon. What it does is break all the kanji down by radical, of<br/>
which there are 214. And each of those radicals is grouped by the number of<br/>
strokes it contains. Which sounds confusing, but is actually very easy. And<br/>
mathematical too :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Could you try sending it to us, too. Last year, Rosie went to a 10 week <br/>
summer Japanese language and culture activity - once a week for half days. <br/>
She LOVED it. Her friends go there every Saturday during the school year, for <br/>
Japanese language instruction and Rosie would love to go, but she also loves <br/>
soccer and her games are always on Saturday mornings, too. During the summer, <br/>
they do just a little language instruction and more cultural-awareness <br/>
activities. This is run by the Japanese Center - it is really intended for <br/>
children of Japanese families living in the US or Japanese-American kids, but <br/>
they fully welcome my daughter even though we aren&#39;t Japanese. She&#39;s planning <br/>
to go again this year and has had her materials out, going over them.<br/>
<br/>
Rosie&#39;s sister, Roxana, is 14 and has been learning Norwegian, on her own <br/>
because finding a Norwegian tutor has turned out to be impossible, so far. <br/>
She has a very close online friend who is Norwegian - that&#39;s where the <br/>
interest started. But she&#39;s ALWAYS loved Norse mythology, too. Roxana has a <br/>
real talent for languages and wants to take a foreign language class at the <br/>
community college in the fall - she wanted German or Italian (she&#39;s an opera <br/>
buff), but our little college teaches only French, Spanish, Chinese and <br/>
Japanese. So I don&#39;t know what she&#39;ll do. If anybody has any ideas about how <br/>
to find a Norwegian tutor, I&#39;d like to hear them. There are not a lot of <br/>
Norwegians around in Southern California.<br/>
<br/>
My husband, who is Iranian, is bewildered by the interest in Japanese and <br/>
Norwegian. He can&#39;t see why the kids aren&#39;t more interested in learning <br/>
either Spanish (which is the dominant language in our area) or Persian <br/>
(Farsi), which is his own language.  Any suggestions for how to explain to <br/>
him that there is good reason NOT to dissuade the kids from their OWN <br/>
interests in choosing to learn a foreign language?<br/>
