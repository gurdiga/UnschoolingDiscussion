<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551799294">I thought I&#39;d introduced myself to the group.  <br/>
I&#39;m Julie, sahm to Paul and wife of Chip.  We live in Missouri.  Paul <br/>
is 15 months old.<br/>
<br/>
I found John Holt through a question I asked on Mothering.com.  I <br/>
really enjoy his books, and his way of viewing how children learn.  I <br/>
look forward to learning more and talking with you all.<br/>

I enjoy John Holt&#39;s writings a lot, and Deb Lewis who&#39;s on the list  <br/>
but usually quiet is some kind of expert. &lt;g&gt;  (Like if this were  <br/>
Farenheit 451, she would be John Holt, or at least Teach Your Own or  <br/>
something.)<br/>
<br/>
That said, though, there are some things about John Holt we can&#39;t  <br/>
change and should remember.  He was childless, and he never  <br/>
unschooled anybody. &lt;g&gt;  He did encourage a lot of people and cheer  <br/>
them on and coach them, though!  And we try to do that here, too.   <br/>
You can throw any old questions or concerns out here and people will  <br/>
help you pick and sort through.  Real situations are better than  <br/>
hypotheticals, but if the hypothetical is useful and interesting, it  <br/>
might be okay.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It depends&quot; is the answer to lots of things, and then we can discuss  <br/>
it some more!<br/>
