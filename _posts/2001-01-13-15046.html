&gt;  INTERIOR NOMINEE BILLED ALASKA FOR ASSISTANCE TO PRIVATE GROUP<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Arizona Republic<br/>
&gt; Interior nominee billed Alaska for assistance to private group<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Associated Press<br/>
&gt; Jan. 12, 2001 10:30:00<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; WASHINGTON - Gale Norton billed the Alaska Legislature $270 an hour last<br/>
year<br/>
&gt; to help overturn a fishing policy of the Interior Department that she&#39;s<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; chosen to run. Billing records also show she charged the state for help<br/>
she<br/>
&gt; gave a private group in the case.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Alaska Democrats and environmentalists are questioning why Norton would<br/>
ask<br/>
&gt; Alaska&#39;s taxpayers to pay for her to assist the Mountain States Legal<br/>
&gt; Foundation, a group she once worked for that has sued the Interior<br/>
Department<br/>
&gt; repeatedly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I would be concerned about us spending Alaska money to help another<br/>
&gt; organization outside the state put their views forward,&quot; Democratic state<br/>
&gt; Rep. Al Kookesh said Thursday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I&#39;d think that would be highly inappropriate,&quot; Carl Pope, executive<br/>
director<br/>
&gt; of the Sierra Club, said Friday. &quot;State government is not an ideological<br/>
tool<br/>
&gt; of the Mountain States Legal Foundation.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Republican lawmakers and a Norton spokeswoman said the billings were<br/>
proper<br/>
&gt; because the group was supporting the Legislature&#39;s position in the same<br/>
case.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bill records obtained by The Associated Press show Norton was paid more<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; $60,000 last year by Alaska lawmakers to help write a friend-of-the-court<br/>
&gt; brief in a federal lawsuit opposing Interior Department oversight of<br/>
fishing<br/>
&gt; in Alaska.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The work is part of the legal and lobbying activities she performed after<br/>
&gt; ending her tenure as Colorado attorney general in 1999. The work is under<br/>
&gt; review by senators for possible conflicts of interest. Norton was named<br/>
last<br/>
&gt; month as Bush&#39;s choice to head the Interior Department, which manages the<br/>
&gt; nation&#39;s vast natural resources from national parks to offshore oil<br/>
deposits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The billing records show Norton charged Alaska at least 18 times to help<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; legal foundation file its brief in the case. The records charge for such<br/>
&gt; items as eight hours for &quot;revisions to Mountain States Legal Foundation<br/>
&gt; brief&quot; and 1.2 hours to &quot;review and comment on final draft of Mountain<br/>
States<br/>
&gt; Legal Foundation amicus&quot; and make a phone call.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Norton&#39;s spokeswoman, Jeanie Mamo, said Norton charged Alaska for helping<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; foundation because she had enlisted the group&#39;s help on the state&#39;s<br/>
behalf.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;She worked with them on the amicus brief on behalf of the state,&quot; Mamo<br/>
said<br/>
&gt; Thursday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another lawyer who worked with Norton said the billings were proper. Paul<br/>
&gt; Lenzini said Norton&#39;s assistance to the foundation supported the state&#39;s<br/>
&gt; position in the case.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;To the extent that the Mountain States brief was better and sharper after<br/>
&gt; she reviewed it, she served the interests of the state,&quot; Lenzini said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Alaska House Speaker Brian Porter, one of the GOP legislative leaders who<br/>
&gt; hired Norton, said he was not bothered by the billings for her work with<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; foundation. &quot;We&#39;re happy,&quot; Porter said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Norton&#39;s Denver firm, Brownstein, Hyatt & Farber, has represented a<br/>
company<br/>
&gt; that tried to develop an Indian casino regulated by the Interior<br/>
Department<br/>
&gt; and a company seeking the department&#39;s approval to drill for oil off<br/>
&gt; California&#39;s coast, records show.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mamo said Norton would &quot;follow the law in every case&quot; where she might have<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; conflict of interest. Federal ethics laws require officials to stay out of<br/>
&gt; decisions that could benefit them or their families financially.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Norton&#39;s ties to the Mountain States Legal Foundation are often cited by<br/>
&gt; environmentalists who oppose her nomination. She was a foundation lawyer<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; 1979 until 1983, hired by James Watt, an Interior secretary under<br/>
president<br/>
&gt; Reagan who was anathema to environmentalists.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The foundation has sued the Interior Department repeatedly in recent<br/>
years,<br/>
&gt; seeking to overturn restrictions on mining, grazing and off-road vehicle<br/>
use<br/>
&gt; on federal land. Twenty-three leaders of environmental, labor and civil<br/>
&gt; rights groups held a news conference Friday to kick off what they hope<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; be a multimillion-dollar advertising and public pressure campaign to<br/>
persuade<br/>
&gt; senators to reject Norton&#39;s nomination. They said Norton&#39;s views and ties<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; groups like Mountain States show she is &quot;fundamentally out of step with<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; American people,&quot; as Pope put it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The fishing case is the second major environmental controversy in Alaska<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; involve Norton. While a top Interior Department lawyer during the Reagan<br/>
&gt; administration, Norton advocated drilling for oil in the Arctic National<br/>
&gt; Wildlife Refuge - a position Bush supports but environmentalists oppose.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the fishing case, Alaska is challenging a ruling that said the Interior<br/>
&gt; Department has the right to regulate subsistence fishing in most Alaska<br/>
&gt; waters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The state argues that such federal regulations infringe on the state&#39;s<br/>
right<br/>
&gt; to regulate fishing in its territory. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of<br/>
Appeals<br/>
&gt; heard arguments in September but has not ruled.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GOP legislative leaders decided to make their arguments to the appeals<br/>
court<br/>
&gt; because they didn&#39;t trust Gov. Tony Knowles, a Democrat, to represent<br/>
&gt; lawmakers&#39; point of view fully, Porter said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But Democrats cried foul when the GOP leaders waited until October, after<br/>
&gt; Norton and Lenzini had finished their work, to get formal approval for the<br/>
&gt; state contract. Alaska House Minority Leader Ethan Berkowitz called the<br/>
move<br/>
&gt; &quot;an abuse of legislative discretion.&quot;<br/>
