<div id="ygrps-yiv-975142194">This is our first year of homeschooling/unschooling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My son (10) left his alternative
waldorf-esque school a month before the end of the school year last year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter (8) finished out the year at the
local public school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deschooling and the
early stages of unschooling have been going well. Ups and downs for sure but so
much learning and living going on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It’s
been really exciting.

<p class="ygrps-yiv-975142194MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-975142194MsoNormal">My son seems lonely though.<span style="">&nbsp; Recently </span>he says he misses his friends or sometimes
says that he doesn’t have any friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I seems he does not have any friends that he really connects with –
no best friends I guess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has two kids
that he sees pretty regularly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One is a
neighbor but t<span style=""></span>he friendship is a bit on again off again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes they see each other several times a
day and then they don’t talk for a couple of weeks. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The other friend is a former school mate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were good friends at school but out of school they have had trouble
getting along sometimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This boy slept
over recently and although the other boy seemed to have fun and my son said he
had fun there were lots of moments of tension. <br></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-975142194MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-975142194MsoNormal">My son has never had a lot of friends and when at school he talked about feeling left out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had
a couple of good friendships that<span style=""></span> faded
partly through moves and school changes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span> I think he also misses having more casual connections with kids at school - kids he 
might play with at recess but 
never really wanted to play with outside of school.</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-975142194MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-975142194MsoNormal">My son is a quirky kid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is bright and funny and sweet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Very sensitive, creative, very verbal.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=""></span>He is interested in
science, technology, history.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
likes to swim and draw and make things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is passionate about video
games – spends a lot of time playing games, designing games and graphics for
games, watching lets plays, listening to podcasts about games
etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He does not like violent movies or most violent video games.</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-975142194MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-975142194MsoNormal">He has trouble finding kids with his interests.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Most kids in our community<span style=""> </span>are limited in their
‘screen time’.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They all play games but do not have the amount of access to computers that he does and many express that there is something wrong with spending too much
time in front of screens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My son is
sometimes teased by kids for ‘only’ being interested in video games.&nbsp; Most boys we know are also team sports players - especially hockey - which he is not interested in.<br></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-975142194MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-975142194MsoNormal">His sensitivity and quirkiness can be a challenge in friendships<span style="">.&nbsp; </span>He
can’t stand to be teased and will lose his temper when he feels
disrespected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Often he does not like to
play with groups of kids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>E.g tag can be a
huge challenge as he likes the idea of it but&nbsp; does not really like being
‘it’ and gets very upset by any rule breaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other day he went to the park and came home upset that kids –including a former good friend
- were teasing him about his purple crocs, his teddy bear (which he has started
carrying everywhere), and his lack of math ability which came up in relation to video game creation. <br></p><p class="ygrps-yiv-975142194MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-975142194MsoNormal">His father and I have not always
been (and are not always) as sensitive as we could be in helping him and
connecting with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are still
working at this, trying to understand his personality and find ways to support
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He sometimes expresses that we do not listen to him or do not care about his interests.&nbsp; His school experiences – he went to
school or daycare at least part time from age one – were often not good and there is a lot
healing that needs to happen.</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-975142194MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-975142194MsoNormal">I think he needs to meet some new kids but he is
reluctant to join any activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also think he
needs support in expressing his sensitivity without pushing
other kids away.&nbsp; <span style=""></span>He may need to learn
to make some compromises in order to have friendships.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is very interested in sharing his
passions but is not always interested in listening to his friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He talks in a lot of technical detail about things that others, 
including his family, have trouble following and then gets upset with others for not paying attention or caring. He also can be unwilling to join in with
things his friends like to do if those things aren’t his favourite things. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>For example, one friend does not have a Wii and loves to play Mario Kart when he comes over. But my son,
who sometimes likes the game, never wants to play with his friend and will get quite upset with his friend for even asking to play. <br></p><br>Sorry this is so long. I am really interested in any ideas
 to help my son be happier and so I am trying to give enough context but maybe I have given too much.<br><br><p class="ygrps-yiv-975142194MsoNormal">Stacey<br></p>

He is 12 and he much rather be home or with us.<br><br>What I do is to be his friend! I am the person who is interested in his video games and other interests. I am the person who he comes to talk about and show things.&nbsp;<br><br>He has taken &nbsp;to caring for our barn cats and I not only support him but I help him. I will get the food ready for him to take to them. We talk about the cats.We take care of sick cats.&nbsp;<br>If I am not home he can do it all himself. He just likes to have someone to share it with<br><br>I have been worried about him and friends but &nbsp;he is happy and content and doing what he likes.<br>He plays with his sister and likes &nbsp;to play with her a bit everyday &nbsp;but then he is happy to do his thing and share them with me.<br><br>When he is interested in something I learn a bit along with him or on my own so I can have a good conversation with him and learn more about him.<br><br>He has been very interested in the middle ages so I joined the SCA with him. We do not do much but have gone to a couple events and archery practice. But I keep &nbsp;an eye in the group and talk to people so I can let him know what is happening and do things with him he enjoys.<br><br>Your son is not alone if he has you , the family, as friends.&nbsp;<br><br>Having said that &nbsp;if your son is interested in making friends find ways that he can meet kids that like what he likes. If he does better with one kid do one kid at a time. Don&#39;t do groups.<br><br>Find other gamers an invite them to play. Get into the Unschooling Gamers group and &nbsp;connect him to other kids that like the same games. Skype is awesome. My daughter has many friends she Skypes daily and they are her &nbsp;best friends!<br><br>Now do not get so invested in &quot;NON-violent games&quot; No video game is violent. They are pixels and fiction/stories.<br>&nbsp;I can tell you as a mom of a gamer who sometimes plays some games people call violent that those games are a ton lot of fun! <br>I myself am scared of guns and LOVE to &nbsp;shoot stuff in games. It is a hoot. Does not make me or my son violent at all. :)<br><br>&nbsp;</div><div></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-818865443yui_3_16_0_1_1429216933408_5021">&nbsp;</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-818865443signature" id="ygrps-yiv-818865443yui_3_16_0_1_1429216933408_7579"><div id="ygrps-yiv-818865443yui_3_16_0_1_1429216933408_7578"><font face="courier">Alex Polikowsky</font></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.polykow.blogspot.com/"></a>&nbsp;</div></div>  <br><div class="ygrps-yiv-818865443qtdSeparateBR"><br><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-818865443yahoo_quoted" style="display:block;"> <div style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"> <div style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"> <div dir="ltr"> <font size="2" face="Arial"> On Thursday, April 16, 2015 1:41 PM, &quot;staceyraeme@...

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234626538">-=-Now do not get so invested in &quot;NON-violent games&quot; No video game is violent. They are pixels and fiction/stories.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Glad Alex brought that up.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/violence">http://sandradodd.com/violence</a> is worth looking at, especially for mothers of boys.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of kids at school don&#39;t have a friend, but they have lots of reminders, all day, that they don&#39;t have a special best friend.  And worse, many have minor enemies, or tormentors.   Let it go, keep him distracted, help him be a good host when he has another kid over, and remember that he&#39;s older every day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305538751">&lt;&lt;What I do is to be his friend! I am the person who is interested in his video games and other interests. I am the person who he comes to talk about and show things.&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Alex wrote that.  I couldn&#39;t agree more.  My son and I are good friends.  He&#39;s twelve now. Just yesterday I was making him a snack while he was playing a game, and as I walked by his chair I told him I really cherished our friendship.  He looked away from the game he was playing, directly at me, smiled and said &quot;Yeah&quot; in a simply warm way that told me he felt the same.  <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe there&#39;s a connection between:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He is very interested in sharing his passions but is not always interested in listening to his friends.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;He sometimes expresses that we do not listen to him or do not care about his interests.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It hasn&#39;t always been easy for me to listen to Ethan as he enthusiastically fills me in on all the details of whatever it is that&#39;s caught his imagination.  He goes into a lot of details!  It&#39;s still not easy sometimes, especially when I&#39;m tired, or distracted, or stressed.  But in the back of my mind I remind myself that by giving Ethan my full attention as often as I can I am investing in our relationship and in his wellbeing.  So far, I can say with confidence that it has been time and energy well spent.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve learned a lot about Ethan from listening to him, from sharing in his interests, and being someone he can trust, talk easily to, and depend on for support and guidance if he needs it.  In learning to be the best friend to Ethan that I can be, I&#39;ve become a better friend to my husband, to others, and, most surprisingly, to myself.  I believe Ethan has learned a lot from our interactions as well--from seeing what it looks like to be a good friend, and from feeling what it feels like to receive the gift of true friendship.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought of this post as I read today&#39;s Just Add Light and Stir.  I think it and the link that accompanies it might be very helpful.<br/>

I very much agree that the family SHOULD be that child&#39;s everything as long as he wants that, and he will eventually want to branch out to other contacts.  He&#39;s young, school is artificial, we don&#39;t have a good model for what we&#39;re doing, but if he&#39;s complained that he needs more attention, that&#39;s what he needs and it would&#39;ve been nice if he had never needed to say so.<br/>
<br/>
When a kid&#39;s getting too much attention, the parents will be informed, too. :-)<br/>

we&#39;re doing, but if he&#39;s complained that he needs more attention, that&#39;s
 what he needs and it would&#39;ve been nice if he had never needed to say 
so&quot; and also your earlier advice to let it go and distract him seem so straightforwardly profound to me.&nbsp; Simple words but so much in them and exactly what I need to hear and act on.<br></p><p><br></p></div>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1910802942MsoNormal">I have been thinking about how to help him connect with kids
online but am not totally sure it is for him right now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I joined the unschooling gamers
group and at first my son was excited about the idea but then he wasn’t sure that he wanted to
contact other kids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is
especially nervous about skyping with people he doesn’t know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he seems to be not completely sure why he would want to.&nbsp; He has played a few games with others and sometimes plays online with me or his sister but often he prefers to explore things on his own.&nbsp; I am not sure if I should be supporting or encouraging him to find friends online or just letting it go - as I write this out I am thinking the latter.<br></p></div>

My daughter is always either chatting, messaging or on instagram with friends.<br><br>It is OK to not want to. My son does not. He likes to tell me about his gaming. &nbsp;He also invites his sister ( who is 9 by the way) to play with him or to just simply play his games while he watched and helps her.<br>So his sister is a play partner and he is happy with that too.<br><br><br></span></div><div></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-246546368yui_3_16_0_1_1429542764471_7354">&nbsp;</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-246546368signature" id="ygrps-yiv-246546368yui_3_16_0_1_1429542764471_9865"><div id="ygrps-yiv-246546368yui_3_16_0_1_1429542764471_9864"><font face="courier" id="ygrps-yiv-246546368yui_3_16_0_1_1429542764471_9863">Alex Polikowsky</font></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-246546368yui_3_16_0_1_1429542764471_12375">&nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-246546368yui_3_16_0_1_1429542764471_12376"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.polykow.blogspot.com/"></a>&nbsp;</div></div>  <br><div class="ygrps-yiv-246546368qtdSeparateBR"><br><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-246546368yahoo_quoted" style="display:block;"> <div style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"> <div style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"> <div dir="ltr"> <font size="2" face="Arial"> On Sunday, April 19, 2015 10:38 PM, &quot;staceyraeme@...

group and at first my son was excited about the idea but then he wasn’t sure that he wanted to
contact other kids.<span>&nbsp; </span>He is
especially nervous about skyping with people he doesn’t know.<span>&nbsp; </span>And he seems to be not completely sure why he would want to.&nbsp; He has played a few games with others and sometimes plays online with me or his sister but often he prefers to explore things on his own.&nbsp; I am not sure if I should be supporting or encouraging him to find friends online or just letting it go - as I write this out I am thinking the latter.<br clear="none"></div>
