<div id="ygrps-yiv-952564464">OK, I think I have this figured out.  I just did a test with someone outside of my home and we managed to make it work.  I hope it works tomorrow!<br/>
<br/>
Interested kids are invited to an AIM buddy chat Wednesday, Oct 8, 11 AM Pacific time.<br/>
<br/>
The chat will be called KidsChat<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t find the chat, send an AIM to melonary and I will AIM back an invitation.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who would like to be invited at the beginning of the chat, send your AIM screen name to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:nellebelle@...">nellebelle@...</a> with KidsChat in the subject line.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have AIM, you can download it free at AOL.com<br/>
