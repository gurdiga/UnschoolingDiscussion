<br/>
Does anyone else get asked, in ever such a nice, concerned, caring voice<br/>
&quot;Are you sure you&#39;re doing the right thing for your kids by<br/>
homeschooling them?&quot; This has got to be my most hated question of all,<br/>
from all my 14 years of homeschooling. It is soooo rude. Do they really<br/>
think I&#39;m such a creep I&#39;d do it if I didn&#39;t think it was for the best?<br/>
But I&#39;ve perfected the answer:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh hell, no! But you know those little $#@%&s made me suffer so much in<br/>
childbirth that I decided there and then that I&#39;d make them suffer too!<br/>
So I keep them home and deprive them of all that neat stuff at school<br/>
just to pay them back for all that childbirth pain. I torture them<br/>
daily, and I beat them several times a week to remind them what will<br/>
happen when we get home if they don&#39;t look real happy when we&#39;re out.<br/>
Yes sir, I&#39;m having a wonderful time making them pay for all that pain&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I finally pause to draw breath, the questioner invariably blushes<br/>
and says &quot;I guess that was a silly question, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; And sometimes<br/>
we even go on to have a meaningful discussion about education!<br/>
