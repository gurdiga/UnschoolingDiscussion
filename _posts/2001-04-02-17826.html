<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020097159">Hi Bobbie,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve looked at a book, didn&#39;t buy it.  The amount they listed that was<br/>
&quot;ok&quot; for children if they needed it was I think 45 mg a day.  He uses a<br/>
product called Provex-Plus, made by Melaleuca.  It has 10 mg of Ginkgo<br/>
Bilboa Extra leaves.  I had heard somewhere that in Europe they don&#39;t<br/>
give children Ginkgo, I don&#39;t know exactly why.   I do know that<br/>
Melaleuca is very careful about what they make available so I assume it<br/>
is safe for children to have 20 mg or it would be listened on the bottle <br/>
that it wasn&#39;t. It also has Bilberry and Grape Skin and Grape Skin. <br/>
I know families that have their child on two of these capsules a day<br/>
plus <br/>
the vitabears and are able to take their child off Ritalin.  My son is<br/>
almost<br/>
7 and weighs about 45 pounds.   Good luck,<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Sherry</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437540504">woo hoo! I love melaleuca! My family joined the<br/>
melaleuca craze when I was 13. Heeh, so did my<br/>
boyfriend&#39;s and him and his sister can smell anything<br/>
with the oil in it from miles away and scream &quot;no!<br/>
melaleuca! someone has melaleuca!&quot;...:)...<br/>
my kids were taking the vitabears for awhile and and I<br/>
really liked them. I&#39;ll have to look into the gingko<br/>
stuff, thanks alot for the info. And bythe way, from<br/>
the sounds of it, your son is a skinny boy like mine.<br/>
Do you get a hard time about it? People saying he<br/>
needs to eat more? &quot;put some meat on those bones&quot;,<br/>
etc?<br/>
