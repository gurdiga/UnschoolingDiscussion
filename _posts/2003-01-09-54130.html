I think the people who push it are irritating, and they refuse to tell actual <br/>
stories about their families.   The philosophy is tied up heavily in <br/>
libertarianism.   I think the main proponent is English and wants to own guns <br/>
(seems, I haven&#39;t hunted down background details because I don&#39;t care), and <br/>
we used to get an occasional visit from one of them who would come to <br/>
unschooling lists but then witheringly tell us we were disrespectful of our <br/>
children because we were telling stories about them.<br/>

can see that in such a medium as the internet our children *will*<br/>
perhaps be reading our words about them someday, as perhaps will<br/>
their future companions and employers.<br/>

<br/>
What bothered me about it was that many of the solutions seemed to<br/>
turn into the same kind of male dominated opinions/solutions that I<br/>
would get from the mainstream press. A baby who rejects the breast<br/>
at nine months is voluntarily giving up nursing, they didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
want to understand or explore the whole mother/child nursing dynamic<br/>
and include that dynamic in the solution -- that sort of thing. I<br/>
also don&#39;t believe that one should let a child hurt a small animal<br/>
in the home while exploring the child&#39;s &quot;preferences&quot;. Sorry, just<br/>
can&#39;t get past that one. <br/>
<br/>
In many ways the whole TCS theory gives me the same sort of feeling<br/>
that I get from people who believe that science has all the answers.<br/>
Science is only as good as the data and the analysis and the mind<br/>
bias of the person with the theory. All three of these can be<br/>
flawed. There is no absolute truth because we don&#39;t have all the<br/>
data: the universe is still a mystery. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad that some people are thinking about these things in<br/>
different ways and trying to find solutions that don&#39;t automatically<br/>
put the child to blame.<br/>

Her right to want to.<br/>

She can move to the U.S. and own lots of them!<br/>

<br/>
Me too.  <br/>
<br/>
I think they&#39;re coming from a different tradition.  Unschooling is coming <br/>
from John Holt&#39;s being from a time when teachers were moving toward anecdotal <br/>
writings, and so he was telling stories of real students, and from La Leche <br/>
League, which CERTAINLY depends on mothers sharing real experiences about <br/>
real children.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t show anyone how unschooling works without telling them stories from <br/>
our lives.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I<br/>
can see that in such a medium as the internet our children *will*<br/>
perhaps be reading our words about them someday, as perhaps will<br/>
their future companions and employers.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids read my stuff all the want to now.  I&#39;m not hiding anything from them.<br/>
<br/>
There is some AMAZING stuff being put out by kids themselves, on some journal <br/>
sites.  Enough to keep them from getting jobs.  I don&#39;t know if employers <br/>
could find it without knowing their nicknames or whatever, but it&#39;s out <br/>
there.  One teen I didn&#39;t trust much already has posted enough stuff that if <br/>
he EVER were to hurt one of my kids I could take that to a judge or social <br/>
worker and probably get at least a restraining order, if not a lockup.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel the things I&#39;m telling about my children would do anything but <br/>
make people have more confidence in them than they already do.<br/>

someone about NCP and went to the website.  The first thing we see is a <br/>
picture of this person pointing a gun at us!  Our intial reaction definitely <br/>
included a feeling of coersion!<br/>
