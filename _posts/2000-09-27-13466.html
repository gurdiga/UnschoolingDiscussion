<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577694436">My kids are likely to say &quot;I don&#39;t go to school,&quot; which causes the direction <br/>
of the conversation to change.  As long as the questions are &quot;what grade are <br/>
you in?&quot; or &quot;How do you like having your mom be your teacher?&quot; and such, the <br/>
other person is controlling the dialog.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids have said, &quot;I don&#39;t have a teacher--I learn from everybody,&quot; and <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s like a big field trip&quot; or &quot;We play a lot,&quot; and those are all good <br/>
answers as far as I&#39;m concerned.<br/>

oldest is a rascal and said something like &#39;depends on which day you ask me, <br/>
she can be hard to get along with&#39;.  This usually got a laugh from the adult <br/>
when they figured out mom was the teacher.<br/>
