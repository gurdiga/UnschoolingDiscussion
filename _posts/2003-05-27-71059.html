<div id="ygrps-yiv-689124343">My daughter went to camp this weekend.  Since she was alone (most everyone <br/>
had siblings or long time friends with them. she was to share a tent with <br/>
the owner and an older teenage girl.  As luck would have it, it began <br/>
raining and hailing around 11pm.  They have a shed-type building with a <br/>
large covered patio area.  Everyone grabbed their sleeping bags an slept <br/>
under the covered patio.  Everyone except Haleigh (12) and a 14 yr old boy.  <br/>
They slept in the shed.  She said the doors were open out to where everyone <br/>
else was sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
I tried not to let my head run wild but it really bothered me.  I casually <br/>
asked some questions and it sounded like it was no big deal so I did my best <br/>
to put it out of my mind, though I was and still am bothered that the owner <br/>
would have allowed that without my permission or bothering to tell me <br/>
afterwards.  Haleigh said they didn&#39;t exchange numbers or anything so it <br/>
really didn&#39;t seem to be a big deal at all.<br/>
<br/>
Well, today I was looking for a real estate agents number I had dialed on my <br/>
cell phone and came across a number I didn&#39;t recognize.  When I asked <br/>
Haleigh about it, she said it was this boy&#39;s number and she had called him.  <br/>
Twice.  We talked about her lying to me and telling me she didn&#39;t exchange <br/>
numbers with him.  I didn&#39;t really feel good about it afterwards though.  <br/>
She seemed to dismiss everything I was saying like it was no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I saw that she tried to call him today and told her that he was probably in <br/>
school.  She said he was suspended for fighting with his teacher.  She said <br/>
she didn&#39;t know more than that.<br/>
<br/>
So, now I&#39;m really bothered.  My husband is freaking out about them staying <br/>
in the shed together.  I told him I wasn&#39;t worried about them having sex, <br/>
that I didn&#39;t feel like Haleigh was &#39;there&#39; at all.  His reply was that I <br/>
obviously know nothing about 14 year old boys, especially public schooled <br/>
boys on suspension.  He thinks this boy is BAD news.<br/>
<br/>
Safe to say that now I am doing everything in my power not to lose my mind.  <br/>
I want to be level headed about it but I&#39;m feeling a though I can&#39;t trust <br/>
her now.  This camp is a monthy camp and she wants to go back next month.  <br/>
Now I don&#39;t even want her to go.  Am I wrong?  I don&#39;t even know where to <br/>
begin in trying to handle this situation.    I don&#39;t want to be way too <br/>
overprotective but at the same time, I don&#39;t want to be naive and put her in <br/>
a dangerous situation.<br/>
<br/>
I need a gentle helping hand here.  I don&#39;t want to push her away but I want <br/>
to be able to talk to her without her feeling defensive and doing something <br/>
she might later regret.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Jennifer<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-38303769">Are you able to invite the boy over to your house so that you can meet<br/>
him, and get to know him? &quot;Fighting with the teacher&quot; could be the<br/>
teacher&#39;s fault for all we know. If he does turn out to be a dangerous<br/>
acquaintance, for want of a better phrase, your vigilance in wanting to<br/>
meet him may be enough to discourage him. I suspect also that Haleigh<br/>
saw right through you &quot;being casual&quot; in your questions and sensed your<br/>
distrust, and reacted with her own dishonesty. I suspect that being<br/>
scrupulously honest to her about your fears will have a better result in<br/>
the long run. If you are bothered by something the owner did, that is<br/>
the person to talk to about those feelings. (Sometimes easier said than<br/>
done!) Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475374102">He lives well over an hour away, so inviting him over would be somewhat of a <br/>
challenge.  You are probably right, she most likely saw that I was <br/>
suspicious and that put her defenses up.  I did talk to her today about my <br/>
fears and concerns.  She started crying and said I am making a big deal out <br/>
of it.  Maybe I am.    I just have that bad feeling in the pit of my stomach <br/>
that I can&#39;t seem to shake.<br/>
<br/>
I do need to talk to the owner of the camp but I&#39;m not good about experssing <br/>
my concerns without sounding accusing, though, at the same time, I feel like <br/>
she shouldn&#39;t have allowed them to sleep alone together.  As a group, fine, <br/>
but just the two of them is too much for me personally.  It might be <br/>
different were Haleigh 15 or 16, but she just turned 12!  I really have a <br/>
problem with her being alone like that with a 14 yr old boy in high school.  <br/>
I&#39;d feel the same way if it were my 12 yr old son sleeping alone with a 14 <br/>
yr old girl.<br/>
<br/>
Ugh.  I&#39;m just repeating myself now, huh? lol  I&#39;ll shut up! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-582352496">Jennifer...It&#39;s my guess that the attention she got from him was <br/>
very important because she knew no one else. He was likely nice to <br/>
her and she may be having one great big daydream about him...mix <br/>
that with a few phone calls and I&#39;d say she&#39;s in 12yo heaven. He may <br/>
not be giving her the time of day but I think your gut instinct that <br/>
more happened is not all wrong. I don&#39;t think they had sex because I <br/>
think she would have fallen apart or exhibited different behavior <br/>
when you talked to her. What to do next?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d write and then re-write a note to the owners explaining what <br/>
happened. It is their place to help you resolve this. It did happen <br/>
on their watch. Have someone close to you or possibly someone online <br/>
help you pen the note so as NOT to be accusatory. Tell your daughter <br/>
what you are doing FOR HER SAFETY and that how she handles this next <br/>
camp will go a long way towards your trust of her in the future. <br/>
Since she wants to continue talking to him maybe she&#39;ll grow a <br/>
little here. Hopefully you&#39;ll be able to have her understand that <br/>
she handled the calling part in a dishonest way and if she truly <br/>
wants to be allowed to talk to boys, she&#39;ll be safer and not lie <br/>
about it. <br/>
<br/>
Hey, you could go to camp with her and make a point to meet this boy <br/>
and talk to him. Embarrassing for her but if he wants to be around <br/>
her...well? It&#39;s very hard to address this because he does live far <br/>
away. Fighting with teachers is common. My 17yo P.Sch. stepson has <br/>
gotten into it with one or two teachers. He&#39;s not a bad kid; he just <br/>
goofs off too much and they finally get enough of him...but he <br/>
doesn&#39;t physically fight. I wonder more about his situtation?</div>

I agree totally with this advice, but don&#39;t invite him over like he&#39;s on <br/>
trial, find something actually cool to do and  invite him to go with your family, <br/>
maybe.  So you can watch him when he&#39;s not watching you watch him.  Maybe <br/>
you&#39;ll really like him.<br/>

<br/>
I agree with that too.  I had forgotten how young she was.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is fourteen and he wouldn&#39;t put the moves on a girl, and he HAS slept <br/>
next to girls, though not all alone.  But he went through a rainstorm Sunday <br/>
night and though none of the girls ended up in his tent, three ended up in <br/>
Kirby&#39;s.  As one was his 18 year old female cousin, nobody worried about Kirby <br/>
either. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;d write and then re-write a note to the owners explaining what <br/>
<br/>
happened. It is their place to help you resolve this. It did happen <br/>
<br/>
on their watch. Have someone close to you or possibly someone online <br/>
<br/>
help you pen the note so as NOT to be accusatory. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Another excellent idea.  Do it in writing and don&#39;t assume the worst.  They <br/>
might not even have known the kids ended up being the only two there.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Tell your daughter <br/>
<br/>
what you are doing FOR HER SAFETY and that how she handles this next <br/>
<br/>
camp will go a long way towards your trust of her in the future. <br/>

<br/>
about it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She can talk to boys all she wants, frankly, though she might have to learn <br/>
to lie better to do it.  I wouldn&#39;t make an ultimatum.  She can go to other <br/>
houses or run away if she REALLY wants to talk to boys that badly.  Or parents <br/>
can give a kid a choice between home on strict terms or their own choices, and <br/>
lots of parents who do that lose kids.<br/>
<br/>
But this one&#39;s very young, and to treat this boy like a suitor or unwed <br/>
father is over-reaction, I&#39;m guessing.   He might have no personal interest and was <br/>
just being gallant, and might not appreciate being invited to do something <br/>
with her family just because he was nice to her in a rain storm.  So I withdraw <br/>
my earlier suggestion (or agreement to someone else&#39;s suggestion &lt;bwg&gt;).<br/>

Maybe he doesn&#39;t especially want to be around her, not in any particular way.<br/>

very important because she knew no one else.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, all the same kids were there at both camp sessions, give or take <br/>
one or two.  She met a girl she really likes but they didn&#39;t exchange <br/>
numbers.  I asked her why and she said she wants to get to know her better <br/>
before she asks for her number.  LOL!  I died laughing and so did she.  I <br/>
think it dawned on her that she didn&#39;t know Scott any better than Kristen <br/>
but she and Scott exchanged numbers.  It was hilarious.  Helped to lighten <br/>
up the topic for her and made her feel more comfortable talking to me about <br/>
him.  That was nice. :)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; He was likely nice to<br/>
her and she may be having one great big daydream about him...mix<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;d write and then re-write a note to the owners explaining what<br/>
happened.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been doing just that.  My husband and I have been working on what to <br/>
say to her.  Either by phone or letter, we haven&#39;t yet decided which.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Tell your daughter what you are doing FOR HER SAFETY and that how she <br/>

<br/>
We talked a lot about this last night. I think once she understood that I <br/>
was worried, she felt much better about being open with me.  I was able to <br/>
share some of my own experiences with her and mistakes I had made.  We <br/>
talked about friendships and boyfriend/girlfriend relationships and broken <br/>
hearts, hormones, sex, pregnancy, STD&#39;s....all things we have discussed <br/>
before but had much more relevance this time.  It was a good conversation <br/>
for both of us.  She asked a lot of questions and we worked through a lot of <br/>
scenarios and answers together, rather than me just giving her yes and no <br/>
answers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Hey, you could go to camp with her and make a point to meet this boy<br/>
and talk to him. Embarrassing for her but if he wants to be around<br/>
her...well? It&#39;s very hard to address this because he does live far<br/>
away.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We met Scott when we took her to camp.  I really liked him!  He and my <br/>
husband talked car audio stuff and he very kindly greeted Haleigh when he <br/>
walked up.  My first impression was *very* good, which helps a lot!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Fighting with teachers is common. My 17yo P.Sch. stepson has<br/>
gotten into it with one or two teachers. He&#39;s not a bad kid; he just<br/>
goofs off too much and they finally get enough of him...but he<br/>
doesn&#39;t physically fight. I wonder more about his situtation?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She said he did something or said something (wasn&#39;t sure which) and the <br/>
teacher slammed the door in his face.  He then popped off with some comment <br/>
that didn&#39;t go over well. She said he told her it just sort of slipped on <br/>
accident.  Sounded reasonable to me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your suggestions!  I wrote a reply last night but my computer <br/>
shut down just as I was ready to send.  Grrr.<br/>

You know, this really hit home with me because I *was* feeling like I should <br/>
monitor things.  They were on the phone practically all day yesterday.  The <br/>
nice thing about him living so far away is that the possibility of this <br/>
&#39;going somewhere&#39; is very slim.  I&#39;m hoping they&#39;ll just get to be really <br/>
good friends and now that we (Haleigh and I) are talking more, I&#39;m worrying <br/>
a lot less!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But this one&#39;s very young, and to treat this boy like a suitor or unwed<br/>

<br/>
Right.  My biggest concern is how young she is and how old he is.  I realize <br/>
there is onyl a two year+ difference, but 12 and 14 are so different, <br/>
maturity wise.  Scott has a 12 yr old brother, so I&#39;m hoping he can see <br/>
that.  As far as him having no personal interest or not being a suitor <br/>
though, I&#39;m not really sure.  He calls her a LOT! LOL<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Sandra, I was looking forward to hearing your response.  I often need <br/>
a more relaxed point of view to balance out my extremely overprotective <br/>
fears! &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
It depends on the 14 year old (and the 12).<br/>
<br/>
We were talking about this last night on the way back from the orientation <br/>
meeting for the Junior Police Academy Marty is going to attend for a week (next <br/>
week!).  The age range is 12 to 14, for participation.  Marty is 14.  He was <br/>
the biggest one there.  We discussed who else might have been a cadet and who <br/>
was just a sibling along for the meeting.  It&#39;s almost impossible to guess kids <br/>
in that age because some have not hit their growth spurt.  When I taught 9th <br/>
grade (14+/-), some started the year looking just like any 7th grader (12+/-) <br/>
and over that year they got big and hairy (talking about the boys now not the <br/>
girls&lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible this 14 year old is young-for-age and not getting enough of the <br/>
kinds of attention he might like from older kids.  And it&#39;s possible he&#39;s <br/>
reluctant to grow up (Many kids are) and he&#39;s appreciating the contact with <br/>
someone who&#39;s younger and happy to be so.<br/>
<br/>
This is just devil&#39;s advocate speculation, of course, but scanning through <br/>
all the kids that age I&#39;ve known, they have enough problems without being <br/>
branded with the worst sins of every boy who ever happened to be that age for a year.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;I&#39;d write and then re-write a note to the owners explaining what<br/>
happened.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve been doing just that.  My husband and I have been working on what to <br/>
say to her.  Either by phone or letter, we haven&#39;t yet decided which. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It would be a shame if your complaint caused the creation of more rules and <br/>
less opportunity for kids to make decisions, though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Jennifer,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been following your posts in hopes to gain some wonderful wisdom from <br/>
you.  My daughter just had her first &quot;date&quot; on Monday.  She is 14 (nearly 15 she <br/>
would add) and her, her best girlfriend and their &quot;boyfriends&quot; went to see a <br/>
movie here in town.  She&#39;s been plenty of times to the movies with boys/girls <br/>
but none that she considered an actual boyfriend in a romantic way.<br/>
<br/>
You would think being the fourth child, second daughter I&#39;d have this dating <br/>
thing figured out, but I still hold my breath.  Not so much for fear of what <br/>
might happen sexually, because we talk about that often.  More so now that she <br/>
has a girlfriend she&#39;s known since preschool who is having sex and it&#39;s <br/>
causing big problems in her life.  More of the fear is just the average run of the <br/>
mill mother fear of broken hearts, car accidents, (watching her drive away with <br/>
a teenage driver nearly stopped my heart but I smiled and waved as they drove <br/>
out of sight) and not being able to completely protect her from whatever is <br/>
out there.<br/>
<br/>
I think if that &quot;whatever&quot; was really out there, I&#39;d have encountered it long <br/>
ago, but it&#39;s just that motherly instinct to protect our own that kicks into <br/>
high gear I guess.<br/>
<br/>
The boy was nice enough, she&#39;s &quot;known&quot; him for a while through her friends <br/>
mother but this was the first time we&#39;ve met him.  First impression was good, he <br/>
stayed around awhile before they left and he talked, was very pleasant.  I <br/>
think Cait breathed a sigh of relief when her 18 year old brother finally got up <br/>
from between them and headed back downstairs.  I guess that was his &quot;mark of <br/>
approval&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Here it&#39;s not so much the parents that a boy would be concerned about meeting <br/>
and getting to know, it&#39;s the brothers and sister, they are TOUGH.  Maybe <br/>
because she&#39;s the youngest?  Maybe because she&#39;s so trusting?  I know they think <br/>
she&#39;s &quot;babied&quot; because she&#39;s not in school around all the &quot;bad stuff&quot; to know <br/>
what goes on.<br/>
<br/>
All went well on her date and after the movie he dropped her off at the <br/>
baseball field where we were, they hugged and he left.  Wasn&#39;t a good place to have <br/>
such a giddy conversation as mother and daughter discussing a first date.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t wait to get home but it was big moment on the ball field.  So I <br/>
had to wait.<br/>
<br/>
When we got home, we went to my room and talked about her first date.  I <br/>
think I was as giddy as she was.  How exciting is it?  The best part is that DAD, <br/>
ever the stick in the mud and overly protective about Cait handled it all just <br/>
as I had hoped he would and she thanked me for that, but I really had nothing <br/>
to do with it.  I guess he is finally catching on that life is not about <br/>
battles and confrontations and little girls DO grow up, no matter how much their <br/>
fathers wish they didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it exciting and scary to be the mother or a young teenager?  Such <br/>
wonderful adventures lay ahead for our daughters, and our sons too of course.<br/>
<br/>
I would like some advice on helping hurting hearts of young ones in love.  <br/>
With my oldest, all I could seem to muster was allowing them a day or two to <br/>
&quot;wallow&quot; in it, comfort them, make them feel loved and then it was time for a <br/>
party.  At first Sarah thought I was insane but I insisted a party was in order <br/>
because now that this particularly bad for her person was out of her life, it <br/>
meant she could now have something MORE wonderful just around the corner and <br/>
that was cause for celebration!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not so sure that&#39;s the best way to handle it but it seems to work.  <br/>
Especially with my oldest, she can sometimes dwell on things that can&#39;t be changed <br/>
and blame herself and the party does often remind her that she IS loved by <br/>
MANY friends and family.  It reinforces there is joy in the world and fun to be <br/>
had and who knows who is waiting to meet her.<br/>
<br/>
Being a mother is great isn&#39;t it?<br/>

I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about this.  My only concern is that the two of <br/>
them were alone.  Had there been other kids with them, no big deal, but I <br/>
don&#39;t feel like it was appropriate for the two of them to be sleeping in a <br/>
shed together while everyone else was outside.  Somehow I need to be able to <br/>
explain it to April, the owner, without making her feel like I&#39;m blaming it <br/>
all on her, which I&#39;m not.  I don&#39;t think there needs to be a *rule* so to <br/>
speak, but I would like for her, as the &#39;in charge&#39; adult, to say,&quot; hey, why <br/>
don&#39;t you guys join us out here.&quot;  Or just tell them that coeds sleeping <br/>
alone together isn&#39;t appropriate for camp.  I guess that&#39;s a rule but.....<br/>

<br/>
I LOVE the idea of a party!  What a great way for her to reconnect with <br/>
friends and move on!  I remember all too well being a heart broken teenager. <br/>
  It was so easy to center my life around my boyfriend and let my friends <br/>
fall to the wayside.<br/>
<br/>
Ugh, I&#39;m not looking forward to that first *real* date where my daughter <br/>
drives off in a car with a boy.  I&#39;ll have to carry an ice chest I&#39;m sure, <br/>
so when my heart falls out of *my* chest, I&#39;ll have somehere to keep it safe <br/>
for reimplantation! LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I totally agree with that.  Cait&#39;s boyfriend lives a distance from us, she <br/>
doesn&#39;t drive, he just turned sixteen and hasn&#39;t yet gotten his license.  His <br/>
friends drive but for every day hanging out, what are we going to do next <br/>
scenarios it&#39;s GREAT.<br/>
<br/>
They can plan time to be together and do things then go apart and talk on the <br/>
phone or online without the added pressures of being together in person every <br/>
waking moment as some of the kids feel is necessary.<br/>
<br/>
When the boyfriend/girlfriend lives just down the street, often times you see <br/>
way to much of them and they have to find ways to occupy their time together. <br/>
 For some, it&#39;s probably a good thing, but I find some comfort in my mother&#39;s <br/>
heart that he doesn&#39;t live in our neighborhood, our town or even our County.<br/>
<br/>
Kinda gives them more to look forward to don&#39;t you think?<br/>

<br/>
YES! YES! YES!!  This is *exactly* what I&#39;m thinking!  They can talk all the <br/>
time but will only see each other once a month.  I don&#39;t want that to sound <br/>
mean, but for her first *experience* with liking a boy, this is a really <br/>
nice way to go about it.  &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And you know, Haleigh is extremely mature, so it helps t have that <br/>
perspective.  I agree with you completely.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Kathryn!<br/>
