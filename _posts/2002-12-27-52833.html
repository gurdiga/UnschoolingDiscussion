Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527506679">We bought an old Nikon Cool Pix 100 off of Ebay for 80 bucks. It works really well. Easy to use, great pictures! I think you can now find them even cheaper. <br/>
 We have since upgraded because I really wanted to see the pictures right when we took them. But my husband is still using the Cool Pix at work and when he happens to see something he wants a picture of. lol <br/>

I got a digital camera for Christmas; dh found one that was <br/>
refurbished.  It was about $100 and has all the features I wanted <br/>
(compact, picture display, zoom lens, crisp pictures, no delay <br/>
between pushing the button and the picture being taken, etc.).  <br/>
It&#39;s a Kodak DX3215; he got it from tigerdirect.com.  His stragegy <br/>
was to research cameras with desired features, then did a google <br/>
search to see who carried them refurbished, thus cutting the price to <br/>
1/2 to 1/3 of new.<br/>
