<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136375749">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I spoke to Ginger last night about the cruise. She has reserved ten cabins <br/>
for our group. As long as we confirm five cabins, we will get the group <br/>
discount. Ginger is sending me cruise brochures and reservation forms. We&#39;ll <br/>
have ten days from the day we receive the forms to get Ginger initial <br/>
deposits. If you aren&#39;t sure at this point if you can go, we have until <br/>
March 1 before we lose the cabins. However, you&#39;ll have to pay in full at <br/>
that point and all the rooms may be booked by then.<br/>
<br/>
Ginger has reserved several different cabin styles. Some are ocean views, <br/>
some are inside cabins. If you do not want a balcony, just indicate that on <br/>
your reservation form. She said that they are standard size cabins. Of <br/>
course, they have larger cabins available at a higher cost.<br/>
<br/>
There are some people that may have 5 family members. Unfortunately, <br/>
Norwegian is pretty strict about their 4 in a room policy. However, some <br/>
people may want to make arrangements with other families that have 5 or 6 to <br/>
share an additional cabin. Ginger can get adjoining cabins in these cases.<br/>
<br/>
Again, the website is homeschooltravelnetwork.com and our cruise is the one <br/>
leaving from Houston. You may also call Ginger at 404-642-7512 if you have <br/>
specific questions. Otherwise, I&#39;ll be getting the forms to you in the mail <br/>
as soon as I  get them.<br/>
<br/>

I looked, and we&#39;re considering this, but will it be unschoolers or will <br/>
there be homeschoolers making their kids write reports about what they&#39;re seeing?<br/>
<br/>
Are you going yourself?<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the deal for unschoolers and this?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure, exactly, now that you ask.  I was under the impression, from <br/>
talking to Wendy, that it was just a regular cruise, and we were booking these <br/>
how ever-many rooms as a group rate.  Is the website saying the boat is going <br/>
to be full of homeschoolers?  I&#39;ll get clarification from Wendy.<br/>
<br/>
We are planning on going, unless it looks like it will be a boat load of <br/>
school-at-homers.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I did just check the site, and the cruise description looks to me like <br/>
regular cruise-ship fare--not specific for homeschoolers or any one group.  There <br/>
would be other things to do on shore excursions, too, and those are usually <br/>
good, although most of them cost extra.  It looks to me like this <br/>
homeschooltravelnetwork is just acting as a travel agent.  So it&#39;s possible there will be lots <br/>
of homeschoolers, and possible that there won&#39;t be anyone but us.  I doubt it <br/>
will be a whole boatload, though.  Those boats hold a lot of people!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

But is she an unschooler? <br/>
<br/>
Is it an unschooling thing?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My selling point to my husband was we could be around lots of other <br/>
unschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
Last night he said something about driving to Boston.  I thought he meant in <br/>
the spring or something, and said something confusing, and he said &quot;In August, <br/>
for the conference.   Are you and Marty going to hog the whole thing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He laughed, and I laughed, and I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s serious about maybe going <br/>
to Boston with the whole family, but that&#39;s more appealing than a cruise, for <br/>
me, as I don&#39;t speak Spanish functionally and I don&#39;t swim.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The people I&#39;m recruiting are unschoolers, or if they&#39;re not quite there yet, <br/>
they&#39;re cool enough to hang out with anyway.  Most of the people Wendy knows <br/>
are unschoolers.  Wendy doesn&#39;t call herself anything, but she has a couple of <br/>
really cool self-directed kids who have a special kind of autonomy that I <br/>
really like. I really don&#39;t know how they turned out that way with her not <br/>
calling herself *anything*.  lol.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to do the cruise AND the conference, but it&#39;s not such a long haul <br/>
for me.  Next year is THE year that I go to Vermont to see Heather at her <br/>
summer place, Sarah in New Hampshire, Anne O. in New York AND the Boston area for <br/>
the conference.  It&#39;s gonna take all summer.  (I hope!)  If I have to choose, <br/>
it will be the New England trip, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have to choose.<br/>
