<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980157130">I always have to change my strategies for my girls to pick up. Here are a couple<br/>
of things that I have &quot;toyed&quot; with;<br/>
During the time that my girls like to sing, we made up songs as we put things<br/>
away (this made the time go by fast and help my oldest with understanding<br/>
rhyming words). Sometimes if the stuff being picked up was soft or non-breakable<br/>
we would play who could toss it into the toy box. Then of course there are times<br/>
when bribing works. The bribe may only be for pennies or nickels but this works<br/>
currently as my 6 yr old is counting currency now. We often trade smaller<br/>
denominations for the larger. When they are really stubborn, and I really need<br/>
to have things done I will first try to give them a choice, like:  would you<br/>
prefer to pick up your toys or clean the ferret cage?  I explain that one of the<br/>
duties is usually mine and I would gladly switch jobs for the day. They usually<br/>
choose their own chore given the choice. I have, in the past, rewarded my kids<br/>
as if they were my dogs, with TONS of praise and love and then a small treat.<br/>
Now my dogs, were easier, they like cheese. My girls would get something like<br/>
&quot;brownies&quot; if they did everything needed that day.</div>
