<div id="ygrps-yiv-342476647">I know this was Beth&#39;s question but I wanted to thank you, Joyce for your<br/>
insights here.  Sydney 8, is extremely helpful and confident about taking<br/>
care of Anika 3, and b/c she&#39;s so good at it, the temptation is there to<br/>
expect her to pitch in whenever it would be especially convenient for me.  I<br/>
threw my back out a few weeks ago and have been trying not to lift or bend<br/>
too much to let it heal.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Anika woke up in the living room and started crying while S and I<br/>
were reading in the bedroom.  S said &quot; o, mom, you stay here.  I&#39;ll get her,<br/>
that way you won&#39;t hurt your back.&quot;  Not only did she go get her but she<br/>
carried her 50lb sister to her mommy while speaking soothingly to her.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t ask her to help just then but I&#39;ve a feeling she wouldn&#39;t have taken<br/>
such joy in the task if it had been expected of her.  Other times I might<br/>
ask her to do something for her sister to speed things up on my agenda and<br/>
she&#39;s just as likely to say no.  I guess that&#39;s ok too.  I sure do like it<br/>
when she does things like that on her own.  How *can* she if I&#39;m always<br/>
asking?<br/>

you&#39;d hold the baby the best you could while helping your son.<br/>
<br/>

go. You could say, &quot;Would you mind doing something with the baby? Maybe you<br/>
could try giving her a bottle, since that sounds like her hungry cry to me,&quot;<br/>
then let go of control. (That&#39;ll be the hard part!) And when the crisis is<br/>
over say &quot;Thanks ever so much!&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
Sarah and your husband in for yourself. Imagine that he&#39;s doing something<br/>
that seems totally ridiculous to you, like juggling flaming torches and<br/>
wants you to handle one set in a particular way while he handles the ones<br/>
that are giving him trouble. That&#39;s quite likely the way she sees it until<br/>
she can get to the point where she knows whatever help she can do will be<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
