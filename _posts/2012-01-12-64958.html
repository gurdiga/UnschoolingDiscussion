<br/>
Notes on the best use of the Always Learning list:<br/>
As list owner, I much prefer quality over quantity. I&#39;m not trying for volume. I&#39;m trying to provide learning here so that participants can facilitate rich, fun learning lives for their families when they&#39;re not on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Posts for this list need to fulfill at least one of these criteria:<br/>
<br/>
helps lots of people understand unschooling<br/>
asks a question that actually needs an answer<br/>
requests help seeing different aspects of a situation<br/>
helps people have more peaceful and joyful lives (helps lots of people on the list)<br/>
ALL posts should be<br/>
honest<br/>
proofread<br/>
sincere<br/>
clear<br/>
NO posts should be just a &quot;thank you&quot; or &quot;me too&quot; or &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;LOL&quot;<br/>
With over a thousand people we don&#39;t need greetings and good-byes. Be here or don&#39;t be here, and save posting for important messages to hundreds of people.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to even consider what people are offering as suggestions, keep that to yourself. THINK about what you&#39;ve read. Think privately, and not in a post that hundreds of people will need to read or ignore. Only post important, useful, honest things.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653592120">It would be nice also if people would remember to cut off the replied-to post from the end of their post, to just include the relevant quotes within their writing. It makes the daily digests more pleasant to scroll through.<br/>
