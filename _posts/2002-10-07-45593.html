&lt;&lt; I have no problem with being reasonble I assumed that we were<br/>
talking about after being reasonable had been tried.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There seems an implication that some of us aren&#39;t reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
Or that the writer is reasonable, but reason ends past those actions <br/>
(whatever they might be).<br/>
<br/>
Please be careful not to insult people who&#39;ve been unschooling happily for <br/>
many years when you answer routine questions here.  Even if the old timers <br/>
blow it by, others reading here won&#39;t know who&#39;s new to unschooling and who&#39;s <br/>
more experienced, and having successful practices misrepresented for the sake <br/>
of an argument doesn&#39;t really do anyone much good.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
