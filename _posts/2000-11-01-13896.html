<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176946541">My 7 and 5 dds sleep together.  I lay down with them until they fall<br/>
asleep.  I usually fall asleep too, then dh wakes me up when he goes to<br/>
bed, so I can help him fall asleep too :-).  Yes, this is &quot;harder&quot; than<br/>
just telling them it is time to go to bed.  But I know the day will come<br/>
when they won&#39;t need this anymore.  (I hope!)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any experience with food allergies, so I can&#39;t help there.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe something has scared him?  Lots of things that don&#39;t seem scary to<br/>
us can be very scary to children.  5 yr old dd woke up nearly in tears<br/>
once, because she had dreamed that the ears fell off her stuffed bunny.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  I hope you find a solution soon!<br/>

<br/>
On the subject of sleep, just wanted to add that maybe, during <br/>
the day when you think about it (says me, who needs to have a <br/>
similar discussion with a long-term nurser...) and you&#39;re both calm, <br/>
you could ask him what he wants to do at bedtime.  It could really <br/>
surprise you...  Another thing to think about is that lying with head <br/>
at North and feet to South is considered to be a healing thing in <br/>
itself, might help calm things down.  Dd1&#39;s just started voluntarily <br/>
sleeping in her own bed, without complaining of loneliness, and <br/>
also stopped wetting the bed, she turned 5 last week (!)  <br/>
<br/>
Hope you find something to help you here<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539717317">Sara,<br/>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve heard my story yet.  Twice since I started <br/>
homeschooling, I&#39;ve been striken with medical problems.  The first, <br/>
was the first year the girls were home.  Rachel was 11, Jenni <br/>
was 8 and Wyndham was 4.  I came down with Guillaume-Barre Syndrom.  I <br/>
spent a couple of months flat on my back.  Rachel learned to cook and <br/>
clean that year out of necessity.  I felt guilty for quite a while <br/>
because I felt like I put the girls in a bad position, having to take <br/>
care of me, but what could I do?  <br/>
The second time was two and 1/2 years later, when I had a pulmonary <br/>
embolism, followed two days later by a heart attack.  I was out of <br/>
commission once again for several months.  Jenni learned to make a <br/>
really great grilled cheese sandwich that year!<br/>
I tell you this, not because I want you to feel sorry for us - - I <br/>
consider myself lucky in a way, because those problems are part of the <br/>
reason I unschooled in the first place.  The conscious thought about <br/>
what I was actually doing (regarding their education) came much later. <br/>
 Mostly, I was just so wiped that it was unschooling by default that <br/>
first year.<br/>
This has to be even harder for you since yours are so much littler.  <br/>
Do you have other unschooling friends she could go do stuff with <br/>
occassionally?  My only other advice would be to talk to her as much <br/>
as you can and keep telling her that things will not be like they are <br/>
for very long.  The baby will grow, you will feel better, life will be <br/>
more fun.  And for now, TV won&#39;t hurt her.  You could also find her <br/>
some cool computer games too. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-476626864">I&#39;m sorry to hear you are having a hard time right now.  I admire your dedication to seeing that your baby gets the best start in her life.<br/>
<br/>
Does your 5 y.o. enjoy what she is viewing on tv?  If she is then what&#39;s the problem?  You could join her and ask her about her favorite show and what she likes about it...<br/>
<br/>
Can you get out to the library?  Our library also lends out computer games, board games, puzzles, etc.  Books on tape are fun for some kids?  Does she have access to art materials (paper, crayons, markers, pencils, clay, glue, scissors , etc?  Perhaps you can invite another family over to visit? <br/>
<br/>
 Include her as much as possible in the tasks you feel are taking up all of your time.  She can sit with you while you are feeding the baby...you could play I Spy with her, read to her or just enjoy each other&#39;s company, maybe she&#39;d like to help you make food and clean?  There are a lot of wonderful treasures to be found at a Thrift store or garage sale...or for that matter, in your own backyard. ;-)  <br/>
<br/>
Ask your daughter what it is she enjoys doing and go from there?  I am an only child and do not think I had a nonlife when mom was doing something else that took up a lot of her time.  I found all sorts of fun ways to create things and play.  I think my parents purposely stayed out of the way sometimes. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111453150">Sara, my heart goes out to you.  I don&#39;t know what you mean by a sucking<br/>
problem, but when I had my second child, I thought nursing would be so<br/>
enjoyable, like with my first.  But he bit me and chomped on me.  Also,<br/>
wherever he sucked got blisters and he too had thrush that wouldn&#39;t go<br/>
away.  He actually was allergic to my milk because I had an overgrowth of<br/>
yeast.  Unfortunately, I stopped nursing because I couldn&#39;t afford to go<br/>
to the doctor (Of course, I didn&#39;t know about welfare at the time).  He<br/>
bit because of the thrush, not because he really wanted to bite.  He also<br/>
sucked way too hard because I think it itched or something in his mouth. <br/>
If I could do it again, I would buy some plain yogurt, like the kind you<br/>
get at the health food store with no sugar, but with acidophilus and good<br/>
bacteria cultures.  Then I would spread that around the baby&#39;s mouth,<br/>
just like you do with Nystatin, the medicine for thrush.  I would totally<br/>
eliminate pasteurized milk, wheat and sugar from my diet, but I would eat<br/>
the yogurt.  I would also drink sixteen 8 oz. cups of water a day (if<br/>
possible, with the juice of a lemon in it-yeast hate that), all before<br/>
dinner.  I know this sounds extreme.  If you have two half-gallon<br/>
pitchers and fill them with water at night, leaving them open, by morning<br/>
the chlorine taste should leave it.  Then just be sure you finish them<br/>
off by dinner time.  For your daughter, if you have a library and a vcr,<br/>
there are a lot of tapes she could watch.  Don&#39;t worry about giving her<br/>
everything she needs schoolwise right now.  I learned to read watching<br/>
the electric company.  Read between the Lions is good for that.  I always<br/>
say &quot;Boredom is the soil in which imagination grows.&quot;  Give her household<br/>
items to play with.  Marbles, beads, beans, sticks, rocks can all teach<br/>
math.  Books at the library teach counting and reading-what is that one<br/>
book with animal-people with words by the pictures?  Libraries these days<br/>
often have computer games that teach math and reading, if you make an<br/>
appointment for it.  Maybe you could at least take her once or twice a<br/>
week?  I&#39;m not sure where you are, city or country, or what your<br/>
transportation is.  Also, if you have the internet, there are sites for<br/>
children, like cartoon network for games or pbs or other learning sites<br/>
that since I don&#39;t have it I&#39;m not up on right now.  I&#39;m hoping others<br/>
could help you there.  Remember, this too shall pass.<br/>
I hope my advice has something you can use.  Twelve weeks is a long time<br/>
to go through all this.  Best wishes and prayer for you.<br/>

If there are any around, contact a La Leche League leader. I dealt with thrush with my youngest for over 6 months, it was hard and in the end I had to throw away all of my bras and TOTALLY change my diet but it was well worth it! But I also got a lot of great advice and support from the leaders in my area, I definitely suggest calling one. Here is there main website - www.lalecheleague.org  <br/>
<br/>
Some suggestions for now would be, 1st to cut out all dairy (which can be hard), boil your bras, there is also a homeopathic rememdy but right now I can&#39;t think of it (when I remember I will email it) that works very well.<br/>

I am sorry for the trouble you are having with the baby&#39;s health and <br/>
with finances.  I have been there in both regards and I can assure <br/>
that &quot;this too shall pass&quot;.  I know at the time it seems that your <br/>
life will always be this way, but it won&#39;t.  Once you get past this, <br/>
you will find that you and your children will be stronger.  <br/>
<br/>
I have had multiple health problems since my first pregnancy and <br/>
just last year I was practically bedridden.  My doctors still <br/>
haven&#39;t decided if I have MS, Lupus, or ???  I felt so bad for my <br/>
children because there was so little that I could do for them and <br/>
they were having to do things to help me. (I hate needing help!!)<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is that the experience appears to have been good for <br/>
all of us.  I have learned that I can&#39;t control everything (Hey, <br/>
even my own body doesn&#39;t do what I want it to.  LOL)<br/>
My children learned that they can do things themselves.  They have <br/>
also become kinder to each other.  They still argue, but now they <br/>
ask for and give forgiveness.  We have all learned that life is <br/>
precious and we are lucky to be with people that love us.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that you need to worry about your daughter having <br/>
a &#39;nonlife&#39;.  She has many years to take classes.  Right now she is <br/>
watching you and learning how to be a loving mother.  IMHO that is <br/>
the most important &#39;class&#39; of all.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433488060">Hello, <br/>
<br/>
Someone in group Mention yeast overgrowth.  They also<br/>
mention to eat yogurt.  Which is helpful, but another <br/>
good treatment is taking acidopholis pills from the<br/>
health food store.  Natren has one for infants. Some<br/>
people who have frequent yeast problem in their body<br/>
might want to look up leaky gut on the internet. There<br/>
natural supplements for that too. <br/>
Just an idea. I <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; And my daughters loves to social &quot;tribe&quot; aspect of girl scouts and<br/>
&gt;&gt; couldn&#39;t care less about doing the badges &lt;g&gt; It helps that her<br/>
&gt; leader is<br/>
&gt;&gt; an unschooling mom.... and to be honest, a lot of the badge stuff<br/>
&gt; looks<br/>
&gt;&gt; kind of dippy.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; ...<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Dar<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My dd is the same way.  Her leader is a homeschooler and knows we are<br/>
&gt; unschoolers and is very relaxed about what the girls do.  They can<br/>
&gt; work on badges on their own and present what they&#39;ve done to get the<br/>
&gt; patch, or not.  They also do some group badges that usually take the<br/>
&gt; year to complete.<br/>
&gt; My dd worked on one on her own and I kinda nudged her through it.<br/>
&gt; She was glad she did it, but has never worked on another one.<br/>
&gt; We both felt that there was fun stuff to do to get the badge, but<br/>
&gt; some pretty &quot;dippy&quot; stuff too.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just wanted to also greet the newbies!  I am also just starting and my husband<br/>
&gt; sounds very similar and comes from a large family of public school teachers,<br/>
&gt; including his father.  I just keep putting little quotes and excerpts up on<br/>
&gt; the refridge, table.... where ever I think he might see them.   Like right now<br/>
&gt; , the quote from Linda Dobson is up.  So far he has been pretty receptive, I<br/>
&gt; think it is such a jump for some people tho&#39;,  to me its makes so much sense,<br/>
&gt; Unschooling that is.  I think if I gently ease him into the thought it will be<br/>
&gt; just fine.. I just have to be patient like she(Linda D.) says,  I think both<br/>
&gt; of you who just introduced yourselves are on the right track.  I love seeing<br/>
&gt; so many people new,  it gives me faith that more and more people will see the<br/>
&gt; logic of our ways!!<br/>
&gt; I have to say that this is the first fall that I havn&#39;t been a basket case,<br/>
&gt; gee, just happens to be the first fall we&#39;ve unschooled.  Usually the stress<br/>
&gt; of school starting up practically shuts me down,  not this year!  I have<br/>
&gt; fibromyalgia, (can never spell it) and the stress of school really was<br/>
&gt; horrible. When I was young and now as a parent.  Can&#39;t wait for everyone else<br/>
&gt; to go tho&#39; and we can go out and really enjoy our life.  It is so good to be<br/>
&gt; home with my kids!<br/>
&gt; Loving unschooling, especially during fall in northern Minnesota!<br/>

&gt;&gt; Welcome Robin, that is SO true. It&#39;s us, as the parents, that need to change<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; our thinking for unschooling to work. Children are born curious and eager<br/>
&gt;&gt; to <br/>
&gt;&gt; learn about their world. They don&#39;t have the school mindset baggage to<br/>
&gt;&gt; lose.They&#39;re just themselves, living each day for the moment.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Let your children be your example, get in touch with the passions you have<br/>
&gt;&gt; and go with it!!  Sounds like you&#39;re on the right track.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Ren<br/>
&gt; Thank you.  Just wish dh was on same track.  Homeschooling is<br/>
&gt; questioned...me taking it to unschooling, well...anyone know of a book (less<br/>
&gt; is more!)  or article of some sort that speaks to the &quot;logical,&quot; linear,<br/>
&gt; standardized mind?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; I read a book called &quot;Coloring Outside<br/>
&gt; the Lines&quot; in which a man who designed artificial intelligence for<br/>
&gt; computers and therefore had studied a lot about how learning works,<br/>
&gt; wrote about how to get your kids through public school with their<br/>
&gt; critical thinking, creativity and love of learning in tact.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I love that book. I recommend it often because it&#39;s written by a Dad and he<br/>
&gt; had his kids in ps (which baffles me since he lists all the ways it damages<br/>
&gt; kids), and therefore is a good book imo for people reluctant to accept<br/>
&gt; homeschooling as a viable option.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; Last year&#39;s coordinator also got her to come out a<br/>
&gt;&gt; couple of months ago to speak to a group of mostly-homeschoolers in<br/>
&gt;&gt; Nevada City or somewhere near there...  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Well then she must have just spoken and gone away, because it seemed<br/>
&gt;&gt; she  neither socialized nor met any people&#39;s kids!<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was wrong. It was in April, and in Auburn. And I guess it was more of a<br/>
&gt; mixed group, although a bunch of homeschoolers from here went, including<br/>
&gt; the afore-mentioned last year&#39;s coordinator. It was a 3 or 4 hour evening<br/>
&gt; thing, though, so probably no kids went, or very few.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She appeals to the crunchy granola homeschoolers, and there are a lot of<br/>
&gt; them around here.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Family matters : why homeschooling makes sense by David Guterson is the one<br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve heard recommended most often for reluctant husbands.  Guterson is a<br/>
&gt;&gt; high school teacher (or was - he&#39;s an novelist as well).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve always been curious if he continued teaching high school after his<br/>
&gt; novel &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot;.  It was so successful, and in &quot;Family<br/>
&gt; Matters&quot; I had the impression that while he enjoyed teaching school, that it<br/>
&gt; was also frustrating (gee, imagine that!).  Anybody know?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve enjoyed both his books very much, and Family Matters helped sell a<br/>
&gt; friend&#39;s husband on homeschooling this year.  I saw another one on the<br/>
&gt; english language rack at the train station, but I need to order it off<br/>
&gt; Amazon.com -- $17 for a paperback, yikes!<br/>

&gt;&gt; We&#39;re fine with girl scouts because it is an inclusive group, and the<br/>
&gt;&gt; policies against homophobia and religious discrimination are clearly<br/>
&gt;&gt; spelled-out. My daughter, at least, wouldn&#39;t have participated otherwise.<br/>
&gt;&gt; This isn&#39;t true of boy scouts, though...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anybody do boy scouts?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; DH went through scouting up thru Eagle, and really wants our son involved in<br/>
&gt; it.  I not only have problems about their inclusivity, but also that it<br/>
&gt; looks a heckuva lot like school these days.  It used to be that cubs were<br/>
&gt; grades 2-4, webaloes 5, and boy scouts 6-12.  Now (at least here...), the<br/>
&gt; cub scouts meet together once a month, but for weekly meetings, it&#39;s tigers<br/>
&gt; in 1st grade, wolves in 2nd grade, bears in 3rd grade, etc.  Being not<br/>
&gt; overly fond of the school model, that doesn&#39;t thrill me.  Part of the appeal<br/>
&gt; of scouting when I was a girl scout was having the older girls help me do<br/>
&gt; stuff and looking forward to when *I* was one of the older girls.  Mixed age<br/>
&gt; stuff.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just hesitant to jump into a commitment, I guess.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Oh ---- man ---- this is ugly!  Did she always hate you?<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Always. I took her baby away. When all her other kids left home it was just<br/>
&gt; her and Darin for years. When he went to the Marines, he sent home much of<br/>
&gt; his paycheck, he used one of his bonuses to buy her a car. He saved two other<br/>
&gt; bonuses (all hazardous pay bonuses) to put a down payment on a house for her.<br/>
&gt; When he and I met, much of that stopped, although we lived with her for about<br/>
&gt; six months and we paid most of the bills for her during that time. (she was<br/>
&gt; between husbands number 5 and 6) When we got married and had left the<br/>
&gt; reception, she stood at the curb and cried, saying over and over &quot;My baby&#39;s<br/>
&gt; gone, she took him away.&quot; I learned this from one of my Great-aunts who<br/>
&gt; called me the day we got back from our honey moon to tell me. When I had<br/>
&gt; Moly, she was so excited, Moly was the first girl in their family in over 40<br/>
&gt; years. (since Darin&#39;s sister was born) When I told her Moly&#39;s name and how we<br/>
&gt; spell it, she told me how stupid it was, handed Darin a list of *family*<br/>
&gt; names and said she wouldn&#39;t be back unless it was changed. She didn&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; Moly for the first 6 months of her life. When Jack was born, she came to the<br/>
&gt; hospital. I was there for three days before I had him (I wasn&#39;t in Labor that<br/>
&gt; long, it was other things) and she thought I was going to have him. When I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t have him that first night, she left saying &quot;Just call me when she<br/>
&gt; finally has this one.&quot; After he was born she threw a fit over his name too,<br/>
&gt; because she had had an alcoholic uncle named Jack and hated him. (She still<br/>
&gt; refuses to call him Jack, she calls him Jackie.) I could go on and on, the<br/>
&gt; list is endless, I am the monkey on her back, her enigma.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; We both felt that there was fun stuff to do to get the badge, but<br/>
&gt; some pretty &quot;dippy&quot; stuff too.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In true unschooling fashion, Casey does only the fun stuff and skips the<br/>
&gt; dippy. ;-) A lot of the dippy stuff we just check off because we realize<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s &quot;covered&quot; it somehow in the course of real life. No Girl Scout<br/>
&gt; busywork for us thank you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Casey really likes working towards goals, so those little badges fill a need<br/>
&gt; for her.<br/>

&gt; The quote was one from this list yesterday,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Your efforts may, at first, seem more like scrap lumber randomly scattered<br/>
&gt; across the vast universe that is your child rather than a remarkable structure<br/>
&gt; you watch rise, floor by measureable floor.  But the Eiffel Tower didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; appear overnight, and the most beautiful cathedrals of the world took decades<br/>
&gt; to complete.<br/>
&gt; It helps to think of yourself not as &quot;teacher&quot; the way you remember it, but<br/>
&gt; like the supplier whose purpose is merely making sure the builder - your child<br/>
&gt; - can get his hands on the necessary materials when he needs them.  Be happy<br/>
&gt; when you make any sale, however modest.  The true architect will use the<br/>
&gt; materials in his own way, in his own time.<br/>
&gt; Schools force a child into using his limited resources today.  &quot;Build a bird<br/>
&gt; house, &quot;they demand, &quot;so that we may count how many sticks you&#39;ve collected.&quot;<br/>
&gt; At home there&#39;s no need for immediate &quot;proof&quot;.  Be patient.  Don&#39;t measure.<br/>
&gt; Who can say what exquisite masterpiece your child will shape and build from<br/>
&gt; the scraps tomorrow - or ten years from now?  The more he collects, the<br/>
&gt; greater the structure he&#39;s capable of building.  And when that structure is<br/>
&gt; life itself, don&#39;t settle for a bird house today.  Trust you&#39;ll find a castle<br/>
&gt; tomorrow.<br/>
&gt; Simply provide the materials.&quot;<br/>

&gt;&gt; I think you&#39;re sending her a strong message by having the lawyer<br/>
&gt;&gt; involved.  Does she know that the lawyer is a cousin?  Even better if she<br/>
&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t.  If she thinks you&#39;re paying a lawyer, she&#39;ll be even more clear<br/>
&gt;&gt; that you mean business.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Tia, who really appreciates the MIL who disagrees with lots of what we do<br/>
&gt;&gt; but doesn&#39;t say anything.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, she doesn&#39;t know my cousin is a lawyer. Why? Because she has never shown<br/>
&gt; an interest in my family at all. Never comes to anything I have invited her<br/>
&gt; to, never asks how anyone is doing... Oh well her loss.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you to all who recommended books (and other ideas) for &quot;the relunctant<br/>
&gt; husband.&quot;  I think that *I* will end up being the one doing the reading. But,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m  thinking that&#39;s okay and that I should be grateful that we have<br/>
&gt; agreement to homeschool because *I* want to and believe in it so much (with<br/>
&gt; conditions).  I like the idea of posting quotes...it would serve a purpose<br/>
&gt; for inspiring me and if it goes beyond that, then great!  The conditions are<br/>
&gt; that our children be prepared to enter ps if it becomes necessary....cover<br/>
&gt; same learning objectives as ps.  Just got to figure out how to do this in<br/>
&gt; unschooly kind of way.  Please don&#39;t say its impossible!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks to all,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I have been lurking a while and thought it was time to post my question.  I<br/>
have a dd, 8 years old who has never been to any type of school.  we have<br/>
always been in the middle; unschooling/some traditional things as well.  my<br/>
dd has never liked the &quot;traditional&quot; approach, so it has always led me back<br/>
to the unschooling method.  I feel that is only natural to follow her leads.<br/>
schooling the traditional way has caused several arguments, tears, and<br/>
frustration.  at times it has been difficult for me to just let go and<br/>
follow her lead. so here we are again, new &quot;school&quot; year beginning and I am<br/>
struggling with this issue again!<br/>
<br/>
my biggest struggle has been trying to find things that interest her.  she<br/>
reads very well, but doesn&#39;t particularly like to.(I am very relaxed about<br/>
what she reads, I just want her to read!)  sometimes I feel like she isn&#39;t<br/>
interested in anything.  how do I help to spark her interest?  I sometimes<br/>
feel like I have just hit a roadblock with her and I don&#39;t know where to go<br/>
from here.  I am very committed to homeschooling, I believe that it is best<br/>
for our family and ps is the last place that she would go.  I guess I am<br/>
just looking for any advice or support with this.  does anyone else have<br/>
these problems with getting there children interested in things?  she<br/>
basically just wants to play all day, without ANY academics.<br/>
<br/>
any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
this list has been an invaluable resource for me.<br/>
<br/>
Thank You,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about turning your concerns around and looking at them from a different<br/>
point of view.<br/>
<br/>
Husband: &quot;I don&#39;t care what she reads, I just want her to read!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My wife basically just wants to do the things that interest her all day,<br/>
without ANY of the things I think are worth while for her to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How would you want him to spark interests in you?<br/>
<br/>
If it were me, I wouldn&#39;t want my husband watching me and judging that what<br/>
I was doing wasn&#39;t good enough and judging that I should be more interested<br/>
in things he thinks are worth while! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t look like kids pursuing academic things on their own. It<br/>
really does look like play. The reason kids like to play is because that&#39;s<br/>
how they&#39;re hardwired to learn. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can be frustrating for parents because it doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s<br/>
headed anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a kind of balance between letting them be and providing<br/>
access to the world. If you aren&#39;t pursuing interests on your own for your<br/>
own enjoyment, then is it reasonable to expect her to? It&#39;ll work a lot<br/>
better if you do things and provide access because you want to share things<br/>
with her and because you think they&#39;re enjoyable not because you want her to<br/>
be interested. You may end up going to the same places and doing the same<br/>
things, but your attitude will be different. She won&#39;t unconsciously pick up<br/>
any pressure that this is something you want her to do.<br/>
<br/>
And you might want to reassess what her interests are. It&#39;s what she plays<br/>
and what she does when you aren&#39;t assessing whether what she&#39;s doing looks<br/>
like learning or not or looks like an access to something academic.<br/>
<br/>
So what does she play when alone and with friends? What kind of things does<br/>
she do on her own? What kind of programs or movies are her favorites? What<br/>
kind of books does she read when she does choose something? (Do you still<br/>
read to her? kids&#39; listening level tends to be at a higher level than their<br/>
reading level so we shouldn&#39;t stop reading. Books on tape are good too,<br/>
especially when doing crafts and sometimes for cleaning too.)<br/>

My just turned 7 yo has started reading -- but, he only reads at night! He says he can&#39;t stand to read during the day because he &quot;likes playing and doing things&quot;. So, at night, he reads in bed ( unless we&#39;re watching videos :-) ) , eventually falling asleep with the book in his hand. Maybe your dd  is the same - liking to be active during the day but would be happy to read at nightime, when things may (?)  be more quiet....Leonie W. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1104781019"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;my biggest struggle has been trying to find things that interest her.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe you&#39;re trying too hard to interest her in typical schooly academic <br/>
things. Does she like any sports (swimming, biking, rollerblading, <br/>
hiking...)? How about movies or trips to the zoo or a children&#39;s museum? <br/>
Does she like making crafty stuff? Playing with dolls or board games? These <br/>
are all valid interests and will lead to amazing thinking and skills if you <br/>
let them.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;&gt;about what she reads, I just want her to read!)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about if you read to her? Pick really interesting and complex books <br/>
beyond her current reading level. Those are great for sharing together. Try <br/>
getting her some magazines too. My Casey doesn&#39;t read too many books on her <br/>
own, but she loves her magazines...American Girl, Ranger Rick, Stone Soup, <br/>
etc. Comics like Charlie Brown, Garfield, and Fox Trot are great too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;sometimes I feel like she isn&#39;t interested in anything.  how do I help to <br/>
&gt;&gt;spark her interest?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By relaxing and enjoying playing around with her. By showing and sharing <br/>
*your* interets with her. By forgetting about school altogether and focusing <br/>
on the joy of being and doing stuff together.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I sometimes feel like I have just hit a roadblock with her and I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;&gt;know where to go from here.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve hit the SCHOOL roadblock. Now it&#39;s time to take the UNschooling <br/>
detour. With any luck, you&#39;ll forge a new path altogether and never have to <br/>
get on that boring schooling interstate highway again.<br/>
