&gt; dropped a note on the message boards about this too, and then realized<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d really like to discuss some of the differences that other folx see.<br/>
&gt; The big thing I see is that my son craves companionship of other kids.<br/>
&gt; So we do sports and the local homeschool group and the local Y. What do<br/>
&gt; other folx do?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a twelve year old boy. We have never lived in a neighborhood with <br/>
other kids nearby. We do playdates with friends from church, homeschool <br/>
groups, etc. I think he&#39;d love to have more time with friends, but it&#39;s often <br/>
virtually impossible to arrange. He has a few very close friends, and has <br/>
never been a social animal. Mostly he&#39;s very happy with adults or by himself, <br/>
but he REALLY wishes his best friend lived with us.<br/>
