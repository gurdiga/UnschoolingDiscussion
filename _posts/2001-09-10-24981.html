<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774913646"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are the one who initially said that your kids &quot;had&quot; to do some<br/>
&gt; writing<br/>
&gt;&gt; every day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No I didn&#39;t I said:<br/>
&gt; For example, they have to write (physically) a certain amount each week.<br/>
&gt; They choose what and when.  If they want to write jokes or a term paper<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s fine by me as long as they write something.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hourly or daily or weekly (or monthly or yearly or decade-ly) isn&#39;t the part<br/>
that matters. The &quot;have to write a certain amount&quot; or even &quot;have to write&quot;<br/>
is the part that matters.<br/>
<br/>
No, I take that back, it&#39;s not even the &quot;have to write&quot;, it&#39;s the &quot;have to&quot;<br/>
in regards to their education. If it were math or science or reading or art,<br/>
it would be the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Enforced education, enforced schoolwork, is not unschooling. That is the<br/>
crux. The frequency is just an accessory after the fact.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Bridget, no one is saying that you&#39;re wrong to homeschool the way you do.<br/>
It works for you and your family.  Each family has an individual style.<br/>
<br/>
What people here are saying is that by &quot;requiring schoolwork&quot; even if the<br/>
content of such is of their choosing, then that is not true unschooling,<br/>
where all of life is learning and isn&#39;t divided into any subjects.  Nobody<br/>
really cares how you homeschool, just that you not hold yourself out as an<br/>
example of a true unschooler, for reasons already stated numerous times.<br/>
<br/>
You are a good parent and are doing fine by your kids.  This list is for<br/>
opening up your eyes to possibilities you may not have considered before (ie<br/>
relaxing even more with schoolwork and life) and trusting that your<br/>
wonderful kids will make the right choices.  They will learn a lot about<br/>
life if they are allowed to make mistakes.  Be there as their support.<br/>
