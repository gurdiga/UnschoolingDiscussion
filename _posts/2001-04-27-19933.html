<br/>
I&#39;m really happy to hear you&#39;re feeling much better.  I was wondering what <br/>
you were taking- and very happy to hear you got the colloidal silver!  It&#39;s <br/>
amazing, and you need so little of it to do the job.  I&#39;m thinking of <br/>
investing in a little colloidal silver making &quot;machine&quot;.  It&#39;s a little over <br/>
a hundred dollars, I think, and definately worth it IMO.  And yay to the <br/>
soup!  That always does wonders!  :-)<br/>

its real name though.<br/>

&lt;&lt; There are *four* spiders that are considered poisonous in the U.S.  The <br/>
Hobo<br/>
 spider (originanlly from Europe and now spreading from Washington state<br/>
 where it arrived in the 20s or 30s via ship) is also sometimes known as the<br/>
 boxing spider. &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
    Thank you Lynda!That is it the Hobo spider. They are wild. <br/>
