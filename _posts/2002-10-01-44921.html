&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m feeling vulnerable and uncertain<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, I hate to hear you are feeling that way, but I really understand. <br/>
Second, I wonder how a therapist can ask you to keep the kids out of the <br/>
issue of homeschooling, when the kids are the issue!? It sounds like the <br/>
therapist is already judging you (although, we don&#39;t have the other two sides <br/>
of the story) and that isn&#39;t her job. Her job is to help you and your husband <br/>
learn to communicate with each other, so you can learn to work through your <br/>
problems.<br/>
<br/>
I would gather a good list of books and web sites that deal with unschooling <br/>
and non-coercive parenting and give this to the therapist and your husband at <br/>
your next session. I would tell them both that you would be more than willing <br/>
to discuss their concerns after they have read a few selections from your <br/>
list. Because you feel that the discussion would be more productive after <br/>
everyone is more informed and on the same page with these issues. You should <br/>
probably go over the list as well and be able to present your *arguement* in <br/>
a clear, concise manner, without being defensive.<br/>
<br/>
I would also try looking into finding a therapist who is open and supportive <br/>
of attachment, non-corecive parenting and alternative education philosophies. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you guys see her together only, or do you each meet with her seperately <br/>
and then together? Years ago, when Darin and I were having problems, we saw a <br/>
therapist who would meet with us for about 5 minutes or so each, at the <br/>
beginning of the session and then we would all go in together. As we learned <br/>
to air our differences without all the *he said she said* crap, we didn&#39;t <br/>
meet separate as much. It was a huge help to be able to articulate what was <br/>
bothering us without the other sitting there making the typical *noises* <br/>
(sighs, snorts and groans) and the angry body language (crossed arms, raised <br/>
eyebrows, tapping feet, rolling eyes) And the therapist didn&#39;t comment then, <br/>
she would wait till we were together and present the problem in better words, <br/>
to the other person, than we knew how to use at the time. <br/>
Hope this helps, FWIW.<br/>
Good Luck! :o)<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not up on all the details, because I&#39;ve decided that I don&#39;t<br/>
subscribe to the main TCS idea... BUT...<br/>
<br/>
I think it would probably help you with the therapist and maybe your<br/>
husband if you call it &quot;looking for win-win solutions&quot; and &quot;creative<br/>
problem solving&quot;.  (Popular American buzzwords.  You may have to<br/>
translate them into your local lingo, but I hope you can get my drift. <br/>
Use really nice-sounding psychologist speech if you can.  It takes away<br/>
one of the psychologist&#39;s most effective weapons. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s over-simplified and maybe a bit misleading but you could describe<br/>
TCS as looking for a solution that meets everyone&#39;s needs.  [1]  Then,<br/>
if such a solution can&#39;t be found, a **compromise** would be reached. <br/>
(Flatter the therapist a little by sounding like you are incorporating<br/>
her ideas.)  I would downplay the idea that compromise would almost<br/>
never be required.  I don&#39;t think she&#39;s likely to believe that.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
footnote [1]  I think this idea, finding a solution that meets all<br/>
needs, can be philosophically connected back to what the therapist was<br/>
trying to change/fix about your problem solving process with your<br/>
husband.  I&#39;m guessing, since you said that things are messed up, the<br/>
two of you **don&#39;t** work together constructively to find mutually<br/>
satisfactory solutions to stuff -- right?  Does he not &quot;take you<br/>
seriously&quot;?  Or do you not take him seriously?  Does he start right off<br/>
the bat yelling, or does he aggravate you so that you end up yelling in<br/>
one minute flat?  (Don&#39;t answer my questions, I know that&#39;s personal.) <br/>
But you WISH you could successfully work stuff out with him -- right? <br/>
Or do you just think it would be tons easier to be single?  (Don&#39;t<br/>
answer that either!)  I think the therapist, at least somewhat, supports<br/>
your desire to have interpersonal differences solved in a respectful<br/>
way.  I think, like Sandra pointed out, that process may be what the<br/>
therapist wants to focus on.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-911320701">The tcs site lists some books which are good.<br/>
<br/>
Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/Books/booklist.html">http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/Books/booklist.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I have always wanted to try the books by Jan Fortune-Wood, but couldn&#39;t. I do believe that would be a good place to start.<br/>
<br/>
I use to subscribe to the list but my children actually were against it, despite the number of times I tried to tell them about it, and have them write the list and get them involved. I really have come to the conclusion that we are the parents and do need to set some boundaries, however, I think micro-control is bad, and talking is the best and most effective method for most children to discipline.  <br/>
<br/>
But these books should satisfy your needs...<br/>
<br/>
Be well,<br/>
hope everything works out...<br/>
