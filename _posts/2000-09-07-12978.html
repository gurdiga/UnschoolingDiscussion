<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332250068">&quot;She didn&#39;t know she was pregnant!!!  How on earth do you ~DO~ that???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, if my best friend hadn&#39;t been a medical student, I might have been<br/>
to the third trimester before I noticed.  I thought I had the flu. .<br/>
.kept getting nauseated, was never hungry, had no energy.  When I<br/>
mentioned it to her, she said, &quot;Go check your blood pressure at the drug<br/>
store.  If it&#39;s low, you better get a pregnancy test.&quot;  Et, voila!  I<br/>
found out I was about 2 months along.<br/>
<br/>
I had REALLY bad lower-back pains for a couple of (non-consecutive) days<br/>
in the early days of my third trimester and some pain at the bottom of<br/>
my rib cage when he was at the &quot;stretching&quot; stage, but other than that<br/>
and a need to pee frequently I didn&#39;t have any detectable symptoms until<br/>
the baby came out (I couldn&#39;t even feel my contractions--just an<br/>
irresistable urge to bear down).  I didn&#39;t start to look pregnant (as<br/>
opposed to just slightly chunckier than before I concieved) until about<br/>
39 weeks.  Of course I could feel him wiggling around at the appropriate<br/>
stage, and I HOPE that would&#39;ve tipped me off, but even the first couple<br/>
of months of that just felt like gas in a funny location.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good thing she figured it out.  It took me all the time I had to<br/>
adjust to the idea.  Some days I think I still haven&#39;t figured out it&#39;s<br/>
for real, and he&#39;s 3!<br/>
