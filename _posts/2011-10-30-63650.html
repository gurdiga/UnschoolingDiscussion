&quot;Long ago, gathered around the fire, human beings created language. But what did they talk about?   Undoubtedly, the first words ever uttered must have been . . . Tell me a story.  <br/>
<br/>
This is, the greatest connection we all share: our stories.   Film is your 21st Century version of ancient fireside storytelling-with filmmakers as your modern day shamans, sitting around a virtual campfire, passing down myths and dreams. &quot;<br/>
