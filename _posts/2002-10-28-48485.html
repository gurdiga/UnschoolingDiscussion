<div id="ygrps-yiv-584317242">I joined this list a while ago, but have been too busy reading the <br/>
numerous *lively* posts to add my intro.  I have a small window of <br/>
opportunity now, so here goes.  I am Carol and I have been married to Bud for <br/>
24 years.  Our son Colton is 12.  He was adopted at birth in an open, private <br/>
adoption, and I unschool him.  Jimmie is 11.  He&#39;s been with us for two <br/>
years, first as a foster son and then we adopted him a year and a half ago.  <br/>
He is in public school, which is a whole other post.  Suffice to say, I had <br/>
him at home for a year and then we had to make the difficult and painful <br/>
decision to put him in public school.  Kayla is 2 1/2, still foster at this <br/>
point, but we will be adopting her next year.<br/>
<br/>
   My question concerns Jimmie.  It was exactly 2 years ago today that he <br/>
came to live with us.  A victim of early neglect and abuse, he went through a <br/>
staggering eleven foster placements before coming to us.  His emotional <br/>
baggage was and still is heavy.  My question is not so much about Jimmie <br/>
himself, because I think we will always be dealing with the same problems on <br/>
some level.  My question is a selfish one, and it is for me.  I am exhausted <br/>
from parenting this child.  I am discouraged.  I have been emotionally and <br/>
physically battered by him.  I have been lied to and manipulated on a regular <br/>
basis.  I have cleaned up after his physical attacks on our home when he is <br/>
feeling angry.  All that said, I am still as committed to him as ever.  But <br/>
can someone tell me how I can keep going when my spirit is broken?  Just <br/>
getting out of bed and facing the challenges of the day is monumental for me. <br/>
 I know it is not my place to change Jimmie, and I respect his wounded soul.  <br/>
But how do I keep doing this?<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Carol<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you should.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever your decisions or solutions for Jimmie (and I hope <br/>
you&#39;ll get good advice about such here and elsewhere and <br/>
anywhere), I think you should ask this question to yourself: Why <br/>
are you adopting another child when you personally are not <br/>
physically safe from the child you currently have, and your spirit is <br/>
broken? What kind of family are you in a position to offer her? <br/>
What kind of mother? What kind of siblings? (Mom: broken? <br/>
Sibling: breaker?)<br/>
<br/>
I am not without sympathy for Jimmie, nor without sympathy for <br/>
you, but my main sympathy is with your other son and with the <br/>
toddler you are planning to bring into this situation. She is not a <br/>
problem or a solution, but from what you have told us you are <br/>
setting her up to be a victim, physically and/or emotionally.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you were just temporarily batty (happens to a lot of us &lt;g&gt;) in <br/>
your first post and didn&#39;t really mean the things you said, please <br/>
clarify so we can understand better.<br/>
<br/>
In this medium all we have are words, and I have to take them at <br/>
face value. You said Jimmie is physically abusive at least to you <br/>
(and I don&#39;t see why that wouldn&#39;t transfer to another child if he <br/>
felt he could best control his world that way, even if it hasn&#39;t yet, <br/>
but I don&#39;t have a lot of experience with physically abusive <br/>
relationships so maybe I&#39;m all wet on that one) and your <br/>
statements about being beyond what you can handle, and how <br/>
can you go on, etc.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I understood that Jimmie is already adopted -- my <br/>
question was the advisability of adopting the little girl when it <br/>
sounded like you were not able to cope with life with Jimmie as it <br/>
is. When there is that kind of stress (again, can only go on what <br/>
you told us) I, personally, don&#39;t see it as fair to adopt a third child <br/>
into that situation when you&#39;re broken yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can give some specifics of a problem situation in your <br/>
house -- what you did, what Jimmie did, how you reacted to each <br/>
other. There are some pretty perceptive people here who might <br/>
be able to help you pinpoint things you can try differently in future.<br/>

&lt;&lt;All that said, I am still as committed to him as ever.  But can someone <br/>
tell me how I can keep going when my spirit is broken?  Just getting out of <br/>
bed and facing the challenges of the day is monumental for me.<br/>
I know it is not my place to change Jimmie, and I respect his wounded soul. <br/>
But how do I keep doing this?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not really knowing the situation but what little you told and not really <br/>
being in that family, it&#39;s hard to say. For one, I hope there is counseling <br/>
for your son and the family as a whole. It doesn&#39;t just affect you, but the <br/>
other children as well. Even if you don&#39;t see it right now. Even if the <br/>
conflict is only between you and your son. It still trickles down onto the <br/>
other children. So I think counseling is a must. Second, I&#39;m thinking here <br/>
that you are making sure that the children are safe from his anger as well. <br/>
You mentioned he takes it out on your house. I&#39;m also thinking you mean <br/>
throwing stuff or destroying household things and not throwing at someone or <br/>
wrecking the other kids stuff. Still bad enough to live with, still damaging <br/>
emotionally, just not physically. Yes?<br/>
Thirdly, I hear you say you want to go on. That you are committed, and <br/>
that&#39;s most of it right there. You aren&#39;t throwing in the towel even though <br/>
you are stressed and tired. Some parents do just give up and maybe that&#39;s <br/>
what your son is expecting. Seems like everyone else did on him, right? <br/>
Maybe he&#39;s just trying to help the situation and hurry it along. So he can&#39;t <br/>
get too comfortable and loved before you send him on his way.<br/>
I don&#39;t have any quick easy answers, but look at it this way. You could be <br/>
the one and only person to ever make a difference in this boys life. You <br/>
seem to really want to make that difference. I think that says a lot right <br/>
there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-724128812">I don&#39;t personally have any experiences like yours, but someone on another one of my lists takes foster children, often teenagers, and they are often angry and have problems controlling their anger. She signs those up for some form of karate with a great guy that lives next door to her, they learn a lot about anger management and self-control from him. Plus they learn how to defend themselves, and that helps a lot when their anger comes from fear of abuse. She has a punching bag hung up in her garage, and they go out there for a few rounds when they&#39;re upset. BTW, I think what you&#39;re doing is wonderful!!!!<br/>

about this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t going to respond to the post, but after reading this particular section, I felt that maybe I did have<br/>
something to offer.  I was abused by several adults while I was a child and although I will not get into<br/>
the specifics, I do want to tell you what it did to me.  The biggest thing that happened was that I stopped<br/>
trusting adults, period.  Even when I moved away from the situation and into a safe one, I did not trust<br/>
these adults either.  Once you are burned by authority figures, that&#39;s it (or it was for me).  He will have<br/>
an extremely difficult time trusting adults for the rest of his life no matter what you do.<br/>
<br/>
This might sound like there is no hope, but that isn&#39;t true.  You are his hope and your job at this point<br/>
is to give love and acceptance.  When a child is abused, they grow up really quickly and if put in the<br/>
situation, can take care of themselves if they need to.  He can take care of himself physically, but you<br/>
are there to help him with his spirit.  He will find it when the time is right, but it will only be because he<br/>
did have someone there to offer him the unconditional love he deserves.  Love him, bless him, and care<br/>
for him.<br/>
<br/>
In every situation, always ask....what would love do now?  And act on that.<br/>
<br/>
Also, don&#39;t be so hard on yourself.  If you need to take some time for you, then take it.  You are no good<br/>
to him or the rest of the family if you let yourself get to this point.  The above question should be asked<br/>
when it comes to you to.  What would love do now?  If you haven&#39;t read it yet, this book might be of some<br/>
help to you..........Conversations with God by Neale Donald Walsch (it&#39;s not religious).  Also, if Jimmie is <br/>
a reader, he might like to read the teen version of the book.  (just a suggestion)<br/>

they didn&#39;t work out.  Anyway, I&#39;m feeling better today, a bit more together <br/>

situation.  But I&#39;m just listening to a tape of the book Touching Spirit<br/>
Bear (I think that&#39;s the title) and thought that Jimmie might like to hear<br/>
it.  It&#39;s about a 15 year old boy from an abusive home who has been in<br/>
trouble most of his life.  Now he&#39;s in really big trouble because of all his<br/>
anger, and he&#39;s banished to a remote island for a year as part of a<br/>
restorative justice circle.  Jimmie might be able to relate to Cole&#39;s anger,<br/>
and there&#39;s a lot in the book about native healing practices and learning<br/>
take responsibility for where your life is going now.  I got it from our<br/>
library.<br/>

Perhaps by not adding yet another child.<br/>
I have some harsh feelings about this because my parents took in two cousins <br/>
who had been neglected, and one abused, and the abused girl &quot;sexualized&quot; my <br/>
younger sister.   That was never told until we were all grown.  My parents <br/>
broke up when I was 17.  My older cousin was 18, and took a live-in <br/>
babysitting job.  The younger ones were 15 (my mean, violent cousin) and 14 <br/>
(my sister, who denies being messed up by that breakup, but I could tell you <br/>
stories for two hours).<br/>
<br/>
My own childhood was crowded badly by my parents&#39; need to help my mother&#39;s <br/>
sister&#39;s children.  That might be another reason I liked school.  At school <br/>
it was just me, not me and my cousin (except in band, and sometimes <br/>
socially). <br/>
<br/>
The reason my aunt couldn&#39;t raise her own girls (she had three older boys, <br/>
one of whom ended up shot dead, the next in various misdemeanor problems and <br/>
the middle of the five moved far away and stayed clean) was alcoholism.  When <br/>
we took her daughters I was seven.  Within that next ten years my mother <br/>
succumbed to alcoholism herself.<br/>
<br/>
There are genetic factors that can&#39;t always be overcome.  Even without the <br/>
abuse and neglect, he is genetically a part of people who will abuse and <br/>
neglect.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of wonderful adoption stories in the world, and some <br/>
nightmares.  I know some of both personally.<br/>
<br/>
There must be some really terrible factors for you to need school to help.  <br/>
<br/>
I would be afraid for a little girl being so close in with a child with such <br/>
problems.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was molested (with the fingers of two little boys) when she was one <br/>
year old.  It led to the breakup of a group I had really loved, because one <br/>
of the moms had a boy who was being sexual to other children and she saw no <br/>
problem with it at all.  <br/>
<br/>
My sister was molested and was afraid to tell my parents, because she was <br/>
(rightly so) physically afraid of my younger cousin (who was a year older <br/>
than she was).  That cousin hit me once, when we were ten and twelve of so, <br/>
until she was tired of hitting.  I just curled up and took it, protecting my <br/>
face and stomach, because she was strong, furious, and had little to no <br/>
conscience.<br/>
<br/>
Had I told, she would have gotten a spanking, and then later something of <br/>
mine would have disappeared or been destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
I realize this isn&#39;t the type of response you&#39;re hoping for.  I hope others <br/>
have good ideas to help you keep doing what you&#39;re doing.  <br/>
<br/>
My heart goes out to children who have been abused and neglected.  When my <br/>
mother left my dad, she got pregnant within two years.  That boy was <br/>
neglected and abused bigtime, and he has never been a useful adult.  Both his <br/>
parents were alcoholics, my mother was drunk when she went into labor.  They <br/>
married after he was born, and that lasted three years.  Altogether a horror <br/>
story.  <br/>
<br/>
I took him in then, and again when he was thirteen.  Being his sister didn&#39;t <br/>
save me from the lying and drug use and stealing from us.  I talked my mom <br/>
into going to AA so she could be given custody again.  He&#39;s never held a job <br/>
longer than a month and a half, and he&#39;s 30 now.<br/>
<br/>
Can your marriage survive through this to the point where all three children <br/>
are up and out?<br/>
If it can&#39;t what will become of each of them?  What will become of the parent <br/>
who ends up with custody of the middle boy?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the solution, but I do see more problems, just by setting it out <br/>
next to my own formative years.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good thing I was in college when I was seventeen, living in a dorm, <br/>
because there was no home to go back to by Spring break.<br/>
<br/>
I feel I was no help at all, but maybe I&#39;ll be the only one with a view of <br/>
&quot;the other side,&quot; so I&#39;ll post this anyway.<br/>

Whoo hoo, conga rats on that one!!! I think you just get frustrated at times <br/>
maybe wanting to be able to do more than you are and possibly wanting things <br/>
to get better faster. A very natural reaction when a parent sees a child <br/>
hurting.<br/>
I think you are certainly on the right track in watching and making sure the <br/>
anger isn&#39;t directed at the other children. I think the karate idea was a <br/>
good one and also again, counseling. You never said if that was being done <br/>
and I think it is important. You can do this. You are doing it and I think <br/>
it&#39;s wonderful that you have the patience and love to offer.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a regular  basis.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was a foster kid, for a while. I was the &quot;bad&quot; kid - I smoked pot in my<br/>
bedroom, snuck out at night, swore at my foster mom. My foster brother<br/>
was a year and a half younger, small for his age, shy, wanting to please.<br/>
He had no friends, but he was a nice kid, and we got along.<br/>
<br/>
When twenty dollars went missing from my foster mom&#39;s purse, she accused<br/>
me, and even though I didn&#39;t take it, she was never convinced.When my<br/>
foster brother and my friend and I were in his room once with the door<br/>
shut, talking about school and stuff, she burst in and told me I could<br/>
never be with him with the door shut. I never hurt him. I never stole<br/>
from her. I liketo think that maybe hanging out with outspoken me was<br/>
part of the reason he finally decided to tell the foster mom that the old<br/>
guy living next door had been molesting him for over a year. Afterwards,<br/>
I told him I&#39;d kick the guy&#39;s butt if he tried anything again, and showed<br/>
him my knife.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;m going with this - I guess I wish you&#39;d been my<br/>
foster mom, and I want to thank you for trying, and assure you that it<br/>
matters.<br/>
<br/>
With all that said, you do need to take care of yourself, and to take<br/>
care of Colton and Kayla. It is easy to let a kid like Jimmie suck up all<br/>
your energy and leave you dry, because he clearly needs so much. You just<br/>
can&#39;t be the only one giving to him, and part of modeling how to be<br/>
healthy includes modeling how to take care of your own needs. Sometimes,<br/>
I think parents need to make a choice that isn&#39;t the best thing for their<br/>
child, because it is necessary for their own mental health. Do you gte<br/>
out once a week or more and just do something for you - take a ceramics<br/>
class, join a choir, sit in the woods and read? You need that, and Jimmie<br/>
needs you to have that so you&#39;ll be able to be there for him.<br/>
<br/>
Are there services available through the agency he was placed through?<br/>
Things like counseling, respite, maybe a Big Brother or something similar<br/>
for him? Do you have friends who can take him for a while? Or friends who<br/>
can take the other two, so you can just be with him?<br/>
<br/>
How is school for him? I taught ED/BD kids, and I was the outlier because<br/>
I didn&#39;t do a strict behavior mod thing - I focused on building<br/>
relationships and using them as a stepping stone to growth and change. If<br/>
 he&#39;s getting behavior mod and points and levels all day, he may need to<br/>
act out at home to undue the damage from school.<br/>

more time to recharge myself.  It&#39;s easy to get swept away by life&#39;s demands, <br/>
but I am going to do better at meeting my own needs so I can continue to meet <br/>
the needs of my family.  I took one step yesterday when I went back to my <br/>

place where I can reconnect with myself and find peace. <br/>

Jimmie really needs.  The counselor mostly wanted to talk to just him, and <br/>
Jimmie is a great little actor.  He wasn&#39;t honest with her at all.  I am <br/>
going to contact someone at my church for ideas on family counseling.  And we <br/>
will be contacting friends about taking some or all of our kids.  I have a <br/>
superwoman mentality where it is very difficult for me to ask for help, but I <br/>
am very aware right now of how much I need it.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I never thought I would say this, but the past few months Jimmie has spent <br/>
&gt; in public school have been good for him.  He&#39;s happy there, but what I see <br/>
&gt; is that he is gradually learning to take responsibility for his actions.  <br/>
&gt; We have put the responsibility for his work right on his shoulders, and he <br/>
&gt; is making progress.  He has always blamed things on someone else, but <br/>
&gt; school is his deal and what happens is his choice.  I would love the chance <br/>
&gt; to unschool him, but frankly I believe he&#39;s where he needs to be for now.<br/>

charmed the pants off of tens of police and counselors and mental health <br/>

can keep him from being arrested when he does his thing, because he can fool <br/>
anyone.  The stories she tells would stand your hair on end, and it&#39;s a grave <br/>
injustice to her that he cannot be put in a home and cannot leave hers.  He&#39;s <br/>
lucky to have her to take care of him, but he cannot appreciate that.  If she <br/>
had it to do over again, she readily admits that she wouldn&#39;t, and she warns <br/>
other people about how the adoption people lied to her.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something about the things you said about Jimmie that remind me of my <br/>
friend&#39;s son.  I only know what you say about him, of course, but it would be <br/>
in your whole family&#39;s best interest to find out everything you can about his <br/>
birth and his birth mother before you adopt him.  <br/>

My half brother exactly.  When we have taken him to counselors he turns on <br/>
the charm, makes up a whole life that makes him seem sweet yet slightly <br/>
mistreated.  I DO feel sorry for him, because the truth of his life is sordid <br/>
and sad, but he just makes stuff up as easily as most people breathe.<br/>
<br/>
A judge met him on an outward bound trip and told all the counsellors there <br/>
they must have made a mistake, that this boy was FINE.<br/>
<br/>
He had a full week&#39;s worth of charm.<br/>
<br/>
He married a Mormon girl once.  Her family drove them both to Utah where they <br/>
could be married legally at their young ages.  On Christmas morning before <br/>
others woke up, he stole cash from his new stepmother, a truck from his new <br/>
wife&#39;s uncle, and took off.<br/>
<br/>
If he ever could keep track of what he&#39;s done and if he could feel remorse, <br/>
maybe he could change.  And, of course, he drinks.  What chance would he have <br/>
of NOT being an alcoholic in his circumstances?  Genetics and fetal alcohol <br/>
syndrome all.<br/>

I had no intention of speaking up much on this list since I hoped to learn a lot and listen but I had to say here that if you have a child with this exact description and possibly the addition of frequent broken bones, small jaw line so there is no room for their permanent teeth, low muscle tone, extra weight around the mid-torso, most have a cherubic or very young look  and a dozen other things that you could be dealing with Growth Hormone Defiency.  GHD is a serious problem that needs treatment so be sure and have your child checked out if you see the need.  GHD can have serious effects on the cardiovascular system and decreases bone density if not treated.  Emotional/Behavioral symptoms plus learning problems are part of all of this but you won&#39;t hear a lot of US doctors admit this part, plus the child is small and doesn&#39;t neccesarily have to be &quot;off the charts&quot;.  My 13 yr old has severe GHD and we spent years going down the wrong path with him.<br/>
Just had to speak up, in case, it helped you Carol, or someone else.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone needs more info -- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.magicfoundation.org">http://www.magicfoundation.org</a> is a good place to start.<br/>

It was really strange to read an exact description of my son.  Some days he is such a charmer and other days we wonder if he has a conscience at all.  It&#39;s a challenge!<br/>
