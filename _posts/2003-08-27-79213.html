<div id="ygrps-yiv-160876863">&quot;JP was fine zipping about on his own and playing <br/>
with Pam G&#39;s boys.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
PAM G WAS THERE??? Ack!! Tell me how I missed THAT! Geez, I love your posts Pam G....tell me I DID meet you and I&#39;m just blanking out from seeing so many new faces in such a short time.  I feel like a doofus.<br/>

As to the correct Heidi, that was Heidi Case that made both the Fairy girl and the &quot;get outa hell free&quot; card, she&#39;s one CREATIVE chick! Her email is the &quot;badobilz&quot; one. It gets a bit confusing with all these Heidi&#39;s, Kelly&#39;s and Pam&#39;s!<br/>
