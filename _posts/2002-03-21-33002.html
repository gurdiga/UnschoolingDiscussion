<div id="ygrps-yiv-900170012">My oldest son, 12, has sought out the military. He is in Civil Air<br/>
Patrol.... Cadet Airman Baker is his title :-)  We unschool, yet he excells<br/>
at CAP. It is very structured, very military.. shoes shined, uniform<br/>
perfect, hat 2 fingers above the eyebrow..on and on and on.. I didn&#39;t think<br/>
he would do well with it or like it, to be quite honest!  He loves it!!!!!<br/>
He has &quot;schoolish&quot; workbooks and lessons and tests...he excells at them all.<br/>
He has gained rank and passed enough tests to go to a summer encampent at<br/>
Ft. Leonardwood.  So I think unschoolers and the military would just kinda<br/>
depend on the unschooler.<br/>
