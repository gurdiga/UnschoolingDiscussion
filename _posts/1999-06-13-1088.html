is why i question so much. I have to do a sort of log for our evaluator. I<br/>
am in Pa. but not as much as i have been doing. i kind of like not having<br/>
to write everything. but i may just write down the positive changes i see<br/>
and what works. did anyone find this helpful.<br/>

live in a culture where our chosen lifestyle is considered alternative, and<br/>
therefor we must constantly be explaining, validating, describing it to<br/>
&quot;well wishers&quot; and hostiles alike.  Most of you have to participate in<br/>
yearly evaluations, or testing, or both, and must do nearly constant<br/>
qualifying of your chosen lifestyle to some friend or family member.  We<br/>
also do not want to limit our children&#39;s opportunities, and so must ensure,<br/>
for our own peace of mind, that they have all the necessary skills to enter<br/>
a college of their choice, if they so choose.  <br/>
<br/>
This is not an apprentice culture, where hands on learning is appreciated<br/>
as a valid means of education.  They all want to see that piece of paper,<br/>
see what your qualifications are (with a very few exeptions, of course.)<br/>
We are trying to provide documentation to show that our children REALLY did<br/>
get an education.  In other words, we are living defensively, protecting<br/>
ourselves and our children, as is human nature.<br/>

Very few states have yearly evaluations or tests. Some have none.  Some have <br/>
every other year, or three years out of twelve.<br/>
<br/>
For the most part, people really truly don&#39;t *have* to keep records.  Some <br/>
want to.  <br/>
<br/>
There are unschooling families with no school-looking records at all, and <br/>
when/if their kids have a need they take college SATs or a GED or ACT and <br/>
they do fine!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My 11 yos has a paper route as I&#39;ve mentioned before. His customers just<br/>
adore him and one of them nominated him for carrier of the week.  He had to<br/>
give the newspaper company a picture of himself and fill out a questionaire<br/>
for the article on him that would appear.His district manager told him to<br/>
specify that he was homeschooled where it asked for school name which he<br/>
did.  It also asked what his grades were, I suggested to him that he write<br/>
something to the effect that he was doing very well.  Anyway, yesterday his<br/>
picture and article were in the paper.  As we read it we found they<br/>
highlighted the fact that he was homeschooled, but then they added that he<br/>
had an A average. He never wrote a grade on this, we don&#39;t grade anything<br/>
here, never did as we don&#39;t believe in grades. I was peturbed that they did<br/>
that, but then I realized that they probably have very little first hand<br/>
knowledge of how many ways there are to hs.  Guess it will take a while<br/>
longer for people to catch on.  BUT WHY is a grade so important??? <br/>

not only that he learned a particular subject for that year, but I have to<br/>
know how many days we have &quot;logged&quot; or how many hours he&#39;s accumulated in a<br/>
subject.  For example, 60-120 days would only earn him 1/2 a credit, any<br/>
thing over 120 earns 1 credit.  What gets me is that the state won&#39;t give<br/>
him a diploma or in anyother way recognize him as graduating so why should<br/>
we have to worry about the credits. It&#39;s just their way of trying to<br/>
control us. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015211145">I did not say we HAD to keep records for ourselves, I said that we did it<br/>
as a defense in a culture that requires us to &#39;prove&#39; that our kids are<br/>
learning, in one way or another.  Even if it is just to our judgemental<br/>
parents or to our own battered and beleagured consciences.  Living in<br/>
Idaho, I don&#39;t have to keep any type of official records, take any tests at<br/>
all or submit to evaluations.  Something that some of my friends say is<br/>

and friends about WHY we have to do testing in this state. I don&#39;t even know <br/>
why, but I always end up giving some quick response about the tests helping <br/>
us be sure our kids are learning. I don&#39;t believe this my self but it seems <br/>
to be the answer non-homeschoolers are looking for. As far as we are <br/>
concerned the tests (which we haven&#39;t had to do yet) only serve to judge a <br/>
child&#39;s ability based on the school systems standards. Now that I think about <br/>
it, I have no idea how I will explain the tests to our son next year. It <br/>
could end up being quite traumatic. <br/>

<br/>
Kelly, are you in Washington State?  I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t remember ...  The <br/>
reason there are tests in Wa. has a bit of a history.  Someone can jump in <br/>
and correct me on it if they know better. <br/>
<br/>
When the law was being written the Legislature originally wanted to do what <br/>
Oregon did and remand kids to school if they didn&#39;t pass with a certain <br/>
score.  At which point the grass roots people were able to pose the question, <br/>
well do you remand public school students to homeschool if they don&#39;t make <br/>
the score?  People were able to make the case that unlike schools, testing <br/>
isn&#39;t essential in a one on one situation.  However, there were those in the <br/>
legislature that just had the tests are good opinion and a good reference for <br/>
parents.  Compromise....  we must test/evaluate, but they are for our <br/>
information and guidance....<br/>
<br/>
They guide me enough that I ignore the results.  And, that&#39;s okay too....<br/>

Thanks Charlotte. We are in Minnesota and although we are required to test <br/>
yearly we are not required to share the results with anyone. I am still <br/>
learning the law though. I find that my district, while supportive, has no <br/>
clue about the law. When I first told them we were Homeschooling they told me <br/>
I had to come in and see them so they could see my &quot;curriculum&quot; ! I didn&#39;t <br/>
think this was right but I wasn&#39;t sure. After a few calls to some other <br/>
homeschoolers it became clear that I had to start educating myself on the <br/>
law. I just got my full copy of the law this week.<br/>
