They can enter school and daycare.  Usually you just sign a waiver.  My <br/>
oldest three are partially vaccinated and my youngest three aren&#39;t at all.  <br/>
They are all very healthy but I don&#39;t do antibiotics and they all weaned from <br/>
the breast in their own time too.  I would read everything you can find on <br/>
vaxing and not-vaxing(pro and con) to help you decide.  Kimme</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358903758">well, you had to get me started, didn&#39;t you? :)<br/>
my ds (6 in may) had the first shots when he was born<br/>
and then the first two installments of the hep b shots<br/>
before I decided - purely out of instinct- that they<br/>
weren&#39;t good for him. When I was pregnant with dd (3)<br/>
I read up on it alot cuz I was trying to the most<br/>
natural route with her birth and everything<br/>
thereafter, and found out alot of things that led me<br/>
to believe that yes, they do accomplish some good in<br/>
some kids and in some countries, but in my kids, who<br/>
aren&#39;t exposed to all the germs in school or daycare,<br/>
etc, in a fairly (bite my tongue) clean country, etc,<br/>
they would do more harm than good. dd hasn&#39;t had any<br/>
shots ever in her life and is perfectly fine, other<br/>
than being a bit tempestuous at times. :) A good book<br/>
that talks about it a bit is &quot;Raising a Healthy Child<br/>
- In Spite of Your Doctor&quot; by....hm... ?John?<br/>
Mendelsohn? I think. <br/>
Also if you go to Mothering.com they have alot of<br/>
resources and articles about it, from both viewpoints,<br/>
in what seems to be a very unbiased way. <br/>
And depending on what state you live in, most of them,<br/>
as far as I know just leave out the part of the law<br/>
that says &quot;...without certificate of exemption.&quot;<br/>
as in you cannot enter school, etc, without signing a<br/>
paper that says you as thier parent choose for them to<br/>
be exempt and the one I had to sign (to go in thier<br/>
medical records) had a place to check off if it was<br/>
for medical reasons, religious beliefs or personal<br/>
beliefs. How easy is that? I &quot;personally believe&quot; it<br/>
isn&#39;t neccesary. A friend of mine gave none of her<br/>
three kids the shots and they went to school, but it<br/>
was just required that when there was an outbreak of<br/>
anything at school, that they took thier work home for<br/>
the week, til it passed. Was very easy for her.<br/>
Though I did have to fight with this one doctor who<br/>
was there cuz the kids regular doctor was out the day<br/>
of dd checkup...he ranted and raved (and I do mean<br/>
RANTED and RAVED and was very MAD) about how I was too<br/>
young to know what I was talking about (I was 21 at<br/>
the time, and he was in his late 40&#39;s/early 50&#39;s) and<br/>
I was harming my child and on and on and on and if I<br/>
had seen first hand a child die from complications of<br/>
measles (both kids have since had measles and got thru<br/>
it like it was a cold) and from polio etc, etc then I<br/>
would realize what a mistake I was making. It&#39;s<br/>
definitely a tough decision --(becuz there is alot of<br/>
fear put in you about the well-being of your child,<br/>
and even about them DYING, and at times I was very<br/>
tempted to just do it &quot;just to be safe&quot;, but otoh I<br/>
don&#39;t feel it IS safe) --and one that you may get a<br/>
lot of grief from others about, but if you have a good<br/>
support system and you&#39;re already used to getting<br/>
grief from people for unschooling and such then it&#39;s<br/>
alot easier. :)<br/>

I think the army just gives you whatever shots they want to, whenver they <br/>
want to.<br/>
Other armed services probably too, here and other nations as well.<br/>
<br/>
But whatever is the absolute policy in 2001 will not necessarily be the <br/>
policy in fifteen or eighteen years when babies born now are grown.  There <br/>
will be *SO* many uncircumcised, homeschooled, unvaccinated young adults then <br/>
that the policies will HAVE to change to accommodate them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023181720">If you are having your baby in a hospital, be sure and read the fine print.<br/>
All hospitals are now giving babies Hep B vaccines without getting informed<br/>
consent.  This vaccine can be deadly!  AND, even CDC agrees it is not<br/>
necessary for an infant!<br/>
<br/>
As to other vaccines, there are a million pros and cons but the bottomline<br/>
is that all research has shown that vaccines are extremely hard and<br/>
frequently adverse for infants.  Infants that are nursing are in most cases<br/>
&quot;immunized&quot; by the breast milk.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, less is more and waiting until a child is at least 5 before giving any<br/>
shots (if you decide to give shots) is to error on the side of caution and<br/>
safety!<br/>
<br/>
As to schools, daycares, jobs, etc. all have waivers you can sign.  That is,<br/>
except the military if you are shipping out somewhere and with the current<br/>
court case going on, that may change also.<br/>

the MMR, varicella and Prevnar. Not sure about the MMR, but we&#39;re definitely<br/>
not going with the varicella or Prevnar. That said, things will definitely<br/>
be different with our next child. I can&#39;t say that we&#39;ll go the way of no<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539430516">Try reading the very informative book &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot;.  There is<br/>
much about vaccinations that is not understood or even ever been<br/>
tested.  Education and making an informed decision is key.  If you nurse<br/>
your baby that is all the immunization it needs for at least the first<br/>
two years anyway.<br/>
There is growing evidence that the growing rates of crib death can be<br/>
attributed to vaccinations.  Vaccinations change babies&#39; breathing<br/>
patterns for weeks after receiving a shot. In countries where<br/>
vaccinations are delayed until 2 years of age (Sweden, Japan etc.), the<br/>
rate of crib death has dropped to nearly nil.<br/>
The only documented cases of polio in North America in recent years have<br/>
been from patients who have received the polio vaccine.<br/>
I chose to vaccinate my first two children but as I read and learned<br/>
more I did not vaccinate baby #3.  My kids have been exposed to<br/>
everything...whooping cough, you name it, and my 2 year old baby has<br/>
done just fine.  If you have a strong immune system these illnesses are<br/>
often tough to catch (I exposed my children to chicken pox 3 times and<br/>
they still did not contract the illness), and even if you do get it they<br/>
are not as threatening or &quot;deadly&quot; in developed countries with clean<br/>
water supply, good diet and proper sanitary conditions.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to ask questions and do your own research.  Don&#39;t blindly<br/>
follow what anyone else tells you or make a decision out of fear.  There<br/>
are loads of sites/links on vaccinations on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

P.S. Hepatitis B is exceedingly difficult to contract and is contracted<br/>
only by unsafe lifestyle practices: IV drug use, unprotected sex or sex<br/>
with a partner you probably shouldn&#39;t be doing it with anyway.  It is<br/>
contracted much like AIDS.  Vaccinating newborns for this is nearly<br/>
criminal in my opinion.  We should educate our children instead of<br/>
vaccinating them against such an easily preventable disease.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you are having your baby in a hospital, be sure and read the fine print.<br/>
&gt;All hospitals are now giving babies Hep B vaccines without getting informed<br/>
&gt;consent.  This vaccine can be deadly!  AND, even CDC agrees it is not<br/>
&gt;necessary for an infant!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As to other vaccines, there are a million pros and cons but the bottomline<br/>
&gt;is that all research has shown that vaccines are extremely hard and<br/>
&gt;frequently adverse for infants.  Infants that are nursing are in most cases<br/>
&gt;&quot;immunized&quot; by the breast milk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;IMHO, less is more and waiting until a child is at least 5 before giving <br/>
&gt;any<br/>
&gt;shots (if you decide to give shots) is to error on the side of caution and<br/>
&gt;safety!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As to schools, daycares, jobs, etc. all have waivers you can sign.  That <br/>
&gt;is,<br/>
&gt;except the military if you are shipping out somewhere and with the current<br/>
&gt;court case going on, that may change also.<br/>

and Hep A were tested on human guinea pigs (people who were not told they<br/>
were being given the vaccine) in Alaska and the Four Corners.  What CDC also<br/>
won&#39;t tell you is that these guinea pigs now have 10 times the neurological<br/>

&lt;&lt; There is growing evidence that the growing rates of crib death can be<br/>
attributed to vaccinations. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As well as to solitary sleep and  possibly formula feeding.<br/>

It&#39;s good to ask questions and do your own research.  Don&#39;t blindly<br/>
follow what anyone else tells you or make a decision out of fear.  There<br/>
are loads of sites/links on vaccinations on the internet.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

seen as irresponsible but many of those who vaccinate do it blindly without <br/>
any research.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-493040210">&lt;&lt;P.S. Hepatitis B is exceedingly difficult to contract and is contracted<br/>
only by unsafe lifestyle practices: IV drug use, unprotected sex or sex<br/>
with a partner you probably shouldn&#39;t be doing it with anyway.  It is<br/>
contracted much like AIDS.  Vaccinating newborns for this is nearly<br/>
criminal in my opinion.  We should educate our children instead of<br/>
vaccinating them against such an easily preventable disease.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, children who suffer sexual abuse are at risk and don&#39;t have<br/>
much of a say, unfortunately.  I think this factors into the decisions of<br/>
which vaccines, when, and why, even though the risks don&#39;t apply to a lot of<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
I have vaccinated my children, except chicken pox, and now that I have done<br/>
more research I probably would not have had some of the other ones, either,<br/>
and had partially vaccinated children.<br/>
<br/>
However, my son has had to have numerous blood and platelet transfusions<br/>
recently, and while our blood supply  is screened, is it truly 100% safe?<br/>
Of course not.  While I would forgo the Hep B shot if I had another child,<br/>
in retrospect I&#39;m kind of glad he had it, just in case.  Now I&#39;m hoping he<br/>
avoids the chicken pox (whose vaccine is a vaccine in search of a disease),<br/>
because he is at risk now for the complications.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of information out there.  Do your homework, ask questions of<br/>
health professionals (not all are vaccine pushers!) and make your decisions<br/>
accordingly.<br/>
