<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789275819"><blockquote><span title="qreply">&gt; Alert<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you receive an email entitled &quot;Bad times,&quot; delete<br/>
&gt; it immediately. Do not open it. Apparently this one<br/>
&gt; is pretty nasty. It will not only erase everything on<br/>
&gt; your hard drive, but it will also delete anything on<br/>
&gt; disks within 20 feet of your computer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It demagnetizes the stripes on ALL of your credit<br/>
&gt; cards. It reprograms your ATM access code, screws up<br/>
&gt; the tracking on your VCR and uses subspace field<br/>
&gt; harmonics to scratch any CD&#39;s you attempt to play.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It will re-calibrate your refrigerator&#39;s coolness<br/>
&gt; settings so all your ice cream melts and your milk<br/>
&gt; curdles.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It will program your phone auto dial to call only<br/>
&gt; your mother-in-law&#39;s number.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This virus will mix antifreeze into your fish tank.<br/>
&gt; It will drink all your beer. (For goodness sake man, are<br/>
&gt; you listening?!?!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It will leave dirty socks on the coffee table when<br/>
&gt; you are expecting company.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It will replace your shampoo with Nair and your Nair<br/>
&gt; with Rogaine, all while dating your current<br/>
&gt; boy/girlfriend behind your back and billing their<br/>
&gt; hotel rendezvous to your Visa card.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It will cause you to run with scissors and throw<br/>
&gt; things in a way that is only fun until someone loses<br/>
&gt; an eye.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It will rewrite your backup files, changing all your<br/>
&gt; active verbs to passive tense and incorporating<br/>
&gt; undetectable misspellings which grossly change the<br/>
&gt; interpretations of key sentences.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If the &quot;Badtimes&quot; message is opened in a Windows95/98<br/>
&gt; environment, it will leave the toilet seat up and<br/>
&gt; leave your hair dryer plugged in dangerously close to<br/>
&gt; a full bathtub.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It will not only remove the forbidden tags from your<br/>
&gt; mattresses and pillows, it will also refill your whole<br/>
&gt; milk with skim milk.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; **WARN AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN.**<br/>
&gt; <br/>
