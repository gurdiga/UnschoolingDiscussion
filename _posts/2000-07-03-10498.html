<div id="ygrps-yiv-705167168">Hi All,  I&#39;ve just rejoined the list.  I&#39;m unschooling along with 2 of our 3 children, 11 yo ds and 14 yo dd.  (17 yo ds in local ps, his choice.)  Anyway,  the older two taught themselves to read, no problem by the time they were 8 or so.  The youngest is not there yet!  I&#39;m trying not to worry, but it is hard.  When he was younger, he did not like to be read to.  The other two loved this.  My dd learned to read by writing.  SHe copied lots of story books then became able to read them.  My oldest learned to read when I refused to read Garfield comic books to him anymore!  Now the youngest is willing for me to read for him and actually asks me too.  HE can use the computer and is getting better at knowing the names and sounds of letters and sometimes figures out words but it is obviously challenging for him.  He sometimes reverses words, like popsicle is icicle pop, not a bad<br/>
description!  He also sometimes says today when he means tomorrow.  Anyway, I know he&#39;ll learn to read, I&#39;ve read GWS, I know there are late readers, but I&#39;d like some support!  Thanks!  Kathleen in NC</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-45398233">A home-ed contact of mine has 3 girls, the eldest is 20, she didn&#39;t <br/>
learn to read until about 10yo, she now works for the local <br/>
council&#39;s environmental department.  She went to school from <br/>
about 13yo, her choice too, and suffered no ill effects, apart from <br/>
finding out how silly and stereotypically &#39;girly&#39; the girls in the <br/>
school were...<br/>
