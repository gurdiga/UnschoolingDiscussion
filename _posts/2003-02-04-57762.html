You don&#39;t need your whole boob  hanging out in public for a baby to  nurse.<br/>
<br/>
If you lift up your shirt the shirt covers up the baby.  Or you can put a <br/>
blanket over.  If some of you shows, that&#39;s okay.  If ALL of you shows, <br/>
that&#39;s rude.<br/>

<br/>
Still I think people shouldn&#39;t pass judgements if they should catch a glimpse of a breast.  I mean our world is so full of half naked women ALL the time and that is rarely criticized.  So I don&#39;t think people are just offended at being immodest while breastfeeding.  I think it is discomfort with the idea of breastfeeding, especially older children, especially older male children.  Our society is just so &quot;ugh&quot; about this kind of stuff.  Drives me nuts.  And I disagree that if &quot;too much&quot; boob shows it is rude.  <br/>
<br/>
It kind of reminds me of the cigarette smoking debate.  Where does a person&#39;s right to smoke end with another&#39;s right to breath fresh air.  How is someone to say my child should not nurse in comfort just because someone else&#39;s &quot;stuff&quot; makes them uncomfortable by seeing him nurse.  <br/>
<br/>
I just wish I could feel more at ease in public about breastfeeding...but alas, our society has a long way to go.    <br/>

Have you tried maybe using a sling when you nurse? Your son&#39;s head wouldn&#39;t <br/>
be covered but the majority of you would be. Kind of makes getting situated <br/>
easier and more discreet. Also maybe trying to put like a cloth diaper <br/>
draped from your shoulder down like a tent. It wouldn&#39;t exactly be covering <br/>
his head but covering you. Just some thoughts.<br/>

I hope you&#39;re *not* saying that you equate nursing in public with smoking in<br/>
public, because the objection to smoking in public is not just someone<br/>

breastfeeding because I my &quot;ampleness&quot;  It was just very difficult for me to <br/>
manuever.  Really, lying down on my side was the easiest.... but thats not <br/>
very conducive to doing anything BUT nursing. Heck, if I tried to hoist those <br/>
puppies out in public.. I would probably have either gotten arrested or made <br/>
some good tips.. LOL.  I was always soooo envious of these little ladies <br/>
hauling thier babies around nursing them while walking or even sitting at a <br/>
table.. out in public.. where ever.. and they were so discreet and it was not <br/>
such a &quot;big production&#39;  lol no pun intended.   Thier babies covered thier <br/>
breasts.. my breasts covered my babies..  I had such a difficult time nursing <br/>
Landon and Anna, I didnt even try with Ethan and JP.. I figured.. I got 2 <br/>
little kids who(also) neede  me .. I cant just &quot;check out&quot; and get settled to <br/>
nurse every couple of hours for 20 minutes or so.  These big old boobies have <br/>
always had thier pros and cons.. LOL.. the breasffeeding challanges were <br/>
DEFINITELY a con.. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455567444">Hello all! New to group here. I have 3 kids,<br/>
ages2,4,and6. I was just lurking, but the<br/>
breastfeeding discussion cought my eye. I extended<br/>
nursed and tandem nursed all of my children. I am also<br/>
a large breasted woman. I did nurse my kids in public<br/>
and none of them liked being covered. I do not feel it<br/>
is rude to sit down on a bench in a grocery store or<br/>
wherever and nurse a child. It&#39;s not like your mooning<br/>
someone or flipping them off. even if your whole boob<br/>
is out, the baby&#39;s head covers it from view. Unless<br/>
someone is being really nosy, they won&#39;t see much<br/>
more.The only reason I feel it may be percieved as<br/>
rude is that it is no longer common in our culture.<br/>
When/if it becomes a mainsteam practice once again, I<br/>
doubt it will be considered rude. Bottle feeding in<br/>
public certainly isn&#39;t rude.People who find it<br/>
offensive have the power to turn their eyes somewhere<br/>
else.If you are feeling uncomfortable nursing an older<br/>
baby in public,that&#39;s a differrent story. If your<br/>
child is not nursing just for nutrion alone and is<br/>
older, you can always just tell them to wait,or that<br/>
you will nurse them in the car or at home. I hope this<br/>
helps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Neither of mine would ever have let me put a blanket over their head <br/>
while nursing either. While they were little, the sling worked great <br/>
for nursing. When bigger, I used nursing shirts or a t-shirt with a <br/>
button-up shirt over it and just did the best I could. After awhile, <br/>
you get used to it and most people don&#39;t ever guess that you&#39;re <br/>
nursing anyways. Then again, I nursed my 3.5 year old in a pizza <br/>
parlor today, I&#39;m not real, real concerned with what other people <br/>
think, I guess :-). Most of the 3 and 4, and even some of the 5 and 6 <br/>
year olds in our homeschool group are nursing, so it&#39;s pretty normal <br/>
to see bigger nursing kids anywhere we hang out. Of course, after <br/>
they&#39;re verbal, or even real verbal, it&#39;s a lot easier to get the <br/>
point across about keeping mommy&#39;s shirt down :-)<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, only one person has ever said *anything* to me about <br/>
nursing in public, and that was when my youngest was an infant, and I <br/>
was nursing her in a sling, *and* I had a nursing shirt on. <br/>
Absolutely no skin was showing at all, nothing. I think people&#39;s <br/>
problems with nursing are less about skin and more about their own <br/>
hang-ups. There&#39;s more boob skin showing on a cover of Cosmo than <br/>
I&#39;ve ever displayed in 6 years of nursing in public.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865216554">Mary,<br/>
<br/>
You made me giggle......<br/>
<br/>
Oh for me going from the top would be just as unsightly, I would REALLY look <br/>
exposed then...did I mention I am a 44DDD and that is non-pregnant, <br/>
non-nursing.  My bras prepregnant are snug now.  There really is no high or <br/>
low to boobs this big.  Honestly, my partner says my boobs make my son&#39;s head <br/>
look very small in comparison.  <br/>
<br/>
I have tried a diaper or receiving blanket from the shoulder-he still tugs at <br/>
it.  I find he is really too big (20 lbs and gosh knows how long but really <br/>
long-21 inches at birth)<br/>
 to nurse in a sling.  And to me it was akward even when he was smaller, <br/>
never could figure out how mom&#39;s nursed while baby was in the sling...maybe <br/>
again, it has to do with having such huge boobs.  He really doesn&#39;t lay in a <br/>
sling anymore...when he is in it he is upright, either on my hip or facing me <br/>
sleeping on my chest or facing out as I watch tv or work on the computer.  <br/>
But that is getting to be a challenge since now he wants to type with mommy.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have wanted to try another type of sling though because right now I am <br/>
using the NoJo which I love but it has no tail to help with nursing.  I am <br/>
afraid I won&#39;t like a sling without padding.  I guess with the next one I <br/>
might try a different sling...I just need to get rid of one or two of the 4 <br/>
NoJos I have in order to justify getting another sling.  <br/>
<br/>
But thanks for the tries and the laugh<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Gee now that I&#39;m thinking of it.......my breasts are so small, maybe no one <br/>
&gt; ever even knew I was breastfeeding!!!! I actually found it a lot easier for <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; me to go from the top. My boobs are so high, I showed much skin going from <br/>
&gt; the bottom up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have you tried maybe using a sling when you nurse? Your son&#39;s head wouldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; be covered but the majority of you would be. Kind of makes getting situated <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; easier and more discreet. Also maybe trying to put like a cloth diaper <br/>
&gt; draped from your shoulder down like a tent. It wouldn&#39;t exactly be covering <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; his head but covering you. Just some thoughts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-452959014">Welcome Christy, I&#39;m new as well...so we have something in common.  I guess <br/>
we are just destined to nursing at home and/or just struggling when it is <br/>
absolutely necessary to nurse in public.  As I sit and think about the last <br/>
time I had to nurse in public I recall how in an uproar I felt, so paniced <br/>
just from the stuggle to stay covered and get him fed.  Then glad the deed <br/>
was done and I could get dressed again...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am also very large breasted, and I pretty much avoided nursing in <br/>
&gt; public.  I never had any luck with the traditional cradle hold, and I <br/>
&gt; always nursed at home with the football position and lots of pillows <br/>
&gt; to help out.  It was just very difficult to get in a good position <br/>
&gt; discreetly.  I always wondered if other women had this same problem.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991670731">I nursed for ten years straight. In all indigenous societies it is totally acceptable (there are more of them and it is a very old tradition. Our society has too many hang ups. I have never felt out of place or uneasy about nursing anywhere, I think ppl like when you can keep a baby quiet. I have also never been insulted even as i nursed into their 3 yrs. There is a reason creator made our bodies and that is their primary purpose, it is the cycle of life. Later breasts are used as a stimulant to procreat therefore circle is complete. I must say I have always been descreet because its my parenting. I do not advertise but the above is my point of view. BTW.....the world average age to nurse is 4.2 yrs.<br/>

riding in the sling, I would just slide them a little<br/>
forward to be on my front and lower the sling so they<br/>
could nurse. You don&#39;t get to use the sling itself as<br/>
a cover though, but the child&#39;s head and body will<br/>
mostly block the view. I had aparenting concepts sling<br/>
originally for my first two kids, but for my third I<br/>
got a baby bundler. It&#39;s great!<br/>

<br/>
Artificial feeding is documented back to the Greeks.<br/>
There are American colonial cribs in museums with iron olders for artifical <br/>
feeding contraptions that used pigs&#39; nipples.<br/>
<br/>
There were pewter feeding cans in England and the U.S. both, in which &quot;pap&quot; <br/>
(milk and cereal) sat and wasn&#39;t even washed out.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a gravestone in the 17th century which bragged that a mother had <br/>
nursed her children herself.    England.  Where for a long time women had <br/>
wetnurses nurse their babies if they were of a certain rank and did NOT do it <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It was rejected for a long time, but like<br/>
disposable diapers, eventualy became mainstream due to media.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What media?  Artificial feeding with rubber nipples was &quot;scientific&quot; before <br/>
television or radio came along.<br/>
<br/>
I used to think it was a WWII and later thing myself, but when I started <br/>
reading about it I was appalled.<br/>
<br/>
Women&#39;s history isn&#39;t much discussed or dispersed.  And especially not when <br/>
it&#39;s shamefully embarrassing for the women.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Art from impressionists in Europe has subjects of<br/>

<br/>
There are tons of Renaissance paintings of Mary nursing Jesus, and in a few <br/>
of them it seems obvious the artist never actually saw a nursing baby.  Lots <br/>
are realistic, but a few are...  huh!?<br/>

My grandmother, who was born in 1909, told stories in which she was not<br/>
allowed to be seen while she was pregnant.  She remembers one time that<br/>
the local preacher came by unexpectedly and she was hurriedly sent into<br/>
the kitchen for fear she would be seen.  My mother was born in 1926,<br/>
that&#39;s not that long ago.  If a woman should be ashamed to be seen<br/>
pregnant, I can imagine that nursing in &quot;mixed company&quot; may have been<br/>
taboo also.  Nursing in the company of other women was probably very<br/>
natural, but my grandmother was in a very agricultural, rural society so<br/>
I feel sure the women were rarely in &quot;mixed company&quot;, except on Sunday.<br/>
