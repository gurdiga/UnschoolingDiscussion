<div id="ygrps-yiv-974602979"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve found that on this list you need to be especially clear what you are <br/>
&gt;&gt;talking about or who you are referring to in order to make your point <br/>
&gt;&gt;clear...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is true on any list, message board or discussion where you want <br/>
other people to understand what you are talking about. IRL or online.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;...and get the answers you are looking for.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You may *not* get the answers you are looking for no matter how clear you <br/>
are in your questions. The answers may be very different than what you were <br/>
originally looking for. They may come from a place that you never even <br/>
anticipated. It doesn&#39;t necessarily indicate lack of clarity. Sometimes it&#39;s <br/>
just a different perspective that requires thought and contemplation before <br/>
a response.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
~Mary, the contemplater<br/>

&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green <br/>
earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly alive.&quot;<br/>
