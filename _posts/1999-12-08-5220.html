&gt; performance is to punish the parents of those who skip school.<br/>
&gt; States across the nation are dusting off old truancy laws and<br/>

&gt;        missed more than a month of classes last year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    o   Ohio&#39;s Senate has passed a bill that would punish truants<br/>
&gt;        and their parents -- and Virginia now has a law that would<br/>
&gt;        punish parents with up to six months in jail and a fine of<br/>
&gt;        up to $1,000.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    o   Last December, several counties in Florida decided parents<br/>

&gt;        days in jail.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

    I find this disturbing, as the parent of several teenagers I know for a <br/>
fact that sometimes they just do what they want. Short of handcuffing <br/>
yourself to them there is little one can do. I think this is an abuse of <br/>
power.<br/>
