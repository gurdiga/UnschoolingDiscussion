&lt;&lt; . I was a terrible <br/>
<br/>
perfectionist - blamed it on my parents who did expect a lot from us <br/>
<br/>
(straight A&#39;s and all that). But now I see that my kids are often <br/>
<br/>
perfectionists, even though they don&#39;t have any of that pressure from <br/>
<br/>
parents or schools. So I&#39;ve come to believe that a lot of <br/>
<br/>
perfectionism is just personality. On the other hand, there&#39;s a lot <br/>
<br/>
of things that I didn&#39;t know as a perfectionist child that I&#39;ve <br/>
<br/>
learned along the way as an adult. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The first time I was going to speak at a conference (something local to me),  <br/>
I wanted a handout.  Other unschoolers helped me edit my rough outline up, <br/>
and though I thought I would only use it that weekend, it stuck.<br/>
<br/>
That was  in March, 1996, and I&#39;m still passing them out.  The text is below, <br/>
but a few weeks  ago someone wrote to me wanting to discuss a detail of it <br/>
and I&#39;d love to do that, but the e-mail fell out of the mailbox in the flood of <br/>
e-mail while I was out of town.<br/>
<br/>
The intent was to give new homeschoolers permission they didn&#39;t feel they <br/>
had.  Here&#39;s the text, and it&#39;s online at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://SandraDodd.com/empowerment">http://SandraDodd.com/empowerment</a><br/>
<br/>
CERTIFICATE OF EMPOWERMENT<br/>
<br/>
As bearer of this certificate you are no longer required to depend on the <br/>
advice of experts. You may step back and view the entire world-not just your <br/>
home, neighborhood or town, but the whole Earth-as a learning experience, a <br/>
laboratory containing languages (and native speakers thereof), plants, animals, <br/>
history, geology, weather (real live weather, in the sky, not in a book), music, <br/>
art , mathematics, physics, engineering, foods, human dynamics, and ideas <br/>
without end. Although collections of these treasures have been located in museums <br/>
for your convenience, they are to be found everywhere else, too. <br/>
<br/>
This authorizes you to experiment; to trust and enjoy your kids; to rejoice <br/>
when your children surpass you in skill, knowledge or wisdom; to make mistakes, <br/>
and to say &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Furthermore, you may allow your children to <br/>
experience boredom without taking full responsibility for finding them something to <br/>
do. <br/>
Henceforth you shall neither be required nor expected to finish everything <br/>
you start. Projects, books, experiments and plans may be discontinued as soon as <br/>
something more interesting comes along (or for any other reason) without <br/>
penalty, and picked up again at any time in the future (or never). <br/>
<br/>
You may reclaim control of your family&#39;s daily life, and take what steps you <br/>
feel necessary to protect your children from physical, emotional or social <br/>
harm. <br/>
<br/>
You have leave to think your own thoughts, and to encourage your children to <br/>
think theirs. <br/>
<br/>
Each person who reads and understands this is authorized to extend these <br/>
privileges to others, by reproducing and distributing this certificate or by <br/>
creating another of his/her own design. Those who don&#39;t feel the need to obtain <br/>
approval to experiment, to think, or to do things they&#39;ve never seen others do <br/>
are exempt, as they didn&#39;t need permission in the first place. <br/>
<br/>

------<br/>
<br/>
It has been published in homeschooling newsletters and borrowed and changed a <br/>
big on a couple of other websites.  Once, interestingly, all that was added <br/>
was &quot;and libraries&quot; after the &quot;in museums&quot; part and I found it really bothered <br/>
me.  Another time it was quite rewritten for a medical self-help/recovery site.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, even though I have hundreds printed for the upcoming conferences and <br/>
I can&#39;t change it at this point, I&#39;m willing to discuss that <br/>
question/criticism if the person&#39;s still around.<br/>
<br/>
AND, I was wondering if anyone saved a copy of the anti-version that was made <br/>
up by unschooling detractors years ago on AOL.<br/>

One question:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; You may reclaim control of your family&#39;s daily life, and take what steps you <br/>
&gt; feel necessary to protect your children from physical, emotional or social <br/>
&gt; harm. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you unpack this for me? How does that look to you as an unschooler? I&#39;ve been around <br/>
the highly restrictive school-at-home set and they use this same idea to justify all kinds of <br/>
limitations for their children (limiting TV, computer time, social events, who they are <br/>
friends with and so on). <br/>
<br/>
I know you aren&#39;t saying that here, but I&#39;d love you to take this further for the list once <br/>
again.<br/>
