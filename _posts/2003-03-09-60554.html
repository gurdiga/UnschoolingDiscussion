<div id="ygrps-yiv-259304102">If the &quot;1800 House&quot; and &quot;Frontier House&quot; just got you all revved up <br/>
to go off to yesteryear for a stint, while the rest of the world <br/>
watches your every bowel movement, then never fear because &quot;Colonial <br/>
House&quot; is here!  Check out all the details on recruitment for folks <br/>
to spend five months living like colonialists in breeches and <br/>
petticoats in New England: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/colonialhouse/">http://www.pbs.org/wnet/colonialhouse/</a> <br/>
<br/>
If you feel that this would appeal to you and your family and you <br/>
have always dreamed of living in Colonial Times, and you have <br/>
5-6 months to sacrifice to the producers of this show, then by all <br/>
means, tally ho!  I&#39;m not sure this would truly qualify as <br/>
unschooling, since the producers and their lawyers truly have control <br/>
over your lives during this stint.  But within the context of the <br/>
period one would have no schooling regulations to adhere to, for <br/>
sure.  And it is definitely hands-on experiential learning!  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, I would throw in a few notes of caution based on primary <br/>
personal experience. The site doesn&#39;t state who the producers of this <br/>
version will be, but in all likelihood it will be Simon Shaw, Beth <br/>
Hoppe and Mark Saben, or some combination of these three, the same <br/>
producers who have been involved in the other two PBS/WNET time <br/>
travel productions. If the total loss of privacy and the producers&#39; <br/>
tendency to twist situations around, often setting folks up for all <br/>
kinds of conflict (to boost ratings), doesn&#39;t deter you, then by all <br/>
means hurry up and apply. <br/>
<br/>
And please do not count on any stipends for your six months, no <br/>
matter what the web site says. For those who don&#39;t know our family <br/>
was the runner up family for &quot;Frontier House.&quot; Our photos are still <br/>
up on the web site. Just go to: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/frontierhouse/">http://www.pbs.org/wnet/frontierhouse/</a> <br/>
Once there click on &quot;The Project,&quot; then from the drop down menu, &quot;The <br/>
Search.&quot; Our family is in the middle of the page with the video <br/>
clip. What we learned from our experience was that these guys were <br/>
looking for folks who would not only not cost them any money at all, <br/>
but in some cases, like the family from Los Angeles who were featured <br/>
on the Frontier House series, those who would actually help them <br/>
underwrite their production with generous donations. So, if you have <br/>
five to six months to spare, can walk away from your job without any <br/>
hassles (they say they will help but they never offered to do so, <br/>
even when we asked; then were a little annoyed and utterly evasive <br/>
when we asked about the stipend they promised on the web site, <br/>
started mumbling about their high production costs, etc.). In other <br/>
words they did their best to make us feel that we should be honored <br/>
to be chosen and grateful to do it for nothing, even to donate funds <br/>
to help them.   But if you are willing to subject yourselves <br/>
to whatever they choose to set up for you, to be portrayed in the <br/>
worst possible situations, for ratings purposes, of course, then by <br/>
all means volunteer for this adventure. <br/>
<br/>
The deadline has been extended to March 31, 2003. You must fill out <br/>
the application on the PBS web site and they will phone you if you <br/>
are among the chosen few. We received many phone calls, with <br/>
producers talking to each family member individually, then visits, <br/>
videotaping us.  These phone calls and videotapes then went to <br/>
production teams and focus groups to determine who would be the final <br/>
three families.  But when we were less than enthusiastic about <br/>
signing a contract with a British production company, relinquishing <br/>
all rights to adjudicate anything in the United States, and giving <br/>
over rights to anything even remotely connected with this experience, <br/>
including our thoughts, our words, the lives of our family members, <br/>
without consulting an attorney first, well, let&#39;s just say <br/>
that we were no longer at the top of their list, were demoted to <br/>
runners up. <br/>
<br/>
They are really looking for whoever will be the easiest for them to <br/>
work with, those who will present no problems, either legally, <br/>
financially, or those who might be upset by what they ultimately do <br/>
to them via the finished production&#39;s portrayal of them. Otherwise <br/>
this is a great opportunity for the right persons, the right <br/>
families, to live the colonial reality for 5-6 months. Do check it <br/>
out if you are interested and if you can rearrange your life to suit <br/>
their needs. <br/>
<br/>
We are glad that we went through the selection process during which <br/>
time we studied and learned a great deal about the Frontier House <br/>
period. But we are even happier that we were not finalists after <br/>
watching the series. Many of the things that they ended up doing were <br/>
not things that they ever disclosed to us. Basically I felt that the <br/>
series lacked integrity when those who repeatedly violated the <br/>
agreements were kept on the set (probably because they had <br/>
contributed so much money to the production!). But if we had been in <br/>
a financial position to just pull up and walk away for the five <br/>
months of production, without threatening our futures, then we would <br/>
have happily done it. Basically I guess what I am saying is that <br/>
this sort of thing really is meant for rich folks, or folks who do <br/>
not have any obligations, like the young couple on Frontier House.<br/>
<br/>
The parallel Canadian production, &quot;Pioneer Quest: A Year in the Real <br/>
West,&quot; done by the CBC, booted the couple who broke the rules <br/>
immediately and brought in someone else. They also did give a <br/>
substantial cash payment at the end to each participant who survived <br/>
the year of living on the Canadian frontier, compensating them for <br/>
their sacrifices. The Canadians have also done two other series <br/>
including &quot;Klondike: The Quest For Gold.&quot; We feel they have handled <br/>
their productions with much more honesty and integrity. Oh, well. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s your chance to not only be in a reality series, but to learn <br/>
about and live in history! Why not? If you fit the bill and can <br/>
take off for a year, have family or someone who can pay your bills, <br/>
take care of your property for you, have a business or job you can <br/>
leave for up to six months without detrimental consequences, do not <br/>
have very young children (too dangerous), have no health concerns <br/>
that would interfere with a colonial way of living, then these kinds <br/>
of chances don&#39;t come along very often. And who better than home <br/>
educators to understand that 6 months away from &quot;school&quot; is no big <br/>
deal? <br/>
<br/>
Do check it out if you are interested.  We were all very enthusiastic <br/>
when we applied and went through the process for Frontier House.  But <br/>
we became less and less enthusiastic as we began to notice that we <br/>
were basically just props for the producers who were not being <br/>
entirely honest with us about lots of things regarding this <br/>
production.  But then, that&#39;s the theatre!  And make no mistake, this <br/>
is theatre, but you will have to live it as real life, every day for <br/>
five to six months.  I asked my husband if he wanted to apply again.  <br/>
He said, &quot;No dear, but feel free to do it without me, if that&#39;s what <br/>
you really want to do!&quot;  I asked my teenage daughter if she&#39;d  be <br/>
willing to do it and she said, &quot;Mom!&quot;  I think that pretty much sums <br/>
it up.<br/>
