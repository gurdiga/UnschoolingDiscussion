<div id="ygrps-yiv-688772861">-=-Please, please, please, yourself.<br/>
Wasn&#39;t the recommended procedure to ignore me if you get queazy?-=<br/>
<br/>
That was Ned to Zenmomma / Mary.<br/>
<br/>
Ned, <br/>
<br/>
Mary is one of the most popular contributors to www.unschooling.com.<br/>
There are people who go there and read BECAUSE Mary is there.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re treating her like an idiot, and you are very wrong to do so.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; In the last month here, I&#39;ve read about six hours about religions, about<br/>
three hours about Phonics games, at least two hours about Hell,etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You could ignore it if it makes you queasy.  But that wasn&#39;t aimed at you. It <br/>
wasn&#39;t destructive, and it wasn&#39;t insulting.<br/>
<br/>
This list exists for unschoolers to help other unschoolers.  Perhaps as you <br/>
are not currently unschooling you could find another outlet for your obvious <br/>
need to scare and disturb and insult people.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But mention something about how unschooling is<br/>
subject to stupid laws and ignorant politicians and judges who want to make<br/>
it illegal, and WHAP, the fertilizer hits the vent, collectivist<br/>
sensitivities are ruffled, the defenders of the status quo come out snarling<br/>
and demanding silence, go away, yadayada.  Where is the moderator when we<br/>
need one?!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s partly what you say, but it&#39;s mostly the way you say it, with total <br/>
disregard for the feelings of anyone, with EXTREME rudeness and drama, that <br/>
is irritating people, Ned.  You make fun of people for begging you to be <br/>
nicer.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;. This list is probably the vanguard of<br/>
homeschooling, the storm troops, the elite corps of homeschooling, the first<br/>
team (sorry about all the guy analogies)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, there are lots of unschooling outlets and forums.<br/>
Unschooling is the vanguard of homeschooling, I don&#39;t doubt.  But this list <br/>
isn&#39;t the only one by far.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Unschoolers are the people who have<br/>
tried curriculum-in-a-box and sent it back as useless and controlling, too<br/>
much like what we&#39;re trying to forget. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Many of us never did that.<br/>
<br/>
Because of lists like this (when  they are calm and more useful) and because <br/>
of bulletin boards online for the past twelve years, and newsgroups before <br/>
that, very many unschoolers come straight to unschooling, bypassing the <br/>
formal curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We&#39;re also NOT the people who care a<br/>
lot about hurting anyone&#39;s feelings (check Tia&#39;s tag line) or worrying<br/>
whether we&#39;re politically correct.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You misunderstand Tia&#39;s tagline.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;HOMESCHOOLING  IS  POLITICALLY  INCORRECT.<br/>
Are you not aware of that?  Is that news to anyone?<br/>
and...<br/>
UNSCHOOLING  IS  OFF  THE  CHARTS  INCORRECT,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You are yelling at the choir.<br/>
The tone is rude.<br/>
You&#39;re telling us what we already know.<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In fact, this list just might be where homeschooling should be planning its<br/>
national survival, or maybe its great surge to achieve total acceptance.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need total acceptance or national survival (AGAIN, for the many-eth <br/>
time, this is an international list).<br/>
<br/>
We need individual daily success and peace in homes.  Families need to learn <br/>
to relax into natural learning, not be scared that the county will show up to <br/>
take their kids away.  Unschooling will work for more people the more people <br/>
it works for.  By encouraging and aiding those who choose it, the surface of <br/>
the movement is larger, more people will have known a successful unschooling <br/>
family personally, there will be more tales to find easily, continually <br/>
mounting evidence and confidence, and gradually (because it can&#39;t be grabbed) <br/>
more acceptance.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;If people get nervous when we talk,<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, but this is not the place where we need to explain ourselves or<br/>
mince our words. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People get nervous when YOU talk.<br/>
We DO  need to explain ourselves here. You don&#39;t like to do it.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a political rally.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I want not to cajole<br/>
people, to inspire, to encourage if possible...not to give ideas for daily<br/>
plans, but life-changing insights. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers do both all the time.<br/>
YOU might not want to inspire and to encourage and help people with their <br/>
unschooling in this moment, but I really do and your ranting is not helping <br/>
what some of us have been doing for many years, and what some who come here <br/>
THIS WEEK will be doing for many years after some of us have grown children <br/>
and are no longer in the front lines of inspiring and encouraging.  That cast <br/>
changes.  But Mary/Zenmomma and Pam/Psoroosh are valuable in ways you are <br/>
not, Ned, and if you have any vestige of respect for those who ARE doing <br/>
valuable work, back off of them and let them do their work without being <br/>
shamed by you in public.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I mostly respond to other people&#39;s posts in the best, most helpful way I<br/>
can, and I&#39;ll admit that most of what I believe will offend some group or<br/>
other, but I won&#39;t apologize, and I need a good reason to go away,<br/>
especially when the listmembers who have expressed interest in what I say<br/>
also seem to be the best-informed and most clear-headed.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Make a new list and invite people here to it.  See how many you get.  You <br/>
might get lots!  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve just stated that those who oppose your tone or who express lack of <br/>
interest in what you are expressing are not the best informed and not the <br/>
most clear headed people here.  That is a broad and deep insult.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Hurray for unschooling. It is leading the way, but it takes courage.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You doubt my courage Ned?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Courage. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You think that those who don&#39;t want to hear you rant about libertarian <br/>
sky-falling are lacking in courage?  That they&#39;re just not very smart?<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can learn some tact and compassion.  It&#39;s not too late.<br/>
