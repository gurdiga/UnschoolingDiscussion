or unsubscribe people as part of managing the list. But, what a pain in the <br/>
neck for either of them to have to do.  I mean, they have lives, too!  It&#39;s <br/>
something that we folks can do ourselves much more easily, and, as Tia <br/>
rightly pointed out, folks seem to be able to get themselves <br/>
subscribed!  It sure ain&#39;t all that hard to unsubscribe!<br/>
<br/>
Just a-shakin&#39; my head!<br/>
