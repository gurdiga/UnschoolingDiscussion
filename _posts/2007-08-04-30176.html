<div id="ygrps-yiv-476599948">A few days ago, in response to my message about the convergence of <br/>
evil influences on my happy unschooling state, Sandra recommended <br/>
that I write a few posts about how great our unschooling is going, <br/>
and then edit and send them as letters to family.<br/>
<br/>
I was reminded of the blog that I have had going for a few years, <br/>
which I started with the combined purpose of being a possible record <br/>
(if ever needed) for state purposes, and also to possibly share with <br/>
family.  I&#39;ve found that it is more fun for me to use it as a <br/>
chronicle of our life and key moments in the kids lives, vs. being <br/>
really academically focused about it.<br/>
<br/>
I do get a batch in every few months or so, and as I went back and <br/>
read, this one had me giggling, so I thought I would share.  What it <br/>
also demonstrates for me, is the power of learning something in a <br/>
minute of real conversation (non-intentional conversation, to boot), <br/>
that the schools spend years trying to teach.  If it&#39;s real and <br/>
relevant, they will learn it in a flash.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope it doesn&#39;t gross anyone out, she is really sweet, but does <br/>
have this habit, which we never tried to stop, and I&#39;m guessing that <br/>
she may outgrow over time.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;12 Percent of Boogies<br/>
<br/>
Math pops its beautiful little head through the window in unique ways <br/>
at our house.<br/>
<br/>
One day recently I was nursing Truman in bed and Amelia was lying <br/>
next to me on the other side and we were just chatting.<br/>
<br/>
We were talking about boogies, and how many of them she eats, and she <br/>
out of the blue said that she ate 12 percent of her boogies. Then she <br/>
asked me what that meant. <br/>
<br/>
I explained to her that if she had a hundred boogies, then she would <br/>
eat 12 of them, to which she replied, &quot;oh, then I eat 100 percent of <br/>
my boogies.&quot; That is the right answer, as she does consume about 100% <br/>
of her boogies at this stage in her little life.<br/>
<br/>
Percentages, check.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping me out of the vortex.  I feel more confident now, <br/>
and motivated to capture and share more through the blog. <br/>

That was sweet. &lt;g&gt;  And I know it was about math, and not boogers.<br/>
But...<br/>
<br/>
Marty used to do that when he was little, eat boogers.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted him to stop but I didn&#39;t want to shame him, but I really  <br/>
wanted him to stop doing it in front of people.  He wasn&#39;t really  <br/>
very aware he was doing it anyway.  So what I did (and I&#39;m not saying  <br/>
it was the ideal, but it seemed to help) was a few times I just  <br/>
casually said something like &quot;I wonder if monkey boogers taste like  <br/>
people boogers.&quot;  And we had a friend who worked at the zoo.  He  <br/>
worked with birds, and I don&#39;t know of bird boogers, but still...   <br/>
I&#39;d say &quot;Y&#39;think Bill could get an elephant booger for you to try?&quot;  <br/>
or something like that, just in a tone of voice like it made all the  <br/>
sense in the world and could be fun.<br/>
<br/>
So for Marty to envision eating someone else&#39;s booger (or something  <br/>
else&#39;s booger) and being a little grossed out, it helped him notice  <br/>
when he was doing it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been fifteen years since Marty ate boogers as far as I know. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
