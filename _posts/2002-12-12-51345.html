<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741429191">I would like some help, please:) I am still working on immediate family<br/>
members that believe school &quot;should look like school.&quot; They including my<br/>
older teen and 21 year old who are no longer in school, think I should<br/>
sit my two young sons down for atleast 2 hours a day and have them<br/>
write. They write when they play games, think up stories that interest<br/>
them, make lists, etc. I feel fear because of this and the fact that in<br/>
my state a portfolio is expected at the end of the &quot;school&quot; year. I<br/>
don&#39;t know if I need to hand in actual test papers, written book<br/>
reports, etc. - things that the boys wrote. Can I write down everything<br/>
I see them doing - which is what I have been doing - to hand in as a<br/>
portfolio? My 14 year old was so traumatized by school that I have<br/>
noticed each and everytime I do conventional schooling to please others,<br/>
he acts out his pain and anger. He believes he is stupid because he has<br/>
dyslexia. I talked to family about this again. I think I cleared the<br/>
air, so to speak about the situation. I guess the bottom line is my fear<br/>
about either going to jail because I am doing this incorrectly. I would<br/>
really appreciate your support and guidance around this. Thanks:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-456395234">Hi Michele,<br/>
 <br/>
in regards to your two oldest, have you read The Teenage Liberation Handbook?     It would really apply to them and maybe help.       It would be even cooler if they would read it, &lt;g&gt;  but I don&#39;t know them and don&#39;t know if this would happen or not.    I know my son won&#39;t read a whole lot that I recommend,  too much pushing a few years ago,  we are still deschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
Regarding your reporting stuff ,   have you contacted other homeschoolers/unschoolers in your state?    They will know what is really needed and will probably know what a portfolio can look like.<br/>
 <br/>
I just keep telling my family that has concerns,   &quot;I  can&#39;t believe how much we are learning,    its amazing how much an individual learns in their everyday life!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Keep having fun with your kids!  And I hope this helps<br/>
 <br/>
Kelli<br/>
