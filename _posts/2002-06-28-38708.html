&gt; Too bad!  We are not into violence that is physical. We don&#39;t like verbal <br/>

&gt; Just a few thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are people with really good intentions who want to be kind and gentle <br/>
parents and don&#39;t want any violence or meanness in their homes, but who don&#39;t <br/>
have many quick &quot;ideas&quot; of how to respond when kids behavior is problematic <br/>
so they do nothing, rather than fall back on what a friend of mine calls <br/>
&quot;cultural parenting techniques&quot; (he means hitting, yelling, and shaming).<br/>
<br/>
But, for unschoolers, that is usually because they lack the ability, <br/>
themselves, to know &quot;what else&quot; to do when they reject those cultural <br/>
techniques -- it isn&#39;t because they want hitting and other violent behavior <br/>
in their homes.<br/>
<br/>
I agree, though, that there is a certain percentage of unschooling kids who <br/>
seem to need more &quot;parenting&quot; -- not more punishing - but more help in some <br/>
way the parents aren&#39;t giving it. Heck, I&#39;m sure people have thought that <br/>
about my kids off and on, over the years, as they&#39;ve gone through various <br/>
stages. I mean - most of us are figuring this out as we go along and I&#39;ve <br/>
sometimes felt a step or two behind --figuring it out, finally, AFTER we&#39;ve <br/>
suffered through some weeks or months of not knowing how to respond to some <br/>
sort of behavior issue.<br/>
<br/>
And temperament matters. It is easy to &quot;blame&quot; parenting techniques when you <br/>
see an intense and apparently out-of-control kid - but maybe that kid is SO <br/>
much calmer and happier than he/she&#39;d be without whatever the parent IS <br/>
doing. <br/>
