<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119006737">We have GTA 1 on our PC it hasn&#39;t been played for months and months. My 5 yr <br/>
old used to like playing it she didn&#39;t do the missions (she couldn&#39;t read <br/>
them) she used to like driving the cars and running people over. I think she <br/>
liked the splats. The splats are more or less the same as you get on Frogger <br/>
but we don&#39;t have frogger it&#39;s just how I remember it.<br/>
<br/>
Thing is I hate GTA it makes me cringe if I accidentaly run someone over <br/>
onit,but she doesn&#39;t see them as &#39;real people because they&#39;re not. It&#39;s <br/>
obvious they&#39;re not people.<br/>
<br/>
She plays roller coaster Tycoon and she plays that, not by building rides <br/>
but by coralling the people and keeping them hanging in the air. It&#39;s the <br/>
way she plays. She wouldn&#39;t run anyone over or coral people in real life <br/>
because she is playing an imaginative game not real life.<br/>
<br/>
Traditional fairy stories used to be much more gory than they are now. They <br/>
continue to get more and more &#39;prettied&#39; up. In the original Snow White&#39;s <br/>
wicked Stepmother was made to dance in white hot iron shoes. Also in <br/>
Cinderella the ugly sisters had their eyes plucked out by Ravens in the end.<br/>
<br/>
For every murder now there were 10 in the medieval period. I really don&#39;t <br/>
believe in the &#39;good old days&#39; when children were innocent  blah blah. My <br/>
grandad was expected to go out to work full time at age 14. Most kids looked <br/>
after their siblings and worked even when at school. How many boy soldiers <br/>
lost their lives in the civil war (USA)?<br/>
<br/>
There was no time when everything was rosy, it was much worse and anything <br/>
nasty was swept under the carpet. In Victorian England the child prostitutes <br/>
were blamed for prostitution and the tempting of young men.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea why the big deal about GTA, its a GAME! If games made you <br/>
violent then we&#39;d all be out hacking each other to peices for cripes sake. <br/>
Any child who genuinely gets obsessed with real violence would get obsessed <br/>
with other types of stuff if the games weren&#39;t available, maybe WW2 natzis <br/>
or commandos or cowboys or exercet missiles or saddam hussien or criminals <br/>
in the news or spys or assassins of US presidents or Tom and Jerry or <br/>
ANYTHING. Games don&#39;t cause mental illness or violent behaviour PEOPLE do.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t talk to your child, if they are too afraid to talk to you, if <br/>
they feel you won&#39;t listen, if they know you&#39;ll shout at them and punish <br/>
them if they do talk to you, if they feel you will take something away from <br/>
them if they talk to you, then you will never know if there&#39;s anything <br/>
seriously wrong with your child until the day when it&#39;s obvious that there <br/>
is and it&#39;s too late and you are left bewildered and looking around for <br/>
something to blame like Games or TV. It&#39;s all too sad.<br/>

I don&#39;t think people do either, on the mental illness.  Though it&#39;s certainly <br/>
possible to make it way worse if it&#39;s there.   And some people are <br/>
genetically more violent, and that too is something nurture can affect, and <br/>
philosophy and self esteem can affect.<br/>
<br/>
But YES about &quot;the old days&quot; being violent and cruel.  <br/>
And YES about games and fairy tales having purposes which don&#39;t include <br/>
people wanting to cause other people to dance in hot iron shoes or be eaten <br/>
by wolves or run over by real cars.<br/>

<br/>
The child of a family we know was quoted back to me by his mother as having <br/>
said &quot;Sandra really listens to kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have hardly even had a conversation with the kid at all, because he&#39;s very <br/>
quiet here. <br/>
<br/>
Holly had a cassette tape she had made of a &quot;radio talk show&quot; a bunch of kids <br/>
had made for fun.  She was interviewing people and interviewing stuffed <br/>
animals, and one of the kids was FUNNY, that was my favorite voice, and I <br/>
said &quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot;  and she said &quot;Vincent.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised.  I had never heard him sound so confident an animated.<br/>
<br/>
So among kids he has a voice.   With adults, it has been shushed.  And he <br/>
thought it worthy of comment that I listen to kids.<br/>
<br/>
That means at home he is not being listened to.  I talked to his mom that, <br/>
and we&#39;ve talked much since about his dad.  Very sad, that children are <br/>
treated VERY much like &quot;just children&quot; by him.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine one of my kids saying to another adult, or OF another adult, <br/>
&quot;You really listen to me&quot; or &quot;...to kids,&quot; because the comments they make <br/>
here express amazement about the times they&#39;ve interacted with adults who did <br/>
NOT listen to kids as real people.  It surprises them.  I&#39;m glad.  Their <br/>
&quot;default setting&quot; on listening is yes, you listen to people and you don&#39;t <br/>
disregard someone for being young.<br/>
<br/>
So when people come to homeschooling discussions and say &quot;I&#39;ll make the <br/>
decisions for my children until they&#39;re old enough to think,&quot; I wonder when <br/>
they think (and WHY they think) that child will start thinking at some point, <br/>
if he&#39;s been discouraged from thinking EVER.<br/>
<br/>
But there are whole strata of homeschooling in which thinking is not for kids <br/>
to do.  (And the parents seem not to do a whole lot of it either, so maybe <br/>
there&#39;s a genetic component there also.)<br/>

way I was raised....&quot; Children should be seen but not heard&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
From personal experience I can tell you that that attitude creates children <br/>
who have no self-worth, no self-esteem and no sense of who they are and what <br/>
they think/believe.  I was an adult before I realized it was ok to have an <br/>
opinion.  Now I have lots of them :)<br/>

my son and discount his feelings and make him seem he&#39;s &quot;less&quot; because he&#39;s <br/>
young and not listen to him.  And he gets so MAD!  He only lets me do it <br/>
once, and he points it out immediately, strongly and with tears and ranting.  <br/>
And he&#39;s always exactly right.  <br/>
<br/>
So the fact that he can go from zero to 60 like that must mean that he&#39;s used <br/>
to being listened to, and how disrespectful it is NOT to be listened to <br/>
because of your age.  And how much his siblings must have repressed that <br/>
response because they were treated like that from an early age.  Even though <br/>
I stopped treating them that way in the preteen years, they have scars.<br/>

Parenting is hard.<br/>

which is VERY often, they usually smile and engage in conversation. Yeah, <br/>
there may be some shy ones, but they dont just stare blankly, they might grin <br/>
and hide behind Mommy.  Maybe its a &quot;regional&quot; difference or something.  Most <br/>
folks and thier kids around here are pretty friendly and willing to talk if <br/>
someone offers to strike up a conversation.  ( which, I usually do.. hehe)<br/>

I know I&#39;m not fitting in very well in the place where we live right now,  neighborhood, I think maybe the kids are ordered around too much,    alot of these people are wrapped up in appearances and such.<br/>
 <br/>
Can&#39;t have their kids looking unkept or anything ya know...   pretty snobby.   <br/>
 <br/>
I do have closer friends whose kids  will talk,  but only a couple,<br/>
 <br/>
I have been told by some adults that they enjoy our kids alot because they see a spark in their eyes,   I don&#39;t quite know why there aren&#39;t more around.   Have all their spirits been  sqwashed?(sp)  broken?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I gotta say.. I&#39;ve  not seen very much of that..  When I speak to children, <br/>
which is VERY often, they usually smile and engage in conversation. Yeah, <br/>
there may be some shy ones, but they dont just stare blankly, they might grin <br/>
and hide behind Mommy.  Maybe its a &quot;regional&quot; difference or something.  Most <br/>
folks and thier kids around here are pretty friendly and willing to talk if <br/>
someone offers to strike up a conversation.  ( which, I usually do.. hehe)<br/>

&lt;&lt;   Guess what, any 7 year old who has teen siblings is going to have a more <br/>
&quot;sophisticated&quot; vocabulary than others.  (So what!)  They need to learn what <br/>
is and isn&#39;t appropriate yes, but they *will* learn it in time.  Why does <br/>
every mistake a child makes have to imply some horrible home environment, bad <br/>
parents, or some kind of immoral character defect!   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, for sure.<br/>
Today, on the way home from our homeschool &quot;resource day&quot;, Trevor was <br/>
describing how they were acting out with the chess pieces.<br/>
He and a 15 y.o. were making up stories about the chess pieces and acting <br/>
them out...they had Lesbian queens, Kings having affairs with other pieces <br/>
etc....<br/>
It was all centered around sexuality.<br/>
As he&#39;s describing the scene I&#39;m sitting there amazed that he&#39;d share all of <br/>
it with me. Most kids would bend over backwards to hide stuff like that from <br/>
their parents.<br/>
But I remember acting out sex with Barbies and other exploratory <br/>
drama....it&#39;s fascinating, and normal.<br/>
So although it still surprises me, just what these children will share in a  <br/>
trusting, free environment, I am so thankful they do include me in their <br/>
machinations and don&#39;t fear I will get upset by sexual or other intimate talk.<br/>

OH!! I positively LOVE that game. I had no interest in learning to play video <br/>

looked so fun, and it IS.<br/>
The funniest thing, is that Jared can beat absolutely anyone, which irritates <br/>
the heck out of Trevor who is usually video game king around here.<br/>

           yeah I know it&#39;s more complicated than that. I just ran off at <br/>

the kids will begin to  trust  adults.( at least one, you).  Have you ever <br/>
asked thier parents why think thier kids are so &quot;shy&quot; around adults?  May be <br/>
a good way to open a doorway into discussing some issues that the parents <br/>
have never considered.. Who knows. maybe the parents are concerned about it <br/>
too.. Or, maybe they dont even see and realize it.. Or, heck, maybe they <br/>
encourage and perpetuate it.. You&#39;ll just keep guessing til you ask them.. <br/>

said he didn&#39;t feel like talking to that guy and I told him he didn&#39;t have <br/>
