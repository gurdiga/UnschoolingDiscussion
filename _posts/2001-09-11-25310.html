<div id="ygrps-yiv-323197632">Daron- What you did sounds pretty much what we do. Just yesterday we met with <br/>
our Educational Specialist. <br/>
<br/>
P.E. consisted of my children playing almost daily on their scooters and from <br/>
time to time playing tag and hide-n-seek with the neighborhood kids. <br/>
<br/>
Reading was mostly me reading books to them, this month it&#39;s been American <br/>
Girls Meet Samantha and Journey to the Center of the Earth. <br/>
<br/>
Math is the kids helping us balance the checkbook, them calculating their <br/>
allowance and the interest they have earned in the bank, along with helping <br/>
me keep track of how much money we spend at the grocery store and playing <br/>
games like monopoly. <br/>
<br/>
History has mostly stemed from our reading the American Girls, however my son <br/>
has had a facination with the Civil War since last year. <br/>
<br/>
Science is usually our gardening. We planted a pumkin patch, zucchini plant, <br/>
tomato plants, garlic, and green onions alogn with our flowers. Science has <br/>
also been catching and observing bugs. <br/>
<br/>
Political process we don&#39;t get much of, but every once in a while the kids <br/>
ask questions about the president, govoner, voting, etc. Most of our <br/>
political process comes from our visits to city hall. The kids love going <br/>
there, they get all kinds of flyers and pamphlets given to them. <br/>
<br/>
Writing often is notes, cards, letters to friends. I just make a quick <br/>
photocopy. Now that we have a printer the kids love me printing out those <br/>
online worksheets. We keep a pile of these around, and whenever the kids want <br/>
they pick one up and usually end up just coloring them, but they pretty much <br/>
always write their names at the top and will sometimes do a few of the <br/>
problems. I really don&#39;t care if they do them or not, they think their fun <br/>
and it&#39;s a sample for the school. <br/>
<br/>
The kids play TONS of computer games. They love the Jumpstart games, and <br/>
those have a &quot;progress report&quot; that you can print out. This is another <br/>
sample. The kids love playing their Wishbone game (The amazing odessy), and <br/>
lately we&#39;ve been creating a play using the American Girls Premiere cdrom <br/>
which when we&#39;re done we can print out a screne play.<br/>
<br/>
So, my kids generally cover all learning areas to some extent every month. <br/>
Even if it&#39;s just one question about the subject, it&#39;s learning and I notate <br/>
it. I just sit down each evening and I fill in a sheet that the teacher has <br/>
for us. It just lists the 7 learning areas and I just add on anything we did <br/>
that day that wasn&#39;t already listed as something we had done that month. End <br/>
of the month we hadn this sheet to the teacher and as we go around doing <br/>
things I just keep an eye on things I can use as samples for when portfolios <br/>
are due. <br/>
<br/>
Last year when we went to a Civil War renactment we snapped tons of pics, we <br/>
photocopied a couple and gave them to the school as a sample for history. I <br/>
had photographs of the kids playing monopoly, playing with magnets, building <br/>
things with legos and with our marble run, working in the garden. I had tape <br/>
conversations of my son talking to the bank manager about his bank account. <br/>
<br/>
Our Educational Specialist is very open to unschooling. She tells me often <br/>
that we cover more subject and the kids retain more then her other families. <br/>
I really don&#39;t know what to think about this as it&#39;s not me leading any of <br/>
this. My kids are naturally very curious. They love telling her about their <br/>
recent projects when she comes. They do this to anybody who visits. They are <br/>
rightfully proud of their &quot;work&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry your charter changed the way they did things. Were you with One2One?<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean about the money. The kids choose a few things they want. <br/>
This year Annea wants to take ballet lessons, so we&#39;re seeing about that <br/>
being done through the charter. Our educational specialist worked with one of <br/>
our well known professional ballet schools. Stephen wants to learn to play <br/>
violin and he wants to get involved in theater. I have told both our <br/>
educational specialist and my fiance that if the charter ever demands work <br/>
assignments from us like One2One started doing to my friend we&#39;re outta <br/>
there. For now we&#39;re able to unschool while having the protection we need <br/>
from our very troublesome neighbors.<br/>
