<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007271192">I wanted to share some cool connections that Logan (5 years old) and I discovered.<br/>
<br/>
Logan has been interested in insects for the last few weeks.  We&#39;ve watched lots of videos about insects, looked at pictures in books and on the internet, dug in our garden in search of cool insects.  He&#39;s also been interested in what words mean and where they come from.<br/>
<br/>
Late last night, when lots of connections seem to be made around here, Logan asked me where the word &quot;ladybug&quot; came from.  Wikipedia:  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***The name &quot;ladybird&quot; originated in Britain where the insects became known as &quot;Our Lady&#39;s bird&quot; or the &quot;Lady beetle&quot;. Mary (Our Lady) was often depicted wearing a red cloak in early paintings and the spots of the seven spot ladybird (the most common in Europe) were said to symbolise her seven joys and seven sorrows. In the United States the name was adapted to &quot;ladybug&quot;.***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So from insects we went to talking about Mary and Jesus (who he&#39;s heard referred to on the BBC &quot;Life&quot; series with the Jesus Christ Lizard) and why Mary had some happy things (seven joys) and sad things (seven sorrows) happen during her life.  He seemed satisfied with the few minutes of conversation we had and was wanting to play a game on the computer.  I was amazed at how many connections there were!<br/>

<br/>
There are traditional songs, usually the joys and not the sorrows.    <br/>
Sometimes &quot;The Joys of Mary&quot; and sometimes &quot;The Blessings of Mary.&quot;  I  <br/>
know a couple of tunes, but haven&#39;t sung one all the way through for  <br/>
years!  They&#39;re processional-type songs, used not in church, but  <br/>
outside of church maybe, or on festival days in England a few  <br/>
centuries ago.  One main singer and lots of singalong opportunity on  <br/>
the parts that repeat.<br/>
<br/>
The first one that&#39;s coming to mind, the lyrics of the first verse are<br/>
The first good joy that Mary had, she had the joy of one<br/>
To think that her son Jesus Christ was God&#39;s eternal son<br/>
Was God&#39;s eternal son, good man, and blessed may he be<br/>
Oh Father, Son and Holy Ghost, through all eternity.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a really happy tune.<br/>
<br/>
I know a more minor one, still fast, but not as happy.<br/>
<br/>
Today I caught a connection between a flying witch and something that  <br/>
hangs in the airport in Albuquerque:<br/>
