<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816618902">&lt;&lt;There are 42 boys and 24 girls in a chess club.  How many percent more<br/>
boys than girls are there?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, 64% of the kids are boys and 36% of them are girls, so there&#39;s 28%<br/>
more boys.<br/>
<br/>
Wait: If you&#39;re comparing the two populations, then there are 75% more boys<br/>
than girls.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you have to agree on the definition of &quot;boy&quot; and &quot;girl&quot; in our<br/>
society...<br/>
<br/>
The question was worded badly. Because 75% is such a nice round number, and<br/>
because it&#39;s a harder concept, and because that&#39;s how I see it used in<br/>
print, I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s the answer they wanted. I.e., if there had been<br/>
48 boys, there would have been 100% more boys than girls.<br/>
<br/>
(But wait: there are only 57% as many girls as boys, so maybe the answer is<br/>
43% more boys... :-p)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-860732075">I&#39;m feeling stuck here and looking for some help...<br/>
<br/>
I should start by saying that I&#39;m one of those people who really loves math. I read Marvin Gardner for fun, my favorite &quot;job&quot; is teaching math prep for the GRE and GMAT, and when I can&#39;t sleep at night I often play with numbers in my head. Perhaps this is the problem, really.<br/>
<br/>
When Rain was little, we had great fun with lots of mathy stuff. We played lots of games, and she had a srorng understanding of lots of mathematical concepts because of that. We used to go to the Lawrence Hall of Science and play their math games for hours... Hex, Nym, Ice Cream combos, all that. At 6 or 7 she found the binary number machine and spent 45 minutes working out how to write all sorts of numbers in Base 2.<br/>
<br/>
She didn&#39;t do a lot of arithmetic. She did love to add things in her head, and could add fairly big numbers when she was fairly tiny. When she was 7 or 8 she wanted to learn how I added bigger numbers (with regrouping), and after that she spent 6 months doing this anywhere she went, with trillions and billions and so on.<br/>
<br/>
She never went much beyond this, and now she&#39;s 12. Which would be fine, really, except that 6 months ago or so she decided that she wanted to get &quot;caught up&quot; and probably take some classes at the community college, and/or go to school. So, we had some Key to math booklets that we bought a year and a half ago, when she was in a show and all the other kids were doing homework, and she wanted some homework too. I&#39;ve offered to look for other things, or try other ideas, but she says she likes these.  She set up a schedule for herself to &quot;do math&quot; (meaning work in the booklets), and asked if I&#39;d be available to help her during these times.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been pretty much a disaster, for 3 months or so. The first issue was when I tried to explain what division meant, when she asked. I drew pictures and circled groups, I got her multiplication chart out and tried to explain how the process was reversed in division, I tried to get objects but she very vocally objected. She objects to pretty much any way I try to explain anything, and she really doesn&#39;t like it when I draw things out. &quot;Just tell me!&quot; she says, but when I tell her she says she doesn&#39;t understand, and when I ask what part she doesn&#39;t understand she says, &quot;Everything!&quot; It was like she thought there was some piece I was keeping from her, some important bit of information, and she was so angry about it.<br/>
<br/>
I did talk with another unschooling mom about it all, at the time, and came to the conclusion that maybe the problem was that she was so comfortable with addition, and more comfortable with multiplication and subtraction (although she doesn&#39;t have those &quot;facts&quot; memorized, as I think she does with addition), and when she couldn&#39;t mentally conceptualize the division problems like she does with the others, she thought there must be something wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I should mention that she figured out on her own how to do multiplication problems with multi-digit numbers, with her chart for reference for the facts. She doesn&#39;t use the standard algorithm, but it works fine.<br/>
<br/>
We got past division, somehow, but she&#39;s been working her way through Key to Fractions and it&#39;s still fairly miserable. She&#39;s finding equivalent fractions, and seems to understand it, but when she asked me to check it over she&#39;d made lots of mistakes. I tried to explain what she was doing wrong and she didn&#39;t want to hear it again, she was totally focused on what she should do to get the right answer, and angry because she said I&#39;d explained it wrong. I was explaining how the book did, I thought, but who knows. She won&#39;t generally let me say as much as I want, or draw diagrams, which is how I feel most comfortable explaining. <br/>
<br/>
So, she says she hates math. I&#39;m frustrated, she&#39;s frustrated. She doesn&#39;t want to give up on this &quot;catching up&quot; in math idea. She doesn&#39;t want to try a different book or method, so she says. She wants me to be a better resource, but I don&#39;t know how. She&#39;s also going to visit a school tomorrow - a cool private school, but a school - and she says the math teacher there was really nice (we went to open house).  Maybe she needs a different person to help her with math? I wish I knew of someone... wish we were still in the Davis-area, I guess. <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>

The way I understood division as a kid was to think of a quantity of things <br/>
or an amount of money divided by a number of people.  Twelve things, six kids; <br/>
Twelve things, two kids, etc.   Thinking in terms of money always helped me.  <br/>
I would think of 100 as a dollar, and suddenly I could visualize percentages <br/>
and also easy combinations by 25 or 10 or 5.  It was like a sensible <br/>
map/overlay over what seemed to be to be waste-of-time abstractions (math &quot;problems&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She wants me to be a better resource, but I don&#39;t know how. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe she needs a different person to help her with math?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe so. <br/>
Maybe a video (check interlibrary loan?), Standard Deviants or something?<br/>
Maybe she needs a different person or a funny book or brainstorming with you <br/>
or others, or poking around the internet, or all of the above.<br/>
Maybe she&#39;s honestly not ready. <br/>
Maybe there are other things going on in her body or mind that are creating <br/>
the frustration and the emotional swelling is just coming to  head in the math <br/>
area, but that&#39;s not (maybe) really the problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844142766">That sounds right. I really think her whole problem with division was that it wasn&#39;t effortless, so therefore she thought she couldn&#39;t be understanding how it worked. You&#39;re right, she&#39;s never really sat down and made this kind of effort before... she waited, and things came easily. I don&#39;t know if this stuff will eventually do that or not, but I&#39;ve suggested waiting and she&#39;s not in favor of the idea (and says I&#39;m not being supportive).<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas for resources? I have Harold Jacobs&#39; first book, which I also love, but I&#39;m beginning to think that the things I love may not be the right things. Our only other dabbling in math curricula was Miquon, while I also loved but Rain wasn&#39;t into... but perhaps that was a matter of timing. Of course, I sold it all on ebay.<br/>
<br/>
She liked Key to because it was small, unintimidating, and wordy. Words are her friends. <br/>

My kids have always enjoyed these games. If Rain has the urge to sort <br/>

Here below is a review of Frank Smith&#39;s book posted to show another point of view.<br/>
<br/>
Math can be upsetting when we just dont get it.  However, it is truly a wonderful thing when that light bulb does go off and our child has that &quot;ah ha&quot; I have got it look.  Be patient with your children and dont give up on them.  Dont give them watered down versions of anything...dive in.  Get her hands around some blocks, geo strips, geo boards, graph paper.  <br/>

---------------------------------<br/>
The Glass Wall:<br/>
Why Mathematics Can Seem Difficult <br/>
by Frank Smith Reviewed by P. N. Ruane <br/>
---------------------------------<br/>
The declared intention of this book is to offer insights to those who wish to learn mathematics, or to teach it. It is based upon the premise that there exists something referred to as a &#39;glass wall&#39;, which is said to be an ongoing impediment to mathematical understanding. <br/>
On reading the book, one soon realises that by the word mathematics the author really means basic arithmetic, although there is some mention of geometrical ideas. This is compatible with his statement in the introduction that the text is intended to include teachers involved with primary education. However, primary mathematics, in many countries, includes many more themes than arithmetic (algebra, probability, shape and space, problem-solving skills etc). Nonetheless, Frank Smith uses his comments about children&#39;s difficulties with basic number work to form various generalisations about the learning of mathematics as a whole. <br/>
My chief reservations about this book fall into three categories, as follows: <br/>
<br/>
   I still don&#39;t know what is meant by a &#39;glass wall&#39;, since the concept is never properly defined. Why not use alternative metaphors such as &#39;brick wall&#39; or &#39;dense fog&#39;? Glass walls are transparent and one can gain much understanding of the outside world by gazing through the windows of a train or those of one&#39;s own home. To my mind, it isn&#39;t clear whether the author believes that this entity arises from inappropriate teaching or whether it is due to the inherent nature of mathematics itself. To what degree is it due to both of these factors? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   In the teaching of mathematics, it is soon realised that some concepts and skills are very difficult to teach from the point of view of children&#39;s understanding. For example, how can one establish pupils&#39; understanding of the traditional algorithm for doing long division? What physical models can possibly show that 1/3 = 0.3333...? Can the multiplication of negative numbers have a place in a child&#39;s mathematical conceptual framework? Can it ever made comprehensible? <br/>
In other words, mathematics can sometimes seem difficult because much of it is difficult, but this, for many learners, is part of its appeal, which is something not fully explored in the book. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   Much progress, in the world of mathematical education, has been made by basing the teaching of it upon practical work with appropriately chosen apparatus. For example, Dienes base 10 material is an excellent medium for developing of understanding of place value. Geostrips are a wonderful teaching aid for the exploration of 2d polygonal figures etc, etc. However, Frank Smith makes many comments of the following sort: <br/>
The world of mathematics doesn&#39;t arise from the physical world... except to the extent that it has its roots in the human brain, and it can&#39;t be made part of the physical world&#39; <br/>
If, by this, he means that a concept is not the same thing as an object representing it, I can see some truth in it. Otherwise, it is not the sort of precept upon which to form an approach to the learning of primary mathematics. But then there is the following contradictory statement of page 13: <br/>
The structures of mathematics do not need a human brain or a physical world to support them. <br/>
Overall, I find that many of the issues about the learning of mathematics are discussed in a way that tends to obfuscation rather than clarity. I offer two more examples by way of illustration. <br/>
In the formation of children&#39;s concept of cardinal number, there is a range of practical activities that are based upon the Russell definition, which says that &#39;a natural number is an equivalence class of finite sets under the relation &quot;is in 1-1 correspondence with&quot;.&#39; Therefore, to establish the concept of three, teachers will direct children&#39;s attention to a wide variety of class representatives, such as a set of three bananas, a set of three blind mice, the three bears, the three wise men etc. Yet what are readers to make of statements like that on page 35, where it is said that: <br/>
Numbers don&#39;t derive their meaning from anything in the physical world, but from something in our mind... <br/>
And, on page 4: But in fact, holding up three objects to illustrate the meaning of the word three explains nothing at all... <br/>
Finally, I refer to the discussion of the topic of fractions, discussed in chapter 10, called &#39;Numbers between Numbers&#39;. What on earth is one to make of the following three statements, all made within a few pages of one another? <br/>
... fractions are numbers and can be treated in exactly the same way as whole numbers. (p. 93) <br/>
Ratios aren&#39;t numbers- they are relationships between two numbers. (p. 96) <br/>
To sum up, a fraction is a ratio or proportion of the numerical distance between one number and the next. (p. 96) <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this is an example of what the author meant when he included, in the title, the clause &#39;Why mathematics can sometimes seem difficult&#39;! <br/>
<br/>

~~~<br/>
That&#39;s it!  That&#39;s exactly how I felt, like they were holding back  something <br/>
from me.  I remember being 10, in 5th grade, and I could NOT  &quot;get&quot; long <br/>
division.  I talked in circles with the teacher and I sat at my  desk and stared <br/>
the problems and my eyes got all watery.  I *wanted* to get  it.  I thought I <br/>
understood what they were saying, but it wasn&#39;t coming  together.  Finally, <br/>
after what seemed like weeks of sitting down to do long  division in class, I <br/>
went to Mr. Crowell, and as he explained, I *got* it.   I was so <br/>
mad/relieved/frustrated that I burst into tears and almost screamed,  &quot;Why didn&#39;t you just <br/>
tell me that in the first place?!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
*Fat Mr. Crowell, always my favorite teacher, was so kind to me when he saw  <br/>
the tears, but it was too late by then.  Long division had created trauma  in <br/>
my young life.  The frustration had robbed the joy of  accomplishment.<br/>
 <br/>
I dunno, Dar.  I might ask her to take a break.  When Will wanted  to be able <br/>
to ride his bike and just couldn&#39;t and got so frustrated about it,  we&#39;d have <br/>
a talk about brain development.  If there are no other better  ideas, what <br/>
else is there except that it will come with time?  When I am  working on tough <br/>
problem (usually life, not math, related), going about my  business and parking <br/>
the problem on the back burner allows me to think more  clearly about the <br/>
thing later.  Especially if I&#39;m feeling anxious.  I  call it &#39;allowing time to <br/>
pass&#39;.  The old &quot;sleep on it&quot; thing.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe the pressure Rain is putting on herself to &quot;catch up&quot; is blocking her  <br/>
ability to think clearly?   Maybe the math books need to be removed  from <br/>
between you for a while?  <br/>
 <br/>

*Mr. Crowell looked like Humpty-Dumpty...and egg on legs.  He  had hair <br/>
longer than his shoulders and a beard.  He always wore dress  pants, a short <br/>
sleeved dress shirt and a tie, typical teacher-wear for 1971, and  he looked a <br/>
little greasy, and was always sweating.  I was always afraid  that he smelled, but <br/>
I never smelled him when he was near me.  When we  sat in our desks and he <br/>
walked near, all you could see was the bottom half of  him, from his belt down.  <br/>
That&#39;s how round he was.  He was the one who  was hired to institute the open <br/>
classroom experiment in my school, and I LOVED  him.  He was teacher of the <br/>
year in Illinois once and he wrote to me after  we moved away.  I have tried to <br/>
find him online, but I realize now that his  weight probably made for a short <br/>
life.  <br/>

I know  you said she doesn&#39;t want to get a <br/>
different book - but that&#39;s probably  what she&#39;s going to need to do. <br/>
I&#39;m sure she understands that different  resources are good for <br/>
different people - and that these are really more  like &quot;practice&quot; books <br/>
- she could use them to practice with once she  already understood.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
Here&#39;s another example along that line.  I&#39;ve been trying to be  healthier <br/>
and smaller, and I&#39;ve lost 13 pounds so far.  I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m  going to learn <br/>
to be healthier and smaller the same way I learned to play the  ukulele.  I&#39;m <br/>
going to read a lot of books about being healthy (playing  ukulele), stay away <br/>
from junk science (cheap ukuleles), and use the internet to  track my diet and <br/>
find recipes (tabs for ukulele).  I&#39;m also going to find  other people who <br/>
are trying to be healthier and smaller (playing ukulele) and  learn stuff from <br/>
them and play (exercise) with them, and trade recipes  (music) and ideas (strum <br/>
patterns) with them.<br/>
 <br/>
I realized that I&#39;d been going about the dieting/health thing all  wrong.  <br/>
It&#39;s not just *one* piece of information I need, it&#39;s LOTS of  information, from <br/>
different sources.  Can&#39;t know it all, but what I do know  I can tailor to my <br/>
own needs and lifestyle and way of doing things.<br/>
 <br/>
I have 10 giant trees in my yard.  No one way of dealing with the  limbs and <br/>
leaves that fall is going to cut it.  So we compost some, bag  some, mulch <br/>
some with the lawnmower, chip some limbs for mulch, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
Same with &quot;catching up&quot; to go to school.  One method or technique is  not <br/>
going to cut it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-852802470">Funny.  My 5 year old is Mr. Math and gets concepts and retains them, but<br/>
words are like foreign beings to him....  He just looks at them and makes no<br/>
guess, wild guess or repeats memorization, but doesn&#39;t even link up word<br/>
bunches to the words he is saying...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading chapter books to him upon his request - we just finished My Side<br/>

and correct if I forget something! :)  But the act of reading just is not<br/>

I agree about giving them real things to mess around with.<br/>
And I agree that &quot;watered down&quot; (if watered down means schoolish  <br/>
explanations) is bad.<br/>
 <br/>
But &quot;diving in&quot; (depending what is meant &lt;g&gt;) is unnecessary and can  be <br/>
harmful (if diving means heading straight for math and making sure you get  there).<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s a big benefit to parent and child if the word &quot;math&quot; (or any form  <br/>
thereof) is just not used unless absolutely necessary (like an 18 year old  <br/>
taking a math class and answering the question, &quot;Where are you going?&quot;).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You didn&#39;t have Mrs. Gaunt for third grade, then.<br/>
<br/>
Math in California in 1966 was THE subject, the way reading is now.  <br/>
The commies had beaten us to space and America had to catch up.  Math <br/>
was not beautiful, or poetic -- it was science, and the future, and the <br/>
atomic bomb.  Math and fear were taught together.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in Orange County, in an area where the dads worked in <br/>
aerospace; nearly everyone I knew was an engineer or the child of one.  <br/>
My dad worked on the Minuteman Missile, and I learned geography from <br/>
studying the polar routes the bombs would take.  Science, engineering, <br/>
The Space Race was what mattered.  Failure at math was failure at the <br/>
future.  The math geniuses were the golden children; art, music, <br/>
literature?  a waste of time, although music was supposed to make you <br/>
better at math.  (It didn&#39;t work for me.  I failed at piano from the <br/>
second lesson, when my teacher wrote the word COUNT! across my <br/>
notebook; the association of math with music ruined it.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m healing, though.  I had to decide to do that for myself.  To be <br/>
told math is life, it&#39;s beautiful, etc., is nonsense to someone who was <br/>
abused by its instruction.  What I have to do is enjoy the mathy stuff, <br/>
like pattern blocks and Set, without thinking about it as math.  To me, <br/>
Math exists within the covers of public school textbooks, not out here <br/>
where I live.  I can keep safe from it if I never open the books.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133345991">**It&#39;s been pretty much a disaster, for 3 months or so. The first<br/>
issue was when I<br/>
tried to explain what division meant, when she asked. I drew pictures and<br/>
circled groups, I got her multiplication chart out and tried to<br/>
explain how the<br/>
process was reversed in division, I tried to get objects but she very<br/>
vocally<br/>
objected. She objects to pretty much any way I try to explain<br/>
anything, and she<br/>
really doesn&#39;t like it when I draw things out. &quot;Just tell me!&quot; she<br/>
says, but<br/>
when I tell her she says she doesn&#39;t understand, and when I ask what<br/>
part she<br/>
doesn&#39;t understand she says, &quot;Everything!&quot; It was like she thought<br/>
there was<br/>
some piece I was keeping from her, some important bit of information,<br/>
and she<br/>
was so angry about it.**<br/>
<br/>
My theory is that we all vary wildly in how we represent math ideas<br/>
inside our brain, so that there is variation in how we picture it or<br/>
what words we use to describe it.  This means one person&#39;s sense is<br/>
another person&#39;s nonsense.  This can be frustrating.  (But if you&#39;ve<br/>
had lots of success in tutoring other kids in math, it must feel<br/>
strange to you.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see how you can make your style much different.  I understand<br/>
the urge sometimes to fling a book across the room, but I don&#39;t like<br/>
seeing that urge applied to human beings.<br/>
<br/>
Giving her time to calm down between attempts is all that I can think<br/>
of.  (That and resource suggestions, if she becomes willing to try new<br/>
ones.)<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  Sometimes, when clarifying, we reset ourselves back to the<br/>
beginning and repeat the basic principals, looking for the point where<br/>
confusion sets in.  Maybe this repetition of simple facts is a<br/>
flashpoint of exasperation for a preteen who is being driven by the<br/>
urge to grow up *now*?<br/>
<br/>
PPS  How can she engage physically in what she is doing?  Would<br/>
walking while talking about math help any?  It would leave the<br/>
chalkboard behind!</div>

 </span></blockquote>I have lots...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list, a math lover as well.  I don&#39;t have any children<br/>
as old as your daughter, so I hope that my suggestions are appropriate<br/>
for her.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know why she likes the &quot;key to&quot; workbooks?  Why did she choose<br/>
those over anything else?<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of story-books that are math oriented that she may<br/>
enjoy reading outside of her involvement with the key to workbooks.  <br/>
<br/>
The Number Devil<br/>
The Murderous Maths books<br/>
The Man Who Counted<br/>
MathSmart Jr.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a series called &quot;Hello Math Reader&quot; which will most<br/>
likely be way below your dd&#39;s reading abilities....HOWEVER, the level<br/>
four books would have some interesting math for her to read.<br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest that reading some history of math could help. It<br/>
could help put things into perspective for her without focusing on<br/>
problem solving abilities. It&#39;s been great for us to talk about how<br/>
mathematical concepts came about.<br/>
<br/>
Mathematicians are People Too has a number of short biographies<br/>
String, Straightedge and Shadow<br/>
Archimedes and the Door of Science<br/>
Along Came Galileo<br/>
<br/>
There is also a cool math show on pbs that my kids like called<br/>
Cyberchase - they do a great job of explaining concepts like<br/>
fractions, decimals, percents, as well as some simpler concepts, but<br/>
it is always fun.  Cyberchase also has ventured into novels....<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would help for her to go to a website for a topic with which<br/>
she is having trouble?  Pick a topic of interest and step through the<br/>
explanation?  It would take the burden of explanation off of you at<br/>
the least.<br/>

until recently....<br/>

It takes a bunch of downloading and sorting, but this is a free<br/>
program, it&#39;s innovative, and my children have deemed it FUN.  It&#39;s<br/>
for K-6, but I think it would be enjoyable to an older child (if you<br/>
can convince her out of those boring key to workbooks).  The follow up<br/>

Do you have any younger children?  If so, you could read some basic<br/>
picture books that cover math concepts...I could give you some ideas<br/>
for those if you like.<br/>

Zak was doing Calculus (SP?) at 7... We decided to put him in school (long story) and he went back to 4th Grade Math.  Reason?  He told me &quot;I&#39;m in 4th Grade so I only have to do up to 4th Grade math and they are trying to get me to do Math their way, rather than the way I know how to do it&quot;.... What a disaster.<br/>

Namaste<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-550970692">This is just something I&#39;m excited to share. In my experience with the unschoolers in my city, many of them unschool everything but math.<br/>
<br/>
In the 1930&#39;s L. P. Benezet, a Superintendent in Massachussets, experimented with dropping math from the curriculum of his public schools until 6th grade. His results might be encouraging for anyone who is struggling with what to do about math with their unschool kids. (I was trained as a teacher and love academic educational philosophy type stuff, even though and in some ways even more now that I unschool my children.)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a tidbit: &quot;In other words these [6th graders], by avoiding the early drill on combinations, tables, and that sort of thing, had been able, in one year, to attain the level of accomplishment which the traditionally taught children had reached after three and one-half years of arithmetical drill.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here is the link to describe how he got started in his experiment: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sanjoy/benezet/1.html">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sanjoy/benezet/1.html</a><br/>
<br/>
When he expanded the dropping of math from the curriculum to other classrooms, here is the compromise he worked up with the hesitant principals. Essentially it&#39;s a starter list for teaching math &quot;incidentally&quot; without formal instruction!  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sanjoy/benezet/2.html">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sanjoy/benezet/2.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Peter Gray also wrote about this experiment if you want a less academic summary: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201003/when-less-is-more-the-case-teaching-less-math-in-schools">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201003/when-less-is-more-the-case-teaching-less-math-in-schools</a><br/>
<br/>
I greatly appreciate reassurances to relax and the personal testimonies of unschoolers who have gone before, but I also like it when a good study backs it up!<br/>
