I did one before we left Washington state that was set up like the U.S., and<br/>
there were little open spots at each state.  I was good at that one, you<br/>
just had to work your way across the country, and if you headed too far off<br/>
course, you knew immediately.  Or at least *I* did.  But there were plenty<br/>
of confused teenagers in there trying to remember if Kansas was north of<br/>
Nebraska or south, and if Ohio was east of the Missisippi or west.  It was<br/>
funny.  Sort of pitiful, but funny, too.<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t like corn mazes, though, but maybe that&#39;s because I find them<br/>
clausterphobic.  Never seen them here in Germany; Tim doesn&#39;t remember them<br/>
now.<br/>
