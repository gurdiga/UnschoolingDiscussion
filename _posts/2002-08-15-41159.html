Good question. I&#39;m no theologian, but I&#39;ll try to wing it. <br/>
<br/>
Orthodoxy (small &quot;o&quot;) teaches that God is a Trinity, three persons in one: <br/>
God the Father -- God; God the Son -- Jesus or Christ; and God the Holy <br/>
Spirit -- the Spirit of God dwelling in believers.<br/>
<br/>
Part of Christ&#39;s mission on the Cross was to be forsaken -- on our behalf and <br/>
for our sins -- by God. &quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&quot; There was <br/>
that period of time when Christ was separated from God.<br/>
<br/>
I have a book on my shelf by Dorothy Sayers, that probably gets into this <br/>
very thing. Now that you&#39;ve piqued my interest, I&#39;m gonna go read it!<br/>
