<div id="ygrps-yiv-466313792">I thought I&#39;d share... We just cleaned up the living room, and Gracie brought a puzzle in and sat down by the marker board which is leaning up against the wall because I haven&#39;t managed to hang it on the wall yet. <br/>
   <br/>
  It hit me that her puzzle pieces would probably be pretty darn cool with magnets on the back to play with on the board...so we stuck some on them - some animals...and VOILA! a &quot;new&quot; toy! :-) <br/>
   <br/>
  I just added magnets to a couple other puzzles, and Gracie asked me to put them on her Strawberry Shortcake letters and numbers puzzles as well so I&#39;m working on it. Thought I&#39;d take a moment to share...maybe someone else has little ones who would enjoy this. I bought the roll of magnets at Walmart in the craft section for less than $3, and it has a peel-off thing on the back so you can just stick it onto whatever. <br/>
