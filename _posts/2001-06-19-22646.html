&gt; &gt; WARMAN - A central Saskatchewan school division<br/>
&gt; &gt; stands by its handling of an incident which saw<br/>
&gt; &gt; young children taped to their seats. It happened in<br/>
&gt; &gt; March at the school in the village of Leask, north<br/>
&gt; &gt; of Saskatoon.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Saskatchewan Valley director of education Michael<br/>
&gt; &gt; McLeod says a teacher put a strip of masking tape<br/>
&gt; &gt; over the children&#39;s laps. He says it was meant to<br/>
&gt; &gt; teach fidgety children to stay in their seats.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; McLeod says it was a bad idea. But he says a<br/>
&gt; &gt; disciplinary report on the teacher&#39;s file is all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; punishment that&#39;s warranted.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;The board recognized that she was facing a<br/>
&gt; &gt; challenging situation and sort of reaching into the<br/>
&gt; &gt; barrel or the bag of tricks to try to indicate to<br/>
&gt; &gt; these kids that they needed to behave appropriately<br/>
&gt; &gt; or acceptably.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;So they felt that a letter was appropriate. It<br/>
&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t malicious. It wasn&#39;t harmful. Nobody was<br/>
&gt; &gt; being restrained or injured.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; McLeod says allegations that the teacher restrained<br/>
&gt; &gt; the students using duct tape are false.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lana Johnstone-Ledoux&#39;s six-year-old son, Brandon,<br/>
&gt; &gt; was one of the children taped to his seat. She<br/>
&gt; &gt; thinks the teacher should have been punished more<br/>
&gt; &gt; severely.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;At least they did something, but it&#39;s nothing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; what I imagined what would have happened. I believed<br/>
&gt; &gt; she was going to be removed for doing this.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;I am really disappointed in what she did and how<br/>
&gt; &gt; they dealt with her, because [if] you&#39;re in a day<br/>
&gt; &gt; care and you decide to do something like this to a<br/>
&gt; &gt; kid, you&#39;re not going to have a job.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Johnstone-Ledoux took her son out of the Leask<br/>
&gt; &gt; school after the incident. He finished the year at<br/>
&gt; &gt; the school on the nearby Mistawasis Band reserve. </span></blockquote></div>
