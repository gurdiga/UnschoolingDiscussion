&gt; TEACHING VIRTUES<br/>
&gt; Building Character Across the Curriculum<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;This splendid book brings to education one of the most neglected and<br/>
&gt; abused resources of our continent: the deep knowing of American Indian<br/>
&gt; people. This is precisely what we need to revitalize our educational<br/>
&gt; systems. Everyone who reads this book with an open heart and mind will<br/>
&gt; emerge wise and stronger.&quot; Parker Palmer, The Courage to Teach<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;With clarity and directness, the authors provide an inspiring and<br/>
&gt; practical guide for teachers to infuse character education throughout<br/>
&gt; the curriculum. Their framework adds much needed meaning and integrity<br/>
&gt; to learning and honors the creativity and wisdom of each<br/>
&gt; eacher.&quot;  --Rachael Kessler, The Soul of Education<br/>

&gt; More Praise for Teaching Virtues<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;I read this book with great interest, for the topics addressed are of<br/>
&gt; great importance for educational practice, and hence, for the larger<br/>
&gt; society. They approach the issues of character education from a variety<br/>
&gt; of directions, including a highly suggestive American Indian perspective<br/>
&gt; that has been far too little understood in our culture. This book is a<br/>
&gt; stimulating and thoughtful contribution to character education.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Noam Chomsky (Language and the Problem of Knowledge, Manufacturing<br/>
&gt; Consent, et al)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Teaching Virtues is a fundamental and welcomed change in educational<br/>
&gt; approaches to building character.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Vine Deloria, Jr. (Spirit and Reason, Red Earth, White Lies, Custer Died<br/>
&gt; for Your Sins)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;The authors invite the reader to think outside the box as they<br/>
&gt; construct an innovative model for character, drawing from the great<br/>
&gt; spiritual traditions of First Nations people of North American.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Larry Brendtro, (Reclaiming Youth at Risk, Positive Peer Culture)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Here is an educational approach that honors the interconnectedness of<br/>
&gt; the world and helps our young people engage it with wisdom and<br/>
&gt; integrity. This book is a refreshing perspective on character education.<br/>
&gt; Ron Miller (What Are Schools For? Holistic Education in American<br/>
&gt; Culture)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;We give our highest endorsement to Teaching Virtues.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Mary Williams and Ed De Rouche, Directors of The University of San Diego<br/>
&gt; &#39;s International Center For Character Education. (Educating for Hearts<br/>
&gt; and Minds)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Teaching Virtues adds to understanding of the connections between the<br/>
&gt; teaching of virtues and the practice or moral reciprocity within<br/>
&gt; community. The authors specific recommendations for reforming the<br/>
&gt; curriculum are much needed at this time.&quot;<br/>
&gt; C.A. Bowers (Educating for An Ecologically Sustainable Future, The<br/>
&gt; Culture of Denial)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Brilliantly written, utterly practical. Will make the world a better<br/>
&gt; place&quot;- Thom Hartman ADD: A Different Perception)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This book offers a new but ancient perspective on teaching virtues. Like<br/>
&gt; the American Indian people who practiced it for thousands of years, it<br/>
&gt; does not allow us to separate character from content, and by this, makes<br/>
&gt; it possible for us all to &quot;walk the talk.&quot;<br/>
&gt; --Sunita Gandhi, President-Worker, The Council for Global Education and<br/>
&gt; Dignity<br/>
