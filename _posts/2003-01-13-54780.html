Thanks so much for you suggestions on keeping the siblings close when the oldest moves away.  <br/>
<br/>
There are so many really neat things about having a grown up son and young ones at home.  It sure helps give some perspective on what kids go through growing up and that maturity is simply inevitable.  When I look at my 21 year old, whatever tough times he had growing up seem to melt right out of my memory.  He is truly a terrific young man.  <br/>
<br/>
Your &quot;kids&quot; seem to be very close too.  Although a mixture of eclectic and unschooling has worked for us, with different kids and at different times,  I think the most important thing is the simple fact that we are all together and love and respect one another.  This can occur with many different homeschooling styles.  I imagine there are as many styles as there are families.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Suzanne<br/>

  Even though two of my kids are married and the third is away at college, so<br/>
  far no one has gone &quot;really far away.&quot;  My 22 yod lives about ten miles from<br/>
  us.  My 24 yos was away at college (4 hour drive) for one year, then came<br/>
  back home.  When he got married he lived 20 miles, then 50 miles, and, as of<br/>
  last April, now 200 miles away.  What is neat is that he is going to grad<br/>
  school in the same town his 20yos is at college, so even tho she is in a<br/>
  dorm, they are there for each other.  And she will get to play with the baby<br/>
  a lot more than I will when it comes (due in Feb.).<br/>
<br/>
  All of my kids are close, and there is great excitement when one of the big<br/>
  ones calls or comes home.  The 20yo just went back to school yesterday.  We<br/>
  already miss her!  But I think it helps that the 3 boys have each other to<br/>
  play with ( and fight with) so at least they don&#39;t feel alone.  Also, even<br/>
  though their big brother is far (we see him about every 2 months or more)<br/>
  they like their BIL just about as much.  He plays with them and they model<br/>
  after him (wear caps the same way, etc.).  They see him every 1-2 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
  We all stay in touch, but are also very independent.  We&#39;ve never called or<br/>
  visited daily like some families.  When the two got married, we wanted to<br/>
  give them their space.  We only go over to visit when invited, no drop ins.<br/>
  Both my DIL and my dd have told me they appreciate that.  The other mothers<br/>
  are a bit different - there more often, not always invited, and not always<br/>
  appreciated when they just &quot;stop by.&quot;  But if any of us needs anything - to<br/>
  talk, money, a favor, whatever - we&#39;re all there for each other and we all<br/>
  know it.  The younger boys see that, too.<br/>
<br/>
  How long will son #1 be gone?  That might make a difference in how they feel<br/>
  about it.  Will he be able to come home for visits, like on holidays?<br/>
<br/>
  When mine have just gone on trips (2-3weeks) they have always sent<br/>
  postcards, brought back souvenirs, and called and talked with everyone.<br/>
  Maybe your family can do things to try and *be* together - like have same<br/>
  meals, try out some of the customs, share as much as you can long-distance.<br/>
  Also, let son #2 express his feelings, then do constructive things to try to<br/>
  feel better - write, e-mail, make a gift, anything that connects him with<br/>
  his brother (watch *their* favorite movie, play a game, etc.).  These are<br/>
  some of the things we did when the baby died - we let the boys play with the<br/>
  baby&#39;s toys, gave them their own framed and wallet pictures of Joel, let<br/>
  them buy him things.  This lasted for about the first year, then tapered<br/>
  off.  If your son has strong feelings of loss, there are books that will<br/>
  give more ideas.<br/>
<br/>
  Finally, help them enjoy their time together now!<br/>
