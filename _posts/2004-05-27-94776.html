<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117313987">Hello there, you very cool group of smart and inspiring unschoolers, you-<br/>
<br/>
I have been &quot;lurking&quot; (that sounds so sordid) on this list for a while (as<br/>
wisely instructed by the guidelines), and although it is a little<br/>
overwhelming to follow all the threads and stay on top of the volume, it has<br/>
been a breath of fresh air to have my inbox so full of your thoughts on so<br/>
many topics.  It is a privilege to witness the integrity and scrupulous<br/>
nature of many of the postings.  (Actually more like a hurricane - but a<br/>
friendly one!)  I thought I had invented &quot;unschooling&quot; (I hadn&#39;t come up<br/>
with that name for it - I called it &quot;essential self schooling for kids&quot;<br/>
inspired by Martha Beck) and was hiding-out in my house hoping I didn&#39;t get<br/>
arrested for it.  What an incredible pleasure and relief it has been to find<br/>
you all!<br/>
<br/>
My ex husband recently lost his job and it seems as if our finances and<br/>
living arrangements will soon drastically change.  The biggest fear that I<br/>
have is that I will have to work full-time, and will no longer be able to be<br/>
home with my girls (ages 11 and 13) during the day.  Are there any &#39;working&#39;<br/>
(out of the home) single unschooling moms (parents) out there? I would love<br/>
to hear anyone&#39;s thoughts (working or no, single or no) about how to make it<br/>
work.  I can&#39;t bear to think of the girls going back to school- it makes my<br/>
blood curl!  It feels irresponsible to leave them alone all day, but the<br/>
alternatives are equally frightening.  All brainstorming welcome!!<br/>
<br/>
(Or maybe you know someone in the Philadelphia area who wants to have an<br/>
unschooling mom and kids move in with them?  We bring with us singing, good<br/>
cheer, organization, meal cooking, babysitting and laughter!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-404736519">Hi Amy,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m mostly a lurker myself... but, I am a single working unschooler - so I thought I&#39;d pop in a note...<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to leave a child home - and I think it really depends on the child. Mine is an only child - but very self-sufficient.  Your daughters have each other - but do they get along well together?  Happily, I have the kind of job where my son and I can check in with each other several times a day (and often, a few times an hour!).  I always know what&#39;s going on.  I love the calls that start with &quot;Mom!  guess what I just found out!&quot;...  <br/>
<br/>
It can be done - and I admit, it was very rough on us both at first - but, it&#39;s been like this for over a year now - and he&#39;s just blossoming.  And it&#39;s like a party most nights when I get home!  We celebrate the time together and talk about everything that&#39;s gone on - and what&#39;s on the plate for the next day... Weekends become our mini-vacations as we go out and explore things - and he picks up a new interest that will spark even more of those phone calls I love the next week.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck! and Take care,<br/>
<br/>
Lari<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Could you consider moving to Alabama?  Moving the kids away from their dad<br/>
and friends might not be a good thing, but I have been wishing for this sort<br/>
of arrangement.  We have a big house (6,000 sq. ft.), two kids (12 ds and 10<br/>
dd), a stable marriage, and my husband&#39;s income is reliable.   For us, it<br/>
would mean paying more for food and a little more for utilities, and<br/>
rearranging the house so it accommodates two families.   Not much of a<br/>
downside there.  It&#39;s a thought, and it will have me daydreaming all day!!<br/>
You can email me privately if you&#39;d like.    Deirdre</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-696849144">Hey, there~ I&#39;m originally from Philadelphia but now in NM. I am a single, <br/>
unschooling mom and we barely get by but it&#39;s a choice I&#39;ve made money vs. being <br/>
there for my son. It can be sooo hard...I really don&#39;t have any concrete <br/>
suggestions but just wanted you to know there&#39;s someone else out there in similiar <br/>
circumstances. I&#39;m working at home freelance editing and just started <br/>
writing. I&#39;m also an Usborne books educational consultant and know of people making <br/>
very comfortable incomes that way.<br/>
<br/>
We are very, very, very blessed in that my parents help out tremendously. I <br/>
put a nice sized down payment on our house and my parents are currently, paying <br/>
the mortgage....so we co-own it, but the house is in their name and it has <br/>
almost doubled in value. It&#39;s a pretty safe and lucrative investment and I will <br/>
pay them back when we decide to sell or when I&#39;m making more money.<br/>
<br/>
Would it be possible to caretake a house or help on a farm in exchange for <br/>
free housing and living expenses? There are so many homes in Bucks County (and <br/>
all over PA) that are second and third homes w/guesthouses or private wings. <br/>
Perhaps you could post flyers in the area? There is a Fresh Fields in or around <br/>
Jenkintown, that may be a place to start and also Newtown, Yardley, New Hope <br/>
and across the river there. Also, Lancaster County is up and coming and trendy <br/>
w/huge homes so ythat may be an option, too.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
Debbie~:)<br/>
