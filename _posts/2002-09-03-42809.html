&lt;&lt; Please excuse what is probably a dumb question...can you get these oats at <br/>
a <br/>
 grocery store or from a natural food store? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Any grocery store carries them. It&#39;s just plain old oats in the can, you <br/>
know, like Quaker oats that you make into oatmeal. &#39;course you can get <br/>
organic ones at the food co-ops or health food stores.<br/>
And here&#39;s something I learned recently....The quick oats are actually better <br/>
for you than the old fashioned rolled oats. The only difference between the <br/>
two is how thin they slice the grain. A  thinner sliced oat will digest <br/>
easier and you&#39;ll extract more nutrients from it, cool eh? One of the only <br/>
times that something more processed is actually better!! :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; better <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like the texture of the slow-cooked ones, and the contrast between the <br/>
&quot;soup&quot; of it and the oats.  With quick oats you just get the mush.<br/>
<br/>
And for making oatmeal cookies I like the slow cooking for cookie-texture <br/>
too.  But for cookies for little kids maybe the one-minute oats would be <br/>
better.  Some of them don&#39;t like texture if they can avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
Instant oatmeal, like in the little packets, is too weird for me.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t like the soup texture of instant oats either. And I can&#39;t stand those <br/>
little packets. I have two favorite breakfasts on cold mornings. One is to <br/>
put a bowl of my granola with some milk in the microwave. Its like eating a <br/>
warm oatmeal cookie with milk. The other is a bowl of hot oatmeal with a bit <br/>
of butter, a sprinkle of brown sugar and a dash of cinnamon. Darin likes his <br/>
oatmeal with maple syrup. That&#39;s good too. <br/>
