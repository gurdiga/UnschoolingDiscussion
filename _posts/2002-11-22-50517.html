<div id="ygrps-yiv-492738332">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
My best advice for both your son and your broken leg is to go see a homeopath. It&#39;s the best you can do. To speed up your healing process, you can take Symphytum 30x  3 times a day for a couple weeks.<br/>
Find it at a health food store. You&#39;ll be amazed at the results!<br/>
<br/>
Your son&#39;s situation sounds more like he needs constitutional treatment, and not just something to remove the warts. What homeopathy does is remove the underlying *cause* for him to develop warts, as<br/>
opposed to removing the warts and leaving the underlying tendency to produce some more (or some other growth).<br/>
<br/>
To put it simply, homeopathy is to health what unschooling is to learning. Or as the Tao Te Ching says,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When nothing is done, nothing is left undone. The world is ruled by letting things take their course. It cannot be ruled by interfering.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Homeopathy stimulates the body&#39;s own ability to heal in a gentle and effective way.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you&#39;ll feel better soon!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; Keith took Kirby to a podiatrist today.  He has a plantars wart getting<br/>
&gt; worse<br/>
&gt; &gt; and worse, after two liquid nitrogen treatments.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know that this sounds really off the wall, but we successfully reated my<br/>
&gt; son&#39;s plantars warts with banana peels!  I read about banana peels for warts<br/>
&gt; in _Smart Medicine for a Healthier Child_ by Zand, Walton and Rountree.  I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t know if it would work on plantars warts, but it did.  He had a<br/>
&gt; cluster of 4 on his foot.  Every night, before bed, we would put a fresh<br/>
&gt; slice of banana peel on the warts, inside side facing the skin, and cover<br/>
&gt; with a band-aid.  After about a month, it looked like the &quot;seed&quot; of the wart<br/>
&gt; (the blackisk spots that are usually inside) were at the surface.  We went<br/>
&gt; swimming for the day, and they came out.  There were little craters where<br/>
&gt; the warts used to be.  There was no pain and no blood.  In a few weeks the<br/>
&gt; skin had evened out and you couldn&#39;t tell that there had ever been warts<br/>
&gt; there!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; FWIW,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S.  I have been lurking here for several weeks and I have to say that I<br/>
&gt; really love this list! (Thanks, Barb!) </span></blockquote></div>

I&#39;ll ask friends to advise him on that.<br/>
I had one plantar&#39;s wart when I was 17 and never another one.  He got one <br/>
just like it at 16.  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve had warts, but not plantar ones...we tied strings around them and they <br/>
eventually fell off.<br/>

I had them on both feet when I was about 11 or 12. Back then the treatment <br/>
seemed barbaric. I remember all the visits and the chemicals how they burned <br/>
and all the scraping. Yuck!!!<br/>
I&#39;d have tried a banana or duct tape anyday!!<br/>
