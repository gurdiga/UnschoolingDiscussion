<div id="ygrps-yiv-831343714">***any artists who work at home in a studio while they unschool their<br/>
kids?***<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do.  I work in my studio everyday at least a little while.  It&#39;s<br/>
gotten easier as my kids have gotten older and noe they sometimes join<br/>
me (my daughter does mostly).<br/>
If you want to talk about it off list you can email me privately.<br/>
