&lt;&lt; Have you heard of The Ungame? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
HEY!! We just played that today!!!<br/>
We used to use it in the grief counseling I did, to get the kids warmed up to <br/>
the group or to help break down walls.<br/>
My 5y.o. had Pizza in just about every one of her answers today...but the <br/>
great thing is, it doesn&#39;t matter! Everyone can just relax and have fun.<br/>
I was also going to suggest taking the regular games you play and turning <br/>
them into cooperative with just a little creativity.<br/>
Musical chairs is played at our house by taking away a chair each time the <br/>
music stops, but no one ever gets &quot;out&quot;. Everyone just has to fit on less <br/>
chairs. By the end of the game, everyone piles onto one chair, laughing and <br/>
giggling and falling down...it&#39;s great.<br/>
If you have a parachute, you can play &quot;shark and minnows&quot;. One person is the <br/>
shark, one is a lifegaurd and all the rest are minnows. The minnows sit on <br/>
the ground holding the parachute, the shark is under the parachute and the <br/>
lifegaurd stands behind the minnows. The shark grabs the minnows legs and <br/>
pulls them underneath the parachute with him/her....and the lifegaurd is the <br/>
only one that can save them. Once you are pulled under you become a shark and <br/>
&quot;attack&quot; the other minnows. Eventually everyone becomes a shark and you start <br/>
all over. People can take turns being the lifegaurd (or more than one person <br/>
can play lifegaurd...or no one).<br/>
We also loved &quot;Sardines&quot; when we were kids.....<br/>
It&#39;s hide and seek but one person hides while everyone else seeks. If you <br/>
find the person, you climb into the hiding place WITH them. Eventually <br/>
everyone is crammed into the one hiding place, the last person to find them <br/>
can be the person that hides the next time.<br/>
We have a book that I can&#39;t seem to find right now. I think it&#39;s called &quot;We <br/>
All Win&quot; or something.<br/>
Anyway, hope that helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015030384">We went yard saling Saturday and I found an unopened brand new <br/>
Mastermind game.   My kids like it which is a pleasant surprise for me <br/>
because they don&#39;t like Set or Quiddler so I have no one to play with. <br/>
 Anyway, it is not really non-competitive, but it is hard to get <br/>
worked up over who&#39;s winning because it is such a slow paced and <br/>
contemplative game.<br/>
