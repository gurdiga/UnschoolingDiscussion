has a lot to do with self-confidence and a &#39;state of being&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
They are so concerned because of their fears, and your unschooling <br/>
existence threatens a paradigm.<br/>
<br/>
Nicki, if you want to take any of this offlist, I would love to continue <br/>
the discussion, it sure sounds like your going through a lot of what I <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Sarah,<br/>
I was not trying to exclude anyone intentionally... !<br/>
<br/>
All I can do is share my experiences and my observations.<br/>
<br/>
And one of those observations is that when people object profusely to an <br/>
idea, its because either:<br/>
A) you are shaking the ground of their beleif system that doesn&#39;t have <br/>
solidity to it<br/>
B) you are pushing buttons of a past hurt<br/>
C) you are bringing up insecurities of decisions they now regret and need <br/>
to hold fast that they made the best decision.<br/>
<br/>
When you bring up an idea that is contrary to someone&#39;s beleif system and <br/>
they don&#39;t object, but still hold fast to their ideals, then they are <br/>
secure in their choice and themselves as a person.<br/>
<br/>
Lets take (C) for example:<br/>
<br/>
When I refused to go back to NYC after the West Nile incident and they <br/>
were spraying pesticides in the streets almost daily, I ended up <br/>
&#39;homeless&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
My mother kept telling me how I was hurting the kid by this choice. She <br/>
was angry and it was the first time in my life that she kept calling to <br/>
give advice. Instead of offering help emotional help  (yes, she did pay <br/>
my hotel bill for a bit while I was homeless) she kept saying that I was <br/>
hurting my child. Then of course, because of her belief, the rest of <br/>
family offered their discontent with my choice.<br/>
<br/>
It shook her core that I was willing to do anything to keep my kid out of <br/>
a area being inundated with pesticides. It shook her so hard because when <br/>
we were kids, she didn&#39;t hesitate to use Chlordane (sp) at full strength <br/>
whenever she saw anything in the house move. She used to make us scrub <br/>
the floor with it.<br/>
<br/>
If she would agree with me about the pesticides, then her choices as a <br/>
mother would be up for question in her own mind. Its far easier to refute <br/>
the idea, than to forgive yourself for something you *thought* was right.<br/>
<br/>
If any of this hits home for you. Then lets continue to discuss.. geez <br/>
I&#39;ve learned so much from people here.. !<br/>
<br/>
Warm regards,<br/>

omg... you hit home in a *big* way with your post. My mind is racing. <br/>
I&#39;ll have to give this some thought and respond later tonight. Got to <br/>

toxic level, any predisposition to disease is going to happen and happen <br/>
fast.<br/>
<br/>
so far, its holding good. if i can just stay away from viruses long <br/>
enough to build up a better immune, it will stay reversed. this will be <br/>
the hard part. after all, i live in NYC and its not the healthiest place <br/>
to be!<br/>
<br/>
oh, and staying destressed. because emotions and happiness are a BIG key.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s possible that my mom&#39;s very rare thyroid cancer was related to her<br/>
being irradiated when she was a child, back in the forties. I can&#39;t<br/>
remember the exact gland, maybe adrenal? a gland that&#39;s often much bigger<br/>
in children than adults, but doctors during that time period thought that<br/>
was a problem and gave kids large doses of radiation to shrink it...<br/>
which worked, except that the gland was supposed to be the size it<br/>
was....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, exposure to radiation is the only known factor that will increase<br/>
your chances of developing anaplastic thyroid cancer - and often there<br/>
are 20 or more years between exposure and the cancer developing, in my<br/>
mom&#39;s case it was more like 50 years - but I imagine there are a lot of<br/>
other toxic events that happen to people over their lives, and we just<br/>
don&#39;t know what effect they&#39;re having.<br/>
<br/>
One in every three people will eventually develop some kind of cancer...<br/>

I&#39;m glad you&#39;re doing well and let&#39;s home the buggie viruses steer <br/>
clear of you!<br/>
You&#39;re so right about staying de-stressed. It&#39;s so easy to get caught <br/>
up in situations, isn&#39;t it? I have to step outside of myself and <br/>
decide if it&#39;s worth feeling so bad over (I get skin ulcers under <br/>
stress). Usually I can quickly decide things are not worth the pain!<br/>

<br/>
in healthy adults, it doesn&#39;t shrink and is one of best immune boosters <br/>
going. but alas we are a toxic society and it does shrink as we get older.<br/>
<br/>
radiation! whew! your mom must of had some great constitution that it <br/>
took 50 years to catch up...<br/>
<br/>
amazing how conventional science can look back only a few years and see <br/>
how much damage they&#39;ve done, yet they still refute findings throughout <br/>
the world that contradict their current practices.<br/>
<br/>
ego. somehow it all comes down to *wanting* to be right as opposed to <br/>
working towards a greater good.<br/>
