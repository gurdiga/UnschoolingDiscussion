   The BEST factory tour we ever took was the Jelly Belly jelly bean <br/>
factory in Vacaville, Calif.  We watched zillions of jelly beans <br/>
being made.  They even gave away free samples.  We also <br/>
bought &#39;rejects&#39; in the company store $1.00/lb. <br/>

Then we did a tour of a goat dairy and they made cheese and sausage.  The<br/>
kids got to milk a goat and samples of the cheese and sausage.<br/>
<br/>
The most fun was the Blue Ox Mills.  They do restoration wood working for<br/>
Victorians and use antique equipment.  It is &quot;way kooool&quot; as the kidlets<br/>
say. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.victorianstation.com/blueox.htm">http://www.victorianstation.com/blueox.htm</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983773461">Hi Teri --<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not getting mail either. I thought my &quot;in&quot; box was full and <br/>
bouncing mail back, but after clearing it, still not getting <br/>
anything. (From lists or otherwise.) I&#39;m taking the &quot;wait and see&quot; <br/>
approach. :)<br/>
<br/>
We went to a furniture maker&#39;s shop last year. Two. My 8yo was into <br/>
woodworking. Lots of machines and noise and people happy to talk to <br/>
him about what they were making and what each machine did.<br/>

Either see if anywhere local advertises tours <br/>
(breweries do, I&#39;ve found ;-) though whether that&#39;s of <br/>
interest to the kidlets...)  or ask the local council <br/>
education office (or whatever your equivalent is, <br/>
county ed board?) where they take kids on tours, or <br/>
just find out what people are interested in and phone <br/>
somewhere that does/makes that and ask if they could do <br/>
a tour for a small party...  I think smaller workshops <br/>
would be more interesting (and perhaps less formal) <br/>
than bigger places, but u might have a prob with Health <br/>
& Safety Regs.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, whatever u do, let us know how it went!!<br/>

   My son reminded me of one other great field trip we did.  It was <br/>
to a farm where they had laid out a giant maze in a corn field.  We <br/>
were there all afternoon wandering in and out.  This one had <br/>
volunteers who would appear once in a while to help those of us who <br/>
were &quot;direction challenged&quot; get out of this thing :)<br/>
<br/>
   The one we went to was near Davis, Calif, but I understand these <br/>
are popular in the mid-west.  Check with the local agriculture <br/>
commission type people.<br/>
