There was a Christmas special some years back and one of the views  <br/>
(animated) is going into the window, and into an ornament that has a little  village <br/>
scene it it, and into a window of that, and then a story starts (I  think).  <br/>
This is like that, but way moreso.<br/>
 <br/>
You can control it with the mouse.  You can go slower, forward or  backwards.<br/>

Marty showed it to me.<br/>
