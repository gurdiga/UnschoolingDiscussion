CBS Attacks Home Schools<br/>
by Steve Jordahl, correspondent <br/>
<br/>
Home schoolers are angry with Dan Rather and the Eye <br/>
Network after a scathing report. <br/>
<br/>
Home schoolers are mad at CBS News for unleashing a <br/>
scathing attack on them in a two-part report. Called &quot;A Dark <br/>
Side to Home Schooling,&quot; it singled out cases of abuse and <br/>
death at the hands of home-school parents  and left the <br/>
impression the problem is rampant. <br/>
<br/>
Specifically, &quot;The CBS Evening News with Dan Rather&quot; report <br/>
said: &quot;A CBS News investigation found dozens of cases of <br/>
parents accused or convicted of child abuse or murder who <br/>
were teaching their children at home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wendy Jeub, who teaches her children at home, said she <br/>
was offended by the story  which paints home schooling <br/>
with a very broad brush.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;(CBS is) blaming home schooling for abuse, neglect and <br/>
even murder,&quot; Jeub said. &quot;It&#39;s like blaming the public schools <br/>
for any crime that&#39;s ever been committed by a public school <br/>
student.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Chris Klicka, an attorney with the Home School Legal <br/>
Defense Association, said someone is out to discredit <br/>
the home-school movement and is using CBS to do so.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;(These allegations) couldn&#39;t be further from the truth, and <br/>
this is really inaccurate and unprofessional reporting,&quot; Klicka <br/>
said. &quot;I definitely think that there are certain elite (members <br/>
of) the education communities in America who do have some <br/>
sway with the media.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said this report might be the first of many attacks in the <br/>
mainstream media.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We think the honeymoon (home schooling has had) with the <br/>
press is over,&quot; Klicka said. &quot;They&#39;ve been with us for the most <br/>
part over the last 20 years; we have been considered the <br/>
underdog.&quot;<br/>
