&lt;&lt; When my kids have grown more, I&#39;m planning to cycle across America so I&#39;ll <br/>
be collecting addresses for that.... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keep me in mind too Shyrley!  The gulf is a fabulous biking area, what with <br/>
all those beautiful beaches and all.<br/>
Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll be able to join ya for a stretch.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt; Avila Beach (one of the best kids<br/>
 beaches ever),  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oooh, ooooh, ooh. I STILL have dreams about moving to Avila beach.<br/>
We positively love that area of Cali and had wanted to move to San Luis <br/>
Obispo. We decided it was WAY too expensive and moved to FL instead.<br/>
Sometimes I wish we&#39;d at least tried Cali first.<br/>
We looked at a house up on the hill in Avila beach that I&#39;ve never forgotten. <br/>
It was white and oldish style with a porch that wrapped all around. (a mere <br/>
$300,000 ten years ago). I decided I wanted to stay a homeowner and we <br/>
couldn&#39;t have been if we&#39;d moved there.<br/>
