&lt;&lt; Don&#39;t you KNOW that Sandra has Ultimate Power and controls the thoughts and<br/>
behaviors of us all, most especially Helen (list owner) and Joyce (list<br/>
moderator)? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I thought I told you never to say that.<br/>
<br/>
No steak knives for you this round.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not happy when people become obsessed with me.  It&#39;s embarrassing for me, <br/>
and SHOULD be embarrassing for them.   But I&#39;m not going to stop writing <br/>
about unschooling.  I&#39;m not writing everywhere.  There&#39;s an AOL unschooling <br/>
board (sad little thing, but still there), there are lots of sites I&#39;m never <br/>
on, and likely lots I&#39;ve never heard of.  I&#39;m here, on Always Learning, <br/>
HEM-Unschooling, and at www.unschooling.com. That&#39;s not the whole unschooling <br/>
universe.  <br/>
<br/>
People who pretend that if they don&#39;t get their unschooling information here <br/>
they can&#39;t get it at all are just being troublemakers.  Still, I do think the <br/>
best unschooling information available anywhere these days is at <br/>
www.unschooling.com, and this is a subset of that entity.<br/>
