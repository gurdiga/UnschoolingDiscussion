<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794598112">Evidently Marilyn vos Savant received numerous letters<br/>
from happy <br/>
homeschoolers, but sorry, folks, she&#39;s not convinced.<br/>
She says we <br/>
didn&#39;t answer the question she asked. Here&#39;s an<br/>
excerpt from her <br/>
latest response on Parade&#39;s website:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...Many home-schoolers described how well their kids<br/>
are doing and <br/>
their high hopes for them, but almost no one addressed<br/>
my concern <br/>
that a large percentage of the kids would never use<br/>
their educations <br/>
if they became home-schoolers themselves. Gifted<br/>
violinists would <br/>
never be heard in a concert hall; great leaders would<br/>
never be able <br/>
to change society; brilliant scientists would never<br/>
have a shot at <br/>
curing cancer.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a question to ask yourself: Would you want to<br/>
home-school your <br/>
sons and then watch them become home-schooling parents<br/>
themselves <br/>
instead of having careers? This is a serious<br/>
philosophical issue: If <br/>
you stay at home and teach your child rocket science,<br/>
and he stays at <br/>
home and teaches his child rocket science, and he<br/>
stays at home and <br/>
teaches his child rocket science, when does anyone<br/>
ever become a <br/>
rocket scientist? In short, home-schooling is easy to<br/>
recommend for <br/>
certain individuals, but hard to recommend for<br/>
society...&quot; (e-mail: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:marilyn@...">marilyn@...</a>)<br/>
<br/>
Heres my responce to her question : Let me know what<br/>
you guys think ..<br/>
Marilyn,<br/>
This is in responce to your homeschool  questions ...<br/>
I have been homeschooling for 2 years now and I love<br/>
it ... Someone once asked me what hopes i had for my<br/>
daughter when  she grows up ...I hope for her to find<br/>
and have faith in God ,to have a wonderful husband<br/>
,and a happy long life ,Then the question came about<br/>
her career ,Or to homeschool her kids.  I hope that<br/>
she does homeschool her children !!! I hope that i<br/>
have installed  in her that children are the most<br/>
important part of our lives ..That  a child  is a gift<br/>
from God and that it is our job to raise that child<br/>
and to take care of them  to teach them about God <br/>
...Not to push them off one someone else to raise ,or<br/>
send them off for some one to teach them that man came<br/>
from apes....It is our  &quot;career &quot;to raise our<br/>
children. It is more rewarding then any paying JOB <br/>
there is out there ...As far as my daughter  using her<br/>
gifts or being a leader. We as homeschool parents do<br/>
all that. We teach our children what we know, we share<br/>
our gifts with them, we lead them in the direction<br/>
they want to go. We do not force them to think one way<br/>
or another. They are free to think on their own, not<br/>
what someone else tells them that it is the way to<br/>
think. That someone elses ideas are better then<br/>
theirs.. We look and learn at all angles, not just one<br/>
sided  views . To answer your question,  I would be<br/>
very proud if my daughter or sons grows up to<br/>
homeschool their children .<br/>
Thank you ,<br/>
Wanda  In SC.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109783466">Here is what I wrote to her:<br/>
<br/>
Marilyn,<br/>
I recently saw some of your comments at a homeschooling e-mail list <br/>
I&#39;m on.<br/>
I must say, for someone as vocal as you are, I am surprised you are <br/>
willing to put your name on some of these comments before you <br/>
research a little further.<br/>
Your question about homeschoolers raising up more homeschoolers and <br/>
no one entering the workforce is absurd.<br/>
Most homeschooling families have at least one parent working, do they <br/>
not?<br/>
Do you think all of those children will grow up to ONLY homeschool <br/>
and do nothing else?<br/>
I know homeschooled children that are out in the world today, doing <br/>
fabulous at their vocations of choice and plan to homeschool their <br/>
own one day.<br/>
I am quite sure that they will either continue at their chosen career <br/>
paths or put them on hold to raise children (in itself a viable and <br/>
worthy career choice...too bad you don&#39;t realize that) and then <br/>
continue with work that is satisfying to them.<br/>
If we look at education over all, homeschooling is making a mockery <br/>
of the public system.<br/>
That irks people. But to use the excuse that homeschoolers will not <br/>
contribute to society in any other way is so absurd I can hardly <br/>
believe it!<br/>
I have children that are a part of society NOW. They don&#39;t have to <br/>
wait for some magical &quot;when I grow up&quot; time to be a part of their <br/>
comunity and world. They can volunteer (along with myself or not), <br/>
work and educate themselves in a variety of methods....instead of <br/>
sitting in some false environment all day.<br/>
As their mother, I work part time myself, but do not feel it is <br/>
necessary for a fulfilling and meaningful life.<br/>
My husband and I run a successful home business we started from <br/>
absolutely nothing but our own hard work.<br/>
How on earth are we not contributing to our community or society <br/>
because we homeschool?<br/>
Many, many people contribute to society in a myriad of ways, while <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
You really need to do some research to prevent yourself from looking <br/>
ignorant on a subject you are willing to speak so loudly about.<br/>
You seem to think homeschoolers just stay home and &quot;homeschool&quot; all <br/>
day....that is laughable.<br/>
Homeschoolers are usually far and away, extremely involved in and <br/>
contributing to the communities in which they choose to live.<br/>
For some, like myself, that is in the heart of a town. Running a <br/>
business and serving other members of the community.<br/>
For others it involves military service and travel, yet others find <br/>
their place in the country with homesteading or farming.<br/>
Here are a few of the careers homeschooling families right here in my <br/>
town are doing....Herpetologist, Beauty consultant, Contractor, <br/>
Artist, Doctor, Pilot, Real Estate Agent, Bookstore owner, Manager <br/>
for an auto store, Interior design, ....the list goes on.<br/>
These are homeschooling Mothers AND Fathers, and in many cases, <br/>
children. <br/>
I know single parents that homeschool, small and large families and I <br/>
have never met one single family that was not contributing to society <br/>
in some way, large or small.<br/>
If people that homeschooled, ONLY homeschooled and did nothing else <br/>
for the entirety of their days then you MIGHT have a point.<br/>
But you see, that isn&#39;t how it goes at all.<br/>
So you have no point. Do some research.<br/>

I wrote too, but I sent it and didn&#39;t copy it first and it <br/>
disappeared.<br/>
I commented on her lack of basic math skills.  It doesn&#39;t take an <br/>
entire lifetime to homeschool your children!!<br/>
I also went into the fact, like you did, that many people are <br/>
involved NOW, with their children, in real life pursuits.<br/>
I left her with those great quotes by Plato, Margaret Mead, Mark <br/>
Twain, Albert Einstein.....<br/>

doing so.<br/>
But...I will. :-)<br/>
I think if you are going to send persuasive letter, you should be <br/>
very careful with your spelling and grammar.  On a message board or e <br/>
list, it really doesn&#39;t matter.  We&#39;re all just whipping out our <br/>

Also, is this woman Marilyn a Christian or even religious at all?<br/>
If so, your comments on God and schools teaching about evolution is <br/>
valid.   However, to someone who is not religious(esp. Christian) the <br/>
point is moot.  <br/>
I commented on this, not to pick or be mean.  I wanted to give you <br/>
some suggestions if you ever decide to write to someone again.<br/>
If you disagree, then simply disregard.  :-)<br/>
