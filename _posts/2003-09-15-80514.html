<div id="ygrps-yiv-169488882">Hi, I haven&#39;t posted since this list evolved from Unschooling Dotcom but the<br/>
posts on dealing with rage and consideration for others have really got me<br/>
thinking.<br/>
I agree with those who have said that it&#39;s OK and even necessary to remove a<br/>
child from certain situations where his or her behavior violates the rights<br/>
of others. I&#39;m a Pagan, and we have a guiding principle that many of us<br/>
follow, &quot;Do what you will and harm none.&quot; To me this supports freedom and<br/>
self-expression as long as we consider the consequences of our actions and<br/>
respect the rights of others to their own freedom.<br/>
<br/>
I remembered something that happened to me in college which I wanted to<br/>
share, as I think it&#39;s relevant to the discussion. My best friend at the<br/>
time took me aside and said something on the order of, &quot;You need to stop<br/>
being<br/>
so bossy, show a little more respect for other people&#39;s space, quit<br/>
interrupting when someone else is talking, and<br/>
listen to what people are saying to you, or you won&#39;t have too many friends<br/>
left!&quot; He also gave specific examples of things I had done and said that<br/>
were not respectful or considerate.<br/>
I cried for two days. I honestly hadn&#39;t had any idea of how my behavior was<br/>
affecting (alienating!) others.<br/>
Now I thank him for the pep talk.  He was a true friend (and a gentle soul<br/>
who must have been REALLY pissed off to get to the point of needing to speak<br/>
to me that way). I still talk too much and tend to be bossy, but from that<br/>
day on I&#39;ve been more aware of the issues I need to deal with. I might have<br/>
ended up pretty lonely if he hadn&#39;t pointed these things out to me.<br/>
 My son is still very little but as he gets older he will need to learn that<br/>
people won&#39;t want to be around him unless he<br/>
respects their needs as well as his own. And it makes sense to me that that<br/>
learning begins with the way we treat each other at home.<br/>
