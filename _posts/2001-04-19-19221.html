Some of my friends don&#39;t like hairy men either.  My husband is fairly hairy, <br/>
but blonde.  His brother has almost the same build and hirsuteness, but dark <br/>
hair.  I have found myself staring at his brother&#39;s shoulders sometimes or <br/>
arms.  I try not to. &lt;g&gt;  His brother never grows facial hair, though.  <br/>
Shaves.  My husband has had a full beard almost all the time I&#39;ve known him.  <br/>
He has hair to his waist too.   And STILL Honeywell has let him work there 15 <br/>
years, through all their big layoffs...  <br/>

<p>The true story of Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), who was the first 
African American to become a master diver in the Navy, MEN OF HONOR is a serious 
film about the way that two men helped each other overcome such daunting 
challenges as racism, physical impairment, and the cagey rules of the military 
system. Tenured master diver Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) is simultaneously the 
most vicious adversary and most loyal supporter of Brashear&#39;s, motivating him to 
succeed. An endearing drama, MEN OF HONOR tells an inspirational story about 
human spirit and determination. </p></font></div>

  learning experience!<br><br>You mean &#39;Inconcthievable&#39; don&#39;t you?&nbsp;
