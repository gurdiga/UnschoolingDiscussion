<div id="ygrps-yiv-775399439">Well, the boys are back home again.  I have 5 children; 3 boys- 11, 10, 9 and 2<br/>
girls- 6 and 3.  We have tried various schooling methods:  p.s., hs, p.s., a one-rm<br/>
rural schoolhouse (yes they still exist!), hs, and just until Friday, parochial<br/>
school.  In that order.<br/>
<br/>
When they were home, I tried my best to unschool but kept having nagging doubts.  In<br/>
my heart of hearts I believed that this was the way to go.  But, I was/am still<br/>
under the shackles of the system.  It is hard to break a lifetime of<br/>
manipulation--hmm, &quot;thought control&quot; as George Orwell said in 1984.  During the<br/>
course of our educational trials, we as a family, converted to Catholicism.  So, I<br/>
thought, &quot;Well, I haven&#39;t given the Catholic schools a try.  They are suppose to be<br/>
so good in our Diocese.&quot;  So, against my boy&#39;s will, we went and looked at the<br/>
school the first week of Sept. and agreed w/the school to do a two month trial.  I&#39;m<br/>
here to tell you:  It&#39;s still school no matter how one tries to color it.  Actually,<br/>
it was a great learning experience for us.  Myself and the boys have gotten a better<br/>
appreciation for what we had at home.  And, it proved to me that unschooling works!<br/>
<br/>
My 6 yr old daughter although *loves* it!  It&#39;s kindergarten, she has friends and is<br/>
still going to continue.  Actually, she&#39;s why I considered it in the first place.<br/>
She *really* wanted to go to school.  Well, I told her she could finish kindergarten<br/>
and then next year--it&#39;s home.  I realize I&#39;ll then have to deschool her.  The thing<br/>
that bugs me about this kindergarten is *everything* is rewarded--usually with<br/>
candy.  It&#39;s not enough to do a good job in and of itself.<br/>
<br/>
What does dh think?  Well since he refuses to read/listen to tapes on anything<br/>
related to school/homeschool (he says he doesn&#39;t have time)  he has left the<br/>
nitty-gritty details up to me.  I thank him for this because I&#39;m the one who has<br/>
lived/done all the research and continue to do so.  He is annoyed that we keep<br/>
&quot;changing our minds&quot; and fear that the kids will learn to be quitters.  I don&#39;t see<br/>
us as quitters.  We try something, if it doesn&#39;t work we give ourselves *permission*<br/>
to try another option.  That is not quitting in my book.<br/>
<br/>
And of course, this has not come without a lot of stress!  In fact I&#39;m sitting here<br/>
typing this at 5:30 am after having been roaming the house since 2:30 am unable to<br/>
sleep.  Can I stop being an adult now?  :-)<br/>

Have you read &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot;.  It details how rewards destroy inherent, internal<br/>
motivation.  Couldn&#39;t you arrange play dates for your little one instead of<br/>
kindergarten?  Or maybe you could give a copy of &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; to the<br/>
kindergarten teacher. Hope springs eternal.  I am glad that you aren&#39;t afraid to change<br/>
your mind.  I hope your husband continues to at least stay out of the way and doesn&#39;t<br/>
panic.  Unschooling is not an experiment really.<br/>

    Oh Suzy don&#39;t feel alone! You have just wrote our school history.I can&#39;t <br/>
believe someone else has taken this crooked path. I want to stay where we are <br/>
now, hsing.<br/>
I understand everything you said, the doubts, fear. Wow! My dh is a bit more <br/>
anti hsing though he is coming along because in his heart he knows we have <br/>
found nothing better and that what he wishes were out there is merely an <br/>
illusion.One that is soon snapped once we enter it.Whew, enough said.<br/>

    I still laugh when I think of 8yro in Kindergarten. It was a private <br/>
kindergarten which as the yr progressed I referred to as college prep <br/>
kindgrtn. They where using a 1-2 grade curriculum. In October, the teacher <br/>
called me in for a conference and suggested I hold my son back the following <br/>
yr for another yr of kndgtn. In October?<br/>
I had already held him back a yr. They also suggested a tutor for the summer. <br/>
These people were dead serious. <br/>
    Anyway the teacher had cards they had to flip when they were bad. They <br/>
went from green, to yellow, to red. My son always ended up on red. The <br/>
infractions were so petty. Son figured out he couldn&#39;t care less. &quot;All they <br/>
give you when your good is some plastic junk&quot; he told me. There were kids <br/>
however that were devastated by red. I felt sorry for them. I also got angry <br/>
because while on field trips I got the message from the kids that they all <br/>
thought my son was a bad kid. Because of this teachers stupid punishment my <br/>
little guy was being unfairly labeled, as where a few others. <br/>
Sorry I did not mean to go on so, guess it all still makes me mad. I did <br/>
stand up to this woman and tell her I did not agree with her at all. I had <br/>
grown children so I knew that what they were all uptight over would pass.<br/>

    Did your kids ever feel as though they weren&#39;t doing anything? When I try <br/>
to give mine the space they complain they aren&#39;t learning anything. Read that <br/>
&quot;You aren&#39;t directing what we do. I am still working around a fence sitter <br/>

<br/>
I can identify with the wishy-washy thing.  I tend to be someone that <br/>
always wants to analyze all sides to make my decision and I end up <br/>
being indecisive.  Still,  after reading about unschooling,  I realized <br/>
that it would only work if I had faith in my children&#39;s abilities to <br/>
learn in this way.  So,  no matter how stressed and confused I was <br/>
feeling,  I worked really hard at walking the walk and talking the <br/>
talk - and you know what,  before I could convince myself,  my <br/>
children convinced me.  Now it&#39;s out of my hands.  My youngest is 13 <br/>
- this is his 4th year out of school.  He elected to try 7th grade <br/>
last year because he was curious about changing classes etc.  He <br/>
stayed for one quarter and that was it.  He always has the choice.  <br/>
Our agreement is that he can choose to return to ps and come home <br/>
whenever he wants,  but once he&#39;s home that&#39;s where he stays for the <br/>
year.  Of course,  he says he&#39;s never going back.  I remember <br/>
thinking that if unschooling wasn&#39;t a good fit for us,  we&#39;d switch <br/>
gears for high school.  Well.........like I said it&#39;s out of my hands <br/>
now.  He BELIEVES  and that&#39;s what&#39;s important.  <br/>
<br/>
I think your boys have come home at a good time - before the *joys* <br/>
of middle school.  Some people will disagree with me,  but I believe <br/>
that my kids deserve the choice and I let them make it.  Your kids <br/>
have been in school, they even experienced different schools.  They <br/>
have a lot of knowledge about both sides of the fence.  I&#39;ll bet <br/>
they&#39;re more than capable of leading their education.  Don&#39;t forget, <br/>
though,  they may need some major deschooling time.  Enjoy them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551351616">I had to add to this, last week, at a home-ed group meeting, a newbie came<br/>
with her grandson, diagnosed ADHD, on Ritalin, (btw, any info on dietary<br/>
control would be very welcome, it&#39;s been on here before, I think but I&#39;m on<br/>
digest so I can&#39;t find it.)  She was telling us about the &#39;discipline&#39;<br/>
system in the &#39;good&#39; school (with strong Church of England ties, not that<br/>
that has any bearing really,) he was at.  The children were made to wear<br/>
yellow and then red bands.  This child now has a complex about yellow.  The<br/>
system has since been scrapped, and replaced with a card scheme, where the<br/>
child is given a yellow card for an infringement, and a red card for a<br/>
second, when they have to leave the playground (this is at breaktime)  This<br/>
means that the children have to carry the card around with them while they<br/>
are playing, and there is probably a penalty for losing the card.  Do these<br/>
people have ANY idea what this did to this child?  Not a clue.  And would<br/>
they accept that he had any problem, no, he was a naughty child.  Did the<br/>
recommendations of a psychologist get followed?  Did they heck!!!  And folk<br/>
ask me why I don&#39;t want my kids in the system!!  ARRGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!<br/>

I went through the same thing with my son while he was in Kdg. They often <br/>
made him sit in the principal&#39;s office, in the corner, during recess. When I <br/>
explained that it only made his behavior worse because it took away the main <br/>
outlet for expending energy, they laughed at me! And he had gotten rowdy <br/>
during lunch so often (probably from those lost recess times) that they sat <br/>
him at the &quot;Trouble Table&quot; permanently everyday!!! So, I don&#39;t feel they <br/>
think what the reprocussions are over the long-term, they just want immediate <br/>
peace in the class. Something the principal of my son&#39;s school told me, &quot;This <br/>
teacher can only handle one problem student in her class of 30 and she <br/>
already has one...&quot;<br/>

    We have done the same. Through trial and error we have found one great <br/>
art class. We have tried and left several others. I used to worry about this <br/>
until I thought about it. When my kids were in school they had to take a <br/>
class whether they benefited from it or not, that&#39;s just the way it was. <br/>
Since I&#39;m usually paying for it I&#39;m going to make sure they like the class <br/>
and that it&#39;s quality. That&#39;s my prerogative now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What a breath of fresh air from the way I was raised.  I too believe that<br/>
your children&#39;s enjoyment should be of paramount concern when choosing<br/>
classes and activities and deciding whether or not to continue with them.<br/>
When I was a very small child my mother started me in ballet classes, even<br/>
though I had expressed no interest in them, was not a dancer and adamantly<br/>
resisted going.  She finally gave up after a few weeks of my resistance,<br/>
but as a parent it blows my mind that she could be so calously insensitive<br/>
to my feelings, which I made abundantly clear.  She thought that because my<br/>
older sisters (my father&#39;s ex-wife&#39;s girls) all attended ballet when they<br/>
were little, that I should too.  I believe now that it had a lot to do with<br/>
her efforts to &quot;look good&quot; in comparison to this first wife.  It never<br/>
ceases to amaze me how selfishly motivated my mother can be, even when<br/>
doing something &quot;for&quot; her children.  The sadest and most amazing thing<br/>
about her attitude to me is how very common it is.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, I have always had an image of myself as a quitter, not least<br/>
because me parents were always telling me what a failure I was.  They often<br/>
tried to force me to do things, either initiating activities or trying to<br/>
force me to finish.  They never succeeded.  Not even once.  Thank the<br/>
Goddess that I had such a strong self preservation instinct, as my husband<br/>
is amazed that I emerged from that family as intact as I am.  I simply<br/>
refused to be forced or coerced into doing something I did not want to.<br/>
They might succeed in getting me started with the proper threats, etc, but<br/>
I would not finish, which they would then use as an illustration of how I<br/>
never finished anything.  I think it makes much more sense towards a<br/>
person&#39;s emotional health to teach them that it is OK to not do something<br/>
anymore if it is not good for them, or they do not enjoy it.  There are so<br/>
many people in this world who do not give themselves permission to stop<br/>
doing things that are causing problems in their life.  <br/>

<br/>
Oh, Suzy.  I was so glad to read your post.  I&#39;m pretty much a lurker on this <br/>
and other unschooling lists, but I had to chime in here.<br/>
<br/>
Your life seems to have many parallels to mine.  I have six children: four of <br/>
them boys, and two close to ages of yours.  We, too, as a family, converted <br/>
to Catholicism five years ago.  My children, too, spent a semester at a <br/>
parochial school and I ended up taking them out.  I also had a Kindergarten <br/>
student at the time who loved it, but we chose to take him out too, probably <br/>
more out of convenience than anything else.<br/>
<br/>
I have AGONIZED over my choices again and again.  I love the philosophy of <br/>
unschooling, and yet I have never been truly able to &quot;let go&quot; with my kids <br/>
the way I want to.  Sometimes I think it&#39;s just having so many children and <br/>
so much going on at one time that makes it hard.  But, I know it&#39;s also my <br/>
own &quot;institutionalization.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On another unschooling list recently, someone expressed impatience for people <br/>
who seem to have h/s&#39;ed for a long time, but still can&#39;t make up their minds <br/>
about which way to go.  It wasn&#39;t directed at me, but it made me feel <br/>
terrible, because I fall into that category.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like indecisiveness, but I agree with you, that sometimes we have to <br/>
try out different options in order to be stronger about what we do <br/>
believe...to add definition.  I know that after my children&#39;s experience in <br/>
parochial school, I was much stronger about my homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there.  Maybe we can support each other through doubts, rather than <br/>
try to label each other by the actions that are taken...<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I know that after my children&#39;s experience in <br/>
 parochial school, I was much stronger about my homeschooling. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I feel even stronger after the conversation I overheard at a science <br/>
store I was at.<br/>
The other two ladies in the store shopping were middle school teachers (I <br/>
heard them tell the clerk this) They were talking about how excited another <br/>
teacher had been at the beginning of the year. &quot;not since she&#39;s seen what we <br/>
get, None of these kids are ready to do anything&quot; They went on about kids not <br/>
ready to change classes, too big classes and general remarks. When they were <br/>
checking out they asked what kind of credentials they might need to work at <br/>
this store. They both made it clear that they wanted out of the classroom. <br/>
Several times. I left the store so content, if the teachers don&#39;t want to be <br/>
there why should my kids?<br/>
