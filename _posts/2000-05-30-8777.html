<div id="ygrps-yiv-532624074">I was at the library today and the children&#39;s<br/>
librarian suggested...&quot;The House With a Clock in its<br/>
Walls&quot; by John Bellairs.... &quot;Half Magic&quot; by (last<br/>
name) Eager (only a guess on the spelling).... &quot;Tom&#39;s<br/>
Midnight Garden&quot; by Pearce  Also she ask being that<br/>
the Harry Potter characters parents die violently how<br/>
your daughter handled this? Did you read to her and<br/>
leave this part out? Because she told me of the book<br/>
&quot;A Winkle In Time&quot; which was the first book she<br/>
recommended but she did mention the dad disappearing<br/>
(but he does come back!) Thats when she asked about<br/>
the parents in Harry Potter and how you handled that.<br/>
She said if your DD read HP she should like and enjoy<br/>
&quot;a Wrinkle in Time&quot;  Did you ever read &quot;a Walk in Wolf<br/>
Wood&quot;?<br/>
Good luck and Happy Reading!<br/>
