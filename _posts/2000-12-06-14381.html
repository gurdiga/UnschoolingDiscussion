<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469648024">So, here&#39;s the news.  The education establishment has managed to produce<br/>
yet another test -- the third time running -- which shows their own<br/>
illiteracy -- the &quot;Third International Math and Science Study&quot;.  (I<br/>
detailed how they did this similarly on the tenth grade one in my book.)<br/>
TIMSSonly had the most highly paid experts from virtually every major<br/>
university in the United States working on it and reviewing the<br/>
questions, and to prove their own illiteracy, they used the following<br/>
question in the samples for all the world to see:<br/>
<br/>
4. Math/Geometry<br/>
<br/>
     In a quadrilateral, each of the two angles has a measure of 115<br/>
degrees. If the<br/>
     measure of a third angle is 70 degrees, what is the measure of the<br/>
remaining angle?<br/>
<br/>
     (A) 60 degrees<br/>
<br/>
     (B) 70 degrees<br/>
<br/>
     (C) 130 degrees<br/>
<br/>
     (D) 140 degrees<br/>
<br/>
     (E) None of the above<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s wrong with this question, folks? How many 8th graders read the<br/>
first sentence and were informed clearly, as part of the question, that<br/>
a quadrilateral has only two angles? (&quot;each of the two angles&quot;). And so<br/>
that third angle has nothing to do with the quadrilateral?<br/>
<br/>
And so how many put &quot;E&quot; as an answer&quot;?  Is it any wonder that only 19%<br/>
of U.S. students answered it correctly, but 40% of international<br/>
students (who probably had the question translated properly) got it<br/>
right?  But what is totally amazing, is our &#39;education experts&#39; chose<br/>
this question as the one they want all the world to see!<br/>
<br/>
Put three questions like that on an 80-question test, and all the<br/>
results are invalidated. They&#39;ve already given us one....<br/>
<br/>
David<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  How many of you would rather live in Slovenia, where 8th graders<br/>
do rather better on a test like this?<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; P.S.  How many of you would rather live in Slovenia, where 8th graders<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I hear Ljubljana is lovely. It&#39;s been relatively peaceful in<br/>
Slovenia in the last decade or so, lots of skiing, spas, tourists, cultural<br/>
festivals...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m not sure I understood the intention behind this question. I<br/>
might be reading too much into it, but I think most people prefer to live in<br/>
the culture of their upbringing because that is where they are most<br/>
comfortable, not because there is something inherently superior about that<br/>
particular place. (After all, familiar injustices are harder to see, and<br/>
easier to tolerate, than unfamiliar ones). There are probably few or no<br/>
Slovenes on this list, so naturally hardly anyone will say they&#39;d rather<br/>
live in Slovenia. But I think this says more about the make-up of this list<br/>
than about the quality of life in Slovenia or the relative value of<br/>
Slovenian culture. If you were referring to the atrocities in Yugoslavia in<br/>
recent times, exceptional circumstances can bring people to decide that<br/>
emigrating seems like a better option than staying where they are. However,<br/>
the amount of gut-wrenching pain involved in uprooting yourself and your<br/>
children in this way cannot be underestimated. I know a number of Serbs,<br/>
Croats and Bosnian Muslims who have fled abroad. Their hearts ache for their<br/>
homelands, and I know where they would rather be living.<br/>
<br/>
On a semi-tangent, after regular public school turned out to be disastrous<br/>
for my sister, she spent some time unschooling, and then went to live in<br/>
Skopje, FYRO Macedonia as a Rotary International exchange student during the<br/>
equivalent of 11th grade. The number one question she got when she told<br/>
people (she was in the US at the time) where she was going was &quot;WHY?!&quot; No,<br/>
actually that was the number two question, after &quot;WHERE?!&quot; She fell in love<br/>
with Macedonia in particular and the Balkans in general to the point where<br/>
she&#39;s now doing an undergrad degree in Serbo-Croatian (the University of<br/>
London doesn&#39;t have a Macedonian program, but the languages are similar). So<br/>
now she again faces the question &quot;WHY?!&quot; along with &quot;What are you going to<br/>
do with that?&quot;, which both she and I object to on many levels. I&#39;m not<br/>
surprised at all that she has chosen this path. The Balkans are easy to fall<br/>
in love with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858175885">David<br/>
Thanks for clarifying.  My immediate response when I read this was to reply<br/>
&quot;Who cares how well they do on a test?&quot;  but being new I didn&#39;t know how it<br/>
would be taken.  Probably an reaction to which I have been conditioned by<br/>
years of schooling and a mother who repeated often &quot;It&#39;s better to keep your<br/>
mouth closed and be thought a fool, than to open your mouth and be proven<br/>
one.&quot; :-(<br/>
<br/>
Peace Julie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147535626">Thanks for clarifying! I&#39;m glad I asked. And the answer to your question is<br/>
no, absolutely not. All these tests tell us is how good a certain group of<br/>
people are at taking these tests.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to hear you love Slovenia. I spent a wonderful summer in Zagreb<br/>
years ago, but haven&#39;t made it to Slovenia... yet.<br/>
