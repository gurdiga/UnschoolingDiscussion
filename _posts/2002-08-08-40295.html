&quot;The *real* trick is learning when to stick something out and when to cut<br/>
your losses. To learn to assess when something is providing less than what<br/>
it&#39;s taking.<br/>
<br/>
Is a few swimming lessons worth the price your son is paying in feeling he<br/>
is being held prisoner by money, you, the teacher, society&#39;s thoughts of him<br/>
as a quitter?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m coming out of lurkdom to respond to this. My son Eric has been learning <br/>
to play the violin the past year. This was his own choice after watching the <br/>
movie &quot;Music of the Heart&quot; with Meryl Streep. He loved playing. Recently he <br/>
has decided that he needs to take a break from weekly structured lessons. He <br/>
said that he feels now that he&#39;s only practicing for the instructor&#39;s sake <br/>
and not his own. <br/>
       <br/>
I e-mailed the concerns to his instructor. Though understanding of his <br/>
decision, she really wants him to &quot;work through this low time and make it <br/>
through his first book to get his reward&quot;. She doesn&#39;t think that he&#39;ll <br/>
practice in the interim if he is not having lessons. Eric read the e-mail <br/>
response and wants to stick with his decision to stop lessons. He said that <br/>
he doesn&#39;t play to get ribbons for completing something. He also wants to <br/>
work on the songs that he&#39;s already learned to perfect them and not add more <br/>
just to complete a book.<br/>
<br/>
I had just read Joyce&#39;s response above before I opened his instructors <br/>
response. I agree. What good does sticking with something do if you&#39;re not <br/>
doing it for yourself? I told Eric that it was his decision. You should have <br/>
seen his face knowing that I trusted him to decide. It was worth the chance <br/>
that his instructor may not have a place for him when he&#39;s ready to resume <br/>
lessons (if that happens at all). <br/>
<br/>
Sandra, you&#39;re so right. This is a trust with my son that I could never buy <br/>
back if I had forced him to continue lessons just to say that he&#39;d stuck with <br/>
something. I am generally a person that likes to stick with something until <br/>
completion, but I&#39;ve also learned when to bow out. I also don&#39;t want my <br/>
children to quit whenever something gets a little difficult. I think that&#39;s <br/>
why many people adopt the stick with it mentality. It&#39;s a hard decision to <br/>
make, but a decision that has to be made individually. Hopefully my son will <br/>
learn when to perservere and when to quit. Thank you all for discussing the <br/>
downside to that attitude. I see both viewpoints. <br/>
<br/>
Even though I lurk, I get so much from reading the discussions. Thanks for <br/>
the support.<br/>

Holly went through that, and her old teacher didn&#39;t have time or space for <br/>
her when she got in the mood again, but he recommended another teacher and <br/>
Holly LOVES the new teacher!  It was much better in the longrun.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I also don&#39;t want my <br/>
children to quit whenever something gets a little difficult. I think that&#39;s <br/>
why many people adopt the stick with it mentality. It&#39;s a hard decision to <br/>
make, but a decision that has to be made individually.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think at least ten percent of the time Holly is supposed to go to <br/>
something, a rehearsal or lesson or playgroup or something, she goes through <br/>
a period of whining that she doesn&#39;t want to, and she&#39;s not in the mood, and <br/>
it wasn&#39;t that fun last time, and about 90 percent of THOSE times, she perks <br/>
up in the last half hour and starts pressuring me to help her get ready!!<br/>
<br/>
Knowing it&#39;s her decision is the only way it can actually BE her decision.<br/>
<br/>
So she almost always decides to go, and it probably is a good release of fear <br/>
and tension for her to sometimes go through the inventory of the reasons <br/>
against going.  She gets that all out of her system, and sometimes I say <br/>
&quot;Well, could you do this?&quot; or &quot;Who would be the most unhappy if you don&#39;t <br/>
show up?&quot; or something semi-practical &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my kids do that, sometimes I just say, &quot;Oh - do you really NOT want to <br/>
go?&quot; Then they say, sometimes STILL whiningly, &quot;Yeees, I gueeeesss so.....&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
So I suppose they want to vent a little and they&#39;re trying, themselves, to <br/>
figure it out. OR - like me often, they just want to BE there, they don&#39;t <br/>
want to make the effort to get up and get dressed and go in the car, etc.<br/>
