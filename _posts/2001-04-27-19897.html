 </span></blockquote>Hi Sandra, and everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that someone posted a mention to the hobo,<br/>
and that was what I was going to do.  We live smack<br/>
dab in heavy hobo country.  They are not webspinners,<br/>
but nomads, hence the name.  They are also<br/>
opportunistic hunters, and very agressive.  I have<br/>
seen them chase my kids, or my nieces, clear across a<br/>
room at top speed until the kids hopped onto a piece<br/>
of furniture or the hobo got squished by an adult,<br/>
whichever came first.  <br/>
<br/>
Hobo&#39;s are LARGE, some of the largest spiders I have<br/>
ever seen (barring tarantulas that is) and I have<br/>
squished ones as big around as a fifty cent piece<br/>
(from leg tip tp leg tip.)  That is not all leg<br/>
either, but mostly heavy body.  A plus side to that<br/>
though, is that their bodies are so heavy that they do<br/>
not climb well, and you will most often find them on<br/>
the floor or on a lower part of a wall.  I am not<br/>
friendly to spiders roaming my house, particularly<br/>
aggressive, poisonous ones.  So hobos do not get a<br/>
chance to find another home if I happen upon them in<br/>
my house.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned something useful though.  The best<br/>
deterrent to hobos is other spiders.  I think they eat<br/>
the hobos while they are still little, as well as<br/>
dirve them out of their hunting areas.  The first year<br/>
we had this house was our worst hobo year EVER.  The<br/>
previous owners had sprayed for bugs in the yard every<br/>
year.  The second year we did not spray and there were<br/>
noticably less hobos around.  The third year we saw<br/>
maybe 2 dozen in the house throughout the summer and<br/>
fall, and last year that was halved.  I don&#39;t think we<br/>
will be around long enough this year before we sell<br/>
the house to get a good idea of how many we do or do<br/>
not have, since we are selling the house.  But this<br/>
method of hobo control has to be practiced by someone<br/>
comfortable with plenty of harmless spiders about in<br/>
the yard and garden, and periodic cobweb cleanings on<br/>
the outside of the house.  Spiders love this desert<br/>
climate.<br/>
