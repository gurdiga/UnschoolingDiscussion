<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I really think &quot;pride&quot; has an ownership sense to it, at least as most <br/>

glory.&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that &quot;I&#39;m proud of you&quot; falls under the same oddity as &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot;. <br/>
Even though you had NOTHING to do with why the person is hurt or in trouble or <br/>
whatever. It&#39;s more of------ empathy for the other person. <br/>
<br/>
I tell my boys that I&#39;m proud of them often (although not always with the <br/>
words &quot;I&#39;m proud of you&quot;---but they hear that too). When they have succeeded in a <br/>
certain area, I&#39;m JUST as happy as they are (maybe MORE!). When they&#39;re hurt <br/>
or struggling, I&#39;m also just as apt to say that I&#39;m sorry (although I had <br/>
NOTHING to do with the pain).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t associate bad things with pride. Many people think it&#39;s a sin to be <br/>
&quot;proud&quot;. I think you *should* be proud of your accomplishments. But to also <br/>
know when and where you could&#39;ve done better.<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of it has to do with your own childhood. My mother&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m proud <br/>
of you&quot; has a negative connotation to me. My dad&#39;s is ALL positive. I&#39;ve <br/>
never felt that I was a reflection of HIM---but my mother is ALL about <br/>
appearances, so it made me queasy--knowing that it was about HER and what others think of <br/>
HER. (Is that why I&#39;m such a bitch? &lt;BWG&gt;) <br/>
<br/>
I hope my boys know that it&#39;s about THEM, not ME.<br/>

<br/>
How the words &quot;I&#39;m proud of you&quot; sound are about the relationship with that<br/>
person, that&#39;s what I think anyway.  When I tell Lanora that she &quot;makes me<br/>
proud&quot;, it&#39;s about who she is, all of her.  I think she&#39;s an exceptional<br/>
person and she knows that, so my words convey my general admiration.<br/>
When my parents said they were proud of me it meant the same thing, it<br/>
always made me feel good.  They would never say they were ashamed of me<br/>
either.<br/>
