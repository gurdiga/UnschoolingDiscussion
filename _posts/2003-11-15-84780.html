<br/>
Julian and I went out today and got him a desperately needed haircut, and he <br/>
always looks older after that. (For those of you who don&#39;t know Julian, he&#39;s <br/>
14 and has very curly, fuzzy hair that gets long) Then we went over to Old <br/>
Navy. They had a decent price on some coats, and he needs one.<br/>
<br/>
He ended up buying a black pea coat. First item of clothing he&#39;s been excited <br/>
about since he was pretty little and we got him a cool tee shirt with an <br/>
animal on it. <br/>
<br/>
He looked at himself in the mirror with the haircut and the coat, and he just <br/>
glowed. He was gorgeous. (I&#39;ll see if he&#39;ll let me get a picture tomorrow.) <br/>
And he looked so old and mature and beautiful. Wow...  Not much time left with <br/>
this little project.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Please don&#39;t panic. I really don&#39;t see my son as a little project. He&#39;s <br/>
really a pretty big project, that&#39;s taken a lot of time and money.<br/>
<br/>
P.P.S No, of course, he&#39;s not a project at all. He&#39;s a person in his own <br/>
right, worthy of respect and dignity, and of course I take all this very seriously.<br/>
<br/>
P.P.P.S. All that said, this same kid was on my lap yesterday. <br/>
<br/>
P.P.P.P.S. As projects go, this one really has worked out quite well. He does <br/>
chores around the house with very little nagging<br/>

<br/>
Your Julian sounds wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
It is funny you posted this.  Dh and I were talking about it tonight.  We<br/>
had had a full day and driven half an hour to go pick up Zach at a friend&#39;s<br/>
and went to dinner after.  On the way home, the little kids were just too,<br/>
too tired, fussing and whining in the car.  Everybody was glad when we<br/>
finally got home.<br/>
<br/>
Adriane (12) wa the last one out of the car.  I was there with her and saw<br/>
her reach back into the car and pack up various shoes, socks and jackets the<br/>
little kids had discarded on the drive home.  I offered to take the stuff<br/>
but she said &quot;that&#39;s alright.  I got it.&quot; and went on in the house.<br/>
<br/>
She didn&#39;t think twice about it but she seemed so maternal to me at that<br/>
moment that I may never forget it.<br/>

lol <br/>

He&#39;s only nine, I know, but he&#39;s shutting his door,<br/>
now. ( WTF is he doing in there?)   His feet are<br/>
almost as big as his father&#39;s.  ( I am not kidding!) <br/>
<br/>
I am feeling like I&#39;ve completely wasted all nine<br/>
years and have to cram things in from now on....but I<br/>
won&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
He came in last nite and snuggled with me before I<br/>
went to sleep.  He rolled over and I couldn&#39;t breathe<br/>
for a sec, had to push him offa me enough to tell him!<br/>
We laughed but I told him he has to remember he&#39;s<br/>
getting stronger than me! * oh crap * And I can still<br/>
so clearly remember him fitting  *perfectly* next to<br/>
me as I nursed him, like it was yesterday.....*sigh* <br/>
<br/>
And is it worse because we have only children? <br/>

I think that&#39;s a big deal. There&#39;s no one, even for a year or two, after him. <br/>
Beth&#39;s inclination is to start taking in dozens of foster kids after he <br/>
leaves. LOL  Julian, on the other hand, matter-of-factly says he may be living in <br/>
the basement for a long, long time if the music career is slow to take off.<br/>

I chose to have one child, and now I&#39;m stuck with my<br/>
decision.  Hubby&#39;s had the pipeline snipped.  Most of<br/>
the time I&#39;m fine with that, but sometimes......<br/>
<br/>
I had thought that we would adopt or become foster<br/>
parents by now, but money and space has made me think<br/>
twice. ( and thrice).<br/>
<br/>
 I do love to help friends and family with their very<br/>
young ones, and that makes me feel better. <br/>
