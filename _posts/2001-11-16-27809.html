To only choose things that are not mainstream so they themselves will then be <br/>
kewl?<br/>

Kirby&#39;s been at this karate school, which was chosen after calling and <br/>
researching the parent schools to find one that was more involved with <br/>
philosophy and culture and health than with tournaments (they do none) and <br/>
quick advancement.  He started at nine (somewhat late for that school) and is <br/>
still there at 15.  The two teens who outranked him have left for <br/>
extracurricular school stuff now, and he&#39;s the ranking kid.  The school <br/>
doesn&#39;t allow black belts before the age of 18, but he cares nothing for <br/>
that, because a large part of their training is personal best and team <br/>
effort, respect for the tradition, and not advancement or glory.<br/>
<br/>
For those who know about such things, it&#39;s Shorin-Ryu, and Ed Erler is the <br/>
Sensei.  Kirby has participated in some of the regional seminars they sponsor <br/>
with visiting teachers.  In those he&#39;s usually been the youngest.<br/>
<br/>
He went because he wants to.  He stays because he wants to.  How faddish is <br/>
that?<br/>
