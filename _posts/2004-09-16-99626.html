1) Maybe some of you in that area would be interested<br/>
2) Maybe this is an indicator of what some of the recent undercurrent of <br/>
unhappiness with unschoolers/unschooling as a separate-from-homeschooling <br/>
thing <br/>
could be related to, for some people.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Who is Michael Farris and why is he so scary? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Conservative Christian-Homeschooling activist in or around Virginia, studied <br/>
law but not practicing (last I heard, which was a while back and could be no <br/>
longer true), draws a huge salary from HSLDA which many homeschooling families <br/>
send $100 or whatever it is now every year out of fear.  The fear is created <br/>
from within HSLDA, mostly.  He is alleged to intend to run for some big public <br/>
office (or has?) and is in the middle of a conservative movement that pushes <br/>
Christian-Homeschoolers (not people who homeschool who happen to be Christian, <br/>
but those who are part of the same big movemet he is) to train for public <br/>
office.   The boys, not the girls, of course.<br/>
<br/>
When seen from a distance that movement is WAY more about politics than about <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not the only one, but he has a recognizeable and out-there name so he <br/>
gets blamed for or takes credit for lots of it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s off the top of my head.  If you went to google.com and looked him up <br/>
there would be more.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about unschooling, but it is about the why of unschooling sometimes <br/>
being so profoundly separate from what some others consider &quot;home schooling.&quot;<br/>

He has run for office in recent years -- I think gov or lt. gov?  It was during the mid-90&#39;s when I lived in the DC area. He&#39;s a fundamentalist christian homeschooler with, I think, nine kids (at last count) and a very conservative Republican.  Even for Virginians, this guy is ultra-conservative (and that&#39;s saying a lot in my experience with VA in my 13 yrs there).<br/>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah, the fear.  I was at my first local homeschooling meeting <br/>
of the year yesterday.  There was a new family there that just <br/>
pulled their pre-teens out of school.  One of the mom&#39;s said, &quot;Oh, <br/>
don&#39;t forget to sign up for HSLDA.  Better to be safe than sorry.&quot;  <br/>
Then all the other mom&#39;s nodded their heads in agreement with her.  <br/>
I said, &quot;I just keep the phone number of a few umbrella schools on <br/>
hand.  If the school dept ever gave me a hard time, I&#39;d just join <br/>
one of them and be considered a private schooler.&quot;  I got the &quot;your <br/>
putting your life in jeopardy!&quot; looks.  O, well.<br/>
