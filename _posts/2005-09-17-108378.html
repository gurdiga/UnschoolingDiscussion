 </span></blockquote>If there&#39;s nothing formal there, make sure that both parties (your son <br/>
and the &#39;employer&#39;) spell out clearly the responsibilities, time <br/>
commitments, pay (if any), and so on. We have several interns where I <br/>
work and it&#39;s semi-formal - they have to interview; they have to keep <br/>
a timesheet to turn in so they can get paid, they don&#39;t get paid for <br/>
days off/sick time, they DO need to call in if they won&#39;t be in, they <br/>
have to keep to a reasonably regular schedule (one person is only in <br/>
on Weds and Friday because his college classes are Mon, Tues, Thurs; <br/>
another is in every day but works 3 pm to 6 pm - in both cases they <br/>
are limited to 20 hrs maximum per week unless there is special <br/>
approval for additional hours). Also, our interns (who are college <br/>
students) are required to (a) be taking at least part time hours (b) <br/>
keep their GPA up to C or better - if they don&#39;t enroll for classes or <br/>
their GPA drops, their manager will discuss their future employment <br/>
with them. They have to abide by the rest of company policy as far as <br/>
attire, behavior, etc. (for example, it&#39;s a no-smoking environment so <br/>
no smoking on the premises).<br/>
<br/>
Making sure everything is spelled out clearly and agreed to by both <br/>
parties is a way to help keep things from going awry.<br/>

What is the industry?<br/>
<br/>
My general advice about interning is that if you are going to sweep<br/>
someone&#39;s floors for free, you might as well sweep Steven Spielberg&#39;s rather<br/>
than Joe Blogg&#39;s producing his graduate thesis film (unless Joe is your best<br/>
buddy since childhood - think Ben and Matt - and even then Joe should be<br/>
happy for you if you get a shot at Spielberg&#39;s broom.)<br/>
<br/>
In other words, choose the largest or most prestigious company in the field<br/>
of interest that is available to you. The level of the network you are in<br/>
can help you (or hinder you) later.<br/>
