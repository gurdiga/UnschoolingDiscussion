Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] experience, experts, ownership and road trip<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; There were so many posts that I wanted to respond to. But alas there must<br/>
&gt; of been a reason the power went out twice and I lost the snippets. With<br/>
&gt; no time to go back through the massive amount of mail to find them<br/>
&gt; (again).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bridget&#39;s explanation of experience reminded me of when I was hiring a<br/>
&gt; pressman. Not an easy task at a time when unemployment was low. A very<br/>
&gt; wise person said to me &quot;Make sure they have experience. I mean 15 years<br/>
&gt; of experience, not 1 year of experience 15 times over.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If all your children fall easily into unschooling, are very adaptive and<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s no neurological damage going on.. then you&#39;re going to have very<br/>
&gt; little rocks in the road with unschooling. It becomes a challange when<br/>
&gt; you hit bumps outside the norm. Or when you take on another child that<br/>
&gt; you didn&#39;t raise and have to deschool them, or *gasp* they are damaged<br/>
&gt; beyond repair and now you still need to fit that into a lifestyle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Experience comes in many shapes and forms. And what about the ones that<br/>
&gt; are born into it.. are they more experienced? Or the ones that it comes<br/>
&gt; natural and they didn&#39;t have to awaken to it? There was no &#39;aha&#39; it just<br/>
&gt; always was and anything outside of it seems strange...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Like I said.. many shapes and forms... I&#39;m not going to judge who&#39;s is<br/>
&gt; worth more in anyone elses eyes but my own. Which leads to experts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Even experts with degress might not be considered experts by others at<br/>
&gt; all. If you show me your chiropractic expert, I&#39;m going to ask if he is<br/>
&gt; Grostic. If not, he&#39;s no expert to me. In my eyes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We all pick our experts that belong to our belief system. In the realm of<br/>
&gt; unschooling, I would choose my father for a start.. then think about<br/>
&gt; Holt.. then maybe jump over to Lynda because she sums things up in a way<br/>
&gt; that I can relate to instantly. I haven&#39;t read enough of anyone elses<br/>
&gt; information to determine if they are my experts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Without a bonafide expert. Nor any officially recognized movement, then<br/>
&gt; unschooling doesn&#39;t have an owner per se. It has advocates. Some of them<br/>
&gt; vehemently disagree on certain points. Somehow, there is a commonality<br/>
&gt; amongst them, even if the devil is in the details.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With all these advocates, who then has the right, the power, the<br/>
&gt; ownership to determine what fits into this term and what doesn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Should we use your expert? or my expert? (blanket question, not directed<br/>
&gt; at anyone)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; NY Times, Washington Post, Globe and Mail.. I haven&#39;t seen any<br/>
&gt; proclamations that there is a unified group of the unschoolers and they<br/>
&gt; have chosen a leader and defined the term. So we&#39;re back to square one.<br/>
&gt; No nationally recognized experts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And for that, I&#39;m glad. I remember learning how the AMA established<br/>
&gt; itself in courts as the medical experts. So anything alternative isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; viable. I would hate to see the same of something so organic as<br/>
&gt; unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There might be factions or groups that look to certain experts. But they<br/>
&gt; are congregating in specific places. A group here, a group there. Nothing<br/>
&gt; on a nationally established level. So there is no ownership of the word.<br/>
&gt; Or a movement en masse that says this is how it has to be if you want to<br/>
&gt; be an unschooler.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Therefore, nobody has the right to proclaim it as this or that, and you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t belong unless you follow what my group has established.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lets find the commonalities, like &#39;the child&#39;s agenda&#39;, and after that...<br/>
&gt; maybe it can grow into something beyond this website, that conference,<br/>
&gt; this publication etc. Who know?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Off on a road trip, just me and the kid. I even went as far to get myself<br/>
&gt; one of those brain-scrambling cell phones for emergencies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Going offmail for a bit.. I&#39;ll drop in if I get near a computer... enjoy<br/>
&gt; the discussion.<br/>
