<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000981965">Hey gang,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for changing the subject line.  I have been lurking, like <br/>
usual and it definitely caught my eye. If Sandra had not mentioned <br/>
it, I would not have remember it&#39;s been a year ---AND WHAT A YEAR! <br/>
One of the tidbits of information that did not make it to the article <br/>
was my goal for this first year --to explore NYC and to start out <br/>
from the tallest point in the city. We were going to the trade that <br/>
Wednesday. The rest is history.<br/>
<br/>
I still have to take the kids there. I am so spaced out I was going <br/>
to take them today to a park that is just a few blocks away but I <br/>
decided against it. Mark left for Vienna for Ars Electronica (a huge <br/>
convention for Internet developers and artists) and I would not want <br/>
to remind Evan of what he witnessed a year ago. He still has vivid <br/>
images of it even as I have made sure that he does not watch any <br/>
news. I do not want to make him worried sick about his father and <br/>
yet, I am ---the people at Ars do not have yet a return ticket for <br/>
Mark because they are waiting to see what is going to happen after <br/>
the 11th :-( These are very trying times.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, today all his friends are in school. We declined his <br/>
admittance to a magnet school here in NYC because, after a year, this <br/>
is what makes sense. We are actually getting ready to go to the <br/>
American Museum of National History. He&#39;s been obsessed with volcanos <br/>
and wants to see what the museum has about them. Also, they are doing <br/>
renovations on our building&#39;s roof and we happen to live on the top <br/>
floor. For the next month and a half we have to spend most of our <br/>
days out of this place if we do not want to be jackhammered to <br/>
deafness.<br/>
<br/>
So is the life and yet, as Mary (zenmomma) says, life is good.<br/>
<br/>
Write to y&#39;all soon,<br/>
Liza</div>
