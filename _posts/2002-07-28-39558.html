<div id="ygrps-yiv-465657321">I know its the hardest thing for a parent to wait, but I never had a choice.  <br/>
I have a strong-willed child, and that is one of his strongest assets.  To <br/>
interfere with his will to survive and to excell was going to bring about <br/>
failure.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been waiting and waiting and waiting.  Sure, he could read some <br/>
things, and always asked about words.  This was of course when no one could <br/>
hear it, as it was beyond the point of being socially acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
But when it comes to common sense and practicalities -- especially now when <br/>
he can read a lot more than before -- he is ahead of the others.  He comes <br/>
out with, &quot;Mom, can&#39;t you read the directions?&quot; or &quot;Didn&#39;t you see what the <br/>
sign said, 30 mph&quot;.  It&#39;s just that, rather than fooling around with nonsense <br/>
for years in school, he has just been dealing with what&#39;s important and what <br/>
keeps his interest.<br/>
<br/>
He was stunned this year when I asked him to describe what he had done <br/>
yesterday on paper.  After he finished writing it (it was all phonetically <br/>
correct but dictionarily there were some errors), he was stunned that I could <br/>
read every word of it.  He wanted it corrected.<br/>
<br/>
I encourage you mothers to just let go, and let them develop.  Especially the <br/>
boys.  They are so busy!!!<br/>
<br/>
I should add that we have had to &quot;fake it&quot; lots of times --- with relatives <br/>
and school authorities.  That is why I would rather remain anonymous, as we <br/>
still have a lot of stuff to get through until he is 18.<br/>
<br/>
We live in the West.  Are very involved with ski racing, motorcross, BMX, RC <br/>
cars and airplanes.  He has ski racing and bike racing sponsors who pay for <br/>
almost all of his costs.  My son works at construction making $10 per hour in <br/>
the summer.  He is a happy, well-balanced person.  Has tons of friends.  <br/>
People stop by our house because of all the activity.  He loves to do stuff <br/>
on the internet.  Helps repair other people&#39;s computers.  Loves landscaping. <br/>
<br/>
This fall we set up snowmaking in our yard with garden hoses, and then made <br/>
jumps from a ramp off of the roof.  Then we looked up on the internet and <br/>
found a fantastic site about snowmaking and physics.  His comment:  &quot;If I had <br/>
only known this years ago.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Believe me!!!  I have gone through all the fears.  Unschooling really <br/>
works!!!<br/>
<br/>
