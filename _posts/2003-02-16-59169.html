<div id="ygrps-yiv-251685434">Came across this the other evening at bedtime.  From the book of poems Sing a <br/>
Song of Popcorn:<br/>
<br/>
My Favorite Word<br/>
<br/>
There is one word--<br/>
My favorite--<br/>
The very, very best.<br/>
It isn&#39;t No or Maybe.<br/>
It&#39;s Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, YES!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes, yes, you may,&quot; and<br/>
&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; and<br/>
&quot;Yes, please help yourself.&quot;<br/>
And when I want a piece of cake,<br/>
&quot;Why, yes.  It&#39;s on the shelf.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some candy?  &quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
A cookie?  &quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
A movie?  &quot;Yes, we&#39;ll go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I love it when they say my word:<br/>
Yes, Yes, YES!  (Not No)<br/>

How cool!  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I checked the dollar movie listings and the Harry Potter movie was <br/>
there!  Holly and I agreed to go see it again when it was a dollar.<br/>
<br/>
We had company coming over to play cards, so we decided to wait for 6:30.  <br/>
Holly fell in the yard and was muddy and upset and so wanted to take a bath, <br/>
and didn&#39;t want to hurry.  So we cancelled 6:30 and considered 10:00, but <br/>
it&#39;s a long movie and we&#39;d&#39;ve been out until afte 1:00 and nobody else is <br/>
home.  So we decided to wait for Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday at 3:00 was our Harry Potter plan.   Holly got a call from friends, <br/>
wanting her to come play.  She asked if we could see Harry Potter Monday <br/>
instead.  Sure!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So just like with those other things we&#39;ve been talking about loosening up <br/>
on, if a child is confident and free and lacking desperation, even &quot;yes let&#39;s <br/>
go to the movie&quot; can be put off for other things with peaceful calmness and <br/>
lots of love!<br/>
