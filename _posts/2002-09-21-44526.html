<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319445418">&lt;&lt;feeding 4 curious minds at once.....Do lots of you unschool more than<br/>
2-3?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have 5 children under the age of 12.  I think a very important<br/>
distinction is that the kids unschool themselves and I basically try to<br/>
remove obstacles from their paths.  Those obstacles are usually me, sadly<br/>
enough.  Me wishing the house was cleaner, wanting to be &quot;in control&quot;,<br/>
slipping back into &quot;school mindset&quot;.  But it is getting easier and easier to<br/>
stay in a joyful place with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that I am often surprised at what the kids have figured out<br/>
without me even being aware of it.  Like today, Marsie, 5, was showing me<br/>
how she can do Reader Rabbit.  I have never &quot;worked with her on&quot; letters and<br/>
their sounds, just simply answered her questions about them as they were<br/>
asked.  I didn&#39;t know that she knew the lower case letters at all until this<br/>
morning.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling with several small children makes for lots of chaos, but lots of<br/>
laughs as well.  Example of today: Got up early and dh and kids helped load<br/>
a goat and 2 dogs up to go to the vet.  Came home and dh and Zach (9) went<br/>
to the batting cages.  Zach talked quite a bit about the differences<br/>
involved in batting at different speeds.  Marsie (5), Danny (3) and Michelle<br/>
(3) watched &quot;Monsters, Inc&quot; and had lunch.  I went to the library and picked<br/>
up Adriane (11) from a slumber party.  Zach and dh worked in the yard with<br/>
Zach mowing independently on the riding mower.  The three little guys made<br/>
mud pies and Adriane watched CMT, asking lots of questions about Waylon<br/>
Jennings.  I went to the grocery store and they were all swimming when I got<br/>
back.  Danny came to help carry groceries.  Marsie showed her Dad and I how<br/>
far she had got on Reader Rabbit.  All the males worked to fix the grill and<br/>
we cooked hamburgers.  Dh and Zach changed a tire.  The little kids went<br/>
swinging and playing on the huge dirt pile while Zach used a stick to gather<br/>
pecans from our tree.  Adriane, Zach and I went to milk the goats.  We did<br/>
the math and figured Zach&#39;s goat was big enough to breed so we put her in<br/>
with the male.  Adriane figured out how much milk she got in pounds for her<br/>
4-H records.  The kids fed their rabbits and dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Chaotic and busy, but also fun and very &quot;educational&quot;<br/>
