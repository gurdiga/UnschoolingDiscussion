<div id="ygrps-yiv-523698635">Sylvia Boorstein&#39;s _It&#39;s Easier Than You Think-The Buddhist way to<br/>
Happiness_ is one of all my all time favorites.  Also,  _Wherever You Go,<br/>
There You Are_ by Jon Kabat-Zinn.<br/>
<br/>
I have a question about something I read about right speech, but<br/>
unfortunately I don&#39;t remember who wrote it.  Hopefully someone might be<br/>
familiar with it.  I read an article that said before speaking you should<br/>
ask yourself four questions about what you are going to say.  &quot;Is it true?<br/>
Is it kind?  Is it neccessary?&quot;  But I can&#39;t remember the fourth question!<br/>
Anyone?<br/>

Is it true?<br/>

Is it necessary?<br/>
Can you remember it?<br/>
<br/>
No, that&#39;s not right...<br/>

I can&#39;t remember and went looking and didn&#39;t find it, but found some good <br/>
stories at <br/>

 There&#39;s a story of a Sufi master, a healer.   He goes into this household <br/>
one day where there&#39;s a sick child, and there are people gathered around.   <br/>
He goes over and he passes his hand over the child and he says some sacred <br/>
words, a kind of prayer, and he says, &quot;Now you will be healed.&quot;   The parents <br/>
are very grateful, but a really disbelieving and somewhat aggressive man <br/>
says, &quot;How can you heal a child just by saying some words, all this healing <br/>
and this spiritual junk&quot;?   The master turns to him and looks him in the eye <br/>
and says, &quot;What do you know of this?   You are an absolute fool.   You know <br/>
nothing!&quot;   He says this in front of all the other people.   The guy becomes <br/>
enraged and he turns red and he is shaking with anger.   And the master says, <br/>
&quot;Wait a minute, sir.   If a word of mine has the power to make you turn red <br/>
and shake with anger, why should not a word also have the power to heal?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There are two principles to Right Speech, to this foundation of speech as <br/>
the first aspect of uprightness of heart.   The first is that our words be <br/>
true.   Truth is so sweet.   If you know anyone who really speaks honestly <br/>
and truthfully, admittedly sometimes they&#39;re a pain in the ass, but mostly <br/>
one&#39;s sense of that person is a delight, that here&#39;s somebody I can go and <br/>
speak to or listen to and hear that which is true.   It&#39;s just wonderful. <br/>
<br/>
 There&#39;s a story of Mullah Nasrudin, the old wise man and fool, this kind of <br/>
strange character.   He puts up his booth.   It&#39;s sort of like Lucy in <br/>
&quot;Peanuts.&quot;   It says, &quot;Psychiatric Assistance&quot; or &quot;Psychological Counseling <br/>
-- two questions,&quot; or something like that, only instead of five cents it&#39;s <br/>
five old dinars.   It&#39;s really a lot of money.   People think, &quot;Gosh, he must <br/>
be very, very good to charge so much money.&quot;   So one person goes up to him, <br/>
and takes out five old dinars and puts it on the counter.   He says to <br/>
Nasrudin, &quot;Isn&#39;t that an awful lot to charge for just two questions?&quot;   <br/>
Nasrudin looks back and says, &quot;Yes, it is; and what&#39;s your second question?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 Two principles:   First, that the words are true for Right Speech; and <br/>
second, that they&#39;re kind or helpful, because it&#39;s possible to say what&#39;s <br/>
true and not have it be helpful at all, what one might call &quot;brutal <br/>
honesty&quot;.   &quot;I&#39;ll tell you just what I think, whether it&#39;s helpful or not.&quot;   <br/>
The second principle is that speech be helpful, not only that it be true, but <br/>
also that it speak in some way that&#39;s compassionate or kind or useful to <br/>
someone.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018356923">This might remind you.  It&#39;s not the same &quot;set.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot; The Buddha says we should start by refraining from telling lies. After <br/>
that, we should speak the truth, speak gently and politely and speak at the <br/>
right time. He says: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Giving up false speech he becomes a speaker of truth, reliable, trustworthy, <br/>
dependable, he does not deceive the world. Giving up malicious speech he does <br/>
not repeat there what he has heard here no does he repeat here what he has <br/>
heard there in order to cause variance between people. He reconciles those <br/>
who are divided and brings closer together those who are already friends. <br/>
Harmony is his joy, harmony is his delight, harmony is his love; it is the <br/>
motive of his speech. Giving up harsh speech his speech is blameless, <br/>
pleasing to the ear, agreeable, going to the heart, urbane, liked by most. <br/>
Giving up idle chatter he speaks at the right time, what is correct, to the <br/>
point, about Dhamma and about discipline. He speaks words worth being <br/>
treasured up, seasonable, reasonable, well defined and to the point.&quot; <br/>
