&lt;&lt; No, I am not suggesting that all parents must do one thing or another, <br/>
especially that there is no choice but to have a child in school if they <br/>
work.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are always other options. What do you do with your child in the summer <br/>
when he&#39;s out of school? One may have to be very creative to make it work, <br/>
but there are always options.<br/>
If you think school is a good place for your child to be, you won&#39;t fit in <br/>
here well at all.<br/>
If you&#39;re interested in changing how you think, getting ideas on how to make <br/>
it work and how to get school out of your lives, this will be a great list <br/>
for you.<br/>

&lt;&lt; There are actually lots of working parents here. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes. I&#39;m another one of them. My dh and I run a home business that is our <br/>
main income, and I work part time out of the home.<br/>
