<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230460370">YAY!!! <br/>
 <br/>
I was talking to Paul and he said to take what we&#39;ll need out of our tax return to set aside so that Sarah and I can attend and stay at the hotel and everything, and he&#39;ll plan on taking leave if he has to so that he can be home those days!!! <br/>
 <br/>
I told him that not only would it be beneficial to our educational lives, but to Sarah and I personally to have a serious &quot;Mommy-Daughter&quot; experience! <br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s ALL for it! YAY!!! Oh I am SOOOO excited!!<br/>

Everything I need to know, I learned on my own!<br/>

If he went too, he would meet dads, and see older kids...<br/>
