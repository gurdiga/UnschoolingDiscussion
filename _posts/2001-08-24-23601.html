&lt;&lt; But I was talking with the older boy ( ten<br/>
 ) and he&#39;s worried about going back to school.  He hates it, he knows the<br/>
 teachers think he&#39;s stupid .  It breaks my heart to know he has to go. <br/>
 What&#39;s going to happen to him? <br/>
 I&#39;m not at all happy school is starting again.<br/>

around 4th grade when they had charts w/ Gold stars and I couldn&#39;t get one in <br/>
math and was reminded daily. Also being very good at reading I was tolds to <br/>
be quiet and let other kids try since they knew I already understood the <br/>
reading. UCK! I hate school.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Hey mom 6% of $1.00 is $.06. So if I want to buy a Lego set for $10.00 I <br/>
will need $.60 more for tax. Now I only have $8.75 leftover from my allowance <br/>
so I will need $1.85 more. Since grandma will pay me $.50 per day to take out <br/>
her trash I&#39;ll have enough saved up by Tuesday. Will you take me to Toys-R-Us <br/>
on Tuesday?&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    WOW! I can only do percentages by first doing 10% then adding by 10s or <br/>
5s. As in this shirt is 25%off. I do 10%first then double it then add half of <br/>
the 10% to make 25%. Geez. But it gets me through nearly everything I need <br/>
to. (I always tip 20% and round up). :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096302103">To be honest this was just an example. We started homeschooling after both had been taught, rather painfully, how to do these calculations by the pen and paper method.  <br/>
