<br/>
We too don&#39;t use babysitters, in fact my children aged 7.5 and 3.5 have only<br/>
been left about 3 times by my close and loving mother and that was only a<br/>
few months ago!!  Our 11mth old has obviously never been away from side  :o)<br/>
<br/>
I too don&#39;t even want to think about either of my 3 children saying they are<br/>
ready for their own bed, space becomes a factor with children e.s.p a big<br/>
ole 7 yr old, but we now have two beds joined together and i just love<br/>
having them with us!!<br/>
<br/>
T.V, well I myself really enjoy some programmes and we are on and off it all<br/>
the time since being given one.  I too, don&#39;t think they are nessercarily<br/>
&quot;evil&quot; but i do believe they aren&#39;t good!!  We don&#39;t watch much and I intend<br/>
to keep it that way  :o)<br/>
