I dont agree with every thing you said in your post - but I do agree <br/>
with most of it.<br/>
Living in the country areas yoou seem to be able to live your life as <br/>
you want to.(within reason of course) The towns and citys you are <br/>
dictated by to many things - too much rush and bustle - nobody seems <br/>
to have TIME - <br/>
Once a mother always a mother - I have 4 grown children - one has <br/>
children of his own. I dont see a great deal of them - but i do have <br/>
contact with them - and Yes I do still worry about them.<br/>
I havent had a mother since I was 9yrs old - my father brought me and <br/>
my 2 sisters up - he was a great dad and did a marvelous job - But I <br/>
missed not having a mother - and i think this helped to make me a <br/>
better mother to my own children.  I have only Toni at home now.  And <br/>
I am enjoying her very much.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry you lost your mother so young. I did also (at 12)...but I wonder<br/>
if it&#39;s made me a better mother, a worse mother, or if it really made any<br/>
difference at all?  I know it made me more fearless in doing things on my<br/>
own, but that&#39;s the only good quality that comes to mind. I still miss her<br/>
over 20 years later.<br/>
