<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451602361">Hi, everybody --<br/>
<br/>
My husband has been offered a teaching job in Vallejo, CA, so it looks<br/>
like we will be moving to that area in about a month.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know any unschoolers or semi-unschoolers that live any where<br/>
near there?<br/>
<br/>
I have some lovely homeschooling friends down here in San Jose and I am<br/>
going to miss seeing them regularly.<br/>

and that&#39;s more like half an hour. Or you can come up to our farm :-)<br/>
