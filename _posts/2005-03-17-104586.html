<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274095054">**The problem with &quot;choosing&quot; school, even part time, is that the school <br/>
itself is an <br/>
<br/>
environment that is highly coercive and demeaning to learners. So you &quot;pay a <br/>
price&quot; for <br/>
<br/>
that kind of &quot;teaching&quot; whereas in other places we&#39;ve taken lessons (like <br/>
acting school, sax lessons, learning to shoot rifles, vintage dance) we have not <br/>
felt that same kind of coercive and condescending context that overbears, like <br/>
it does in the public school.**<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you don&#39;t even have to enroll in school part time to be exposed to <br/>
the negative context. When Patrick was eight he joined a wrestling team <br/>
through our park district, for kids ages 5 to 12. It met in the high school <br/>
wrestling room in the evening. One night while we were there the assistant principal <br/>
of the high school came in and searched all the student&#39;s wrestling bags, <br/>
announcing before hand &quot;If you have anything in your bag you shouldn&#39;t have, let us <br/>
know before we search.&quot; Several of the boys announced they had candy in their <br/>
bags, causing the principal to laugh, as she didn&#39;t think of candy as <br/>
contraband, although the coach did. It was clear to the kids that they either <br/>
consented to the search or they&#39;d be unable to remain on the team because they would <br/>
no longer be allowed in the high school. None of the adults sitting around the <br/>
room had their possesions searched, and nothing was searched but the <br/>
wrestling bags. The reason given for the search was &quot;fairness&quot;, because the high <br/>
school had recently instituted bag searches at the entrances during the day for <br/>
students. Patrick and I had several long talks about this afterward, why the <br/>
school didn&#39;t trust kids, the pointlessness of the wrestling bag search, how since <br/>
the students know what will be searched in the mornings it&#39;s unlikely to keep <br/>
anything out, why they didn&#39;t search the adults possesions, and probably a <br/>
lot more that I&#39;ve forgotten. We&#39;ve also had to deal with the &quot;no hats&quot; rule  <br/>
and sometimes other parts of a very convoluted dress code.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t have made school look that bad if I&#39;d tried. It is apalling to my <br/>
kids just how badly kids are often treated in the schools that are supposedly <br/>
there for their benefit.<br/>
