<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379293128">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I have to put my two cents in here.  First off my kids are little so I have no experience in hsing.  We have recently decided that this is the best decision for our kids.  Someone said that unschooling starts from birth, I truly believe that based on what I have did with my kids since they were born.  Unschooling will be an extension of what I already do.<br/>
<br/>
Now to deal with the family....<br/>
<br/>
My Mom was very pro about the idea at first with all the shootings in schools.  Her comment was I&#39;ll even buy the books.  My Dad said not to isolate the kids because of some whackos.  I am the type of person who likes to tell everyone about something cool I am doing or planning to do.  If I put a voice to my idea, it becomes easier.  This method has been very helpful with my business as well.  I am proud and excited that we have decided to hs our kids.  From reading everyone&#39;s input on this and various other lists, I feel empowered by all of your experiences and confident that I can do this.  <br/>
<br/>
Back to my Mom, now that it is a serious plan in action, she has given me the socialization lecture.  I just want to scream.  My school life was far from social for various reasons.  All I know is I only had one true friend during my whole schooling experience.  The only parties I got invited to were the ones that the whole class was invite regardless and I made alot of friends in the area when my parents were driving us to school as we did not have busses.<br/>
<br/>
My brother thinks it&#39;s great as long as I stick to it.  Stick to it??  This isn&#39;t a new diet I am trying, this is my children&#39;s lives were are talking about here!!   <br/>
<br/>
My daughter just turned 2.  In just 2 weeks my whole perspective has changed about our lives.  Thank God for hsing and unschooling!!  I can go on from here feeling good that I am picking the right course for our lives and that my kids are not in danger of having the same sort of childhood I had.  I know that there will be tough days, but are there always.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that my point is that we all are making the best decisions for our families and we will always know that in the end.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to unload, but I had to add my voice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037732365">Just had to respond to the socialization issue that a few people have<br/>
commented on. I have a wonderful paper here called &quot;Ten Reasons Not to<br/>
Homeschool.&quot; It&#39;s written tongue in cheek and number 3 is socialization.<br/>
Let me share.<br/>
<br/>
Socialization: What possible better way could there be to give your<br/>
children the socail skills they will need as adults than to stick them<br/>
with children their own age all day. Besides, the best influence on your<br/>
child is the one randomly assigned to the seat behind him or her in home<br/>
room.<br/>
<br/>
Along those lines is number 5.<br/>
<br/>
Close Friendships: I like the fact that my children are spending so much<br/>
time with people not in their family. I would much rather my children&#39;s<br/>
closest friendships be outside the family rather than within. <br/>

I honestly don&#39;t know how I got this paper. If you would like I can send<br/>
it to you personally.<br/>
I&#39;m on a webtv but when Joe gets home later I&#39;ll have him scan and send<br/>
it to you.<br/>
As my son would say, &quot;How does that sound?&quot;<br/>

You go girl!  don&#39;t let anyone dissuade you from what you want to do for your <br/>
family.  socialization is the easiest thing in the world.  There are parent <br/>
support groups, church groups, sports clubs.  My boys play basketball and <br/>
soccer for the local optmist club.  They go to a music school where they have <br/>
private lessons as well as three band practices a week.  We just finished a 4 <br/>
day music festival where they competed against 3 other schools.  They have so <br/>
many friends and do so much that we never have a quiet time.  So..... there <br/>
are tons of stuff to do for social!  <br/>

&lt;&lt; Back to my Mom, now that it is a serious plan in action, she has given me <br/>

the ones that the whole class was invite regardless and I made alot of <br/>
friends in the area when my parents were driving us to school as we did not <br/>
have busses. &gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I was extremely shy in school and wouldn&#39;t talk. I too, had one friend.(BTW, <br/>
this &quot;one friend&quot;, lived right across the street from me and wasn&#39;t even in <br/>
my &quot;grade&quot;, so with or without school, she would have been my friend) I went <br/>
to p.s. for 13 years. Now, if the socialization of school is so wonderful, <br/>
you would think that I eventually would have made friends in school and <br/>
become &quot;less shy&quot; around people, right?<br/>
WRONG! If anything, it got lots worse. The other children started &quot;teasing&quot; <br/>
me about being shy, which made me even MORE shy. I was fine at home with my <br/>
siblings. I was very loud and outspoken. Also, I did things and went places <br/>
and had fun with my one friend. By the time I was in high school, I was <br/>
begging my mom to let me &quot;drop out&quot;. (The teasing gets alot more cruel in the <br/>
higher grades, folks).<br/>
By the time I was 16, I was suicidal and mom decided I needed a Psychiatrist. <br/>
Gee, it&#39;s funny how my life got better after I &quot;graduated&quot; and became an <br/>
adult. I&#39;m not shy anymore (although it took me a few years) and I talk to <br/>
people all the time now.<br/>
So, the question is: Did school teach me socialization? No, it almost killed <br/>
me. <br/>
The bottom line is: School hurts innocent children. Thirteen years of <br/>
&quot;socialization&quot; and only one friend and I almost killed myself in the <br/>
process...yeah, socialization is the greatest.<br/>
