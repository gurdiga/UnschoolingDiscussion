I&#39;ve  read mention of other unschooling forums(?)  (e-mail lists?) (not sure  <br/>
of proper terms!)  in people&#39;s posts here.  What other forums  have people <br/>
found helpful, and why?  How do they differ from this  list?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am on several, but due to not having enough time to read all of them  every <br/>
day, I&#39;m signed onto most of them by &#39;read only&#39; or &#39;digest&#39; versions and  <br/>
then read when I have free time.  <br/>
 <br/>
This is one of my favorites...plus I&#39;m always over to Sandra&#39;s personal  site <br/>
reading and re-reading her articles : )  But the 2 that I get the  mail via <br/>
individual posts and that I find are most helpful personally to  me, are Always <br/>
Unschooled (Danielle & Robin&#39;s list) and Shine With  Unschooling (Anne <br/>
Ohman&#39;s list).  <br/>
 <br/>
Always Unschooled is a very gentle list with lots of &#39;warm&#39; regular posters  <br/>
- I&#39;ve had real breakthroughs reading the wonderful posts on that list!!!   <br/>
There are a handful of women on that list who have REALLY made a positive impact <br/>
 on my life w/their observations and insights.  Always Unschooled has  lots <br/>
of threads that pertain specifically to younger children, or so it  seems.  <br/>
 <br/>
The Shine list is specifically for unschooling &#39;non-typical&#39; children (  <br/>
highly sensitive children, explosive, Aspergers,  ADD, &#39;spirited&#39; are some  of the <br/>
examples Anne lists on the list description, I think) and is so wonderful  f<br/>
or celebrating our kids and helping them SHINE.<br/>
 <br/>
They&#39;re both yahoo groups.<br/>
