<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314079178">Hi Jodye;<br/>
<br/>
Ohhhhh, I do love pregnancy, labour, birthing and baby stories.  No, you<br/>
did not go on, I was totally absorbed with your story/situation. <br/>
Congratulations to you for being such a fully-participatory Mom, that<br/>
you researched shoulder dystocia.  I had never heard of it.  Now I know,<br/>
so thanks for the service you&#39;ve provided.  It is amazing how vulnerable<br/>
we are in the hospital/doctor scenario.  We are, after all, on their<br/>
turf.  Have you tried chiropractic care at all?  I can&#39;t say I&#39;m a huge<br/>
fan (yet) of chiropractors, but I do know a female chiropractor who does<br/>
do adjustments on infants.  Apparently, it&#39;s a little known fact a lot<br/>
of infants are born out of alignment and it does affect feeding on one<br/>
side.  I trust this woman&#39;s knowledge as she has done research and<br/>
specializes in women and infant care...I&#39;ve even figured what the heck,<br/>
I&#39;ll give this stuff a try, and so far so good.  (I&#39;m not sure if this<br/>
is helpful for you as you&#39;ve said it&#39;s a nerve-thing, but who knows.  It<br/>
might be worth considering.)<br/>
<br/>
By the way, at the risk of flogging a dead horse, (I really hate that<br/>
term, but am too unimaginative to come up with something better!) I&#39;d<br/>
really like to take this opportunity to clarify my stance regarding the<br/>
breastfeeding issue.  I feel like I&#39;ve been raked over the burning hot<br/>
coals needlessly as I&#39;ve been grossly misunderstood...Granted, I do feel<br/>
very strongly about the issue, (like that wasn&#39;t obvious!) and I do<br/>
believe in people informing themselves and getting the facts concerning<br/>
ALL parenting issues, (I think we owe our kids that committment to<br/>
knowledge, from birth), however, I am also an intelligent realist who<br/>
fully recognizes the extenuating circumstances that may exist our lives.<br/>
As a matter of fact, I had HORRIBLE challenges and problems with<br/>
breastfeeding my first-born.  He was &quot;this close&quot; to being bottle-fed<br/>
himself.  I was lacking in information though and thankfully found a<br/>
phenomenal nurse who was able to get me on a different track and it made<br/>
all the difference.  During pregnancy, I was prepared to breastfeed but<br/>
got so easily off-track thanks to hospital policy and &quot;well-meaning&quot;<br/>
in-laws etc...So I just wanted to encourage those who do not have<br/>
physical handicaps, serious illnesses, abusive husbands, etc. that<br/>
so-called &quot;inconveniences&quot;, challenges and other stresses can be<br/>
overcome most of the time, if we just dig deep enough to get the<br/>
available help.  <br/>
<br/>
So I apologize at this time, to those I offended unwittingly, who<br/>
suffered those exceptional and rare circumstances and were unable to<br/>
breastfeed.  Of course there is need for bottle-feeding in the minority<br/>
of situations.  Just like a medication, formula is a pharmaceutical. <br/>
And I&#39;m happy it has been available for those who truly need it.  It was<br/>
not my desire to &quot;Judge&quot; bottle-feeding parents (which I don&#39;t), I did<br/>
not insult those who bottlefeed, nor would I ever confront anyone who<br/>
has made that decision.  I have had many friends/acquaintances over the<br/>
years who have bottlefed and I have had complete respect for them as<br/>
parents and have never embarrassed myself or them in that way.<br/>
<br/>
So I am hoping I am forgiven, as I&#39;m in a continual quest for knowledge<br/>
like we all are,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I definitely learned the hard way on this one.  I can&#39;t blame the doctor<br/>
&gt; entirely for my decision not to breastfeed.  Afterall, I like to think I&#39;m a<br/>
&gt; fairly intelligent person - I could have looked for answers elsewhere.  Maybe<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t care enough about breastfeeding at the time to make the effort - I<br/>
&gt; really can&#39;t remember the circumstances exactly.  I do know that I was most<br/>
&gt; certainly too trusting of doctors.  That was ten years ago, and I&#39;m sorry to<br/>
&gt; say that I remained too trusting until 14 months ago when my youngest child<br/>
&gt; was born.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   My first daughter was delivered by c-section 12 years ago.  I wanted to<br/>
&gt; have the next one vaginally, so I chose a doctor who would be open to that<br/>
&gt; when I became pregnant with my second child.  The delivery went okay - major<br/>
&gt; tearing, but my son was a healthy 8 1/2 pounder.  The next baby was also born<br/>
&gt; vaginally.  That delivery didn&#39;t go so well - my daughter was stuck (shoulder<br/>
&gt; dystocia) although I didn&#39;t know it at the time.  Actually, I didn&#39;t know it<br/>
&gt; until almost five years later when my youngest was born.  Luckily, the doctor<br/>
&gt; was able to turn her and she was delivered healthy, weighing 8lbs 6oz.  Major<br/>
&gt; tearing again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My fourth child was born exactly 14 months ago tomorrow.  My pregnancy with<br/>
&gt; her was pretty uneventful - I did gain a lot of weight, but the all knowing<br/>
&gt; doctor never said anything about it, so I assumed it was no problem.  Two<br/>
&gt; days past my due date the doctor decided to induce labor.  He had induced the<br/>
&gt; last two because he didn&#39;t want the babies to get over 8 1/2 pounds - he<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t think I could deliver one any bigger.  He&#39;d already told me that the<br/>
&gt; baby I was carrying was in the 9 pound range, so things weren&#39;t adding up.<br/>
&gt; But I TRUSTED him, afterall he&#39;s the doctor.  My labor with the fourth one<br/>
&gt; seemed different from the start.  At one point I heard the nurse talking to<br/>
&gt; the doctor on the phone.  She told him that she thought he neede to come<br/>
&gt; right away.  But did he?  NO.  He came about 45 minutes or an hour later.<br/>
&gt; The nurse had just discovered that &quot;this baby&#39;s head is way bigger than I<br/>
&gt; thought&quot;.  But her head wasn&#39;t the worst part - it was her shoulders.<br/>
&gt; Shoulder dystocia again...only this time I don&#39;t remember him trying the<br/>
&gt; fancy turns or maneuveres.  She was STUCK!  So, the doctor put a nurse on<br/>
&gt; each side of me, to pull my legs as far back as they possibly could.  I had<br/>
&gt; two other nurses on top of me, pushing on my belly with all their might.  And<br/>
&gt; the doctor had the vacuum extractor hooked to my baby&#39;s head and was pulling<br/>
&gt; so hard that later my husband told me &quot; I thought he was going to pull her<br/>
&gt; damn head off&quot;!  He said it was the scariest thing he&#39;s ever seen.  Well, we<br/>
&gt; got the baby out.  She weighed 9 1/2 pounds.  She was a funny blue color, and<br/>
&gt; she didn&#39;t breathe for what seemed like forever.  I&#39;ll never forget the sound<br/>
&gt; of her first cry, or the tears of relief in my sweet husband&#39;s eyes, or her<br/>
&gt; wonderful new baby smell.  But somehow I failed to notice that her left arm<br/>
&gt; was hanging limp.  I didn&#39;t even realize it until late that night.  No one<br/>
&gt; told us she was hurt, and when we figured it out nobody would tell us what<br/>
&gt; the problem was. We didn&#39;t fully understand what had happened until we got<br/>
&gt; home and began our own research.  My daughter, Tess has a brachial plexus<br/>
&gt; injury.  Maybe some of you know what that is, but I had never heard of it<br/>
&gt; until she was born.  The brachial plexus is the bundle of nerves found in the<br/>
&gt; shoulder area. The nerves are the ones that control muscle function in the<br/>
&gt; arm.  The nerves that control Tess&#39;s bicep and deltoid muscles were torn.<br/>
&gt; The tricep nerve was also injured, but not as seriously.  There is a<br/>
&gt; wonderful clinic in Houston, Texas where they specialize in brachial plexus<br/>
&gt; injuries.  We&#39;ve traveled there several times, and she  had surgery at Texas<br/>
&gt; Children&#39;s Hospital last September to graft the torn nerves, using bits of<br/>
&gt; nerve taken from her leg.  We were told by her pediatrician that there is<br/>
&gt; nothing that can be done for nerve injuries.   We had to learn everything we<br/>
&gt; know about it on our own.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tess also has mild hypotonia (low muscle tone)  probably due do a slight lack<br/>
&gt; of oxygen, and hip dysplasia, which will hopefully be resolved soon.  My<br/>
&gt; daughter was perfectly healthy up until the moment she was born.  She was<br/>
&gt; PERFECT.  And now thanks to some know it all, egotistical, rushing to the<br/>
&gt; golf course doctor she&#39;s injured for life.  Oh, they can fix her up (or, so<br/>
&gt; they say)  but even with the best recovery, she&#39;ll never be the way she<br/>
&gt; should have been.  And here&#39;s the really sad part...it all could have been<br/>
&gt; prevented.  All the warning signs were there - previous shoulder dystocia,<br/>
&gt; large weight gain, big baby etc...  See why I&#39;ll never again take a doctor&#39;s<br/>
&gt; word on anything?  I&#39;ll question them every step of the way - it could be a<br/>
&gt; matter of life and death.  What a way to learn a lesson.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know I&#39;ve gone on way too long here, and for that I&#39;m very sorry.  I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; even sure if I made the point I set out to make - I got kind of side tracked.<br/>
&gt;  But it&#39;s late, and I&#39;m much too tired to change anything now.  Goodnight.<br/>
