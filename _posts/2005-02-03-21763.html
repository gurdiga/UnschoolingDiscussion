<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026378930">Hi, my name is Lilith, and i&#39;ve been unschooling for two and a half<br/>
years now with my oldest son, six. I&#39;m starting with my younger son,<br/>
now three. <br/>
Still have a lot of doubts and questions and i&#39;n glad i found this<br/>
group. One thing i&#39;m wondering off the bat is how do you reply to a<br/>
post and get your reply to post instead of going to the person&#39;s<br/>
email. I&#39;ve tried replying to two different posts and i don&#39;t see my<br/>
replys on the message board. I read the post and hit reply, what am i<br/>
doing wrong? Thanks for any advice, Lilith</div>

asked about)- New members to the list are automatically moderated <br/>

another of the list moderators, which can take a few minutes to a <br/>
few hours depending on whether any of us are on-line at the time :)<br/>
