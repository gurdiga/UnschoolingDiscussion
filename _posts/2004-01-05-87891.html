<br/>
Welllll...I was going to avoid this thread in fear of someone up North getting pissy with me, BUT I just got a new heat pump today and when I got home from work the AC was on! :) It&#39;s been warm and humid the last few days, especially the last two. Most of my friends at work have had the AC on. We just open the windows and enjoy nature.<br/>
The AC being on when I got home was just a test run since it was installed today. Now I have the ceiling fan on and the windows open...it&#39;s cooled quite a bit and it feels really refreshing.<br/>

I knew I should be careful about bragging. Just remember the unschoolers beach party in October &#39;05, I expect to see a lot of you Northerners down here!!<br/>

cold the snow squeaked when I walked on it.   Dylan found a House Finch<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bless you , Deb. The horses are frosty and fed, lots of oats, and the <br/>
chickens are in, the fire is going, and we are having a great freezing day. Two of <br/>
the school kids down the road came over for the aft as it is too cold for the <br/>
school buses to run out here from town!! The kids were thrilled and we played <br/>
x-box the whole time, I baked muffins, had my hair done by the little girl, read <br/>
life-learning and basically enjoyed myself. Funny, I thought of today as the <br/>
end of the holidays, but nothing is different in my house, except husband went <br/>
back to work tonight. We miss him but our joyful life is still here,  doing <br/>
what ever we wish. The neighbor kids are hoping for more cold tomorrow so they <br/>
can come back. <br/>
And I must add, that at -32C the nights are absolutely exquisite. The moon is <br/>
huge and bright, it gives &quot;a lustre of midday to objects below.&quot; EEWWW, I <br/>
seem to be overflowing with happiness today, must be this unschooling life, <br/>
either that or I doubled up on the progesterone cream&lt;G&gt;<br/>
Nancy in BC, would still like to be in a warm pool in Florida<br/>

  And that&#39;s going to be in February or March,  right? &lt;wink&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s when I really need a Florida trip. :)   <br/>
<br/>
  Oh and I should say we are learning all sorts of things about cold weather-- how quickly our nose hairs can freeze, how fast the dogs water dish freezes up(in the garage) and how much ice can accumulate in the corners of the windows (in the inside of the house).<br/>
<br/>
  Olga, doesn&#39;t that just make you jump at moving up here??? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Nah,  we really do love it up here, but we have to talk tough when it comes to cold weather.  Its in our blood. Our coooooooooooooollllllllldddddd blood.<br/>

See now I would be terrified I&#39;d dry up and blow away.  I grew up with blizzards and cold so I know how to deal with them.  If it&#39;s cold outside you put on more layers, if it&#39;s too warm you can&#39;t do anything about it but dampen down and get used to it.  Having my car break down in the desert would freak me out though.  I&#39;ve read enough to know to stay in the car and shade all the windows and some other things, but I don&#39;t have the life experience to go along with it(confidence.  I wouldn&#39;t mind living somewhere like BC on the coast or interior where it&#39;s a little more temperate but so do a few thousand other people so it&#39;s too crowded for me.  And dh doesn&#39;t have the contacts he has here and our family and so on and so on..<br/>
