<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236395465">I believe I&#39;m quoting Leslie Moyer below:  (if not I appologize, it&#39;s hard to cut and paste with yahoo mail!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Not that learning *can&#39;t* be fun....of course it can.....but some of the times <br/>
&gt;that I&#39;ve witnessed my kids taking the greatest strides in their learning <br/>
&gt;was when they were MAD or FRUSTRATED or PERPLEXED or BORED or EMBARRASSED.  <br/>
&gt;When the adult takes responsibility for &quot;making it fun&quot;, the child is<br/>
&gt;disenfranchised--their right to their own learning is usurped.  Then <br/>
&gt;the child&#39;s role in their education is once again relegated to the passive<br/>
&gt;role---&quot;entertain me&quot;/&quot;educate me&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;In the early part of this century, people spent FAR FAR less time in school <br/>
&gt;than kids do now and learned much more than we do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These 2 seperate thoughts caught my attention, because I&#39;ve been mauling (sp?) over both recently.  We have just recently started watching satelite tv.  I am appalled at how *stupid* everything has gotten over the last few years!  <br/>
<br/>
It seems that every program has to be *fun*, *exciting*, *mysterious*, or something.  Take Jepardy for instance.  The questions have gotten way easier and they&#39;ve added a &quot;clue crew&quot; to make the show more appealing???? When I turned it on the other night, a blond girl (no slight intended) comes on holding a yard sale sign and says something like &quot;tonight we&#39;re going to a yard sale!&quot; in her sweetest dumb blond voice (believe me I&#39;m trying to phrase this right because I&#39;m blond, but you know what I mean!)<br/>
<br/>
Then we try to watch documentaries on Discovery or TLC or whatever.  Most are alot of hype about nothing.  All designed to *entertain* us.  Is it not possible that some people out there are simply interested in things and like learning something new?  We watched a show about Neanderthals ( a family favorite in our house) with my 3 sons aged 5, 7 and 11.  They began talking about how the Neanderthals interbred with homeosapians (fasinating no?) Then the guy comes on and says &quot;SEX, they we&#39;re having SEX, yes SEX (emphais his not mine)!  Was that necessary to keep me watching?  <br/>
<br/>
I have commented to my husband that we keep getting dumber and dumber.  People knew way more about more in general before.  Now we have to change the questions on Jepardy, and make documentaries full of nothing.  Where will we be 50 years from now?<br/>
<br/>
Just recently, we purchased a new trivial pursuit game (first in about 8 years).  We couldn&#39;t believe how they dumbed down the questions there too!  <br/>
<br/>
Is the love of knowledge a dying thing?  How can we stop it&#39;s demise?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613774636">Ya know, I think (save the flames, it&#39;s an opinion &lt;g&gt;) that a lot of the<br/>
trouble with ps has to do with teachers, lack of common sense and how young<br/>
so many of them are.  They don&#39;t seem &quot;equipped&quot; to deal with a variety of<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Example, (I worked for 3 different school districts and hubby worked for yet<br/>
another so we have dozens of these experiences) a young teacher fresh out of<br/>
college is given a class of 8th graders.  In ps this is a very agressive<br/>
age.  This teacher (22) was tiny, &quot;cute&quot; and had a &quot;little&quot; voice.  She was<br/>
NOT an alpha person.  That class was a free for all and by the end of the<br/>
first quarter she was handing out cinch notices left and right and flunking<br/>
more than 75% of the class.  IMNSHO, *if* she as going to teach she should<br/>
have started out with K and then worked her way up if she wanted to teach<br/>
the older kids!<br/>
<br/>
Another teacher at this same school wanted to be &quot;one of the girls&quot; and be<br/>
&quot;friends&quot; with all the girls in her class.  When one of the girls didn&#39;t<br/>
want to be her friend or if one of the boys acted out, she would sit in the<br/>
teacher&#39;s lounge and cry!<br/>
<br/>
And then you have to figure in the fact that the majority of ps graduates<br/>
end up having to take remedial math and English classes.  How are they going<br/>
to teach that which they didn&#39;t grasp themselves to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
IF it should ever come to pass that I am forced to send the kidlets to ps,<br/>
then they will go to the local &quot;one room school house&quot; where my cousin sends<br/>
her daughter!  This woman rents a big 3 bedroom house and that is her<br/>
&quot;school house.&quot;  She has 20 students.  There are two teachers.  The kids<br/>
range in age from her 4 yo to 18.  Everything they do is either hands on or<br/>
very inventive.  For example, they studied the U.S. political system last<br/>
year.  Along with reading, they watched tons of videos, CNN, etc. and went<br/>
to school board meetings, city council meetings and board of supervisor<br/>
meetings. They went to town hall meetings and to political rallies.  They<br/>
also did a fundraiser and they all went to Washington, D.C.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-794539937">Hello, everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading some of the messages after having subscribed last week, <br/>
and think we are where we are supposed to be.  I may need someone to pint <br/>
me in the right direction, because I&#39;m a little overwhelmed.<br/>
<br/>
To make a long story short: intelligent, artistic daughter with a major <br/>
depressive order and some health issues who absolutely despises school.  We <br/>
homeschooled during the eight grade, which she loved, but her father wanted <br/>
her mainstreamed, again.  It has been 1disasterous year after another.  Not <br/>
only is she angry that she was forced to go to &quot;school,&quot; she refused to do <br/>
the work much of the time and has finally, joyfully, at age 16, officially <br/>
&quot;quit&quot; school.<br/>
<br/>
Not that I blame her.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even know what we need, to be honest.  I sense that I need to let <br/>
her just rest a little and heal...she&#39;s had a very bad month, health and <br/>
emotionally-wise.  She wishes to go to art school eventually, and in New <br/>
York State, where we are, if she is 50% deficient of her HS credits, she <br/>
qualifies to take the GED, but that won&#39;t be until next autumn, because <br/>
they are insisting she finish the school year, which she fixed by leaving <br/>
school altogether.  Also, here in New York, if one can get into the State <br/>
University system and earn 24 credit hours, NY state automatically grants a <br/>
GED.<br/>
<br/>
SATs are Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel that we should direct her education, especially now, with her <br/>
in this emotionally precarious position.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice or suggestions is much appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

I think you should follow your instincts because they are probably <br/>
the best guide right now.  Almost everybody who leaves school needs <br/>
that time to de-tox, so to speak, and she would be no exception. You <br/>
mentioned SAT&#39;s this Saturday. What&#39;s the rush? Can she not take a <br/>
year off to do nothing and then maybe by next year, she&#39;ll have a <br/>
clearer head and will do better at whatever it is she pursues?<br/>
<br/>
For now, though, I think just a path of &quot;pursue your own interest and <br/>
to heck with the rest&quot; is what the doctor would order.<br/>

<br/>
The rush is her father.  He&#39;s extremely unhappy with her leaving school and <br/>
he seems to be looking around frantically for someone to blame it on!  :)<br/>

Doing nothing is probably the best thing for her.<br/>

<br/>
You sure sound like you know what you and your daughter need right now. <br/>
Keep up the great work!<br/>
<br/>
Ignoring the lack of support won&#39;t be easy, but you certainly got the <br/>
right idea :-)<br/>
<br/>

Right now, it is more important that you help her learn to deal with <br/>
herself.  She needs to understand that she has a medical problem not <br/>
some &#39;failure&#39;.  That is often the hardest part of dealing with <br/>
depression - - those who unwittingly (or  intentionally) make you <br/>
feel that it is just a lack of willpower or drive.  It isn&#39;t.  <br/>
Recognizing it for what it is and learning to thrive with it (not in <br/>
spite of it) are important.  Your daughter may need your help, or she <br/>
may not.  But she needs to be in control of her life.  You have to <br/>
help her get there however you can.<br/>
<br/>
Is she on amy meds?  My 16, almost 17. yo dd is on Prozac.  It has <br/>
done amazing things but she still has a ways to go in recognizing <br/>

teachers are a problem so are the burnt out ones.  <br/>
But there are much deeper problems too.  The start with state school <br/>
boards who set curriculum (in stone) and include superintendents who <br/>
think they are gods, administrators who don&#39;t understand diversity <br/>
and its impact on education, an entire segment of society who buys <br/>
into the &quot;you must do this at this age, in this way&quot; philosophy, etc.<br/>
and you have the makings of something really bad.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Bridge,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for your input.<br/>
<br/>
She defiantly understands that it&#39;s a medical problem, she has no shame <br/>
over the situation and whenever someone tries to push her, she shuts down <br/>
and withdraws, so they learn FAST to let her be.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s making her own decisions, which I think is the best thing for her, at <br/>
this point.  She is on medication and seeing a psychiatrist, whom she <br/>
adores, an anger-management counselor and has been evaluated by a <br/>
psychologist, so things are definitely much more in hand than in September <br/>
when she had her big meltdown.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was school which brought it on.  Yes, she has a predisposition <br/>
for it, but...school, in my opinion, was the catalyst.  That and having a <br/>
*rilly* bad day, if you know what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s interested in taking an art class, which I mentioned (I hope, or I <br/>
really am forgetful) at the local community college.  Here&#39;s some <br/>
information that I hope will be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
For a non-matriculated student there is no age restriction for taking <br/>
college courses though the community colleges of the State University <br/>
system of New York!<br/>
<br/>
You can pay monthly.<br/>
<br/>
Even though the class is for Art majors &quot;only,&quot; they are looking for an <br/>
instructor who will agree to having her in their class (she plans to go to <br/>
Art School, eventually.)<br/>
<br/>
So, the system is very accommodating, as a whole.  Let&#39;s see if Friday <br/>
morning&#39;s art instructor is persnickety or not.<br/>
<br/>

nothing is very important in the grand scheme of life only what is <br/>
important to *her,*  so no problem, there.<br/>
<br/>
She seems eager to take the exam, so I think it just may be the &quot;game&quot; <br/>

that&#39;s for sure.<br/>
