<div id="ygrps-yiv-719988178">&quot;Sometimes it&#39;s hard to stand out from the crowd and be different. I <br/>
never<br/>
feel like I quite fit in with anyone&#39;s crowd. I&#39;m further different <br/>
from<br/>
most because I also homeschool and even UNschool, do not vaccinate, <br/>
had a<br/>
homebirth, and also try to practice natural medicine when at all <br/>
possible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After reading this (I knew these about you before, but it was good to <br/>
be reminded) I got all excited about meeting you at the conference <br/>
again!!<br/>
It is tiring to believe SO deeply in something and always have people <br/>
question you as though you were nuts.<br/>
I have exactly ONE friend at work that is accepting of my lifestyle. <br/>
The rest of them I&#39;m friendly with, but they think I&#39;m nuts.....<br/>
I have no desire to fit in with the sheep though.<br/>
<br/>
You are still coming to the SC conference Karin? I really, really <br/>
hope so...we have so much in common.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra was saying recently how it must be kinda nice to just believe <br/>
in the status quo and feel comfortable in yhour life rather than <br/>
questioning everything. I have also thought this.....dh and I talked <br/>
about it the other day.<br/>
How you could just be content with things the way they are, trust the <br/>
government, your preacher/religion and not always feel the need to <br/>
swim upstream. I said it might feel nice to be like that, but in the <br/>
end I wouldn&#39;t want to live a lie. And that&#39;s what it&#39;d be to me. A <br/>
big, fat LIE. I&#39;ll take the road less traveled anytime.<br/>
Joy and satisfaction have been found there, along with the inability <br/>
to be content with the status quo.<br/>
Onward fellow revolutionists!!<br/>
