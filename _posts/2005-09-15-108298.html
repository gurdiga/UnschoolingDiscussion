<div id="ygrps-yiv-827772376">I&#39;m convinced that kids (and some adults) can find a way to make fun <br/>
of any name, so while I certainly would not have saddled my kids with <br/>
a name like Harry Pecker, I declined to obsess over the &quot;what ifs&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I wish I had considered, but didn&#39;t, before naming my <br/>
daughter Meredith is that it is pretty much impossible for a young <br/>
child to pronounce. She has called herself either &quot;mer-dwif&quot; or &quot;mer-<br/>
dif&quot; all along. She&#39;s 4 now, and generally quite articulate. <br/>
Thankfully, it doesn&#39;t bother her that she can&#39;t say it the way we do <br/>
(that&#39;s the only reason I might have shied away from it). And, of <br/>
course, I think it&#39;s sweet and will miss hearing those &quot;mer-dwifs&quot; <br/>
someday.<br/>

don&#39;t think it mattered AT ALL what her parents even came up with at <br/>
that point.  eek.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>only somewhat related here, but interesting to me!  my husband&#39;s name is <br/>
seth.  he lived for a while during his youth in el paso, TX, which has a <br/>
large hispanic community.  lots of kids in his class couldn&#39;t say his <br/>
name at all<br/>
(we had this experience come up recently with a friend of mine&#39;s <br/>
panamanian husband) since they don&#39;t have the *th* sound in spanish.  he <br/>
would try to help them by explaining that it sounds like *thirsty* in <br/>
spanish *sed* or some-such, and that was close enough.  so he was called <br/>
thirsty. ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>mmhmm!  my daughter called her baby brother *some-bas-chun* instead of <br/>
sebastian for quite some time...way cute.  by the time he got around to <br/>
referring to himself, we&#39;d already shortened it to sebby, much easier to <br/>
say!  i kinda feel bad that he has such a long name to figure out, while <br/>
his big sis got 2 letters *eve*, and his baby sis 3 *lila*...lol.  which <br/>
then reminds me of a cute bit on sesame street with a whole bunch of <br/>
school kids singing a song about their names.  there&#39;s the typical <br/>
names, then last of all is this adorable boy, grinning so big and he <br/>
says, *thelonius!*  adorable. :)  i still smile when i think about that!<br/>
