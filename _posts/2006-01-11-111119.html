<div id="ygrps-yiv-479332807">&quot; and Gracie is watching the Disney<br/>
Channel while standing on her scooter taking a break from scootering<br/>
through the<br/>
house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I totally cracked up when I read this, as Jalen (and the other kids<br/>
when they can snag it from him) has been scootering all over the house<br/>
ever since he got a new scooter for Christmas.<br/>
Our living/dining/kitchen is laminate flooring and he can CRUISE.<br/>
Round and round....it seems to go day and night!<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see, right this minute Jared is  helping Jalen build a Brio<br/>
traintrack out in the living room. I can hear Jalen fussing about<br/>
certain pieces and saying &quot;that&#39;s a stupid one&quot;.  Sierra and Trevor<br/>
are still asleep....I need to go make some tea and breakfast for us.<br/>
<br/>
Markus is off at real estate school this week, so we&#39;re hanging close<br/>
to home and letting him use the van. <br/>

P.S. Sierra just popped her head into my room and now they&#39;re all<br/>
arguing about who gets the computer next...time for me to get OFF.:)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-320226290">Sarah just got off of the computer, she had been playing with the Rosetta<br/>
Stone French program she asked for for Christmas this year. Now she and Emma<br/>
are sitting on the sofa together (they&#39;re 14 and 11, btw) looking at a book<br/>
about France (Sarah has developed a passion for all things French) and<br/>
watching Little House on the Prairie.<br/>
<br/>
Caleb (7) just woke up, and is in the other room playing Mario Kart on the<br/>
GameCube. I&#39;m about to join him for a few races. He likes to have me play<br/>
with him because he knows he can beat me just about every time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917353777">I&#39;ve been on this list for a very long time, but I believe this is the <br/>
first time I&#39;ve posted. My name is Mani and I am unschooling my three <br/>
daughters in Phoenix, AZ. My oldest daughter, Hope, will be eleven on <br/>
Sunday, Asia is eight, and Brenna is five.<br/>
<br/>
 It is 11:21 a.m. and I just finished reading The Velveteen Rabbit to <br/>
Brenna. Hope and Asia are in their room, playing with a Littlest Pet <br/>
Shop set, which their dad found on clearance at a drug store right <br/>
after Christmas, and bought because he remembered them mentioning that <br/>
they thought it was cute one time.<br/>
<br/>
 Now Brenna is playing tug of war with our chihuahua and talking to me <br/>
about the weather, because she&#39;s considering getting dressed and wanted <br/>
to know what sort of thing to wear.<br/>
<br/>
 None of us have bothered to get dressed, yet, but we&#39;re thinking about <br/>
it ;-). A nice way to spend a Wednesday morning.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-594211035">That&#39;s cool! :-) What&#39;s interesting is that for months now Gracie has seemed very interested in bikes. &quot;Ride Bike.&quot; or &quot;My bike&quot; and trying to get on everyone else&#39;s bikes to ride them, sit on them in stores, etc.  She wouldn&#39;t ride the tricycle that I bought her before we left NYC. <br/>
   <br/>
  So for Christmas I made sure that I bought her a little 10&quot; bicycle, thinking she would be all over it. Nope. Grandma bought the scooter for Christmas, and that has become the new thing for Gracie! So the bike is sitting, but it&#39;s there should she want it! :-) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637925673">Right this minute, David (13) is playing Socom 3 online, Noelle (15) is<br/>
watching TV while putting together a game we got at Christmas (lots of<br/>
pieces to punch out, etc.), and Mattie (5) is taking a bath.<br/>
<br/>
Today was a fairly unusual day for us though, as we left the house by 9am,<br/>
headed to walmart for some shopping (the entire family wanted to go this<br/>
time) and afterwards we stopped at McDonald&#39;s and Taco Bell drive-thru&#39;s to<br/>
pick up some lunch for everyone.  We took this home and the kids and their<br/>
dad put on the movie Dark Water, we ate, and I worked on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a great day...oh, and tonight we are having a dinner of just<br/>
appetizers/snacks -- the kids love to do that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137627814">2:PM we just finished a very long game of series of unfortunate event <br/>
cards - took longer than usual because we could not find the rules to <br/>
the game we got for Christmas - so the girls were making up their own <br/>
rules and some times they didn&#39;t work so we kept starting over<br/>
<br/>
I am now painting a collection of about 15 various garage sales mirrors <br/>
white... have decided a mirror collage on the bathroom wall would be <br/>
neat<br/>
<br/>
Broguen 16 - dressed in the first items she pulled out of the dryer <br/>
(totaly miss mached) is trying to figure out how to transfer a drawing <br/>
she did onto canvas so she can paint it<br/>
<br/>
Le Ce 14 - is probably getting ready to audition for Once upon a <br/>
mattress at the High school - she has been attending public school this <br/>
year (her own choice)<br/>
<br/>
Trinity 11 - is surfing the web at Harry Potter sites while conversing <br/>
with another unschooler she met on line<br/>
<br/>
AUBRA 4 - still in her jammies has transformed the TV room into a world <br/>
of little people or as she calls them chubbies - it seems to me that <br/>
they are preforming some sort of opera because she is  making them all <br/>
sing everything</div>

in the snow. One of my favorite aspects of homeschooling is that  kids <br/>
can play outside anytime. My dd4 is sleeping on her bed. I&#39;m reading <br/>
yahoo messages and keeping on eye on the chicken soup on the stove <br/>
that we&#39;ll be having for supper.<br/>

tonight.  We have a bunch of teens coming over for their weekly teen<br/>
music jam session and we made the brownies for a snack.  She is now on<br/>
the couch eating a popsicle and waiting for Tom and Jerry to come on.<br/>
It&#39;s her favorite show.  Riley, my 12 year old son is playing guitar in<br/>
our &quot;fixed up&quot; garage, and my son Casey (10) is reading &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot;.<br/>
He and another friend decided to put a book group together and this is<br/>
the book of the month.  They meet once a month at Borders.  I am in the<br/>
kitchen making a big batch of tortellini soup and checking my E-mail.<br/>
It is a beautiful day.  The sun is shining and it is about 65 degrees<br/>
here in Southern California.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259817596">Jumping in here. At this moment we are between shows (did two this morning<br/>
at a school and have to head back to do a family night tonight). Mom and Dad<br/>
are using wi-fi at a cafe to get caught up on work. I just finished tweaking<br/>
our web site. Dad is writing an article. And son is out in the van playing<br/>
his electric quitar.<br/>
<br/>
You want unschool wow factor? The same day he bought his guitar he could<br/>
play a Green Day song, by the end of the week he was playing their album.<br/>
I&#39;m usually driving when he&#39;s playing. (We travel fulltime). But the other<br/>
day I actually looked at the fancy fingering he was doing and my jaw<br/>
dropped.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, fun thread.<br/>

You should seriously consider going to Southeastern Guide Dogs in Palmetto. You can take a tour and hug puppies! It&#39;s a great facility---they train guide dogs for the blind.<br/>
 <br/>
Our puppy, Ryan, is there now for training. If you do go and see him, hug him too, please! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-712748603">&quot;We then ran to the store and picked up some items we needed and<br/>
for bonus we found easy bake oven refills on clearance for only $1.18<br/>
each!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I just thought I&#39;d mention, you can get all sorts of books and recipes<br/>
online for Easy Bake ovens, using your own ingredients. Saves a ton of<br/>
money and it&#39;s really fun.<br/>
<br/>
We even found a book by some of the top chef&#39;s that is gourmet cooking<br/>
for any lightbulb style oven....Sierra thought that was hilarious. It<br/>
looks fun.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling right now is extremely quiet...as I&#39;m the only one awake<br/>
at the moment.:) We all stayed up extra late watching &quot;License to<br/>
Kill&quot;...it&#39;s been a James Bond week around here. Even Jalen loves them.<br/>
