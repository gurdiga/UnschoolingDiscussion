<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163594863">Thanks for the reminder of the list rules. Even though I did read along for a <br/>
while, I hadn&#39;t caught on that &quot;have to&quot; was an &quot;issue&quot; and just chimed in on <br/>
the discussion. Now that I know, that&#39;s one phrase I can watch out for -- on <br/>
this list anyway. <br/>

despite the words we use. But this list is different.<br/>
<br/>
So I think it&#39;s a lack of understanding that on this list that using words<br/>
to precisely represent what we mean is important. (In fact it&#39;s so important<br/>
that we made it one of our posting suggestions.) When people use words<br/>
casually, discussions go on and on (as it did) because people aren&#39;t all<br/>
getting the same picture of what the situation is like and they can all be<br/>
discussing something different.<br/>
