&lt;&lt;  Since the school system is seamless, every thread<br/>
(topic) leads to the central problem that the system is a fraud. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When you say &quot;the school system is seamless&quot; you remove the possibility that <br/>
your other information could be valid.  One bit of nonsense casts doubt on <br/>
the rest of the information.<br/>
<br/>
As you&#39;re really intent on getting your message across, Ned, I would <br/>
encourage you to edit out they hyperbole for the sake of the integrity of all <br/>
you&#39;re saying which IS true.<br/>

Yeah, I think that in response to the heated hyperbole people will roll<br/>
their eyes and dismiss him as a credible source of information. <br/>
Probably not the desired outcome.<br/>

As a reader of the &quot;Alternative Press&quot; I run into this very often. It is<br/>
hard for me to read beneath so much hyperbole and I am frequently in<br/>
agreement with the message. Imagine how the people who don&#39;t already agree<br/>
feel about reading the same.<br/>
I am much more likely to listen to a conservative christian when they speak<br/>
calmly and with as little inflammatory rhetoric as possible.<br/>
