Well, I have to agree with this. I wouldn&#39;t let anyone hit me, not even my <br/>
child. If my child was throwing things, screaming hurtful things or trying to <br/>
harm me or anyone else, I would hold them until they calmed down.<br/>
Allowing  a child to harm others is wrong. And it could extend into adult <br/>
life, which will land ya in jail!!<br/>
I think some kids are genetically more intense than others. This doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
they should be able to hurt people in the vicinity.<br/>

ot hurt me, he just loses control, and that is scary.  I agree, I think what <br/>
is going on with JP is much deeper than parenting issues.   I think Yol was <br/>
right on the money too, and I am to the point where homeopathy sounds like a <br/>
viable option.  I hope to be visiting Yol soon :-)    I have heard lots of <br/>
others testify to the success of homeopathy.  I really think that his <br/>
behavior is some &quot;unbalance&quot; of some sort.  <br/>

Ditto.  I have never had this experience with my own kids but did when I<br/>
worked in a psychiatric facility for kids.  A basket hold can be a very<br/>
comforting thing for someone who is so out of control they are hurting<br/>
people they love.<br/>

something with pictures?  My granddaughter still has to be pinned once in a<br/>
while to keep her from hurting someone.  She struggles mightily and<br/>
complains that she&#39;s being hurt.  If there were a better way to do it, I&#39;m<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901214774">I&#39;ve done this too. I think it not only protects the child from his or her own excess (explosive) energy, but it transmits the parent&#39;s calm and understanding attitude. Kids do not understand their<br/>
emotions, they just become the emotions themselves. It&#39;s up to us to bring some sort of balance to the picture.<br/>

 shirt a week &gt;&gt;<br/>

It&#39;s funny you brought up the shirt chewing thing today! My sis and I were <br/>
reminiscing about how Trevor used to ruin his shirts frequently with this <br/>
weird habit.<br/>
We talked about the difference in parenting styles then and now, that I use, <br/>
and how at that time I nagged him to stop it because I hated his shirts <br/>
getting ruined.<br/>
I decided that now, I&#39;d see it as something he needed to do for a time, and <br/>
pin some rag on his shoulder to chew on until he got over it!! lol<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have only heard of one other kid that did this shirt chewing thing.    I <br/>
have noticed since hes been home ( vs at school) he is doing a lot less <br/>
chewing.. LOL.  I have never made a really big deal out if it.   <br/>
Occasionally, if his shirt was gettting soaked and we were not at a place he <br/>
could go change, I would try to gently encourage him to stop chewing.  I pass <br/>
his clothes down to my nephew, but his shirts are mostly ruined with holes in <br/>
the neck or buttons chewed off.. He also still sucks his thumb.   Its like, <br/>
unless he is really busy with his hands, he&#39;s  sucking his thumb.   If hes <br/>
too busy with his hands, then his shirt is in his mouth.  I have basically <br/>
ignored the thumb sucking.. Its a non issue to me.  The only problem is that <br/>
sometimes his thumb gets raw and cracked .. it frustrates him to have <br/>
medicine put on it cause he cant suck it.  He usually just switches thumbs <br/>
til it gets better.  Of course, he get comments from well meaning family <br/>
members,&quot;When are you going to stop sucking your thumb?... Get that thumb out <br/>
of your mouth&quot;   He has learned to expect these kinds of statements and he <br/>
just makes an effort to not suck him thumb around his grandparents.   My <br/>
sister sucked her thumb til she was 15.<br/>

chew on.  Of course ,when he was in school, the bandana wouldnt work, they <br/>
had to wear uniforms. ..  And, he did &quot;ruin&quot; his shirts.. I let him wear them <br/>
with ragged necks or small holes, but eventually, the whole neck or collar <br/>
would be chewed off.   Yeah, they are still OK to wear to play in, but I <br/>
wouldnt hand them down to anyone .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-60653955">My son has all these behaviors also,    sensitivity things also,   one thing that has been hard on him is he had to get glasses,   bugs him to death,  we&#39;ll probably get him contacts as soon as he wants them,  maybe that will help.        <br/>
 <br/>
He also has had outbursts,  but they were more prevalent when he was 4 or 5, he&#39;s 9 now,   and I would hold him close to me so he couldn&#39;t hurt himself or others.   It seemed like my love and compassion would wash onto him.     The more I could ignore and let go the things he was saying and doing the better he would respond to me,    the calmer I was the calmer he would be.<br/>
 <br/>
He would have been alot worse if he would have been forced into doing alot of activities like other kids were,   but he had more time to himself and down time--that has been very important for his development,  and it gives us time to talk about dealing with emotions.     Its still hard for him to stop and breath but if I just quiet the situation and kind-of remind him of our discussions it works the best.<br/>
 <br/>
A book we&#39;ve used for dealing with emotions is    Don&#39;t Rant and Rave on Wednesdays!        Talks about dealing with anger,   there are other books also by these authors,  by Adolph Moser         When I was reading this with my 9 and 8 yr olds,  I didn&#39;t think my 5 yr old was listening,  she was too busy to sit with us.  But every so often she would walk over and look at the pictures,   And she has shown me that she did hear some of it because she  said the other  day,   &quot;I counted, Mommy&quot;  meaning counting as her anger disappeared.       It also talks about breathing and calming our bodies.    I liked it.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope this helps,   <br/>

Only if you made the child do it, or had them wear it away from the house.<br/>
I was only pondering options that might save the shirt and honor the child&#39;s <br/>
need.<br/>
I think the bandana is a great one, as would be keeping cheap t-shirts around <br/>
that they like and saving a few nicer t&#39;s for when holes on the shoulder <br/>
might not go over well.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest grew out of it, and my middle guy only did it for a little while, <br/>
and without the intensity of Trevors chewing.<br/>
I know other children that have done this, and they all passed through it <br/>
without too many shirts ruined!!<br/>

Trevor was never sensitive over clothing or things like that. But he was <br/>
denied the ability to wean himself and I always felt that his mouth issues <br/>
were over that.<br/>

 I was also a little disappointed as I have been spending a fortune on <br/>
 colloidal silver to keep everyone well and it didn&#39;t work at all. I know <br/>

I think colloidal silver is WAY overrated.<br/>

Here&#39;s what we&#39;ve used that has worked the best for colds/flu type stuff. <br/>
Fast recovery times and if you get it in the healthy family members you can <br/>
often avoid the entire thing from spreading.<br/>

Garlic (by Kyolic usually, good brand)<br/>
Echinacea/Reishi mushroom/Astragulus blend by Nature&#39;s way<br/>
Sometimes I add Cayenne or Goldenseal tea to the regimen, and some <br/>
adidopholus to balance out the digestive trac.<br/>
I&#39;ve always had good results with boosting the immune system/killing germs <br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;He also still sucks his thumb.   Its like, unless he is really busy with <br/>
his hands, he&#39;s  sucking his thumb.   If hes too busy with his hands, then <br/>
his shirt is in his mouth.  I have basically ignored the thumb sucking.. Its <br/>
a non issue to me.  The only problem is that<br/>
sometimes his thumb gets raw and cracked .. it frustrates him to have<br/>
medicine put on it cause he cant suck it.  He usually just switches thumbs <br/>
til it gets better.  Of course, he get comments from well meaning family <br/>
members,&quot;When are you going to stop sucking your thumb?... Get that thumb <br/>
out of your mouth&quot;   He has learned to expect these kinds of statements and <br/>
he just makes an effort to not suck him thumb around his grandparents.   My <br/>
sister sucked her thumb til she was 15.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh I&#39;m glad someone brought this up. I&#39;ve been meaning to ask about thumb <br/>
sucking and hadn&#39;t got around to it. My kids have all had strong sucking <br/>
needs from day one. Even my totally breastfed baby still sucks a &quot;pasher.&quot; <br/>
My oldest sucked her fingers, my son a pacifier, my daughter her thumb and <br/>
the baby still a pacifier. My first two stopped by age 3-4 on their own. My <br/>
daughter will be 7 in Feb. and her thumb is still a big favorite. The baby <br/>
still has her pasher but that doesn&#39;t bother me as she&#39;s only 2. What I <br/>
worry about is my daughters teeth if she still sucks her thumb. The dentist <br/>
tells me she needs to stop. We&#39;ve talked about it with her and I remind her <br/>
during the day when she doesn it. Usually she does it when she&#39;s relaxing <br/>
and watching tv or reading a book. When I remind her, she takes it out. She <br/>
wonders how she&#39;ll ever get to sleep if she can&#39;t suck it at night. We <br/>
talked about the stuff you put on your thumb that tastes bad and she said <br/>
for me to get it. I have yet to do so. I&#39;m still on the fence with this.<br/>

Help, ideas and opinions welcome.<br/>

her thumb at 15.  She used to hold her other hand over it, or hold a book in <br/>

She&#39;s beautiful, her teeth are fine, the only thing that wasn&#39;t fine was <br/>

She doesn&#39;t smoke cigarettes, she doesn&#39;t use drugs, she doesn&#39;t drink <br/>

If every cigarette smoker would start sucking his thumb instead, the world <br/>

I say leave them alone, after pointing out to them that most people will not <br/>
be kind about it.  If they complain that someone was mean to them, you could <br/>
say &quot;That will probably keep happening as long as you&#39;re sucking your thumb.  <br/>
You could stop, or you could just deal with the wisecracks.&quot;<br/>

No I know dentists aren&#39;t always right. But 4 doesn&#39;t seem to be a problem <br/>
for me, permanent teeth aren&#39;t coming in yet. Sierra is just about 7 and <br/>
still sucking. Her teeth are all crowded in there as it is. I had to have <br/>
permanent teeth pulled as I had no room. Go figure with my big mouth and <br/>
all. My teeth are great. Only one cavity. Good strong teeth. I have awful <br/>
gums. I&#39;m on drugs right now because of it. I&#39;m also in pain. My husband has <br/>
awful teeth. Just awful....but great gums. My kids have to worry either way. <br/>
I take them to the dentist religiously for check ups and cleanings. I&#39;ll <br/>
pound it into them if I have to so they don&#39;t end up like my husband and I <br/>
now. (okay not really pound. :)<br/>
<br/>
I had braces and my oldest had braces, I guess it happens no matter what. <br/>
BUT, I just worry about being able to prevent some of the crap they&#39;ll have <br/>
to deal with later now.<br/>

I guess I feel like if I can try to break the habit, I&#39;ll save them some <br/>
discomfort or baloney later on.<br/>

they didn&#39;t start falling out until he was 8 1/2.  About the time he started <br/>
