  **Did you notice that the witches in that scene are named The Weird Sisters?  It seemed familiar so I asked my daughter and sure enough, that&#39;s the name of the band that plays at the Yule Ball in Goblet of Fire. **<br/>
<br/>
  I didn&#39;t remember that from Goblet of Fire.<br/>
<br/>
  I wonder how many other connections there are like that.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m going to read them all again, once I&#39;m done with Return of the King, (which I&#39;m bound and determined to finish before the film comes out)   I&#39;ll have to keep my eyes open for those references.<br/>
<br/>
  Cool!<br/>
