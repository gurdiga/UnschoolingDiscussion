<div id="ygrps-yiv-753073089">I am going to give you the perspective of someone whose children were in school up to 4th and 6th grade so I don&#39;t have the same frame of reference as others on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Life is full of negative messages that our children pick up all the time.  Our job is to coach them along the way and help them develop into their own person.  There are positive as well as negative things about preschool and dance class just as there are positive and negative things about TV.  If you think she would love the social interaction and other positive things than by keeping her out, you are saying she is not capable of handling the negative things.  At some point, she will probably ask to take a dance class so it is really just a matter of when.  If you think she is too young now and will be too greatly influenced by her classmates, wait but this could also be the time to help her deal with some of these things.  You would know best.<br/>
<br/>
I know my children have a few scars from ps but mostly because I bought into the system and only in the areas I bought into.  They have also built up some calluses that would have been hard to build without the stuff they had to deal with.  I think these calluses are very beneficial in dealing with other kids and the world as it is.<br/>

Well, it&#39;s not true for performing, that&#39;s for sure. It takes a lot to stop <br/>
someone who really wants to perform. You could do it, but it doesn&#39;t sound <br/>
like YOU could do it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, though your sister sounds irritating, don&#39;t automatically dismiss <br/>
something your daughter might like just because she suggests it. Go with your <br/>
instincts on how it would work for your family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-822837653">I think  it would really depend on the class.  If the dance teacher is<br/>
rigid and wants all the kids, even the little ones to do as their told, I<br/>
think that wouldn&#39;t be any fun and would even spoil her love of<br/>
performing.    Performing for your little kid is all about imagination<br/>
and an instructor will want to introduce all the other stuff.  Will your<br/>
daughter really like waiting for her turn to sing?  Dancing just the way<br/>
someone else says?    If you really wonder, go and visit a few of the<br/>
classes and see how engaged the other little kids are and if they&#39;re<br/>
really happy.   Putting someone else&#39;s structure to a three year old<br/>
imagination might spoil everything.<br/>
<br/>
Three is so little.   When Dylan was four some of his friends were<br/>
playing soccer.  He decided to try.  He didn&#39;t like jumping in the middle<br/>
of other kids to try and kick the ball, but he did like rolling in the<br/>
grass, and crawling around inside the ball bag.   He made friends with a<br/>
little girl who liked the same things ( and looking for airplanes)  and<br/>
the next year soccer season came her mom and I just sewed big bags and<br/>
took them to the park a couple times a week.  They had just as much fun<br/>
and it was free.  He did try soccer again, and might another time too,<br/>
but sometimes the social part of any organized kid thing can be had in<br/>
other ways that are even more fun for the kid.  So, maybe some<br/>
interesting dress up stuff and  lots of little songs to sing,  would be<br/>
more fun and full of her own imaginings and just right at three.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-936303646">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list, and wanted to add my 2 cents to this question.  My <br/>
son, Shawn (aged 27), who learned at home except for kindergarten and then <br/>
college, is a performer.  He was a skateboarder from ages 8-14.  When an <br/>
injury sidelined him he taught himself to juggle, and took that to a <br/>
performing stage when he discovered gymnastics.  He was way too old to be <br/>
starting(about 19), but loved it, and is still teaching it as one of his <br/>
part-time jobs while he is in school.<br/>
<br/>
That took him into diving (springboard, and tower), which he is doing at <br/>
college in PA right now.  He will go to Nationals soon, and we&#39;ll see how he <br/>
does.  In the meantime he has done a little stuntwork in TV stuff, and had a <br/>
small part in an African movie, plus modeled.  He went to jr. college here in <br/>
CA, and now is majoring in acting while on the dive team in PA.  <br/>
<br/>
He got to PA because he was in a dive show at 6 Flags in Houston, and met a <br/>
dive coach that knew a coach etc.<br/>
<br/>
Did he ever take classes?  NO-- not until he was old enough to drive himself, <br/>
and pay for them thro exchange work.  Maybe I was a lazy mom or maybe they <br/>
don&#39;t need to start &quot;classes&quot; but can work at learning at their own pace.<br/>
<br/>
For instance - he learned the juggling with books and video, and then <br/>
regularly went to Balboa Park to join a group that did street performing to <br/>
practice and learn with them.<br/>
<br/>
I think he retained his natural enthusiam by not &quot;having&quot; to do anything.  He <br/>
could make the choices by being older and being in control.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a homeschooled family of five kids here who are professional <br/>
performers.  Until the oldest was about 14 and the youngest five or six, <br/>
they&#39;d  never done anything but sing songs together.  But one song needed a <br/>
trick knife for a stabbing (they were acting out the ballad of The Twa <br/>
Sisters), and they rigged up a SCARY looking, metal, retractable blade (with <br/>
rubber bands inside a tube--I held it before and after, and to have held it <br/>
and THEN see them stab their skinny sister with it was truly scary.<br/>
<br/>
The oldest is 24 now.  They have a magic show, VERY original juggling, are <br/>
adding aeriel kind of stuff, there&#39;s comedy, music, it is SO COOL.  They&#39;re <br/>
called The Clan Tynker (&quot;the Tynkers&quot;) and you&#39;ll all probably see them on TV <br/>
someday.  They did meet a guy, after they were getting this all together, who <br/>
taught them some theatricals.  And the oldest boy worked in a magic shop for <br/>
a while.  But most of the tricks and ALL the equipment they&#39;ve made <br/>
themselves.  Even the bars they use for the flips, the whole rig with its guy <br/>
ropes and all was home made.  <br/>

performing.  &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This is so very true!  My ds, age 3 1/2, is very introverted, but he likes<br/>
to get out there and do stuff.  There is a place here that offers a<br/>
homeschool gymnastics class:   ~36 kids divided into 4 groups by age.<br/>
Before I signed the kids up, I asked ds if he wanted to go.  He said yes, he<br/>
was very excited.  The first class, he ran right in with his sister.  They<br/>
have a circle time warm up, all the kids together for about 15 minutes, then<br/>
they split up.  He was a bit overwhelmed by all of the kids and just kind of<br/>
watched.   After the groups split, he had a blast.  Problem was, that there<br/>
wasn&#39;t enough order and the other kids were pushing past my ds to get a turn<br/>
on the equipment (balance beams to walk on, mats to roll on, things to climb<br/>
up and over, slide down, hang from, etc).  My ds isn&#39;t the kind to say<br/>
anything, though I could tell he was getting upset.  After the class, we<br/>
talked about it, and he was OK.  Next class, same thing, but he did stick up<br/>
for himself more and take his turns.  Then, apparently the teacher realized<br/>
she needed more control, and now she has the kids line up in a certain<br/>
order, they can&#39;t have a turn until it&#39;s their turn, they must sit still and<br/>
wait......too far the other way, esp. for 3 & 4 yr olds.  Now ds doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to go.  He does want to go play on the equipment, but he doesn&#39;t want<br/>
all of the structure.  I have been talking with him, and the past couple of<br/>
classes he participated about half the time, then came out and joined me.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the teacher is after me to just &quot;hand him over&quot; at the beginning of the<br/>
class, let him cry for his &quot;30 seconds&quot; (her terms) and he&#39;ll be fine.  On<br/>
the contrary, ds does not take well to others &quot;controlling&quot; him without<br/>
regard to his feelings (he has enough stuff in his life he can&#39;t control<br/>
already that he has to deal with) and she&#39;s concerned that &quot;the other kids<br/>
have been told that their moms can&#39;t stay with them, so they wonder why T&#39;s<br/>
can&quot; (apparently the other moms agreed to this).  So, here we are, with 3<br/>
classes left.  I have been talking with T and he&#39;s pretty sure he doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to go anymore.  That&#39;s fine with me (though he&#39;ll be dressed<br/>
appropriately in case he changes his mind, which he&#39;s prone to do :)<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, dd, age 7, could stay and play all day.  She has trouble<br/>
following directions (always has) but doesn&#39;t seem to mind being corrected<br/>
when she gets out of hand (carried away, too much enthusiasm, overactive).<br/>

then eventually you&#39;re going to have to let her take some classes.  If you <br/>
don&#39;t, she&#39;ll probably agitate to go to school, like my granddaughter <br/>
did.  That said, there&#39;s no reason to put her into one now.  There&#39;s plenty <br/>
of time, once she actually expresses a desire for classes.<br/>
<br/>
And about that window of opportunity thing...  In the first place, it only <br/>
applies in the case of someone wanting to go to the Olympics or perform <br/>
professionally, and not necessarily even then.  The conductor of one of the <br/>
orchestras I play in didn&#39;t start playing the violin until he was 10.  He <br/>
went on to be concertmaster of some pretty high class symphony orchestras, <br/>
as well as founding first violinist of the Purcell Quartet, before moving <br/>
to conducting after a shoulder injury.  An unschooled young man I know <br/>
started piano at about age 9 and added violin a couple of years <br/>
later.  He&#39;s now, at 18, welcome in the best amateur orchestras in town, <br/>
but he isn&#39;t home often enough.  He&#39;s busy touring with his band.  He plays <br/>
fiddle, keyboard, and accordian.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry.<br/>
Rational Thought...<br/>
<br/>
[Climbing onto my soap box]<br/>
<br/>
This is a hot button for me.<br/>
<br/>
I work at a performing arts center. A place where dance schools have<br/>
performances to show case their student&#39;s work. There are currently about 8<br/>
schools that use our facility and I can&#39;t think of a one that has the<br/>
child&#39;s interest as it&#39;s primary focus. Some are better than others. In one<br/>
form or another all of them use shame, humiliation, and, massive amounts of<br/>
coercion to put their shows together to sell to the student&#39;s friends and<br/>
families. I see hours and hours of kids waiting to appear on stage, sitting<br/>
on the floor in the hallway being hassled for taking or playing or even<br/>
drawing while passing the time. &quot;Homework&quot; is often the only acceptable<br/>
activity.  On stage they are often herded to place and screamed at for the<br/>
slightest misstep. I have seen 4 year olds humiliated for asking to go to<br/>
the restroom. And I have seen kids so scared they have peed their pants, on<br/>
stage, and then berated in front of everyone present for doing so.<br/>
These concerts are a major money making endeavor for many of the schools.<br/>
After paying for the classes, parents (and friends) must pay as much as $50<br/>
a ticket, inflated prices for costumes and props that the schools provide.<br/>
Then the fees for the party, the class picture, the performance picture,<br/>
etc, etc, etc.  From my view it is a racket.<br/>
<br/>
One of my best friends is a producer, director, and owns his own production<br/>
and costume company. He knows dozens of choreographers and hundreds of<br/>
dancers. It took him months of searching to find an appropriate school for<br/>
his 6 year old to attend. One that was [relatively] non coercive, where<br/>
performance was optional, where parents could be in the room during classes<br/>
and where the instructor cared about each student including the slow<br/>
graceless ones. I know that there must be many good dance schools out there.<br/>
But I was dumbfounded that a person with that much inside knowledge, who was<br/>
willing to drive 20 miles in any direction, encompassing millions of people<br/>
in Southern California had such a difficult time finding one.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter is singing and dancing on her own, why do you think she<br/>
needs a class? If you are worried about her learning the &#39;proper&#39; way of<br/>
dancing isn&#39;t there plenty of time to learn when *she* thinks it is<br/>
important? Have you ever read the biographies of great dancers? Did you see<br/>
how much time, how much of their lives, they had to give up to become great?<br/>
Whenever I see a great performance by a young person I get a pang of guilt<br/>
knowing that they have traded (usually through coercion and guilt) some<br/>
essential part of their childhood for that *great* performance that I am<br/>
enjoying.<br/>
<br/>
I love Dance. I know of no better kinetic expression of what it is to be<br/>
human than Dance. The moments of human Truth I have experienced while<br/>
watching a Ballet or an introspective modern dance work cannot be perceived<br/>
any other way. But lets not mix the difference of participating in the art<br/>
form as an audience member and as a performer. If you have ever been<br/>
backstage during a performance and seen the evolved preparation, the<br/>
exertion and pain required to give those seemingly effortless moves life,<br/>
the agony in the faces as theses artists come into the wings and the despair<br/>
of a person who&#39;s career has been ended by a seemingly minor injury, You<br/>
might wonder why anyone does it. I do.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be a damper on something I love so much. But so much of path<br/>
to those magical, Truthful moments in the performance of Dance goes against<br/>
the unschooling lifestyle that my family enjoys.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, one of the best performances I have *ever* been a part of in<br/>
the 30 years I have been involved in entertainment, is the Talent Show at<br/>
the Homeschool Association of California conference this past August. Pam<br/>
got Jocelyn and I to supply the lighting and sound for the event and the<br/>
three of us acted as stage managers facilitating the flow of the evening.<br/>
Anyone at the conference who *wanted to* signed up for their minutes of fame<br/>
and presented whatever they cared to.  This included dancing and singing and<br/>
jugging, skateboarding, and free form improvisational poetry. There was a<br/>
history talk given from the heart of a history lover. Sandra played a<br/>
recorder duet with herself on tape. There were three young people that<br/>
served as Masters of Ceremony.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, even from the<br/>
wings. What made it so worthwhile for me was that the performances came from<br/>
within each of the performers. *Roxana don&#39;t read this next part* You could<br/>
have floated me down the American river I was so buoyant with pride as Pam&#39;s<br/>
kids, who I consider good personal friends of mine, performed for their<br/>
hearts. *OK Roxana* Later Sandra said of all the performers of the evening,<br/>
that they *had* to perform. That no one made them perform but that there was<br/>
something in them that led them to the stage. That performing was better<br/>
then not performing.  I saw no coercion or humiliation, no agony as they<br/>
left the stage.  This performance is closer, by far, to the hopes and dreams<br/>
that I have while I am perusing my AlwaysLeaning life than usual<br/>
professional work I do in entertainment.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Then you hear about think &#39;window&#39; of time for people who go on to be <br/>
great and how their paren&#39;t always started then at 2,3, or 4.  (Ok the <br/>
Olymipc thing is getting me I guess).  :)  It&#39;s just too easy to second guess <br/>
all of this.<br/>
 <br/>
 What is you guys&#39; take on it?  Are they better off figuring it out on their <br/>
own?  She&#39;s sort of at an age where she would happily do anything but if I <br/>
try to interfere by &#39;helping&#39; she becomes immidiatly helpless and &#39;forgets&#39; <br/>
how to do it.  Like drawing.  If I try to draw too at the same time as her <br/>
(different paper and everything) then she won&#39;t draw anymore and only wants <br/>
me to draw for her.  I&#39;d love to know if anyone else has struggled with this <br/>
and what happened there. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just dig in my heels when I think about little kids doing classes.  I know, <br/>
I know<br/>
some folks, their kids just love it (and that is usually they very social <br/>
ones--of<br/>
which I have two social children) and thats for them to decide, but I am <br/>
really<br/>
for keeping my little people at home and activity/class level low.  My kids<br/>
ride motorcycles and dh would have let them race a couple of years ago<br/>
at 5 & 6.  Other parents do.  The kids aren&#39;t beggig, or even asking to do it<br/>
They ride now for fun, on trail rides<br/>
or on our neighbors motocross field he made.  No pressure.  And they<br/>
love it.   I have a dh who thinks they should be racing now if they want a<br/>
motocross career (two of mine might I can see that, they are good) but<br/>
he doesn&#39;t push and really respects me on this.  My feeling is if they<br/>
wait another year, two or four &lt;g&gt; they won&#39;t be behind because they<br/>
have still been riding all this time.  So anyhow I don&#39;t think its necessary<br/>
for kids to do classes at 2, 3, 4.  In fact my 4 yr old wanted to play soccer<br/>
with a hs class we had and the coach let him and he was developmentally<br/>
too young to do this much constant running (he is active, he is just 4),<br/>
so that would be my other concern of classes for preschool age from my<br/>
experiences.<br/>
