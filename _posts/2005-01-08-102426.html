I think mine gained immunity from breastfeeding, so even if they were  <br/>

Maybe it was a Latin verb form anyway, and not English.<br/>
I have an  English degree, but not Latin.  I like grammar but there are only <br/>

And Latin...<br/>
The last people in the mostly-Protestant English speaking world who needed  <br/>
Latin were doctors and pharmacists who trained before WWII.  Now unless one  <br/>
wants to be a linguist or a Jesuit researcher or a Latin teacher, Latin is not  <br/>
much more useful than knowing Klingon or the Tolkien languages.<br/>
 <br/>
Those kinds of things can be wonderfully fascinating, but eight year old  <br/>
boys shouldn&#39;t be made to do any of them.<br/>

<br/>
The basic idea: &quot;The pluperfect tense in Latin is employed when the <br/>
speaker wishes to express any action *already completed* at some <br/>
point in the past.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Passive pluperfect is using a passive verb in this tense...&quot;it had <br/>
been brought back&quot; as opposed to active &quot;I had brought it back&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Okay, strewing this might just be evil and manipulative...<br/>
