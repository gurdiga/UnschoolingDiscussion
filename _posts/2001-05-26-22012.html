<br/>
I have a &quot;cyber-friend&quot; that I&#39;ve known for over two years now. We joined a list where we all had our babies in the same month/year. I am finally getting to meet her TOMORROW! She and her kids live in Des Moines and are traveling to Texas. I live in Kansas and am driving over to Joplin, Mo tomorrow so we can go through the Precious Moments Chapel at Carthage together. We&#39;re spending the night and then we&#39;ll go on our separate ways. We&#39;ve sent pictures and talked on the phone, but it &quot;ain&#39;t gonna be nothing&quot; like seeing her in person!! <br/>
<br/>
You guys really ought to plan an outing together being so close like that! And don&#39;t forget to bring your cameras!<br/>

&gt; over to Joplin, Mo tomorrow so we can go through the Precious Moments<br/>
&gt; Chapel at Carthage together. We&#39;re spending the night and then we&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; go on our separate ways. We&#39;ve sent pictures and talked on the phone,<br/>
&gt; but it &quot;ain&#39;t gonna be nothing&quot; like seeing her in person!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You guys really ought to plan an outing together being so close like<br/>
&gt; that! And don&#39;t forget to bring your cameras!<br/>

Terri, Hope you have a fun get-together. I&#39;ve probably met about 30 <br/>
people from the various lists I&#39;m on, sometimes traveling cross-<br/>
country for big gatherings, sometimes when they visit here, and <br/>
sometimes just meeting them when we&#39;re traveling through on vacation. <br/>
It&#39;s always been wonderful, people I&#39;ve &quot;known&quot; online have never <br/>
disappointed me in person!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
