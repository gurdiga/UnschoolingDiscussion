<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117385326">Lynda or any one else with this experience, could you please let me know<br/>
exactly how he went about doing this.  Thsi is a battle we are fixing to<br/>
face next year. I understand that this subject is probably not welcome on<br/>
the list, so if any of you would like to email me privately your<br/>
experiences, please please do so.  I don&#39;t know where to start or who to<br/>
speak with first. I am in Missouri, but any and all info would be greatly<br/>
appreciated by my &quot;football player!&quot; as well as myself.    Thank you<br/>
<br/>
KIM<br/>

<br/>
&lt;Son #3 has gone to school upon occasion.  He has &lt;done it his way and has<br/>
&lt;even taken them all the way through all the &lt;complaint processes to the<br/>
&lt;school board and then flashed state regs at them.  &lt;He won and he did<br/>
school<br/>
&lt;his way which was to go during a sports season</div>
