<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747660213">I was concerned about all the weird inventions they use in training - lights, bells, applause - but it&#39;s a WONDERFUL laboratory for learning a PRACTICAL life skill - I use the skills every single day!!!<br/>
<br/>
Find a club with a time that works for you.  Some clubs are 1 hr, some are 2 hr.  I like one hour in morning myself.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and it&#39;s cheap too!  Ours is $51 / 6 months Canadian, but only AFTER you join up.  You can go as long as you want as a guest.  You CAN EVEN refuse to talk as a guest.  I did.  I was crapping brix!<br/>
<br/>
So, go for it.  Next to unschooling, it is the best thing that I&#39;ve done (for my self).<br/>

involved. I was involved with it through my old employer because they <br/>
made it available for free, and it was supposed to help with moving <br/>
up in the company (wink wink)<br/>
<br/>
I never realized how hard it was getting up and speaking like that, <br/>
and how many times i said um, um.....<br/>
