respiratory allergens, or what?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d try the rotation diet first so that you could rule out all the foods <br/>
you are sensitive too.<br/>

  I have tons of books, and I keep looking for more!  I know what you mean about the library though.  I would recommend the following for starters:<br/>

<br/>
  Diet for a New America by John Robbins<br/>
<br/>
  Food Enzymes - The Missing Link to Radiant Health by Humbart Santillo, MH,N.D.<br/>
<br/>
  Enzyme Nutrition by Dr. Edward Howell<br/>
<br/>
  Mad Cowboy by Howard Lyman<br/>
<br/>
  Beyond Beef by Jeremy Rifkin<br/>
<br/>
  Old MacDonald&#39;s Factory Farm by C. David Coats<br/>
<br/>
  Conscious Eating by Dr. Gabriel Cousens<br/>
<br/>
  Spiritual Nutrition and the Rainbow Diet also by Cousens<br/>
<br/>
  Survival Into the 21st Century by Viktoras Kulvinskas<br/>
<br/>
  Think Before you Eat by Diane Olive<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978516536">There are several lists for folks that are interested in &quot;simplified&quot; living<br/>
and books such as &quot;Back to Basics&quot; for those that really want to chuck it<br/>
all and really get back to basics.<br/>
<br/>
One of the lists with tons of tips and recipes (like the soap ones that were<br/>
mentioned earlier) is or was (I only have the old e-groups e-mail addy)<br/>

Diet for a Poisoned Planet is the one that helped convince hubby that now<br/>
was the time to complete the conversion over to all organic.<br/>
