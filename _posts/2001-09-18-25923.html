<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070945847">I love this example as well... Child # 1 was 2 and I decided on lessons.  He <br/>
loved the water and then came the lessons.  They dunked him under the water <br/>
repeatedly to &quot;help&quot; him not be afraid of the water (which he wasn&#39;t afraid <br/>
of before the lessons).  Took him out of the lessons and it took him at least <br/>
a year before he became unafraid of going into the water.  He took his arm <br/>
bands off at nearly 5 and has been swimming ever since.  Although I wonder <br/>
what damage I did to our relationship by submitting him to this torture.  <br/>
Child #2 no lessons and I won&#39;t be getting any for him.  He&#39;s in a vest at <br/>
nearly 2 and swims around on his own and doesn&#39;t even want to be held.  He&#39;s <br/>
confident and pushes me away in the water so he can be on his own.  No doubt <br/>
that he has more confidence because of no swimming lessons.<br/>
<br/>
I also thought more about the whole idea of involving kids in things.  It <br/>
seems as soon as they are born there are Gymboree Classes, Parks and Rec <br/>
Classes, Baby Tot Programs, YMCA Programs, Baby Day at the Zoo etc etc... THe <br/>
list is endless... We&#39;ve become a society (this is my opinion) whereby it&#39;s <br/>
expected that kids will be provided all kinds of things to entertain and <br/>
educate them, rather than them letting themselves discover what they love and <br/>
us fueling that passion.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 year old loves garbage trucks so next week we are taking a trip to the <br/>
landfill (I&#39;m keeping my windows rolled up LOL)  Not only did this not cost <br/>
me anything I knew Max will absolutely love it.<br/>
<br/>
As I write Zak (6) is at Home Depot with DH buying a new door for him room.  <br/>
He&#39;s excited that he gets to spend &quot;special time&quot; with daddy and do a project <br/>
that Max doesn&#39;t get to do.  DH is off this morning as it&#39;s our homeschooling <br/>
meeting.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I&#39;m rambling now so I&#39;ll shut up.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One set of parents sign the<br/>
&gt; kid up for swimming lessons and force the child to attend (definitely not<br/>
&gt; unschooling).  One set of parents signs the kid up for lessons and when the<br/>
&gt; kid asks to stop going the parents have no problem (possibly unschooling).<br/>
&gt; One set of parents asks their kid if he is interested in taking swimming<br/>
&gt; lessons and kid says would like to try it.  After 2 lessons wants to stop<br/>
&gt; and parents agree (unschooling as is most often practiced).  One set of<br/>
&gt; parents plays in the water with their baby and continues on as child becomes<br/>
&gt; toddler and older.  At some point, the kid turns loose of parent to<br/>
&gt; s-t-r-e-t-c-h and reach wall, eventually paddling a couple of strokes,<br/>
&gt; eventually swimming (unschooling as described most often by Holt).<br/>
