 </span></blockquote>Wow, Ann.  This is so neat!. Someone posted a question about peacocks on<br/>
another homeschooling list I&#39;m on just yesterday.  Their kids had been<br/>
playing a trivia game where the answer to one of the questions was that<br/>
peacocks don&#39;t lay eggs.  She wanted to know if this was true.  (Of course<br/>
it is -- peacocks don&#39;t lay eggs, but peahens certainly do :-).<br/>
<br/>
Several people came back with all kinds of information about peafowl having<br/>
searched it out on the internet.  Some people are really getting into the<br/>
whole peafowl thing.  Can I share your message about incubating the eggs<br/>
with the other list?<br/>
