<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941161678">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
Following on from a piece of humour received recently: &quot;Girls&#39; Prayer&quot;<br/>
and &quot;Boys Prayer&quot; (basically about shopping and beer respectively, and<br/>
in the form of the Lord&#39;s Prayer - if anyone hasn&#39;t seen this and<br/>
would like to, please email me for it privately), I have been tossing<br/>
this one over for the last couple of days - thought you&#39;d enjoy it.  I<br/>
do not mean to be derisive to the Lord&#39;s Prayer, or to cause anyone<br/>
offense by this - I am simply copying it&#39;s form.<br/>
<br/>
Our Inner Wisdom, which art in our hearts<br/>
Hallowed be our Unschooling.<br/>
Thy peace shall come<br/>
Thy will be done in home as it is in NZUnschoolers 8-)<br/>
Give us this day our dose of sanity<br/>
And forgive us our stuff-ups<br/>
As we forgive those who send theirs to school 8-)<br/>
And lead us not into temptation to send ours to school<br/>
And deliver us from school-at-home.<br/>
For ours is the knowledge, the power and the glory<br/>
Forever and ever<br/>
UNSCHOOLING!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
