<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090532006">It&#39;s interesting to read about non-coercive parenting. I like much <br/>
of what you all share here. Some of it makes me uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
We have routines in place that help the household run, but I am <br/>
a fairly random personality so they are definitely not rigid. <br/>
<br/>
The way I&#39;ve seen it is that we all make a mess together living in <br/>
this house so we should all cooperate in cleaning it up. With <br/>
seven of us, that works better on a routine with everyone giving <br/>
effort. We have a weekly clean-up on Sat. mornings and the kids <br/>
do all the dishes and table stuff every night. Rooms are all <br/>
cleaned every week and all kids do their own laundry starting at <br/>
age 6. Everyone works on the yard--mowing, raking, snow <br/>
shoveling. No one is exempt. And we do it together.<br/>
<br/>
This is incredibly liberating to me and to us as a family. No one <br/>
feels put upon and there is an esprit de corps that is very healthy. <br/>
I love listening to the kids talk to each other at night while they <br/>
clean up. They turn up their music and laugh and chat. it&#39;s such a <br/>
neat time! I imagine they will remember it fondly when they are <br/>
older. But now, they would of course say no if I offered them a <br/>
choice between cleaning plates and playing X Box.<br/>
<br/>
When I think of unschooling and NCP, I think of creating a context <br/>
for maximum freedom to create... freedom to, rather than <br/>
freedom from. In our home, that will mean that we&#39;ll continue <br/>
these routines as they are. (We&#39;ve given them the freedom to <br/>
modify how the turns get set up and who does waht jobs... they <br/>
are very democratic about it, actually.)<br/>
<br/>
I guess telling them to come downstairs dressed, with beds <br/>
made and to eat breakfast before moving on with the day didn&#39;t <br/>
seem coercive to me. It seemed necessary for our family to <br/>
function well.<br/>
<br/>
How does yur family do it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-172262019">Julie,<br/>
<br/>
I have a lot of the same ideas as you about our family working together to <br/>
keep things in some semblance of  &quot;decency&quot;.. ( as far as housekeeping, <br/>
laundry, cooking, yardwork, etc)   I know that most folks here dont agree <br/>
with parents asking thier kids to pitch in.. but, so far, I havent really <br/>
come up with an alternative.   I have been trying though.. trying to see <br/>
other ways to survive as a family without depending on assistance from the <br/>
kids.  I have never, ever been hard lined about chores or duties or jobs or <br/>
the like.  But, generally speaking, I would ask the kids to pick up after <br/>
themselves, take thier dirty dishes to the kitchen, put thier things away. . <br/>
help carry in groceries, help with supper.. etc.. I dont have any &quot;rules&quot; <br/>
about thier rooms or beds.. Anna cleans her room when it gets too messy for <br/>
her likeing ( which is not too messy)  Landon keeps his room clean, but he <br/>
didnt til he was about 13.. til then it was atrocious.  The younger boys, 11 <br/>
and 7, thier room is still atrocious.  I mean, cant walk, food spilled, <br/>
clothes out, call the health dept atrocious.   Its no use to ask them to <br/>
clean it up.. They cant, it gets so bad that it is beyond thier capablities.. <br/>
 Then, they have no where to play, so they spill out into the living room and <br/>
other rooms ( that is where my asking them to pick up comes in, when it <br/>
infringes on the &quot;common rooms&quot; we all use)  Dh and I cleaned it up after <br/>
Christmas just so they would have a place to put thier new stuff.  Well, <br/>
guess what, its trashed again.  I would use gentle reminders before it got <br/>
out of hand.. Hey guys, maybe you should pick up your stuff , theres not too <br/>
much to do.  I even picked it up a few times.. But, it never fails, it gets <br/>
BEYOND bad.  Anyway, enough of my dirty room troubles.  I guess what I am <br/>
saying is, I can empathize.. and I hope that in time I can begin to <br/>
understand how to manage my household without &quot;coercing&quot; my children into <br/>
helping me.  If I spend all of my time picking up after them, cleaning up, <br/>
doing ALL the work around here, then how will we have time to do anything <br/>
fun?  And if I just leave the mess and let it all go, then we will become the <br/>
type of family that others have talked about the.. &quot;unclean, unhealthy, <br/>
unfit&quot; stereotype.  Its difficult to find the balance<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Elissa, I don&#39;t think they have to want to help. I think they need to <br/>
realize that their help is valuable. I don&#39;t want to make dinner <br/>
most nights. Really. But I do it because I know it is valuable to <br/>
the family.<br/>
<br/>
Our philosophy aobut cleaning and supporting the home and <br/>
family is based on a desire to liberate me, as well. I am not the <br/>
default housekeeper. I am one of seven who makes messes <br/>
and consumes food.<br/>
<br/>
So we deal with kids calmly and with reason: everyone who lives <br/>
here helps. We all pitch in. No one is above another. And when <br/>
you earn money, have your own pad and your own belongings <br/>
that you purchased, you can run that home however you like. <br/>
While living here, you pitch in.<br/>
<br/>
Because we all do it, I&#39;ve never seen a child really balk. At times <br/>
they grumble... but hey! So do I. Still, they do their part and I <br/>
believe are in the end happier for being contributors, not just <br/>
consumers.<br/>

***How does your family do it?***<br/>
<br/>
My son didn&#39;t apply for a job here.&lt;g&gt;   He didn&#39;t even volunteer.   He<br/>
didn&#39;t get to choose to be born into a clean bedroom or a messy one. <br/>
I did the choosing. <br/>
<br/>
So, I have happily gone about taking care of my house when I wanted to<br/>
and he has grown up believing that cleaning is what you do when you need<br/>
or want something clean. <br/>
I&#39;m not a clean freak.  A clean sink isn&#39;t more important than a snowball<br/>
fight or a walk down to the creek, or a trip to the store for a Root<br/>
Beer.   But I do clean when the mood strikes me and I don&#39;t make my<br/>
family feel like I&#39;m laboring under some great chore for their benefit. <br/>
I clean up when I want to.  I model good clean up person behavior.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s ten and he shovels the sidewalk when it snows. <br/>
He takes the garbage out if he notices it&#39;s full.  He does dishes<br/>
sometimes and sweeps up if the contents of the litter pan seem to be<br/>
migrating.   If I bring clothes in from the line or the dryer and don&#39;t<br/>
get to them right away, he folds clothes.<br/>
And I think, because he&#39;s never been made to do chores when I do need<br/>
help and ask, he almost always says yes, and helps in whatever way I<br/>
need.   The few times he&#39;s said no he had a good reason.   Likewise, when<br/>
he needs help with something and asks me, I help. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s thoughtful about messes, and if he&#39;s made one in an area where the<br/>
rest of the family might be inconvenienced by it he cleans it up when<br/>
he&#39;s finished.   If he doesn&#39;t feel like cleaning up but the mess is in<br/>
my way, I clean it up.   He would do the same for me, and has.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t tell my husband he has to vacuum because he&#39;s part of the family<br/>
and it&#39;s his responsibility.  If I&#39;d like help with the vacuuming, I ask.<br/>
 If he can&#39;t do it, then I do it, or it waits.<br/>

<br/>
Not having lived the other side of this issue I can see how a person might <br/>
feel this way. But it&#39;s not true.<br/>
My kids actually care about helping out now, not because I make them, but <br/>
because it&#39;s their choice. And choosing to make their Moms life a little <br/>
easier is something they care about.<br/>
My expectations have also changed. The level of cleanliness that I enjoy is <br/>
not the same as what they are comfortable with. So I keep it to my level of <br/>
comfort and only ask for help where it makes sense. AND they do have the <br/>
option to say no, but typically I really do need help when I ask and they can <br/>
see that. Like picking up some things before we leave, or getting dishes to <br/>
the kitchen etc...<br/>
It&#39;s interesting, because the more I backed off, the more willing they were <br/>
to help when I asked for it. But I respect it when they say &quot;In a minute, <br/>
we&#39;re in the middle of something&quot;<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; How does yur family do it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We eat dinner together as a family, and my dh and I deal with dishes after<br/>
Tim goes off to his room for the evening.  When my husband is in town (which<br/>
isn&#39;t often enough!), after dinner is our family time.  I don&#39;t want to<br/>
waste it doing dishes.  He and I use the kitchen clean-up time to talk,<br/>
later at night, and that works for us.<br/>
<br/>
Tim and I get up in the morning when we like, but usually between about 7:30<br/>
and 9.  We eat when we get hungry.  Pajamas stay on until I feel like taking<br/>
a shower, or we need to get dressed to go out.  I don&#39;t think breakfast<br/>
tastes any different in day clothes than pj&#39;s.  Sometimes we eat breakfast<br/>
together, but often I&#39;m hungry first.  Tim eats more as the day goes on;<br/>
he&#39;s not big on breakfast anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
What difference does it make if the beds get made or not?  I always pull the<br/>
covers up on my bed because it gets used as an extra sitting place and I<br/>
don&#39;t like dirt in it.  Tim hardly ever makes his bed, but it&#39;s a loft and<br/>
generally only used for sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
I do the day to day cleaning and picking up, on and off throught the day.<br/>
My husband and I do the vacuuming and stuff together when possible, since<br/>
it&#39;s easier for one to vacuum and another to move furniture.  I clean the<br/>
bathroom.  My tolerance level for it being dirty is the lowest.<br/>
<br/>
Tim doesn&#39;t have chores, but he helps with a myriad of things, especially<br/>
the little jobs.  He tries to keep his toys reasonably neat, especially the<br/>
little lego pieces, because he knows I don&#39;t like to come into his room in<br/>
the night if I&#39;m afraid of stepping on one!  I reshelve the books he takes<br/>
out during the day while he gets read for bed at night because it&#39;s easier<br/>
for me, he gets frustrated trying to hold back the stacks and slide them in.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Army family housing, so the outdoor stuff is done for us.<br/>
<br/>
Does that help?  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>True, I&#39;m not arguing that dilemma, I face it myself. And I look at it like <br/>
this. <br/>
My children are learning to read, compute, write due to their efforts n <br/>
rather than mine, with my help as they request it. I apply that learning <br/>
principal to other areas such as what they wear, when they go to sleep, yadda <br/>
yadda yadda. So it applies to learning to be neat and clean. <br/>
So what do I do? Stop asking, make cleaning look like just another thing that <br/>
gets done in the day to day living, rather than the big deal I make it out to <br/>
be, encourage them to join in on the &quot;fun&quot; jobs, (windexing, dusting, cooking <br/>
or whatever) accept that my priority to clean is not their priority, and do <br/>
it myself.<br/>
Unfortunately at this stage (as I realized yesterday) I have been slipping <br/>
back and forth between trusting them to learn in their own time and way and <br/>
getting pissed off and yelling every other week or so about the condition of <br/>
the house and trying to make them fell guilty about not helping me. Yesterday <br/>
I understood that I was paralleling () learning to unschool. I lay off them <br/>
for a while, things start to calm down, I SLACK OFF MY CLEANING and BAM! the <br/>
house is a mess *I* am overwhelmed and the kids are getting yelled at. NOT <br/>
working.<br/>
So what have I decided to do about that? Well, some standards have to relax <br/>
first off. Second, I talked to Joe about the situation and told him WHY I <br/>
don&#39;t want to make the kids help, that then when given the CHOICE to help, <br/>
they will choose no, and third, If this is something that is important to me, <br/>
I&#39;ll treat it as such. LIke a hobby. I&#39;ve started to reread &quot;The Messies <br/>
Manual&quot; and will go back on Fly Lady. I&#39;m going to take baby steps and do <br/>
what I WANT to do and not worry about the rest. When I had that attitude <br/>
before, that my priorities are mine and not anyone else&#39;s, I was HAPPY to do <br/>
the cleaning. I enjoyed it, and loved to get up and make a cup of tea from my <br/>
clean teakettle, in a mug that was in the cabinet and washed.<br/>
Now, I&#39;m not advocating all the above to everyone, some people couldn&#39;t care <br/>
less! I feel this to be a priority because when MY house is cluttered and <br/>
messy and nothing can be found, it (the disorganization and clutter) seems to <br/>
worm it&#39;s way into my mind. I get disorganized in my thoughts, and if other <br/>
conditions are right, It leads to a horrible period of depression. So I need <br/>
to take care of myself, And keeping my house clean myself, rather than <br/>
waiting for others to pitch in, is one very important way for me to take care <br/>
of myself.<br/>
Whew, so many words for 7:15 am!<br/>

(Joe and I) finish our cleaning before going anywhere. If there are dishes <br/>
sitting in the sink, we need to finish them before going to a movie or the <br/>
grocery store or the bank.<br/>
Last night DH and I were cleaning the living room and Emily wanted to stop at <br/>
the grocery store before riding class, we lovingly and casually told her that <br/>
we planned on finishing the living room first so we may not have time but if <br/>
she helped a little we could get done faster. She chose to make a list so her <br/>
father could get the items while she was having her lesson.<br/>
She chose. That is the key for me. It all goes back to the underlying <br/>
philosophy of choice.<br/>
That is my goal in this part of life, that my children feel comfortable <br/>
making their choices.<br/>

people to cooperate with my idea that we should clean it up together.  Then I <br/>
realized that it was my idea and that I was the only one that thought that <br/>
way. I can&#39;t control other people. LOL.  So I changed my thinking.  I clean <br/>
when I want to or things are in my way and we all do the same.  My boys do <br/>
however have a general respect for cleanliness.  They don&#39;t leave food around <br/>
because they don&#39;t like that kind of mess etc.  It was so liberating to <br/>
change the way I saw house cleaning.  Now the clutter doesn&#39;t bother me.  <br/>
When it does I pick up a little.  If I want to clean up some toys the boys <br/>
were playing with several days ago I make sure to ask them first, who knows <br/>
they might be still playing with it.  <br/>

What if I decided that I needed to work out every day? Working out is much <br/>

my kids exercise? Or should I make it seem like I&#39;m having a good time and <br/>
it&#39;s not a hated thing to do?<br/>

Brilliant. I will not assume that if the kids won&#39;t do housework by <br/>
choice then it must fall to me to do it. Until we live independent of <br/>
each other, there needs to be cooperation in how we share this <br/>
space. We&#39;ve given our kids lots of space to determine how they <br/>
do their jobs, how they rotate those jobs and when they get them <br/>
done. But they will do them, or they won&#39;t be able to do the things <br/>
they enjoy. Just like me. Just like my dh.<br/>
<br/>
I have never liked cleaning. I grew up with a maid. I do it now only <br/>
because having an orderly home keeps us all sane, safe and <br/>
free to use our space without clutter and chaos. We&#39;ve shared <br/>
that vision with our kids, assigned them tasks and have listened <br/>
tp their ideas of how to make it work. They pitch in to make our <br/>
vision happen. We expect it.<br/>

don&#39;t have any value judgment attached to them.  They&#39;re all just tasks on a <br/>
list.  I can&#39;t demonstrate the idiocy of &quot;women&#39;s work&quot; if say &quot;that&#39;s your <br/>
job&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
My 20 yo cleaned up my 9 yo&#39;s room the other day.  I asked him to, because <br/>
the 9 yo was at baseball practice or something, and someone with toddlers was <br/>
coming over.  (That room is not a safe one for toddlers if it&#39;s messy).  He <br/>
didn&#39;t mind.  In general, though, there&#39;s an expectation of kindness and <br/>
consideration and folks should clean up after themselves based on that idea.  <br/>
But if they can&#39;t, and it needs to be done right away, someone else will.  <br/>

motivation to do so.  Part of living in relationship with other people is <br/>
meeting their needs because you love them.  I&#39;m saying give your children an <br/>
opportunity to see your needs and respond to them with love at the level of <br/>
their readiness.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Like I said before, I don&#39;t want my children just to help me, I want them <br/>

WANT to help me. It&#39;s a different goal. They currently don&#39;t want to. So what <br/>
<br/>
do I do?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There may be nothing you can do at this point.  But my goal is what I said <br/>
earlier.  Meeting each other&#39;s needs based on the relationship we are in.  It <br/>
is in constant flux.  I believe that if someone doesn&#39;t fully express their <br/>
needs (in context of age, place, time) then they are not fully participating <br/>
in a relationship.  They are not giving the other person full autonomy to <br/>
react and respond to their needs as they can and will.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s another area where respect for the whole person of the child can be <br/>
given, and can be beneficial to everyone in the relationship<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-251119935">Elissa, you said:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Like I said before, I don&#39;t want my children just to help me, I want <br/>
them to <br/>
WANT to help me. It&#39;s a different goal. They currently don&#39;t want <br/>
to. So what <br/>
do I do?<br/>
<br/>
Me:<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if there isn&#39;t a difference between &quot;wanting to&quot; and <br/>
&quot;being willing to.&quot; This is how I see it in our home. None of us <br/>
really wants to clean the bathrooms. I don&#39;t get a high off of <br/>
cleaning (some women do). But it needs to be done. We&#39;ve <br/>
discussed how to get it done. Lots of input from this <br/>
democratically run household.<br/>
<br/>
Some weekends it isn&#39;t feasible for some reason (a child stayed <br/>
up too late at a friend&#39;s, we have a basketball game, there&#39;s a <br/>
special program on TV) so the scheduled time to do it is altered, <br/>
or a kid swaps with someone else.<br/>
<br/>
But we aren&#39;t asking if someone &quot;wants to clean,&quot; we are <br/>
creating a routine that includes cleaning and are allowing for the <br/>
variances that go with living our lives. Everyone who participates <br/>
benefits and we&#39;ve sold our kids on this idea simply by having <br/>
the calm discussion and explanation of what will happen in this <br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like what I&#39;m hearing here is that everything needs to be <br/>
offered as optional. That seems to take the ideas beyond what <br/>
they are meant to achieve. The goal is to have children who can <br/>
honestly lead their lives from a position of power, internal <br/>
congruence and healthy participation in life. They don&#39;t have to <br/>
always ask themselves if what they are about to do is <br/>
pleasurable (which is what &quot;want to&quot; sounds like in my ears).<br/>
<br/>
Also, I don&#39;t see kids work as &quot;help.&quot; I never ask for help in that <br/>
sense. I say, &quot;Hey you left the milk and cereal out. It needs to be <br/>
put away.&quot; There is no request. No option. Just the calm <br/>
description of reality and I fully expect that the child will hop up <br/>
and take care of it.<br/>
<br/>
Why would I ask whether he wanted to or not? I don&#39;t understand <br/>
this and I&#39;m not trying to be dense. And I don&#39;t think I am creating <br/>
good results with a damaging philosophy. In fact, I feel I&#39;m <br/>
teaching my kids how to choose to participate in the running of a <br/>
household for the sake of others whether it pleases them in the <br/>
moment or not.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is flat out unhappy with his or her task, feels <br/>
overwhelmed with life, has a reason for not picking up after <br/>
lunch... I&#39;m all ears. But those ought to be exceptions, not the <br/>
norm, imho.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491331730">Exactly Elissa,<br/>
 <br/>
I just this morning had to go through the mess thing, again,  with my dh,<br/>
 <br/>
I kind-of went into like,  this is their learning environment,  they learn best when they are doing what they want to do,  if I am constantly picking up their things or harping on them to clean up they will never want to do anything.    They&#39;ll give up and just do things that don&#39;t make a mess,  not good in my opinion.        <br/>
 <br/>
Today we are going to start creating our museum,  going to have an art wall in our kitchen,  and I&#39;m searching through the house to find a table of some sort to put there other creations.       <br/>
 <br/>
We have never done something like this and they thought it was a cool idea.<br/>
 <br/>
I think its all in how we look at it, its the mind set.   Yet I know some days the mind set it good and positive and on others its down and negative.  I&#39;m working on trying to get my good and positive to outweigh the down and negative!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>True, I&#39;m not arguing that dilemma, I face it myself. And I look at it like <br/>
this. <br/>
My children are learning to read, compute, write due to their efforts n <br/>
rather than mine, with my help as they request it. I apply that learning <br/>
principal to other areas such as what they wear, when they go to sleep, yadda <br/>
yadda yadda. So it applies to learning to be neat and clean. <br/>
So what do I do? Stop asking, make cleaning look like just another thing that <br/>
gets done in the day to day living, rather than the big deal I make it out to <br/>
be, encourage them to join in on the &quot;fun&quot; jobs, (windexing, dusting, cooking <br/>
or whatever) accept that my priority to clean is not their priority, and do <br/>
it myself.<br/>
Unfortunately at this stage (as I realized yesterday) I have been slipping <br/>
back and forth between trusting them to learn in their own time and way and <br/>
getting pissed off and yelling every other week or so about the condition of <br/>
the house and trying to make them fell guilty about not helping me. Yesterday <br/>
I understood that I was paralleling () learning to unschool. I lay off them <br/>
for a while, things start to calm down, I SLACK OFF MY CLEANING and BAM! the <br/>
house is a mess *I* am overwhelmed and the kids are getting yelled at. NOT <br/>
working.<br/>
So what have I decided to do about that? Well, some standards have to relax <br/>
first off. Second, I talked to Joe about the situation and told him WHY I <br/>
don&#39;t want to make the kids help, that then when given the CHOICE to help, <br/>
they will choose no, and third, If this is something that is important to me, <br/>
I&#39;ll treat it as such. LIke a hobby. I&#39;ve started to reread &quot;The Messies <br/>
Manual&quot; and will go back on Fly Lady. I&#39;m going to take baby steps and do <br/>
what I WANT to do and not worry about the rest. When I had that attitude <br/>
before, that my priorities are mine and not anyone else&#39;s, I was HAPPY to do <br/>
the cleaning. I enjoyed it, and loved to get up and make a cup of tea from my <br/>
clean teakettle, in a mug that was in the cabinet and washed.<br/>
Now, I&#39;m not advocating all the above to everyone, some people couldn&#39;t care <br/>
less! I feel this to be a priority because when MY house is cluttered and <br/>
messy and nothing can be found, it (the disorganization and clutter) seems to <br/>
worm it&#39;s way into my mind. I get disorganized in my thoughts, and if other <br/>
conditions are right, It leads to a horrible period of depression. So I need <br/>
to take care of myself, And keeping my house clean myself, rather than <br/>
waiting for others to pitch in, is one very important way for me to take care <br/>
of myself.<br/>
Whew, so many words for 7:15 am!<br/>
