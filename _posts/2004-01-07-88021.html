You&#39;re right.  I absolutely was NOT thinking of testing (calm down, Holly <br/>
:-).<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t think your *someday* scenario is so far off, Sandra.  We already <br/>
have a significant number of teenagers who can be seen to be successful in <br/>
their various pursuits...writing, arts, historical reenactments, computers, etc., <br/>
etc., etc.  We can show just how socially adept our kids are compared to ps <br/>
kids (and even school-at-homers).  There are a lot of ways that what we do can <br/>
be evaluated from a sociological and psychological standpoint.  <br/>
<br/>
I just wish someone would do the legwork.<br/>

Oh well.<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want them to live to the research any more than I would want them <br/>
to study to a test. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it will never be proven statistically, just individually.   Maybe it <br/>
will be biographies fifty years from now that affect children who will be born <br/>
in 2070.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-356840857">This was forwarded to our local list today since we&#39;ve discussed this <br/>
subject as well. It&#39;s just more from the author&#39;s parents about the <br/>
view of unschooling expressed in the Washington Post article as well <br/>
as some other points they wanted to make. They gave permission to the <br/>
person they were writing to forward it to their list and from there <br/>
onward.<br/>
<br/>
********************************************<br/>
____________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Thank you for writing with your concerns about the<br/>
&gt; Washington Post article.<br/>
&gt; The article was troubling to Christopher and our<br/>
&gt; family as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The media, as I&#39;m sure you know, doesn&#39;t always<br/>
&gt; report things correctly. In<br/>
&gt; fact just last week a newspaper in Britain said that<br/>
&gt; Christopher wrote his<br/>
&gt; book while stuck in our &quot;ramshackle farmhouse&quot;<br/>
&gt; during Montana&#39;s three-month<br/>
&gt; blizzards. Right.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the first place, Christopher did not do an<br/>
&gt; interview with the Washington<br/>
&gt; Post. This was a reprint of an article that ran in<br/>
&gt; the Jewish World Review.<br/>
&gt; He did the interview many months ago and was perhaps<br/>
&gt; not as &quot;on his feet&quot; as<br/>
&gt; he should have been with his comments. From an<br/>
&gt; interview that may have<br/>
&gt; lasted 20 minutes, the reporter chose comments that<br/>
&gt; fit her purpose.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The use of the word &quot;unschooling&quot; was the<br/>
&gt; journalist&#39;s choice. Christopher<br/>
&gt; never mentioned unschooling by name and never would.<br/>
&gt; It is his firm belief<br/>
&gt; that the success of homeschooling by any method<br/>
&gt; depends on the efforts of<br/>
&gt; the parents or guardians. He espouses no method as<br/>
&gt; being better than the<br/>
&gt; other. His comments about families whose children<br/>
&gt; had little education was<br/>
&gt; based on true cases from this area. The parents in<br/>
&gt; these cases were either<br/>
&gt; too lazy or too caught up in their own endeavors to<br/>
&gt; give their children the<br/>
&gt; attention they needed. Not only did the children&#39;s<br/>
&gt; education suffer, but<br/>
&gt; other aspects of their lives did as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another point in this article was particularly<br/>
&gt; annoying, the mention of A<br/>
&gt; Beka. Over the years, Talita cobbled together<br/>
&gt; material from here and there.<br/>
&gt; We used many concepts of unschooling, along with<br/>
&gt; some workbooks, and lots of<br/>
&gt; hands-on projects designed to help our children<br/>
&gt; learn by tapping into their<br/>
&gt; current interests. We used the A Beka materials for<br/>
&gt; some math and spelling<br/>
&gt; worksheets because it was easier than writing out<br/>
&gt; problems by hand. We in no<br/>
&gt; way support the ideology of A Beka, either their<br/>
&gt; religious slant or their<br/>
&gt; curriculum. Unfortunately, Christopher mentioned<br/>
&gt; their name during the<br/>
&gt; interview, and the journalist took it further, to<br/>
&gt; mean that Christopher was<br/>
&gt; raised with it exclusively. This is far from the<br/>
&gt; truth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Christopher asked us to tell you that he is a strong<br/>
&gt; supporter of<br/>
&gt; homeschooling. He understands that life experience<br/>
&gt; is the ultimate teacher,<br/>
&gt; that parents and materials simply facilitate what<br/>
&gt; must come from within. He<br/>
&gt; and we send best regards to all homeschooling<br/>
&gt; families. We chose to<br/>
&gt; homeschool when it was unpopular and understand the<br/>
&gt; pressure from family,<br/>
&gt; friends, and society to school your children<br/>
&gt; conventionally. We know that<br/>
&gt; without homeschooling Christopher never would have<br/>
&gt; written Eragon or be in<br/>
&gt; the position he is in now. As homeschooling was the<br/>
&gt; right choice for us, we<br/>
&gt; also know that for many families public school is<br/>
&gt; the best or only option.<br/>
&gt; Our hope is that, whatever educational path is<br/>
&gt; taken, every child has the<br/>
&gt; chance to fulfill his potential and follow his<br/>
&gt; dream.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All the best,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; --<br/>
&gt; Kenneth and Talita Paolini </span></blockquote></div>
