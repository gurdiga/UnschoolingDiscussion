<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940960897"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;  I know live about 4 hours from you, near Tryon, NC&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t been able to catch up entirely on all the digests of the last day, <br/>
but I wanted to do a quick intro and tell Ann in NC that I&#39;m near Greenville, <br/>
SC, not far away. Also we&#39;re looking hard and heavy into moving up your way. <br/>
We want to move to Saluda which is right down the road from you. We have real <br/>
estate guides from up there coming out of our ears right now! It&#39;s probably a <br/>
pipe dream until our 18 year old gets out of college though :( Maybe we can <br/>
meet sometime? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been homeschooling my 8 year old son for a year now. I&#39;m didn&#39;t unschool <br/>
this year but I&#39;m so intrigued by it. My husband is supportive of <br/>
homeschooling but not of unschooling. He is an engineer so he insists that we <br/>
cover math every day. I love math myself and want my son to enjoy it so I <br/>
like working with him on it. Other than that we were pretty loose, but I <br/>
cannot claim the unschooling tag. We are taking a little summer break from <br/>
even the math right now and my son has delighted us by immediately wanting to <br/>
learn about Native Americans and ancient Egypt. If the summer continues like <br/>
this, perhaps my husband will look more favorably upon unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I also have two older children, daughters 18 and nearly 22. They weren&#39;t <br/>
homeschooled but now that they see how much fun their brother has, they wish <br/>
they had been. I never considered it when they were young since I thought <br/>
homeschooling could only be very structured and very religious, neither of <br/>
which we were. There are many many homeschoolers in Greenville but they are <br/>
nearly all fit that profile. (Greenville is the home of Bob Jones University, <br/>
known for very structured homeschooling materials) Since we don&#39;t want to <br/>
join a statement of faith homeschool group, we don&#39;t have too many homeschool <br/>
families to hang out with. I have met a few though and I&#39;d love to meet more.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about it for us. I&#39;m enjoying this list but I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll <br/>
ever catch up with all the mail!!<br/>
