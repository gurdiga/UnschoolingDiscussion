Just so you know, there are grammar and usage check programs...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726075311">I must agree with Lynn Turner regarding penmanship.  There is something<br/>
spiritual and special about the handwritten word.  I use a fountain pen to<br/>
write in my journal.  I find my mind relaxes more and opens up when I&#39;m<br/>
writing in this manner as opposed to sitting in front of the computer.<br/>
Another bonus is that I can take my pen and journal outside in the gazebo,<br/>
under a tree or by a soothing body of water, which I can&#39;t do with a<br/>
computer (well maybe with a laptop, but YKWIM!).  I also agree with whomever<br/>
said spelling is important.  This is one of my pet peeves, poor spelling.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is very good with grammar and sentence structure.  He attributes<br/>
that to a year spent in school in England. He says they were much more<br/>
particular about this than American schools.  He points out that there is no<br/>
&quot;grammar and usage check&quot; on computers so knowing this is important<br/>
regardless.  He is always amazed when he receives business correspondence<br/>
with poor grammar.  Things such as the misuse of &quot;your&quot; and &quot;you&#39;re,&quot; &#39;to&quot;<br/>
and &quot;too,&quot; etc.<br/>
<br/>
Melissa, your post regarding giftedness not mattering once we&#39;re grown up<br/>
was right on track.  However, I do feel there are some adults that do still<br/>
stand out as &quot;gifted.&quot;  These are the adults that make a difference in their<br/>
lives and the lives of others.  Many of them are still &quot;average Joes/Janes&quot;<br/>
but have that extra &quot;spark.&quot;  Yes, you can&#39;t tell who walked at 8 months and<br/>
who read at age 3 but you can tell who loves what they do and do it with a<br/>
passion and those that have a special skill or talent and use it to the best<br/>
of their ability and to do good works.  On the other hand, these &quot;gifted&quot;<br/>
adults may have been the kids in the remedial reading programs or labeled LD<br/>
or some such thing and grew to achieve above their label.  Just a thought.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting.  I find that a computer makes it much easier for me to<br/>
organize my thoughts and get them written down.  I often have several<br/>
different ideas at once, and I can just quickly make notes, and then refer<br/>
to them as I go.  I wouldn&#39;t do that in a handwritten journal.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes there is.  At least I have one.  I don&#39;t always agree with it, but it&#39;s<br/>
interesting.<br/>
