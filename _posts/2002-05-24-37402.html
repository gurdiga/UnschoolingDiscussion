Homeschooling in Kansas<br/>
What you need to know<br/>
• Unlike some states, Kansas does not specifically authorize &quot;home <br/>
instruction&quot; or &quot;home schooling&quot; by state statute. However, Kansas does <br/>
recognize Nonaccredited Private Schools.<br/>
• A nonaccredited elementary or secondary private school is one that <br/>
satisfies the state&#39;s compulsory school attendance laws, but which is not <br/>
accredited by the state board of education.<br/>
• Compulsory school attendance laws apply to children between the ages of 7 <br/>
and 18 (may be under 7 for children identified as handicapped). Every parent, <br/>
or person acting as parent, of children in that age group must require such <br/>
children to attend a public, private, denominational, or parochial school for <br/>
the duration of the school term. <br/>
• Nonaccredited schools are not required to employ teachers who are certified <br/>
by the state, but their courses must be taught by competent instructors, and <br/>
they must hold classes for a period of time which is substantially equivalent <br/>
to the time public schools are in session in the area in which the <br/>
nonaccredited school is located (at least 186 days of not less than 6 hours <br/>
per day, or 1116 hours per year for grades 1-11).<br/>
• Nonaccredited private schools are required by law to register the name and <br/>
address of the private elementary or secondary school with the state board of <br/>
education. Registration consists of completing a form provided by the state <br/>
showing the name and address of the school and the name and address of the <br/>
official custodian of the school&#39;s records. The act of completing the <br/>
registration form does not mean the nonaccredited school has been &quot;approved&quot; <br/>
by the state board of education as a &quot;school&quot; that satisfies the compulsory <br/>
school attendance law. <br/>
• No fee is charged for registration of a nonaccredited school.<br/>
• When a student transfers to a nonaccredited school, the school previously <br/>
attended must be notified by the parent/guardian that the student is changing <br/>
schools. If a student simply stops coming to school, the school is required <br/>
by law to report the student as truant.<br/>
• It is in the best interest of students attending nonaccredited schools that <br/>
accurate and complete records of their progress be kept. These records will <br/>
be needed if the student transfers to a public or an accredited school, or <br/>
applies for admission to a college or university.<br/>
• If a student transfers from a nonaccredited school to an accredited school, <br/>
the accredited school is not required to accept the transfer of credit. The <br/>
accredited school may find it necessary to test the student in order to make <br/>
a decision regarding the transfer of credit.<br/>
• Private schools are responsible for acquiring their own books and curriculum<br/>
 materials. Books may be purchased from private organizations, checked out <br/>
though the public library, or rented from the public school with district <br/>
approval. The public school is under no obligation to make books and <br/>
materials available to students attending other schools.<br/>
• No books, curriculum materials, guidelines, or technical assistance on <br/>
curriculum development are available from the State Department of Education <br/>
for nonaccredited schools.<br/>
• Private schools, including nonaccredited schools issue their own high <br/>
school diplomas. The state does not issue diplomas.<br/>
• Colleges and universities determine their own criteria for admission of <br/>
students who graduate from a nonaccredited school.<br/>
Kansas Statute 72-53,100 through 102<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
72-53,100. Nonaccredited private schools; pupil records; definitions. As used <br/>
in this act:<br/>
(a) &quot;Private elementary or secondary school&quot; means an organization which <br/>
regularly offers education at the elementary or secondary level and <br/>
attendance at which satisfies the compulsory school attendance laws of this <br/>
state, but which is not accredited by the state board of education.<br/>
(b) &quot;Pupil records&quot; means all records, files and data of pupils who are or <br/>
have been in attendance at a private elementary or secondary school.<br/>
(c) &quot;Official custodian&quot; means an officer or employee of a private elementary <br/>
or secondary school who is responsible for the custody and maintenance of <br/>
pupil records.<br/>
History: L. 1982, ch. 286, 1; July 1.<br/>
72-53,101. Nonaccredited private schools; registration of name and address <br/>
required; state board of education, administration and duties.<br/>
(a) The official custodian of every private elementary or secondary school <br/>
shall register the name and address of the private elementary or secondary <br/>
school with the state board of education.<br/>
(b) The state board of education shall administer the provisions of this act <br/>
and shall prepare and maintain a compilation of the registrations submitted <br/>
under subsection (a).<br/>
(c) Upon transfer of a pupil from a private elementary or secondary school to <br/>
a school district, an accredited nonpublic school, or another private <br/>
elementary or secondary school, the state board of education, upon request of <br/>
the school district, accredited nonpublic school, or other private elementary <br/>
or secondary school therefore, shall make available the registration of the <br/>
private elementary or secondary school from which the pupil transferred.<br/>
History: L. 1982, ch. 286, § 2; L. 1986, ch. 268, § 3; July 1.<br/>
72-53,102. Same purpose of registration requirement. The purpose of this act <br/>
is solely to make available to a school district, an accredited nonpublic <br/>
school, or a private elementary or secondary school to which a pupil <br/>
transfers, the name and location of the private elementary or secondary <br/>
school from which the pupil transferred so that request maybe made by the <br/>
transferee school district, accredited nonpublic school, or private <br/>
elementary or secondary school for the pupil’s records.<br/>
History: L. 1982, ch. 286, § 3; L. 1986, ch. 268, § 4; July 1.<br/>
SUMMARY - K.S.A. 72-53,100<br/>
Private Elementary and Secondary School Registration<br/>
K.S.A. 72-53,100 through 102 requires the official custodian of each private <br/>
elementary and secondary school to register the name and address of the <br/>
school with the State Department of Education. The State Department will <br/>
maintain a compilation of such registrations.<br/>
The purpose of the legislation is to make available to a school district or <br/>
accredited nonpublic school to which a pupil transfers from a private <br/>
elementary or secondary school, the name and location of such school so that <br/>
the school district or accredited nonpublic school may request the transfer <br/>
of the pupil’s records thereto.<br/>
<br/>
My first letter stated my name, address ... addressed the principal of Jacks <br/>
school and went on to say: This is my written notice that Jack Owens will not <br/>
be returning to ____ school next fall. We will continue to educate him at <br/>
home. Please send copies of his records and refund any balance in his lunch <br/>
account. Thank you for your time... Blah blah blah sincerely, Nancy <br/>
Edds-Owens <br/>
Short and to the point. At noon, I got a phone call from the principal asking <br/>
me to send her quote &quot;answers, and reasons as to why you would choose to do <br/>
something like homeschool, when Jack is so happy here.&quot; When I informed her I <br/>
had done all that was required by Kansas law in regard to truancy, and had <br/>
established my nonaccrediated private school 14 months ago when Moly turned <br/>
7, she then said &quot;Please for my own peace of mind, I would like to know the <br/>
reasons you are unhappy with ____ School.&quot; I told her I would consider it. <br/>
What follows is a copy of the letter I am still considering sending. <br/>
<br/>
May 24, 2002<br/>
<br/>
D_ S_ Principal<br/>
___ School ___ Ks<br/>
<br/>
Dear Mrs. S., <br/>
<br/>
This letter, although not required by law, is to inform you that Jack Owens <br/>
will not be returning<br/>
to ____ next fall. Like his Sister he will continue his education at home.<br/>
<br/>
I homeschool because I love my children & I believe that schools are <br/>
potentially dangerous to all<br/>
children&#39;s emotional & physical growth. I believe that schools cannot be <br/>
improved to the point<br/>
that I would want my children to continue an education therein. I believe <br/>
that children learn best<br/>
by following their own interests. I am strongly opposed to the peer <br/>
segregation practiced in classroom settings. Children separated by age <br/>
groups, deprived of the chance to interact with those outside their peer <br/>
group is the same as only being allowed to work at a job just for 35 year <br/>
olds. The fiction of school socialization is, in reality, full of rude <br/>
behaviors, bad attitudes, vulgar language, & worse the victimization by <br/>
bullies. Although Jack has only experienced these things on a mild scale, & <br/>
Jack (on his own) choose to go to school, I feel no compunction for him to <br/>
continue along this path throughout his young years. <br/>
<br/>
I would be in error if I did not take the time to say that even though my <br/>
beliefs about school<br/>
structure in general are as such, I found Mrs. L. to be an exceptional <br/>
teacher. Jack adored<br/>
her, & I am so happy he had her as his teacher this year. In all of the <br/>
teachers I have known<br/>
over the years, Mrs. L. is, by far, the very best, we hold her in great <br/>
esteem. I hope she<br/>
knows what a special person she is. <br/>
<br/>
I ask that you please forward all Jack’s school records (all test scores, <br/>
records of counselor visits,<br/>
& all notations. Etc.) to me as soon as possible. I also ask that any <br/>
remaining money in Jack’s<br/>
lunch account be returned along with his school records. I thank you for your <br/>
time. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
<br/>
Nancy Edds-Owens<br/>
<br/>
What do you all think? Sorry for the length! ~Nancy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763119577">Hi, Nancy.<br/>
<br/>
My initial gut reaction to your situation is that you might consider <br/>
sending the principal the letter you originally wrote, which is all you are <br/>
required to do.  If you really *want* to go into the kind of detail you put <br/>
into your revised letter, do it conversationally in a face-to-face, <br/>
UNofficial meeting (like over a cup of coffee in a diner at some mutually <br/>
convenient time).  I am speaking objectively and, of course, I do not know <br/>
anything about the principal, but I would not want to have those kinds of <br/>
strong opinions sitting around in black and white in some file waiting to <br/>
bite me on the back when I turn around sometime in the future.  I know that <br/>
sounds paranoid, but why put yourself in that kind of situation if you <br/>
don&#39;t absolutely have to?  The thing is, your letter is *probably* not <br/>
going to be the catalyst for some kind of dramatic change in the school <br/>
system.  So, what would be the point?<br/>
<br/>
Other folks may completely disagree with me.  That&#39;s just my take on it.  I <br/>
sure hope it is helpful.  BTW, big congratulations to you and to Jack and <br/>
to your family!<br/>

This they probably won&#39;t do. You can ask for copies, but not for the real <br/>
records. They&#39;ll only give them to another school following a direct request <br/>
from a counselor or principal at that other school.   And they might not give <br/>
you copies.<br/>
<br/>
BUT HEY!  You don&#39;t need them.  They would only make you unhappy.  Cut off <br/>
totally.  Let them keep their records.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I also ask that any <br/>
<br/>
remaining money in Jack’s<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Asking for the lunch money&#39;s fine, but if you tie it in with records it might <br/>
get lost.  I would ask separately.  And if it&#39;s not a significant amount, I <br/>
would cut that loss too, just to keep from having to interact anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I think you told them too much, and it&#39;s unnecessarily inflammatory.  But if <br/>
you&#39;re wanting to inflame them (a legitimate urge sometimes when you&#39;ve just <br/>
had enough and you think it might cause a change in them), then I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
want to stand in your way.  If, though, your motivation is to give them what <br/>
they asked for, which is some reason they can ponder or try to dispute, you <br/>
could make it way shorter and potentially more effective.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll send some technicality-stuff on the side, but wanted to put this out for <br/>
others to bounce off of and around, to help you decide what tone you <br/>
ultimately want to use.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132679352">Kansas homeschools are considered private schools. You can request records be <br/>
sent to you as a private school, not as a parent (parents have the right to <br/>
go to the school and look at the records and to get copies - at their own <br/>
expense, by the way).<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t a good policy, in general, to give schools more than they are <br/>
legally allowed to ask for -- and it is REALLY important in a private school <br/>
state, like Kansas, to be clear that you ARE just as legal a private school <br/>
as any other traditional private school.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Kansas compulsory attendance requirement can be satisfied at a public <br/>
school or at a &quot;private, denominational or parochial school,&quot; which also <br/>
includes homeschools. The homeschool, like other private schools, must meet <br/>
certain basic statutory requirements, such as &quot;competent instructor&quot; and <br/>
&quot;substantially equivalent&quot; period of time. For legal purposes, homeschools in <br/>
Kansas are considered nonaccredited private schools.&#39;&quot;<br/>

&gt; My initial gut reaction to your situation is that you might consider <br/>
&gt; sending the principal the letter you originally wrote, which is all you are <br/>
&gt; required to do.  If you really *want* to go into the kind of detail you put <br/>
&gt; into your revised letter, do it conversationally in a face-to-face, <br/>
&gt; UNofficial meeting (like over a cup of coffee in a diner at some mutually <br/>
&gt; convenient time).  I am speaking objectively and, of course, I do not know <br/>
&gt; anything about the principal, but I would not want to have those kinds of <br/>
&gt; strong opinions sitting around in black and white in some file waiting to <br/>
&gt; bite me on the back when I turn around sometime in the future.  I know that <br/>
&gt; sounds paranoid, but why put yourself in that kind of situation if you <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t absolutely have to?  The thing is, your letter is *probably* not <br/>
&gt; going to be the catalyst for some kind of dramatic change in the school <br/>
&gt; system.  So, what would be the point?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did send the original letter. I received a call from the principal this <br/>
afternoon, after she received it and she asked me to give her more <br/>
information on WHY I would want to take Jack out, since he is &quot;so happy <br/>
here.&quot; (her words not mine or Jack&#39;s!) I don&#39;t really want to go into the <br/>
detail in my second letter, and I definitely don&#39;t want anything I write to <br/>
come back to me! :O She was polite in her request, and I don&#39;t want to be <br/>
paranoid so I pushed the thought of ulterior motives out of my head. Sandra <br/>
sent me some wonderful syntax and grammatical suggestions which I have put to <br/>
use, but after reading what you all have to say on the matter, I think I will <br/>
ignore her request for more information and keep the second letter for myself <br/>
as something to read when I need to vent to myself! Or maybe I will tone it <br/>
waaayyy down, send it to her and hope it is enough for her. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-691795230">&lt;&lt;&quot;Please for my own peace of mind, I would like to know the<br/>
reasons you are unhappy with ____ School.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because of a number of reasons, I would be very hesitant to send anything at<br/>
all. It sounds to me as if she wants some reasuurance that she/her school is<br/>
not the reason. Just giving her a call or writing her a note (not a formal<br/>
letter), thanking her for her time and input over the past years and giving<br/>
some generic homeschooling reasons that they understand may be plenty. (The<br/>
reasons including ones such as, individualized attention, personalized<br/>
curriculums, moving at child&#39;s pace, and maybe even mentioning the<br/>
difficulties of working within a system that can&#39;t despite the best efforts<br/>
of well-intentioned educators yadda yadda yadda.)  I suggest staying as<br/>
NON-flammitory as possible, simply because it may give her a chance to think<br/>
about it if she can&#39;t take it personally. You could also recocommend a book<br/>
that gives good general reasons why people Homeschool, like &quot;The HS book of<br/>
Answers&quot;<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m paranoid but I can picture a casual conversation at lunch between<br/>
the Principal and her college friend who happens to work in the office that<br/>
handles HSing paperwork where she mentions her formal pupil&#39;s mom who is so<br/>
anti school and maybe pushing her own bad school memories onto another<br/>
generation, gee I hope she is capable of HSing because what theese parents<br/>
don&#39;t realize is how difficult it is to get these kids to read and hand in<br/>
their assignments, and My god! how will this poor boy make any friends? It&#39;s<br/>
so sad.<br/>
&lt;whew&gt; long sentance.<br/>

necessary, she seems to be asking out of pure bafflement and it might be a<br/>
&quot;teaching moment&quot; that could enlighten her ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could say something like:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve come to understand that in terms of meeting society&#39;s need to get as<br/>
many people educated as possible that mass education, like factory produced<br/>
bread, is a good idea. But in terms of meeting an individual&#39;s needs, an<br/>
education that is specifically tailored to the individual, like bread baked<br/>
with favorite ingredients at home, is much more beneficial. Wouldn&#39;t most<br/>
teachers&#39; ideal classroom be a handful of students who truly want to be<br/>
there to learn? Wouldn&#39;t most teachers prefer to help eager students learn<br/>
at their own pace in their own style than to have to teach everyone the same<br/>
thing from a standard curriculum?<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that my son&#39;s apparent happiness at school was a testament to his<br/>
character in choosing to make the best out of something he had no choice<br/>
about doing or not doing. Now that he does have a choice between going to<br/>
school, he is eagerly and happily choosing to stay home. Should he change<br/>
his mind, he now knows that school is one of a number of options for him to<br/>
choose from and if he returns to school it will be because he is choosing to<br/>
be there and his attitude will then be an honest reflection of his feelings.<br/>

<br/>
Well, I agree with you entirely.  Putting the negatives of school down <br/>
on paper sounds like such a helpful thing to do for the principal. But <br/>
in reality it may give them reason and ammunition to fight you about <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing I did like was the emphasis on age group segregation and <br/>
socialization with those of other ages.  But overall, I think that <br/>
unless I was absolutely certain of the school sytem, I would avoid <br/>
sending anything in writing.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not Joyce, and I hope nobody minds my chiming in here, but even though <br/>
the letter got her point across very well, it could be perceived by the <br/>
school system as an attack.  She was essentially telling the school system <br/>
that they stink at what they do, and that&#39;s why homeschooling is a better <br/>
choice for her family.  While she is absolutely right, giving this kind of <br/>
information to the school system can come back to haunt a person in ways we <br/>
may not imagine.  In fact, I think that when we vent in general we have to <br/>
be very careful about what we say, how we say it, and to whom.  Putting <br/>
things in writing can be very risky because you don&#39;t know our words will <br/>
end up and how they could be used.  The words we write can even be <br/>
excerpted and used in ways we never intended.<br/>
<br/>
As someone did mention, it is good to speak out and speak our truth, but <br/>
this may not be the venue for that.<br/>
<br/>
I hate to sound so paranoid, but in a society where children are frequently <br/>
taken by the *authorities* from their loving and safe homes because parent <br/>
chose to be different than society&#39;s norms, I think we have to be vigilant <br/>
and watch our backs.  Certainly, writing a letter that&#39;s filled with <br/>
negatives about the school system can be seen as putting one&#39;s neck right <br/>
out there.<br/>
<br/>
I liked very much what Joyce&#39;s letter had to say because it was completely <br/>
positive about homeschooling and not negative about the school <br/>
system.  Having said that, I still would be reluctant to provide the school <br/>
system with more than is legally required.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really not a paranoid person, even though I really sound paranoid <br/>
(hmmm... I&#39;ve said that, I think, three times now!  ;-) ); I&#39;m just <br/>
cautious.  And, I&#39;ve heard enough horror stories to make me want to keep my <br/>
head below the radar, if you know what I mean.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you Dee, ( & everyone!!!) I think that is exactly the issue here. The <br/>
principal of Jack&#39;s school seems like a very nice person, I *think* (my first <br/>
problem &lt;g&gt;) that she just wants to know *everything* when it comes to her <br/>
school and may even take it as a slight that I would consider bringing Jack <br/>
home. (even though at the beginning of the year one of the first things I <br/>
told his teacher was that we hsed the kids and even though Jack convinced us <br/>
he wanted to go he would only be there this year) <br/>
My husband says that I need to learn to say *NO* more often. He asked if I <br/>
had sent the required notice in writing that Jack wouldn&#39;t be back next year <br/>
to avoid the truancy monster and, if I had done so, then I should call <br/>
sometime next week and politely state that we have always hsed the kids, our <br/>
private school affidavit has been on file with the KBOE for 14 months, and <br/>
will continue to do so. That the only reason Jack went to school this year <br/>
was because we felt this was something he needed to work through himself to <br/>
understand he wasn&#39;t missing what he thought he was going to be missing. <br/>
(Darin also said if I really felt the need to say *something* I could state <br/>
that this was all just an experiment in what we call the plight of Americas <br/>
failed social experiment, but I don&#39;t think I will &lt;eg&gt;) He said I should say <br/>
that we enjoyed Jacks teacher and think the world of her, and wish the school <br/>
continued success, politely say good bye before she could interject much more <br/>
and hang up. Which is what many of you also suggested in not so many words <br/>
and I thank you all! <br/>
My second problem is that I tend to go overboard when it comes to things like <br/>
this. I sent the woman the required letter, she asked for more and instead of <br/>
just *warming her coffee up* I brewed a whole &#39;nother pot!<br/>
<br/>
*On a side note*  Sandra, I used your suggestions and the letter is now much <br/>
stronger in context. I have printed it out and filed it away for that day <br/>
when the kids are driving me crazy and I need something to explain to me why <br/>
it is that I do this crazy thing I do! &lt;bwg&gt; <br/>
