<div id="ygrps-yiv-464607949">Hi all!  I just joined, and have been enjoying reading your posts.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice to know other mothers (and fathers? any on this list?) are <br/>
thinking along the same lines as me about so many things.  I would like to <br/>
add my recommendation to that of Karen&#39;s concerning the book &quot;Mother <br/>
Nature&quot;--I almost sent out a recommendation for it myself!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I have a 6yo son who just finished Kindergarten at a small <br/>
progressive private school which seemed nice enough at the beginning of the <br/>
year, but at the end of the year we are not so satisfied--they seem to <br/>
think he&#39;s &quot;not ready for 1st grade&quot; and suggested testing.  For the past <br/>
year, even while he seemed to be having fun at school, I&#39;ve been doing all <br/>
sorts of reading about unschooling philosophy, and Sudbury valley schools <br/>
and other things about trusting kids to learn what they need to learn, when <br/>
they need to learn it.  In my heart, I&#39;m totally convinced, but dh is <br/>
not.  In fact, he is in the process of getting a PhD in Political Science <br/>
at MIT, and so he is highly invested in &quot;teaching&quot; and also in the idea of <br/>
preparing children to be good citizens (how can you trust them to learn <br/>
what they should learn to be well-informed voters?)<br/>
<br/>
I think because we are not so satisfied with our son&#39;s school, I may have a <br/>
good chance at convincing dh to homeschool (or unschool?), but even I have <br/>
my moments of doubt about whether I should try for this.  The thing is, our <br/>
son would only be in this school for one more year, and then we will be <br/>
moving.  He has a group of friends from school that he is really close to, <br/>
and he says he&#39;s looking forward to going back in the fall (although there <br/>
are times when he clearly seems anxious about it).  He was a Kindergartener <br/>
in a K-1 classroom last year.  Next year he would be either a 1st-grader <br/>
who was pretty much doing K-level work, or a Kindergartener while all his <br/>
friends from last year are 1st-graders.  I just don&#39;t think this atmosphere <br/>
would be good for him, and the only way I could possibly justify it for <br/>
myself is because my son is highly social and loves being around his <br/>
friends, and because it would only be for one more year.  I should note <br/>
that we haven&#39;t yet talked to our son about the possibility of him being a <br/>
K next year, or the fact that he seems to be behind his classmates <br/>
(although I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s aware of that).  I&#39;m not really sure if or <br/>
how that would change his opinions, but I would like to be clear within <br/>
myself first, about what are acceptable options to me, before we talk to him.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for reading this far!  I would appreciate any thoughts or ideas <br/>
from the members of this list.  Have any of you been in similar <br/>
situations?  Sometimes I feel silly for thinking that the school year would <br/>
be &quot;damaging&quot; to him, and other times I cannot imagine bringing myself to <br/>
take him there ever again.  Any advice?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

When boys fail first grade or kindergarten (and LOTS of them do fail) they <br/>
are branded for life, even if only in their own minds.  Downplay that to the <br/>
point that he just forgets all about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091981921">Follow your feelings, I wished I had,  your the mother and his first teacher, or learner, you know your child better than anyone else.   You didn&#39;t say where you were moving, but what about the possibility of homeschooling or unschooling wherever you move too.  Good Luck what every you do.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ask him how well he thinks the graduates of public schools have been <br/>
prepared to be good citizens and well-informed voters.  In my opinion, the <br/>
only ones who have live in families that discuss things a lot.  And <br/>
homeschooling families usually do that.<br/>

so, you can let him know that you&#39;ll arrange all the after-school play <br/>
dates he wants.  Then you could also find a homeschooling group to get <br/>
involved with, hoping that he&#39;ll make some homeschooled friends.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he says he&#39;s looking forward to going back in the fall (although there<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does he know he has the option to stay home? If someone assumes they have no<br/>
choice about something, then it&#39;s natural to pump up the good parts and<br/>
downplay the bad parts in order to survive it.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s a natural part of life for there to be good points and bad points<br/>
of every choice we make.<br/>
<br/>
Invite the kids from school over so he can play with them. It&#39;s really what<br/>
he wants to do with them anyway! He only thinks school is where they need to<br/>
meet and only thinks what little social time they have at school is all<br/>
that&#39;s available to him. So open the box for him and let him see the<br/>
possibilities :-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How much weight would he give to your opinion on some matter of Political<br/>
Science that you&#39;d picked up from casual conversation?<br/>
<br/>
If his opinion about learning is going to have any weight then he&#39;ll need to<br/>
do his homework as you&#39;re doing. An opinion on growing vegetables from<br/>
someone whose only experience with vegetables is what he picks up at the<br/>
grocery store isn&#39;t going to be worth much ;-) Having your learning handed<br/>
to you and being warped by learning that&#39;s always been hard work doesn&#39;t<br/>
equate with experience with learning on your own in freedom.<br/>
<br/>
One book that men generally seem to like is David Gutersons Family Matters:<br/>
Why Homeschooling Makes Sense.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156300001/qid=1026127890/sr=8-1/ref=">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156300001/qid=1026127890/sr=8-1/ref=</a><br/>
sr_8_1/103-9892368-1579018<br/>
<br/>
Another really good one is Frank Smith&#39;s The Book of Learning and<br/>
Forgetting.<br/>
<br/>
Also John Holt&#39;s books. His early ones involve ways to reform schools but<br/>
the later ones have him realizing the futility of it.<br/>
