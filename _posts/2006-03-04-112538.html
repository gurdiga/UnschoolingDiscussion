Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new here and diving into unschooling recently (because my children<br/>
are very young, 2 and 1).  I am learning so much.  As I sink into the<br/>
unschooling way of thinking, I notice the thing that I get hung up on<br/>
inside myself is a question of trusting my appetites (and by extension,<br/>
trusting my childrens&#39;).  I mean, I have spent my whole adult life<br/>
moderating my desire for, say, junk food, tv, spending too much on<br/>
books, spending too much in general, chocolate, etc. and here in this<br/>
unschooling life it would seem that such restraints are not encouraged.<br/>
Go with the joy, the pleasure, the abundance of the world, etc. The idea<br/>
of letting loose the restraints on myself is a bit scary, I notice.  On<br/>
the other hand, I totally trusted that my baby&#39;s every desire was RIGHT<br/>
and should be filled as best I could-whatever the baby enjoyed was good<br/>
for her.  But it would seem that I believe that at some point between<br/>
baby and grown up, everything baby/person enjoys isn&#39;t good anymore.<br/>
I&#39;m just examining these as-yet-not-very-clearly-thought-through beliefs<br/>
I seem to have.  Do y&#39;all feel you trust your children&#39;s desires<br/>
implicitly?  Some are easy to trust, of course, but others-the ones I<br/>
have learned to moderate in myself like tv or sugar-are less easy to<br/>
trust.  However, it occurs to me as I&#39;m writing this that perhaps the<br/>
difference is that I am the one monitoring and moderating my own<br/>
desires, not someone else doing it for me. Perhaps you allow your<br/>
children to learn to moderate themselves by letting them see what<br/>
doesn&#39;t work for them (by, say, eating too much chocolate and noticing<br/>
the effect?).  So then, maybe the parent&#39;s role becomes, not to moderate<br/>
the appetites of the child, but to encourage self-awareness as the child<br/>
explores so she can learn what her own limits are?<br/>
Sorry I&#39;m rambling all over here, I&#39;m just working it around in myself,<br/>
trying it on this way and that.  I would love to read any thoughts y&#39;all<br/>
might have on this or pointing out where my reasoning may be going<br/>
astray.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for so much generous sharing of your lives,<br/>
Maya<br/>
