&lt;&lt;   You are now implying that the rights and <br/>
 freedoms my children have are not real.   What gives you basis to make that <br/>
 judgement?  Because they have to ration thier time on the PC? Or finish <br/>
thier <br/>
 chores before they watch TV?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because you put the terms rights and freedoms in quotes, which indicates the <br/>
way you felt about it, not someone else.<br/>
And it&#39;s not really freedom to be made to do something before you watch tv. <br/>
It&#39;s ok if that&#39;s what you choose to do, but just don&#39;t call it freedom.<br/>
