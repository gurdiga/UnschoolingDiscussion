<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379409961">My goodness! I have been trying all night to get caught up<br/>
and have not quite gotten there yet. But I wanted to jump <br/>
in really quick and give some of my impressions as an &quot;older&quot;<br/>
newbie (LOL! is there such a thing? I have been reading here<br/>
for a little over 8 months now I guess).<br/>
<br/>
Basically when I first joined, I loved hearing the ideas, most <br/>
spoke to what I believed in my heart. But they seemed scary. So I<br/>
read. And listened to lots of discussions like these (which to<br/>
be honest with you I have learned lots from). I definitely got<br/>
defensive from time as things that I did were pointed out as<br/>
being controlling (restricting tv, sweets, etc). After all I <br/>
was one of the most relaxed/non-controlling moms I knew...I<br/>
was definitely not controlling! But then I realized that no<br/>
one was saying that I was a bad mom...just that by restricting<br/>
my kids in these ways I was being controlling. I became less<br/>
defensive and decided that I was comfortable with the few<br/>
restrictions that I had. I kept reading and more and more<br/>
I started getting *un*comfortable with these restrictions. So<br/>
I started lifting them.  I still did not completely get it<br/>
and hit some bumps here and there (with me and my comfort level).<br/>
I posted a little but was definitely worried about the responses<br/>
I might get. Maybe because I knew that I did not get it<br/>
completely. I got some good advice and had a few &quot;aha&quot; moments<br/>
and went back to reading. <br/>
<br/>
One thing that I found is that even if I did not have the <br/>
courage to post, I still learned from reading what everyone<br/>
else was posting. Usually there would be a discussion about<br/>
my concerns at sometime or another.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I feel like I would have the courage to post and I think <br/>
that is because I have seen wonderful answers to posts that <br/>
are genuinely looking for help to get past their fears. And that<br/>
is where I am. :o) The key is to keep from getting defensive...<br/>
hard to do sometimes when you are talking about your own <br/>
parenting and kids. But I do believe that no one here makes it<br/>
personal. It is about the ideas, not the person.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents...<br/>
