<div id="ygrps-yiv-184521674">I just wanted to steer anyone who is looking for some guidance or direction on Unschooling, read through the Homeschooling links on Todd&#39;s web site.  I just read through the first four(although I&#39;ve read through 2 before) and I am re-energized. <br/>
<br/>
I think it is so easy to fall away from the simpleness that unschooling is.  And it is so helpfull to read others opinions and thoughts.  I especially relate to the first article in this link, Protest, Gonna do some printing out,  that is OK right?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Todd!  And I&#39;m back to reading!<br/>
