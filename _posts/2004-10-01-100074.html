<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108310675">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Wasn&#39;t there an article in one of Gatto&#39;s(?) books about playing guns.  I&#39;m going way back in a faint memory so forgive me if I butcher it.  I think it talks about &quot;awareness&quot; and the adrenaline rush and the &quot;Aha&quot; moment of getting &quot;shot&quot;.   The acceptance that you were &quot;dead&quot; or &quot;caught&quot; (per the rules) defined who you were. The &quot;playing fair&quot; was an important social issue.   Don&#39;t know if this makes sense, I am going try to hunt it down.  I thought it made a great point.<br/>
<br/>
Another side question?  Does anyone know where all of the cool Nerf guns went?  We bought a few, 10 plus years ago.  DH had them at work and had cubicle wars occasionally (bunch of very nonviolent engineers : ).  They even initiated each new employee, including the new boss, with a surprise barrage of foam missiles.  Very cool group.  Anyway, he has changed jobs and brought them home, but we need more for all kids to share.  The ones I find out there now are so lame.<br/>

WHOA!!!<br/>
<br/>
Shooting FLAMING marshmallows!?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just keeping that thought in mind for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
Once in the long ago some of us tried to shoot a flaming marshmallow on the <br/>
end of an arrow.   That can go in the Thinking Physics questions.  (BTW,  I <br/>
tried to order that book today but someone else must have in the same moment, <br/>
because I got a refund notice from Amazon a few hours later.  I don&#39;t want a <br/>
refund, I want the book!!)<br/>
<br/>
So...   The tent across the meadow received (found the next day) a sticky <br/>
target-tipped arrow.  Sticky and stuck in mountain dirt, so kind of <br/>
dirt-encrusted, and sticky.   The marshmallow had landed, still flaming, right at our feet.<br/>
<br/>
Huh.<br/>
<br/>
But if there had been a little collar, like dogs wear after surgery, maybe <br/>
the marshmallow would&#39;ve stayed on!  But the arrow would&#39;ve been a bit impeded, <br/>
aerodynamically speaking, by a marshmallow-sized dog collar.<br/>

We saw some like that at a craft fair, and Will really wanted to buy a lot  <br/>
of them to bring to the Live & Learn Conference and play war games.  I  <br/>
couldn&#39;t afford that, at $5 each.  So, we bought a 3/4&quot;x 10&#39; piece of PVC  pipe for <br/>
$1.38, cut it into 12&quot; lengths, and brought those instead.<br/>
 <br/>
Marty Dodd and Jake & Sam Ohman, Will and MY MOTHER got  caught playing <br/>
marshmallow war in the hallway outside our room.  My  mother will never forget that <br/>
bit of fun she hasn&#39;t had in a long long  time.  She tells everyone it was <br/>
one of the highlights of her trip to  Boston.  Sandra, would you please pass <br/>
that on to Marty?  I know he  had fun, too, because he told me.  But she didn&#39;t <br/>
even play like that when  *I* was a kid.<br/>

<br/>
When and where is the next live and learn conference? Is it going to <br/>
be on the east coast again? We live about an hour from Columbia SC, <br/>
and about 3 hours from ATlanta, GA. I really think it would do both <br/>
my husband and me some good to be around other people who have been <br/>
unschooling longer than we have. I get it more than he does, but he <br/>
really wants me to sit down and work math problems and focus on <br/>
getting Breandan to read. Much more like school at home that is what <br/>
is going to happen. I just don&#39;t think he gets it, and I think being <br/>
around others who do things the way I want to, would help. <br/>
