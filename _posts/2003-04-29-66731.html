<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636299378">When I first read about unschooling, I thought. HEY, this is perfect.. this <br/>
is ME, this is my family..  I hadn&#39;t taken my kids out of school yet and I <br/>
was just looking around, gathering information, trying to decide which path <br/>
to take.   I understood it.   I think having children in public school and <br/>
seeing how it did NOT work, made it easy for me to say. OH YEAH, that sounds <br/>
like a much better approach.   The whole &quot;educational&quot; aspect of unschooling <br/>
was never a question or a concern to me.   Now, it is  a concern for everyone <br/>
else in my family ( that does not home/unschool).  From my own 16 yo son to <br/>
my parents and of course, my laws, I have gotten nothing but grief, <br/>
questioning, condemnation, and suspicion of my sanity.   But, that has <br/>
improved with time, they don&#39;t rag on me nearly as much as they did.  I guess <br/>
they just realized I was not giving in to thier pressure.    <br/>
<br/>
What was harder to grasp was some of the parenting approaches that most <br/>
unschoolers (on this list) strongly uphold as the one, best, only way to <br/>
parent children.  All the chores/bedtimes/TV/games/eating stuff.    I&#39;ve said <br/>
before, about 90% of them make good sense to me and they are right in line <br/>
with the way I have always parented my children.  But some of the stuff that <br/>
I struggled with became a bone of contention on this group as I tried and <br/>
tried to figure out how to &quot;do it right&quot;.  Well, I finally just gave up.on <br/>
trying to suit the folks on this list, and I just followed my own instincts.  <br/>
I thought, afterall, I was doing the same thing with my own family and <br/>
friends.. People who love and care about me and my children, I took thier <br/>
thoughts about how I was raising my children with a grain of salt, because I <br/>
felt in my  heart I knew my own children better than anyone else.  <br/>
<br/>
The best thing I have learned about unschooling is to just enjoy it.  It&#39;s <br/>
not nearly as complicated as some folks make it out to be.  It IS just living <br/>
your life, period.  Like there is no such thing as school ( stolen from Ned <br/>
Vare.. :-)  ..I don&#39;t worry about math.  I just don&#39;t.. period.   I don&#39;t <br/>
worry about reading or writing or penmanship .. or history or any other <br/>
&quot;subject&quot;..  It was very easy for me to let go of those worries because they <br/>
were so exhausting and stressful and just DIFFICULT to live with when my kids <br/>
were in school.  Those kinds of things never meant nearly as much to me as <br/>
they did to the school or the teacher.. But, dang it, they just wouldnt leave <br/>
me alone about it.. lol.   Now, when I hear my neices and nephews complaining <br/>
about doing thier homework, thier math, thier spelling and phonics.. I want <br/>
to shout  YAYYYYYY&gt;&gt; NA NA NA NA NA. .. we don&#39;t have to do that!!  It is a <br/>
tremendous relief to not have hear all about EOG&#39;s and test results and blah <br/>
blah blah.. <br/>
<br/>
I see my children learning every day.  JP had not picked up a pencil in over <br/>
3 months.  Then on Easter he picked me some flowers and he wrote me a note <br/>
that said.  &quot;Mommy, I love you, I want you to have these for a Happy Easter, <br/>
love, Jon.  I thought Anna had written it for him, but he has written it all <br/>
by himself. . The last time he wrote anything, it was barely readable.. Now, <br/>
his letters were just about perfectly formed and his handwriting was much <br/>
improved.    I told my husband, &quot;look at JP&#39;s letter he wrote to me, his <br/>
handwriting has really improved ( not within earshot of JP).  DH said.. yeah, <br/>
I bet it would look exactly the same if he had to write his spelling words 5x <br/>
each every week, write 2 stories every week, plus 10 sentences with his <br/>
spelling words.. PLUS all the worksheets he had to fill out.  Heck, it may <br/>
not even be as good since he fought us tooth and nail over doing his school <br/>
work.   His improved handwriting ( by osmosis..lol) is just one the many many <br/>
things I see blossoming in my children, and it&#39;s wonderful to be so much a <br/>
part of thier lives.  <br/>
<br/>
OH.. about non-stop gaming.. That was very difficult for me too.   Not that I <br/>
really cared if they played all the time, just that it caused so much <br/>
conflict between my boys.  So many broken controllers, so much frustration <br/>
and &quot;sharing&quot; arguements, it was indeed hard to see how all of that could be <br/>
&quot;good&quot; for anyone.  But, I continued to let them play.  Ethan broke the 4th <br/>
set of controllers on the Xbox.   They went through 3 sets of controllers on <br/>
the N64.. They were down to one last controller that they had to share on the <br/>
N64, and then they just lost interest in the games.   Not a word from me.. <br/>
not a restriction ( well, except I couldnt continue to buy controllers every <br/>
week, they had to wait til the funds became available).   Maybe it just got <br/>
warm enough outside for them to find other things to do.  Maybe they got <br/>
tired of fighting and breaking things.. Maybe they reached the levels in <br/>
thier games that they wanted to.   Maybe they got tired of sitting in food <br/>
crumbs and spilled drinks all day.. I don&#39;t know, but they havent played a <br/>
game in almost a month.   They haven&#39;t mentioned it, asked about it, or even <br/>
acted like they know video games exist.   Now, who knows, next week, they may <br/>
start in again with the games, want new controllers, new games, etc.. and if <br/>
they do, I will do my best to comply ( financially speaking)  But, I can say, <br/>
honestly, my boys are living proof that if given the opportunity to play <br/>
games  as much as they want.. They will NOT play them 24/7 for the rest of <br/>
thier lives.. For mine, it was just about 3 mos.  :-)  Which, in the whole <br/>
scheme of things, is really not long at all<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-284789050">wow. I am SO GLAD you read this. I didn&#39;t have much time to click on <br/>
every link here this evening (hubby&#39;s gonna kick me off soon, and <br/>
katie wants to play) so yours is the first I chose.<br/>
<br/>
what PERFECT timing! especially this part:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>one of the things I&#39;ve had a difficult time &quot;deschooling&quot; has been <br/>
handwriting. Being a piano player, I know that practice is needed in <br/>
order to get the neural connections to be at a reflex level, in order <br/>
to play well. I was thinking the same thing about the writing: lots <br/>
of practice in order to form letters well...but Robby&#39;s handwriting <br/>
looks just like a 10 year old public schooled kid we know, and I KNOW <br/>
Robby has had ONE TENTH the writing practice of a 4th grade kid in <br/>
public school. <br/>
<br/>
anyway. Excellent post, teresa. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Peace, HeidiC</div>

You are so right about the handwriting thing.  When I really thought about <br/>
it.. I realized, writing is a small motor skill, those muscles and skills can <br/>
be just a easily ( if not MORE easily) developed doing things kids enjoy <br/>
doing.. Like playing with legos, coloring, playing video games.   Its like <br/>
magic.. VOILA, their handwriting improves!.. <br/>
<br/>
Now, a disclaimer.. lol.  Some folks never have good handwriting no matter <br/>
how much they &quot;practice&quot;, or exercise their fine motor skills.   My <br/>
husband&#39;s, Landon&#39;s, and Ethan&#39;s handwriting SUCKS big time.  Thier <br/>
handwriting all looks very similar.  It is labored and exhausting for them to <br/>
write.  But, thats OK. thats what keyboards are for :-).. Landon can type <br/>
close to 100 wpm with few mistakes.<br/>

What an awsome post!  I have been wrestling with this issue.  We are <br/>
new to homeschooling and unschooling.  My son went to preschool <br/>
pretty much at his leisure since I knew he would not continue to ps <br/>
next year.  When he was at home, I crammed handwriting books down his <br/>
throat, poor kid!  This kid will not want to look at any form of <br/>
workbook for the next few years, and you know what I am OK with that <br/>
because there are better ways!!  Anyway, once I let go of those this <br/>
little &quot;schooled&quot; voice kept saying, &quot;he needs to learn to write!&quot;.  <br/>
Finally, the light bulb went off and I realized that this kid has <br/>
never been into drawing or artsy things, certainly never writing for <br/>
more than a few minutes if that.  Did I really think that because I <br/>
decided he was going to learn to write, that he would just like it <br/>
and be good at it, never mind the fact that he is young and still <br/>
lacking in small motor control!!  DUH to me!!  Your post came at just <br/>
the right time for me to realize it is not the writing but the small <br/>
motor control which he will get in other ways.  Now, he occasinally <br/>
will take me up on one of my offers to write something, i.e. a <br/>
grocery list, a ltter to his cousin.  It is rare and I accept his &quot;no <br/>
thank you&quot; with a smile.  When he does accept I watch for any <br/>
frustration if he tries for too long.  But, I have learned and am <br/>
learning that it is alright if he is not ready.  Thank you for a <br/>
great post that reminded me sometimes we are so caught up in the <br/>
details we forget the bigger picture!<br/>
