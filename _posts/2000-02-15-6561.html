<br/>
that&#39;s the thing about &#39;rules&#39; they never work for everyone and that&#39;s the<br/>
beauty of unschooling, to know your child (as well as yourself) and help<br/>
them develop in ways that lead to happiness not rebellion etc.  it&#39;s nice<br/>
to find what works and when you do it is so much fun:)<br/>

&gt; &gt;       Just to add to this discussion.....my 13yo son&#39;s best<br/>
&gt; &gt;      friend is only allowed one hour of what his parents deem<br/>
&gt; &gt;      &quot;screen time&quot;.  In other words, one hour of either computer,<br/>
&gt; &gt;      nintendo, TV, or gameboy per day.  My son has free access to<br/>
&gt; &gt;      all of these things.  My son&#39;s friend NEVER wants to be at<br/>
&gt; &gt;      home....always wants to come over here....and he marvels at<br/>
&gt; &gt;      how much &quot;fun&quot; we all seem to have together.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; hi,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; we find that if you give free access, be it to tv, sugar, whatever it<br/>
&gt; &gt; no longer rules their life and they tend to make better decisions.<br/>
&gt; &gt; just a thought<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately that doesn&#39;t work with every kid though &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>
&gt; My son is the exception to that rule. I can trust him to govern himself<br/>
&gt; with almost everything else in his life except that TV.<br/>
&gt; He would literaly sit in front of the TV for hours and we felt strongly<br/>
&gt; enough about it that we had to limit his viewing.<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s a much nicer young man (almost 10)to be around when he lives with<br/>
&gt; the limit. When he watched all the time he was snarly and uncooperative<br/>
&gt; and unproductive and mean.<br/>
&gt; He even admits now that he feels better about life in general when he<br/>
&gt; only watches a little TV. He gets a couple of favourite shows daily and<br/>
&gt; the rest he discusses with us first before viewing.<br/>
