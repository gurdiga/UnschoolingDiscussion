interested to know what you think:<br/>
<br/>
The New Kids Have Arrived!<br/>
The Indigo Children<br/>
An Interview With Co-Author Jan Tober<br/>
As told to Rick Martin<br/>
<br/>
The great Master Teacher of 2000 years ago said: &quot;Blessed are the children.&quot;<br/>
These children will be the guides to return us, as a world, to the path of<br/>
love.<br/>
<br/>
To a lot of people, it&#39;s not really news that there is something very<br/>
special going on with the children in this world. It&#39;s been happening for<br/>
some time. There are those who say that the &quot;forerunners&quot; to this modern-day<br/>
phenomenon started being birthed as long as 20 years ago. Futurists, such as<br/>
Gordon-Michael Scallion, have been speaking of their planetary entrance for<br/>
some years now, labeled by him as the Blue Children. To Nancy Ann Tappe,<br/>
gifted with the ability to see the auric field of the human body, they are<br/>
simply referred to as Indigos.<br/>
<br/>
What does the presence of these &quot;super kids&quot; mean? What is their message?<br/>
What is their purpose for being here, right now? Is this just a fanciful<br/>
idea or a reality? What are the Indigos and what makes them &quot;Indigo&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Although it took some months to coordinate, I was finally able to speak with<br/>
Jan Tober, the co-author of the provocative book called The Indigo Children,<br/>
about this fascinating subject.<br/>
<br/>
The book, while merely an &quot;introduction&quot; into the subject, is one that every<br/>
teacher and school administrator should be required to read. If you have a<br/>
child who is &quot;a handful&quot;, if you have a child who has been diagnosed with<br/>
Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) or Hyperactivity (ADHD), then by all means<br/>
go get and read this book! It should be in every library across the land.<br/>
<br/>
It is obvious that, in an hour and a half, we were only able to scratch the<br/>
surface on this subject. But if you have been feeling there&#39;s no hope for<br/>
the world, you&#39;ll get a definite &quot;boost&quot; from this story!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s move now directly into my discussion with Jan Tober on the subject of<br/>
these wonderful, wild, provocative, and often exasperating &quot;old&quot; children.<br/>
Martin: Let&#39;s begin with a fundamental definition; exactly what are the<br/>
Indigo children?<br/>
<br/>
Tober: The definition that we are sharing, that rings true for us, is: an<br/>
Indigo child is one who displays a new and unusual set of psychological<br/>
attributes, and shows a pattern of behavior generally undocumented before.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Martin: Along this line, I want to talk to you about the misdiagnosis of<br/>
Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and (ADHD), and the use of Ritalin to drug<br/>
these children. Have you encountered a lot of Indigos who have been drugged<br/>
and, in your opinion, misdiagnosed?<br/>
<br/>
Tober: Again, I work as an intuitive counselor. I do not work out in the<br/>
area where a lot of my clients would put their children on Ritalin. They<br/>
would go to alternatives, innately. However, in some of our audiences, which<br/>
have a broader cross-section, we are experiencing where, maybe not our<br/>
audience member would go that route, but they would say: &quot;My sister-in-law&#39;s<br/>
child, my niece, my nephew...&quot;, where they (audience members) are not the<br/>
primary child caretaker. But, they certainly know other Indigo primary<br/>
caretakers or teachers, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I want to quote the percentages we shared in the book, about the increase in<br/>
the production of Ritalin: &quot;Ritalin production has increased seven-fold in<br/>
the last eight years, and 90% of it is consumed in the U.S.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The trend over the past few years has been clear: the percentage of children<br/>
with an ADHD or ADD diagnosis, walking out of a doctor&#39;s office with a<br/>
prescription, jumped from 55% in 1989 to 75% in 1996. And, if the truth be<br/>
known, it&#39;s higher than that.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s happening? What&#39;s happening is, we have a new paradigm of soul, of<br/>
beings, coming into the Earth who are, primarily, right-brained. We have<br/>
them being shoved into a left-brained society where, to be left-brained is<br/>
to be honored; to be right-brained, i.e., the artist, the musician, dancer,<br/>
painter, writer, creative thinker is not to be honored, in this country.<br/>
<br/>
So, they&#39;re coming into a left-brained world. To get their kudos, to get<br/>
their strokes, to be really honored and respected, they have to try to fit<br/>
into that old system. These souls, as Masters, KNOW the truth and know that<br/>
we are now moving into honoring the right-brain mode, and they are a<br/>
significant part of that.<br/>
<br/>
So, they&#39;re not going to fit in, even if they choose to. They&#39;re here on a<br/>
mission lifetime-and that&#39;s a very important statement. They&#39;re here on a<br/>
mission lifetime! They&#39;re NOT here to fit in. We are here to understand<br/>
them, to learn from them, and allow them to teach us a new way of being.<br/>
<br/>
Back to your question. Because they&#39;re new and different, where do doctors<br/>
go? Where do parents go? Where do teachers go? They&#39;ve got children who<br/>
would appear to be hyperactive, who have a low attention span, who can&#39;t<br/>
stand in line-all of the symptoms that fit into something like the chicken<br/>
or the egg.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, which came first: ADD or the child of ADD? It&#39;s fitting into a type<br/>
of pattern. They don&#39;t know what to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if Ritalin healed the process, it would be different. I don&#39;t want to<br/>
get into an AMA discussion, but there are so many incredible alternatives<br/>
that take, maybe, a little bit more work, but my goodness, isn&#39;t your child<br/>
worth it?<br/>
<br/>
If the drug, Ritalin heals, then fine. But, it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s just a coping<br/>
mechanism or a band aid. Inevitably, they will need to discontinue the drug,<br/>
and deal with life experiences they were meant to have.<br/>
<br/>
I have a book on ADD and ADHD; it&#39;s The ADD And ADHD Diet, written by Rachel<br/>
Bell and Dr. Howard Peiper. I want to include this, although your audience<br/>
is very savvy, but just for us all to stop, take a deep breath, and think.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;People with ADD/ADHD lack sufficient supplies of neuro-transmitters,<br/>
especially seratonin. Seratonin is manufactured in the brain in the presence<br/>
of B6 and tryptophan. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid. If tryptophan<br/>
and B6 are in short supply, the body cannot make seratonin.&quot; I&#39;m quoting<br/>
from the book.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Therefore, people with ADD/ADHD may require supplements of tryptophan<br/>
and/or B6. Protein supplies amino acids to the body. If the body contains<br/>
sufficient protein and tryptophan-rich foods, the supply of amino acids will<br/>
not usually be a problem. The calcium/magnesium ratio is a key factor, also.<br/>
Insufficient magnesium can result in high insulin levels, which reduce<br/>
seratonin. Therefore it is necessary to insure an adequate supply of<br/>
magnesium, in addition to B6 and amino acids.&quot; It goes on. This is one of<br/>
several books we recommend. This book is very short, and sweet, and concise.<br/>
First, we&#39;ve got the Indigo constitution. We&#39;ve got Indigo Masters coming in<br/>
on a mission, saying: &quot;We&#39;re going to help this planet shift into the Divine<br/>
Feminine, one way or another. We&#39;re going to do it by coming in and being an<br/>
example of love. You&#39;re going to learn how to treat us, and as you learn how<br/>
to treat us, you&#39;re going to learn how to treat each other, with love.&quot; I<br/>
mean, that&#39;s the bottom line to all of this. When we learn how to love, be<br/>
with, parent, if you will, the Indigo child, we&#39;re learning how to operate<br/>
at the highest level with each other. That&#39;s what they&#39;re teaching us.<br/>
<br/>
So, we&#39;ve got ADD/ADHD, ok. We&#39;ve got a new paradigm coming in. They carry a<br/>
lot of what has been labeled Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. It<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean it is. What we&#39;re saying to parents is this: please look at<br/>
alternatives. We know it&#39;s challenging. That&#39;s why the book is out, so you<br/>
can pick the book up and look at the list of traits, and you can see that<br/>
maybe there&#39;s not something wrong with your child; that your child is part<br/>
of this new paradigm.<br/>
<br/>
Now, how do we work with that? That&#39;s what the book is filled with-healthy<br/>
alternatives, from diet to techniques. There&#39;s a technique called<br/>
sleep-talk, where you work with the child in their sleep state. It&#39;s very<br/>
powerful and it needs to be taught to parents. I&#39;m bringing some teachers<br/>
with me, as I put together Indigo workshops, around the country who will<br/>
shed light on our alternative choices.<br/>
<br/>
There are all kinds of choices that parents can look at. Does your child<br/>
respond to food allergies or environmental poisonings? We all have to get<br/>
very, very savvy about all of this, and these children are going to force us<br/>
into doing it-for ourselves, as well.<br/>
<br/>
Martin: Because I&#39;m aware of the time restraints we have here, let me ask<br/>
you: You have a fantastic list on your website of Montessori and Waldorf<br/>
schools. And you talk about those as being excellent places for Indigos.<br/>
What about those Indigos born into families that are economically<br/>
disadvantaged? What do you say to people who just can&#39;t afford that kind of<br/>
education?<br/>
<br/>
Tober: There have been some wonderful results we&#39;ve been hearing about with<br/>
home schooling. There&#39;s a group in Houston, I believe there&#39;s about 40<br/>
families, maybe more, as of this interview, and they are successfully<br/>
working with home schooling. That might be an alternative. That, certainly,<br/>
would be an inexpensive alternative, and they&#39;re getting wonderful results,<br/>
and the children are walking right into Ivy League colleges.<br/>
<br/>
I also know, within my heart of hearts, that there will be, I believe, other<br/>
forms of schooling coming up that may be not as cost prohibitive to families<br/>
who don&#39;t have a comfortable income. And I know there is such a huge<br/>
interest in Indigos, and what we can do to help them, that there are a lot<br/>
of educators now, who are also metaphysicians, who are joining forces and<br/>
working at putting this schooling together.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Martin: You&#39;ve been around a lot. You&#39;ve been traveling a lot. What do you<br/>
think people need to know? What is the most useful information that you can<br/>
pass on to our readers about this subject?<br/>
<br/>
Tober: There are two words that, if we could say nothing more to you, we<br/>
would say, in the parenting of the Indigo child. In relating to the Indigo<br/>
child, the two words are: choices and negotiate. If you can remember nothing<br/>
else, if you do not read our book, please just give them choices and<br/>
negotiate everything. I mean, certainly, they&#39;re not to run rampant over<br/>
you. But that is the parenting guide. If we can remember that they&#39;re here<br/>
to teach us, that gives more of a balance to those words.<br/>
<br/>
I want to share with your readers what parents can do to make a difference.<br/>
In addition to giving them choices and negotiating with them, you can make a<br/>
big difference by guiding them, rather than giving them explicit directions.<br/>
Treat them and interact with them as your best friend, because in truth,<br/>
they are. Treat them with respect. Honor their existence in your family.<br/>
Help them create their own disciplinary solutions. You&#39;ll be amazed as a<br/>
parent what they will come up with. And give them choices about everything.<br/>
Never belittle them, ever. This is just good parenting advice. If we wanted<br/>
to be the perfect parent, we would say: &quot;This is the list I will follow.&quot;<br/>
So, they are very simply saying: &quot;Now is the time, and you get to practice<br/>
being the perfect parent. Now is the time on the planet to do this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Always explain why you give them the instructions you do; never say:<br/>
&quot;Because I said so.&quot; Instead say: &quot;Because this will help me today. I&#39;m a<br/>
bit tired today. I need some help from you&quot; knowing that honesty will always<br/>
win out with them because they&#39;re intuitive. They know what&#39;s going on,<br/>
because you&#39;re thinking it.<br/>
<br/>
Make them your partners in raising them. This is extremely important. This<br/>
goes with choices and negotiation. Make them your partner. Let them know<br/>
they always have a vote. Be PRESENT with them. And, of course, as a friend,<br/>
as a grown-up family member, we ask always to be present when we&#39;re in a<br/>
situation with people. I mean, that is &quot;be here now&quot;. That&#39;s being in the<br/>
moment, all of this metaphysical stuff. Metaphysicians innately know a lot<br/>
of this. And explain everything to your children, if you think they don&#39;t<br/>
understand something. Know that they DO understand at the soul level. And we<br/>
know we can talk to them before birth. Start early, how about before<br/>
conception!<br/>
<br/>
If serious problems develop, and you feel you want to test them for ADD or<br/>
ADHD, we do not say, &quot;Do not go to doctors.&quot; What we say in the book is:<br/>
&quot;Look at some alternatives. For instance, diet, supplements, nutrition,<br/>
homeopathy, chiropractic, and reversed polarity.&quot; Look at what&#39;s out there<br/>
holistically. We offer a large list, and access to alternative authors,<br/>
alternative teachers who you can email, your questions and concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Provide safety in your support. Avoid negative criticism. Encourage them in<br/>
their endeavors. This is all stuff we know. An Indigo is not a follower. Let<br/>
them decide what THEY are interested in, and what they want to do. Talk to<br/>
them, not at them. That, basically, is the information we have found from<br/>
therapists, from very conscientious parents, from Nancy&#39;s work, that seems<br/>
to really help guide the Indigos.<br/>
<br/>
They know who they are. They come in feeling and knowing. It does not serve<br/>
us to try to mold them into a pattern that possibly we had to learn to break<br/>
out of, the pattern of how our parents raised us.<br/>
<br/>
There is a new way of being. There&#39;s a new way of parenting, and it&#39;s about<br/>
moving into love. The bottom line is love-being present and loving and<br/>
understanding. In the months and years ahead, we&#39;re going to see new school<br/>
systems where parents and educators work together.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Create a sacred and harmonious home. This may be achieved by burning sage,<br/>
burning alcohol and Epsom salts and certain types of incense. Honor your<br/>
home as a temple, so that your child can come home to a loving parent or<br/>
parents in clear loving surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you&#39;re tired, explain this to them. Set aside some special time just<br/>
for them, when you can be fully present. Always make them feel safe and let<br/>
them come home to their best friend, you.<br/>
<br/>
Martin: At the end of the book you have some information on the message that<br/>
the Indigo&#39;s bring. Can you comment more about that?<br/>
<br/>
Tober: Specifically, which part, Rick, were you talking about?<br/>
<br/>
Martin: The message that they bring, the message of love.<br/>
<br/>
Tober: Oh, yes! The message IS of love; it is of honoring that piece of<br/>
us-again, I mention the Divine Feminine, which comes in and honors love,<br/>
compassion, the intuitive process, all of the pieces that need to come<br/>
together to make this Heaven on Earth-and they are here to show us, one way<br/>
or another.<br/>
<br/>
Martin: You talk about them as being &quot;systems busters&quot;. What do you mean by<br/>
that?<br/>
<br/>
Tober: We were told, many years ago, that the first things that would break<br/>
down would be the old, established institutions and systems. Do you remember<br/>
that?<br/>
<br/>
Martin: Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Tober: We were told that, as we move into this New Age, this Golden Age-<br/>
The old systems don&#39;t fit into the new mold-so they&#39;re right out there as<br/>
those who will break, for instance, the educational system as it has been<br/>
for a hundred years or so. They will not put up with something simply<br/>
because that&#39;s the way it has always been.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In my mind and in my heart, it&#39;s awesome. It&#39;s just so awesome to know that<br/>
they&#39;re here working with us! FINALLY!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Martin: Let&#39;s talk about using the old tricks of guilt and shame as behavior<br/>
tools with these kids.<br/>
<br/>
Tober: They won&#39;t work! The Indigos know who they are. It will just<br/>
frustrate, devastate the parents. It will bring in a very agitated<br/>
energy-field around the parents and around the child, which will defeat any<br/>
discussion, any real help. It just won&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
They know who they are. They&#39;re on a mission. They are aware of that. So,<br/>
this is a challenge, because we have a whole culture that has been raised on<br/>
&quot;You just wait until your father gets home!&quot; I&#39;m sure you probably heard<br/>
that a few times. I certainly did, and that won&#39;t work now!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have children. I&#39;m around them a lot, but I can appreciate what<br/>
parents must go through when they go back to the old modus operandi for<br/>
parents, and find out that it doesn&#39;t do anything. The children will test<br/>
them to see how far they can get.<br/>
<br/>
However, these children are not brats. That is not in their consciousness.<br/>
They will test the parent, in this respect, to see what the ground-rules<br/>
are. How far can I do this? What can I do? What, really, is important to my<br/>
parents? What isn&#39;t important? And they&#39;re going to learn to see how they<br/>
can negotiate with the parents. So, if a parent comes back with a<br/>
negotiation point-of-view, then they&#39;re going to be on the same page.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s quite amazing to see them in action. It&#39;s joyful when you experience<br/>
them with conscientious parents, who are coming from love, who certainly are<br/>
from a mind/body/soul integration, through love.<br/>
<br/>
Martin: Have you had contact with many parents, who have Indigos, who are<br/>
just totally beside themselves?<br/>
<br/>
Tober: We&#39;ve had a lot of mail from parents who are so thrilled when they<br/>
read the book, and they realize that their children maybe Indigos, When they<br/>
started working with the principles we talk about, they started to find<br/>
success in their parenting.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re all helping each other. They go on-line, interact, and offer each<br/>
other solutions, ideas and alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that&#39;s going to be the way a lot of this is going to work. The<br/>
parents are going to have to get really proactive, and put together support<br/>
groups, where they can help each other because we&#39;re making it up as we go<br/>
along.<br/>
<br/>
Martin: Do you find much awareness among family therapists?<br/>
<br/>
Tober: If they honor their intuitive process, yes. And, of course, in this<br/>
area, we do have a lot of people who are counselors and do honor their<br/>
right-brain, intuitive side.<br/>
<br/>
Martin: How have you found your reception to be at the United Nations.<br/>
<br/>
Tober: They invited us back three times; it was very surprising to us. We<br/>
spoke in one of the smaller rooms, for the Society of Enlightenment and<br/>
Transformation, (SEAT). It is one of the charter organizations created for<br/>
meditating members.<br/>
We were honored and we and always feel welcomed there.<br/>
<br/>
Martin: Ok, let&#39;s shift back to the Indigos. What would you like to leave<br/>
our readers with, to think about, with regard to this infusion of new energy<br/>
in the form of these children?<br/>
<br/>
Tober: If you had a knock on your door, opened the door, and you saw a great<br/>
Master in your doorway, you would be joyful and thrilled! And you would<br/>
invite the Master in. Then, you would probably sit down, thank him or her<br/>
for coming, and you would say hopefully, &quot;What is it you want me to know?<br/>
How can I help you and how can I help the planet? What wisdom do you wish to<br/>
share with me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is the way to honor the Indigo!<br/>
<br/>
Martin: That&#39;s a good place to end. Thank you for a thoughtful and<br/>
 &quot;inspired&quot; interview. Our readers will truly enjoy this and I&#39;m sure some<br/>
of them will be contacting you!<br/>
