to put on the website.  Found it just now.  I don&#39;t know who was  <br/>
being quoted, but that&#39;s fine.<br/>

Very practical advice from Ren.<br/>

&quot;I tend to &quot;hide&quot; from the kids when I&#39;m overwhelmed and of<br/>
<br/>
course it&#39;s just a vicious cycle.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Being sensitive to stimulation makes it difficult as a parent....I<br/>
<br/>
think being very proactive in a situation like that really helps.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t wait for the &quot;overwhelmed&quot; thing to happen, take steps when<br/>
<br/>
you&#39;re feeling calm and centered.<br/>
<br/>
Having many tools in your toolbelt helps...like the stash of toys,<br/>
<br/>
Pam&#39;s chopsticks, new games etc..., taking time to sit quietly with a<br/>
<br/>
cup of tea or a bath when everyone is sleeping, whatever feeds your<br/>
<br/>
spirit so you can connect with your children from a loving center.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have found that when things get tense, a short &quot;meditation walk&quot;<br/>
<br/>
will really help re-focus my energy...or if the kids come along, we<br/>
<br/>
all see new things, find our joy again by being in a new setting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just a quick shift into a different place, or different situation can<br/>
<br/>
really change the energy in the house.  Going for a drive can do the<br/>
<br/>
same thing. I have a big enough van to keep the children that are<br/>
<br/>
having issues, FAR away from each other.:)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Being present isn&#39;t always easy, heck, I forget to listen to my own<br/>
<br/>
advice at times!! We&#39;re human, we get cranky, we have hormones and<br/>
<br/>
life issues and frustrations. Luckily, we also have an incredible web<br/>
<br/>
of support (thanks to technology) and a chance to do better every day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wake up sometimes and really think about how I will respond THIS<br/>
<br/>
day. Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m<br/>
<br/>
going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do<br/>
<br/>
theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to<br/>
<br/>
be present starting right now. I drink my tea, breathe deeply of the<br/>
<br/>
new day, think about preparing some yummy food they will love to help<br/>
<br/>
start their day off on a positive note.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All this helps me really BE there when they awake and come out for<br/>
<br/>
hugs. Those are the days that things really flow, that I&#39;m not getting<br/>
<br/>
as frustrated (even when challenges arise), because I&#39;ve made a CHOICE.<br/>
<br/>
Every day isn&#39;t going to be smooth...that&#39;s just life. But when we<br/>
<br/>
choose mindfulness, choose to be present in each moment, choose to<br/>
<br/>
prepare ourselves for the most important role in our lives...it&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
going to be good.<br/>

Subject: [AlwaysLearning] spilled milk<br/>
Reply-To: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve mentioned my old attitude and how I&#39;m working on things.  I had<br/>
an awesome moment about half an hour ago that made me feel really<br/>
good.  My youngest son told me matter of factly that he had spilled<br/>
his milk.  I got up, found something close to begin cleaning and asked<br/>
him to get another towel that was farther away, but was big enough to<br/>
finish the job.  We cleaned the milk up together and got him into some<br/>
new clothes.  This probably sounds really simple, and basically, the<br/>
actions were the same ones I would have followed just a few months<br/>
ago.  The spill was cleaned and the clothes changed.  The difference<br/>
this time was that no one yelled, screamed, sighed, huffed, growled,<br/>
stomped and no one else cried, screamed or got scared of his father.<br/>
It also took a fraction of the time to just smile and wipe.<br/>
<br/>
In the middle of all that I had a moment where I realized how much<br/>
nicer it was to just deal with the situation.  It wasn&#39;t a moment to<br/>
teach him not to spill his milk.  It wasn&#39;t a moment to deride or<br/>
correct.  It was just spilled milk and a little boy with a cold strip<br/>
down the front of his clothes.  And that&#39;s all they ever are, just<br/>
spilled milk and soggy britches.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Similar story:  I was just out grocery shopping with my three boys, <br/>
ages 9,7,4.  The 7yo was in the cart.  While my back was turned, the <br/>
4yo jumped onto the side of the cart and the whole thing tipped <br/>
over.  Groceries all over the floor, my coffee (not hot) spilled, and <br/>
two boys sprawled, fortunately not hurt, on the floor.  My 4yo is <br/>
wailing.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A kind woman came over to help upright things, a kind store clerk <br/>
assured me that the spilt coffee was no problem and went to get a <br/>
mop.  My 9yo started picking up the spilled groceries and re-loading <br/>
them.  I held the other two, reassuring them that as long as they <br/>
were not hurt, all was well.  We waited calmly until my 4yo could <br/>
pull himself together a bit, and then we went on.  <br/>
<br/>
Before choosing to live mindfully, I would have been totally stressed <br/>
out by this.  I would have communicated exasperation, disappointment, <br/>
anger, and would have added so much negative energy to a situation <br/>
that needed the exact opposite.  <br/>

Good for you for handling that mishap so well.<br/>

Things that happen in public can be the worst triggers for old  <br/>

That used to be a really tough one for me, as my family raised us to<br/>
be overly aware of what everyone else thought. ugh.<br/>
<br/>
I can now look at my child and think &quot;I care more about his/her<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-57911760">This is something my husband really struggles with. He was raised with the<br/>
importance of keeping up appearances. It didn&#39;t really matter how good or<br/>
bad reality was as long as the family/house/belongings/vacations/job/etc.<br/>
looked good and presentable. It was all about &quot;what will people think of<br/>
us&quot;.  Lots of formality.  He hated that and still does, but sometimes<br/>
aspects of it still come back to haunt him. We live in a small townhouse, I<br/>
am admittedly not the best housekeeper nor am I a gormet cook.  All the<br/>
fancy china and silver from his mother and grandmother sit wrapped nicely in<br/>
basement....unused. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an ounce of formaility to our<br/>
home. 90% of the time, he loves the fun and chaos of our home. But<br/>
occasionaly his upbringing rears it&#39;s ugly head then it&#39;s difficult for all<br/>
of us. Usually it&#39;s when he has stress from other areas of his life. It<br/>
doesn&#39;t take as much to get it under control anymore either.<br/>
