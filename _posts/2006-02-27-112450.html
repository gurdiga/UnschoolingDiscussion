<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640911296">Hi. I spoke with many of you on the Unschoolers Discussion list last year as I was <br/>
developing my documentary film about homeschooling, which ultimately focused <br/>
exclusively on unschooling. I&#39;m pleased to report that the film, called &quot;Unschooled,&quot; had its <br/>
World Premier earlier this week at the Big Sky Documentary Film Festival in Missoula, <br/>
Montana, which was a great success.<br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;re in the Bay Area and you still haven&#39;t seen Unschooled--or haven&#39;t seen it on the <br/>
big screen--now&#39;s your chance. I&#39;d like to invite you to join me at a screening next week in <br/>
Berkeley.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooled has been selected to screen at the prestigious Pacific Film Archive (PFA) in <br/>
Berkeley next Thursday, March 2nd, as part of the PFA&#39;s Real Live series. It will screen <br/>
along with a few other short films by current and former Berkeley students. The program <br/>
starts at 7:30, and I&#39;ll be there afterwards for a Q&A.<br/>
 <br/>
The PFA is at 2575 Bancroft Way, between College and Telegraph Ave. For directions, <br/>
please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/visiting_bampfa/index.html.">http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/visiting_bampfa/index.html.</a> The full <br/>
program of that evening&#39;s screenings is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/">http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/</a><br/>

 <br/>
Once again, the screening info is:<br/>
 <br/>
7:30pm on Thursday, March 2nd at the Pacific Film Archive (2575 Bancroft Way)<br/>
 <br/>
For those of you unfamiliar with the film, Unschooled is a 25-minute documentary that <br/>
profiles three unschooling families. In exploring the motivations and experiences of these <br/>
families, the film raises a question vital to schooled and unschooled viewers alike: What <br/>
does it mean to be well-educated?<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m excited to screen the film in Berkeley and hope you can join me on March 2nd. If you <br/>
have any questions about the film or the screening, you can reach me at <br/>

screenings in other areas and how to purchase a copy of the film. <br/>
 <br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

Producer/Director, UNSCHOOLED<br/>
