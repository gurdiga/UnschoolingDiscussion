<div id="ygrps-yiv-292017007">Hey all, Jacli here :)<br/>
Kathy, I just wanted to say thankyou for your nice<br/>
comments.  <br/>
I too am saddened by the amount of people who have left,<br/>
and <br/>
will miss the strength they lent by their numbers as well<br/>
as<br/>
their insights and comments.<br/>
<br/>
I too am glad for the recent flux of new comments and<br/>
insights<br/>
from people not heard from too often before now.  I will be<br/>
glad <br/>
when there is more participation from<br/>
more members.  But I have to say I think that will not<br/>
happen <br/>
until we bring the number of member bashing comments (like<br/>
the <br/>
endless cycle of Linda&#39;s list comments) and judgemental<br/>
re-hashings<br/>
to a minimum.<br/>
<br/>
I joined this list back when it first started and have<br/>
continued to <br/>
come back to it not because I expect everyone to always<br/>
agree<br/>
with me but because I expect to see different sides and<br/>
perceptions<br/>
to every argument presented with love and sincerity.  I may<br/>
not always<br/>
agree with every thought presented here ( and recently have<br/>
been a bit<br/>
disappointed by what has appeared to be a lack of tolerance<br/>
for each other)<br/>
 but I am glad to participate  in a forum that allows for<br/>
and actually encourages <br/>
unschoolers and homeschoolers alike to express themselves,<br/>
better themselves and<br/>
respect themselves.<br/>
<br/>
How many places are there for an unschooler/homeschooler to<br/>
think and learn and grow<br/>
and feel free to be themselves?  This list is a valuable<br/>
tool.  I think each of us has something <br/>
to contribute and as long as we remember that and respect<br/>
that and each other this list<br/>
will thrive, regardless of who is on/off it.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents, Jacli :)<br/>
<br/>
