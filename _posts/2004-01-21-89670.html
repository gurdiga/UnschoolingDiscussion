<div id="ygrps-yiv-648271887">Hello all,<br/>
My name is Matt and I have decided to start the planning and contacting <br/>
process in order to open a Sudbury School here in eastern Maine. This <br/>
school will be slightly different from the typical model in the fact that we will <br/>
attempt to house the children and also find a way in which parents could work <br/>
off a LOW tuition. We would like this school to be able to include children in <br/>
any financial bracket. Also, because of the remote location we feel as though <br/>
housing would be necessary. Eastern Maine is a BEAUTIFUL place with <br/>
endless outdoor adventures waiting to be created. We are aiming for a first <br/>
year enrollment of 6-8 children and a tuition in the sub 2000 dollar range with <br/>
the possibility of a great deal being able to be worked off. <br/>
I am writing this email to see what type of interest is out there for this amazing <br/>
experience. It is a truly once in a lifetime experience that we will go through to <br/>
get the school off the ground. Please pass this email on to anyone who you <br/>
think be interested in this method of living and learning. Also, feel free to <br/>
contact me with any questions about myself, my background, or details on the <br/>
area. Thanks for your time. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mattbau43@...">mattbau43@...</a></div>

boarding school on an unschooling list? <br/>
<br/>
Am I missing something here?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, I suppose a sudbury boarding school would be<br/>
better than a regular ol&#39; boarding school, but the<br/>
best place for children is in the home with their<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
And wow, $2K a year would buy a lot of art supplies,<br/>
building materials, classes at the Y or whatever else<br/>
my child needs to successfully unschool.  And the time<br/>
spent working to make that tuition could be used to<br/>
spend time with my children.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;what is important and valuable about the home as a<br/>
base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that<br/>
it is a better school than the schools, but that it<br/>
isn&#39;t a school at all&quot; -- John Holt<br/>

This just shows how much I know (or don&#39;t).  When I read the first <br/>
post, I had no idea what a Sudbury School was and just assumed that <br/>
it was a place where you would go WITH your kids!  Why else would it <br/>
be posted on an unschooling list.  :-)  So, the thing that shocked <br/>
me was the fact that he was saying how cheap it was going to be and <br/>
then said that &quot;tution&quot; was 2K....didn&#39;t sound that cheap to me.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t realize that it was a boarding school until I read the <br/>
responses to it.<br/>

My point exactly!  When I thought it was something that you would go <br/>
to WITH your kids, it sounded like a high price to pay.  Now that I <br/>
know it&#39;s a boarding school, 2K really isn&#39;t that expensive.  <br/>
However, inexpensive or not, I have a hard time leaving my daughter <br/>
to go to dinner, forget about sending her across the country to <br/>
school!<br/>

Even here in Ohio 2K would be cheap for a private school, although I don&#39;t<br/>
even know if there are any boarding schools around here.  When my two<br/>
youngest were in pre-school, it was about $1000/year for 3 mornings a week.<br/>

<br/>
I was reading somewhere recently about a young girl (14 or 15) who <br/>
went off by herself to do an apprenticeship on an organic farm. I <br/>
think that is not too young at all to do something like that (well, <br/>
maybe for schooled kids it would be.) Anyway, I am sure that I would <br/>
miss my children terribly if they decided to do something like that <br/>
at that age, and I would want to make sure that it was a reasonably <br/>
safe situation, but I can see it being a really great experience for <br/>
some kids. Not little kids though. Matthew made a good point, <br/>
though, that there are younger kids without families or in bad <br/>
family situations who would benefit from something like this. But <br/>
wouldn&#39;t that be basically a foster program then? <br/>

<br/>
I realize that not everyone is across the country from Maine and I <br/>
have always wanted to visit that part of the country.  If this is a <br/>
school that I could go with my DD (as I think someone else posted), <br/>
it just might be something that I would consider....2K or not. If I <br/>
could go with her, I just might be able to bring myself to spend the <br/>
money to have that experience.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
My DH and I have already made the decision that we will not have any <br/>
other children so I hope that my child will not feel that way.  We <br/>
are married, however, and I realize that &quot;accidents&quot; happen so, you <br/>
never know.     <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;Some people have as much urge to go travelling as others have urge <br/>

I am the original home body and so is my husband.  Our idea of a <br/>
nice night is having pizza delivered and watching a nice cartoon <br/>
(Finding Nemo, maybe) with our 2.5 year old.  Boy, I don&#39;t know what <br/>
I&#39;ll do it got a traveler.....adapt, I guess.  :)<br/>

Would that be per year or per month?  I know for some their whole income is <br/>
2000 a month so even being able to work some off would be hard. I think it <br/>
would be nice if the school offered non boarding options also or part year.  I <br/>
think some kids would be interested in staying but maybe not a full year.  I know <br/>
if I had to work I would look for a school like this in my area for my <br/>
child(untill he was old enough to stay alone) (not boarding) and if I could work of <br/>
some of the tuition that would be great.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As I hit the send button on this one, I realized that what I had said <br/>
at the end is more than trite but untrue. I do not send my kids to <br/>
school because I have no other choice here in NYC. I mean, in NY there <br/>
is no such thing as part-time schooling. I know, for a fact that my <br/>
kids would be totally kosher about going to a &#39;learn but not at home&#39; <br/>
setting a few hours a day a, few days a week. As it is, I have to <br/>
schlepp them around town so they can get their people fix with other <br/>
homeschoolers. My kids are very, VERY sociable. They love to be around <br/>
people. Being at home, in a way, drives them crazy --it&#39;s a good thing <br/>
they have an awesome relationship and that they actually enjoy being <br/>
with each other. If not, it would be total hell.<br/>
<br/>
So I have to amend the &quot;too high a price for unschoolers&quot; quip to read <br/>
&quot;for SOME unschoolers&quot;. Because, in earnest, I have no problem at all <br/>
whatsoever leaving my kids at home with a baby-sitter so that Mark & I <br/>
can go out on those rare occasions we have the money. Leave them with a <br/>
homeschooling friend a couple of hours while I run an errand? No <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
I have recently written more about the lunacy of going it alone by many <br/>
parents, especially homeschooling parents. I see that here in NY and <br/>
read of it on many of these national lists. I wanted to have my kids in <br/>
the world, that&#39;s why I decided that not going to school would actually <br/>
impinge on their being in the real world --aka: their socialization-- <br/>
and not enhance it. I just cannot for the life of me understand the <br/>
isolation in which people put themselves in for the sake of <br/>
homeschooling, being with the kids, having a family.<br/>
<br/>
Having others help me with the kids is not a sign of weakness. It just <br/>
means that, sometimes, I need a break and they do to. We are all <br/>
refreshed and eager to be together when we have not seen each other for <br/>
a few hours. And that&#39;s why homeschooling --as in being together 24/7 <br/>
forever-- sucks. We all have to be in the world, independently, one way <br/>
or another.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437309676">&lt;&lt;just to bring perspective into this ... a cheap pre-k in NYC is around <br/>
6K. 2k for &#39;schooling&#39; tuition is a steal, but then again, too high a <br/>
price to pay for unschoolers :)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Would that be per year or per month?  I know for some their whole income<br/>
is <br/>
2000 a month&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I read the first quote as being �too high a price� metaphorically. Didn�t a<br/>
list member fairly recently post about their family visit to a Sudbury<br/>
school near them? I found it a very interesting story. <br/>

in the world and I&#39;m not trying to be a super mom who does it all <br/>
herself.  My kids (ages 10, 6, 4) just don&#39;t want to ever leave me <br/>
and get very upset at the idea.  They  stay with my mom maybe 3 or 4 <br/>
times a year, and even then they&#39;re not happy about it. It usually <br/>
involves a few tears when we leave them with her for a day trip to <br/>
celebrate our anniversary.  They&#39;re usually ok if I make a quick trip <br/>
to the store if their dad is home with them, but they freak out at <br/>
the suggestion of a babysitter or even going to grandma&#39;s or a <br/>
friend&#39;s house.  Even my 10 year old doesn&#39;t like to go to friends&#39; <br/>
houses without me.   I&#39;ve pretty much given up on trying to go places <br/>
without them or them going places without me.  <br/>
<br/>
And lately, they&#39;re not wanting to get together with friends even <br/>
with me a whole lot.  They&#39;re happy going places together as a <br/>
family, like day trips to museums or libraries and stuff, but usually <br/>
they just want to stay home.  <br/>

my intent wasn&#39;t to offend anyone.  <br/>
<br/>
I like the concept of the Sudbury schools a lot.  I personally am <br/>
attracted to the community part of the school, so much so that I <br/>
seriously considered a Sudbury school for us.  What I really disliked <br/>
about the school though was that the community it created was a <br/>
community where kids couldn&#39;t freely flow back and forth between <br/>
parents and other children and adults.  Parents were completely out <br/>
of the picture. For older kids that might be fine, but I think <br/>
younger kids just need their parents more than that.  I think the <br/>
reason I reacted as strongly as I did to the initial post about the <br/>
boarding school was because the separation of parent and child would <br/>
be even more.  The kids don&#39;t get to go home to be with their parents <br/>
at the end of the day.  That kind of horrified me because I see the <br/>
parent and child separation as a flaw in the Sudbury philosophy and <br/>
with a boarding school that flaw is being intensified.  <br/>
<br/>
When I posted what is quoted above, I actually was lightening up <br/>
about it.  It must have just seemed like I was going on about it, but <br/>
really, I was thinking, &quot;Oh, so there are situations where this would <br/>
be a good thing&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, although I didn&#39;t post anything about it, I also read posts <br/>
about older kids wanting to travel and how that would be a good <br/>
opportunity for them to do that.  I hadn&#39;t thought about that because <br/>
not being a parent of an older kid, I was picturing kids my kids&#39; <br/>
ages (10 and under) being sent off to boarding school.  But I do see <br/>
where that would be a cool opportunity.  <br/>
<br/>
So I give my apologies to Matthew and Sandra and anyone else who <br/>
thought I was being rude.  I wasn&#39;t trying to be rude or anything.  I <br/>
was just sharing my thoughts with you, even though some of my <br/>
thoughts might have been different from the majority of those on this <br/>
list.  Hopefully in some small way it was helpful to you to hear <br/>
varied perspectives from parents who share similar educational <br/>
philosophies.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124504364">Sheila I didnt feel as though you were rude. It is how you feel and <br/>
thats just fine with me. The school will be set up with 4 days <br/>
of &quot;school&quot; and then a 3day weekend in the hope that those students <br/>
that live hours away will be able to go home for a few days every <br/>
week. THat way they get their sudbury experience then get to be with <br/>
their families which is just as important. Hope this helps any <br/>
confusion.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
he he, he&#39;s enjoying the freedom to stay home so much,<br/>
it&#39;s still better than a little boredom?  Boredom, I<br/>
think, is sometimes a necessary stage.  Think of it as<br/>
a restful stage between activity.  It might be tough<br/>
at first not to want to help him not be bored, but I<br/>
would follow his lead on that one, for now at least.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;Usually when he has said he would go somewhere <br/>
(stay at Grandma&#39;s, play at a friend&#39;s, come with me<br/>
grocery shopping <br/>

this is just <br/>
deschooling for Fisher -- we used to do a fair amount<br/>
out of the <br/>
house -- or if this is going to continue.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, does he need a little more warning, or a little<br/>
description of what is going to happen, a little more<br/>
choice in the matter in the first place?  For example,<br/>
if you need groceries, show him the frig and pantry<br/>
and tell him what you need, and ask him what he&#39;d like<br/>
at the store. Reminding him that his favorites are not<br/>
&quot;in stock&quot;, that he could pick up something new to<br/>
try, whatever works for him, might distract him from<br/>
the newness of his power to choose not to go. lol <br/>
<br/>
You may want to share a bit of the decision making<br/>
process that you go thru when deciding you need food,<br/>
or when to visit grandma, not make it him choosing or<br/>
you choosing when to go.  does that make sense? <br/>
<br/>
If you start out on the right foot, I think that it&#39;s<br/>
much easier to &quot;work it out with him&quot; than you might<br/>
be used to.  It takes quite a bit of practice to not<br/>
make it a power struggle from the get go. That might<br/>
be the issue here. <br/>
<br/>
 Like, if you need food, tell him that, instead of,<br/>
you need to go to the store with me.  It doesn&#39;t sound<br/>
much different to you and I maybe, but it might sound<br/>
different to him.<br/>
<br/>
Your post made me think, have you always had a<br/>
homebody, and you just didn&#39;t know it til now?  lol <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;I bring this up because I&#39;m wondering if those of<br/>
you (like Sheila) <br/>
that have homebodies have tips that you can share for<br/>
helping me deal <br/>
with it.  Not change it -- I respect that this is<br/>

be, and I&#39;m glad of it.  Just dealing with the cabin<br/>

be a good mom <br/>
when you&#39;re feeling pulled by your own desire to go<br/>
out and your <br/>
child&#39;s desire to stay in.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
About once a week, I go out by myself.  Usually it&#39;s<br/>
not much more than doing the grocery shopping and<br/>
such, but I always slip in something that I enjoy as<br/>
well.  Bookstores, coffee shop, cruising the racks at<br/>
Goodwill, window shopping at the mall, spending an<br/>
hour in the craft store.  If you&#39;re hubby&#39;s not home,<br/>
but you&#39;re mom&#39;s around, she could come by for an hour<br/>
or two maybe?  You could get out and your son could<br/>
stay home?  <br/>
<br/>
Every few months,  Alex is off to the inlaws<br/>
overnight, usually his cousin goes over too.  Hubby<br/>
and I go out to dinner and a movie, sleep in, and pick<br/>
him up the next day.<br/>
<br/>
  He likes the novelty of being at Abuela&#39;s, they push<br/>
the LR couches together and she sleeps with them, she<br/>
makes pancakes at 6 am, lol, she kicks his butt at all<br/>
the bored.com games that I don&#39;t play very well, etc. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that we do is, once a month, all the<br/>
in laws, cousins, and friends get together for Game<br/>
Day.  I get an entire Saturday to myself, and they go<br/>
play Halo for 8 hours, eat junk food, and just<br/>
generally geek out. lol <br/>
<br/>
Like Liza said in a post not too long ago, if you need<br/>
alone time, free time, whatever, don&#39;t ignore that. <br/>
It might be tough on you right now to go from dropping<br/>
him off at school and having hours long blocks of time<br/>
to yourself, and transitioning to being a full time<br/>
caregiver. And unschooling can be intense at times.  <br/>
You might not be able to respond as well to the<br/>
intensity, when it comes, if you aren&#39;t taking breaks<br/>
when you need them.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  <br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; Since we left school a couple of months ago, <br/>
&gt; Fisher (6) would much prefer to stay home than do<br/>
&gt; anything else.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; he he, he&#39;s enjoying the freedom to stay home so much,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s still better than a little boredom?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree, it&#39;s great.  Thanks for responding.  I&#39;ll just say (so <br/>
others know as they&#39;re formulating responses) that I&#39;ve always been <br/>
very conscientious about giving Fisher as much advance warning and as <br/>
many options as I could -- other parents and even my in-laws have <br/>
commented that I do a great job of letting him know what&#39;s going on, <br/>
so he doesn&#39;t feel blindsided by upcoming events.  I will be more <br/>
aware of my language -- &quot;we need food&quot; instead of &quot;we have to go <br/>
grocery shopping.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As for giving myself a break, I&#39;ve always been a &quot;my night out&quot; <br/>
person, going to my writing group once a week.  I&#39;ve learned to take <br/>
very good care of my kids&#39; mother. &lt;g&gt;  I may be experiencing the new <br/>
baby syndrome, along with unschooling -- Riley (7 mo.) definitely <br/>
prefers mom over others right now.  I&#39;m just at the stage where <br/>
teenage babysitters don&#39;t really cut it with the baby, and the <br/>
closest Grandma prefers to babysit at her house, not here.  So I&#39;m <br/>
interested in how people treat themselves well when it just really <br/>
won&#39;t work for them to go out.<br/>
<br/>
But we are finding solutions -- when I *had* to go grocery shopping, <br/>
Fisher agreed to spend an hour at Grandma&#39;s rather than go through <br/>
the store with me.  And tonight we were supposed to go to her place <br/>
for dinner -- but since I&#39;m here, posting, you can guess what <br/>
happened. &lt;g&gt;  Grandma was very understanding, and praised us for <br/>
listening to our child. (!)  My husband went (it&#39;s his family), and I <br/>
didn&#39;t really feel like going anyway.  So it worked.  <br/>
<br/>
The best part is, we are talking about this as a family.  Fisher was <br/>
trying to get some enthusiasm up for going (&quot;they do have good food <br/>
there . . .&quot;) but in the end just didn&#39;t want to go.  He offered some <br/>
trades, was trying to hear what we wanted (to attend church some <br/>
Sundays) and negotiate with that.  He was really kind, respectful, <br/>
while still maintaining his own position.<br/>
<br/>
What more could I ask for? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
I had forgotten that you had a babe in the house.<br/>
About the teenage neighbor babysitter type deal, we<br/>
tried that for a little while, but Alex was Fisher&#39;s<br/>
age and we had no littler ones.  <br/>
<br/>
Grandma is a great resource, I&#39;m glad you have one<br/>
around!  I wish I had two, ( cause I&#39;m greedy!) my<br/>
Mom&#39;s on the east coast, to my midwest.  *wah* We&#39;re<br/>
going to visit for two weeks next month tho.<br/>
<br/>
What do I do when I&#39;m a little stir crazy and Alex<br/>
won&#39;t budge? hmmm<br/>
<br/>
I take a bath.  Play an involved computer game.  Get a<br/>
craft project or two ( or three, lol) going. Making<br/>
candles, soap, crochet, sewing, etc.  Read email. Cook<br/>
something new, challenging, or strange! Baking bread<br/>
is very therapeutic.  Really! Cookies always work too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning is something I do to zone out, almost<br/>
meditative, but then again, I&#39;m strange that way. lol<br/>
<br/>
I guess I have developed lots of things over the years<br/>
to keep me busy, because I have problems with<br/>
depression.  This time of year I&#39;m the most<br/>
vulnerable, so, I do go out enough to get the sun on<br/>
my face and the wind in my hair, even when it&#39;s<br/>
freezing.  Just a walk around the block, sometimes. <br/>
Alex is old enough to stay home tho, now, while I&#39;m<br/>
gone for 15 minutes, so that doesn&#39;t help you much! <br/>
But exercising inside might.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. I&#39;d love to hear what everybody else does when<br/>
they go a bit stir crazy, tis the season, after all.</div>

If I&#39;m mindful about my attitude, it is for me, too.  So you&#39;re only <br/>
as strange as me.  (That&#39;s not saying much.)<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve always walked, too, and that seems nearly impossible when <br/>
Michael travels -- and it has been *so* cold lately. I should work on <br/>
the inside exercise more -- even yoga and stretching would probably <br/>
help.  I hadn&#39;t thought of doing those when I felt like going out -- <br/>
I tend to do them more when I&#39;m stressed or too busy, not when I&#39;m <br/>
not busy enough.  So thanks for the input.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

Holly and I went to Target last night.  Took our time.  Mostly socks and <br/>
underwear, one toy she knew she wanted before she got there, a pair of new <br/>
kid-Fiskars, a box of cereal on sale.   Leisurely, warm, safe, not too far from home.<br/>
<br/>
I got on-sale $5 house shoes for my husband.  Big yet cheap thrills!<br/>
