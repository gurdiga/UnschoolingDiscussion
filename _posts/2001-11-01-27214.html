That is funny!  We were there off of Spinnaker road.  I haven&#39;t been to<br/>
Alaska in nine years but my brother in law tells me they paved Hollywood<br/>
and Vine!  Can you believe it?  When we lived there though we still had<br/>
moose on our front porch and ( me hopping up and down ) on the path to<br/>
the out house!   I miss it.<br/>
