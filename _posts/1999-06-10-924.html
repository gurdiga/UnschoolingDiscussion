<div id="ygrps-yiv-818727392">Andi, I feel that it is important that on an unschooling list that we need to<br/>
be very aware that *teaching* is a very loaded word. You wrote:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I personally cant say that. I will help isaac learn which some people call<br/>
&gt; teaching whenever he wants or asks. Maybe i am misunderstanding soemthing<br/>
&gt; here or maybe i am just not a unschooler. i thought i was.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When you help someone learn what they ask you to help them with, then yes,<br/>
that is unschooling. When you *help* someone by teaching them what you think<br/>
they want/need to learn, then you are treading on more uncertain ground. You<br/>
may know that in order for your child to learn his desired x, he first needs<br/>
to learn another step, y. But until he has recognised that for himself, any<br/>
teaching is not, IMO, unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
For many people *teaching* bears the connotations of force / imposition / lack<br/>
of choice / an emphasis on something imposed from without, while *learning*<br/>
almost invariably implies something internal, something done and controlled by<br/>
the learner. As unschoolers (or in my case, aspiring unschoolers), we try to<br/>
keep that emphasis on the learner. One way we can remind ourselves of this is<br/>
through the careful use of language. I try to think and speak of myself as a<br/>
facilitator or a helper. My children (18, 15, 12, 9) may not have been to<br/>
school for more than a few weeks, but they live in the world, they have<br/>
friends at school, they watch TV, they have picked up that meaning of *teach*.<br/>
So I feel that, although some may not feel like that about the word, it is<br/>
better to avoid using it when talking about unschooling, just to avoid<br/>
confusion, and better not to use it with one&#39;s children, in preparation for<br/>
the time when they may interpret it negatively.<br/>
<br/>
However, the use of a word in a different way to others does not change your<br/>
personal reality :-) You can use the word teach and still be an unschooler -<br/>
it&#39;s just that others may not recognise you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-378193007">CArol, thanks for your reply. you cleared up many things for me.<br/>
<br/>

he has to isnt.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>what about the fact that isaac wanted to learn divison with a remainder and<br/>
said that i thought it would be easier to learn regular division first. is<br/>
that what you mean?<br/>

<br/>
I would have shown him both ways right then and there, and he can tell you <br/>
when he&#39;s confused.  What if you decide he WOULD be confused, but you&#39;re <br/>
wrong?  What if he can learn it all at once because 1) he asked and 2) he&#39;s <br/>
ready and 3) he knows more than you think he does?<br/>
<br/>
A &quot;lesson&quot; with unschoolers might last 30 seconds, or three hours.  We&#39;ve <br/>
found ourselves on the floor in the library at our house at midnight with <br/>
books all around because the kids have gotten interested in some question, <br/>
and until they stop asking more and looking at whatever I haul off the shelf <br/>
and show them, wee don&#39;t quit.  I don&#39;t look at the clock and say, &quot;That&#39;s 45 <br/>
minutes; let&#39;s meet back heere tomorrow night, same time.&quot;   And sometimes <br/>
they ask a question with the perfect potential for me to do a three hour <br/>
theme party, but they really just want a five word answer, and with &quot;Thanks!&quot; <br/>
they&#39;re off...<br/>
<br/>
It can be difficult for new unschoolers to accept that learning doesn&#39;t come <br/>
in half hour or hour long blocks.  <br/>

to make a decision cus i am grown up. and It is my responsibilty to keep<br/>
him safe. when it comes to knives, I would not let him just pick it up and<br/>
play with it. he wanted to do that 2 but i said, yes you can use it but<br/>
first you have to learn a bit about it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I fuuly accept that. we just finished an hour long conversation on G-d. But<br/>
I will say that at 10 pm at nite i am not up to looking up things and<br/>
having big discussions. Isaaac can but my mind is gone by then<br/>
