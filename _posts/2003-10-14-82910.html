<div id="ygrps-yiv-964236951">-=-Maybe, it is better to say some parents are abusive instead of some<br/>
homeschooling parents abusive.  It rellly does not matter which group they<br/>
fall into because they belong to every group out there. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This was how I felt about the subject.  Replace the word &quot;homeschooling&quot;<br/>
with &quot;black&quot; or &quot;gay&quot; and now you can see what I felt was wrong with the<br/>
program.  The American public fears homeschoolers the way they feared (and<br/>
still fear) people of other races, creeds, religions or sexual orientations.<br/>
It is not ok for a respected news show to feed into that fear by making it<br/>
sound like those kids were abused because they were homeschooled, even if it<br/>
does happen sometimes.   Neighbors will now watch neighbors looking for this<br/>
new threat.  &quot;Some of my best friends are homeschoolers.  I have no problem<br/>
with people homeschooling, but do they have to talk about it in public.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Asking for more regulations for Child Protective Services is old news.<br/>
People have been there done that.  Asking for more regulations for<br/>
homeschoolers is something new and exciting.  CBS slanted the show and<br/>
focused on what would boost their ratings.  And it worked.  They got a whole<br/>
bunch of people who woudn&#39;t have normally watched the show to watch it last<br/>
night and a lot of those people are planning on watching it tomorrow.  They<br/>
got probably every homeschooler in America within an earshot of the internet<br/>
talking about it.  They&#39;ve been flooded today with emails, letters and phone<br/>
calls.<br/>

Donald and Lisa Boss filed the proper reports in Michigan to keep getting<br/>

The Edgar&#39;s were all about religious discipline and other members of<br/>

Why home may not be the best classroom<br/>
<br/>
HUGH REILLY<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
IN A survey, 30 per cent of parents said they could educate their children<br/>
better than schoolteachers, a figure that should greatly please the<br/>
profession. After all, it compares favourably with the 100 per cent of prison<br/>
inmates who believe they could have done better than their lawyers. But<br/>
teachers must not allow this public vote of confidence to lead to<br/>
complacency.<br/>
<br/>
The Scottish Executive is currently inviting feedback on its decision to cave<br/>
in to the vociferous home education lobby. The proposed new guidelines<br/>
seem to allow scope for a crank to go undetected. More parents may decide<br/>
to keep children in the four walls of home.<br/>
<br/>
Parents have been pupils, ergo they are education experts, in much the<br/>
same way that telly addicts of medical soaps can self-diagnose all manner<br/>
of ailments without recourse to so-called &quot;health professionals&quot;. For this<br/>
reason, surely it is proper that the Executive hands over educational<br/>
responsibility to those mums and dads who believe they could do a better<br/>
job than overpaid classroom duds such as yours truly.<br/>
<br/>
To be fair, parents already do a wonderful job when their kids are young.<br/>
They encourage literacy skills by reading bedtime stories, albeit abridged<br/>
versions as they miss out every other page to ensure the bonding<br/>
experience ends in time for the start of EastEnders. Other kids have<br/>
numeracy skills developed at a very early age, e.g. when dad walks out of<br/>
their life, 2 minus 1 equals single parenthood.<br/>
<br/>
Mater and pater could theoretically teach certain aspects of the curriculum.<br/>
I’m certain that some hard-bodied, toned-up pecs parents would be able to<br/>
pass on physical fitness techniques but what about the teenagers of the<br/>
chocoholic, chain-smoking chumps trudging the shopping malls in search of<br/>
the nearest McDonalds? It’s a recipe for an even greater rate of obesity<br/>
among the young.<br/>
<br/>
History lends itself to parental involvement and we are blessed in Glasgow<br/>
that so many dads apparently live and breathe dates and events. Go to<br/>
Govan on match days and see the proud parent with his &quot;1690 No<br/>
Surrender&quot; scarf while at Parkhead his counterpart strolls along sporting a<br/>
natty &quot;1916 Up The ’Ra&quot; tammy.<br/>
<br/>
Mum could run in-house drama workshops, having gleaned great acting<br/>
experience from those occasions when called to the school to account for<br/>
her child’s behaviour. Some can do &quot;upset&quot; when the headteacher<br/>
sensitively informs them they have given birth to the anti-Christ. It is right<br/>
that drama teachers should be made redundant because anyone can act -<br/>
check out River City - and there is a close link between the popularity of<br/>
drama and levels of academic attainment. It’s not an exact science but<br/>
show me a school with a large drama department and I’ll show you a school<br/>
with poor SQA results.<br/>
<br/>
There would be far-reaching consequences if almost one-third of mums and<br/>
dads decided to home educate their offspring. For one thing, financing<br/>
McCrone would be easier as a result of the massive downsizing in schools,<br/>
saving pots of cash for council taxpayers - except for those living in local<br/>
authorities that are tied into PPP contracts for the next 30 years.<br/>
<br/>
At a stroke, the issue of class size would be eliminated as a consequence<br/>
of the mass exodus. Instead of picking up crisp packets and coke cans<br/>
from the playground, janitors would be brushing up tumbleweed blown into<br/>
ghost schools. Fewer kids means fewer fights, less bullying. Gosh, it might<br/>
result in fewer teenage pregnancies given the youngsters would have a<br/>
diminished partner pool to choose from. Better still, the number of<br/>
exclusions would fall, offering the Executive the opportunity to declare its<br/>
social inclusion policy a great success.<br/>
<br/>
The prosaic truth is that sales of Prozac would increase a hundredfold if<br/>
parents had to spend more time with their issue. Thankfully, 70 per cent of<br/>
adults realise that teachers do a good job most of the time.</div>

So wait.<br/>
The 100 percent of prison inmates have reason to believe their lawyers didn&#39;t <br/>
do so well.  Every one of them is in prison!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the schools are only failing to provide good education for 30% of their <br/>
students, and maybe those are the 30% of parents who think they could do <br/>
better!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe teachers are NOT smarter than the population at large.  <br/>

Spurious is too weak a word for that kind of argument.<br/>

OOOh, THAT will convince some parents that teachers are sensitive and <br/>
concerned about their children.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It’s not an exact science but<br/>
<br/>
show me a school with a large drama department and I’ll show you a school<br/>
<br/>
with poor SQA results.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
REALLY.<br/>
Not even a vague science.<br/>
That&#39;s crazy.  Drama and music departments seem often to attract the <br/>
brightest kids, but maybe doing something REAL (music, drama) detracts from the <br/>
attention they pay to more theoretical distant trivia.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The prosaic truth is that sales of Prozac would increase a hundredfold if<br/>
<br/>
parents had to spend more time with their issue. Thankfully, 70 per cent of<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thanks to schools, parents do NOT &quot;have to&quot; spend more time with their issue.<br/>
Only those who WANT to do it, and they end up with less stress.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll be embarrassed about his uninformed opinion someday if he lives long <br/>
enough.<br/>

Do Scots teachers have a union that chiefly functions to keep their <br/>

&gt;&gt;Shyrley, I do believe that the UK educrats are learning by watching the US.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Gotta reign those wackos in before they become too strong in number and then<br/>
&gt;&gt;you have a *real* media battle on your hands.  If they can keep the<br/>
&gt;&gt;homeschooling movement from growing too large over here, they won&#39;t have the<br/>
&gt;&gt;problems the US has with them.<br/>

&gt;       It was my impression that the &quot;movement&quot; already is stronger in the UK <br/>
&gt;than here. Does anyone know more?  JJ<br/>

follow a curriculum. Thanks to EO and the home-educators who make sure <br/>
nothing is whittled away and the local Education Authorities don&#39;t <br/>
re-interpret the law to their own advantage.<br/>
Fingers crossed it stays that way.<br/>
