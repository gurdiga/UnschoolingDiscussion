&lt;&lt; Then they could say, &quot;I really like the idea of unschooling but I&#39;m <br/>
too nervous, so we do formal math and try to relax with everything <br/>
else.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They probably aren&#39;t aware there are any purist unschoolers out there, though.<br/>
<br/>
One problem with saying okay about &#39;just reading or just math&#39; is the other <br/>
end of the &quot;I unschool parttime.&quot;  Some of us have seen people come and say <br/>
&quot;I use a curriculum, but we unschool in the summer.&quot;  Or &quot;my kids unschool on <br/>
the weekends and late afternoons when their work is done.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a misuse of the term, I&#39;m definitely sure.<br/>
