<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404282468">My neighbor has a bumper sticker that reads &quot;Don&#39;t believe everything you<br/>
think.&quot;  Figuring out what you believe (not what you think, to be true or<br/>
untrue) seems to be at the crux of why, how and when one chooses unschooling<br/>
as a way of life.  <br/>
<br/>
I am brand new to unschooling.  My daughter is just under 4 so I am new to<br/>
everything as a parent.  I joined this list because I WANT to be challenged<br/>
to explore why this thing called &quot;unschooling&quot; calls to me so deeply.  I<br/>
think those of us who grew up in happy stable homes and who had unique and,<br/>
what would now be called &quot;alternative,&quot; school experiences are at an extreme<br/>
advantage when it comes time to explain why we unschool.  Just as people who<br/>
come from intact families are at an advantage when it comes to beating the<br/>
statistics of divorce, simply because &quot;non-divorce&quot; is what we know.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is actually kind of funny that this discussion could be reduced<br/>
(inappropriately, I realize) to the question &quot;Who can unschool?&quot;  Speaking<br/>
for my family alone, &quot;unschooling&quot; is just a name that we can use to align<br/>
ourselves with others who have made the decision that living our lives as<br/>
free and equal individuals is our priority, our goal, our challenge and our<br/>
contribution to, what we hope, is a change in society.  Looking at our idea<br/>
of &quot;unschooling&quot; we might as well ask the question &quot;Who can live their<br/>
lives?&quot;  I think the confidence and self-esteem needed to comfortably go<br/>
against the status quo with these unschooling choices, comes from either a)<br/>
past experiences , b) an INCREDIBLE ability to have dialogues (internal and<br/>
external) about one&#39;s beliefs and goals, and/or c) the equally incredible<br/>
ability to open oneself up to possibilities that have NEVER been experienced<br/>
simply because one can &quot;see&quot; (rationally or with one&#39;s heart) that this is<br/>
the &quot;right&quot; thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what our unschooling life will look like.  I do know that<br/>
when people ask me why we are homeschooling my short answer is &quot;The goals<br/>
and practices of institutional education do not match the goals and<br/>
priorities we have for our family&quot;--you should hear my &quot;long&quot; answer!!! ;)<br/>
<br/>
I am really loving everything that is being written about this topic,<br/>
especially what Sandra and Pam have written today.  I can&#39;t wait to hear<br/>
what others say (there are almost 500 people on this list for heaven&#39;s<br/>
sake).  Anyway, these are the thoughts and ramblings of a major newbie!<br/>

That&#39;s okay.   Lots just read once in a while online.  Lots read but don&#39;t <br/>

One could call the necessary quality &#39;faith&#39;, &#39;intuition&#39;, &#39;optimism&#39; or <br/>
&#39;transcendance&#39;.   Maybe with a big dollop of &#39;courage&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Can we twist Thomas Edison&#39;s famous quote?  Is unschooling 90% <br/>
inspiration and 10% perspiration?  I think the inspiration is a <br/>
necesssity.  Without it the whole endeavor is going to be flat.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t consider unschooling any more surprising or miraculous than the <br/>
fact that tiny seeds grow into incredible flowering plants.  Of course, <br/>
I actually consider the latter to be pretty fricking miraculous.<br/>

Just being able to admit that upfront is a huge leap forward.  There&#39;s <br/>
nothing more annoying than the mother of a 3 yo who thinks she&#39;s got it all down <br/>
pat.  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-998420076">Surely someone here --probably several someones -- can answer this for me.<br/>
 <br/>
What kind of set-up do we need to sustain caterpillars thru the chrysalis stage to butterflies/moths?  I&#39;ve just listened to a 20 minute monologue from Andy about his grand plans to capture caterpillars (long his favorite springtime activity) and raise them to cocoon so he can watch them emerge as butterflies and set them free?<br/>
 <br/>
So, before the yard is crawling with caterpillars, what do I need to gather for him to be able to do this?  He&#39;s talked about this before, but last summer we were going away for the month of July, so I deferred it.  This year, he&#39;s disappointed there won&#39;t be a trip to Hawaii in summer (he&#39;s spent the last 3 summers there!) so I&#39;d like to have this happen for him.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The one time we tried it we had success. We found a caterpillar on some <br/>
dill plants, so we put it and some dill into a jar with a screen over the <br/>
top. Because we found it in late summer, it didn&#39;t emerge until the next <br/>
spring. We actually thought it was dead because it took so long.<br/>
<br/>
 From what I&#39;d read, the important thing is to feed it whatever it was <br/>
found on, with the assumption that that&#39;s what it eats. (Ours turned out to <br/>
be a Swallowtail.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-170736885">We do this all the time.  We have a lot of black swallowtail caterpillars<br/>
in our yard.  The first key is to know their food.  We let them get pretty<br/>
big on their own and then bring them in to a big jar and keep feeding them<br/>
the same stuff.  For ours it is fennel.  They eat A LOT.  In the jar also<br/>
put a stick, that is where they will make their chrysalis.  After they make<br/>
it, we move them to the butterfly habitat.  Ours is from Insect Lore  <br/>

great book that I have leant out that talks about how to build one and<br/>
raise caterpillars and moths and identifies common ones in all three<br/>

given some and kept them for most of a year on the kitchen table, through a <br/>
couple of cycles of babies (if I&#39;m remembering correctly). They are so cool <br/>
to watch.<br/>

 We did one of those butterfly houses where you send off for caterpillars<br/>
and they turn to butterflies.  It was just a cardboard box with a flower<br/>
painted on the inside.  There was some food material for the caterpillars<br/>
and I think that was about it.  Pretty low maintenance.<br/>
