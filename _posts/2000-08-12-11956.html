<div id="ygrps-yiv-353633019">Help!  I have a white....china? earthenware? (....anyway it&#39;s white and came <br/>
from Safeway) straight-sided casserole dish. It&#39;s become wedged in the glass <br/>
bowl from my newly-acquired, but already non-functional mixer. <br/>
<br/>
The casserole dish has slipped slightly, so that it&#39;s at a very slight angle <br/>
and, try as we might, we can&#39;t extricate it. We&#39;ve tried putting the miser <br/>
bowl in hot water and filling the casserole dish with very cold water. That&#39; <br/>
didn&#39;t work. I tried pushing a very thin bladed knife down between the two <br/>
bowls. It took ages even to find a place where I could get it between them, <br/>
and even then it didn&#39;t work. I also tried squirting dishwasher soap along <br/>
the rims, in the hope that some might filter through the gap and provide <br/>
lubrication, but that didn&#39;t work either. <br/>
<br/>
Is there one of those clever trick methods for separating jammed breakables? <br/>
In the same vein as the one for getting rings off fingers?  Or can anyone <br/>
think of another way of separating them, please, short of taking a hammer to <br/>
one of the two? All suggestions would be most gratefully received!<br/>
