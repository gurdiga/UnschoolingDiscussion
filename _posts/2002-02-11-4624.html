I suggest NOT putting in more than two examples. The portfolio review is not<br/>
to see everything that is done. Just samples. I date my work but only by<br/>
month (ex. 2/02 )<br/>

vague and maybe add one sample of work per subject.<br/>
The time and place must be mutually agreed upon. Generally they have an<br/>
office somewhere you can meet. I also recommend that kids be left out of the<br/>
meeting. It is not law for them to meet the kids, or see a &quot;classroom/study<br/>
area&quot;. They cannot ask for a schedule, attendance records, vaccination<br/>
records or anything above what is required. Manfred Smith and many others<br/>
worked really hard to get our laws changed to allow freedom. It is important<br/>
that we don&#39;t let the state take away those freedoms by setting precedents<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898994621">Hi Elissa, Pat, and all -<br/>
My understanding of the MD law is that we must show &#39;regular and <br/>
thorough instruction&#39; not necessarily that the child has learned <br/>
anything - which is what is expected of teachers, so to speak - just <br/>
teach, present the lesson....<br/>
<br/>
so my &#39;portfolio&#39; is an outline of each &#39;academic area&#39; and a few <br/>
bullet points of activities that we&#39;ve done that are <br/>
relevant...usually it is a list of field trips, discussion topics <br/>
that have come up, classes, activities, computer games,  videos and <br/>
books, etc....That&#39;s my &#39;thorough&#39; part.....Next to some of the <br/>
bullet points I&#39;ll put the approx. date...that&#39;s the &#39;regular&#39; <br/>
part....<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all done in hindsight bec. I don&#39;t follow plans very well - <br/>
(altho I make them pretty well!)....I just go through my calendar and <br/>
put activities in different categories - once I&#39;ve got a few in each <br/>
category, I&#39;m done....and it&#39;s all of a page and a half typed....<br/>
<br/>
I stay away from anything showing &#39;progress&#39; or &#39;grade level&#39; <br/>
stuff....altho I might include under math what topics have come up <br/>
and that could be interpreted as whether she is &#39;on grade&#39; or not....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just a different perspective - Elissa, I know you&#39;ve done <br/>
more &#39;work&#39; in this area bec of your role in the unschooling <br/>
community here so if you see that I&#39;m off base, please let me know!<br/>

YOu are absolutely right about the grade level thing. I had interpreted it<br/>
differently, I will read that section again. Our county recently asked for<br/>
the second review to be mailed in to the office I am so uncomfortable with<br/>
it because you are asked to fill out a form that requests A curriculum list,<br/>
texts and books inc. copyright date and grade level, types of assessments,<br/>
dated work samples, Indicate regular progress. Weekly schedule (from 9:00 am<br/>
to 3:00 pm M-F) It is totally non-compliant with the law. I think I will<br/>
call Manfred before sending it in.<br/>
