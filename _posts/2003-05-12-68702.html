<div id="ygrps-yiv-995516279">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Here in the Sacramento Valley of California, we have about 100 homeschool families in our county. What use to be a huge, diverse group of great families disolved last year into a very active member co-op and the remainder of those who have and always will homeschool. One group meets 1 time a month and has for 20 years, while the co-op meets each week. Things got really messy when the co-op scheduled a parkday at the same time/day as the monthly group. I laugh a little to know familes are driving past a well established parkday with wisdom from many long time homeschoolers to join in this other parkday. People no longer have as diverse a group to choice from. I no longer can see,learn from, all the different people that once showed me homeschooling works. Freindships have been lost due to disagreements and friendships are not being made due to seperate groups. Its sad. I feel the kids miss out the most. What use to be an all ages big monthly park day is now much smaller with large gaps in the ages of kids and the co-op tends to be all younger, mostly new to homeschooling families. So even in an area with lots of supportive families, friendships can come and go.<br/>
