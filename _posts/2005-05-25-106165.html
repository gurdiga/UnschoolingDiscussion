<div id="ygrps-yiv-476682999">My kids have met a new friend at the barn where they ride.  She is a nice<br/>
little girl who lives only a couple miles from our house.  The little girl<br/>
has come here a couple times and the girls went to her house last night for<br/>
dinner and to play for the first time.  It all went very well. She lives<br/>
with her grandparents and I&#39;ve met them and they are very nice and pretty<br/>
laid back.  But I find some of their conversations very funny/enlightening<br/>
because they come from such different background/expectations.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We were in the computer room at my house one day and the girls were playing<br/>
with their Breyer horses.  I was sitting at the computer and they played on<br/>
the floor behind me.    My 8 yo filled one of the troughs with water and put<br/>
it in the pasture fence on the rug.  The little friend kindly told her she<br/>
probably shouldn&#39;t do that because she might get in trouble if it spilled.<br/>
Dd replied, it&#39;s not milk, we can just put a towel on it wipe it up if it<br/>
spills.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When they came home last night from their play date, they were happy and<br/>
talking and bubbling with excitement.  It was a pretty site.  They spent a<br/>
few minutes telling me everything they did and what they ate.  Later on dd8<br/>
said that her friend asked her how many worksheets she does per day.  Dd<br/>
told her that she didn&#39;t do any.  And her friend asked her how she learned.<br/>
She told her she learns by loving horses and figuring out what to buy them.<br/>
