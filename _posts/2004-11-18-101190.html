A means of hiding<br/>
Home-schooling freedoms help parents who abduct children<br/>
<br/>
By Dennis J. Willard and Doug Oplinger<br/>
Beacon Journal staff writers<br/>
<br/>
Emily Fritts was 6 years old when her mother abducted her in <br/>
Staunton, Va.<br/>
<br/>
For the next eight years, Mary Outlaw Fritts and Emily lived on the <br/>
run in at least five other states: Tennessee, Oregon, Kansas, Alaska <br/>
and Montana. They assumed new identities, becoming Mary and Emily <br/>
Stutz.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Fritts took an additional step to keep her secret, something she <br/>
could not have done as easily 10 or 20 years earlier in most states: <br/>
She home-schooled Emily.<br/>
<br/>
Each year, thousands of parents in custody cases abduct their <br/>
children. These parents must elude spouses, the police, state <br/>
agencies, the FBI and a legion of organizations dedicated to finding <br/>
missing children.<br/>
<br/>
Parents who abduct children live quiet lives on the run. They canmove <br/>
into a community, claim they are home schooling and avoid answering <br/>
questions or providing proof of their past.<br/>
<br/>
How many abductors home-school?<br/>
<br/>
No one knows.<br/>
<br/>
No one is trying to find out.<br/>
<br/>
Even if someone were to attempt to determine the extent of the <br/>
problem, most state laws are written so loosely that it is impossible <br/>
to track children through a system they have in common: education.<br/>
<br/>
When children move from one public school to the next, their records <br/>
follow them. Most private schools request prior academic files, <br/>
although some private schools -- mainly religious ones -- do not.<br/>
<br/>
In Ohio, parents notify their school district that they are going to <br/>
home-school. They do not need to ask for permission.<br/>
<br/>
The local superintendent cannot ask any questions about the family or <br/>
children, including where the family lived prior to moving into the <br/>
district. Requesting prior academic records is forbidden.<br/>
<br/>
Ohio is considered a moderate state for oversight and accountability.<br/>
<br/>
In Colorado, home-schooling parents must notify a school district, <br/>
but not necessarily the one in which they live. A parent who wants to <br/>
home-school can register with a district separated by more than 100 <br/>
miles of mountainous terrain, making it difficult for that district <br/>
to check on the family.<br/>
<br/>
In other states, such as Texas and Michigan, where home-schooling <br/>
laws are even looser, families are not required to notify their <br/>
district. In these states, compulsory education has, in effect, been <br/>
abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
For Emily&#39;s father, Rodney Fritts, the eight years trying to find his <br/>
daughter were frustrating and expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Four FBI agents and the National Center for Missing and Exploited <br/>
Children offered no answers, so Fritts paid $50,000 to hire a private <br/>
investigator. Overall, the ordeal cost him $450,000 in attorney&#39;s <br/>
fees and losses he incurred trying to keep up the search.<br/>
<br/>
``It was like looking for a needle in a haystack,&#39;&#39; he said. ``When <br/>
(Emily) first disappeared, I thought she would be home-schooled <br/>
because there was no way she was going to be put in public <br/>
schools.... ,&#39;&#39; Fritts said.<br/>
<br/>
The push to find children<br/>
<br/>
After a series of high-profile kidnapping, rape and murder cases in <br/>
the late 1990s, the federal government and most state legislatures <br/>
passed laws to alert communities to potential threats from sex <br/>
offenders and other criminals.<br/>
<br/>
States also createdimmediate-response systems, called Amber Alerts, <br/>
that are triggered as soon as a child is reported missing.<br/>
<br/>
The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, formed by <br/>
Congress in 1984 as a private, nonprofit organization, is a <br/>
clearinghouse for information about abducted, endangered and sexually <br/>
exploited children. The agency works closely with the FBI and U.S. <br/>
Department of Justice.<br/>
<br/>
The department&#39;s most recent survey on missing children is a snapshot <br/>
of 1999, when 1.3 million new cases were reported. The number of long-<br/>
term abductions -- the type that might require home schooling to <br/>
maintain obscurity -- is much smaller.<br/>
<br/>
A Beacon Journal analysis of national center data from 1990 through <br/>
the summer of 2004 found that 1,000 to 1,200 long-term cases of <br/>
missing children involving a family member are reported to the center <br/>
annually.<br/>
<br/>
No data kept on any link<br/>
<br/>
When the national center, the FBI and the Justice Department were <br/>
asked whether home schooling hindered attempts to locate missing <br/>
children, the question appeared to catch spokesmen off guard.<br/>
<br/>
Paul Bresson, an FBI spokesman, said his agency does not have data <br/>
linking abductions and home schooling.<br/>
<br/>
``We&#39;ve seen a few cases where that has happened,&#39;&#39; Bresson said. <br/>
``It&#39;s probably more than likely something has probably happened in <br/>
the past, maybe even on more than one occasion, but how pervasive it <br/>
is or how frequently those kinds of scenarios come up, I don&#39;t know.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
He said the FBI has similar difficulty tracking children through the <br/>
public school system because privacy laws prevent state education <br/>
departments from compiling specific information on individual <br/>
students.<br/>
<br/>
Justice Department officials reiterated the FBI&#39;s assertions.<br/>
<br/>
The national center said it received 14,980 reports of a noncustodial <br/>
parent abducting a child between 1990 and July 2004. The center <br/>
helped to locate 12,746 of the children, a recovery rate of about 85 <br/>
percent.<br/>
<br/>
Executive Director Ben Ermini said the center is not an investigative <br/>
or research agency. It routinely collects information on abducted <br/>
children, including personal characteristics, family members, and <br/>
where the child was taken from and eventually found.<br/>
<br/>
Details in the center&#39;s recovery reports might mention that a child <br/>
was home-schooled if that was volunteered by another agency that <br/>
conducted the investigation, Ermini said.<br/>
<br/>
``We just don&#39;t track that type of information. We don&#39;t ask the <br/>
question of families or the law enforcement agencies that locate <br/>
these children,&#39;&#39; he said.<br/>
<br/>
Cases counted<br/>
<br/>
Responding to a Beacon Journal request, the national center <br/>
identified 13 cases involving 18 recovered children since 1990 in <br/>
which the family was home schooling.<br/>
<br/>
``That doesn&#39;t mean that there weren&#39;t hundreds of other kids that <br/>
were recovered that were home-schooled, but they never mentioned it <br/>
in the report,&#39;&#39; Ermini said.<br/>
<br/>
In its research of a shorter period of time, the Beacon Journal found <br/>
18 more cases that the national center did not identify -- involving <br/>
28 abducted children -- in which home schooling reportedly was <br/>
occurring. The newspaper reviewed thousands of articles published <br/>
since 1997.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probable that the Beacon Journal&#39;s research is incomplete. <br/>
Abductions and reunions aren&#39;t always the subject of news coverage. <br/>
Also, newspapers and other publications don&#39;t always note whether a <br/>
child was home-schooled while in hiding.<br/>
<br/>
Call for regulation<br/>
<br/>
The executive director of Vanished Children&#39;s Alliance, a California-<br/>
based agency that is the nation&#39;s oldest and second-largest <br/>
organization dedicated to finding missing children, said an abducting <br/>
parent would be motivated to keep the child out of schools and away <br/>
from other children and adults.<br/>
<br/>
Georgia K. Hilgeman-Hammond said law enforcement agencies should be <br/>
collecting data on abducting parents, including whether they use home <br/>
schooling to elude authorities.<br/>
<br/>
``This is a way to keep the child out of the mainstream,&#39;&#39; she said.<br/>
<br/>
Hilgeman-Hammond thinks state and federal lawmakers should hold <br/>
parents more accountable by requiring them to notify their local <br/>
districts that they are home schooling and to provide prior academic <br/>
records.<br/>
<br/>
The Beacon Journal also found cases in which the national center was <br/>
involved in helping to find the abducted child but had not determined <br/>
the child was home-schooled.<br/>
<br/>
In one such case, Melissa Ann Gooding was caught in Corinth, Texas, <br/>
in 2002 after the national center&#39;s routine request for an update on <br/>
the case prompted the Adams County, Ill., sheriff to renew the search <br/>
for the mother and her daughter, Lisa.<br/>
<br/>
They had disappeared in 1990, about the time Lisa Gooding&#39;s father in <br/>
Illinois was awarded custody. Melissa Ann Gooding lived in several <br/>
states; among them were Illinois and Texas, where no registration for <br/>
home schooling is required.<br/>
<br/>
In Texas, home schooling is so common that most people don&#39;t think <br/>
twice about a home-schooling family living nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Adams County Deputy Clay Doan tracked Melissa Ann Gooding&#39;s parents <br/>
and sister to the outskirts of Corinth, where a game warden, who <br/>
regularly set traps for snakes and bobcats near the home, helped <br/>
identify the family -- including the missing mother and daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Doan said that Lisa Gooding was home-schooled and her mother had <br/>
never told her that she was abducted.<br/>
<br/>
Doan, who followed the girl&#39;s progress through the court proceedings <br/>
and afterward, said she was several grades behind for her age when <br/>
she was placed in a public school.<br/>
<br/>
The mother was convicted of a felony and granted supervised <br/>
visitation, Doan said.<br/>
<br/>
Girl found in Streetsboro<br/>
<br/>
Unlike the national center, the FBI or the Department of Justice, <br/>
Deborah Aylward considers home schooling in her searches. As a <br/>
private investigator, she knows it offers a way to hide children.<br/>
<br/>
Aylward heads Home Fires, a group from Virginia that offers legal and <br/>
investigative services to parents looking for lost children.<br/>
<br/>
On a cold afternoon in February 2002, Aylward sat outside a home in <br/>
Streetsboro, waiting for local police to arrive. Minutes earlier, she <br/>
had witnessed a young girl in a dress walk quickly from a car to the <br/>
home, a coat pulled over her head.<br/>
<br/>
For three weeks, Aylward had been tracking Gail Perkins, a 6-year-old <br/>
abducted by her father five years earlier from her home in <br/>
Greensboro, N.C.<br/>
<br/>
Gail&#39;s mother, Nikki Jones, had turned to Aylward and Home Fires <br/>
after the FBI, the national center and four private investigators <br/>
were unable to locate the girl.<br/>
<br/>
When the police arrived at the Streetsboro home, they found Gail and <br/>
her grandmother hiding in a bedroom closet.<br/>
<br/>
Streetsboro police said that Gail wasn&#39;t enrolled in school and that <br/>
the family said she was home-schooled.<br/>
<br/>
Aylward said she found Gail by focusing on the extended family of her <br/>
father, Adam Perkins.<br/>
<br/>
For five years, as they moved from state to state, Gail had been told <br/>
that her grandmother was her mother. Law enforcement officials <br/>
believe the family was in southern Virginia before moving to <br/>
Streetsboro.<br/>
<br/>
Evasion and tracking<br/>
<br/>
``It&#39;s very hard to disappear in the United States today,&#39;&#39; Aylward <br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
She said someone in hiding must stop using a Social Security number <br/>
and credit for purchases. The person needs to find work that pays <br/>
under the table, use a post office box instead of a mailing address <br/>
and register vehicles in someone else&#39;s name.<br/>
<br/>
``School is a major issue,&#39;&#39; Aylward said.<br/>
<br/>
In her experience, many abducting parents either home-school or <br/>
enroll the children in an obscure religious school that doesn&#39;t ask <br/>
for student records, she said.<br/>
<br/>
``In most of the cases I have handled over the past 10 years, home <br/>
schooling has been a factor,&#39;&#39; Aylward said, adding she has handled <br/>
about 75 cases.<br/>
<br/>
When someone is caught with a child, they say as a defense that they <br/>
are home schooling, she said. ``It&#39;s a great cover. `I&#39;m home <br/>
schooling my kids.&#39; &#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
But, she said, home schooling is often only a cover.<br/>
<br/>
``They are living a fugitive lifestyle. Schooling is not high on <br/>
their list,&#39;&#39; Aylward said. ``They&#39;re protecting their own butts from <br/>
prosecution and how they can lay low. I don&#39;t think there is home <br/>
schooling at all. I don&#39;t think these children are schooled <br/>
whatsoever.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
She thinks legitimate home-schooling families should be concerned <br/>
that these parents are tainting the movement&#39;s reputation.<br/>
<br/>
The same laws that empower a parent to home-school can provide cover <br/>
to abducting parents.<br/>
<br/>
``It&#39;s a loophole in the whole mess,&#39;&#39; Aylward said. ``Home schooling <br/>
should not be looked at as a method of harboring abducted children.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
She estimated that abductor families truly were home schooling in <br/>
about 10 percent of the cases she has investigated.<br/>
<br/>
``It&#39;s a great way to deflect attention about why children are home <br/>
all day and not going to school. Who is going to call first? It&#39;s the <br/>
nosy old lady on the street who is going to say, `These kids aren&#39;t <br/>
in school,&#39; &#39;&#39; she said.<br/>
<br/>
``If I were a parent and I moved into a neighborhood, it&#39;s like being <br/>
in the witness-protection program. I would make friends with <br/>
everybody, introduce my kids under an alias and say they were being <br/>
home-schooled, and that would be it,&#39;&#39; Aylward said.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Out of the sunlight&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Linda Shay Gardner, a Bethlehem, Pa., lawyer who specializes in <br/>
abduction cases and sits on the board of The Committee for Missing <br/>
Children, said no data exist on the link between home schooling and <br/>
missing children, but she has encountered the problem in her efforts <br/>
to reunite children with custodial parents.<br/>
<br/>
``They are home schooling to keep them out of the sunlight. I have <br/>
seen it in cases,&#39;&#39; she said.<br/>
<br/>
Gardner said states with laws like Ohio&#39;s make it almost impossible <br/>
to track a child.<br/>
<br/>
Parents are not going to be able to call the more than 600 school <br/>
districts in Ohio, Gardner said. ``Even the national center isn&#39;t <br/>
going to spend the time to call (all those) school districts.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
And that is just one state.<br/>
<br/>
Many abductors move their children from state to state.<br/>
<br/>
Nancy Hammer, director of the international division and policy <br/>
counsel at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, <br/>
said an abducting parent&#39;s claiming to be home schooling makes sense, <br/>
but her experience has been that little or no education is taking <br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
``Why would anybody bother to register, even in Ohio, that they are <br/>
home schooling if they abducted their child?&#39;&#39; she said. ``I would <br/>
just wait and see if anybody asked me, and then if I got caught, I&#39;d <br/>
say I didn&#39;t know I was supposed to register.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Hammer said the issue raises a number of questions that lack easy <br/>
answers, such as: Do relaxed rules for home schooling create an <br/>
environment that leads to an increase in abductions? Would an <br/>
abducting parent who already has violated laws by taking the child be <br/>
concerned about following home-schooling registration laws?<br/>
<br/>
Schooling missed<br/>
<br/>
The search for a missing child is, as Rodney Fritts said, like <br/>
looking for a needle in a haystack.<br/>
<br/>
For eight years, he and a team of investigators could not break the <br/>
case and find his daughter and her mother. Finally, in 2002, he went <br/>
on The Montel Williams Show. Afterward, someone in Montana spotted <br/>
his ex-wife, he said, and shortly thereafter they showed up at <br/>
Fritts&#39; back door.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Outlaw Fritts was convicted of a misdemeanor and fined $250. The <br/>
same judge recently issued a warrant for her arrest for failure to <br/>
provide child support, Rodney Fritts said.<br/>
<br/>
He learned that for eight years, his daughter had never attended <br/>
conventional private or public schools. Instead, she was home-<br/>
schooled or attended small religious schools run by a network of <br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
When Emily came home at age 15,Rodney Fritts offered her a choice of <br/>
school settings. She opted to enroll in Stuarts Draft High School, a <br/>
public school, as a freshman.<br/>
<br/>
Emily should have been a sophomore, but she had no high school <br/>
credits.<br/>
<br/>
She went to summer school, took extra courses and will graduate on <br/>
time in June 2005, with plans to go to college next fall.<br/>
<br/>
Rodney Fritts said their relationship was strained at first, but a <br/>
few months ago, Emily&#39;s attitude suddenly changed, and now she is <br/>
happy, positive and excited about school.<br/>
<br/>
Emily, now 18, has also become a standout long-distance runner on the <br/>
high school cross country and indoor and outdoor track teams.<br/>
<br/>
``She&#39;s got three letters in three different sports,&#39;&#39; Rodney Fritts <br/>
said. ``She couldn&#39;texcel in anything before without the threat of <br/>
being found.&#39;&#39;<br/>

-------<br/>
<br/>
How many were in school?<br/>
The stories I&#39;ve read of people who had been abducted by the other <br/>
(non-custodial) parent usually involved a kind of shaming brainwashing or flat-out lies <br/>
about the first parent, and threats of what awful things the other family had <br/>
or would do to the kid.<br/>
<br/>
Although there was some harsh stuff said about HSLDA here, I think this is <br/>
the very kind of situation they will jump back on and pretty hard.  They don&#39;t <br/>
want the government in their homes, maybe because of corporal punishment, maybe <br/>
just on principle.  So they like to comply outwardly (test scores, reports) <br/>
but they don&#39;t want social workers at their doors.  In that way they ARE <br/>
watchdogs for freedoms.  They want the freedom to teach a skewed view of history and <br/>
science and social realities, and so they will work to protect that freedom.  <br/>
I want the freedom to let my kids learn as many different versions of every <br/>
story they can come by, and so I want that freedom too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think, personally, that the problem isn&#39;t homeschooling, but the larger and <br/>
more complex problem of broken homes and the state of adults caring more <br/>
about themselves than about their children.  Yes, sure, there are TONS of cases in <br/>
which abducting a child is for the child&#39;s protection, but very often it&#39;s <br/>
just a tussle between two adults who couldn&#39;t get along before and can&#39;t get <br/>
along now, and the kid becomes a pawn, a victim.  I think schools add to all of <br/>
that.  I bet if someone could magically show all factors, that WAY more would <br/>
fit the scenario I&#39;m about to make up than any will EVER homeschool:<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this scenario would be more prevalent:<br/>
<br/>
Teens who had become discouraged and felt helpless met in high school, where <br/>
they were forced to go against their will.  Already estranged from families <br/>
for whatever all reasons (partly school&#39;s mechanisms to make kids more loyal to <br/>
school than to parents, which DOES happen), they clung to one another and got <br/>
pregnant.  Unprepared and rejected, they tried and failed to make a marriage <br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to counter with statistics about how many of those non-custodial <br/>
parents hated school and met the custodial parent in school and the mom was <br/>
pregnant before she was eighteen or nineteen, but might not have been had it <br/>
not been for school.<br/>
<br/>
Just speculation.<br/>
<br/>
And another thing, his articles are not even written as articles.  They&#39;re <br/>
like information dump, as though he were the fact-finder for someone else who <br/>
intended to write an article later.  I&#39;d expect them to have outline numbers on <br/>
every paragraph.  They&#39;re repetitive and mechanical.  What format is that <br/>
intended to be!?<br/>

regulations, they would just go underground, so all the additional<br/>
regulation in the world would not find them. They would undoubtedly tell<br/>
people they were homeschooling, and maybe even be able to talk about the<br/>
laws. For example anyone in our local group (in California) could *say* that<br/>
they have put in an R-4, and no-one would assume that they had not done so. <br/>
<br/>
In custody case abductions where one major motivation is probably a belief<br/>
on the part of the kidnapper that the child would be better off with them<br/>
than the custodial parent, maybe they *are* homeschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-701108787"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Maybe this scenario would be more prevalent:<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Teens who had become discouraged and felt helpless met in high school,<br/>

another and &gt;got pregnant.  Unprepared and rejected, they tried and<br/>
failed to make a &gt;marriage work.<br/>
<br/>
wow...that&#39;s my teenage love story!  minus the icky failed marriage<br/>
ending. ;) we&#39;re still together (and stronger than ever!) 8 years -and<br/>
three beautiful babies- later.  i feel like i&#39;ve escaped the practically<br/>
inevitable!  phew...color me relieved.<br/>
