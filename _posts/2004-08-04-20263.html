<div id="ygrps-yiv-629727965">This is the beginning of the reminder of the upcoming conference:<br/>
1)<br/>
I just wanted to remind those of you who have never been to the Live and<br/>
<br/>
Learn Conferences (and those of you who may have forgoten!) to bring a<br/>
sweater.  <br/>
Hotels can be quite chilly, and the conference room&#39;s temperature is<br/>
hard to  <br/>
control.<br/>
 <br/>
[] This conference by title sounds very interesting but I have never<br/>
heard of it.  I am obviously in the dark up here on Vancouver Island,<br/>
BC, Canada.  When is it? Where is it? What is the website as I presume<br/>
there is one?  <br/>
Thanks  <br/>
Susan</div>
