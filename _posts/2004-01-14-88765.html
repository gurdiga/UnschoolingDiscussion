<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744194207">I&#39;ve been having a conversation via email with my mother today about our homeschooling. It started when she asked me to have Sarah write out a letter or thank you note for the Christmas presents. I wrote her back that Sarah would be happy to, although she prefers to type rather than write by hand so I wanted her to have a head&#39;s up about that. My mother wrote back saying &quot;Sarah is 9 and needs to be hand writing things.  I will<br/>
send a written letter back when she hand writes a letter to me.  Its a requirement in life, and I&#39;m a good one for her to practice on.  If she was in school, she would have to hand write everything every day, I think she needs to be doing what she would have to do in<br/>
school.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
I wrote back &quot;Actually, she&#39;ll be 8 in March! Sarah does write by hand when<br/>
she wants to...she just prefers to type. She decided she wants to write<br/>
it by hand so she&#39;s working on it right now. I&#39;ll let her know that you will<br/>
write her back! <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not clear though on just what you think is a requirement in<br/>
life? Clear handwriting? The ability to properly format a handwritten or<br/>
typed letter, or the ability to communicate clearly/effectively through written<br/>
language? All can be easily learned when ready, and with ease when the<br/>
interest is there.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
And I asked her to tell me exactly what her concerns are so that we can discuss what we&#39;re doing and how so that she better understands where we&#39;re at, where we&#39;re going, and how we plan to get there. <br/>
<br/>
She wrote back that her concerns are much deeper than hand writing papers. I then said that I&#39;m not trying to be argumentative I just want to clarify her concerns and address them, whether or not she comes to agree with our methods. <br/>
 <br/>
She wrote back that she&#39;s not trying to antagonize me either, but that &quot;I  just expect some traditional educational goals because I know she&#39;s going to need them.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
SOOOO...<br/>
 <br/>
Now I&#39;m looking to write out some goals for them...yet we don&#39;t exactly HAVE any, at least not in the sense that she&#39;s looking for!<br/>
 <br/>
Any ideas?!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627804624">My question would be.....and I say this sweetly!!....why is your daughter&#39;s education any of your mother&#39;s business?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not up to her to &#39;expect some traditional educational goals&#39;.  That&#39;s not her place and, in my opinion, she&#39;s overstepping her bounds by a mile.<br/>
<br/>
My MIL doesn&#39;t agree with homeschooling and she has made that quite clear.  She doesn&#39;t even understand unschooling.  I put my foot down years ago and said, &quot;These are my children.  They are not your children.  How they are parented and schooled is between myself and my husband and is none of your business.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It has not come up for discussion since (but for 6 or 7 years, it was a constant source of disagreement and argument until I just had enough and &#39;blew up&#39;).<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t make my child write thank you notes, handwritten, typed or otherwise.  And for my mother to expect it in order to write to her own grandchildren (as in an &#39;or else&#39; ultimatum) wouldn&#39;t go over very big with me!<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t type up goals just for your mother&#39;s benefit.  She raised her children.  You&#39;re raising yours.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if it seems blunt!!  I&#39;m not fussing at you....honestly!  I have just been there, personally, and I no longer jump through anyone else&#39;s hoops!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My first idea is WHY?  What authority does your mom<br/>
have to ask for this?  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re 28, married and a mother yourself.  She has no<br/>
authority, legally or otherwise (I&#39;m thinking not even<br/>
morally/biblically here).  <br/>
<br/>
You really don&#39;t need another person telling you that<br/>
you have to do something, or that you must adjust to<br/>
their frame of reference!<br/>
<br/>
You did really well with the E.I. visit today.  I<br/>
would give your mom the same answer if you have to<br/>
tell her something.  Don&#39;t try to make unschooling<br/>
sound like traditional schooling just to please her.<br/>
<br/>
Your goals are so much more OTHER than the low<br/>
standards of traditional schooling that to try to<br/>
explain them that way would be a disservice to you and<br/>
your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Give your mom the same websites and book titles you<br/>
gave the social workers, and tell her that when she<br/>
has read them thoroughly, you will discuss it with<br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Goals for what?  To make grandma happy?  If that&#39;s what you mean, I let that one fly out the window years ago.  Grandma&#39;s happiness is up to her, not you or your kids.  If being yourselves isn&#39;t good enough, then what will be?  She said that she &quot;knows&quot; your daughter is going to need &quot;goals&quot;, but how can she possibly know what your daughter is going to do with her life?  It sounds like grandma has some pretty high expectations (and I&#39;m guessing she will just keep raising the bar), and depending on your daughter&#39;s personality, that could lead to disaster.  I stay away from expectations for my kids.  Too much potential for disappointment and discouragement.  <br/>
<br/>
I want my kids to be themselves, to believe in themselves and to trust their own judgement.  That&#39;s as far as my &quot;expectations&quot; go.  <br/>
<br/>
~~&quot;I  just expect some traditional educational goals because I know she&#39;s going to need them.&quot;~~<br/>
<br/>
That statement alone would be more than enough for me to have a long...&quot;talk&quot; with grandma.  What grandma expects is irrelavant.  I would let her know that.  (Keep in mind that I am very blunt and to the point when it comes to my kids.)  My FIL (and the rest of my inlaws) had this same attitude when we first started out.  It came down to me making it very clear that if their attitudes didn&#39;t change, they would see a lot less of  us.  Grandpa has rarely ever mentioned anything about schooling or education since then.  He has even expressed how impressed he is with my boys after seeing the &#39;results&#39; of our choices.  <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t bother with grandma&#39;s list of goals, but that&#39;s just me.  If anything, let your daughter make the list herself.  If that&#39;s not good enough...too bad.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t go out of my way to make someone else happy, regardless of who it is, if they don&#39;t bother trying to understand what we&#39;re doing.  Let grandma put out a little effort on changing the way she looks at things.  SHE needs to try to change, not you or your daughter.  Her concerns may be honest and heartfelt, but her methods could use a little tweaking.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
(If I misread your post, and this is not what grandma was meaning, then just disregard this, lol.)<br/>

Yes..after I sent that, as I was sitting here thinking about it, I was thinking &quot;Now wait a sec...I don&#39;t really have much else to say that I didn&#39;t ALREADY say in my letter explaining our decision to homeschool and discussing unschooling!&quot; I just went and reread that letter, having kept a copy of it, and I still don&#39;t think I have much else to say really. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if my mother is truly wanting to know more of what we&#39;re doing or if this is just another way for her to tell me that she doesn&#39;t approve of my choices regarding my life; and another way for her to tell me (as she has before!!!) that she thinks I&#39;m a bad parent. <br/>
 <br/>
So for now, I&#39;m not going to answer my mom unless she has specific concerns such as about Sarah&#39;s writing. I already addressed that, but I don&#39;t think she &quot;heard&quot; me address her concerns because of the way she later said her concerns were &quot;more&quot; than writing. <br/>
 <br/>
I could be wrong about it...but I don&#39;t know...and yes, my own mother is one of the most toxic people in my life!!!! I try to keep contact with her to a bare minimum because of it, but it isn&#39;t easy. <br/>
 <br/>
SIGH..! <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t need this right now so I&#39;m just going to put it aside unless she brings it up again!!<br/>

expectations? Granted, she is the grandmother and shares concern but this is <br/>
your DD and unless she is helping raise them I don&#39;t understand why you need to <br/>
meet her expectations. <br/>
<br/>
But maybe it&#39;s just that I&#39;m an old Mom and am just way past caring what my <br/>
Mom thinks. I love her but she don&#39;t live here.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Here&#39;s an example of what your mother should be saying from my very concerned-about-homeschooling MIL, &quot;You guys know I don&#39;t like this but really, you&#39;re the parents so I can&#39;t tell you what to do.&quot;<br/>
  You have your hands full Mamabeth, full to overflowing and don&#39;t need to add a pushy mom to that mix. Give her book titles and websites. Tell her you and Paul have made your decision and if she&#39;s concerned she needs to research it herself. You don&#39;t have time.<br/>
    I know it&#39;s hard because I have the same troubles with boundaries. What helps is drawing up the lines in my head BEFORE I go into any conversation with someone where I know boundaries could be crossed. If you&#39;re on the phone or writing letters, that&#39;s to your advantage because you can have your boundaries written down in front of you as a constant reminder. And if you don&#39;t know where those boundaries should be, certainly keep asking. After years of not enforcing them it&#39;s sometimes hard to even know where they should be. Good Luck.<br/>

If she were truly concerned, she&#39;d be using her library card, not you.<br/>

My question would be.....and I say this sweetly!!....why is your daughter&#39;s education any of your mother&#39;s business?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not up to her to &#39;expect some traditional educational goals&#39;.  That&#39;s not her place and, in my opinion, she&#39;s overstepping her bounds by a mile.<br/>
<br/>
My MIL doesn&#39;t agree with homeschooling and she has made that quite clear.  She doesn&#39;t even understand unschooling.  I put my foot down years ago and said, &quot;These are my children.  They are not your children.  How they are parented and schooled is between myself and my husband and is none of your business.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It has not come up for discussion since (but for 6 or 7 years, it was a constant source of disagreement and argument until I just had enough and &#39;blew up&#39;).<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t make my child write thank you notes, handwritten, typed or otherwise.  And for my mother to expect it in order to write to her own grandchildren (as in an &#39;or else&#39; ultimatum) wouldn&#39;t go over very big with me!<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t type up goals just for your mother&#39;s benefit.  She raised her children.  You&#39;re raising yours.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if it seems blunt!!  I&#39;m not fussing at you....honestly!  I have just been there, personally, and I no longer jump through anyone else&#39;s hoops!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-158310203">Beth - kids around her age often really DO like to get mail and that <br/>
can get them writing a bit, which is nice. Since this is a happenin&#39; <br/>
thing in your house - you might as well go all the way &lt;G&gt; and get her <br/>
a shoebox or other box, let her decorate it, cut some paper into <br/>
smaller sheets, get some little envelopes, and let her decorate those <br/>
for her own personal stationary (water color paints work well to make <br/>
stationary - you can write right over the background). Get her some <br/>
rubber stamps, some stickers, and if you want to go ALL out - a sealing <br/>
wax set.<br/>
There are calligraphy pens that are very cheap. You could get a quill <br/>
and ink for her. You could even make some stationary on the computer <br/>
with her name on the top. You can order pencils with a kid&#39;s name on <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
AND - she can have her own mailbox somewhere in the house - and YOU and <br/>
your husband can write her letters and put them in there for her to <br/>
find.<br/>
<br/>
If she likes some of this - then make a mailbox inside the house for <br/>
yourselves too - so she can write to you.<br/>
<br/>
My girls even sometimes played that one was the mail delivery person - <br/>
they&#39;d carry a big bag on their back and stick decorated boxes with <br/>
their own toys in them and deliver them to each other, getting a <br/>
signature to verify delivery (little ones who couldn&#39;t even write at <br/>
all just scribbled something very elaborate looking &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
At 12, 16, and 19 they still mail quite a few letters to friends - and <br/>
they are collaged on the outside. And my 19 yo and her friends mail <br/>
what they call &quot;packets&quot; to each other - a box filled with cheap things <br/>
that are meaningful or funny - nothing expensive, but they just LOVE to <br/>
get &quot;packets&quot; from each other. Collaging the outside of the box is half <br/>
of the fun.<br/>

Don&#39;t spend time on your mother than could be better spent with your <br/>
children.  Put her on the &quot;later if I have time list too&quot; if she&#39;s trying to get you <br/>
to jump through hoops to please her.    You have a job to do, and that&#39;s to <br/>

&gt;Sarah would be happy to, although she prefers to type rather than write by <br/>
&gt;hand so I wanted her to have a head&#39;s up about that. My mother wrote back <br/>
&gt;saying &quot;Sarah is 9 and needs to be hand writing things.  I will<br/>
&gt;send a written letter back when she hand writes a letter to me.  Its a <br/>
&gt;requirement in life, and I&#39;m a good one for her to practice on.  If she <br/>
&gt;was in school, she would have to hand write everything every day, I think <br/>
&gt;she needs to be doing what she would have to do in<br/>

posted at Unschooling.com message boards. This is the goals the Singapore<br/>
Ministry of Education has for its students:<br/>
<br/>
All Post-Secondary and Tertiary Students<br/>
<br/>
Students should :<br/>
- be morally upright, be culturally rooted yet understanding and respecting<br/>
differences, be responsible to family, community and country<br/>
- believe in our principles of multi-racialism and meritocracy, appreciate<br/>
the national constraints but see the opportunities<br/>
- be constituents of a gracious society<br/>
- be willing to strive, take pride in work, value working with others<br/>
- be able to think, reason and deal confidently with the future, have<br/>
courage and conviction in facing adversity<br/>
- be able to seek, process and apply knowledge<br/>
- be innovative - have a spirit of continual improvement, a lifelong habit<br/>
of learning and an enterprising spirit in undertakings<br/>
- think global, but be rooted to Singapore<br/>
<br/>
Potential Leaders should:<br/>
<br/>
- be committed to improving society<br/>

Beth - kids around her age often really DO like to get mail and that <br/>
can get them writing a bit, which is nice. Since this is a happenin&#39; <br/>
thing in your house - you might as well go all the way &lt;G&gt; and get her <br/>
a shoebox or other box, let her decorate it, cut some paper into <br/>
smaller sheets, get some little envelopes, and let her decorate those <br/>
for her own personal stationary (water color paints work well to make <br/>
stationary - you can write right over the background). Get her some <br/>
rubber stamps, some stickers, and if you want to go ALL out - a sealing <br/>
wax set.<br/>
There are calligraphy pens that are very cheap. You could get a quill <br/>
and ink for her. You could even make some stationary on the computer <br/>
with her name on the top. You can order pencils with a kid&#39;s name on <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
AND - she can have her own mailbox somewhere in the house - and YOU and <br/>
your husband can write her letters and put them in there for her to <br/>
find.<br/>
<br/>
If she likes some of this - then make a mailbox inside the house for <br/>
yourselves too - so she can write to you.<br/>
<br/>
My girls even sometimes played that one was the mail delivery person - <br/>
they&#39;d carry a big bag on their back and stick decorated boxes with <br/>
their own toys in them and deliver them to each other, getting a <br/>
signature to verify delivery (little ones who couldn&#39;t even write at <br/>
all just scribbled something very elaborate looking &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
At 12, 16, and 19 they still mail quite a few letters to friends - and <br/>
they are collaged on the outside. And my 19 yo and her friends mail <br/>
what they call &quot;packets&quot; to each other - a box filled with cheap things <br/>
that are meaningful or funny - nothing expensive, but they just LOVE to <br/>
get &quot;packets&quot; from each other. Collaging the outside of the box is half <br/>
of the fun.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;ve been having a conversation via email with my mother today about our <br/>
&gt;homeschooling. It started when she asked me to have Sarah write out a <br/>
&gt;letter or thank you note for the Christmas presents. I wrote her back that <br/>
&gt;Sarah would be happy to, although she prefers to type rather than write by <br/>
&gt;hand so I wanted her to have a head&#39;s up about that. My mother wrote back <br/>
&gt;saying &quot;Sarah is 9 and needs to be hand writing things.  I will<br/>
&gt;send a written letter back when she hand writes a letter to me.  Its a <br/>
&gt;requirement in life, and I&#39;m a good one for her to practice on.  If she <br/>
&gt;was in school, she would have to hand write everything every day, I think <br/>
&gt;she needs to be doing what she would have to do in<br/>
&gt;school.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wrote back &quot;Actually, she&#39;ll be 8 in March!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is telling. I have to wonder about a grandmother who is so sure about <br/>
what her grandchild needs but doesn&#39;t even remember how old she is.<br/>
