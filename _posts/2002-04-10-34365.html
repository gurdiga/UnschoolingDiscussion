was specifically stated that this list was only for UNschooling discussions <br/>
and that was the purpose of the list (not homeschoolers and other methods, <br/>
but UNschooling alone.)  I can respect that and that&#39;s why I feel I don&#39;t <br/>
belong. Eclectic homeschooling is perhaps a better group for me and I&#39;ll try <br/>
that community instead of this one.<br/>
The scriptures are a great guide indeed for these that are entrusted to us =)<br/>
Particularly the straight translation of &quot;train up a child in the way he <br/>
should grow&quot; - meaning according to their temperament, natural desires and <br/>
strengths given an emphasis so that they can be the person they are naturally <br/>
bent toward being.  Not that I would exclude all science and math from a <br/>
child I could clearly see was a writer and poetess type though. To me, that <br/>
would be robbing my child of a balanced education and would not be preparing <br/>
her for future studies beyond high school =)<br/>

Kristine, I see now how you came to that conclusion.  I think that if you<br/>
brought up your thoughts and opinions and the reasons for them and asked<br/>
how that would conflict or coincide with unschooling thought, and what<br/>
are the reasons others would do it differently, you could probably start<br/>
an interesting discussion and gain a lot of information regarding<br/>
unschooling.  I think that when people respond to a person&#39;s statement<br/>
abruptly and emphatically like they are the ultimate authority, it can<br/>
make a person wince.  Keep in mind that things often sound like they are<br/>
law when they are really just a person&#39;s effort to state what they<br/>
believe.  Sometimes, too, it seems like everyone is attacking because<br/>
there are so many reactions to one person&#39;s words or because it has<br/>
followed a thread and become something other than a response to the first<br/>
subject, but the person who started the subject thinks everyone is<br/>
talking about them instead of about theories and thoughts with no one&#39;s<br/>
name attached.  (am I confusing you, this run-on sentence is starting to<br/>
confuse me:))  <br/>
My experience so far with unschooling has been that when I hit bumps in<br/>
the road, I research until I find why it isn&#39;t working.  And I come away<br/>
from every obstacle with a better understanding of myself, my children,<br/>
and how much unschooling really does work for us.<br/>
Your daughter sounds like she loves to learn.  I&#39;m sure no matter what<br/>
method of learning she follows, she will be very successful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hope you find a good one and get lots of support.  Feel free to stay here <br/>
as well, if you want.  Or come back later.  Nobody says you have to <br/>
unschool to get something out of this list.  As long as you understand that <br/>
you *aren&#39;t* unschooling, you could still learn things if that was what you <br/>
wanted.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You may have misunderstood something here.  I don&#39;t think anybody could <br/>
exclude science and math from their daily living, so it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
excluded from their kids&#39; education.  You seem to believe that she wouldn&#39;t <br/>
find a way to learn more structured science and math if /when she needs <br/>
it.  I&#39;ve seen artsy type unschoolers plough through science and math in <br/>
order to get into programs that *they* wanted.  I just can&#39;t see any reason <br/>
to do it &quot;just because&quot;.  As one unschooling girl once told me, &quot;It doesn&#39;t <br/>
take a whole year to learn fractions.&quot;  She&#39;s well on her way into a career <br/>
as an opera singer, with a master&#39;s degree no less.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It certainly wasn&#39;t anything we addressed when our kids were small, <br/>
or even when they were older, but our two oldest sons both went into <br/>
trades which called for lots of math and science, and they&#39;ve really <br/>
excelled in all those trades (construction, car restoration, <br/>
electrician, and firefighting).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL! Jim (the electrician/firefigher) says when he needed to learn <br/>
about fractions and decimals his wife taught him both in the car <br/>
while they were en route to one of his first jobs (in Tennessee - it <br/>
took them four days to get there)! Now he does them in his head <br/>
faster than I can do them on paper.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, our oldest son John (the construction foreman turned <br/>
classic car restorer) and our only girl, Jody (22), both have a <br/>
strange kind of math they&#39;ve taught themselves. I don&#39;t know how to <br/>
explain it, but when John was down here around Easter (he lives in <br/>
Alaska) they were doing something math-related and both were <br/>
astonished to find that the other one understood their way of <br/>
thinking about numbers - both said nobody else had ever been able to <br/>
figure out how they did the processes and arrived at their answers.<br/>
