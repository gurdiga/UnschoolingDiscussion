<div id="ygrps-yiv-307284892">We have removed the toilet, sink and tub and some of the subfloor.  Jonathan <br/>
has embraced the concept of demolition with full enthusiasm.  The first time <br/>
he knocked out a piece of rotted flooring with a hammer was like the world <br/>
opening up for him.  He now has his own &quot;tool bucket&quot; and with almost every <br/>
trip to Home Depot he picks a new tool for his collection.<br/>
<br/>
It has been interesting to see how the attitude towards children varies among <br/>
the different departments at these stores.  They receive a lot of patience <br/>
and conversation in areas like lighting and flooring but in plumbing they are <br/>
barely tolerated.  I&#39;m glad the kids are getting a chance to see a woman <br/>
learn her way through all this.<br/>
<br/>
Night before last I was researching do-it-yourself plumbing repairs online.  <br/>
I had discovered an animated map of a typical home plumbing layout when <br/>
Jonathan came over.  He asked if I would explain what I was looking at which <br/>
became a lengthy discussion of hot water heaters, hot and cold supply pipes, <br/>
drainage, vents and how the water comes into the house and waste waters goes <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
When we started this project Jonathan was reluctant to move, we&#39;ve lived here <br/>
for 4 out his 5 years.  Now he is so invested in our new home he can hardly <br/>
wait to make the final move.  Of course, realizing that we WEREN&#39;T going to <br/>
leave all of our &quot;stuff&quot; (mainly his toys) behind helped.  Poor thing, for <br/>
about a week he was under the impression that it would all stay here.<br/>

Lines from a house to a septic system can freeze,  then stuff doesn&#39;t leave the house.  It just goes to one&#39;s basement,  Yeah!    This is what we learned today.<br/>

I want to move to somewhere warm!!!  WAAAAAA!<br/>

If you&#39;re completely redoing your plumbing, remember to put the &#39;air <br/>
hammer&#39; spacers on the ends of your plumbing lines (if copper/metal) and to <br/>
consider looking at an on-demand water heater rather than a tank water <br/>
heater.  Might save you some serious cash on your water-heating <br/>
bills!  (and the spacers&#39;ll save your ears from compression-hammering in <br/>
the pipes!)<br/>
<br/>
Plumbing&#39;s cool, isn&#39;t it!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our new home is on septic too but we haven&#39;t heard of any problems from the <br/>
neighbors on that front.  However, the pipes from the well are known to <br/>
freeze, all the neighbors rally and make sure everyone&#39;s hot water heaters <br/>
get turned off so the elements don&#39;t fry.<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully it doesn&#39;t get THAT cold often!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have PVC and CPVC, thankfully we discovered that the original <br/>
manufacturers had hooked up the HOT water with PVC before we put down the new <br/>
floor.  We replaced it and should even have the new toilet in today!  Woohoo!<br/>
<br/>
We are, in fact, considering an on-demand hot water heater!  We will probably <br/>
get one as soon as the new appliances are paid off.  And, I do think plumbing <br/>
is cool!  It has been fun piecing the puzzle of elbows, ball cock valves and <br/>
connectors from the ground to the faucet.<br/>

When you get one picked out, would you let me know which one you chose and why?<br/>
We&#39;re going to be in the market for one in the next 6 months/year and would <br/>
love an opinion from someone who looked at it all already!<br/>

time for some research!<br/>
