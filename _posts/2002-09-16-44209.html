<div id="ygrps-yiv-476779664"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I just want to say that I think your daughter&#39;s behavior is just &quot;her&quot;<br/>
&gt; and doesn&#39;t come from your parenting.  I hope you can believe that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can be explosive, and so I understand that pattern of behavior when it<br/>
occasionally pops up in my otherwise very calm son.  I think it must be much<br/>
harder to deal with when it&#39;s not your own personality, too.  I have to<br/>
agree that it&#39;s just &quot;her&quot; and not your parenting!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember you ever saying whether you perhaps worked a bit with your<br/>
daughter on some of the very basic anger/stress management skills.  The<br/>
little things we all do sometimes like counting to 3 very slowly or taking a<br/>
deep breath, walking away, etc.<br/>
<br/>
My son is also 6, and one thing that has helped him was learning to see his<br/>
&quot;triggers&quot; and how to cope when he feels the meltdown coming.  After a<br/>
number of times of going through what happened with him afterwards, he<br/>
learned to identify the point where he felt overwhelmed, and eventually we<br/>
could come up with things to do differently next time.  It&#39;s helped, though<br/>
not for every situation, of course.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s any consolation, I&#39;m finding 6 a lot easier than 5....maybe she&#39;s en<br/>
route to outgrowing it....!<br/>
