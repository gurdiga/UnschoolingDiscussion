&gt;&gt; Ned, in response, expresses himself:<br/>
&gt;&gt; I would too. However, I hope you think it would be much better if it didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; become illegal. You seem to send the message that it would be no big deal<br/>
&gt;&gt; either way. When you say &quot;anyway,&quot; you&#39;re saying you are willing to break<br/>
&gt;&gt; the law. I&#39;ll ride in the sheriff&#39;s car with you, gladly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, when I say &quot;If, suddenly homeschooling became illegal, I would do it<br/>
&gt; anyway.&quot; I mean if homeschooling were illegal, I would do it anyway. Not that<br/>
&gt; it would be no big deal, just that I believe in what I do and would do it<br/>
&gt; anyway, or inspite of, not I&#39;ll ride in the sheriff&#39;s car, gladly. Not<br/>
&gt; gladly, anyway. Don&#39;t put words in my mouth.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned&#39;s apology: <br/>
 Sloppy writing, I guess, and I&#39;ll take the blame. There was no intention to<br/>
put the words, &quot;I&#39;ll ride in the sheriff&#39;s car&quot;  in your mouth. I was saying<br/>
that there might come a time when the cops come to get you for breaking the<br/>
law, and I would be willing to ride with you as a fellow law-breaker, asking<br/>
for the same treatment as you would get.  I was also trying to say that if<br/>
homeschooling became illegal and you did it anyway, then we would be back in<br/>
the days ) not so long ago) when sheriffs actually came and took children<br/>
and parents away from their homes for homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I would also hope that I would be only one of many homeschoolers who would<br/>
be there demanding to be hauled off for their crimes, too.<br/>
