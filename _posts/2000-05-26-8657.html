figure out, (which I could have mentioned)&nbsp; if one doesn&#39;t use the

one isn&#39;t spreading it, at least, when I had the full-fledged version I didn&#39;t 
get told I was spreading it.&nbsp; I almost think I should get re-infected so I 
could debug myself properly.&nbsp; BTW, what did it do to your &#39;puter, apart

I know this sounds crazy, but you&#39;re one of the lucky ones. In order for me<br/>
to get rid of the kak virus I had to completly wipe out everything from my<br/>
computer and start all over. I lost everything: ( Talk about being a<br/>
computer junkie, when my poor brother (whose help I enlisted to help)<br/>
finally taped into my email I had 2200 unread messages....and that was only<br/>
from 10 days! Please let me know when your 12 step program starts, I&#39;ll be<br/>
there. &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

&gt; thanks Shannon Brophy for trying to help me but, like I said, I had no<br/>
idea<br/>
&gt; what you were trying to say and since I knew I was infected, I didn&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; to spread it to you, too  ... but, thanks so much ...<br/>
