<div id="ygrps-yiv-892111968">or, long-time unschoolers who remember what it was like before they <br/>
took the plunge.<br/>
<br/>
How did you cope with the anxiety that you might be setting the kids <br/>
up for a future in dire straits? <br/>
<br/>
The more I read: about education, about how people learned and earned <br/>
way back when (before gov&#39;t mandated schooling in the 1850&#39;s), about <br/>
what &quot;schooling&quot; really means today (ala John Taylor Gatto), and the <br/>
more I think: about my own education vs. my own &quot;schooling&quot;, and <br/>
about my best friend whose children I have described for you here, <br/>
whose true strengths, where they have excelled the most, have been <br/>
where she has let them choose their own path with little pushes from <br/>
her once they chose; and the more I observe: the most successful <br/>
people I know, both those who have made excellent earnings and those <br/>
who have succeeded in non-monetary ways, have been most successful <br/>
where they&#39;ve followed their passions. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to stifle this ability to find themselves, in my <br/>
children. I&#39;m really REALLY close to letting them do it their own <br/>
way, and even took my fingers off the &quot;off&quot; button on TV and computer <br/>
for the past two and a half weeks. But there is a definite fear still <br/>
hanging in there, that Robby will do nothing but computer. He was <br/>
online before breakfast this morning...and then he went for a long <br/>
bike ride with Katie. Now he&#39;s waiting for me to be done with the <br/>
puter so he can get back on...ack. <br/>
<br/>
Another question I have is related to advice I give parents who ask <br/>
me about it, when they want to homeschool their kids who have been to <br/>
school under the government system. I tell them, every time &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>
worry about academics in the first year. Just re-build the <br/>
relationship with the kids. Enjoy your time with them. They&#39;re not <br/>
going to slip academically if they have a year of decompression.&quot; <br/>
Well, we&#39;ve been homeschooling in a very laid back, relaxed way, for <br/>
seven years. Pretty much, math every day, reading of your choice, and <br/>
play time. <br/>
<br/>
Would we still go through a &quot;deschooling&quot; time, even though the <br/>
rhythm of our school days has always been subordinate to the <br/>
household routines? (except the first half of this year, when K12 <br/>
pushed us into an unnatural cycle that was nothing but frustrating) <br/>
Could less than one semester of this &quot;cycle&quot; bring about a situation <br/>
where the kids need to &quot;deschool&quot;? I&#39;m trying to see the light at the <br/>
end of the tunnel, when Robby WON&#39;T gravitate towards the computer.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there will be more questions. Main one: dealing with the <br/>
anxiety that I&#39;ll ruin my kids&#39; future.<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>

LAST nag. So if you get through three months of no nagging about math or <br/>
reading or computer time, and then you NAG,  Deschooling STARTS OVER. Because <br/>
they don&#39;t believe you.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m guessing you might need MORE time. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By &quot;one semester&quot; I meant, we did K12 for less than a full semester, <br/>
and was wondering if that would set us back, to where we needed to <br/>
deschool. My style has always been really relaxed, but I have had <br/>
Math as part of every day, and reading, and &quot;no computer until you <br/>
get that math done&quot; has been a standard statement around here...do <br/>
they need to &quot;deschool&quot; from even that low pressure style?<br/>

This was/is my problem too. With me, I think it is a control thing. I<br/>
feel like it is my responsibility to make sure my children grow up to be<br/>
successful, happy adults, and I lack the confidence in believing that I<br/>
am capable of this. Somebody here sent me a reassuring note off list that<br/>
said, in effect, that it is their lives. We can&#39;t control the outcome,<br/>
only to help them meet what they feel the outcome should be. This is hard<br/>
for me. But when I watch how my children live and learn, I find that they<br/>
are happiest when I&#39;m not leading their way. My husband&#39;s and my intent<br/>
before we ever had children was to homeschool them. We saw first hand how<br/>
mandated school stifled childrens&#39; learning. We did not want this for our<br/>
little blessings. With our first child, we were very *into* her learning,<br/>
constantly practicing A,B,Cs, counting, &quot;educating&quot;, and she did learn<br/>
all these things. Second child came along, and things were really busy.<br/>
We just didn&#39;t have the time to spend &quot;educating&quot; her. She picked up<br/>
things as she went, just observing life and people. By *natural* means,<br/>
she has learned all these things on her own accord, and quite joyfully.<br/>
This is when I became interested in this concept of unschooling. Could<br/>
this really work or is it just some unproven theory? It was so different<br/>
than anything I have ever experienced or seen. I put it to the test. When<br/>
first dd was about four and a half, I started working with her doing<br/>
phonics. She knew all the letters and the sounds they made, but couldn&#39;t<br/>
put them together. Then she plain out told me that she did not like<br/>
sounding out words because she thought it was a waste of time. Here, ever<br/>
since I started reading to her at 3 weeks (what can I say, I love to<br/>
read) she has been looking at the words as well as the pictures, and<br/>
somewhere along the line has memorized what I guess educators call *sight<br/>
words*. If I had continued to try to push her into learning to read in a<br/>
way that was not comfortable to her, not only would I have stifled her<br/>
natural ability to learn, but I would be wasting a lot of time as well.<br/>
It is things like this that constantly remind me that I can only get in<br/>
the way of them learning, if I don&#39;t let go of this control/fear thing<br/>
over them not learning without being taught. Sure, they may become happy,<br/>
successful adults in spite of my hang-ups, but I would rather make their<br/>
path easier. It will be tough enough. I think that the best thing I can<br/>
do for my children, is to be there when they need me, trust their<br/>
instincts, and catch them if they fall. I think the sooner I let go of<br/>
the belief that I have control, the easier it will be to accept the fact<br/>
that they are their own person, and their definition of happiness and<br/>
success as an adult may be totally different than mine.  Different, but<br/>
not wrong. I don&#39;t know if any of this makes any sense. I&#39;m just a<br/>
&quot;newbie&quot; trying to work this all out myself.<br/>

Excellent reply! thanks so much...<br/>
<br/>
you said: Second child came along, and things were really busy.<br/>

<br/>
This is one of the things I was talking about in my post: the things <br/>
I&#39;ve actually observed. Katie is 8, and has speech apraxia, which <br/>
caused quite a speech delay. Because she was &quot;behind&quot; in her <br/>
speaking, I never did any formal educating with her, except teaching <br/>
her to write her numbers and her letters, with sounds of the <br/>
consonants. She also knows how to write her name in cursive.L <br/>
<br/>
So, we&#39;re enrolling in K12, back in mid-September. There&#39;s a <br/>
placement test, and we went through the math test together. I found <br/>
out, Katie knew how to add, 1&#39;s, 2&#39;s, 5&#39;s, and 10&#39;s. Where the HECK <br/>
did she get it? I never taught it to her. She didn&#39;t know everything <br/>
perfectly, but she understood (understands) what is behind all those <br/>
numbers. This kinda blew me away, but my immediate thinking was &quot;wow. <br/>
Just imagine how far along she would be if I had taught her <br/>
formally.&quot; However, my thinking is becoming &quot;wonder how far she&#39;ll go <br/>
if I let her go for it without interfering.&quot; And I&#39;m closer to that <br/>
decision than ever before. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347470326">Hi Heidi.<br/>
<br/>
I just got home. Looks like you already got good feeback. Here <br/>
are a few of my thoughts.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>kids <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; up for a future in dire straits? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m still coping with it. All I can say is that I had to come to the <br/>
point where I really believed that the &quot;educational view&quot; of <br/>
learning was not superior to natural learning spawned by <br/>
interest and personal freedom.<br/>
<br/>
I know that my passion for learning is fueled by my drive to find <br/>
out about what interests me, not by some group of ideas <br/>
someone assembled somewhere that I ought to master. And I&#39;ve <br/>
watched as the things that I&#39;m interested in have led to things I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have cared about at all in an ordinary class setting.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive me if I&#39;ve used this example here before.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a big U2 fan and read articles about the band every single <br/>
day. Being a fan has meant growth in my undestanding of <br/>
pop/rock music, rock history, poetry and song lyrics (which I now <br/>
teach as a result), and other bands I would never have heard of. <br/>
But it has led other places outside music too: the current AIDs <br/>
crisis in Africa which has led to my daughter and I volunteering at <br/>
AIDs hospice in town, awareness of Sellafield (nuclear plant off <br/>
the coast of Ireland that is dangerously near to families... which <br/>
led to learning about the Chernobyl&#39;s Children&#39;s project and an <br/>
increased interest in protecting all of us from nuclear dangers.<br/>
<br/>
I was also greatly influenced by Bono&#39;s very different faith which <br/>
led to all my theological reading that has sent me in an entirely <br/>
new direction spiritually.<br/>
<br/>
and all this reading of the same story and material over and over <br/>
has made me keenly aware of good and bad writing which has <br/>
improved my own writing. Through my love for this band, I&#39;ve <br/>
already been hired to write about them twice!<br/>
<br/>
All from listening to a band. I can imagine another mother <br/>
thinking, &quot;All my son cares about is that band _________&quot; <br/>
thinking that the child isn&#39;t learning anything.<br/>
<br/>
So I got to thinking: what would happen if my kids had similar <br/>
opportunities to just go after what hooked their jaws?<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve been playing X box and computer games non-stop for <br/>
almost four weeks now. (Yes, I was worried about it). But it&#39;s <br/>
been great. I&#39;ve seen some surprising stuff result. One thing is, <br/>
they are sharing so much more easily now that their time isn&#39;t <br/>
limited. Secondly, they are playing games I didn&#39;t expect (I fully <br/>
thought they&#39;d be bombing and shooting only. But Basketball is a <br/>
favorite and they play the two player version). Thirdly, they are <br/>
also doing other stuff!!!<br/>
<br/>
I think when we say that computer is all they&#39;ll do, we are <br/>
shortchanging them as human beings. I may be on the <br/>
computer alot, but it&#39;s hardly ALL I DO. I think that is propaganda <br/>
from the other side that wants control.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m keeping a daily log of stuff the kids do, movies we watch, TV <br/>
shows, books read, outings, cool discoveries and so on. I&#39;m <br/>
amazed at how much great stuff we&#39;ve done in three and a half <br/>
weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a short list (and know that X box and computer games are <br/>
the most frequently played)<br/>
<br/>
*astronomy (learned about how the Chinese, Muslim and <br/>
Jewish calendars differ from ours and each other)<br/>
*Chinese culture<br/>
*Learned about red and grey squirrel habits<br/>
*signed up as volunteers for AIDs hospice<br/>
*felted wool and made a purse<br/>
*one kid started his cookie business<br/>
*musical instruments played with joy<br/>
*lots of IM chatting<br/>
*sports practice and games<br/>
*books read<br/>
*Yu-Gi-Oh cards<br/>
*board games<br/>
*chess<br/>
*Library trips<br/>
*movies of all kinds including Casablanca, The Great Escape <br/>
and Kung Pao.  (We are on a WWII binge which has been almost <br/>
daily for all three weeks)<br/>
*Reality TV shows. (This has been fascinating for them. The <br/>
cirque de Soliel one has led to all the imaginary play for my <br/>
littlest daughter)<br/>
*Table decorating<br/>
*costumes<br/>
*Joining the zoo<br/>
<br/>
On and on.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I want to say is that although I sometimes catch <br/>
myself feeling nervous, it&#39;s really based on losing the old <br/>
worldview more than on a lack of faith in the new one. I&#39;m still <br/>
figuring out how to let go of control while offering great ideas to <br/>
support their interests.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I both liked this switch from:<br/>
<br/>
authority and rules<br/>
<br/>
to:<br/>
<br/>
support and principles<br/>
<br/>
And right now I think it will take me until the end of 2003 before I <br/>
really get the hang of how to be the support they need and to <br/>
discover the way each one is best nurtured in his/her pursuits.<br/>
<br/>
This list is helping!<br/>
<br/>
Glad you are here too Heidi.<br/>

For how long did you think computers didn&#39;t have to do with math?  <br/>
Maybe first the mom has to deschool, and the general prediction is one month <br/>
per year of schooling.  In this case, maybe all the years you went to school <br/>
plus the years you believed school-style learing was the only real learning.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have had <br/>

<br/>
Math IS part of every day.<br/>
Reading is party of every day.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re made separate FROM part-of-every-day that needs some deschooling.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be from some text---or even done &quot;purposefully&quot;,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi ~Kelly<br/>
<br/>
math from texts: yes<br/>
<br/>
reading from texts? NEVER unless they want to read text books. <br/>
<br/>
Usually, we find something we&#39;re going to explore, and then hit the <br/>
library and get TONS of books on that topic, and have them around the <br/>
place. Including &quot;fact&quot; books, biographies, fiction, etc. I always <br/>
have believed that &quot;living books&quot; are going to lead to self-thinkers <br/>
much better than textbooks.  Maybe that&#39;s what you mean <br/>
by &quot;purposefully&quot; but I&#39;ve never forced them to read anything that we <br/>
get from the library. I just have plenty of material available around <br/>
the place, for them to pick up and read or not. Their choice. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a smidgen of a problem with letting my kids choose when, <br/>
where, what to read...but math...I have Math Anxiety by Proxy! LOL <br/>

&lt;&lt; But there is a definite fear still <br/>
hanging in there, that Robby will do nothing but computer. He was <br/>
online before breakfast this morning...and then he went for a long <br/>
bike ride with Katie. Now he&#39;s waiting for me to be done with the <br/>
puter so he can get back on...ack.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t seem at all like a problem to me, especially if it&#39;s been <br/>
limited up &#39;til lately.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m trying to see the light at the <br/>
end of the tunnel, when Robby WON&#39;T gravitate towards the computer.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t seem a good ideal-end-of-&#39;tunnel.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Why see yourself in a dark tunnel?<br/>
<br/>
Why should he avoid the computer?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m sure there will be more questions. Main one: dealing with the <br/>
anxiety that I&#39;ll ruin my kids&#39; future.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could practice getting over your computer anxiety.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; &quot;no computer until you<br/>
&gt; get that math done&quot; has been a standard statement around here...do<br/>
&gt; they need to &quot;deschool&quot; from even that low pressure style? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For how long did you think computers didn&#39;t have to do with math?<br/>
&gt; Maybe first the mom has to deschool, and the general prediction is one month<br/>
&gt; per year of schooling.  In this case, maybe all the years you went to school<br/>
&gt; plus the years you believed school-style learing was the only real learning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;I have had<br/>
&gt; Math as part of every day, and reading&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Math IS part of every day.<br/>
&gt; Reading is party of every day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If they&#39;re made separate FROM part-of-every-day that needs some deschooling.<br/>

&lt;&lt; As a newbie, i&#39;m wondering what is deschooloing? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Recovering from school to the point that the kids don&#39;t make their decisions <br/>
in avoidance of school-seeming things, and in the parents, to the point that <br/>
the parents can see the learning in things that USED to, or one time would <br/>
have looked like, playing or &quot;doing nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Both the kids and parents need time to decompress, and often the parents need <br/>
more time or at least more conscious thought to recover than the kids.<br/>
<br/>
The estimate I&#39;ve most often hear is give it a month for each year a child <br/>
was in school, but some people just say &quot;give it a year.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a column  I wrote last year for Home Education Magazine to help <br/>
parents with this transition:<br/>

&lt;&lt; his kinda blew me away, but my immediate thinking was &quot;wow. <br/>
Just imagine how far along she would be if I had taught her <br/>
formally.&quot; However, my thinking is becoming &quot;wonder how far she&#39;ll go <br/>
if I let her go for it without interfering.&quot; And I&#39;m closer to that <br/>
decision than ever before.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something by Tamyy Cardwell, a Christian homeschooler in Texas, that <br/>
reminds me of what you just wrote.  (or what you wrote reminded me of her <br/>
writing...)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the person who asked the question which inspired her to write this:<br/>
