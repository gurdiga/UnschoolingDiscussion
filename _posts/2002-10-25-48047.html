I never sent my son to school, but in the beginning, when I needed to see my<br/>
son &quot;DO somthing&quot;, I made mental lists.  Legos and cooking counted as math,<br/>
something on TV counted as science, reading signs counted as language arts,<br/>
playing a computer game involves reading and critical thinking, packing<br/>
boxes is geometry (we&#39;re moving again) and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually your brain gets full of garbage like that and you realize that<br/>
it&#39;s ALL educational, really.  So you ditch the counting and just live.  At<br/>
least that&#39;s what happened for me.<br/>
