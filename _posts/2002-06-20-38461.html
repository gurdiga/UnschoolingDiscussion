&gt;I go one step farther.  Everyone does their own laundry (from about age 7 <br/>
&gt;or whenever I found clean clothes in the laundry basket again after a <br/>
&gt;warning).  If Lars doesn&#39;t have clean clothes, it&#39;s because he didn&#39;t wash <br/>
&gt;any.  Not my problem.  I might remind him that he&#39;ll need a clean ball <br/>
&gt;uniform tomorrow or something, but if it doesn&#39;t get done, it&#39;s his <br/>
&gt;problem.  I do the household laundry and my own.  I haven&#39;t had any <br/>
&gt;complaints.  Almost any 7 year old can easily learn to operate a washing <br/>
&gt;machine and dryer or clothesline.<br/>

found, to my dismay, that this policy now means the washer is going <br/>
non-stop, and I can hardly get a load in edgewise!  :)<br/>

&lt;&lt; And how do you clean out the runners in a shower, Sandra? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
With a stick--a skewer or a disposable chopstick or something, and do it wet, <br/>
and put rags outside so the gunk has a place to go.   You can also fold a rag <br/>
and slide the fold down in and run it back and forth and up the end.  I <br/>
learned that from cleaning the neck of a guitar with a cloth.  And from <br/>
cleaning (yucko, dirt-collecting) painted wrought iron with a rag, by running <br/>
it in and pulling it back and forth (like flossing wrought iron &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I use rags and wash them.  Lots of rags.  For floors and sinks and showers <br/>
and all.   If I didn&#39;t have a washer and a dryer, I would probably use paper <br/>
towels more, but I just wait til I have a washer load of rags.  I sew, so I <br/>
get more rags.  Towels wear out, so ditto.  <br/>
<br/>
In New Mexico, things will definitely dry without any special attention.  <br/>
<br/>
But mostly, I stall.  I hate to clean.  And I wish I had a steam carpet <br/>
cleaner like the ones they rent, but they cost $800 so I don&#39;t have one.<br/>

looks like  a vacuum cleaner, that style, but it&#39;s a steam cleaner.<br/>
Worked great, I was always amazed at how much dirt was in the crpets.<br/>
<br/>
Now we have no carpets, but I&#39;m keeping it anyway. It also does<br/>
unholstered furniture and the car interior, things I&#39;m rarely motivated<br/>
enough to do... but I did the carpets, because it made my<br/>
allergies/asthma so much better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710701670">Wondering what you told you kids when you began homeschooling, if it was<br/>
after homeschooling/public school.<br/>
<br/>
We are turning to homeschooling after homeschooling under a public school<br/>
alternative education allotment program.  They basically homeschooled, but<br/>
took classes at the school, 5 hours per week minimum, where I attended with<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, they know it is summer now, but they will also be aware of when<br/>
school begins again because all their friends will be at school.<br/>
<br/>
They are 9, 7, and 5.  I really can&#39;t imagine me sitting them down and<br/>
saying, guess what, we are going to unschool now.  Then, explain the whole<br/>
thing to them.<br/>
<br/>
We have discussed homeschooling/public school to a great extent, and they<br/>
get it.<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering what approach you all took.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of just not saying anything, until they asked, and would say<br/>
that we will do what they find interesting.<br/>
<br/>
They already know that we will not return to the allotment program because<br/>
it was too much running around, and they are SO happy about that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rain went to kindergarten. She actually went to two different<br/>
kindergarten programs, one was a fledgling Reggio Emilia - Whole Language<br/>
- Anti-Bias curriculum charter school on the Oakland-Berkeley border,<br/>
which was a nice idea but it never quite meshed and by December it was<br/>
clearly not working and I was also worried for her safety... so we toured<br/>
a bunch of different private schools and she ended up at a tiny <br/>
Montessori school on the island where we lived, which was better, but<br/>
only marginally. By the end of the school year, I&#39;d decided to quit my<br/>
job teaching children with emotional/behavioral disorders (the kids were<br/>
great but the system was awful) and we were going to homeschool if we<br/>
ended up on welfare and on the streets... my income was our only income,<br/>
and as a single mom I hadn&#39;t yet figured out how to make money and<br/>
homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
We were both in on this decision, we talked about it, clearly she wasn&#39;t<br/>
happy. We&#39;d gone to a homeschool group back in Arizona, and some of the<br/>
friends we&#39;d had for years were homeschooling - and all the homeschoolers<br/>
we knew well were unschoolers, so when she said she wanted to homeschool<br/>
like Leesie and Aliyah and Annie and Joe, she meant unschooling... I<br/>
don&#39;t think she even knew then that some people did school-at-home.<br/>
<br/>
So, anyway, it sounds like you all agreed not to continue the public<br/>
program. I&#39;m not sure what you were doing at home, but if you&#39;re planning<br/>
changes, I would definitely talk to them, instead of leaving them<br/>
wondering where things stand. Maybe something like, &quot;Remember how last<br/>
year I was giving you math pages to do every day, and spelling tests, and<br/>
all that?  I&#39;ve been thinking and learning more about how people learn,<br/>
and one thing I&#39;ve realized is that you will learn what you need to learn<br/>
without being forced to do worksheets and things. Your learning may not<br/>
look like school-learning, but just by living in this world and doing<br/>
what interests you, you&#39;ll learn everything you need to know to be you.<br/>
So, I&#39;m not going to make you do that kind of stuff anymore. I&#39;ll still<br/>
be here if you want to work on something together, or if you need help<br/>
with something, but it&#39;s going to be up to you now, not me. How does that<br/>
sound?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You might also want to talk some about other kids who unschool, about<br/>
what they&#39;re doing and what they&#39;ve learned, and how, so they can kind of<br/>
see how it all works. I would think that at least the older kids might<br/>
worry that without schoolwork they&#39;ll be &quot;dumb&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also love to hear Karin&#39;s answer to this...<br/>

You could just tell them you don&#39;t want to &quot;do school&quot; anymore (not in fall, <br/>
but starting now), and that you think they can learn all kinds of things <br/>
without being taught.   Tell them lots of families do that, and you want to <br/>
try it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-880190945">Hi Debbie -<br/>
<br/>
We homeschooled for 5 years before starting unschooling last Sept.<br/>
We were at such a frustrating point in time with homeschooling.<br/>
I was constantly nagging them to do their assigned schoolwork (that I had<br/>
scheduled for them) and they always had a million excuses why they didn&#39;t<br/>
want to do their math or grammar or anything school related.<br/>
So, after I found out about unschooling and spent a day or two reading about<br/>
it (at unschooling.com) I told the kids that I wasn&#39;t going to force them to<br/>
do schoolwork anymore. That we could just learn about or do anything that<br/>
they wanted to do and that we were unschooling from now on.<br/>
I didn&#39;t explain much more to them about unschooling but they immediately<br/>
made the connection that it meant no more schoolish bookwork.<br/>
I think at first they might have thought that I was giving up on them,<br/>
somehow, and unschooling was like yet another punishment (some sort of mom<br/>
twisted mind game) for not doing their schoolwork when I asked them to. But<br/>
I told them that I have changed my mind about forcing them to do schoolwork<br/>
everyday and that I didn&#39;t think that was a good way for them to learn about<br/>
things and it was just causing a lot of stress in our household - so that&#39;s<br/>
why I wanted to unschool.<br/>
We&#39;ve all adjusted just fine since then and love our FREE unschooling lives,<br/>
now!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-27145014">Thank you Sandra, Karin and Dar,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since I (WE I mean) have always talked to them about everything, and let<br/>
them help make our many family decisions, I will just be frank with them as<br/>
you all mentioned.  Today we are going house hunting, and they will all be a<br/>
part of picking the right house to buy.  They are so excited, and have asked<br/>
about how we get the money, which brought out a discussion of interest and<br/>
borrowing from banks.  How cool.  Sky is even using the word perimiter to<br/>
describe property.  Cool!<br/>
<br/>
They have expressed great desire NOT to go to public school, and NOT to go<br/>
back to the alternative learning plan.  They love the curriculum we were<br/>
using, which was Oak Meadow.  Mostly I just read to them, and they drew<br/>
pictures and wrote scentences.  We did rhythmic clapping/marching for math<br/>
and sung songs.  It is fun, and we can do the curriculum at their asking<br/>
only from now on.<br/>
<br/>
So nice to have this group of unschoolers.  I do not know of any unschoolers<br/>
in our area.  I suppose I could put an add in the newspaper however.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
