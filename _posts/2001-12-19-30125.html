<div id="ygrps-yiv-955738007">Hello fellow unschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
Just in case any of you are not aware, iwon.com gives away 10k a day, 1 <br/>
mil a month and monthly bonus prizes when you use their web page as a <br/>
portal to the web.<br/>
<br/>
Its worth it to make www.iwon.com your homepage when signing on. I get my <br/>
news from there and use their search engine when I need to add points.<br/>
<br/>
Normally, I&#39;ve been using Google from the beginning of them because I <br/>
think its the best thing since sliced bread *smile*. But for the year <br/>
iwon is doing this promo, I use them. March 2001 - 2002<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, you can open up your own iwonstore and get a percentage of <br/>
all the purchases.<br/>
<br/>
I opened a superstore and hopefully all my online ordering friends and <br/>
relatives will shop there. Stop by to take a look at what you can do for <br/>
yourselves while trying to make ends meet. This is NOT an ad to ask you <br/>
to make a purchse.. I want you to make your own store!<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ourchildrensfuture.iwonstores.com">http://ourchildrensfuture.iwonstores.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I want to take any money this store makes and put it towards opening a <br/>
democratic school (which is in the works anyway).<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing I gain from this announcement, except the inate pleasure <br/>
I would get if a fellow unschooler won something!<br/>
<br/>
So good luck to all.. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s the two issues I bring up:<br/>
<br/>
1. Go to www.iwon.com and register yourself for the winnings. Visit there <br/>
everyday and lets get an unschooler the booty instead of just anyone!!! <br/>
*smile*<br/>
<br/>
2.Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.iwon.com/home/shopping/store_builder/">http://www.iwon.com/home/shopping/store_builder/</a> and build your <br/>
own store in seconds. Its foolproof!<br/>
<br/>
_______<br/>
<br/>
The school my group is putting together is benefactor of the store I put <br/>
up. I don&#39;t want people here to buy from it. I&#39;ll market it my own way. <br/>
(Unless you REALLY want to!)<br/>
<br/>
I want people here to open their own store and benefit from it.<br/>
Even  your own purchases.<br/>
<br/>
www.iwon.com offers this EASY step method of putting one together. They <br/>
host it, they deal with ALL the transactions, including the returns. YOU <br/>
get a percentage of the sales. YOU get your friends and family to buy <br/>
from it.<br/>
<br/>
Also using iwon.com enters you into a sweepstakes that they are currently <br/>
giving away 10k a day. (Make sure you use an email address that isn&#39;t <br/>
your favourite, as you will get spammed from them when you enter).<br/>
_______<br/>
<br/>
I do a lot of graphic design from my house to make money. Not everyone <br/>
has the clientelle or the time (more than 1 kid) to work from home. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping this will help some of us that need to keep bringing income <br/>
into the house without giving up unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, winning the 10k would be great!!!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck everyone,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-252057189">We use e-bates for buying stuff from amazon and every 3 months you get a<br/>
check from them.  I think amazon is 2 or 3% but when you are buying through<br/>
several of the stores that they connect with then you can get a nice little<br/>
check.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, let me know and I&#39;ll send you their link off list.<br/>
