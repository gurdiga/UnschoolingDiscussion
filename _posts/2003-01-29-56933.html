By Laura Smith, Evening Standard<br/>
28 January 2003<br/>
<br/>
Dobby, the computer-animated elf in the new Harry Potter film, could be <br/>
at the centre of a court battle over his resemblance to Russian <br/>
president Vladimir Putin.<br/>
<br/>
A Russian law firm is reportedly drawing up legal action against the <br/>
special effects people who dreamt up Dobby, arguing that the ugly but <br/>
caring elf has been modelled on Mr Putin.<br/>
<br/>
The Kremlin and Warner Bros, producer of Harry Potter And The Chamber Of <br/>
Secrets, have declined to comment but the controversy has stirred <br/>
emotions in Russia.<br/>
<br/>
Lookalikes? Vladimir Putin and Dobby<br/>
<br/>
Potter websites and chatrooms have been inundated with angry Russian <br/>
messages attacking anyone suggesting a likeness between the elf and Mr <br/>
Putin.<br/>
<br/>
The saga has gripped the Russian media, too. Radio station Ekho Moskvy <br/>
has reported on the row and Russian TV is to broadcast results of a BBC <br/>
poll in which more than 7,000 people say Dobby does look like Mr Putin.<br/>
<br/>
It is the second Russian controversy surrounding Harry Potter. Last <br/>
year, the Russian Orthodox Church called for the books about the boy <br/>
wizard to be banned for promoting occultism.<br/>
<br/>
It is not the first time Russians have lashed out over &quot;misuse&quot; of an <br/>
image of their president. In 1995, the prosecutor-general investigated <br/>
alleged insults against Boris Yeltsin in a satirical puppet show. The <br/>
case was later dropped.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-617855434">Some people are just too sensitive.  So WHAT if the elf looks like a <br/>
president? Is the president that sensitive? lol<br/>
