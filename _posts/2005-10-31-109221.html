We live in Texas and there are no state laws here either.  We don&#39;t have to<br/>

thought you might like to know that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-537721560">Okay - this list is really not appropriately used for talking about  <br/>
homeschool legal issues. But it DOES come up over and over. So I&#39;m  <br/>
going to make a list of the states that are recommended as most  <br/>
unschooling-friendly and it&#39;ll be in the files area. If anybody wants  <br/>
MORE information about a particular state, they can go to the brief  <br/>
summaries at the NHEN (National Home Education Network) website<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org/leginfo/state_list.asp">http://www.nhen.org/leginfo/state_list.asp</a>&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
This is a list of the states that seem to be easy - no testing, no  <br/>
providing portfolios, no meetings with school representatives. Most  <br/>
require just a simple notification and then leave homeschoolers  <br/>
completely alone.  A few require you to join a private school or  <br/>
group - but I still listed those states if I&#39;m aware that there are  <br/>
options that are unschooling-friendly (Florida, for example).<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t think a state belongs on this list because it is NOT  <br/>
unschooling-friendly or if you think I should include a state that  <br/>
I&#39;ve left off, please write to me at: &lt;pamsoroosh @ earthlink.net&gt;,  <br/>
but do NOT respond on this list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-399462090"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;I would be interested in how different ones deal with different state laws. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here in South Dakota, the laws basically boil down to *showing progress* <br/>
as determined by the math and reading portions of standardized tests at <br/>
the 2nd, 4th, 8th and 11th grade levels.  I registered my kids as 7 year <br/>
old first graders (there is legal conflict between the compulsory <br/>
attendance age of 5 and kindergarten as an optional grade) so the 11th <br/>
grade test will be optional, as they&#39;ll be more than 16 (end of <br/>
compulsory attendance) when considered 11th graders.  My current plan is <br/>
to register them only on testing years, so the school district knows to <br/>
order a test for them. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is easy, as I keep a calendar of our activities should <br/>
anyone ask about our 176 days of attendance; Hannah just took the 2nd <br/>
grade test last spring, as a baseline, so *showing improvement* is not <br/>
yet a concern for us.  We are able to test in our own homes on our own <br/>
time (within the 6 week window set by the school district -- moot if one <br/>
purchases their own tests).  Hannah actually thought it was fun, though <br/>
she was glad to only take two parts of the 12 part test.  I&#39;ve no fear <br/>
of them looking me up, frankly they don&#39;t have the money to put into <br/>
policing the homeschoolers &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There has been lately one guy in our state senate who wants to make life <br/>
miserable for homeschoolers in our state, some personal vendetta (I <br/>
think it&#39;s either guilt for not homeschooling his own kids or some <br/>
horrific deed done to him as a child by a homeschooler), but so far, <br/>
he&#39;s been shut down.  We have a large number of homeschoolers in our <br/>
state, most for religious reasons and school-at-home folks, but we <br/>
unschoolers reap the benefits of their willingness to be very vocal and <br/>
visible. <br/>
<br/>
Laws are like rules, if it doesn&#39;t say *this* specifically, then <br/>
whatever else I&#39;m doing must be okay &lt;vbg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-52407671">Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to get everyone on a subject that was <br/>
inappropriate for the list, it seems that the laws effect unschoolers <br/>
in a different way and I have never had to deal with it before.  <br/>
Thanks for the list Pam, that will help.<br/>
