I think we should discuss issues without being personal, and those who can&#39;t <br/>
discuss issues don&#39;t have to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually.....remembering my own bickering with my sister, watching my own <br/>
and other kids bicker, and watching the bickering that goes on periodically <br/>
here, I&#39;d say that there *is* no tormenter and tormented.  Or at least <br/>
those roles reverse constantly.  I know I *thought* when I was younger that <br/>
it was all my sister&#39;s fault, but I now realize I did just as much <br/>
provoking as she did.<br/>
