You&#39;d probably like Clinton&#39;s autobiography then. Reviewers who <br/>
misunderstood or disliked his approach were criticizing him for spending <br/>
so much time on his formative years and then cramming 5 different major <br/>
events that occurred while he was president onto one page. He supposedly <br/>
did that on purpose so that readers would get a sense of how much <br/>
pressure there is and how quickly things move when you are president.<br/>

Two in recent years I really liked were Kenneth Branagh&#39;s (read it all) and <br/>
the Dalai Lama&#39;s (read half).   Another thing I did with biographical need <br/>
before the internet had all KINDS of bio stuff was to read juvenile bios.  Not <br/>
only do they concentrate on childhood stuff, but they have photos.  There&#39;s a bio <br/>
of Tolkien with lots of photos.  Of course after the movies were made and <br/>
DVDs are out, Tolkien bio stuff litters the ground.   But the adult-aimed book I <br/>
read (part of) was dense text, blah blah blah, while the one aimed at kids was <br/>
sweeter and left better images.<br/>
<br/>
Harry Belafonte&#39;s account of being a kid was shortish but very different from <br/>
anything I&#39;d ever read, heard or imagined of anyone&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
Now I tend to read several websites and have done.<br/>
