<div id="ygrps-yiv-632537745">Hi all, Jacli (Cleopatra) here :)<br/>
<br/>
Just a quick note.  As much as I enjoy and learn from every<br/>
digest on this list I<br/>
still felt a need to add this note.  I am a dark skinned<br/>
Costa Rican with 7 sisters and brothers and my hubby one of<br/>
three and is from Northern Italian.  Every time I read a<br/>
post about Irish or Italian families <br/>
yelling or Spanish/Mexican families having bad tempers I<br/>
cringe.  It reminds me of<br/>
nasty comments made by teachers when I was little about<br/>
Mexicans being lazy<br/>
or assumptions by highschool boys about Spanish girls.  <br/>
<br/>
I do not believe that any person on this list wrote with<br/>
malicious intent but I do <br/>
believe that these kinds of generalizations hurt and<br/>
cripple.  My parents were both <br/>
abusers.  Physically, emotionally.  Growing up in my house<br/>
was akin to growing up in <br/>
a battlefield.  My father was vicious and my mother<br/>
mentally unstable.  I never knew <br/>
what would set her off, every day, every night was a trip<br/>
through the minefields.<br/>
<br/>
I remember once an aunt of mine happened by just after my<br/>
father had punched my 4 year <br/>
old brother&#39;s head into a wall (he had spilt milk on the<br/>
table).  She sent my uncle into the room to take care of<br/>
him while she tended to my black eye and split lip.  I<br/>
remember her breath on my face <br/>
while she told me it was not his fault, since their father<br/>
beat all of them.  I also remember <br/>
thinking, no it is his fault.<br/>
<br/>
My father and mother were abusers.  Not because of past<br/>
connections or treatment or<br/>
even because of being Costa Rican.  They were abusers<br/>
period.  My father was a silent striker.<br/>
He didn&#39;t yell.  He didn&#39;t raise his voice.  Just his fist.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My husband has a gentle nature and a soft spoken way.  His<br/>
family live in America now and are as different from mine<br/>
as night and day.  They are extraordinarrily quiet and<br/>
jovial and gentle people.  <br/>
<br/>
I think we need always to remember that people are who they<br/>
are because of the choices they make and the environment<br/>
they make them in.  I am a very quiet individual, so are<br/>
most of my brothers and sisters.  Except for the ones who<br/>
are loud.  Because that&#39;s just the way they are.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t usually share this much personal info (ever<br/>
actually) nor do I usually write long posts.<br/>
But I had to write and let folks know that at least one<br/>
person has been offended by the use of<br/>
these generalizations.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for listening</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-350905724">I&#39;m sorry that you were offended, but I&#39;m not sure you understand what <br/>
Lynda was saying.  She was not talking about abusive people.  You get <br/>
that everywhere in every group.  She was talking about the cultural <br/>
dfifferences that often cause people to misunderstand the intent of <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in a hot-headed Irish family.  They could argue circles <br/>
around most other people I know.  But no matter how much they <br/>
disagreed, they were still family, still loved one another and <br/>
harbored no grudges.  There was no abuse, physical or verbal going on. <br/>
 But to an outsider it sure could look like they all hated each other.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in my late 20&#39;s I met a man who also had a similar <br/>
background.  We did not agree on anything politically, but we loved to <br/>
talk to each other and discuss stuff - because we both understood <br/>
that it was no reflection on how we felt about each otehr.  One <br/>
night, we sat in a Sokol Club bar for about four hours talking about <br/>
every political and social thing you can think of.  When we got up to <br/>
leave, an older woman sitting at the bar said, &quot;That was some <br/>
arguement!&quot; and we replied in unison, &quot;That was no argument, that was <br/>
a discussion!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope this helps you to understand where we are coming from <br/>
when we say some cultures are louder than others.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pretty hard to do, don&#39;t you think? Our personal experiences make up a big <br/>
part of who we are, especially one&#39;s ethnicity. For me, it&#39;s always been a <br/>
rule of thumb to not make any generalizations based on race or ethnicity. I <br/>
tend to stay away from religion even. There are other ways to make a point, <br/>
no?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-549756310">My husband&#39;s family is Presbyterian, and both sides are of (long ago) <br/>
Scottish and English background.  One side came from Canada and Michigan <br/>
(that border area), and the other: Boston.<br/>
<br/>
They are quiet, uptight, non-communicative and cheap.  <br/>
<br/>
Is it because they&#39;re Scottish?  Presbyterian?  Which comes first, the <br/>
chicken or the egg?<br/>
<br/>
My husband used to think I was angry every time I disagreed or raised my <br/>
voice.  I thought he was being mean when he didn&#39;t respond.  We got over it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The world is full of genetic and cultural realities.  Unfortunately we are <br/>
trying to live in such a politically correct world that, like the Emperor&#39;s <br/>
New Clothes, it&#39;s considered courteous to say &quot;OOOH!  We&#39;re all the same.  <br/>
How awful that some people see differences.  They are wrong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoy passing through an airport when I&#39;m not in a hurry and trying <br/>
to guess from the people sitting at a gate where they&#39;re from or who they&#39;re <br/>
meeting.  Or to just look at people getting out of a plane, without looking <br/>
at the sign at the desk identifying where they&#39;ve come from.   There are <br/>
clues in carriage, clothing, hair, make-up, even before you get to accent.<br/>
<br/>
Once in northern California I spotted the to-New Mexico gate EASILY (which is <br/>
too easy, because I&#39;m from there).  The sad thing is I wasn&#39;t on my way to <br/>
New Mexico! LOL!  But there were turban-wearing American Sikhs (the 3HO <br/>
organization), and older Hispanic guys with Pendleton shirts, jeans and <br/>
boots, and the rest weren&#39;t as distinctive, but still looked very much like <br/>
normal New Mexicans.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve picked out Midwesterners because there are some faces and body-builds <br/>
that are SO Nebraska/Kansas/Missouri, and they wear two shirts a lot, the <br/>
guys.  Flannel over something, or a patterned shirt over something.<br/>
<br/>
California&#39;s easy sometimes; Texas REALLY easy (and sometimes embarrassing, <br/>
like when two 747&#39;s unloaded early in London years ago, one from Atlanta and <br/>
one from Dallas.  Both planes were late, but the Atlanta flight folks were <br/>
quiet and polite, compared to the loud Texans who were talking right over and <br/>
through the locals like they were props.  I was with the Texans, trying to be <br/>
invisible.<br/>
<br/>
These are generalizations, but also observations of real life.  Stereotypes <br/>
aren&#39;t made up from nothing.  That&#39;s the embarrassing kernel of truth we have <br/>
to try to guard against.  There IS a reality there.  NOW what do we do?  I <br/>
think saying we see the emperor&#39;s new clothes when we really don&#39;t is not the <br/>
best choice.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is just what we were doing the other night at Sea-Tac - trying <br/>
to find our oldest son, John. Anchorage had had the worst snowfall <br/>
since 1957 the night his plane was to take off - along with <br/>
lower-than-normal temperatures. The wings were re-icing faster than <br/>
the crews could get them de-iced, so after sitting on the runway for <br/>
four hours they cancelled the flight. The next day was confusing, <br/>
because we kept getting mixes messages from the airlines, his wife <br/>
(100 miles north of the airport), our other sons in Alaska (also 100 <br/>
miles from where John was), and various other sources. Finally we <br/>
pinned down via the airline that he&#39;d gotten on a particular plane, <br/>
but reports were mixed whether the plane had actually left Anchorage <br/>
or not. So we trucked back down to the airport and sat there in the <br/>
main terminal, which was as close as security would let us get, <br/>
watching planeloads of people coming through and trying to figure out <br/>
if any of them looked like Alaskans.<br/>
<br/>
Saw a group of lobsters in bermuda shorts get off a flight from <br/>
Florida. Bright serapes and big sombreros tipped us to a flight from <br/>
Mexico. Leis and big floral prints = Hawaii. One flight was primarily <br/>
suits with briefcases - didn&#39;t look Alaskan at all. Another flight <br/>
included several families in colorful ethnic dresses - silks, mostly, <br/>
probably some Asian country. And then we started seeing what we&#39;d <br/>
been watching for. Haggard, steely-eyed, unshaven, snowboots, parkas <br/>
- it was Alaskans, sure enough. And toward the end of the group came <br/>
John, wearing his fur-trimmed parka, oversize bunny boots, needed a <br/>
shave, really needed some sleep, but still smiling. Waved so long to <br/>
a couple of friends he&#39;d made in the ordeal and gave us all big hugs.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, airports are interesting. Even more interesting these days <br/>
watching people trying to get through the security gates. One big <br/>
burly fellow raised a terrible ruckus when they told him he&#39;d been <br/>
selected for a random search - he started yelling that he&#39;d already <br/>
been through three &quot;random&quot; searches on that trip and as far as he <br/>
was concerned there was nothing &quot;random&quot; about it, that something <br/>
about him was raising their red flags, so why didn&#39;t they just quit <br/>
playing games and tell him what it was about him that they didn&#39;t <br/>
like? Pretty entertaining.<br/>

locally that makes organic cheese and we have to make regular trips there<br/>
because they do free samples (for the kidlets) and extra sharp cheddar (that<br/>
would be for hubby).  There is also a goat dairy that does absolutely to die<br/>
for Feta cheese!  We haven&#39;t found a recipe for that yet but they have<br/>
collected several other recipes that they want to try when the weather warms<br/>
up a bit more.  Seems you have to have a pretty constant temp or something.<br/>
Couldn&#39;t prove it by me but they&#39;ve been reading up on it and that&#39;s what<br/>
they are waiting for.<br/>
