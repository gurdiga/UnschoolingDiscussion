<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143544509">My dad was like that too---and still IS. The best word to describe him is <br/>
&quot;generous&quot;. Generous with his money, with his knowledge, and with his time. <br/>
He was/is always thinking AHEAD. I sometimes hate asking him for anything <br/>
because I know he&#39;ll give it even if he can&#39;t--or shouldn&#39;t. He WILL. Always.<br/>
<br/>
He pulled me aside one day when I was almost 14. I was horse-crazy and knew <br/>
we couldn&#39;t afford a horse (who can?). He said it was time to buy me a horse <br/>
because I would &quot;find&quot; boys soon and he wanted me to enjoy the horses while I <br/>
could (little did he know! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
One day Duncan was asking about a toy or something. I said that I just didn&#39;t <br/>
have that kind of money right now. Maybe when I get paid again. He said, <br/>
&quot;I&#39;ll ask Pa. He always has the RIGHT kind of money!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I HATE to say &quot;no&quot; too. &quot;Later&quot;. &quot;Maybe for Christmas or your birthday.&quot; <br/>
&quot;Next payday.&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll see what I can do.&quot;  And the favorite, &quot;SURE!&quot;  All are <br/>
acceptable to the boys, and they know I&#39;d do it if I could. (Or they can ask <br/>
Opa! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You know what?  I have often counseled other mothers who are overwhelmed <br/>
&gt; and feeling trapped in no-ville that they should find a way to say yes <br/>
&gt; to whatever their kids want at any given moment.  Many times it just <br/>
&gt; lifts the spirits of everyone and the kid feels loved after a short time <br/>
&gt; of yeses and won&#39;t harangue and harrass mom so much.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I learned this from my dad.  He&#39;s such a *great* dad.  I remember my mom <br/>
&gt; was always the &quot;no&quot; person.  But one time he stuck up for me, and <br/>
&gt; insisted I be allowed to go on a high school spring break ski trip.  I <br/>
&gt; will always love him for that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When my oldest children were little, Dad would take them for a couple of <br/>
&gt; weeks at a time.  (I was single then, and he was giving me a break.)  He <br/>
&gt; always reported that they behaved perfectly and were happy and had a <br/>
&gt; good time.  They always came back completely centered and content.  He <br/>
&gt; said that was because he resolved when my eldest was born to never say <br/>
&gt; &quot;no&quot; to his grandchildren, even if he knew what they were asking he <br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t possibly provide.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Think about how hard that would be?  Never say no?  Sometimes he had to <br/>
&gt; be creative; he would say &quot;later&quot; or engage them in conversation about <br/>
&gt; it until they came to the conclusion that they didn&#39;t need/want it.  But <br/>
&gt; because he&#39;d never said no to even their tiniest request, they&#39;ve never <br/>
&gt; asked for anything impossible.  This is some of the best advice found in <br/>
&gt; &quot;How to Talk so Kids Will Listen...&quot;, too.  And he&#39;s probably never even <br/>
&gt; heard of that book.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My kids never ask him for anything anymore, because they know he&#39;d give <br/>
&gt; it to them, and they&#39;re grown up enough and love him enough to not want <br/>
&gt; to burden him.  He has a very nice Jeep and a ski boat and numerous <br/>
&gt; other toys, that they know they can use anytime.  But they don&#39;t.  I <br/>
&gt; think just knowing they can is enough.  And they express true gratitude <br/>
&gt; to him, which is nice to see.  They think the world of each other.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s hard, hard, hard when you&#39;re the parent and not the grandparent, to <br/>
&gt; have a relationship with your kids like that.  But every little bit helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-999237714">I think I have a bit of a problem with always saying yes, even if one can <br/>
afford to always do so. I mean I&#39;m a big advocate about learning how to not <br/>
automatically say no to things without thinking. I also believe you have to <br/>
chose battles and no&#39;s wisely. Sometimes it&#39;s just not worth the no or the <br/>
fight. But always saying yes or later doesn&#39;t set well with me. Not unless <br/>
later always means just that, later for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I think in my house, it is important that our children learn no and learn <br/>
how to handle the no&#39;s. And learn that yes&#39;s don&#39;t always come and that <br/>
later does mean later and promises do mean you will do it. That maybe <br/>
Christmas or birthdays mean just that too and not hope the child forgets by <br/>
then. Even the little ones will eventually get that later means no when it <br/>
doesn&#39;t always happen.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s just me.<br/>

or manipulative.<br/>
<br/>
But to be in relationship with them, and want for them what they want, <br/>
and help them find a way to the yes if it can happen, and help them <br/>
realize the why nots without ever putting your foot down with no, and <br/>
let them know that you are on their side.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be a gatekeeper on the door of their desires.  <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t lie to my kids. Later means later. I&#39;ll try means I will really try. <br/>
If I can&#39;t succeed, I&#39;ll explain the circumstances to them. I explain a lot <br/>
when we&#39;re making purchases. Spending money one place means we won&#39;t have it <br/>
to spend in another. My kids have a pretty good grasp of that. They&#39;re also <br/>
good at saving up their own money and working to get a big ticket item. <br/>

that I don&#39;t say no just to teach them how to deal with it. They know I&#39;m <br/>
the one that&#39;s there to help them figure out to get to their own yes.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
