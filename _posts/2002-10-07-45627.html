Some of both, in my experience.<br/>
<br/>
Once you decide the curriculum isn&#39;t what creates learning, and then learn <br/>
that the fieldtrips aren&#39;t what creates learning and the group activities are <br/>
kind of a pain, the pins just all fall down.<br/>
<br/>
We had an unschooling group here for a long time, but it was a playgroup, so <br/>
the kids could have regular ongoing friendships. It created some good <br/>
longterm friendships for parents too.  One of the kids my kids met when they <br/>
were 8, 6 and 3 or so is upstairs playing Magic or something with   Marty.  <br/>
That&#39;t longterm stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-311911368">Hi Laura,<br/>
I live in Acworth. There is another member of this list who lives in Smyrna. We both belong to Life long learners of GA. We both are open in our unschooling approach. I sometimes find the discussions of curriculum and the idea that mom feels uncomfortable bringing kids to the park that day because they hadn&#39;t finished their math a bit silly and mind-numbing....but most of the women in this group are loving, gentle, and in general people I can easily get along with, if not form life-long friendships with. <br/>
<br/>
I feel this group is good for me to be around others that homeschool, even if most of them school at home. It also gives Shawn (4 yrs) the opportunity to be around children NOT his age.<br/>

I can&#39;t speak for &quot;most&quot; unschoolers, but I&#39;ve only met two other families <br/>
in our area (within 1-2 hr. drive. We&#39;re very rural&lt;g&gt;) that are <br/>
unschoolers. We don&#39;t shun support groups in general, but don&#39;t have any <br/>
that are homeschool specific either. We live in MO, so I definitely can&#39;t <br/>
speak for Georgian home/unschoolers :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907299825">I&#39;m finding that my kids are craving a lot of just free play with <br/>
other kids.  They especially like those big wooden playgrounds where <br/>
they can develop all kinds of fantasy play with other kids.  They <br/>
also like to play in people&#39;s houses when there&#39;s a space they can <br/>
have all to themselves, like at our house there&#39;s a big outdoor patio <br/>
and my friend&#39;s house has a big attic room that they can make <br/>
into &quot;club houses&quot;.  They can do that for hours and hours and would <br/>
love to do it several days a week.  <br/>
<br/>
There aren&#39;t too many kids in our neighborhood. There is a girl <br/>
across the street and my daughter said she&#39;s looking for a way to <br/>
meet her.  Hopefully that will work out, because she might be allowed <br/>
to play after school sometimes. <br/>
<br/>
But...It&#39;s hard to find families whose kids are allowed to play that <br/>
often.  There&#39;s usually limits on how often they can just spend the <br/>
day playing.  That&#39;s kind of frustrating for my kids.  <br/>

We found one family at the May HS gathering with daughters of similar <br/>
ages. And finally got together this fall for swim class and have a <br/>
playtime of two hours at alternating houses after swimming.  It is so <br/>
good for my daughter to have a meaningful friendship. And it is hard <br/>
to find neighborhood kids with free time to spare for play after <br/>
school, with extra curricular activities such as dance, soccer etc. <br/>

I saw your web site, very nice! I read your Ren makes rice pillows, I make<br/>
rice bags, some with herbs some not and sell dried herbs, and we make beads<br/>
out of sticks we find in the woods. I also make and sell cloth napkins and<br/>
bags, (we use little paper products if at all).<br/>

Our skinny dipping was in the hot tub, only cold if you get out :) (which a<br/>
