Have you looked under the GA thread at unschooling.com? I bet you could find <br/>
people in your state fairly easy.  Just go to unschooling.com and click on <br/>
the &quot;across the country&quot; folder, then to GA.<br/>
You have let these people intimidate you and make you believe you have to <br/>
listen to them. You don&#39;t.<br/>
Your child could never, ever be in the grades that require testing (just skip <br/>
third grade). I personally feel tests are damaging and would not make my <br/>
child take one under pressure, just for some stupid law.<br/>
I have an old GWS (growing without schooling) magazine that has a directory <br/>
of unschoolers. I&#39;ll see if there is anyone in your area. email me and let me <br/>
know what town you&#39;re in, or your zip code and I&#39;ll research for ya! You <br/>
aren&#39;t alone, trust me.<br/>
Don&#39;t let those idiots in your home ever again, they have no right.<br/>
I&#39;m glad you stood up to her, she was WAY overstepping her authority.<br/>
