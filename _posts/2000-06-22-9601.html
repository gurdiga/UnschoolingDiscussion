<div id="ygrps-yiv-103454040">Hi Everyone:<br/>
<br/>
had a thought... some people that I&#39;ve spoken to have told me that keeping <br/>
portfolios and logs of what the kids have done all day is required by their <br/>
state.  Has any body invented a computer program yet that gives you all the <br/>
headings and answers you need to the &quot;establishment&#39;s&quot; questions? (now <br/>
there&#39;s a job for my hubbie in computers if not) LOL<br/>
