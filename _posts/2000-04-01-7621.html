<br/>
Well yes I did go to the farm in 1998, I arrived exactly two years <br/>
ago yesterday and I&#39;m still here!!<br/>
<br/>
Check out the farm website... it&#39;s my son Nathan&#39;s work with Dick&#39;s <br/>
ramblings, I did some of the wording on &quot;The Compost Happens&quot; <br/>
page and I did the visitors page.  The two little girls on the first <br/>
page are my little ones<br/>
<br/>
I really need to update my website and say that I&#39;m now living on <br/>
the farm and tell a bit more about it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m really not sure.  Dick is old you see, so you have to realise he <br/>
comes from a different world to most of us(-;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What example is he setting by<br/>
&gt; going off to work (if he does) every day?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He had two families, with his first he and his wife both worked [he <br/>
was a teacher] and she a nurse, so mostly while she worked he <br/>
played domestic engineer and looked after the children.<br/>
He and his second wife ran a dairy herd, and the kids participated, <br/>
then when the farm almost went under he drove semi and would <br/>
often take his children on the road with him.<br/>
Now with my kids he talks with them a lot, he read every one of <br/>
&quot;The Little House on the Prairie&quot; books to them last winter, he <br/>
listens and treats them with respect.<br/>

work was the most important thing in his life.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have thought a lot about this aspect...  It seems to me that &quot;society&quot;<br/>
presents us with two acceptable schemes for supporting a family.<br/>
    1.  Dad works and mom stays home.<br/>
    2.  (more recently) Both parents work, and use PSing as daycare.<br/>
It seems to me the time is ripe for a new a new scheme where both parents<br/>
contribute financially, but niether has to work so much that them can not<br/>
also contribute to the &quot;domestic engineering&quot; aspects of life.  Eventually I<br/>
hope to create that kind of life... but for now my wife is full-time(+).<br/>
The opposite extreme...<br/>
  As to the example i set... I also think it is important for my sons to<br/>
have an image of their father as a &quot;contributor&quot; so I emphasize the value in<br/>
the work I do do- cooking, cleaning, etc... also they have seen me do lots<br/>
of different jobs including last summer and this summer upcoming when my<br/>
wife will take 2 months of and I will work planting trees for 3 months.<br/>
Last summer the highlight of thier summer was when they camped out in the<br/>
treeplanting camp where I was working for 2 weeks... It was so much fun, and<br/>
I do think it is important for all children to value the work that both<br/>
parents are doing otherwise it undermines thier respect for them.<br/>
<br/>
But mostly I feel it is the fathers that miss out by working so much... I<br/>
can&#39;t imaging it any more.  Not after I have experienced the difference in<br/>
the depth of my connection to them.  In an ideal world I think both parents<br/>
should have the privledge of experiencing this closeness with their<br/>
children.</div>

<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;     Hi!  I&#39;m Kyle and my wife is Paula.  We have two children, Steven<br/>
13<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and Kayla 9&gt;     Being the primary domestic engineer for the past six<br/>
&gt; &gt; years I would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; love to here from any other homedads if there are any of you out<br/>
there.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Kyle<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hi Kyle,<br/>
&gt; &gt; My name is Joshua and my wife is Selina.  We have 2 boys, Jordan (8) and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Daylon (just about 6).  I too am the &quot;primary domestic engineer&quot; in our<br/>
&gt; &gt; household.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wow,  I&#39;m impressed two Dads who not only stay home as the<br/>
&gt; primary domestic engineers [I love that] but also homeschool!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now my partner wonders what you share with your children.  He<br/>
&gt; seems to have a problem with Dads staying at home with the kids<br/>
&gt; as he wonders what example they are setting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In defense of you guys,  I asked him what example his Mother<br/>
&gt; showed him and pointed out that all his strong traits [he&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; scrounge] and interests were fostered by his Mother and what she<br/>
&gt; did.  Way back when he was a child his Mother was very frugal,<br/>
&gt; she was divorced but never took a job, instead she rented rooms<br/>
&gt; and lived simply.  This rubbed off on Dick and he worked many<br/>
&gt; hours as a teen, was in the marines for three years during the<br/>
&gt; Korean thing, and saved most of his money and had a sizeable<br/>
&gt; sum to put down as a deposit on the farm.   She was a keen<br/>
&gt; gardener and knew the benefits of adding organic matter to the<br/>
&gt; sandy soil to improve it.  This has turned Dick into an organic<br/>
&gt; fanatic, you should see the size of our compost pile...  we even<br/>
&gt; composted the neighbours dead cow!!   She was very interested in<br/>
&gt; birds and at an early age Dick learned all he could about birds in<br/>
&gt; an unschooled way.   Also his Mother was a very tidy person, and<br/>
&gt; while this didn&#39;t rub off onto him the desire for order did, making for<br/>
&gt; some frustrations, as sometimes we have a bit too much to do<br/>
&gt; here for the place to be kept orderly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So hopefully he may now look at the role of stay-at-home parents<br/>
&gt; of any gender as the most important job there is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
