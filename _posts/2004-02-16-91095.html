<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145953161">My son Matthew wanted to play violin and he wanted lessons. He chose <br/>
a Suzuki teacher and he enjoyed learning some of the &#39;form&#39; from her <br/>
but when he began to play songs she had not assigned she insisted <br/>
that he NOT do that and she especially did not like that he had <br/>
memorized some of those same songs. When he asked her to show him how <br/>
to play vibrato she told him that he couldn&#39;t learn that until Book <br/>
__. <br/>
She was also against the child learning to tune his own instrument.<br/>
He fired her as his teacher and just kept playing on his own. <br/>
<br/>
His older brother wanted to learn fiddle style and chose a teacher <br/>
which didn&#39;t last long either. Both brothers are teaching themselves. <br/>
<br/>
Their younger brother plays now and plays what he hears the other <br/>
boys playing. Little sister age 6 LOVES playing and she doesn&#39;t want a<br/>
teacher nor is she interested in learning the same things the boys <br/>
are playing. She simply puts a CD on the stereo and plays along. She <br/>
wants to play piano so we bought one for $50.00 from an estate sale <br/>
and she plays lovely little songs with no lessons. All the children <br/>
love to sing folk songs and love music in general. The oldest is also <br/>
teaching himself to play guitar and then wants a banjo. <br/>
<br/>
It is senseless to hire a teacher who tries to control and kill the <br/>
love of the instrument that the child has!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-20237632">I am really learning to appreciate my daughter Spring&#39;s piano teacher.  <br/>
Spring just started lessons this fall and early on she brought in a <br/>
Brownie song book which we had just bought.  The teacher asked her if <br/>
she wanted to learn how to play a song from it and pretty soon she <br/>
learned the melody and they started working on a simplified harmony <br/>
part for the left hand.  The teacher hosted a Halloween party and one <br/>
of the students played &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot; and a couple <br/>
of weeks later my daughter was picking the tune out on the piano.  I <br/>
mentioned it to the teacher and she found the music for her and  <br/>
started to help her begin learning it that day, even though it is a <br/>
rather advanced piece for a beginner.  I think it is so cool that my <br/>
daughter has a teacher that will incorporate whatever she is interested <br/>
in into the lessons.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112640485">Hello All.  I am writing to ask opinions about my children&#39;s responses to Piano <br/>
and other music lessons.  My son (14) and daughter (11) began Piano lessons a <br/>
few months ago.  Their teacher is lovely, laid back, and very gentle in her <br/>
approach.  She lets them guide the way. Jonah hated the music, and has decided <br/>
to return to electric guitar lessons (which he stopped when he felt too <br/>
pressured).  Julia has now decided that she doesn&#39;t like to practice and <br/>
therefore doesn&#39;t want to continue lessons.  Getting her to practice is about as <br/>
much fun as asking for help around the house!  I have explained to her that this <br/>
is something that is not punishment or even school that she must do, but <br/>
something that if she puts in the effort she might enjoy the feeling of <br/>
accomplishment and of course the music she has created.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the &quot;advice&quot; I have received has been to force them to continue, that by <br/>
letting them stop I am teaching them to quit.....yada yada yada  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Comments anyone?? <br/>

Practicing because someone tells you you&#39;ll get better is a poor  <br/>
cousin to practicing because someone is driven to get better. You have  <br/>
no control over the drive, but you do have control over the  <br/>
environment where drive can be sparked. For my daughter it was a DVD  <br/>
of Van Halen videos (after 15 years of sharing music with her dad) and  <br/>
reignited by a Judas Priest video on VH1.<br/>
<br/>
The key is support for *their* explorations in a rich environment  <br/>
where they can explore and stumble across things that intrigue them  <br/>
and parents with no investment in the direction or a goal other than  <br/>
enjoyment. If parents keep pulling their kids attention back to the  <br/>
path the parents think is important the kids will struggle to turn  <br/>
away so they can explore the paths the kids think are intriguing. Keep  <br/>
the paths open and accompany them where they lead.<br/>

YES! For some reason I did.  I of all people - the Julliard student was told to <br/>
put up or quit!!  I am concerned that the $25.00 weekly is so hard to come up <br/>
with each week. I am feeling pressured (old thinking) that if she isn&#39;t <br/>
practicing she isn&#39;t getting enough out of it, therefore she should stop playing <br/>
if she doesn&#39;t want to practice.  HOWEVER ..that being said, the one time we sat <br/>

But it&#39;s not a recommendation to just change what you call what you&#39;re  <br/>
requiring.<br/>
And you didn&#39;t answer any of our questions, either.   That&#39;s fine; you  <br/>
don&#39;t have to.  But if you&#39;re requiring those lessons and if you  <br/>
intend to require &quot;practice&quot; but are going to call it &quot;playing&quot;  <br/>
instead, that&#39;s not a solution.<br/>

Seriously.  Nagging and ranting and raving and chore charts and many  <br/>
avenues are all avenues to bad relationships and resentment.  If the  <br/>
house IS clean, it&#39;s clean with an air of sorrow or resentment over it  <br/>
like dust.<br/>

<br/>
The $25 is the same whether they practice or not.  If they look  <br/>
forward to the lessons, that&#39;s better than if they&#39;ve practice and  <br/>
don&#39;t want to go to the lessons.  I used to play like crazy when I was  <br/>
a kid sometimes--not from the right lesson, maybe just hymnals,  <br/>
transposing keys, messing around, playing from vocal books, trying the  <br/>
accompaniment lines, maybe just one hand if it was hard.  Some weeks I  <br/>
didn&#39;t practice, and went to the lesson anyway, because I would  <br/>
usually rather anywhere than at my house.<br/>
<br/>
I think many people stop taking lessons because they&#39;re tired of their  <br/>
parents nagging and shaming them all those days in between.<br/>
<br/>
I think the fact that you&#39;ve &quot;started playing again too&quot; is  <br/>
significant and probably helpful.<br/>
The fact that you had stopped playing should be looked at, probably,  <br/>
for some emotional clues you can use while deciding how to proceed.<br/>

<br/>
Can they each just play when and what they feel like playing?  Playing music <br/>
should be enjoyable.  I grew up with a musician, and then married one.  Neither <br/>
of them did well with formal lessons.  My mother took piano lessons as a child <br/>
and can play the piano pretty well, but my dad never took lessons and plays the <br/>
guitar and can write and compose music.  My husband did a variety of music <br/>
related things in school, band, choir, etc, so he knows how to read music, but <br/>
in everyday life, he just plays what he feels like playing.  He plays several <br/>
instruments that he&#39;s never had lessons for, violin, piano, bass, drums, guitar. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 ***Getting her to practice is about as much fun as asking for help around the <br/>
house! I have explained to her that this <br/>
is something that is not punishment or even school that she must do, but <br/>
something that if she puts in the effort she might enjoy the feeling of <br/>
accomplishment and of course the music she has created.***<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter has a friend that started playing the piano on her own when <br/>
she was little.  She never stopped playing.  Her parents gave her music lessons <br/>
which she took for a while and got what she needed and then stopped taking them. <br/>
 She still plays the piano.  She plays all the time, she loves it.  It isn&#39;t <br/>
practice, it&#39;s real playing, the same as when she first started doing when she <br/>
was about 6 or 7.<br/>
<br/>
Practicing a musical instrument has some merit, but ultimately it&#39;s not playing <br/>
a musical instrument, it&#39;s practicing, doing drills and such.  That can be fun, <br/>
but only if the person likes doing those sorts of drills.  I took violin lessons <br/>
for many years.  I liked doing those drills, but mostly because I pretty much <br/>
suck at actually playing the violin.  I could be good at all those exercises and <br/>
playing the various songs that I practiced, but that never expanded beyond.  I <br/>
never played just because I loved to play.<br/>
<br/>
Just like housework, don&#39;t make it something to hate or dread.  Don&#39;t force it, <br/>
don&#39;t coerce it.  If you want to do housework, then do housework, if you want to <br/>
play music, then play music.  Do it because you enjoy it, not because you have <br/>
to.  What is the point otherwise?  Is there some goal at the end, a prize to be <br/>
won?  That&#39;s the kind of thinking school does to us, do this ____ and attain <br/>
_____.  It&#39;s very goal oriented.  One could live their whole lives seeking goal <br/>
after goal and never finding meaning and joy in their lives, RIGHT NOW!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-125633773">&lt;Can you pay someone to clean  your house for $25 a week and free yourself <br/>
up to <br/>

 <br/>
Great idea but to pay someone to clean your house is more like 165.00 a  <br/>
week, around here anyway.  If there is anyone that will clean house for  <br/>
$25.00 a week I&#39;d be glad to find them.<br/>
 <br/>
But about the lessons, I understand when the children want them and it  <br/>
seems we sacrifice and then they decide they don&#39;t want them after all.   Seems <br/>
hard to swallow but the truth is it&#39;s even worse to continue to pay for  <br/>
something they&#39;ve lost interest in.<br/>
 <br/>
My sister in law (whom I&#39;ve known since we were 13 and not even thinking of <br/>
 being related, plays piano by ear, she taught herself.  When it was <br/>
pointed  out to her parents that she might even be GREAT if she had lessons, they <br/>
got her  some.  She didn&#39;t want them.  She was too advanced on her own for  <br/>
weekly piano lessons with a classically trained teacher who was appalled at <br/>
her  lack of &quot;correct form&quot;.  She could play any song she heard and play  <br/>
well.  While she was taking lessons she learned to HATE to play for  practice <br/>
or for anything remotely close to the lessons.<br/>
 <br/>
They finally figured out their money would be better spent on other  <br/>
things.  Surely, over time, she began to enjoy playing again, without  lessons.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not saying everyone that WANTS to play an instrument will figure it out <br/>
 on their own, I supposed there is some degree of natural talent or an ear <br/>
for  music that doesn&#39;t exist in everyone, but it certainly speaks to <br/>
motivation and  the LOVE of the music and playing it.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m thinking the answer is to just talk the child and ask them if they  <br/>
really want to continue with the lessons, maybe they&#39;re just don&#39;t want to do  <br/>
lessons right now, maybe they&#39;ll want to do it at another time.  Maybe at  <br/>
another time the lesson money won&#39;t even be so hard to come up with.  If  <br/>
they still want lessons maybe they have to figure out how to do what the music  <br/>
teacher requires for each class without feeling forced but see it as a <br/>
continuum  of the lessons that they DO want. <br/>
 <br/>
I know it&#39;s sometimes hard to reconcile that we GAVE them what they want  <br/>
but now they don&#39;t WANT it.  It&#39;s our stuff, we have to figure out how to  <br/>
let go of it.<br/>

***I am concerned that the $25.00 weekly is so hard to come up <br/>
with  each week. I am feeling pressured (old thinking) that if she isn&#39;t  <br/>
practicing she isn&#39;t getting enough out of it, therefore she should stop  <br/>
playing <br/>
if she doesn&#39;t want to practice. HOWEVER ..that being said,  the one time <br/>
we sat <br/>
down together, she liked that and played  longer.***<br/>
<br/>
Can you pay someone to clean your house for $25 a week and  free yourself <br/>
up to <br/>
play more music with your daughter?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544416836">-=-Great idea but to pay someone to clean your house is more like  <br/>
165.00 a<br/>
week, around here anyway. If there is anyone that will clean house for<br/>
$25.00 a week I&#39;d be glad to find them.-=-<br/>
<br/>
MANY people would come over for two or three hours for $25, and do  <br/>
some straightening up, maybe a bathroom and a kitchen floor.<br/>
The $165 a week involves being bonded, the cleaning people bringing  <br/>
their own supplies and equipment and doing a certifiably thorough job.<br/>
<br/>
If a mom feels she has no time, it would be possible for her to buy  <br/>
some time.<br/>

Wait, wait.... for $25 you could get one person.  Probably not &quot;many&quot;  <br/>
at the same time. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-874322155">Hello everyone...I am new to the group (joined about 2 minutes ago), but I felt the need to address this question since it is very close to home. A little background<br/>
<br/>
          My mother is a professional pianist/accompanist/teacher.  She worked with Jascha Heifetz, Leila Josefowicz, Dylana Jenson (etc.). When I was born she was determined that I would become the next great violinist and I started when I was 2 ½ . I was miserable to say the least.  One day when I was about seven I found a tape recording of myself at age 3.  My mom was pregnant with my brother and was asking me whether I wanted a brother or sister to which I answered I wanted a cello.  My mom dismissed the answer and went on talking.  Well, my grandmother heard the recording and suggested she switch me to cello.  At eight I began lessons and excelled quickly.  (Yes, musical family 4th generation.)  Thing is, I also liked ballet, gymnastics, ice skating and sports.  My mom though asked each of my coaches whether I had any potential to develop a career out of them.  The answer was no.  All of my lessons, except for cello stopped.  I was made to practice every day, and threatened with many things if I did not.  I began to resent the cello.<br/>
<br/>
side note.  I have always loved working with children, always was the &quot;game leader&quot;, and involved with peer counseling and other things at school<br/>
<br/>
When I graduated High School I was sent (literally the next day) to a Training Camp to &quot; learn how to teach. &quot;  I started teaching that August and within two years had a studio of about 20 pupils.  So here is the catch I love teaching. I mean really love it.  There is nothing I enjoy more than going out to work with children (and adults) of all ages and levels.  I have so much fun my work seems more like play to me.  (I have been teaching 21 years now).  But when it comes to the actual cello part, well, I could switch it to something else (if I knew something else as well).  My whole life was set up to do what I do now.  (Although I am constantly reminded by my mom what a great performer I could have beenhaven&#39;t performed since the kids were born.)  I don&#39;t go out of my way to hear concerts, or listen to cello music but I have numerous students at conservatories around the country though that do have this passion.  I do still love the cello, and the little three year old in me who asked for it is still there, but there is also so much baggage and memories that are painful.  Because of this I know I teach differently than the teacher who finds the cello (or any instrument) to be the most important thing in life.  I have always strived to make lessons enjoyable for my students, and for them to want to learn cello.  (I think even more so since I have started down this path). And yes, I have had many students whos parents have forced them to play (and practice), but none of them have wanted to stop lessons because they enjoy coming.  And you know what? They do learn.  They may not learn as much as the students that practice daily, but many of them have a love for the cello the others who are forced to do not.<br/>
<br/>
If your child is enjoying the lessons, continue them.  If the lessons are not enjoyable, stop.  Not everyone needs to learn how to play an instrument, or how to play it &quot;correctly&quot;.  Let him or her come to it because it is something they have a passion for, and want to do. Then it will be something they will carry with them for the rest of their life with good feelings associated with it.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, that was the other thing I was going to say.  When I turned 20 I started skating again, sometimes as much as 4 hours a day.  I loved it, the smell of the ice, the cold, the feeling of the blades against the ice.  For 8 years I followed this passion, and my mom protested the whole time about me breaking something and not being able to teach.  I didn&#39;t listen.  Then I got to the point where I just really couldn&#39;t go any further, mostly my own fear at that point. (I think!) I then started scrapbooking (&quot;waste of time my mom said, you should practice&quot; OMG I was 28!), and then when the kids were born doing home movies (&quot;horrible rock music, can&#39;t watch it&quot; was the response I got), and now for the last few years it has been gardening and raising our chickens. My mom, although she loves me and my husband and kids very much still thinks I have not reached my true potential.  I agree with her in that one, except for her it is about, always has been, and will be, about the music, and for me it is about my family and parenting in a much different way than I was raised.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060205353">Rachael - My heart just aches for you over here. To constantly be shut down<br/>
over and over and over again. I think in some circumstances we get to a<br/>
point in our life where we have to nurture and parent ourselves. Your mother<br/>
will never approve anything that is off the path she feels you need to<br/>
follow, but don&#39;t lose yourself in that. Do what you love for no other<br/>
reason than it feels good in your soul.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to you, and welcome to the group<br/>

<br/>
This is really beautiful.  I&#39;m sorry you didn&#39;t get to skate and do  <br/>
the other more physical things when you were little.<br/>
<br/>
I found even when my first was a baby, before we even considered  <br/>
homeschooling one way or the other, that it was deeply healing for me  <br/>
to be sweet and gentle with him and to let him do things I wasn&#39;t  <br/>
allowed to do, and to help him climb rather than say &quot;get down.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would like to quote your post in my collections, but would be  <br/>
willing to change some details and leave out the quote and make it  <br/>
anonymous if you would be worried that your mom might find it.  (Or  <br/>
I&#39;d be willing to leave it just as is in case it might be healing if  <br/>
she did find it.)    If it&#39;s not safe at all for you to have it out  <br/>
there, I&#39;d understand that too.<br/>
<br/>
I keep meaning to make a page just about practicing.  The discussion  <br/>
comes around once a year or so, somewhere or other.<br/>

Thank you for sharing.  I have received such wonderful support and guidance from <br/>
the people on this list.  Your story is beautifully written and very moving.<br/>
<br/>
As my children began piano lessons, I too started playing again and love it.  My <br/>
son has switched to electric guitar and having studied guitar for years, I would <br/>
love to pick that again too.  It&#39;s like being in a candy shop.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago, after a lot of therapy I learned to limit my parents comments and <br/>
opinions about my life.  That&#39;s not to say it doesn&#39;t sting or push my buttons <br/>
when they do opine, but I am quite adamant.  I learned that if at first they <br/>
don&#39;t respect the boundaries I set or what I say, to repeat myself again and <br/>
again and again until they get the message.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-586976588">My perspective is skewed to say the least right now. I&#39;m in the middle of<br/>
trying to leave a very abusive marriage with my soul intact and my children<br/>
not emotionally crushed, so her post struck a chord with me, but for other<br/>
reasons.<br/>
<br/>
My passion for unschooling runs deep and it&#39;s a struggle to let my children<br/>
experience the world at their own pace, and in their own way, with what is<br/>
going on in our house. When I am at my best, I can elaborate my points of<br/>
view and add more worth to conversations. But right now, I&#39;m just trying to<br/>
get through the days.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if my previous post came off differently than I intended. I&#39;m here to<br/>
read for inspiration and to remind myself of the path that I&#39;m on and that<br/>
it will get better when my life is my own again and I can parent the way I<br/>
know I&#39;m meant to, and to nurture my children without having to look over my<br/>
shoulder.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660988091">Thank you to everyone who responded to my post!  I wasn&#39;t expecting that, just giving my view to get it off my chest so someone other than my husband (and my dad) could hear it. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I would be honored if you were to use my quote, and no, my mother doesn&#39;t even have a computer so I am happy to have you quote me.  I actually met you at Good Vibrations and bought your Big Book of Unschooling (which I loved), however I didn&#39;t introduce myself! (I heard your kids speak too which just made me more sure of the path I was heading down...oh, and the coolest thing, Holly took a picture of my family at the beach day...we were so excited when we saw that because we had not brought our camera.) <br/>
<br/>
I discovered unschooling in April of 2008, the day before my eldest sons 3rd B-Day.  So, I have been working very much towards this path since then. I have read so many books, we have been to three conferences (soon to be four), which I find at this point to be very helpful, fun, and nurturing. <br/>
<br/>
 I came to realization that my mom would never accept me for who I was (just who I should be) a long time ago, although it didn&#39;t stop me back then from trying to please her...go figure that out!!!  There are also many &quot;ghosts&quot; that I know she fights all time, so I just accept her for the way she is, and share with her how I perceive things to be.  Some people are more open to change than others. I wish to make peace with myself in order to move forward, and that is me.  She is only willing to look backwards and find the negative in everything.  She may change though, and I am always hopeful, but I don&#39;t sit around waiting for it.  <br/>
<br/>
Selena, I hope everything goes better for you.  That made me very sad reading your post.  Thank you everyone for your warm welcome to the group, oh, and I will look into the other group mentioned as well.  <br/>
