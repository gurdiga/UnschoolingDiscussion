<div id="ygrps-yiv-163965700">&quot;When the representatives of the World Trade Organization meet in<br/>
Seattle for the 1999 Ministerial Conference on November 30-<br/>
December 3, there should be plenty for them to talk about. Like the<br/>
trillions of dollars a day in foreign exchange transactions that<br/>
have turned the global economy into an ungoverned casino that may<br/>
fail any day. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Like the rising global temperatures, ozone depletion<br/>
and extreme weather phenomena that suggest a major climate change<br/>
is underway. Like the document signed by 1,500 scientists<br/>
(including half of all living Nobel prize winners) warning that<br/>
humankind is proceeding down an unprecedented and catastrophic path<br/>
by destroying the life-support systems of the planet.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oddly, these issues hardly ever come up at these WTO meetings.&quot;<br/>
