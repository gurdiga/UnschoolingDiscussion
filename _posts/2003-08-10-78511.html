I thought I saw the words &quot;pinched nerve&quot; in your post.  (Gotta go with <br/>
what you tell me because that&#39;s how the medium works, ya know. &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s hope someone who knows more about medicine than me posts.  Until <br/>
then, think about what sounds more appealing using your body&#39;s <br/>
knowledge.  Then trial and error might help.  I think if a hot compress <br/>
doesn&#39;t sound good or doesn&#39;t make your neck feel relaxed and better <br/>
after trying it for 20? minutes (which would probably work for muscles) <br/>
then try ice.  Ice won&#39;t relax muscles but it will numb pain.<br/>

it feels better with the heat on it, but afterwards is worse than before,<br/>
your condition calls for ice.  That&#39;s what my Wonderful chiropractor taught<br/>
me!<br/>

The heat felt OHSOGOOD! But the ice (yuck) is doing the trick. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, everyone. It still hurts like hell, but I can move more.<br/>
