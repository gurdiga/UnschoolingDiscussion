<div id="ygrps-yiv-236986001">They also said that they estimated the trip for the magi would have taken at<br/>
least 5 to 6 months - so, once the news had made its way around and they got<br/>
the camels together for the road trip, that would make sense for them to<br/>
make the Jan 6th(little christmas in our house).<br/>
<br/>
Also, the April date correlates with Passover, which would mean everyone had<br/>
gone back to their town of birth, hence no room at the inn.<br/>

Poor Constantine gets blamed for everything. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From a website on The Feast of the Nativity:<br/>
<br/>
No record is found as to the date when the Nativity Feast of our Lord began<br/>
to be celebrated as a separate feast. It is known, however, that in the<br/>
early Christian Church the Birth of Christ, Adoration of the Magi and<br/>
Theophany [western Epiphany] were celebrated on the same day, January 6. The<br/>
date of introduction of the Nativity Feast into the Church calendar was<br/>
different in all 5 Patriarchates (Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria,<br/>
Constantinople and Rome). The Church of Jerusalem was the last one to adopt<br/>
this feast in the 6th century.<br/>
<br/>
December the 25th, was the date of a pagan festival in Rome, originated in<br/>
274 by the emperor Aurelian, as the birthday of the &quot;unconquered sun&quot;<br/>
(natalis solis invicti). Sometime before 336, the Church of Rome established<br/>
a commemorative festival of the birth of Christ, the Son of Righteousness.<br/>
The first evidence of the Nativity celebration in the East, as a separate<br/>
feast, comes from Constantinople.<br/>
<br/>
In 381, Gregory the Theologian delivered his 39th sermon on the feast of<br/>
Theophany and called it the festival of lights, commemorating the Baptism of<br/>
Christ, the true light. He speaks of the Nativity as recently past and<br/>
reminds his audience that in the Nativity Feast they followed the star,<br/>
worshipped with the Magi, were bathed in light with shepherds, glorified God<br/>
with angels, took Christ in their arms with Simeon and confessed Him with<br/>
Anna. He continues: &quot;Now, however, at Theophany, this is another event and<br/>
another mystery, the Baptism.¹<br/>
<br/>
On December 20, 386, in his sermon on the martyr Philogonius, St. John<br/>
Chrysostom looks forward to the Nativity Feast as the Birthday of Christ and<br/>
the festival from which all the other come. He also mentions the visit of<br/>
the Magi as commemorated on the Nativity day. And then, five days later, in<br/>
his sermon delivered on the Feast of the Nativity, Chrysostom says that this<br/>
feast has been known to Antiochenes for less than 10 years, although it has<br/>
been known longer in the West.<br/>
<br/>
It is also known that the separation of the Nativity and the Baptism into<br/>
two different holy days occurred in Egypt (Patriarchate of Alexandria) in<br/>
the second half of the 5th century, shortly before the false teacher Arius<br/>
died.<br/>
***<br/>
[me again]<br/>
<br/>
The early church didn&#39;t consider the whens and wheres of Christ&#39;s birth<br/>
important, although the New Testament church included the Virgin Mary among<br/>
its members; she knew when and where she gave birth, and probably passed on<br/>
the information.  That&#39;s why there&#39;s a church in a cave near Bethlehem.<br/>
Tradition holds that Luke, who records the event Linus recites in &quot;A Charlie<br/>
Brown Christmas,&quot; spent time with Mary, essentially interviewing her for his<br/>
gospel.  (Not being a disciple, he got his info. second hand.)  Caesar<br/>
Augustus would have had anarchy on his hands if he&#39;d demanded the entire<br/>
populace travel to their home towns in *December*; it had to have been<br/>
spring.  The lambs wouldn&#39;t have been born yet, and no sheep would have been<br/>
out on the hills at night.  (I think, though, that if you&#39;re going to<br/>
believe in a virgin birth, you might as well believe in angels, too.)<br/>
<br/>
The date for the feast WAS chosen to coincide with winter solstice, and yes,<br/>
there was a Roman holiday for the sun on that day.  If you&#39;ve seen<br/>
&quot;Gladiator,&quot; which takes place around 192, you&#39;ll get a good idea of what<br/>
Roman pagan festivals were like - it was Constantine who outlawed the<br/>
gladiatorial contests as barbaric, inhuman rituals.   The church did choose<br/>
the same day, since the newly Christian populace needed something more<br/>
civilized to do,  and created a feast to replace it.   The hymnography<br/>
emphasizes the &quot;Sun/Son of Righteousness,&quot; not the little baby away in a<br/>
manger.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Your Nativity O Christ our God<br/>
Has shone to the world the light of wisdom<br/>
For by it those who worshipped the stars<br/>
Were taught by a star to adore you,<br/>
The Sun of Righteousness,<br/>
And to know you, the Orient from on High.<br/>
O Lord, glory to you!&quot;<br/>
(Orthodox troparion for the Nativity)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually the church is over the cave.  To get to the actual cave you have<br/>
to climb down a flight of stairs.  The door to that church is also very<br/>
small - the tour guide told us it was to keep Arabic (Muslim) horseman<br/>
from riding thru the church.  Men also are to have their head bare which<br/>
would prevent many Orthodox men from entering the church.<br/>

great following in the Roman armies.  Interestingly enough, Mithras<br/>
was born of a virgin mother too.  I would not place much historical<br/>
accuracy in &quot;Gladiator&quot; - about all I could substantiate was that<br/>
Commodus did succeed his father Marcus Aurelias but by the decree<br/>
of Marcus Aurelias.  Commodus was killed by a gladiator in the arena<br/>
and it was an assasination arranged by the Praetorian Guard - they<br/>
were tired of Commodus&#39;s excesses.   The Romans were barbaric and inhumane<br/>
by our standards but then so were many Christian nations well into the <br/>
Renaissance.<br/>

towns?  Also, didn&#39;t the census effect the entire Roman empire (&quot;all the<br/>
world should be taxed&quot;), and thus would not have had a specific Jewish<br/>
religious connection?<br/>

anyone when Anakin was conceived.  We got the movie on DVD last week.<br/>
I think it&#39;s time to watch it again!<br/>
