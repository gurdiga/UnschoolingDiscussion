&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think  the combination of all the sugar from<br/>
&gt;the many otter pops made her active  and even hyper-active<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;HEY!  I just wrote something about this, but not because I read  this.<br/>
&gt;Sugar doesn&#39;t make kids hyperactive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Caffein doesn&#39;t stunt their growth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Old wives&#39; tales.  Old mean mom tales.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just got done reading it! LOL Well, something kept her agitated and awake <br/>
the night she couldn&#39;t find the dog. And, something stopped her from being <br/>
able to get comfortable, night before last. I don&#39;t know if sugar makes kids <br/>
hyper-active, for sure. But  I can tell you THIS for sure: It made my skin <br/>
crawl, when I ate a whole bunch of Smarties while writing a paper in college <br/>
a lifetime ago. The huge amount of sugar that I ate caused a physical effect <br/>
that I could feel in my body. I&#39;ve also seen my boy, when he was littler, <br/>
after eating a lot of sugar, get more jumpy. Like, flinching and crying when <br/>
an airplane flew overhead. Not hyper, though. So, maybe the experts need to <br/>
study jumpiness, not hyperactivity.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;-=-I told her all of this, and said &quot;If<br/>
&gt;you eat sugary things this late  at night, you&#39;re setting yourself up for<br/>
&gt;sleeplessness.&quot;=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t think this is true.  It&#39;s worth looking into the blind studies  <br/>
&gt;done<br/>
&gt;with moms who were sure sugar caused hyperactivity.  It didn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-Well, day before yesterday, she ate a ton of otter pops AGAIN.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Otter pops are some of the cheapest things you could possibly buy, aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;they?  For anyone unfamiliar, an otter pop is a tube of plastic with  <br/>
&gt;flavored<br/>
&gt;water in it you freeze in the freezer, cut the end of the plastic off,  and<br/>
&gt;squeeze the stuff out and eat it.  It&#39;s like a popsicle in a tube, but  not <br/>
&gt;as<br/>
&gt;thick as popsicles (not as much flavor or sugar).  They&#39;re unfrozen  when <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;buy them, so they&#39;re cheap to ship.  You can freeze and melt and  <br/>
&gt;re-freeze; it<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup, and we all love em, so I keep them stocked. Something like three cents <br/>
a piece. The cost is not a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;-=- I let her know that I was quite angry about that, and considered it to<br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;extremely inconsiderate of the rest of the family for her to eat them up<br/>
&gt;like that. I didnt&#39; shout, but I was adamant and my tone of voice was firm.<br/>
&gt;-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Your response probably did her more damage than 200 otter pops would&#39;ve  <br/>
&gt;done.<br/>
&gt;Was the rest of the family really wanting Otter Pops?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, Sandra, that&#39;s WHY I was angry about it. Our whole family loves <br/>
them. I&#39;m an otter pop fiend myself. We&#39;d all eaten a bunch, before I and my <br/>
older girl went out for errands. Katie wanted to stay home and <br/>
watch...something...on TV. When we left, there were three sheets of them, <br/>
about 30 individual Otter Pops. When we got back two or three hours later, <br/>
with the thought of a lovely green otter pop in my mind, to find them all <br/>
gone, but two purple and a red...No, I don&#39;t think I was inappropriate to <br/>
let her know that her eating that many all on her own wasn&#39;t considerate. It <br/>
WASN&#39;T. Eating (nearly) all of something, when other family members might <br/>
want some, too?<br/>
That. Is. Inconsiderate.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;-=-I haven&#39;t told her &quot;you can&#39;t have those otter pops&quot; -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;WHAT?  You just did.  You told her she was extremely  inconsiderate to have<br/>
&gt;had those otter pops.  If you say &quot;yes you can&quot; and  then get angry, that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;bigtime entrapment.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I have told all the kids is &quot;You can have as much as you want of <br/>
something, but please keep in mind that there are five in the family. Don&#39;t <br/>
eat the last of the __________ (fill in the blank) without asking if someone <br/>
hasn&#39;t had some.&quot; sometimes, if I buy something for a specific recipe later <br/>
on in the week, I&#39;ll ask the family not to eat them as snacks. Might even <br/>
put a little note on there &quot;Strawberries for dessert on Tuesday. Please <br/>
wait&quot; or some such. With food in general it&#39;s &quot;Please ask before eating the <br/>
last/all of something, if anyone else would like a piece&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My girl didn&#39;t ask anyone if they wanted some. She just ate them. If she&#39;d  <br/>
said &quot;Pick up more otter pops while you&#39;re out, I&#39;m gonna finish them off&quot; <br/>
it would have been better. At least then, I could have said &quot;well, set aside <br/>
a green one&quot; ...but just consuming them without Considering whether someone <br/>
else might like a few...Inconsiderate. And, her doing that was simple <br/>
childish inconsideration. My telling her that it made me angry was a way of <br/>
helping her to see that her actions have consequences for others.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Can you make popsicles with juice instead of koolaid?<br/>
&gt;We use ice trays and the rings from Discovery Toys called  &quot;Boomerings.&quot;  <br/>
&gt;Put<br/>
&gt;the juice in the ice tray, stick a ring in each one, and  it takes four or<br/>
&gt;five of them to be the equivalent of a small glass of  juice.  My kids will<br/>
&gt;still eat those, even though they&#39;re big guys.   It&#39;s a quicky little bit <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;coolness and juice.  (other kinds of plastic  rings would work, and then <br/>
&gt;you can<br/>
&gt;wash the rings in the dishwasher by putting  them over two posts, or in <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;forks and spoons)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Juice is a good idea. We&#39;ve been making yogurt smoothies a lot lately. I <br/>
wonder if freezing the pureed ingredients in paper cups would work. You just <br/>
tear off the paper around the upper edges, and the bottom section of the cup <br/>
becomes the handle. Juice is a bit more expensive than otter pops, though, <br/>
and more work.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;-=-What should I do, if anything, the next time she starts sucking down the<br/>
&gt;otter pops, or the kool aid or whatever?-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Maybe find a happier healthier substitute, or just don&#39;t worry about  it.  <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t think otter pops could make anyone gain weight.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;-=-This child is not exhibiting much self control<br/>
&gt;here. Do I need to do  something/say something to stop her? I think she&#39;s<br/>
&gt;hurting herself-=-<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Is she eating those things because she&#39;s bored?<br/>
&gt;Find something to do that&#39;s fun that gets her busy, uses her hands, or gets<br/>
&gt;her out of the house where the otter pops aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And here, I think you&#39;ve hit the nail on the head. This little one is <br/>
turning out to be a kid that likes to be busy, and I&#39;ve got to work harder <br/>
at keeping up with her.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your advice, Sandra. It&#39;s a work in progress, and that&#39;s no lie!<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidC<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666535287">Kinda like when I ate a whole pineapple trying to go into labor with Jomy.<br/>
I read that the enzymes in fresh pineapple can trigger labor, so I tried it.<br/>
Well, you can imagine what happened�mouth all puckery and burnt from the<br/>
acid, even water tasted yucky when I tried to drink.  I couldn�t eat<br/>
anything else for about 24 hours and I suffered all of the resultant effects<br/>
of that in my 9 month pregnant body.<br/>
<br/>
When you ate your Smarties, were you also sleep deprived?  Did you drink 2<br/>
gallons of soda with them?<br/>
<br/>
So, just because I had a bad, if somewhat stupid experience with pineapple,<br/>
and you were less than smart with the Smarties, it doesn�t mean people<br/>
shouldn�t eat lots of pineapple if it works for them, or that people will<br/>
all react adversely to sugar, or color, or citric acid.  My husband can, and<br/>
does, eat Halloween sized bags of Smarties in October since that is the only<br/>
time we can get them.  He also eats 30 Fla-Vor-Ice at a sitting, (but<br/>
prefers Otter Pops, BTW) and still goes to work the next day.<br/>
<br/>
So, it�s probably not the sugar, it�s the ________ (fill in the blank as<br/>
appropriate).<br/>
<br/>
Tami, who doesn�t really care for Fla-Vor-Ice  OR Smarties.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>okay, could have been the colors or flavors, or the acid. And the same goes <br/>
for the otter pops. So, instead of saying to my daughter &quot;all that sugar <br/>
made you sleepless&quot; I should say &quot;It might have been the red dye or the neon <br/>
blue coloring&quot;? The main point would be pretty much the same, to try and get <br/>
her to think about how she feels after eating a whole lot of something.<br/>
<br/>
I also asked Katie if she felt hyper the night she ate all the kool-aid <br/>
pops, and she said no, but had a really hard time getting comfortable. Hm. <br/>
There was a diet out there a few years back for hyper active kids, and it <br/>
didn&#39;t cut out sugar, but artificial flavors and colors. So, it was more <br/>
than/other than sugar those nights, but it was still SOMETHING. It was too <br/>
much of something, and I&#39;m willing to let her figure it out by eating &quot;too <br/>
much&quot;...just leave a couple of green otter pops for da mom!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, there&#39;s more otter pops in the house, and three days later, more than <br/>
half of them are still here. The first two boxes of the summer got gobbled <br/>
down really fast, and the third box is staying longer.<br/>

<br/>
No, it wouldn&#39;t be pretty much the same point, it would be very <br/>
different!! If you tell her it&#39;s the sugar and you&#39;re wrong, she may <br/>
be thinking to herself about other times she&#39;s eaten sugar and been <br/>
fine. It&#39;s disconcerting when someone confidently tells you things <br/>
that don&#39;t seem to make sense, esp. when it&#39;s to tell you what you <br/>
did was bad for you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s great to be a detective with her. Ask her how she feels first,  <br/>
before even suggesting words like hyper. Or saying &quot;too much&quot; even <br/>
with quotes, lol! Maybe it had nothing to do with what she ate. <br/>
Maybe she ate all the otter pops AND was restless because of <br/>
something else. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you have to be silent and let her figure it out by <br/>
herself. I would talk about what it looked like to you and see if <br/>
there&#39;s anything to disprove your theory. It would be great to know <br/>
what sensitivities, if any, she has.<br/>

I&#39;ve seen DS (he&#39;s 7) go for those frozen colored sugar water things <br/>
big time on occasion - and usually (not always), it&#39;s a reaction to <br/>
something else: tiredness, stress, true hunger for something (that <br/>
I&#39;m-hungry-but-don&#39;t-know-what-I-want-so-I&#39;ll-just-keep-on-with-what-<br/>
is-convenient thing), and sometimes it&#39;s even just having the first <br/>
big box of them in the house for the warm weather time. We&#39;ve seen <br/>
the first box disappear about as fast as they got frozen. And the <br/>
third box, or the sixth box, may hang around until Labor Day. <br/>
<br/>
BTW I was wondering what &#39;Otter Pops&#39; were since I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve <br/>
seen that particular brand name on these things - I think we get the <br/>
FlaVorIce things, same deal, different label. The mental image <br/>
an &quot;Otter Pop&quot; brought to mind was something chocolatey on the <br/>
outside (otter color).</div>

Smarties in the US are little disks of sugar. I love them.<br/>

So if the Smarties the kid was eating were chocolate, then there&#39;s  naturally <br/>

I have a couple of sheets of them in the freezer from about 2 summers  ago.  <br/>
Just didn&#39;t get eaten.  I cleaned out the freezer the other day,  and put them <br/>
right out on the top, where kids could see them.  They&#39;re just  moved out of <br/>

So,  instead of saying to my daughter &quot;all that sugar <br/>
made you sleepless&quot; I  should say &quot;It might have been the red dye or the neon <br/>
blue  coloring&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How about give her access to a light, some books, a DVD player, and not  <br/>
worry about whether she&#39;s asleep or awake?   She has to figure it out  one her <br/>
own, in her own way.  Having a running commentary about why she  SHOULD be <br/>
sleepier or SHOULD be asleep doesn&#39;t help her feel her own  feelings.  You can&#39;t <br/>
feel her feelings, you can only guess.<br/>
 <br/>
Kirby doesn&#39;t need as much sleep as the other kids do.  When he was  hitting <br/>
the heavy puberty (growing tall, getting hairier) he slept more, but  after <br/>
that settled out he was back to not as much sleep.  I don&#39;t need as  much sleep <br/>
as Keith does, but I go through phases of needing more (always have,  since I <br/>
was a kid) and I just let that happen without beating myself up or  measuring <br/>
hours or blaming what I ate.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-The main point would be pretty much the same, to try and get <br/>
her to  think about how she feels after eating a whole lot of something.<br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
How can she think about how she feels with you talking so much?  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
-=- So, it was more <br/>
than/other than sugar those nights, but it was  still SOMETHING. It was too <br/>
much of something,-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Too much of mom-anger?<br/>
Who wouldn&#39;t feel uncomfortable having just been made to feel really  guilty? <br/>
 The otter pops probably turned to ash in her stomach. (Not  literally, <br/>
biblically.)<br/>

and original characters: Sir Isaac Lime®, Little Orphan Orange®,  Strawberry <br/>
Short Kook®, Louie-Bloo Raspberry®, Poncho Punch®, and Alexander The  Grape.  <br/>
Otter Pops® come in six zippy flavors and are pasteurized for purity and  <br/>
wholesomeness. Otter Pops® come in a variety of sizes: 18, 100 or 200-count  <br/>
boxes, and are a delicious fast freeze treat. <br/>

 (http://otterpopstars.com) We got them at Costco (formerly Price Club, as <br/>
I&#39;m doing a full disclosure so  the other side can form its case).  I have some <br/>
in the freezer, and they  were made in West Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.   These <br/>
we have are very  long and skinny like FlavorIce, and don&#39;t each have the <br/>
character.  We used  to get short ones with the character picture like on the <br/>
website.  Maye  that&#39;s why they say they&#39;re returning. &lt;g&gt;  When the kids were <br/>
little  they liked the pictures.  [We&#39;ve had these for a long, long time.  I&#39;m  <br/>
sure two years, but I&#39;m afraid three.  They were in the bottom of the  freezer <br/>
in the garage and kept being under other stuff.  They&#39;re in the  kitchen now, <br/>
very visible, but still not moving out of there.) <br/>
I&#39;m not recommending them as great food or anything, but neither are they  <br/>
likely to ruin anyone&#39;s health.  I don&#39;t know about you guys, but it was 98  <br/>
degrees at our house yesterday and not the least bit cloudy.  If kids will  get <br/>
liquid into them in ANY way, it&#39;s good. <br/>
Also just noticed some brilliant scientist said it seemed that tea and coffee <br/>

doesn&#39;t count.&quot;   Tea is just water that leaves soaked  in.  Puhleeeze.   People <br/>

There was one MANY years ago about spiders on LSD. Scientific  American, I <br/>
thought.  It&#39;s just... the doses they can figure out how to  administer to <br/>
spiders are likely to be way more than any human could ever  possibly get inside <br/>

I&#39;ve thought about that, too.  Especially in light of the diminuitive  side <br/>
of my first grandchild (born May 23rd weighing just 2 lbs., 14 oz.).   He was <br/>
on blood pressure medicine and all kinds of other things.  A grown  human could <br/>
probably drink his whole diluted dose at one sitting and not even  register <br/>
it.  <br/>
 <br/>
So how much coffee did a spider have to drink to mess up his webs?   It&#39;s <br/>
amazing to think about.<br/>

However,  for -some- people, teas and coffee can act as a diuretic <br/>

a problem than any  other caffeinated beverage probably (I think it&#39;s <br/>
the caffeine that sort  of &#39;revs&#39; the elimination musculature). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well then anything a person eats or drinks that causes them to &quot;have to go&quot;  <br/>
(in any fashion) is a problem on the scale of hydration-total-count, but <br/>
that&#39;s  a personal problem.  It doesn&#39;t keep coffee and tea from being made of  <br/>
water.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, it doesn&#39;t keep coffee and tea from being made from water but <br/>
anything (and grapefruit juice and cranberry juice fall into this <br/>
category) that -increases- the normal throughput of liquid CAN <br/>
become an issue in hot weather because what is going in is not <br/>
compensating for the extra output. Not it WILL, but it CAN. There&#39;s <br/>
a normal input/outgo level where most people keep about even most of <br/>
the time and there&#39;s a situation where drinking 3 cups of iced tea <br/>
and thinking that&#39;s enough fluids, might not be. My point was NOT <br/>
that they are &quot;suddenly&quot; liquids because someone said so but that IF <br/>
you ARE looking at hydration issues, things that increase output <br/>
might not be your best choice.</div>

<br/>

My point was that it never makes sense to repeat or act on what &quot;experts&quot;  <br/>
say without thinking and looking.  If it doesn&#39;t seem to make sense, maybe  it <br/>
really IS based on shaky ideas.<br/>
 <br/>
Increasing output is good.  Urinary tract and related  infections/cancer <br/>
would (I have heard from various sources over the years) be  fewer if people <br/>
(especially women) didn&#39;t wait so long to pee.  <br/>
 <br/>
When people live in the desert or they exercise a lot or they work in hot  <br/>
places (outside, a bakery, restaurant kitchen...) they need to drink a lot more  <br/>
than other people.  But the goal shouldn&#39;t be to try to get &quot;hydrated&quot; and  <br/>
then not pee it out.  All that X#of quarts of water is likely to keep  people <br/>
from feeling what they need and going by a chart instead.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
The point of hydration is to make the body function optimally, and what  goes <br/>
in SHOULD come out (along with wastes and salts and so forth).  We&#39;re  <br/>
organisms, not containers.<br/>
