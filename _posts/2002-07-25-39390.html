<div id="ygrps-yiv-457567839"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; By experience with boys has been different, the unschooled boys we know<br/>
&gt; have generally started reading fluently around 10, but there&#39;s been a lot<br/>
&gt; more variation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to hear others&#39; experiences.<br/>

My son read anything that didn&#39;t get up and move at age 5.  My mother (a<br/>
school teacher) pushed, and I could read flash cards by 3, and read for fun<br/>
by about 8.  My husband, who was never a great reader, remembers The Hobbit<br/>
being the first thing he ever read voluntarily.  He was 15 or so.   (Alan is<br/>
a very slow reader, but he&#39;s always reading something now that he&#39;s out of<br/>
school.)  <br/>
<br/>
My diligent, dedicated home*schooling* friend is still trying to get her 10<br/>
year old to read much of anything, her 8 year old reads upon request, and<br/>
much to her dismay, her 5 year old isn&#39;t interested in letters.<br/>
<br/>
I definitely think pushing can make the process take longer, but at least<br/>
from what I read, children (both boys and girls) vary widely in their<br/>
reading ages.  Sandra, wasn&#39;t it you that posted a great article about<br/>
reading a while back?  Somebody did.<br/>

I pushed my poor DS on and off for the last few years (he is 8 now).  I know<br/>
now that pushing did nothing but deter him.<br/>
No more pushing.<br/>
<br/>
My dd (when we first started unschooling) taught herself to read with little<br/>
help from anyone at age 6. She loves reading now.  My poor DS was scared to<br/>
read, he would yell at himself and get angry.   I fear that I caused this.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the article you mentioned which is on unschooling.com was a perfect<br/>
eye-opener for me.  I cried as I read it.  I know now that I must allow my<br/>
ds to move at his own speed.  Already (in the last few weeks) I see a<br/>
difference in him and guess what...he is reading here and there as he wishes<br/>
(with no yelling), which is how it should have been all along.<br/>
<br/>
There will be no more (bad) tears and frustration over reading in my home,<br/>
