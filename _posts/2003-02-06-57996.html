especially want to thank Robin -- your idea about the letter is great<br/>

are a bit unnerving for me -- things that are about my choices and<br/>
lifestyle.  I tried to tell her &quot;some times we do need your help with<br/>
things and sometimes we just have different ideas.&quot;  she took that<br/>
personal and thinks  we don&#39;t want her involoved in our lives. I want<br/>
her in my life but don&#39;t need this type of &quot;involvement&quot; from anyone.<br/>
(well...except you people!  LOL)     <br/>

I know I know ..it isn&#39;t her business.  But for some reason since it<br/>
comes from her it really bothers me.  I don&#39;t feel I come off like my<br/>
way of living is better than her way of living but it IS better FOR ME.<br/>
Why do people get so angry if you don&#39;t live &quot;their &quot; way??   Anyone<br/>
else have someone like this??  <br/>
<br/>
UUGGHHH!  Thanks for letting me vent.  I feel better now.   tt&#39;s<br/>
wonderful to have a whole crew of open minded folks to talk to!  <br/>

My mom is very similar,  she is taking my unschooling choices personally.   I think she feels like since I&#39;m doing something different her choices were wrong.   I&#39;ve never told her this but she gets very moody and defensive if I try and talk to her about our life.<br/>
 <br/>
She will say,  I trust you, I know you&#39;re doing what you think is right,  so I guess that&#39;s better than nothing.    But then sometimes she gets pretty sick of me being so different from everyone else and throws up her arms and says that she can&#39;t figure out where I came from,      nice, huh?<br/>
 <br/>
It is difficult sometimes being the martian.     I feel its good,  but still difficult sometimes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Did she cut your hair when you were a child and you didn&#39;t want her to?<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t get upset unless it isn&#39;t really about hair. It is about <br/>
control. As Joyce so eloquently writes, a family where ideas and <br/>
opinions are openly expressed and discussed and have always been openly <br/>
discussed and expressed and encouraged is a very different environment <br/>
than most of us experienced with the authority figures in our lives. <br/>
When change comes, and it comes to all eventually, if the habits of a <br/>
lifetime have been control instead of communication, then family life <br/>
can become a mine field of miscommunication and hurt feelings.<br/>
<br/>
In the eighties we had trickle-down economics - Reagan told everyone <br/>
that what was good for the top 4% of the country, the ones who control <br/>
most of the wealth, would trickle down and bring good things to those <br/>
below. It didn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
Many parents use the same kind of logic and will tell even their grown <br/>
children, who are protesting, that what is good for the parent *is* good <br/>
for the child. And if the grown child protests, well, then there&#39;s a <br/>
whole new generation of grandchildren to feel powerful over.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most of our society is all about control. It scares people when they <br/>
can&#39;t control someone else. Our societal language reflects that. Ever <br/>
hear someone referred to as being &quot;Totally out of control&quot;?? It&#39;s <br/>
*not* considered a compliment!<br/>
<br/>
I know for my folks, they were so much less controlling than their <br/>
own parents (and society) were to them. Heck, when my mom was growing <br/>
up, girls weren&#39;t allowed to wear pants to school. She was under *so <br/>
much* more control when she was a child, and she bucked that to a <br/>
huge extent in raising us. We&#39;re just continuing the trend. But it&#39;s <br/>
so hard for people to let go of. It&#39;s just something we all have to <br/>
deal with, in small and very large global ways. The country I live in <br/>
is about to go into a war that is all about control. Now I&#39;m not <br/>
meaning to start any kind of big political discussion, just pointing <br/>
out that control issues are micro and macro in our society. It&#39;s <br/>
everywhere. So we can&#39;t expect it to go away, just to deal with it <br/>
and do what we can within ourselves and our own households.<br/>
