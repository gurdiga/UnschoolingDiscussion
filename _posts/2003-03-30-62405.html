I think it&#39;s human nature to perform a sacrifice.  People do it in way more <br/>
subtle fashion than killing their best lamb and leaving the meat on an altar.<br/>
<br/>
If a mom can feel like a good mom by sacrificing something, then she can <br/>
perform that sacrifice and kick back, feeling successful.<br/>
<br/>
For some families the sacrifice is paying for Catholic school instead of <br/>
letting their kids go to public school.  They buy God&#39;s approval, and some <br/>
vague guarantee concerning morals and souls.  (It doesn&#39;t seem to work in <br/>
practice, but they have receipts, and there their kids are in uniforms, as <br/>
proof and all.)<br/>
<br/>
And for some families it&#39;s not so much a sacrifice as it is just a magical <br/>
spell, woven of bedtimes and rules and of saying &quot;NO&quot; as an incantation to <br/>
produce &quot;good children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Who&#39;s the childrearing advisor/expert someone told us about here who says <br/>
parents need to say no 3 out of 5 times?  Vitamin N?  That was CLEARLY a <br/>
magical formula for good parenting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-736594934">What?! Give me a break. I think it is good parenting to know what works<br/>
and what doesn&#39;t in your house. What good is it to feel like you&#39;re<br/>
sacrificing if the choice isn&#39;t good for the children. I don&#39;t think it<br/>
has anything to do with a mother&#39;s need to sacrifice for her children. I<br/>
think it&#39;s common sense. It isn&#39;t good for my daughter to eat milk. She<br/>
gets diarrhea. So I don&#39;t make her eat milk products. Is having to think<br/>
of alternate meal choices some superstition, sacrifice or magical<br/>
incantation? I don&#39;t think so. It&#39;s just a simple matter of not liking<br/>
to have to clean up diarrhea nor liking to see my daughter go through<br/>
the stomach pains.<br/>

That&#39;s not what I meant.<br/>

<br/>
If it really works, it&#39;s a scientific decision, and logical.  If it DOESn&#39;t <br/>
do the prescribed thing, then it&#39;s just ju-ju making the mom feel better.<br/>
<br/>
My mom had some dumb ju-ju.  No milk with fish.  She believed some people <br/>
were deathly allergic to the combination of fish and milk and it could kill a <br/>
person in an instant.  I&#39;ve never heard anyone else who ever heard of that, <br/>
but it made her feel like a good mom to forbid milk when fish was present.    <br/>
Don&#39;t take a bath when you&#39;re on your period.  That didn&#39;t make me any <br/>
friends.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve heard of that but it is only shellfish. Where I come from most people <br/>
will not eat milk products with shellfish. When there is a lobster boil you <br/>
have to watch what you bring because there are sure to be several people <br/>
horrified that you would eat milk with your lobster.<br/>
<br/>
I guess they wouldn&#39;t go for my seafood lasagne :-)<br/>

cooking it to take away some of the &quot;fishy&quot; smell.  It works, but she may<br/>
have inadvertantly killed hundreds of people!<br/>
