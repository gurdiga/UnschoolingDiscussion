<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358501111">A friend of mine who&#39;s been homeschooling (not quite unschooling but heading in that direction) for the past five years recently enrolled her 13 year old son in public school... his choice.  He wanted to be with his friends and cousins who went to the school, plus he wanted to play on the basketball team which wasn&#39;t going to happen unless he enrolled.  Anyway, he has been &quot;assessed&quot; to be on a much lower math &quot;level&quot; than his schooled counterparts and is struggling to catch up.  He also is having a hard time with grammar, punctuation, capitalizing, and other skills that are considered a given in school by eighth grade.  Needless to say, the school officials, family and friends, (and even her son) are blaming homeschooling and the fact that they haven&#39;t used a curriculum for years.<br/>
  <br/>
As a result, she wants to start doing school-at-home to keep her younger children up to grade level in the event that down the road they decide to go to school as well... the children agree with this as they see how upset they&#39;re brother has been over trying to catch up.<br/>
  <br/>
I just didn&#39;t know what to say to all this... especially since I&#39;ve always argued in favor of unschooling and felt like the message I was getting from my friend was that unschooling backfired on her family.<br/>
I totally believe in unschooling but can also see how a situation like this can happen and cause bad feelings, especially if the urge or need to go to school is a sudden one.  Have any of you had this happen to an unschooling family that you know, and what are some words of wisdom for such a situation?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
She let her kid get in that situation, without ever talking to him about what <br/>
public school would demand from him, without helping him prepare for it, <br/>
without acquiring a mindset that would smooth the transition?  The kid did <br/>
not likely know what it was going to be like, but she should have.  She <br/>
should have warned him, and spoken frankly with him about what he could do to <br/>
minimize it.<br/>
<br/>
It was an entirely foreseeable outcome that could have been prevented.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think she was actually unschooling.  I believe she was probably not <br/>
engaged with her children in the way most unschoolers I know are.  IMO.<br/>

<br/>
He actually attended school through second grade (prior to homeschooling for five years) so he did have some idea of what it was about.  I also believe they hired a tutor for some intense &quot;catching up&quot; for the week prior to his starting, but apparently it didn&#39;t help much.<br/>
<br/>
***I <br/>

<br/>
They weren&#39;t an unschooling family, but they were loosening up and deschooling a lot.  She never quite made the paradigm shift, I don&#39;t think, but this experience has unfortunately seemed to &quot;prove&quot; to them that unschooling isn&#39;t the right path. <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think that considering that angle (what if they want to go back to school) necessarily means that it&#39;s their first priority.<br/>
Having personally known a few kids who chose school voluntarily, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all that uncommon a scenario.  I think it&#39;s a logical &quot;what if&quot; question, especially for people new to the idea of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
***I don&#39;t deal well with people who have school as an attractive option at any <br/>
moment.***<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Attractive&quot; is a subjective term... the parents might think it&#39;s an unattractive option but the kids might still see certain aspects of school as very attractive for whatever reason.<br/>
<br/>
I think part of it is that in many places (definitely where I live) there aren&#39;t many options for teenagers who are ready to spread their wings and do things with other teenagers outside of school.  I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s a good thing- it&#39;s not- but still there it is.  Coincidentally, both kids I know who chose school over their parents wishes opted to go in their teens even though they loved homeschooling as young children.<br/>
One family was radically unschooling (incidentally he had the same problems with the transition), the other was the family I mentioned above.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the reason I wrote about this to the list is that now many people I know are going to use my friend as an example of how unschooling doesn&#39;t &quot;work&quot;, and I&#39;m trying to get my thoughts together so that I can respond clearly when the topic comes up.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know, and I should have said, &quot;that&#39;s what I did!&quot;  My son did go back to <br/>
school, but, he was only unschooled for 4 or 5 years.  He already knew a lot <br/>
about school.  But that didn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t need any preparation.  We <br/>
talked about how he would handle the hoop-jumping and all that.  It mattered <br/>
not to me whether he was &quot;ahead&quot; or &quot;behind&quot; anyone.  He was going in at 10th <br/>
grade...he struggled through the required algebra with a little tutoring.  <br/>
The algebra and the required reading-and-book-reports was just a means to an <br/>
end for him.  And that&#39;s what we talked about--how he would handle the <br/>
inevitable disapproval of his cavalier attitude about the whole thing, and <br/>
still get what he wanted from the experience.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the mom we were talking about fell down on that job.  And why does <br/>
all the boy&#39;s cousins know about his academic status, anyway?<br/>

<br/>
True.  She wasn&#39;t unschooling according to the way *I* would define it.<br/>
The way I should have phrased the above sentence is that she will be used as an example of how informal homeschooling (no curriculum or &quot;standards&quot;) doesn&#39;t work.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I&#39;d like to start out by saying that I have a hard time believing that <br/>
she unschooled the way I define unschooing, otherwise she wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
concerned about grades or catching up.<br/>
If the child is motivated to learn those things simply to keep up with his <br/>
peers, what is the point? If he really wants the school experience for the <br/>
reasons you mentioned, that shouldn&#39;t include stress on the part of the <br/>
parent over him being at &quot;grade level&quot;.<br/>
I do understand why it might bother the child to not be where his peers are, <br/>
but for her to blame unschooling shows me that she didn&#39;t truly get it.<br/>
Most 13 y.o.&#39;s aren&#39;t too interested in grammar, writing etc...quite yet. <br/>
Fairly common. Or often they are just beginning to use those things with real <br/>
life applications.<br/>
I certainly don&#39;t see how one could blame unschooling.<br/>
If she is giving her younger children lessons in order to prepare them for a <br/>
future that may not happen, that is not trust in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If that were my child, I would have gotten in contact with the district and <br/>
found out what would be expected in that school for that age and given my <br/>
child the information.<br/>
Then I would have left it up to my child as to whether or not having those <br/>
skills was important before attending school there.<br/>
If not, I would be fine with that. Let them get out of school what they <br/>
want/need at that time and don&#39;t make a big deal out of grades or levels.<br/>
If my child did want to be with his peers I would have brainstormed with him <br/>
on how to deal with that.<br/>
Sounds like the mother is using the convenient scapegoat of unschooling when <br/>
she may not have fully trusted it in the first place.<br/>

I guess the only thing you can do is to point out that homeschooling in<br/>
general, and unschooling especially, is not a one-size-fits-all proposition.<br/>
Kids get interested in academics at widely different ages if they&#39;re left to<br/>
decide.  This kid had just not decided to get academic yet.  Anyway, there<br/>
are probably plenty of kids at that school who are at about the same level<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142577858">Hi,<br/>
    why is it assumed that unschooling is to blame if a child is &#39;behind&#39; <br/>
(that&#39;s such a weird term) if they end up going to school. There are lots <br/>
and lots of children who&#39;ve been through the whole school process from start <br/>
to finish and are &#39;behind&#39;. Lots of kids when they are younger do well in <br/>
school but find they get &#39;stuck&#39; as they get older it&#39;s not that unusual.<br/>
Not every person is of an academic persuasion, that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t <br/>
have other talents, what it does mean is that school doesn&#39;t value them. Of <br/>
every class how many children are deemed to be &#39;behind&#39;? I don&#39;t think <br/>
there&#39;s ever any class where all the children are of the exact same ability.<br/>
The assumption is of course that any child who&#39;s  home ed never mind <br/>
unschooled and appears to be &#39;behind&#39; has missed out at home and would&#39;ve <br/>
been better off in school or had curricula forced down their throat, when in <br/>
fact they may have been better off being at home where they could develop <br/>
the talents they have unfettered by the constraints of a school that only <br/>
values one kind of person. I would like to know how the child feels who&#39;s <br/>
been &#39;behind&#39; in school? Did it do their confidence any good?  I doubt it <br/>
very much. They may well spend the rest of their lives comcentrating on what <br/>
they can&#39;t do rather than on what they can. HTH<br/>

just started kindergarten in Sept. She had the first parent teacher conference<br/>
right before Halloween. Eric has been identified as needing extra help with<br/>
reading. Seems that he scored low on a test on identifying the alphabet and/or<br/>
letter sounds. He will be receiving extra reading help.<br/>
<br/>
His mom is not concerned...knows that he will pick it up when he is ready and thinks<br/>
that it is a little ridicules that after a whole month and a half of school that <br/>
he has been labeled as  behind. Did not seem to be concerned that he might pick up<br/>
on the label (she said that they provide extra help informally with aides who come<br/>
into the class).<br/>
<br/>
And then there is his other friend Joey (also in kindergarten) who gets to go to<br/>
pizza hut because he read 12 books last month....<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad that we are homeschooling!<br/>

Sandra,<br/>
About how many in school, in your experience, would you say are deemed to be three or four years &quot;behind?&quot;  Meaning, say, an eighth grader who was deemed to be on a fourth grade math level?  I&#39;m genuinely curious, because I thought that kids generally repeated grades if they couldn&#39;t (or didn&#39;t want to) keep up.<br/>
<br/>
About schools and credit/blame... I always find it interesting that if a child does &quot;well&quot; (by school standards) the teacher/school takes the credit, but if the child does &quot;poorly&quot; the child/family gets the blame.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been told by a skeptical family member that even if my children do &quot;well&quot; in life after unschooling they&#39;d know that it was because my children are &quot;just smart&quot; and not because homeschooling was &quot;successful.&quot;  In other words, they&#39;d be successful in spite of homeschooling, not because of it.<br/>
<br/>
While he was saying this I was thinking of the phrase &quot;first do no harm,&quot; and how important that would be to success.  Then again, my definition of success was probably quite different from his anyway.  :-)<br/>

or three years BEHIND academically. He was tall and slow and <br/>
&quot;dumb&quot;---farmboy-like. He was also kind and gentle and sweet. Because of his <br/>
size, he wasn&#39;t picked on by the students; the teachers were a different <br/>
matter! <br/>

This was a private school, so if ya&#39; got the $$.... Anyway, he had plenty of <br/>

squeaked through, but he graduated from a well-respected private school. <br/>

His brother was in my class. Burns wasn&#39;t much quicker---but maybe only one <br/>
year or so &quot;behind&quot;. I hated watching them struggle so! I&#39;ll have to do some <br/>

that kids generally repeated grades if they couldn&#39;t (or didn&#39;t want to) keep <br/>
up. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I taught 7th and 9th, English.  I had a few kids who could just barely read.  <br/>
One seventh grader who couldn&#39;t, and he used to come and ask me for help, and <br/>
it was heartbreaking--he just wasn&#39;t getting it.  Years later he did, but by <br/>
then  he had been assured by dozens of professionals that he wasn&#39;t to <br/>
consider ever living a normal life.  Damned shame.  He was a nice, nice guy.<br/>
<br/>
Those kids who were way &quot;ahead&quot; had gotten there entirely on their own.  <br/>
Those who were behind were there SOLELY because of school&#39;s levels and <br/>
measures.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of &quot;social promotion&quot; is universal now, I think.  In one-room <br/>
schoolrooms, it hardly mattered what &quot;grade&quot; someone was in, although they <br/>
might be doing work with younger kids sometimes.  But in a big school <br/>
district with separate buildings and separate rooms and separate recess...  <br/>
well it became too dangerous to have BIG kids with very little kids.  They <br/>
could get hurt by those big &quot;dumb&quot; kids.  AND, worse, when puberty comes, you <br/>
don&#39;t want some aware/sexualized big kid in with young, innocent kids.  <br/>
<br/>
And so the law came about (where I was, anyway, and I&#39;m guessing every other <br/>
state in the U.S. for liability insurance purposes  if no other) that no one <br/>
could fail more than twice in a school career, and maybe not even twice, if <br/>
they joined up late.  Two years older than the &quot;ideal&quot; was the limit.  So if <br/>
(for example) 8th graders turned 13 by September 1, then the very oldest 8th <br/>
grader would be 15.  And I&#39;ve rarely seen anyone fail more than once, and <br/>
those failures were almost always boys failing first grade or 8th grade <br/>
(baffling first or second year, or beginning of puberty and some anger and <br/>
resentment being expressed)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s another reason schools hesitate STRONGLY to advance kids, because if a <br/>
young kid is put up a grade or two, they&#39;re in physical and sexual danger <br/>
(and the school&#39;s liability is high for endangering them).  So sometimes kids <br/>
are put ahead by one year, but not much more.<br/>

He would get sick every morning.  This was all 3 years ago.  We then put him and his sister in a SMALL (75 students TOTAL k-12) for 2 years.  He is still way behind what the SOLs would say a child his age should be BUT he is learning.  He is not into math and reading.  He loves to draw, play computer games, watch the discovery channel and be a boy.  We started out HSing with the school at home approach.  I started to see  the same frustration, fear, and attitude so we have totally backed up.  I keep having MAJOR panic attacks with him and the others at home.

He&#39;d bring his homework to work with him. I closed with him two nights a week. The week after I started working there, I realized he couldn&#39;t read - at all. After he realized that I wouldn&#39;t make fun or put him down, he started asking me to read him his homework instructions, and some other things. After we&#39;d been friends for several months, I asked him why he couldn&#39;t read. His answer - &quot;I don&#39;t know, the teachers just told me I was too dumb&quot;. Yeah, right. This guy worked two jobs plus went to school, and could take anything electrical apart and put it back together in a matter of hours. He hooked up the security system at the store in three hours flat - of course, never reading the directions. Come to find out, no one had ever taught him phonics. He knew the letters, but could not figure out what sounds they made, and he didn&#39;t have the ability to memorize sight words. By the time I got married and left 4 months later, he was reading. All he needed was someone to tell him which letters made which sounds. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-153423633">in response to the question on what schools do for the confidence of <br/>
kids who are &quot;below grade level&quot; (an artificial thing, at best)--<br/>
<br/>
I taught a ninth grade math class of students who had spent most of <br/>
their elementary years &quot;behind&quot;. At this catholic school, they were put <br/>
in a separate, slower math class with a small class size - 10 - 15 in a <br/>
class. They were both embarrassed to be in the class, but glad to be <br/>
able to keep up and understand what was going on. I was so amazed at how <br/>
low their self-esteem was, at how they referred to themselves as stupid.<br/>
<br/>
I loved teaching these kids - it was so rewarding to see them &quot;get it&quot;, <br/>
and to help them feel good about themselves and their ability to do <br/>
math. I think I was already an unschooler, even then, lol. Nearby <br/>
teachers told me that they had to close their doors, because my class <br/>
was too noisy. Another teacher was indignant that I let the kids use <br/>
colored chalk to work problems on the board - it was too messy and what <br/>
was wrong with white. The kids liked the colored chalk -- it was silly, <br/>
but really, how important was it what kind of chalk I let them use?<br/>
<br/>
Another time, I simply could not figure out why one girl wasn&#39;t <br/>
understanding what I was trying to explain. She was frustrated and so <br/>
was I. Then, the boy next to her ( a kid with a reputation of being both <br/>
a &quot;bad&quot; student and a trouble maker in the school. I didn&#39;t have any <br/>
problems - he was just a kid who spoke up when he had something to say. <br/>
Authoritarian types don&#39;t always like that.) Anyway, he shouted out, <br/>
that he knew what she didn&#39;t get, could he explain it to her. So I said <br/>
yes, and sat down. He scooted his desk over, and the two them put their <br/>
heads together while the rest of us waited. Trust me, in this strict <br/>
Catholic school (prob most schools), this was a &quot;stay after for extra <br/>
help&quot; situation. Well, after a few minutes, a light bulb went on for the <br/>
girl, who was proud and delighted that she &quot;got it&quot;. And the boy was <br/>
very, very proud of himself. We went on with whatever that day&#39;s lesson <br/>
was.<br/>
<br/>
Self-esteem comes from helping kids get to where they need to go, and <br/>
from helping them accomplish things (and knowing when to get out of the <br/>
way). It does not come from a one-size fits all education, and lots of <br/>
nice touchy feely stickers and things for &quot;self-esteem&quot;. It comes from <br/>
being engaged, accomplishing things on your terms. The way I approached <br/>
my classes was considered radical by the more authoritarian types, and <br/>
it used to drive them nuts that my classes tested out just as well as <br/>
theirs did -- afterall, my classes were noisy and had fun. (couldn&#39;t <br/>
possibly be learning anything, could they?)<br/>
<br/>
Schools shouldn&#39;t stomp on kids&#39; self-esteem, but too often they do. <br/>
Confidence comes from real accomplishment, from being treated with <br/>
compassion and respect, and from being engaged with and owning what you <br/>
do. How often does that happen in schools? They are not set up that way, <br/>
and teachers who try to do that are often treated as trouble-makers <br/>
themselves. Did you know that the average career for a teacher is ten <br/>
years? I lasted nine full time and a few more part-time. The schools are <br/>
chewing up a lot of teachers as well as kids.<br/>
<br/>
(sorry, off the soap box)<br/>
<br/>
just my two cents,<br/>

&gt; unusual.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Not every person is of an academic persuasion, that doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; have other talents, what it does mean is that school doesn&#39;t value<br/>
&gt; them. Of<br/>
&gt; &gt; every class how many children are deemed to be &#39;behind&#39;? I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; &gt; there&#39;s ever any class where all the children are of the exact<br/>
&gt; same ability.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The assumption is of course that any child who&#39;s  home ed never<br/>
&gt; mind<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooled and appears to be &#39;behind&#39; has missed out at home and<br/>
&gt; would&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; been better off in school or had curricula forced down their<br/>
&gt; throat, when in<br/>
&gt; &gt; fact they may have been better off being at home where they could<br/>
&gt; develop<br/>
&gt; &gt; the talents they have unfettered by the constraints of a school<br/>
&gt; that only<br/>
&gt; &gt; values one kind of person. I would like to know how the child<br/>
&gt; feels who&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; been &#39;behind&#39; in school? Did it do their confidence any good?  I<br/>
&gt; doubt it<br/>
&gt; &gt; very much. They may well spend the rest of their lives<br/>
&gt; comcentrating on what<br/>
&gt; &gt; they can&#39;t do rather than on what they can. HTH<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-85571531">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
:-)  agreed. It seems that everything is easier if you&#39;re enjoying it. <br/>
Once in high school we got in trouble for having too much fun in gym <br/>
class. (talk about teachers who needed to lighten up.)<br/>
<br/>
another time I put smiley faces and sad faces in for the x&#39;s and y&#39;s, <br/>
because I sensed the kids were intimidated by the algebraic notation -- <br/>
must be too hard because it looks so different. After they got done <br/>
laughing ( a math teacher who&#39;s silly? how&#39;d that ever happen?) they <br/>
were able to do it. It worked though, they relaxed and realized that <br/>
they could get it.<br/>
<br/>
We use colored chalk now too, but usually it&#39;s on the driveway -- a <br/>
really, really BIG chalk board! :-)  One time they turned the driveway <br/>
into a game board.. a sort of candyland type thing, made a die out of a <br/>
cube-shaped cardboard box, and they were the game pieces. It was pretty <br/>
cool. Soon other kids were wandering over to see what they were doing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
have a good day all ...<br/>
Susan<br/>
