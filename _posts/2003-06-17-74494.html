&lt;&lt;And Christmas cards can be THICK fat wonderful communication.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Last year was our first year of homeschooling - we started March 2002.  I decided to write up a newsletter-style journal of what we&#39;d been up to for the year and sent it along with the Christmas cards (one page double-sided).  It &quot;announced&quot; our homeschooling decision with a couple sentences about our philosophy and outlined most of the major events of the year as well as some of the everyday stuff.  I think it gave everyone a good idea of what we did with our time - most knew that we &quot;homeschool&quot;, but not really what that means.  I also included a section of faves for each of us: movies, books, events etc. I plan to keep this up each year so it will be cool to see how these change.  We have a digital camera so I also included pics with most of the sections.  It was really fun for me to put together and the recipients seemed to enjoy reading it.  One couple we only see only once or twice a year said they felt like they were all caught up on our activities for the year!<br/>
