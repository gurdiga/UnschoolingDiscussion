The army always seems to send us to cold, wet places, so all the hot air<br/>
occupies my head instead!  ;)<br/>

I thought that was supposed to make me lazy.<br/>
<br/>
My suspicion of school-marketting comes from having read lots while I was <br/>
teaching.  The arguments used to get kids into private schools are always <br/>
fascinating to me.   The arguments used to get kids into ANY school, I&#39;ve <br/>
made myself when I was a young and gung-ho teacher.  I talked my cousin Nada, <br/>
who grew up with me in the same house, in the same bedroom most of the time, <br/>
out of homeschooling when we were young hippies and she was making babies and <br/>
I was teaching school.<br/>
