I do several things.  I am a La Leche League Leader, plus I have a District <br/>
Advisor position with LLL, which means I keep in contact with several leaders <br/>
and pass information on to them.<br/>
<br/>
Before I moved, I started an Attachment Parenting group with a friend of <br/>
mine.  We met once a month and discussed many aspects of AP.  We had a large <br/>
group there of about 20-30 mom&#39;s with kids ages 1 week to 5/6 yrs.  <br/>
<br/>
I am getting ready to start another group here in Tallahassee, first official <br/>
meeting in Aug. or Sept.  I would love to get someone to donate a bunch of <br/>
material to make slings and give them out at the local hospitals.  What a <br/>
wonderful idea!  This is maybe on my &quot;want to do&quot; list.<br/>
<br/>
I only do things that my kids are welcome at and promotes family bonding, <br/>
ecspecially mother/baby bonding.  I do not think there is enough correct <br/>
information out there about the importance of families being together and <br/>
parents following their instincts.  I feel like this is my purpose in <br/>
life-along with my babes, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for asking,<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s what I wanna do! I&#39;ve told my LLL leader I want to apply, but she&#39;s <br/>
feeling so overwhelmed right now that I really feel like she&#39;s dropped the <br/>
ball on the idea.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been looking for volunteer opportunities where I can have my kids with <br/>
me, and they&#39;re mighty scarce!<br/>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m extremely interested in forming an ap support group in my area. Did you go through API or did you just form an independent one? I don&#39;t know what the response would be to a group like that, but I&#39;d love to give it a try.<br>
