<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a controversy over unschooling? There&#39;s something called &quot;the&quot;<br/>
controversy? <br/>
<br/>
I must be really out of touch.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is the startling quote from that very brief article, which left<br/>
out the in-the-world aspect of unschooling, concentrating on the domestic:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;There is nothing like the texture of kids having contact with each<br/>
other, making friends and relating to different adults in a school<br/>
setting,&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nothing like it - that&#39;s part of the problem. School is almost nothing like<br/>
real life outside of school.<br/>
<br/>
Not to be compared to the many adults and other kids they &quot;relate to&quot; while<br/>
pursuing their interests in the world....<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;texture&quot; of school - would that be sandpaper or maybe a cheesegrater or<br/>
the annoying itchy tag inside your collar ...  or perhaps a file to smooth<br/>
off the bumpy individualism?<br/>
