<div id="ygrps-yiv-657687645">Thank you all for the help!<br/>
<br/>
Julian and I talked about the options you folks mentioned, and we both zeroed <br/>
in on the same things. Karri, your suggestion of doing some weekly goal <br/>
setting was great. It will give us a way to set down a written plan so I can <br/>
give him the nudge he wants and needs in the directions HE wants to take. My <br/>
plan is to set some goals for myself, since we can companionably nudge.<br/>
<br/>
Deb L, your input about his needing me nearby was also right on. We&#39;re <br/>
planning to do more activities and field trips together as part of our goal <br/>
setting.<br/>
<br/>
Julian&#39;s need for structure wasn&#39;t so much a concern that he wasn&#39;t covering <br/>
enough specific academic topics, but more that he needed a little more <br/>
structure to his days so that he really does the things he wants to do. Often <br/>
he will spend many hours playing games on his computer, which would be fine <br/>
if that didn&#39;t get in the way of what he REALLY wanted to accomplish. I think <br/>
he&#39;s looking for balance, which I think is a pretty mature goal for a twelve <br/>
year old. <br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks for the help!<br/>
