<div id="ygrps-yiv-507624891">I know I have seen refernce to those who make their own bread. I was recently given a Vitamix with the grain grinding blade. I am very excited about this - and have been researching different articles and such an bread making.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering what those of you who made their own bread used for wheat. I have recipes that call for whole grain wheat or wheat berries. When I got into wheat berries there are several types.  Also, does anyone use &quot;groats&quot; - and am I correct in the assumption that this is uncracked oats?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help ;-) I am looking forward to trying this and giving up the bread machine ;-)<br/>

<br/>
When you are looking for your wheat berries you want <br/>
hard red spring wheat, hard red winter wheat, or hard<br/>
white winter wheat because these are high protein/high<br/>
gluten. See if the milled flour or berries says high<br/>
gluten, high protein or bread flour. Often in the<br/>
health food store you will find whole wheat flour<br/>
which should be fine for making bread and you will<br/>
find whole wheat pastry flour which is a low gluten<br/>
flour but good for making cakes and stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps<br/>
