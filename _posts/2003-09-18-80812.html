 </span></blockquote>Absolutely, Liza.  Fear of exposing breasts is a big reason more women don&#39;t <br/>
breastfeed in the first place and many breastfeeding experts are starting to <br/>
talk about the need to change our cultural perception of breasts if we are ever <br/>
to have a fully breastfeeding culture.  Katherine Dettwyler, an <br/>
anthropologist at (I think) UT has done cross cultural studies about whether or not breasts <br/>
are viewed as sexual.  (I believe the article is called &quot;Beauty and the <br/>
Breast&quot; and it&#39;s in a book she co-edited.)  Ours (US) is one of only two or three <br/>
cultures worldwide (I believe she looked at more than 50) which view breasts as <br/>
sexual.  Many many women are conflicted about breastfeeding in our culture <br/>
because of this.  In other places, that&#39;s what they&#39;re there for.  In the US, <br/>
it&#39;s kind of muddled and it affects the health of babies and their mothers in a <br/>
significant way.<br/>

&gt;find out.  This much I do know;  People in our country *are* guaranteed<br/>
&gt;the right to their outdated morality. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the last few years, quite a few states have passed &quot;right to breastfeed in <br/>
public&quot; laws, saying you have a right to nurse in public anywhere you have a <br/>
right to be.  (Although there was that woman who nursed while driving....can&#39;t <br/>
legislate good judgment I guess!)  Most of these laws state that it is not <br/>
indecent exposure to show the breast for purposes of breastfeeding.  So legally, <br/>
in these states, a mother does have the right to be exposed, regardless of <br/>
other people&#39;s comfort levels. The laws came about because people were and still <br/>
are being harassed for nursing in public.  (Often at swimming places, by <br/>
lifeguards, even when women are being discreet.)<br/>
<br/>
Attitudes towards breasts do affect whether people breastfeed or not.  Where <br/>
I live breastfeeding is very public, but people tell me when they visit some <br/>
parts of the US, no one does it publicly and they&#39;re very intimidated from <br/>
nursing outside the home.  I, being a product of my culture, have always tried to <br/>
be discreet as I breastfeed in public.  And it&#39;s true that it&#39;s very possible <br/>
to nurse discreetly.<br/>
<br/>
In La Leche League, we are careful to help women fit breastfeeding in with <br/>
this culture we live in.  But that doesn&#39;t mean that the culture is not a real <br/>
obstacle to breastfeeding.  It is.  Because of that, I have a certain <br/>
admiration for  the women who do &quot;whip it out.&quot;  Out there at the margins, I think they <br/>
have the effect of making the discreet women feel safer.  Even discreet women <br/>
are going to feel &quot;exposed&quot; if the local custom is to hide under those <br/>
elaborate cover-ups or worse, if most nursing women bottle-fed in public due to <br/>
shame.  The women who choose to be &quot;indiscreet&quot; are changing the culture, the way <br/>
flappers in the 1920s did.  It shocked; but it spread.<br/>

<br/>
I totally agree with your post.  I was one of those moms who <br/>
struggled with the idea of feeding in public.  I had a hard time <br/>
with the blanket and although it was a little easier with my second, <br/>
it was not too much better!  <br/>
<br/>
I think for the next one I am going to find a LLL leage before I <br/>
have the baby.  I had called someone once I was home with the new <br/>
baby and they were not too helpful.  In the furture, I think finding <br/>
and going to meetings where I feel comfortable ahead of time will <br/>
help so the support is already there.  By the time the baby comes, <br/>
you are too crazed to go check out meetings and support.<br/>
<br/>
I agree the more we see it, the  easier it looks and hopefully the <br/>
more inclined others will be to try!<br/>

Some of them include, how about how will I know if they are getting enough? what <br/>

can&#39;t drink alcohol?  Others fear being too &quot;tied down&quot; that they can&#39;t leave <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-447579187">I think the original poster was right that &quot;fear of flashing&quot; so to speak, is a big reason for not nursing.  The other reasons that you mention are also important ones, of course, but in my experience they tend to come from people who are at least *considering* nursing.  I&#39;ve talked to people who wouldn&#39;t even consider it, and the exposure aspect seemed to play a big part in their decision.<br/>
<br/>
I also agree with whoever posted that until breasts are seen primarily (or even equally) as food-sources rather than sex sources, there will be whole cultural bias against nursing.  I had not seen that K. Detwlyer article, I will look for it. I LOVE her writing about cross-cultural and cross-species extended nursing.  <br/>

Well, I was one of those people.  It makes it hard to leave the <br/>
