<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592949620">Brooke, Wow!  Although that doesnt really surprize me, I know the area, and<br/>
it is so different than kelowna.  I worked treeplanting for years in my<br/>
youth &lt;grin&gt; for two guys based out of Grey Creek.  We know lots of people<br/>
from that area, but have been so busy we have not made it back very often.<br/>
Would love to though!<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Joshua<br/>
p.s., could you post the adress for the BC home ed ass?<br/>
(thanks)<br/>

&gt; hi there...<br/>
&gt; We are in Nelson area..up the lake actually near the Kokanee Glacier<br/>
&gt; provincial park. We have a great support group here and have joined CHEA<br/>
&gt; (Can. Home Educ. Assoc). The president of that organization is in<br/>
Penticton.<br/>
&gt; We (Kootenay Home Educators)  have a newsletter as well (which I edit) and<br/>
&gt; have lots of get-togethers. There are 70 families that get the newsletter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have home educated from the beginning and so the girls have never been<br/>
&gt; to school.  They are now 9 and 11. It has been an interesting journey...<br/>
&gt; I think that Deb (Buzz) is from BC too. But I could be wrong. Hey<br/>
&gt; buzz...are you there. ???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unschooling is the way to go and I am really enjoying the journey. I have<br/>
&gt; used curriculum and even had us enrolled in a Distance Ed. program one<br/>
year<br/>
&gt; but none of us enjoyed it. This year has been the best...and we owe it to<br/>
&gt; our more relaxed and trusting approach with unschooling.<br/>
&gt; Keep in touch...<br/>
&gt; Brooke in BC.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Brooke, what town are you from?  We live in Kelowna, bound to be not too<br/>
far<br/>
&gt; &gt;away, unless you are way out east.  Anyways, nice to hear someone else on<br/>
&gt; &gt;the list from B.C.!<br/>
&gt; &gt;I just became aware of &quot;unschooling&quot; or &quot;natural learning&quot; 2 months ago..<br/>
&gt; &gt;shortly after making the decision to school at home.  It fits us like a<br/>
&gt; &gt;glove, and I have even managed to meet three other familes here in<br/>
Kelowna<br/>
&gt; &gt;that also more or less unschool.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Take care,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158594509">I&#39;m still looking forward to a visit to the Kootenays (haven&#39;t forgotten our<br/>
discussions of last fall, Brooke) -- but at least I am sure I will get up to BC,<br/>
as I have just been confirmed as the keynote speaker at the BC Homeschooling<br/>
Association&#39;s &quot;Graduation&quot; ceremony at the annual conference June 9-10.  Probably<br/>
will be presenting some workshops there too!  Hope to finally meet some of you<br/>
beyond the world of dotcom!<br/>
