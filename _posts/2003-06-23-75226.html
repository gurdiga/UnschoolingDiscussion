<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330540078">I was so in love with Bach and everything he stood for, but then I heard he <br/>
divorced Leslie Parrish and married a much, much younger woman. And he&#39;s <br/>
selling flight scarves on his website. As an anti-capitalist and a feminist, I <br/>
was offended. If anyone does any research that debunks what I heard, I&#39;d be so <br/>
grateful to know! I felt betrayed, after all that soulmate talk, to hear he and <br/>
Leslie didn&#39;t make it work!<br/>

Maybe he has big alimony payments and needed income.<br/>
