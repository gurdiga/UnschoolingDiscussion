<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was supposed to earn my way through college playing the violin.  I played<br/>
&gt; for 5 years and was pretty good at it, but quit in high school.  My memory<br/>
&gt; of quitting is that I was tired of having to carry the violin around, back<br/>
&gt; and forth to school and home for practice and use at both places.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dh says that is ridiculous, that nobody would ever quit for that reason.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had many a student quit because they were tierd of toting the<br/>
instrument around.  Some school districts give cellists two instruments<br/>
because that way the kids are less likely to quit.<br/>
<br/>
Violin is smaller but an extra burden with a heavy backpack.  But I could<br/>
easily see you getting tierd of the expectations, too.<br/>
