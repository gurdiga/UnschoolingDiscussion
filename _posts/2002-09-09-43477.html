<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843556314">**I went thrift shopping yesterday and came home with Survive, Pirateer<br/>
and TAKE-OFF.  In TAKE-OFF you have to fly a fleet of planes through a<br/>
web of flight paths connecting cities around the world.  And we had to<br/>
make up the rules as the rules were missing, even though the little<br/>
packages of parts were unopened.**<br/>
<br/>
You can download the rules in pdf format here, or order a paper copy<br/>

Betsy, did you read over the last Unschooling.com newsletter? There was much <br/>
discussion of math stuff in it, if you&#39;d like a copy email me off list and <br/>
I&#39;ll send it to you.<br/>
