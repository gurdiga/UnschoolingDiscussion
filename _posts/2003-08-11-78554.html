<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080556835">&quot; So, if anyone who is traveling by plane, or has no way of <br/>
transporting thier bike, would like to do the bike tour and needs a bike, just<br/>
 <br/>
email me and I will bring one for you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was just moaning to myself today that I really WISH I had a bike rack!! I want to do the tour, but I can&#39;t possibly get my bike up there...so ME, ME, ME (wildly waving hands).<br/>
Any Cervelo&#39;s? :) Ok, wishful thinking.<br/>
I have a road bike by Giant...the OCR 2 and I think it&#39;s a 54 or something. It seems like the size I need varies from brand to brand, so do you have one that might work? I&#39;m not picky, as long as I can reach the handle bars without falling over. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>DH said he has a Lotus 3000R that is 54 cm.. He also has a Bridgestone RB-1. <br/>
that is 54.. but, it&#39;s his &quot;prize bike&quot;.. lol.. He was planning riding it <br/>
himself.    So, if the Lotus is OK, we will put your name on it  :-)<br/>

afraid he&#39;ll be sacked out from too much fun the night before. I <br/>
would be eternally grateful. Wee man will probably nurse right before <br/>
I leave and be asleep the entire time! :) That&#39;s the plan anyway.<br/>
Hopefully he won&#39;t scare Liam quite so badly this year....sigh.<br/>
He plays a bit more nicely now. I hope......<br/>
