<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620591161">Hi,<br/>
My name is Johanne.  I live in a small town in Lewis County in <br/>
Tennessee.  I<br/>
have been homeschooling for a few years now.  I have a 7 year old and <br/>
an<br/>
almost 1 year old.    I made a website for<br/>
the homeschoolers here and for all homeschoolers.  It has a classified<br/>
section too, that all homeschoolers can use for free to sell your <br/>
homeschool<br/>
items or other items. I also have a calendar for field trips/chats to <br/>
be added too,<br/>
that anyone can use.   I also have a lot of links to sites for <br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
Have not had a lot of traffic yet so hope that you all will take a <br/>
look at<br/>
it and bookmark it. If you like it please tell other homeschool <br/>
friends about it too.<br/>
