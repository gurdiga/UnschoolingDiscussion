<div id="ygrps-yiv-758365204">I finally (very long story) got my hand on one of John Holt&#39;s books -<br/>
How Children Learn.  But I can not read it.  It is so hard.  I have a<br/>
really hard time reading anything that doesn&#39;t grab my attention from<br/>
the first page, and hold it the whole time.  I have to give this book<br/>
back to the library in two weeks, but I don&#39;t know how I&#39;ll ever get<br/>
through it.  But I want to!  How do I convince myself that I can read<br/>
this?  It&#39;s like a boring textbook on a subject I&#39;m interested in.  <br/>

Thanks in advance, <br/>

P.S.  This is way off topic - I&#39;m setting up my webpage - right now I&#39;m<br/>
working on the pregnancy and birth part, then I&#39;ll work on babies and<br/>
children (try to convince people to homeschool in a discreet way...). <br/>
If anyone has anything they&#39;d like to share - how they overcame morning<br/>
sickness or dealt with a jerk of a doctor they were stuck with, etc.<br/>
please e-mail me privately.<br/>

Thank you</div>

<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about it.  You can understand unschooling without John Holt.  :-) <br/>
 If it&#39;s truth, you should be able to rediscover it yourself by observing and <br/>
reading and thinking and discussing.  If it&#39;s truth, it won&#39;t be held just in <br/>
one book, in one person&#39;s ideas.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt bogs me down too.  I read one 15 years before I had my daughter and <br/>
his ideas seemed neat but way too theoretical and pie in the sky.   But I <br/>
haven&#39;t been able to get into any since then.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best things about unschooling is choosing the means that are best <br/>
for us.  And not having to rely on one resouce.   Or even one type of <br/>
resource.  I found the message boards a lot more valuable since I could read <br/>
lots of different point of view and lots of different opinions on a wide <br/>
variety of ideas.  Then also seeing unschooling in action made it real for <br/>
me.  So, trust your instincts.  If one way isn&#39;t working, find something else.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the list of suggesting reading from Unschooling.com&#39;s library.  I <br/>
haven&#39;t read more than a couple.  The Teenage Liberation Handbook really hit <br/>
home for me (even though my daughter is only 8).  It&#39;s been a long time but I <br/>
recall enjoying Homeschooling for Excellence.  And I&#39;ve read bits and pieces <br/>
of the Unschooling Handbook.  One book that&#39;s not here that I&#39;ve heard good <br/>
things about is The Day I Became an Autodidact : And the Advice, Adventures, <br/>
and Acrimonies That Befell Me Thereafter by Kendall Hailey.<br/>

I know what you mean....I found that &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; was more interesting <br/>
for me and, actually, I&#39;m not sure I ever DID read &quot;How Children Learn&quot; !!  <br/>
Holt&#39;s earlier books were written while he was still trying to effect change <br/>
in &quot;the system&quot;...TYO is the book written after he basically gave up on <br/>
institutional schooling and advised us to teach our own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991060317">My favorite Holt book by far is &quot;Learning All the Time&quot;, his learning to<br/>
play the cello after age 40.  I also think in its own way, it is the<br/>
most useful for homeschooling parents, as helps reconnect us to what it<br/>
is like to really be learning things for the first time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-721015005">I loved John Holt&#39;s book &quot;How Children Learn&quot;.  It answered so many<br/>
questions I had.  But it may not be for you and that is okay.  There are<br/>
other books that may be more interesting to you.  I think unschooling is<br/>
finding what works for you.  Finding what interests you.  Perhaps magazine<br/>
articles like the compilation from HEM magazine might be more interesting to<br/>
you or some of the books written by homeschooling parents.  A lot of<br/>
homeschooling web-sites have long lists of books that other homeschoolers<br/>
have enjoyed.<br/>
My recommendation is to return Holt&#39;s book and find something that is<br/>
interesting to you.  If you are only reading it because some of us love it<br/>
then we are replacing the school education gurus who tell you what to do.<br/>
We can only share what helped us - we each have to find our own paths.<br/>
This really applies to those who asked &quot; what do I do today to unschool?&quot;.<br/>
I do what works for me and my children - what they like to do, what I am<br/>
interested in sharing with them, places I am interested in taking them or<br/>
they ask to go to.<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have always been very much an unschooler to myself in reading books.  I <br/>
never &quot;force&quot; myself to read a book that somehow doesn&#39;t hit me right then, <br/>
for whatever reason.  I figure it&#39;s just not &quot;my season&quot; to read it right at <br/>
that point, without getting too hard on myself.<br/>
This is what I would do in your situation...<br/>
Scan through the book over the next two week.  Just pick it up every once in <br/>
awhile, not with the thought that you&#39;ve GOT to read it, but just browsing.   <br/>
Things will jump out at you.  Read through the things that do.  This might be <br/>
enough to get you to the front of the book and wanting to read it cover to <br/>
cover.  If so, great.  If not, don&#39;t worry.  At least this way, you&#39;ll know a <br/>
little more about what the book covers and then later, you might be compelled <br/>
to try the book again.  It has taken me years to sit down and read some books <br/>
cover to cover.  I don&#39;t think it means they are &quot;too hard.&quot;  I think it just <br/>
means I wasn&#39;t ready for the material yet.<br/>
Hope this helps...be easy on yourself!<br/>

&lt;&lt;The Homeschooling Book of Answers by Linda Dobson<br/>
<br/>
88 of the most frequently asked questions about homeschooling answered by <br/>
parents from diverse perspectives. Unschooling is included along with other <br/>
approaches to learning.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Joyce recommended a lot of good books!  I want to focus in on this one, <br/>
because the way it is organized is really helpful for someone who finds the <br/>
idea of sitting down and reading a whole non-fiction book a bit discouraging. <br/>
 This is a great book for reading in little chunks, and in any order.<br/>
<br/>
The Homeschooling Book of Answers, by Linda Dobson, is organized with common <br/>
questions about homeschooling and answers to those questions.  When I first <br/>
got my hands on this book, I read the list of questions in the table of <br/>
contents, and then jumped straight to the ones that were of most interest to <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Question 1 is &gt;&gt;Can I teach my own children if I don&#39;t have any teacher <br/>
training?&lt;&lt;.  Question 10 asks about &gt;&gt;... keeping the costs of homeschooling <br/>
to a minimum&lt;&lt;. Question 30 asks about John Holt.  Question 81 tackles the TV <br/>
question.  Probably my favorite question is #83 &gt;&gt;All I ever read about in <br/>
the newspaper is exceptional homeschooled kids doing exceptional things.  Are <br/>
there any normal homeschoolers?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I never peak at the end when I&#39;m reading fiction, but when <br/>
reading non-fiction, I give myself complete permission to jump around.  <br/>
(Let&#39;s hope that horrifies the school teachers!  &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-287203095">Hi Nancy<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine has been on a &#39;musical quest&#39; over the last few years. She<br/>
learnt piano and violin as a child with teachers of the<br/>
rap-the-knuckles-every-time-you-make-a-mistake variety and so though she wanted<br/>
to play again, it was pretty traumatic until she unlearned her fear of<br/>
teachers. She&#39;s been through several instruments and untold teachers since. And<br/>
what she told me a while back makes sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
First, find the instrument that belongs to you. Even if you think it&#39;s piano,<br/>
don&#39;t be too proud to say after a while, this isn&#39;t me after all, and change to<br/>
cello. And then to flute. That was her process. Then she finally knew that the<br/>
flute was &#39;home&#39; for her.<br/>
<br/>
Second, you are paying. Don&#39;t be afraid to say &lt;this teacher isn&#39;t for me&gt;, and<br/>
seek out a new one. My friend has done this several times. Sometimes because<br/>
the teacher didn&#39;t suit personality-wise, sometimes because my friend&#39;s needs<br/>
changed.<br/>
<br/>
Having found her right instrument and right teacher, my friend, although she<br/>
doesn&#39;t sit the music exams, went from zero to grade 5 in six months.<br/>

 This is wise advice. My 11 yr old daughter kept telling us she wanted to <br/>
play the fiddle for a long time.  &quot;But why&quot; I asked,&quot; we HAVE a piano&quot; (I am <br/>
embarrassed to admit) So I started to teach her piano. But fiddle kept coming <br/>
up. So we started looking for a teacher. &quot;Surely you mean the violin&quot; said <br/>
the music stores and schools.&quot;No, the fiddle,&quot;I repeated.<br/>
So after much word of mouthing we found a teacher. Then we had to find an <br/>
instrument. No one had one to rent, so we kept asking around. Then a friend <br/>
asked her sons violin teacher. she had a student who had outgrown her jr. <br/>
viola. So we bought it for $75.00.<br/>
And Sarah has been happily and beautifully fiddling for about 6 months.  And <br/>
by the way, she now is teaching herself piano.<br/>

&gt; Hi Nancy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A friend of mine has been on a &#39;musical quest&#39; over the last few<br/>
&gt; years. She<br/>
&gt; learnt piano and violin as a child with teachers of the<br/>
&gt; rap-the-knuckles-every-time-you-make-a-mistake variety and so though<br/>
&gt; she wanted<br/>
&gt; to play again, it was pretty traumatic until she unlearned her fear of<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; teachers. She&#39;s been through several instruments and untold teachers<br/>
&gt; since. And<br/>
&gt; what she told me a while back makes sense to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First, find the instrument that belongs to you. Even if you think it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; piano,<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t be too proud to say after a while, this isn&#39;t me after all, and<br/>
&gt; change to<br/>
&gt; cello. And then to flute. That was her process. Then she finally knew<br/>
&gt; that the<br/>
&gt; flute was &#39;home&#39; for her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Second, you are paying. Don&#39;t be afraid to say &lt;this teacher isn&#39;t for<br/>
&gt; me&gt;, and<br/>
&gt; seek out a new one. My friend has done this several times. Sometimes<br/>
&gt; because<br/>
&gt; the teacher didn&#39;t suit personality-wise, sometimes because my<br/>
&gt; friend&#39;s needs<br/>
&gt; changed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Having found her right instrument and right teacher, my friend,<br/>
&gt; although she<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t sit the music exams, went from zero to grade 5 in six months.<br/>

&gt; &gt; OK, for all of you musical geniuses out there, I hanve always wanted<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; play the flute, piano and folk guitar.  It will probaby have to wait<br/>
&gt; a bit,<br/>
&gt; &gt; as I have a LOT going on right now, but when I get ready where<br/>
&gt; should I<br/>
&gt; &gt; start?  Should I get lessons, get books or just get instruments and<br/>
&gt; start<br/>
&gt; &gt; playing?  What do you (already-been-there-done-that-folks) think?<br/>

&gt; -I&#39;m in virtually total agreement with Carol.  In my experience (which<br/>
&gt; is considerable) the key issues, in order, are the right instrument,<br/>
&gt; and the right teacher.  There was an extraordinary study done in<br/>
&gt; Northern England some years back (which is now published as &quot;The Right<br/>
&gt; Instrument for Your Child&quot;) in which children who continued on with<br/>
&gt; their music education right up to and including conservatories were<br/>
&gt; compared with those who quit.  There was no evidence that the<br/>
&gt; &quot;musicians&quot; were any more innately musical than those who quit.  The<br/>
&gt; single most important factor was finding the instrument which<br/>
&gt; maximized the temperament and physical and emotional proclivities of<br/>
&gt; the child.  I imagine that is true for adults too, it has been in my<br/>
&gt; experience (I went through much of my life musically unfulfilled,<br/>
&gt; although very musical, until I could find the instrument.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a small section of my forthcoming homeschooling book &quot;And the<br/>
Skylark Sings with Me&quot; on &quot;Choosing a Music Teacher&quot;.  It is meant of<br/>
course for use with kids, but would be happy to send it along off the<br/>
list (don&#39;t want to clutter the list with attachments.)<br/>
