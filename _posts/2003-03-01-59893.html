<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106976149">Not if you believe that taking a class is the ONLY possible way to<br/>
accomplish that goal.  If a person thinks they can unschool until they bump<br/>
into something they need/want to learn, then they must take a class to learn<br/>
it, that isn&#39;t really unschooling.<br/>
