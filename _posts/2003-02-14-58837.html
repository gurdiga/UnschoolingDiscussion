<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; making excuses for not being able to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;So basically there are no legitimate reasons why someone might have trouble <br/>
unschooling to the degree that you do? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the most legitimate reasons would be &quot;I don&#39;t want to,&quot; or &quot;My <br/>
husband doesn&#39;t want to,&quot; or &quot;My kids don&#39;t want to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If people come here and make excuses which imply that unschooling just isn&#39;t <br/>
in itself a workable thing since THEY can&#39;t get it to work, that seems to me <br/>
to be like someone going to a La Leche League meeting and saying &quot;Well MY <br/>
baby really LOVES bottles, so I&#39;m not going to nurse all the time,&quot; or &quot;It <br/>
seems to me that nursing at night only encourages them to wake up at night, <br/>
so I&#39;m only going to do it in the daytime.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If people want to do that kind of thing they should say &quot;I want to give my <br/>
baby bottles&quot; rather than &quot;blame&quot; or credit the baby, or say &quot;I don&#39;t want to <br/>
 nurse at night&quot; instead of presenting what seems like rational explanation <br/>
(training a baby to be awake or not) in a group which exists for the purpose <br/>
of trying to help parents know that even at night their babies will be <br/>
hungry, and experience fear and other emotions.  Even at night they&#39;re <br/>
growing.  Even the memories they have of being ignored at night can harm the <br/>
person they&#39;re becoming (and maybe MOSTLY night memories are memorable, if <br/>
they cry and wait and get scared and feel abandoned – lots of people have a <br/>
moment or two of remembered childhood darkness trauma that still affects them <br/>
as adults).<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s not about what any individual family does, it&#39;s about what people <br/>
claim and recommend in public.<br/>
<br/>
If someone who isn&#39;t unschooling posts a ton of advice and experience based <br/>
on school or structured homeschooling, I picture half of an hour-long La <br/>
Leche League meeting being about how to sterilize bottles and what kind of <br/>
latex nipples are most like the breast.<br/>
<br/>
Children learn all the time.   They learn at night, they learn while they <br/>
look like they&#39;re zoned out staring out the window, they learn while they&#39;re <br/>
watching movies, they learn while they&#39;re sticking sticks in the fireplace, <br/>
they learn while they&#39;re taking a shower.    Parents can accept that and move <br/>
toward it and use that knowledge to enrich their children&#39;s lives and to see <br/>
learning, or they can resist that and keep wanting unschooling to look like <br/>
school at home, or points in between.    Declaring a point-in-between stance <br/>
to be as good as unschooling can get does not, in my opinion, benefit either <br/>
that family nor others here reading, if there are others who can say &quot;Do you <br/>
want to take the next step?&quot;   Saying &quot;I&#39;m happy where I am, though I know <br/>
there are other steps I could have taken&quot; isn&#39;t as harmful as saying &quot;They <br/>
won&#39;t learn anything from TV,&quot; or &quot;Some books are trash.&quot;<br/>

do that unschooling won&#39;t help him do?<br/>
<br/>
But, in lieu of specifics, it seems those who are certain they can&#39;t<br/>
unschool can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
It seems those who are certain they can unschool can.<br/>
<br/>
If I were doubting about whether unschooling would work, then I guess I&#39;d<br/>
read Debbie/Myfunny4&#39;s post about her son. I would read AnneO&#39;s and<br/>
Zenmomma&#39;s stuff and others who are successfully unschooling on the message<br/>
boards. I would ask them questions.<br/>
<br/>
Just because someone decides they can&#39;t make something work doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
that the philosophy doesn&#39;t work. But until someone who deeply and abidingly<br/>
trusts their children to the depth that AnneO and others do says that<br/>
unschooling won&#39;t work for every chld, then my feeling is the door is still<br/>
open.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe I just don&#39;t get this all perfect or nothing sense... maybe I&#39;m just<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one expects anyone to be perfect. But there is an expectation that<br/>
someone&#39;s doubts and struggles (to the point where they are saying that&#39;<br/>
won&#39;t work) won&#39;t prevent other people from getting to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If there are philosophical ideas (as opposed to specific tips) here that<br/>
someone decides to reject for their family, does it help other people<br/>
unschool to tell us that philosophy won&#39;t work for them? What would be the<br/>
point? To expand the definition of unschooling so someone can feel<br/>
comfortable here not unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to make unschooling work, there is a great deal of wisdom<br/>
here to help them do that. If someone doesn&#39;t want to unschool or just wants<br/>
to use some of the ideas, what would be the purpose of stating on the list<br/>
that radical unschooling won&#39;t work for them?<br/>

for &quot;special needs&quot; kids.  And she never mentioned anything about &quot;to <br/>
the degree that&quot; she does. SHE isn&#39;t making the comparison to herself <br/>
in any way - she&#39;s talking about unschooling. Do you think unschooling <br/>
will not work for special needs kids? Do you think that just because <br/>
there are exceptional extreme cases where unschooling is not a good <br/>
option that it is a good idea to say that &quot;unschooling won&#39;t work for <br/>
special needs kids?&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re reading that into it, I think.  It might help to thnk of it like <br/>
vegetarianism. From the pov of a vegetarian, it is WAY better to eat <br/>
meat only once a week than at every meal -- but it still isn&#39;t <br/>
vegetarianism.<br/>
<br/>
So - being unschoolish is good to whatever degree --- but it isn&#39;t <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; unless it is all the way.<br/>
<br/>
Worth pointing out - not worth feeling &quot;left out&quot; or judged or anything <br/>
over. It is perfectly all right to make your own decisions about how <br/>
much you want to take from the unschoolers here -- don&#39;t say you are a <br/>
vegetarian except on Saturdays when you go out for prime rib &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly! Why come here and try to knock down the ideas this group is <br/>
based on? Why do people come here and admit they know nothing and yet <br/>
waste constant bandwidth on how they are misunderstood and misused <br/>
because people don&#39;t want to listen to their ill written and ill thought <br/>
out posts on subjects they admit they don&#39;t know anything about?<br/>
<br/>
People who come to this have three choices, they can:<br/>
<br/>
1). Accept that there is something of unique and of special value going <br/>
on here on unschooling-dotcom (after all the old timers say so.)<br/>
<br/>
2). Reject that there is something special of value here and go <br/>
somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
3). Join the group and change the group more to one&#39;s own liking. This <br/>
is a large group with some well established ideals and ideas that people <br/>
seem to be happy with so changing it might involved some special <br/>
leadership qualities and charisma. Group loyalty might need to be <br/>
subverted too.<br/>
<br/>
Constant whining about why things here aren&#39;t like things in other <br/>
places might lead others to suppose that the one posting the message:<br/>
<br/>
has a screw loose<br/>
has an ax to grind<br/>
has an inflated sense of their own self importance<br/>
doesn&#39;t have the research skills necessary to be a self-directed learner<br/>
is a clueless newbie<br/>
<br/>
Not exactly the charismatic qualities of leadership that would inspire <br/>
the majority of group members to change their minds and make the group <br/>
and its ideals over in a new image.<br/>

mail is not a crime, and its already been pointed out that it would be stupid <br/>
for me to forward mail to someone who is on a public list..    The much <br/>
greater accusation is that if dishonesty.   I will not get an apology, but I <br/>
will stand by my integrity 100%.  I have not lied,  or solicted support or <br/>
defense in any way from any one.  Period.    I can&#39;t prove that, but no one <br/>
can prove otherwise.   <br/>

&gt; &gt; If someone wants to make unschooling work, there<br/>
&gt; is a great deal of wisdom<br/>
&gt; &gt; here to help them do that. If someone doesn&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; to unschool or just wants<br/>
&gt; &gt; to use some of the ideas, what would be the<br/>
&gt; purpose of stating on the list<br/>
&gt; &gt; that radical unschooling won&#39;t work for them?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with this totally.  I found much here to<br/>
challenge my ideas about parenting and<br/>
homeschooling--a surprise since I had read, discussed<br/>
and thought about this so much that I thought I had it<br/>
pretty well down.  Nice to be challenged, actually. <br/>
I&#39;ve made some changes with my kids--especially in not<br/>
limiting computer time (something I used to be<br/>
militant about) because after reading many posts here<br/>
I finally understood that this was about respecting<br/>
and trusting my kids to make the right choices for<br/>
them.  I see that I can loosen up and watch them<br/>
become who they are without constant surveillance.  It<br/>
has made an incredible difference in<br/>
homeschooling--every day unfolds so much more<br/>
harmoniously now. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, what I find difficult about this<br/>
list is how often a power struggle develops that just<br/>
seems to go and on and on.  Also, as a &quot;newbie&quot; to<br/>
unschooling, I find the following comment discouraging<br/>
and insulting:  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Constant whining about why things here aren&#39;t like<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; If new people don&#39;t feel free to express doubts and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>concerns along the way, they may very well give up <br/>
prematurely.  There is a lot of deconditioning that<br/>
has to take place in unschooling, obviously, and it<br/>
may take some time to &quot;get it&quot;. <br/>

Linda -- why you hit &quot;reply&quot; -- your mail program automatically adds <br/>
&quot;re&quot; to the subject line.<br/>
But yours also had &quot;fw&quot; in the subject line. So did you say that you <br/>
added the &quot;fw&quot; notation to posts you were sending to this list?<br/>
If so, why?<br/>
<br/>
Ignore me if you want to - this is just purely idle curiousity on my <br/>

&gt; Hi Pam,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, here it is, glad you asked, maybe we can move on.<br/>
&gt; Lately, when I have responded to a post,<br/>
&gt; I find that the subject line is full ,<br/>
&gt; so, I felt the need to shorten in up a bit, but wanted the group to<br/>
&gt; see that it wasn&#39;t the original post, but mine,<br/>
&gt; so, I deleted in the subject line and sometimes kept FW, etc..<br/>
&gt; so, the group would know it was a response.<br/>
&gt; I am finding that it has caused alot of tribulation, so now, I have<br/>
&gt; stopped doing it. And sometimes, I hit the forward key, and not the reply.<br/>
&gt; Hope this clarifies for you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m *really* sorry Linda, and it isn&#39;t at all important, but it&#39;s bugging me<br/>
too. Just call me an anal-retentive logic freak! I get that you&#39;re<br/>
shortening up the subject line. That&#39;s not a problem at all and is helpful<br/>
in fact when they get long and convoluted.<br/>
<br/>
The question is *how* did the FW get into your subject line? The message<br/>
from Teresa that you replied to has a subject of:<br/>
<br/>
Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] OH!..  THATS the answer.. silly me<br/>
<br/>
Your reply has a subject of:<br/>
<br/>
FW: oh! thats the answer...silly me<br/>
<br/>
There aren&#39;t any messages from anyone that you could have replied to that<br/>
have the FW: in the subject. In that thread your reply is the first one to<br/>
have the FW.<br/>
<br/>
In fact your subject line doesn&#39;t even match if it came from shortening<br/>
Teresa&#39;s. Did you perhaps retype the whole subject line and mistakenly put<br/>
in FW instead of RE? That&#39;s not a problem either! My anal-retentive side is<br/>
just seeking an explanation that matches the facts.<br/>
