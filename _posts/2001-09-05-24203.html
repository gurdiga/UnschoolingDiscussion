<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057085725">hi tara... i just read your post about your son being upset as you have not<br/>
been teaching him the way he thinks you should be!! in fact i printed it off<br/>
for my son storm to read!! just last night he was saying things similar to<br/>
what your son has been saying to you.. he wants more work to do.. we have<br/>
been unschooling for three years now and he has been the one to give me the<br/>
most challenges with it.. i am constantly printing off things for him to do,<br/>
last night however i threw it right back at him.. i told him he had all the<br/>
freedom in the world to learn anythng he wanted to do that i was not his<br/>
teacher and  but that i would help him in anything i could i told him he has<br/>
access to anything in the world with the computer and a whole community to<br/>
ask questions and explore i told im he was free to take any classes i was<br/>
capeable to gt him to as he is only 13 y.o.i told him he probably needs to<br/>
limit his t.v. time and i will make them change the channel if i think<br/>
cartoons have been on way too long.. generally i do not allow them to just<br/>
sit and waych t. v. i throw them outside!! but back to the subject.. i<br/>
basically threw it right back at him and told him it was his responsibility<br/>
to decide wht he wanted to learn and how.. he is very competitive and always<br/>
want s to be one step ahead of everyone else so i suggested that he call the<br/>
principal fo the local high schools himself and ask about takeing classes..<br/>
which he will not do but i still threw it in.. i suggested that he could<br/>
take classes with the 4 h or whatever he wanted to do.. i  ordered some<br/>
books from cobblestone  and i told him they even sent a teachers guide so he<br/>
could look at it and do the lessons if he felt the need.. i offered to hepl<br/>
him with anything but told him i was not the teacher and he had choices to<br/>
make and he was the only one who could make them well we will see...  i did<br/>
not point out to him all the learning he does when he is building entire<br/>
cities outside with blocks of sawed off wood.. or when he sits for hours and<br/>
designs cities etc... he so far does not see that as learning.. and i told<br/>
him that he is actually lucky to have been able to be with his dad when he<br/>
tore down an entire old barn.. and now they are rebuilding a barn on our<br/>
land with the materials .. he also does not see that as learning.. so with<br/>
this kid i guess i will continue to print off pages for him to do untill he<br/>
gets sick of it maybe???<br/>
<br/>
 hope you feel better knowing i have a kid like you have!! and i cant wait<br/>
to see other posts to your mail.. hopefully someone can help me too...<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: respect<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think unquestioning or instant obedience is a useful trait to<br/>
teach<br/>
&gt; young humans who are going to need to be their own masters before any of<br/>
us<br/>
&gt; parents are ready. :) We&#39;re in this to teach life skills, and who wants a<br/>
&gt; bunch of obedience adults running around? Look where that gets us! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think obedience is a fine thing to teach dogs and horses, however.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Respect to me boils down almost entirely to the golden rule, karma, or<br/>
&gt; whatever else we want to call it: Treat others as you would like to be<br/>
&gt; treated, because that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen anyway. (Hmm, maybe we<br/>
should<br/>
&gt; call that Golden Karma &lt;eg&gt;).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, if your husband &quot;obeys&quot; the children -- i.e, complies with their<br/>
&gt; reasonable requests for time, attention, things, &quot;instantly&quot; he may find<br/>
&gt; that sooner or later the children will respect him in the same way. (Maybe<br/>
&gt; not, personalities will differ).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If your husband breaks promises (intentionally or through forgetfulness),<br/>
&gt; says, &quot;in a minute&quot; and forgets (I&#39;m horribly guilty of that one because I<br/>
&gt; have a hard focus, it&#39;s something I&#39;m trying VERY hard to retrain myself<br/>
&gt; on), says, &quot;you didn&#39;t say please&quot; to them but doesn&#39;t say &quot;please&quot; when<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; asks them for something, or expects them to give a great deal more than<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; get from him (or even AS MUCH as they get -- the balance from a parent<br/>
&gt; giving time or attention or services to a young child is necessarily much<br/>
&gt; greater than the reciprocal), it all boils down to reasonable and<br/>
&gt; unreasonable expectations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In this household, kindness and safety and honesty (my work in progress)<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; the key points. Obedience doesn&#39;t even make the top 10, except for the<br/>
&gt; puppy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: What is respect?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My husband and I are at odds (not uncommon) about wether the kids are<br/>
&gt; &gt; respectful or disrespectful. I think my husband confuses obedience with<br/>
&gt; &gt; respect. Just because the kids don&#39;t immediately obey, my husband gets<br/>
upset<br/>
&gt; &gt; because they don&#39;t respect me. I feel they do respect me, just don&#39;t<br/>
always<br/>
&gt; &gt; obey. So, how does one show respect? Is disobedience always a sign of<br/>
&gt; &gt; disrespect? I mean the kids do obey, just not right away. I think we<br/>
have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; great amount of respect for one another, but don&#39;t want to be fooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself. I love the various opinions and advice from all of you and thank<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt; for your help in advance. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Today someone will join this list who doesn&#39;t know anything about<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling, or who&#39;s really wanting help NOW, and I think asking people<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; stay on topic and to be fair in their arguments is a good thing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I first started reading, vaccination and circumcision were the hot<br/>
&gt; topics.  And I was glad to see them discussed.  To me, and I think I&#39;ve<br/>
heard<br/>
&gt; it said before, unschooling encompasses just about everything.  There is a<br/>
&gt; general worldview that seems to be shared by many unschoolers that I love.<br/>
&gt; That of questioning, allowing and not limiting.  There are varieties in<br/>
&gt; different areas, bit I don&#39;t want to feel like getting &#39;off topic&#39; is a<br/>
bad<br/>
&gt; thing.  Again, I&#39;m a competent adult, and if I see something I don&#39;t want<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; read, I delete it.  I just subscribed to another homeschooling list and it<br/>
&gt; seems much more dogmatic and not what I&#39;m interested in, but I&#39;m giving it<br/>
&gt; some time....I might get something out of it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wondering if the heat is just really getting to everyone.  It was nice<br/>
&gt; and fall like here for a week or so, then the humidity came back. I&#39;m<br/>
ready<br/>
&gt; for the cold weather.:-)<br/>

&gt; I thought that was perfect! I&#39;ve gotten comments and looks from my<br/>
extended<br/>
&gt; family as well.  I know a lot of people who think discipline is the most<br/>
&gt; important family value.<br/>
&gt; I respect a lot of people but I don&#39;t always do what they want when they<br/>
&gt; want.  People are always so amazed when my son is so polite in asking for<br/>
&gt; things and saying thank you. I&#39;ve always spoke to him that way. In fact I<br/>
&gt; never &#39;taught&#39; him to be polite.  But there was a very recent time when my<br/>

&gt;  &lt;&lt; At first I didn&#39;t understand this poster&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; writing style but reading<br/>
&gt; &gt; the archieves has cleared up that question--once a<br/>

&gt; &gt; This list is supposed to be for unschoolers to<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m a new unschooler - and not real experienced with<br/>
&gt; the internet either.  I really don&#39;t think you have to<br/>
&gt; worry about someone not being able to find other<br/>
&gt; resources, if they were able to subscribe and post<br/>
&gt; here - they&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;ve been to *homeschooling*<br/>
&gt; message board that make these discussions look like a<br/>
&gt; Sunday School lesson on &#39;be kind to your neighbor&#39;. (I<br/>
&gt; was afraid to post!) Also, most of the topics are<br/>
&gt; interesting to me, they don&#39;t need to center solely on<br/>
&gt; unschooling- everything is part of our lives, and I<br/>
&gt; just skim over & delete the ones that aren&#39;t currently<br/>
&gt; of interest to me.<br/>

&gt; I agree Brenda...<br/>
&gt; I use the delete key for anything that just doesn&#39;t seem relevant to me.<br/>
&gt; BUT....it is usually relevant to others, and that&#39;s what life and<br/>
unschooling is<br/>
&gt; all about.<br/>
&gt; Thanks for saying so nicely.<br/>
&gt; There are lots of times I don&#39;t agree with the opinions expressed, but<br/>
still<br/>
&gt; everyone has an opinion, and everyone can express it...I&#39;m not going to<br/>

&gt; Our experience was when we went to pick up two yearling Arab fillies and<br/>
&gt; were coming back over the pass.  I know it is only about 10,000 feet at<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; summit but I&#39;m sure it is really 10 MILLION feet down &lt;g&gt;  For those that<br/>
&gt; have never been there, you come up and then it is like someone cut the top<br/>
&gt; off and the road is instantly flat so you don&#39;t really see what might be<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; front of you.  There was a gal parked right smack dab in the middle of the<br/>
&gt; road standing by her car.  We had three choices, hit her, the 10 million<br/>
&gt; feet down the cliff face or putting the truck into the snow bank on the up<br/>
&gt; side cliff face.  My sister and I were in a panic because the last vehicle<br/>
&gt; we passed was a big rig pulling half a modular home.  All we could picture<br/>
&gt; was horses plastered all over the road.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At any rate, we got the fillies out and up the hill and tied to a couple<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; trees. Then we went to deal with the one taco short of a combination<br/>
plate!<br/>
&gt; Seems she had never driven in the snow before and the black ice scared<br/>
her.<br/>
&gt; O.K., I can deal with that EXCEPT her husband was asleep in the back seat<br/>
&gt; and she didn&#39;t want to wake him up because he really needed the sleep!<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t know who was more peeved at her, us or him.  When he asked her why<br/>
she<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t wake him up (not in those words &lt;g&gt;), she said &quot;But you look so<br/>
sweet<br/>
&gt; and peaceful.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Grrrr, did I mention one guy had already gone off the road?  We luckily<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; a winch on the truck to pull him back up the hill!  Oh, and the truck with<br/>
&gt; the modular had pulled off so the driver could take 10.<br/>

&gt; &gt; we are very far from parker but, also very familiar with it<br/>
&gt; &gt; funny thing about the passes here, most Colorado drivers don&#39;t have any<br/>
&gt; problems but out of state vehicles are more sluggish, has to do with air<br/>
&gt; mixture I think<br/>
&gt; &gt; we have family in Iowa and are car runs much faster there<br/>
&gt; &gt; I no what you mean about everyone being cousins or related<br/>
&gt; &gt; ditto here<br/>

&gt; &gt;   Well, we are on the coast.  You can see the Pacific Ocean from my<br/>
&gt; upstairs<br/>
&gt; &gt;   window.  Almost everyone knows everyone else or is someone&#39;s cousin<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;   population number has been static since the 60s, so there is a real<br/>
&gt; small<br/>
&gt; &gt;   town feel to it.  There are about 130,000 in this county which<br/>
&gt; encompasses<br/>
&gt; &gt;   2.3 million acres which is about the size of 2 Delewares, 1 Rhode<br/>
Island<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;   the District of Columbia combined, if I remember my land masses<br/>
&gt; correctly.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Are you anywhere near Parker?  We hauled Arabs to a ranch there once<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt;   made the mistake of driving over Rabbit Ears Pass in October &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; make<br/>
&gt; &gt;   that mistake again!<br/>

&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;you can&#39;t get any further west, at<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; least not in the 48 states, than I am and I think at around 26,000<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt;   town<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; qualifies as small.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; how far west?<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; we are in western colorado near utah<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; as for small i believe their are 216 persons in this town<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; 28,ooo in the county<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; it is many miles larger than the county we moved from<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; denver metro area 128,000<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; May I calmly suggest that in many cases--at least where I<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You certainly may! *G* My family is all Southern. We don&#39;t shout in<br/>
&gt; &gt; anger. Oh, we yell with the best of &#39;em to be heard over noise or<br/>
&gt; &gt; whatever, but anger...well, we get quiet, and EXTREMELY polite. My son<br/>
&gt; &gt; reflects this too. Yesterday I stepped on his Voltron toy, breaking part<br/>
&gt; &gt; of it and he looks at me, flushed, eyes snapping and in a tiny, quiet<br/>
&gt; &gt; little voice &quot;Mother, I would realy prefer you don&#39;t step on my toys and<br/>
&gt; &gt; break tem please. Do you think you could replace my green lion?&quot; He<br/>
&gt; &gt; sounded just LIKE me. So we went shopping for a new Voltron today and<br/>
&gt; &gt; had a lovely unschooling lesson in comparative pricing and monetary<br/>

&gt; Well, I can relate to that! :-) But also at &#39;that time&#39; I am on the prowl<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; chocolate, lol.<br/>
&gt; My best remedies have been eliminating dietary yucks and lots and lots of<br/>
&gt; water. I know lots of different people have views on acne, diet, stress,<br/>
&gt; condition, etc. I think for me it&#39;s different things at different times.<br/>
&gt; Stress also kicks it off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There was a time where I was breastfeeding, vegan, drinking tons of water,<br/>
&gt; doing yoga almost daily and getting massage once a week (I was in school<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; it, it was free :-)). During that period I had no skin problems<br/>
whatsoever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just thought I&#39;d share...good luck!<br/>

&gt; Subject: New to unschooling....HELP<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;            Hello all!  I have visited unschooling.com numerous times<br/>
&gt; and I just signed on to the loop. Here&#39;s a brief backgound....<br/>
&gt;    Although I have been reading John Holt for years this is my first<br/>
&gt; step to unschool my children. We have three kids, Zach (9), Drew (6),<br/>
&gt; and Chloe (who has always been unschooled...4 yrs.) Well, the boys<br/>
&gt; were excited to be &quot;homeschooled&quot; this year and Thursday August 30th<br/>
&gt; was spent at a park day for all the homeschoolers/unschoolers in our<br/>
&gt; area. A few days have passed now and my oldest faces me today and<br/>
&gt; loudly announces that I have not taught him A THING and how is he<br/>
&gt; supposed to learn!!!?? So, I say quite calmly, well what would you<br/>
&gt; like to learn?? He gets quite angry at my reponse and replies, &quot;I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know! You are just supposed to be teaching me something! I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t just watch T.V. all day!&quot; LOL I laugh because my oldest is my<br/>
&gt; most television addicted child. I respond, &quot;anything you want to do<br/>
&gt; is fine with me...math, science, play a game, anything.&quot; He walked<br/>
&gt; away in a huff.  A short time later he did bring out a game and we<br/>
&gt; all played. I could tell he was still very bothered by my lack<br/>
&gt; of &quot;formal lessons&quot; and after the game was finished I brought out his<br/>
&gt; math book from the last school year. I showed him the book and<br/>
&gt; explained to him that the work inside was extremely easy (it is far<br/>
&gt; below his abilities) and he agreed. I then showed him that out of an<br/>
&gt; entire year the book had not even been halfway completed. I pointed<br/>
&gt; out that I felt if he wanted to do it he could sit and complete the<br/>
&gt; entire book in a day or two. He wouldn&#39;t have to wait for the teacher<br/>
&gt; or for kids who did not understand, etc..  He kind of laughed in<br/>
&gt; agreement with me. He did not, and I did not expect him to, work in<br/>
&gt; the book but helped put the game away and went back to the T.V.<br/>
&gt;     I can tell he does not grasp what I am explaining fully. He still<br/>
&gt; does not understand why I am not sitting down and &quot;teaching&quot; him.<br/>
&gt; Is &quot;unschooling&quot; a philosphy that I should sit and explain to him in<br/>
&gt; detail?  I have made numerous points to him but never totally and<br/>
&gt; completely explained. The funny thing is I expected him to be<br/>
&gt; thrilled by the fact that he was not going to be made to &quot;work&quot; and<br/>
&gt; instead his reaction caught me totally offguard!! I really should<br/>
&gt; have known better!!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    By the way....the television is somewhat of a problem. My husband<br/>
&gt; will not let me take it out of the house, which is what I want to do!<br/>
&gt; My son CAN sit in front of that thing for hours if I were to let him<br/>
&gt; and I almost feel he has been doing just that for the past couple<br/>
&gt; days as a silent protest against my method of &quot;instruction.&quot; He did<br/>
&gt; not watch much television over the summer and now he cannot seem to<br/>
&gt; be able to shut it off. Of course, it may be that all of his<br/>
&gt; neighborhood friends have gone off to school. For the time being<br/>
&gt; should I plan lots of activity in the home...experiments, read<br/>
&gt; outloud time, playing games, etc...my car is broken down and won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; ready for a least a week. Some unschoolers believe that I should just<br/>
&gt; let boredom take it&#39;s toll and let the kids lead the activity when<br/>
&gt; they are ready.  Any thoughts on this??????<br/>
&gt;             Thank you all...I would appreciate ANY input!<br/>
&gt;                            Tara<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; It was very comforting and nice to read Mary welcome me into the<br/>
&gt; list. I know that many more of you there have said a silent<br/>
&gt; welcome to my self introduction.  I just wanted to know how much<br/>
&gt; it meant to me. It is still hard not to hear the voice deep<br/>
&gt; inside me saying that I am not a native English speaker/writer<br/>
&gt; and that I am exposing myself publicly. The complex of having<br/>
&gt; been born in in-development-country is still here.  I know that<br/>
&gt; it does not count.  But it is here...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you for your encouragement and caring!<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;not point out to him all the learning he does when he is building entire<br/>

&gt;designs cities etc... he so far does not see that as learning.. and i told<br/>
&gt;him that he is actually lucky to have been able to be with his dad when he<br/>
&gt;tore down an entire old barn.. and now they are rebuilding a barn on our<br/>
&gt;land with the materials .. he also does not see that as learning.. so with<br/>
&gt;this kid i guess i will continue to print off pages for him to do untill he<br/>
&gt;gets sick of it maybe???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe you could translate some of the learning you know he&#39;s done into <br/>
educationese and show that to him.  Also maybe find him some info on what <br/>
it takes to become a city planner or architect, since he seems interested <br/>
in those kinds of things.<br/>

ps When you reply to the digest, it&#39;s considerate to delete all but what <br/>
you&#39;re replying to.  (Actually that&#39;s true for any reply.)  Also changing <br/>
the subject line helps people see whether it&#39;s something they&#39;re interested in.<br/>
