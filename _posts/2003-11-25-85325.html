<div id="ygrps-yiv-178362553">The other night, when my dd 2yrs old was sick and needed to nurse non stop, <br/>
my ds and I put on the movie &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;. It was his first time <br/>
watching it. We had such a good time, he noticed so many things about that movie <br/>
that I never thought he would get. He  talked to me through the whole movie and I <br/>
loved him doing it, we really shared it. I would never have thought to do <br/>
that before reading at this list, I would have just immersed myself in guilt for <br/>
watching the idiot box, but instead we reveled in a shared experienced. <br/>
On top of all that, I got to see Kevin Costner&#39;s bare bum again!!!!!!&lt;/Grin&gt;<br/>
