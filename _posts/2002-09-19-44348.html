<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485908922">**And read John Holt&#39;s &quot;Never too Late&quot; about him teaching himself violin.**<br/>
<br/>
cello  :)  And it&#39;s not about teaching himself - he hired teachers at every <br/>
step, it&#39;s about the process of learning to play an instrument at an <br/>
&quot;advanced age&quot; just for the joy of it, about the learner being in charge of <br/>
the learning, about choosing teachers who support the vision of the learner <br/>
instead of imposing their own, about the idea of making music instead of <br/>
practicing. <br/>
