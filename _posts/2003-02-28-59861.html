<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667377261">Hello! My name is Emily, mother to one 18 month old daughter Serenity. We<br/>
live in rural Humboldt County in Northern CA and love it! I feel very<br/>
committed to be(come)ing an unschooling family--because the public schhols<br/>
here are all at least 45mins away and very poor and I had a negative<br/>
experience as a child in them, but mostly because it sounds like SUCH fun,<br/>
and such a way to be close, and just basically in alignment with all my<br/>
deeper beliefs...<br/>
    Maybe I&#39;m just a worrier, but its amazing how much pressure/disapproval<br/>
around home/unschooling I&#39;m already struggling with (from Serenity&#39;s<br/>
grandparents, a few nearby moms I&#39;ve made friends with that I are planning<br/>
to public school). So my ? is...<br/>
<br/>
How do you stay strong in your beliefs and committment to unschooling  in<br/>
the face of disapproval?<br/>
<br/>
Do you fear that your chil will someday resent your descision not to put<br/>
them in school like &quot;normal&quot; kids? What do you do with that?<br/>
<br/>
I feel worried by this notion that even though I see that unschooling will<br/>
be vastly superior to public schooling, is it really ok to make such a big<br/>
decision for someone else? I&#39;ve thought that at age 5 I could have her try a<br/>
few days of school and make the choice herself--but what if she wanted to<br/>
attend? I would hate that, and worry about her so much? Maybe at age 8 or 10<br/>
this would feel like a safer plan to me, but then what do I do about all the<br/>
&quot;So, who&#39;s your kindergarter teacher&quot;comments from well-meaning people at<br/>
age 5?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I&#39;m just seeking some moral support...Thank you all for this amazing<br/>
list and in advance for any words of wisdom!  ;)  Emily</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777897000">Hi Emily,<br/>
I surround myself with people who support me and trust me or opt to be<br/>
alone.  If someone doesn&#39;t think that I know what is best for me and my<br/>
family, to heck with them.   They can find someone else to torment.  I don&#39;t<br/>
mind honest questions from people who are really trying to understand what<br/>
we do and why we do it, but I will not tolerate someone expressing their<br/>
dissaproval of unschooling esp. in front of my kids, when they haven&#39;t even<br/>
researched it.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think my kids will resent being unschooled.  I can&#39;t imagine it.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t had to face having a child want to go to school.  My kids are a lot<br/>
like me and my dh and I would be surprised if they wanted to.  I would try<br/>
very hard to figure out another way to meet whatever need they had that they<br/>
felt school would solve, before sending them off.  I also think 5 is kind of<br/>
young to make that choice.  They can&#39;t understand all the consequences of<br/>
their choice yet.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you stay strong in your beliefs and commitment to unschooling in<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>     I allow the *end* to justify the *means* with the nay-sayers.  My kids <br/>
spend lots of time around their peers, both schooled traditionally or <br/>
schooled at home (we&#39;ve few unschooling friends IRL).  I can see *quite <br/>
obvious* to me, that my children are not lacking in any area.  I have faith, <br/>
more faith than I ever thought existed, in my children&#39;s desire for knowledge <br/>
and in my own ability to have it available to them.  Just when I&#39;m down on <br/>
myself, i.e., schooled kindergartners reciting a book and calling it reading <br/>
when Hannah is more than happy to let me read to her forever ~ maybe I <br/>
*should* sit down with 100 Lessons, or go thru this phonics schtuff &lt;retch!&gt; <br/>
just so she can *read* ~ poof! she picks up a book and starts to read!!  My <br/>
kids can talk to you about braintumors, short term memory loss, radiation, <br/>
chemotherapy, alternatives to Western medicine, death, adoption ... oh so <br/>
many millions of topics their peers have never thought of... Why? because I <br/>
*talk* to them.  I&#39;m Mrs. Rogers most days ~ I&#39;m inspired by what I see and I <br/>
allow them to be too.  When my methods are questioned, I always return the <br/>
question ~ where are they lacking??  They&#39;re great kids, I haven&#39;t yet gotten <br/>
a satisfactory response from anyone.  (I used this for almost every freaky <br/>
parenting decision I&#39;ve made, from no-circ to no vax to extended, on demand <br/>
breastfeeding to delaying solids ... unschooling has just confirmed my place <br/>
in the family&#39;s *Freak Hall of Fame*) <br/>
Wow! That was a long response :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you fear that your child will someday resent your decision not to put<br/>
&gt; them in school like &quot;normal&quot; kids? What do you do with that?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>     Hannah has asked to go to school.  There is *no* way I&#39;m subjecting her <br/>
to that situation so young, 6.5.  I&#39;ve inquired about what she *thinks* she&#39;s <br/>
missing.  She first talked of recess.  I told her I would happily send her <br/>
into the backyard everyday for 15 minutes for compulsory play time.  Then I <br/>
realized she was just lonely (we just moved here 7 months ago) ... I added <br/>
more socialization into our life.  I asked about *doing school* does she want <br/>
me to sit down with her everyday and have lessons?  NO! She likes learning <br/>
this way ... it wasn&#39;t more than a few days after this initial conversation <br/>
that we were driving and she wished that she and Hayden were twins, so they <br/>
could do everything together; thanks for not making me go to school mom, I <br/>
would really miss my brother and he would miss me.  This led to a great <br/>
conversation between the three of us about how important it is to have a <br/>
loving, trusting family, how lucky we are to have each other and have this <br/>
opportunity to be together all the time and learn from each other every day.  <br/>
Will she resent the decision later?  I certainly hope not ... we all have <br/>
ideas about what we may or may not have missed out on in our lives, I only <br/>
want her sent out into the world *KNOWING* that her mommy did her very best.  <br/>
Right now, this is the best I know... <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535988621"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hello! My name is Emily, mother to one 18 month old daughter <br/>
&gt; Serenity. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Welcome Emily, and it&#39;s great that you are thinking about this stuff<br/>
while your child is so young. I have 3yo and 5yo daughters, and both are<br/>
unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you stay strong in your beliefs and committment to <br/>
&gt; unschooling  in the face of disapproval?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You be honest with yourself and stick by your convictions. If you are<br/>
doing something you don&#39;t believe in to pacify your family or friends,<br/>
you are doing a great disservice to yourself and your children. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you fear that your chil will someday resent your descision not to <br/>
&gt; put them in school like &quot;normal&quot; kids? What do you do with that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you resent your parents for the negative experiences you had while a<br/>
child in public school? You do the best you can to love, listen, nurture<br/>
and connect with your children. There are always options if you seem some<br/>
resentment brewing, and there is nothing I can think of that a child can<br/>
get from school that she can&#39;t get from a resourceful, caring parent.<br/>
Cross that bridge when (if) you get to it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I feel worried by this notion that even though I see that <br/>
&gt; unschooling will be vastly superior to public schooling, is it really<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ok to make &gt;such  a big decision for someone else?<br/>
<br/>
If you are enrolling her in school, aren&#39;t you also making a big decision<br/>
for her?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve thought that at age 5 I could have  her try a few days of school<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and make &gt;the choice herself--but what if she  wanted to attend?<br/>
<br/>
I would find out why she wanted to go, and try to fix it so she had the<br/>
same experiences, resources, etc. outside of a school setting. I think<br/>
you might be assuming that all children *want* to go to school. 5dd<br/>
wanted to go to school for one reason. She thought the big yellow school<br/>
buses were really cool. My husband bought her a $500 school bus. She has<br/>
never expressed the desire again. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would hate that, and worry about her so much? Maybe at age <br/>
&gt; 8 or 10 this would feel like a safer plan to me, but then what do I do<br/>
 </span></blockquote>about <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; all the &quot;So, who&#39;s your kindergarter teacher&quot;comments from well-meaning<br/>
<br/>
&gt; people at age 5?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my 5yo daughter is asked these kinds of questions she simply says<br/>
&quot;we don&#39;t do that&quot;. Sometimes people ask more, sometimes they don&#39;t. She<br/>
is quite comfortable talking to people of all ages. She does not feel<br/>
deprived, just different. That is OK. If you feel like you are depriving<br/>
your daughter, she will sense that. If you are affording her<br/>
opportunities to live, learn, explore, play, love, have fun, and just<br/>
*be*, then she will sense that too, and grow and bloom all the more for<br/>
it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-896205086">Hi Emily and welcome.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;How do you stay strong in your beliefs and committment to unschooling  in <br/>
&gt;&gt;the face of disapproval?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know it works. I&#39;ve seen it happen. I know this is the best life choice <br/>
for my family. Instead of listening to naysayers, I decided a long time ago <br/>
to turn towards people who have also made the life choices that I have. I <br/>
look towards their words of wisdom and encouragement and turn wawy from <br/>
those people who really don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about in this <br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Do you fear that your child will someday resent your descision not to put <br/>
&gt;&gt;them in school like &quot;normal&quot; kids? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. My kids don&#39;t think of unschooling as something I&#39;m doing to them. They <br/>
enjoy our life and feel bad for the kids who have to endure long school <br/>
days.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I feel worried by this notion that even though I see that unschooling will <br/>
&gt;&gt;be vastly superior to public schooling, is it really ok to make such a big <br/>
&gt;&gt;decision for someone else?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are making decisions for your child each and every day, the school/no <br/>
school decision is no different. Sending her to school would be making a <br/>
HUGE decision that would affect her sense of how the world works.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;ve thought that at age 5 I could have her try a few days of school and <br/>
&gt;&gt;make the choice herself&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it would be helpful to stop parenting your 5 year old child and get <br/>
back to the joy of your beautiful, delightful 18 month old :o) Who knows <br/>
what will happen when she&#39;s 5? Really, we just can&#39;t live in the future. <br/>
Personally, I think that the further you get on this parenting journey, the <br/>
easier it will be to become comfortable in your choices. So, by the time <br/>
she&#39;s 5 you may think it&#39;s silly that you even worried about this. You will <br/>
have been watching her flourish and learn at home and wonder why you ever <br/>
worried that school might be a better choice. Live it, that&#39;s the best way <br/>
to quiet your fears.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;but then what do I do about all the &quot;So, who&#39;s your kindergarter <br/>
&gt;&gt;teacher&quot;comments from well-meaning people at age 5?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are over-thinking this. Eveyone knows about homeschooling these days. <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m homeschooled!&quot; Big smile. :o) That&#39;s always worked here and usually <br/>
develops into an interesting conversation. Wait till your daughter gets a <br/>
little older and then handle the comments as they arise. If YOU are <br/>
confident, happy and excited in your choice, she will be too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Perhaps I&#39;m just seeking some moral support...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots of support here and at unschooling.com. :o) Relax.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-76696968"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; How do you stay strong in your beliefs and committment to <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; unschooling  in<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the face of disapproval?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Keep your focus on your own children and your life with them and not on <br/>
what others think. Listen attentively as long as comments are offered <br/>
with good intent - and don&#39;t argue - be appreciative of the fact that <br/>
these people CARE about your kids and that their concerns really are <br/>
honest concerns and that they just do NOT understand unschooling and it <br/>
may be too much of a stretch for them so they may not be ABLE to <br/>
understand it. Remember that what they are often really saying is that <br/>
they are afraid for your kids and that&#39;s because they care about them.<br/>
(For people who do NOT care about your children, then just dismiss <br/>
their comments with a &quot;thanks for the input&quot; kind of comment - I mean, <br/>
if they don&#39;t CARE about your kids, then why would you care what they <br/>
think?)<br/>
<br/>
The naysayers who do love and care for your kids will often come around <br/>
eventually - as they get a better sense of what you&#39;re really doing - <br/>
when they see that your life is rich and full of great learning <br/>
experiences, even though it doesn&#39;t look like school. You can&#39;t really <br/>
rush it - they often just have to see it to believe it. So you just <br/>
have to be patient and understand that they don&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
If you keep your focus on that, the idea that they are not commenting <br/>
from a position of knowledge and understanding, then you will be able <br/>
to keep your own sense of strength in your decisions. YOU are the one <br/>
who read the books and articles and lists and keeps engaging in <br/>
self-education on this topic -- until they&#39;ve done the same kind of <br/>
self-education, then you really should be able to just remind yourself <br/>
to not be overly concerned with their uninformed (ignorant) opinions.<br/>
