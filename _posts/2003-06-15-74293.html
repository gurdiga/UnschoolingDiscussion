<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623592321">&quot;What about tea parties and manners?  I think this conversation is talking about<br/>
 a little boy, but for little girls who love tea parties, couldn&#39;t that be a<br/>
 neat way to learn manners and have a whole lot of fun doing it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wait a minute.....I&#39;m sure you meant no bias, but why can&#39;t little boys love tea parties too? Mine do!!<br/>
And our tea parties are less about manners (I don&#39;t recall ever using that word!! :) and more about slurping tea, laughing and having fun! The focus is which tea cup you&#39;re going to use and what kind of tea will be made. THAT is a tea party in my book...not &quot;proper&quot; manners.<br/>
<br/>
I am working on an article which (kinda, sorta) is about tea parties and such. But manners weren&#39;t part of it as I recall.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116770520">Recall the tea in Mary Poppins.  Margaux loves this scene with everyone floating about drinking tea and Mary Poppins lovingly scolding them for the nonsense... don&#39;t slouch.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL I picked something up at girlscout camp as a kid, about no <br/>
elbows, because there are fairies on the table, and putting your <br/>
elbows on the table squishes them.<br/>
<br/>
So, I related this to the kids, trying to get them to keep their <br/>
elbows off the table, and it has evolved to a COMPLETE joke: Them <br/>
hollering &quot;Death to Table Fairies!&quot; while they rap the table with <br/>
their elbows, let alone propping them there! LOL<br/>
<br/>
Death to Table Fairies! hee hee<br/>
