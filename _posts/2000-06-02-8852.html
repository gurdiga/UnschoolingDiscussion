<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097166086">I have a question.  How do you and your kids respond to the question, &quot;So when are <br/>
you done with school?&quot;  This is our first year of homeschooling and halfway through <br/>
we switched to unschooling.  So I guess we are always done with school, but never <br/>
done with learning, but that just doesn&#39;t sound right.  <br/>
<br/>
What do you say?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;done with learning, but that just doesn&#39;t sound right.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it sounds great!  <br/>
<br/>
Another one that I get asked is, &quot;Doesn&#39;t homeschooling take a lot of your<br/>
time?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My answer is that it takes none of my time and all of my time.  I explain<br/>
that I don&#39;t do school, so I don&#39;t spend any time *teaching*, but that I&#39;m<br/>
always on duty to explain things and seek out things my son might be<br/>
interested in.<br/>

&quot;Just as eating against one&#39;s will is injurious to health, so study without<br/>
a liking for it spoils the memory, and it retains nothing it takes in.&quot;<br/>
