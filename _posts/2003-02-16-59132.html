&gt; Do you stay up with them and actively participate in their activities <br/>

&gt; schedule.  In bed between 9 and 10, and up at 5 for work.  I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; noticed that when the kids are playing by themselves and I&#39;m doing my <br/>
&gt; own thing, they&#39;re much more likely to be loud and wake up dh.  When <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m actively playing with them, they are much more likely to be quiet <br/>
&gt; enough. My presence tends to keep things more quiet and them less <br/>
&gt; likely to fight loudly with each other.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I have tried that.  There are a few &quot;logistical&quot; challanges though.. For <br/>
one thing, I also have to get up fairly early... 7am, to take Landon to <br/>
school.   So, when it gets on past midnight, I just cant stay awake.  Also, <br/>
Dh is not too keen on &quot;not&quot; having me in bed with him...we get very little <br/>
time alone..  Not just for sex, just for &quot;being together&quot;.   The other( <br/>
bigger) problem is that the kids bedroom is adjacent to ours.  Thier TV and <br/>
game systems are in there.. THATS what they want to do.   The TV downstairs <br/>
is broken ( Ethan broke the on/off switch), so theres really  nothing for <br/>
them to do downstairs ( that they want to do)     I&#39;ve suggested me reading <br/>
to them, playing cards or board games, etc.. No, they want to either watch TV <br/>
or more often, play games.    That would be OK.. but even my presence and <br/>
interaction does not keep them quiet enough for Dh to sleep .     I suggested <br/>
moving thier TV&#39;/system downstairs,  but they would much rather have it in <br/>
thier rooms... Taking it back and forth every night is too much trouble.. <br/>
<br/>
Some folks suggested that since the kids are not respecting thier dads need <br/>
to sleep, then go ahead and have then turn the stuff off at 10.   Thats what <br/>
we&#39;ve been doing.   They can play, but when they start getting loud, its has <br/>
to go off..  Then they lie in bed and fuss and argue and expend the rest of <br/>
their high energy for another hour or so.   JP usually bed hops several times <br/>
before he gets settled.   See, the thing is.. before we started <br/>
homeschooling, I got them up at 7am.  Then with thier long, busy ( stressful) <br/>
days of school, they were ready to go to sleep by 10.   Actually, we never <br/>
had a bedtime rule before when they went to school.   Thier being asleep by <br/>
10 was a natural occurence because of thier schedules.  Well, they stopped <br/>
going to school, I dont get them up in the mornings, they sleep sometimes til <br/>
11 am.. so, of course, they are not sleepy by 10 pm at night.   The few days <br/>
that we have had early activities, it was HELL getting them up ( the boys <br/>
that is).. These were fun things they wanted to do, but they were just so <br/>
tired.   And an occasional early morning have to get up disruption in thier <br/>
sleep pattern has not helped alter it back to earlier to bed, earlier to <br/>
rise.    I will say, they ARE getting better.. But, I think its because they <br/>
now know that if they start getting too loud, the stuff goes off.   I know <br/>
that is not unschooling, but it&#39;s been the only solution that has &quot;semi&quot; <br/>
worked.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re saying &quot;I know that is not unschooling,&quot; but others have said more <br/>
than once that it&#39;s not unschooling to just leave them up without the basis <br/>
for it.<br/>
<br/>
Wake them up at 7:00 if it&#39;s important that they&#39;re sleepy by ten.  Since you <br/>
have considerations that make bedtime flexibility impractical, stick with <br/>
bedtimes. You have a real reason for it, it&#39;s not just abitrary control stuff.<br/>
<br/>
During the depression, people made their kids eat lima beans for good reason.<br/>
Now if someone forced kids to eat lima beans, it would just be sadistic. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
(Apologies to anyone who chooses lima beans as one of their first choices!)<br/>
<br/>
If people have the luxury and flexibility to give their kids more freedoms, <br/>
that can be really helpful to unschooling.  If not, fine.<br/>

the sole bread winner. His needs come first on this issue.  But we don&#39;t <br/>

being louder than dad can sleep through. We try not to blame. It&#39;s just a <br/>
fact. After a few months we no longer had to remind him. He has a good <br/>
understanding of what &quot;quiet enough for dad&quot; means.<br/>

I don&#39;t see this as an unschooling issue. You sound like you want to <br/>
unschool and also be a less coercive parent. Two different parts of <br/>
parenting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For me, I had to grasp the non-coercive parenting part before I could <br/>
become a better unschooler.  I see them as going hand in hand.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been concentrating on keeping things peaceful, happy, and <br/>
healthy (physically and emotionally).  I figure that those things <br/>
need to be present in order for my kids to function and learn at <br/>
their best.  When those things are present, their minds are clearer <br/>
and unschooling is much more effective.  <br/>
