ME:   I think punishments are wrong (morally) and also counterproductive.   I think rewards are counterproductive if  you are (a) trying to influence future behavior by the reward and (b) want the future behavior to be intrinsically rewarding.  I don&#39;t see how your example fits either criterion.   If you wanted Billy to go to the concert for Billy&#39;s sake, then I think the reward would be counterproductive.<br/>
<br/>
In real life, though, I&#39;d try my best to just find Billy another place to be, rather than be in the position of  being the one causing him to do something that he didn&#39;t like for money.   <br/>
<br/>
I found this part of the discussion to be an interesting tangent.   Too bad it isn&#39;t a real example, since made-up examples seem less worthwhile of discussion to me.  I am now curious about how people feel about/treat  rewards/incentive in  similar situations. <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve bribed kids.<br/>
But the simplest bribe of all probably goes back to cave man days.  &quot;I&#39;ll get <br/>
you food!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then it might&#39;ve been &quot;We can stop by the ravine where the berries are&quot; and <br/>
now it&#39;s &quot;I&#39;ll take you to Burger King on the way back.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kids have bribed me.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps bribe is too strong a word.  <br/>
<br/>
If we go to visit Keith&#39;s parents next month, we&#39;re going to White Sands and <br/>
Carlsbad Caverns too.  It&#39;s to sweeten the idea of driving to southern New <br/>
Mexico when it&#39;s hot.  Just to see grandma makes it a long, harsh trip.  Grandma, <br/>
a hotel with a water slide, Carlsbad Caverns...   <br/>
That&#39;s better.<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;re not trying to train them to go to grandmas.  They would go without <br/>
the sweetener, but it will be sweeter for all concerned WITH the frosting.<br/>
<br/>
(And what that has to do with transcripts, I will suggest, is nothing <br/>
whatsoever.)<br/>

Actually it was a real example used on this lis many times in the past.<br/>
Sorry, I should have said that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Last week i offered Seamus $20 in cold hard cash if he would kill the <br/>
GIANT centipede on the wall. We&#39;d been running around the room <br/>
screaming &quot;you kill it!&quot; &quot;No, YOU kill it!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m not killing it YOU <br/>
kill it&quot;...I am extremely phobic of anything will lots of legs (have <br/>
just about mastered my fear of most spiders, but this centipede was <br/>
huuuuuge, and dark, and had really loooong legs!)and was practically <br/>
hyperventilating in the kitchen. My poor mother was stuck in her <br/>
wheelchair in the hallway at 1am cuz the creature was in her room and <br/>
i couldnt put her to bed with it in there...<br/>
<br/>
In the end, Seamus ended up throwing a shoe at it, which of course <br/>
only startled it and had no fatal effect...he lost out on his $20 <br/>
bribe and we had to spend the next two days there with the horrible <br/>
knowledge that a monster still lurks in the shadows of my mother&#39;s <br/>
house...<br/>
<br/>
i shudder just remembering it.....<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, i will bribe in certain circumstances, but not for stuff <br/>
like &quot;chores&quot; and other stuff.<br/>

-----------------<br/>
<br/>
Darn, I wish I&#39;d been there.  Not for the $20; I don&#39;t mean that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
  I can do bugs.  I killed a black widow spider tonight, out in the yard, <br/>
that Holly had found.<br/>
<br/>
If you can or want to do a &quot;bug bomb,&quot; the kind of can you set and stay out <br/>
of the house for several hours, it might not killl the centipede, but it will <br/>
come out and be stunned on the floor, at least.  Then you can get it in a jar <br/>
and take it outside, put it on the sidewalk and set a brick on it or something. <br/>
<br/>
We bug-bombed a two-room old adobe house my mom was living in for a while, <br/>
years ago.  Lots of spiders died.  Centipedes were still moving, but not much. <br/>
They had come out to get some air, sothey weren&#39;t hiding either.<br/>

If Seamus could have said &quot;no&quot;, of course.<br/>
<br/>
I think bribery doesn&#39;t bring out the best in people.<br/>
