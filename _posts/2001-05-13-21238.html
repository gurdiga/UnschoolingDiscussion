<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496099366">Also, I had a neighbor whose son used to hold his<br/>
bowel movements<br/>
from fear and it caused damage inside ... he now will<br/>
mess his pants<br/>
(at 11) and not even know he has to go - awake or<br/>
asleep - how horrifying!<br/>
Her doc said it is because he held it so much it<br/>
damaged internally and<br/>
they need to do surgery at 12 if it doesn&#39;t correct<br/>
itself by then :(<br/>
Poor lil guy ...<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, unbeknownst to the good doc there is a<br/>
control issue or some sort going on.  The child looses<br/>
control of something basic because he has to maintain<br/>
control in some other intolerable area. (such as<br/>
hiding an alcoholic parent).  This is an example, not<br/>
an accusation.  I have observed this behavior first<br/>
hand.  When the secret is out, whatever it is, and the<br/>
child no longer feels he has to be &quot;in control&quot; all<br/>
the time, the secondary problem, elimination in<br/>
appropriate circumstances, resolves itself. And a<br/>
caring adult can do wonders to help get rid of  the<br/>
shame. <br/>
<br/>
Another source or fecal incontinence in older children<br/>
and adults is damage to the back and/or nerves, such<br/>
as slipped disk or injury in the 4th and 5th vertebra<br/>
or multiple sclerosis. <br/>
<br/>
??????there may be circumstances which noone outside<br/>
of that family was aware.<br/>
<br/>
A stretched anal sphincter or punitive use of hot<br/>
sauces can mimic this sort of disorder, too.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to imagine a child damaging himself so<br/>
badly , even with voluntary constipation.  A caring<br/>
parent can resolve that LONG before any real injury<br/>
takes place. Then again, I&#39;m not in that family and<br/>
don&#39;t really know their dynamics.  Perhaps the parents<br/>
really couldn&#39;t help their child becuase????<br/>
<br/>
Poor Baby!! He NEEDS some real help soon.  NOW.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-724628558">I have to respond to this one, because my dd also had severe troubles <br/>
for a year with her bowels. She was doing wonderful potty-training at <br/>
about 2.5 yrs old. But then all of a sudden she stopped going poop in <br/>
the potty. Held it forever, then would cry and cry when she had to <br/>
go. My dh and I were going crazy. Nothing seemed to work. Even took <br/>
her to emergency room one day because she was in such pain. To make a <br/>
long story short, ended up seeing a specialist. She gave me the best <br/>
advise ever. Started giving her 2 tablespoons of mineral oil a day. <br/>
Coats her insides with out any side effects (ok, just one.. she could <br/>
no longer hold her poops inside when she wanted to.) Put her back <br/>
into diapers because the poop would also start coming out orange in <br/>
color and ruining her pants. It took a while, but I am very happy to <br/>
say that she is 6 and does not have any more problems and no <br/>
permanent damage. When she feels that her bowel movements are getting <br/>
hard to come out, she tells me and she will take the mineral oil on <br/>
her own (one quick swallow). By the next day, she is fine again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-799630427">Hi all...<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m behind in responding to this...but, you<br/>
know how it is. Anyway, I, too, just had to respond to<br/>
this, because, as a child, I did this very same thing.<br/>
From the time I was very small, until about 11, I went<br/>
through periods where I refused to go for weeks. At<br/>
the time, it seemed like a fear thing. I was just too<br/>
afraid. I finally talked about in therapy, only a few<br/>
years ago, and I think that it is connected to a fear<br/>
of verbal expression, which I still have. The<br/>
emotional and, sometimes even the physical feelings<br/>
are the same. I sympathize...my mom must have been<br/>
going out of her mind...it took me until adulthood to<br/>
realize the damage I could have done to<br/>
myself...sometimes I still wonder if someday I&#39;ll be<br/>
diagnosed with colon cancer or something.<br/>
Anyway....I&#39;d be happy to talk privately about this,<br/>
if you want. <br/>
<br/>
Peace, Gina<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239117779">ooops.......I wrote a REPLY to the following quote. I<br/>
didn&#39;t write that letter....sorry if there is<br/>
confusion.  The children I have had contact with that<br/>
expressed as fecal retention did not have any<br/>
permanent physical damage. But that may be because<br/>
there was sympathetic intervention before that could<br/>
occur.<br/>
