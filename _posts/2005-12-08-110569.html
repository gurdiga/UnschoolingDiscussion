<div id="ygrps-yiv-505212327">&quot;Everyone<br/>
needs that down time, and sometimes its their moods that enlighten me<br/>
to realize...hey we&#39;ve been pretty busy this week...we need a break.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jalen has a very hard time if we&#39;ve had an overly stimulating day, <br/>
or week. A day after can mean waking up angry at everyone, screaming <br/>
demands and being generally unpleasant. Sometimes he even wakes in <br/>
the night, screaming and crying, but nothing helps other than <br/>
holding him and waiting it out.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, if I get the other kids situated with something they <br/>
enjoy, I can take him all alone and rub his back, cuddle, feed him, <br/>
read some books and the rest of the day gets better...not always.<br/>
<br/>
Some days seem more like trying to run distraction constantly. <br/>
Getting him alone is the best &quot;medicine&quot;, but it doesn&#39;t always <br/>
solve the day.<br/>
There are children that are more intense than others, I try to look <br/>
at them as moments, but some days I&#39;m fairly exhausted by the end of <br/>
the day.:)<br/>
<br/>
It gets better and better as he gets older.  When he was three, I <br/>
spent most all of my energy being present for him and trying to give <br/>
the  other kids attention....it gets easier, I promise.<br/>
