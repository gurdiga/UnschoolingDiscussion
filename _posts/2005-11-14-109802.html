<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532223538">**Off to buy kool-aid just in case...**<br/>
<br/>
One of the mostly useless bits of information I have stored away is the date <br/>
of the Jonestown suicides. November 18, 1978. I remember because for years and <br/>
years and YEARS I would hear on the radio sometime during the day on my <br/>
birthday &quot;And on this date in 1978 Jim Jones...&quot;. Oh and I probably wouldn&#39;t <br/>
remember the 1978 part except that my oldest son was about six months old then and I <br/>
remember walking around carrying him thinking of all those children.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if my youngest kids would get the kool-aid reference? <br/>
