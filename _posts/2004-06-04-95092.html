<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have a severe food allergy - peanuts.  My five and four year old know how <br/>
to read the word peanut, but wont eat anything unless they have cleared it <br/>
with me.  They understand the impact to their health.  We keep all nuts out of <br/>
the house and inspect everything we eat elsewhere.  To me, that&#39;s no more <br/>
restricting than putting yourself between your child and a car headed right towards <br/>
him or her.  I don&#39;t think life threatening allergies are really part of a <br/>
discussion about limiting food choices.<br/>
<br/>
We also have food allergies that are not severe.  Highly processed corn (corn <br/>
syrup, corn starch) give my kids eczema.  It might be the chemicals they use. <br/>
 They understand what happens to them, but will choose a little itching over <br/>
a lollipop most times.  They will also get tired of the lollipop after a while <br/>
and stop licking it.<br/>
<br/>
We also have reactions to food coloring (and sometimes flavoring), it makes <br/>
the kids feel yucky, on-edge.  It gives my husband a headache.  We offer them <br/>
choices in the home that wont make them feel this way.  Any place outside the <br/>
house, they make their own choices.  They know how something makes them feel, <br/>
for the most part.  They wont drink fruit punch, for instance because of how it <br/>
makes them feel.  (and the resulting eczema most of the time.)  Most <br/>
unfamiliar foods they stay away from because of the allergies.<br/>
<br/>
We strive to make none of our food making decisions judgemental.  The baggage <br/>
of our own childhoods can make this difficult at times.  It can be a struggle <br/>
to think of food as just food and not &quot;good&quot; food or &quot;bad&quot; food.  We let them <br/>
make their choices for all meals.  My daughter mostly eats apples with <br/>
soybean butter and my son eats pepperoni, hot dogs, toast and fruit of all sorts.  <br/>
They are happy and healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.  For what it&#39;s worth, the baby seems to react to a lot of <br/>
foods I eat, so he may have some of the same allergies as my other two.<br/>
