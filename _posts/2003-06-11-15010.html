&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe you can have us! My in-laws live in Columbia, MO and I&#39;m always<br/>
&gt; looking for something to do while we&#39;re there (besides talk to them, ich).<br/>
&gt; My son, who is 9, would be entranced with your animals. How far are you<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Paula.. Shoot..I&#39;m sure we are too far away..I have yet to talk face to<br/>
face with another unschooler! We are way in the SE corner of the State..in<br/>
the Bootheel area almost. I&#39;d guess about 6 hours from Columbia..(2 hours<br/>
South of St Louis)...but you and your son would be most welcome to visit!<br/>

buddy there in Cape Giradeau. Dog shows abound there! Sorry I didn&#39;t find you <br/>
when we were there!<br/>
