&gt; of the year.  I think I could keep a porfolio instead, but I&#39;m not up for <br/>
&gt; that.  I do keep a daily journal for my husband&#39;s.  Not that he&#39;ll ever <br/>
&gt; look at it, and it was my idea.  But, just in case he gets to be a p.i.t.a, <br/>
&gt; I can stick it in his face and say, &quot;SEE!!!  They are learning!&quot;  For those <br/>
&gt; of you that give your kids an end-of-the-year exam, how do your kids do on <br/>
&gt; the tests and what things can I do to help them?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s an Unschooling Conference in Columbia, SC 11-13 October 2002. This <br/>
would be a great opportunity for you, your husband, and your boys to see HOW <br/>
unschooling works. You will be inspired by the voices here and from the <br/>
message boards. You can learn the who&#39;s, what&#39;s, when&#39;s, where&#39;s, and why&#39;s <br/>
of unschooling---and your husband could even challenge our speakers! They&#39;re <br/>
ALL prepared to answer your (and HIS ) questions. <br/>
<br/>
There will be funshops and activities for all ages. There will be grown <br/>
unschoolers and parents of grown unschoolers to reassure your husband. It&#39;s <br/>
doable; it&#39;s joyful; it WORKS!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you will consider joining us!<br/>
