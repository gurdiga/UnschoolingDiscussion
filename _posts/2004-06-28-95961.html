<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327453379">I wanted to share a success that was a direct result of this board!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure who wrote the list I got from this board, only that they &quot;have <br/>
five children, ages ranging from 7-17&quot;, but I printed out the list of 40 <br/>
&quot;things we do when we get bored&quot;, and as it suggested posting them to the <br/>
refridgerator, and that would be the BEST way to keep me from losing it (!), that&#39;s what <br/>
I did. I printed it out on June 12th, and hadn&#39;t gotten around to talking <br/>
with Wyl (5) about it, yet, but he kept moving the magnet that I had on the <br/>
bottom to keep it from catching on people when they walked by, and I kept asking <br/>
him to please leave that one magnet there (he&#39;s our resident magnet user! :~) ). <br/>
Last week, he came to me while I was going through my e-mail, and said, <br/>
&quot;Mama, I&#39;m bored. Can you get me a sheet and some snacks so I can make a tent in <br/>
the living room and eat snacks in it?&quot; It took me a few seconds to realise that <br/>
he had read the list by himself (does that count as &quot;scattering&quot;? lol), and <br/>
thought he NEEDED to be bored to ask for a tent-sheet! I was thrilled to go <br/>
upstairs for a sheet for him, didn&#39;t have any in my room (time to go to the <br/>
laundromat), and decided to get one of his (he has more sheet sets than I do, <br/>
anyhow!), but couldn&#39;t even get near the closet because of toys and stuff. I <br/>
explained that I could reach the sheets if he cleaned his stuff out of the closet <br/>
doorway, but by the time he was done cleaning that out, he had lost interest in <br/>
the tent/snacks idea... :~( I was pretty disapointed in that, but, glad that <br/>
something I had gotten here had sparked his interest and thrilled that he got it <br/>
&quot;on his own&quot; and came to me about it! Thanks to those who posted those <br/>
&quot;boredom lists&quot;!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; &quot;Mama, I&#39;m bored. Can you get me a sheet and some snacks so I can make a <br/>
tent in <br/>
<br/>
the living room and eat snacks in it?&quot; It took me a few seconds to realise <br/>
that <br/>
<br/>
he had read the list by himself  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How cool!<br/>
<br/>
My kids&#39; easiest &quot;tents&quot;  involved sheets and rubber bands (the big ones from <br/>
the post office, but any fairly fat ones would do, or hair ties) and the <br/>
heavy kind-of-ladder-back chairs so they could fasten the sheets to the top posts <br/>
of those and use them for parts of walls too.  Holly has done that as recently <br/>
as last fall when she had an overnight thing.  <br/>
<br/>
We have folding futons, and they can be stood on edge (bent, zig-zaggy, to <br/>
stay up) and used as walls too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-couldn&#39;t even get near the closet because of toys and stuff. I <br/>
<br/>
explained that I could reach the sheets if he cleaned his stuff out of the <br/>
closet <br/>
<br/>
doorway-=-<br/>
<br/>
You could&#39;ve grabbed one off a bed!  Or a tablecloth, or length of sewing <br/>
cloth, or...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Strike while the iron is hot&quot; is an important part of facilitating learning. <br/>
 Lots of our best memories and learning experiences have come about because a <br/>
parent or older sibling reacted in moments to an odd request, and something <br/>
great happened.   Waiting half an hour or a day isn&#39;t the same.<br/>

No tablecloths, here-maybe one 2&#39; x 2&#39;, but that wouldn&#39;t make much of a <br/>
tent... and all my &quot;sewing&quot; material is all scraps-not even 2&#39; x 2&#39;-but that does <br/>
help me think in other directions-get me thinking &quot;outside the box&quot; as it <br/>
were.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Well, that helped ME learn that lesson! :~D But maybe it helped him learn to <br/>
keep paths clean as well? I&#39;m not sure-and probably won&#39;t be for a while, but <br/>
I will keep my mind open to other options than I thought I had. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-609577656">I have been mostly out of pocket the last several weeks and missed the posting on boredom.  Could someone send that list again?  I have a 8 year old who&#39;s favorite phrase is.....&quot;I Am Bored!&quot;<br/>
