Hi there Sessuale here :) <br/>
Finally got around to my email and what a smile your em&#39;s put on my face! Sandi , I love your comment about Gatto.  That is *the perfect way to describe him.  When I first read his words I felt like I had heard a voice cutting above the din of a (very negative) crowd, you know?  <br/>
<br/>
David, you are sooo right.  I can&#39;t wait to read your book.  We need to hear more of the positive, more of the real.  I look forward to hearing your voice cut above the crowd too. :)<br/>

Gatto&#39;s book saved my sanity when we were deciding to homeschool.  There was<br/>
so much nonsense going on that his critique was something of a beacon in a<br/>
stormy sea!<br/>
<br/>
I just placed a library hold on The Exhausted School.  I look forward to<br/>
reading your book, David.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hi Sandi! Sessuale here :)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Just a quick thought.  I&#39;m a vet unschooler but new to this list and I<br/>
&gt;&gt; have been experiencing a little chaos of my own (computer chaos that<br/>
&gt;&gt; is).  At any rate, this is my first op to speak up.  I just wanted to<br/>
&gt;&gt; say that I couldn&#39;t agree with you more.  In fact your sentiments<br/>
&gt;&gt; reminded me of a wonderful book:<br/>
&gt;&gt; Dumbing Us Down.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Susan if you read nothing else this summer, read this.  It made me<br/>
&gt;&gt; really stop and think.  It strengthened my resolve and made me proud<br/>
&gt;&gt; of my choices and remember I&#39;m a former homeschooler myself!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dear Sessuale -<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It does my heart proud that you liked Gatto&#39;s book.  I was the editor<br/>
&gt;and publisher (I&#39;m the one with the note in the front), and I think the<br/>
&gt;book is even better today than when it came out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In about six weeks, my own book on our homeschooling experiences will be<br/>
&gt;out (published by New Society Publishers/Holt Associates) -- it was<br/>
&gt;interesting to homeschool being very conscious in advance of Gatto&#39;s<br/>
&gt;critiques, so I hope it will be seen as building on his work.  The book<br/>
&gt;will be called &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me:  Adventures in<br/>
&gt;Homeschooling and Community-Based Education&quot; (I finished the proofing<br/>
&gt;this weekend.)  Chapters will appear on my website:<br/>
&gt;www.skylarksings.com  (which won&#39;t be up until September 5 or so.)<br/>
