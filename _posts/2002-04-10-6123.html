<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632823989">&lt;&lt;Any thoughts?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Right now you don&#39;t even know if the &quot;problems&quot; actually exist or if they<br/>
are the stuff gossipy old hens who always assume the worst are made of.  Is<br/>
this woman reliable?  On what does she base her information?<br/>
<br/>
Second, does your dd enjoy the group?  If the gossip is true, do those<br/>
behaviors effect your dd in any way?  If she does become effected, can you<br/>
talk with her openly about her experiences and help her decide what she<br/>
wants to do?<br/>
