<div id="ygrps-yiv-904266206">I&#39;m coming late into this thread, but the following<br/>
response by Robyn urged me to read back a bit:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Help your mother take out a home equity loan, move to<br/>
a small assisted<br/>
living place, and rent out the big place to a large<br/>
family to cover the<br/>
repayments??? <br/>
<br/>
Robyn L. Coburn&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Although this is an impressive suggestion to help<br/>
Alicia (I believe it is) and her daughter, I must<br/>
caution about making such a decision (and I believe it<br/>
was the mother&#39;s mother you were refering to, and not<br/>
the whole family) to move a senior citizen into an<br/>
assisted living place. <br/>
<br/>
I have recently taken up weekend employment in such a<br/>
place (out of need for $$); residential living<br/>
facilities as it&#39;s called here.  I cook and serve<br/>
breakfast and lunch, do light housekeeping such as<br/>
making beds, emptying trash, wiping out sinks, and am<br/>
also a back up caregiver.  Basically I help out<br/>
wherever needed.  This is my first experience working<br/>
with this age population and in this type of facility.<br/>
 Let me tell you- I can barely stand to work there let<br/>
alone would I ever send any relative of mine,<br/>
especially my mother to a place like this.  The owners<br/>
are in it for the money at the cost of quality of life<br/>
for the residents, the staff are not highly educated-<br/>
er, perhaps I should say, not highly intelligent<br/>
(borderlining on criminal), the food is crap<br/>
(institutional food, all heat and serve canned or<br/>
frozen and absolutely nothing organic!), and worse of<br/>
all- these facilities are so understaffed it really is<br/>
a tragedy that a lot of us send our elders to die in<br/>
these type of places were nobody really cares about<br/>
them and they get minimal attention and barely ever go<br/>
outside to feel the sun on their skins!<br/>
<br/>
I realize there *must* be some good ones.  But, this<br/>
is my insider&#39;s experience.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully other alternatives will come to light. <br/>
Perhaps you can lend out a room in return for some<br/>
caregiving help and/or childcare help.  Perhaps you<br/>
can rent out a/another room to another single mother<br/>
with a similar aged child (and with similar parenting<br/>
styles).<br/>
<br/>
It is obvious that your daughter *needs* more<br/>
attention from you.  What does she do/where is she<br/>
when you are working?  <br/>
<br/>
trying to keep up with the reading,<br/>

<br/>
I had an elderly neighbor at our old neighborhood who was past 90, nearest <br/>
relatives Michigan and Kentucky, did NOT want to move there (they offered), <br/>
hadn&#39;t been able to get outside in the sun for several years, didn&#39;t really mind, <br/>
was sweet and happy with her books and art.   She wasn&#39;t eating.  Meals on <br/>
Wheels would come and she would put the stuff in the fridge.  I would visit and <br/>
clean out her fridge sometimes, give the meat to my dog or cats, and throw out <br/>
the moldy fruit and stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
When she became unable to get out of her chair, she got one that lifts you <br/>
up.   <br/>
<br/>
When she went to a nursing home, just four blocks from where we lived, she <br/>
got fresh food (even if canned, newly prepared and delivered), clean water in <br/>
clean glasses, clean bedding, a bed that she could lift herself up with, a clean <br/>
window, roommates she liked sometimes, I&#39;d bring her the books and papers she <br/>
wanted, she wrote letters and someone else made sure they got mailed. Someone <br/>
could open her mail for her.  She was just at the edge of not being able to <br/>
open mail.   <br/>
<br/>
The dining room and common room had big skylights, which was more light than <br/>
she ever got at her old house.  And her house had gotten really, really dusty, <br/>
and her cat had made messes she couldn&#39;t clean anymore.<br/>
<br/>
When she was 96, organic food was the least of her concerns.<br/>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  There are good ones.  One way to do your homework is to go <br/>
to your state Ombudsman&#39;s office and ask them for recommendations.  <br/>
An Ombudsman&#39;s job is to speak for the residents when the resident <br/>
can&#39;t speak for themselves.  They visit the residents of the <br/>
facility every week and ask them how things are going.  If things <br/>
are not going well, they try to mediate between the resident and the <br/>
facility (they are always on the resident&#39;s side).  They also send <br/>
weekly written reports to the state licensing agency which the state <br/>
uses when they do their annual survey of the facility.  They know <br/>
which ones are good to their residents and which ones are in it for <br/>
the cash.  If you go into any nursing home or rest home the <br/>
Ombudsman&#39;s name and phone number will be posted.  Every state in <br/>
the country does this the same way.<br/>

It was nightmarish.<br/>

come in to help.  &quot;Mattie&#39;s ladies&quot;, as they are known in the neighborhood,<br/>
have like an attached 2 bedroom apartment to the main house.  They have a<br/>
patio to sit out on.  They help garden if they want to.  They help train the<br/>
parrot if they want to.  They visit with the grandkids and my kids when they<br/>
are over.  They go to the grandkids&#39; birthday parties.  In full, they are<br/>
accepted as members of the family.<br/>

My dh rides the ambulance and was first on the scene a few months ago when<br/>
Mattie called 911 that one of the ladies had died.  The lady had lived with<br/>
her for 30 years.  Mattie cried like a baby.<br/>

<br/>
My mom could have and should have gone to a nursing home, or stayed in the <br/>
hospital.  She wanted to go to her own apartment and either get better or die.  <br/>
When home hospice care people showed up the day she got out of the hospital, <br/>
she ran them off and told them not to come back.   I didn&#39;t know that for <br/>
nearly a week.  <br/>
<br/>
She lied to get out of the hospital.<br/>
She lied to me about how and why she was out.<br/>
She lied to her friend.<br/>
She hid her prescription slips so I didn&#39;t know she was supposed to get meds.<br/>
She told her friend (who knew about them) that I would take care of filling <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
And so forth.<br/>
<br/>
And so I could have treated her like a mental incompetent and had her <br/>
committed to government care, or I could let her have her way, which is what I did.<br/>
<br/>
When someone is more cooperative the questions and answers are altogether <br/>
different.<br/>
