<div id="ygrps-yiv-475999916">Thanks for this picture Mary.  LOL    It&#39;s definitely a keeper.   <br/>

Mr. Bean was one of my kids first favorite video&#39;s from about the age of 4.   Imo it&#39;s absolutely the best humorous video for young kids out there!  :)   We haven&#39;t watched that video in ages, I think I&#39;m going to have to dig it out today and not wait until near Christmas (in the video we have he gets the x-mas turkey stuck on his head &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
I still think Kyle is do-able though!!  &lt;g&gt;   In &quot;homefront&quot; he looked nothing like Mr. Bean!   LOL    Part of the attraction for me I admit was/is? his voice.     <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can thank my husband for that picture. He&#39;s a nut!! I love that show<br/>
where he gets the turkey stuck on his head. That is just too funny. And his<br/>
little teddy bear, when he gives him the other eye for a present??!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Tara and I were just talking about his shows the other night. We can&#39;t find<br/>
them on anymore at all. When Tara took a trip up to Georgia awhile ago, she<br/>
was stuck in this little boon town with nothing there. So she&#39;s up late at<br/>
night watcing TV and she came upon Mr. Bean. Made the whole trip worth it<br/>
she said!!!!<br/>
<br/>
And have fun in your head with Kyle, I see no Mr. Bean in him at all!!!<br/>

Ooh, you&#39;ve never seen Mr. Bean??? It&#39;s a riot. He doesn&#39;t talk and just<br/>
makes these little grumbly noises. Get the Christmas one if you rent them!!<br/>

You can find those.<br/>
<br/>
The movie is Bean.<br/>
<br/>
Rowan Atkinson, who does Mr. Bean, is the only actor I can think of who does <br/>
mime AND just voicework (he was Zazu (sp?) the bird who advises Simba on Lion <br/>
King).  My favorite of all his stuff is Black Adder.  Especially the <br/>
Elizabethan series.  <br/>

Yesterday we saw a preview for &quot;Johnny English&quot; at the cinema. If you<br/>
like Rowan Atkinson you will love this. The whole audience was laughing<br/>
hysterically. <br/>

  Blackadder is the best. I love the Elizabethan series too. Is it Miranda Richardson who plays Elizabeth? She&#39;s great.  We have got to get that on DVD. I never get tired of it.<br/>

There&#39;s a new Blackadder (well, a few years old in England) new on DVD here, <br/>
called Back and Forth.  Time Travel.  Very fun.  Not a series, just one story, <br/>
