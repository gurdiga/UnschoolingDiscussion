As much as I admire your gumption - I, personally, would not have ANY actual <br/>
conversation or contact with DSS unless I had an experienced attorney on my <br/>
side. If you don&#39;t know anybody - ask your state homeschooling organization <br/>
or you can call the trial lawyers association for your state. Ask your state <br/>
organization for material to provide to your attorney to bring him/her up to <br/>
speed on your state&#39;s homeschooling law.  DSS has way too much power - far <br/>
beyond we would normally think is possible - it is risky to try to face them <br/>
down on your own. You may not need anything except a phone call or a letter <br/>
from your lawyer -- but you never know. <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve already interviewed your son without your permission and you&#39;ve had <br/>
them at your door. You don&#39;t say if you let them in and talked to them at <br/>
that time or what they say the next step is going to be --- but if you think <br/>
there is going to be ANY next step, I know that I would want an attorney. If <br/>
DSS didn&#39;t tell you that they were dropping the case, then I think you need <br/>
one now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-590463373">I agree with Pam 100%<br/>
<br/>
I would like to add that in most states it is illegal to question a <br/>
child in the absence of a parent, guardian or lawyer. You have <br/>
grounds to sue them. These people can be fascistic in they way they <br/>
handle cases like yours (it has not been the first time). Get thee to <br/>
a lawyer! Better yet, many in this list can help you get to proper <br/>
support group and, hopefully, the proper lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
