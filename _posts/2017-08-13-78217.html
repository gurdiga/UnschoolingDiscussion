<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536449006">Unschoolers have questions about how to help their kids learn about relationships, and this might help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are programs coming into being in the U.S., through a program called 4-H (it stands for heart, hand, health, home).  I hope even those in other countries, though, can get some ideas or encouragement from some of these articles.   <br/>
 <br/>
The organization is expanding into learning about relationships, and I thought it cold be good to know.  For those outside the U.S.  <br/>

4-H Is Helping Kids Plant The Seeds For Healthy Relationships<br/>
<br/>
From the NPR (National Public Radio) article:  <br/>
________<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Conflict is pervasive when teens have romantic relationships,&quot; says Giordano. She finds that when young people are given the right tools, they have the ability to identify unhealthy relationship signs as they mature.<br/>
<br/>
This 4-H program has been around for about a year. In that time, Chan says the majority of participants report feeling more confident after the workshop was over and that they felt they could share their relationship needs with their partners.<br/>

<br/>
It’s an interesting piece, and it’s possible that there will be materials available online. I hope.<br/>

An expansion on their youth development programs:<br/>

<br/>
4-H groups and programs are related to The Department of Agriculture, and were mostly about farming, ranching and homemaking (safe food preservation, storage) and community service.  When I was in 4-H in the 1960’s, we learned about flowers and floristry (among other things).  So groups have a great deal of flexibility.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of homeschoolers are involved in 4-H, and unschoolers have been, too. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That top article linked to another article at NPR which isn’t about 4-H but might be helpful to some here.<br/>

Teen Sex-Ed Resources For Oh, Oh, Those Summer Nights<br/>

<br/>
It could be helpful for families to think of it as relationships rather than “sex ed,” when they’re discussing such things with their growing children.<br/>
