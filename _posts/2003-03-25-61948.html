<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re wrong! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cameron, my fifteen year old, doesn&#39;t need any more direction than my seven <br/>
year old. And in three months, he won&#39;t even need me to drive!<br/>
<br/>
His typical day begins after 10:00. He&#39;ll fix himself a bagel or toast or <br/>
cereal. He usually spends an hour or so at the computer editting the movie <br/>
he&#39;s working on. He wrote the screenplay and directed his friends in it. He <br/>
has several hours of tape and so far only fifteen minutes of movie---LOTS of <br/>
&quot;wasted&quot; tape.<br/>
<br/>
Then he&#39;ll spend an hour or two outside skateboarding. He&#39;s happy to bounce <br/>
(on the trampoline) whenever his brother asks. He&#39;s also game for any board <br/>
or imaginary game that Duncan wants to play. As soon as it warms up, they&#39;ll <br/>
spend a lot of the day in & around the pool.<br/>
<br/>
After lunch, he might ask that we go driving---that&#39;s if we don&#39;t have <br/>
somewhere to go anyway; then he always drives. He had no problem with the <br/>
written test to get the permit. I can&#39;t forsee any problems with his getting <br/>
the restricted license either.<br/>
<br/>
He spends two-three hours a day playing the drums. They were a Christmas <br/>
gift, and he&#39;s amazingly good---without lessons of any kind. He&#39;s going next <br/>
week to Spartanburg to spend the evening with the drummer for the Marshall <br/>
Tucker Band.<br/>
<br/>
He usually does little things around the house to help me. He likes to empty <br/>
the dishwasher. I hate it---so that&#39;s a big help. He almost always picks up <br/>
the den and starts a load of laundry.<br/>
<br/>
He likes his room VERY neat. He recently redesigned & redecorated his room. <br/>
He painted the walls and then painted the logos of his favorite group on the <br/>
wall---shadow images. It is SO cool! He also took photos of the band last <br/>
time they were in town, then cropped and enlarged them, and got the band <br/>
members to sign them. They&#39;re also on the wall.<br/>
<br/>
He likes to draw and create, so he often has paper nearby for new ideas.<br/>
<br/>
He LOVES his music, and there is hardly a minute that goes by when he&#39;s not <br/>
listening to music.<br/>
<br/>
He and I went to see Arlo Guthrie Sunday night. I was totally enthralled. His <br/>
band consisted of his son, Abe, his daughter, Saralee, and his son-in-law, <br/>
Johnny. Major cool to see the family up there! Cameron wasn&#39;t <br/>
impressed---he&#39;s not into folk music (the weirdo! &lt;g&gt;), but he suffered <br/>
through it for me. I told him that, when he&#39;s 40, he&#39;ll get to brag that he <br/>
saw Arlo Guthrie in concert with his kids! &lt;g&gt; Then he had to listen to <br/>
Alice&#39;s Restaurant Massacree all the way home! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, he and I were down for the entire day---some stomach bug. Thank <br/>
goodness Duncan can completely entertain and care for himself. Cam and I <br/>
slept in my bed the whole day in between runs to the bathroom (I guess I <br/>
can&#39;t count Monday as a &quot;school day&quot;! &lt;G&gt;). I&#39;m better today, but haven&#39;t <br/>
seem Cam yet this morning. I hope he&#39;s feeling better!<br/>
<br/>
He spends evenings talking with his friends and IMing them on the &#39;puter. <br/>
He&#39;s usually in bed by 2ish after spending some time on the computer or <br/>
watching TV or listening to music.<br/>
<br/>
The only &quot;direction&quot; I give is maybe, &quot;Take a right at the next light.&quot; He&#39;s <br/>
perfectly capable of directing himself!<br/>

The little ones need me to show them the world, to see what is available. The <br/>
older they get, the more of the world they know about or know how to access <br/>
and the less I am strewing or &quot;providing direction&quot;.<br/>
Unschooled teens are incredibly interesting and cool.<br/>
The things my son teaches me now (at age 13) are amazing.<br/>
He knows a lot more than I do about many topics...its&#39; really neat.<br/>

me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
