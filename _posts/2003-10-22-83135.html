<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122196858">well, folks, it&#39;s going to happen, and happen soon...unless there can <br/>
be compelling arguments here, about not doing the following:<br/>
<br/>
putting a bedtime on the kids again, and possibly declaring &quot;computer <br/>
and TV free month&quot; and here&#39;s why.<br/>
<br/>
Bedtimes, because when they stay up, they have demonstrated <br/>
(repeatedly) an inability to keep quiet. Last night, playing a <br/>
(quite) fun, interactive computer game, they got noisy enough to wake <br/>
me at 1:30 whereupon I said &quot;Don&#39;t wake me up again, please&quot; and <br/>
2:45...whereupon I said &quot;Okay, time to wrap it up&quot; and they turned <br/>
off the puter and hit the hay.<br/>
<br/>
Also, when I got up this morning, I found ON the computer table: <br/>
sugar bowl with a ladle in it, a cup with three spoons, a kitchen <br/>
knife with banana slices and a half a banana. In the kitchen, the <br/>
banana bunch laid out on the counter top, two of them cut in half, <br/>
the halves lying there turning brown...<br/>
<br/>
you get the general idea: pretty much a trashed kitchen and computer <br/>
area. The slivers of paper, the scissors, the crayons, the box/table <br/>
next to the couch where my youngest had crashed, the blankets, <br/>
stuffed toys, etc. did not bother me at all. But the food on the <br/>
computer table? The wasteful banana thing? Those I didn&#39;t like. <br/>
<br/>
As for &quot;computer and TV free November&quot; (only, maybe it&#39;ll be the rest <br/>
of October, since we&#39;re having such tremendous weather which might <br/>
not be the case in Nov.)...well, it&#39;s all they do! literally. If I <br/>
don&#39;t have errands to run, they&#39;re in front of the computer or TV. I <br/>
keep myself moderately busy, and have gotten out of the habit of <br/>
demanding they help with things. I ask if they will; nearly 100% of <br/>
the time, they can&#39;t pry themselves away from the screen. Which I <br/>
don&#39;t fret about...trust me to have learned that much in the past <br/>
year! <br/>
<br/>
Granted, out in the boonies, as we are, and trying to cut back on our <br/>
running (for economic reasons: we simply can&#39;t afford it)...there <br/>
isn&#39;t a lot of outside-the-home-and-family things to do. But: there&#39;s <br/>
a treehouse, there are bikes, there are pretty cool walks and rock <br/>
climbing, a creek; in the house, there are books, paints, glue, <br/>
crayons, a kitchen, a CD player, a piano, a guitar; outside there&#39;s a <br/>
wood shop, a wood pile, a black top driveway, scooters, balls, <br/>
various garden and shop tools, paint and brushes...in short, there&#39;s <br/>
quite a bit in their environment to choose from; I put in a fair <br/>
share of work and play IN that environment...and they continue with a <br/>
strong attraction to &quot;screen time&quot; to the exclusion of other things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m much more inclined toward the bedtime, than the limited screen <br/>
time. We have had &quot;screen-free week&quot; many times in the past, and it <br/>
would be a temporary thing, for sure. But the bedtimes (lack thereof) <br/>
seems not to be working out, and I want to re-establish them...<br/>
<br/>
tell me why not<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413725806">Heidi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m all for bedtimes.  Our family lives in the &quot;regular&quot; world, where Daddy<br/>
has to be up rather early and sometimes he gets home on time, sometimes he&#39;s<br/>
pretty late.  Individual bedtimes simply won&#39;t work.  I don&#39;t know how old<br/>
your kids are, either.  Mine are not old enough to be up unsupervised and I<br/>
can&#39;t possibly spread my waking hours to accomodate four different<br/>
children&#39;s body clocks.<br/>
<br/>
With freedom comes responsibility.  If your kids are not going to use their<br/>
freedom to choose their own bedtimes wisely, they really can&#39;t have that<br/>
freedom.  If it isn&#39;t working for your family, it&#39;s not something you should<br/>
do.  If you really want it to work, you can try tweaking things here and<br/>
there and ease on into it.  But you might want to think about exactly why<br/>
you think/want your kids to be able to go to bed when they want.  Do you<br/>
think it&#39;s good for them?  Good for the family?  Necessary?  If you think<br/>
&quot;yes&quot; to these questions, then you&#39;ll work out an acceptable solution.  If<br/>
you think &quot;no&quot;, then why bother?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-408932300">They do get drowsy when we lie down together and read, but at the <br/>
back of their minds is &quot;gonna get to that computer&quot; and they do, once <br/>
it gets time for me to turn in (being a morning person, I hit the hay <br/>
no later than about 10:30, sometimes earlier.)<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of a pajama party. YOu should have seen how silly we  <br/>
got, the last time we all slept together! L Hubby was out of town, or <br/>
it prolly wouldn&#39;t have happened. My, we were goofy, until like 2:00 <br/>
a.m. It was fun, and because it was novel, the excitement got the <br/>
kids going, and they were so funny I was laughing...IOW, when we all <br/>
had a bedtime party, we stayed up as late as their typical &quot;self-<br/>
chosen&quot; bedtime. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll start a routine of reading aloud, while they color or <br/>
snuggle under blankets (I&#39;d lap sit them, but this is a nine and <br/>
almost 11 year old we&#39;re talking about)...just quiet everything down <br/>
as the evening progresses...<br/>

Could you ask the kids to go to their rooms  once you are ready for bed? Is<br/>
it possible for them to be quiet and read or something in their rooms once<br/>
it reaches a certain time? It seems unfair to you if they are going to be up<br/>
all night making noise. My boys sometimes take their lego to their room if<br/>
they are  not ready to go to sleep when I would like them to. Or if I<br/>
suggest a milo and several chapters of whichever book we are reading they<br/>
are usually happy to settle in bed.<br/>

<br/>
Remember it&#39;s seasonal. This won&#39;t last. Give it another couple of weeks and<br/>
they may surprise you by neglecting the TV for something else. Rent some<br/>
movies that YOU like and sit with them. I find when I start to get stressed<br/>
about the amount of time the kids are spending in front of the TV it means<br/>
I&#39;m not hanging out with them enough. Are you spending more time cleaning<br/>
and cooking than you are just being with them?  Also, what about asking them<br/>
to play a game with you. Or sit down in front of the TV with some craft or a<br/>
puzzle. Or put out some fun stuff on the table and play with it yourself,<br/>
maybe you&#39;ll attract some company.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s what I told them for last night: stay up if you want, but in <br/>
your room and quiet (the littler kids each have their own room, but <br/>
prefer to crash on the floor together, of one or the other) And they <br/>
did fine. Katie has a little fort built out of a box, blankets, and <br/>
pillows. It even has a door! they thumped around a little bit with <br/>
that, but were quiet after just a little while.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or if I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; suggest a milo <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s a milo? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I find when I start to get stressed<br/>

 </span></blockquote>it means<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m not hanging out with them enough. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah! I think you may have hit the nail on the head. We&#39;re going <br/>
through a bit of economic crisis right now, so I&#39;ve had my head <br/>
buried in books about frugal and simple living...maybe a rock-<br/>
climbing expedition w/picnic, this afternoon. <br/>
<br/>
It is the computer, though, more than the TV. I&#39;m a movie person, <br/>
very much so. Abbie and I have been watching one Shakespeare film <br/>
after another, and loving every minute of it. I don&#39;t mind them <br/>
watching TV...I &quot;don&#39;t mind&quot; the computer, except for the complete <br/>
hold it seems to have on them, even when we&#39;re doing something else.<br/>
<br/>
we found a wild apple tree, bearing much fruit, on one of our hikes <br/>
recently. A few days later, we returned w/buckets and a step stool, <br/>
and harvested the apples. It was SUCH a cool outing, and we made <br/>
juice from some of them, and I put together an apple cake from some. <br/>
Jonathans! yummy. Well, we had this terrific time, walking in the <br/>
woods, shaking down the apples, romping all over the place, laughing <br/>
at the dogs, walked about two miles. It was GREAT! <br/>
<br/>
When we got home (&quot;No one leave the car empty handed!&quot;) I was the <br/>
last one through the door. Shoes, and whatever each kid carried in, <br/>
were sitting in the entryway, and they were IN the computer. The two <br/>
younger ones, anyway. It was like, at the back of their mind, even <br/>
through all the fun we were having, there was one thought &quot;Gonna play <br/>
computer when we get home&quot; I&#39;ve seen the same with bike riding...the <br/>
very instant that fun activity is over...beeline to the computer. <br/>
<br/>
And some days, even in this gorgeous fall we&#39;re having, with mom <br/>
outside, they&#39;re inside at the computer. &quot;hey, I&#39;m going out to <br/>
resnaffle the toobangle. You wanta come see how it&#39;s done?&quot; (Not <br/>
demanding help, just asking if they want to come hang out while I do <br/>
something)... no takers.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like computer IS their life, though I know if I sat down and <br/>
did a &quot;day in the life&quot; I&#39;d see there is other stuff going on. <br/>
Computer just seems to be taking up more than its fair share...<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Are you spending more time cleaning<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and cooking than you are just being with them?  Also, what about <br/>
 </span></blockquote>asking them<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to play a game with you. Or sit down in front of the TV with some <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; puzzle. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like the idea of having something out on the floor while we watch <br/>
TV...might pull their eyeballs from the screen once in awhile. I <br/>
think today, Abbie and I are going to memorize Dogberry from Much Ado <br/>
About Nothing, the Kenneth Branagh/Emma Thompson version! :) Which <br/>
means, you see, playing his sections over and over LOL what&#39;s not to <br/>
love? Maybe Katie and Robby could be the guards hee hee<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Milo is the best, yummiest chocolate drink in the world. Well, I should say<br/>
Australia! It&#39;s an energy drink. You can drink it hot or cold or eat it<br/>
staright out of the tin although dentists would recommend against the<br/>
latter&lt;g&gt;.  Mark likes it sprinkled/heaped on his cereal. Nestle make it.<br/>

What&#39;s a milo?<br/>
Milo is the best, yummiest chocolate drink in the world. Well, I should say<br/>
Australia! It&#39;s an energy drink. You can drink it hot or cold or eat it<br/>
staright out of the tin although dentists would recommend against the<br/>
latter&lt;g&gt;.  Mark likes it sprinkled/heaped on his cereal. Nestle make it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410555535">The in-laws popped a surprise visit on the way through to visit some other rellies and my kids were all doing the &#39;screen thing&#39;.  MIL says &quot;what are you doing playing computer games?? It&#39;s a school day!!&quot;  I said &quot;we don&#39;t do school days here&quot;.  And that was that.  I&#39;ve tried to explain our philosophy a gazillion times and have even put bookmarks to unschooling.com in her favourites list.  Might be time to send some &#39;light&#39; reading to her via email.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have the energy to go into &#39;play *is* work&#39; and the critical, lateral and who knows what all else &#39;al&#39; thinking is involved in computer games.  The problem solving, the map reading, the FUN!!<br/>
<br/>
The times that I&#39;ve felt bad about the kids spending so much time at the computer or psone are the times when I wish that I was sitting there instead lol.  <br/>

up late and get up late.  My DH also has to be up very early and gets home <br/>
around 6:30-7:30 most nights.  My boys are 6 and 9 but this is how we have <br/>
handled the differing body clocks here.<br/>
<br/>
My DH is responsible for himself.  He goes to bed when he wants just like the <br/>
rest of us.  He likes to stay up late, and play with the boys.  When I get <br/>
tired I go to bed as well.  My boys are a bit older now so safety isn&#39;t as much <br/>
of a concern.  Some days they will stay up a while and play on the computer or <br/>
finish watching a movie.  Then they come in the bedroom with us and play <br/>
quietly in there until they are tired.  They love to draw or read books or even <br/>
play army men which is OK as long as they are pretty quiet.  If they get a bit <br/>
noisy I ask them to take it into the hallway outside the door so as not to <br/>
bother us.  (They don&#39;t like being in their room at night without someone else in <br/>
there.)<br/>
<br/>
When they were younger they would do the same thing.  If they were watching a <br/>
movie I would put it on int he bedroom for them to watch.  I never had a <br/>
&quot;bedtime&quot; but when they were younger they couldn&#39;t be roaming the house alone and <br/>
they never wanted to either.  They have never wanted to be up in the house <br/>
alone at night so they have always done quiet things int eh bedroom with us and <br/>
when they got tired would climb up in bed.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we have tried our best to create win/win situations.  We have <br/>
compromised so that everyone&#39;s individual needs are respected.<br/>
Anyway just what happens here.<br/>

<time>24 Oct 2003, at  6:39am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316144756">Hi Lee-Ann<br/>
<br/>
LOL I enjoy computer games, too. In fact, two games that Robby has <br/>
brought into the house, I have beat him. Play them more than he does <br/>
(he plays others)...and I&#39;ve read and find myself agreeing with the <br/>
articles touting computer games as learning tools (BeetleJunior, <br/>
Chips Challenge, Dynomite: Puzzle games, with mazes, problem solving, <br/>
quick thinking, perfect timing, etc...um, sorta like the kinds of <br/>
things found on standardized tests, eh?...) So I don&#39;t have a problem <br/>
with my kids &quot;doing nothing&quot; while playing. I know they ARE doing <br/>
things, yea verily, amazing things, when they are playing.<br/>
<br/>
Which, thinking about it, if it is the case that they&#39;re doing <br/>
amazing things while computerizing, I shouldn&#39;t be fretting about it. <br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see here. Maybe telling on a guy I dated will clarify me a bit. <br/>
Don was a nice fellow: decent, calm, kind. A dry, kind of bizaare <br/>
sense of humor. VERY attached to his possessions, and owned two of <br/>
nearly everything (two guitars; two cars; two identical pancake <br/>
turners...) anyway. Nice guy. We went out for about half a year, and <br/>
one date was a picnic. We hit the grocery store first, to pick up <br/>
things for the picnic. As we walked in the door, there was a TV <br/>
playing...and Don stopped there for a full five minutes, to watch! <br/>
Since I was living at home at the time, he met my folks. Invariably, <br/>
when we were in the front room, if the TV was on, (as it usually was) <br/>
Don dropped out of the conversation and got completely absorbed in <br/>
whatever was on. You couldn&#39;t even interrupt his gaze for a <br/>
commercial. This, in a grown man.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll say &quot;he didn&#39;t get enough time to watch as a kid&quot; NO, <br/>
according to his mom, he was glued to the TV for his spare time <br/>
through pretty much his whole childhood. (Okay, okay, &quot;spare time&quot; <br/>
sheesh) It just seemed to me that this guy COULDN&#39;T get enough time <br/>
before the screen, and!!! that he was pulled into it entirely: his <br/>
whole psyche involved and nothing could pull him away.<br/>
<br/>
This, I do not want for my kids. But to be completely objective (as I <br/>
always am LOL)...my kids already aren&#39;t as exaggeratedly into it as <br/>
Don was. Thus, my worries that they will be &quot;Don&#39;s&quot; is baseless, and <br/>
I should quit fretting. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what&#39;s happening since I initially posted: 10:30 or so <br/>
is &quot;bedtime&quot;. The computer gets turned off (&quot;as soon as this level is <br/>
over, mom!&quot;) and the kids go downstairs, where they visit or read or <br/>
work on their current fort or listen to music, quietly. I and hubby <br/>
go to bed. <br/>
<br/>
It seems to be a good solution.<br/>
<br/>
I will work on calming myself about the &quot;screen time.&quot; It hasn&#39;t even <br/>
been a year since we started this unschooling experiment.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; freedom to choose their own bedtimes wisely, they really can&#39;t have that<br/>
&gt; freedom.<br/>
 &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think when people say &quot;wisely&quot; they mean sometimes &quot;choose what I wish they <br/>
would choose.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Wisely&quot; means &quot;matches my preconceived notions&quot; too often.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who claim to have tried unschooling and then they claim it <br/>
failed.  When they report what they did, they left their kids alone and later <br/>
got angry because their children hadn&#39;t somehow spontaneously burst into <br/>
schoolwork.  They thought unschooling would eventually look like studying history <br/>
from a history book, reading classic novels and writing reports on them, and <br/>
studying geometry with a lined notebook full of diagrams and formulae.<br/>
<br/>
Decisions about bedtimes and &quot;enough sleep&quot; when made by parents often look <br/>
like &quot;go to bed at 9:00 and wake up at 7:00.&quot;    If that&#39;s the only wise <br/>
decision a child can make, their freedom was not real.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920204929">FWIW, our children were never nappers and because we&#39;re &quot;older&quot; <br/>
parents -- who get tired! -- we worried about their safety after we were asleep, <br/>
from the time they first could walk and climb.<br/>
<br/>
       For peace of mind, then, we never did &quot;bedtime&quot; but instead invented <br/>
what we called &quot;Light Time.&quot; It meant time to &quot;retire&quot; to the delights of one&#39;s <br/>
own room, where as long as things were reasonably quiet and relaxed (reading <br/>
in bed mostly but also coloring and jigsaw puzzles, imaginary play with <br/>
stuffed animals et cetera) then the lights would stay on as late as desired by the <br/>
child, even all night.<br/>
<br/>
       This seemed great to them because the stories and tv shows they <br/>
watched included bedtimes with lights out, and it always came at some pre-set <br/>
artificial time. Light time was whenever the day seemed basically over for the <br/>
family. Because we  treated Light Time like a special family deal, just because we <br/>
were &quot;us&quot; and could do what we wanted without following the rules other people <br/>
did,  the children always seemed to feel it was a privilege rather than <br/>
something to undermine or resist.<br/>
<br/>
       We now have one teen and one eight-year-old. They still really like <br/>
their &quot;light time&quot; and cheerfully retire to their own quiet dominions whenever <br/>
dad and I put the house to bed and toddle off ourselves. In our house the <br/>
electronics are all central (no phones, tvs or computers in bedrooms) but we&#39;ve <br/>
always had a tape/CD player by each bed with an assortment of books on tape (the <br/>
Harry Potter ones by Jim Dale are award-winning and truly wonderful - we <br/>
listen to them in the car on trips and all enjoy them)  The teen has several <br/>
journals going and is writing plays and stories, and also is experimenting with art, <br/>
knitting and crafts, mostly because she&#39;s discovered these as things she can <br/>
enjoy during the hours after she officially retires to her room. I have no <br/>
idea what time she usually gets to sleep now, but judging from the hours at which <br/>
she rises, I would say there have been some pretty wee hours of light time on <br/>
a regular basis! :)<br/>
<br/>
       Anyway, didn&#39;t mean to go on about it -- I just wanted to say that the <br/>
concept of &quot;light time&quot; rather than &quot;bedtime&quot; worked well for us.   JJ<br/>

  &lt;&lt;  If your kids are not going to use their<br/>
  &gt; freedom to choose their own bedtimes wisely, they really can&#39;t have that<br/>
  &gt; freedom.<br/>
  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I think when people say &quot;wisely&quot; they mean sometimes &quot;choose what I wish they <br/>
  would choose.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Wisely&quot; means &quot;matches my preconceived notions&quot; too often.<br/>
<br/>
  There are people who claim to have tried unschooling and then they claim it <br/>
  failed.  When they report what they did, they left their kids alone and later <br/>
  got angry because their children hadn&#39;t somehow spontaneously burst into <br/>
  schoolwork.  They thought unschooling would eventually look like studying history <br/>
  from a history book, reading classic novels and writing reports on them, and <br/>
  studying geometry with a lined notebook full of diagrams and formulae.<br/>
<br/>
  Decisions about bedtimes and &quot;enough sleep&quot; when made by parents often look <br/>
  like &quot;go to bed at 9:00 and wake up at 7:00.&quot;    If that&#39;s the only wise <br/>
  decision a child can make, their freedom was not real.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374364692">This is true Robyn.  <br/>
Milo is superior I feel &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I used to call the dregs from Ovaltine &#39;grouchies&#39; when I was little (we didn&#39;t do the hot water thing to dissolve it first).  Haven&#39;t had ovaltine for years but remember it being slightly bitter compared to the taste of milo (both dry, no sugar).<br/>
We used to put the milk in first then a big heap of milo on top then add sugar to the top of the milo heap and wait for the sugar to tip the milo over as it absorbed moisture.  Too cool.<br/>

Robyn said:-<br/>
Milo when stirred into milk leaves slightly crunchy bits floating in the<br/>
center of the whirlpool that are really scrumptious. Ovaltine requires a<br/>
splash of boiling water to be dissolved first, and is a different flavor<br/>
- I promise.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Anyway, didn&#39;t mean to go on about it -- I just wanted to say that the<br/>
concept of &quot;light time&quot; rather than &quot;bedtime&quot; worked well for us.   JJ&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps some people who are struggling with &quot;bed times.&quot;  Thanks<br/>
for sharing. It was a nice story.<br/>

loud and rude and leaving messes.  None of this is treating other family<br/>
members with respect.  They had complete freedom to act this way.  They also<br/>
had complete freedom to play quietly and either clean up after themselves or<br/>
not make such a mess in the first place.    They used their freedom and<br/>

Real freedom has real responsibility attached to it.<br/>

If they say things that indicate they haven&#39;t ever really considered both <br/>
sides, or are refusing to considered both sides, that&#39;s probably really &quot;you <br/>
don&#39;t understand.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so in the case of &quot;wise decisions&quot; when the phrase is used by someone who <br/>
has not experienced more than one model, it can also be a &quot;you don&#39;t <br/>
understand.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are cultural &quot;wisdoms&quot; (early to bed, early to rise...) which aren&#39;t <br/>
objective &quot;wisdom,&quot; just the mold &quot;good people&quot; should try to fit themselves <br/>
into.  The arguments against those are sometimes also traditional.  (They won&#39;t <br/>
get enough sleep if I don&#39;t force them, they won&#39;t be able to hold a job when <br/>
they&#39;re grown...)<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was up before 9:00 this morning.  He doesn&#39;t need to be at work until <br/>
5:00.  He decided last night to join a Magic tournament today, got himself up, <br/>
wrote me a note, and went.  I didn&#39;t make him go to bed, I didn&#39;t make him get <br/>
up, I would have let him sleep til noon.   People who fear to risk that will <br/>
probably add to their fears that a kid could never manage his schedule unless <br/>
he HAD a schedule.  That&#39;s their fear, based on their fears.<br/>
I have knowledge based on experience, and it seems to be it&#39;s worth sharing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-146873497">&lt;&lt;However, Heidi&#39;s kids were being loud and rude and leaving messes.  None of this is treating other family members with respect.  They had complete freedom to act this way.  They also had complete freedom to play quietly and either clean up after themselves or not make such a mess in the first place.    They used their freedom and chose the activities that led Mom to believe that her children were not ready for the freedom she allowed.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But giving the kids freedom (e.g. when to go to bed), leaving them alone in their choices to do whatever, and then being upset about the choices they made and revoking that freedom, is not unschooling.  I&#39;m not saying this is what Heidi did, it&#39;s just the direction the discussion has gone.<br/>
<br/>
There is more than one path from point A (kids being loud & messy) to point B (parents sleeping peacefully without waking to a large mess).  Enforcing bedtimes is just one possible path to point B.  But it&#39;s an authoritarian path that gives the kids the impression that they only have these freedoms if their choices match mine (my preconceived notions about which path they should choose).  And this attitude is not very conducive to unschooling, as the kids may conclude that the parent may take away other freedoms, such as not doing &quot;schoolwork&quot; etc, at any arbitrary time that the parent decides they are not making the &quot;right choices&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, the parent could discuss the issue with the kids.  The kids need to know how their choices are affecting others; they may not realize it on their own. For example explaining &quot;the noise you make after I go to bed is waking me up during the night.  I&#39;m not getting a good night&#39;s sleep so I feel tired and cranky in the morning.&quot;  And then brainstorming some solutions on how they can keep the noise level down.  Or get some food without making a huge mess.  You get the idea.<br/>
<br/>
And the discussions are definitely geared to the child&#39;s age.  With younger kids, maybe you can offer up more interesting choices, like lets go up to your room and read a favourite story, watch a favourite movie etc.  And as they get older, maybe &quot;light time&quot; as someone suggested, time in their room to pursue quiet activities of their choice is an acceptable solution to get to point B for everyone involved.  And as they get older still, maybe just friendly reminders to keep it down, turn off the lights etc. before you go up to bed.  This are just other paths that can get you to point B, not guaranteed solutions for everyone.  The point is that the parents need to talk with their kids to work out solutions that are amenable to everyone involved.  This way the kids learn how to make good decisions and choices - choosing the best path for them from point A to B while considering how their choices affect others involved.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, for example, when I realized my son wanted tea in the evenings after I went to bed, I first put out on the counter all the stuff he&#39;d need, filled the kettle, and wrote basic instructions (including toss the tea bag in the sink).  I did that for a few nights, then the instructions fell by the wayside and I just left the stuff out.  After a couple weeks, he can take care of it all himself.  And though I mention any larger mess I find in the morning (like &quot;when you make such and such, can you please put this and that in the garbage&quot; etc.), give reminders to &quot;please turn out all the lights before you go to bed&quot;, and occasionally get up to ask them to &quot;please turn/keep it down, it&#39;s too loud for me to sleep&quot;, I do enjoy coming down in the morning and figuring out what they&#39;ve done and eaten ... it keeps me in touch!<br/>
