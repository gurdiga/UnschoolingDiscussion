&lt;&lt; Children who are raised in homes where they are treated with respect and <br/>
are<br/>
loved unconditionally, understand they&#39;d have to give all that up to live in<br/>
the a world where they could kill without remorse. What they&#39;d have to give<br/>
up is way more valuable than what they&#39;d get in return. If we concentrate on<br/>
creating a life and world that they wouldn&#39;t want to give up, then we can be<br/>
confident that no matter what they explore, that they&#39;re going to conclude<br/>
that they already have something that&#39;s too good to give up. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I like this point a lot.<br/>
<br/>
For some people, the military is a safer place than their family of origin.<br/>
For some people, being in prison is preferable to continuing to fail out in <br/>
the world.  <br/>
For some people, running away and all the danger that entails is preferable <br/>
to one more night at home.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers who have dedicated their lives to making their children feel <br/>
safely whole and loved won&#39;t have kids who would rather be ANYWHERE but at home.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids leave it will be because someplace is better than here, but it&#39;s <br/>
going to have to be pretty good!   <br/>
<br/>
I remember kids when I was younger glomming on to the first person who would <br/>
be kind to them because it was better than home.<br/>

I&#39;m very often asked how in the world I&#39;m ever going to get John (19) to <br/>
leave home if I keep making it so comfortable for him here.  I don&#39;t understand <br/>
that, I usually just give a blank look, which is all my mind can come up with, <br/>
not believing I&#39;ve heard this yet again.<br/>

Are there people in the world who get excited and giddy at the thought of <br/>

Many parents can&#39;t wait until their child/children turn 18 just so they can<br/>
say, go on your way. And many kids can&#39;t wait for that either.<br/>
<br/>
Tara was just accepted to FAU. I was writing everyone telling them because<br/>
she was so happy. It&#39;s the only university she wanted to go to. My cousin,<br/>
who has 1 grown out of college kid, made the remark that now Tara will be<br/>
happy and getting use to dorm life. Not in a kick her out kind of way, but<br/>
like she thought Tara couldn&#39;t wait to get out. (she lives far away and has<br/>
never seen my kids)<br/>
For Tara, that university was actually a good selling point for her to go.<br/>
Not only is it a good college, but it&#39;s close enough that she can stay home.<br/>
Her best friend told her if she were her, she wouldn&#39;t move out until she<br/>
was married!<br/>
<br/>
Tara has a few friends that are actually looking forward to getting out of<br/>
the house now. She also has a few who have been told to leave now. It&#39;s<br/>
really so sad.<br/>

of the problem others have understanding homeschooling and esp. <br/>
unschooling (in which kids are so much more involved in their <br/>
parents lives even than homeschoolers).  I hear so many mothers say <br/>
to me, &quot;You must be really looking forward to Morgaine going to <br/>
school next year,&quot; or &quot;Wow, I can&#39;t wait until the kids are all in <br/>
school and I can have the house to myself all day!&quot;  It is very, <br/>
very sad to me that people can dislike their children to that extent <br/>
or take so little joy from the time they have with their kids. <br/>

Mom and dad in their fifties or so are living it up in Disney World----now <br/>
that the children are gone. Golfing, swimming, dancing, &quot;tunel of love&quot; rides. <br/>
<br/>
A voice says, &quot;What will YOU do after the kids are all gone?&quot;----or something <br/>
like that. Typical parenting commercial.<br/>

  Sort of reminds me of the old Staples commercial:  &quot;Its the most wonderful time of the year&quot; LOL.<br/>
<br/>
  I have to admit though, when I mourn the idea of my children leaving home, I think of that Disney commercial and think &quot;wow, so many new things to do&quot; :o).<br/>

Quoting Homer Simpsom, my Dad and countless others; &quot;When you&#39;re 18 you&#39;re <br/>
out the door! Woo Whoo!&quot; <br/>
And when I told my parents once that one of my best dreams is that one day I <br/>
would have a huge old house filled with my kids, their spouses/partners, their <br/>
kids, dogs ... my Mom looked at me like a deer caught in headlights looks and <br/>
my Dad just shook his head and said, &quot;No, you don&#39;t want that.&quot;<br/>

This made me think of the movie &quot;Moonstruck&quot;, when Olympia Dukakis asks<br/>
Cher&#39;s character why don&#39;t they live there (in the huge family brownstone)<br/>
after she has married. Cher says &quot;Papa don&#39;t like Johnny&quot;. It seems to me<br/>
that maybe it is a cultural thing - the idea of people staying in the family<br/>
home. Maybe it is an economic thing - most people&#39;s homes aren&#39;t really<br/>
large enough for multigenerations - not like the old English mansions<br/>
described in Austen.<br/>
<br/>
I am reading an interesting book called &quot;The Subversive Family: An<br/>
Alternative History of Love and Marriage&quot; by Ferdinand Mount, a British<br/>
author. (It sure is taking a long time but I keep coming and going - it&#39;s<br/>
not a gripping narrative anyway). He uses old church, courts and census<br/>
information as primary sources for the kind of households people had, and<br/>
how old they were when they married etc. His research shows that outside of<br/>
politically motivated marriages amongst the nobility and monarchies, most<br/>
ordinary people married for affection in their mid 20&#39;s, waiting this long<br/>
for economic reasons, and would have lived with their parents until that<br/>
time. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1104608008">I think parents would care more about their kids than dumping at a <br/>
certain age, although it&#39;s likely they may need to be independent if <br/>
something happens later on.<br/>

Some cultures are family oriented so I think it&#39;s a cultural thing <br/>

&lt;&lt;Congratulations to Tara on her acceptance! What courses does she plan on<br/>
taking? (If you don&#39;t mind my idle curiosity)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. She is quite excited to get started. She will be the first person<br/>
on both sides of the family to attend a university in ages. Everyone has<br/>
seemed to do tech schools. That&#39;s all well and fine really. Worked out great<br/>
for me. She just sees herself as stepping outside the box. She also got the<br/>
Bright Futures Scholarship. She will be going for business although she<br/>
hasn&#39;t narrowed it down more yet.<br/>
<br/>
I must say that at her age and when I think about myself, she is so<br/>
incredibly determined and eager. She has handled all this on her own. The<br/>
scholarship and college, all the paperwork she&#39;s had to do. My mom took care<br/>
of everything for me and believe me, college then wasn&#39;t like it is now as<br/>
far as getting in. There are so many hoops to jump through. And she&#39;s worked<br/>
the whole time too. Let alone attended school! Blech!! (sorry for the S<br/>
word!)<br/>

I&#39;m ashamed to say I have one of those in my own family. It&#39;s a cousin. We<br/>
were never close but his sister told me he does that with his kids. At 18,<br/>
they have to go. Whether it&#39;s college, tech school or just out and a job,<br/>
they have to go. He has one out already and one getting ready to get out.<br/>
She&#39;s actually taking him in. The other two are still young yet. First two<br/>
are boys, second two are girls. I&#39;m wondering if that will make a<br/>
difference.<br/>

having kids was part of The Plan, there was a lot of pressure from<br/>
family members, friends and co-workers... how lucky that it is also<br/>
part of The Plan that once you have kids, you don&#39;t have to be there<br/>
for them. They can be sent to the hospital nursery right after birth.<br/>
Once they are home, they can be stuck into a crib is a separate room.<br/>
You don&#39;t really have to interuct with your child after that. That&#39;s<br/>
what schools and formula companies are for. (sarcasm, and sorry if I<br/>
am offending someone who couldn&#39;t breastfeed for medical reasons).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>YES. It can come time when you just know it IS time and you are proud <br/>
and happy and ready for kids to go out on their own.  I love my oldest <br/>
daughter with all my heart and miss her terribly when she&#39;s gone, but <br/>
I&#39;m very excited for her and glad she&#39;s venturing out and glad she has <br/>
the urge to become independent and so on. Sometimes, too, older kids <br/>
are really not good roommates - it can be hard living with another <br/>
adult who is also your kid. They ought to be making their own <br/>
decisions, some good and some bad, and it can be hard to be so close to <br/>
them, physically, and still let them make decisions that, as adults, <br/>
they SHOULD be making for themselves. And sometimes kids don&#39;t act <br/>
super nice right around the time they are feeling an urge to move out <br/>
and be independent, because it is hard for them to go and they <br/>
sometimes don&#39;t want things to be quite so great at home, just to make <br/>
it a bit easier. There are all KINDS of situations and I find the above <br/>
statement to be quite judgmental and rude.<br/>
<br/>
When our kids are moving into adulthood, hanging on to them and wishing <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t want to move on and develop independent lives is not <br/>
doing THEM any favors, either. Better to be excited and giddy and happy <br/>
and supportive and encouraging.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-678773981">We have recently had the pleasure of our 20 year old moving back home.  She <br/>
moved in with her boyfriend at almost 19 (been gone about 2 years actually) but <br/>
decided she wants to get debt free, put a lot of money away, and go to Mexico <br/>
to live for a while with her boyfriend.  He moved back in with his brother, <br/>
and they&#39;re both saving their pennies.  <br/>
<br/>
It is sooooo nice having her around again.  Before she left, we squabbled <br/>
much more, but now we are enjoying cooking, gardening, and sewing together.  I <br/>
enjoy being around her and having a second chance to be together.  I like the <br/>
idea of multi-generational families living together!  We have acerage and have <br/>
told the kids they can build their own homes if they want to.  <br/>

time they spend with them. You&#39;re assuming that. They might be people <br/>
who aren&#39;t up for spending all day everyday with their kids, that&#39;s <br/>
all. Now that my kids are getting older, I&#39;m finding that I like my <br/>
alone time more and more, myself. And as much as I&#39;ve loved and enjoyed <br/>
all the time I&#39;ve spent with my children, I can easily understand that <br/>
not everybody enjoys spending all their time with kids, even their own. <br/>
I think it is very sad that some people are put down because they don&#39;t <br/>
have an overwhelming desire to be with their kids morning, noon, and <br/>
night. People are different and children are different - some are easy <br/>
to be with all the time and others are not. Some parents want to be <br/>
with their kids all the time and others who love their kids JUST as <br/>
much, may enjoy the time they spend together just as much even if it <br/>
isn&#39;t ALL the time.<br/>

Wyl about &quot;when he moves out&quot; he gets VERY upset and insists that he will <br/>
live here forever! Ah... so nice to dream. :~) I reassure him that he can stay as <br/>
long as he wants to, but that its okay if he should change his mind. He says <br/>
he won&#39;t. ;~) Ah, isn&#39;t it nice to still be his best friend at 5! I&#39;m <br/>
thrilled!<br/>

In homeschooling circles there is a lot of talk about the &quot;sadness&quot; <br/>
of people wanting their kids in school to the point that they even <br/>
dread school vacations.  I can why that&#39;s a sad state of affairs, <br/>
but at the same time I feel a little twinge of guilt for the times <br/>
when my husband takes the kids somewhere for a half a day and I do a <br/>
little happy dance.<br/>
I love time to myself as much as the next person.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I answered her, yes, there are people who get excited and giddy at the <br/>
thought of their children leaving home because it is a good time for it <br/>
and because the child is excited and happy. I have a daughter who is <br/>
right now in the midst of it and I&#39;m thrilled and excited and happy for <br/>
her. When kids feel the urge to move on at some point and establish <br/>
themselves as independent people, becoming more capable and competent <br/>
and responsible, that&#39;s not something parents have to be sad about and <br/>
why should we NOT be happy and supportive and encouraging. And - what&#39;s <br/>
more - why should we NOT look forward to some time to ourselves and <br/>
time to pursue some of our own interests that might have been put on <br/>
hold while we had children at home. When the time is right, it can feel <br/>
right. I&#39;m not going to feel guilty that I&#39;m glad my daughter, who will <br/>
be almost 20 when she really moves out, wants to go. I&#39;ll miss the <br/>
young girl just like I miss the toddler and the baby she once was, but <br/>
we are moving into a wonderful relationship as two adults and I glory <br/>
in THAT too.<br/>
<br/>
The above comment makes it seem like parents who are glad to see their <br/>
kids grow up and move out don&#39;t love their kids as much as she does, or <br/>
something. I think the opposite is true, really loving them is going to <br/>
mean keeping some of those &quot;sad to see time passing&quot; feelings to <br/>
ourselves, not burdening them with them, and, instead, supporting the <br/>
heady joy and excitement that they experience at that time of <br/>
transition from child to adult. It is a WONDERFUL time for them, why <br/>
should they not be excited and giddy and why should we not share that <br/>
with them?<br/>

--------------------<br/>
<br/>
Even in the rare case in which sex is engaged in for the purpose of getting <br/>
pregnant, the people have No Idea whether they will be good parents or not.  <br/>
It&#39;s not over til it&#39;s over.  There are hormonal factors (does mothering <br/>
instinct kick in really full force or not? some of that is biochemical).  There are <br/>
social factors and other people involved.  Partners bail sometimes.   Partners <br/>
stay and make things worse sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t begin to second guess or to prescribe fixes for people who have <br/>
bigger problems and other priorities than we have.  The best thing we can do here, <br/>
I think, is help those whose situations and personalities and priorities have <br/>
led them to want to unschool, and we can brainstorm and tweak and speculate <br/>
and offer resources to assist.<br/>

There&#39;s something kind of cool about that, though.  <br/>
<br/>
I went to college when I was newly 17.  I came home most weekends (it was 90 <br/>
miles) but not all. <br/>
<br/>
My parents got divorced and before that schoolyear was out, the house had <br/>
been sold, and they&#39;d each moved into smaller places.  I had no home to go back <br/>
to.  That was sad for me.  So when I read about families who have kids over 18 <br/>
and they would still like for them to hang out, stay home, keep your room, I&#39;m <br/>
wistful and a little jealous.<br/>
