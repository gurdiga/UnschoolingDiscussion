 </span></blockquote>Well how do they make a clay tennis court?<br/>
<br/>
My favorite dumb question (from which my kids learned lots about testing and <br/>
precision and divergent thinking) is on a pack of trivia questions--the <br/>
bound-in-one-corner cards called Brain Quest.  It is <br/>
&quot;Which of these uses electricity?  <br/>
&quot;bed<br/>
&quot;lamp<br/>
&quot;table<br/>
&quot;chair&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids just looked at me for the longest time.  (We were playing a <br/>
gambling-for-pennies game.)   We all started laughing.<br/>
<br/>
From being in the SCA and general camping they know of LOTS of non-electric <br/>
lamps.  Oil, candle, propane.  Cylume glow sticks.<br/>
<br/>
From being in life they know of electric beds (hospital beds that adjust, <br/>
beds with massage features, waterbeds with electric heating elements), tables <br/>
(we have a light table, and one with just an outlet on the side for plugging <br/>
in lamps or tools), and &quot;the electric chair&quot; is an idiom on its own, although <br/>
there are other chairs--our elderly neighbor had a chair to lift her up out <br/>
of it; baby rocking swings can be electric (or wind-up).  So we shared all we <br/>
could remember about those appliances with and without electricity, and all <br/>
due to a bad question.<br/>
