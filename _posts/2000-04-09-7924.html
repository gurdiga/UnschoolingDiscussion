<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The right side was another story.  I can&#39;t describe the<br/>
&gt; strange sort of pain I felt.  It wasn&#39;t anything like the normal pain I was<br/>
&gt; feeling on the left side, and it didn&#39;t go away.  For some reason my right<br/>
&gt; breast (especially the nipple)  is very, very sensitive (all the time).  I<br/>
&gt; talked to my doctor who dismissed me saying &quot; no one&#39;s body is perfectly<br/>
&gt; symmetrical.  We&#39;re not exactly the same on both sides - not in shape, size<br/>
&gt; or sensation&quot;.  So, I stopped breastfeeding my son.  I didn&#39;t even try with<br/>
&gt; my next daughter.  I was very discouraged at that point.  When my fourth baby<br/>
&gt; was born, 14 months ago, I did try to nurse her.  She was injured at birth<br/>
&gt; (by the same doctor who gave me the advice on symmetry) and because of low<br/>
&gt; muscle tone she had problems latching on and sucking.  I was totally stressed<br/>
&gt; out!  There was just too much going on.  It was our first year of<br/>
&gt; homeschooling, my baby was hurt, and I knew that to successfully breastfeed<br/>
&gt; her was going to take lots of time and energy (especially since I&#39;d basically<br/>
&gt; be doing it for the first time).  Besides all that I never did figure out<br/>
&gt; what the problem with my right breast was...or is.  So, I quit.  I spent the<br/>
&gt; first few months of her life avoiding some of the very people who<br/>
&gt; could/should have been supporting me.   You know why?  Because I didn&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; to hear the breastfeeding lecture...again.  I know it&#39;s best for the baby!  I<br/>
&gt; know! I know! I know!  And guess what?  I think homeschooling is best for<br/>
&gt; kids.  But I don&#39;t go around preaching about it to every person I meet.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t preach breastfeeding but I do get very upset when I hear stories<br/>
like this. Not because you didn&#39;t breastfeed, but because you got<br/>
inadequate/and or wrong information from your doctor. I hear lots of stories<br/>
similar to yours. My mom wasn&#39;t given a choice. She was told she couldn&#39;t<br/>
breastfeed and was given a shot to dry her up and she wasn&#39;t even allowed to<br/>
try. She wanted to, though. That makes me crazy. I preach patients rights<br/>
and the responsibilty of informing ourselves. I don&#39;t care if women make an<br/>
informed choice not to breastfeed. But I really don&#39;t like when women are<br/>
misinformed or don&#39;t feel they can question the doctor or go against his/her<br/>
advice. I&#39;ve met women who didn&#39;t know they could change doctors if they<br/>
felt the care was inadequate. Or their health plans wouldn&#39;t let them<br/>
change. That makes me nuts.<br/>
<br/>
The baby book my mom had when she was pregnant with me admonished women not<br/>
to talk to any doctors but their own or to talk to other women about what<br/>
their doctors were telling them about pregnancy/birth/breastfeeding. The<br/>
authors thought that would only confuse us poor dears. That was in the 60&#39;s,<br/>
but I know there are doctors who value these same unquestioning and helpless<br/>
attributes in their patients. In my career as a nurse I&#39;ve met doctors who<br/>
didn&#39;t know what they were doing, but that didn&#39;t stop them from giving<br/>
advice/writing orders/doing surgery.<br/>
<br/>
I think informed choice is the key here. I know there are women who choose<br/>
not to inform themselves, but more often I think they are discouraged from<br/>
doing so.<br/>
