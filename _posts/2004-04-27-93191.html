 </span></blockquote>Just in general, it&#39;s worth noting that lots (more every day) of games are <br/>
discussed at length on internet sites.  <br/>
<br/>
There are some great books around with rules for traditional games, too, but <br/>
now with google.com you don&#39;t even need the collections of games books.  (We <br/>
have eight or ten here, and some have striking pictures of game boards and sets <br/>
and....)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We play like this:<br/>
<br/>
Place a pile of four cards, then one, then one, then four again.  Deal the <br/>
rest for two players (21 each).<br/>
<br/>
Each player picks up 4 cards and lay the rest face down in front of you.<br/>
<br/>
Each player turns over one of the center cards, then you both try to play <br/>
your hands until all of your cards are gone by placing cards in order on either <br/>
pile up or down.  If there&#39;s a 2, you can play a 3 or and ACE.  If there&#39;s a <br/>
JACK, you can play a QUEEN or a 10.  And so on.  <br/>
<br/>
Move fast, non stop. If you both can&#39;t play any cards then you each flip one <br/>
card each from the two outer piles of 4 cards to get the game going again.  <br/>
You can only have four cards in your hand at any time.  <br/>
<br/>
If you get stuck and use up all four cards in the 2 outer piles, then stop <br/>
and shuffle the two piles you have and then lay them down and you each flip one <br/>
from those piles and continue.  Whoever uses all their cards first, WINS.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that makes sense :0)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so much fun for the kids, and there is a kids version, an actual boxed <br/>
SPIT game that uses only cards numbered 0-9, with slightly different rules.<br/>

it, it will come roaring back! We used to play in the cafeteria at lunch time! <br/>
LOL Thanks bunches!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-125680155">A few of our local homeschooling families have become addicted to Five Crowns.  Simple enough for 4 year olds and challenging enough to hold the interest of everyone else.  It uses five suits of cards and each hand holds a new challenge.  You can purchase this on-line for 10 bucks...or we made our own out of modifying two decks of cards.  I highly recommend the game.<br/>

We LOVE that game.<br/>
We&#39;ve worn out two decks, and the second time I tried to throw the grubby <br/>
deck away, but guests snagged it on the way to the trash.<br/>
