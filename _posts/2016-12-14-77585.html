<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480634578">In London in September I did three sessions on advanced topics.  I haven’t shared my notes, it wasn’t recorded, but I have one to share today.   <br/>
<br/>
Someone on facebook asked, on her page, for people to share.<br/>
 &quot;What is a NON-POLITICAL opinion you have that is likely to be VERY unpopular? <br/>
Go wild, folks.”<br/>
__________<br/>
<br/>
People were writing wan things like “I don’t like brussel sprouts” and such, but I thought it might be good to step it up to something deeper.  Then I realized this was too deep, so I brought it over here. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I can TOTALLY and fully tie this to unschooling many ways, but at first it might seem not.  As you read (if you read) think of similar problems worth looking out for.  Other examples are welcome, but discussing the details or validity of these particular prejudices would be off topic.  First glean the topic before responding. :-)<br/>
<br/>
_____________________<br/>
I responded:<br/>
_____________________<br/>
<br/>
Abandoning an interest because of politics or morality. <br/>
<br/>
This one is hard to explain, and I know I&#39;m in the minority.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine was a huge fan of Harrison Ford. When he broke up with his wife (15 years or however long ago) she was furious and swore never to watch another movie of his and she gave away her DVDs.<br/>
<br/>
When Michael Jackson was accused of molesting guest children, some people said his songs sucked and he couldn&#39;t dance.<br/>
<br/>
Bill Cosby might be an abusive liar, but there were MANY actors on The Cosby Show who haven&#39;t been accused of crimes. Will their body of work be buried because some people can&#39;t separate an actor from a performance? Chicken Heart and Noah (comedy routines from the 1960&#39;s, made when Cosby was young) are still great. Fat Albert cartoons—they are innocent of any crime.<br/>
<br/>
NOT A POPULAR OPINION, mine, but if someone claims to value work/product, but then flips out about something personal, it seems to me they were worshipping a person, and not appreciating music or abilities.<br/>
___________________<br/>
I added next day:<br/>
___________________<br/>
<br/>
Mel Gibson is another in my list of &quot;Yes, he went crazy but before that...&quot; folks. People&#39;s judgments of good and bad have a huge aspect of morality and of us-vs.them, and I suppose it&#39;s natural and instinctive, but when we&#39;re trying hard to control that to be open minded and accepting of people who are different, it seems to burst out inappropriately, as it&#39;s stored up and repressed. That&#39;s my theory of why those prejudices seem justified, when a performer has sinned.<br/>
<br/>
________________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
End of quotes.<br/>
<br/>
Between my first explanation and the addition of one more actor, there were these comments:<br/>
<br/>
Other #1: Yes, I agree, but often struggle with that issue. Is that what&#39;s meant by throwing the baby out with the bathwater?<br/>
<br/>
Me: Partly, probably, yeah. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Other #2:   Honestly ? I feel that way about President Clinton.I thought he was a good President..and a crappy crappy husband who made poor choices.<br/>
<br/>
________<br/>
<br/>
That last one skirts getting it back into politics, so try not to do that, as you’re thinking and responding.  <br/>
<br/>
If there are outside links to any research or explanation for why humans are this way, those would be find to bring.<br/>
<br/>
I know that was long, but so is life and if it helps you live better, think better, and make better decisions, it will have been worth reading and thinking about it.<br/>

<br/>
I think people in part identify who they are by what they love. If I love to <br/>
paint, I&#39;m and artist, I have an artistic soul, (whatever that is) I&#39;m <br/>
creative. If I love Harrison Ford, I&#39;m a person who recognizes talent. I&#39;m <br/>
discerning.<br/>
<br/>
But then here comes our evolutionary history as social creatures. We shame <br/>
bad behavior with punishment or shunning. I can abandon Harrison Ford, and <br/>
in doing so I&#39;m reaffirming my place in the moral majority, I&#39;m finding <br/>
safety in consensus.<br/>
<br/>
We like people to be one thing. We want good guys to be just good, and bad <br/>
guys to be plainly bad so we can easily recognize the positions we&#39;re <br/>
supposed to take. The guy who beats his partner should not be the same guy <br/>
who gives us free fruit at the vegetable stand, who rescued a puppy, who <br/>
donates blood. It makes it too hard to find our moral high ground.<br/>
<br/>
When we find out something unpleasant about someone we love, someone we&#39;re <br/>
close to, we can weigh our experience with them against their crime. We can <br/>
make excuses for what they&#39;ve done because we know their history. That&#39;s not <br/>
available to us when it comes to famous people.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s also a matter of the convenience of our moral position. It&#39;s not <br/>
hard to give away all the Harrison Ford dvds, but it&#39;s very inconvenient to <br/>
cut off all ties with the bus driver who takes us to work everyday, even if <br/>
he deserted his wife.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732110424">-=-I think most people feel their moral outrage impresses people around them whose good opinion they value. If more people knew their moral outrage can also make them seem shallow and self serving, they might consider their positions more carefully. Maybe not. Shame on them!-=-<br/>
<br/>
This might be worth saying, too, but probably not.<br/>
<br/>
One thing people can’t recover from is low verbal and logical skill, so it’s not nice, I keep thinking, to discuss very complicated things where nice people who can’t understand it are.  They might start looking for moral failings in me as justification for taking all their friends and shunning me. :-)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-737678934">Oops.<br/>
I posted something here I thought was private.<br/>
The only defense I can make is that I opted not to discuss this topic on my facebook discussion group.  Always Learning is the highest-level discussion of unschooling left in the world.  <br/>
Sorry I marred it some, recklessly.<br/>
<br/>
This all ties in to another advanced topic I discussed in London, and that’s reputation.  So I might have lost some points in some people’s reckoning.  Sorry.  Maybe I can earn back, and maybe not. :-)<br/>

<br/>
I had also thought (but not written) that it’s one of my failings to be snobby about verbal ability.  In person, I have friends who aren’t great speakers but who know lots and are worth drawing out.  In an all-in-writing forum it’s harder to appreciate other skills, where words are all we have.  <br/>
<br/>
And I had hoped my second post in this topic would be less awkward and more solid.  I wanted to say that it’s good to have a checklists of one’s own prejudices in mind before rejecting ideas by someone. <br/>
<br/>
My personal list includes:  Texans, New York City, high heels…. there are some other things.  But if someone in high heels with a NYC accent starts telling me what I should do, I have a hard time hearing a word of it.  It’s just me.  So I try to listen before I run away.  I’ve learned a lot from various Texans, but only the best of it from the best of them, because I first go idea-deaf and only hear the accent.<br/>
<br/>
Surely there are people who don’t like things about me. I listed things, in the London presentation.  I said not to dig around for stuff not to like about me—I could make a list.<br/>
American<br/>
fat<br/>
female<br/>
only has a bachelor’s degree, in... as Marty my son said with a bit of comical derision: “Mom, you studied your native language.”  <br/>
southwest / New Mexico<br/>
“just a mom”<br/>
<br/>
I wasn’t always fat.  I wasn’t always “just a mom.”  But people see you where and when they see you, and you can only “earn points” in that context—how helpful were you?  How useful, or amusing, or whatever they needed?<br/>

<br/>
I think anyone suffering too severely from those things might have left <br/>
AlwaysLearning early on. :)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot I don&#39;t understand but I can wait it out. It&#39;s sometimes <br/>
discussions where I feel completely lost that inspire some new thinking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***I wanted to say that it’s good to have a checklists of one’s own <br/>

<br/>
Peter Boghossian, a philosophy instructor at Portland State University, has <br/>
suggested that a useful tool in identifying our own shortcomings might be to <br/>
ask, &quot;How might this belief be wrong&quot; or, &quot;how might I be wrong.&quot; I like <br/>
that very much, but it also takes me a long time to consider how I might be <br/>
wrong, and that inhibits me when I&#39;m crammed with witty rebuttal.  How might <br/>
this be wrong?<br/>
<br/>
***I said not to dig around for stuff not to like about me—I could make a <br/>
list.***<br/>
<br/>
There are more reasons for people do dislike me than to like me. I&#39;ve known <br/>
it always, and I care even less now than I did when I was young.  I can add <br/>
that to the list. But, to my beloved few I have been kind and useful, and <br/>
I&#39;m satisfied with that. :)<br/>
