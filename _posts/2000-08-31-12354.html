&lt;&lt; I think a journal for each would be in order.  What a great gift but <br/>
instead<br/>
of for their wedding I think on the birth of their first child!!!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this is great, i do it for my kids, i jot notes into the empty spaces on my <br/>
daily calendar, then about once every coupla months i transfer to their <br/>
journals.  i use creative memories journal pages and permanent pens for <br/>
longevity... ive only been doing it for two years and already it is fun, <br/>
interesting and helpful too to go back and see who was doing what and when!<br/>

&lt;&lt; a series of books by the Giselle <br/>
Institute,<br/>
Your one year old, your two year old and so on &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
just wanted to second these books.  they really have helped me occasionally <br/>
in the past when i could read them and realize not only the range of normalcy <br/>
for the age appropriate behavior, but also learn a little about the WHY <br/>
behind what was happening with the kid.<br/>
