Good luck.  The tv question is an issue for me.  My wanting them to do<br/>
what they want to do is certainly challenged by the lulling, siren call<br/>
of TV.  I would suggest you check out the Holt site:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.holtgws.com/index.htm">http://www.holtgws.com/index.htm</a> for information and support.  Also<br/>
check out naturalchild project (see below)  Read &quot;The Fear of Being<br/>
Permissive&quot; archived there.  If you have limits on your internet access<br/>
I could email you a copy of that article.<br/>
<br/>
I would imagine if you were doing the &quot;homeschool&quot; route with an<br/>
emphasis on the school part there will be a considerable period of<br/>
adjustment while you get up to speed on what unschooling really means<br/>
and for your kids to adjust to the idea that they really are trusted to<br/>
come to know themselves and their own interests.<br/>
<br/>
My six year old has just started to pick out words she recognizes.  Her<br/>
sister did this at three.  I really have 95% come to believe that it<br/>
doesn&#39;t make any difference when people get to the things they think are<br/>
important except that they be the one&#39;s to decide what those things are<br/>
and when they should learn them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-24252192">I am an unschooler that periodically gets worried and imposes some academic<br/>
requirements (other than reading, which we do daily and is a joy for all).<br/>
<br/>
This was the case before my son took the 5th grade standardized test.  We<br/>
spent time most days working through &quot;Scoring High&quot; in preparation of the<br/>
test--both to learn test-taking skills and cover material we might not have<br/>
touched upon (turned out to be a quick way of learning some grammar).<br/>
<br/>
Now, having taken the test, I am back to letting my son do what he wants<br/>
(except--no &quot;screen time&quot; until my nap in the afternoon).  I am<br/>
rediscovering the joys of unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
My son is pursuing  his various interests:  Roller Coaster Tycoon,<br/>
carpentry, Little League, Karate, riding his dirt bike, listening to us<br/>
read aloud, mowing our large yard, taking care of his chickens, and<br/>
starting a mowing business (he has one customer).  He is also asking<br/>
interesting questions.  <br/>
<br/>
I am enjoying my role as facilitator.  I get info on the various questions<br/>
he asks: &quot;Why do most pictures of teeth show two roots but his baby teeth<br/>
didn&#39;t have any?&quot;--this led to reading about teeth and doing an experiment<br/>
with eggs.  &quot;What is the difference between hail and snow?&quot; This led to a<br/>
family discussion and looking up many references until we felt we<br/>
understood the basic differences.  &quot;How can I catch bass in our pond?&quot;  We<br/>
went to the library, found a couple of excellent books on fishing, he<br/>
talked with 2 friends about fishing and what lures, etc. to use, we have<br/>
gone fishing.  &quot;I wish I could draw better.&quot;  We attended &quot;Art all Morning&quot;<br/>
and he learned some pointers for drawing faces.  <br/>
<br/>
We are having a wonderful time.  I am reminded, as I need to be time and<br/>
again, that my son is naturally curious and that much will be learned by<br/>
pursuing his interests.  <br/>
<br/>
I would love to read about other&#39;s experiences.<br/>

I had to pop in here. Isn&#39;t it great when something like this happens?<br/>
My 12yr old dd has been out of ps since last may and is very <br/>
unmotivated.  Yesterday I bought this *Who dunnit* project pack.  She <br/>
saw this among the shopping and looked at it with interest. We then <br/>
spent the next 3 hours (at her request) trying to discover *who <br/>
dunnit*.  You have to solve all the clues to be able to do this - the <br/>
clues include maths = games - map reading  - lots of reading.  Some <br/>
of the clues were really quite hard.  We did not get the right <br/>
answere - but we did have a lot of fun.<br/>
<br/>
And, dare i say, I think I&#39;ve got it!!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bridget<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your system, as I recall it, included things like writing. <br/>
I believe that was the point of contention. Not housework.<br/>
To me there is a difference in requiring my children to do chores and <br/>
help out our family in our everyday lives, and requiring them to <br/>
learn thing that I believe are important to know.  The former deals <br/>
with the immediate ( a livable environment, a sane mother ;-/, <br/>
respect for each other and their things....,) the latter has nothing <br/>
to do with me personally and I would feel hugely invasive, and wrong <br/>
if I tried to make my children practice writing or math or ....as if <br/>
I knew more than them, where there interests and passions lie.  As if <br/>
I didn&#39;t trust in their intelligence.<br/>
I know non coercive parents don&#39;t see the line that I do, and <br/>
intellectually, I don&#39;t really either, but emotionally, I haven&#39;t <br/>
been able to live in this household without having some control over <br/>
the immediate environment.  I accept that, and while I know/feel it <br/>
is a shortcoming on my part, it is one that I can live with while <br/>
striving to be as respectful and mindful(though I fail miserably at <br/>
times) as possible.<br/>
Anyway...Do you deny that you require certain school type stuff from <br/>
your children, even if it is part of a larger choice?(your list, as I <br/>
recall).   Simply by putting writing on that list implies an <br/>
importance to you, and a mistrust that writing will be learned, <br/>
because your children will, on their own, come to see it as a vital <br/>
part of their lives.(or not, and therefore don&#39;t really need to do <br/>
much of it).  Requiring anything implies a mistrust in the person to <br/>
do it on their own(as I have done with my children and my household <br/>
rules),  If I ever extend that into areas of their education, I would <br/>
no longer consider myself an unschooling parent.<br/>
That&#39;s my take on it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I cannot proclaim what unschooling is. I can only say what my interpretation <br/>
of it is. I don&#39;t think of myself as at the beck and call of anyone. If my <br/>
son needs me, I&#39;m his mother, I love him and I respond. If my own mother or a <br/>
friend called for love and support, I&#39;d probably put away my needlepoint to <br/>
offer what I could. I wouldn&#39;t consider this beck and call, I&#39;d call it being <br/>
available to my loved ones. I wouldn&#39;t say, sorry, I need some alone time <br/>
right now, and I don&#39;t want you to get the wrong idea about our relationship.<br/>
Expecations is a heavy word. I can&#39;t honestly say I don&#39;t have any, but I can <br/>
honestly say I don&#39;t verbalize or enforce any. I would have a problem with a <br/>
child who grew up in my home and laid around doing nothing for years while <br/>
everyone else slaved away to take care of him. I don&#39;t see this as the <br/>
logical end to my own parenting method. I believe my son (and generally any <br/>
child) naturally wants to help, be a part of, etc. Sure there are times when <br/>
he doesn&#39;t want to do stuff, there are times when I don&#39;t either. And <br/>
sometimes, it&#39;s ok. I think when I push myself or my son too hard without <br/>
some just do nothing time is when we see more resistance. As others have said <br/>
on here, when you take away the have-to philosophy and the word chore, it&#39;s <br/>
just something else to do together.<br/>
My own parents insisted that if they didn&#39;t force me to eat well, I wouldn&#39;t. <br/>
Well, left alone to decide what *I* wanted, I now eat healthier than they do.<br/>
I also do massage therapy and one of the biggest things I learned in school <br/>
is that a lot of people (children included) don&#39;t need someone to *fix* them. <br/>
They need a space to be. An open, unconditionally loving space to just relax <br/>
and be. And when they have that space, they start to heal themselves. I&#39;ve <br/>
experienced this personally and I can&#39;t think of a better way to parent than <br/>
to give children the love and space they need, and watch them grow and <br/>
blossom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-605700414">Hello,<br/>
  I was thinking about what Bridget said -not expecting anything from<br/>
children. I don&#39;t call myself an unschooler, I might be there in theory, but<br/>
I still seem to have one foot on shore, this list really does help, even the<br/>
arguing aspect. Growing up in my family, arguing was a sport.<br/>
Anyway, I could be way off, but the beauty of unschooling is that things<br/>
work out more peacefully and better than if I was orchestrating everything.<br/>
My kids are younger, so maybe I am clueless about I will be expecting in the<br/>
future. So far, my kids are mostly considerate of their family and friends,<br/>
so they naturally help out and learn.<br/>
I want my children to figure out their own expectations for themselves, and<br/>
I will definitely be part of that, but I don&#39;t want my expectations to<br/>
stifle theirs.<br/>
Now, what would I do if I had a 15 year old that wanted to get married or go<br/>
in to the illegal drug business? I might be very imposing.<br/>

also unschool parenting, and unschoolers who don&#39;t.  I know there are <br/>
unschoolers who believe children must never be made to do anything they <br/>
don&#39;t want to, but I&#39;d think they are a subset of unschoolers.  Like <br/>
unschoolers are a subset of unschoolers.  I think I&#39;m tying myself up in <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This very much misrepresents the exchange. Or the entire disucssion was a<br/>
misunderstanding about what people were saying was not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I pulled the quotes from your original message that were being objected to.<br/>
They were about *academics*. You didn&#39;t explain (despite the fact that I<br/>
posted them twice and asked twice) how it could be child-led, uncoerced,<br/>
natural learning if you&#39;re determining that a specific amount must be done<br/>
in order for the learning to take place. I *understand* that you have this<br/>
on your chores chart. I *understand* you put it there for convenience sake.<br/>
<br/>
But for those trying to understand how kids can learn what *they* need to<br/>
know (as opposed to what others say they need to know) by pursuing what<br/>
interests them, it is confusing if someone says it&#39;s unschooling to insist<br/>
that something needs to be learned in a particular way.<br/>
<br/>
To me, an unschooling approach would be to give a child information she&#39;s<br/>
lacking in order to make an informed choice. For instance, let her know that<br/>
colleges *may* expect more writing than she&#39;s used to. (It really depends on<br/>
the college and the course of study she pursues.) She may or may not feel<br/>
that&#39;s a problem.<br/>
<br/>
If she does, there are many ways to approach it. She could take a community<br/>
college course. She could find a program and go through it on her own. She<br/>
could post to message boards. She could find pen pals. She could write in a<br/>
journal. She could write articles for the local paper. She could write to<br/>
some students at the colleges she&#39;s thinking of and *ask* how much writing<br/>
is involved. (Colleges generally have some students who volunteer to host<br/>
others.) Or other options. She could ask mom to remind her.<br/>
<br/>
If *she* insists writing 500 words each week is the best approach and *she*<br/>
insists she needs someone to *make* her do it each week and punish her if<br/>
she doesn&#39;t, then that&#39;s an area to discuss.<br/>
<br/>
It might be motherly (or following your heart or &quot;common sense&quot; or whatever<br/>
you&#39;d care to label it nor not label it) to insist it is a problem and she<br/>
needs to do something about it. And if someone wants to do that, then they<br/>
should do that. But it&#39;s unfair to others trying to understand unschooling<br/>
to call it unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It would be unschooling to know that she&#39;s the best judge of who she is and<br/>
what *she* needs and to know that she needs to make the decisions that feel<br/>
right for her. If she later finds out the decision had consequences she<br/>
hadn&#39;t anticipated, then she&#39;s learned something else and can then reassess<br/>
the problem and seek a new solution.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to learn to write is by writing for real, personally meaningful<br/>
reasons. If the kids aren&#39;t writing without someone reminding them, then it<br/>
isn&#39;t real or personally meaningful to them. It may be a &quot;chore&quot; they choose<br/>
over cleaning the toilet, but it isn&#39;t child led learning anymore than<br/>
choosing an apple over dog food is child-led eating.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to write a lot is by having real deadlines for real reasons.<br/>
She&#39;ll be getting those (sort of) in college. (Only sort of because the<br/>
consequences are all made up. Unlike in the business world, neither the<br/>
world nor the college will be a better or worse place if a paper is or isn&#39;t<br/>
turned in. Colleges have to make up consequences -- grades -- so that there<br/>
are consequences to doing or not doing homework.) There will be a real<br/>
reason for doing the writing to a certain standard and she will have full<br/>
freedom to do it or not do it, knowing the consequences are not negotiable.<br/>
<br/>
To me, anyway, writing as a chore is even further removed from real actions<br/>
being tied to real consequences since the chore consequences don&#39;t depend<br/>
specifically on the writing. The purpose of writing should be to communicate<br/>
something to someone else for a real reason. (As I&#39;m doing here.) Not to<br/>
fulfill a word limit. The consequences of writing well or not writing well<br/>
are not gaining or losing car privileges (or whatever) but communicating or<br/>
not communicating. Writing in order to get 500 words onto the page won&#39;t<br/>
have the same result as writing because *the writer wants* to change<br/>
someone&#39;s mind about something, or tell them something they didn&#39;t know<br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, here&#39;s the quotes:<br/>
<br/>
the word &quot;MY&quot; in &quot;as long as it meets my basic standards of HOW MUCH.&quot; (in<br/>
reference to writing each week.)<br/>
<br/>
the words &quot;have to&quot; in &quot;they have to write (physically)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And there was another quote a few days later that said your daughter<br/>
(paraphrasing since I&#39;ve emptied my deleted items folder) &quot;had to get used<br/>
to writing this much in college each week.&quot;<br/>

what they are capable of -- pick up you stuff and put it somewhere.  But we <br/>
are nice to each other -- most of the time. It&#39;s just not gushy -- it&#39;s <br/>

&lt;&lt; Now, what would I do if I had a 15 year old that wanted to get married or <br/>
go<br/>
in to the illegal drug business? I might be very imposing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some people will say &quot;By then it will be too late.&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s a lot of the defense of those who will say right in English that they <br/>
&quot;keep their kids on a short leash.&quot;  We have some relatives who are totally <br/>
strict with their kids, still telling them what to wear when they&#39;re young <br/>
teens, still forcing them to go to church and family functions whether they <br/>
want to or not.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re pretty sure they&#39;re preventing those children from wanting to get <br/>
married at 15 or going into the illegal drug business.<br/>
<br/>
Then we have other friends and relatives (and we keep trying to more like <br/>
them) who spend a lot of time with their kids discussing why one way of <br/>
dressing for a particular activity is better than another, and why it might <br/>
be particularly nice if the would buck up and go to this birthday party or <br/>
that reception.<br/>
<br/>
Unless a family is willing to take &quot;no&quot; for an answer (and it&#39;s usually, &quot;I&#39;d <br/>
really rather not mom, is that okay?&quot; and never &quot;NO&quot;), they will never be <br/>
able to have the pure joy of a &quot;Sure, I&#39;ll go&quot; or &quot;You&#39;re right--that t-shirt <br/>
would offend grandma&quot; or whatever other well-thought-out positive response <br/>
they get when the child has the models and understanding and opportunity and <br/>
desire to be courteous and compassionate.<br/>
<br/>
I know personally, in my youth and now, people who will purposely be <br/>
offensive and purposely uncooperative, because they just got tired of not <br/>
having a choice, and not being respected, and when they got a chance to leave <br/>
they did.  <br/>
<br/>
When being home with the parents is pleasant and warm, dealing drugs or <br/>
marrying the first willing person who comes along aren&#39;t sensible, good <br/>
options.  <br/>
<br/>
I know two homeschooled girls who married early.  In both cases they were the <br/>
oldest girls in families with other kids and the parents just expected them <br/>
to take care of all those kids, more than was reasonable, and didn&#39;t give <br/>
them freedom or opportunity to get out on their own much.  Both married older <br/>
guys, to get out.  I know one was 16 and the other was, I think, seventeen.  <br/>
Neither was unschooled.  Neither had a mom who seemed warmly interested in <br/>
them personally.  <br/>
<br/>
I figure every good example and every bad example helps those who see them <br/>
and consider them.  I started learning what kind of person to be from the <br/>
time I could look around and see which of my relatives and neighbors were <br/>
nice and which weren&#39;t, and which were helpful and which were just hard-eyed <br/>
and mean.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Bridget<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your system, as I recall it, included things like writing. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really don&#39;t want to be discussing my system anymore but this statement<br/>
keeps popping back up again and again.  Yes there are some things<br/>
considered (by those who differentiate) schoolwork on our jobs list.  The<br/>
list was worked out by all of us together and was working great.  My<br/>
girls asked for a little more &#39;guidance&#39; with schoolwork.  I gave them<br/>
the bare minimum of suggestion.  Things like do a science experiment or<br/>
write something.  The list is always up for revision.  If anyone is<br/>
unhappy with any part of it, it is up for discussion (well not the<br/>
dishes).  <br/>
But my point here has less to do with how our family &#39;works&#39; and more to<br/>
do with the fact that we have been over this repeatedly and I am still<br/>
being told that I &#39;require&#39; writing.   <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I believe that was the point of contention. Not housework.<br/>
&gt; To me there is a difference in requiring my children to do chores  and <br/>
&gt; help out our family in our everyday lives, and requiring them to <br/>
&gt; learn thing that I believe are important to know.  The former deals <br/>
&gt; with the immediate ( a livable environment, a sane mother ;-/, <br/>
&gt; respect for each other and their things....,) the latter has nothing  <br/>
&gt; to do with me personally and I would feel hugely invasive, and wrong  <br/>
&gt; if I tried to make my children practice writing or math or ....as if <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I NEVER tell them what to learn or think or believe.  The only parts of<br/>
their lives that I have a definitive &#39;say&#39; over are the parts that affect<br/>
us all - things like &quot;No Rachel, your painting project can&#39;t tie up the<br/>
dining room table indefinitely - put it on the porch table please.&quot; <br/>
Of course that is why I have one witch, one militant agnostic one<br/>
pantheist and one undecided living here with me, the tree worshipper<br/>
(Druids - we don&#39;t worship the trees, we worship WITH the trees.)  I<br/>
believe it is their right to decide what they believe.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you deny that you require certain school type stuff from <br/>
&gt;  your children, even if it is part of a larger choice?(your list, as <br/>
&gt; I  recall).   Simply by putting writing on that list implies an <br/>
&gt; importance to you, and a mistrust that writing will be learned, <br/>
&gt; because your children will, on their own, come to see it as a vital <br/>
&gt; part of their lives.(or not, and therefore don&#39;t really need to do <br/>
&gt; much of it).  Requiring anything implies a mistrust in the person to <br/>
&gt;  do it on their own(as I have done with my children and my household <br/>
&gt; rules),  If I ever extend that into areas of their education, I <br/>
&gt; would  no longer consider myself an unschooling parent.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s my take on it.<br/>
&gt; Joanna<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t deny that there are suggections for &#39;schoolwork&#39; on the list.  I<br/>
do deny that it is MY list.  It is OUR list.  And as for what is tied to<br/>
it, Jenni has never had any problems with the household stuff.  Rachel<br/>
has some medical problems and when she gets to doing nothing, the list is<br/>
an acurate indicator that she needs help - either help avoiding allergens<br/>
or a medication adjustment.  When Rachel is out of whack physically, she<br/>
looses my mothers car.  The list just tells us when that is happening so<br/>
we can catch it earlier.<br/>
As for overseeing their &#39;education&#39;, I wish . . .  I am sick to death of<br/>
hearing about hydraulic brakes and locomotive wheel bases, but I still<br/>
have to feign interest anyway.<br/>
<br/>
As I explained before, the list is not about me imposing MY household<br/>
rules on them.  It is about the fact that my husband could not<br/>
disassociate himself from certain things.  I sat down with the girls and<br/>
talked about what needed done and why it was unfair to expect him to keep<br/>
doing it.  The list just defines what has to get done without his help.<br/>
It is as much for his benefit as any of the rest of us.  It just works<br/>
backwards for him.   He in not allowed to do anything on the list<br/>
(generally - there have been exceptions) when he gets home from a 10 hour<br/>
day at work.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care if you don&#39;t want to consider us unschoolers or not.  At<br/>
this point I think I would like to NOT be confused with the few here who<br/>
keep attacking my home life, so maybe I prefer not to be called that at<br/>
this point.  But the one thing I can say for sure is that I am tired of<br/>
explaining the same things over and over again as if I have not said it<br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
Bridget<br/>
<br/>
PS - They KNOW how to string words together.  The suggestion arose<br/>
because Rachel wants to go to college in the spring and I think (from<br/>
personal experience) that it would be helpful if she got used to writing<br/>
now.  (Physically writing - you know as in taking notes and writing<br/>
tests.)  So we put it on the list.  She has, to my knowledge written a<br/>
few things but not much.  In three weeks or so, I think I&#39;ve seen one<br/>
page.<br/>
<br/>
PPS - Someone else said they don&#39;t call it a &#39;chore&#39; it is just something<br/>
they can do together.  That attitude would get a hearty laugh here.  My<br/>
girls have a great sense of wordplay.  I suspect if I told them about<br/>
that, they would decide to start calling all chores &quot;Fred&quot; or &quot;Albert&quot;. <br/>
As in &quot;Who&#39;s doing that Fred today?&quot;  They are firm believers in  &quot;A rose<br/>
would smell as sweet by any other name.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~<br/>

It&#39;s easier to euthanize mutts than petts.  It&#39;s easier to drown curs than <br/>
puppies. <br/>
<br/>
When a 30 year old engineer is called &quot;a girl&quot; by the male engineers she <br/>

if they just take the whole leap and call her an engineer.<br/>

A child who is called &quot;stupid&quot; will not recover as well as one who is spared <br/>

<br/>
Words have power, and calling something a requirement or a chore both <br/>
reflects and creates a reality.<br/>
<br/>
The point of Juliet&#39;s speech which was paraphrased &lt;&lt; &quot;A rose<br/>
would smell as sweet by any other name&quot;&gt;&gt; was that as a teen she did NOT <br/>
understand the harsh reality of the fact that she and Romeo were parts of <br/>
real families and had real names.  They could not, ultimately, survive the <br/>
reality just by wishing it away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528883031">Thanks for the reply.  I&#39;m sorry if I made you repeat yourself, but <br/>
you have given me a clearer picture of what you&#39;ve been trying to say.<br/>
I think I am sensative(and maybe others too) to the idea of asking <br/>
for anything schooly to be done because it would be,for me, a major <br/>
slip in my growth into unschooling.  Like was said in another post <br/>
from you, we are coming at this from different perspectives.  I think <br/>
it would be helpful to remember that many people come at this <br/>
philosophy, fighting the urge to control their childrens learning.  <br/>
So many are around them, doing the &quot;school&quot; thing, and this is a <br/>
place to come where you can be reminded that children don&#39;t need <br/>
that. Infact, seem to benefit greatly without that.  For some people, <br/>
that is way easier to see than others.  It is way easier for me now, <br/>
than it was a year or two ago.  <br/>
Anyway, I hope this explains a little of the strife here.<br/>

&gt; Good question.  I guess we have to accept that there<br/>

&gt; I know there are <br/>

and I extend that choice into other aspects of their lives, except when it <br/>
comes down to their safety. I feel that way even though one of my children <br/>
goes to school, we are still an unschooling family. I feel this way, because <br/>
he choose to go to school, he loves being there and he knows he will always <br/>
have that choice. I don&#39;t have the early morning battles over getting up, <br/>
eating... and all that. He loves going. My daughter on the other hand, hated <br/>
getting up, resisted eating so early in the morning... since we changed to a <br/>
more child-led lifestyle last year, our lives have been much smoother. This <br/>
is not to say that my children make all the decisions, and my husband and I <br/>
just stand by and let it happen. If I think its time to do something, or go <br/>
somewhere, we do so. My kids don&#39;t get to say no, they are too young to be <br/>
left alone. If one of my children were to say &quot;Im not going to do the dishes <br/>
today, I am going to do something else.&quot; this is not acceptable as they both <br/>
have to participate in daily living activities that benefit the family as a <br/>
whole. But should my daughter say &quot;I don&#39;t want tuna for lunch&quot;, even though <br/>
I had fixed it, I would tell her she is welcome to fix something else, <br/>
whereas a year ago I would have told her &quot;Im not a short order cook, I fixed <br/>
tuna, we are having tuna.&quot; I think being an unschooler is one thing, letting <br/>
that part of your life into other aspects of you life can take some courage. <br/>
We have found it easy to do this, for the most part. I just couldn&#39;t see <br/>
unschooling becoming an all encompassing part of our lives. There are some <br/>
areas of the traditional parent/child relationship I am not willing to give <br/>
up. <br/>
