<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985474074">Hi all,<br/>
I guess that this feeling comes from years of doing what was expected<br/>
of me (external motivation). Now I am free to do what I want and I am<br/>
lost (no internal motivation). I am hoping that I just need to<br/>
deschool myself longer (20 years equals almost 2 years so...do you<br/>
deschool work years too??)&lt;g&gt; I need to find out who I am and what I<br/>
want to do along side my children. (14.10,7)  I tend to gravitate to<br/>
somewhat schooly things (reading, naming, lists, attempts at<br/>
organizing). I was drawn to WTM because I thought it would be neat to<br/>
trek in an orderly fashion through time and do lots of history and lit<br/>
stuff that I missed in school.  We have dumped any such plan<br/>
(regardless of how relaxed our version was). The kids certainly have a<br/>
better idea of what they want to do. Maybe I should just do it for me?<br/>
 But this seems too schooly? I don&#39;t feel like I have an artsy,<br/>
spontaneous bone in my body. Has anyone struggled with this and can<br/>
recommend some reading/activities that may have helped you<br/>
reawaken/rediscover your passions?  Very sad that I am still looking<br/>
for someone to &quot;tell me what to do&quot;  Yikes!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775766343">Hi Beth<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in the same boat. Strongly wanting a &quot;passion&quot; to guide me, so I <br/>
have something cool to do, to bring my kids up alongside. And feeling <br/>
like a dullard. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra has a deschooling &quot;prescription&quot;, and one of the things that I <br/>
did, on her advice, was to make a list of everything I have ever <br/>
learned. Sat at the puter and just started rattling away. That helped <br/>
a lot. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/deschooling">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a> this link will take you to <br/>
that article.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, I&#39;ve &quot;seen&quot; the things I do. Not artsy or off the wall, <br/>
and none of them a &quot;passion&quot; without which I would be miserable <br/>
(except maybe the reading), but enjoyable things that I do and have <br/>
always done, with the kids, or without them: taking walks and <br/>
observing nature, writing, reading, piano, bird watching, herbs, <br/>
chickens, simplifying my lifestyle (becoming less <br/>
consumeristic)...etc. Yours are going to be different. Listing <br/>
everything I ever learned was a very good beginning for me.<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps<br/>
<br/>
peace, HeidiC<br/>

This is old, but I don&#39;t remember it being discussed.  Maybe my memory&#39;s just <br/>
gone, but as it was about to pass out of my mailbox I just wanted to throw it <br/>
back in here to see wether you&#39;re still feeling frustrated a month later.<br/>

My best suggestions would be that when you had a choice between doing <br/>
something schooly and something NOT, that you choose the non-schooly thing, for a <br/>
while at least, just to change paths.<br/>

&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you did this, Sandra. It&#39;s been a few months for me, and I&#39;m <br/>
still feeling doubt about this, quite a bit of the time. Like Beth, I <br/>
feel like a bit of a dullard, like I don&#39;t have the interests or <br/>
passions about life, to lead my kids this way in excellence. <br/>
Modeling &quot;computer&quot; and &quot;reading&quot; LOL that&#39;s what I seem to be doing. <br/>
Getting off my duff once in a blue moon to take care of the barest <br/>
minimum of housekeeping and the house DOES look it, believe me. <br/>
Depressing. <br/>
<br/>
although, with company coming over on Friday, we will be getting busy <br/>
with housework today and tomorrow, so that&#39;ll be better, the house <br/>
part of things. I just have such a lethargy about everything. Like, <br/>
giving my kids permission to do what they want, has led to me doing <br/>
ONLY what I &quot;want&quot; and not any of my duties or responsibilities, and <br/>
the house (and yard, btw) look it. No energy. Lots of apathy.<br/>
<br/>
This can&#39;t be good.<br/>
<br/>
However, I must say I&#39;m seeing some good things from my kids. We have <br/>
a broken leg in the house, which means the TV is not only on a lot, <br/>
but upstairs, and...actually gets turned off and stays off, for a <br/>
large portion of every day. This is not something I expected: by <br/>
choice, the kids, even the kid on her back on the couch, opting OUT <br/>
of the TV watching. wow. But youse told me, they would eventually. It <br/>
could very well be, the TV (and maybe even the computer games) will <br/>
become &quot;just another thing to do&quot; around here.<br/>
<br/>
And, Katie whose leg it is that is broken...playing cribbage <br/>
yesterday, was doing some pretty cool math. For instance, when her <br/>
points added up to an even number, she was breaking it down into two <br/>
moves. e.g. 18 points, she&#39;d move her piece and count 9, and then <br/>
count 9 again. Who taught her that? Not I. She is full of little math <br/>
surprises like that. <br/>
<br/>
Last night, Abbie my 15 year old, signed off of chat, and then sat in <br/>
a chair shaking her head and saying &quot;I&#39;ve got to do something about <br/>
this chat addiction&quot; *eyebrows up* You mean, I didn&#39;t need to SAY <br/>
THAT to her? She figured it out on HER OWN? wow<br/>
<br/>
And Robby&#39;s willingness to pitch in has increased. Eye contact, too. <br/>
Robby, the one who&#39;s been &quot;schooled&quot; the most, whom I have worried <br/>
about the most, is turning off the computer games voluntarily, is <br/>
talking to me excitedly about things (including his latest level in <br/>
his latest puter game!), is making eye contact, is saying &quot;okay&quot; <br/>
without a whine or complaint when asked to feed the chickens or <br/>
whatever...*sniff* *dab* I think our relationship is getting good <br/>
again *dab*<br/>
<br/>
so it isn&#39;t the kids I&#39;m worried about anymore...it&#39;s me. An <br/>
introverted literary type who enjoys reading more than anything, <br/>
whose house is falling apart around her ears because she&#39;s <br/>
been &quot;doing what she wants&quot; (Reading) and not taking care of things. <br/>
<br/>
What do I have to offer? <br/>
<br/>
sheesh. sorry this went so long. Thanks again for posting that, <br/>
Sandra.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have an idea!<br/>
When the broken leg isn&#39;t such an issue, schedule outings,  Maybe twice a <br/>
week, GO somewhere.  Not necessarily with all the kids, if they&#39;re old enough to <br/>
stay home or be somewhere else.  And you can piggy-back the outings onto <br/>
deliveries, like if one kid has to be somewhere, plan to drop him off and take the <br/>
others somewhere else.  Doesn&#39;t have to be elaborate or expensive.  Maybe just <br/>
one errand, or to lunch, or to take the dog to run in some park or vacant lot.<br/>
<br/>
The easiest outing of all is to go to a different grocery store.  Take twenty <br/>
minutes longer to shop, but see new things, new people, drive a different <br/>
route, take your time, talk to the kids, stop at some section you&#39;ve never stood <br/>
in front of before and just LOOK at the stuff.  Use the grocery store as a <br/>
museum.  Buy some vegetable you&#39;ve never had.  You can get recipes on the <br/>
internet with google.com.  <br/>
<br/>
It will spark up some learning and break up your monotony.<br/>
<br/>
If you have more time and money, maybe have an artsy lunch and hit a big <br/>
magazine rack to get some magazines you&#39;ve never heard of (or that you like but <br/>
don&#39;t usually buy).  We have a couple of places here that combine artsy lunch <br/>
with huge magazine racks!  A $6 magazine and a $9 lunch is pretty expensive, but <br/>
once in a while it&#39;s a great luxury and a good date with a kid.  <br/>
<br/>
But if you set a goal for yourself of getting out twice a week with at least <br/>
one of your kids, to a museum or movie or even shopping for socks, but take a <br/>
kid and talk and observe and hang out, you will break your inertia.<br/>
<br/>
I can get into being home too, sometimes, and will take any offers for others <br/>
to deliver and pick up my kids, and I&#39;ll accept my  husband&#39;s offer to go to <br/>
for groceries and soon I&#39;m growing roots!!  And though it can be comfortable, <br/>
it&#39;s not the best for unschooling, if my kids become rooted with me.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe you are still de-schooling yourself?<br/>
<br/>
I was over 40 (and had 17 years of school) when it occurred to me that it<br/>
was up to me how to spend my time.  What should I do all day?  Although I<br/>
did what I wanted in my 20&#39;s, I felt that I wasn&#39;t doing what I *should* be<br/>
doing, because I had dropped out of college and therefore wasn&#39;t doing<br/>
anything that mattered.  Dumb thinking I know now, but didn&#39;t know it then.<br/>
As if moving to Alaska, supporting myself, making friends, and having<br/>
adventures doesn&#39;t matter!<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I was kind of depressed because, it seemed, that nothing I did<br/>
showed.  I pulled the fridge out to clean the coils and under and behind,<br/>
but once it was done it didn&#39;t look any different.  I washed the kitchen<br/>
floor and folded and put away two loads of laundry, but that never lasts<br/>
long!  The children and I watched the bonus material on Shakespeare in Love.<br/>
Even then, *I* was feeling guilty that I spent the morning watching TV.<br/>
It&#39;s that old conditioning.  One part of my brain was thinking how cool it<br/>
was to be watching and talking about it with my kids, and making good use of<br/>
the pause button, and how much we were all learning, and another part of my<br/>
brain was thinking, &quot;I&#39;m wasting time watching TV&quot;.`<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, this is good. Thing is, summertime? Here? swimming, hiking, <br/>
rock hopping, taking nature walks, bicycling...these are all in my <br/>
plans, or were, until the broken leg. Katie is eight, and by far my <br/>
most outgoing, outdoorsy, active, kinesthetic, (and kinetic, now that <br/>
I think about it! L), wanting-to-do-things, going-est kid. And stuck <br/>
on crutches. And so, we&#39;ve been following her &quot;lead&quot; quite a bit. She <br/>
has good ideas, and fun things of her own planned (like working on <br/>
the treehouse and riding her bike across the valley all by herself), <br/>
and loves to have us come along and we love to...<br/>
<br/>
this is going to be taking me outside of the rut, actually. Going <br/>
while Katie stays, for two months, anyway. Reading to her, playing <br/>
cards and other games, sitting quietly and talking with KATIE? <br/>
my &quot;see ya mom!&quot; as she walks out the door kid? L yup. Gonna break us <br/>
out of the moldy old mold, for sure.<br/>

accomplished, achievement-oriented homeschooling mom whose kids have <br/>
excelled. She follows a curriculum AND lets her kids choose their <br/>
interests, and they do follow their interests, to the top of the <br/>
Achievement Ladder, like their mom. Just got an email from her and <br/>
it&#39;s astounding all the irons she has in the fire. She has passion <br/>
for life. AND she disagrees with the idea of unschooling. AND she <br/>
sees me, intelligent, personable, and says &quot;Such potential&quot;, shaking <br/>
her head, just like my FREAKING teachers and parents when I was a <br/>
kid. Which has thrown me into major self-doubt this whole entire <br/>
year. <br/>
<br/>
And made me angry with her, to boot! <br/>
<br/>
*sigh*<br/>
<br/>
going to get a cast.<br/>

thanks<br/>

&lt;&lt; One part of my brain was thinking how cool it<br/>
<br/>
was to be watching and talking about it with my kids, and making good use of<br/>
<br/>
the pause button, and how much we were all learning, and another part of my<br/>
<br/>
brain was thinking, &quot;I&#39;m wasting time watching TV&quot;.`<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes.  You COULD have mopped around the washing machine and vacuumed the <br/>
ceilings.  <br/>
<br/>
But instead you learned about Shakespeare and moviemaking and an award <br/>
winning script.<br/>
<br/>
AND... speaking of Shakespeare in Love, does anyone know why Rosencrantz and <br/>
Guildenstern are Dead (by the same author) is still out of print and not on <br/>
DVD?  Does someone want more money?  Did a lawyer botch a job?  This, too, came <br/>
up in the car last night (because when we stopped to buy work out shorts for <br/>
Marty we also bought The Fifth Element, with Gary Oldman who&#39;s in R&G) and <br/>
Marty, just to make me feel better, said they&#39;re probably gathering up wonderful <br/>
deleted scenes to make a really great DVD.<br/>

<br/>
When I was a kid one of my friends had a Peanuts wall hanging (with<br/>
Linus?) saying &quot;There&#39;s no burden heavier than a great potential&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If I don&#39;t put that on a bumper sticker, maybe I&#39;ll get a tattoo!<br/>

<br/>
PS  One of the great things about unschooling for your children, which<br/>
your friend is failing to see, is the delightful *absence* of the<br/>
parental voice saying &quot;tut, tut, you are spending your potential in the<br/>
wrong way&quot;.  Next time she starts &quot;tutting&quot; maybe you could &quot;snort&quot;, at<br/>
least inwardly.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think your friend *makes you feel inferior* but she seems to be<br/>
perfectly happy with *letting you* feel inferior.  Competitive people<br/>
annoy me.  (I hate to lose!)</div>

Sam Rockwell&#39;s that way.  <br/>
He was the romantic love interest (in the round glass house) in Charlie&#39;s <br/>
Angels,<br/>
&quot;Guy&quot; in Galaxy Quest,<br/>
and the rustic actor who ends up playing &quot;Thisbe&quot; in Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream<br/>
<br/>
Different faces, same cute butt. (His naked rear seems featured in many <br/>
movies he&#39;s in, though only in  maybe Charlie&#39;s Angels of the set above.)<br/>

&quot;cookin&#39; up a turd&quot; for tomorrow...and Yes, he is a cutie...saw him described <br/>
on an internet site as having &quot;sinewy sexiness.&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-131625192">I&#39;m glad you did this, Sandra. It&#39;s been a few months for me, and I&#39;m <br/>
  still feeling doubt about this, quite a bit of the time. Like Beth, I <br/>
  feel like a bit of a dullard, like I don&#39;t have the interests or <br/>
  passions about life, to lead my kids this way in excellence. <br/>
  Modeling &quot;computer&quot; and &quot;reading&quot; LOL that&#39;s what I seem to be doing. <br/>
  Getting off my duff once in a blue moon to take care of the barest <br/>
  minimum of housekeeping and the house DOES look it, believe me. <br/>
  Depressing. <br/>
<br/>
  although, with company coming over on Friday, we will be getting busy <br/>
  with housework today and tomorrow, so that&#39;ll be better, the house <br/>
  part of things. I just have such a lethargy about everything. Like, <br/>
  giving my kids permission to do what they want, has led to me doing <br/>
  ONLY what I &quot;want&quot; and not any of my duties or responsibilities, and <br/>
  the house (and yard, btw) look it. No energy. Lots of apathy.<br/>
<br/>
  This can&#39;t be good.<br/>
<br/>
  so it isn&#39;t the kids I&#39;m worried about anymore...it&#39;s me. An <br/>
  introverted literary type who enjoys reading more than anything, <br/>
  whose house is falling apart around her ears because she&#39;s <br/>
  been &quot;doing what she wants&quot; (Reading) and not taking care of things. <br/>

  You are describing me!! A couple of weeks ago I was thinking the same thing about myself. But this week I have gotten the house cleaned and have spent more time with the kids and done some art by myself. This just sort of happened. I think it&#39;s the whole deschooling thing and maybe we need it more than the kids. <br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think you need to worry, the vegging is seasonal. You&#39;ll probably find yourself feeling completely different in a couple of months/weeks. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827999810">Thanks, Julie<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re right. Part of it is PMS, I&#39;m sure...feeling bad about <br/>
myself for anything. &quot;Just won the Pulitzer Prize, but sheesh, I&#39;m <br/>
overweight&quot; LOL or something. And part of it is the changes in me, my <br/>
homeschooling, my friendship w/soul sister...change=stress. As I <br/>
always had to remind myself when i was in college as a single <br/>
mom &quot;Everything Is Temporary&quot; and I know you&#39;re right: I&#39;ll feel <br/>
better in a week or two.<br/>
<br/>
thanks again<br/>
