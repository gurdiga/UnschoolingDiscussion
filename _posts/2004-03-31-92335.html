Please don&#39;t take it personally, and also don&#39;t feel defeated, because he is <br/>
only acting 15.  I am just now coming out of the the first wave of this teen <br/>
angst storm with my oldest dd (16). She did alot of questioning herself, us, <br/>
the world, and what is her purpose?. Such heavy thinking for a young person.   <br/>
All you can do is keep being supportive, keep him busy, <br/>
and learn to fly in under his radar to redirect his thoughts toward the <br/>
postive things in his life.  <br/>
Whatever his passions are...use them, expand on them, help him find <br/>
activities in the community that utilize his talents. Find new and exciting things to <br/>
do (some days this is hard, because nothing is exciting and they aren&#39;t <br/>
interested, but try anyway).<br/>
My daughter is a gifted writer, artist, musician, web designer, and much <br/>
more, but to her she was terrible at everything.  She was so hard on herself, and <br/>
I was feeling very helpless. She has weathered this storm, and has a better <br/>
understanding of herself, and her goals in life...at least for now.<br/>
It can be very frustrating, because one minute they are professing how much <br/>
they love you, and the next their head is spinning, then they are depressed, <br/>
and it starts over again. :D  Just remember don&#39;t take it to heart, <br/>
because...This too shall pass! Meanwhile you are not alone. :D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-212389471">I have THREE teenage daughters. Ask me if I know about mood swings! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes teens need a LOT of reassurance. So just keep showing him <br/>
your confidence in him  at the same time that you understand and <br/>
sympathize with his fears. It is sometimes harder on our unschooled <br/>
kids at this age than their schooled counterparts because our kids are <br/>
entering adulthood eyes wide open - they &quot;get it&quot; that they are moving <br/>
into adult responsibilities, etc., and they are (justifiably) sometimes <br/>
freaked out by it all. The schooled kids more often don&#39;t really grasp <br/>
what&#39;s coming - they&#39;re just following orders, going through the <br/>
expected motions. Our unschooled kids are thinking - and their thoughts <br/>
can be overwhelming and scary and they can easily feel inadequate to <br/>
face the future.<br/>
<br/>
Help him understand that he isn&#39;t supposed to be especially great at <br/>
anything - he&#39;s just entering the time of his life where he MIGHT start <br/>
to focus in on some things to eventually become good at, but he has <br/>
time, there is no hurry and you really hope he&#39;ll continue to enjoy his <br/>
life and not worry yet about what he&#39;s &quot;good at,&quot; but just explore all <br/>
his options and do what satisfies him, for now. Some people specialize <br/>
and become really good at something while they&#39;re young, but others <br/>
dabble in a variety of activities and they know a little about a lot of <br/>
things and that&#39;s good too even if it seems like they aren&#39;t super good <br/>
at anything in particular. That will come later.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This has been my question, also.<br/>
<br/>
When I can get some perspective on it, I remind myself that adolescence is <br/>
a time of lots of emotions, often extreme emotions.  One sees it more often <br/>
in girls, but, it stands to reason that boys go through it also.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it is normal for one to feel one is not good at anything now and <br/>
then.  You signed your email as feeling like a failure.<br/>
<br/>
Ross tends to have these feelings more when he is tired.  When he is <br/>
rested, he has a more positive outlook on life.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Ross despairs of knowing what his adult work will be.  It is <br/>
normal not to know at this age.<br/>
<br/>
Ross and I talk about all these things, and it helps us both.<br/>
<br/>
I then make sure to affirm him a lot, pointing out what he is good at.  It <br/>
is obvious to me what he is good at, but it is not so obvious to him.  I <br/>
think he needs to hear it a lot.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>After empathizing with that feeling (that is so real when he feels it)... perhaps notice the <br/>
ways in which he uses his time and comment on those.<br/>
<br/>
Does he play X box? Is he good at watching movies and enjoying them? Is he learning to <br/>
drive yet? Does he fiddle with gadgets? Read lots of books? Listen to hours and hours of <br/>
heavy metal or emo or whatever music he loves? Is he a kid with oodles of friends? Play <br/>
any sports? Is he sensitive and empathetic, good at thinking on his feet, creative, or <br/>
analytical?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like being a teen to me.<br/>
<br/>
Last week we were discussing some of these kinds of feelings with a psychologist. He said <br/>
to us repeatedly: 16 is just so young. He&#39;s got years to sort things out. The kids in school <br/>
are just following orders, but your kids are safely living their lives until they know who <br/>
they are and what they want to do. <br/>
<br/>
School kids go through a similar sense of loss of direction around the end of college when <br/>
they are suddenly faced with getting jobs.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

pass...<br/>

<br/>
Because he&#39;s 15 and angst is natural.<br/>
Teach him that term and concept and say that the hormone storm that teens <br/>
live through causes angst, but he&#39;ll feel better as he reaches adulthood.<br/>
<br/>
Very few 15 year olds are &quot;good at anything&quot; in one way of looking at it.  <br/>
Few of them could make a living at that moment at something really flashy and <br/>
impressive.  And part of growing up is that self-reflection about &quot;NOW what?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
But what is fun for him?  Concentrate on fun and distraction and find <br/>
situations where he&#39;ll see the sky and feel the breeze on his face and maybe stir <br/>
your life up to where he&#39;s seeing and doing new things for a while to get him <br/>
onto a new plateau.   It might still be angsty, but angst with a new view.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing to prevent hormones.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
All good info/advice----and I&#39;ve seen it in Cameron too---although brief.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that he sees adults GOOD at what they do: you and your husband, the <br/>
guy down the street, his mentor in his interest---most of us who are doing <br/>
what we love. It&#39;s easy to feel inadequate when everyone around you is better <br/>
than you! Point that out to him----and that we ALL went through a phase of <br/>
beginning.<br/>
<br/>
When at dog shows I try to point out to newbies that the very judge that they <br/>
are freaking about showing under ALSO had his/her *first time* in the ring <br/>
however many years ago. We ALL start out as novices. It&#39;s passion and immersion <br/>
that leads us to get better and BE better. That judge had no more knowledge or <br/>
experience than anyone else his first time in the ring (well, those that were <br/>
born into dog families have a leg up, but they STILL had their *first* time <br/>
in the ring! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
As Pam said----he&#39;s *just* starting out. Most school kids don&#39;t have that <br/>
feeling he&#39;s having until they are twenty-something and just out of college!<br/>

And I think that what has made it easier for Cameron is that he WAS really <br/>
good at something at 12. When he&#39;s struggling now, I can always bring up how <br/>
difficult the magic was for him when he first started. It&#39;s VERY easy for him to <br/>
see that with some (more) hard work, the drums and guitar and filming (the <br/>
current passions) will get easier and easier. ANd that new passions are just <br/>
around the corner.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of Betty Edwards comments in her wonderful book: Drawing on the Right <br/>
Side of the Brain. Most people give up on drawing around fifth grade because it is the first <br/>
time they realize that the pleasure they take in drawing isn&#39;t producing accurate <br/>
representational drawing. They have, for the first time, an awareness of what &quot;good <br/>
drawing&quot; is. And they know suddenly (and with disappointment) that theirs isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately in our current educational model, we assume that drawing is some kind of <br/>
divinely imparted gift and can&#39;t be taught. So thousands of adults believe they are &quot;bad&quot; at <br/>
drawing and quit at about age ten. Truth is, we can all be taught to draw (I learned as an <br/>
adult and erased that feeling for life...). If someone realizes that how she draws isn&#39;t good <br/>
enough, more training and support can release her from that feeling and give her the <br/>
competence she craves.<br/>
<br/>
When I think of a fifteen year old saying he isn&#39;t good at anything, I think of someone who <br/>
is for the first time aware of what it means to be good at something... taking pleasure in <br/>
an activity isn&#39;t the same as mastery or competence. But that&#39;s a wonderful moment if it <br/>
can be seized and explored. <br/>
<br/>
If he knows what he wishes to be good at, then it&#39;s possible to work toward that end - <br/>
lessons, mentoring, volunteering, more time devoted each day, seminars, computer <br/>
programs... whatever.<br/>
<br/>
If he doesn&#39;t know what he wishes to be good at, then more time of exploration will be <br/>
helpful (and it will be natural that he won&#39;t be good at what he explores while he&#39;s still <br/>
exploring....). He just needs to know that when he knows what interests him, he can <br/>
become good at it, competent. There are means to that end that he can pursue and he has <br/>
plenty of time to get there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039543929">I wanted to add too that I think it shows what  a great open communication you obviously have, that your son would even share this with you. How many teens out there feel this way, but turn to peers, alcohol, drugs or other escapes. Your son  is going through something probably just about every human does, but has the luxury and benefit of sharing it with an open-minded, kind hearted listening ear, that truly cares about him.<br/>

There&#39;s nothing to prevent hormones.  <br/>

As if hormones wasn&#39;t enough, the brain is going through a huge rewiring <br/>

changes in their personalities.<br/>
I did alot of research last year to help me understand and cope with my dd&#39;s <br/>

&quot;New neuroscience research has shown that a crucial part of the brain <br/>
undergoes extensive changes during puberty -- precisely the time when the raging <br/>
hormones often blamed for teen behavior begin to wreak havoc. It&#39;s long been known <br/>
that the architecture of the brain is largely set in place during the first <br/>
few years of life. But with the aid of new technologies such as magnetic <br/>
resonance imaging (MRI), scientists are mapping changes in pre-teen and teenage <br/>
brains and finding evidence that remarkable growth and change continue for decades&quot;<br/>

I think a lot of kids have a big surge of unhappy hormones around this <br/>
age.  My dh and I were both thinking about suicide when we were 15. <br/>
 Compared to that experience (both in public school) your son does sound <br/>
happier and healthier.<br/>

Does he *believe* that he has the ability to improve his skills if he <br/>

While I usually like to avoid discussions of &quot;giftedness&quot; as causing more <br/>
problems than they solve, a friend did send me this saying &quot;Maybe this is my <br/>
problem&quot; (his, he meant, not mine):<br/>
<br/>
The Too Many Aptitude Problem <br/>
(Condensed from Danger:High Voltage) <br/>
by <br/>
Hank Pfeffer <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Talent is a force, not a tool.  Talent is neither good nor bad.   Being <br/>
multi-talented is a very mixed blessing.     For some people, it is a curse. <br/>
Ability or performance is the result of complex interaction between various <br/>
parts of the mind body system.  Some parts of ability are due to &quot;nurture&quot;.  <br/>
The most important of these environmental factors is knowledge in one form or <br/>
another.   Nature is the basis of talent. <br/>
We all know, understand and operate on more levels than just the conscious.   <br/>
Talents or aptitudes are unlearned abilities - gut level and non-conscious <br/>
ways of operating.    Some people call them knacks.   Aptitudes have a major <br/>
impact not just on performance, but on our individual and unique states of <br/>
being.   They are a big part of the reason &quot; One man&#39;s meat is another man&#39;s <br/>
poison.&quot; <br/>
Most people know far more than they realize about knacks and talents.   <br/>
People usually know if they are mechanical, have a sense of direction, pick up <br/>
languages, enjoy puzzles or are good with their hands.    Anyone who has managed <br/>
or trained people has seen the clear impact of unlearned abilities.  In any <br/>
area, some folks take to it like ducks to water.   Once trained, they stay ahead <br/>
of the crowd.   Others sweat to keep up, or fail miserably. <br/>
Strong talents do not equal high performance.   Having the right knacks or <br/>
talents are head start and ongoing advantage.   They are not very useful without <br/>
knowledge and motivation.    Aptitudes have to be trained in order to be used <br/>
well.   Peak performance occurs when one has the right combination of <br/>
talents, knowledge, motivation, opportunity, courage, luck, tools and the X factors. <br/>
  <br/>
About two dozen different and independent aptitudes are pretty well known, <br/>
with another couple dozen possibles and probables (see attached list).    These <br/>
talents are simple things:   types of memory,  ways of processing information, <br/>
levels of perception.    They are building blocks for more complex ways of <br/>
operating.   They operate in a systemic way and are important factors in long t<br/>
erm performance and behavior. <br/>
Everyone seems to have each aptitude to some degree - high, mid range or <br/>
low.  These seem to be genetic in origin, though a case can be made for the <br/>
influence of early childhood stimulation.   It is a moot question for adults.   By <br/>
the time someone passes puberty, the aptitudes are roughly stable (when <br/>
performance on aptitude tests is compared to others in the same age group).  . . .<br/>
<br/>
And it goes on (and on) here:<br/>

It&#39;s kind of like Gardner&#39;s Multiple Intelligences, and it&#39;s interesting <br/>
enough but I wouldnt&#39; take it to the bank or even slip with it under my pillow.<br/>

felt like a burden instead of being liberating.  Everyone thought I <br/>
was going to be a lawyer, I&#39;m not. I&#39;ve always been very artistic. <br/>
I&#39;m not an artist either. I haven&#39;t found a career. For a while this <br/>
really bothered me. How could someone with so much potential be such <br/>
a failure? Until I changed my perspective.  I can argue pretty well, <br/>
I take on artistic projects for my own pleasure, I&#39;m a pretty good <br/>
mom, I continue to learn new things and take on challenges for <br/>
pleasure instead of gain.  I consider myself a happy person.  When I <br/>
stopped feeling like I had to live up to my &quot;potential&quot; and just <br/>
enjoyed the many varied talents I had without feeling the need to <br/>
make them a career, I finally relaxed.  It doesn&#39;t make me <br/>
a &quot;slacker&quot;.  It frees me to enjoy who I am right now without the <br/>
pressure to become someone else.<br/>
<br/>
I want my sons to feel that freedom. To be who they are without <br/>
pressure of turning every single talent into a moneymaker because <br/>
you&#39;re &quot;supposed to&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
If you soften it to &quot;maybe someday you&#39;ll want to do something like this for <br/>
a living&quot; it would be better.<br/>
<br/>
It seems subtle, but I think it&#39;s worth qualifying those statements.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is really good at counselling and has been since he was little.  If <br/>
kids were unhappy at our once-big playgroup, we would call on him or Sarah <br/>
Cordova (they&#39;d known each other from infancy) to advise us or just go fix it.  We <br/>
never even checked back with them if they said, &quot;Oh.  Yeah.  We&#39;ll talk to <br/>
them.&quot;  Between the two of them, they  knew which of them would be best to do the <br/>
mediation/negotiation/jollying/advising/spinning, or would know which other <br/>
kid might be better.  They never grandstanded it, they never even made it <br/>
obvious.  They had a talent and used it in a real-world, direct way, when they were <br/>
too young to know it was remarkable.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was 14 or 15 he counselled an older friend out of a divorce, and <br/>
he&#39;s still married a couple of years later and happy about it.  What the hell <br/>
did Kirby know about marriage or divorce?!  What he DID know was that his <br/>
friend was distraught and not thinking straight, and so he just helped him figure <br/>
out what he was thinking and feeling.  It was done late night by e-mail or <br/>
instant message or something.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby told me about that one, I said &quot;That&#39;s what marriage counsellors <br/>
do for money!&quot; and basically just gave him the &quot;attaboy, good for you&quot; and told <br/>
him his friend was really lucky to have him.   Another time I told him he <br/>
might someday want to take a psychology class or two to see if he&#39;s interested in <br/>
that sort of thing since he already has a talent.<br/>
<br/>
In Howard Gardner&#39;s intelligences, what Kirby has that makes that happen is a <br/>
combination of interpersonal and logical.  <br/>
<br/>
Indicating lightly that there are &quot;pursuits&quot; and paid positions involving <br/>
those talents isn&#39;t putting pressure on him.  It might just be a side-thing his <br/>
whole life.    And I suspect it&#39;s genetic.  I&#39;ve always been one of those <br/>
people others tend to confide in lines at grocery stores, or at company barbecues.  <br/>
Other people are talking about sports and weather, and someone has zeroed in <br/>
on me to tell of sexual dysfunction or spiritual angst or something.    If any <br/>
of you have a clue why that happens, I&#39;m curious.  Do I SMELL curious!?  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
I&#39;ve talked to other people that happens to as well, but they didn&#39;t know <br/>
what it was either.<br/>

They will figure out what to do for a living all by themselves.  You don&#39;t need to tell them (unless they are asking for that information).  It also takes the joy out of the moment by placing emphasis on future events.  Stay in the moment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-103000809">You can facilitate their talents by providing opportunities. The <br/>
same way you unschool.  If they like something you usually find <br/>
outings or books or...etc. The difference is that you don&#39;t &quot;zone <br/>
in&quot; on the talent and make it who &quot;they are&quot;. Their talents don&#39;t <br/>
have to become them, just a part of who they are. Because if for <br/>
some reason they later find they&#39;re not that great at it compared to <br/>
others or change pursuits they will feel like a part of their <br/>
identity is gone. <br/>
<br/>
 In today&#39;s society we become our careers. I don&#39;t want to be a <br/>
career. I want to be me who happens to have a particular career. <br/>
Your talents shouldn&#39;t be your identifiers.<br/>
<br/>
Our talents are a big part of who we are. They&#39;re part of the larger <br/>
make-up of our selves.  They shouldn&#39;t entail our entire selves.  <br/>
Think about what would happen to an artist or pianist who suddenly <br/>
one day lost the use of their hands. They would feel useless if they <br/>
thought that an artist or pianist was ALL they were.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;They will figure out what to do for a living all by themselves.  You don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;need to tell them (unless they are asking for that information).  It also <br/>
&gt;takes the joy out of the moment by placing emphasis on future <br/>
&gt;events.  Stay in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with all of the above, including the question posed by Kristen.<br/>
<br/>
I think I never found work I enjoyed in part because of a lack of parental <br/>
guidance and support.  My parents were living in south America at the time <br/>
I was a young adult and were unable to help me sort things out.  (That was <br/>
before email or even inexpensive international phone calls).<br/>
I knew I was intelligent but, I didn&#39;t have direction.<br/>
<br/>
I want to be able to help Ross find both activities he enjoys and work that <br/>
is satisfying and will pay the bills.  I don&#39;t want him to work at low <br/>
paying jobs for lack of direction.  That is disheartening.  If he doesn&#39;t <br/>
know what he truly loves, perhaps he can find decent paying work that is at <br/>
least interesting.  Someday he might combine earning money with his <br/>
passions, but, maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how to help him in all this.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I think pressure comes from being pushed in a direction not of their own <br/>
&gt;choosing - not a simple acknowledgement of a job well done or expressing <br/>
&gt;joy in your child&#39;s own sense of accomplishment.  Being careful not to <br/>
&gt;identify accomplishments only by your judgment of what&#39;s worthwhile but <br/>
&gt;being sensitive to what they find worthwhile.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I still can&#39;t stand it when I do something and my mother says to me...&quot;you <br/>
&gt;could be a....&quot; -  to me I already am a........<br/>
