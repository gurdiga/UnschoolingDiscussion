I just resigned as a troop leader today from my daughter&#39;s Brownie Troop.

 <br/>
I can see that I don&#39;t stand up for myself well, and I don&#39;t set boundaries. I can see where here shortly I&#39;m going to have to further limit my relationship with &quot;best friend&quot; because of the toxicities with that relationship. <br/>
 <br/>
Paul and I were both talking about how our lives were better, our children better, when we just didn&#39;t have these people in our lives. I&#39;m trying to steel myself for going back into a lonely life again, because to be alone would be better than these toxic relationships. But it&#39;s hard...and it hurts...I&#39;m not trying to whine or anything...just...sigh...I don&#39;t know...<br/>
 <br/>
But all of this affects my kids, and therefore what they are learning in life. <br/>

Until you are not lonely even when alone, these problems are likely to<br/>
continue.  Until you are happy spending time with you, why would anyone else<br/>
be happy doing it?  Sorry if it sounds harsh, but that is the truth as I<br/>
know it.<br/>

I had to add my opinion on this one as I have been through this as <br/>
well.  I lived with a man for 4 years who emotionally and sometimes <br/>
physically abused me.  I was quite young but had a great job and <br/>
wonderful friends and family who encouraged me to leave all the <br/>
time.  In the work place, I was confidante and outgoing.  However, <br/>
inside I hated myself and was petrified of being &quot;alone.&quot;  I thought <br/>
that anything was better than being alone.  One day, I woke up and <br/>
knew that I had to leave or completely lose myself forever.  I left <br/>
that night and lived with friends and family for 6 months while I <br/>
got back on my feet and learned to love myself again.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m married to a wonderful man and have a beautiful daughter.  <br/>
I love being alone and having time to myself.  As a matter of fact, <br/>
if I don&#39;t get my hour a day, I feel stressed and overwhelmed.  It <br/>
took a long time and some deep soul searching to find out why I <br/>
hated myself and to &quot;fix&quot; it but, I did it has made an unbelievable <br/>
difference in my life.   I know that it&#39;s been said a hundred times <br/>
and sometimes you forget to really listen but....you HAVE to love <br/>
yourself before others can love you.<br/>
<br/>
Melissa<br/>
<br/>
PS.  It&#39;s a good thing that I enjoy being with myself (and my <br/>
daughter) because we have recently moved to NV (where we know NO ONE <br/>
and my husband works 6 days a week 12 hours a day)!  Boy would I be <br/>
in trouble if I didn&#39;t enjoy my own company.  :-)</div>

 </span></blockquote>  I know what you mean MamaBeth. It used to be like that for me until I realized that you get relationships with people who want what you&#39;re offering. Toxic people want friends who offer themselves on a platter. There have been a few posts saying this but here we go again. Say no to the toxic ones and they&#39;ll disappear. Work on liking yourself, doing things for yourself and you&#39;ll find that people who are interested in true friendship rather then a lackey will start to become part of your life. It&#39;s slow I found, but it works!<br/>

their only friend, as soon as you stand up for<br/>
yourself and your children, the toxic friend will find<br/>
someone else to glomb onto.  She has plenty of other<br/>
targets, and really it is no disappointment to her to<br/>
switch.<br/>
<br/>
She might talk about you behind your back about how<br/>
mean you were or make up other lies about you (I know<br/>
of one person told several of my friends that I had<br/>
dumped her because she wouldn&#39;t convert to<br/>
Christianity!!), and even if some of those people<br/>
believe her for a little while, as soon as she shows<br/>
her true colors to them, they will understand.  Those<br/>
same people came back to me a year and a half later<br/>
and said that they realized they had been wrong to<br/>
believe her and should have known I wouldn&#39;t do that<br/>
since I had never done it to any of them.<br/>
<br/>
It is kind of like having a poisonous snake around,<br/>
they may be beautiful to look at, but cross them and<br/>
their venom is deadly.<br/>

like-minded individuals who will become your closest<br/>
friends.  Don&#39;t seek out friends just to have them.  I<br/>
have 3 friends I can think of who are my closest<br/>
friends, then an outer ring of friends and relatives<br/>
who are not as close but still part of our lives, and<br/>
then a ring of acquaintences.<br/>
<br/>
Let them start in the outer ring, and let time draw<br/>
them into the inner circle.  The ones who want to jump<br/>
right to being your best buddy and your closest<br/>
neighbor the first or second time you meet them are<br/>
the ones that are toxic and should stay in the further<br/>
most places of your life :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-959647000">Looks like you are setting your boundaries here.  At first it may <br/>
not feel good when you set your boundaries, but after a while you <br/>
will begin to feel more comfortable with it.  You deserve to set <br/>
your own boundaries and not have others led you around as they see <br/>
fit.  Also, by homeschooling, you are again setting boundaries (by <br/>
not allowing the ps system control you and yours).<br/>
<br/>
It may help to try to think of boundary-setting as a &#39;process&#39; <br/>
instead of an &#39;event.&#39;  It might take time to feel safe in a <br/>
behavior that is sort of new to you.  After a while and with plenty <br/>
of practice, you will likely feel very good about it.  <br/>
<br/>
Your children will learn self respect and the value of reflection <br/>
(an alone-time behavior).  Being alone, being quiet, or being still  <br/>
can be very therapeutic for busy moms.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788618196">One thing that happened yesterday, showed me that while I&#39;m still learning, Sarah&#39;s doing well with this. At the Brownie meeting, we were making signs for selling cookies. We had a bunch of ribbon, and the girls ended up cutting lengths and putting them in their hair by about halfway through the meeting. Sarah wanted some too, so I put some in after brushing her hair up into a ponytail. <br/>
<br/>
Sarah has NEVER liked having anything on her head, or hairbows, and only once in awhile will tolerate having her hair up. She was a forceps birth, and it left her with a dislocated jaw and nearly poked her eye out. She would wiggle and wiggle to get out of the little hats they put on newborns in the hospital. Put one on her, and within 10 minutes she&#39;d have it off her head. <br/>
<br/>
Just before the meeting ended, Sarah came to me and asked me to take hers out. I jokingly said &quot;Don&#39;t you want to do what everyone else is doing?&quot; and she said said &quot;No, I&#39;m special in my own way and I don&#39;t like having things in my hair or my hair up.&quot; I said &quot;I&#39;m proud of you for not going along with everyone when you don&#39;t really want to!&quot; and I took them out of her hair. <br/>
