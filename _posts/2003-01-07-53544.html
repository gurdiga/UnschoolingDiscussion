I had three extra homeschooled kids for 3.2 hours or so.  I must be a<br/>
light-weight.  :-) &gt;&gt;<br/>

You can build up to it gradually.<br/>
<br/>
They had spent the night, on the night of the worst wind I ever remember <br/>
here.  58 mph, I heard.  Scary.  I woke up a couple of times to shine a <br/>
maglight out the window in the room next to me to see if the door of the room <br/>
where they were (NOT next to me) was still closed.  I had bad visions of it <br/>
blowing open and shattering glass.   <br/>
<br/>
It did blow open, but not until after the sun was up and after they were <br/>
awake anyway.  Holly and those three had slept in the library and heard that <br/>
wind all night (though most of them said they slept through it, once they <br/>
went to sleep around midnight).<br/>
<br/>
And that same night, more like 11:30, the fireplace lost its battle to send <br/>
smoke up, and the wind started sending the smoke DOWN.  BAD.  <br/>
<br/>
First we broke the fire apart, scattered the parts.  But it was HOT.  <br/>
So we brought in cold ashes from a bucket in the yard and tried to bury it.  <br/>
<br/>
Bad plan.  Not only it was still smoking, but now the wind had ashes to blow.<br/>
<br/>
So I got a squirt bottle of water and sprayed a REALLY hot fire.  Then I <br/>
sprayed the air.  We had a fan blowing air out of the den (into the next <br/>
room, an enclosed porch) and &quot;only&quot; four room got very smoky.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never put a fire out with water in a fireplace before.  I&#39;m glad I did.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I was still awake.  The kids would&#39;ve probably freaked out and <br/>
closed the flue, which would have saved us from the wind, but not from the <br/>
remaining fire/smoke.<br/>
<br/>
It was a learning experience, but I was tired and not in the mood for a <br/>
learning experience.<br/>
I guess those are some of the best kinds.<br/>
