<div id="ygrps-yiv-309071752">Someone in a recent post mentioned really liking an author or speaker from the Oprah show. Another person said she couldn&#39;t stand the man and a third person said she loved to listen to him despite the fact that she hated him.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, that&#39;s how I feel about Laura Schleisinger. I find myself wanting to listen if she&#39;s on when I&#39;m in the car, and sometimes I even agree with her. Usually I find her maddening and demeaning and irritating.<br/>
<br/>
I distinctly remember her being very anti-homeschooling awhile back, but recently I&#39;ve heard her make some pretty pro-hsing statements. Does anyone know if she&#39;s had a change of heart?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-362503297">Yuck &lt;g&gt;  Dr. Laura, Judge Judy, Dr. Phil the professional witness, Rush and<br/>
a few others are no different than the shock jocks regardless of how they<br/>
like to pretend otherwise!  There is a whole epidemic of just because we are<br/>
on television/radio, we get to declare ourselves experts and be rude.  Dr.<br/>
Laura needs to clean up her own backyard before she tells others how to<br/>
live.  Judge Judy spends about half her time on air bending or breaking the<br/>
laws she is supposed to be enforcing and then there are the cases where she<br/>
simply doesn&#39;t have a clue at all!  Dr. Phil and his 15 minute pre-show<br/>
interviews and instant diagnosis as an excuse to berate people is just soooo<br/>
professional.  And, Rush, well, enough said!<br/>
<br/>
Sure can&#39;t blame folks in other countries if they call us &quot;rude Americans&quot;<br/>
if all they have ever seen is all the self-professed experts on our tv and<br/>
radio shows!<br/>

attitude about parents being responsible for children and having a parent <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609564086">A quote &quot;No sex before marriage, no marriage before 30, no abortions, no day<br/>
care. And above all- stop whining!&quot;  She had a messy divorce from first<br/>
hubby, hasn&#39;t spoken to her mother in over a decade, and at one point posed<br/>
nude (not a good mental image &lt;g&gt;).  She calls gays and lesbians &quot;biological<br/>
errors.&quot;  &quot;all feminists are &quot;demented&quot;  &quot;activism will close your mind&quot;<br/>
&quot;if you lived right you&#39;d have no need for an abortion&quot;  All minorities are<br/>
&quot;lazy and need to quite whining.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
According to her you can&#39;t marry out of your religion unless you plan on<br/>
having no children because &quot;your children will be tragically confused.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And all children should we &quot;kicked out of the house at the age of 18&quot; and<br/>
get a college education on their own with out monetary help from their<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
Her degree (phd) is in physiology and she has a cert in hypnosis and sex<br/>
therapy which she obviously learned nothing about.  she also calls herself<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-495701890">I caught a news bleep several years ago where the mics were open and she<br/>
didn&#39;t know it.  The way she treated her son was absolutely disgusting!  I<br/>
had never heard of her before.  So, I went and did some research and then<br/>
watched one show.  No thank you!<br/>
<br/>
There are some folks that no matter how much good they may inadvertantly do,<br/>
do so much more damage that they should permanently lose their voices!<br/>
<br/>
The first show I caught she was derating some woman telling her that the<br/>
only reason her son got in trouble (he was having problems in school) was<br/>
because she hadn&#39;t made an effort to be a SAHM.  Well, the woman had been<br/>
deserted and never received any child support so what was she suppose to do.<br/>
She said she had been on welfare for awhile to stay home when the kid was<br/>
small.  she got cut off there and berated as a leach on society for using<br/>
welfare.  I shut off the radio.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years later a friend suggested I give her another try because<br/>
she had mellowed and was not so rude.  yeah right!  She was busy that day<br/>
gay and black bashing and when someone called her on it she hung up on them<br/>
and then lit into them about bringing moral decay to this country.<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: [a moment&#39;s peace<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How does Dr. Laura irritate me?<br/>
Let me count the ways . . . <br/>
1.  Her belief that gays are inferior and should be cured. <br/>
      August 9, 1999 radio show<br/>
      <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.horizonsfoundation.org/drlaura.htm">http://www.horizonsfoundation.org/drlaura.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
2.  Her refusal to acknowledge legally recognized religious groups <br/>
outside of the Judeo-Christian faith.<br/>
      <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.magickalcauldron.com/laura.html">http://www.magickalcauldron.com/laura.html</a><br/>
<br/>
3.  Her doctorate is NOT in Psychology yet she allows that impression <br/>
to linger.<br/>
      See link in #1<br/>
<br/>
4.  Hypocrisy: <br/>
      {Ironically, in the Sept. 2000 edition of her Dr. Laura <br/>
Perspective magazine, Laura endorses the same strategies GLAAD <br/>
employed. In the second part of her &quot;Kids & Sex&quot; article, Laura <br/>
says: &quot;Write to the source of any offensive content and tell them of <br/>
your concerns. Write that not only will you stop watching the program <br/>
or reading the publication because of the stories or advertisements, <br/>
but you will also go out of your way not to purchase the sponsors&#39; <br/>
products and will encourage others to avoid them as well&quot; [p. 7]. <br/>
This is exactly the kind of campaign GLAAD orchestrated. But when <br/>
GLAAD contacts advertisers, it&#39;s intimidation and threats. When Laura <br/>
does it, it&#39;s &quot;improving your village.&quot;}<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.glaad.org/org/publications/documents/index.html?record=2742">http://www.glaad.org/org/publications/documents/index.html?record=2742</a><br/>
     <br/>
5.  Her idea that the ALA (that&#39;s the American Library Association) <br/>
is evil and that Go Ask Alice, a web site they promote and whichis <br/>
hosted by Columbia University, promotes immorality. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/index.html">http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/index.html</a><br/>

<br/>
6.  She is anti-Planned Parenthood<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.drlaura.com/letters/index.html?mode=view&tile=1&id=1837">http://www.drlaura.com/letters/index.html?mode=view&tile=1&id=1837</a><br/>
<br/>
7.  I&#39;m tired of looking at this now!  I get the feeling she is anti-<br/>
feminist but haven&#39;t found a specific link for that.  I also think <br/>
her hypocrisy runs deep in more ways than I have above.<br/>
<br/>
You may consider her a child advocate but her comments about the &quot;Go <br/>
Ask Alice&quot; sight show that she is somewhat less than informed IMHO.<br/>

&gt; I guess this could get me flamed but I have been a Dr. Laura fan <br/>
for years.  It is hard for me to dislike someone who is such a strong <br/>
child advocate.  She is very conservative and does advocate strict <br/>
rules which I am beginning to see can lead to problems. But I still <br/>
think she has a lot of good insight into many things.<br/>

However, I also realize that every case is different and sometimes it <br/>
just is not possible to make thing work out this way.  Those people <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes I agree, but I was thinking in terms of older kids.  Whenever I <br/>
had an infact, I either did not work or cut my hour back to the bare <br/>
minimum.  I think it was less than 10 a week - I was teaching craft <br/>
classes.  Once they were bigger and I took a job with more hours, it <br/>
did not matter which of us was home only that one of us was.  Of <br/>
course I have an excellent dh.  He&#39;s a great parent - if he had been <br/>
like his friends are with their kids, I probably would feel <br/>
differently.  Of course if he were like his friends, I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
married him in the first place!<br/>
