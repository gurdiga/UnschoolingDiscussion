<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would have written more at the time had I felt it was interesting and<br/>
useful enough to add to the conversation. And I&#39;d certainly add more if<br/>
Tanya asked me or another unschooler who&#39;s sincerely interested in learning<br/>
more about unschooling. I find those kind of people and questions inspiring.<br/>
<br/>
You and your reasons for asking don&#39;t inspire me, Ned. And I&#39;d much rather<br/>
spend my time talking to people who have questions on their journey to<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
