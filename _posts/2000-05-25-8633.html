suspected that I have this for a number of years, but due to a &quot;doctor phobia&quot; 
have not sought treatment.&nbsp; I am afraid that I will be poked repeatedly 
with needles! &lt;g&gt;</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">What I noticed first was that I get a severe 
headache if I go more than 3 hours without eating.&nbsp; If I eat, the headache 
disappears.&nbsp; I can relate to the other symptoms you listed, but never knew 
they were signs of LBS.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Thank you so much for the info.&nbsp; Reading the 
lists of symptoms is a real eye-opener for me, I&#39;ve had a large number of these 
things for several years now.&nbsp; I had no idea they were all symptoms of 
LBS.&nbsp; Of course, they could be unrelated too.&nbsp; Sigh....I guess I will 
have to go under the needle to find out for sure!</font></div>
