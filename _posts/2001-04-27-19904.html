<div id="ygrps-yiv-591534724">Robin writes&gt;&gt;&gt;I mean, it&#39;s great to see some awesome show on Discovery<br/>
channel about animals or whatever, but there we were near the Everglades and<br/>
not seeing the real animals! Crazy-making.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, but after going to the Everglades for the day, it is so nice to be able<br/>
to watch a show that reminds you of what you&#39;ve seen there.<br/>
Or a brings those things that you haven&#39;t seen into reach. My kids have been<br/>
fascinated with Asia for going on two years, and joy at finding visuals to<br/>
feed their interest. We can&#39;t pull off a trip just yet.<br/>
<br/>
Now maybe if we had a family plane....<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
In our case, TV doesn&#39;t really get in the way of what we&#39;re DOing. It is<br/>
rare that we&#39;ll revolve our day around a TV show, or just sit for hours. It<br/>
is a supplement to what is already going on. The kids color and watch Crock<br/>
Files. I cook at watch FoodTV.<br/>
<br/>
I used to lmit the box when we first began homeschooling, and hypothetically<br/>
wouldn&#39;t mind if life got so busy and exciting that TV wasn&#39;t interesting<br/>
anymore, but am not aiming for that now, because for us, limiting a positive<br/>
doesn&#39;t make much sense.<br/>
<br/>
A lady at our park was complaining about how her neices watch TV from the<br/>
moment they come home from school, into the wee hours of the night. She said<br/>
that they don&#39;t get enough sleep, and that they don&#39;t eat healthily because<br/>
of the TV. I suggested that it was their *need* to zone out because their<br/>
day away from the TV is so structured for them...filling every minute. When<br/>
they get home, their parents and siblings are all about their own things.<br/>
I think that TV can be a substitute for cohesiveness, and maybe delay the<br/>
facing of it/dealing with it in some families, but I don&#39;t, like some,<br/>
believe it to be the &quot;cause.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 Not that anyone here was saying that specifically...just triggered my<br/>
thoughts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, I agree. There are definitely cool things worth watching. That&#39;s why we<br/>
love to check out videos and such. It&#39;s a bummer that the public library<br/>
here doesn&#39;t have a video section like the one we had in Washington. They<br/>
had National Geographic videos and all sorts of good stuff.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;m not so sure. I think it&#39;s hard to find definitive reasons for<br/>
people and their approach towards the TV. I know homeschooling families<br/>
where the kids are glued to the box for hours, and it&#39;s not to escape<br/>
school. My theory is that (as with so many things), there are people who are<br/>
just more genetically likely to have an unhealthy attraction to it. My DH is<br/>
from a family of 7, and one of his siblings is an alcoholic. The rest of<br/>
them can pick up a beer and drink it, no problem. They don&#39;t reach for a<br/>
2nd, and a 3rd.... So for them, having beer in the fridge is no big deal.<br/>
For their brother, it is. I think TV *can* be addictive, but probably not<br/>
for most people. For many people, it&#39;s probably like the beer in the<br/>
fridge - no big deal, but for some it has an overhwhelming attraction. I do<br/>
think kids have different reactions to TV, based on their personalities.<br/>
When we had our TV in the living room, my son would stay glued to it for as<br/>
long as it was on, and not for lack of other things to do, and definitely<br/>
not because his life was too structured, LOL. At the same age, my daughter<br/>
could care less. In fact, she typically just won&#39;t watch it at all and when<br/>
we rent movies I have to keep going and chasing her through the house, I<br/>
usually don&#39;t see too much of the movie! So I can definitely see why even<br/>
homeschooling families would feel it was in the best interests of their kids<br/>
to limit or even get rid of the TV, if it was causing a problem for their<br/>
specific kids. I can also see how other people who don&#39;t have this<br/>
experience with their kids, could easily say &quot;Well, if you just let them<br/>
watch as much as they want to, they&#39;ll turn it off. They won&#39;t<br/>
overstimulate&quot; as if it is always the case that it is the *limits* that<br/>
cause the problems and not that the limits *come from* the problems. Often<br/>
times when you find a parent who is limiting something, it is because their<br/>
kid is prone to overstimulation or overattraction to it, not the other way<br/>
around. In this sense, TV can be &quot;the cause&quot;, even if it isn&#39;t &quot;the cause&quot;<br/>
of problems for most people. But I also think you&#39;re right in that TV can be<br/>
a crutch or substitute and that when the underlying family issues are<br/>
addressed, it is used much less. I think that it is this scenario (which I<br/>
believe is really common) that the TV-turn-off week was aimed at. This is an<br/>
interesting discussion!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ahhh. I see what you&#39;re saying.<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest was three or so, keeping her out all day at malls or family<br/>
gatherings would overstimulate her and she&#39;d have to cry to get out all of<br/>
her complicated, overwhelmed thoughts before she could go to sleep. She<br/>
would also have nightmares.<br/>
When we began to run around less, and spend more time at home, many<br/>
relatives took it personally. Often there were comments about &quot;No...you<br/>
don&#39;t tell them life has the choice of being any different and they&#39;ll<br/>
adapt.&quot;<br/>
Well, we didn&#39;t. We chose to listen more closely to what she needed, and to<br/>
make them adapt instead.<br/>
<br/>
So...all that to say I can see this angle. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710471178">and as she grew her needs changed, just like tv viewving can change. When I was little I often spent vast amounts of time in front of the TV saturday and sunday were at least four to six hours, maybe more. As a teenager, I hardly watched it at all and still watch rarely. Occasionally I will go through a period watching a lot, but it only lasts about a week. <br/>
