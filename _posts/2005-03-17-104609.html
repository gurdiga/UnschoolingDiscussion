<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521553005">Today my 8 yr old discovered the wonderful world of skateboarding!  <br/>
I have had them for a few years because I always liked to mess <br/>
around on them and today (despite it being damn cold out) my eldest <br/>
decided he was going to take the scooter out and then traded it in <br/>
for the skateboard which was more challenging.<br/>
<br/>
A few lessons on ballance and gravity were learned with the ever <br/>
important pain reflex and fabric stability tests.  He is so proud of <br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny to me because the preconcieved notion is that boys &quot;do&quot; <br/>
that sort of thing and he never really got into it, while my <br/>
daughter (last year 1 1/2) got her first serious road rash from <br/>
boarding and had to be taken to the hospital.  She has a fantastic <br/>
scar that will tell quite a few stories when she is older.  I love <br/>
my goofy kids.<br/>
