Life is a journey. Our unschooling life is just the path we&#39;ve taken, it&#39;s <br/>
not the <br/>
destination. Our kids will continue on this path their whole lives. There&#39;s <br/>
no <br/>
reason for them to know everything in the whole wide world right now. It&#39;s <br/>
not <br/>
even possible. Knowing what it is to really be alive, to ask questions and <br/>
question the answers...that&#39;s the path we&#39;re on.<br/>

What About Socialization? <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Despite its growing acceptance, there are nagging shortcomings to home<br/>
schooling. If you spend time with home schoolers, you get a sense that some<br/>
of them have missed out on whole swaths of childhood; the admirable efforts<br/>
by their parents to ensure their education and safety sometimes seem to<br/>
have gone too far. In 1992 psychotherapist Larry Shyers did a study while at<br/>
the University of Florida in which he closely examined the behavior of 35 home<br/>
schoolers and 35 public schoolers. He found that home schoolers were<br/>
generally more patient and less competitive. They tended to introduce<br/>
themselves to one another more; they didn&#39;t fight as much. And the home<br/>
schoolers were much more prone to exchange addresses and phone numbers.<br/>
In short, they behaved like miniature adults. &quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kids today are missing some essential social skills for relating to each <br/>
other.<br/>
They don&#39;t know how to introduce themselves to other kids. They don&#39;t know<br/>
how to negotiate or sustain a conversation. They relate to each other via<br/>
put-downs.&quot;<br/>

Islands of Expertise <br/>
by Eric D. Gyllenhaal<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Islands of expertise&quot; is a term coined by Kevin Crowley, Ph.D., an <br/>
educational <br/>
researcher at University of Pittsburgh who studies the ways that children and <br/>
parents learn together in museums ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kevincrowley.com">http://www.kevincrowley.com</a> ). It refers <br/>
to the areas of relatively deep and rich knowledge children develop when they <br/>
are passionately interested in something like dinosaurs, Pok√©mon, rocks, <br/>
turtles and other things. These islands emerge over weeks or months as <br/>
children talk, read and learn about their passions. <br/>
<br/>
On their islands of expertise, children remember, reason and explain in more <br/>
advanced ways than they usually do when submerged in the wider sea of <br/>
knowledge. Even preschoolers can think more like an expert does, which is <br/>
very <br/>
different from a beginner&#39;s approach to the subject. I guess you could also <br/>
say <br/>
they think more like an adult, growing up faster on their island than in the <br/>
rest <br/>
of their lives. (Just the opposite of Peter Pan.) <br/>
<br/>
Crowley emphasizes that children aren&#39;t alone on their islands. They build <br/>
and <br/>
inhabit them with their parents through the things they do together every <br/>
day. <br/>
Preschoolers especially need their parents&#39; help...<br/>

Eric Gyllenhaal has a PhD in paleontology from the University of Chicago. <br/>
He&#39;s <br/>
currently a stay-at-home dad and a part-time museum consultant. I&#39;m <br/>
becoming quite a fan of his writings about children and learning.<br/>

Do you like to learn?<br/>
<br/>
Four years ago, two riding pals asked me to write an article about learning.<br/>
I did not consider them students, although one would ask for a little help<br/>
occasionally and the other set up a lesson a couple of times a year, if that<br/>
often, for which she insisted on paying. When she finally explained that <br/>
paying<br/>
for the information meant that she would learn, I stopped protesting. It was<br/>
my first exposure to this sort of thinking. I did not understand it, but I <br/>
wanted<br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
They were both good riders who&#39;d learned &quot;the old way&quot; and they wanted to<br/>
improve. They pressed me to share with them anything I knew about learning<br/>
how-to-relearn to ride. I told them I also had questions--more questions than <br/>
I<br/>
had answers. This struck me as a good opportunity to ferret out some<br/>
answers, so I started researching this article right then. It began with a <br/>
short<br/>
interview and a few days later I interviewed three more people we knew. It was<br/>
a simple interview: one question. &quot;Do you like learning?&quot; Their five unanimous<br/>
answers stunned me.<br/>
<br/>
They all answered with the question: &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br/>

Group Functions<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can no longer stand group outings with other families. I tried for a few <br/>
years<br/>
to get used to them, to accept them, to think that I was just being an <br/>
uncooperative pain, but then I realized no, I would rather be with JUST my <br/>
kids <br/>
and not have to worry about whether six or ten other moms thought it was <br/>
okay for them to balance on the curb or the parking bumpers, whether the <br/>
other moms thought their T-shirts were acceptable, or whether they could get <br/>
a gumball or a soda, or whether they should sit lined up with the other kids <br/>
with their hands folded.&quot; <br/>

<br/>
Forms of Curiosity<br/>
<br/>
Children are tremendously curious about a wide variety of subjects. If you <br/>
took <br/>
a class of twenty-five first-graders and researched what really turned them <br/>
on, you&#39;d find that each boy and girl has a burning desire to learn more <br/>
about <br/>
something. One child may be curious about birds, another might have all sorts <br/>
of questions about the planets, and a third might be fascinated by cars. On a <br/>
more general level, we know the areas that children are eager to explore and <br/>
learn about: why people treat them the way they do, their own bodies, sports, <br/>
how to make things, drawing, music, and so on. Very few children, however, <br/>
are naturally curious about the subjects school forces them to learn. Most <br/>
kids don&#39;t have an intense curiosity about Dickens, state capitals, or <br/>
algorithms.<br/>
<br/>
...This is the problem with school and curiosity. Most kids only ask <br/>
questions <br/>
about the subjects they&#39;re being taught out of a sense of &quot;duty&quot; or because <br/>
they&#39;re worried they&#39;ll be criticized or downgraded, not because they&#39;re <br/>
really <br/>
curious about the answers. In fact, school tends to answer questions kids <br/>
don&#39;t have rather than the ones they want answered. When you don&#39;t have <br/>
questions about a subject, you don&#39;t learn. You simply memorize, take the <br/>
test, and forget.<br/>
<br/>
Heartfelt questions, then, are a manifestation of inquisitiveness. When your <br/>
child starts asking you a million question about a specific topic, this <br/>
identifies <br/>
a real area of interest. The fact that he&#39;s curious about something weird or <br/>
trivial -- why cats land on their feet when dropped off the balcony, or the <br/>
smell, texture, and taste of coffee beans -- is neither here nor there. No <br/>
matter where curiosity originates, it&#39;s a valid starting point, which as <br/>
we&#39;ll see <br/>
can lead to other, more &quot;useful&quot; areas of inquiry.<br/>
<br/>
Questions, however, aren&#39;t the only form curiosity takes. People express <br/>
their <br/>
curiosity through different behaviors. A teenager, for instance, might drive <br/>
fast because he&#39;s curious about how fast his car can go. A younger kid is <br/>
curious about what will happen if he invites the new student to his house for <br/>
lunch. A chemist is curious about what might happen if he mixes the liquids <br/>
in <br/>
test tubes X and Y. A kid is curious about what might happen if he fixes his <br/>
best friend up with the girl who sits next to him in math class. Picasso was <br/>
one <br/>
of the most curious of modern artists, constantly experimenting with his <br/>
painting techniques. In a very real sense, inquisitiveness involves <br/>
experimentation. Like scientists, curious people are fascinated to see &quot;what <br/>
would happen if...&quot; An avant-garde musician experiments with different <br/>
tonalities and instruments in the same way a small child experiments with <br/>
different types of balls to see how they bounce.<br/>
<br/>
Curiosity is a curious thing, especially when we probe beneath the surface of <br/>
our questions and behaviors and see how it helps us learn.<br/>
<br/>
Roger Schank - from Coloring Outside the Lines - Raising a Smarter Kid By <br/>
Breaking All the Rules (Harper Collins 2000)<br/>
Mr. Schank considers school mostly inescapable, thus the book is a treatise <br/>
on <br/>
how to minimize the damage school does to a child&#39;s intelligence. Unschoolers <br/>
will still find it a fascinating look at how learning happens, and full of <br/>
cautionary tales -- what not to do to your children in the name of <br/>
&quot;education&quot;.<br/>

T.C. Confesses<br/>
<br/>
One group that fascinated me was the unschoolers. It is nearly impossible to <br/>
accurately define unschooling, but foundationally it rests upon the idea that <br/>
if <br/>
you provide a rich learning environment and plenty of opportunity, a child <br/>
will <br/>
learn what he needs to know when he needs to know it. Intellectually, my head <br/>
was nodding over this one; I knew it worked for me, personally, and could see <br/>
where it would work for children too, especially considering the progress <br/>
Thomas had made during a year of NO SCHOOL. Not, mind you, that I would dare <br/>
try unschooling my own sons¬Öespecially since I was surrounded by people <br/>
(mostly relatives) who questioned the legitimacy of our homeschooling anyway. <br/>
I only saw it as being a really good thing for those who possessed the¬Ö <br/>
whatever it took¬Ö to actually do it.<br/>

&quot;Children will happily dig and fill holes all through the gardens of their <br/>

is only through repeatedly hammering our particular posts into those holes <br/>
that we set up fences around their learning.&quot;<br/>
