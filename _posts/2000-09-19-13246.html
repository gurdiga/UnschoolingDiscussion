<div id="ygrps-yiv-58537416">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a double-dose of education coverage from Japan in today&#39;s Daily <br/>
Yomiuri newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
Both of the opinion articles only mention home-based learning in passing, <br/>
but they are nevertheless worth a read for the background info they offer <br/>
about alternative and mainstream education in Japan. Website links are <br/>
provided below.<br/>
<br/>

Matters of Opinion:<br/>
&#39;FREE&#39; SCHOOLS STRIVE TO GIVE STUDENTS AN ALTERNATIVE<br/>

[Excerpt:]<br/>
&quot;Most primary and middle schools currently issue certificates of <br/>
graduation to students even if they do not attend any classes at all. <br/>
Although few are aware of this, this means students at free schools such <br/>
as Tokyo Shure can attend alternative schools and still graduate from <br/>
primary and middle schools as long as they are of the age at which <br/>
education is compulsory.&quot;<br/>

DEFIANT CHILDREN A PRODUCT OF SCHOOL RIGIDITY<br/>

[Excerpt:] <br/>
&quot;....Shunsuke Serizawa -- a prominent observer of educational issues -- <br/>
sees hope in the trends. He feels that schools should step down from <br/>
their godlike dais and families should rethink their priorities to bring <br/>
some humanity back into our society instead of focusing all on getting <br/>
their children ahead in the academic rat race.&quot;<br/>
