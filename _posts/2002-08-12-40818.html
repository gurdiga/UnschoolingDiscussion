<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519859841">It is so sad that there really ARE people coming to this list because they <br/>
want to learn about unschooling and leaving, disappointed and disillusioned, <br/>
not able to sift through  to find the gems of great unschooling information <br/>
that are mixed in with the vitriol and ranting and all the responses.<br/>
<br/>
So - here is a suggestion directly to those who do want to learn about and <br/>
talk about unschooling  -- try the unschooling.com message boards. <br/>
<br/>
Email lists are very difficult to manage -- and this one is one of the most <br/>
difficult. Message boards are way easier and can be divided up by topics -- <br/>
you can ask questions and get feedback AND easily read previous posts on the <br/>
topics of your choice. <br/>

and they use up too much online time.<br/>
