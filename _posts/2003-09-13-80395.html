 </span></blockquote>I thought it was pretty weird that they gave Alberta a better rating than<br/>
BC.  Then I saw that it&#39;s because Alberta has charter schools (or more of<br/>
them - I&#39;m pretty sure BC has some.)  As far as homeschooling goes, I<br/>
consider BC lots freer than Alberta.  We in BC have what Alberta has,<br/>
funding but with supervision, but we also have the option of no funding and<br/>
complete freedom, whcih they don&#39;t have in Alberta.<br/>
