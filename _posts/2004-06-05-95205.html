<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975226628">I thought I&#39;d throw in my two cents on this issue. I don&#39;t post often, but I <br/>
find it very interesting that some people do not think children as young as 3, <br/>
4, 5 are able to choose what they want to eat. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter was born in 2001. When she was a couple of months old she started <br/>
throwing up. This happened once a month pretty regularly, until she was about <br/>
18 mos (she would throw up and fall right to sleep). At about 18mos she <br/>
started becoming dizzy and disoriented, also. We took her to a couple of <br/>
specialists and the consensus was she was having migraines. Now our job was to find out <br/>
what was causing them. She had a major episode in Sept. of that year and then <br/>
nothing until Feb (that would be her last). By Nov. I had noticed she had quit <br/>
eating Fresh tomatoes. That was what was causing her episodes. They had <br/>
peaked in the summer because she was picking them off the vine in the garden.<br/>
She was not quite 2 when she figured this out for herself. She still doesn&#39;t <br/>
eat tomatoes and she has not had an episode in over a year.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So to think that children cannot determine what is or is not good for them is <br/>
in my opinion, absurd, especially since we have first hand knowledge that <br/>
they are quite capable.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve shared my cantalope story at some point before, but it <br/>
fits here.  When Matt was very little and I was still mega-monitoring <br/>
food (making sure each child got a certain amount of foods from each <br/>
food group each day), I MADE him (shudder) eat a piece of cantalope.  <br/>
He told me he didn&#39;t want it.  He told me cantalopes make his throat <br/>
hurt.  I told him that was silly, thinking he was just making an <br/>
excuse.  I forced him to eat it, and his lips swelled and he had <br/>
trouble breathing.  It was a near anaphylactic reaction, I almost <br/>
called 911. :(  <br/>
<br/>
I had NO idea that he was allergic to cantaloupe, but he knew that it <br/>
made his body feel icky when he ate it, and didn&#39;t want it.  <br/>
<br/>
So yes, kids definitely recognize when something isn&#39;t good for <br/>
them!  Kids who are allowed to learn to listen to their bodies and <br/>
trust their instincts about what to eat or not eat are very luck <br/>
kids! <br/>

strawberry.  He had tried them several times and said he didn&#39;t like <br/>
them, but then I realised that he was actually only licking them!  Have <br/>
you ever licked a strawberry? No flavour, just sort of rough and <br/>
slightly well, almost hairy.  Blurk!  So, believe it or not, I peeled a <br/>
strawberry for him and once he had licked that there was no stopping him!<br/>

<br/>
Maybe just go gradually until you do understand it.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of books out in the world but understanding a step at a <br/>
time  and moving into it slowly might be better than doing something you can&#39;t <br/>
explain.  But if you haven&#39;t read the stories at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/food">http://sandradodd.com/food</a> <br/>
there might be something there that will give you confidence.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son is probably the best &quot;advertisement&quot; for this way of eating. <br/>
My sister and i were talking on the phone about our food issues, and <br/>
how even if we are not hungry we will eat. Seamus looked utterly <br/>
confused, and said &quot;why would you eat if you arent hungry??&quot;...he <br/>
thinks the whole idea of eating for pleasure, or as a hobby, or out <br/>
of boredom is totally bizarre. Thank god. I think not passing on <br/>
weird food issues to him is the number one best thing i ever did as a <br/>
parent. I think nursing him &quot;on demand&quot;, for years, and delaying <br/>
solids provided a really good starting point. And a large part of it <br/>
is his own personality or genetic makeup i&#39;m sure...but i couldve <br/>
screwed it up by telling him to finish his plate, or using food as a <br/>
reward, and i didnt. <br/>
<br/>
If you have to explain it to someone, i think just talking about how <br/>
you are trying to encourage your child to listen to their own natural <br/>
body messages, and trying to not make certain foods more exciting <br/>
than they need to be by making them restricted or off limits. And <br/>
honestly, most kids--even if they are binging on a certain food for a <br/>
day or two or five---WILL get sick of &quot;junk&quot; food eventually. <br/>
<br/>
But mostly i have stopped trying to convince other people of anything <br/>
anymore. Too mentally taxing. I never thought i&#39;d be one of those <br/>
people who smile, and nod, and evasively say &quot;well we do what works <br/>
for us...&quot; but here i am!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830830585">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We just moved to Pennsylvania -- any Pennsylvanians on the list? It <br/>
seems that PA is not the friendliest of states for homeschoolers?. Any <br/>
info would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
A little background - we are long time homeschoolers, been unschooling <br/>
for a while. The girls decided they wanted to try school. My 14 year old <br/>
does not like it and wants to go back to homeschooling, so I need to get <br/>
the process going. I&#39;ve been doing a little research, and the process <br/>
looks rather difficult here.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much,<br/>

My kids too.  It is SO COOL.<br/>
Or they will say, &quot;I&#39;m kinda hungry, but I&#39;m going to eat with [whoever] in a <br/>
couple of hours, so I&#39;ll wait,&quot; OR &quot;I&#39;m hungry now, so I&#39;m just going to eat <br/>
now and later I&#39;ll just get a drink.&quot;   They plan ahead.  They don&#39;t even use <br/>
food for social purposes in the same way most people do.   They&#39;re aware of <br/>
whether they&#39;re hungry even at parties and dinners! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Amazing.   I didn&#39;t expect that when we started all this.<br/>
<br/>
There was an article in Mothering Magazine when Kirby was very young (one or <br/>
two?  So it would&#39;ve been 1988 or so I think) about toddlers making good <br/>
choices when they had choices, and we just never looked back.   I wonder if the <br/>
author of that article followed through to adulthood with hers?  <br/>

<br/>
Someone else brought a big back of Jolly Rancher miniatures here. They sat in <br/>
a bowl, and finally they were moved to a Ziploc gallon bag by my husband, who <br/>
had brought a Halloween bag from Costco of miniature Mars Bars, Snickers, <br/>
Twix.  Now we have a big bowl of those.   I&#39;ve eaten six, in four days.  Keith <br/>
picked out all the dark chocolate Mars bars (there weren&#39;t many).  The rest is <br/>
sitting.  The bowl went from mounded to flat, and there it sits.  I suppose if <br/>
many other kids come over some more will disappear.  I wouldn&#39;t be suprised if <br/>
some of it&#39;s still here at Halloween.  We can give the Jolly Ranchers away <br/>
then too, if we can&#39;t get Kirby to return them to the guy who bought them.<br/>
<br/>
Not that other people&#39;s friends and relatives might care, but there are <br/>
stories of kids making food choices that pleasantly surprised their parents here:<br/>
