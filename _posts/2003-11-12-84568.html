<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204595563">Ok... my decision was made last night. Got home from work and was <br/>
confronted with a note from my sons teacher that was sent home to <br/>
every child in class, basically blaming my son for getting the whole <br/>
class in trouble by &quot;making other kids laugh during centers&quot;. She <br/>
also vented about this problem to the friend who picked them up from <br/>
school for me.  My daughter, who hates to see her lil&#39; brother upset, <br/>
is also all for it now, so that will make it easier on all of us. My <br/>
problem is my work schedule. One week I work 5 days, the next only 2. <br/>
I already have a sitter lined up for the days I work that is <br/>
unschooling her kids at home, but am wondering if it will be too hard <br/>
on my children to be with her part time, then home with me the rest <br/>
of the time. Any thoughts?</div>

<br/>
Sounds like fun to me. They like the other kids and parent, right?<br/>
<br/>
When you say you work 5 days - are those full-time days so the kids <br/>
would be at the other family&#39;s for 9 or more hours each day?<br/>
<br/>
If so, doesn&#39;t mean this can&#39;t work - but that is a lot of time and you <br/>
might find you want to cut back. Is that possible?<br/>
<br/>
STILL sounds very very much better than the school situation.<br/>

Just got off the phone with my supervisor. She was able to change my <br/>
schedule so that I work every Friday, Saturday, 1/2 shift Sunday and 1/2 <br/>
shift every other Monday. I go into work at 5:30am, and get home around 8pm. <br/>
Long days, but more free days per week. Cutting back total hours is not <br/>
possible right now, but am thinking of selling this house and purchasing a <br/>
smaller house on a few acres that I found with the equity I have. No more <br/>
house payments &lt;g&gt;. I would be able to cut back at that point.<br/>

I don&#39;t think it will be hard for them at all.  Learning happens all the <br/>
time, and there are LOTS of hours in a week!    We were in a babysitting co-op <br/>
when my kids were little. It was before unschooling days, but I could see easily <br/>
how much they learned from being with other families in other places.  Two of <br/>
those families were unschooing families, so it doubtlessly helped me have <br/>
faith in unschooling, too, when we did decide not to send Kirby to kindergarten.<br/>

I think a long day might be harder for a young child than several shorter <br/>
days.  And is your babysitting friend as willing to keep your kids on the <br/>
weekends as on weekdays?<br/>
<br/>
For me, the weekend schedule sounds worse for kids and babysitters.<br/>

First thought - congratulations and good for you!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Second thoughts- what do you mean by hard on them? Are you concerned that<br/>
they will be missing you - surely no more than when they were in school and<br/>
had other stressors as well as that? Are you worried about the need to<br/>
deschool? I imagine that if your friend is an unschooler, she will be<br/>
familiar with that concept. Are you worried about them being with you too<br/>
much, instead of her? ;) Are you worried that they aren&#39;t going to have<br/>
enough other activities than being with the two of you? I really don&#39;t know<br/>
what your concern is, but if you clarify we may be able to help.<br/>
