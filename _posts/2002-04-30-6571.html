I love the Vidal Sassoon tagline &quot;If you don&#39;t look good we don&#39;t <br/>
look good.&quot;  It implies that even if you aren&#39;t using Vidal Sassoon <br/>
products they are still to be held accountable (due to unsuccessful <br/>
marketing of their product, presumably) for your attractiveness or <br/>
lack thereof.  As an unschooler who speaks out about the joys of <br/>
unschooling are you responsible for everyone who considers <br/>
unschooling?  Is it possible to lead a horse to unschooling?  Is it <br/>
possible to force said horse to drink even if they found the <br/>
unschooling on their own?  And is Vidal Sassoon really who I should <br/>
be taking to task for my bad hair days?<br/>

It&#39;s not really their ultimate success I&#39;m worried about so much as I&#39;m <br/>
concerned with my own integrity.  If I make a promise that can&#39;t be kept, or <br/>
an offer that can&#39;t be made good, then there is a morals problem.<br/>

&lt;&lt;And I don&#39;t know how it is possible to prevent people from believing <br/>
that unschooling is a means to an end.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible at first to even begin to suggest it&#39;s not a <br/>
means to an end.  And, early on, most have a definite purpose they need <br/>
unschooling to serve, which is to homeschool without doing school-damage <br/>
themselves.  In and around all else, unschooling can be the means to that end.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;free bonus&quot; stuff is harder to describe.  The sustenance of curiosity, <br/>
the bone-deep joy of discovery, all that magical-byproduct stuff ends up <br/>
being more important to most unschoolers early on.  But it&#39;s hard to <br/>
&quot;advertise&quot; that or teach it.<br/>
<br/>
When someone&#39;d taking a child out of school, they have an emergency need.  If <br/>
we tell them all &quot;Unschooling will work for you,&quot; we don&#39;t really know for <br/>
sure it will work for them.  We&#39;re being hypothetical.  <br/>
<br/>
Another way unschooling can be seen as a means to an end is if your goal is <br/>
to have a long and peaceful relationship with your children, one which will <br/>
last past their &quot;school years.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
But I think I see your point, that when it becomes a way of life, that it <br/>
becomes just... life!<br/>

<br/>
But, what do you mean by unschooling?  Do you mean following the  <br/>
steps around the room that others have taken, or do you mean dancing <br/>
in whatever way your feet move?  I think that the reason unschooling <br/>
lists are full of questions about how unschooling works is because <br/>
there isn&#39;t a definable how.  Unschooling works when you stop <br/>
schooling and start exploring. And it will work for them, but <br/>
unschooling is as much about an adult learning as it is about a <br/>
child learning.  Unschooling is life.  How do you get life right?  <br/>
And how can you make any guarantees about others ability to live <br/>
life?  And how can you reassure people who believe that schooling is <br/>
difficult that learning doesn&#39;t have to be?  You reach into your <br/>
Buddhist bag and you live your life in the way that best <br/>
demonstrates a life well lived.  You make yourself accessible to <br/>
questions.  You become the showcase family for unschooling.  And, <br/>
well, haven&#39;t you done that.  If someone gets unschooling they get <br/>
it.  Maybe with lots of help and encouragement and handholding. If <br/>
someone doesn&#39;t get unschooling they get on-line (with all do <br/>
respect) and spout spelling rules as evidence that life cannot <br/>
produce all learning and that what they are doing is the best way to <br/>
do things.  <br/>
<br/>
I think you are being too hard on yourself.  You cannot know what <br/>
child is a musician, nor what person is ripe for unschooling.  Who <br/>
are you to tell people not to reach for the brass ring even if they <br/>
are way, way too short?  Maybe they&#39;ll go over to the carnie section <br/>
of the fair and win a grabber and come back and surprise you.  Or <br/>
maybe they won&#39;t, and when their child is 9 and not reading or <br/>
spelling correctly they will turn away from unschooling.  And they <br/>
will say that unschooling didn&#39;t serve them, that it is a bogus and <br/>
fraudulant system and that Sandra Dodd is a silly old cow for <br/>
telling them that their child would end up knowing everything they <br/>
needed to know without being schooled at home.  That is a risk you <br/>
take by spouting out for what you believe in.  <br/>

unschooling is as much about an adult learning as it is about a <br/>

<br/>
It is possible to live a life and avoid learning, or downplay it, or <br/>
pooh-pooh or insult it.<br/>

Unschooling needs to be a rich life with learning as one of the happy <br/>
priorities.<br/>
