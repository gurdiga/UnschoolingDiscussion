 </span></blockquote>Kate, I have watched your explanations and frustration and sympathize with <br/>
you as I see much of our own style of schooling in what you have described. <br/>
Without living in your home I can&#39;t say that it is the SAME but I do see many <br/>
similarities and I want to thank you for the things you are saying.  You <br/>
speak for me and perhaps others too (can&#39;t speak for them, just a guess.)<br/>
I&#39;m not a COMPLETE unschooler, however, I have come to see homeschooling as <br/>
having one goal: teaching learning.  Not that my child doesn&#39;t learn on her <br/>
own. She does.  But there are very valuable tools that I can give her to help <br/>
her learn MORE and resources that she doesn&#39;t know about that I can expose <br/>
her to so that she can learn more and love to learn more.<br/>
Thank you for your eloquent and sometimes frustrated responses. They&#39;ve <br/>
mirrored my own at times in reading some posts and trying to discern just why <br/>
there is such a seemingly rigid line drawn in the term unschooling. That <br/>
puzzles me more than anything. Maybe someone can help me grasp that &quot;line&quot; <br/>
that I observe.  I realize that homeschooling is not unschooling and <br/>
unschooling is not homeschooling.  I see unschooling as a method of <br/>
homeschooling and I too blend, using direction, guidance, maturity and my <br/>
role as her parent to turn her on to things that she is excited about. There <br/>
are things she wouldn&#39;t even know she would be excited about if I didn&#39;t <br/>
guide her toward them. Perhaps that is what unschooling is? Providing as many <br/>
opportunities and freedoms to learn?<br/>
Kudos Kate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-94741284">Kristine, perhaps looking at what you and Kate have written will help to<br/>
understand the difference between UNschooling and eclectic/relaxed<br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
For example, you can&#39;t combine UNschooling with types of schooling and still<br/>
be unschooling, that is what eclectic/relaxed homeschooling is all about.<br/>
<br/>
Kate mentions &quot;required and coerced&quot; reading lists.  That isn&#39;t UNschooling,<br/>
it might be eclectic but &quot;sounds&quot; more like school at home.<br/>
<br/>
You mention &quot;teaching learning&quot; as a goal.  UNschoolers have a goal of<br/>
raising a happy, healthy child who acquires the knowledge they want and need<br/>
without anyone having to &quot;teach&quot; them UNLESS they ask for help and then most<br/>
of us would &quot;help,&quot; not sit down and &quot;teach.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you &quot;blend, using direction, guidance, maturity and my role as her parent<br/>
to turn her on to things that she is excited about,&quot; then you are using the<br/>
eclectic/relaxed homeschooling method.  And if that works for you and your<br/>
family is happy with it, then that is great.  However, it isn&#39;t unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It tells me that you haven&#39;t reached the point where you can &quot;let go&quot; and,<br/>
as son #3 puts it, &quot;go with the flow.&quot;  And it isn&#39;t to say that as<br/>
unschoolers we don&#39;t provide any stimulous to encourage exploring new or<br/>
different avenues, it simply means that we don&#39;t decide that we know what is<br/>
best.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m continually off doing things that are new and different and the kidlets<br/>
may follow along or they may not.  We have a house full of &quot;stuff&quot; and they<br/>
may or maynot explore those varous avenues.  Their choice.<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe the difference could be that I say, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m going to<br/>
Artie&#39;s, ya wanna come along,&quot; and eclectic/relaxed homeschoolers would say,<br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s go to Arties.  I&#39;m going to buy some art supplies so you can paint a<br/>
picture.  You can *help* ME choose the colors.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, I do hold the title of CAM (ClearAsMud), but does that help somewhat?<br/>
