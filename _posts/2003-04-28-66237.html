Hi Nancy,<br/>
I know just where Commerce is!  My husband worked in Greenville for about <br/>
two months and we spent a lot of time there.  Downtown is so cute!  Are you <br/>
ever on this side of town?  Maybe we could get together!<br/>

Hi! Jennifer,I am new to this board and new to unschooling. I have been <br/>
homeschooling for 4 years, but have recently decided to unschool. I live in <br/>
Commerce, TX which is about 50 miles north east of Dallas. Nancy<br/>
