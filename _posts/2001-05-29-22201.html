&lt;&lt; I&#39;m sure you posted that you would be away for a few days or something, <br/>
but <br/>
if so, I missed it, and I missed you. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was at a big (big) SCA event--Grand Outlandish.  The whole &quot;population&quot; of <br/>
the town (which is usually an unimproved county park full of cactus) was <br/>
1,100 people.  Our camp was 21 people, six of them homeschoolers from 9 to <br/>
17.   We had a dining room where we served medieval food by candlelight each <br/>
night.  Even breakfasts were in wooden or metal plates. Drinks were juice, <br/>
water, wine (cheated and had tea for the caffein addicts) out of ceramic or <br/>
wood or blown glass.<br/>
<br/>
There is something charming about that, but there&#39;s something totally insane. <br/>
 It took two pickup truck loads, three vanloads and a sedan with a big trunk. <br/>
 (OH WAIT!  Kirby&#39;s girlfriend has another sedan and HER trunk was full.)  <br/>
Coming back, though, three sedan-loads (a friend who had gone back to get <br/>
something she left offered to let us fill her car up too), my mini-van and <br/>
only pickup truck loads.  I&#39;ll be doing laundry and dishes for another couple <br/>
of days.  We had five &quot;period pavilions&quot; in our camp, augmented by two cabin <br/>
tents and a few nylon domes hidden further back.  <br/>
<br/>
I taught a class on braiding &quot;gold&quot; (represented by yarn in this instance) <br/>
into hair, and things to do with French braids and then adding stuff to <br/>
extend the braids (kind of medieval hair extensions, which was done with <br/>
metallics and suchlike for formal occasions sometimes in the good old <br/>
medieval days).  I took a class on the Sutton Hoo burials, taught by someone <br/>
wo was once my apprentice within the club and is now getting a master&#39;s <br/>
degree in archeology in York, in England.   I remember her being just a goofy <br/>
young girl taking a French class and a history class at the University of New <br/>
Mexico but mostly partying.<br/>
<br/>
Someone who&#39;s a protege of mine took his second squire, and I was there for <br/>
the ceremony.<br/>
<br/>
We are all totally exhausted.  <br/>
<br/>
Today I took a friend to the dollar movie because she was in a car accident <br/>
yesterday (not her fault) and most of her parts are bruised and they sent her <br/>
away from work to rest (she was in finishing a memo and they said &quot;WHAT!?  Go <br/>
home, okay?&quot;) and I forgot it was Tuesday when Kirby&#39;s supposed to teach a <br/>
karate class at 4:00 and take a class at 5:00.    My husband figured it out, <br/>
came home early and took him, but late.<br/>
<br/>
That has been my weekend so far. <br/>
<br/>
Oh.  It&#39;s late Tuesday.  Weekend is over.  <br/>
Not quite.  Must bring in more coolers and dirty laundry now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the kind words.  I&#39;m back.<br/>
<br/>
