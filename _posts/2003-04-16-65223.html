<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712496833">&lt;&lt;  And I&#39;m not so sure<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>with it<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; either if it was their child. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;I&#39;m not so sure they wouldn&#39;t!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WOW those two things are hard to read.  <br/>
<br/>
I think one person said<br/>
I&#39;m thinking some people who said &quot;no problem&quot; WOULD have a problem if it <br/>
were their child.<br/>
<br/>
I believe maybe the second person said <br/>
You&#39;re right, maybe they would have a problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I would not bet even a quarter on it because they were so twisty-turny <br/>
with conditionals and negatives that I had no idea which was &quot;yes&quot; and which <br/>
was &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible for someone to be supportive of someone else doing something <br/>
without them actually being willing, able or interested in doing it <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a tattoo, but when a teenaged friend got one last week, I said <br/>
&quot;Cool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That didn&#39;t mean, &quot;COOL!  I SHALL HAVE AN IDENTICAL TATTOO TOMORROW!&quot;  It <br/>
meant, &quot;I see you like it, and it&#39;s kinda cute.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have friends who think our unschooling is just great for my kids and our <br/>
family.  They wouldn&#39;t do it themselves for various reasons, but they can say <br/>
&quot;I think what you&#39;re doing is good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So if someone who isn&#39;t brave enough to have one boy with hair to his waist <br/>
and another in the same family with a shaved head had said (before Kirby&#39;s <br/>
haircut last fall) &quot;That&#39;s cool that Kirby&#39;s hair is over two feet longer <br/>
than Marty&#39;s&quot; they&#39;re not being hypocritical, they&#39;re expressing approval or <br/>
admiration for courage or a wish they were braver or something.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are so opposed to homosexuality in reality or appearance that <br/>
they would prevent their child from giving any hint of even being aware of <br/>
it, and even if transgender stuff is shown to be as natural as brown eyes <br/>
they will deny it because the Bible says something.  And even if a wholly <br/>
heterosexual man wanted to wear something pink and silky, it would be called <br/>
sin by some people.  And if I lived in a neighborhood filled with people who <br/>
felt that way, I&#39;d probably be more careful about what my kids wore and did <br/>
and said, too.  And I&#39;d be cleaning the house to sell it, because my kids are <br/>
more important to me than impressing the  neighbors is.<br/>
<br/>
Better to have looser neighbors, if that&#39;s a doable thing.<br/>
