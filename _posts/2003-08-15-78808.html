Hey!  I have no idea what you just asked.<br/>
<br/>
But if you ask it again in a way a woman who spent the whole day at<br/>
Wal-mart with her eighty-one year old mother and eighty-five year old<br/>
aunt can understand, I&#39;ll give it a whirl.<br/>

Just generally read about the whole idea of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You could use google.com to find things, but here are a couple of starting <br/>
places with lots of links:<br/>

I love my Dad, God Bless him...but he just got a new computer.  He&#39;s never <br/>
had a computer, or used one...ever.  Until last week, he typed all his letters <br/>
on a black, manual, hundred pound typewriter I think he got in high school <br/>
(he&#39;s 76).  We&#39;d get these sweet letters with lots of white-out splotched all over <br/>
it...:o)<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s coming along, but it took about a week for him to learn how to turn it <br/>
on and sign on to AOL, let alone to figure out what to do once it&#39;s signed on!  <br/>
He didn&#39;t even know how to use a mouse...He lives in CA, we&#39;re in WV, so you <br/>
can imagine the long phone conversations we&#39;ve had with me trying to explain <br/>
everything to him as we go along.  Thank God he&#39;s got a couple of cool college <br/>
student neighbors that are helping him along...<br/>

You might want to see if your library has Grace Llewellyn&#39;s book The <br/>
Teenge Liberation handbook.  As I recall it has a whole chapter on how <br/>
to sell your parents on homeschooling (should also work for unschooling).<br/>
