<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421404799">When I lived in a different place, I had squirrels and birds.  I fed the squirrels, and they never bothered the feeders...this was not why<br/>
I fed the squirrels though...I loved to watch them.  Now we live in the middle of a Field so to speak.  We have planted trees all around,<br/>
but since it is a far run (for squirrels) to our trees from the woods, we don&#39;t have any close.  I miss them believe it or not!  :)<br/>
