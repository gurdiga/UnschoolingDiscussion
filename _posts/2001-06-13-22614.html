<div id="ygrps-yiv-812220142">Hi hope this helps! the &quot;ball and stick&quot; (the ones we all learned to print as <br/>
children in gradeschool.) letters you refer to are easy to reproduce, and I <br/>
believe that the font &quot;Penmanship Print&quot; shows the way to make these. If you <br/>
are not totally adverse to workbooks there are TONS out there to look at. <br/>
Also, I wanted my kids to learn to print in a way that would make the <br/>
transition to cursive easier so I taught them Italic handwriting. There are <br/>
also TONS of workbooks for that as well. If you e-mail me privately I will <br/>
look through out my font files to see where I got the &quot;Penmanship Print&quot; <br/>
font, I believe it was a free download, but I am not sure. I will start my <br/>
search. I know that as unschoolers most of us don&#39;t use workbooks, but when <br/>
my in-laws and parents have gotten that &quot;my grandkids aren&#39;t learning what <br/>
they should be&quot; bug up their... and they send us books and workbooks, my kids <br/>
do seem to enjoy using them on their own terms and when/how they want. (not <br/>
usually how the instructions say to use them) So getting a few handwriting <br/>
workbooks that are bright and easy, w/o too much &quot;teacher&quot; in them isn&#39;t too <br/>
bad. (In my opinion.) Let us know how this works out! And as for bi-lingual <br/>
kids, we have found that exposure is the best! We live in a mixed <br/>
neighborhood where english and spanish are spoken, both my children like to <br/>
go to friends homes and learn spanish from their friends and their friends <br/>
parents. We also have a spanish CD rom for the kids to use. It is a bit <br/>
schoolish, and geared toward older teens and adults, but the kids do like <br/>
finding words they know and learning new ones to &quot;show off&quot; Good Luck!:o) <br/>
