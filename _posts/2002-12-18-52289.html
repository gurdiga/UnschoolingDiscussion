Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
I am way behind with this list.  I actually noticed the description <br/>
at a Boiron display .<br/>
<br/>
As to to your recommending homeopathy to Shyrley I have to say<br/>
<br/>
HEAR! HEAR!<br/>
<br/>
Homeopathy has really changed our lives and absolutely enhanced our <br/>
quality of life. If I ever go back to school, it would be to become a <br/>
certified homeopath.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

&gt;You mean the proving symptoms? You&#39;ll have to read them on a Materia <br/>
&gt;Medica. It&#39;s not a big remedy, but one of its main features is that <br/>
&gt;it helps speed up the healing process of broken bones and other <br/>
&gt;injuries (periosteum, cartilages, etc.).<br/>

&gt;&gt;What&#39;s the proving for Symphytum? Liza  At 9:58 AM -0500 12/13/02, <br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Go to the health food store and get homeopathic Arnica 30X (or <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;30c) and Symphytum 30X (or 30c). If it&#39;s inflammed and feels <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;bruised, give the arnica (two pellets) every couple hour until it <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;feels better. Try to avoid any other painkillers. If if&#39;s too <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;painful, give the arnica more frequently. Then you can give the <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;symphytum (two pellets) twice a day for a few days, to speed up <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;the process of healing.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;If you can&#39;t find the symphytum, give her comfrey tea, or email me <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;if you have any questions.<br/>
