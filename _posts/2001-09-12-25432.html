<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974813336">I read an article in the July issue of Readers Digest about this. The <br/>
article is called &quot;Whats that supposed to mean?&quot; It pretty much said that <br/>
sometimes we take things the wrong way because in the past we were put down <br/>
or judged by things we believe in causing an over-sensitivity to those <br/>
issues. It dealt mainly with family, but I think it extends outward to <br/>
anyone who has something to say about how we live/do things, especially if <br/>
your like me, (and most of you?), who does things SO differently than <br/>
mainstream society. I enjoy being odd/strange/bizzare :) The things/ideas I <br/>
believe in are very important to me! If people are happy with what they have <br/>
then I am happy for them :) Happiness and peace within our own selves!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Sandra, you said recently you&#39;re here to talk about unschooling, not<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; socialize. Nevertheless, if you wish not just to talk, but to be<br/>
&gt;heard,<br/>
&gt; &gt; you&#39;ll need to resort to a few social skills.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Annette<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bridget is free to speak frankly here and has done so.  As have many<br/>
&gt;others.  Sandra should not be the exception.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sandra, I realize you don&#39;t need anyones approval but I enjoy your input.<br/>
&gt;  I&#39;ll expect an ass kicking when I have it coming. &lt;g&gt; ( could be any<br/>
&gt;minute now )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I am wondering if we&#39;re not all overly sensitive to some comments<br/>
&gt;because we&#39;ve already been picked at so much by so many for our<br/>
&gt;educational choices.  Maybe educational choice equals parenting and then<br/>
&gt;it feels like a personal attack?<br/>
&gt;But if we&#39;re only looking for total agreement in our ponderings most of<br/>
&gt;us could  just talk with our partners.  Support is wonderful but<br/>
&gt;shouldn&#39;t it be support for good stuff?<br/>
&gt;Anyone here has a right to spank or use time out or whatever, but should<br/>
&gt;those opposed have to say,  &quot; It&#39;s ok dear, we know you&#39;re doing what you<br/>
&gt;feel is best.&quot; ?<br/>
&gt;( look ma, no Satan )    No judgment intended here, I&#39;m just asking.  Do<br/>
&gt;we come here just to be coddled or are we hoping to learn something about<br/>
&gt;ourselves and the truth and therefore, unschooling.  My son has<br/>
&gt;everything to lose if I can&#39;t get it right.<br/>
