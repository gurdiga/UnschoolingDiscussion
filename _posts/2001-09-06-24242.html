<div id="ygrps-yiv-557943400">.&gt;&gt;  So do I stop him from doing that and <br/>
unload the dishwasher myself and take this opportunity to do more washing and <br/>
tidy up a bit or stop him from what he&#39;s doing?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t mind- but I am gonna post something I posted to another list, &#39;cause maybe it will be helpful- it is about &quot;chores&quot; in general.<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;  And I am beginning to feel very uncomfortable with the &quot;chore&quot; concept.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree- &quot;chores&quot; seem to foster non-cooperation around here...&quot;that is not<br/>
MY chore!&quot;,  &quot;It is Reed&#39;s turn!&quot;, &quot;I did it yesterday!&quot;...bla bla bla<br/>
<br/>
We are much more co-operative without the &quot;chore&quot; mentality.   This has<br/>
been a recent revisited topic for me because I had a new baby. Things like<br/>
this started going through my head, &quot;I think I have been a SLAVE!&quot;- &quot;while<br/>
I am laying around (hee hee!) cuddling my baby- NOTHING gets done!&quot;-<br/>
<br/>
so I resorted to &quot;chores&quot; and even one of my favorite techniques,<br/>
&quot;yelling&quot;. (! ha)<br/>
<br/>
Those didn&#39;t result in the effect I was going for.... (and I think getting<br/>
in the spot where I am &quot;going for an effect&quot; on other people is also not<br/>
really where I want to be anyway).  I needed to look at myself and my<br/>
attitudes- here I am thinking  &quot;I didn&#39;t make THAT painting mess!- why<br/>
should I always have to clean up others stuff&quot;- and SURPRISE, everyone<br/>
littler than me is thinking the same thing...(love this CC stuff)<br/>
<br/>
Fundamentally important is for me to maintain a helpful, co-operative<br/>
attitude myself.  Here is an example of something that happened while I was<br/>
relearning (lordy! it never ends!) this stuff.<br/>
<br/>
So we were hanging out in the yard, and Chloe (13) goes and gets the weed<br/>
eater and proceeds to trim up the edges.  &quot;How great&quot; I think, &quot;I never get<br/>
around to that..&quot;.   Well anyway, later, I see that she has left the<br/>
trimmer in the middle of the lawn and it is still plugged in (mess)- she is<br/>
in the house and I caught myself just as I was about to yell back to the<br/>
house- no joke- &quot;Gosh darn it Chloe!  the weed wacker is still out here-<br/>
get out here and pick it up...&quot;  BUT!  instead I thought stuff like, &quot;if it<br/>
was my friend- I would love to put it away for her if she forgot...Im out<br/>
here- why can&#39;t I do it, it is so simple...&quot; stuff like that<br/>
<br/>
(yeah now there is a &quot;chore&quot; mentality, isnt it- you are right there<br/>
looking at the &quot;chore&quot; (yeah, and it is something like,&quot;put your cup in the<br/>
dishwasher after you use it&quot;)- your kid is like, at the next door<br/>
nieghbor&#39;s house, and you walk to were they are and say, &quot;well get over<br/>
here and do YOUR chore!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
anyway, SO- I just gladly, open heartedly put the tool away thinking, &quot;that<br/>
was so nice of her to trim up- I am glad to help with putting away&quot;  And<br/>
when I went in the house- I said, &quot;OH! Chloe- I put away the weed eater for<br/>
you :-)&quot; she goes, &quot;oh thanks, mom. I totally forgot&quot;.  AHH!  It felt so<br/>
good to just have that warm, helping feeling towards her...that is the<br/>
feeling I want to have all the time!  And SURPRISE, everyone seemed to<br/>
adopt the same sweet attitude---modeling, modeling, modeling, (you guys<br/>
aren&#39;t surprised at all, hu?).  But I think the most important thing is<br/>
that I was happier. I was being who I want to be, kind and warm and openly<br/>
giving.  Then I am happy- I like myself.<br/>
<br/>
(yipes, sounds like I am Mother Thereasa!  rrriiiiiiight!  I AM the woman!-<br/>
don&#39;t forget that list!)<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Bronwen<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-957762190">Ok... I&#39;m going full steam ahead with this unschooling thing... So here are <br/>
some questions for you old timers that I would love to have feedback from.  <br/>
I&#39;m looking for your experience.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I had Zak unload the dishwasher as we are incorporating him doing <br/>
chores as part of the household.  I was going to do that this morning, but as <br/>
we speak he is playing Jump Start Kindergarten on his computer and he&#39;s <br/>
showing Max (2 years old) how it works.  So do I stop him from doing that and <br/>
unload the dishwasher myself and take this opportunity to do more washing and <br/>
tidy up a bit or stop him from what he&#39;s doing?<br/>
<br/>
I know this may seem a no brainer to many of you, but for me that has been <br/>
part of my back and forth with homeschooling.  How much do I just let him do <br/>
what he wants.  Right now they are both together and Zak is learning about <br/>
spelling.<br/>
<br/>
Help!!!<br/>

Run to the dishwasher and do the dishes!!! LOL.  . . if it were me, and I <br/>
wanted to do the dishes I would. If I wanted to be doing something else, that <br/>
is where I would be. Probably I would take the opportunity to read for a bit <br/>
myself. . .<br/>

<br/>
You could ask them both to come and help, but they might not get back to the <br/>
cool and valuable thing they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
You could go and do something altogether different and out of the kitchen so <br/>
you&#39;re not thinking about the dishwasher.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I think it would be more fun and more productive for you to <br/>
unload the dishwasher WITH Zak instead of making him do it without you.  If <br/>
you do it together he learns more about what/how/where, and you have a chance <br/>
to talk with him about whatever comes up while you&#39;re together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-345838924">Don&#39;t break the spell.  IMHO, if you really want him to help with the<br/>
chores, then let the dishes sit in the dishwasher until he takes a break.<br/>
The dishes aren&#39;t going anywhere &lt;g&gt; so they get to wait.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204873329">As with all great questions, the answer is &quot;it depends.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These are some things I try to think about:<br/>
<br/>
1) Is what I want the child to do something he has agreed to do? or is it<br/>
just some great idea that I had and thought he would like?<br/>
<br/>
2) Is it necessary that the child do the task &quot;right now?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
3) Is what I want the child to do somehow more important than what the child<br/>
wants to do (needs to put on coat BEFORE playing in snow, etc.)?<br/>
<br/>
Usually we talk about chores and stuff ahead of time, the kids know what<br/>
they are expected to do and when.  If it isn&#39;t necessary that the chore be<br/>
done right now (do dishes before guests arrive), I ask the child when they<br/>
would like to do it.  Usually, that is all it takes.  Sometimes I come back<br/>
at the set time and remind them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511454745">Oh, ho, ho, ho Bronwen!!<br/>
Life is such a hard trip isn&#39;t it.  Just when we think we&#39;ve &quot;got it&quot;!  Life jumps up and says NOT!<br/>
I try hard to be a friend to my kids, but it is so hard to do....<br/>
Wonderful example you have illustrated for us....<br/>
My 8 yr old is the worlds best kid.  I mean he empties the dehumidifier when it is full or almost full without me even saying anything.  He has<br/>
always been a kind, loving, thoughtful child.  I try hard to find the positive in each of my kids, and then tell them about it.<br/>
This weekend was particularly hard for me...we had to put our dog down.  He wasn&#39;t sick, or old, but just ...sigh...what do you call it?<br/>
Protective, neurotic...ect...  anyway, he was my buddy, and this was SO EXTREMELY hard for me.  I cried alot and hard, but was honest with the kids<br/>
on how bad I felt.  The day after the kids brought me breakfast in bed because I felt so sad.<br/>
These kids are 8, 6 and 5.<br/>
It pays off to be honest and even more than that HUMAN with our kids.<br/>
We all have our positive points as well as our faults....<br/>
We must admit this to our kids so they see this is life.<br/>
We make a mistake (yell just because we are crabby and tired) then we apologize and explain.<br/>
I don&#39;t care how young a child is, they can understand in their own way an apology, and a humanness.  (if that is even a word)<br/>
Okay, enough rambling....<br/>
