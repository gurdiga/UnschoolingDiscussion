<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is deep<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; I dreamed I had an interview with God.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&quot;Come in,&quot; God said. &quot;So, you would like to interview Me?&quot;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;If you have the time,&quot; I said.<br/>
&gt;&gt;God smiled and said: &quot;My time is eternity and is enough<br/>
&gt;  to do everything; what questions do you have in mind to ask me?&quot;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&quot;What surprises you most about mankind?&quot;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;God answered:<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&quot;That they get bored of being children,<br/>
&gt;  &gt;are in a rush to grow up,<br/>
&gt;  &gt;and then long to be children again.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;That they lose their health to make money<br/>
&gt;  &gt;and then  lose their money to restore their health.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;That by thinking anxiously about the future,<br/>
&gt;  &gt;they forget the present, such that they live<br/>
&gt;  &gt;neither for the present nor the future.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;That they live as if they will never die,<br/>
&gt;  &gt;and they die as if they had never lived...&quot;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;God&#39;s hands took mine and we were silent for while and then I asked...<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&quot;As a parent, what are some of life&#39;s lessons you want your children to<br/>
&gt;  learn?&quot;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; God replied with a smile:<br/>
&gt;  &gt; &quot;To learn that they cannot make anyone love them. What they can do is<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;  let themselves be loved.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;To learn that what is most valuable<br/>
&gt;  &gt;is not what they have in their lives,<br/>
&gt;  &gt; but who they have in their lives.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; To learn that it is not good<br/>
&gt;  &gt;to compare themselves to others.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;All will be judged individually on their own merits, not as a group on a<br/>
&gt;  comparison basis!<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  To learn that a rich person is<br/>
&gt;  &gt;not the one who has the most,<br/>
&gt;  &gt;but is one who needs the least.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;To learn that it only takes a few seconds<br/>
&gt;  &gt;to open profound wounds in persons we love,<br/>
&gt;  &gt;and that it takes many years to heal them.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;To learn to forgive by practicing forgiveness.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;To learn that there are persons that love them dearly, but simply do not<br/>
&gt;  know how to express or show their feelings.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;To learn that money can buy everything but happiness.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  To learn that two people can look at the same thing and see it totally<br/>
&gt;  different.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;To learn that a true friend is someone who<br/>
&gt;  &gt;knows everything about them...and likes them anyway.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;To learn that it is not always enough<br/>
&gt;  &gt;that they be forgiven by others,<br/>
&gt;  &gt;but that they have to forgive themselves.&quot;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;I sat there for awhile enjoying the moment.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;I thanked Him for his time and for all that<br/>
&gt;  &gt;He has done for me and my family,<br/>
&gt;  &gt;and He replied, &quot;Anytime. I&#39;m here 24 hours a day. All you have to do is<br/>
&gt;  ask for me, and I&#39;ll answer.&quot;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;&gt;People will forget what you said.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;&gt;People will forget what you did,<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;&gt;but people will never forget<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;&gt;how you made them feel.<br/>
