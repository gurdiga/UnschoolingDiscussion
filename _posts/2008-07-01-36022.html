<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763572867">it all goes back to that &#39;one size fits all&#39; theory.  my mother works <br/>
at an elementary school (secretary) but i&#39;ve met teachers that are <br/>
the same too.  the idea is, &#39;well, i have a degree, so i &#39;must&#39; know <br/>
what i&#39;m talking about&#39;.  my mom doesn&#39;t even have a degree..she <br/>
can&#39;t shut up about it either!!  i&#39;m bordering on unschool/homeschool <br/>
w/curriculum. (depends on subject) yet i still get the &#39;the child <br/>
needs to be in a classroom!&#39;  why?  even if i &#39;am&#39; teaching them <br/>
(math/reading per hubby&#39;s request, they guide themselves on science <br/>
and history, compromis;)   the same stuff, why do they need to be in <br/>
a classroom with little to no one-on-one attention??? <br/>
people seem to think, as parents, we don&#39;t know what&#39;s best for our <br/>
child.  we don&#39;t immediately have a &#39;degree&#39; with the baby as it is <br/>
rushed out of our system.  so, why would we know????  truth be told, <br/>
we are the ones that know our child best.  we can identify behaviors, <br/>
know exactly what they want, recognize all the little signs that they <br/>
show and immediatly know how to make them happy/take care of them.  <br/>
would throwing them out into the so-called &#39;real-world&#39; with <br/>
a &#39;professional&#39; that has never met your child, nor recognize any of <br/>
their behavior be better?  <br/>
i sincerely doubt it.<br/>
you know your son.  you know what he wants out of life (well, i&#39;m <br/>
assumming he&#39;s shared it with you;)  but you know how to get him <br/>
there because you know &#39;him&#39;.  not every child has the same path, <br/>
every child is different.  they are not the same as the ps <br/>
wants/insist them to be.  it bothers me to when people say stuff like <br/>
that.  i think it&#39;s their arrogance that bothers me the most!! if you <br/>
don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about-keep your mouth shut!! sounds <br/>
harsh, doesn&#39;t it;)  i&#39;ve been doing this for some 3 years now...you <br/>
(or maybe it&#39;s just me) tend to get fed up after a while...  my kids <br/>
have &#39;so many&#39; other qualities to discuss...why are you focusing on <br/>
this????<br/>

She may be absolutely convinced she&#39;s right, but she&#39;s only guessing.  <br/>
There isn&#39;t a way for her to know since neither she nor anyone she&#39;s  <br/>
learned what she knows from has ever met a mindfully parented  <br/>
unschooled child with Aspergers. She has *zero* knowledge of the  <br/>
effects of supporting a child with specially needs who is growing up  <br/>
outside of school.<br/>
<br/>
Better to listen to people who have had first hand experience, isn&#39;t it?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My brother lived in my parent&#39;s basement for nearly three years with<br/>
his wife and two children while he went to law school.  That&#39;s what<br/>
parents are for isn&#39;t it - supporting their children when they are<br/>
needed?!?!  <br/>
<br/>
You can shop around for &quot;professionals&quot; to help your child but no<br/>
matter their expertise they will never have the time, knowledge, or<br/>
investment in your child that you do.  My son has a wonderful teacher<br/>
from his public school days that is still a friend of his - he sends<br/>
postcards from vacation, visits with her at the library, and values<br/>
her as a person.  He has the same type of relationships with<br/>
homeschoolers, librarians, and family.  (There&#39;s more than one way to<br/>
skin a cat...)  <br/>
<br/>
You are probably shaken up because you have concerns about his future<br/>
- I think most parents have moments of worry about their children&#39;s<br/>
futures.  If a parent defines a child as a special needs person, their<br/>
expectations can be influenced accordingly.  On the other hand, her<br/>
extreme viewpoint hardly lends itself to discussion or consideration -<br/>
 believe it or not she probably has his best interests at heart...<br/>
<br/>
Since we do not have a basement, we need to work extra hard at this<br/>
parenting stuff!!!!!! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

Our goal is to figure out how to listen and interpret what they want.  <br/>
Our goal is to help them find ways to get what they want is safe and  <br/>

But we can keep trying to help them with the goal of a happy child in  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s really helpful for unschooling to not think in terms of  <br/>
teaching. It&#39;s also very helpful to not divide the world into subjects.<br/>
<br/>
An unschooler doesn&#39;t do curriculum for math. Though they may add  <br/>
some kind of more formal math or whatever to their lives to help a  <br/>
husband transition. But to help move towards unschooling, it&#39;s not a  <br/>
good idea to see the curriculum as fulfilling any math learning at  <br/>
all. Math learning will come from living life.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve seen over and over again how truly devastating school is for kids<br/>
with aspergers.  Kids NEED all those experts because the school system<br/>
is so wrong for them, it&#39;s a counter balance way of helping a kid that<br/>
truly shouldn&#39;t be there.  Just for the record, I don&#39;t think aspergers<br/>
is a disability.  Depending on what traits your child has, they are more<br/>
or less intense then in someone with extreme aspergers.<br/>
<br/>
If you can recognize that your child has aspergers, see how it effects<br/>
him, and then help let go of the label and see him for who he is, you<br/>
can move away from having a child with a disability, one that needs to<br/>
be fixed to having a child that needs extra support and help in this or<br/>
that area.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there is so little known about aspergers that there such a thing<br/>
as a team of experts is almost laughable.  The term aspergers was just<br/>
getting out there about 10 or so years ago, before that it was called<br/>
something else.  How can experts suddenly arise in 10 or so years in so<br/>
great a quantity as to be able to plant them in every school for every<br/>
kid diagnosed with aspergers?  Doctors won&#39;t be any help because they<br/>
are inundated with the same.<br/>
<br/>
Aspergers has become a catch all for any kid that doesn&#39;t quite fit in<br/>
to the school mold.  Shouldn&#39;t we be really more concerned about the<br/>
school mold that is causing so much damage to our kids?  I say, trust<br/>
your instincts, the school experts don&#39;t know much about homeschooling<br/>
or unschooling and can only see ways of helping a kid like yours stretch<br/>
and mold to just kind of match the school mold enough to say, &quot;look see,<br/>
he fits and we did that!&quot;.  As if that&#39;s something to be proud of!?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-305070399">I volunteered in a special ed class of kids with Aspergers and Autism for one year several years ago.  There was a &#39;team of professionals&#39; working with these kids.  This was an award winning school district that had lots of money and highly paid professionals.  I won&#39;t go into specifics, but I will tell you that if school is no place for kids who are not &#39;diagnosed&#39; with some sort of disability, it is certainly no place for a child that is.  The treatment was inhumane. The kids were afraid, they were screamed at, they were shamed, they were made fun of by the kids not in the class.  After a year of this so called professional training, I did not see one child become better at anything in any way.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know about unschooling then and I had never looked into homeschooling but my gut told me that these kids should somehow be at home.  They needed to nurtured and loved and cared for, not trained like animals. Ultimately, isn&#39;t this why we all make the decision to keep our kids at home?<br/>
<br/>
If you really feel you might be missing something by not sending your son to school, go and check it out yourself.  Sit in on one of those &#39;special ed&#39; classes and see what he is missing, then you will know for sure if you are making the choice that most reflects your ideas about how your son should learn.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been working or volunteering with therapeutic horseback riding  <br/>
programs for seven years, often with kids diagnosed with Asperger&#39;s.   <br/>
One boy stands out in memory: the first time I met him, he was  <br/>
animatedly discussing black holes, the nature of time and the  <br/>
universe, and then gave a detailed history of Quidditch ;-)  He made  <br/>
Christmas cards for us, featuring a picture of himself taken at the  <br/>
program.  The first read:<br/>
<br/>
Seasons Greetings!<br/>
Dear horseback riding teachers:<br/>
I love your lessens because I love horses and I love you.  I really  <br/>
enjoy my time with you and the horses.  I think that you guys are the  <br/>
best friends a guy could ever have.  I believe you are the best  <br/>
teachers who taught me horseback riding.  I wish you a Merry Christmas.<br/>
Love, Danny<br/>
<br/>
The next year&#39;s broke my heart; it was clear a teacher had gotten to  <br/>
him :-P<br/>
<br/>
Dear (name of program),<br/>
I love riding the horses with you.  I loved going to the horse shows  <br/>
this year.  I will love riding horses all the time.<br/>
Have a Merry Christmas,<br/>
Love, Danny Pacho<br/>
<br/>
There was another boy who attended the same school as Danny, who&#39;d  <br/>
come on weekdays after school.  Often, he&#39;d be very upset by something  <br/>
that had happened that day, and not always because of the bullies  <br/>
Danny saved him from.  Most of the time, it was just school itself  <br/>
that broke him down.  We&#39;d try to make the lesson as fun and relaxing  <br/>
as possible, using positive feedback rather than corrections.  We  <br/>
realized riding might be the only break these kids got all week.<br/>

He isn&#39;t in our basement, but he is still living with us, and I couldn&#39;t be<br/>

But nothing like there would be if he was forced into a school system and<br/>
with &quot;professionals&quot;. We did a little exploration of &quot;professional&quot;<br/>

Freedom and support obviously helps all people live and learn as themselves<br/>

aren&#39;t seen so much when they are put in the box. Sometimes not at all.<br/>

statistics on &quot;autism spectrum&quot; conditions are being looked at in  <br/>
relation to vaccinations.  This isn&#39;t a good list for that  <br/>
discussion, but you could go and look up those articles pretty  <br/>
easily.  What is called &quot;Asperger&#39;s&quot; is widespread and school isn&#39;t  <br/>
going to and can&#39;t help it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen three boys who clearly would be (two were already) named  <br/>
&quot;Asperger&#39;s,&quot; who were unschooled and by the time they were teens  <br/>
they were WAY, way calm and good and better than they could possibly  <br/>
have been had they been in school, being told they were weird and  <br/>
being bullied.  They were able to figure out ways to deal with social  <br/>
situations, and ways to grow up strong and aware of their strengths  <br/>
and limitations.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Beth, my ds14 has mild Aspergers. Dh thought he should go to public<br/>
school - to get him into the &quot;real world&quot; and so he wouldn&#39;t be a<br/>
&quot;mummy&#39;s boy,&quot; the mental health supervisor recommended the same. He<br/>
had attended a Steiner school for his first few schooling years. <br/>
<br/>
My dd18 went to public school for her high-school years and was<br/>
shocked at how the kids treated each other, she was bullied alot too.<br/>
She was adamant that her brother shouldn&#39;t go to school as she<br/>
recognised similar aspie traits in a class-mate who was bullied<br/>
relentlessly. Did I really want this for my child? The school actually<br/>
contacted me about enrolling him & that they would supply a helper in<br/>
some of his classes (depending on their funding) <br/>
<br/>
I do want my son to be able to survive &quot;out there&quot; but I don&#39;t think<br/>
that school is a healthy environment for anyone, let alone a kid that<br/>
is a bit &quot;different.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At present I am home-schooling ds14, ds11 & dd7. Un-schooling with a<br/>
Steiner twist.<br/>
<br/>
Also just an &quot;aside&quot; - we went gluten-free a few years ago, this seems<br/>
to have helped ds, the main thing I noticed was far less aggression<br/>
(also my 2 dyslexic children &quot;woke up&quot; academically very noticably).<br/>

There are children and adults, though, whose parents were sure  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035110674">-=-you know your son. you know what he wants out of life (well, i&#39;m<br/>
assumming he&#39;s shared it with you;) but you know how to get him<br/>
there because you know &#39;him&#39;. not every child has the same path,<br/>
every child is different. they are not the same as the ps<br/>
wants/insist them to be. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing this to have been written by someone whose children are  <br/>
very young.  I could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
My children are 16, 19 and 21.  They don&#39;t know what they want out of  <br/>
life, except that they live richly and fully in the moment and they  <br/>
try to be kind (or at least amusing--they can word-play pretty rough  <br/>
with their friends).<br/>
<br/>
Marty has just committed to five years worth of payments on a jeep,  <br/>
and comprehensive insurance.  That&#39;s something he wanted, to be  <br/>
driving his own jeep.  It&#39;s not a life goal.  It&#39;s not the only car  <br/>
he&#39;ll ever have (unless he doesn&#39;t live to wear it out or sell it).<br/>
<br/>
Kirby works a job he loves, and is living in Austin, which he ever  <br/>
planned or &quot;wanted out of life,&quot; but surprise!  He&#39;s loving it.  He,  <br/>
his apartment-mate and another friend/co-worker are looking for a  <br/>
house to rent.  He has enough money saved to make the first and last  <br/>
month, deposit and hook ups all by himself, but there will be two  <br/>
other people to share.  That&#39;s not a place I got him.  It&#39;s not a  <br/>
place he tried to get.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My children to not  have ANY &quot;path.&quot;  So to discuss each having a  <br/>
path that they will share and that the parents will know how to guide  <br/>
them on doesn&#39;t fit with what I&#39;ve seen of unschooling at all.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has a boyfriend whose parents put him on a path.  He was  <br/>
to be a doctor.  Period.  No arguments.  His choices?  Doctor or  <br/>
failure.  He didn&#39;t want to be a doctor.  That&#39;s what paths will get  <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-you know what he wants out of life (well, i&#39;m assumming he&#39;s  <br/>
shared it with you;)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Marty used to want to be a policeman.  I helped him move toward that  <br/>
in small ways.  He changed his mind.  My husband is very relieved.   <br/>
It wasn&#39;t &quot;a path,&quot; it was a thought.  It was one of countless  <br/>
possible paths on which he walked for a while.<br/>

Don&#39;t post unless you want to.  Proofread all you want to.  Always  <br/>
consider whether what you write will help people understand  <br/>
unschooling better, or will be what you really want to say so that  <br/>
others here can help you understand unschooling better.<br/>

You were repeating platitudes.  There are things mothers say to other  <br/>
mothers, little recitations that make the other mothers feel good in  <br/>
that moment.   This list isn&#39;t one of those places, although there  <br/>
are MANY lists around for moms to commiserate and coo and soothe.   <br/>
&quot;Poor us.  Life&#39;s hard.  We know our children better than anyone,  <br/>
though.  What a good **Mom** you are!  Your children are so lucky...&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that this is true for all kids!  Even the ones who aren&#39;t on <br/>
the spectrum.  <br/>
<br/>
That is why, I don&#39;t like the label of apergers, not because I don&#39;t <br/>
think it doesn&#39;t exist, but because regardless of who a child is, or <br/>
what makes up their personality, they can thrive as a whole person when <br/>
they are allowed the freedom that unschooling offers.<br/>
<br/>
A teen boy that we know, spent his young years at home with his mom <br/>
unschooling.  He decided he wanted to go to school when he was about 9 <br/>
or 10.  He went and now regrets ever making that decision because he <br/>
can&#39;t come back home.  He lives with his dad now, also his choice, and <br/>
dad won&#39;t hear of it.  He&#39;s much more centered because of being home <br/>
longer when he was little, but he still doesn&#39;t get a lot of the social <br/>
nuances, and as a teen, it&#39;s a harsh world when you don&#39;t get that!<br/>
<br/>
I think when parents make decisions for their children, they often <br/>
forget to look at their children and take them into consideration.  <br/>
They do what they know and school is it.  This kid&#39;s dad isn&#39;t a bad <br/>
guy, he&#39;s not an unschooling dad by a longshot, but in general pretty <br/>
ok.  I don&#39;t think he even realizes how much his son suffers and the <br/>
power he has to change that, he just doesn&#39;t see outside of the school <br/>
box.  It&#39;s hard to watch a smart, nice kid get put through ringer and <br/>
see his needs dismissed so that he can take math and all those other <br/>
subjects that his dad thinks he has to know.</div>

I can&#39;t believe these comments. How can going to school help your son function in the real world? You are the one who lives with your son in &quot;the real world&quot; and I presume you are helping him to function in it to the best of his ability. <br/>
I also believe that a child&#39;s parents know their own child better than anybody else. They also love and care for their child better than anyone else. Who better to watch over their child as he/she learns how to live in their community. <br/>
Beth trust your own intincts. You know your child better than anyone. Enjoy each day you have together and don&#39;t worry too much about the future. The future will take care of itself.<br/>

No, but there is an assumption that those who advise are advising  <br/>
from a position of experience with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great for people to ask questions, but those who respond should  <br/>
qualify their statements if they&#39;re not &quot;known entities&quot; on the list.<br/>

Discussion for homeschooling fans of John Holt, whose books Learning  <br/>
All the Time, Never Too Late, and Teach your Own have made  <br/>
unschooling a sweet and viable option for thousands of families.<br/>
This is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not  <br/>
moderated in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to-play  <br/>
way.) It&#39;s an idea group and is intended to lean more toward pure  <br/>
unschooling than neutral, general homeschooling discussion�there are  <br/>
hundreds of general homeschooling discussions for newcomers. It&#39;s to  <br/>
focus more toward how people learn no matter where in the world they  <br/>
are, rather than on what&#39;s legal in any particular country or  <br/>
jurisdiction. If you have questions or complaints, write to  <br/>

are unschoolers so defensive?? one little misunderstanding...they<br/>
jump on you?? i thought unschooling was about being &#39;open-minded&#39;?<br/>
that&#39;s why i&#39;m &#39;leaning that way&#39;, so to speak. i just can&#39;t find<br/>
one friendly unschooler!-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible that you&#39;re writing more than you&#39;re reading?  Is it  <br/>
possible that the unschoolers really want to examine unschooling and  <br/>
not other ideas?  Other ideas are *everywhere.*  Unschooling  <br/>
discussions are rare, and if they become discussions about everything  <br/>
else, there will be no unschooling discussions.<br/>
<br/>
If unschoolers seem defensive, perhaps it&#39;s because they  have  <br/>
something worth defending.<br/>
<br/>
We are criticized and misunderstood by mainstream families just as  <br/>
all homeschoolers are.  Then we&#39;re criticized and misunderstood by  <br/>
other homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yet our children thrive and our families are often strengthened.  I  <br/>
don&#39;t want this unschooling discussion diluted.  It&#39;s too important.<br/>
<br/>
But defensive  unschoolers won&#39;t be defensive when no one is saying  <br/>
anything contrary to unschooling.  So if you go to a 7th or 8th  <br/>
unschooling discussion, try reading a lot and writing only a little,  <br/>
and when you write be upfront about your experience.<br/>

Thank you for using that term &quot;diluted.&quot;  It&#39;s what makes me frustrated<br/>
about lists that want to be all things to all people.  I joined this list<br/>
because I enjoy a rather focused discussion and thoughtful exploration of<br/>
the concept of unschooling, which I find to be very distinct in many ways<br/>
from homeschooling.  I&#39;m not angry when someone goes on and on about<br/>
something other than unschooling, but I do find myself wondering about what<br/>
else in their lives they lack focus in.  Critical?  Perhaps.  Unfriendly?<br/>
Nah.  You should hear all the thoughts I keep to myself!<br/>

to learn about it.  but i can&#39;t do it 100%.  if that&#39;s not <br/>

subject) was having the same experience as i was.  we don&#39;t have <br/>
anything against unschooling, we just all end up afraid to post/ask <br/>
questions. we were told this one was friendly.<br/>
sorry, i will be removing my name from the list.  i have no choice, i <br/>
CAN NOT unschool 100%,(at least where subjects are  concerned) i <br/>
thought that was enough.  i thought i would be supported/applauded <br/>
for at least taking it that far.  maybe a few years from now...i&#39;ll <br/>

-=-we were told this one was friendly.-=-<br/>
You&#39;ve declared this list unfriendly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-we don&#39;t have<br/>
anything against unschooling, we just all end up afraid to post/ask<br/>
questions.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You weren&#39;t asking questions.  You were giving advice.  And in light  <br/>
of the way unschooling works, it wasn&#39;t good advice.<br/>
<br/>
-=-i thought i would be supported/applauded -=-<br/>
<br/>
If what you want is support and applause, you&#39;ll be able to find a  <br/>
list (IF you manage not to insult them in your posts) that will coo  <br/>
and soothe you and tell you things like &quot;you know your child better  <br/>
than anyone!&quot; but they won&#39;t really be helping you further your  <br/>
understanding.  If you want to learn you need to read more and post  <br/>
less.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;ll go back to some points at the beginning of your post:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-i&#39;m sorry. not all of us &#39;can&#39; unschool-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are you apologizing or being snarky?  Can&#39;t tell.  Neither is good,  <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Of course not everyone can unschool.  Should we who have figured out  <br/>
how stop  unschooling because not everyone can?  Should we stop  <br/>
helping others freely because not everyone can?<br/>
<br/>
Most people don&#39;t even want to think about it.  No one here has any  <br/>
responsibility to moms a thousand miles away they haven&#39;t met.  Each  <br/>
person who shares here is giving a gift to anyone who comes by and  <br/>
wants to learn.  We&#39;re not trying to hurt anyone or make them  <br/>
unhappy.  We&#39;re giving them information with which they might be able  <br/>
to make their children and themselves happier.<br/>
<br/>
-=-this is all easier said then done. in my house there &#39;is&#39; no<br/>
choice.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
#1, how easy do you really think it is to write things like this  <br/>
daily for 12 years or more?<br/>
<br/>
#2, it&#39;s helpful and comforting to think you have no choice, but it&#39;s  <br/>
not true.<br/>
