<div id="ygrps-yiv-930385114">I felt I needed to respond to this whole discussion and explain some <br/>
things.  It has taken me all day to gather my thoughts together about <br/>
it since I was so upset about it all and feeling so condemned.  I can <br/>
certainly understand some of the responses due to the harshness of my <br/>
husbands&#39; question, but I need to explain.  First, I would like to <br/>
thank Sandra for being more wholistic on your replies and not so <br/>
personal.  I have been reading Sandra&#39;s and Ren&#39;s(and many others) <br/>
advice for 2-3 years now and have always admired and respected their <br/>
thoughts.  These sites are the only things that get me through <br/>
sometimes, and so thankyou everybody out there for all your help!  I <br/>
think it is one reason why this has been so painful for me to have <br/>
dealt with.  We have just been &quot;silent observers&quot; for so long, and <br/>
for our first advance onto the site to have been like this has been <br/>
hurtful.  Regarding the pets, the situation is this.... my daughter <br/>
loves reptiles and fish, and I also love critters, so we have <br/>
accumulated MANY turtles, lizards, frogs, mice, rats, toads, geckoes, <br/>
dragons, and she has numerous aquariums with crabs, saltwater fish <br/>
(which she has caught herself) etc. over this last year.  We are very <br/>
active in her interest, fixing habitats for breeding, being active in <br/>
the local herpetological society, field trips, etc, etc. (And yes, we <br/>
also do many, many other activities with groups, friends, etc) With <br/>
so many reptiles, we also have to have crickets....1 thousand a week, <br/>
and of course, part of that is they get loose in the house, the cats <br/>
eat them and puke, and they chirp constantly(which I love!, but my dh <br/>
doesn&#39;t).  I realize that she cannot possibly take care of all these <br/>
herself, and so I do a lot of the care.  She is very good about <br/>
caring for many of these, but my husband gets frustrated with the <br/>
amount of time it takes, we always wonder how much responsability she <br/>
should have with them (isn&#39;t that a normal concern?) and my husband <br/>
does NOT like the crickets AT ALL crawling around the house at times <br/>
(which I think is a normal dislike for many people).  OK, keep this <br/>
info. in mind while I explain the TV part. Until the last 2 + months, <br/>
the kids main TV was the Science channel, Animal Planet, Funniest <br/>
Videos, and of course we&#39;ve had our share of the classic cartoons.  <br/>
Oh, and we LOVE the Spirited Away movie!  The programs didn&#39;t seem to <br/>
interfere with other things going on.  We had dinners together, <br/>
(discussed over Sandra&#39;s thinking sticks), we do the family bed, and <br/>
would all cuddle up and read 1-2 hours before bedtime.  Suddenly, our <br/>
dd has an interest in the newer cartoons like Invader Zim,  The <br/>
adventures of Billy and Mandy, and Ed, Edd and Eddie.  These are a <br/>
bit different than Mickey Mouse, with name calling, puking up on each <br/>
other, and just some stuff that I wasn&#39;t used to.  I&#39;m not saying <br/>
they are good or bad, just different and take adjusting to!  Also, <br/>
they now want to watch them ALOT, and not come to dinner if they are <br/>
on, and we don&#39;t have time now for our bedtime reading.  I know your <br/>
suggestions on working around them, and taping them, etc. are good <br/>
ones, but this is a big adjustment for my husband and myself.  <br/>
Soooooo, my husband was at wits end when he posted that question, and <br/>
was frustrated with some of these things, and yes, it came out very <br/>
negative, and no, we would never have let an animal die for a <br/>
lesson.  The letting go of control is a hard lesson for us to learn, <br/>
and we need the support of this group, and I don&#39;t want to feel like <br/>
we are these horrible, bad people if we would ever want to make <br/>
another post.  We realize a lot of this is OUR problem, but please <br/>
don&#39;t tell me that we are the only ones making mistakes along this <br/>
huge adventure.  Yes, we love our kids and worry about them probably <br/>
too much. While I&#39;m at it, I would like some insight into something <br/>
else.  My dd has also found that she likes scary movies.  (Rated R <br/>
like ALiens, The Thing, and recently The Scream)  She has always <br/>
loved scary things since a little girl, but I need some thoughts on <br/>
letting her watch &quot;horror&quot; movies at this age (10).  I have never <br/>
been a horror film lover, so I don&#39;t know what they are all like, and <br/>
if they are OK.  I have read to let the kids watch what they want, <br/>
and they will decide if it is something they like, or will ask to <br/>
turn it off or leave. <br/>
   Anyways, thanks for listening.  I&#39;m sorry if we conjured up <br/>
thoughts in peoples&#39; minds of a horrible family with poor, unloved <br/>
children.                    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057645367">If she just discovered theses shows, then they are new to her and the<br/>
newness will wear off after some marathon watching, I&#39;ll bet.  And quicker<br/>
if you don&#39;t make a big deal out of it.  Just keep life interesting and do<br/>
fun things and don&#39;t obsess about the amount she watches.  It&#39;ll pass.<br/>
<br/>
As to the pets, I guess I just wouldn&#39;t get anymore than I was willing to<br/>
take care of.  We have a guinea pig, two cats, and two horses.  The kids<br/>
help with all of them but they are not required to.  I knew going into it<br/>
that the responsibility would fall on me, if the kids&#39; interest didn&#39;t hold<br/>
and I had no problem with that.  We got them to enrich our lives.  At this<br/>
point, however, I am tapped for time/energy taking care of our pets and I<br/>
would not be willing to take on more responsibility for pets at this time.<br/>
My kids are 8 and 10.  They are not asking for more at this time but if they<br/>
did, we would talk about the repercussions of having more pets then you have<br/>
time to care for and I am sure they would understand, even if they were<br/>
disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
That said, your dh is part of your family, and although he shouldn&#39;t have<br/>
the only say, his opinion should be taken into consideration in the amount<br/>
of pets he has to live with.  Is there some way you could store the crickets<br/>
in a garage or attic or some kind of sound proof box?  We lived in our<br/>
basement for a year and had crickets that got in somehow and they drove me<br/>
nuts.  They are so loud!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403369644">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I felt I needed to respond to this whole discussion and explain some <br/>
things.  It has taken me all day to gather my thoughts together about <br/>
it since I was so upset about it all and feeling so condemned. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the great things about posting and then being challenged by the<br/>
responses, is that it often forces us to improve our writing online by being<br/>
more accurate and specific, and away from shorthand. That process in itself<br/>
can lead us to examine our underlying assumptions and reach greater clarity<br/>
in our thinking also - indeed that is its greatest value.<br/>
<br/>
Just look at how much more information there is just about the pet situation<br/>
in this post compared to the original one. Suddenly we see the extensive<br/>
nature of the commitment, and get a much greater idea of the scale of your<br/>
dd&#39;s interest in animals and nature. We now start to understand also the<br/>
sense of loss that you may feeling with this move away by dd from a shared<br/>
interest to a more individual one. (There is a tv show on Disney about a<br/>
girl with similar naturalist interests, just btw, called &quot;Naturally Sadie&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if she is escaping into cartoons partly because she has<br/>
over-committed herself to her menagerie. This sense of the scale was fairly<br/>
important information. It might be time to start phasing back to a more<br/>
comfortably manageable number of critters.<br/>
<br/>
The other important information was about the newness of the cartoon<br/>
watching, and how it is a change in her life, a development - one could say<br/>
an expansion of her interests. Starting to investigate ideas and information<br/>
that are maybe a little beyond the &quot;parental comfort zone&quot; could be seen as<br/>
a sign of increasing maturity and independence, rather than looking at the<br/>
content of the tv programs as an indication of childishness. Our self-talk<br/>
and the words we choose to describe our children matter. We can make the<br/>
choice to use a positive label, or a compassionate one, rather than the<br/>
criticizing or detrimental expression.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; this is a big adjustment for my husband and myself.  <br/>
Soooooo, my husband was at wits end when he posted that question, and <br/>
was frustrated with some of these things, and yes, it came out very <br/>
negative,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One thing that seems to come through clearly when people are posting are<br/>
negative feelings such as frustrations, and negative attitudes such as<br/>
critical judgments. Sometimes people who are writing are not even aware of<br/>
the extent that negative predictive thinking or unkind (or even harsh)<br/>
evaluations of their kids are permeating their thought processes. <br/>
<br/>
By writing these events and problems down and then having some of the<br/>
apparent emotions and ideas behind them illuminated by the responders, we<br/>
have the opportunity to say to ourselves something like, &quot;Wow, I didn&#39;t<br/>
realize how strongly this was affecting me...I didn&#39;t get how much my tone<br/>
is impinging on my kids...I didn&#39;t realize what assumptions I was still<br/>
holding on to...I didn&#39;t understand what the ramifications of this<br/>
action/attitude of mine could be....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I find that the places where I am most defensive are those where I am most<br/>
in the wrong. The very sense of feeling attacked, and the desire to deny,<br/>
are the most useful clues for me that I should examine those actions or<br/>
attitudes. Of course remembering that in the heat of the moment is the<br/>
hardest part!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; but please don&#39;t tell me that we are the only ones making mistakes<br/>
along this huge adventure. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No one is likely to say that. I have never heard anyone say anything like<br/>
that. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I&#39;m sorry if we conjured up <br/>
thoughts in peoples&#39; minds of a horrible family with poor, unloved <br/>
children. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I didn&#39;t get that picture, although I was a bit worried about your pets<br/>
for a minute. I also had visions of you releasing a domesticated animal into<br/>
the wild which is a bad idea from several pov&#39;s, which I now see would not<br/>
be an accurate picture at all. I hate crickets en masse too - utterly<br/>
illogical paranoia about them getting in my ears and eating my brain. I<br/>
thought they could come freeze dried for reptiles - at least they would then<br/>
be silent.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to cross post something I wrote last week about tv content. For<br/>
all the folk who have read it already, please feel free to switch off now. <br/>
<br/>
Quote begins:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;It has been the most pronounced incidence of synchronicity that I have<br/>
yet noticed on the lists where there have been three mothers posting almost<br/>
the exact same sentiments on three Unschooling lists, specifically<br/>
expressing the same concerns about &quot;limiting to appropriate content&quot; with<br/>
children of varying ages, from 2 yo to 6 year olds, to a 10 yo, and a 14 yo.<br/>
<br/>
This is not really the forum for a lengthy dissertation into the discourses<br/>
of television comedy, or a dissection of the semiotics of the sitcom as a<br/>
depiction of the American family - as entertaining as I would personally<br/>
find writing such an essay.<br/>
<br/>
Nor is it necessarily as helpful to get into a lengthy &quot;I don&#39;t like show<br/>
X&quot;...&quot;Oh I like show X a lot&quot; debate - because tastes differ, definitions of<br/>
&quot;vulgar&quot; or funny differ, and it doesn&#39;t really get any further into the<br/>
principles behind the ideas of choice and learning.<br/>
<br/>
There seem to be two issues in reference to the content of tv programs or<br/>
movies. The first is the idea that the content, while not necessarily<br/>
objectionable in itself, is too &quot;mature&quot; for the children - either too scary<br/>
or too sexually explicit seem to the main concerns. <br/>
<br/>
In the first situation I have found, similarly to what others have reported,<br/>
that Jayn is very good at self-care if she starts to become scared of<br/>
images, sounds or characters&#39; behavior. She also seems to have developed her<br/>
own specific coping mechanisms for exploring the scary stuff including fast<br/>
forwarding, going away for a minute, desensitizing herself with repeated<br/>
gradual exposures, and role-playing games. I too have learnt the kind of<br/>
music or images that disturb her, and will warn her if a program seems<br/>
likely to be scary. <br/>
<br/>
In the case of sexually explicit - and people have different places where<br/>
they will become concerned - I have found, again similarly to what others<br/>
have reported, that Jayn has zero interest in the sexual or even mere<br/>
romantic antics of people on tv. She certainly is not seeking it out. If<br/>
something comes on in the course of changing channels or she walks into the<br/>
other room and something is on, she gets a kind of &quot;that looks stupid&quot;<br/>
expression and usually totally ignores it. At around 3, she used to enjoy<br/>
&quot;Sex and the City&quot; because she liked the pretty dresses and sparkles, and<br/>
would just go play with her dolls during any of the incomprehensible to her<br/>
sexual scenes. Now she just lumps adult themed shows of any kind (eg police<br/>
drama) together as &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;stupid garbage&quot; and asks for Disney channel.<br/>
It is only a matter of time before she starts expressing ideas and seeking<br/>
clarification (her version of asking questions) on the odd sexual scenes she<br/>
bumps into at times on tv.<br/>
<br/>
*** I will add that I believe that she will start seeking out or being<br/>
attracted to programs with sexual content (of any kind) at the appropriate<br/>
developmental time when her inner questioning arrives at that place - or to<br/>
put it conversely, she won&#39;t be interested until and unless she is &quot;ready&quot;<br/>
to receive that kind of information, coupled with the additional guidance<br/>
that I will be able to give her about the level of reality that she is<br/>
seeing. I try to see every new program as an opportunity for more<br/>
communication between us.<br/>
<br/>
The second issue of concern has to do with the &quot;family values&quot; and behavior<br/>
and relationships of characters in the shows. I have to agree that both the<br/>
characters and the situations in teen sitcoms and movies often depict values<br/>
that are in conflict with the ideas of Unschooling, including lousy<br/>
parenting, adults as adversarial and dumb simultaneously, and sibling<br/>
conflict portrayed as normal and acceptable. <br/>
<br/>
However whether these values are going to be genuinely internalized and<br/>
adopted by our children is another question. I personally doubt it, despite<br/>
the experimental forays into these less than charming behaviors our kids<br/>
sometimes engage in. I am seeing it for the first time - Jayn has started<br/>
calling me &quot;stupid head&quot; at odd times - from &quot;Lilo and Stitch&quot; (movie). I<br/>
have Trust that it will get old soon. I also endorse the idea of talking<br/>
over in a genuine way specific behaviors or ideas, rather than making a<br/>
negative assessment of the show your kid loves. (I come and blurt the latter<br/>
onto the lists instead of onto Jayn). ;)<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the fact that I doubt that any of us are remotely like any of<br/>
these detached, authoritarian or befuddled parents, the biggest, hugest,<br/>
most significant difference between our children and 100percent of the kids<br/>
portrayed on any of these shows is: they are all in mandatory school.<br/>
<br/>
These TV children&#39;s primary bonding relationships are shown as being with<br/>
their friends and age peers, and with few exceptions, the majority of their<br/>
time is spent in the school hallways, on school related projects, including<br/>
some really contrived nonsense, and conversing with each other about school<br/>
stuff or school people. Additionally, with the one exception of Ren Stevens<br/>
who likes it and is a butt of humor for that reason, they seem consider<br/>
school a necessary evil. <br/>
<br/>
I believe that these shows portray a heightened and exaggerated depiction of<br/>
what we Unschoolers would consider some of the very real negatives of school<br/>
as they apply to family life - the appropriation of almost all time with the<br/>
concomitant disintegration of close family relationships, the culture of<br/>
peer approval and cliques and personality labeling (&quot;jocks&quot;, &quot;geeks&quot;,<br/>
&quot;popular girls&quot;, etc), the separation and fostering of distrust and<br/>
disconnection between parents and children, the adult (parent or teacher) as<br/>
both incomprehensible and a killjoy even while they are &quot;humorously&quot;<br/>
infantile (esp. males), children as directly powerless in the face of school<br/>
or parental rules so resorting to underhand strategies (hi jinks ensue!<br/>
:P~~). <br/>
<br/>
The entertainment value of these shows to schooled children, who undoubtedly<br/>
recognize themselves to a much greater degree, is likely partly in that very<br/>
separation from the parents. The tv kids usually spend almost no time in<br/>
class of any kind - more wishful thinking for the schooled kids. It is<br/>
possible that these tv kids have more personal power and autonomy than the<br/>
real children - they certainly will do more outlandish stuff. The didactic<br/>
&quot;mother knows best in the end&quot; message of most of these shows, is a small<br/>
price to pay (I mean for the schooled child viewers) for getting to watch<br/>
people make really dumb choices (dumber than they might make irl) and follow<br/>
through the absurd results. I notice that &quot;grounding&quot; is the universal<br/>
punishment, applied even after the &quot;lesson&quot; has been learned. <br/>
<br/>
I suspect that most of our children have much less identification with the<br/>
characters. Maybe they watch this stuff with the same sense of disbelieving<br/>
astonishment that some of us apply to Jerry Springer, or with the same<br/>
curiosity as pausing to view a car wreck or collapsed building. It is the<br/>
very &quot;otherness&quot; of these families that makes them interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Jayn what she likes about &quot;That&#39;s So Raven&quot;, her current favorite. I<br/>
discovered that her attraction to the show comes from her enjoyment of<br/>
Raven&#39;s dress up as odd characters antics, and also she likes Raven&#39;s<br/>
regular clothing which is heavy on the sparkle, feathers and embroidery. We<br/>
record the programs, and sometimes if one of the other characters is the<br/>
featured story that day, she will ask me to skip over those scenes that do<br/>
not include Raven herself. In other words the actual narrative or internal<br/>
&quot;logic&quot; is irrelevant to Jayn&#39;s enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
In the past Jayn has included shows that I don&#39;t like (for values) in her<br/>
viewing schedule. Her interest has waned, not because I made any attempt to<br/>
limit, but because she received all she needed and her interests matured. We<br/>
had lots of conversations about specific moments that I disapproved of,<br/>
along the lines of other choices the characters could have made in those<br/>
moments.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike schooled kids, our children have the opportunity to continue to have<br/>
authentic relationships with us. We can continue to be the first and primary<br/>
values influence in their lives, as well as their strongest safety net,<br/>
regardless of what tv shows they like. I hope that it is our huge presence<br/>
in their lives, and willingness to really listen without a hidden agenda,<br/>
that will ultimately mitigate any of the experimental &quot;bad&quot; behavior that<br/>
they may try on. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

Too many pets is too many pets.   Fish and reptiles die.   Don&#39;t get more <br/>
since it&#39;s causing stress.   Tell her when she&#39;s grown and has her own place she <br/>
can go wild with the number of animals she keeps, but right now you don&#39;t have <br/>
the space and patience and these should live their lives out (or find better <br/>
homes for some of them) without being replaced or added to.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of bringing the crickets out to the animals, if you really have that <br/>
many crickets, can they   be in a cage big enough for you to put lizards in to <br/>
eat and then pull the lizards out?   Can you put the crickets into the <br/>
lizards&#39; tanks inside a rolled up paper (like a paper towel) that will open once you <br/>
set it down?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-839524351">Hello - I was wondering if you have ever seen the show on Animal <br/>
Planet called Animal Planet&#39;s Cops? My 7yo is currently interested <br/>
in it but I wanted to point out that an adult should be near when <br/>
watching because occasionally there is something horendous that <br/>
happens. Anyhow, they do a really GREAT job of explaining that <br/>
sometimes well meaning people who start out with just a few pets but <br/>
add more get to a point that they are overwhelmed and need help. So <br/>
perhaps that is what has happened in your family that the adding of <br/>
pets at first had the best intentions but as time with by it just <br/>
got out of hand. You could help explain this and perhaps you could <br/>
work on a solution together, perhaps adopt a few out to other homes? <br/>
   About CN I think that if it is newly found then perhaps they are <br/>
enjoying it and learning from it and I would suggest giving it more <br/>
time. But perhaps if they are watching a lot of reruns of shows they <br/>
have already seen then mabye they don&#39;t feel like they have anything <br/>
else better to do that is currently available. So perhaps you could <br/>
make other things to do more apparent? Or perhaps they have a cold <br/>
coming on and just need to rest (my son does this occasionally, is <br/>
usually glued to the TV for a day or 2 and I will wonder what is up <br/>
and then he will get a fever or vomit or sore throat for a day or so <br/>
and then descides to get on about doing other things.) That&#39;s all I <br/>
can think of for now. Definately keep talking with your kids and <br/>
keep trying to understand them and you will work this out - HTH - <br/>

them), just because they&#39;re gross to you doesn&#39;t mean they might not <br/>

perhaps your husband could step up on this one? My son watches Billy <br/>
& Mandy (YES - Grim!) and even though sometimes I think - Yuck! When <br/>
I talk to him about it he is getting something totally different <br/>
from the show than I am. When he first started watching the Eds I <br/>
wasn&#39;t sure about that one either but actually I&#39;ve kindof got the <br/>
ideas behind that one now and am more cool with it, of course he&#39;s <br/>
tired of it now and rarely watches it. I&#39;m probably a bigger fan of <br/>
Teen Titans & Puffy Ami-Yumi than my son is these days! I wanna be <br/>
Starfire for Halloween this year & perhaps my son will be Robin <br/>
again. Anyhow - my son is getting something from the shows, even if <br/>
I don&#39;t see it at first, and he&#39;s sorthing the information and <br/>
desciding wheter it is useful for him or not, he&#39;s not just blindly <br/>
absorbing the information he is thinking about it and when he&#39;s <br/>
tired of something I know I can trust him to change the channel, <br/>
turn it off, etc. But I do like to make sure that if there is other <br/>
stuff to do, like go for a walk with me, play a game, etc. that he <br/>
knows that is available also, but I&#39;m not so hung up on it anymore <br/>
if he watches TV for a couple of hours, but actually now that he has <br/>
free access to TV (for about 2 years now) it seems like he watches <br/>
it a lot less, although it does get left on as background noise <br/>
quite a bit but I see myself and my husband do that as well.  <br/>

<br/>
We&#39;re at the end of this right now.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, we went to see _The Brothers Grimm_. It was rated PG-13, I <br/>
think. Ben said that it had a warning---one he&#39;d never seen before: <br/>
Parents should really consider taking children to this one. I don&#39;t <br/>
know where he saw that, but it hit him as odd.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan understands movie/tv/game/ratings. He knows we don&#39;t forbid <br/>
anything, but some one rated them that way for a reason. Maybe not a <br/>
good reason! &lt;g&gt; But someone felt the need to rate it as such&such.<br/>
<br/>
The movis is funny and clever and silly and...scary. Ben and I took <br/>
Duncan and a friend. About half-way through, Duncan grabs Ben&#39;s hand <br/>
and they scoot out quickly. Dunc was frightened. I didn&#39;t realize, as I <br/>
was sitting on the other side of Ben. They stayed out for 5-7 minutes <br/>
maybe and then came back in. They missed the almost-attack of the wolf <br/>
on the girl. Probably a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
He was fine for the rest of the movie (in my lap &lt;g&gt;), but he&#39;s been <br/>
sleeping downstairs on the sofa since. Next week, Ben&#39;s out of town, so <br/>
I&#39;m guessing I&#39;ll have bed company! &lt;G&gt;(But that would have happened <br/>
anyway!)<br/>
<br/>
Now, he *knows* this is a movie. He *knows* it&#39;s fake, but it was still <br/>
frightening---just a little. He&#39;s seen plenty of &quot;R&quot; movies that were <br/>
much less damaging to him; now he wants to know why! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that he wishes he didn&#39;t go. He&#39;s glad he saw it, he says. But <br/>
he was very glad to be able to leave when he needed to---and Ben was <br/>
good to be willing to jump up at an interesting part.<br/>
<br/>
I know so many parents who would have refused to leave and demand that <br/>
the child watch it because the child asked to come. And then make fun <br/>
of him for being scared. Duncan trusts us to help filter---OR help <br/>
avoid---situations that make him uncomfortable. We didn&#39;t realize that <br/>
his would frighten him---he seems so tough most of the time! &lt;g&gt; But <br/>
I&#39;m glad he trusts us and felt OK asking for help when he was scared.!<br/>
