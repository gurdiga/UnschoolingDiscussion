<div id="ygrps-yiv-196415923">Greetings, All.<br/>
<br/>
Moving Day is upon us!  Instead of preparing the house and our stuff for it, we&#39;ve been nursing a couple of kids through a yucky illness and now my husband and I both have this terrible, achy, coughy, fevery, I-just-wanna-go-to-bed-and-die feeling.  And there you have my whine for the day.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t relish the idea of 10,123 unread messages in my inbox, so I&#39;m going to go off list tonight.  I&#39;ll see you when we get out from under the boxes!<br/>
<br/>
