going even before their children are born. Parents as teachers, which is <br/>
almost the same thing with a different name on it for the middle class. Then <br/>
there is head start to give disadvantaged children the leg up they need for <br/>
kindergarten. There is pre-kindergarten, again almost the same thing as <br/>
headstart, just a different name. And the old standby preschool is still an <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717616509">On the preschool topic,<br/>
<br/>
Our two oldest went to preschool, for two years each, and they LOVED it.  In<br/>
my opinion, if all schools were more like preschools, the world would be<br/>
much better off.<br/>
<br/>
Our youngest did not go, because he did not want to be separated from Mom<br/>
and Dad and Brothers, and lots of other family members, which was fine with<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Really, they went to private church preschools, and had so much fun, only<br/>
two mornings per week.  All they did is play, sing songs, listen to stories,<br/>
put on holiday performances, etc.  The boys both loved it.  They both went<br/>
to Kindegarten, and were not happy at all, which I am glad for.  Kindegarten<br/>
was all about sitting down, being quiet, listening, BORING for my boys.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I sent Lars to preschool, partly because he was was like an only, with much <br/>
older siblings, and partly because of their philosophy that kids learn <br/>
through play.  (I would have taken him out in a minute if he didn&#39;t like <br/>
it.)  I was also hoping he would make some friends that he would keep after <br/>
the others went to school, but that didn&#39;t really happen.  He&#39;s made most <br/>
of his friends through sports teams.<br/>

for information on the history of infant feeding and now Waldorf and racism! <br/>
Not that I know much about Waldorf. Could you elaborate please? This sounds <br/>
interesting to me.<br/>
