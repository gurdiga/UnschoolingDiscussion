<div id="ygrps-yiv-594015635">&lt;&lt; I&#39;m not<br/>
sure what you are trying to say!  I feel like there are more questions here<br/>
than conclusions.  Is that the point?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not Joyce,  but when a post has lots of philosophical questions, the best <br/>
thing anyone can do is stick them inside and let them gather answers!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling has a lot to do with belief, which makes it a philosophical issue <br/>
first, and a &quot;how to&quot; only secondarily.   If you read about someone else&#39;s <br/>
beliefs, it&#39;s just knowing what they think.  To cause that to be your OWN <br/>
belief, you have to work it in and among the ideas and theories and beliefs <br/>
and convictions you already have in operation.<br/>
<br/>
Like riding a bike (again--but a good analogy for actually DOING), watching <br/>
other people ride might be interesting, but you cannot learn to ride from <br/>
watching.  <br/>
<br/>
Reading what other people think about unschooling might be interesting, but <br/>
you cannot learn to unschool without doing it.  And much of the &quot;doing&quot; is <br/>
mental.<br/>

<br/>
Having sex might be another worthwhile analogy.  People who haven&#39;t done<br/>
it can talk and speculate about it a lot, but we probably wouldn&#39;t take<br/>
their contributions to the discussion very seriously.<br/>
<br/>
And, unlike bicycling, everyone does it a little differently.  We could<br/>
debate endlessly about the &quot;right&quot; way to do it &lt;g&gt; without ever<br/>
changing anybody&#39;s mind.<br/>
<br/>
(Hey, would that be more FUN than debating the right way to unschool?<br/>
Maybe.  But if that&#39;s what I wanna talk about, I know I know I need to<br/>
go find another list.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually . . . while you probably can&#39;t learn the basics by watching, my <br/>
son learns tons about mountain biking by watching his videos over and <br/>
over.  &lt;g&gt;  Of course he still has to get on the bike and *try* the stunts.<br/>
And then there&#39;s the zen concept of learning sports (and music) which <br/>
involves visualizing yourself doing whatever it is you want to get better at.<br/>
