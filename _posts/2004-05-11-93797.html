&lt;&lt; You build his enthusiasm by supporting what he is interested in.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As my kids are older, some of our joint movie-&quot;study&quot; involves one person <br/>
watching all the extras on a DVD and then only showing the other people the parts <br/>
they know that individual will like. Hard to explain, but we rented SWAT, and <br/>
I watched the deleted scenes and little featurettes (while playing neopets on <br/>
a computer next to the TV), and then told Marty which he would especially <br/>
like.  The boys will watch a movie, summarize it for me, and just show me the <br/>
scene or two that reminded them of my preferences or interests.   It&#39;s kind of <br/>
like a report, or like someone reading you a paragraph from a long article, or <br/>
like a personalized preview.<br/>
<br/>
We do a lot of &quot;connect the dots&quot; kind of things, moving from one movie to <br/>
another because of an actor or director or plot similarity or period or...   <br/>
<br/>
When Marty heard Colin Ferrell with an Irish accent, he thought it was a <br/>
really good job at faking one.  No, I explained, Marty had just heard him more <br/>
than once do a really good job faking an American accent.  So we moved on to <br/>
Secondhand Lions, impressed with Michael Caine&#39;s Texas accent, and enjoyed what he <br/>
said about having learned it (on some of the DVD extras) and today Holly and <br/>
I watched &quot;Noises Off&quot; in which Michael Caine does his own accent, but several <br/>
Americans are doing English accents (some of the time, and lapsing humorously <br/>
to their own accents sometimes:  John Ritter, Carol Burnett, Christopher <br/>
Reeve).   <br/>
<br/>
That has just come out on DVD this week.  BUMMER:  No extras.  Extra <br/>
languages (French) and subtitles, but not commentary.<br/>
