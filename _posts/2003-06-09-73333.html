    Well...I&#39;m not exactly the best example IMO. LOL! I know people will<br/>
come. ;-) I want to make sure I want to commit long term. We have a lot of<br/>
groups to choose from around here. One *very* good eclectic group. In my<br/>
part of town. I don&#39;t want to step on toes but I want something different.<br/>
I&#39;m frustrated in having the e-school talks and the &quot;but he won&#39;t write,<br/>
read or do math&quot; or of course the &quot;he won&#39;t do anything but play video<br/>
games/TV all day&quot; &quot;I know my child!&quot; crap.<br/>
<br/>
    It&#39;s really not quite that bad but still I want people that understand<br/>
better and support this lifestyle. I want to help people understand that we<br/>
all can learn in our home and community without the school baggage. I want<br/>
sugestions of, go to the park, go see something new, want to have a<br/>
playdate, see a movie? to be the first thing out of my mouth and that to be<br/>
expected, excepted, and valid from the majority of the group. Instead of me<br/>
feeling like I having to come up with a more schooly/excepted way or not<br/>
speak at all. Not be validated. ;-(<br/>
<br/>
    I have been tossing around names for the group. Learning in Freedom<br/>
Everyday/ Learners in Freedom Everywhere/ Learning in Family Environments<br/>
was an old group that closed/ Life Learners/ Learners for Life? I want<br/>
something that will tell people that this is an unschoolers group.<br/>
Unschoolers United, LOL! Let Freedom Reign!<br/>
(end rant)<br/>
<br/>
    <br/>
sounds like this should have went under Julies &quot;I want&quot; subect line. ;-)<br/>
Thanks for reading/listening.<br/>

&gt;&gt; apprehensive. Any sugestions?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And that&#39;s how SOS started (and the conference). I just thought we needed an<br/>
&gt; unschoolers&#39; group. If you start one, they will come---in droves!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And you started posting here after last year&#39;s conference. Happy to set you<br/>
&gt; up again, Barb! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is an odd bird that way.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier than to get up, get folks dressed, fed and at school by 7:05. <br/>
Volunteering at school for several hours. Picking up by 3:00 and working on <br/>
homework, doing projects, helping study for tests, fixing supper, and signing <br/>
papers for the next day. Planning vacations around well...vacations! All the stress <br/>
and worry and STUFF.<br/>
<br/>
But then folks think unschooling is easy. It&#39;s not. There&#39;s a lot of driving <br/>
and playing and doing and thinking (and, for me, conferencing---but that&#39;s <br/>
extra). We&#39;re VERY busy---and at the same time relaxed and laid back.<br/>
<br/>
In some ways, school is easier---ship &#39;em off and forget about them until <br/>
3:00 when you then yell about their getting things done. Hands OFF.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling = hands ON.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for folks to understand. It&#39;s an odd bird.<br/>

stories about Getting Started HS meetings. ;-)<br/>
    I can&#39;t beleive the lazy comment though. I just love the questions they<br/>
asxk. It really make life interesting.  Having them is school all day...well<br/>
