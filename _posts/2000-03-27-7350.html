&gt; this time in their lives, I can say that I do look forward to my kids being<br/>
&gt; able to do a little more for themselves, too.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  By the end of the day I often feel that I<br/>
&gt; have been putting fires out all day long.  It will be easier when the 6 yo<br/>
&gt; learns to read.  I&#39;m trying to treasure this short, precious time but I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; sooooo tired.    I know these years will be gone before I know it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids are 18, 16, 12 and 9. Believe me, it won&#39;t be too long before you&#39;ll be<br/>
wishing they asked for your involvement a bit more! There&#39;s no pleasing some<br/>
mothers &lt;g&gt; I can remember so clearly feeling the way you guys are now. And some<br/>
days my younger 2 are still more demanding than I would like - especially when<br/>
I&#39;m suffering from PMS or such-like! But although my older ones still talk to me,<br/>
still include me in their lives, I&#39;m ashamed to admit that in spite of having<br/>
spent all these years bringing them up to be independent - and succeeeding to a<br/>
large degree - some days I find I need to be needed! Ah well, even success has<br/>
its drawback :-)<br/>
