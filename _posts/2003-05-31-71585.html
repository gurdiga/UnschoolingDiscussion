December 1997:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mainstream America is counting on you to &#39;draw your sword&#39; and fight for <br/>
them. These people have precious little time and resources to battle misguided <br/>
Cinderella attitudes, the fringe propaganda of the homosexual coalition, the <br/>
feminists who preach that it is a divine duty for women to hate men, blacks who <br/>
raise a militant fist with one hand while they seek preference with the other, <br/>
New Age apologists for juvenile crime who see roving gangs as a means to only <br/>
the merchandising of violence as a form of entertainment for impressionable <br/>
minds, and gun bans as a means to only the Lord-knows- what. We have reached <br/>
that point in time when our social policy originates on Oprah. It&#39;s time to pull <br/>
the plug.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But on the other hand, I find my blood pressure rising when Clinton&#39;s <br/>
cultural shock troops participate in homosexual-rights fund-raisers but boycott <br/>
gun-rights fund-raisers... and then claim it&#39;s time to place homosexual men in <br/>
tents with Boy Scouts, and suggest that sperm donor babies born into lesbian <br/>
relationships are somehow better served and more loved. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s just say I find him icky.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t care for his acting and don&#39;t like the entire genre of movies <br/>
that he&#39;s best known for. Add to that his political stance and I find <br/>
him icky too.<br/>
<br/>
And no, I wouldn&#39;t do him either. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
