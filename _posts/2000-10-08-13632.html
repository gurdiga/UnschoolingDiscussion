&gt; I got a chuckle out of your email. I wanted to say that I am in the middle of<br/>
&gt; reading your book , it is really interesting how you managed to jump on your<br/>
&gt; childrens interests. I say this in &quot;AWE&quot; , because at the moment my daughter<br/>
&gt; seems to be a &quot;scatterbrain&quot; in that she picks up an interest and just when I<br/>
&gt; think I have the correct info. she changes directions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I stand in awe, too, simply for their being those wonderful pieces of star-stuff<br/>
gathered that they (and all children) truly are!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; . But really I am<br/>
&gt; enjoying your story of your girls. Thank You for such detailed info.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks! (let me know what you think when done.)<br/>
