&gt; All mine slept with me through most of their first year.  Made it so easy<br/>
&gt; with the nursing--never had to wake up. All those other mothers dragging<br/>
&gt; around, complaining. Not me! There was always another one on the heals (my<br/>
&gt; kids are 17 months apart), so they moved into their own room. My first and<br/>
&gt; third both wanted to sleep alone at that point--they would wake up crying.<br/>
&gt; I suspect it was dh&#39;s snoring. &lt;LOL&gt;  The middle one was the only one who<br/>
&gt; probably would still be sleeping with us, but she moved in with her older<br/>
&gt; sister. We got them bunk beds about 9 mos. ago, but they chose to both<br/>
&gt; sleep in the top together. Go figure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have an open bed policy, though, so we almost always have one of them<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the bed with us for some portion of the night.<br/>

<br/>
Our 15 year old has times when she drags her blankets and pillow and sleeps <br/>
in the floor beside me.  We talk or watch TV or sometimes she just wants to <br/>
know I&#39;m there, RIGHT there.  DH doesn&#39;t really &quot;get&quot; why this happens, but <br/>
thankfully he&#39;s come far enough into this &quot;venture&quot; as he calls it to just not say <br/>
anything and roll over and go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
She never really did this at all (well she did co sleep from an infant but <br/>
wanted her OWN room like the big kids around two I guess) but in the last year I <br/>
guess it&#39;s been happening.  Sometimes two or three nights in a row.  Then <br/>
maybe not for a month.<br/>
<br/>
A LOT around the death of her friend in August and following, when there are <br/>
reminders.  I&#39;m glad my children LIKE being close to me, even at 15, almost <br/>
16.  My mother was the very last place I would have looked to for comfort or <br/>
security.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We started co-sleeping when my oldest was a day old.  We brought him home and <br/>
he cried and cried in the bassinet so I decided to bring him in bed with us <br/>
so that we could all sleep better.  That was the day that dh and I decided that <br/>
we would always try our best to meet our children&#39;s needs and take their <br/>
needs seriously.  I believe that was what set us in the right frame of mind for <br/>
unschooling.  I believe that my oldest being a high need child was a gift.  If <br/>
it wasn&#39;t for him we may never have challenged the accepted &quot;normal&quot; child <br/>
raising beliefs of the general public, and may never have come to such a <br/>
respectful and joyful way of living.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway on co-sleeping, my boys 9 and 6 have always slept with us, we do have <br/>
a king size bed.  They haven&#39;t ever mentioned sleeping in their own beds.  We <br/>
love it that way.  We all sleep so peacefully.  I remember a couple of years <br/>
ago my oldest was saying that the mattress was bothering his back, that he <br/>
would wake up with a back ache so we went shopping for a new mattress.  Everyone <br/>
trying it out.  The store owner probably thought we were nuts but never said a <br/>
word.  I guess a sale is a sale.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318406779">I had a similar experience  and always said that I&#39;d not do the same to my children. If they needed me at night, they needed me. I wouldn&#39;t turn them away. <br/>
 <br/>
I know that many things I do as a parent are in part reactionary from the way I was brought up, but in many instances, I&#39;d have to say it&#39;s a really good thing! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402960163">We have never co-slept but we also would never consider not allowing <br/>
our kids in our room.  My 2yo has been in a lot lately which I have <br/>
no probelm with except no one wakes up happy.  It is amazing how <br/>
much room that little body takes up!  He tends to push me to the <br/>
edge and kick my dh.  However, he tends to come in when I am dead <br/>
asleep so by the time I realize he is there I am too tired to do <br/>
anything about it.  Once he is asleep, and if I have the energy I <br/>
will put him back in his bed.  My 5yo will come in occasionaly, <br/>
escpecially if he wakes up and finds his brother gone.  We just <br/>
bought one of those new airbed sleeping bags and leave it next to <br/>
the bed.  He comes in when he needs and plops and he is <br/>
comfortable.  I wish I had thought of it sooner.  I am going to try <br/>
and get the little one to use it more.<br/>
