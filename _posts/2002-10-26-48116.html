&gt;I caught the misspelling of &quot;mispelling&quot; too late. LOL.<br/>
&gt;But of course it should be &quot;misspelling&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh!  But I LOVE when &#39;misspelling&#39; is misspelled!  It&#39;s probably one of the <br/>
most misspelled words in our weirdo language!<br/>
<br/>
Well, I know what you mean, Karin, about the challenge of keeping up with <br/>
this list lately.  Some of these posts, lately, have been enough to curl my <br/>
hair!  But, unfortunately I have to let some of the posts go by unread <br/>
because I don&#39;t have the time to read the volumes of mail, be with Liam, <br/>
work, sleep, eat, and do all that other stuff I&#39;m supposed to be <br/>
doing.  Believe it or not, though, I keep them all in a folder in case I <br/>
want to refer back to something or look something up.  Are you sitting <br/>
down? (Of course you are; you&#39;re at your computer!)  There are more than <br/>
12,000 messages in that folder!  I&#39;m a virtual pack-rat! &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s fun talking!<br/>
<br/>
With love,<br/>
<br/>
Marji<br/>

You can just go to yahoogroups and read the archives.  (not as well organized <br/>
as your folders, maybe...)</div>
