<div id="ygrps-yiv-995583470">&lt;&lt;And of course I am interested in hearing other suggestions for materials <br/>
that might qualify as &quot;curriculum&quot; but are still creative and/or interesting <br/>
for kids.&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Usborne books. They are wonderful nonfiction books...on practically every subject. My little brother who hates reading loves these books. My children and I also love these books. Yes, I sell them...but just mostly to myself and my family. LOL They do have an online catalog... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ubah.com/cat_ubah/cat-search.asp.">http://www.ubah.com/cat_ubah/cat-search.asp.</a> If you want suggestions about books for different subjects and age groups or if you&#39;d like to see some of the books in person, I could help you find a consultant in your area...I&#39;d be happy to help. They do sell some of the books at book stores too. But they usually have a very limited selection. <br/>
