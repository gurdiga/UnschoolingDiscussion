<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173128310">&quot;THAT was an incredible sight...and how fortunate we were to be<br/>
right there to be able to witness it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wow! Very cool Anne.<br/>
<br/>
One morning when I was jogging up our street I heard a bunch of mockingbirds screeching loudly and looked up to see a hawk in the middle of the street with one of their babies under it&#39;s talons. I felt bad for all the mockingbirds, bravely trying to divebomb the attacker, but the hawk sat there nonplussed, and eventually flew up into a tree to eat his/her meal. It&#39;s amazing to see birds of prey in action.<br/>
The pelicans doing their fantastic dives into the ocean still amaze me! <br/>
