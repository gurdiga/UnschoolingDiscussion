<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230341545">If this announcement is appropriate for your unschooling site, do you have an <br/>
email loop and/or message board that this announcement could be sent to?  I’d <br/>
like to give as many homeschoolers as possible a chance to submit their <br/>
writing/artwork for publication.  I homeschooled our two boys and now live on the <br/>
coast of New Jersey with my husband in an empty nest! I have had an idea for a <br/>
book for years and am finally pulling it all together!  The book will be a <br/>
beautiful one; I have found nothing similar in my search of books already <br/>
published.  It will show everyone just how incredibly creative and talented our <br/>
homeschoolers are.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks very <br/>
much.  Kate Jennings<br/>
 <br/>
Announcement –<br/>
My name is Kate Jennings, and I homeschooled our two sons for eight years, <br/>
not  counting  the  years  from  birth  to  age  six!   I am compiling writings <br/>
by homeschoolers that will show the world just how talented we are!  I am <br/>
accepting (very) short stories, essays/paragraphs (creative or instructive), diary <br/>
entries, poems, letters to and from family or friends, etc.   Photos and <br/>
drawings that tie in with the writing would be great -- really, really great. The <br/>
book will be a showcase of the talents that homeschooled students possess.  <br/>
Anything written by students would be appropriate, whether it is descriptive, <br/>
instructive or creative.  Please keep in mind my plea for accompanying artwork <br/>
-- photos or sketches that relate to the written submission.  The presentation <br/>
of the writing in the book is very, very important to me, and accompanying <br/>
artwork is very important to the presentation!   One of my favorite submissions <br/>
is from a boy whose family built their own home.  A photo and a sketch were <br/>
included in the submission.  This entry will be most effective!  Please email me <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-576794782">my brain is fuzzy, but the lady in australia with the budding poet (the<br/>
invented spelling poem of the beste) you should see if your son wants to<br/>
enter that!  that was a really pretty poem.  homeschoolers would appreciate<br/>
it, but others might use it as &quot;proof&quot; that homeschooling is hazardous!  but<br/>
i&#39;m guessing that the book&#39;s audience will be homeschoolers, not the nea.<br/>
