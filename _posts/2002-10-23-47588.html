<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315653468">&lt;&lt;Any religion whose adherents HOPE that most of the rest of the humans<br/>
on <br/>
earth go to hell forever is not, IN MY OPINION, a religion worth<br/>
following.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yikes!  Do you think there are that many people who feel this way?  All<br/>
the years I spent around fundamentalist Christians I only met a handful<br/>
who seemed to LIKE the idea that people could suffer for eternity.<br/>
<br/>
Even Lanora said she doesn&#39;t understand why God would create ANYONE if He<br/>
knew even one of them would go to Hell.  I told her I&#39;ve thought the same<br/>
thing myself, many times.  I&#39;m not sure if I truly believe there is a<br/>
Hell anymore but I&#39;ve had many conversations with God on the issue.    I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t even wish Hell on someone like Hitler,  I would be THRILLED to<br/>
know it doesn&#39;t exist.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668849978">I have personally come across many people who like the idea of hell.  I think it is a way for them to<br/>
feel good about themselves because they don&#39;t want to think they are being good little citizens for <br/>
nothing.  Someone must punish those who sin, right?<br/>
<br/>
I also do not believe in hell and think it is something the church made up to scare people into attending.  <br/>
Besides, the real hell is being here and not having a connection with our creator (whomever this might be <br/>
for you).  And, although this will piss some people off, Hitler did go to heaven because that is the only <br/>
option.  All my opinion, of course.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366717186">Okay, life would be dull without any objection, so yes I will. I have no problem with the no hell concept, but I will have to go with reincarnation then, coz I just can&#39;t believe that someone totally evil could go to a good place. They will take all their evilness with them to the good place.<br/>

Reincarnation does make sense to me anyway, because my kids always seem as if they&#39;ve had experiences before this lifetime.<br/>

Well, we too believe in reincarnation. As far as Hitler going to heaven, I <br/>
guess what I mean, is that he&#39;d get to go there to think/feel about <br/>
everything he did before his reincarnation :) I think as <br/>
&quot;heaven/summerland&quot; as a place to go in-between lives :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-789748407">Well, that was a good try, but I also believe very much in reincarnation.  I guess my main point is that I do not believe in &quot;hell&quot; as most church goers do.  <br/>

I wonder who Hitler is now?  Wouldn&#39;t it be cool to find out who used to be Hitler.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612134930">There are many people that will believe in the same thing, but call it different religions.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the way I say it is................ my religion is my own connection with the universe.<br/>
Maybe slightly Pagan or New Age or just spiritual.  So hard to tell.  :-)<br/>

Not really, I just try to be the best person as I can. I just try to be as <br/>
comfortable with who I am at any given time as possible. But if one needs a <br/>
label, I guess you could call me a Neo-Pagan :) I tend to feel that I&#39;m <br/>
more on the spiritual side than the religion one. There&#39;s more about my <br/>
beliefs on my website at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://rambleman.tripod.com/OurPaganism.html">http://rambleman.tripod.com/OurPaganism.html</a><br/>
<br/>
That being said, I&#39;m not up for any discussions on my beliefs :) I don&#39;t <br/>
believe in proselytizing. Not that I think you would do that &lt;g&gt;, just <br/>
wanted to make sure everyone knew that up-front :-D<br/>
