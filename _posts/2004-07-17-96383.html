My mom sends money, and dh&#39;s mom always sends something made of vinyl or<br/>
that comes in vinyl packaging which has to go straight in the garage or my<br/>
throat closes up.  Not much of anything we get would be sentimental.  I<br/>
still have a ton of stuff from my own childhood, like my cloth doll<br/>
collection that I share with the kids a piece at a time.  My aunt has<br/>
recently started sending little things, but they are random as she is<br/>
thinking of the kids rather than for an event which is really nice in a<br/>
different way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-337401723">&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Grandparents SHOULD give gifts, imo. They, as a rule, have more <br/>
disposable  income and can give bigger and more practical gifts than the parents  <br/>
often can. Asking them to give NO gifts to their grandchildren is creepy.  <br/>
Asking *anyone* to give no gifts to children is creepy.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I do NOT like to be told that I SHOULD give a gift because of either my familial relationship or my financial (or perceived financial) status.  I give gifts because I WANT to, because I care for and love someone, and because I love the joy I receive in seeing the recipient&#39;s reaction.  If I want to give someone a gift and don&#39;t know what to get, then I ask.  Otherwise, I glean what I can from knowing the person, check to make sure he/she doesn&#39;t have duplicates, and pick something they would hopefully enjoy.  <br/>
<br/>
I know plenty of folks who are grandparents and cannot afford a box of crayons let alone a large/expensive gift. I believe it is a parents responsibility to model gracious acceptance of gifts - big or small - and to foster an attitude that does not expect gifts.  (what if someone can&#39;t give a gift... they feel horrible, and knowing it is expected can make it more of a burden)  Sometimes an unexpected gift is more precious than any &quot;should give&quot; gift (i.e.  a card with a sheet of stickers in it, a favorite candy you haven&#39;t had in a while, a plate of your favorite home-baked cookies).  <br/>
<br/>
Focusing on fostering relationships with family and friends instead seems more important than what one should/could/would receive as a gift , IMO, but that could be me.  I do believe that you can tactfully mention the child&#39;s interests and wants through your conversations with family, and when asked be blatantly open about the child&#39;s wants.  Also, I  just accept that some folks are going to send a gift that is totally out of touch with the recipient - i.e. Aunt Sue&#39;s hideous purple and orange polka dot sweaters every Christmas.  I smile and go on with life...  I know some of this may be hard for a child, but it can be good too.  I have learned a lot about folks by what they give, and have learned a deeper appreciation for who &quot;they&quot; are and how they are trying to share a bit of themselves with me.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945962518">Ali - I think that what that was about was about parents telling <br/>
grandparents NOT to give gifts - saying that it is in the nature of <br/>
grandparency to want to give gifts and that is how it should be - it is <br/>
normal and nice and wonderful and a parent shouldn&#39;t try to thwart it <br/>
just because the grandparents are spending too much money/giving too <br/>
many gifts.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, giving gifts to children is a great pleasure, as you pointed <br/>
out. And a wonderful grandparent/child relationship should include the <br/>
grandparents joyfully  giving gifts - assuming they can do that within <br/>
their means and at their discretion and the children graciously and <br/>
gratefully accepting them. Doesn&#39;t have to be purchased gifts, of <br/>
course. My mom had her grandchildren over for a &quot;cocoa party,&quot; one kid <br/>
at a time, on a regular basis. They&#39;d have cookies and cocoa on a tray <br/>
and the child would light a candle and they&#39;d have nice music playing. <br/>
And they&#39;d just eat, sip cocoa, and talk. That&#39;s it. But THAT is the <br/>
thing that all the grandchildren remember most about her. She also took <br/>
each of them on a BIG trip as they got old enough - Zac to Hawaii, Alex <br/>
to the Bahamas, Becky to Mexico, Roxana to London, Roya and Shelley <br/>
together to Mexico. Rosie and Joe were both too young when my mom died <br/>
and never got to take on an extended trip - but Rosie went with Grandma <br/>
on the train to San Diego for a one-night vacation.  The other kids had <br/>
all gotten that trip when they were younger, too.<br/>
<br/>
But - like I said - the BIG memory that stands out more than any other <br/>
- the cocoa parties.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978574908">Your cocoa parties remind me of my Grammy.<br/>
 <br/>
My favorite Grammy didn&#39;t have much money to speak of and she stretched her<br/>
budget tightly to give us each a five dollar gift at Christmas each year.  I<br/>
know my mom picked out the gifts because Grammy didn&#39;t drive.  I honestly<br/>
don&#39;t remember one thing she gave me.  What I remember about her is the time<br/>
she gave me.  She really listened to me and wanted to know me.  She also<br/>
made home-made cocoa with cocoa powder and sugar.  It was always served in a<br/>
Campbell&#39;s Soup Mug that she got free through the mail.  She loved to send<br/>
for freebies.  She read aloud to me. She spent time with me teaching me to<br/>
knit.  She had smarties in her candy dish and we could have a pack or maybe<br/>
two if we asked.  But mostly, she listened to me with an open heart and an<br/>
open mind.  She was not judgmental.  <br/>
 <br/>
On the other side of the family was Nana.  She gave more gifts but with<br/>
strings attached. (She&#39;d give a stuffed animal to us with instructions that<br/>
it wasn&#39;t to play with but to sit on your bed as a decoration, etc.  She had<br/>
favorites and gave them much better gifts.)  She never listened to me or<br/>
wanted to know more about me.  She seemed cold hearted and judgmental.  She<br/>
liked my dh when she first met him and he drove a candy apple red corvette.<br/>
She didn&#39;t like him so much when she found out he didn&#39;t have any money to<br/>
speak of.  <br/>
 <br/>
What it boils down to is the gifts don&#39;t really matter. It&#39;s what you give<br/>
from your heart that matters.<br/>
