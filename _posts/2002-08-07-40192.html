<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057355788">Yeah...Alice Cooper is great in concert - very theatrical-type performance.<br/>
I didn&#39;t know that kip winger played in his group until I saw it mentioned<br/>
today in that website I posted.<br/>
Funny thing is how Alice Cooper is such a regular guy when he&#39;s not<br/>
performing. He lives here in the Phoenix area (in Paradise Valley, I<br/>
think)...is a dad and has a long time marriage with his wife, likes to play<br/>
golf - of all things. He looks and acts like a normal guy. My dh is a huge<br/>
fan of Alice...<br/>
