<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064928366">While you and he are deschooling I recommend you also read Parent/Teen<br/>
Breakthrough by Mira Kirshenbaum and Charles Foster. Excellent book.  And<br/>
while your at it Learning and Forgeting by Frank Smith. Wishcraft by Barbara<br/>
Sher may spark something interesting. Your ds may like that one too along<br/>
with the Teenage Liberation Handbook. Sandras&#39; site is so eye openingly<br/>
wonderful. <br/>
    If this list gets to be too much then the message boards may be better.<br/>
Digest also helped me manage better too. I know this is a lot to start but<br/>
your son&#39;s well worth it. :-) Stick around lurk and think positively. It&#39;s a<br/>
wonderful life.&lt;G&gt;<br/>
