<div id="ygrps-yiv-745768270">Just have to share...<br/>
We have never &quot;studied&quot; days of the week or other calendar stuff, outside<br/>
of talking about it when it comes up in our normal activities.  I just<br/>
told my girls about something that will happen two weeks from today, and<br/>
my 5 year old asked, &quot;7 days plus 7 days?&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s always reassuring to see learning happening without me &quot;teaching&quot;!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-426347796">The Oxford English Dictionary says so, and it&#39;s a pretty authoritative<br/>
source for the language. Sunday for the sun, Monday for the moon, Tuesday<br/>
for some Teutonic deity associated with Mars (which is why it&#39;s Mardi in<br/>
French), Wednesday for Woden (who was for some reason associated with<br/>
Mercury, hence Mercredi), Thursday for Thor, Friday for a Norse goddess<br/>
associated with Venus (hence Vendredi), Saturday for Saturn.<br/>
<br/>
I first heard this years ago, but I never looked it up till now.<br/>

The Greeks named the days week after the sun, the moon and the five known<br/>
planets, which were in turn named after the gods Ares, Hermes, Zeus,<br/>
Aphrodite, and Cronus. The Greeks called the days of the week the Theon<br/>
hemerai &quot;days of the Gods&quot;. The Romans substituted their equivalent gods for<br/>
the Greek gods, Mars, Mercury, Jove (Jupiter), Venus, and Saturn. (The two<br/>
pantheons are very similar.) The Germanic peoples generally substituted<br/>
roughly similar gods for the Roman gods, Tiu (Twia), Woden, Thor, Freya<br/>
(Fria), but did not substitute Saturn.<br/>
<br/>
Why, I wonder, didn&#39;t they change Saturn? Maybe they didn&#39;t have a similar<br/>
god that played the same role?<br/>

<br/>
List of Norse gods, under the heading of : Sataere &lt;&lt;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~cherryne/list.html">http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~cherryne/list.html</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Some books list Sataere as a Germanic god of agriculture and suggest that <br/>
the name is another name for Loki. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Grimm in his Teutonic Mythology reasons that Saturn was originally a <br/>
Germanic deity &gt;&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Cool.  My money is on the Greeks/Romans borrowing from the Norse.  <br/>

I didn&#39;t learn it in school<br/>
I learned it playing with dictionaries and reading for fun about word origins.<br/>
