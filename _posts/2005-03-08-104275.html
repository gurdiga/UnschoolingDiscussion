SUBJECT: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] YES, how unschooling works  <br/>
<br/>
The last time I let someone else&#39;s judgemental words bother me, was when my  <br/>
niece began a heated discussion with me about how much my kids were missing <br/>
out  on by not being in school.  Right before I became really angry, it dawned  <br/>
on me that she was, indeed, a high school dropout because she chose to start <br/>
her  family at age 16.  When she dropped the comment, that the local school was <br/>
 really one of the best, I laughed wholeheartedly, and said, &quot;Well, it wasn&#39;t <br/>
so  good for you, now was it?&quot;  I have never heard another word from her or <br/>
the  rest of the family about why my kids don&#39;t seem to be doing anything all <br/>
day, or  how awful we are about not sending them to school.  One can just hold <br/>
a  conversation with my children, and find out more about the world, than the  <br/>
school even has time to teach.<br/>
