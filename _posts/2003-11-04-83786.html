YES.  In educational jargon, and sometimes, it is what I said.<br/>
<br/>
That it wasn&#39;t the case in the example here is fine and good.<br/>
<br/>
Mistake-making humans (we all are that) can choose to take part in an <br/>
exchange in which words and ideas are used, and they should defend what they say or <br/>
say &quot;didn&#39;t mean that&quot; and then go on with the real discussion.  <br/>

When I began homeschooling I was given a copy of the Curriculum Framework<br/>
(big heavy book about the educational outcomes which will be compulsory in<br/>
2004). I put it away and haven&#39;t looked at it till last week. By the time I<br/>
had waded through 4 sections I was almost thinking my kids should be in<br/>
school where they would receive the best education possible. My head hurt<br/>
from having to read each sentence twice and it seemed to me that it was<br/>
written to be deliberately confusing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have a visit/inspection on Monday from the district moderator<br/>
(eek!!!!!) and have used as much terminology as I can from the book. I think<br/>
mine is  better written cause at least you only have to read it once and it<br/>
doesn&#39;t cause headaches!!!!  &lt;g&gt; And if that sort of rubbish impresses them<br/>
then I figured it would be smart to use it.<br/>
<br/>
Someone gave the moderator a copy of the Unschooling Handbook a couple of<br/>
months ago so I am hoping he has read it and can see the benefits.<br/>
<br/>
Julie, trying to breathe.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941111227">Yesterday I let Frankie buy a little package of marbles from the dollar store.  They came home with them and found an old game board with pockets in it and started playing some kind of pool. I was happy I let him have them. He is 9 and he told me that 18 plua 18 is 40 so I corrected him and then he said that 14 plus 14 is 18 so I corrected him again and he argued with me LOL..... <br/>
<br/>
 We are now down to one tv because ds 18 has moved out into his own place.  It really shows too.  The kids are fighting over what to watch, calling each other names, etc. and even putting their hands on each other in a violent manner.  What can I do to help them stop this?  Other than saying lamely&quot; You can&#39;t do that to each other, or thats not allowed or they come to me and tell on each other and act like I&#39;m supposed to do something about it.  The older two girls are pretty much ok, except that the 10 dd and 9 ds are driving us crazy.  She is teasing him as much as she wants and he is getting angry and yelling alot.  I am covering my ears, telling him he is hurting my ears (got that from Ren, thank you) but I feel a little helpless here. <br/>
<br/>
 Dh took them in the backyard and had a bonfire for them but he came in and mentioned how much they were arguing and calling each other names, in other words He didn&#39;t enjoy himself... so maybe it would be along time before he did it again. <br/>
<br/>
 Our playstation went out with big brother too, so we have the computer games still and I hope to get them some type of game for Christmas, just the fighting really. How can I stop them from fighting with each other, they could drive all the other kids out of the house too?  dd14 is ready to move out LOL, she said the kids are driving her crazy... I want to help her.  She thinks they need a spanking, but of course I don&#39;t want to do that.  Just need some suggestions please.  Stepheny<br/>

------------<br/>
<br/>
You could buy another TV, used, or even new for less than $100 this month <br/>
(Christmas sales--we bought Marty a 21&quot; with remote control for $80).<br/>
<br/>
But making a schedule might help.  Let each child declare thething or two he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to miss, and make a listing.  Maybe you can record one on video <br/>
and watch another at the same time?  (Depends on your hookups.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-You can&#39;t do that to each other, or thats not allowed or they come to me <br/>
and tell on each other and act like I&#39;m supposed to do something about it.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
You ARE supposed to do something about it.<br/>
I hate it when parents &quot;leave children to work it out.&quot; It&#39;s cruel and lazy.<br/>
<br/>
But what you can do is help to prevent the frustration in the first place, <br/>
and model for them what to do in the face of frustration (which is NOT to leave <br/>
others to slap and scream).<br/>
<br/>
-=-  She is teasing him as much as she wants and he is getting angry and <br/>
yelling alot. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I would tell her this, in private, and close up: &quot;Stop it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If someone who didn&#39;t  live at my house came in and teased one of my children <br/>
past the point that it was any fun at all, I would tell them to stop it, and <br/>
if they didn&#39;t I would tell them to go home.  You can&#39;t tell someone who lives <br/>
there to go home, but you can say &quot;stop it,&quot; because part of parenting is <br/>
protecting each individual child from feeling unsafe in his own home.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend distractions, and finding special things to do with individual <br/>
kids (the most unhappy one would appreciate mom-time most).  Find natural <br/>
separations.  Take one or two of them to the grocery store with you.  Just half an <br/>
hour or something could help for hours.<br/>

  Natural separations.  Each child thinks that they go with me everywhere I go.  That means mom x 4.  Usually I don&#39;t mind this..... I would like to take only one or two with me.  Then I end up with children that ask me why they didn&#39;t get to go or they feel left out or whatever, and I understand their feelings.  So its hard to sneak out LOL but thats what it is starting to feel like.  So I can make out a schedule for each one to choose something to watch, have computer time, and also take turns to go with me places..... I can sit down and do this.  I want to be a fair mom, I feel pulled in too many directions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-197077254">(the most unhappy one would appreciate mom-time most).  <br/>
<br/>
  Trying to figure out the most unhappy one at the time. 14dd is a little sullen.  She is easy to make laugh.  She could be worried about her brother making such a big move in his life.  She is the most sensitive to others I think.<br/>
<br/>
  dd 13 is going through a little time of loving to say no to everyone, but makes sure she has computer time.  I have been letting them all stay on as long as they want to, she stays on pretty late.  <br/>
<br/>
  dd10 is not really reading yet.  She has asked for a leap pad because she thinks it will really help her with reading. She is still reversing alot of letters and I see alot of frustration she has over this.  When she is emailing someone I suggested she bring me a piece of paper and just tell me what she wants to type and I would write it for her.  I just bought both dd 10 and 13 some used roller blades and they are having fun with them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  ds just went in the bedroom to wake up the girls because he wanted something.  Like the boss he went in there and started using a very authoratative voice.  I called him and told them not to do that and solved his wanting problem.  Now he is ok.  I know I would hate being woke up like that. <br/>
<br/>
   They have been keeping late hours and waking up very late.  Some things I have to get done early, so if they want to go with me I either have to wake them up or leave them to sleep.....so it is 1:30 now and the only ones awake are me and ds 9<br/>
<br/>
  We are going to make pancakes now... he is hungry and can&#39;t wait one more minute &lt;S&gt;     Stepheny <br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a part of me that reads this and says, &quot;Yes!&quot;  It always sounded like <br/>
a cop-out when I was a kid, when I wanted to work it out but I didn&#39;t have <br/>
the skills to do so.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another part of me that remembers reading something in John Holt&#39;s <br/>
_Freedom and Beyond_ .  There are a couple of references to children arguing in <br/>
there -- one in which a sister and her little brother are trying to jump rope <br/>
together, but the brother is little enough that he can barely do it.  The <br/>
arguing is a negotiation between them -- the sister wants the boy as a playmate, <br/>
but wants to practice jumping rope as well.  The boy wants to play something <br/>
else, but it&#39;s more important to play with someone, and his sister is available <br/>
-- but only for this game.  They do both get what they want, but there is a <br/>
certain amount of frustration and arguing involved with it.  It works, but it&#39;s <br/>
not necessarily pretty to look at.<br/>
<br/>
Holt also says that he knows he overreacts to children&#39;s arguing and <br/>
fighting, feeling like he has to fix it when in fact that&#39;s how they are working <br/>
things out.  I know I let it bother me, too.  If someone&#39;s feelings and rights are <br/>
getting bulldozed, that&#39;s a clear time to step in -- but if two kids are <br/>
needing to negotiate, that might be different.  <br/>
<br/>
In general, I try to give Fisher the skills he needs to stand up for himself <br/>
-- using &quot;I&quot; messages, stating clearly what he wants or needs, using an <br/>
appropriate tone so that people feel respected in turn and will be more likely to <br/>
listen.  It&#39;s a lot of modelling and reflecting back to him (&quot;I hear that you <br/>
are angry . . . so you would like me to stop xyz? . . .&quot;), trying to show him <br/>
the appropriate words and such.<br/>
<br/>
My $.02.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469200475">&lt;&lt;I want to be a fiar mom but I feel pulled in too many directions&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hear you Stephany.  We have 5 kids and they all want to do everything.  It<br/>
can be overwhelming.  We did something that sounds horribly rigid but we<br/>
tend to use it flexibly and it worked well for us.<br/>
<br/>
There are 7 of us and 7 days of the week.  Each person gets 1 day a week<br/>
that is &#39;theirs&#39;.  On your day, you get to pick the blessing, you get to<br/>
watch the tv show without argument from others (like if 2 kids wanted to<br/>
watch different shows), you get to sit in the front seat, etc..  It helped<br/>
us move from the kids being overwhelming in their race  for &quot;their space&quot; in<br/>
the family.  The kids knew that &quot;their day&quot; was coming and it made life<br/>
easier all around.<br/>
<br/>
Now what is interesting is the kids sharing their days.  Example:  &quot;It&#39;s<br/>
Zach&#39;s day to pick the blessing.  What blessing would you like to say?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ll let Shelly pick&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Shelly says &quot;I&#39;ll let Adriane pick&quot;.  And on it goes around the table until<br/>
someone (usually one of the smaller kids) feels a need to be the &quot;special<br/>
day person&quot; and they pick.<br/>
<br/>
Something like that might help your kids move to more gentle way of dealing<br/>
with each other.<br/>

You mentioned having one day a week for each of you, where each child gets to say the blessing, pick the TV shows, etc. I really like that idea! There are only four children and the two of us, but I can see where it could work for us. I appreciate your sharing that with us!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229710888">Yes I know, Mine are not fighting in games to work things out.  They are fighting over who gets to control the remote while the show they are watching is on.  They are fighting over who gets to watch what.  I took the remote and put it on the table, and it is supposed to stay there while they watch a show, but if I leave the room they (one of them)picks it up.  I don&#39;t notice until a fight breaks out and voila! It doesn&#39;t leave time for much peace here.  Last night I put myself to bed because I was going to join in the arguing with them.  How silly!  I should be able to handle this, but dd 10 and ds 9 have had me close to tears lately. <br/>
<br/>
The idea about the special days is good, and the plan for what tv shows to watch when.  That will make them plan ahead.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been trying to help them with their words like you said Amy, I can see your angry etc... sometimes the older two said I sound stupid saying those things &lt;S&gt; I can take the criticism, I want to make sure I am not talking down to them either.  I have a tendency to holler, mostly when he is hollering to be heard over him.  He is a loud little boy and it seems to run in my side of the family...Thanks for the input.  Stepheny<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188177962">For seats in the car ... until this van, which has airbags so only one can<br/>
sit up front, we did &quot;COW&quot; ... child of the week.  That child got to pick<br/>
where they sat the whole week. We also had it where if you were the second,<br/>
you got to pick the second seat ... I don&#39;t remember how that worked ... if<br/>
it had just been your week or it was about to be your week, who was second.<br/>
With three kids, this worked pretty well. I still get &quot;I wish we still had<br/>

What is interesting ... just because it was their week, they didn&#39;t always<br/>

Holt also says that he knows he overreacts to children&#39;s arguing and <br/>
fighting, feeling like he has to fix it when in fact that&#39;s how they are <br/>
working <br/>
things out.  I know I let it bother me, too.  If someone&#39;s feelings and <br/>
rights are <br/>
getting bulldozed, that&#39;s a clear time to step in -- but if two kids are <br/>
needing to negotiate, that might be different.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, well Holt didn&#39;t have any kids.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re negotiating, then they&#39;re having a discussion.  If someone&#39;s being <br/>
totally cut to the core of their being or slapped around, that&#39;s not <br/>
negotiation.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s a lot of modelling and reflecting back to him (&quot;I hear that you <br/>
are angry . . . so you would like me to stop xyz? . . .&quot;)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depends how young the child is, I guess, and whether the parent can&#39;t just <br/>
talk to them like they would talk to other people.<br/>
<br/>
I would be less than thrilled if I had just expressed blatant frustration and <br/>
my husband put on the &quot;you little schnookums&quot; voice and said &quot;I hear that <br/>
you&#39;re frustrated...&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m glad.  i also just wanted to mention that the time of the year plays a<br/>
big part in everything as well.  The weather isn&#39;t as nice so the kids spend<br/>
more time inside.  The holidays are sooooo exciting but take so long to get<br/>
here.  Mom and dad are busier trying to get things done.<br/>
<br/>
I also have 2 very loud boys, so i know what you mean.  There are times when<br/>
they seem to reverberate in my head.  They are the ones that seem to have<br/>
the toughest time with being civil to others.  Perhaps it is a gender-linked<br/>
thing......somehow territorial?  I don&#39;t know.<br/>

&lt;&lt; They are fighting over who gets to control the remote while the show they <br/>
are watching is on.  They are fighting over who gets to watch what. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you have a &quot;whose show is it?&quot; situation the person who chose the show <br/>
could hold the remote maybe.<br/>
<br/>
About picking van seats, we had a rotation.  It was youngest up, so if Holly <br/>
chose last time, Marty chose next.  If Marty wasn&#39;t there it passed to Kirby, <br/>
and then back to Holly.   If only one was going with me, that didn&#39;t count in <br/>
the rotation.   If we couldn&#39;t remember whose turn it was, they did <br/>
scissors/paper/stone.<br/>
<br/>
Once years ago we were in a restaurant and Marty and Holly couldn&#39;t settle <br/>
easily on whose turn it was to go with Keith to the buffet.  Without even saying <br/>
a word they both started the scissors/paper/stone thing.  A younger couple <br/>
watching it commented. <br/>
<br/>
And once at the state fair, same two kids, both wanted daddy to carry them <br/>
and they chose that way.   I carried the other one.  My hip wasn&#39;t as good a <br/>
vantage point as daddy&#39;s shoulders.  I got the loser. But they knew there would <br/>
be lots of other good situations for them.<br/>
<br/>
My mom  used to buy all four kids the same gifts for Christmas.  Four of the <br/>
same things.  VERY boring and not a good use of funds, but to her it seemed <br/>
&quot;fair.&quot;  She counted and measured and it didn&#39;t make things &quot;fair,&quot; because some <br/>
kids needed more or different.<br/>
<br/>
From the time my kids were babies, I avoided that over-measured &quot;fair&quot;ness <br/>
and so they all are calm about one kid getting something when the others don&#39;t, <br/>
or one kid&#39;s Christmas being flashier than another&#39;s because they know for <br/>
sure it won&#39;t be the same kid every year. <br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago Marty and Holly said Kirby &quot;always&quot; gets the biggest, best <br/>
Christmas presents.    WHAT!?  I said.  Cannot be.  One year we got him a VCR.  <br/>
He already had one, so this way he could record all his shows AND ours, and he <br/>
could re-edit his collections of tapes.  He did that, for months, but when <br/>
the family one broke we took his away from him.  One year he got a desk chair <br/>
because he had had one scrounged from a dumpster, and it was all worn out.   (He <br/>
kept it.  What a ratty chair, but now he has two.)   One year he got a video <br/>
game and I had failed to get him the memory card or an adaptor it needed.  We <br/>
drove around and couldn&#39;t find any.  Very bad on my part and ever since I&#39;ve <br/>
gotten other teens to advise me on any tricky purchases.    <br/>
<br/>
But the idea that we would buy three chairs or three VCRs or whatever seems <br/>
crazy to me.  They&#39;re really good at sharing.   <br/>
<br/>
Oh.  Kirby&#39;s boom box gradually became public too. It&#39;s in my sewing room at <br/>
the moment.  But he bought himself an x-box and that plays CDs.<br/>
<br/>
This year Marty&#39;s getting the biggest/best (a TV and a Trogdor t-shirt, and a <br/>
few other less &quot;ooooh&quot; things).  Holly will have the greatest quantity, but <br/>
nothing so far has cost over $15 or so (the DVD of Chicago might&#39;ve been a bit <br/>
more).  Kirby, so far, season 2 of &quot;24&quot; (which he requested so it won&#39;t be a <br/>
surprise), a mouse pad, a t-shirt like one he wore out lately which he had from <br/>
the karate school of Bugs Bunny and Taz doing karate,  and a copy of Pirates <br/>
of the Caribbean on DVD.  Not a bad set of loot, but nothing really flashy and <br/>
everything but the t-shirt will end up being shared with others.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the others will begrudge Marty that TV.  Each of them has a <br/>
small but good TV.  Marty has had a big, heavy, messed up one that only gets a <br/>
few channels and those with a big line across the screen. <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s because none of them are needy are unhappy that they&#39;re fine <br/>
with not comparing numbers or prices or size, most of the time. <br/>

possible to use these skills and not sound like Mr. Rogers. (God rest his soul.)  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>and even putting their hands on each other in a violent manner.  What can I<br/>
do to help them stop this?  Other than saying lamely&quot; You can&#39;t do that to<br/>
each other, or thats not allowed or they come to me and tell on each other<br/>
and act like I&#39;m supposed to do something about it.  The older two girls are<br/>
pretty much ok, except that the 10 dd and 9 ds are driving us crazy.  She is<br/>
teasing him as much as she wants and he is getting angry and yelling alot.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I was looking  at a few of the  parenting sites that are linked at<br/>
Sandra&#39;s site . I came across this response to a parent&#39;s question about how<br/>
to help her boys to resolve conflict without violence.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Teach them to stop, think about their feelings, and use words to describe<br/>
them. You can make them sit on a sofa and not leave until they have<br/>
described their feelings to one another and come up with a solution<br/>
together. Instruct them quietly and firmly on this process and sit quietly<br/>
nearby until they have agreed on a solution. It will probably take repeated<br/>
times doing this to decrease the fighting. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has lots of great links to no spanking sites. I have printed off lots<br/>
of great stuff and posted it in my pantry (I go there to breathe. &lt;g&gt;) I am<br/>
slowly building up the skills I need to help them. It is a long, slow<br/>
process but keep at it!! You&#39;ll make it.<br/>

Being around them more helps.  They can&#39;t get in a knock-down drag-out fight <br/>
if someone&#39;s there before it gets bad.  So as soon as it looks like one is <br/>
bullying another, I start paying attention, and try to make a suggestion that <br/>
would help them get past their disagreement.  If a suggestion or two doesn&#39;t <br/>
help, or a reminder to the one I think is being too pushy (something like &quot;It is <br/>
Holly&#39;s game,&quot; or something), then I try to separate them in some natural <br/>
manner.  Not &quot;Marty, go to your room,&quot; but &quot;Marty, could you get a loaf of bread <br/>
out of the freezer?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Marty goes for a walk.  Gives him several moments to calm down.  He&#39;s gone, <br/>
and I can try to reason with Holly in his absence.  (&quot;Holly, if you want him to <br/>
play with you, you can&#39;t have your way about every single thing.  Can&#39;t you <br/>
just let him play the way he wants to?&quot;)   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe Marty&#39;s hungry, or is grouchy because someone was supposed to call him <br/>
and didn&#39;t, or isn&#39;t feeling well.  Maybe Holly is, same checklist.  Maybe <br/>
Holly&#39;s restless and needs to get out of the house.  Maybe we all need to go on <br/>
an errand.  Maybe I need to take Holly with me to the grocery store and let <br/>
Marty have the house to himself for a while.  Maybe I go upstairs and let Marty <br/>
tell me his side of the story, and remind him Holly&#39;s younger, and offer to <br/>
make him some food.<br/>
<br/>
All of us have the same goals.  We want to get along and not be hungry and <br/>
grouchy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

My two oldest kids worked it out themselves.  They traded after every time we <br/>
stopped and got out somewhere.  I can&#39;t remember if they just kept up with <br/>
who got to sit in front first in a day, or did something else to choose.  Back <br/>
then I wasn&#39;t an unschooler, and I told them that if they fought about it they <br/>
both had to sit in the back.  <br/>
<br/>
My youngest, who always gets to sit in the front because he&#39;s the only one <br/>
left, has to be reminded that it&#39;s polite to sit in the back when he has friends <br/>
in the car!<br/>

those skills heavily -- saying what I&#39;m hearing keeps me from losing my own <br/>
temper.  And when I was a kid, I wanted to be heard, badly.  Having adults laugh at <br/>
my anger or dismiss it or override it with their own was pretty crushing, so <br/>
I don&#39;t want to do the same with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
 Your response about staying with kids and giving them a natural separation <br/>
when things heated up, feeding them &lt;g&gt;, etc. was helpful to me as well.<br/>
<br/>

That&#39;s what Marty and Holly do nowadays.  It&#39;s usually only them, since Kirby <br/>
drives.   But  if it&#39;s Holly&#39;s errand and Marty&#39;s just along, she gets the <br/>
longest or first front-seat.  And if it&#39;s Marty&#39;s errand and he wants to keep <br/>
the front the whole time, Holly&#39;s okay with it.<br/>
<br/>
It helps a lot that they&#39;re in the double-digits of age. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
