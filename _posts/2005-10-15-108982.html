=======================================<br/>
<br/>
A major research institution has just announced the discovery of the heaviest <br/>
element yet known to science.  The new element has been named <br/>
&quot;Governmentium&quot;.  Governmentium has one neutron, 12 assistant neutrons, 75 deputy neutrons, <br/>
and 224 assistant deputy neutrons, giving it an Atomic mass of 311.<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
 These 311 particles are held together by forces called morons, which are <br/>
surrounded by vast quantities of lepton-like particles called peons.  Since <br/>
Governmentium has no electrons, it is inert.  However, it can be detected, as it <br/>
impedes every reaction with which it comes into contact. A minute amount of <br/>
Governmentium causes one reaction to take over 4 days to complete when it would <br/>
normally take less than a second.<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
 Governmentium has a normal half-life of 4 years; it does not decay but, <br/>
instead, undergoes a reorganization in which a portion of the Assistant neutrons <br/>
and deputy neutrons exchange places. In fact, Governmentium&#39;s mass will <br/>
actually increase over time, since each reorganization will cause more morons to <br/>
become neutrons, forming isodopes.<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
 This characteristic of moron-promotion leads some scientists to believe that <br/>
Governmentium is formed  whenever morons reach a certain quantity in <br/>
concentration. This hypothetical quantity is referred to as &quot;Critical Morass&quot;. When <br/>
catalyzed with money Governmentium becomes Administratium, an element which <br/>
radiates just as much energy, since it has 1/2 as many peons but twice as many <br/>
morons.<br/>
<br/>
======================<br/>

My friend Norman Rhee sent that to me.   We know each other from high school <br/>
and he sends me the best fun-stuff!!<br/>

I have books ready to sell, and I could add in a set of Thinking Sticks for <br/>
$6 without extra shipping.   With shipping, though, they&#39;re $7.50.<br/>
