&lt;&lt; I just went through a class at our church called Growing Kids God&#39;s<br/>
Way.  It was awesome! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
anyone looking into this class, please be aware there is heated controversy <br/>
about it.     if i were considering it, i would want to know that up front so <br/>
i could look into the concerns and check it out for myself.  <br/>
