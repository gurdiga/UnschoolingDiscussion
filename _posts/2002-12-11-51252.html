 </span></blockquote>I guess either of us could have went &quot;either way&quot; on this issue..  As well as <br/>
many other issues.  We ALWAYS learn from our parents.. We either learned what <br/>
worked, and remember what we loved ( and made us feel loved) and we pass that <br/>
on to our children,. Or, we learn what they did wrong, what we hated, and <br/>
made us feel awful , and we vow to not follow in thier footsteps.    <br/>
Sometimes, unfortunately, we learn the &quot;wrong ways&quot; and we continue the <br/>
legacy with our own children.   I hate that you have some bad memories, and <br/>
that you feel your needs were&#39;nt met by your parents,.. But, I am very glad <br/>
for you and your children that you didnt learned what NOT to do ..  I had <br/>
(have) the best Mother in the world.  My had (have) a wonderful father too.  <br/>
For all the good stuff my Daddy is, for all he taught me that was right and <br/>
valuable, I love him dearly.   I learned other lessons from him too, lessons <br/>
in what NOT to do.  Like be an alcoholic or marry one.     Many children of <br/>
alcoholics grow up to be alcoholics themselves, but neither my sisters ( or <br/>
their husband) nor I have ever had a drinking problem.. Heck, we really don&#39;t <br/>
even drink, just a very occasional social cocktail.   <br/>
<br/>
You know, the way Sandra has forged her own path in raising her children and <br/>
diverged from her past, and the fact that children of alcoholics have grown <br/>
up to NOT be drinkers,  is just more proof that we are not destined to turn <br/>
into our parents.   Although, I wish I could turn into my mother.. heck, I <br/>
turned out so good,  I know she was perfect :-)<br/>
