<div id="ygrps-yiv-376068537">I have a question about my 3 sons (ages 11, 10 and 8). They have unlimited time to play video games but I find that after they have been playing the games for a while when they do stop they start play fighting each other. Now they play fight each other a lot of the time but it seems to be a bit more aggressive as if they have extra energy after playing the games and my youngest son always seems to get hurt. Does anyone have ideas on how I can help them transition from playing the games to another activity that doesn&#39;t involve fighting?<br/>
<br/>
I also notice particularly in my 10 year old son that he complains of boredom when he gets off the game. I will suggest things for him to do like watching a show with me or playing a board game or going out for a walk but he says he doesn&#39;t feel like any of those things. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any advice.<br/>

<br/>
It will help to step away from &quot;doesn&#39;t involve fighting&quot; and look for ways to help them be safe while they roughhouse. One is to remind them to take more breaks and loosen up a bit as they play - or find a way for them to be a little active while playing, like a mini-trampoline, perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
Make a point of moving closer the longer they play. That&#39;s probably contrary to what you do, now - its really easy, once kids get settled in to playing, to drift away a bit because they don&#39;t really seem to need you for anything. It&#39;s the transition from one thing to another that&#39;s the trouble, though, so it&#39;s up to you to try to be more present for that transition. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, despite what I said about getting away from &quot;doesn&#39;t involve fighting&quot; you can offer a snack the moment they start to stir from the game. It&#39;s a good way to help them transition by giving them something to do right away that they probably need anyway. <br/>

<br/>
My 10yo sometimes complains of boredom when she transitions from one thing to another. It doesn&#39;t last long, and she doesn&#39;t really want ideas and finds them (and me) annoying when I offer some. It&#39;s more like she&#39;s feeling adrift - transitions are awkward things! So I&#39;ve learned not to offer suggestions, but instead find little ways to connect with her for a minute or two, so she can move on to whatever is next in her day. <br/>

<br/>
&quot;They&quot; are all playing together and then they all stop at the same time?<br/>
<br/>
If you had boys who were 11, 10 and 8 before video games were invented, they might be playing fast and rough ALL the time.  At least now they&#39;re sitting playing video games part of the time.<br/>
<br/>
If you had boys who were 11, 10 and 8 and they were in school, they probably would hardly be speaking to each other much, or being very mean to each other; especially to the youngest.<br/>
<br/>
So what are you comparing the situation to?  It can help a great deal to look at what alternative situations and circumstances might be, and to see what they&#39;re doing as normal.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I also notice particularly in my 10 year old son that he complains of boredom when he gets off the game. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This might help:<br/>

Another thing to consider is to ask him to clarify.  Is it a default whine made without thought?  Or is he asking for input or attention?  He might need some interaction with you--hug, joke, errand to do with or for you.  Praise.  Snack.<br/>
<br/>
But if you say &quot;What do you mean bored?  Can you rephrase what you&#39;re wanting?&quot; he might say something more useful.  Or he might notice he doesn&#39;t know what he wants, and he can&#39;t rephrase it.  When that happens, it can be that he&#39;s speaking a phrase without really thinking about it.  People do that sometimes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077418854">I wonder too whether sometimes a parent thinks they&#39;re being a &#39;good unschooler&#39; by setting up this paradigm of &#39;unlimited access&#39; to tv or electronic games, and even possibly stating quite overtly to the kids that they can watch/play as much as they want. And then that plays out to mean that the parent doesn&#39;t put in as much effort to create a wonderful nest with lots of variety. I hope I can be clear about this, as I am not advocating limits at all. My own kids watch/play all the tv/games they want, but I try to make sure I am with them pretty much the whole time. I read game instructions to them, talk about the show with them, and, when they&#39;ve lost interest and are ready to move on to the next thing, i am right there to help (if needed).<br/>
<br/>
So I am trying to differentiate between an organic sort of flow, where there are lots of activities on offer, and kids choose freely between them, and a situation where a parent is trying to follow some sort of self-imposed &#39;unschooling rule&#39;, and it ends up meaning that they are not present enough. Then the unlimited gaming or tv-watching is blamed when problems arise, rather than the lack of presence.<br/>
<br/>
It took me a while to find a balance between &#39;unlimited&#39; and &#39;active presence&#39;, but I can truly say that for some time now my kids (aged 4 and 6) have been very easily able to leave the tv or iPad to go and play an imaginative game with their soft toys, or paint a picture, or create a house for our guinea pigs, or meet friends at the park, or another of the many things they get up to in a day.<br/>

Maybe some people go from limits to &quot;no limits&quot; in a large swing to the extreme.  And so then for that parent the vision of &quot;no limits&quot; becomes the goal and the ideal, when it could or should have been part of their deschooling.  But I see the problem, because even as I write this some might be thinking &quot;OH, so the balance point is somewhere between limits and no limits.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Limits and &quot;no limits&quot; is not a good dichotomy to look at.  Life creates limits.  Reality and the requirements of living in the world limits some things.  If a parent says &quot;You can play all the video games you want to,&quot; what about pausing it to greet guests? To go to the bathroom?  Those things could seem &quot;coercive&quot; (to mix topics on this forum this week. :-)<br/>

From doing arbitrary things the parents decide, the next move might be thinking about answer kids&#39; question in more realistic ways in the moment.  &quot;Is it okay if I keep playing this game?&quot;  The answer shouldn&#39;t be &quot;Yes, of course, because we&#39;re unschoolers now.&quot;  It would make more sense to say &quot;Yes, until it&#39;s time to get ready to go to the movies,&quot; or &quot;Could you get ready to go to the movies first, and then play until we&#39;re ready to go?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or &quot;If the other kids don&#39;t want a turn, sure.&quot;  or  something else, depending on who&#39;s there and what&#39;s going on.  <br/>

Perhaps like they think the more games a kid plays the more imagined unschooling credit the mom can claim?   That the appearance of expansive &quot;freedom&quot; is as good as a life rich in a variety of cool options?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779275998">IN my experience with my son who loves to play video games is that :<br/>
<br/>
He does love to play fight and does with his friends and his sister. I used to have to be right there to help keep it safe but now he is able to keep it safe. I also noticed that his friend that is not allowed to play and does not have video games or TV is much more agressive and wants to play fight a lot. The difference is that MD pretends and this kid really goes for hurting ( behind the adults backs) so I have to be there and facilitate.<br/>
<br/>
When MD  stops playing and is restless it means that he needs connection and /or needs to do physical things because of pent up energy.<br/>
When he was younger we would run around the house, jump in bed ( I so want a trampoline!)  and do things like that.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds in the post the mom gives the child who says he is bored ideas. With my kids I join them. I don&#39;t just give ideas. I go do stuff with them. Many times all they need is the connection and doing things with you.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen kids come out from playing video games and go outside play just because I did let them know I was going and they joined me a while later and happily played with me.<br/>
Telling them what to do is not the same as doing with them.<br/>
<br/>
If the parent is under the impression that he/she is just going to sit there and give ideas and the kids are going to be happy with that I think that their lives are not going to be as fun and as interesting as when they have parents that joined them in exploring and playing.<br/>
 <br/>
I notice that parents who have or had kids in school are very detached , most of them, from their kids playing and exploring around. They expect their child to entertain themselves all the time. I see that my kids want me to be part of their lives fully. Not all the time or on everything, but present and participating. <br/>
<br/>
I am not a gamer, I do play some games and I like it but I am terrible at more complicated controllers like the X-box ones. But I know , from talking and reading, about all my son&#39;s games. He loves to come and talk to me about them. <br/>
<br/>
I just upgraded his computer memory  myself and he is so happy. I am getting really good at computer stuff just because I am always learning with him how to make his play better.<br/>
<br/>
Be more present, more involved, participate.  If kids are full of energy come up with a fun physical game and be part of it. There will be laughter and smiles and happy kids !<br/>
