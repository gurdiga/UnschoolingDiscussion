<br/>
I&#39;m not Sandra (and I won&#39;t apologize for it! &lt;g&gt;), but I do teach violin.<br/>
<br/>
Buy String Magazine; they show up on the rack at big bookstores, or you can<br/>
probably get a trial copy at www.stringsmagazine.com  They do lots of<br/>
articles on fiddling and fiddlers, along with other string related stuff.<br/>
Plus they&#39;re full of great ads for that sort of thing.  Strings also<br/>
publishes a Buyer&#39;s Guide (which used to be much better named a Resource<br/>
Guide) listing societies and violin shops by state and country.  You might<br/>
be able to acess that online, I&#39;m not sure.  Never tried, since mine lives<br/>
on my desk.<br/>
<br/>
Check with the nearest violin shop or folk-music type shop.  These are not<br/>
the kind of places that sell mainly electric pianos and guitars.  Look<br/>
around for a good one, because they can steer you in the direction of<br/>
teachers and other great resources.  If you want to email me off list and<br/>
tell me what state you&#39;re in and what towns are nearby, I&#39;ll look in my<br/>
Strings Buyer&#39;s Guide and see what I can find.  You really ought to be<br/>
drowning in folks out there in the Blue Ridge Mountains!<br/>
<br/>
Some of the books I use for fiddling are:<br/>
<br/>
Kidfiddle: 46 Easy Folk Songs for Fiddle with Chordal Accomp. (Mel Bay<br/>
Productions) -- very easy, which makes them a good play-through book to have<br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
Fiddlers Philharmonic Encore!: Traditional Fiddling in the String Orchestra<br/>
(Alfred) -- designed for school use, but fine for 1 person.  Includes the<br/>
solo line and then a 3 part version (tune, break, backup) for playing with<br/>
other people.  nice for playing with your teacher or a couple friends.<br/>
<br/>
The Scottish Folks Fiddle 3rd Position book (Taigh na teud: Harpstring House<br/>
Publishing, distributed by Music Sales Corporation) -- this one is really<br/>
nice, but not so easy to find; it&#39;s published on Isle of Skye, Scotland.<br/>
<br/>
Anthology of Fiddle Styles (Mel Bay) -- comprehensive, my personal favorite.<br/>
Even the cruddy music stores at the mall stock Mel Bay stuff, so it&#39;s easy<br/>
to find.<br/>
<br/>
The Renaissance Fiddler&#39;s Tune Book: A collection of 21 olde tunes composed<br/>
between the years 1100 and 1650 (homepublished by Deborah Greenblatt,<br/>
available from her or through Shar) -- not in your son&#39;s &quot;area&quot;, but a nice<br/>
collection.  Some are more Celtic, and all are easy enough to play.<br/>
<br/>
I get most of my music from Shar Products -- 1-800-248-SHAR, I think, or<br/>
look for their website.  They have piles of fiddle music, neatly sorted by<br/>
style, and most include enough description that you&#39;ll be able to figure out<br/>
whether it would be too hard or easy.<br/>
<br/>
I do get red flags in my mind about you son not wanting to play (NOT<br/>
practice! ugh!) his fiddle between lessons.  Even if he really likes his<br/>
current teacher (which may or may not be true -- ask pointed questions),<br/>
three teachers in 2 years can be tough.  Ask him if his new teacher is<br/>
asking him to change his position/posture/bow grip, etc.  Everyone plays a<br/>
little differently, but having to change a bunch of times to please<br/>
different people is a surefire way to make students hate playing.  If that&#39;s<br/>
the case, you might talk with the teacher and ask her if she could lay off<br/>
that stuff for a bit and work on &quot;developing his repertoire&quot; (as in,<br/>
learning more music so he has more stuff he can just play through and have<br/>
fun).  <br/>
<br/>
If he still wants to go to lessons and is asking you why it feels like a<br/>
chore, I&#39;m betting he hasn&#39;t changed his mind, but needs something different<br/>
than what he&#39;s getting.  At 10, and 2 years playing, he may not be old<br/>
enough to know what that is, or even articulate the problem very well.<br/>
<br/>
He has heard of Mark O&#39;Conner, right?  He&#39;s the biggest name in fiddling I<br/>
can come up with right now (it&#39;s getting late here in Germany and my brain<br/>
is fading).  Good stuff to listen to, that man can PLAY!<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if I can help you in any other way.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Dillon (10) aspires to be a Celtic/bluegrass fiddler.  He has been taking<br/>
&gt; &quot;violin&quot; lessons for about 2 years and doing pretty good.  We&#39;ve changed<br/>
&gt; teachers twice(the first time our choice, then that teacher stopped teaching<br/>
&gt; so the school assigned us a new teacher).  He never complains about going to<br/>
&gt; his lesson, but he never touches his fiddle outside of class anymore.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s the question.  Can you give me more info about the type of things Holly<br/>
&gt; practices?  What book is she using, what CD&#39;s are her &quot;required&quot; listening.<br/>
&gt; Dillon is never asked to listen to anything, but his teacher is Asian and<br/>
&gt; frankly doesn&#39;t know anything about roots music.  She is very good with Dillon<br/>
&gt; and is more than willing to teach his music that we bring to her.  Luckily his<br/>
&gt; dad loves roots music and Dillon listens daily to all sorts of fiddlers and<br/>
&gt; other musicians. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I  just talked to Dillon about his lessons the other day.  He says that he<br/>
&gt; wants to keep going to lessons although he feels that practicing is too much<br/>
&gt; like a chore (I remind him rather than force him).  I&#39;ve tried to find a<br/>
&gt; fiddler to teach him with no luck (although we live in the Blue Ridge Mtns).<br/>
&gt; Dad takes him to shows and introduces him to the musicians (Dad is a taper and<br/>
&gt; knows lots of them that way).  Dillon even asks me why I think fiddling feels<br/>
&gt; like a chore.  I&#39;ve asked him what he thinks, I&#39;ve offered ideas and<br/>
&gt; reinforced that learning to fiddle is his choice and I will do what I can to<br/>
&gt; make it work for him.  But that if he has tired of it or changed his mind it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; okay to stop.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any other ideas? </span></blockquote></div>
