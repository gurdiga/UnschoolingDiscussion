<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In Unschooling, what is the role of parents?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Facilitator. Chauffer. Sounding Board. Model (hopefully). Trusted Confidant.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In what ways are we to influence our children? At all?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Three ways:<br/>
1) By Example<br/>
2) By Example<br/>
3) By Example<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Are we all islands unto ourselves? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some days it seems so. Other days I am QUEEN! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Other days I&#39;m no more interesting than a dust speck.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How &#39;hands-off&#39; is &#39;hands-off&#39;?.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s a matter of *not interfering*. But if asked, I&#39;m on my mark.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;When does it become neglect?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When you have no idea what they&#39;ve done that day---and they won&#39;t tell you!  <br/>
And when you don&#39;t care. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s ANY such thing as a neglectful <br/>
UNschooler. That&#39;s oxymoronic. It&#39;s a partnership, this unschooling journey. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What is my responsibility?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To be the mom you wished you had. To help make their lives as joyful and <br/>
joy-filled as possible. To stand up for them when they can&#39;t. To support them <br/>
in pursuing their dreams (no matter how much YOU may be uninterested---try to <br/>
like it: you might be surprised! &lt;g&gt;). To treat them with the utmost <br/>
respect---after all they ARE the most interesting, fascinating, <br/>
respect-deserving people you&#39;ve ever met, right?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do I ever intervene/encourage/exhort? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe. Often. Rarely.<br/>

<br/>
They SAY they are, but we know they aren&#39;t because it isn&#39;t about just <br/>
stopping the curriculum. THAT&#39;s DEschooling---and a step in the right <br/>
direction. &lt;g&gt; But those are the same folks who ONLY see learning in <br/>
school-related activities. If that child writes in his journal daily and <br/>
writes short stories, THAT&#39;s writing. If he&#39;s IMing friends and writing <br/>
songs, he&#39;s wasting time. Playing chess is OK; playing a video game is <br/>
goofing off---and he *could* be doing something productive!.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about the philosophy again---the WHY (well----as well as the how).<br/>
<br/>
Giving up a curriculum does not an unschooler make. Understanding how <br/>
learning happens all the time and that children are natural <br/>
learners------it&#39;s the *understanding* that makes us unschoolers.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not sure thats what I would call &quot;neglect&quot;.  Burnout is the end to a bad idea and the time when minds open and explore new ideas.  Its in burn-out that people finally realize there might be a *better* way.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think they stop caring.  They just are in a transition and healing stage before they can embrace a new idea.  Sometimes they send their kids to school instead.  Sometimes they unschool.  Sometimes they adopt a different philosophy.  But I don&#39;t think anyone gives up and doesn&#39;t care anymore.  If they didn&#39;t care, they wouldn&#39;t burn out.<br/>

You know how people who work with kids always talk about how they <br/>
learned as much from the kids as the kids learned from them, it sounds <br/>
trite and hard to believe - but.....<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling means learning TOGETHER. You get to be who you are - you <br/>
aren&#39;t the &quot;expert&quot; in everything, not the &quot;teacher.&quot; No pretense. Just <br/>
being. It is incredibly healing to us parents.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Young humans are created to withstand incredible ineptness on the part <br/>
of their elders.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was from a book I read - I THINK it may have been Frank Smith, but <br/>
I&#39;m not sure. It is VERY comforting though, isn&#39;t it?<br/>

That was a helpful comment but my fears run even deeper.  It&#39;s not like<br/>
I worry that I am not smart enough ... I think I get enough about<br/>
unschooling to know that *what* I know or don&#39;t know about facts,<br/>
theories etc. is besides the point because I won&#39;t need to be teaching<br/>
it to my kids.  More I am worried that *who* I am is not a good enough<br/>
example of this kind of learning.  That ultimately I am too well-trained<br/>
by our larger culture and its measures and definitions of achievement,<br/>
productivity, creativity and success to be able to model the kind of<br/>
self-motivated activity that unschooling is supposed to foster in<br/>
children.  <br/>
<br/>
Does this make sense?<br/>

  Hi <br/>
  I think when I am afraid to post a concern or a question on this site that the problem is really mine. I think I am not clear on my own stand on the issue or somewhere deep inside me I don&#39;t truly agree with my choices. So then hearing other peoples disagreements become hard as they are echoing my own feelings that I don&#39;t know how to handle yet.<br/>

<br/>
If you have interests of your own, sewing, welding, rock climbing, <br/>
knitting with bowling balls (I really like that, that&#39;s what my knitting<br/>
looks like)  and you pursue your interests, your kids will see that and<br/>
know it&#39;s good and right for them to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have a passion right now (beyond your children&lt;g&gt;) explore! <br/>
 Plant a flower box.   Draw a cartoon, make pretzels!    Let your kids<br/>
know you&#39;ve never done it before and it&#39;s new and exciting and<br/>
intimidating to you.   They will know it&#39;s good to try new things.<br/>
<br/>
If you treat yourself and others kindly your kids will learn to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Modeling is really so important but so easy.   <br/>
I don&#39;t know if you have physical self esteem issues but if so just NOT<br/>
saying, as you look in the mirror with your child nearby, &quot;I&#39;m so pale<br/>
today.&quot; or &quot;look at these bags under my eyes&quot;.  or whatever.   If that&#39;s<br/>
what you model she will look at herself critically too.<br/>
If you look in the mirror and don&#39;t see anything you like just don&#39;t say<br/>
anything.   That&#39;s better than passing on the negative stuff.  (but it&#39;d<br/>
be really nice if you&#39;d smile at yourself and see a kind, warm mother)<br/>
<br/>
If you do things with your kids that you&#39;re not good at you&#39;ll still be<br/>
modeling a willingness to try.   Still be modeling a willingness to be<br/>
playful and together and happy.   That&#39;s HUGE!<br/>
<br/>
I had a stupid fear of spiders I learned from my mom and I modeled it to<br/>
my nephew.  He&#39;s thirty years old and afraid of spiders!    I decided not<br/>
to do that with my son and when we saw a spider (I still couldn&#39;t touch<br/>
it) we&#39;d crouch down beside it and look at it and talk about how<br/>
fascinating spiders are.    That spilled over to all creeping things and<br/>
he has a wonderful love of and interest in the natural world today.   And<br/>
I can pick up a spider and take it outside without doing the heebeejeebee<br/>
dance after.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can give us another example of something you&#39;re particularly<br/>
concerned about?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you unschool or send your child to public school you are always going to <br/>
be some kind of example for your child.  I think it is good for children to <br/>
see parents learn and change who they are and how they feel about themselves. <br/>
 It shows that you are not perfect and that you are willing to put in the <br/>
time and effort it takes to change.  Your children will respect you for that. <br/>
 They will see that it is possible to work out those kinds of problems.  They <br/>
will learn that if they are ever faced with challenges that seem <br/>
insurmountable there is a way.  They will see the resources you use.  You <br/>
will talk to your children about the journey.  They see you in a new light.<br/>
<br/>
To be a model of self motivation you need to find your passion or interest.  <br/>
And follow it.  Read about it, seek out people who do it, go places where <br/>
&quot;it&quot; is.  One of my passions is quilting.  My boys see me doing it.  They see <br/>
me researching and picking out fabrics.  They get involved.  They help me.  I <br/>
ask their advice. They see how excited I am when it all comes together.  They <br/>
see me donate quilts and we talk about why, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure I was much help but...<br/>

<br/>
Oh yea, Kelly, I finished the Drunkards Path quilt and a couple of funky tote <br/>
bags I made and will be sending them off, probably on Wednesday, I saved the <br/>
SOS address you sent along a while back, is that still OK?<br/>

<br/>
Does this make sense?**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Most of us are products of a pretty large behavior and<br/>
mind-control experiment called Public School.  The system exerted a lot<br/>
of pressure on your brain and it&#39;s not surprising if you feel squashed<br/>
or bent by the experience.<br/>
<br/>
A long &quot;deschooling&quot; time at the beginning of homeschooling is useful<br/>
for parents and children to recover from some of the stresses of being<br/>
in the school system.  Recognizing that it wasn&#39;t good for you, getting<br/>
rid of it and ridiculing it are part of the process for me.  You can<br/>
probably find lots of material written about deschooling if you search<br/>
for that word using the search feature on the unschooling.com message boards.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably easier to get over feeling that you were treated like an<br/>
object on an assembly line at school if you feel like your parents<br/>
treated you like a person.<br/>

Is some of your self-esteem lack the result of school?<br/>
<br/>
If not, I think therapy/counselling would help you help your kids.<br/>
<br/>
But if it WAS school, it will be super healing for you to just provide them <br/>
the safety from having to be in school!  You can all heal at once, if when <br/>
you see them shining and blosomming in the absence of weird social pressure, <br/>
bullying, confusion, grades, competition and shaming you think of yourself at <br/>
their age, and think &quot;I wish I could have had this, it would have been cool!&quot; <br/>
