<div id="ygrps-yiv-1495102111"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;ve found I do my best thinking while driving, long road trips<br/>
&gt; mostly, and I&#39;ve often wondered why that is. Maybe because out there<br/>
&gt; on the open road I&#39;m not tied down to thinking about what&#39;s for<br/>
&gt; dinner, or whether I remembered to move the clothes from the washer<br/>
&gt; to the dryer, or the fact that the bathroom could use a serious<br/>
&gt; cleaning, or whether I returned my sister&#39;s phone call, etc. etc. etc.<br/>

AHA!!!!!  Maybe that&#39;s why my thinking is more muddled these days (couldn&#39;t<br/>
be from sleepless nights and seemingly unattainable routines with four young<br/>
&#39;uns - LOL).    When I only had one and two children I worked part time.  I<br/>
travelled our local area....up to 2-1/2 hours for many one way trips.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t have - didn&#39;t *want* a radio in the car.  I LOVED that time!!  I<br/>
found it was wonderful for finding/centering/thinking-things-through.  I<br/>
quit working when dd#3 came along.....long drives are rare now.<br/>
<br/>
And I do know that this list has always given food for thought....helped me<br/>
clarify my thinking.  Sandra has been a big part of that.<br/>

Susan,  who has resorted to trying writing as a way to sort things out of<br/>
late....too bad I can&#39;t write and drive!<br/>

When we showed horses and I did lots of driving (35,000 on average a year<br/>
just to shows), I took along one of those voice activated tape recorders<br/>
that doctors use for dictation.<br/>
<br/>
I tried the clipboard on the dash but with 5 kids, 5 horses and 2 dogs plus<br/>
drivers that think a big truck and long horse trailer can stop in the same<br/>
space as a VW Bug, that proved to be just too dangerous &lt;g&gt;<br/>
