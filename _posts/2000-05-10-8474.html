<div><font size="2">that is a toughie!&nbsp; It&#39;s hard to counteract all the 
well-meaning stuff that comes from relatives, sometimes I wonder if my mum 
thinks my kids won&#39;t love her if she puts her foot down.&nbsp; But as long as 
you let your older child know what behaviour is acceptable and why, and keep the 
younger one as far as possible out of the &#39;fluence, I think that&#39;s as much as 
you can do.&nbsp; Letting the girls know what&#39;s acceptable to you and why can&#39;t 
hurt them, either.&nbsp; In the end you have to measure up how much of a problem 
it is directly to you, and work within that.&nbsp; Bets of luck!</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Okay, I need to put a new slant on the kid rant 
  thread.&nbsp; I agree that you<br>need to talk to a child who is at your house 
  a lot about rules of the house<br>&amp; explain to them how you expect them to 
  behave.<br><br>My problem is my husband&#39;s nieces.&nbsp; We go on vacation with 
  his family every<br>year for at least a week.&nbsp; Usually my in-laws pick 
  the nieces up &amp; bring<br>them for the whole week although their Dad (my 
  husband&#39;s brother) usually<br>only comes for a day or 
so.<br><br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
