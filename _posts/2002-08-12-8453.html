When I was 15 (or 16yo) My parents sent me to live with my Aunt in a<br/>
different state to attend school (my school at the time had a series of<br/>
beatings and rapes in the hallways during class time, truly terrifying!) My<br/>
Aunt contacted a family friend (lawyer) that drew up simple guardianship<br/>
papers so that my Aunt could enroll me in school, seek medical attention on<br/>
my behalf if neccessary, etc.  It was all very informal and easy.<br/>

No, wards of the state are a whole &#39;nother thing.<br/>
A family can assign temporary legal custody with a notarized form.  It&#39;s not<br/>
a big deal.   It happens for extended field trips with regularity.  They<br/>
state that you have the right to make decisions on the child&#39;s behalf and to<br/>
authorize medical treatment, and they sign it and have it notarized.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to deal with the state to keep someone else&#39;s child,<br/>
especially a relative.<br/>
