I used to get frequent headaches. Then I found out about feverfew. It doesn&#39;t treat a headache you have now (usually), you take some every day and it helps prevent them. It can take a few weeks to start working. You can take capsules or eat one leaf from a plant every day. It really helped me. After several months, I didn&#39;t need to take it any more. I only get occasional headaches now, usually traceable to allergies. Hope this helps.<br/>
