<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938484771"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">I find the post below very interesting. It kind of relates to a discussion 
<br>happening right now in my life with a book group. We have been reading the 
<br>book &quot;Women Without Superstition, No Gods, No Masters.&quot; It is the history of 
<br>freethinking women in the past two centuries. We have 15 women in this group 
<br>consisting of atheists, Catholics, Baptists, etc., and we have been able to 
<br>have a respectful discussion about our differences. It is so rare when women 
<br>can talk about such sensitive issues as religion and abortion, and still love 
<br>eachother. I don&#39;t post to this loop often, but I do read most messages. I 
<br>have found that this group resembles our book group. It has always seemed to 
<br>be open and accepting, and many controversial views have been shared but 
<br>respected. My question now is why can&#39;t we discuss abortion without people 
<br>getting all upset? In all the posts that I read, I never got the impression 
<br>that someone was attacking another person personally. I took it as someone&#39;s 
<br>opinion. IMO, many women tend to want to keep the peace all the time. I 
<br>actually used to be one of those women. I think unschooling changed me 
<br>somehow. Anyway, religion and abortion are sensitive issues, but they do 
<br>relate to my life, and I don&#39;t see the problem in discussing these issues 
<br>with other adult women. I certainly don&#39;t expect everyone on this list to 
<br>agree with my views, but we learn to appreciate others by listening to their 
<br>views. We learn that our views aren&#39;t necessarily the correct views for 
<br>everyone else out there. There have been many times while reading the digest 
<br>that I&#39;ve starting reading something, found it of little interest, skipped 
<br>the rest and moved on. The same can be done about the abortion or religion 
<br>issues if it makes someone uncomfortable. &nbsp;Now it is possible that all 
<br>discussions other than unschooling be &quot;officially&quot; banned from this list, but 
<br>we would lose so much, and someone would be very busy deleting messages. We 
<br>may not all agree with everything on this list, but I personally think that 
<br>it is healthy to have discussions where we don&#39;t all agree. I have actually 
<br>learned to be more accepting by listening to &nbsp;&nbsp;people with differing views. 
<br>Let&#39;s not be fearful of these subjects. Let&#39;s learn from them.

<br>&gt; to start a new email list for unschoolers on a more
<br>&gt; peaceful, less argumentative path.
<br>&gt; go to yahoo groups, check out unschoolkingdom.
<br>&gt; If political debates dont fuel your fire, come on
<br>&gt; over!
