<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162783179">Why even have him in Sunday School?<br/>
How about &quot;unchurching&quot;.<br/>
Maybe there is something to this.<br/>
We are believers.  We, too, have found that our children, ages 3 and 9, end <br/>
up learning how to be mean, talk back etc.. in Sunday School<br/>
My 9 yr. old son finally asked us, &quot;Do we have to go there anymore?&quot;<br/>
We asked him why he didn&#39;t want to.<br/>
He gave us all educated, wise reasons.<br/>
We learn about God/Jesus at home.  He knows a lot more, often times, than the <br/>
S.S. teacher about the indepthness of the Bible lesson at hand.<br/>
We decided we&#39;d discontinue Sunday School (and children&#39;s church, which <br/>
seemed to be Kool-aid and crazy time..._<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the idea that xtra activities are often playtime for school <br/>
kids.. let down time... They are wanting to have fun.  Our home &quot;learners&quot; <br/>
come along to actually be focused on the activity at hand... (Not to say the <br/>
others aren&#39;t.. you know what I mean, though.)<br/>
