&lt;&lt; But here&#39;s what originally came across as radical to me, but later fell <br/>
into<br/>
 place.  After you&#39;ve been giving your children control over their education,<br/>
 which is really control over how they spend their time, perhaps you&#39;ll start<br/>
 looking at the other places you exert control in their lives.  I grew from<br/>
 wanting to unschool with a math curriculum (not really possible to do, but I<br/>
 was trying!) to letting go of the whole curriculum idea, to letting go of<br/>
 restrictions on tv/video time, restrictions on foods, etc.  But it takes<br/>
 TIME to get there for a lot of us.  (And you may strongly defend some<br/>
 cherished ideas on the way.  I&#39;m still slightly chargrinned over some of my<br/>
 posts 8 or 9 months ago before I let go of more control areas!) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I can SO relate to this.<br/>
Someone (I think it was here) was laughing about some of the things I posted <br/>
in defense of controlling tv. Then she looked at the date...it was <br/>
pre-tv-paradigm shift!! LOL<br/>
I went through the same type of shifts that you did Brenda....letting go of <br/>
the math, then the food, then the tv and video games.....sigh.<br/>
Baby steps for some of us, but at least we can change for the better at any <br/>
time in our lives. We don&#39;t &quot;turn out&quot; at 18 like everyone had me convinced <br/>
when I was in school.<br/>
Thank goodness!!<br/>

&lt;&lt;  When our oldest son was little he always wanted more <br/>
 direction and interaction than any of the other kids. He&#39;d ask me to <br/>
 buy workbooks because he just loved filling in the blanks - <br/>
 especially math-related books - was he unschooling?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a five y.o. girl like this. She positively loves workbooks and <br/>
spending time doing &quot;school&quot;. She calls it this, which often bugs me....but <br/>
it&#39;s a way to keep her from actually going to school!!<br/>
She&#39;s reading simple words already and completely obsessed with decoding <br/>
words.<br/>
Her nine y.o. brother could care less.<br/>
So it&#39;s about trust, yes. And following the childs lead...not what it is we <br/>
are or aren&#39;t doing.<br/>
I prefer many other methods to workbooks, I find them boring, predictable (I <br/>
suppose that&#39;s what she likes) and not a true learning tool. More like a <br/>
review tool.<br/>
But she loves them and gets them out herself. So it wouldn&#39;t be unschooling <br/>
if I tried to stop her, she needs this type of activity for some reason and I <br/>
need to trust her to get from it what she wants.<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t mind at all. I love the workbooks, getting all the pencils lined <br/>
up, putting the little tabs in the divider pages.<br/>
Fortunately they aren&#39;t odd like me.<br/>

&lt;&lt; . It makes it difficult for someone with absolutely no<br/>
 experience, who in fact grew up in a very different way, to just jump<br/>
 right in. What a lot of the posters have really done for me though, is<br/>
 force me into answering a lot of my own questions. And that I appreciate. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, most of us had ZERO experience starting out on this journey too Wende. <br/>
Because most of us were raised in school without a whole lot of choices.<br/>
This list did for me what it did for you, made me answer my own questions.<br/>
It also made me critically examine what I thought was good and right. And you <br/>
know what? It came up wanting.<br/>
&quot;You have been weighed, you have been measured, and you have been found <br/>
wanting&quot; <br/>
lol<br/>
Thinking deeply about the why&#39;s is difficult and sometimes uncomfortable. But <br/>
it&#39;s the only way to break out of old mindsets that keep us stuck in the way <br/>
we were raised.<br/>
So keep asking and keep pondering, you seem good at that.<br/>
And try to remember that if the unschooling seems effortless, bubbly and <br/>
joyful for many people here, they can probably give you advice that will get <br/>
you to the same point.<br/>
Even if you initially think &quot;that just can&#39;t work&quot; it&#39;s good to read the <br/>
accounts of the advice givers life and ponder whether there is a piece of <br/>
somethine there that would help.<br/>
That&#39;s what kept getting me.<br/>
I would think that letting go of control just couldn&#39;t work, but here were <br/>
these people with real live kids and it was working beautifully.<br/>
Then the thought that MY kids were different came along...but then, there <br/>
were SO many people here saying it would work. And proving it by living an <br/>
incredibly interesting life.<br/>
So I finally had to really think about things on a different level and admit <br/>
I was brainwashed!!! sigh..... <br/>
It&#39;s not easy, but it&#39;s good.<br/>
