<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240350690">PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE trim ONLY the part of the post you are reffering to! I <br/>
am spending more time scrolling past three or four posts than I do reading <br/>
the new post.<br/>
Here&#39;s a tip; I&#39;ve noticed that some people trim a few lines and then respond <br/>
(Good!) but then following their post is the entire couple of messages. I <br/>
believe one can set their computer to  insert only highlighted text into a <br/>
response and not the whole email.<br/>
THanks so much!!<br/>

I think by &quot;trim&quot; she means &quot;quote.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Select the thing you want to respond to, mark it clearly with marks (not <br/>
indents or a different color, though you can use those too if you want),  then <br/>
write your comments.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever&#39;s left at the end, select and delete it.<br/>
<br/>
Different mailers do different things, and if yours automatically apends the <br/>
post to which you&#39;re referring, or if you&#39;re using the website and it does <br/>
that on the &quot;reply&quot; box, CHOP IT OFF.   Otherwise people on digest get things <br/>
over and over again, and it&#39;s too frustrating.  And people who get e-mail are <br/>
getting big e-mails they&#39;ve already read instead of cute little new things.<br/>
