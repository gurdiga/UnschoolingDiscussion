&lt;&lt; My middle daughter (Angie) went through this in March of this year. Angie <br/>
 decided that she should go back to school. The conversation went something <br/>
 like this:<br/>
 Angie:&quot;Mom, I am not learning anything!&quot;<br/>
 Me:&quot;Yes you are. You&#39;re learning all the time.&quot;<br/>
 Angie:&quot;No I&#39;m not. You don&#39;t teach us anything.&quot;<br/>
 Me:&quot;I am not the teacher. You can learn on your own.&quot;<br/>
 Angie:&quot;This is sick. You&#39;re gonna get caught.&quot;<br/>
 Me:&quot;Angie, I&#39;ve told you about unschooling.&quot;<br/>
 Angie:&quot;Yeah, mom, but we don&#39;t DO anything!!&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This conversation reminds me of the one I had with my son which led to us <br/>
staying home. <br/>
<br/>
Me:  &quot;You have been cranky for 3 days.  What&#39;s up?  Are you feeling sick or <br/>
is there a problem or what?&quot;  <br/>
Son:  &quot;Well, Mom, you know, they don&#39;t really teach me anything in school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He was 5 (now 6) so he hadn&#39;t had years to get used to the idea of how little <br/>
goes on in ps and I think that helped him cut to the chase.  We had several <br/>
very polite, promise-filled conversation with various school personnel after <br/>
that, then we left.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure school is evil but it sure isn&#39;t all it&#39;s cracked up to be.  8 <br/>
years of it -- that sounds like a lot to get over!<br/>
<br/>
Well, I think we better go outside now -- time to loaf -- it&#39;s OK, I can <br/>
loaf, I&#39;m a grown up -- they kids will have to play!<br/>
