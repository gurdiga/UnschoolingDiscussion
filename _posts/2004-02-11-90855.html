&lt;&lt; She hears them speak<br/>
German a lot. She&#39;s learned some vocabulary. That&#39;s it. Maybe she&#39;ll do more<br/>

And she could write a letter with her application saying &quot;I was homeschooled <br/>
and I didn&#39;t formally study a language, but I&#39;d like to study one once I get <br/>
to your fine university&quot; and they&#39;ll take her in without it.<br/>
