 </span></blockquote>~~~~~~~~~IMHO:  There&#39;s a part of us looking for approval from others when <br/>
we start a homeschooling discussion with people who are following the status <br/>
quo...  I&#39;ve learned only to share my excitement with like minded/open <br/>
minded friends (who won&#39;t feel intimidated).<br/>
This is one of the major reasons I LOVE THIS Forum!  I want to thank each <br/>
and every one of you for expressing your thoughts & experiences from <br/>
educating your kid(s).<br/>
