&gt; My kids have a whole cupboard in the playroom of stuff like that. All kinds<br/>
&gt; of paints, glitter, glues, felt, ribbon, yard, different kinds of scissors,<br/>
&gt; stencils, eyes, pom poms, pipe cleaners, beads, etc. We always have tons of<br/>
&gt; paper here too along with all kinds of crayons and markers. My kids very<br/>
&gt; rarely get into that stuff. I keep thinking maybe it&#39;s because of me not<br/>
&gt; being craft minded. They both love to draw a lot and even Tara still likes<br/>
&gt; coloring and doing collage type stuff with pictures and all. But none of<br/>
&gt; them do craft things alone. If I find something and present it, they&#39;ll do<br/>
&gt; it then. That&#39;s why I force myself to do so, I feel like they are missing<br/>
&gt; out because I&#39;m not naturally like that and they have never been exposed to<br/>
&gt; that kind of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You might ask them to decorate the house for the next holiday (our calendar<br/>
indicates that&#39;s Easter, 2 months away &lt;g&gt; but the girls started decorating<br/>
tonight).<br/>
<br/>
This accomplishes a couple things: it&#39;s a fun project and the beauty of it<br/>
is that as soon as Easter&#39;s over, they can start on the next one if they<br/>
want; it helps in the Personal Growth of people like us, Mary, who<br/>
eventually DO learn to control the facial tick that quickly develops when<br/>
EVERYTHING is covered with taped-on paper easter eggs and paintings.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters also make lots of pictures and craft things (for holidays or<br/>
presents or just for fun) for friends and relatives, which I dutifully put<br/>
in the mail or we all deliver depending on schedules and distance concerns.<br/>

Yeah the kids always help decorate around here. We do all the holidays, some <br/>
much bigger than others. Christmas, Halloween and Easter are big but we also <br/>
do Valentines Day and even St. Patricks Day when no one around here is even <br/>
remotely Irish! I have all the green stuff sitting on my love seat in my <br/>
bedroom just waiting. We even decorate for birthdays around here. They color <br/>
and draw a lot and we always put the pictures up all around the house, <br/>
mostly in the playroom. The kids just don&#39;t have a clue about actually <br/>
making stuff without some ideas first. Maybe it&#39;s inherited.<br/>
