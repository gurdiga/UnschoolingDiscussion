<div id="ygrps-yiv-550136274">&lt;&lt;striving to make your children &quot;the best&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that it is necessarily fair to blame the mom because the kids<br/>
have very active lives.  I have 5 children under 12.  None are asked or<br/>
required to do any type of activity they don&#39;t want to do.  None are<br/>
required to &quot;finish&quot; an activity they no longer want to participate in.<br/>
<br/>
My kids love activities.  Adriane, 11, takes karate (from me) 4 hours per<br/>
week (not counting belt tests and tournaments)with a certain understanding<br/>
that it won&#39;t hurt my feelings if she doesn&#39;t want to participate anymore.<br/>
She also attends a Cardio-kickboxing class I teach 2 hours a week.  Her big<br/>
thing is gymnastics and has classes 5 hours a week.  She is in 4-H, raising<br/>
rabbits and goats for stock shows, and just joined a sewing project.  Just<br/>
based on the above, Adriane spends almost 20 hours per week on &quot;activities&quot;.<br/>
She thrives on it.  Everytime she advances a level or wants to add a new<br/>
activity, we talk at length about the time requirements, does she really<br/>
want to do it, does she want to give something else up, etc..  She is living<br/>
her life as she chooses.<br/>
<br/>
I hate to think that people might judge me to be a &quot;bad&quot; mother, or to be<br/>
living vicariously through her, simply because Adriane is supported in her<br/>
own freely chosen interests.<br/>

&gt; have very active lives.  I have 5 children under 12.  None are asked or<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I completely agree that it&#39;s not fair to blame the mom because the kids have<br/>
active lives.  I was referring to moms who enroll their children in many<br/>
activities.....beginning at young ages,  when the child wouldn&#39;t have the<br/>
reasoning ability to determine what a time commitment means,  or to &#39;freely&#39;<br/>
choose that activity.<br/>
    People have various &#39;energy levels&#39; for organized activities.  And<br/>
parents have varioous energy levels and abilities to &#39;taxi&#39; to organized<br/>
activities.  Sound like you allow your children to lead in this area.....and<br/>
that you are a high energy/activity person yourself...I think it&#39;s wonderful<br/>
that you offer classes yourself!<br/>
    There are,  however,  many moms out there who believe their &#39;job&#39; as a<br/>
mom is to enable their children to out-perform others....like it&#39;s some sort<br/>
of competition to accomplish.  And moms whose ego depends on believing they<br/>
provided their children every opportunity to &quot;succeed&quot; (as in,  be the<br/>
&#39;best&#39; at activity x,y and or z.<br/>
    I know plenty of moms who see it as their responsibility to enroll<br/>
children in as much as possible... to &#39;help&#39; them find a talent or area in<br/>
which to be the &#39;best&#39;.  Many of these moms do this to meet their own ego<br/>
needs and expectations of what they see as being the &#39;best&#39; mom....as if<br/>
it&#39;s some type of competition to *out-mom* other moms.<br/>
    These type moms rarely actually listen to their children...and I think<br/>
they don&#39;t want actual responsibility if the child fails to meet their<br/>
expectations....after all,  they&#39;d have provided countless opportunities.<br/>
Most of the families I&#39;m referring to would not consider allowing their<br/>
children to drop school from the list of &#39;activities in which the child is<br/>
expected to *perform* for others expectations.  These children often have<br/>
very little time to simply *be*,  simply hang out,  simply build<br/>
relationships,  simply discover themselves and the world around them.<br/>
    And one of the reasons I do NOT want my children in the school system is<br/>
because I believe it would impose on the activities in which they do choose<br/>
to participate.  Or impose on the time they get to freely explore the world<br/>
and themselves in it.<br/>
    Your dd is in structured activities about 20 hrs/week,  you mentioned.<br/>
If she sleeps 10 hours a night,  she still has 78 hours a week to &#39;play<br/>
with&#39; - a much different child from the one(s) mentioned in the original<br/>
post,  who attended school and had &#39;activities&#39;  every evening.  They are<br/>
gone from their home maybe 14 hrs/day it sounded like ( at least on<br/>
weekdays).....If they do nothing on weekends and given the same 10 hrs of<br/>
sleep (which I somehow doubt they get......must do homework,  dontchaknow,<br/>
and watch TV some)...they&#39;d have only 28 hrs a week of unplanned/structured<br/>
activity time...That&#39;s if they do &quot;nothing&quot; on weekends.    Big diff......<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Susan**<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Weekends are filled for the kids in my example.  The son is in the <br/>
same Sat. soccer league as my son, and she told me they do Sundays <br/>
too, in another league 1/2 hour away.<br/>
I don&#39;t think this woman is a bad mom.  I actually like her.  she <br/>
funny and easy to talk to.  I do know that she doesn&#39;t enjoy being <br/>
with her kids, without having *something* to do.  She has told me <br/>
that, they drive her crazy if they aren&#39;t doing an activity or have a <br/>
friend over.<br/>
