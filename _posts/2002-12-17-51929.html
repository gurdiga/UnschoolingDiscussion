<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186526435"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I can see where you can feel jumped on, you offer something that works <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for you and<br/>
people here say that it is not the best way.<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
ANd - really - people seldom ever say even THAT.  I mean - I think what we <br/>
usually hear here are what people think are &quot;even better&quot; ways - and can&#39;t <br/>
we ALL do better?<br/>
<br/>
Fair warning is given in the description of this list. All of us subject <br/>
our ideas to probing and analysis and critique when we post them here. That <br/>
is why we do it. We learn and grow from that process. Sometimes I become <br/>
more clear in my own head about why I&#39;ve made a decision I&#39;ve made - not <br/>
changing my mind. Sometimes I resist changing my mind - I don&#39;t want to <br/>
think that I have more work to do - that I still haven&#39;t gotten it &quot;right.&quot; <br/>
Truth is - none of us has it absolutely perfectly &quot;right&quot; - but many of us <br/>
have a lot of varied experience with long-term unschooling and we have a <br/>
lot of insight to offer. Some of us have spent years really loooking very <br/>
very HARD at unschooling families - talking about it, tearing it apart, <br/>
analyzing it, trying out various hypotheses and rejecting many of them. <br/>
People who are new to the ideas can have some of the benefit of all that <br/>
time we spent - but they have to drop their defensiveness and be willing to <br/>
hear what might feel like criticism. The attitude that helped me handle it <br/>
was that this is JUST email - nobody here can make me do anything - it <br/>
doesn&#39;t hurt me to listen and consider ideas, even those that are critical <br/>
or feel like attacks. Being open to the possibility that what people say <br/>
might be true EVEN (or especially) when it feels like an attack can let you <br/>
open up to ideas that you might otherwise not give due consideration to - <br/>
it doesn&#39;t hurt to consider them. Be brave.<br/>
<br/>
Some people just want to be supported in what they&#39;ve already decided is <br/>
best. And that can be nice and can be important if they&#39;re having a hard <br/>
time sticking to those choices in the face of criticism or other <br/>
difficulties. There is a place for support and you can get a lot of it here.<br/>
<br/>
If someone came here and said, &quot;I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;m not going to impose a <br/>
formal curriculum on my child anymore,&quot; they&#39;d get pure and simple support <br/>
for that.<br/>
<br/>
Then, if they went on and said, &quot;But I&#39;m JUSTgoing to have them do a math <br/>
curriculum, nothing else,&quot; then they&#39;d get a lot of response about how it <br/>
would be even BETTER to not even do that and how unnecessary it is and what <br/>
the alternatives are and the possible harm of continuing on that path, etc. <br/>
THAT is support for taking the unschooling principles a step further.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t diminish the support for dropping the full curriculum to say <br/>
that we think someone can go farther and be even happier with their decision.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t support to hold back and not say anything when you have a good <br/>
idea for someone.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, lots of times when people don&#39;t like what they&#39;re hearing - they <br/>
blame the messenger - on email lists they blame &quot;tone&quot; etc. Try to rise <br/>
above that and read ONLY the content and you&#39;ll feel more supported by the <br/>
incredible amount of time and energy and love of children that pours <br/>
through this list.<br/>
