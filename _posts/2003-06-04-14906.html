<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365821956">Hi!<br/>
As I said in a previous post, I am new to unschooling.<br/>
 I like everything I have read.  But maybe someone<br/>
would be willing to wax eloquently for me about some<br/>
things I have been wondering.<br/>
<br/>
1) What if you have a child who is a poor speller? <br/>
Using a Franklin speller, dictionary, asking mom<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to make much of a difference.  If the<br/>
poor spelling skills bothers a child, is it ok to work<br/>
more deliberately on spelling?<br/>
<br/>
2) I know a lot of skills are covered in every day<br/>
living, but how do you actually cover basic skills so<br/>
that your child doesn&#39;t have these big gaps or<br/>
splinter skills?<br/>
<br/>
3) I am confused about unschooling vs. little<br/>
schooling.  It is often hard for me to tell the<br/>
difference.  I am not talking about anyone on this<br/>
list, so please don&#39;t take offense.  But I don&#39;t get a<br/>
sense of kids with lots of depth and breadth who are<br/>
unschooling.  This scares me.  I know there are<br/>
wonderful unschooling kids out there who do all kinds<br/>
of things, but they aren&#39;t the typical kids I have<br/>
met.<br/>

<br/>
How old?  I missed that I guess.<br/>
If she&#39;s bothered because people (parents) are telling her she&#39;s spelling<br/>
stuff wrong then maybe that just needs to stop.<br/>
If she&#39;s bothered because she really wants to spell well for her own<br/>
reasons, then I&#39;d ask how I could help.<br/>
<br/>
Looking up correct spelling does make a difference.  You spell that word<br/>
right.  If you&#39;re talking long term, spell every word right from now on, <br/>
she&#39;ll get there, or maybe not.  I&#39;m grateful every day for spell<br/>
check.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
***how do you actually cover basic skills so<br/>
that your child doesn&#39;t have these big gaps or<br/>
splinter skills?***<br/>
<br/>
Every kid who&#39;s ever gone to school has gaps.   People learn to close the<br/>
gaps when they have a need to do so.   She&#39;ll find a way to spell the<br/>
words right on a party invitation and the next time on a birthday card<br/>
and eventually on a job application.  Exposure to written language and an<br/>
interest in spelling words correctly will be her gap filler.   <br/>
<br/>
***  But I don&#39;t get a<br/>
sense of kids with lots of depth and breadth who are<br/>
unschooling. <br/>
I know there are<br/>
wonderful unschooling kids out there who do all kinds<br/>
of things, but they aren&#39;t the typical kids I have<br/>
met.***<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m lost.   You are interested in unschooling but the unschoolers you<br/>
know are shallow and ignorant?  Which of those things sparked your<br/>
interest?&lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If there&#39;s a skill that can&#39;t be covered in real life (not necessarily <br/>
&quot;everyday living,&quot; but in the world at large) then it&#39;s not a real-life skill, is it?<br/>
<br/>
What would a &quot;splinter skill&quot; be?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But I don&#39;t get a<br/>
sense of kids with lots of depth and breadth who are<br/>
unschooling.  This scares me.  I know there are<br/>
wonderful unschooling kids out there who do all kinds<br/>
of things, but they aren&#39;t the typical kids I have<br/>
met.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At what age are you measuring them for depth and breadth, and with what tools?<br/>
<br/>
I think unschoolers have a kind of storing-up phase they go through (thinking <br/>
of those who never were in school) and when they&#39;re littlish, 7 to ten, <br/>
maybe, they might seem behind.  Then all that stored up stuff starts to fit <br/>
together and they blossom HUGELY.<br/>

<br/>
I forgot this one.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of factors.  It&#39;s not a simple question.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible, worst-case scenario, for a parent to make a child feel <br/>
retarded and in need of remediation NOW, and HARD, and that if spelling doesn&#39;t come <br/>
within a short time frame, to the parent&#39;s imagined specifications, then life <br/>
is marred, scarred, ruined.<br/>
<br/>
The worst things school can do, parents can do too.<br/>
<br/>
If a child wants help, it is sometimes a desire to shush up the mom.  &quot;What <br/>
can I do, and how quickly, to get you to stop looking at me like I&#39;m stupid?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If parents can change from measuring and comparing to accepting and <br/>
encouraging, thousands of little switches are flipped, in parts of life you didn&#39;t even <br/>
know you had.<br/>
<br/>
My husband learned to spell as an adult.  Some others probably will then too.<br/>
Better for them to learn to spell as happy, confident adults than as stunted, <br/>
shamed adults.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What if you are an adult that is a poor speller? Big deal. Some people are <br/>
really great at getting the flow and memorizing what words look like, some <br/>
aren&#39;t. Shaming them and forcing them to practice won&#39;t change a thing.<br/>
Letting them blossom in their own way, in their own time produces the best <br/>
results.<br/>
Skills are meaningful only if learned because the learner wants/needs the <br/>
information.<br/>
My 13 y.o. is not the greatest speller, but he is now joyfully writing <br/>
stories and really interested in getting the words right..because it matters to him. <br/>
Not because I made him practice.<br/>
I have a BIL that is a poor speller. He has a very high paying job (in excess <br/>
of $100,000 per year plus bonuses) and is part owner in the company. I guess <br/>
spelling has nothing to do with future income potential!! :) I could share <br/>
other stories about poor spellers that are very successsful, each in their own <br/>
way, but I think you get the idea.<br/>
<br/>
2) I know a lot of skills are covered in every day<br/>
living, but how do you actually cover basic skills so<br/>
that your child doesn&#39;t have these big gaps or<br/>
splinter skills? <br/>
<br/>
I have no idea on earth what a &quot;splinter skill&quot; is, but if you mean bits of <br/>
knowledge that don&#39;t seem connected to anything else, well those are WONDERFUL! <br/>
Every thing in the whole wide world is connected, and kids will slowly piece <br/>
those bits together, as they are exposed to and explore the world.<br/>
All &quot;basic&quot; skills are covered in every day living...otherwise they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
be considered basics nor important for every day life!<br/>
People learn necessary bits of information by doing what they love, it&#39;s <br/>
being proven every day by unschooling families all over the world.<br/>
<br/>
3) I am confused about unschooling vs. little<br/>
schooling. It is often hard for me to tell the<br/>
difference. I am not talking about anyone on this<br/>
list, so please don&#39;t take offense. But I don&#39;t get a<br/>
sense of kids with lots of depth and breadth who are<br/>
unschooling. This scares me. I know there are<br/>
wonderful unschooling kids out there who do all kinds<br/>
of things, but they aren&#39;t the typical kids I have<br/>
met. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is NOT schooling....&quot;little&quot; schooling as you say, wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
unschooling. Unless the child is really wanting something school related, we <br/>
don&#39;t put it on them...ever.  I have a six y.o. that positively loves workbooks. <br/>
But I don&#39;t get them out and ask her to do them, she gets them out and asks me <br/>
to help.<br/>
And I do. But I also find loads of fun things to do so she doesn&#39;t get all <br/>
obsessed with that type of experience and think that it equals learning and <br/>
other things don&#39;t!<br/>
<br/>
As to the comment about unschoolers..I&#39;m baffled!<br/>
If you&#39;re measuring them by the school yardstick, then I can see why you <br/>
think there is no &quot;breadth and depth&quot; as you say.<br/>
But depth is not measured by how much a person memorizes to jump through <br/>
hoops....it&#39;s measured by the quality of ones life. By the character of a person <br/>
and the interests they have.<br/>
Depth is when my 13 y.o. cuddles up with his two y.o. brother, or lovingly <br/>
cleans his face or puts him in the swing just because he loves him.<br/>
Depth is when my 6 and 2y.o. sip tea together and clink their teacups and say <br/>
&quot;cheers&quot;. It&#39;s when (like last night) there are all six of us piled onto the <br/>
king size bed watching &quot;Miss Universe&quot; pagent and making comments on boobs and <br/>
butts and laughing.  Measuring depth in a life is about how happy and <br/>
fulfilled people are!!<br/>
<br/>
As to the &quot;Breadth&quot;...shouldn&#39;t that be about curiosity levels? Types of <br/>
interests? Different conversations a person can hold intelligently?<br/>
My 13y.o. can hold a conversation with so many different people, about so <br/>
many different topics it sometimes shocks me!! He is now learning things I have <br/>
no idea where the information comes from unless I ask him. <br/>
My 9y.o. is an obsessive artist. He knows about professional art materials, <br/>
how to use spray fixative, charcoal, kneaded erasers and watercolor pencils. <br/>
I bought a new printer yesterday. Trevor eagerly volunteered to set it all <br/>
up....which I was a little leary about. I just said &quot;go for it, let me know if <br/>
you need me&quot; and left the room. He had it connected, with ink cartridges in and <br/>
ready for the software to load before he had any questions! He&#39;d never done <br/>
anything with a printer in his life, other than print pages from the internet. <br/>
So breadth has more to do with adaptability, bits of knowledge that allow a <br/>
person to connect pieces to other things with ease and willingness to try new <br/>
things in my book.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers have unlimited interests, broad ranges of knowledge that are far <br/>
removed from academia! How cool.<br/>
They are learning about the real world, while their school counterparts are <br/>
memorizing bits of tedious crap that means nothing to them. When they are <br/>
adults, what is going to serve them better? The ability to adapt, be creative and <br/>
learn with joy, or  have some memorized facts that may or may not have anything <br/>
to do with their fields of interest?<br/>
I&#39;ll take the former, thank you.<br/>
