&gt;What do all your kids say when people ask what grade<br/>
&gt;they&#39;re in? Do they just say 3rd if they&#39;re 8, or do<br/>
&gt;they start explaining about being homeschooled?<br/>
&gt;Because usually people who ask that are just making<br/>
&gt;small talk. Is it our responsibility to demystify<br/>
&gt;homeschooling by telling everyone we meet we do it? Or<br/>
&gt;is it ok to just say 3rd grade?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;**It all depends on the situation. If it&#39;s someone I know and we have time<br/>
&gt;to talk (and they act like this isn&#39;t just standard kid questioning) then I<br/>
&gt;explain unschooling. If it&#39;s just some person I&#39;ll probably never talk to<br/>
&gt;again we give them their grade levels. If I can remember what they are. <br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;gotten funny looks when I have to ask the kids.<br/>

&lt;&lt; i tell people since we homeschool, i don&#39;t worry about arbitrary things <br/>

<br/>
When it has really mattered (not very often! &lt;g&gt;) we go by birthdays, but <br/>
schoolyear changes by birthday as though the kid started first grade at 6.  <br/>
So with Kirby, a summer birth, it&#39;s &quot;right&quot; and easy--he&#39;s 14 so he would be <br/>
9th grade.  Marty is 12, but his birthday was January, so we would say (but <br/>
haven&#39;t had the need to) 7th grade.  <br/>
<br/>
Those two are at the ages I taught--7th and 9th grades.  So for a bit here my <br/>
confidence is EXTRA high.  There are things some of those kids could do that <br/>
my kids can&#39;t do.  There are things NONE of those kids could do that my kids <br/>
can do.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids are missing formal math (equations and how to set out a problem and <br/>
&quot;show the steps,&quot; but my kids actually understand and USE those concepts, so <br/>
it will take them moments to learn to put it down &quot;right&quot; (if indeed they <br/>
ever need to--because standardized tests are multiple choice, not &quot;show the <br/>
work&quot;).<br/>
