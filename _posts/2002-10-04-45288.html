&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; do well pumping, so any suggestions? Will my little guy get the message and<br/>
&gt; then nurse longer? Amy<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Amy - you only need to end it for a few minutes then let him go back to it. <br/>
That&#39;s enough to give him the idea that &quot;chewing&quot; means his nursing gets <br/>
interrupted, which he won&#39;t like.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think they&#39;re often more like &quot;projects&quot; than like pets. Which isn&#39;t any <br/>
better, imo.<br/>
<br/>
But, some of us chose to have them to add to the joy of a life lived with a <br/>
close family. Which means that &quot;a joyful now&quot; counts as much as their future <br/>
success.<br/>
