<div id="ygrps-yiv-323203116">If this were one of my children I would say something like, &quot;Don&#39;t worry <br/>
about the class.  It was a bad idea to spend that much money instead of <br/>
getting our own study books, but we&#39;ll both know bettter in the future, so <br/>
we&#39;ve learned from this experience.&quot;  If he seemed to still feel guilty <br/>
about the money, after reassuring him that it really is okay, I&#39;d tell him <br/>
that he can pay me back in the future if he thinks that he should or if it <br/>
would make him feel better.  But to me there is no debt - I&#39;ve wasted or <br/>
lost money on plenty of things in my life.<br/>
<br/>
I sure woudn&#39;t make him go to the class just because its been paid for. <br/>
What?  &quot;You&#39;ve paid for this prison and misery and now I&#39;m going to make <br/>
sure you get the full dose?&quot; or worse, &quot;I wasted my hard-earned money on you <br/>
and now you must suffer.&quot;   How cruel.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-812044625">If the kid wants to take the SAT to get into college, though, maybe not  <br/>
getting through five sessions (or however many) of school-like class might be a  <br/>
clue that he doesn&#39;t want to shell money out for college, either.<br/>
 <br/>
If he goes to the series, he can spend the time doodling or wondering what  <br/>
the odds are that he&#39;ll be free of such situations in college.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-DEMAND your money back! If the class is as your son describes, it is  a<br/>
bad class and they should refund your money. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Depends on what the contract was under which money was handed over.   If the <br/>
thing said &quot;no refunds,&quot; that&#39;s the deal.  I&#39;ve never heard of any  school <br/>
saying, &quot;If you&#39;re bored, we&#39;ll gladly refund your money.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I would leave out any mention of your son as a homeschooler. It  is<br/>
irrelevant and could muddy the water.=-<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not irrelevant.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Clearly the class is not as it was promoted, or your son would not  be<br/>
experiencing something so different from his expectations. <br/>
 <br/>
If it&#39;s the first class he&#39;s ever been in, of course he didn&#39;t know what to  <br/>
expect.<br/>
 <br/>
The fact that people pay for reviews for tests, and buy expensive prep  <br/>
books, and hire coaches for law school and med school tests shines a big  spotlight <br/>
on the lameness of the tests themselves.  They&#39;re not testing  indwelling <br/>
knowledge, or the depth of a life lived to that point.  It&#39;s  more cramathon.  If <br/>
people can&#39;t cram for a big test like that, they  probably don&#39;t have what it <br/>
takes to cram for college.<br/>

I&#39;m curious. Why discourage Karen & son from trying to get the money<br/>
back? Is this about them learning some kind of lesson? Taking their<br/>
lumps for not unschooling according to Hoyle? Of course some<br/>
businesses say &quot;no refunds&quot;. We all know that. Does that give them<br/>
carte blanche to serve up swill? Anyway, Karen didn&#39;t tell us the<br/>
company&#39;s refund policy. (But if it&#39;s that unbending, it deserves to<br/>
be fought.)<br/>

<br/>
It is irrelevant to whether their class is crummy or not. It is<br/>
irrelevant to whether they should give this unsatisfied customer his<br/>
(family&#39;s) money back.<br/>

<br/>
It is not his first class. Karen says in her original post that he&#39;s<br/>
been homeschooling for 3 years.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it&#39;s not the only class he&#39;s taking right now. He&#39;s loving his<br/>
writing class. I say, bully for him, he knows good education from bad!<br/>
He won&#39;t stand for being patronized or bored or belittled or<br/>
institutionalized! I celebrate it as a triumph! (And it didn&#39;t even<br/>
cost me $250, so it&#39;s easy from over here! ;) )<br/>

Agreed!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If <br/>
&gt; people can&#39;t cram for a big test like that, they probably don&#39;t have<br/>
what it <br/>
&gt; takes to cram for college.<br/>
<br/>
Right. But is it wrong to want to attain &quot;what it takes&quot;? That&#39;s what<br/>
Karen&#39;s son was doing. Why put him down? He just got a bad class that<br/>
wasn&#39;t what it promised to be, that&#39;s all.<br/>

-------------<br/>
 <br/>
If there was a no-refund policy, I think that should be that.<br/>
 <br/>
If there wasn&#39;t, there&#39;s no discouragement.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t like dishonesty at all.  If they honestly signed up for a  no-refund <br/>
situation, any balking would be dishonest.<br/>
 <br/>
Interesting, fun courses are the exception.  Just because a few people  can <br/>
manage to provide them does NOT make it the norm, nor the standard to meet  <br/>
else refunds become reasonable.<br/>
 <br/>
If fun courses were the norm, all our kids could be at school and we could  <br/>
all be teachers.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- Anyway, Karen didn&#39;t tell us the<br/>

 <br/>
Perhaps.  <br/>
 <br/>
But if someone hadn&#39;t been to class<br/>
is going to class in preparation for going to other classes<br/>
and hated the first class he ever went to<br/>
 <br/>
how is that worthy of a refund?<br/>
 <br/>
Classes frequently suck.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- Taking their lumps for not unschooling according to Hoyle? -=-<br/>
 <br/>
What on earth would that mean?<br/>
It shouldn&#39;t matter why/how someone is signing up for a course offered to  <br/>
anyone who signs up.  What &quot;lumps&quot;?  What should unschooling have to  do with <br/>
whether they would qualify for a refund?<br/>

<br/>
I assumed that she&#39;d try that, of course, and her question was based on <br/>
assuming they couldn&#39;t get the money back.<br/>
<br/>
It is pretty common not to be able to get money back for classes - the <br/>
fees are based on the number of people and if somebody drops out when <br/>
it is too late to add somebody else, they give up their fee.<br/>
<br/>
-pam<br/>
<br/>
And it is unschooling according to Holt, not Hoyle, that we&#39;re talking <br/>
about here, by the way. &lt;g&gt;</div>

So did I. My understanding was that the real problem was a recalcitrant<br/>
hubby mourning the loss of the bread, and her need was for ideas for helping<br/>
him see that from a different place. I think she got some. Hope they work<br/>
out.<br/>
