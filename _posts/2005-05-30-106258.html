Example: I called college admissions for one of my kids last  week<br/>
(she&#39;s interested in Boston College). When the admissions  counselor<br/>
started ticking off what my dd needed to do as a homeschooler to  get<br/>
in, I felt that familiar sick feeling of panic. What if she wants  to<br/>
go there but I&#39;ve prevented her by not having her follow a  curriculum<br/>
(which they stated over and over again she had to do)?<br/>
<br/>
So  what am I to do? And can that be discussed here? Those are the<br/>
kinds of  thoughts that run through my head.<br/>
<br/>

----------------------<br/>
 <br/>
You started that first parapgraph with &quot;the (singular) admissions  <br/>
counsellor&quot; and ended with &quot;they.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;They&quot; (the college&quot;) probably didn&#39;t state anything over and  over.  One <br/>
person did.<br/>
If in stead of saying &quot;homeschooled&quot; you had said &quot;Who can I talk to  about <br/>
admission for someone who was alternatively educated?  Who&#39;s the  special <br/>
admissions expert?&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
They can&#39;t tell you she &quot;had to&quot; follow a curriculum.  The most  they can <br/>
&quot;require&quot; is that she has studied (or been exposed to, they can&#39;t  require or <br/>
prove &quot;learned&quot;) some areas so that she&#39;s not totally stumped  by their beginning <br/>
level courses.  Some schools have no remedial  level.  Other places DO and <br/>
they have tutors.  Maybe she&#39;ll need  that and maybe she won&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe she could take a couple of classes at a junior or community  college <br/>
before applying there, and that could be part of the application, that  she did <br/>
well in this class or that.<br/>
