<div id="ygrps-yiv-655632852">We have a cat who occaionaly goes through this too. I&#39;ve found a<br/>
relationship to thigns being eaten along with the cat food that are<br/>
undigestable....tinsel, mouse parts (ok digestable but sometimes they&#39;re<br/>
there too), bits of easter grass, the plastic off of twist ties, etc and<br/>
sometimes their own hairballs increase in frequency durring those barfy<br/>
times.<br/>
Then it goes away for months.<br/>
One thing that has worked is when She is going through a barfy phase is<br/>
to put a little dab of vaseline on each front paw ( 1 tsp total). It<br/>
seams to help move things through the digestive tract easier.<br/>
A vet gave this advice years ago for a different cat but it does seem to<br/>
help.<br/>
