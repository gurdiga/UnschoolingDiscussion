<div id="ygrps-yiv-924456077">Hello to all..I&#39;ve been reading allot on the Unschooling web site and<br/>
thought I would try the egroup too. I have 3 daughters ages 16, 10 and 5 and<br/>
we have been homeschoolers for about 8 yrs now. We started out doing the<br/>
school-at- home thing..then unit studies..then Charlotte Mason..and finally<br/>
had to admit that unschooling is what works for us. (I would love to have<br/>
the $$ back that we wasted on this or that curriculum! ) If only I could<br/>
have read all those great &#39;unschool&#39; books first!  We are very much the<br/>
odd-balls within our local hs community, as it&#39;s very conservative and more<br/>
schoolish than we care to be. At least I am now enjoying helping new hs<br/>
people to get started, not necessarily pushing unschooling, but definitely<br/>
letting them know that there are other ways to learn. Who knows..maybe soon<br/>
there will be more unschooler&#39;s here and we&#39;ll be able to have our own<br/>
group!<br/>

Hi Julie...this is what I do, also. Friends and relatives call me when they<br/>
are considering or starting to homeschool. I let them know about all the<br/>
resources and explain unschooling, without trying to scare them. Welcome to<br/>
the list.<br/>
