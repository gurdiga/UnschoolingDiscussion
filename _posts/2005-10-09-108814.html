<div id="ygrps-yiv-679732218">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I joined this list while pregnant, and I&#39;m back to reading avidly now that<br/>
my son is 5-1/2 months old.  I&#39;m finding that much of what you say applies<br/>
to life with an infant--strewing, giving him a rich and interesting<br/>
environment, communicating respectfully, avoiding coercion, etc.--so thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Lately I&#39;ve been reading with interest on Sandra&#39;s site, particularly about<br/>
food issues.  Maybe it&#39;s because Dmitri is just starting to show some<br/>
interest in starting solids.  I know my husband and I want to model healthy,<br/>
non-controlling attitudes toward food, but we&#39;re not there yet.  I&#39;m looking<br/>
for stories of your experiences deschooling yourselves when it comes to food<br/>
issues.<br/>
<br/>
Our particular issue is that my husband and I, at least according to the way<br/>
we&#39;re perceiving things now, are &quot;addicted&quot; to sugar and white flour.  We<br/>
are currently in a healthy mode (whole grains/no sugar) and feeling<br/>
physically good, but we&#39;re only eating this way through a kind of rigid<br/>
self-discipline.  We both REALLY want &quot;the bad stuff&quot; at times but don&#39;t<br/>
trust ourselves to have access to it.<br/>
<br/>
So what do we do?  Continue on this path of self-denial or stuff a couple of<br/>
luscious Ritter dark chocolate marzipan bars into our gaping maws?  I&#39;m<br/>
treating myself like an adult controlling a child:  &quot;All she&#39;ll do is eat<br/>
candy all day.  She&#39;ll NEVER eat any kale if I don&#39;t make her!&quot;  In light of<br/>
my past behavior (overconsumption of junk and underconsumption of veggies),<br/>
this seems to be true.  <br/>
<br/>
Is there any hope for me and dh?  I think if we can trust ourselves with<br/>
food, we&#39;ll certainly be able to trust Dmitri without reservations.  Your<br/>
tales of how you de-food-schooled yourselves are most welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

easier to not get piggy about snacks if I didn&#39;t forbid myself to  <br/>
have them I still found that answering a craving for a candy bar or  <br/>
cookies often made me just want more. :-/ And I had a lot of &quot;I want  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s 2 weeks of no carbohydrates then slowly reintroducing them,  <br/>
choosing whole grains rather than refined so the goal is to eat a  <br/>
regular diet -- just healthier. Even after a couple days I wasn&#39;t  <br/>
having the &quot;I don&#39;t know what I wants,&quot; and didn&#39;t crave huge plates  <br/>
of pasta (still don&#39;t and I did it 6 months ago). You actually eat a  <br/>
lot of food and it includes fat so i rarely felt hungry.<br/>
<br/>
I found it very very easy to do online. (http:// <br/>
www.southbeachdiet.com/index3.asp) They give you a week&#39;s worth of  <br/>
recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks -- you can pick other  <br/>
recipes if you don&#39;t like their suggestions for the week but I liked  <br/>
most of them -- and you can print out a shopping list (that you can  <br/>
pre-edit to remove the things you already have). They have a recipe  <br/>
book too that&#39;s cheaper than doing it on line but not quite as handy  <br/>
or nifty. :-)<br/>

Yes, that&#39;s just it.  I want to find a way to move beyond these food<br/>

<br/>
Dh and I have found that the only thing that makes our cravings go away is<br/>
to go completely no sugar and to avoid all refined grains.  If we have a<br/>
tiny bit, we start wanting lots of sugar again.  <br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering if it has to be that way.  I don&#39;t expect Dmitri to<br/>
grow up with a ban on sugar or white bread; I have confidence that he&#39;ll be<br/>
able to self-regulate.  But are his parents permanently damaged?  I had<br/>
hopes that we could also learn to self-regulate with no strict bans as he<br/>
starts his journey into eating food along with us.  I guess we&#39;ve still got<br/>
time to learn, though.  He&#39;s still exclusively breastfed!  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe just saying yes to yourself the way you say yes to your kids<br/>
could help.  Everybody is different, but I have seen the way my kids&#39;<br/>
infatuation with sugary, formerly off-limits food has waned since I<br/>
started having it in the house all the time, so I started doing it for<br/>
myself.  When I was loosening the controls for my kids, I used to<br/>
purposely buy things that I didn&#39;t crave, but when I saw how well the<br/>
un-controlling thing started working with them (choosing Cheerios over<br/>
Apple Jacks? That was the clincher for me), I did it for myself.  My<br/>
big thing is chocolate; I used to eat close to a whole big bag of<br/>
Hershey&#39;s Kisses in a day whenever I bought them, so I started buying<br/>
them all the time and eating them whenever I wanted.  At first, I had<br/>
to buy a bag every couple of days, but that didn&#39;t last long.  Now, I<br/>
go weeks without having to buy a new bag.  I grab a couple whenever I<br/>
feel like it and I no longer feel the need to binge on them because I<br/>
know I can have them whenever I want.  It has worked really well for<br/>
me.  Granted, it didn&#39;t happen overnight, but I just lost 12 pounds<br/>
over the course of the last few of months and it&#39;s not because I&#39;ve<br/>
been exercising more; it&#39;s because I don&#39;t have to binge anymore<br/>
because there is no<br/>
I-don&#39;t-know-when-I&#39;ll-ever-get-to-eat-this-again-so-I-should-probably-eat-it-all<br/>

Your tales of how you de-food-schooled yourselves are most welcome. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that it is necessary to de-food-school yourself *first* in<br/>
order to apply the principle of freedom of choice to one&#39;s children.<br/>
<br/>
While pregnant I read a few articles in different types of publications,<br/>
about how young children when allowed to choose from a broad range of food<br/>
choices would choose a perfectly balanced diet over a period of time such as<br/>
a week or a month. I read many stories here on these lists about odd food<br/>
preferences turning out temporary and that for *most* of our children good<br/>
health was continuing without the parents needing to take charge of their<br/>
children&#39;s eating. My feeling was and is that I could trust the research of<br/>
these observant people whose experience with children was so different from<br/>
the emotionally charged &quot;food life&quot; that I had led as a youngster. <br/>
<br/>
Yet *I* am not necessarily able to de-food myself, that I am not always able<br/>
to trust my own body to give me cues that are not emotionally laden (eg<br/>
comfort eating at times or just not feeling hungry when I am worried about<br/>
something). However Jayn suffers from no such issues. <br/>
<br/>
I have observed her eating habits and can make some reasoned predictions<br/>
about what she is likely to want, but the original premises - that she was<br/>
capable of making choices that worked, that food did not have to be endowed<br/>
with emotional loadings (beyond enjoyment), and that, nutritional pyramids<br/>
notwithstanding, food need not be sorted into a good/bad hierarchy - these<br/>
hold true for Jayn.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like there are a couple of instances mentioned on the list about<br/>
children with medical or other issues that impact their ability to listen to<br/>
their bodies. Many suggestions have been made in the direction of being<br/>
these children&#39;s allies rather than taking on the role of enforcer. <br/>
<br/>
Unlike in scientific experiments where one exception disproves the<br/>
hypothesis, needing to adapt to these unusual or extreme situations, does<br/>
not have to negate the full application of food freedoms in the lives of the<br/>
majority.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been thinking about this thread for a couple of days now.  This <br/>
topic was near and dear to my heart when my children were babies.  Funny <br/>
that I barely even think about it now that my kids are 9 and 5.  As a <br/>
fellow vegan, I understand about wanting your children to eat healthy <br/>
diets.  It doesn&#39;t sound to me like you need any advice, you are doing <br/>
fantastic.  However, I&#39;ll give a little pep talk and let you know that <br/>
what you are doing and what you are planning on doing really works!<br/>
<br/>
Definitely breastfeed as long as your son wants.  Let him eat what he <br/>
wants, when he wants and always have an open kitchen.  Don&#39;t force solid <br/>
foods into him until he wants them.  Basically, take his lead completely.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters have no food issues at all.  Their diets are amazingly <br/>
healthy.  They eat better than I do, by far, naturally.  Eating healthy <br/>
does not come easily to me due to my upbringing.  My daughters were born <br/>
with the innate ability to know when they are hungry and to know when <br/>
they are full.  That was forced out of me.  They have no problems <br/>
turning down candy when they aren&#39;t hungry for it or &quot;meal type&quot; foods <br/>
when they don&#39;t want them.  They don&#39;t worry about cleaning their plates <br/>
and they don&#39;t worry about having to eat it all right then in order to <br/>
get it all.  They don&#39;t worry what time it is.  They eat when they are <br/>
hungry and they stop when they are full.  They have never felt guilt or <br/>
deprivation over foods.  I&#39;m amazed by them every single day and I try <br/>
to live by their example.  I learn from them regarding food and eating.<br/>

I think maybe somewhere in there is the story of our ordering apple pie right <br/>
after sitting down at a restaurant, when Marty and Kirby were two and five or <br/>
so, and the other adults commenting that now they wouldn&#39;t eat any other <br/>
food.   <br/>
<br/>
Wrong!   <br/>
And we knew it was wrong. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pie is something the waiters can get without ordering it from the cooks, and <br/>
so the kids had something to do and weren&#39;t hungry.   When the chicken and <br/>
potatoes came, they were happy to eat that too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-789503686">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; So, my question is, if we&#39;ve done this and our kids have come to<br/>
expect, anticipate and request dessert after dinner every night, how<br/>
would you go about remedying this without denying their request? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested in hearing why having dessert is a problem for *your family*<br/>
that needs to be &quot;remedied&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
If everyone is enjoying having dinner and dessert and enjoying being at the<br/>
table (if that is how you are currently eating) together, why change what is<br/>
working?<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m confused about what your goal is in seeking suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
If it is just a case of too much work for the chef, there are sweet foods<br/>
that don&#39;t require much preparation or that kids can get for themselves -<br/>
sliced fruits, ice cream sandwiches, popsicles.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Maybe offer dessert before dinner? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why not do so in the spirit of fun and see what happens?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve already removed food restrictions for quite sometime but we all<br/>
still have the habit of having dessert AFTER dinner. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just because something is a habit, it does not necessarily follow that it is<br/>
a *bad* habit or harmful. <br/>
<br/>
Are you concerned that your kids are eating too much because they are adding<br/>
dessert even though they are full? That could be just not yet enough time<br/>
for the certainty of abundance to have taken hold - &quot;quite sometime&quot; is a<br/>
variable quantity. ;) <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t do formal dessert unless we are at Home Town Buffet. Jayn seems to<br/>
find it fun to eat a carrot cake or two after enjoying her mac and cheese<br/>
and other foods. At home there is no difference between any kind of food - I<br/>
make a savory dinner, but sometimes any one of us will be eating a popsicle<br/>
or cut fruit or ice cream or lollipop before dinner, or so much later that<br/>
it can&#39;t count as dessert but as a late supper snack.<br/>
<br/>
I guess insisting that people not have dessert despite desire for it, is<br/>
just as problematic in the relationship as insisting that they eat their<br/>
main meal before being permitted dessert. I wouldn&#39;t recommend either path.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-953129386">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I suspect that they often eat it out of some habit and some emotional<br/>
attachment to its previous reward value.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for explaining. If this is what your heart is telling you, it<br/>
seems really likely to be so.<br/>
<br/>
I think the buffet plan is probably a good one. However maybe you could also<br/>
think about initiating some other non-food related &quot;end of day&quot;<br/>
rewarding/reconnecting ritual that would help fulfill the need that the<br/>
dessert currently does. What that ritual might be eludes me, but others may<br/>
have some ideas.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; For many years I&#39;ve struggled with emotional eating.  I used to  <br/>
reward myself after the<br/>
kids were asleep, on another day of intensive mothering under my  <br/>
belt, by eating a sweet<br/>
treat.  I think our mainstream food culture promotes this common food  <br/>
= reward mentality<br/>
and I&#39;ve unwittingly done that to my kids.  I want to undo it somehow.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the culture does this - especially in the language that women<br/>
tend to apply to food (eg I&#39;ve been &quot;good&quot; today I didn&#39;t eat too much) I<br/>
try to be observant of my language use. I&#39;d encourage you to be so also -<br/>
just in case that reward idea is still permeating your vocabulary<br/>
unrecognized.<br/>

kind of work for him, then he&#39;s somehow less in your eyes.   Maybe he needs <br/>
some reassurance that is not the case, that you love him no  matter what.  The <br/>
good news is that if that is the case--if the dessert is  tied to YOU doing <br/>
something for him--then maybe you could find a way to  associate something else to <br/>
his measure of your love.<br/>
 <br/>
I maybe totally off base, but maybe not.  I know my kids like me to do  <br/>
simple things for them that make them feel loved.<br/>

I&#39;m scared of saying yes because it&#39;s that old trust issue.  I guess I<br/>

Very encouraging!  Although I want to overcome my own food issues for my<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See, though, that&#39;s a justification for eating.<br/>
<br/>
If you think about whether you really WANT it for physical reasons or if <br/>
you&#39;re wanting it for psychological reasons (afraid it will be gone, you &quot;deserve&quot; <br/>
it, you want the [psychological] temptation to disappear), then you&#39;ll start <br/>
to learn to feel what you want and need in your body, not what the little <br/>
voices in your head are saying.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m scared of saying yes because it&#39;s that old trust issue.  I guess I<br/>

<br/>
You see what saying no does, though, if people said no to you.<br/>
<br/>
If you NEVER did it, your kids would have what&#39;s natural, not a bunch of <br/>
little messages imbedded in their superego talking to them about food.   <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re doing it now and you want to quit someday...   that still does <br/>
damage now.<br/>
Some of the damage can be undone, but some will stay forever.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Kids will do fine IF you don&#39;t repeat the warping parental behavior.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right, it does come down to trust just like it does with our kids.  We<br/>
start trusting them, but our own mother&#39;s lack of trust in *us* is<br/>
still ruling the way *we* eat.  Saying no to myself was only making me<br/>
put those foods up on a pedestal where I would constantly think about<br/>
them and want them and then have an all-out binge in a moment of<br/>
perceived weakness.  Oh, and then the guilt.  That was fun.  <br/>
<br/>
Saying yes to myself the way I did with my kids changed everything. <br/>
Scary, yes, but absolutely life changing.  <br/>

<br/>
I eat what I enjoy, which is a wide variety. I try to listen to &quot;what do I<br/>
feel like?&quot; I avoid dairy because of lactose intolerance (I miss pizza and<br/>
cream sauces but not much), and super spicy food because it&#39;ll give me<br/>
heartburn. I just don&#39;t stuff myself. When PMS&#39;ing, I crave chocolate or<br/>
meringues. I give in to those cravings. I have renounced any form of calorie<br/>
counting, or narrow definitions of diets (caveat: when I was pregnant I<br/>
followed Bradley). I like almost all fruits, and rice and sushi. I never<br/>
think of salads, unless reminded, but I always enjoy them when they&#39;re in<br/>
front of me. I&#39;m a big sandwich consumer - as in sliced bread, not burgers. <br/>
<br/>
If I get hungry I tend to notice heartburn or sudden grazing as cues, before<br/>
any sense of emptiness these days. If I am cranky, I think about when I last<br/>
ate and take steps appropriately. I went back to my pre-pregnancy weight<br/>
within 6 months with no particular effort, and have not changed my weight or<br/>
size since. I usually drink water ahead of other beverages. I drink coffee<br/>
and green tea. I don&#39;t drink alcohol.<br/>
<br/>
I was a 15 year vegetarian until 5 years ago. When I reinstituted meat I<br/>
expected to notice some difference in my health. I didn&#39;t, with the<br/>
exception of becoming lactose intolerant a couple of years later, something<br/>
that would have caused me some problems of variety if I were still vegie.<br/>
Cheese particularly had been a major feature of my diet while vegetarian. My<br/>
doctor said &quot;take calcium&quot; and recommended the soft chew kind which I take<br/>
daily. When I remember I take a multivitamin and extra Folic acid, just in<br/>
case. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a very good cook, as I finally had to admit. For years I thought of<br/>
my cooking as quirky but delicious. Eventually I learnt to my dismay that<br/>
*I* was the only person who actually liked my thrown together odd<br/>
concoctions. Now I stick to really simple cooking for my family, or<br/>
carefully following a recipe. I enjoy baking, and will make muffins or<br/>
something like that if I need to take something for a crowd - but I don&#39;t<br/>
fool around with the recipes because that leads to disasters. I stick to<br/>
tried and true most of time.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that answers the query OK.<br/>
