<div id="ygrps-yiv-656754704">My sister took Spanish so I learned to say, &quot;Esta Susanna is la cocina? <br/>
Si, Susanna esta in la cocina..&quot; <br/>
<br/>
What you tried to say turned out something like: Is Susanna the Kitchen? <br/>
Hehe<br/>
What you wanted to say was &quot;Esta Susanna en la cocina?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Si, Susanna esta en la cocina&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is no &quot;is&quot; or &quot;in&quot;...what you wanted was &quot;es&quot; or &quot;en&quot;...close, but not quite there.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to my lanugage experience.<br/>
I took a year of Spanish in HS, a semester in Jr.High....couldn&#39;t remember much of anything, but the Spanish language I pick up fairly easy.  We spent a week in Mexico and I remembered and used more Spanish than I ever did in class..cool!<br/>
Now I own a couple of Spanish programs that I find useful when I feel like using them (course, they&#39;re speaking to you in Spanish throughout, so it&#39;s similar to immersion.<br/>
I&#39;ve found that I can learn a Spanish song fairly quick, I sing them to the kids. Music is a fantastic way to learn parts of a lanuage.<br/>
<br/>
Immersion is definitely the only way to go!!<br/>

Here&#39;s the &quot;Straight Dope&quot; on the song. Actually he doesn&#39;t do much better<br/>
on the lyrics but if you type cucaracha lyrics into Google, you&#39;ll get lots<br/>
of hits.<br/>

Dear Cecil:<br/>
<br/>
What are the words to the song &quot;La Cucaracha&quot;? Every person I asked at<br/>
school didn&#39;t know beyond the title. Even my parents did not know. I am<br/>
using my parents&#39; E-mail to ask you. --Liz Dear Liz:<br/>
<br/>
Happy to oblige, kiddo, but some people aren&#39;t going to be pleased. &quot;La<br/>
Cucaracha,&quot; one of Mexico&#39;s best-known folk songs, doesn&#39;t put the ideal<br/>
spin on life south of the border. The U.S. may have amber waves of grain;<br/>
the UK has jolly jolly sixpence; Mexico has . . . cockroaches. The Mexican<br/>
Tourism Board can only hope monolingual Yankees don&#39;t realize what the title<br/>
means. As possible evidence on this score I note that in Minneapolis, the<br/>
Kyoto of midwestern culture, La Cucaracha is the name of a restaurant.<br/>
Somebody really ought to clue these people in. <br/>
<br/>
But you wanted the lyrics. One complication is that there are about five<br/>
million verses, many of them proof of how creative you can get on a couple<br/>
quarts of Dos Equis at three o&#39;clock in the morning. Here are the two most<br/>
commonly quoted: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
La cucaracha, la cucaracha<br/>
Ya no puede caminar<br/>
Porque no tiene, porque le falta<br/>
Marijuana que fumar.  <br/>
<br/>
(The cockroach, the cockroach<br/>
Now he can&#39;t go traveling<br/>
Because he doesn&#39;t have, because he lacks<br/>
Marijuana to smoke.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can see how closer acquaintance with the lyrics does not improve the PR<br/>
situation. Sometimes the last line is replaced with a bowdlerization such as<br/>
limonada que tomar (lemonade to drink), but if you&#39;re old enough to be<br/>
messing with dad&#39;s E-mail program, you&#39;re old enough to know the truth. <br/>
<br/>
To continue: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ya la murio la cucaracha<br/>
Ya la lleven a enterrar<br/>
Entre cuatro zopilotes<br/>
Y un raton de sacristan.  <br/>
<br/>
(The cockroach just died<br/>
And they carried him off to bury him<br/>
Among four buzzards<br/>
And the sexton&#39;s mouse.) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re thinking: Mexicans are strange. But there&#39;s more going on here than<br/>
meets the eye. &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; is the Spanish equivalent of &quot;Yankee<br/>
Doodle&quot;--a traditional satirical tune periodically fitted out with new<br/>
lyrics to meet the needs of the moment. The origins of the song are obscure,<br/>
but apparently it&#39;s pretty old. Some verses I came across refer to the<br/>
Moorish wars in Spain, which concluded with the conquest of the Moorish<br/>
kingdom of Granada by Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492. (Obviously 1492 was a<br/>
big year for Ferdinand and Isabella on a number of fronts.) Probably the<br/>
song itself doesn&#39;t go back that far, but in an 1818 book, according to one<br/>
source, the Mexican writer Jose Joaquin Fernandez de Lizardi claimed the<br/>
song was brought to Mexico from Spain by a captain of marines. <br/>
<br/>
One can find &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; lyrics commemorating 19th-century conflicts in<br/>
both Spain and Mexico, but verse production didn&#39;t really get rocking until<br/>
the Mexican revolution of 1910-1920. So many stanzas were added by partisans<br/>
on all sides during this period that today, despite its Spanish origin, the<br/>
song is associated mostly with Mexico. <br/>
<br/>
Included among the new lyrics were the verses quoted above. Some say the<br/>
jape about marijuana was directed at the dictatorial Mexican president<br/>
Victoriano Huerta (ruled 1913-1914), ridiculed by his many enemies as a<br/>
drunk and dope fiend who lived only for his daily weed. No doubt the four<br/>
buzzards and the sexton&#39;s mouse were lampoons as well. <br/>
<br/>
Some claim la cucaracha refers solely to Pancho Villa, the<br/>
bandido/revolutionary general who eluded U.S. troops following a 1916 attack<br/>
on an American border town, only to be assassinated in 1923. Others say the<br/>
word refers solely to Villa&#39;s car or to the soldaderas, female soldiers/camp<br/>
followers who provided cooking and other comforts to the various armies.<br/>
These claims are undoubtedly false--the identity of the cockroach varied<br/>
with the verse--but still, one shudders. If no one knows the verses to &quot;La<br/>
Cucaracha,&quot; it&#39;s probably just as well.<br/>

I meant the words to the song I learned. I know all that other stuff and<br/>
never heard those words or that story before. I had spanish in elementary<br/>
school and just don&#39;t know where my teachers found this particular song.<br/>
Just bugs me (no pun intended) that I can&#39;t remember that second line!<br/>

<br/>
What you tried to say turned out something like: Is Susanna the Kitchen?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And at first glance  thought &quot;cochina,&quot; since there was no preposition and I <br/>
thought maybe it was an error of la for un.  It was just about as close to &quot;Is <br/>
Susanna a pig?&quot; until I saw the response, that she was en la cocina.  Though <br/>
a pig could be in the kitchen too.<br/>
<br/>
I have had a hard time getting other languages.  I can read French better <br/>
than I can understand it spoken.   I know more Spanish from conversation and the <br/>
radio than I learned in class.  In class I learned to fear verbs.  It&#39;s pretty <br/>
common in Northern New Mexico to have a conversation in which one person is <br/>
speaking Spanish and the other speaking English.  Lots of people both <br/>
directions can understand what they can&#39;t speak in return.  So several times someone <br/>
would ask me for directions or assistance, or a grandmother would ask me where <br/>
something was in the store, and I could help without knowing how to say it in <br/>
Spanish.<br/>
