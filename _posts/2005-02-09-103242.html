<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826850867">I was thinking about this past thread, I think on this list...<br/>
<br/>
Many kids, lucky kids, are taught by their parents to show respect in a <br/>
multitude of ways.  They show it with body language, with tone, with eye <br/>
contact, with words, they don&#39;t need to use yes ma&#39;m.<br/>
<br/>
However, there are children out there who have not had that upbringing.  <br/>
To them, learning to use &quot;yes ma&#39;m&quot; (or sir) is huge.  It&#39;s not really <br/>
about respect, but instead it&#39;s a cue, a hint, that helps them get into <br/>
the mode...oh, this is authority, I need to respect that, to show that <br/>
respect with my body, my tone, my eye contact.  This concept has to be <br/>
taught to these poverty kids, it&#39;s not taught at home, and in most cases <br/>
it&#39;s a more valuable skill than reading or math.  I have students who <br/>
don&#39;t know when to stop arguing, stop talking.  I can cue them into <br/>
saying &quot;yes ma&#39;m&quot; and this can make the difference.  Kids get shot, <br/>
jailed, because they don&#39;t know how to show respect, and these simple <br/>
words can really help...<br/>
<br/>
For many of our kids, they are an extra.  For some kids, they are vital. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-745765243">I saw on CNN this morning that a girl got scalped for showing<br/>
disrespect towards women.  I didn&#39;t hear the whole story so I<br/>
don&#39;t know who did that to her.  But who is anyone to judge how<br/>
someone else is respectful or not?  <br/>
<br/>
My 7 yo dd was the one who didn&#39;t say &quot;yes ma&#39;m&quot; to her horse<br/>
trainer and the trainer had &quot;never been so disrespected.&quot;  Oh,<br/>
but my dd was so respected by being called names by her?  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the simple words can really help in some situations,<br/>
as you said.  It can&#39;t<br/>
be applied globally to all situations.  Had my daughter been<br/>
(barf)respectful in the trainer&#39;s eyes, I would have been real<br/>
worried about her self esteem.  It would have been an acceptance<br/>
that it&#39;s ok for her to be called names.  That could lead to a life<br/>
long acceptance of abuse.  It wouldn&#39;t be OK for her future husband<br/>
to call her names, etc.  The &quot;disrespected-ness&quot; that the trainer<br/>
felt, I am sure, is really more just being embarassed because she<br/>
was outclassed by a 7 yo girl.  That is the way dh and I see it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you have to stand up for yourself and take the road<br/>
less traveled.  I am glad my dd did.  Sometimes instead of saying<br/>
&quot;yes ma&#39;m&quot;, it is a necessity to say &quot;no, I don&#39;t agree with you&quot;<br/>
and walk away.  Now let&#39;s talk about freedom of speech ;0) krista<br/>

<br/>
Howard Gardner says interpersonal skills are an intelligence as distinct as <br/>
musical, mathematical, verbal or mathematical intelligence.   Some parents <br/>
could not begin to teach their children a thin about tone or body language.  Some <br/>
kids are born knowing.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Do you think they&#39;re poor because their parents are disrespectful of other <br/>
people and so aren&#39;t good at it (naturally? by training?).   Do you think <br/>
poverty keeps parents from caring about courtesy?  Do you think all rich kids have <br/>
good manners?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I bet that&#39;s true.  I bet some kids who have no social skills naturally <br/>
really like to have a kind of checklist of things they might do to seem more &quot;with <br/>
it,&quot; and if they can think about why and when and to whom to show deference, <br/>
they can maybe start to figure out other social realities.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Marshall Rosenberg talks about this in his writings on Nonviolent <br/>
Communication (NVC) -- very much a wake-up call for me who was <br/>
raised not only in the Deep South, but by depression-era parents to <br/>
whom the phrases, &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am&quot; and &quot;No, sir,&quot; were as natural as <br/>
breathing.  They expected no less from their offspring.  <br/>
<br/>
I never gave it a second thought until I started raising a family of <br/>
my own and one of my kids not only left off the niceties during a <br/>
phone conversation, but kept repeated &quot;Yeah&quot; and &quot;Uh huh&quot; to every <br/>
question until I wondered if my parents were sure this homeschooling <br/>
stuff would be their undoing.  They never commented on it to me, but <br/>
they&#39;ve always been the type to live and let live -- they raised us <br/>
the way they saw fit and our kids are our business.  I expect no <br/>
less from others.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

&gt; but my dd was so respected by being called names by her?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As I was saying, Marshall talks about the right/wrong mentality in <br/>
his work, and for a Southern gal brought up in a Christian home -- <br/>
this is a whole new concept to me.  Not only in the way that the <br/>
trainer treated your daughter, but in the way that dd responded.  I <br/>
was inclined to agree with you as one who prides herself in <br/>
encouraging the kids to be independent thinkers who take no guff <br/>
from anybody.  Then I came across this passage in an NVC book called <br/>
the &quot;Compassionate Classroom&quot; (sounds kinda schoolish, but Marshall <br/>
Rosenberg was well-acquainted with John Holt and his work.)  It <br/>
reminded me of this thread, so I was intrigued to see that it was <br/>
right up front when I came looking for it.  Here&#39;s the excerpt:<br/>
<br/>
-=- For example:  A teacher says to a student, &quot;I think you&#39;re just <br/>
being lazy by not finishing your work.&quot;  The child replies, &quot;You&#39;re <br/>
mean!&quot;  This defensive response is the only way this child has <br/>
learned to deal with the pain of unmet needs for respect and <br/>
understanding.  His response is not likely to meet his needs; in <br/>
fact, the teacher may give him a trip to the principal&#39;s office or <br/>
something else that addes to his pain.  If, instead of name calling, <br/>
the child [and/or trainer, as the case may be] has learned to <br/>
identify his needs for understanding and respect, he will probably <br/>
find ways to respond that are much more satisfying to him and to the <br/>
teacher.<br/>
<br/>
If, in the first place, the teacher had been aware of his own needs -<br/>
- perhaps to understand what is really going on with this student -- <br/>
he could have expressed his feelings and needs something like this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When I see that your project isn&#39;t finished on the day you said it <br/>
would be, and I see you working on something else, I&#39;m puzzled.  I <br/>
would like to understand what stopeed you from completing your first <br/>
project?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When teachers [trainers, parents, etc.] learn to identify their own <br/>
needs, they are empowered to act in ways that are satisfying to <br/>
them.  When teachers learn to identify the needs of their students, <br/>
they are empowered to contribute to their well-being.  And, whether <br/>
teachers realize it or not, the behavior they model to students is <br/>
the behavior that students model in relationship to each other.  The <br/>
result is that when teachers pay attention to the needs of students, <br/>
students start paying attention to the needs of each other, and this <br/>
is the beginning of a truly cooperative, compassionate learning <br/>
environment. <br/>
<br/>
If an entire society of people learned to pay attention to their own <br/>
needs as well as the needs of others, we would be on our way to <br/>
creating a world that has the potential to work for everyone. [End <br/>
excerpt.] -=-<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe the simple words can really help in some situations,<br/>

&gt; was outclassed by a 7 yo girl.  That is the way dh and I see it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, I believe that Marshall would agree that the trainer was <br/>
definitely embarrassed, and so was your daughter amongst other <br/>
things, like intense frustration and disappointment.  Does that <br/>
sound right?  The whole exchange was what Marshall calls a &quot;tragic <br/>
expression of unmet needs.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
The trainer doesn&#39;t sound like she&#39;s up to learning new tricks, but <br/>
I could be wrong.  The beauty of NVC is that it only takes one <br/>
person to make a difference, and the language is very empowering to <br/>
people of all ages, from what I&#39;ve observed (No ma&#39;ams or sirs <br/>
required.)  As I&#39;ve said before, I discovered a reference to <br/>
Nonviolent Communication in an archived article at Mothering.com and <br/>
googled it to find the Center <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnvc.org">http://www.cnvc.org</a> -- There&#39;s a <br/>
wealth of information on their website if anyone&#39;s interested in <br/>
checking it out.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Marshall works with warring factions all over the world, and manages <br/>
to show them that it&#39;s not really necessary to agree to disagree, <br/>
walk away, or even kill somebody to meet their needs.  He tells the <br/>
story of talking to a group of Palestinian Moslems in a refugee <br/>
camp -- they found out he was American and things got a little <br/>
heated as you can imagine.  There&#39;s a surprise ending which shows <br/>
the power of words to make a difference in the first chapter of his <br/>
book, which is online at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnvc.org/bookchap.htm">http://www.cnvc.org/bookchap.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, we came across the beginnings of this thread <br/>
after visiting our local stables for the first time back a couple of <br/>
weeks or so.  The manager was getting on to a young rider in the <br/>
typical fashion, telling her not to kick the horse, to do it <br/>
the &quot;right&quot; way, carrying on & on in between wrapping up our <br/>
conversation, and finally hollered out, where are your shoes?!  The <br/>
kid smiled a sheepish grin and rode on in her sock feet and I <br/>
realized this one belonged to the manager.  She confirmed that it <br/>
was her own child ignoring her admonitions.  I thought twice about <br/>
getting into that kind of situation even before I saw this thread <br/>
crop up... I would be very interested to hear what others think <br/>
about this compassionate way of interacting with others.<br/>

We have not found another trainer yet, we were gone last<br/>
week.  We did stop by a stable on vacation though, just <br/>
to see the operation.  Wow.....what a huge difference in <br/>
the way the operation is run compared to what the kids were<br/>
doing here.  We will be looking into a new trainer.  Have<br/>
not heard from the barn owner here either, and really don&#39;t<br/>
want to get into it w/her(we did leave a message).  Someone here <br/>
said they didn&#39;t <br/>
know what they were missing before switching barns.  I have<br/>
a feeling we&#39;ll be in for the same revelation :0) I really do<br/>
