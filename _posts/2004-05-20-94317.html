&lt;&lt; Speaking from experience, I think that when you adopt an older <br/>
(non-infant) <br/>
child it would be easier if you have already been through that age with <br/>
your own biological child.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What about an infant child if you&#39;ve never had an infant?<br/>
<br/>
When someone is barren (for whatever combo of reasons, so I&#39;m including the <br/>
husband in the equation) and adopts, that can be the best thing in the world to <br/>
that point for her, and a baby adopted instead of living in an institution or <br/>
with a family that wishes for all the world she had NOT been born is lucky.<br/>
<br/>
It has occurred to me, though, that that baby will be raised without the <br/>
benefit of maternal instinct having kicked in as part of the package of birthing <br/>
and nursing.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of maternal instinct was flushed down the toilet in the 1950&#39;s and <br/>
continues to be, because mothers don&#39;t nurse, and so they don&#39;t get the prolactin <br/>
and other things we don&#39;t even know about that helps nursing mothers be patient <br/>
and gentle and loving.  But there are hormonal changes from being pregnant <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Some people seem very maternal from childhood.  Maybe it&#39;s an intelligence <br/>
Gardner didn&#39;t care about that some people have even without a prolactin flood <br/>
of reproduction.  <br/>
<br/>
And there are some mothers who seem to receive or perceive NONE of what they <br/>
get, or maybe their endocrine system is faulty and they don&#39;t get any.  It&#39;s a <br/>
new field, and our grandchildren will know much more than we know about it.  <br/>
And I think some of the problems with adoption might be seen in a new light.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing families have in common besides appearance and temperament is <br/>
scent.  There were studies done 30 years ago or so in which children were given <br/>
sealed plastic bags to smell.  Each had a t-shirt that was worn for a play <br/>
session or a day or something.  One was a sibling, the others weren&#39;t.  The kids <br/>
were able to identify their siblings.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember what the explanation was at the time, but I&#39;ve thought of it <br/>
over the years.  I think the children probably smell like the mother.  They <br/>
might not be familiar with siblings by smell (though they might, and I don&#39;t <br/>
remember anything about them trying it with kids who were not biological <br/>
siblings, or who were but weren&#39;t related to the mother--I don&#39;t think it was that <br/>
deep a study, and I don&#39;t think they were considering genetics or mothers, just <br/>
proximity).   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to make a profound point with that, just chucking out a little <br/>
more odd data.  <br/>
<br/>
Life&#39;s not ever going to be perfect, but if by any sharing of ideas we can <br/>
make individual lives a little better, or give people more to think about, then <br/>
it&#39;s worth sharing.<br/>

would make these mad, half awake dashes through the house and come to my<br/>

She asked what I was afraid of.  <br/>
I said &quot;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll forget to feed him.&quot;<br/>

She laughed and said &quot;You won&#39;t forget to feed him.&quot;  <br/>

Every mother, hormones or not, feels like that.  It&#39;s the introduction<br/>
of a stranger into your life, whether or not you birthed said<br/>
stranger--and the stranger is demanding, sleeps on a weird schedule,<br/>
and doesn&#39;t speak the language; you&#39;re sleep deprived, and adjusting,<br/>
and you know you&#39;ve been charged with the care of this fragile little<br/>
being for the rest of your or its natural life (whichever shall come<br/>
first) . . .  <br/>
Any woman who tells you that hormones made it so she didn&#39;t panic and<br/>
think she was going to lose the baby, is lying through her teeth.<br/>
It&#39;s not weird--it&#39;s just being a mom.<br/>

 <br/>
****<br/>
 <br/>
Some adoptive Moms do nurse their babies successfully.  I know two women who were adopted and breastfed by their adoptive Moms. <br/>
 <br/>
I think the smell thing would have to be that children smell like their mother. I&#39;ve noticed in friend&#39;s babies that the baby definitely smells like Mom, and I&#39;ve had at least one friend tell me my baby smelled like me.  Of course, my sense of smell is overly sensitive, so that may be part of it for me.  <br/>
 <br/>
It also makes sense in that we&#39;re mammals, and the way a mama in the wild knows which ones are hers is by their scent.  I think sniffing our children&#39;s heads is a leftover, primitive urge, a way to re-connect and stimulate the mother hormones that impel us to protect and love our young at all costs.  Unfortunately, that instinct gets lost amont the aroma of babywash, baby lotion, perfumed diapers and other products meant to make babies smell &#39;sweet&#39; and sterile.  Disposable diapers have the most cloying odor to them, it just overwhelms everything else.  I was amazed at how much better (and truer) my youngest smelled -- how much better our home smelled.  I&#39;m convinced it was because we used cloth diapers with him.  Over the generations, we&#39;ve become programmed to different smells in our environment, and I think they overcome our more natural impulses. <br/>

nurse their adopted baby and it seems they both are experiencing something I <br/>
think ALL mother&#39;s of adopted infants should try.  I know there are <br/>
difficulties and they both have told me that it is hard but neither have ever expressed <br/>
negative feelings, one is having to supplement a lot as she has never had a <br/>
baby and her production is low but the other is down to 2 small supplements per <br/>
day.  It is amazing.  I know nothing about all this adoption stuff but the <br/>
topic is interesting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296560737">Or maybe it was your maternal instinct kicking -- that&#39;s a common theme in the dreams first-time pregnant women.  I remember waking in a cold sweat because I&#39;d left the baby somewhere -- only I could not remember whether my baby was a boy or girl so I had no idea how I would find him/her!

<div id="ygrps-yiv-508544198">Funny thing, I never really noticed a different smell from our adopted kids, <br/>
but my (then) 16 yo daughter told me they have a distinctly different smell <br/>
(said privately, not in a mean way.)  The only smell I ever noticed was a sweaty <br/>
one, after a long day of playing in the heat.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a trick some shepherds do with ewes who have had a lamb born dead.  <br/>
They will skin the dead lamb and tie the skin to an orphaned lamb, then give it <br/>
to the sheep who lost the baby.  Reading it on paper sounds awful, but it&#39;s <br/>
really a great thing...Ewe gets a baby, baby gets a mom to nurse and protect <br/>
it, and the shepherd doesn&#39;t have to bottle feed a lamb 4 times a day!!<br/>

I think what you describe is such a common feeling among mothers.  If you<br/>
speak with moms who can be honest (something that sometimes is hard to come<br/>
by), you&#39;ll find that there are so many who have felt the same.  So many<br/>
don&#39;t bond in that romantic immediate way we hear about.  For some it takes<br/>
weeks or months.<br/>
<br/>
I remember asking our pediatrician  if it was normal to feel such high<br/>
anxiety.  I was just so worried something would bad would happen.  When he<br/>
asked some months later, I had forgotten all about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629598033">&lt;&lt;&lt;Another thing families have in common besides appearance and<br/>
temperament is <br/>
scent.  There were studies done 30 years ago or so in which children<br/>
were given <br/>
sealed plastic bags to smell.  Each had a t-shirt that was worn for a<br/>
play <br/>
session or a day or something.  One was a sibling, the others weren&#39;t.<br/>
The kids <br/>
were able to identify their siblings.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember what the explanation was at the time, but I&#39;ve thought<br/>
of it <br/>
over the years.  I think the children probably smell like the<br/>
mother.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
There is evidence that there is a relationship between a person&#39;s scent<br/>
and the HLA gene, which expresses a protein that is present on virtually<br/>
all cells of the body.  HLA is unique to an individual, and it is<br/>
largely responsible for graft vs. host disease in organ transplants.  It<br/>
is basically the protein on the cell that identifies it to your immune<br/>
system as &quot;self&quot;.  That&#39;s why transplants are rejected-the host doesn&#39;t<br/>
recognize the HLA on the transplanted organ.  If HLA and scent are<br/>
related, it follows that children will smell more like their parents<br/>
than other adults, and that siblings will smell more like each other<br/>
than other children.  <br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s the really neat stuff though:  In one study, college age women<br/>
were asked to smell the t-shirts of various men and rate the<br/>
&quot;attractiveness&quot; of the smell.  The women were the most attracted to the<br/>
t-shirts of the men whose HLA was the most *different* from their own.<br/>
In other words, when choosing mates, we are attracted to those who are<br/>
genetically different from ourselves.  That&#39;s a good thing for the sake<br/>
of maintaining high genetic diversity in a population and for producing<br/>
offspring with good genetic diversity, which increases their ability to<br/>
adapt to their environment.   This same phenomenon has also been shown<br/>
in mice.<br/>
 <br/>
            But the really cool thing is that when women/female mice are<br/>
pregnant or nursing (or on the pill, which simulates pregnancy), their<br/>
attraction to others switches from those whose HLA is the most different<br/>
to those whose HLA is the most SIMILAR!  This also makes good sense for<br/>
survival, for it&#39;s definitely in the best interest of the babies for the<br/>
mother to be attracted to their scent.  The female mice also prefer the<br/>
company of their own siblings, which are the babies&#39; aunts and uncles,<br/>
who are likely to help care for them.  This is bad news for the poor<br/>
dads, however :;  Luckily it switches back when the mother starts to<br/>
ovulate again.<br/>
 <br/>
The authors of these studies have even gone so far as to suggest that<br/>
the pill can cause relationship problems because a woman will be<br/>
attracted to a man with similar HLA while on the pill, then she&#39;ll go<br/>
off the pill and discover that she&#39;s not so attracted to him any more!<br/>
 <br/>
Pretty neat stuff.<br/>

Every mother, hormones or not, feels like that.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe this is true.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Any woman who tells you that hormones made it so she didn&#39;t panic and<br/>

<br/>
There are flitting thoughts and strange dreams, and then there is true doubt <br/>
and panic.  And some poor moms don&#39;t get either.  They&#39;re over confident or <br/>
under-thoughtful and really DO neglect the baby.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t generalize your own experience or ideas to everyone in such an <br/>
insulting way.  Before I had a baby I wasn&#39;t &quot;a baby person.&quot;  I didn&#39;t much <br/>
like to hold other people&#39;s babies, I wasn&#39;t too interested, I had never liked <br/>
to babysit, etc.  I had no idea how I was going to be patient enough to nurse a <br/>
baby.  A full set of transforming hormones came with the pregnancy and <br/>
childbirth, though, and I went from being a person who couldn&#39;t sit still for ten <br/>
minutes to one who could rock a baby for an hour without feeling anxious or <br/>
restless.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some great moms, some awkward moms and some bad moms.  There are <br/>
factors that make them different.  Some of those factors are biological.<br/>
<br/>
This culture is based on a pack of falsehoods, but one is that humans have no <br/>
instincts.  There are still professors making that statement from time to <br/>
time.  Someone brought it to this list last month.   It&#39;s not true.   It IS true <br/>
that because people have been taught that in school, if they start to feel <br/>
something instinctive coming on, they get nervous, deny it, do the opposite thing <br/>
to prove they&#39;re &quot;smart,&quot; and laugh at other people who are following what <br/>
they just feel they ought to do.<br/>
<br/>
In moving toward natural learning, we really can&#39;t cling to a falsehood like <br/>
&quot;no instinct.&quot;  It will trip us up.  And in discussing issues involving <br/>
parenting and family dynamics, to say that people who report a surprisingly good <br/>
experience are lying doesn&#39;t help anyone in any way.<br/>

  Hormones made it so I didn&#39;t panic and think I was going to lose the baby. Really. I don&#39;t remember panics or nightmares at all. There was the occasional look at the babys chest to make sure it was still breathing but nursing blissed me out and eliminated stress. I would never have understood before I nursed but the effect it had on me was enourmous and really powerful. Hormones were a happy drug that kept me on an even keel and reasonably confident for the first little while after my baby came home. And I&#39;m not lying through my teeth.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Same here. Babies were ugly, dull little things. And up to the very moment I first nursed Catherine I thought breastfeeding was repulsive and something that should be done in private (thankfully my mother let me know formula was not an option and I was still to listening to her too much :) ). About 2 minutes later my whole opinion (along with a rather negative view of my body) had shifted. I know women for whom hormones seemed to have little to no effect but there are many of us who were remade by them. In a very good way.<br/>

&gt; -PJ<br/>
 </span></blockquote>=================================================<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, this is so far from the truth of my experience that I felt the<br/>
need to respond even though several others have already done so.<br/>
<br/>
When I was pregnant for the first time, I knew I would nurse and have the<br/>
baby room in with me at the hospital to establish good nursing, but I<br/>
*never* planned to allow the baby to sleep in dh&#39;s and my room. Marital<br/>
space is so important, yadda, yadda. Well, once I had my first baby, there<br/>
was no way she was leaving my arms, and my other babies were no different<br/>
other than the fact that my youngest was 5+ weeks premature and had to go to<br/>
the NICU, which wrenched me in ways I can&#39;t even begin to describe.<br/>
<br/>
I slept with two dd&#39;s at the hospital even though I wasn&#39;t supposed to. I<br/>
slept lightly enough that when a nurse would walk in, I could open my eyes<br/>
and tell her that I wasn&#39;t sleeping, so back off. When I came home with my<br/>
first, I balled at the thought of her sleeping in the nursery I&#39;d so<br/>
lovingly created and begged dh to let her sleep with us &quot;for just a couple<br/>
of weeks.&quot; Dh deferred to me and that was the beginning of the family bed<br/>
for us.<br/>
<br/>
There was no possible way for me to mother any differently than the way I<br/>
did--nursing on demand, carrying baby constantly, sleeping with baby--it was<br/>
hormonally-driven instinct that I didn&#39;t predict and couldn&#39;t have changed<br/>
willingly. Yes, it was scary bringing a baby home the first time, but as<br/>
long as that baby was touching me, everything was fine. It drove me nuts<br/>
that mil kept wanting to take the baby so I could &quot;get some rest.&quot; That<br/>
didn&#39;t go over well at all, and I&#39;m sure that was the beginning of the<br/>
tension between the two of us now.  I slept well (and so did dh) because the<br/>
baby was right there to nurse without either of us having to wake up--we<br/>
could never understand people talking about sleep deprivation although our<br/>
children didn&#39;t sleep through the night until they were nearly a year old.<br/>
The schedule wasn&#39;t weird because we were together--she was a part of my<br/>
world and I was a part of her world. I didn&#39;t have to get home for feedings<br/>
or naps or anything--we were almost as symbiotic as when she was in the<br/>
womb. People call this attachment parenting, but for me it was simply<br/>
mothering. There was an immediate, overwhelming, undeniable bond between<br/>
myself and my babies, and to this day, one of my biggest regrets with my ds<br/>
is that we missed out on much of the early bonding because he was whisked<br/>
away to the NICU (which is it&#39;s very own attachment story that I won&#39;t go<br/>
into here).<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With my first child I spent almost the entire pregnancy scared to death that <br/>
my baby would not like me, or I wouldn&#39;t like her and neither of us would be <br/>
able to help it.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds so stupid, but my mothers famous line, was &quot;it&#39;s not MY fault I could <br/>
never love you&quot;.  So, never having been drawn to hold babies or coo over them, <br/>
I really had no interest in them. <br/>
<br/>
 Medically I was supposed to not be able to have children.  Secretly I wasn&#39;t <br/>
too upset about it.  At my preop visit for a surgery to &quot;possibly&quot; make it <br/>
possible to get pregnant I found out I WAS pregnant.  I admit I was just sorta <br/>
going along with the program to please DH and let him think I&#39;d done all I <br/>
could do to provide him with a family that he wanted, while secretly thinking it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be so bad without children.<br/>
<br/>
Up until the moment I pushed her out, I was still afraid that for some reason <br/>
I would be unable to love my own child.  I asked my DH if I didn&#39;t love her <br/>
would he just take her away and divorce me and raise her.  He thought it was <br/>
the &quot;drugs&quot; talking.  It was the fear of being like my mother.<br/>
<br/>
I gave birth, she was taken to the nursery and I was sent to recovery for a <br/>
short time, then I got to hold my baby.  Taking a deep breath, I took her and <br/>
looked into her face and as she snuggled against my chest, her head turned <br/>
towards my breast and she began to try to nurse.  At that moment I feel INSTANTLY <br/>
and deeply in love with her.  <br/>
<br/>
My experience was mostly the same for my sons.  My next daughter, six weeks <br/>
early, was not the same.  Possibly after reading Danielle&#39;s note I might have <br/>
made a connection.  Cait was sent to the NICU right away.  It took months for <br/>
me to form any bond with her.  I cried because I couldn&#39;t.  Nursing was very <br/>
difficult.  I met her needs but didn&#39;t feel that &quot;I never want to put her down&quot; <br/>
feeling I&#39;d had with the others.  The only child I needed a lactation <br/>
consultant for and this was child number four.  I felt like a failure.  Looking back I <br/>
think if I&#39;d had that experience with my first child, I probably wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have had five.  <br/>
<br/>
To tell the absolute truth I think that firm deep bonding with Cait didn&#39;t <br/>
happen until after she left school for good and we could spend hours together <br/>
just doing nothing.  For the most part the other kids were already up and out of <br/>
the house by then.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still embarrassed because of it, I wish it could have been different.  I <br/>
wasn&#39;t neglectful in anyway to her but just was detached.  I think she felt <br/>
the same way, she wanted to be fed, wrapped and put down.  She didn&#39;t like being <br/>
held, she didn&#39;t like being cuddled.  To this day you cannot hug her without <br/>
her saying, &quot; I want a hug&quot; first.  She doesn&#39;t like being touched.  So maybe <br/>
it was part both of us. It was several days before I even got to hold her or <br/>
touch her.  Maybe those first minutes and hours are the most important time.<br/>
<br/>
I know every child is different but maybe that initial separation was <br/>
damaging to both of us, very deeply.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s still sad to me that I missed all that newborn loving and cuddling and <br/>
loving time with her.<br/>

LOL!!  <br/>
<br/>
Before my first was born, I had a very vivid dream that bad men in black <br/>
suits with guns burst into our apartment and demanded the baby.  I told them they <br/>
weren&#39;t getting it, and I&#39;d die first.  Wierd thing was, the baby started as a <br/>
baby in the dream but then turned into a swordfish...I kept her in a tank <br/>
next to the bed!  I kept shielding the tank with my body.  I actually woke from <br/>
that dream crying...I&#39;ve never forgotten it either!  I can still picture the <br/>
whole thing.  I wonder if it has some deep meaning??......<br/>

With my first pregnancy, I had a recurring dream that I put my baby <br/>
in the refrigerator in one of those plastic take-out boxes, in order <br/>
to keep him &quot;fresh.&quot;  If I remember correctly, he was even lying on a <br/>
little bed of lettuce.<br/>

being part of a split personality with the birthmother .....and I think if<br/>
you are going to be a good adoptive mom, you better get used to it and learn<br/>
how to share, for lack of a better word.<br/>

Hi,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
my &#39;lose the baby&#39; version of the dream was --I&#39;d wake up middle of the night, wildly pulling the sheets (and husband off the bed, while frantically telling him I&#39;d lost the baby in the sheets)  This happened a few times after we brought her home from where the biological mom gave birth to her.  My husband said he argued with me a few times that we didn&#39;t even have the baby in bed with us, but I was so asleep I didn&#39;t wake up, or acknowledge his presence.  Finally, one night he said, &#39;here she is; I found her--now lets go to sleep&#39;  and I never dreamt it after that.<br/>
<br/>
I had the dream once with my 2nd daughter; but because of some health related problems she had, I guess I woke up too much to dream too often.<br/>
<br/>
