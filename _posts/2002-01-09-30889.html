&gt; Many public schools participate in a program &quot;Flat Stanley.&quot;  It is<br/>
&gt; based on Jeff Brown&#39;s book &quot;Flat Stanley.&quot;  In the book, Stanley<br/>
&gt; is &quot;flattened&quot; by a falling bulletin board. One of the many<br/>
&gt; advantages to being flat, is Stanley is now able to visit his friends<br/>
&gt; by traveling in an envelope.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We wanted to do something similar for our Homeschooling Families!<br/>
&gt; Our Flat Travelers project is very simple.  Your family or homeschool<br/>
&gt; makes a paper Flat Traveler and mails it, along with a blank journal,<br/>
&gt; to someone on the &quot;List of Participants&quot; or to a celebrity or<br/>
&gt; politician.  The recipient treats the visiting Traveler as a guest<br/>
&gt; and takes it places.  After a week your Traveler is mailed back with<br/>
&gt; a completed journal and perhaps some photographs, post cards, and<br/>
&gt; souvenirs.  You read about what your Flat Traveler has done, where<br/>
&gt; he/she has been and plot his/her travels on a map.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not only is it a great way to learn geography, but it&#39;s really FUN<br/>
&gt; too!  What we need right now is for you to join the group.  We&#39;re<br/>
&gt; just starting out, and we need families from around the world who<br/>
&gt; would like to participate.  Please feel free to forward this message<br/>
&gt; to anyone you think might be interested.<br/>
