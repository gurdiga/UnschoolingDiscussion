<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412289590">I cannot believe this, but Michael and Debi Pearl,<br/>
authors of To Train Up a Child will be speaking in<br/>
town this Sunday!  I&#39;m outraged, but what can I do? <br/>
I&#39;ve already spoken with the pastor of the church<br/>
where the seminar will take place- who himself spanks<br/>
and follows the Pearls advice.  So, that did no good. <br/>
Any advice?<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some interesting anti-Pearl stuff online at<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-548274838">I don&#39;t even live there and when I found out from another site they  would be <br/>
there, I wrote to the church and included excerpts from the book. I  never <br/>
heard back from them. If I lived there I would definitely protest the day  they <br/>
are there. _www.nospank.net_ (http://www.nospank.net)  will send  you <br/>
stickers, flyers, bumper stickers, and more if you ask them. Let them know  what you <br/>
want to do with them. You could even put the literature on cars in the  parking <br/>
lot. I hope they come here someday.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It seems to me that there&#39;s two strategies, based on the goals you have<br/>
for any action you take.<br/>
<br/>
1.  If you just have to express your outrage, go to the event and make a<br/>
stink!  Take a sign, try to get some protesters at the door, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
2.  If you&#39;re primarily concerned with preventing people who are still<br/>
open to other parenting ideas from going down the Pearl&#39;s path... <br/>
Attend the presentation.  When given the opportunity, ask questions that<br/>
make clear your objections and horror at what they&#39;re advocating.  If<br/>
you can find somewhere close by that you could bring a group of people, <br/>
announce to the audience (during one of your questions?) that you would<br/>
like to facilitate a discussion after the event presenting alternative<br/>
views for people who are being made uncomfortable by the level of<br/>
cruelty espoused by the Pearls.  Maybe try to have a xeroxed handout<br/>
with some discussion (or links/references to discussion) about the<br/>
damage that such a parenting method can cause.  At all times try as hard<br/>
as you can to imagine how someone might be attracted to the Pearls, and<br/>
try in your tone and attitude to convey that you can empathize with<br/>
their goals (raising their children to be the best people they can be),<br/>
but cannot remain silent given your strong moral problems with the child<br/>
abuse being advocated, and your understanding that the abuse will not<br/>
achieve those goals.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to convince someone of something it&#39;s many times harder if<br/>
they feel completely under attack, and that you view them as evil.  I&#39;m<br/>
not saying you have to be appeasing, or pretend that you don&#39;t find<br/>
their *actions* evil.  But they have to feel that you can understand<br/>
them, and see their actions in the light of their best possible<br/>
motivations.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836098185">Organize a protest? call local news stations and see if any of them <br/>
will bite and be willing to show both sides. Good luck. People like <br/>
them just irritate me to no end.<br/>
