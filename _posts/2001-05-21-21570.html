 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Lynda.  I do have a date in June to take it for disposal.  It just<br/>
makes me nervous carrying it sloshing around in the car (on the way to the<br/>
disposal site).  Was wondering if there is any way to make it any safer. <br/>
Dh wanted to just leave it behind in our old garage, and was telling me<br/>
&quot;it&#39;s like carrying dynamite in the car!&quot;   I didn&#39;t know if his fears were<br/>
grounded.  When we move next time, everything will be in a moving van, and<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not safe or legal to transport it in the back of the<br/>
van.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a bil who&#39;s a chemist who makes rocket fuel for a living.  I can<br/>
ask him for safety tips.  (Duh... I tend to run to you guys with every<br/>
question.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Betsy,<br/>
<br/>
Is there a hazardous waste facility in your area?  For instance, my <br/>
husband is VP of a haz waste facility that processes bi-products of <br/>
industry. However, they maintain a Household Hazardous Waste station <br/>
where people can drop off things like kerosene and they&#39;ll dispose of <br/>
it safely.  Check your yellow pages and call around.  Good luck.<br/>
