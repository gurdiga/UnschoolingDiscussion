<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083442857">Well, it started as a feeling of approaching a time when we want a <br/>
change of pace and location. Colorado has been a great place for the <br/>
last decade, but we&#39;re starting to burn out on it. (I have a history of <br/>
moving often, and this is the longest I&#39;ve been anywhere since I left <br/>
home at 18). We are feeling a need to return to city life, having been <br/>
pretty *burbed* out, lol! Originally, we planned to return to New <br/>
Orleans, where I lived for 5 years (and hubby lived with me for <br/>
6+months), but recent developments in crime and drug use (specifically a <br/>
heroin epidemic)have sort of scratched that from the list. <br/>
SO.....Toronto seems to creep up in our lives repeatedly, in the form of <br/>
loving many people (especially comics) from there, seeing scenes in a <br/>
film and saying *ooooh, where&#39;s that?*, and other more random but <br/>
insidious instances. Upon deeper investigation, we find there are <br/>
numerous things about Canadian culture, and Toronto in particualr, that <br/>
interest and intrigue us. It&#39;s a very diverse city, very clean, has a <br/>
comparably low crime rate, good opportunities for hubby&#39;s employment, <br/>
good value for our money, favorable laws with regard to homeschooling, <br/>
non-vaccinizing (I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a word, lol), gun control, <br/>
parental rights, etc, etc. It will of course demand more intensive <br/>
research before a final decision is reached, but I&#39;m psyched to even <br/>
THINK about a nice, emphatic change of lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
Just out of curiosity, are any listers from Toronto or other Canadian <br/>
regions?<br/>

I see :) Ready for some &quot;city life&quot;, eh? Can&#39;t imagine why, but that&#39;s a <br/>

We live in Vaughan, &quot;The City Above Toronto&quot;, as our city slogan <br/>

<br/>
I have been mostly lurking as well.  We started homeschooling just <br/>
this past spring, and the kids (10,8,5) have been very happily <br/>
unschooling since. And I&#39;ve been reading & reading and have come to <br/>
realize that unschooling just makes amazing sense to me. I no longer <br/>
see this time as a &quot;break&quot;. I will not be trying to introduce <br/>
any &quot;educational structure&quot; - they are way too busy learning! Just a <br/>
quick thanks to everyone on this list; it really helps put everything <br/>

Anyway, you&#39;re welcome to contact me if you&#39;re interested in some <br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the response, and yes, I just might write privately for some <br/>
inside into on the area. Enjoy the unschooling; I chose it in much the <br/>
same way. As I researched more and more in prep to homeschool, <br/>
everything I read about unschooling just resonated so deeply, it all <br/>
made sense. Needless to say, the more years we live this way, the more <br/>
convinced we become it was absolutely best choice we could have made.<br/>
