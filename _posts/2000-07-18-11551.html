<div id="ygrps-yiv-700886568">Hi all,<br/>
Just wondering, anyone out there homeschooling a bipolar child, or a really ADHD<br/>
type, or ODD, OCD, Asberger&#39;s Syndrome, or any other sort of really difficult,<br/>
spirited child that is way beyond your average/normal/ wonderful/incredible/<br/>
unique/regular kid? Particularly an older child - like a teen? There are books for<br/>
the younger ones, but I seem to be left high and dry with this age group. Luckily<br/>
he&#39;s mellowed somewhat, but some of the mellowing is depression. He&#39;s particularily<br/>
challenged with oppositionality, and homeschooling has been a lifesaver for him. But<br/>
he is oppositional even to his own goals, and I / we would sure appreciate<br/>
communicating with someone who can relate. Are we all alone here?<br/>
