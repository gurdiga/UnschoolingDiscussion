<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051099118">I don&#39;t post here often - but wanted to pass these numbers on to all <br/>
my lists.  Sorry for cross posting - but I hate this!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From another list - but hope ALL will join in calling!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Missing from the CBS story was that: Social Services <br/>
had contacted<br/>
the family eleven times, were well aware of the <br/>
condition of the home<br/>
and had been working with the family. <br/>
<br/>
However, to any fair-minded reader the story leaves <br/>
the impression<br/>
that homeschooling equals child abuse. <br/>
<br/>
We are outraged that CBS would ignore the obvious <br/>
facts and draw the<br/>
erroneous conclusion that homeschoolers need to be <br/>
strictly<br/>
regulated.  The story is a shameless attempt to smear <br/>
an entire<br/>
community of committed, dedicated parents.<br/>
<br/>
The real story is CBS&#39;s bias against homeschooling and <br/>
it is using<br/>
this distorted story to encourage the regulation of <br/>
homeschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
Please call Viacom (parent company of CBS) and CBS to <br/>
express your<br/>
opposition to the biased reporting and smear campaign <br/>
against<br/>
homeschooling.  Highlight the fact that homeschooling <br/>
was not the<br/>
cause of the childrens&#39; deaths and that you expect CBS <br/>
to have higher<br/>
journalistic standards. <br/>

<br/>
Otherwise, the History of US series by Joy Hakim is the best there is,  <br/>
imo.<br/>
Book 8 is called &quot;War, Terrible War&quot; and it covers the American Civil  <br/>
War -  1860 to 1865.<br/>

War. He combines photos with period music and interviews with <br/>
historians. He also had actors reading letters and papers from the <br/>
parties involved in the war. It was very good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439905494">Friend husband is a serious buff.   I&#39;ll get him to send you<br/>
some sites - and also make him available for PEM if she wants<br/>
the socio political economic analysis of what was actually going<br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
Here is something of his that was published today in AMERICAN<br/>
VEXILLUM.  It isn&#39;t exactly &quot;on-point&quot; but Civil War history is<br/>
so fraught with myth and political correctness that it is<br/>
probably helpful to take a look at the pig in the poke (that&#39;s<br/>
Appalachian for shopping bag):<br/>
<br/>
A petition has been circulated which demands that the flag of<br/>
the United States not be displayed at the funeral ceremony for<br/>
the heroic crew of the Confederate States Submarine H.L. Hunley.<br/>
The objection is raised in the petition that the soldiers and<br/>
sailors of the Hunley died fighting for the independence of<br/>
their country from the United States , and that, therefore, the<br/>
flag of the United States represents the &quot;eternal enemy&quot; of<br/>
those brave naval pioneers.<br/>
<br/>
It is true that the United States forces were the enemy against<br/>
whom Confederate States servicemen struggled for the<br/>
independence of their homeland.  That struggle ended with the<br/>
destruction of Confederate independence.  Sad as that result may<br/>
have been for Southern soldiers and sailors, especially for<br/>
those who sacrificed their lives in the struggle, the survivors<br/>
saw that their sacrifice need not be in vain.  The vindication<br/>
of the Cause, however, would not come by continuing the struggle<br/>
for independence, or view the United States as the &quot;eternal<br/>
enemy&quot;, but rather by struggling for the cause of states&#39; rights<br/>
and constitutional government within the context of a re-united<br/>
America.  This continuing struggle was enunciated by President<br/>
Davis in 1880, when he encouraged us to, &quot;[b]e obedient and good<br/>
citizens, and if Secession ever comes again, let it come from<br/>
the North.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not long after President Davis gave that advice, Confederate<br/>
veterans and their sons rallied under the flag of the United<br/>
States , and marched off to war against Spain .  They did not<br/>
see that flag as the flag of the &quot;eternal enemy&quot;.  Throughout<br/>
the 20th century Southerners fought for the United States and<br/>
their flag.  Now, in the 21st century, Southerners contribute<br/>
more than their proportional share to the armed forces, still<br/>
fighting, as did their Confederate ancestors, for constitutional<br/>
liberty and independence.  These same Southern veterans, those<br/>
who fought under the Southern Cross and those who fought under<br/>
the Stars and Stripes, find their final resting places marked by<br/>
monuments provided by the government of the United States ,<br/>
honouring them all as American veterans.<br/>
<br/>
In 1875 General Nathan Bedford Forrest attended a reunion of the<br/>
veterans of the 7th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment, among whom was<br/>
my great grandfather, Henry Cannon.  At that reunion, General<br/>
Forrest said to the veterans, &quot;Comrades, through the years of<br/>
bloodshed and weary marches you were tried and true soldiers.<br/>
So through the years of peace you have been good citizens, and<br/>
now that we are again united under the old flag, I love it as I<br/>
did in the days of my youth, and I feel sure that you love it<br/>
also.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How can we, their descendants, show that flag any less respect<br/>
than did the men who &quot;rode with Forrest&quot;?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177605583">Echoing what other people have said, I like Joy Hakim&#39;s _History of US_ <br/>
series, although I haven&#39;t read the Civil War part of her series, but <br/>
have read a few of the volumes.<br/>
<br/>
Ken Burns&#39; Civil War miniseries is brilliant, but I couldn&#39;t watch all <br/>
of it as I find the enormous death tolls so sad.  Maybe it won&#39;t affect <br/>
your daughter that way as the era must seem farther away to her and less <br/>
personal.<br/>
