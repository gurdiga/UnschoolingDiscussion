&gt;As a member of the christian community I&#39;ve witnessed this behavior by &gt;others.  I wish I understood or could explain why people do this but I&#39;m &gt;mostly stumped myself.  Even Christians of different denominations will do &gt;this to each other.  <br/>

We have had friends of all faiths and denominations, and plenty of Christians, as that is the majority in this country.  Many of them have expressed your same sentiments, consternation and sadness over those many who are untollerant and uncharitable, and a personal love and desire to be enriched by acceptance and experience.<br/>
<br/>
Of course there are Pagans who are untollerant, but one of the things I love about our extended community of Pagan folks, is the general tone of acceptance.  Due to our beliefs, they intrinsically encourage acceptance and respect of the beliefs of others.<br/>
