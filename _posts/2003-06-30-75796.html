Uh, that&#39;d be me. I think one is not truly an unschooler until one can<br/>
make fudge a part of every meal and eat it while doing back flips on the<br/>
trampoline.  There&#39;ll be a list soon.  Fudge Flipping Unschoolers.  Or<br/>
Fudgeschoolers. <br/>

I once had a neighbor tell me she sometimes spends entire days trying not to eat chocolate.  I told her I make it a point to eat some everyday :-)<br/>

No, I won&#39;t be there.  I couldn&#39;t manage the air fare -- not that AND<br/>
some of the other things Dylan wanted to do this summer.   But you can<br/>
come live with me and Julian can bring his curly head full of critters.<br/>
