Thanks for the info on Summerhill.  The site is being changed, though.  The<br/>
temporary address is:<br/>
<br/>
www.s-hill.demon.co.uk<br/>
<br/>
That &quot;demon&quot; part confused me until I saw that they no longer consider<br/>
themselves an &quot;experimental&quot; school, but rather a &quot;demonstration&quot; school.  I<br/>
assume that&#39;s what &quot;demon&quot; means! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Since it&#39;s temp. there&#39;s only a little info, but it&#39;s still interesting<br/>
reading.  Three years ago the legislature almost closed them down!  But the<br/>
school won the battle...<br/>
