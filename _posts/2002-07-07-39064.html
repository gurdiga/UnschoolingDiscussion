<div id="ygrps-yiv-659477719">Debi, how was Sunday School today? Did anything get resolved with the <br/>
teacher, or did you just let it go? <br/>
I have been thinking about this the past few days and I wonder if you <br/>
couldn&#39;t ask to have your son moved into a group with more involvement in the <br/>
lesson? Who says he has to be in the 9 year old class? Why, if he is <br/>
interested in the lesson and learning, can&#39;t he go to the teen class or with <br/>
you to an adult class? This is the bible we are talking about, (I assume) the <br/>
material covered in another class surely can&#39;t be inappropriate for a child <br/>
his age. If you are a fairly religious family, and your faith is a <br/>
cornerstone in your lives then I assume at 9 your son has the basics down. <br/>
Maybe he is ready to be in a class that covers more in-depth bible studies. <br/>
The teen class might resent a 9 year old in their midst, and the adult class <br/>
may too, but who knows? If your little boy is ready for more intense study <br/>
then why not? Besides, a child may ask questions that although the adults may <br/>
want to ask, they won&#39;t. It could prove to be interesting! Good luck!<br/>
