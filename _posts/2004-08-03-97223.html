<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815951736">&quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; is a quirky independent film about some people <br/>
who just don&#39;t fit in.  It defintely doesn&#39;t overload the senses but <br/>
it left all of us with a really good feeling.  We&#39;ve seen it three <br/>
times and can&#39;t wait to buy the video.  Anyone else see it?<br/>
