<div id="ygrps-yiv-745920519">&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t want to appear ignorant :-)  but is this seriously ok to do?? The <br/>
video games, I mean. He doesn&#39;t want to read when he wakes up. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you afraid the inspector will come?  The inspector isn&#39;t coming.<br/>
Or do you mean will the video games beam him to another planet while you&#39;re asleep?  Not in my experience.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Oh dear! I still have a long way to go - I still tend to think <br/>
*school* between 9 &  3 and *school holidays* when the ps are on <br/>
holiday.<br/>
I do only *think* that way - we dont *DO* school.............&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I was first homeschooling, when Kirby was five, I tended to review at the end of the day and feel good that <br/>
he had done some cool stuff--better most days than if he&#39;d been in school.  And if he learned things late at night <br/>
or on weekends I was REALLY thrilled, but things were better when I stopped knowing or caring when things <br/>
were learned.  It took a while, but if you can get over it I recommend it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Well, don&#39;t beat yourself up too much!  :)  9-3 is when most things are open <br/>
and when I am alive.  And &quot;school holidays&quot; come into the plan when we want <br/>
to include non-hsed kiddos.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids like it when school is out, so their friends can come over.  But when we&#39;re out at parks or museums, <br/>
they dread seeing a bus coming, or the cringe when school&#39;s out and droves of kids show up all at once <br/>
somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I firmly believe the Underground History of American Education by John<br/>
Taylor Gatto is a must read.  It will help tremendously in explaining to<br/>
&quot;educator&quot; type family & friends why we don&#39;t want to send our kids to<br/>
school.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s quite a Yankee history of American Education.  My parents and grandparents wend to one-room <br/>
schoolhouses in west Texas and southern New Mexico, and it was quite a different deal.  What he writes is true <br/>
as far as it goes, but it doesn&#39;t go everywhere in space and time, not even everywhere in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I do often get counter arguments fromother people. They argue that homeschooled children are very precious <br/>
while young, but they often turn into odd maladapted adults who struggle in their relationships.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ask them to name one, just one, by name. &lt;g&gt;  &quot;Often&quot; indeed...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What do you do to ensure that your child&#39;s social development does not fall<br/>
behind his peers at school??&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What you do is get to know some homeschoolers so you get over the worry, and then remember or get to know <br/>
some schooled kids (if your memories are wiped out) to remember that there is no age-appropriate social <br/>
development chart that all kids in school are &quot;not behind&quot;--each person develops differently.  There are twelve <br/>
year olds with more social skill and understanding than most adults</div>

Fun Books is where I bought my copy of the Underground History of <br/>
American Education.  As far as I know you won&#39;t find it at any of the <br/>
big bookstores.  Mr. Gatto published the book himself (I&#39;ve heard he <br/>
didn&#39;t want to pare it down to what publishers wanted).  A link to <br/>
the Fun Books site is below:<br/>

&gt;April<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is the title of the book &quot;The Underground History of American <br/>
Education&quot; By Gatto<br/>
<br/>
However, I am not sure if it has been released yet.  I have a &quot;Authors <br/>
Special Pre Publication Edition&quot; that I just happened upon at the <br/>
library.  My husband loved it so much that he wanted me to buy it, but when <br/>
I called the book store they did not even have it in their system.<br/>
<br/>
I know it had been offered early through the Homeschool Newslink paper <br/>
(www.homeschoolnewslink.com) but I just went there and it is not on the <br/>
page.  I did just find his own web site <br/>
though,  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/">http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/</a>  where it does have the book listed.<br/>
<br/>
This book is HUGE too. It looks like a soft covered college textbook.  It <br/>
is very in depth on the history and twisted philosophies behind public <br/>
education.  We did not agree with some of the things he said, but for 98% <br/>
of the book I think he is right on the mark.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

&gt; &gt;Yeah, I have the same question.  I couldn&#39;t find that title either.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;April<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That is the title of the book &quot;The Underground History of American<br/>
&gt;Education&quot; By Gatto<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However, I am not sure if it has been released yet.  I have a &quot;Authors<br/>
&gt;Special Pre Publication Edition&quot; that I just happened upon at the<br/>
&gt;library.  My husband loved it so much that he wanted me to buy it, but when<br/>
&gt;I called the book store they did not even have it in their system.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know it had been offered early through the Homeschool Newslink paper<br/>
&gt;(www.homeschoolnewslink.com) but I just went there and it is not on the<br/>
&gt;page.  I did just find his own web site<br/>
&gt;though,  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/">http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/</a>  where it does have the book <br/>
&gt;listed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This book is HUGE too. It looks like a soft covered college textbook.  It<br/>
&gt;is very in depth on the history and twisted philosophies behind public<br/>
&gt;education.  We did not agree with some of the things he said, but for 98%<br/>
&gt;of the book I think he is right on the mark.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope that helps!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;I firmly believe the Underground History of American Education by <br/>
&gt;John<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Taylor Gatto is a must read.  It will help tremendously in <br/>
&gt;explaining to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;educator&quot; type family & friends why we don&#39;t want to send our kids <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; school.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I went to search for this book on Amazon and could not find it. Is this <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;correct title? Any hints on where I can find it? I liked his other <br/>
&gt;book,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot; and would be interested to read this one if I could <br/>
&gt;get<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;hands on it.<br/>

He does have at least one MAJOR info error though and that has to do with <br/>
BF Skinners daughter.  It is listed on his web page though as an error, so <br/>
if you have read it, or will read it, take that part with a grain of <br/>
salt.  Skinner&#39;s daughter is alive and an artist overseas somewhere, she <br/>
did not kill herself.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, so, I do think you are right Tami, but you can get the pre <br/>

got ours at.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Ashley,<br/>
Have you ever made a volcanic eruption from baking soda and vinegar? I don&#39;t <br/>
have a particular &quot;recipe&quot;, I just mix the vinegar and baking soda until it <br/>
bubbles over. I fourteen, and I do this a lot for the younger kids I <br/>
babysit. If you put in red food coloring it really looks like lava! You and <br/>
Willis could make a volcano with paper mache or clay, and paint(use a bottle <br/>
or old cup as the base so you have something to put your lava ingredients <br/>
in:). Scientifically this doesn&#39;t have a lot to do with volcanoes(although <br/>
it is good for explaining chemical reactions), but it might be a fun project <br/>
to do along with your actual learning about them.<br/>
I found a couple of websites about volcanoes that might be useful to you, <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Volcano World: &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.volcano.und.edu">http://www.volcano.und.edu</a>&gt;<br/>
This site is huge and it has tons of information. They call it the premier <br/>
source of volcano info on the web with good reason!<br/>
<br/>
Jame&#39;s Volcano Page: <br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.http://www.oink.demon.co.uk/topics/volcano.htm">http://www.http://www.oink.demon.co.uk/topics/volcano.htm</a>&gt;<br/>
This is a good starter page. It has a simple explanation of what a volcano <br/>
exactly is and information about famous volcanoes, definitions of geological <br/>
terms, a few links, and interesting volcano related tid bits.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
<br/>
love, Ren<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Date: Sat, 20 Jan 2001 16:18:34 -0800<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can anyone recommend some good books, videos, materials, projects,websites,<br/>
&gt;etc., about volcanoes? Willis, 5, is very interested in volcanoes, and <br/>
&gt;wants<br/>
&gt;to explore more. We&#39;re just starting out in this process and I&#39;m not yet<br/>
&gt;fluent in all the resources and avenues of exploration  we could take.<br/>
&gt;(After all, I went to school, where all the &quot;material&quot; was <br/>
&gt;teacher-acquired,<br/>
&gt;teacher- presented.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, any ideas for a neophyte on how to build on dd&#39;s interest in<br/>
&gt;volcanoes would be greatly appreciated. We&#39;re in Northern California, three<br/>
&gt;hours north of S.F. in case there are any great museum exhibits anyone <br/>
&gt;knows<br/>
&gt;about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I will echo all who&#39;ve mentioned what a civilized, supportive group this <br/>
&gt;is.<br/>
&gt;I feel very lucky to have stumbled upon it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Best to all, Ashley, mom to Willis, 5, and Frances, 2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br>
<br>This link will take you to the earthcam site where I searched for volcano 
<br>cams! &nbsp;There was a whole bunch and I am sure your son would enjoy seeing live 
<br>cam shots of real active volcanos! &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Enjoy - Dawn

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059071827">We got a &#39;volcano kit&#39; for our 5yo&#39;s birthday last <br/>
year, had all the stuff, including a plastic volcano!  <br/>
&#39;Add your own vinegar...&#39;  We&#39;re in the UK, but I&#39;m <br/>
sure there will be products available over there...<br/>

Hi Ashley,<br/>
Have you ever made a volcanic eruption from baking soda <br/>
and vinegar? I don&#39;t <br/>
have a particular &quot;recipe&quot;, I just mix the vinegar and <br/>
baking soda until it <br/>
bubbles over. I fourteen, and I do this a lot for the <br/>
younger kids I <br/>
babysit. If you put in red food coloring it really <br/>
looks like lava! You and <br/>
Willis could make a volcano with paper mache or clay, <br/>
and paint(use a bottle <br/>
or old cup as the base so you have something to put <br/>
your lava ingredients <br/>
in:). Scientifically this doesn&#39;t have a lot to do with <br/>
volcanoes(although <br/>
it is good for explaining chemical reactions), but it <br/>
might be a fun project <br/>
to do along with your actual learning about them.<br/>
I found a couple of websites about volcanoes that might <br/>
be useful to you, <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Volcano World: &lt;http://www.volcano.und.edu&gt;<br/>
This site is huge and it has tons of information. They <br/>
call it the premier <br/>
source of volcano info on the web with good reason!<br/>
<br/>
Jame&#39;s Volcano Page: <br/>
&lt;http://www.http://www.oink.demon.co.uk/topics/volcano.h<br/>
tm&gt;This is a good starter page. It has a simple explanation of what a volcano <br/>
exactly is and information about famous volcanoes, definitions of geological <br/>
terms, a few links, and interesting volcano related tid bits.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
<br/>
love, Ren<br/>
<br/>
