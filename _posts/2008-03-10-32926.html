<br/>
HITTING IS ACTUALLY NOT BIBLICAL <br/>
Don&#39;t use the Bible as an excuse to spank. There is<br/>
confusion in the ranks of people of Judeo-Christian<br/>
heritage who, seeking help from the Bible in their<br/>
effort to raise godly children, believe that God<br/>
commands them to spank. They take &quot;spare the rod and<br/>
spoil the child&quot; seriously and fear that if they don&#39;t<br/>
spank, they will commit the sin of losing control of<br/>
their child. In our counseling experience, we find<br/>
that these people are devoted parents who love God and<br/>
love their children, but they misunderstand the<br/>
concept of the rod. <br/>
Rod verses - what they really mean. The following are<br/>
the biblical verses which have caused the greatest<br/>
confusion: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the<br/>
rod of discipline will drive it far from him.&quot; (Prov.<br/>
22:15) <br/>
<br/>
&quot;He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves<br/>
him is careful to discipline him.&quot; (Prov. 13:24) <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you<br/>
punish him with the rod, he will not die. Punish him<br/>
with the rod and save his soul from death.&quot; (Prov.<br/>
23:13-14) <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child<br/>
left to itself disgraces his mother.&quot; (Prov. 29:15) <br/>
<br/>
At first glance these verses may sound pro-spanking.<br/>
But you might consider a different interpretation of<br/>
these teachings. &quot;Rod&quot; (shebet) means different things<br/>
in different parts of the Bible. The Hebrew dictionary<br/>
gives this word various meanings: a stick (for<br/>
punishment, writing, fighting, ruling, walking, etc.).<br/>
While the rod could be used for hitting, it was more<br/>
frequently used for guiding wandering sheep. Shepherds<br/>
didn&#39;t use the rod to beat their sheep - and children<br/>
are certainly more valuable than sheep. As<br/>
shepherd-author Philip Keller teaches so well in A<br/>
Shepherd Looks At Psalm 23, the shepherd&#39;s rod was<br/>
used to fight off prey and the staff was used to<br/>
gently guide sheep along the right path. (&quot;Your rod<br/>
and your staff, they comfort me.&quot;  Psalm 23:4). <br/>
<br/>
Jewish families we&#39;ve interviewed, who carefully<br/>
follow dietary and lifestyle guidelines in the<br/>
Scripture, do not practice &quot;rod correction&quot; with their<br/>
children because they do not follow that<br/>
interpretation of the text. <br/>
<br/>
The book of Proverbs is one of poetry. It is logical<br/>
that the writer would have used a well-known tool to<br/>
form an image of authority. We believe that this is<br/>
the point that God makes about the rod in the Bible <br/>
parents take charge of your children. When you re-read<br/>
the &quot;rod verses,&quot; use the concept of parental<br/>
authority when you come to the word &quot;rod,&quot; rather than<br/>
the concept of beating or spanking. It rings true in<br/>
every instance. <br/>
<br/>
While Christians and Jews believe that the Old<br/>
Testament is the inspired word of God, it is also a<br/>
historical text that has been interpreted in many ways<br/>
over the centuries, sometimes incorrectly in order to<br/>
support the beliefs of the times. These &quot;rod&quot; verses<br/>
have been burdened with interpretations about corporal<br/>
punishment that support human ideas. Other parts of<br/>
the Bible, especially the New Testament, suggest that<br/>
respect, authority, and tenderness should be the<br/>
prevailing attitudes toward children among people of<br/>
faith. <br/>
<br/>
In the New Testament, Christ modified the traditional<br/>
eye-for-an-eye system of justice with His<br/>
turn-the-other-cheek approach. Christ preached<br/>
gentleness, love, and understanding, and seemed<br/>
against any harsh use of the rod, as stated by Paul in<br/>
1 Cor. 4:21: &quot;Shall I come to you with the whip (rod),<br/>
or in love and with a gentle spirit?&quot; Paul went on to<br/>
teach fathers about the importance of not provoking<br/>
anger in their children (which is what spanking<br/>
usually does): &quot;Fathers, do not exasperate your<br/>
children&quot; (Eph. 6:4), and &quot;Fathers, do not embitter<br/>
your children, or they will be discouraged&quot; (Col.<br/>
3:21). <br/>
<br/>
In our opinion, nowhere in the Bible does it say you<br/>
must spank your child to be a godly parent.<br/>
