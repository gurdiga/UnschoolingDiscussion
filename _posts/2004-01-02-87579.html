&lt;&lt;This is very interesting to me...<br/>
<br/>
I hope others would be willing to share ways they are<br/>
educating themselves while unschooling their children,<br/>
and possibly how pursuing their own interests have<br/>
sparked similar interests in their kids.<br/>

Hi Susan. <br/>
<br/>
Funny that you ask this because just tonight I was thinking that I owed my daughter a debt of gratitude for leading me to a book I am reading.  She received a loom (toy) for her 5th birthday.  We also have read the story Rumplestiltskin (sp) a million times.  After the gift (from a friend) she and I discussed and lightly researched spinning thread, warp and weft, etc., which got me interested in antique textiles.  As I am also interested in women&#39;s history and feminism I looked in our library for something to do with women and textiles in history.  I found the book &quot;Women&#39;s Work,&quot; about &quot;Women, Cloth, and Society in Early Times.&quot;  I&#39;m only just beginning it, but already I am fascinated and eager to read on.  <br/>
<br/>
The author notes that the transition from the paleolithic age (chipped stone tools) to neolithic (smooth stone tools) coincided with the birth of agriculture and postulates that this transition came about due to grinding grain (thus smoothing the stones), which was &quot;women&#39;s work.&quot;  Interesting.  The author quotes previous work that mentions the criteria that determine whether a society relies upon women as the chief providers of certain types of  labor (and proceeds to list them) - thought provoking-  and she also discusses that the products of women were generally perishable (food, textiles, pottery making, child-rearing, etc.) and so difficult to study.  I know much of this from previous study, but to have it articulated at this point in my life is helpful to me in order to grasp ideas and formulate my own ideas and questions.  <br/>
<br/>
One funny thing (and the first thing) that pops in my head that was the opposite (adult doings&#39; leading to child learning) was when my husband had to work on our septic system.  My daughter became &quot;afraid&quot; of the toilet because it was making burbling noises, and when we asked if she wanted to know more, she got a kind of field trip on the toilet, the plumbing/pipes in the basement, culminating in showing her the location of the leach field and actual tank.  She wanted to see all the pipes from the bathtub, kitchen sink, etc. after that.  She can tell you a pretty good &quot;how it works&quot; about plumbing and septic, all because she wanted to know what Daddy was doing.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just thought I&#39;d share. :)  Also wanted to mention I love the letterboxing/geocaching threads; I had never heard of this and can&#39;t wait until some of this snow is gone to begin!<br/>

I am trying to figure out how to use a drop spindle.  A friend and I took<br/>
our kids to a wool market.  Lots of vendors were there with wool, beautiful<br/>
spinning wheels, etc.  I fell in love with the textiles these people were<br/>
making right there as we watched.  I got a spindle and some fiber.....but so<br/>
far I have a rather glopulous glop on my hands.<br/>
