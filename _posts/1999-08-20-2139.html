<br/>
I think one of the easiest ways to think about unschooling is to <br/>
think about continuing on the same path that you followed when they <br/>
were little toddlers.  You live your life with them.  You engage them <br/>
in things that interest you or that might interest them.  You cheer <br/>
when they&#39;re bored because out of that boredom may come a wonderful <br/>
idea for a new project.  One of the most helpful things we did when <br/>
we first started was to do anything but school-like stuff.  We took a <br/>
lot of field trips, nature walks, etc. - just celebrating the fact <br/>
that we were free.  We read aloud until my voice was shot and then <br/>
read some more.  We also watched tv and played video games - still <br/>
do.  In fact yesterday  my 13 year old spent lots of time with a <br/>
video game,  but to help him through it,  he drew a map to scale as <br/>
the game progressed.  We have learned so much from television shows <br/>
and games.  With unlimited tv and video games here,  my kids became <br/>
more selective on their own.  Enjoy your kids and your family and the <br/>
learning will come.  There will be many times that you won&#39;t be able <br/>
to figure out where they learned what they know because with an <br/>
unschooling lifestyle their brains seem so much more receptive to <br/>
little snippets of info that pass others by.  Have fun!<br/>

Hi Jill,<br/>
What did you do on Saturday? Sunday? etc? Unschooling is life. We are all<br/>
learning all the time.  What are their interests?<br/>
<br/>
Bake something, make something, go somewhere, clean something, read<br/>
something-anything, take a nap-dream,<br/>
Look up a word-something absurd, have a big bowl of ice-cream.<br/>
Life is for learning, living, doing. How far will your imagination go?<br/>
Be, see, climb a tree. Beyond texts there is so much to know.<br/>
Life is an education, a journey where anything goes.<br/>
And the only limits that slow you down are the ones that are self imposed.<br/>
<br/>
So, the moment you stopped making them &#39;do&#39; school you were unschooling. If<br/>
they ask a question, answer it. If they want to know something help them<br/>
find out as much as they want your help. Include them in what you are doing<br/>
and let them include you in what they are doing.  And once in a while let<br/>
them sleep in!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119189694">I just can&#39;t resist.....I detest Arthur.  Talking to my daughter (10) about it<br/>
she describes how stereotyped the roles of the boys and girls are.  Anyway<br/>
talking with my daughter reaffirms my tentative belief that self-determination<br/>
is more important than my anxiety over TV.  Which is not to say that I don&#39;t<br/>
have something to say about the TV going for hours at a time because I live here<br/>
too. It really is not a big problem for us only episodically.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-239499300">It&#39;s not so much what you do as what your kids do. Did they shower? are they<br/>
getting breakfast, watching tv, talking, breathing? Then you have begun:) Talk<br/>
with them, listen to them, enjoy the world around you. Have fun and remember<br/>
learning is involved in everything you do, whether or not you can *see* it. I&#39;d<br/>
say you are well on your way.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
