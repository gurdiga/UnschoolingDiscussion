<br/>
Please undo the thought that what you were doing was strewing.  <br/>
I get to say that, because I’m the one who came up with the term “strewing” to refer to leaving something interesting out WITHOUT ATTACHMENT TO OUTCOME.<br/>
<br/>
-=-For the moment, I see that my son wants to play, play, play._+_<br/>
<br/>
He’s nine years old and needs time to recover from the school that caused you to take him out, and from the homeschooling that caused you to switch to unschooling.<br/>
But even if he had never been to school at all, and you were always unschooling, and he were nine, this is important:  Play, play, play is what he should be doing.  Nothing else.  Only playing.<br/>
<br/>
Jouer, un sérieux travail:    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/french/playing">http://sandradodd.com/french/playing</a><br/>
Ignore the list of books and videos.   Even when the article was current, it made no sense to translate that part to French. :-)<br/>
<br/>
-=-We have started homeschooling 2 years ago, then unschooling around 2 months ago. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you want to tell us how long you were in school, Dominique, we could help you with some advice for recovery from that.  But you need to count all your years of school, AND any years you taught, including the two years you homeschooled your son before you were unschooling.   That recovery takes at least one month per year of your schoolish life.   <br/>
<br/>
You’re looking for school.  Because you don’t know what unschooling looks like, you can’t see it.  It’s invisible to people who haven’t deschooled.<br/>
Because you’re pressuring your son, he can’t deschool  His deschooling won’t take as long as yours will, but if you never leave him along he will never deschool.<br/>
If you don’t stop looking for school, YOU will never deschool.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m trying to create an evironment that facilitates various interests and curiosity, with books, games, videos and such.-=-<br/>
<br/>
For now, don’t—unless it’s books, games and videos that YOU like.  Do it for yourself, and gradually see the sort of learning that can come incidentally—by random connections.  Let your son do what he wats to do.  Stop asking him to report.  Stop reminding him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He receives a letter and really want to read it and reply,-=-<br/>
<br/>
Did you refuse to read a letter to him?  Have school and homeschooling made him afraid to read, and you’re not offering to read?  Couldn’t YOU reply?  (If it’s a mutual friend, or a relative.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-What I observe is that when my son says he&#39;s interested in something particular, he doesn&#39;t transform,-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you read something about unschooling that suggested that an interest should transform a person, make note of where you read it and never go to that source again. :-)<br/>
Perhaps you misunderstood, or are expecting too much too soon.<br/>
<br/>
If this were a gardening forum, would you come and say “I planted my garden two months ago, and I keep pulling the plants up and seeing if they’re growing, and I’m getting tired of gardening”?<br/>
If there were a forum on composting, would you say “I have put food scraps, leaves, grass and dirt into a pile for two months and nothing has happened”?<br/>

<br/>
Probably the best thing you could do is to read Pam Laricchia’s introduction to unschooling.  It’s a free e-book.<br/>

She has another book translated into French. <br/>

<br/>
I know that’s a lot of input, and it will take you many weeks to look that over and try some of those ideas out.  It’s the only way, though, to STOP doing school things, and to stop so completely, for a while, that you can both start back at zero, and see the world in new ways.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-258657925">In our family, a kid who says they want to do something &quot;tomorrow&quot; translates to &quot;some other day in the future, but not now.&quot; &nbsp;I&#39;ve had enough experience with &quot;tomorrow&quot; to know that this is a polite way for my kids to keep the door open, but to avoid committing to an activity or project.<br><br>Teri</div>

On the other hand, helping someone find better ways to accomplish what *they&#39;re* trying to do will turn you toward unschooling. But you need to let go of your agenda for them, let go of what you think should be accomplished and tune into what goal the other person has.&quot;<br><br>Karen James</div></div>
