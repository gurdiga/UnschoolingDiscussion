Thanks, Pam for your reply.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;But I do think that from the examples given, that it has been clear that <br/>
 </span></blockquote>nobody was ever saying that. Sandra, for example, has talked at length<br/>
about <br/>
helping her kids learn all kinds of things. I&#39;ve recently posted some<br/>
ways to <br/>
help kids learn some math stuff. I think that anybody reading for more<br/>
than a <br/>
few days would realize that the point of not using the word &quot;teach&quot; is<br/>
to <br/>
retrain old patterns of thinking - to help people break away from<br/>
thinking <br/>
that kids only learn what teachers teach.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
When I first joined the list I read some posts where people demonstrated<br/>
what they as caring involved parents were doing with their kids, but<br/>
there was also a large discussion of teaching vs learning. That&#39;s where<br/>
I came in. And when I added my thoughts on that matter someone ripped my<br/>
face off by insisting &quot;teach&quot; was a dirty word, no matter what<br/>
connotations anyone else had for it. The effect was to shut me up and I<br/>
didn&#39;t want to post for a while. Then when someone else complained and<br/>
made a point of not liking the rudeness, so I felt better and I decided<br/>
to get back into the discussions and just ignore anyone whose intent is<br/>
to shut others down. It is valuable to discuss things back and forth and<br/>
expand one&#39;s understanding. After the other person spke up with her<br/>
complaint, I realized there are others who want free discussion of ideas<br/>
and the list was not just limited  to one set view and rule of<br/>
acceptability.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It is actually too close to what many have done by leaving their kids<br/>
&gt; off at a school. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;THIS makes sense - sort of. I mean - I can imagine it, even though I can&#39;t <br/>
&gt;say I&#39;ve EVER seen it in practice. Except that people who don&#39;t want to <br/>
&gt;interact and support their kids&#39; learning would just leave them IN school -- <br/>
&gt;at least that&#39;s what makes sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You mean you haven&#39;t ever had your kids in school at all? Lucky and<br/>
brave person to have started off homeschooling! I figured out that was<br/>
what I wanted to do after my youngest child&#39;s 1st grade year in a <br/>
private school. I didn&#39;t know there were such things as support groups<br/>
or anyone else doing it, I had read my first book on the subject &quot;Teach<br/>
Your Own&quot; by John Holt. So I did it. (Note the title of the book by the<br/>
original unschooling guru - &quot;*Teach* Your Own&quot;- gasp!)<br/>
<br/>
You would be surprised to know that many parents these days take their<br/>
kids out of school because their kids are in trouble or having trouble,<br/>
but they themselves don&#39;t know how to or even want to do anything to<br/>
solve the problem except take them away from the problem. Not really<br/>
knowing how to fix anything or what to do - just want o get them away<br/>
from the scary or annoying place of authority. Really, people call me<br/>
every month telling me they want to homeschool their kids and would I do<br/>
it for them.... they think homschooling means in somebody&#39;s home, not<br/>
necessarily theirs! A real irresponsibility stance, believe me. ON the<br/>
other hand I know many other parents who love to have their kids home,<br/>
and do fine unschooling. Others, have their kids home and have trouble<br/>
relating to their kids and it can degenerate down into &quot;do what I say or<br/>
elseyou go back to school!&quot;. Still others have good intentions but not a<br/>
clue what to do and any new fad or thing to buy becomes the thing that<br/>
&quot;they should do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So you see I really appreciate all the conversations going on here on<br/>
this list. It gives me insight into how to relate to people&#39;s questions<br/>
and difficulties on various levels. Great ideas of ways to explain with<br/>
realistic situations and insightfulthings to say - how you could<br/>
understand and help your kids, how to go about unschooling or living<br/>
with your kids. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Don&#39;t interfere - learning will happen.... Nobody grows&gt;  or changes if the <br/>
&gt; kids are just left to be by themselves and don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; a loving parent there to interact when needed. <br/>
<br/>
&gt;We had this discussion on this list a month or so ago - people were posting <br/>
&gt;about this exact thing - and were attacked for supposedly saying that kids <br/>
&gt;needed to be &quot;entertained all the time.&quot; Just can&#39;t win, can we? &lt;G&gt; But - <br/>
&gt;yes I agree with this point. I just don&#39;t think it is a big issue. I haven&#39;t <br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;seen unschooling parents who didn&#39;t work hard to enrich their kids&#39;<br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I knew when I wrote this that it would sound categorical,  And I<br/>
do believe there is instead a gradient of &quot;left alone&quot; to &quot;constantly<br/>
involved with parents&quot;. At any one time for any particular kid and<br/>
family, it might be &quot;more left to figure out what to do and create&quot; is<br/>
better - and for other times and families &quot;more help and mutual action&quot;<br/>
is good. Probably need a mix of both. IT is good to see what others have<br/>
made of a gradient of this that you never thought of. Like playing a<br/>
piano, you can go louder and softer, faster and slower  for different<br/>
effects.<br/>
I have seen though kids left to figure what to do by themselves and<br/>
being lonely, just went to watch TV&gt; MY own daughter when she was about<br/>
7 and I was working on legislative issues for 3 weeks straight during a<br/>
legislative session of our state - she found the 24 hour Cartoon CHannel<br/>
- and that IS what she did! When I came off the computer very late one<br/>
night I found her watching cartoons as 3 in the morning. Boy, when that<br/>
legistative session was over, I put the TV in the garge (storage) and<br/>
told my group that I couldn&#39;t be the one to work 24 hours for 3 weeks on<br/>
emrgencies anymore. My child meant more to me, and I ahd to get her<br/>
weaned into doing things again. Whew!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen planty of kids taken out of school and left to play with an<br/>
ever mounting array of video games so they wouldn&#39;t bug their parents<br/>
when they were bored. The parents weren&#39;t bad, uneducated; they were<br/>
rich and spoiled and so their kids became. The philosphy of caring<br/>
unschooling must be preserved and I am thankful for the support here and<br/>
magazines with articles, other internet support sites, because beleive<br/>
not everyone naturally gravitates to it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don&#39;t mean to bring people down with this aspect of reality.<br/>
But with the speed at which our school system is self-destructing, an<br/>
increasing number of people are coming to homeschooling without the<br/>
commitment of earlier times. IT is vital we help those who turn this way<br/>
and share our successful model.  I&#39;d like to get off this topic and into<br/>
the inspiring aspects of unschooling.  I&#39;ll finish answering this post<br/>
and get to brighter, happier stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; New homeschoolers often<br/>
&gt; have to make a real effort to BE with their kids when they have so<br/>
&gt; conveniently been without them for so long.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt;I think they do - yes. Sometimes they have to make an effort to observe them <br/>
&gt;carefully - and not to DIRECT them all the time, too.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very true- this is an art in itself. TO observe and watch with love but<br/>
not interefering. It is amazing what you can see when you expect your<br/>
child to know things all by himself and figure out new things to do that<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have come up with in a million years. Hurrah, a universe and<br/>
future is being created! I think all kids have the potential to create<br/>
their own universe given the opportunity and without interfence. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think a discussion of the different aspects of learning vs teaching<br/>
&gt; is very helpful .... up to a point. All people do both, I think, teach<br/>
&gt; and learn in the natural scheme of life. Learning that there is a<br/>
&gt; give-and-take in these things is very valuable.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Some of the same people saying that &quot;you don&#39;t need to &quot;teach&quot;&quot; and &quot;you <br/>
 </span></blockquote>don&#39;t need to become their &quot;teacher&quot;&quot; are also those of us who post <br/>
b&#39;zillions of ideas and anecdotes about our unschooling lives. So - yeah<br/>
- I <br/>
agree with you and do it all the time.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, it&#39;s nice to acknowledge that we are on the same page.<br/>
