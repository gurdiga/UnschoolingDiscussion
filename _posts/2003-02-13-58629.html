&gt; Maybe it&#39;s genetic?<br/>
&gt; Maybe if you or his dad are that way he has it either genetically or by <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote> Teresa,  has gotten alot of postive<br/>
response from this group, and Sandra, you have to come off like this? <br/>
I also, have a child with special needs, and with your education, I expected <br/>
much more from you. And no, its not always gentic or learned by modeling.<br/>
<br/>
Its very apparent that You have absolutely no clue of parenting a child with <br/>
special needs, much less commenting in regards to it. <br/>
The best way I have ever seen or practiced changing children&#39;s behavior is <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for me to be the way I want them to be.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is fantastic approach again from someone<br/>
with out a special needs child. But only a fantasy<br/>
from a parent with a challenged child.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Sandra for your kind and wonderful advice.  I will definitely stop <br/>
throwing temper tantrums around here.. Gosh, I&#39;ve broken 5 sewing machines, 3 <br/>
<br/>
microwaves,  and 3 mixers in just the past 6 months.. I also wrecked my car <br/>
and punched out my window.   I attacked my husband and tried to choke him, <br/>
then I kicked him in the groin last night.  I yelled at my kids and called <br/>
them no-good fuckers and said they were worthless and they ruined my life. .  <br/>
<br/>
Just a few days ago the bread I was making didnt turn out right so I trashed <br/>
the whole god damned oven.  Do  you think, when I couldnt get my on loan lap <br/>
top from school   to come on and I smashed it to the floor and stomped on it, <br/>
<br/>
could that have been a bad example?  You know, I never realized how my <br/>
behavior could affect my kids .  What an insight.. So, do you think, if I <br/>
stop behaving like this, my sons will stop too??   Maybe its worth a try.   <br/>
You know, I really thought you didnt like me, how paranoid of me..  I really <br/>
need to work on not being so schizo and afraid that folks are against me.   <br/>
<br/>
If it works in Doddville, it MUST work here too.. Thanks again<br/>
<br/>
Yep, it must be nice in Doddville!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This point has been addressed by others but it&#39;s an important point.<br/>
<br/>
Our children are *both* a product of their genes and a product of our<br/>
parenting. Having a special need to point to as a cause of behavior should<br/>
not stop a parent from being aware of the effect the parent has on the<br/>
child. That doesn&#39;t mean that perfect parenting turns all children into<br/>
perfect children. But it does mean that we are responsible for helping or<br/>
hindering them learning how to cope with their needs.<br/>
<br/>
In fact the women people most turn to for advice about special needs<br/>
children at Unschooling.com seem to be the *most* self aware of the part<br/>
they play in how their children handle life. They are *the* most willing to<br/>
examine their own behavior. They are *the* most willing to put their<br/>
children&#39;s needs first and set aside their own emotional reactions their<br/>
children&#39;s expressions of their needs.<br/>
<br/>
The problem *isn&#39;t* the broken game controlers or the broken chairs or the<br/>
broken doors. If a parent sees that as the problem then she *is* part of the<br/>
problem. And if that same parent comes here and repeatedly throws adult<br/>
temper tantrums when she&#39;s asked to examine what part she may be playing in<br/>
what&#39;s going on at home then she&#39;s demonstrating an unwillingness to self<br/>
examine.<br/>
<br/>
The problem *is* the child not having an emotional awareness and the skills<br/>
to handle strong emotions. If that same parent says:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; This destructive behavior usually happens so fast, we<br/>
&gt;&gt; cant stop it.  To &quot;channel&quot; thier aggression elsewhere would require CONSTANT<br/>
&gt;&gt; supervision., which seems unreasonable for kids thier age..( and really,<br/>
&gt;&gt; impossible) <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>she&#39;s reinforcing barriers between her kids and help she could be providing<br/>
for them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has read Sandra&#39;s advice for a while knows that Kirby had a big<br/>
temper when he was younger. They have also read how she focused on him and<br/>
his needs and helped him acquire the skills he needed to help himself.<br/>
Here&#39;s something she wrote last year:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kirby was younger when he had such temper problems, but his dad or I would<br/>
&gt; get at his level and say &quot;BREATHE,&quot; and we would breathe with him.  If he<br/>
&gt; refused to breathe to calm down, we&#39;d remind him that if he breathed deeply<br/>
&gt; he would feel better.  &quot;Get air to your toes.  Breathe.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Usually he would.  If he couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t we would carry him away from<br/>
&gt; the group and sit with him or put him in a car or in his room, and probably<br/>
&gt; stay with him, unless we were losing our tempers too and then we&#39;d just stay<br/>
&gt; near.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve met Anne&#39;s and Mary&#39;s and Sandra&#39;s kids. They are all delightful<br/>
people. (The moms too :-) It seems to me that if my child had turned my<br/>
house into a &quot;war zone&quot; I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to attack advice from people<br/>
whose children have or had issues and who are now dealing joyfully with<br/>
life. And I might want to *especially* examine the advice that made me mad<br/>
because that&#39;s a good indication that it&#39;s hitting uncomfortably close to<br/>
something I&#39;m avoiding examining. Being defensive is a good indication that<br/>
we&#39;re trying to find some external cause in order to avoid examining what<br/>
part we&#39;re playing in the situation. It&#39;s a lot easier to point the blame<br/>
elsewhere. That way we can absolve ourselves of responsibility.<br/>
