Oh wow! We probably are pretty near each other since I just have to drive a mile to get into Nebraska. We&#39;re about 10 minutes away from Crofton, NE. Alcester is probably an hour or less away from us to the north.<br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cross over to Nebraska over the Meridian Bridge on Highway 81. If we kept going for about an hour we&#39;d hit Norfolk. That&#39;s wonderful that there may be more hs&#39;ers moving nearby. I&#39;ll also be glad to meet others.<br>
