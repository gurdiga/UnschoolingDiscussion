<div id="ygrps-yiv-938354099">I tend to skip over any posts with the topic &quot;Re: Digest #*****&quot;, there<br/>
just isn&#39;t enough time in my day.  For every 20 I open only one will be a<br/>
thread I want to track.  Now, no one may care whether I read their posts<br/>
but I would suspect that many others are like me.<br/>
<br/>
I decide which posts to read by the topic and would be thrilled if people<br/>
would change the topic title to match the issue being discussed.<br/>

&quot;It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of <br/>
instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiousity of inquiry; <br/>
for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need <br/>
of freedom.&quot;<br/>
