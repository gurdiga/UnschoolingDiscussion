<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623661001">Living/Learning/Teaching With Dyslexia: You will<br/>
 find that my view of life is in large part<br/>
responsible for my understanding of the workings of<br/>
the mind and the physical brain. I do not intend to<br/>
preach, just to <br/>
 share my experience. I will start in the middle and<br/>
 go back and forth from there. At age twenty-three I<br/>
saw a &quot;Sixty Minutes&quot; segment on dyslexia. Recognition<br/>
and self-discovery was quite comforting. At age<br/>
twenty-six <br/>
 I was tested (for free, as a favor to the children&#39;s<br/>
 home in which I worked and the county counseling<br/>
facility which provided me with co-alcoholic /<br/>
co-dependent therapy) by the institution which tested<br/>
and counseled the juveniles I supervised. They<br/>
confirmed my self-diagnosis and offered nothing beyond<br/>
that, saying I was over-compensating as well <br/>
 as would be expected. At age twenty-nine my IQ was<br/>
 tested by a psychologist who said the same thing. My<br/>
score qualified me for membership in Mensa. At age<br/>
thirty-one I started taking my first daughter, then<br/>
two years old, to the library and began a bit of <br/>
 research on dyslexia. My basic understanding then,<br/>
 which has not changed but has expanded, was that the<br/>
central area of the brain is shaped differently in a<br/>
dyslexic, there is constant interaction between the <br/>
 &quot;left brain/conscious&quot; and the&quot;rightbrain /<br/>
subconscious&quot; in the dyslexic, and the perception of<br/>
patterns is unpredictable. More recent research shows<br/>
differences in the brain on a cellular level as well. <br/>
 Without the common distinction between conscious and<br/>
 subconscious functioning, objects are lost in space<br/>
and sounds are lost in time. In practical terms, this<br/>
is something like trying to put together a jigsaw <br/>
 puzzle while it is tossed in the air. Reading is<br/>
 slow because one must reread a sentence until it can<br/>
be read in an order that makes sense. Research shows<br/>
that in most people a particular area of the brain is<br/>
used for reading, but in the dyslexic this function is<br/>
not restricted to one area.  Cells on the right side<br/>
of the brain, and the right side as a whole are larger<br/>
than on the left side in a dyslexic.  People get the<br/>
idea that I am very intense, but a lot of that is just<br/>
my effort to recognize visual and auditory input. I<br/>
 have to really gaze at a face or page or street or<br/>
whatever while the parts settle into place. Listening<br/>
is difficult and requires repetition<br/>
 because the first time or two a sentence is spoken it<br/>
might sound like gibberish. My older daughter could<br/>
not understand anything spoken on television or in a <br/>
 group until age five, and so I constantly whispered<br/>
 in her ear, repeating and explaining what was said as<br/>
best I could. Now she finds that she must become<br/>
accustomed to each new person&#39;s speech patterns. <br/>
  Speaking in clear smooth sentences is sometimes<br/>
 easy and sometimes nearly impossible. I might say an<br/>
entirely different word than the one I am thinking, or<br/>
say something that doesn&#39;t sound like any word at all.<br/>
<br/>
 So it won&#39;t surprise you when I say I believe the<br/>
 most important tools in educating myself and my<br/>
daughter have been the development of patience and<br/>
self-esteem. Patience I see as the result of<br/>
forgiveness and persistence. One must forgive self and<br/>
also forgive others for not understanding. One must<br/>
stubbornly continue in the face of discouragement from<br/>
others. Where dyslexia is concerned, I have learned <br/>
and have taught my daughter that she functions a<br/>
 particular way just as she looks a particular way and<br/>
should never feel apologetic about her own nature but<br/>
rather should understand that she has the same right<br/>
and duty as anyone else to be and do and speak out and<br/>
take up space in the world. I<br/>
can&#39;t tell you anything useful from my own school<br/>
years. I was just a perfectionist who used my own<br/>
dogged determination to concentrate so hard that I<br/>
really didn&#39;t get behind, I just had to try harder and<br/>
spend more time studying than the others. I did have<br/>
the impression of letters and numbers moving and<br/>
changing places in unpredictable ways. I did try the<br/>
color films and lenses when I first read about that<br/>
theory, but did not find them helpful. I do wear<br/>
glasses for astigmatism, but they just cut down on<br/>
blurring. Over the years print moves less than it did<br/>
early on, but everything continues to be jigsaw<br/>
puzzles in the air. I have never been without bruised<br/>
hands, <br/>
feet, knees, and elbows. The physical world is just<br/>
never quite where I think it is. The second most<br/>
important tool is familiarity, which comes from a<br/>
combination of exposure and time. In general, when <br/>
presented with new information my daughter would<br/>
first resist and have difficulty understanding (&quot;I<br/>
can&#39;t&quot;, &quot;I won&#39;t&quot;, etc.). Then a day or week or month<br/>
later she would suddenly and seemingly with great<br/>
inspiration present me with the same <br/>
information as if it were her own knowledge or idea,<br/>
and often request additional or expanded studies on<br/>
that topic. With something that builds on itself over<br/>
time, like reading or math, I took tiny repetitious<br/>
steps with her, constantly encouraging her and<br/>
explaining over and over again that she must stop<br/>
expecting herself to know a thing before she learns <br/>
it and that such things require years of practice<br/>
and development. At age six she insisted on learning<br/>
to read, but could only tolerate a very few minutes<br/>
daily before crying or screaming with frustration. So<br/>
each <br/>
day we spent just those few minutes, and I emphasized<br/>
her wonderful progress. I used an old library copy of<br/>
&quot;Why Johnny Can&#39;t Read&quot;. I copied all the phonics<br/>
exercises from the back of the book. They begin <br/>
with pictures to illustrate the sounds of letters.<br/>
One letter is learned at a time, and then two-letter<br/>
words are read, and so on. In our own books I<br/>
underlined all the words she was working on<br/>
so that when we read together she was cued by the<br/>
underlines to read her part of each sentence. By the<br/>
time we got to the more complex and unruly spellings <br/>
she was reading so well that we no longer needed the<br/>
exercises. She finds now, like me, that it is easier<br/>
to express herself in print than with speech because<br/>
of the opportunity for editing. At age sixteen her <br/>
request for her birthday was permission to apply for<br/>
work. I helped her fill out the applications and<br/>
coached her for interviewing. She first worked in a<br/>
small nursing home cooking, cleaning, and doing<br/>
laundry. Next she worked in a restaurant cooking,<br/>
cleaning, waiting tables, and <br/>
running errands. She learned to listen to a greater<br/>
variety of people, meet and converse with new people,<br/>
carry out multiple tasks, budget a paycheck, and<br/>
budget her time, all in relatively homey atmospheres.<br/>
She telephoned me often to ask for help and advice in<br/>
dealing with people and unfamiliar tasks.  She <br/>
decided to take her GED as soon as the law allowed,<br/>
at age eighteen. Soon after this she took her ACT. She<br/>
attended community college classes full-time for two<br/>
years while working twenty to thirty hours per week in<br/>
a second restaurant. <br/>
She made A&#39;s, B&#39;s, and C&#39;s. Next she worked in a<br/>
Walmart store, where many types of work can be learned<br/>
and tried. Now at age twenty-two<br/>
she works third shift in a pizza factory: dismantling,<br/>
maintaining, and sterilizing equipment, and helping<br/>
out in any department that needs her. This is not<br/>
glamorous <br/>
but pays fairly well. She chose not to continue<br/>
school. At home, on her own computer, she researches a<br/>
vast range of subjects, including dyslexia and<br/>
homeschooling (which I tend to think of as<br/>
unschooling). She is amazingly creative. She thinks<br/>
it&#39;s no big deal to make from scratch, with no<br/>
pattern, perfectly tailored doll clothes or Halloween<br/>
costumes for her younger sister. She bakes without<br/>
recipes or by using her own variations on cookbook<br/>
recipes. If she makes herself sit still<br/>
long enough she can draw anything with nearly<br/>
photographic quality. Which brings me to my current<br/>
understanding of dyslexia, as not a disability but<br/>
rather a way of being. With the areas of the brain so<br/>
interactive, the dyslexic is dreamy all the time.<br/>
Slipping into meditative states is normal, <br/>
effortless, and done without forethought. The<br/>
intuitive and creative problem-solving abilities are<br/>
strongly emphasized. The subconscious uprush is a way<br/>
of life. Sensitivity is dramatic. The dyslexic can&#39;t <br/>
help noticing everything at once, and sometimes<br/>
feels a bit overwhelmed, but they tend to be able to<br/>
do and think about several things at once. I<br/>
personally can&#39;t help responding to all the<br/>
stimulation, but my daughter sometimes <br/>
pretends to ignore it all. She needs a lot of quiet<br/>
time alone. Too much activity is very unsettling for<br/>
her.  At age twenty-five I began to write a bit of<br/>
poetry.  Over the years this has developed.  I never<br/>
consciously compose my writing, and in fact cannot<br/>
write about something out of a simple desire to do so,<br/>
it&#39;s more like a spring-fed stream from the depths of<br/>
my soul.  I feel it welling up and am agitated until<br/>
running it through pen or keyboard.  But getting the<br/>
job done is a slow process, requiring lots of editing<br/>
to correct what I wrote instead of what I meant.  I<br/>
was thirty years old before I began to feel confident<br/>
and capable in organizing my own thoughts and body of<br/>
knowledge and experience into lengthy conversations.<br/>
Okay, that&#39;s as far as I&#39;ll go for now.  I know this<br/>
note is very long, but still there are likely to be<br/>
holes in it because I&#39;ve tried to be brief.  Feel free<br/>
to ask for more, or to ask me to explain myself.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-610461804">Dear Diana,<br/>
I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for writing all that out and explaining what you see, feel, read, etc. I had no idea until I read your post what it&#39;s like to have dyslexia. I can only say again THANK you for opening up my eyes. I still don&#39;t know if my dd is dyslexic (I would suspect to some degree she is) but this kind of information is priceless.<br/>

Thanks for posting this great interpretation of &quot;dyslexia&quot; and your personal experience!! I have a brilliant son who deals with many of the issues you describe and who I feel I understand so much better after reading your post. It&#39;s so difficult for him to describe his experience and he was so excited to read your post with me! He knows he&#39;s different and sometimes he feels confused/concerned about his intelligence or lack of in the eyes of some. A mothers reassurance isn&#39;t always enough. Reading about someone&#39;s real life experience, not a text book definition, had a very positive effect. <br/>
<br/>
....Speaking in clear smooth sentences is sometimes easy and sometimes nearly impossible. I might say an entirely different word than the one I am thinking, or say something that doesn&#39;t sound like any word at all.....<br/>
<br/>
This really rang a bell with him! We used to say that he was reluctant to accept that words had been created before he had a chance to create better ones.&lt;bg&gt; We&#39;ve always enjoyed his unique way of making meaning and seeing the world, he&#39;s expanded us all!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780523670">Many, many years ago, I read a book called Reversals, by a woman who<br/>
considered herself dyslexic and had only learned to read well (after having<br/>
sort of snuck her way through school, relying a lot on her memory) when her<br/>
husband found out she couldnt.<br/>
<br/>
I dont know whether Id recommend the book now or not, since I read it long<br/>
before I had any ideas on the subject. But I do remember that when she was a<br/>
little girl, her grandmother used to have her read aloud and then throw the<br/>
book at her head when she made a mistake. I wondered, even way back then (I<br/>
was a teenager) just what was cause and what was effect in her particular<br/>
case.<br/>
<br/>
I love stories told from the inside of whatever disability or other<br/>
condition is under discussion. Thanks for yours, Diana. Tell us more.<br/>
