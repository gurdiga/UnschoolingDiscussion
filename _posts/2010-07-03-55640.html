<div id="ygrps-yiv-454356931">I know this has come and gone over the years, and there was a book,  <br/>
and sites have sprung up and died out.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything good and current?  A discussion list?  A blog?  A  <br/>
NING?  Some of all?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to have it on hand. I have my second-this-week need to know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
