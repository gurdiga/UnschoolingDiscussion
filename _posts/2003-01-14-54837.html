I checked out the Karl Bundy site last night.  It is very helpful,<br/>
especially the bibliographies and some of the articles.  I&#39;m listing it<br/>
again so that some of the new people can check it out too.  But I don&#39;t<br/>
think he&#39;s an unschooler.<br/>

colleges.  That&#39;s why I recommended Cafi Cohen and Karl Bunday, who have <br/>
specific interests in that.<br/>
