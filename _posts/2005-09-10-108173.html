Joyce Fetteroll has created a well-organized (naturally) and clear set of <br/>
responses to an assortment of questions and arguments over the past few years, <br/>
and made them available.    Please save this link and put it where you can find <br/>
it when people want to read (or argue about) unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Pages like this will make lists like this obsolete, but honestly that <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be such a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
The sections are<br/>
Unschooling<br/>
Learning<br/>
Deschooling<br/>
School Subjects<br/>
Math<br/>
Reading<br/>
History<br/>
Video Games<br/>
Television<br/>
Doubters and Reluctance<br/>
Socialization<br/>
Parenting<br/>
Respect<br/>
Chores<br/>
Food<br/>
Influencing child behavior<br/>
Commitment, obligations, responsibilities<br/>
No More Spanking<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a beautifully conceived and efficient site.   Joyce might be too shy to <br/>
promote it here, but I&#39;m not!<br/>

Well there it is - the FAQ page that has sometimes come up as being a need<br/>
waiting to be fulfilled. It really is lovely, and I can see myself stopping<br/>
by whenever I have some spare time, or want to reinvigorate my thinking. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Joyce.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-490151769"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; It&#39;s a beautifully conceived and efficient site.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you! It&#39;s the engineer in me which maybe is why my writing  <br/>
tends to appeal to men. Just the facts straight up :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway to get it in book form?  Hint Hint Hint &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm. I guess I could do the Lulu thing Sandra and Rue did. Hmm.<br/>
<br/>
*If* I were to do that, I&#39;m in a quandary what to do about the  <br/>
quotes. I left them as they were sent to the lists but it goes  <br/>
against my nature to see typos and misspellings in print ;-) Maybe  <br/>
just clean up the obvious typos?<br/>

do clean up blatant misspellings and I repair punctuation, usually.    <br/>
<br/>
Especially, though, if you&#39;re taking short quotes anonymously, just in the <br/>
form of typical questions asked, you could change it however you wanted to.    <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I thought. But way way back when I thought of writing a  <br/>
book I was tweaking the quotes *just a little* and realized I&#39;d lost  <br/>
something. The questions were starting to sound too much like they&#39;d  <br/>
been tailored to lead into the answer. Or they were sounding like I&#39;d  <br/>
written them or something. I think that raw panicky feeling is often  <br/>
necessary to get the point of the answer since that&#39;s where people  <br/>
are coming from ;-) So I have to keep a rein on my urge to fix!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034354357">Hi,<br/>
 <br/>
I loved the site! I&#39;m hoping to get my ex-husband to read it and work toward being open to unschooling our son. In the meantime I&#39;m on every list lurking and learning.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I wonder if I could just nitpick a tiny bit... rejoycing is actually spelled rejoicing...unless of course you consciously chose the other way :-)<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you so much for creating this site!<br/>

<h4>Joyce Fetteroll</h4>
<p><small><time>17 Sep 2005, at 10:19am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-676905222">I&#39;ve been having this burning desire to do writing prompts recently  <br/>
so I started a list for kids *and* adults. I&#39;ll post a weekly prompt  <br/>
and people can post their writings to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Just send an email to: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingWriters-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingWriters-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Home page is: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingWriters">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingWriters</a><br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the list description:<br/>
<br/>
============<br/>
<br/>
A list for anyone who likes to write. All ages welcome. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I will post weekly writing prompts. You don&#39;t need to be an  <br/>
unschooler to join in but the flavor of the list will be creative  <br/>
rather than formal.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found many writing prompts tend to favor contemporary settings,  <br/>
writing about present day average people. My personal bent is towards  <br/>
fantasy, science fiction, historical mysteries and recently manga  <br/>
(Japanese comics.) Everyone is encouraged to take the writing prompts  <br/>
in any direction they wish.<br/>
<br/>
Please do comment on other&#39;s writing. Tell them what you liked. If  <br/>
something is unclear, ask! Avoid criticism such as &quot;That really stinks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Most important is having fun :-)<br/>
<br/>
Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
<br/>
PS: All new members will be moderated until your first post so I can  <br/>
catch spam before it reaches the list. So if your first post doesn&#39;t  <br/>
show up right away, it&#39;s probably because I only check the pending  <br/>
messages once a day. Don&#39;t worry. It will show up! :-)<br/>
<br/>
============<br/>
<br/>
The first writing prompt is:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Until ____, nothing had ever happened in the village of Fool&#39;s Knock.<br/>
<br/>
