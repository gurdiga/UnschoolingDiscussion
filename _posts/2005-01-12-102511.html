Hi all,<br/>
I dont remember who wrote the above but I must haved missed this trick . Can you guiys please let me in on the Times table tricks? I would like to &quot;learn&quot; them better myself!<br/>
And also, you guys have been talking about a book or a movie...someone was saying they saw it for a birthday one year and it was the best birthday they ever had. Can you also please tell me what that was...I have been soooo backed up with emails, I have had people coming from other states to stay with us all month long and into Feb too! I am enjoining them just missing the posts.<br/>
Have a great day all,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-490013378">On my &quot;Math Blog&quot; I have this:<br/>
<br/>
7 X 8<br/>
  For some reason, this is the multiplication fact that almost everybody <br/>
has trouble remembering. So - here is a little quick way to remember <br/>
it. Just count: 5, 6, 7, 8.<br/>
<br/>
Why does that remind you of how to multiply 7 X 8?<br/>
<br/>
Because 56 is 7X8 -- 5, 6, 7, 8.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is more on multiplying on the blog - including a finger trick for <br/>
figuring the sixes, sevens, eights, and nines. It takes a little <br/>
concentration to go through the steps and figure it out - much easier <br/>
if I could show it to you, not write out each step, but it is fun for <br/>
lots of kids and usually once they know the trick, they remember it. <br/>
(Unlike some of us grown-ups, who forget how to do it quickly. &lt;G&gt;)<br/>

 <br/>
Monty Python and the Holy Grail.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s one kind of sexual scene, but little kids won&#39;t get it.<br/>
And there&#39;s a gory cartoonish-blood one-on-one battle scene.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s generally not the kind of humor little kids get. Mine always wandered  <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago when I got my first VCR, that was the tape Keith bought me to  go <br/>
with it.<br/>
I sneaked a tape recorder into a theatre to record it, in the 70&#39;s when it  <br/>
was new.<br/>
 <br/>
The DVD&#39;s cool because you can put on the subtitles to get the jokes where  <br/>
the goofy regional English (or French) accents make the words hard to catch  <br/>
the first time.<br/>
 <br/>
There are songs. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
