WOW those two things are hard to read.<br/>
<br/>
I believe maybe the second person said<br/>
You&#39;re right, maybe they would have a problem.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This was me.  What I was trying to say is that the people who said they <br/>
WOULD allow certain things meant what they said.  Reading it a second time, <br/>
I realize that wasn&#39;t very clear on my part.  I understood her post to say <br/>
that people on the list who *said* they would allow certain things wouldn&#39;t <br/>
*actually* allow those things when it came right down to it.  The quote <br/>
above...&quot;I&#39;m not so sure they wouldn&#39;t&quot;...came from my understanding of what <br/>
I read.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that clears things up.  It did sound a bit screwy, didn&#39;t it? :)  It <br/>
still probably sounds screwy but I did my best!<br/>
