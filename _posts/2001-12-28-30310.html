 </span></blockquote>Sarah, I&#39;ve done my share of poor-parenting also. Maybe even more than my <br/>
share (not sure, mother-guilt can alter one&#39;s perception).<br/>
<br/>
Working on your parenting skills is all a kid can ask for. So don&#39;t be so <br/>
hard on yourself. I know at times I am, and I have to remind myself that <br/>
as long as I keep learning and observing, it will be alright.<br/>
<br/>
Even though my son was unschooled and had attachment parenting from the <br/>
start, I didn&#39;t always make the better choice. Sometimes I still don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Its not easy to ALWAYS think with one&#39;s higher self, instead of one&#39;s <br/>
childhood-trauma self.<br/>
<br/>
Keep observing and keep learning.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve come to realize that the manual is in the form of experience, hence <br/>
why the midwives, the hospitals or the doulas don&#39;t give them out *smile*.<br/>
<br/>
warm regards,<br/>
