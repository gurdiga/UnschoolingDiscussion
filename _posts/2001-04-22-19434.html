<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138469942">Hi,  I am new to this list.  I have 2 daughters Jessie 9 and Sara 6.  My<br/>
good friend Rachel (who is on this list) has planted the seed of<br/>
unschooling.   I have used Oak Meadow for 4 years.  Here is the problem I<br/>
have been in a puplic school ISP for 3 of the 4 years we homeschooled.  Next<br/>
year we will be in a private ISP.  I need some ideas on how to make our<br/>
homeschool more relaxed.  I know this sounds silly but I feel that I need to<br/>
detox myself.  I feel they have brainwashed me lol... into thinking things<br/>
need to be taught a certain way in order for my girls to learn.  I would<br/>
really like to know how you conduct your weeks of learning?  Please!! :o)  I<br/>
need some help relaxing my homeschool I am to structured in everything I do<br/>
(I am working on it lol...)  Thanks in advance Erica</div>

&lt;&lt; Sandra... something just occurred to me....<br/>
I don&#39;t remember you ever mentioning doubts...have you had them like the rest <br/>
of us?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have never had a stomach-wrenching, sleep-loss look-for-a-curriculum attack <br/>
of doubt.<br/>
<br/>
I have had the thoughts-flit-through doubts.<br/>
<br/>
Of course with Kirby it was worst, as he was the oldest.  I was afraid the <br/>
inlaws would call the county because he was eight and not reading fluently.  <br/>
No matter that half or more of the third graders at school weren&#39;t either, <br/>
Kirby was in a one-on-one situation with a trained teacher.  When Kirby <br/>
started reading well and quickly (kind of all of a sudden, which probably <br/>
happens with schoolkids too but it doesn&#39;t show because it&#39;s all charted and <br/>
credited differently) I calmed down enough to last through two other kids.<br/>
<br/>
The other two both read later than Kirby did.<br/>
<br/>
If I could take anything back at this point the first to go would be that <br/>
there were two and a half reading lessons with Kirby, where I sat and had him <br/>
read through books aloud with my help.  HORROR.  I wish I could roll it back.<br/>
<br/>
The third time I quit and never ever did that again.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s eleven and can read just about anything he picks up.  He doesn&#39;t pick <br/>
up novels.<br/>
<br/>
Holly is nine and a half.  She is on the brink.  Sometimes she will read a <br/>
whole phrase or sentence at a glance and say &quot;I READ IT!&quot;  She doesn&#39;t really <br/>
count sounding out phonetically.  Neither do I.  I can do that with French <br/>
and German and Spanish, but I cannot *read* (fluently, for meaning) those <br/>
languages.  I can sludge through some Spanish or French enough to get the <br/>
gist (sometimes wrong) and to ask a reader to read the passage I&#39;ve found to <br/>
me (like in reference books when I&#39;m looking for a piece of information on <br/>
something medieval, has been the experience; it happened yesterday).  <br/>
<br/>
When she can look at written English and it gives her information, as spoken <br/>
English does, she&#39;ll be reading.  I have not the slightest doubt that this <br/>
will happen within a year.  If I&#39;m wrong and it takes a year and a half, I <br/>
will still go to sleep happy every night, because the things she thinks <br/>
about, her logic, her awareness, are past sufficient to impress me or anyone. <br/>
  I know kids her age who are reading Harry Potter all by themselves who <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be able to discuss it, find England on a globe, or connect it with <br/>
any other literature.  It&#39;s not a crime nor a horror, until they or their <br/>
parents start to criticize me or my kids for their late reading.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we were talking about the words and phrases she didn&#39;t understand <br/>
in &quot;Little Shop of Horrors.&quot;  <br/>
&quot;Though they&#39;re sloppin&#39; the trough for you.&quot;<br/>
We discussed what it meant literally and figuratively.<br/>
<br/>
She can discuss the complicated rhyme scheme in &quot;Downtown&quot; on that.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;purified&quot; in &quot;Suddenly Seymore, he purified me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;condescend&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We discussed why &quot;a fence of real chain link&quot; would appeal to Audrey, and it <br/>
had to do with Skid Row, urban realities, the new-then suburbs and what <br/>
having a fenced yard meant.  Holly was surprised that chain link was cool <br/>
then.  I remember.  Chain link replaced wooden posts and hogwire (or more <br/>
expensive wooden fences) in the fencing of yards in the 1960&#39;s and it was <br/>
cool!<br/>
<br/>
We talked about &quot;rationale&quot; and justifications.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about &quot;reservations&quot; and &quot;mutilations.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Rationale&quot; and &quot;reservations&quot; aren&#39;t easy to define, to a kid, in a car, <br/>
with rock&#39;n&#39;roll playing. &lt;g&gt;   But she got it.<br/>
<br/>
Mutilation can range from a really bad facial scar to being chopped up beyond <br/>
recognition.  I hadn&#39;t thought about that until Holly asked.<br/>
<br/>
Things like that kill my little doubts two to one.<br/>
<br/>
I worry (not much) that Marty will resent not being at school to do sports, <br/>
someday in retrospect.  But when  he played ice hockey one year he didn&#39;t <br/>
like the competition or the locker room.  I ask him from time to time if he&#39;s <br/>
interested in any of the city league stuff, soccer or football.  He says no.  <br/>
<br/>
I sometimes think Kirby might not get a good job.  Then I remember he HAS a <br/>
job (part time, but still) which was offered to him, at a place where two men <br/>
with a wife and a child each work.  <br/>
<br/>
With Holly the doubts are the least.  She&#39;s sweet and personable, and in her <br/>
I see the greatest advantages to the sheltering from cruelty and the <br/>
comparisons that go on at school.<br/>
<br/>
The answer is yes about doubts but &quot;like other people,&quot; maybe no.<br/>
<br/>
Having taught and having been trained to open classroom help.<br/>
Involvement in the SCA where people learn master&#39;s degree amounts of stuff <br/>
&quot;for nothing&quot; (maybe an award or a prize once in a while) helps.<br/>
Having read TONS of Growing Without Schooling, John Holt, Home Education <br/>
Magazine, the old Prodigy homeschooling forum, the AOL homeschooling forum <br/>
when it was in its glorious prime, and unschooling.com help.<br/>
Having been to conferences and seen and talked to unschooled teens helps.<br/>

haven&#39;t always unschooled, but I&#39;ve always leaned toward waiting until the kids 
we&#39;re &#39;ready&#39; before going ahead.&nbsp; In our family, this has meant late 
readers.&nbsp; When we &#39;did curriculum&#39; I read everything to them. The oldest, 
didn&#39;t read until about 8 1/2.&nbsp; She went from not reading&nbsp; to reading 
at &#39;grade level&#39; in one week. Now at 14, she reads anything and everything all 
the time. The next was also a late reader but with some learning problems thrown 
in. She never had that &#39;taking off&#39; experience.&nbsp; She&#39;s 12 and can read well 
enough to get the info she wants but rarely reads for pleasure. My 9, almost 10 
year old son is just starting to read.&nbsp; No problems with him, he just 
doesn&#39;t want to.&nbsp; He despises books written for beginning readers.&nbsp; We 
have always read what he is interested in which is way beyond most kids his 
age.&nbsp; His vocabulary is incredably high.&nbsp; I know that when he has a 
real reason, his reading will &#39;take off&#39;. My 5 yos is begging to read, and has 
figured a lot of it out.&nbsp; At his request we are loosely going through 
&quot;Teach your child to read in 100 lessons&quot;. It is so encouraging for me hear of 
late readers.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know many unschoolers, and even less who have late 
readers.&nbsp; I know people question the &#39;wisdom&#39; of my choices and 
occasionally, so do I. Please keep sharing this sort of thing, especially the 
ordinary achievements of kids.&nbsp; In my heart, I know that unschooling is 
best for my kids but there is so much emphasis on the high achieving 
homeschoolers that my average kids start to look &#39;behind&#39;.&nbsp; And I know, I 
know...I&#39;m not supposed to compare but there are those days of 
doubting....</span></font></div>

 best for my kids but there is so much emphasis on the high achieving<br/>
 homeschoolers that my average kids start to look &#39;behind&#39;.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
     I feel this way, too.  My just turned 9 yr old has trouble with a lot of <br/>
basic reasoning/logic and his ability to hold a pen/pencil/crayon and write <br/>
anything (a shape, a letter) is really weak.  My other kids (3 older and 1 <br/>
younger) are really different, more intellectual I guess (I know it&#39;s not <br/>
good to compare; I&#39;m just telling the truth about my feelings right now), and <br/>
I feel like it&#39;s harder for me to relate to him, which makes me feel guilty.  <br/>
For the last three years, most of what we&#39;ve done with him is definitely an <br/>
unschooling approach but sometimes I worry if I should do more and lately I <br/>
have tried the having him read out loud with me filling in words from a book <br/>
that Sandra talked about.  We also did some of that Teach Your CHild to Read <br/>
in 100 Easy Lessons but he didn&#39;t like it and never really grasped it.  He <br/>
seems to do a lot better with memorizing words and likes it more.<br/>
     Anyway, I&#39;m wondering if anyone has suggestions for this situation.  I <br/>
know if he was in school, they&#39;d have him in special ed., which is one of the <br/>
many reasons I&#39;m so glad he&#39;s never been there.  He is a happy kid who loves <br/>
to run around, ride his bike, and watch movies (he&#39;d watch them one after <br/>
another if I let him but I did start limiting him to one a day on most days <br/>
because it seemed like he became more creative about how to spend his time).  <br/>
He has a lot of trouble with the fine motor skills as well as the logic of <br/>
things like Legos, Lincoln Logs, even Brios.  Anyone&#39;s ideas would be <br/>
welcome...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136282223">I still have a lot of deschooling to do myself.  I do have lots of things<br/>
laying around that I got because they were &quot;educational&quot; and looked like<br/>
fun to me.  I strive to let the kids use them in any way they wish. <br/>
Tonight, Lisa (8) got out the cuisenaire rods and I thought (oh, good!)<br/>
but managed to keep my mouth shut.  When I asked her to put them away for<br/>
dinner (because they were on the kitchen table) she offered to tell me<br/>
what she&#39;d been doing.  She was rolling a die, then taking that number of<br/>
cubes.  Then she found the rod that was that same length, and used it in<br/>
her pattern.  She told me that she had to use the number that came up,<br/>
and figure out a way to make it fit.  This was the first time that she<br/>
had used the rods in any number representation.  She loves to just make<br/>
designs with them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086778444">I think I agree with this. Because when I first joined<br/>
this group, I was asking about limiting computer time.<br/>
If anyone remembers? And people said a lot of things,<br/>
but basically I didn&#39;t limit anything available in our<br/>
house. And now, my son who was playing this pharaoh<br/>
game all day, has branched out into other areas of<br/>
ancient egyptian culture. And so it was only a short<br/>
while that he was obsessed with this game, while it<br/>
was still new. Juli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097591821">How do we conduct our weeks, someone asked (sorry,<br/>
deleted it when I meant to quote it).<br/>
<br/>
Our week is structured by my son&#39;s paper route and my<br/>
husband&#39;s job. The paper route is always the same time<br/>
and dh&#39;s work is flexible, but fairly regular. We also<br/>
have two days we call library days, which are Monday<br/>
and Friday. We sometimes miss those and sometimes we<br/>
go more often. We have homeschool group on Tuesdays.<br/>
We grocery shop on Tuesdays, though that can be<br/>
flexible, too. Piano lessons on Wednesdays, dd&#39;s art<br/>
group on Thursdays. My book group on Fridays. <br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m getting at is it&#39;s our activities we<br/>
choose, the ones that have regular times to them, that<br/>
lend structure to our days. We don&#39;t have getting up<br/>
and going to bed times. We eat at BASICALLY the same<br/>
time of day. But we don&#39;t plan units or study hours or<br/>
any of that stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps some... Juli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713175051"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I would<br/>
&gt; really like to know how you conduct your weeks of learning?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t conduct our weeks of learning. We just live our lives. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Some weeks are lives are busy, full of other people, things to do and places<br/>
to go. Other weeks we vegetate at home, eat a great deal, sleep a great<br/>
deal.  There is a rhythm to our lives. There is a  rhythm to the children&#39;s,<br/>
tied mainly to their internal growth spurts.<br/>
<br/>
If I conduct anything, it&#39;s more an attempt to harmonize than anything else.<br/>
I buy materials; i.e., glue, clay, paper, pens, computer programs,<br/>
computers, bikes, hammers, books, Dr. Pepper, video games.  With some cycles<br/>
I drive a great deal.  Some weeks my boys build a great deal, other weeks<br/>
they are tied to their computers. My youngest should have been named Pooh,<br/>
for she just asks questions.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the problem I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have been in a puplic school ISP for 3 of the 4 years we homeschooled.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Next<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; year we will be in a private ISP.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you in California?<br/>
<br/>
 I need some ideas on how to make our<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; homeschool more relaxed.  I know this sounds silly but I feel that I need<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; detox myself.  I feel they have brainwashed me lol... into thinking things<br/>
&gt; need to be taught a certain way in order for my girls to learn.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not at all silly.  You HAVE been brainwashed.  By people who earn their<br/>
living selling you the priviledge of being brainwahsed.   Take a minute to<br/>
think about how your girls learn about your religious beliefs... not the<br/>
doctrine of the church you belong to (or do not belong to) but rather your<br/>
personal take on things?  Before the invention of the modern high school how<br/>
did girls learn to cook? keep house?  sew?  run their own side businesses?<br/>
How did anyone learn to drive a car? A tractor?   Why on earth would<br/>
learning the *facts* of history or science or reading good books need what<br/>
we have created?<br/>
<br/>
Learning and Teaching have been going on since time began.  The current<br/>
public set up, as a billion dollar a year industry, is not about Teaching<br/>
and Learning, it&#39;s about economics and fear.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please!! :o)  I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; need some help relaxing my homeschool I am to structured in everything I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>do<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (I am working on it lol...)  Thanks in advance Erica<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here are some questions. Why are you structured in everything you do? Is<br/>
this just you innate nature? Or are you living in a state of fear and guilt,<br/>
where you need to &quot;prove&quot; productivity?  Do you have children that are just<br/>
like you, or are they very different?<br/>
<br/>
I used to be an US Army paratrooper. I still roll my socks. &lt;G&gt;  But my<br/>
ability to function in that way doesn&#39;t mesh too well with my children.  I<br/>
also had 3 children in 4 years. It was apparent very quickly that I wasn&#39;t<br/>
going to be able to keep up with the mess..  Strangely enough, I&#39;m<br/>
struggling with returning to my old ways now that the children are older.<br/>
There is a way to structure *yourself*, without it bleeding onto the<br/>
children and their education.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best things you can do is to begin or return to a hobby that is<br/>
all yours. Keep yourself busy and leanring, the children will learn by your<br/>
example.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Lest anyone read just this and think I was recommending it, I wasn&#39;t; I <br/>
was <br/>
 lamenting having done it with Kirby, in a horrible lapse of sense, years ago.<br/>

about it as something I am trying to figure out myself.<br/>
     Well, after writing about his logic problems with Legos and all that in <br/>
the other post, Sean shocked me this morning by coming over to me with these <br/>
really cool things he made with Legos.  He has never made anything with them; <br/>
he always bugged his older brother to make things for him.  At least that&#39;s <br/>
what I had always seen.  He came over with a helicoptor and a rocket!  So <br/>
strike another point for unschooling!  Maybe I just need to stop worrying <br/>
about him and keep letting him learn at his own pace, in his own ways.  <br/>
     It&#39;s strange; I know these things and I believe in them, yet because <br/>
Sean has been different than what I was used to with my other kids, I allowed <br/>
myself to wonder if the principles somehow didn&#39;t apply completely.   I feel <br/>
like I should know better but it seems like we&#39;re always growing, and never <br/>
just &quot;there.&quot;<br/>
