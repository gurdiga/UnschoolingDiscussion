<div id="ygrps-yiv-908344018">Ooo I had a Midwife named Heather attend my second birth, first at home.   She moved to BC afterwards as did two others.  Was she Blond, early-mid thirties two sons born early -mid 90&#39;s??  All the midwives in Alberta have changed since the government became involved.  When I had the first at home it was $800.00, then two years later after the regulations were in the process of taking over $1200, Then two years later $2000.  Because of that I ended up looking into UAbirth but kinda chickened out at the last minute, then I had a very odd labour(for me) and Baby arrived before the midwife.  So she charged us only for the  visits and a &#39;house call&#39;.  Not bad.  I miss my first two midwives though.  :-(<br/>

<br/>
Not the one I was talking about.  She was in Victoria doing her training.<br/>
She&#39;s got a teenaged daughter, I think.  When she finished her training, the<br/>
local midwives had decided that there were enough midwives and wouldn&#39;t let<br/>
her practice here.  The College of Midwives has a huge amount of power, some<br/>
of the politics I was talking about.  She ended up moving to the mainland,<br/>
maybe White Rock.<br/>
<br/>
All the midwives in Alberta have changed since the government became<br/>
involved.  When I had the first at home it was $800.00, then two years later<br/>
after the regulations were in the process of taking over $1200, Then two<br/>
years later $2000.  Because of that I ended up looking into UAbirth but<br/>

and a &#39;house call&#39;.  Not bad.  I miss my first two midwives though.  :-(<br/>
<br/>
So the AB government licenced them but doesn&#39;t cover their care?  At least<br/>
in BC it&#39;s part of the medical plan, so pretty much anyone can have a<br/>
midwife.<br/>

Yup.  They licensed them so that they could have hours of paper work, stupid rules that make their work less effective, and have to pay $15,000.00 Plus a Year in insurance.  I was seriously thinking of going into midwifery before but I couldn&#39;t deal with the crap that&#39;s dealt out.  I preferred the old days when they just did the best they could and the Dr.s stayed out of their way.  There are perks know though.  They can write prescriptions and admit patient to the hospital and the OB no longer has jurisdiction over the patient.  Some of them also get to have a reason to charge more.   <br/>
