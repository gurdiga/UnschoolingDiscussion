<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881741072">&lt;&lt; I was half way through the second paragraph, above and the voice in my<br/>
 head was saying &quot;&lt;snip&gt; A youth who rises to Levels 4, 5 and 6 can<br/>
 become a...&quot; and I finished the sentence with &quot;become a Nazi&quot;.  And I<br/>
 think the rest of the paragraph supports that conclusion.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

OPT for this?  <br/>

Who&#39;s unschooling a teenager?  Do we actually avoid a lot of the teenage <br/>
rebellion crap because they basically don&#39;t have much to rebel against, or is <br/>
that just wishful thinking on my part?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it has a lot to do with relationship. I know a family where <br/>
the kids had lots of freedom at home (though they were in P.S. and <br/>
one dropped out at age 16) and their mom was really involved in their <br/>
lives. As close to an unschooling atmosphere as possible, while still <br/>
participating in the school system. Though they didn&#39;t have lots of <br/>
structure, they never rebelled. They&#39;re into a very cool hobby called <br/>
Daggerhaus ??? where they do medieval fighting, making their armor <br/>
and weapons by medieval techniques (blunted weapons). They&#39;re a bunch <br/>
of pretty cool guys, self-confident, happy young men with jobs, etc. <br/>
Heading into adulthood with what looks like a pretty good sense of <br/>
themselves. <br/>
<br/>
I also know a family where there&#39;s lots of structure, and the mom and <br/>
dad are really involved in their lives, and their kids never rebelled <br/>
but have gone on to do some pretty cool stuff (like, earned a Mary <br/>
Kay car by age 21, for their oldest; position as a youth judge for <br/>
their soon to graduate homeschooled 18 year old, etc.) They&#39;re a <br/>
bunch of pretty cool kids, hard workers, friendly, self-confident and <br/>
happy, making lives for themselves (except the 11 year old who is <br/>
still being homeschooled) and going the directions that THEY want to <br/>
go. I&#39;m watching and waiting with that family, to a certain extent. <br/>
Wondering if there&#39;s a &quot;mid-life crisis&quot; coming along for those kids, <br/>
having a goal oriented, dynamic, energetic mom who guided them to <br/>
always try for the highest marks available. But so far, no rebellion <br/>
in that family, either.<br/>

My son Conor is 14 in a couple of weeks, so we&#39;re just at the <br/>
beginning of the whole teen thing. What I&#39;ve noticed is that there <br/>
isn&#39;t an us vs. them mentality. He talks with me, he respects my <br/>
opinion on a lot of things. We have real conversations.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think unschooling makes us immune to teenage experimentation, <br/>
but as you said, what does he have to rebel against? I&#39;m on his side.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

Me.  two of them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Do we actually avoid a lot of the teenage <br/>
rebellion crap because they basically don&#39;t have much to rebel against...? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Keith shared that article (I forwarded it to him) with another guy at work <br/>
who said he wished he&#39;d known about that place for HIS stepson, who is at the <br/>
moment in some vaguely similar place in Texas.  Not like a prison or boot <br/>
camp, but a behavior modification place.  He&#39;s in voluntarily, and it&#39;s not a <br/>
lock-up, but if he leaves, he won&#39;t have the protection of being in rehab, <br/>
and he has legal problems.  He&#39;s just past school age, I think.  Late teens.<br/>
<br/>
This other dad thought that spanking kids more earlier would prevent some of <br/>
these teenaged problems.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Keith whether he objected and whether the guy took it well.  They <br/>
talked about the 19th century and whether things were different or better <br/>
then, and whether all families spanked.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how it all went, but Keith said they talk about that kind of <br/>
thing a lot and so it wasn&#39;t an emotional conversation.<br/>
