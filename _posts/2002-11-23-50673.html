<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616381899">when you go to the boards, click on &lt;New messages&gt;<br/>
cloick on &lt;new since I last checked for messages&gt; after making sure that the <br/>
drop down box reads &lt;all threads&gt;and the button for &lt;show as message tree&gt; is <br/>
checked. You have to be registered with a user name and password, have you <br/>
done that?<br/>
Once you have done the above, all the latest postings  will show.<br/>
Start at the top , click on a thread, reading the whole page and use your <br/>
browsers&#39; back button to return to the previous page. Keep moving back &forth <br/>
through the pages and it will work out.<br/>

ps. Even though you have a hard time navigating, maybe your daughter (?) <br/>
won&#39;t!<br/>

<br/>
Use &quot;new messages&quot; at the bottom, and just read since a little before you <br/>
last posted.  Then you&#39;ll only see new things.</div>
