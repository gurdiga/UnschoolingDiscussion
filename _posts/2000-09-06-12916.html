 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know who you contact or even if you can do anything about it.  Apparently that is accurate though.  I went there and checked it out.  There are not messages in their archives, and the group was formed Aug. 29 of this year.  Also they put the description (which is translated word for word above in Valerie&#39;s post,) in french.  My french was good enough to translate and verify that it does indeed say what Valerie reported.  I suppose they thought to hide their intent by putting it in french...who knows?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-346699928">There was a warning recently on another list about kidsporn, which <br/>
has since been taken off egroups, apparently due to a mail-bomb of <br/>
epic proportions landing at egroups&#39;s support inbox *g*  So I <br/>
suggest that everyone forwards it on to every other egroup they&#39;re <br/>
on and get it stopped.  I&#39;m assuming that there&#39;s a prominent link <br/>
at egroups for &#39;support,&#39; or opinion or feedback or whatever.  <br/>
Anyhow, I&#39;m just off to send this to all the ones I know about.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-498152009">There is a site I just found called protecting the world&#39;s children. It seems <br/>
to be a watch dog group.  I reported the egroup someone posted about earlier, <br/>
but 50 more.  It&#39;s disgusting.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-145920827">I called the local FBI office and gave them the egoups web site as well as <br/>
the URL&#39;s there were promoting.  They were VERY eager to get the information <br/>
and it appears that this kind of crime is a hot priority for them right now.  <br/>
They also indicated that they were already familiar with the web site I gave <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I hope eGroups gets so tired of this that they do away with the porn <br/>
altogether.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002229897">Ther&#39;s got to be something to do, someone to write with.  This is just<br/>
UNACCEPTABLE.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s illegal to TALK about it on an emai<br/>
list, and I don&#39;t want to be the &quot;thought police&quot; for the world, but some<br/>
things are just indefensible.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll look into it, too, when I get a chance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546833232">After I posted this, I fell asleep, and haven&#39;t been back to the <br/>
&#39;puter since!  So I haven&#39;t posted it.  But it made me wonder <br/>
whether these are genuine paedophile groups or someone with a <br/>
grudge against egroups who wants people to fill up their support <br/>
inbox for no good reason.  I told dh this and he said that he <br/>
thought such people would keep themselves &#39;lower profile.&#39;  <br/>
Hmm.  What do you all think?<br/>
