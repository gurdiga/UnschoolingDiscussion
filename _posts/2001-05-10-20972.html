him off of it permanently. He dislikes water and wants his instant tea that <br/>
is so sugary.  My little one will just drink water and likes water but when <br/>
his Papa has that tea, of course he wants some and I think it is soo bad for <br/>
him. Tell me how you got your husband on something else, please :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115900146">Well, I first started by replacing his instant yuck, oops, iced tea, with<br/>
orange pekoe that I brewed.  Then I slowly replaced that with an orange<br/>
pekoe and green tea combo.  Next step was a green tea with lemon grass which<br/>
is a tea that takes little or nothing to make it sweet and is really good<br/>
with homemade lemon ice cubes.<br/>
<br/>
Then comes the hard step, no more tea bags.  There are a few of ways to do<br/>
this--the gold plated method (not us &lt;g&gt;) where you buy the organic tea in<br/>
unbleached tea bags, the economy method (using unbleached cheese cloth to<br/>
hold the tea leaves), the other economy method (using those tea holder<br/>
thingys you see on proper English type shows &lt;g&gt;) or the REALLY cheap method<br/>
(that&#39;s me &lt;g&gt;) where you dump the tea leaves in and when the tea is ready<br/>
you strain it into another jar.<br/>
<br/>
Now that we finally have sun again, we will be back to making sun tea on the<br/>
deck (glass jug, spring water and green tea left outside in the sun).  Now<br/>
that is good tea!!!<br/>
<br/>
It is really a hoot because you would think he had invented the whole thing<br/>
himself and he is the best advertisement!  He just raves on and on about it<br/>
so you would never know getting him to change was almost as hard as if I<br/>
said he was going to have a bikini wax or something equally as dreadful!!!<br/>
So, there is hope &lt;g&gt;<br/>
