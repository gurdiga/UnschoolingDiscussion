<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993817612">I was just wondering how to handle this. I live in a state where home schooled children must be tested every 3 years, starting in 3rd grade. My oldest daughter will be considered to be in the 3rd grade next school year. Not having a college degree; I&#39;m not allowed to test her myself. How should I prepare her for this. She and I have talked about the test but she has no interest in it. She&#39;s very bright but her lack of interest and knowledge in mathematical concepts is where my concern lies. Am I being silly? Thanks in advance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, first, the best place to ask is a local group. Some states  <br/>
require tests be taken but the scores are never turned in. Some  <br/>
states only require a 30% on the test. But that&#39;s something for your  <br/>
local group to discuss. There are people on this list from India and  <br/>
South Africa and Australia and the minutiae of state laws isn&#39;t of  <br/>
international interest or help.<br/>
<br/>
But in general, the more casual you can be, the better. The more you  <br/>
worry about it, the more you worry over her worrying about it, the  <br/>
more likely she&#39;ll pick up on the tension in your voice and body and  <br/>
assume there&#39;s something to stress over.<br/>
<br/>
Tell her it&#39;s just something the state requires you to do to homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
The best medicine is being informed. (That goes for practically  <br/>
anything!)<br/>
<br/>
Help her be informed. Go over a practice test and look at the *type*  <br/>
of questions she&#39;ll be asked. Don&#39;t worry about content. Help her get  <br/>
informed about the style of the test.<br/>
<br/>
Give her some strategies like: On multiple choice, if she&#39;s not sure,  <br/>
tell her to eliminate (cross out in some way so that it doesn&#39;t look  <br/>
like she&#39;s picking them!) the ones she knows are wrong. If she&#39;s not  <br/>
sure of an answer, skip ahead. Do the ones she&#39;s most sure of first  <br/>
and go back to the ones she can eliminate most of the answers on.<br/>
<br/>
(BTW, there are loads of fun online quizzes that parents can show  <br/>
their kids. There&#39;s no need for a state test to be the first time a  <br/>
child sees a multiple choice question!<br/>
<br/>
Like:<br/>
What kind of Pokemon are you:<br/>

<br/>
Google &quot;online quiz&quot; and lots of sites will pop up. There are books  <br/>
with personality quizzes. All sorts of fun ways to be exposed to  <br/>
various test styles, strategies and rules.)<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think &quot;silly,&quot; but over-reacting.<br/>
Talk to other unschoolers in your state.  See what they&#39;re doing.  One  <br/>
of them might be able to be your test proctor (or whatever the law  <br/>
requires there), or there might be a sympathetic child psychologist  <br/>
who&#39;ll do it, but the locals will know.   That&#39;s not within the scope  <br/>
of this list.<br/>
<br/>
What IS an international and human reality is this:<br/>
She will learn more if you&#39;re relaxed and warm and soft than if you&#39;re  <br/>
tight and jittery and electrified.  So don&#39;t spend a year or part of a  <br/>
year or even a day or part of a day being terrified or frightened or  <br/>
feeling silly.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s my advice. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

But not a year before or six months before.  Maybe a day before. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
