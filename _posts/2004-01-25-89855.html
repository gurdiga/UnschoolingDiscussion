 </span></blockquote>because her boyfriend lives in Washington (we are in Texas)and they <br/>
only see each other every 5 or 6 months. Well .. . .he just turned 18 <br/>
and is planning to move here. His father has used bribes (money and a <br/>
car) to convince him to take his GED and enroll in college. His <br/>
father is willing to help him financially as long as he is in school. <br/>
His mother is also willing to help with his living expenses. This man <br/>
(aahhh! he is a man now) has been in my daughters life for almost 2 <br/>
years now and they have been discussing living together for the past <br/>
6 months or so. <br/>
<br/>
Right now I am managing to remain calm while pointing out that we <br/>
will not offer any financial assistance if she chooses to move out. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I think that&#39;s probably the WORST thing you could posibly do! <br/>
<br/>
Are you also willing to have her leave anyway, end up living in her <br/>
boyfriend&#39;s car, possibly pregnant because the choice that month was the birth control <br/>
pills or groceries, and then never call you again because you were so <br/>
insensitive? Because THAT *is* as possibility. It happens every day to girls and boys <br/>
all over the country. The USA is full of teens and young adults in that same <br/>
boat.<br/>
<br/>
If it were my daughter, I would offer to have her boyfriend bunk with us. <br/>
Maybe help him study for the GED  and help him enroll in the local univerity or <br/>
community/tech college (so his dad will keep his part of the bargain). He could <br/>
get a part-time job and go to school. They could share her bedroom (if that&#39;s <br/>
the deal) or a spare room or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
I would NEVER give an ultimatum that could possibly result in losing my child!<br/>

First of all I never issued an ulitimatum. We have discussed (though <br/>
I am sure she knew this already) that we are not in a position to <br/>
help her make a rent payment. And the choices are not between having <br/>
him &quot;bunk with us&quot; or live in his car. She has already helped him <br/>
study for his GED and he passed the test last week. His father wanted <br/>
him to get his GED so he has offered a car, money for the move and to <br/>
set him up in an apartment if he passed. When I said my daughter was <br/>
mature I was not kidding. She has done a lot of thinking on this <br/>
issue and has a game plan which doesn&#39;t involve living in a car or  <br/>
going without birth control.<br/>
