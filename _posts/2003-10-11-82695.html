<div id="ygrps-yiv-706315597">Thanks everyone for the different leads.... <br/>
<br/>
I had already known of those listed, perhaps I should have written <br/>
more about the active part. I have found quite a few sites including <br/>
yahoo groups for unschooling teenagers but none of them seem active <br/>
and in fact some of the links included in a website started by NBTS <br/>
teenagers are not in service. Maybe if we all told our kids about the <br/>
one at unschooling.com there would be a central place to get started. <br/>
It just seems like there are a lot of them but none are active which <br/>
is too bad because my daughter really enjoys interacting with other <br/>
unschooled teenagers. <br/>
<br/>
In her words after coming back from camp, she said that it was so <br/>
stimulating to be around other kids who follow their passions and <br/>
have so many interests.... Not only did it motivate her to rekindle <br/>
some of her passions (she has struggled being an unschooler <br/>
throughout her life as she tends towards being not very self-<br/>
motivated), it also was the reason she changed her mind about going <br/>
to high school next year for social reasons (she like other teens <br/>
really need peer interaction). She had signed up with a high school <br/>
correspondence school so that she could learn how to learn through <br/>
textbooks in preparation for going to school. After coming back from <br/>
camp she remarked that she didn&#39;t feel like her social needs would be <br/>
met going to school since the kids there are forced to conform by <br/>
peer pressure where she was so happy to be surrounded by individuals.<br/>
