<br/>
You&#39;re free to revel in your oversensitivity, but it&#39;s not so good for the <br/>
kids to pass those frustrations on.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;i havent learned anythign on this list in 2-3 days.......&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Was there a hurry?  Check www.unschooling.com if you have a quick need to <br/>
read about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;i wnat to echange ideas.i dont want to tell someone i ve done somethign <br/>
that WORKED HERE to be told NO ITS NOT UNSCHOOLING&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of things work that aren&#39;t unschooling.<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t work as well when other things are called unschooling <br/>
which aren&#39;t.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooling doesn&#39;t work as well when other things are called unschooling <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well - it WORKS just as well -- it is just a whole lot harder to pass on, <br/>
from one person to another, that it DOES work -- when people just call <br/>
whatever they do unschooling. There are things that are so obviously NOT <br/>
unschooling that it would be really confusing to let descriptions of them AS <br/>
unschooling just sit there. <br/>
<br/>
To get back to phonics -- what Ned posted about kids having to learn phonics <br/>
&quot;sounded&quot; like not-unschooling to me and to others and we pointed that out. <br/>
As I said before, it seemed inconsistent and misleading - I meant relative to <br/>
all the other great unschooling stuff that Luz and Ned have written.  To pass <br/>
along the idea that the only way kids can learn to read is by learning <br/>
phonics is going to make people think that they are going to mess up their <br/>
kids if they don&#39;t somehow &quot;do&quot; a phonics program. But, then what Ned posted <br/>
in response to the &quot;Can you teach me to read?&quot; question was not at all about <br/>
forcing a phonics program down a kid&#39;s throat - it was about gently providing <br/>
a bit of information about how sounds and letters work in response to a kid&#39;s <br/>
direct question and waiting to let the child take the lead on what he wants <br/>
to do with that information. It was much more like what I&#39;d expect from the <br/>
unschoolers that I know Ned and Luz to be.<br/>
<br/>
So - my complaint, Ned, if you&#39;re interested - is that you may be vastly <br/>
underestimating how very anxious people are about their young kids and <br/>
reading and how they will &quot;hear&quot; you when you say that kids have to learn <br/>
phonics to learn to read. I think they&#39;ll hear that as: &quot;Your kid will NOT <br/>
learn to read in a comfortable, relaxed, child-controlled/parent-facilitated, <br/>
idiosyncratic way that can develop solely out of being observant, aware, and <br/>
responsive parents without any formal, systematic, preplanned, <br/>
parent-directed program.&quot; I think it sounds to people like you are saying <br/>
that unschooling will not WORK with reading. Hence, all the responses about <br/>
all the kids who DID learn to read in unschooling families - no phonics <br/>
program or any OTHER kind of program, just supportive and responsive parents <br/>
paying attention to their own kids and helping them out.<br/>
<br/>
These days, &quot;phonics&quot; is not just &quot;learning to sound out words&quot; but is <br/>
synonymous, in most people&#39;s minds, with some kind of &quot;teach-a-kid-to-read&quot; <br/>
program - maybe thanks to the ubiquitous &quot;Hooked on Phonics&quot; and &quot;The Reading <br/>
Game&quot; and &quot;Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons&quot; and &quot;Reading Reflex&quot; <br/>
and so on. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents being responsive to their kid will notice when he/she <br/>
seems interested in the sounds of letters and are likely to give them some <br/>
help in their efforts. It doesn&#39;t ALWAYS come from the parents, of course. My <br/>
middle child, at 3 years old, apparently spent about 3 weeks nagging her poor <br/>
older sister while they &quot;read&quot; in their beds at night, &quot;What does THIS say? <br/>
P-O-P. What does THIS say? &quot;H-O-P&quot;&quot; and so on - until she&#39;d figured out the <br/>
sounds of the letters all by herself and could, seemingly by magic, read. I <br/>
didn&#39;t expect it, of course, and never saw it coming. A neighbor down the <br/>
street told me that Roxana could read - I didn&#39;t even KNOW it. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway - Ned - you might want to have a look at what you sent originally and <br/>
see why everyone reacted as if it was anti-unschooling advice. I&#39;m sure that, <br/>
to you, what you answered in regard to the &quot;I want to learn to read&quot; question <br/>
and what you wrote in that first post sounded the same - but they gave me a <br/>
very different sense of what you were suggesting.<br/>
