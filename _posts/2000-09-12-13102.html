<br/>
This is the greatest - we&#39;ve taught and taken part in classes for the <br/>
last 2 <br/>
semesters, and have had such a blast!  If you have any questions, <br/>
just let me <br/>
know and I&#39;ll see what I can do.  Hurry - Teacher Registration is <br/>
open until <br/>
September 22!<br/>

Foundation for Online Learning<br/>
<br/>
You are invited to visit The Foundation for Online Learning at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.netcollege.org/instructor/fol.">http://www.netcollege.org/instructor/fol.</a> We are a fairly new <br/>
organization <br/>
created <br/>
by home educators and we have had wonderful responses from people who <br/>
have joined us. The best part of FOL is that there are absolutely no <br/>
fees <br/>
involved in taking our courses. The only cost to you is your time! <br/>
The classes are free of charge.<br/>
<br/>
Our organization is a safe cooperative learning environment on the <br/>
web for<br/>
folks who enjoy teaching children. The majority of the participants in<br/>
these classes are home educators. We have a few teachers who are not <br/>
home<br/>
educators, but they willingly extend their abilities as teachers <br/>
within our<br/>
group. The idea is for a parent/teacher to choose a topic that they <br/>
would <br/>
like <br/>
to teach, and then teach the course using the Internet method of <br/>
their choice<br/>
(i.e., BBS, Email, ListServ, Website, Chatrooms, etc.). We will help <br/>
train<br/>
and/or give guidance on how to effectively use these methods of <br/>
teaching,<br/>
but the teacher has the freedom to choose their own course topic and<br/>
teaching method. We will give suggestions and mini-training courses <br/>
for any<br/>
teacher who would like to learn more about how to use the Internet to <br/>
teach<br/>
a course.<br/>
<br/>
At the appropriate time, you will be asked to submit a teacher bio <br/>
form,<br/>
giving general information about yourself. Next, you will fill out a<br/>
teacher&#39;s registration form, giving general information about the <br/>
course<br/>
that you will be teaching. Those bios and courses will be posted on <br/>
the FOL<br/>
website. We run on a semester basis. Your commitment is made one <br/>
semester<br/>
at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Each semester that you would like for your children to participate in <br/>
the<br/>
Foundation for Online Learning (FOL) courses, you MUST be willing to <br/>
teach<br/>
and complete a six week course on the subject of your choice. <br/>
Teachers who<br/>
do not fulfill the requirement of completing the class they are <br/>
teaching<br/>
will have their children removed from the classes in which they are<br/>
registered. This is a balance we must keep to make it fair for <br/>
everyone and<br/>
to ensure fulfillment of commitments. Emergencies are always <br/>
considered. By<br/>
doing this, we hope to keep disappointments to a minimum.<br/>
If you feel unsure about this type of commitment, you can consider<br/>
co-teaching with someone, either from the list or a friend you would <br/>
feel<br/>
comfortable sharing this arrangement with. This will allow for more<br/>
continuity for your class throughout the semester. It is a great way <br/>
to get<br/>
a feel for how this all works and have even more support between <br/>
people. We<br/>
have had several people do this and it has worked very well for them. <br/>
Both<br/>
teacher&#39;s children may take classes during the semester that they are<br/>
co-teaching.<br/>
<br/>
We keep teacher/parents and kids safety at a high priority. We have a<br/>
personal reason as well as a public reason; our kids are taking these<br/>
classes also! Therefore, any rude/demeaning remarks, profanity or <br/>
anything<br/>
similar toward anyone on this list is NOT PERMITTED! There are <br/>
moderators<br/>
who are actively watching this list and will handle any situations in <br/>
a way<br/>
that they deem appropriate. The moderators can remove anyone from <br/>
this list<br/>
and/or classes, without notice, if they do not follow the rules put <br/>
in place<br/>
by this organization.<br/>
<br/>
The Foundation for Online Learning is open to all people. We are an<br/>
INCLUSIVE group. All we ask is that our rules be followed. You are <br/>
welcome<br/>
to teach from a Christian perspective, or any other religious <br/>
preference.<br/>
However, if you will be teaching a class with a tendency toward a <br/>
specific<br/>
religion/philosophy you must state this in your class description at <br/>
the<br/>
time of teacher/class registrations. Descriptions must be clear and <br/>
concise<br/>
for this purpose. By doing your part in keeping this very clear from <br/>
the<br/>
beginning, you will help prevent any misunderstandings.<br/>
