&gt;&gt; I think she meant that one had nothing to do with the other.<br/>
&gt; Gravity does not<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have to disagree. Gravity rules their entire existance. They have<br/>
&gt; evolved a specific way to overcome gravity, and the expenditure of<br/>
&gt; energy to overcome it rules how much they need to eat and drink, how<br/>
&gt; high and how far they can fly, how they land, and almost every facet<br/>
&gt; of their lives. The entire evolution of birds with their hollow bones<br/>
&gt; and feathers is governed by gravity.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In the interests of ending what could become an alarmingly off-topic (and<br/>
IMHO silly) debate on hummingbirds and their aerodynamic capabilities,<br/>
feelings, and deeply-held beliefs, can I please just amend my original words<br/>
to:<br/>
<br/>
Math is to unschoolers as gravity is to hummingbirds.<br/>
<br/>
(i.e, we all use it every day and most of the time don&#39;t think much about<br/>
the fact we are using it.)<br/>
<br/>
That makes completely invalid my response to the original post about<br/>
workbooks, but it cleans up the language to my satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
