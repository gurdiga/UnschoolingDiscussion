<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648680211">We were at play group today and one of the moms had just taken her oldest out <br/>
of school (oldest being 6 yo) and was asking about how to keep records and <br/>
curriculums etc.  She knows that I unschool.  I sat for a while and listened <br/>
as a few of the other moms told her how to juggle the different curriculums <br/>
of different grade levels of children.  How to keep records, how to record <br/>
tests and grade.  They talked about report cards etc etc and mentioned that <br/>
at 7 you have to send in you notice of intent to homeschool to the state etc. <br/>
 I wasn&#39;t sure how to offer alternative ideas without sounding pushy.  She <br/>
does know we unschool and that we are the only ones there.  <br/>
<br/>
I just kind of butted in when they were talking about record keeping for the <br/>
state and said the only record you need to keep on a daily basis is <br/>
attendance record.  Also immunization record or statement of faith exclusion. <br/>
 I wasn&#39;t sure how to say anything without being pushy myself.  Thought I <br/>
might lend her my copy of The Unschooling Handbook and just explain that I <br/>
know she intends to use a curriculum (she did say that) but that I thought it <br/>
might help to read about another option just to get some perspective on <br/>
homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
I hate to have someone start out so overwhelmed with curriculum and tests and <br/>
grades and report cards.  None of it is state required.<br/>
<br/>
Just not sure how to handle these situations without being confrontational.  <br/>
Maybe I did enough.  Some women are so &quot;school at home&quot; and get kind of pushy <br/>
when they feel they really know &quot;how to work it.&quot;  Any other thoughts?<br/>

You planted the seed.  If she is interested in unschooling she will seek to<br/>
learn more.   I think it would be nice of you to offer to lend her your<br/>
book.  If she reads it at least she will be making an informed decision and<br/>
it might stay in her head as an alternative should the school at home not<br/>
work out.   I never seem to get back books I lend out.  I am getting better<br/>
at suggesting titles rather than offering to lend my favorite books out.<br/>
Live and learn!<br/>

&quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; is by Mary Griffith and it is a great book for<br/>
any new unschooler to read.  She also wrote &quot;The Homeschooling Handbook.&quot;<br/>

Here is a link to the book at Amazon.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think a lot of times what overwhelms people new to homeschooling is the<br/>
<br/>
variety of opinions they get on how it *should* be done. What I will do,<br/>
when in a group of people who are all offering up their advice, is just<br/>
give the person my phone number and an open invite to call me if they<br/>
have any questions, or to come see how our days go. A lot of times seeing<br/>
is believing. I have lent out books before, but I have too often asked<br/>
the people what they thought of them only to be told that after having<br/>
the books for months, they were never read. I do like to keep a list of<br/>
favorite books (of which the Unschooling Handbook is number one) and if<br/>
anybody asks, I offer up the list. That way, if they are really<br/>
interested, they will take the initiative to search them out.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago I got a call from my 60 year old aunt. She has a<br/>
ten year old daughter who they adopted from somewhere in South America at<br/>
3. The child has a lot of issues caused by her mental and physical abuse<br/>
as a toddler, and these issues are causing her problems in school. My<br/>
aunt wanted advice on homeschooling, but apparently had spoke to some<br/>
other school-at-homers before contacting me. She wanted to know things<br/>
like curriculum, how we set up &quot;school&quot;, schedules, etc.etc. I told her<br/>
we don&#39;t, on all accounts. I suggested that maybe &quot;school&quot; itself was<br/>
part of her daughter&#39;s problem, and that maybe if she could just do lots<br/>
of fun things and just start to enjoy life , it would help her mental and<br/>
physical being. My aunt just said, yea, but that isn&#39;t teaching her<br/>
anything. I said, neither is school (maybe I shouldn&#39;t have). She was<br/>
polite, but you could just tell she wasn&#39;t interested, and didn&#39;t want<br/>
any book recommendations. We&#39;ll see how it pans out.<br/>

<br/>
Being in the situation of this lady quite recently, I think it is a good idea for you to recommend this book (which is what finally made me commit to unschooling) or any book by Holt. When I first thought about homeschooling, it was just second nature for me to think &quot;school at home&quot; and dive into an overwhelming amount of curricula choices. The first book I read was &quot;The Well Trained Mind&quot;. This gave me the structure/plan that I needed at the time, but I wish I would have explored other philosophies first. I was always curious about unschooling, and I couldn&#39;t comprehend what exactly it was. I finally looked more into it when the curriculum just wasn&#39;t working.  <br/>
<br/>
To make a short story long:)...maybe you can nicely try to stress to her to explore several education philosophies before settling with one or even with a curriculum. For me though, I think I almost needed to start with the curriculum to see proof that that isn&#39;t where we belonged.<br/>

    Does your library have a copy? I gave it to mine and checked first that<br/>
it would go on the shelf and not in a booksale. It could have been sold to<br/>
someone that could use it but by being on the shelf it can serve several<br/>
people. Just a suggestion. :-)<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a good suggestion, although the Los Angeles Public Library system<br/>
is pretty comprehensive. ;)<br/>
<br/>
However, one of the list members has already asked for it. I suggested<br/>
that she pass it on when done. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I will use the Library more when Jayn is older. For the most<br/>
part, I like owning books so that I can write in them if I want to. I do<br/>
a lot of buying and selling of used books both on Amazon and E-Bay. <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of books, you can reserve a copy of the next Harry Potter<br/>
(something about a Phoenix Feather) on Amazon and receive it immediately<br/>
it is released. I can hardly wait to read it.<br/>
