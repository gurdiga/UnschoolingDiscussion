Remember that every act is an act of self-definition.  Every thought<br/>
carries the energy of creation.  Every word is a declaration of what is true<br/>
for you. Look to see what you are doing today.  Is this how you choose to <br/>
define yourself? Look to see what you are thinking today.  Is this what you <br/>
wish to create? Look to see what you are saying today.  Is this what you <br/>
desire to be so? Each moment of your life is a holy moment, a moment of <br/>
creation<br/>
