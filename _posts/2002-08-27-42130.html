or answers someone directly, you tell them that they should answer to All,<br/>
not just one person. But when I do it ( knowing that all posts are to all<br/>
listers) then for some reason it&#39;s wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, you can&#39;t have it both ways. I used the term &quot;us&quot; because I accept<br/>
the idea that Bj&#39;s response will be read by &quot;us&quot; and not just me.<br/>
<br/>
Luz and I were treated similarly by one of this state&#39;s homeschooling groups<br/>
and the excuse they used was the same as yours -- that we are not<br/>
stakeholders any longer since our child was in college.<br/>
<br/>
If you think that a group of neophites can help each other with no word from<br/>
those of us who have &quot;been there and done that&quot; then you are asking the<br/>
blind to lead the blind.<br/>
<br/>
I believed that Bj has the perfect position (public school 2nd grade<br/>
teacher) from which to tell this list (&quot;us&quot;) how to avoid doing to our<br/>
children what the schools do to them.<br/>
<br/>
As a writer on the subject, I can use all the information I can get. As<br/>
unschoolers involved in the practice every day, many of the list members can<br/>
surely use Bj&#39;s help in NOT doing what the schools do to children -- namely<br/>
Stifling them and lining them up (intimidating them).<br/>
<br/>
I think my post went to the heart of home/unschooling: How not to damage<br/>
children the way schools do. If you allow Bj to respond, I believe all of us<br/>
can learn a great deal from her, myself included.  Frankly, I&#39;m surprised<br/>
you didn&#39;t ask.<br/>
<br/>
My post to Bj was this:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You mention the reason you are keeping the kids home<br/>
&gt; is so that you don&#39;t &quot;stifle&quot; them or have them &quot;lined up.&quot; Please tell us<br/>
&gt; more about that.   Ned Vare<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>PS  Having public school teachers homeschooling their own children lends a<br/>
huge amount of credibility to homeschooling. I believe that Bj&#39;s reasons<br/>
will reinforce, for many parents, their own suspicions about the schools and<br/>
their own reasons for homeschooling. If for no one else, let Bj&#39;s response<br/>
be for Tanya to give to her mother-in-law.<br/>
<br/>
With all the kids being lured back into the public schools and away from<br/>
their homes, parents need what Bj seems eager to tell them -- reasons that<br/>
support the homeschooling choice.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Ned, this isn&#39;t about rules. It&#39;s just common sense. People ask questions<br/>
because they want an answer for themselves. The fact that they&#39;re doing it<br/>
in a public place means it isn&#39;t a private conversation between two people<br/>
and anyone can answer. Since people often have to guess and fill in the<br/>
blanks when they&#39;re offering suggestions, it&#39;s often helpful for people who<br/>
are reading the answers to realize that the answers may not apply<br/>
specifically to them but to others who have the same question.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And it wouldn&#39;t need said if you had any respect for the niche the list<br/>
serves. The list serves the function it was intended for.<br/>
<br/>
This is a busy list, Ned. Just meeting the niche that it does generates a<br/>
lot of emails. That&#39;s why lists are devoted to specific purposes. So people<br/>
can read just about the aspects that they want.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you think that a group of neophites can help each other with no word from<br/>
&gt; those of us who have &quot;been there and done that&quot; then you are asking the<br/>
&gt; blind to lead the blind.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who said that? I&#39;ve been unschooling for many years Ned. Many people here<br/>
have been also. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because I already know of many ways schools can damage kids. Because I&#39;ve<br/>
been reading what parents have been saying for years and years and years.<br/>
<br/>
(This is meant as no insult to BJ. If she feels it would be helpful to her<br/>
to tell her story, then she&#39;s more than welcome to do so. That&#39;s what people<br/>
do here. If Tanya thinks it would be helpful to ask BJ, no on is stopping<br/>
her. You asking questions that you feel others should be asking feels<br/>
condescending.)<br/>
<br/>
The focus of this list *isn&#39;t* how schools damage kids. The focus is how to<br/>
move on. Anyone can dwell on the past. It&#39;s the moving on that&#39;s hard.<br/>
That&#39;s what we do here. It&#39;s what we&#39;ve done here for 3 1/2 years.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This isn&#39;t a general homeschooling list. It&#39;s *specifically* about<br/>
unschooling. *Specifically* about being with our kids and helping them<br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you need *this* list to be other than that?<br/>

their own selfish, corrupt  reasons.  That would have to apply Bj if you&#39;re <br/>
going to be consistent.  (I certainly wouldn&#39;t apply it to Bj, or any of <br/>
the  many public school teachers who are doing what *they* believe is a <br/>
good thing.)<br/>

ask the &quot;right&quot; questions, then *he* asks them, not because he wants the <br/>
answers for himself, but because he wants other list members to *see* the <br/>
answers.<br/>
<br/>
Reminds me of the typical teacher-led &quot;discussion&quot; in school.  The whole <br/>
purpose of the discussion is to &quot;bring out&quot; certain points.  The lesson <br/>
plans are always very clear on which points those are, so the teacher won&#39;t <br/>
need to do any thinking.  (Of course the students aren&#39;t really supposed to <br/>
either.)<br/>
