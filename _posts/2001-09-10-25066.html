 </span></blockquote>I love Mister Rogers. I find his way of talking to kids respectful and <br/>
kind--it&#39;s very clear he really loves kids.<br/>
<br/>
I would never tell a kid who loved Teletubbies it was stupid. And I actually <br/>
kind of enjoy Pokemon...but mostly because of Jessie and James. Now, THEY are <br/>
cool. But Ash is SUCH a whiner. And I&#39;m afraid Brock has a constipation <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
I took Julian to the first Pokemon movie when it came out. The short before <br/>
the main movie mostly involved Pokemon repeating their names over and over, <br/>
with occasional musical interludes with colors behind Pokemon. (A friend <br/>
described it as Pikachu on acid.) I kept thinking, &quot;If this whole thing is <br/>
like this my brain is going to explode!&quot; Luckily, it wasn&#39;t, and it didn&#39;t. I <br/>
kind of liked the second one. We never got around to the third.<br/>
