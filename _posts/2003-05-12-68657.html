<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963102435">In &quot;Coloring Outside the Lines&quot; (not an unschooling book, but an interesting perspective if you park the unschooling philosophy while you read) which I read about a 2 yrs ago,  the author stated that as an engineer, he rarely used more than simple arithmetic and fractions in his day-to-day work.  He wrote reports that required simple language.  He advocated schools make Shakespeare and algebra optional for those who delighted in it only.  Huge-o waste of time.<br/>
<br/>
So to him, Math and English are over-blown in school, and he had his kids find one subject they loved at school to excel in and they could get bare passes in all others - delight driven but unfortunately still in the system.  As a parent he told the finger-wagging Math and English teachers to take a hike, which made me giggle.<br/>

  &lt;&lt; Don&#39;t yell at me, but probably our first year will be 20% teaching (from <br/>
  Math, Bible readers, and English text) and 80% unschooling. I need this <br/>
  re-training time for myself, mentally.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  No you don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
  If you&#39;re going to tell your children (by your actions) that you don&#39;t trust <br/>
  them to learn math and English from their environment but you DO expect <br/>
  science and history to come for fun &quot;when they&#39;re through with their work&quot; <br/>
  (math, English and Bible), you&#39;re not going to be unschooling and it&#39;s not <br/>
  going to work.  <br/>
<br/>
  What you&#39;ll really be saying is that English and math are more important than <br/>
  the other things AND that you don&#39;t think they&#39;re capable of natural learning.<br/>
