  &gt; Sandra!!  I am surprised at you! :)  How about writing with your new<br/>

  Do you or your children write poetry or have a favorite poem?  Nicely <br/>
  penned poems on good paper make great gifts. If you have an artist in <br/>
  the family they can illuminate them, too.  When I was in high school <br/>
  and had the time and inclination to compose, I would write poetry and <br/>
  my best friend would illuminate it, we gave them to our family as <br/>
  christmas gifts one year. My parents still have it hanging on the <br/>
  wall.<br/>
