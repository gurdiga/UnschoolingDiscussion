<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146687034">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I had been reading and replying to this list on the website instead of from <br/>
my email.&amp;nbsp; This may be why it was coming up as spam.&amp;nbsp; Is this better?&amp;<br/>
nbsp; (It&#39;s from my email account.)<br/>
<br/>
Again, sorry for the trouble -- I hadn&#39;t known there was a problem, since I <br/>
had gone no mail.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Amy<br/>
<br/>
