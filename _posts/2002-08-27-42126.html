<div id="ygrps-yiv-511060830">It turns out that this list is a support group after all....even after<br/>
Joyce&#39;s denial. Ren said so, therefore it must be true. Now we can all relax<br/>
because we know what we&#39;re doing. Fine. Until now, I have thought it was<br/>
trying for more than that, so I was misunderstanding the purpose. Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
I can do support. Luz and I have done support for years. We still do a<br/>
newsletter called Unschoolers Unlimited Newsletter. If anyone wants to<br/>
receive it, send a private email.<br/>

Unschooling for today...Whenever you get the urge to &quot;teach&quot; your child<br/>
something, think UN !  Perhaps the best way to quit hovering over your kid<br/>
is to get an interest or two for yourself, and do those things, and leave<br/>
your child alone for periods. Be a parent for a certain amount of time, and<br/>
for the rest of the time, do things that concern you and that you enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
For example, when you go to the library for your child&#39;s weekly supply of<br/>
books, be sure to get one or two for yourself, and read them during those<br/>
periods that you might otherwise be tempted to hover.<br/>
<br/>
 Your child will respect that, and will take the hint that s/he is expected<br/>
to have his/her own interests. If you&#39;ve recently taken him/her out of<br/>
school, don&#39;t expect him/her to suddenly know how to take charge of his/her<br/>
own life -- that takes time. The idea of unschooling is to help your child<br/>
become self-sufficient, independent, self motivated, creative in their use<br/>
of their time, critical thinking, etc.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s so simple isn&#39;t it.<br/>
I mean, how idiotic can we be to have to discuss this more than a <br/>
couple of times before it sinks in?<br/>
I should have moved on to letting my kids be, and started focusing on <br/>
how much the schools suck, years ago!<br/>
<br/>
You asked why discussing movies and video games from an unschooling <br/>
perspective is different than any other parents discussing those <br/>
topics.  The word is *depth*.  Try having a discussion about regular <br/>
parenting topics with a traditional school minded parent.  Talk about <br/>
how much your kids watch tv, or how long your 5yo boy grows his hair<br/>
(he has a choice!?), what they eat,how much they love legos, or hate <br/>
reading......See what kind of feedback you get.  These are real <br/>
issues, and I don&#39;t know about anybody else here, but I don&#39;t have <br/>
anyone IRL, where I live, who can even relate to an unschooling <br/>
philosophy that very much does spill over into parenting.  These <br/>
simple little mundane issues to you, are paramount for many of us to <br/>
discuss, to help us continuing to give our children the freedom they <br/>
deserve.  With the world around you telling you(or whispering behind <br/>
your back) to do things &quot;the normal way&quot;, discussions like the ones <br/>
that happen here can save your sanity.<br/>
I&#39;m sorry this list isn&#39;t serving your needs(and what needs are <br/>
they?), but it most definatly serves mine.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Helen said that.<br/>
<br/>
I have emphasized this is a discussion list in the past because many people<br/>
associate support group with something more akin to a cheerleading group<br/>
where they will get pats on the back for what they&#39;ve done. It helps them to<br/>
see that this list isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
If it would help you to think of it as a support group so you can tell us<br/>
tales of what you and your son did when he was home, then feel free to do<br/>
so.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Until now, I have thought it was<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Apparently this is all sarcasm since the posts from you that follow show<br/>
that you&#39;ve had no revelation at all and are still trying to make this some<br/>
kind of activist front for unschoolers who are pissed off at schools and the<br/>
government who aren&#39;t going to take it any more.<br/>
<br/>
No problem with forming a list around that idea. Why try to change *this*<br/>
list to that?<br/>
