&gt; Does spanking have to do with unschooling?  Lots of ways.<br/>
&gt; I grew up in a culture in which spanking was not only common but <br/>
&gt; considered a<br/>
&gt; necessary part of good parenting.<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t accept that. <br/>
&gt; I grew up in and around families in which children were shamed and <br/>
&gt; belittled.<br/>
&gt; Accepting that doesn&#39;t promote harmony.<br/>
&gt; We grew up surrounded by, inside, working in schools--most of us here.<br/>
&gt; Wouldn&#39;t the world be more harmonious if we all just give up this <br/>
&gt; divisive<br/>
&gt; homeschooling folly and accept the culture&#39;s decision to have schools, <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; send our children back to school, and peacefully live in that culture <br/>
&gt; with an<br/>
&gt; attitude of acceptance?<br/>
&gt; It WOULD be more harmonious.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But it wouldn&#39;t be **acceptable**  :-) !<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of the Serenity prayer that is so popular within the <br/>
12-step circles:<br/>
<br/>
Grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change,<br/>
the courage to change the things I can<br/>
and the wisdom to know the difference.<br/>
<br/>
I *can* change how my children are educated.  I have the courage to <br/>
unschool.  I also know that this path is not possible for everyone.  I <br/>
accept this.   <br/>
<br/>
Most people unschool along a continuum. Some are farther along the path <br/>
than others.  I think we can all respect and support each other as we <br/>
travel on the same path.  Wisdom is more accessible to others when it <br/>
comes gently worded.            <br/>
