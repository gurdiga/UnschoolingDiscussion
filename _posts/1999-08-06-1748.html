&lt;&lt; There are an awful lot of those parents out there.  They really don&#39;t<br/>
 want to hear about any alternatives &gt;&gt;<br/>
I feel that is because there is so much pressure on them from the schools (I <br/>
was told they wouldn&#39;t accept my child as ADHD until he was on meds), the <br/>
doctors (the doctor refused to see us any more because I refused meds) and <br/>
then the pressures of &quot;needing&quot; to work while the child is in school. Society <br/>
has made these things acceptable and it&#39;s difficult for people to even <br/>
conceive another way. Lori in TX</div>
