<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481652365">I have a huge question for the group which I&#39;m sure is asked by every newbie.  How will my daughter socialize with other kids?  It seems the common answer is through homeschool groups.  Well, as I posted earlier, I live basically in the middle of nowhere on a dead end road in southern Oklahoma.  The closest town of 25,000 has one homeschool group & they require a Faith statement.  But more than that, I know several people in it - they are very fundamental Christians which is their choice and I respect that.  But every time I get near them, they try to convert me.  I don&#39;t want that for my daughter.  Also, my daughter is an only child, so she won&#39;t learn with brothers/sisters.  I am VERY concerned about sending her to public school - but I don&#39;t want to isolate her, either.  It&#39;s bad enough that, although we attend the most liberal church in the area, I spend every sunday &quot;de-programming&quot; her from Sunday School.  On the plus side, she is learning at a very young age to question the facts we are spoon fed.  I would love to hear from other homeschoolers of only children?!?  <br/>

kids play with cousins, neighbor kids and the little boys I babysit. We go to <br/>
library and bookstore storytimes, homeschool days at our metroparks, and kids <br/>
days at the art museum. Scour your local paper for kids activities and <br/>
festivals...some are weekly events. Hope this helps!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We (my 9 yr old daughter and I ) live on a farm 6 miles from the nearest<br/>
town (800 people, a post office, and a truck stop). We drive to Woodland<br/>
(25 minutes) and Davis (40 minutes) a lot, both have about 50,000 people<br/>
and a lot more things to do. Rain is active in community theater, sports,<br/>
the book club at the local indie bookstore, and girl scouts... and maybe<br/>
other stuff. OTOH, she&#39;s a kid who wants to sign up for everything  and<br/>
seems to thrive on it. She has made some friends through these<br/>
activities, schooled and homeschooled, and she&#39;s also made her best<br/>
friend near here through an email post.We still drive to the bay area<br/>
(100 miles) fairly often and visit friends there, and usually stay for a<br/>
few days<br/>
<br/>
It may take time to find people - have you tried posting on the boards<br/>
for your state at unschooling.com? Are there more secular homeschooling<br/>
organizations at the state level?<br/>
<br/>
You could always move... which I say sort of in jest but not really. I<br/>
read an article in a homeschooling zine  by a young woman who&#39;d been<br/>
unschooled all her life, and one of the mistakes she said her parents<br/>
made was staying in the small southern town where they lived. YMMV..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our son Cassidy spent a lot of time on his own & often resisted our attempts<br/>
to &quot;socialize&quot; with other homeschoolers, so we didn&#39;t push it. He found<br/>
friends in our neighborhood and through classes, workshops at museums and<br/>
art centers when we lived in New Haven. He mostly had one good friend at a<br/>
time and they were mostly school kids, so he had limited time with them.<br/>
Sometimes he wished out loud that he could get together with them more<br/>
often. But mostly he was content to spend time with us or on his own. In his<br/>
teen years it seemed to us he was in his room  most of the time (listening<br/>
to music, books on tape while he worked on origami or Warhammer or computer<br/>
games). <br/>
<br/>
When he was 18 he decided to go to college in NYC. Found a roommate &<br/>
apartment, became a real social butterfly. He studied film and political<br/>
science. One of the things he likes about making films is it&#39;s an art form<br/>
that (usually) you create with a lot of other people. He graduated this<br/>
spring & will return tomorrow from 7 weeks in Europe, traveling with 3<br/>
friends. <br/>
<br/>
If he had been unhappy about lack of friends, we would have made more of an<br/>
effort to provide &quot;social opportunities.&quot;  But his &quot;low key&quot; social life<br/>
didn&#39;t hold him back at all once he was ready to move on.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s never too late.<br/>
