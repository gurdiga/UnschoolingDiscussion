<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962879960">I asked Carla, 8, what she thinks of spanking...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I do not like it, I think it is mean, I think they<br/>
(parents who still spank) do it just because they want<br/>
to.  I don&#39;t think you have to have too many rules<br/>
exxcept for safety and health rules.  I think it is<br/>
mean to limit things (tv, computer, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
  I think school is pretty much mean too &#39;cause people<br/>
make you do things you don&#39;t want to, I think school<br/>
should be fun.&quot; (she went to school for 1st grade,<br/>
loved it cause she had a COOL teacher and lasted 2<br/>
months of 2nd grade)<br/>
<br/>
She paused, there was a silencen then she said:<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;They (coercive parents) just treat them (their kids)<br/>
any old way like a ragdoll and I think that is very<br/>
mean.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ted, 6, said,<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about spanking...here&#39;s a pen,<br/>
let&#39;s enter the Hot Wheels contest, what&#39;s your email<br/>
mom, write it, WRITE IT!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He survived 2 months of kindergarten before the kids<br/>
started to shame him for being too active, too loud,<br/>
too bouncy, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 The pen search commenced as we surf, watch subtitled<br/>
anime  on one tv, Powerpuff Girls on the other tv and<br/>
they switch back and forth, poodle in tow, from one<br/>
&#39;blankie nest&#39; to another depending on which show is<br/>
interesting...it&#39;s 9:47, we will probably stay up<br/>
until Reign is on in an hour or so, they usually fall<br/>
asleep during that but I like the animation in it<br/>
&lt;laughs&gt;.  Oops, Ted just pulled out my bellydance<br/>
drum, Carla joined him, so there is another thing to<br/>
do....which reminds me I have a new bellydance<br/>
exercise vid, which reminds me I will show Carla how<br/>
to hand sew bead trim on my new costume in the strong<br/>
sunlight tomorrow...and so  it goes with our flow. <br/>
They can fall asleep watching either tv, snuggled with<br/>
me or alone and I will leave the aquarium light on in<br/>
the living room when I go to bed.<br/>
