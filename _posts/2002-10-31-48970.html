<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758789565">Well when I wrote in to ask about the whole chicken pox thing, I hadn&#39;t mentioned anything to my husband yet. So when I mentioned I was thinking of exposing the kids, he asked if I was crazy!!  LOL.<br/>
<br/>
So we had a discussion about it and when I said it might be better for them to get it now, he asked how I was sure they would ever get it at all. Well I couldn&#39;t be really. <br/>
<br/>
So he called the 3 younger children in and explained what we were talking about and asked them what they wanted to do. None of them wanted it now. And when I mentioned it might be worse if they got it later, they all responded the same way my husband had. How did I know they would get it at all? After all, I never had it.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s settled. Life goes on and we see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the great thought provoking posts.<br/>

vaccine?: &quot;how do you know I will get the disease at all&quot;?<br/>
