<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834077433">I understand where Brenda is coming from I think.  With 5 kids, food is one<br/>
of our biggest expenses.  When we started &quot;de-dieting&quot;, I was concerned<br/>
about the financial issues as well.  Here is how we handle it:<br/>
<br/>
I ask the kids, including the little guys what they want to have for suppers<br/>
and lunches.  Usually, it is pizza (which I make from scratch) or PBJ.  I<br/>
try to make a favorite of each child just every few days.  I try to offer at<br/>
least one thing that each kid likes each meal.<br/>
<br/>
When I go to the store, I ask the kids if there is something special they<br/>
want.  Right now, its yogurt and grapefruit.  When we first started, it was<br/>
poptarts and Pepsi.  I simply try to fit the special things they ask for<br/>
into the weekly budget.  Perhaps I buy more hamburger than steak that week<br/>
or make more things from scratch than convenience foods, but it seems to be<br/>
working out and not costing us any more money.  When they have eaten that<br/>
week&#39;s groceries, they have eaten that week&#39;s groceries.  They know I will<br/>
buy more of whatever they want the next week.<br/>
<br/>
We went through a period where we couldn&#39;t keep enough chocolate pudding in<br/>
the house, now no one eats it much.  Today for lunch, the kids could had<br/>
ready access to ice cream, pudding, chocolate chips, etc., Zach (8) made<br/>
himself some tomato soup and a yogurt.  Adriane (11) made a grilled cheese<br/>
sandwich and a glass of milk.<br/>

&gt; We go in cycles here too.  The trick is seeing when it&#39;s changing<br/>
&gt; before I stock up on one that&#39;s on it&#39;s way out.  Not so big a deal<br/>
&gt; with cereal as it is with something like bananas.<br/>
&gt; Ice cream was really big last fall and as the weather warms up, I<br/>
&gt; expect that to be a big one again.  We were eating about a gallon a<br/>
&gt; week at the peak of consumption.  But then there are 6 of us - well<br/>
&gt; only five that ate ice cream.<br/>
&gt; Oh, and thank gaia the lettuce prices went back down.  You have<br/>
&gt; thought one of mine was gonna have DT&#39;s if she didn&#39;t get some<br/>
&gt; lettuce!<br/>
