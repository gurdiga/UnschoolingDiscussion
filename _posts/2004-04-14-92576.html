 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m on a list about going from homeschool to college and at least according<br/>
to most of those folks&#39; experience, the above is not true. It seems that<br/>
most places do expect a transcript of some kind. Most hsers make them up<br/>
themselves - it seems like a personal decision as to how much you make it<br/>
look like a regular school&#39;s or not.<br/>
