<div id="ygrps-yiv-518499919">I read with great interest the comments in response to the news of the &quot;homeless homeschooled&quot; young man who achieved perfect scores on his SAT exams.  At the time, I was eager to play the Devil&#39;s advocate.  I decided not to discuss the issue entirely on hypotheticals, and so I collected additional info.<br/>
<br/>
For a copy and postage fee of $5.50, I obtained from the California Medical Board a copy of the action against Dr. Hamilton.<br/>
<br/>
Before I get into any details at all, I want to address the money/computer issue.  Many complained of her three computers and her supposed inability to get a job.  The action against her began in 1996 and was finalized with the revocation of her license in Oct 2000 (the license expired in May 1999, the decision came down in Oct 2000, but the acts that were disciplined were committed prior to the license expiring).  In the meantime, given the seriousness of the allegations against her, it is understandable that she could not easily find work.  Concerning the expense of the computers, just this week, I was given two separate sources for computers given free for educational purposes, and yes, homeschoolers are eligible.  I also have three thrift stores a couple miles from my home that sell many computers and printers and faxes and monitors, etc.  I happen to live in a suburban area.  The immediate area is a mix of low income, middle class and the very wealthy, so perhaps this opportunity for used computers also exists in other suburban areas.  Also concerning money, someone mentioned the cost of housing in Calif - but did you notice, the doc has three children and they live in a ONE bedroom APT?  We all have different priorities, and it seems education is a priority in this family.  The articles I read stated that the kids did most of their schooling on-line.  Perhaps they also economize this way by not buying curriculum, but by utilizing the plethora of free educational items available through that venue.  (Told you I wanted to play the Devil&#39;s advocate).  I don&#39;t know some of these details any more than others do, but I do know some comments are unfair when the details simply are not known.  One thing I do know is the church that is referenced in the article.  The article mentions that they have been members of that particular church for only the past few years.  It&#39;s quite possible that this family has a support system in the church members.  Particularly if the M.D. has had a change of heart/life since her professional debacle befell her.  It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if members of the church donated their own used computers.  It also wouldn&#39;t surprise me if some of the kids were talented enough to build their own machines.  At any rate,  here&#39;s the professional info:<br/>
<br/>
It appears that in 1989 a child was admitted to the hospital where Dr. Hamilton worked, and the patient (pt) was assigned to Dr. Hamilton (CJH).  The pt was a 10 month old infant with intussusception (telescoping of one bowel segment to another), which is serious and potentially fatal.  The infant was admitted and treated, but had symptoms later which prompted the doctor to order a barium enema.  The pt&#39;s conditioned worsened and she was sent to intensive care, where the neurological symptoms were evaluated by other dr.&#39;s who ordered a CAT scan.  As it turned out, the infant had a brain tumor and she passed away.<br/>
<br/>
That much is clear - the rest is part fact, part speculation on my part, part poor judgement on the CJH&#39;s part, and part covering one&#39;s behind on the hospital&#39;s part, part taking warranted action on the hospital&#39;s part.  In that the child passed away, it appears that the ensuing investigation and review was inevitable, and that the investigation uncovered practices which the hospital chose to pursue as allegation of professional misconduct (this probably helped them look better in the wake of the death:  oh, yeah, this doctor is to blame, she&#39;s a bad cat).  In that an infant died on the hospital&#39;s watch, the parents were undoubtedly overwhelmed with grief and wanted to know what happened, and who was responsible.  Part of the criticism with the care given by CJH focused on the lack of physical reassessment on her part (she took the call/page from the nurses and ordered the enema, but did not reassess in person).  The hospital appears to have dug further into CJH&#39;s practices to discover that on more than several occassions, the dr.&#39;s notes were dictated up to a month after the care was rendered, and so the &quot;witch-hunt&quot; began in full force.  The hosptial faults her for the late medical dicatations, but CJH claims this was a common practice at the hospital by many doctors.  There was speculation that (in an effort to cover up for care that was never given, some late dictation was done intentionally when no follow-up care had actually been given.  The Board admitted there is no way they could ever know for sure, and those charges were dismissed.  The doctor was also discovered to have self-medicated &quot;dangerous&quot; drugs - no, not pain killers, but acne drugs and antibiotics.  The Board dismissed these charges because there is actually no law or regulation against self-prescribing.  There is a Business and Professions Code section 2234 and 4402 which  define a dangerous drug but does not proscribe any conduct.  The section that pertains to self-administration of drugs is a different section, and that section is not alleged in the charges, and it does not per se prohibit self-administration of drugs.  Naturally, there was no action taken on the drug charges.<br/>
<br/>
I spent many years in the U.S. Marine Corps, and I have seen my share of witch hunts.  I worked in the legal arena, although I am not a lawyer.  I have seen commander&#39;s eager to find a scape goat when they know heads will begin to roll, and I have seen how quickly one can locate an easy taget who is made to carry the load of of punishment for many.  Usually, such an individuals behavior would escape detection or not be considered punishible, were in not for some other situation looming large.  I do not make any excuses for the doctor, and I do not assume to know exactly what did happen or what should have happened.  But I do recognize that many of the elements of this investigation and the ensuing charges bear a close resemblence to other scenarios I have seen played out elsewhere. <br/>
<br/>
What we know for sure is that a child died on this doctor&#39;s watch, and finding work again has been difficult.  The doctor and hospital acknowledge personality conflicts between the staff and doctor, and the doctor claims this is part of the basis for the total action against her.  The doctor was suspended a week after the child passed away.  All of the allegations against her consituted the basis for the suspension, although many of the allegations were dismissed, for the reasons cited above.  The doctor was eligible for a probation, vice a license revocation (but keep in mind, by this time the license had expired expired).  But the reasons cited for not considering probation are: the doctor did not, in their opinion, accept responsibility for her actions (by claiming some things were common practice by others), she did not appear before the board on the day of the hearing, and the doctor&#39;s &quot;apparent unwilliingness to return to employment at VCH under rather lenient terms and conditions.&quot;  I don&#39;t know what the lenient terms and conditions were, just that the doctor described personality problems and the investigation/charges were coming out of this same hospital, and she did not want to go back.  In addition to the revocation the doctor is liable for the cost of the investigation and enforcement ($19,542.22).  She cannot have her license re-issued, renewed, or reinstated unless this cost is paid.  Of course she can apply in other states, as I understand it, and quite often other states do not check for revocation information.  If a Dr. wishes to, they can lie on an application and hope the employer does not verify.<br/>

aren&#39;t quite correct.<br/>

claims.  Large malpractice firms are always looking for folks to review<br/>
cases.  She could have done insurance exams (you don&#39;t have to be licensed<br/>
to do those).  There are dozens of ways to use that medical degree and by<br/>
the end of first year med school, all the med students know what they are.<br/>
<br/>

however, make the following statement which was interesting and may have<br/>
some bearing on her failure to find employment:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;While we need to raise our daughters with a good education, it should<br/>
always be with the vision of using it to be a good wife and mother, NOT to<br/>
work toward a career out of the home.&quot;<br/>

Hamilton.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;snip&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***The comments about the loss of a medical license are fine as far as facts<br/>
go but the implication that there was a &quot;witch hunt&quot; are out in left field.<br/>
Also, the way this is lumped together gives the impression that there was<br/>
one big conspiracy when the bottom line was that the good doc screwed up and<br/>
a child died.  I think the sympathy is misplaced.<br/>
<br/>
All hospitals in the U.S. that receive any federal funds have to be<br/>
certified by the JCHA (feds)  and must meet certain criteria. That criteria<br/>
includes having a QA committee. Sometimes this comes under Risk Management,<br/>
sometimes it is called Quality Management, sometimes Quality Assurance.<br/>
Each month the hospital&#39;s QA committee meets. This committee generally<br/>
consists of the Chief of Staff, Risk Management, Unit Nurse Managers and<br/>
doctors from each discipline.<br/>
<br/>
ALL deaths are reviewed (it doesn&#39;t take an unhappy parent to trigger this),<br/>
all med errors are reviewed, all complaints against staff (doctors, nurses,<br/>
pharmacy, etc.) are reviewed. A person such as the head of Medical Records<br/>
or the Nursing Services Coordinator (moi &lt;g&gt;) pulls all the records, does a<br/>
summary sheet--MR (medical records) No. 123456789, admitted 01/01/??,<br/>
diagnosis: [example] cardio-vascular insufficiency (with appropriate code<br/>
number), and then the reason for the record being part of the<br/>
review--deceased, med error, patient/family complaint--and places the charts<br/>
on a chart and then hauls the whole works to the committee meeting.<br/>
<br/>
Right off the top there would have been a problem with this record if there<br/>
was no dictation and it would have been noted on the summary. If the<br/>
dictation was done but had not been transcribed, there would have been a<br/>
flag saying: &quot;Dictated, not transcribed.&quot; These are placed in all charts as<br/>
soon as the transcription pool receives the dictation tapes. In hospitals<br/>
that have the equivalent of a voice mail system for dictation, their system<br/>
would be somewhat different.<br/>
<br/>
Now, on to the basis for the disciplinary action. Not only is it<br/>
unprofessional behavior to not physically see and exam a patient, it can be<br/>
criminally prosecuted. Again, this was no &quot;witch hunt,&quot; this was standard<br/>
operating procedure for all hospitals.<br/>
<br/>
Red flags would have gone off all over the place when it was noted that the<br/>
doctor ordered tests on a patient who was not examined. Particularly when<br/>
you only have an approximate 48-72 hours window between life and death with<br/>
a patient who already (per your post) was diagnosed as having<br/>
intussusception. If this is the case, it is generally considered that the<br/>
barium enema would not have been the appropriate test to order anyway as the<br/>
diagnosis had already been made. The appropriate tests would have been a CAT<br/>
scan or ultrasound to see if there was now an obstruction or tumor.<br/>
Intussusception can be (please note, I said &quot;can be&quot; not &quot;is&quot;) caused by<br/>
various types of tumors or lymphosarcomas. The first line is to use the<br/>
least invasive test possible on a small child.  You did note that another<br/>
physician did order a CT and that it did show a brain tumor.  You don&#39;t<br/>
mention whether or not this was a mets to the brain or a primary site.<br/>
Obviously the second doctor was a better diagnostician.<br/>
<br/>
Further, there is no way in h*ll a doctor should treat any patient without a<br/>
physical exam. This is unethical AND unprofessional behavior in any hospital<br/>
regardless of claims of &quot;not getting along with the staff.&quot;  What in the<br/>
world does that whining have to do with the primary charge.  Looks like a<br/>
smoke screen to try and spread the blame around.<br/>
<br/>
When a death is found to result from misconduct, the hospital is required<br/>
(this is not an option) to turn over their findings to the California<br/>
Medical Board who then reviews the hospital&#39;s actions.  In this case, with<br/>
her lack of remorse and failure to accept responsibility, she is lucky that<br/>
they didn&#39;t turn it over to the county DA&#39;s office for criminal prosecution.<br/>
Which, btw, is a quite frequently the first option listed in most hospital P<br/>
& Ps.<br/>
<br/>
Generally the sanctions placed on doctors include being proctored, time<br/>
limits on dictation and some sort of leave without pay.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;snip&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That much is clear - the rest is part fact, part speculation on my part,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>part poor judgement on the CJH&#39;s part, and part covering one&#39;s behind on the<br/>
hospital&#39;s part, part taking warranted action on the hospital&#39;s part.<br/>
<br/>
***The above addresses some of this but the I don&#39;t think chalking up a<br/>
child&#39;s death to &quot;poor judgement&quot; is something that the good doc gets to<br/>
use.  It is called criminal negligence.<br/>
<br/>
As to the hospital doing a CYA, nope, if they were, they would have covered<br/>
up for the doc as she wasn&#39;t simply someone who had privileges at the<br/>
hospital, she was a hospital employee.  Thus, by acknowledging that she was<br/>
negligent, they acknowledged some responsibility for her acts.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;snip&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> Part of the criticism with the care given by CJH focused on the lack of<br/>
physical reassessment on her part (she took the call/page from the nurses<br/>

to have dug further into CJH&#39;s practices to discover that on more than<br/>
several occasions, the dr.&#39;s notes were dictated up to a month after the<br/>
care was rendered, and so the &quot;witch-hunt&quot; began in full force.<br/>
<br/>
***Again, this was not a &quot;witch hunt,&quot; it was federally and state mandated<br/>
SOP.   When negligence is found, the records on all patients seen by the<br/>
physician being investigated are pulled for review.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The hosptial faults her for the late medical dicatations, but CJH claims<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this was a common practice at the hospital by many doctors.<br/>
<br/>
***Sounds like a typical teens on a sitcom excuse, &quot;But Mom, everyone else<br/>
is doing it&quot; to which mom replies, &quot;Well, if everyone else is jumping off<br/>
the Golden Gate Bridge, are you going to do it too?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;There is a Business and Professions Code section 2234 and 4402 which define<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a dangerous drug but does not proscribe any conduct.<br/>
<br/>
***I checked my old copy of the California Business and Professions Code and<br/>
couldn&#39;t find these, so decided to go online and see if they had been added<br/>
since I last renewed my copies. The medical stuff falls under Division 2.<br/>
Healing Arts. In Chapter 5. Medicine, Article 13. Medical Adjudication,<br/>
there is no Article 2234. There is an Article 2232 and 2235 but no 2234.<br/>
Chapter 9. Pharmacy, Article 23. Revenue and Renewal, Article 4402 has to do<br/>
with pharmacists licenses.<br/>

20<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure you have those numbers right?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The section that pertains to self-administration of drugs is a different<br/>
 </span></blockquote>section &gt;snip&lt;<br/>
<br/>
***What section would that be?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;The doctor was eligible for a probation, vice a license revocation (but<br/>
 </span></blockquote>keep in mind, by<br/>
this time the license had expired expired).<br/>
<br/>
***If she were put on probation, her license would have been suspended or<br/>
been put in a provisionary status,  not revoked.  She refused to return to<br/>
work and take her punishment.  She could have applied for a transfer to<br/>
another facility within the group the hospital she was employed by was a<br/>
member.  This is done all the time and that is accepted by the Board.  She<br/>
choose not to exercise that option.<br/>
<br/>
And, presumption of guilt is what happens when one refuses or neglects to<br/>
show up at a hearing.  Again, this is her fault, not the hospitals or the<br/>
Boards.  The fact that she allowed her license to lapse was just one more<br/>
negative mark against her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-233842123">Actually, Horizon does NOT run those programs as a service for people who<br/>
want to homeschool.  You can put any face on it you want to justify how one<br/>
supposedly homeschools or unschools.  They are in the business of making<br/>
money off the public school system.  Randy could care less whether anyone<br/>
succeeds or fails as long as the money keeps rolling in.  Charters were NOT<br/>
invented in CA so people could homeschool.  They were originally invented so<br/>
that alternative schools could be set up where the parents would control<br/>
what was happening.  They then progressed to including various forms of<br/>
homeschooling.  However, they are part of the public school system, and they<br/>
have basic requirements that must be met including enrollment, signed<br/>
agreements, vaccinations and approved curriculum.  If they aren&#39;t meeting<br/>
them, then the legislature will finish what they started two years ago and<br/>
shut them all down.  Horizon is one of the ones under investigation for<br/>
misappropriate of funds.<br/>
<br/>
To be part of Horizon, you must sign an agreement, turn in roll sheets and<br/>
learning records every 20 school days.  You must meet with an ES every 20<br/>
school days or more frequently if needed/desired.  &quot;All students in charter<br/>
schools are required to achieve at least as much learning as would be<br/>
required in the regular schools in California.&quot;  &quot;The learning records must<br/>
be sent to the Lincoln office electronically within seven (7) rotations of<br/>
the earth after the learning period of no more than 20 school days.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Included on the learning record format is a listing of the student<br/>
standards in each growth area.&quot;  &quot;The ES evaluates the learning by<br/>
indicating the student standards in which progress has occurred during the<br/>
learning period.&quot;  &quot;Learning records must be written to reflect the<br/>
requirements of independent study law.&quot;  &quot;Learning records will include<br/>
descriptions of the major objectives and activities of the course of study<br/>
covered by the agreement that were used within each assignment period.&quot;<br/>
&quot;This Charter School must administer any state mandated test whenever one is<br/>
provided. The state mandated test for the school year 2000/01 is the STAR9.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Each parent facilitator is required to sign a contract between the parent<br/>
and the charter school&quot;  &quot;Students will demonstrate competency in seven<br/>
growth area goals, determined by achievement of the student standards.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Charter school students will perform and achieve as well as or better than<br/>
students in traditional California public schools&quot;  &quot;Students will achieve<br/>
competency in basic academic skills&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, this isn&#39;t homeschooling, this is public school independent study<br/>
with lots of criteria.  At the least it is school at home.  It sure isn&#39;t<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
And some folks in CA do homeschool and have for years.  They may not be<br/>
technically legal but they are homeschooling.  And, filing an R4 does not<br/>
put you at the government trough, nor does it have government regulated<br/>
requirements and government regulated standards that are enforced by monthly<br/>
meetings with public school officials with &quot;mandatory:  portfolio, monthly<br/>
review of work, Star test.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
The definition of what is &#39;homeschooling&#39; is as varied as the number <br/>
and types of homeschooling families. It&#39;s too bad that an attitude <br/>
has developed among homeschoolers who think &#39;that person isn&#39;t really <br/>
homeschooling&#39; because they aren&#39;t doing it exactly as THEY would <br/>
define it. I mean, I&#39;ve met people who wouldn&#39;t consider anyone truly <br/>
homeschoolers unless they&#39;re doing it for religious reasons. <br/>
Obviously, there are lots of us who would argue against that <br/>
definition. <br/>
<br/>
The point is that if you live in a state that makes it hard to <br/>
homeschool, you do what you can and have to in order to live your <br/>
life and homeschool the way you can. If I had to be &#39;registered&#39; <br/>
under a private or charter school to keep my child home and teach her <br/>
myself, I would. That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not just playing their game <br/>
and then doing what I want. <br/>
<br/>
Or again as Cindy put it &lt;&lt;I really don&#39;t think we want to get into a <br/>

&gt; that alternative schools could be set up where the parents would <br/>
control<br/>
&gt; what was happening.  They then progressed to including various <br/>
forms of<br/>
&gt; homeschooling.  However, they are part of the public school system, <br/>
and they<br/>
&gt; have basic requirements that must be met including enrollment, <br/>
signed<br/>

meeting<br/>
&gt; them, then the legislature will finish what they started two years <br/>

&gt; shut them all down.  Horizon is one of the ones under investigation <br/>
for<br/>
&gt; misappropriate of funds.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To be part of Horizon, you must sign an agreement, turn in roll <br/>
sheets and<br/>
&gt; learning records every 20 school days.  You must meet with an ES <br/>
every 20<br/>
&gt; school days or more frequently if needed/desired.  &quot;All students in <br/>
charter<br/>
&gt; schools are required to achieve at least as much learning as would <br/>
be<br/>
&gt; required in the regular schools in California.&quot;  &quot;The learning <br/>
records must<br/>
&gt; be sent to the Lincoln office electronically within seven (7) <br/>
rotations of<br/>
&gt; the earth after the learning period of no more than 20 school days.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Included on the learning record format is a listing of the student<br/>
&gt; standards in each growth area.&quot;  &quot;The ES evaluates the learning by<br/>
&gt; indicating the student standards in which progress has occurred <br/>
during the<br/>
&gt; learning period.&quot;  &quot;Learning records must be written to reflect the<br/>
&gt; requirements of independent study law.&quot;  &quot;Learning records will <br/>
include<br/>
&gt; descriptions of the major objectives and activities of the course <br/>
of study<br/>
&gt; covered by the agreement that were used within each assignment <br/>
period.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;This Charter School must administer any state mandated test <br/>
whenever one is<br/>
&gt; provided. The state mandated test for the school year 2000/01 is <br/>
the STAR9.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Each parent facilitator is required to sign a contract between the <br/>
parent<br/>
&gt; and the charter school&quot;  &quot;Students will demonstrate competency in <br/>
seven<br/>
&gt; growth area goals, determined by achievement of the student <br/>
standards.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Charter school students will perform and achieve as well as or <br/>
better than<br/>
&gt; students in traditional California public schools&quot;  &quot;Students will <br/>
achieve<br/>
&gt; competency in basic academic skills&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry, this isn&#39;t homeschooling, this is public school independent <br/>
study<br/>
&gt; with lots of criteria.  At the least it is school at home.  It sure <br/>
isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; unschooling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And some folks in CA do homeschool and have for years.  They may <br/>
not be<br/>
&gt; technically legal but they are homeschooling.  And, filing an R4 <br/>
does not<br/>
&gt; put you at the government trough, nor does it have government <br/>
regulated<br/>
&gt; requirements and government regulated standards that are enforced <br/>
by monthly<br/>
&gt; meetings with public school officials with &quot;mandatory:  portfolio, <br/>
monthly<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I may regret this, but I&#39;ve worked for and enrolled my child in a<br/>
California charter school for a couple of years now, and I feel wrong<br/>
saying nothing. I don&#39;t work for Horizon, but I have friends who do. They<br/>
are probably one of the most unschooling-friendly in the bay area - they<br/>
actually do inservices for their ES&#39;s on different methods of<br/>
homeschooling, including unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the &quot;requirements&quot; sound restrictive, but if you read them more<br/>
carefully, with a sort of creative eye, they&#39;re not too bad, and they&#39;re<br/>
vague enough to be pretty workable. For example, &quot;achieve at least as<br/>
much learning as would be required in the regular schools in California&quot;<br/>
is pretty vague, and clearly the criteria is equivalent, not identical.<br/>
Considering how little is actually learned in the public schools, I don&#39;t<br/>
see this as even being a question. I&#39;m not sure how Horizon  works the<br/>
student standards part, but I&#39;ve had no trouble finding a state standard<br/>
that matches almost anything a kid is doing. Sorting pokemon cards meets<br/>
a standard. Eating at an Indian restaurant meets a standard. Reading<br/>
archie comics for months on end meets a standard... there is no<br/>
requirement that &quot;First grade standards&quot; must be learned in first grade,<br/>
not yet anyway...<br/>
<br/>
As far as testing, no child in California, whether enrolled in a public<br/>
or private school, is required to take any standardized test. Yes, the<br/>
school is required to give it, but no one needs to come.... as far as<br/>
vaccinations, the requirements are the same for students in a charter<br/>
school or those filing an R-4 (the private school homeschooling option).<br/>
You are legally required to have an immunization record or exemption form<br/>
for each child. <br/>
<br/>
A lot of it seems to come down to the &quot;education specialist&quot; you&#39;re<br/>
working with. Some will require &quot;schooly&quot; things... my take on it was<br/>
that I wanted people to just do what they were doing anyway, and I would<br/>
turn it into acceptable paperwork. Things were a lot easier before the<br/>
Jan. 1, 2000 law change... but even now it works for most kids that I<br/>
have worked with. It *is* work - you have to be willing to sit down and<br/>
think about (or take notes on) things that are happening through the<br/>
month, and most charters require that your kids give up some &quot;work<br/>
samples&quot; -  ours are generally photos, score sheets from games, and<br/>
little bits of paper with stuff like &quot;When will you be off the fone?!?!!&quot;<br/>
written on them. Even though I work for the charter, my daughter doesn&#39;t<br/>
have to be enrolled, but she has wanted to do so because of the extra<br/>
$1100 a year she gets through them, for tie dye kits and sculpey and<br/>
worms and any book her little heart desires... <br/>
<br/>
With that said, I&#39;m pretty sure that even with my talent at<br/>
educationalese, a lot of my paperwork is probably not what the state has<br/>
in mind. It has passed a couple of audits, but mostly the audits were to<br/>
make sure the dates matched and the forms were all signed in the right<br/>
places. OTOH, I do think it&#39;s pretty cool to imagine the bigwigs at the<br/>
state reading about Calvin and Hobbes in language arts, and Monty Python<br/>
videos in Social Studies, and stringing necklaces in Math, and riding<br/>
roller coasters and skateboarding in Science. I have only just managed to<br/>
restrain myself from turning in work sample mad libs that say things like<br/>
&quot;One day a butthead man was walking down the weewee.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if it all ends tomorrow I&#39;m okay with that, it really is honestly<br/>
all about the money. Because of a variety of factors we won&#39;t be<br/>
chartering next yeaf, either as a student or employee. The direction<br/>
things are going is not good, but it has been fun while it lasted. I do<br/>
think, though, that it is dead wrong to say that what we&#39;re doing is not<br/>
homeschooling, or unschooling, just because we sit down once a month and<br/>
write up what we did. I don&#39;t think anyone could spend a day or week or<br/>
month with us and say that..<br/>

&gt; &gt; Sorry, this isn&#39;t homeschooling, this is public school independent<br/>
&gt; study<br/>
&gt; &gt; with lots of criteria.  At the least it is school at home.  It sure<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And some folks in CA do homeschool and have for years.  They may<br/>
&gt; not be<br/>
&gt; &gt; technically legal but they are homeschooling.  And, filing an R4<br/>
&gt; does not<br/>
&gt; &gt; put you at the government trough, nor does it have government<br/>
&gt; regulated<br/>
&gt; &gt; requirements and government regulated standards that are enforced<br/>
&gt; by monthly<br/>
&gt; &gt; meetings with public school officials with &quot;mandatory:  portfolio,<br/>
&gt; monthly<br/>
&gt; &gt; review of work, Star test.&quot;<br/>

I watched a bit of it on ESPN, and I can hardly believe it. My daughter is <br/>
the same age as some of them, and I did not even know the words they were <br/>
asking for most of what I heard. Who in the world uses these words on a daily <br/>
basis? Oh well, to each their own I guess. I love spelling and always have, <br/>
but I found this a bit surreal. (Gee, hope thats spelled right!!)<br/>
