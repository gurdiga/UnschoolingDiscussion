&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any opinions on Suzuki music lessons.  My 4.5 yod has<br/>
&gt; &gt; expressed an interest  in learning the violin, so I&#39;m considering Suzuki,<br/>
&gt; &gt; although the closest school is about a 45 min. drive away and she would<br/>
&gt; &gt; need to go twice/week.  Any input would be appreciated.<br/>

<br/>
Well, I guess I do have some expertise on this one.  I&#39;m attaching the little<br/>
section in my book (&quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me&quot;) on Suzuki below.  I&#39;ll be<br/>
happy to e-mail the whole chapter (and the little appendix on &quot;How to Choose a<br/>
Music Teacher&quot;) to whomever asks.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I&#39;d add to what I wrote below is that it is somewhat rare to find<br/>
a real Suzuki teacher in the U.S., outside of major cities.  If you (as parent)<br/>
are not required to take instruction separately from your child, you are not<br/>
getting Suzuki -- that is integral to the method, and in Japan, there is no<br/>
&quot;Suzuki&quot; instruction without it.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I&#39;d add (which I say at length in Skylark), is that no method is<br/>
the right one if it doesn&#39;t take account of the particularities of your own<br/>
child. I began with a strong bias in favor of the Suzuki method (and am still<br/>
biased in its favor), and yet ended up with two musical children, for neither of<br/>
whom was Suzuki the best approach.  This is mainly because they didn&#39;t fit the<br/>
profile (as below.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be happy to share more as needed.   (P.S. -- given other possible choices,<br/>
I DON&#39;T recommend the violin for a child, unless she is REALLY committed to it<br/>
-- of all instruments -- with the possible exception of the oboe as I have<br/>
learned from my older one -- it is the instrument least likely to provide quick<br/>
gratification to the ear.  There are other, better choices for most young &#39;ums,<br/>
piano being the first -- it is always in tune if you keep it that way, and your<br/>
child will be able to play a tune the first day!)<br/>
<br/>
David<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Seeing and hearing Ali and our younger daughter Meera today, parents often ask<br/>
our opinion of the Suzuki method.  This is despite the fact that neither of our<br/>
children learned by utilizing it.  But for what it&#39;s worth, from what we know,<br/>
we look upon Suzuki quite favorably.  Firstly, it must be said that Suzuki is<br/>
single-handedly responsible for hundreds or even thousands of string programs<br/>
springing up in elementary and middle schools across the country, which, for<br/>
some children, is the best experience they will ever have in school.  When Ellen<br/>
and I were growing up, the violin was thought to be simply too difficult for all<br/>
but the most talented children.  Band instruments, pianos, or even, perish the<br/>
thought, accordions! (I too have my own prejudices) were the recommended choices<br/>
for pre-teens.  Now we know, thanks to Suzuki, that stringed instruments can be<br/>
taught effectively to children at an early age.  Furthermore, recent brain<br/>
research suggests that for a string player to have any real hopes of succeeding,<br/>
instruction should commence before age 12 (and preferably much earlier) to<br/>
reinforce brain/fine-motor skill interactions.  I would note, however, that my<br/>
own experience and that of the late John Holt, a founder of the modern<br/>
homeschooling movement who successfully took up the cello after age 40, are firm<br/>
reminders that our early childhoods do not have to be the sole determinants of<br/>
our musical destinies.<br/>
<br/>
 Secondly, Suzuki insists on substantial parental involvement, more than just<br/>
driving one&#39;s child to and from lessons.  In some larger Suzuki schools<br/>
including most of those in Japan, parents are required to attend their own<br/>
classes while their children are learning.  That level of parental commitment is<br/>
sure to redound to the child&#39;s benefit, as is the creation of a musical<br/>
community.<br/>
<br/>
 Thirdly, the early stages of Suzuki teaching focus on repetitive motion<br/>
training.  It&#39;s rather like learning to throw a baseball the right way -- you&#39;re<br/>
more likely to get it if you do it a couple of thousand times.  Repetitive<br/>
motion training is particularly useful for the majority of children who are<br/>
reasonably physically coordinated, have moderately good musical ears, but may<br/>
not yet be ready to tackle complex symbol systems.<br/>
<br/>
Fourthly, the selections included in the well-edited Suzuki music books are<br/>
meticulously chosen to allow a child to progress and gain technical<br/>
proficiency.  The accompanying music tapes provide an aural crutch and standard<br/>
by which students can chart their own progress.<br/>
<br/>
 Lastly, while there have been some notable exceptions, Suzuki was under no<br/>
illusion that he was going to produce a bumper crop of virtuosi, though he<br/>
surely had his share.  His goal was to create a climate in which music could be<br/>
better appreciated by young and old, and raise the general benchmark levels of<br/>
musical performance.  The major growth of community youth symphonies around the<br/>
U.S. and the rest of the world, even at a time when general understanding and<br/>
appreciation of classical music is on the decline, in part attests to Suzuki&#39;s<br/>
success.  If today I have a single quibble with the application of Suzuki&#39;s<br/>
work, it is with some Suzuki teachers who, at some remove from the master,<br/>
elevate technique over musicianship, control and method over total involvement<br/>
and the free flight of the child&#39;s imagination.  But then I wouldn&#39;t only say<br/>
that about Suzuki teachers!<br/>
<br/>
 Regardless of what we might think of Suzuki, after six months of sawing, Ali<br/>
informed us and her music teacher in no uncertain terms:  she wanted to read the<br/>
notes.  Out went Suzuki and in came Leopold Mozart, scales, and later, the<br/>
progressively more difficult exercise books....&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610228906">Consider the fiddle!  Same instrument (violin) -- different spirit. My dd<br/>
wanted to play the violin and we just lucked out in finding a classcally<br/>
trained teacher and celtic fiddle performer. Here in New England there are<br/>
many opportunities to hear and dance to fiddle music and I imagine this is<br/>
true of other parts of the country as well.  For our family this has made<br/>
for a wonderfully connecting community integrated musical experience.  It<br/>
builds nicely on our family interest in folk music and my daughter&#39;s<br/>
passion for dance in any form.  My husband is a big jazz enthusiast and<br/>
fiddling is also improvisational in nature so there&#39;s that connection too.<br/>
After 9 months Bella and I can &quot;jam&quot; together -- I play flute.  This is an<br/>
incredible joy for me. She has joined in with other musicians and singers<br/>
at house parties.  She is getting solid classical technique and also loves<br/>
to listen to classical music and attend classical concerts (and Ballet) but<br/>
fiddle music has definately captured her fancy. And it&#39;s not all jigs and<br/>
hoedown stuff by any means -- one of her favorite tunes of late &quot;is a<br/>
rather sad Scottish waltz&quot; (to quote her).  It is incredibly beautiful!<br/>
Reading David&#39;s book I know that his daughter chose to pursue classical<br/>
instead of fiddling but I just wanted to put out another possible path out<br/>
there for those drawn to the violin.   I too loved the story about the<br/>
children improvising together!  Amy in NH</div>

&gt; Hi Amy,<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re in Keene -- Bella&#39;s fiddle teacher is near Amhurst in Ma. and he<br/>
also<br/>
&gt; teaches a boy her age who is also a homeschooler -- we hope to hook up<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; them.  Do I recall right that you are in Lowell?<br/>
&gt; Ever been to Wingarsheek Beach?<br/>
&gt; Amy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Amy,<br/>
&gt; &gt;where in nh are you?<br/>

&gt; We just confirmed a week of camping on cape cod a bit south of P. Town.<br/>
&gt; What do you mean by &quot;educational&quot;?  We used to go to Wingarsheek all the<br/>
&gt; time when we lived in Brookline.  It&#39;s well worth the 2 hours it takes us<br/>
&gt; to get there now.  Are you hooked up with the Boston area homeschoolers at<br/>
&gt; all?  Keene is nice but tends to be less diverse and not as socially<br/>
&gt; progressive as other places we have lived.  Amy<br/>
