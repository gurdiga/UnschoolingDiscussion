<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537383054">Hi:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering if there are any other unschoolers who are doing this solo -- as in single parent?  I have 2 girls (ages 9 & 10) and we&#39;ve unschooled for a year.  I&#39;ve worked at home most of their lives.  They did go to school for a few years (my own ignorance), but then I learned about the wonderful world of homeschooling, then unschooling, and we&#39;re loving it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d just like to connect with anyone else in a similar position, if possible.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Joanne<br/>
