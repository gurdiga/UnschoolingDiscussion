My 11-year old granddaughter has always needed to be in control and has<br/>
managed to quite well with doing attractive things, so the other kids are<br/>
drawn to it, and taking care of all things, so they naturally come to her.<br/>
She is the oldest of 12 cousins who get together frequently--they are 11, 9,<br/>
8, 7, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, and 6 months.  She is able to play, guide the<br/>
play, watch over the littlies, and still take breaks to come in and join in<br/>
the adult conversation, something which has become very important to her<br/>
these last few months.  We have all recognized her strong personality all<br/>
her life and only ask that she do things in a positive manner and that she<br/>
take responsibility for what she is choosing to do--no martyrdom allowed.<br/>
(No, she does not have to take care of the &quot;babies&quot; ALL the time, but if she<br/>
is choosing to, she needs to correct and redirect them in a positive way;<br/>
No, she does not have to feed ALL the animals, someone else will do it if<br/>
she does not want to, however, she is not going to be able to harass them<br/>
til they do).<br/>
<br/>
My situation is probably quite different from yours.  I am having to remind<br/>
myself to &quot;let&quot; her help me, or even ask for her help, when doing things<br/>
like cooking and setting up the meal.  I think I integrated my own children<br/>
into being an equal part of all that was done in the house, kitchen, etc.,<br/>
much sooner and easier that I am with my grands.  I find myself doing it<br/>
easily enough when only one or two are here, but still a little overwhelmed<br/>
when needing to quickly feed 11 (the littlest is still just nursing!).  In<br/>
short, she is much faster and more efficient than I am now and seems to need<br/>
the recognition of her ability.  So I am in the process of consulting her<br/>
first (and the others as they come forth and are interested) now when meal<br/>
planning, day planning, etc.<br/>
<br/>
These kids are all in homeschooling families.  It is so nice to be able to<br/>
be a part of their day-to-day lives and watch them grow.  However,<br/>
grandparenting does present as many challenges as parenting did/does.  I am<br/>
certainly enjoying the discussions and relating them to the ones I know and<br/>
love.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295197430">Yes that is a great idea (horse back riding)<br/>
Do you mean she did something just for the 12 year old?<br/>
as in the other kids were not old enough or had other interests?<br/>
Maybe that is something she needs...at times I do not feel that I am there enough for her and maybe it is time to let loose a little?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369090852">I am wondering if &quot;control&quot; is our best word in this discussion.  Parents<br/>
make decisions which their children must live with.  In regard to<br/>
TV....parents decide whether to own a television at all.  (I know one brave<br/>
person here piped up to say they didn&#39;t.),  whether to own more than one,<br/>
whether to put them in children&#39;s bedrooms,  main rooms or more out-of the<br/>
way rooms,  etc.    In any of these circumstances,  one could maintain the<br/>
no limits/controls idea....but the parents decision certainly has a lot of<br/>
influence.<br/>
<br/>
Parents primarily choose what books,toys and games will be in the house.<br/>
How many museums,  parks, nightclubs, theaters, stores you may visit.<br/>
Parents choose what groceries will come into the home,  how often and where<br/>
meals are eaten out,  etc.<br/>
<br/>
When our children are toddlers,  we may restrict them from certain cabinets<br/>
and rooms by using locks and gates.  We may be allowing as much freedom as<br/>
we think is reasonable and safe.  ....and we will expand their boundaries<br/>
and choices as they grow and change.<br/>
<br/>
Even those of us who treat our children as little humans and NOT little<br/>
projects or objects or players in a competition with &quot;the Joneses&quot;....even<br/>
we influence our children by controlloing some things about their life.<br/>
<br/>
And in a family......everybody&#39;s needs must be somehow balanced.  If a young<br/>
child is awake into the wee hours,  an adult needs to be awake too....and an<br/>
adult needs to be up with any early birds....But the adult(s) in the home<br/>
need to get their needs met (dare I say it?)  before the childrens needs.<br/>
(Think oxygen on airplanes.)<br/>
<br/>
I see this as providing our children with the freedoms they can safely<br/>
manage....and staying aware of their growth...enabling their choices to<br/>
broaden with growth.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this makes some sense...I&#39;ve got a tired toddler here who needs<br/>
attention..<br/>
TTFN,<br/>
Susan<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Experts have been telling moms for years that kids &quot;need&quot; limits.  They<br/>
&gt; are can only feel truly safe and loved when they have limits.  That can<br/>
&gt; be hard to get past.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I believe moms can know their kids very well.  I also have seen plenty of<br/>
&gt; moms who just think they do.  Maybe a kid gets grumpy if he watches TV<br/>
&gt; all day.  But maybe he&#39;s grumpy because he didn&#39;t get anything to eat.<br/>
&gt; Maybe he didn&#39;t feel good in the first place and that&#39;s why he chose to<br/>
&gt; sit and watch TV.  Maybe he chose TV because he couldn&#39;t think of<br/>
&gt; something else and he&#39;s grumpy because he&#39;s frustrated.  Maybe he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; grumpy because mom keeps saying &quot;are you just going to sit there all<br/>
&gt; day??&quot;    I think it&#39;s easy to assume it&#39;s the TV because after all, we<br/>
&gt; all  *know*  TV is bad for kids!( they need limits!)    On an unschooling<br/>
&gt; list, I don&#39;t see the harm in asking, - are you sure it was the TV--<br/>
&gt; maybe you didn&#39;t think of this other reason.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also know,  when our decisions are questioned all the time, it&#39;s easy<br/>
&gt; to become defensive.  Many of us have friends, family members and even<br/>
&gt; partners who don&#39;t support our choice to unschool.  One more person<br/>
&gt; asking a question can feel like an attack,  when it was really just meant<br/>
&gt; to be a question,  something to consider.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No matter what anyone on this list, or anywhere else,  says or thinks or<br/>
&gt; implies,  we all still have the ability to make our own decisions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Controlling kids is a huge issue.  Some people use their religion as an<br/>
&gt; excuse,  some people just like the power, some people just never think<br/>
&gt; about it.  Telling someone else what to do, what to think, what to eat,<br/>
&gt; what to wear, how to behave--these are control issues.  Questioning them<br/>
&gt; seems appropriate on an unschooling list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know this one true thing.  My own son is delighted to be alive.  He&#39;s<br/>
&gt; happy to be a kid. He has no issues, no problems.   He is free to make<br/>
&gt; his own choices.<br/>
&gt; When someone says their child is unhappy or unhealthy,  I know there<br/>
&gt; could be a million reasons for it, but I&#39;ve seen so many examples of the<br/>
&gt; reason being control of the child&#39;s life by the parent.<br/>

near.  As the child grows, you notice that he&#39;s pushing on the gate.  That <br/>
means that it&#39;s probably time for the fence to get pushed back a bit.  You <br/>
push the fence back and the child is happy.  You keep doing that every time <br/>
the child pushes at the gate.  Eventually, the child opens the gate and <br/>
walks out, but he&#39;s welcome to come back in whenever he wants.  As he gets <br/>
older, he comes back less and less until he&#39;s on his own and only comes for <br/>
visits.<br/>
<br/>
I think we all use some sort of &quot;fenced yard&quot; for our really little <br/>
kids.  And we probably all differ as to where we put the fence and at what <br/>
ages.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803832453">Hubby rarely pays any attention to what goes on with what he calls the<br/>
&quot;radical cyber ladies.&quot;  However, when I read him one of my replies to see<br/>
if it made sense to him, he commented that all this freedom and letting kids<br/>
do as they please (his words, not mine), is nothing new and he doesn&#39;t buy<br/>
the argument that limits create rebellion.  His argument with it being &quot;I<br/>
got to eat as much candy as I wanted.  If I had a bag of it I could sit down<br/>
and eat it all at once.  I ate what I wanted when I wanted.  I did what I<br/>
wanted with few if any restrictions.  I watched unlimited amounts of<br/>
television. It was the same at most of my friends&#39; houses.  The only thing<br/>
we had to do was go to school and we did it when we wanted.  When I got to<br/>
the late teen stage I rebelled.  I don&#39;t know against what because there<br/>
weren&#39;t any things to rebell against.  Strange thing is that I don&#39;t want my<br/>
kids to grow up without limits.  I don&#39;t want them pigging out on as much<br/>
candy as they want and I don&#39;t want them sitting like zombies watching what<br/>
I don&#39;t think is age appropriate.  So how does that fit in with the freedom<br/>
of choice brigade.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I grew up in a very controlled environment.  I was already 16 and in bed<br/>
by 9PM.  The front door was locked at 7PM.  I couldn&#39;t answer the phone<br/>
without permission.  It never occurred to me to rebel because I never<br/>
realized that was a choice.  I was like a zombie.  I didn&#39;t wake up<br/>
until I was in my 30&#39;s.  I envy your childhood, Tina.  It sounds like<br/>
you had fun and were very aware of the world around you.  I wasn&#39;t aware<br/>
of anything.<br/>
