&lt;&lt; What is *she* interested in? What does *she* want to know more about?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And it&#39;s okay if she says TV! ;-) As long as she has other things that<br/>
interest her just as much available, and isnt choosing TV just because it&#39;s<br/>
the best of a bad lot of choices, then she&#39;s learning. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Learning about TV is a heck of a lot of electronics and physics and such.<br/>
She&#39;s probably going to be learning language, geography, history, math, <br/>
science and such from television shows.<br/>
<br/>
Last night my husband said something really stupid.  REALLY stupid.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
say anything to him, but shot him a dirty look.  <br/>
<br/>
We had a couple over for whose wedding we&#39;re playing recorder.  We were <br/>
talking about music, and when we were done were talking about games and <br/>
this&#39;n&#39;that.   The woman has a son Kirby&#39;s age and one much younger.  We&#39;ve <br/>
known them for years and years, through the SCA.  She got divorced and her <br/>
husband and his new wife wanted to homeschool the boys, and did for a while, <br/>
but the real mom couldn&#39;t stand it and so the kids are in school.    <br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s dumb thing was this:  He characterized Zoombinis as a &quot;pseudo <br/>
educational game.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It really made me angry, because Keith KNOWS how much real math is in that <br/>
game.   I&#39;m sure if we had had a time-out moment, magically, he would have <br/>
said that&#39;s not exactly what he meant to say.  But that&#39;s what he said, and <br/>
this mom is already determined not to see learning except in school.<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s the dumbest thing Keith does this month I will be living entirely <br/>
in the lap of luxury, huh?  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m going to find the page Jocelyn Vilter found once about how much math <br/>
is in Zoombinis, and forward him the URL at work, tell him it was kind of a <br/>
faux pas to say that in front of Sharon, and that will be about it.<br/>
