<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786462521">There is an inclusive homeschooling conference in Colorado, with Mary<br/>
Griffiths as chief speaker, sometime in late August.  And something<br/>
brewing in South Dakota, though certainly not just unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else know of others?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414371542">There is a homeschooling conference south of Chicago in July that seems<br/>
pretty all inclusive. It is The Link Homeschool Conference on July<br/>
21-23rd in Bourbonnais, IL.  There look to be some very interesting<br/>
programs for children and adults.  For info you can check the web site<br/>
www.homeschoolnewslink.com or e-mail them at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:MBL17@...">MBL17@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Also thanks to everyone for all of the food discussions.  It has been<br/>
like a light bulb going on in my head.  I checked out some books at the<br/>
library and am now preparing to get rid of the crap in my kitchen.<br/>
