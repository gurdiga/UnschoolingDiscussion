<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900259454">O&#39;Reilly of the infamous Spin Factor probably meant exactly what he said<br/>
even though that is probably not what the stats were.  He began the segment<br/>
with his usual rant that &quot;even with all the promises Clinton made, blah,<br/>
blah, blah&quot; and went on to say &quot;now we&#39;ll see if Bush can blah, blah, blah.&quot;<br/>
Then he ranted about wasting money and that the only thing schools needed<br/>
was discipline.  Then he stated that 63% of all black 4th graders couldn&#39;t<br/>
read.  He later added that 60% of all &quot;poor&quot; 4th graders couldn&#39;t read.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I e-mailed him to ask where he got his stats but if he runs true to<br/>
form, he won&#39;t say.  AND, when presented with the correct stats he will not<br/>
acknowledge them!  Guaranteed!!!!!<br/>

<br/>
Where would &quot;correct stats&quot; come from?<br/>
<br/>
The definition of &quot;reading&quot; varies greatly.  Getting good grades on reading <br/>
lessons is usually considered &quot;reading.&quot;   Reading lessons often consist of <br/>
phonics worksheets the first few years, and multiple choice or <br/>
fill-in-the-blanks after that for a while.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Reading&quot; in 4th grade has never meant fluent reading of large blocks of <br/>
texts except for the few best readers in each class.  Others stumble along <br/>
sounding things out.  Lots of homeschoolers seem not to know that, and they <br/>
pressure their kids a lot.  They see one eight year old reading Harry Potter <br/>
(they don&#39;t know with how much ease or comprehension) and they think ALL <br/>
should be able to if they&#39;re not lazy.  That&#39;s the worst thing I see in <br/>
homeschoolers, is unreasonable expectation and then shaming the kids for <br/>
being behind.<br/>
<br/>
I think we should turn away from school and its problems and be with our <br/>
children right where they are--right where they are in learning about fish <br/>
and the air and fire and drawing and music and whatever they&#39;re learning, <br/>
looking at them, not at a &quot;4th grade book.&quot;  We are doing as much for school <br/>
reform by taking our kids out as are the most rabid school reformers.  We are <br/>
creating a control group, the results of which will be miscontrued, but <br/>
there&#39;s no avoiding that--there are no statistics to be had on unschoolers <br/>
either, not yet and maybe never will be, but there will be anecdotal <br/>
impressive exceptions, and there will someday be researchers and politicians <br/>
able to say &quot;I wasn&#39;t taught to read and I could read fluently by eleven&quot; or <br/>
whenever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-545199233">For example, he made a comment about the quality of education in CA.  He<br/>
told the head of the school system in SF that since they were dumbing down<br/>
the kids he might as well send them to Eureka as they would fit right in.<br/>
When provided with &quot;correct&quot; as in &quot;accurate&quot; information which included<br/>
results from all the counties, all the school districts and the national<br/>
results which clearly showed that students in Humboldt County outscored SF,<br/>
he ignored them.<br/>
<br/>
As to correct information, perhaps I should have phrased it as he should<br/>
correctly state his facts.  I did a web search through the local school<br/>
district and the over-all numbers do not show that 60% of the POOR (he<br/>
stated poor) 4th graders cannot read.  It did show that in SOME poor areas<br/>
of the country 60% of the 4th graders could not read fluently and/or at<br/>
grade level.<br/>
<br/>
Now, what grade level is in reading, one more area that has been dumbed<br/>
down.  If you go and get a book printed in the 50s and find a current copy<br/>
of it and it is a book that includes a reading level, you will find that<br/>
what &quot;was&quot; 4th grade level is now listed as 5th or 6th grade level.<br/>
<br/>
Being an unschooler does not, IMHO and without links to back this up,<br/>
relieve me of a responsibility to my world.  Part of my world is encompassed<br/>
by other folks who are not knowledgable enough to fight for themselves.<br/>
Part of my world is being beat down by highly visable experts who pass out<br/>
as &quot;fact&quot; their opinion.  The result is the shaming of some people.  I don&#39;t<br/>
find that acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
Because O&#39;Reilly the Spin Doctor doesn&#39;t like how much money is being spent<br/>
on Title One is no excuse for him to make statements as facts to support his<br/>
pet peeves when what he is stating is not fact.  In many cases it is pure<br/>
invention or wishful thinking.  I have no idea where he gets the information<br/>
he uses but a lot of it is simply his opinion based on his exaggerated idea<br/>
of his own self-worth and expertise.<br/>
<br/>
One of his favorites is &quot;I know how to run schools and fix the education<br/>
system because I went to Harvard and I was a teacher.&quot;  He taught for two<br/>
years, some expert.<br/>
