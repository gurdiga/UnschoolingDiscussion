<div id="ygrps-yiv-572223967">The other day my colleague who also lives across the hall from me was<br/>
talking about her apartment and how she has organized things. She has 3<br/>
kids and has kept one of the bedrooms as a television/playroom in which the<br/>
whole family spends lots of time. She was thrilled to describe how she<br/>
could now keep her living room completely tidy with NO kids toys or clutter<br/>
in it. This way when friends came over things were neat and no one had to<br/>
be bothered with the children as they would all be out of sight. Her kids<br/>
also got a cat recently but they only kept it for 2 weeks as she couldn&#39;t<br/>
stand the mess it was probably making it. Now keep in mind this family also<br/>
has a fulltime live-in maid as do most people here so my colleague doesn&#39;t<br/>
actually have to do any cleaning or cooking herself.<br/>
<br/>
After the conversation I didn&#39;t think much of it until this morning as I<br/>
was in the shower. I remembered when we moved in here being very excited as<br/>
the place has 5 bathrooms and so I was thrilled at the idea of having my<br/>
own (our last place had 1 bathroom so I was coming off that:) But today I<br/>
looked around at all the extra &quot;stuff&quot; that seems to have gravitated in<br/>
with me. The rubber ducks and baby shampoo for the newest little one. The<br/>
foam letters with all the kids&#39; names that were plastered on the walls from<br/>
my 8-year-old. Bubbles, plastic ball, water balloon, funnel, teen face<br/>
wash.... <br/>
<br/>
When I hit the living room I saw the mini trampoline, the big Arabic<br/>
cushions that the boys use for tumbling, baby playmat, dog and cat toys,<br/>
pictures all over the walls, book shelf full of kid and adult books and<br/>
stuff. Boxes of legos and playmobile, and a skateboard in one corner.<br/>
Someone has placed a cowboy hat on my 5 foot Malaysian Goddess statue and<br/>
there seems to be a bouncy ball in the mouth of one of my African masks.<br/>
The Zen garden has small plastic animals in it as well as an umbrella from<br/>
a fancy drink. Along the window there are 2 statues of Buddhas as well as 6<br/>
orangina bottles with different colored water in them (they catch the light<br/>
and look cool according to 3rd son). My computer desk is piled with cds of<br/>
various things, rocks and shells to look at in the microscope, and two<br/>
pencil holders made out of clay (they don&#39;t actually hold pencils and are<br/>
enormous but were made with love). This is in addition to various lego<br/>
sculptures placed around the furniture.<br/>
<br/>
But you know I look at all this and I just think how beautiful. This to me<br/>
is topnotch interior design. I couldn&#39;t imagine living my life without<br/>
being surrounded by all these things that represent my family. I may<br/>
sometimes snap a little when I stand barefoot on lego or can&#39;t find a free<br/>
chair as they are all part of a huge tent. But I couldn&#39;t imagine living in<br/>
a house in which my children didn&#39;t feel welcome to be in every room. <br/>
<br/>
It just seems to me that if you can&#39;t share the rooms of your home with<br/>
your children then how can you share their lives. I really feel sorry for<br/>
my colleague as she cannot see past the &quot;mess&quot; to the beauty of her children.<br/>

Thanks for that sweet post Kate.<br/>
I needed that today! I&#39;m surrounded by chaos with no hope of ever digging out <br/>
in this tiny house.....oh well.<br/>
