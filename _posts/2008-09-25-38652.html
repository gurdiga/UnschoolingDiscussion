<div id="ygrps-yiv-187874070">Hello wise ones,<br/>
Pasted below is a part of Joyce Fetterol&#39;s site. I&#39;m wondering if some one<br/>
can lead me to more links, essays on the topic &quot;taking care of our own<br/>
needs&quot;.  I&#39;m feeling a little burnt out and perhaps as a result confused<br/>
about where to find our balance.   Breathing now :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you! Hema - (missing dh due to his crazy work-hours, who is the only<br/>
other person besides me who the kids love being with... anyone else they<br/>
care for is too far away geographically speaking.... and all other<br/>
relationships here in India are too new for them)<br/>
<br/>
FROM the topic &quot;Taking care of our own needs&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
*Sometimes I&#39;m too too tired to go out at 10 pm to get some candy that he<br/>
wants. We&#39;ll discuss the options like creating something else or eating what<br/>
we&#39;ve got in the house. I&#39;ve noticed a trend these days that he&#39;s accepting<br/>
of my limits more.*<br/>
<br/>
*Sandra Dodd: I&#39;m going to jump off from there. He WILL accept limits more<br/>
as he knows they&#39;re thoughtful/compassionate/respectful of him. But aside<br/>
from the good part of the statement above, I want to move toward what might<br/>
be a misunderstanding.*<br/>
<br/>
*Letting kids have their choice of what&#39;s in the house, or letting them pick<br/>
things at the store are natural parts of everyday life. Going out after dark<br/>
to get something someone craves isn&#39;t, unless people were restless and<br/>
wanting to get out anyway, or needed to pick someone up from a movie or a<br/>
friend&#39;s house, or whatever honest out-of-house reason there might be.*<br/>
<br/>
*The only things people should really be expected to go out for after dark,<br/>
I think, are necessities like toilet paper, maybe milk, drinking water if<br/>
they have bad water and no filter.*<br/>
<br/>
*I have two or three times gone out with Holly, walking to the Texaco just<br/>
for candy or the walk. We could&#39;ve driven, but it was more the nighttime<br/>
adventure than the candy bar.*<br/>
<br/>
*If one of mine says &quot;I wish we had M&Ms&quot; I&#39;ll say &quot;Put it on the list and<br/>
I&#39;ll get some tomorrow.&quot; (or if groceries were just bought, &quot;next time&quot;)*<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;My kids can have what they want&quot; (which gets said a lot by many long term<br/>
unschoolers) doesn&#39;t mean &quot;... in the whole earth, any time of the day or<br/>
night.&quot;*<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;I don&#39;t limit my kids&#39; video games&quot; does NOT mean &quot;I buy them every game<br/>
and system that comes out.&quot; It means the parents aren&#39;t forbidding or timing<br/>
or whatever.*<br/>
<br/>
*And if we say &quot;Whatever&#39;s in the house, they can have,&quot; some newer readers<br/>
seem to smugly determine just never to have candy or video games in the<br/>
house.*<br/>
<br/>
*There&#39;s a balance.*<br/>
<br/>
*The extremes aren&#39;t so good. Neither deprivation nor crazily trying to<br/>
provide everything a child has ever seen or imagined is going to work.*<br/>

problem is! I want to know what you do about a batch of cookies. If my<br/>
child wants to eat them all the day I made them, do I let him? And he<br/>
will, because *I&#39;VE* done it! I KNOW I&#39;m eating unhealthy, though, and<br/>
though he knows, too, it&#39;s the knowledge of a four-year-old who<br/>
doesn&#39;t REALLY get that 12 cookies MIGHT not be a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
I know you can have a plate or what-not of available snacks. But I<br/>
LOVE baking. If I make a batch, or two, do I hide some for later? Or<br/>
do we just all dig in a finish it in a day and then wait for a few<br/>
days to make more? (my tendency is to make a batch right away since<br/>
*I* have the sweet tooth.)<br/>
<br/>
My kids eat plenty of good stuff, but I don&#39;t know how to make sure<br/>
they don&#39;t get too many sweets. Did your kids gradually back off once<br/>
you said &quot;eat as many as you like&quot; or do you only have a certain<br/>
number of cookies available for that day (for everyone, not just the<br/>
kids...)<br/>
<br/>
In other words, will they stop eating 5 at a time if the cookies are<br/>
there and available, or do I not make them available? It&#39;s not that I<br/>
don&#39;t trust them, but that if they&#39;re anything like me, then cookies<br/>
it is, for breakfast, lunch, and supper (and I DO eat them at every<br/>
meal at this point....)<br/>
<br/>
So help me - should I stop? Or will they learn what I never did (which<br/>
would be wonderful, because then I wouldn&#39;t have to worry...) But I&#39;m<br/>
afraid I&#39;m sabotaging them, and so the fault lies with me, not them.<br/>
If so, I can learn to stop...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But you do want to! This is one of those mental shifts. You want your  <br/>
kids to only eat as many sweets as you think are good for them. And  <br/>
you want what you think to be right. So in your mind you do have a  <br/>
limit. You just don&#39;t want to be the sweets Nazi. You want the kids  <br/>
to internalize what you believe is right and limit themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If my<br/>
&gt; child wants to eat them all the day I made them, do I let him?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What will happen if he does eat them all in one day?<br/>
<br/>
What if you make another batch and he eats that too? What will happen?<br/>
<br/>
If you buy ten bags of flour and keep making batches of cookies, how  <br/>
many do you think he&#39;ll eat? All of them?<br/>
<br/>
If you do that every day, do you think he&#39;d keep eating cookies  <br/>
everyday until he exploded?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And he will, because *I&#39;VE* done it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do you think he and you are the same person? Does he like the  <br/>
exact same things you do? Does he dislike the exact same things as  <br/>
you do?<br/>
<br/>
Just because something is possible, doesn&#39;t mean it will happen.<br/>
<br/>
Just because we gave birth to them, doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re our clones.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect you know all that. I&#39;m telling you the obvious *but*  <br/>
sometimes our fears can override our common sense. We&#39;ll set aside  <br/>
what makes sense to do some voodoo just to make sure some possible  <br/>
bad thing doesn&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
And questions make us squirm. We don&#39;t have the textbook and we  <br/>
didn&#39;t study. What if we get the answer wrong???<br/>
<br/>
I knew I couldn&#39;t be trusted around candy. I had proof. I opened up a  <br/>
bag of Halloween candy before Halloween and in 2 or 3 days, 3 bags of  <br/>
candy were gone.<br/>
<br/>
But actually what I had proof of is how I react to deprivation. I  <br/>
didn&#39;t buy candy except at Halloween. It was the only time I could  <br/>
get it so *of course* I packed in as much as I could before it  <br/>
disappeared for another year.<br/>
<br/>
So I gave myself permission to have candy. If I finished one bag  <br/>
(Almond M&Ms were irresistible at the time) I promised myself I could  <br/>
have another. It did take 3 bags! but I did get over the craving. We  <br/>
now buy bags of Dove milk chocolate miniatures and have Ghirardelli  <br/>
chocolate bits in the freezer. And I can go days without eating any.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or<br/>
&gt; do we just all dig in a finish it in a day and then wait for a few<br/>
&gt; days to make more?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why wait a few days? Make 4 dozen.<br/>
<br/>
If you were thirsty would you have only one sip today then another  <br/>
tomorrow even though there&#39;s an unlimited amount coming from the tap?<br/>
<br/>
You  *could* drink water by the gallon. Do you? *Is* it just because  <br/>
water isn&#39;t as tasty as cookies? Most people would say that&#39;s true  <br/>
but most people don&#39;t have a tap of running cookies freely  <br/>
accessible ;-) So they&#39;re making assumptions without actually  <br/>
testing. They don&#39;t know what they&#39;re like when cookies are as easy  <br/>
to get as water. They only know what they&#39;re like when cookies appear  <br/>
like an oasis in a desert.<br/>
<br/>
(And if the obvious conclusion was always the true answer, no one  <br/>
would have ever questioned whether the sun goes around the earth,  <br/>
since we can see that it does, plain as day! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My kids eat plenty of good stuff, but I don&#39;t know how to make sure<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t know because you&#39;re using your external monitor to judge  <br/>
what&#39;s going on inside of someone else. Of course you can&#39;t know. So  <br/>
parents make wild guesses. Or use their &quot;gut instinct&quot;. Or look to  <br/>
experts to pass on their wild guesses or gut instincts so parents  <br/>
don&#39;t have to be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
*If* we couldn&#39;t self regulate, *if* we needed experts to tell us  <br/>
what we should and shouldn&#39;t eat, how would our species have survived  <br/>
long enough to create experts?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a mainstream article in the NY Times about eating that was  <br/>
actually very close to what we discuss here:<br/>

6 Food Mistakes Parents Make<br/>

&gt; kids...)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s something Pam wrote about TV but it applies to food and  <br/>
everything else too. Which is the really cool thing about philosophy!  <br/>
The principles that work in one area can make our view of another  <br/>
area clearer.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In other words, will they stop eating 5 at a time if the cookies are<br/>
&gt; there and available,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, what will happen if they eat 5 at a time? What if they eat a  <br/>
dozen? Your fears are stopping you from doing ... what exactly? Think  <br/>
about it! Really. Do you fear that if you let them eat 5 dozen  <br/>
cookies that they won&#39;t ever eat anything else?<br/>
<br/>
I suspect the questions are sounding snarky as though I&#39;m saying &quot;Are  <br/>
you so dim as to believe what conventional parents believe?&quot; But they  <br/>
aren&#39;t. They&#39;re honest questions. Most parents don&#39;t think. They  <br/>
fear. And they reach for answers that will soothe their fears. We ask  <br/>
people to think! :-) And ask people to try it.<br/>
<br/>
What *will* happen if you make 5 dozen cookies every day for the next  <br/>
5 weeks? Why would parents be afraid to try it? What do they fear  <br/>
would happen? (No one needs to answer that here. It&#39;s just something  <br/>
to ponder why it would seem a better idea to ask strangers than to  <br/>
really think about something and try it out. It&#39;s just pure fear that  <br/>
makes us imagine that opening the flood gate of cookies will make  <br/>
kids never want to stop stuffing them.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m betting you can&#39;t even make it 2 days before the kids say &quot;STOP!  <br/>
Let me have something besides these darn cookies!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s not that I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t trust them,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, it is that you don&#39;t trust them! Clear thinking is helped  <br/>
*hugely* by honesty. Parents are trained to say things in a nice way,  <br/>
to cover up the truth. And it really muddies thought.<br/>
<br/>
How many parents have said &quot;I asked nicely and he still didn&#39;t do  <br/>
it.&quot; Well if you *asked* then one acceptable answer was no. If no  <br/>
wasn&#39;t an acceptable answer, then it was a demand in a frilly dress.<br/>
<br/>
Take off the frilly dress and let those thoughts run naked. It&#39;s lots  <br/>
easier to see what they really look like without their costumes on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but that if they&#39;re anything like me, then cookies<br/>
&gt; it is, for breakfast, lunch, and supper (and I DO eat them at every<br/>
&gt; meal at this point....)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And you don&#39;t trust yourself either.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m betting you can&#39;t make it through 2 days of nothing but cookies  <br/>
either!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So help me - should I stop?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do you think? &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Try it. See what happens.<br/>
<br/>
Also read Sandra&#39;s and my site and the archives. Because if our kids  <br/>
*are* eating nothing but cookies, you shouldn&#39;t be asking us for  <br/>
advice! ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m positive your children won&#39;t stop eating the good stuff just <br/>
because cookies are available.  In fact, how about putting some <br/>
cookies on their dinner plates?  They may eat the cookies first, but <br/>
they&#39;ll likely eat the rest of the stuff too! <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re way too stressed about sweets! You&#39;re giving them a lot of <br/>
power.  You&#39;re thinking of them as special and you&#39;re modeling that <br/>
for your kids.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If something yummy is around, we&#39;re likely to eat it.  It might be <br/>
cookies or cake.  It might also be yogurt, fruit, cheese, and meat.  <br/>
My family eats what is readily available and easy to grab.  A bowl of <br/>
watermelon chunks will go as fast as a plate of cookies.  Seriously.  <br/>
Make sure you have different things out and visible so they can pick <br/>
and choose what they want.  If you limit and withhold stuff from <br/>
them, you&#39;re only making those sweets seem more appealing.  Maybe <br/>
that is why you have a problem with sweets?  Were they limited for <br/>
you while you were growing up?<br/>

<br/>
My 10 year old eats a really balanced meal plan around here.  And I<br/>
don&#39;t mean balanced in the food chart kind of way.  I just mean that<br/>
he tends to eat a little of everything.  <br/>
<br/>
My three year old will go days and eat almost nothing but popsicles. <br/>
I try and buy the best most natural popsicles I can.  He LOVES<br/>
popsicles.  He is growing big and strong, he is happy, and his teeth<br/>
are not rotten.  He eats them at breakfasttime, at lunchtime, and at<br/>
dinnertime.  He&#39;s been doing this on and off for quite some time.  <br/>
<br/>
There are no guarantees whether your child will stop eating cookies. <br/>
But you are a guaranteeing a more peaceful relationship if you take<br/>
the limits off now.  As my three year year gets older, I DO notice<br/>
that he is listening to his body more and more.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835503487">It&#39;s no good using your own eating experiences as a template (or reverse <br/>
template) for how your children will behave around food - unless you were <br/>
unschooled!<br/>
<br/>
Almost all the adults I know have grown up with some kind of limiting or <br/>
emotional issues connected to food and dining, which interfered with their <br/>
ability to listen to the instinctive information that their bodies were <br/>
giving them.<br/>
<br/>
The goal with unschooling is that kids never have that inner voice <br/>
extinguished.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn eats whatever she wants, whenever she wants from the food we have in <br/>
the house or at the store. The only time I have said anything to her is if I <br/>
am concerned that she wants a caffeinated beverage and *I* want to be able <br/>
to go to bed. Observation has shown me that my fears even in this area are <br/>
unfounded, so I now hold my tongue. She has a natural understanding of her <br/>
own body&#39;s needs. Truly.<br/>
<br/>
Kids can use up the energy available to them in foods like cookies growing <br/>
and playing and climbing and jumping. They need the glucose to burn while <br/>
their brains are growing too. If you have a wide variety of foods available <br/>
over time the kids will eat a perfectly balanced diet for their daily <br/>
changing needs.<br/>
<br/>
So about the cookies - I just make big batches, and keep lots of frozen <br/>
cookie dough in the fridge and make them whenever Jayn asks for cookies. She <br/>
may &quot;binge&quot; as some would call it, on increasingly rare ocassions, but then <br/>
we will go weeks and weeks without her asking for a single cookie. She also <br/>
continues to astonish other people by saying &quot;no thank you&quot; to cookies <br/>
offered to her with much ceremony as if they were a special treat.<br/>
<br/>
Just say &quot;yes&quot; to requests. Make even more than you think they will want to <br/>
eat. Just put out the cookie jar, while saving some for absentees if they <br/>
also like cookies. Continue to put out other tasty choices also.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; My kids eat plenty of good stuff, but I don&#39;t know how to make sure<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they don&#39;t get too many sweets.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Allow them to be the arbiter of how many is too many... of anything! Sweets <br/>
are good stuff too. Once you let yourself believe that you will be more at <br/>
peace. (And they really will contintue eat healthfully for their individual <br/>
needs without emotional battles.)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry and don&#39;t make cookies something to be treasured and sneaked and <br/>
sought after and felt guilty about. All will be well.<br/>

-=-=-=-==-=-<br/>
<br/>
So at the conferences, especially this last one, every morning early I <br/>
go around picking up trash from the night before. There are *always* <br/>
empty sugar packets around. These last two years, there has been an <br/>
enormous number of sugar packets left lying on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
An &quot;outsider&quot; may say, &quot;See? These unschooled kids only eat sugar!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*MY* take is that these are children who have been up most of the night <br/>
playing (video/computer games, mostly). Their last meal was at 6:00pm. <br/>
It&#39;s 2:00AM. There&#39;s a coffee station just outside the door with sugar <br/>
packets available.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, they NEED that energy. In order to keep going, which is the <br/>
goal, they NEED nutrition. Sugar packets may not the the BEST solution, <br/>
but it&#39;s the best one available to them RIGHT NOW. They sought out what <br/>
they needed. Had I been up at that time and prepared to assist them, I <br/>
would have put out a monkey platter of meats, cheeses, nuts, fruits, <br/>
chips, spreads, and other foods that could help them through the night. <br/>
That&#39;s a good idea for future gatherings---Conference Goddesses, take <br/>
note! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But lacking help from an adult, they made do with what they had.<br/>
<br/>
Children ARE resourceful. Children whose eating is regulated for them <br/>
must *always* be craving something more---something else. Probably <br/>
sugar!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-695972778">Did your kids gradually back off once you said &quot;eat as many as you like&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No need to say that.  Just set and arrange the food you&#39;re offering out for<br/>
them.  Kids need no instructions or teaching about how to handle food.  If<br/>
you say &quot;eat as many as you like&quot; that might sound like they shouldn&#39;t think<br/>
of eating more or less or none at all.  Just let food be available.<br/>
<br/>
The trick is for you to stop waiting for your kids to back off and to enjoy<br/>
food with them.  All food.  Work on giving yourself lots of permission<br/>
instead of repeating &quot;shouldn&#39;t&#39;s&quot; to yourself (and/or others) about sugar<br/>
consumption.  Neither you nor your children will eat nothing but cookies for<br/>
the rest of your lives.  Maybe the first time and sometimes afterward<br/>
they&#39;ll have a cookiefest.  Enjoy seeing them enjoy themselves.  Cookies are<br/>
a wonderful food option.  Make it part of the other options and let the land<br/>
of food be a great place to explore.  The more generous you are with food,<br/>
the less deprived you and your children will feel about it.<br/>
<br/>
You and your children will make all kinds of food decisions along the way.<br/>
If you decide you want to lose weight, for instance, you&#39;ll make decisions<br/>
about not just food but other factors that can help you reach your goals.<br/>
Your children can do the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
And most important, it will be fun!<br/>

The quotes you brought seemed to me about finding a balance about how  <br/>
to meet kids&#39; needs, but didn&#39;t seem so much in the direction of  <br/>
&quot;caring for one&#39;s self.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe instead of a request for quotes (since none came), could we  <br/>
just discuss that topic?  (And by &quot;we&quot; I mean the rest of you,  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Try it. See what happens.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have do doubt that they&#39;d want SOMETHING besides cookies. I guess my<br/>
question comes down to, I know I always have something sweet<br/>
available, and I always eat it, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;d be healthier than if<br/>
I didn&#39;t as many as I do. But that&#39;s MY problem.<br/>
<br/>
If the KIDS end up eating mostly cookies, with good food inbetween,<br/>
because of MY obsession to have sweets around, and then they gain<br/>
weight or are unhealthy, I&#39;d feel bad, because I supplied them with<br/>
sweets.<br/>
<br/>
I know they&#39;d keep eating the good foods they like, I guess what I<br/>
don&#39;t trust is that their bodies would know what the right balance is,<br/>
and to be VERY honest, I&#39;d like to hear of past experience with other<br/>
kids. Like, &quot;Well, at first my kid ate 5 cookies inbetween meals and<br/>
sometimes FOR a meal, then they went a few days without, then back<br/>
again.&quot; or whatever...<br/>
<br/>
My thing with sweets is when I&#39;m done binging on one thing, I move on<br/>
to something else, and I don&#39;t it&#39;s not the healthiest option. But if<br/>
my kids pick it up just because I have it available for my sweet<br/>
tooth, then I do feel bad. I feel like I should only have the healthy<br/>
options there for them to choose.<br/>
<br/>
Do we as adults override or body&#39;s cues for good food because we never<br/>
learned to listen? Or am I justified in eating all the sweets I do?<br/>
<br/>
I admit that I have kept Dove chocolates, and NEVER missed a day of<br/>
eating them. I will search the house for something sweet when I run<br/>
out...I honestly have never gone without unless it&#39;s not here and I<br/>
either don&#39;t have ingredients to make something or I&#39;m too lazy to do<br/>
so, which hasn&#39;t been often.<br/>
<br/>
If I was already setting a good example, and only had sweets here and<br/>
there in our house, to be honest, I&#39;d say &quot;have at it&quot; because I&#39;d<br/>
have mostly fruit, a few cookies from time to time, and other healthy<br/>
snacks. But I tend to be a bad example.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess the question is, will the kids figure out what&#39;s good for<br/>
them in spite of &quot;bad&quot; conditions, or do I need to change the<br/>
conditions in order to better favor their bodies needs?<br/>

He does eat healthy stuff too. Maybe it is just taste and personality.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you have always offered a wide variety of foods and not done any kind of <br/>
rewards/punishment actions around food and not made them clean their plate <br/>
or &quot;try just one bite&quot; or only eaten sweets after dinner, then chances are <br/>
their instinct is unsullied.<br/>
<br/>
If you have done any of the negative stuff, which is the equivalent of <br/>
inserting static into the signal, stop and it will just take a little time. <br/>
Our bodies generally are set up to work properly. In the absence of real <br/>
medical conditions, they will work well if given a chance.<br/>
<br/>
Watch your language. Women in this culture are particularly prone to using <br/>
moral imperatives around food eg &quot;I was bad today; I ate three chocolates&quot; <br/>
or &quot;I&#39;ve been good about going to the gym so I deserve this smoothie as a <br/>
reward.&quot; Don&#39;t do it. Speak about food with enjoyment for its own sake, not <br/>
as a compass for judging your behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Beware of unconciously rewarding an empty plate with your attitude. Beware <br/>
of saying someone is a &quot;good eater&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn has always eaten a large quantity of one food at each meal, picking <br/>
slightly at the other parts. For example a lot of mashed potato, a lot of <br/>
brocolli, a lot of grean beans, a lot of breaded chicken, a lot of ice <br/>
cream, a lot of noodles, a lot of toast, a lot of bacon, a lot of cookies, a <br/>
lot of chips, a lot of strawberries. She will ask if she has a hankering for <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
As a result of long observation, I can predict when she is about to have a <br/>
growth spurt or a cognitive leap by her food choices. She will suddenly <br/>
start carbo loading, eating tons of mashed and roasted potato, tons of <br/>
noodles with a dash of oil and garlic spray, tons of toast with mayonaise, <br/>
pancakes, rice, cookies and more potatoes. Within a week or so she clearly <br/>
has made a jump of some kind - we notice it in an expansion of her <br/>
vocabulary, an increased sophistication of her observations. Generally she <br/>
will suddenly be half an inch taller too.<br/>
<br/>
She will follow this week of carbs with a few days of light eating <br/>
emphasizing protein and dairy, asking for snacks of plates of grated cheese, <br/>
chicken, steak, jerky, yoghurt, vanilla ice cream, scrambled eggs.<br/>
<br/>
If I put out sliced fruit with her snacks she will eat a lot of it. We make <br/>
skillet meals a lot, and she will pick out of them what she particularly <br/>
wants.<br/>
<br/>
In between these intermittent and unpredictable growth spurt/recovery <br/>
moments she eats a wide variety of stuff, sometimes finding it hard to <br/>
choose or know what she wants. In the absence of a hankering for something, <br/>
I just list what I have and am able to prepare and she usually finds <br/>
something appealing. If nothing seems to work, and she has said no to some <br/>
favorites, I tend to just &quot;make myself &quot; ;) something from the list that I <br/>
know she has liked in the past, and usually she will then see and smell it <br/>
and want a portion.<br/>
<br/>
When we have dinner at the table, it is usually pretty special. Jayn <br/>
decorates the table with dolls and candles. I tend to put out serving <br/>
platters of the various foods and we all help ourselves to what we want, <br/>
rather than serve up in the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn will sometimes want something to keep her going when I am in the middle <br/>
of cooking a meal. I tell her how long it will be, and she tells me what she <br/>
wants to eat in the mean time - often a cookie or some chips or crackers. So <br/>
I give it to her, and she still eats some of her dinner - as much as she <br/>
wants. Some days a lot, others a few bites.<br/>
<br/>
If Jayn gets hungry, most particularly if she is growth spurt mode, because <br/>
I haven&#39;t been watching the clock or checking in, or she has been too <br/>
occupied to notice her hunger, she can get particularly obnoxious, cranky, <br/>
aggressive and locked in to being unable to choose what to eat. <br/>
Unfortunately I usually just have to ride it out, protect myself from her <br/>
hitting and kicking, and keep on trying to get some quick food into her. <br/>
When I first see the signs I will often hurry in to the kitchen a make a <br/>
yoghurt smoothie which does the trick of restoring her equilibrium. Or I <br/>
make a sandwich. Or I give her a cookie! But truly the best thing is not to <br/>
let it get that bad - to keep food available.<br/>
<br/>
When we are out I always have the snack bag with an assortment of things. <br/>
She will eat differently out at the park than at home. For example at home <br/>
she will rarely ask for an apple, but will eat the sliced one I put out. At <br/>
the park she will come to the bag and take an apple away with her to eat. At <br/>
home she will refuse a sandwich; at the park or when playing outside, she <br/>
will eat several quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Jayn asked for homemade vanilla cupcakes, chocolate chip cookies, <br/>
corn and couscous, a grilled cheese sandwich, potato chips, sushi, sliced <br/>
apple, samples of chicken at the store, lemonade, chocolate milk, some <br/>
toblerone, ice cream and iced water. We also bought some new things at the <br/>
store to try out over the next few days, but I forgot popsicles.<br/>
<br/>
Today Jayn has asked for and had bacon and eggs, a chicken noodle stir fry <br/>
with carrots & brocolli, breaded shrimp (didn&#39;t like it), sticky cinnamon <br/>
cake with icing, strawberries and whipped cream, lemonade and iced water. <br/>
She has just asked for more corn and couscous, triggered by me reading this <br/>
list to her... (returning from the kitchen)... Alas half of the toblerone <br/>
fell on the ground yesterday so she had none left for today. But we&#39;ll get <br/>
some more next time we go out.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn&#39;s favorite vegetables are artichoke, asparagus and potatoes in various <br/>
incarnations. She also likes green beans and corn. Her favorite fruits are <br/>
pears, strawberries, apples and bananas in smoothies. She sometimes wants <br/>
peaches, grapes and oranges/mandarins. Every now and then she has a <br/>
hankering for a salad if we have chinese salad dressing - so I try to keep <br/>
it on hand. She will add garlic to anything savory. Her far and away most <br/>
favorite food is sushi, and her favorite snack is Tim&#39;s Hawaiian Chips in <br/>
Maui Onion flavor (the lilac bag).<br/>
<br/>
When we eat fast food, she will rarely consume an entire cheeseburger, and <br/>
then only if she eats no fries at all. If she eats the fries I usually find <br/>
the burger with only one bite out of it. We used to buy meringues for a <br/>
while, (that I tend to love to eat). I would give Jayn all she wanted then <br/>
later find half meringues sitting on the arm of the chair or the floor by <br/>
her play area or on the bedside table. We&#39;ve gone off meringues for the <br/>
present, but they may well return to favor.<br/>
<br/>
I provide, I watch.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.<br/>

Why do you think he would necessarily do it because you have?<br/>
<br/>
If you do the same conventional things to him as were probably done to  <br/>
you (limits/restrictions), do you think it&#39;ll turn out differently for  <br/>
him?<br/>

Yes you do.<br/>
<br/>
 I want to know what you do about a batch of cookies. If my<br/>
&gt; child wants to eat them all the day I made them, do I let him?<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re extending a limited snapshot into his whole reality. It really<br/>
doesn&#39;t work that way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My kids eat plenty of good stuff, but I don&#39;t know how to make sure<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t get too many sweets. Did your kids gradually back off once<br/>
&gt; you said &quot;eat as many as you like&quot; or do you only have a certain<br/>
&gt; number of cookies available for that day (for everyone, not just the<br/>
&gt; kids...)<br/>
<br/>
I stopped off at a Persian deli after an appointment today, and bought<br/>
a box of pastries (little honey and rosewater soaked balls, pistachio<br/>
nougat, and zoolbia), a can of dolmas, and a jar of some spectacular<br/>
pickled garlic that I&#39;d bought a jar of a few weeks ago, and the<br/>
family demolished (it&#39;s super yummy).<br/>
<br/>
My three year old just asked for one of the balls, took a bite, and<br/>
then spotted the garlic. He handed me back the rest of the ball, and<br/>
asked me to give him a dish of the garlic.<br/>
<br/>
My six year old finished the rest of the ball, and then shared a few<br/>
pieces of the garlic.<br/>
<br/>
Zero control. Zero manipulation. Kids do like sweets, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>
But they also like other stuff. Don&#39;t limit them, or assume they&#39;re<br/>
limited.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So help me - should I stop? Or will they learn what I never did (which<br/>
&gt; would be wonderful, because then I wouldn&#39;t have to worry...) But I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; afraid I&#39;m sabotaging them, and so the fault lies with me, not them.<br/>
&gt; If so, I can learn to stop...<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve got a lot of unhappy going on here. May I make a<br/>
recommendation? Go ahead and make the tons of cookies. Bake until you<br/>
can&#39;t stand it any more, then allow yourself to share, really share,<br/>
every last cookie with your kids. Just enjoy it. No one ever died of<br/>
cookie overdose. Just let go of the fear and the worry and all the<br/>
whiteknuckling, and just eat some cookies. Bet they&#39;re really, really<br/>
good. And I bet you guys have a really, really good time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278358358">-=-If you have a wide variety of foods available<br/>
over time the kids will eat a perfectly balanced diet for their daily<br/>
changing needs.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The eating and sleeping freedoms were practiced at our house from the  <br/>
time Kirby was a baby.  He was nursing on demand and sleeping with us  <br/>
and we didn&#39;t &quot;put him down&quot; for naps.  I read an article in  <br/>
Mothering Magazine about kids choosing their own foods if they&#39;re  <br/>
allowed to, and so we did that.  One of the LLL leaders had told me  <br/>
that a good time to give kids solid foods is when they&#39;re reaching  <br/>
for them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was impressed and surprised at his food choices.  So by the time  <br/>
Marty and Holly came along, I was an old hand at it.  With my first I  <br/>
WANTED to feed him baby food, and had a little manual baby-food- <br/>
grinder and powdered dried fruits and all kinds of stuff, but he  <br/>
liked nursing lots more.<br/>
<br/>
With Marty and Holly I really did wait until they reached for stuff,  <br/>
and I was more likely to give them finger-mashed &quot;people food&quot; than  <br/>
baby food.<br/>
<br/>
By the time Holly was born we were unschooling Kirby, so it must have  <br/>
seemed all of one cloth to her.  And probably to Kirby too, since our  <br/>
thoughts that he would go to school didn&#39;t translate into going to  <br/>
school, in his life.<br/>
<br/>
All of my kids think before they eat.  They will not eat something  <br/>
just because it smells good or looks good because someone worked hard  <br/>
in the kitchen or wants them to eat it.  They eat because they&#39;re  <br/>
hungry, and they choose foods that they need.  I&#39;m not very good at  <br/>
thinking about what I need, but they&#39;re GREAT at it.  If something  <br/>
smells good, they smell it and admire the scent.  If something looks  <br/>
good, they admire it and compliment the maker.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
One person wrote that and another person wrote this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-No need to say that. Just set and arrange the food you&#39;re offering  <br/>
out for<br/>
them. Kids need no instructions or teaching about how to handle food. If<br/>
you say &quot;eat as many as you like&quot; that might sound like they  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t think<br/>
of eating more or less or none at all. Just let food be available-=-<br/>
<br/>
We  never had either need at our house, because it started so early.   <br/>
My kids usually ask if they can have something, but the question  <br/>
involves whether it&#39;s saved for some other purpose, usually, or  <br/>
whether I&#39;m waiting for a certain time to set things out in some  <br/>
formalish way.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking back, though, it&#39;s not because I ever told them to ask.   <br/>
They just ask because they&#39;re nice.  If there are cookies in a cookie  <br/>
jar, they don&#39;t need to ask, but if there are freshly baked brownies,  <br/>
or a loaf of bread that hasn&#39;t been cut, they won&#39;t dig in.  They&#39;ll  <br/>
ask.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t just get their stuff without asking, either.  I was in the  <br/>
den today doing something and Marty asked if I minded if he played  <br/>
Rock Band.  Not only did I not mind, I thought it would be nice to  <br/>
have the music, so I totally encouraged him to play it.  The answer  <br/>
wasn&#39;t going to be &quot;NO, you can&#39;t play Rock Band.&quot;  It might have  <br/>
been &quot;I was planning to watch a movie,&quot; or &quot;I was waiting for [some  <br/>
tv show] to come on.  But if that had been my answer, I would&#39;ve gone  <br/>
to another room to do what I was going to do, because Rock Band isn&#39;t  <br/>
portable.<br/>
<br/>
So my kids ask, but it&#39;s not a &quot;may I please have one&quot; question.   <br/>
It&#39;s an &quot;Is there any problem if I...&quot; question, and there&#39;s a  <br/>
difference.   It&#39;s the kind of question adults ask other adults.   <br/>
It&#39;s the question people ask people.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you, Roby, it does, very much! I find it interesting that you<br/>
can spot the growth spurts! How neat to be in tune with that! I found<br/>
with my last two pregnancies that I craved sweets, and mostly carbs.<br/>
With my first, I craved protein (first time ever I craved DEER meat!)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting that with this last pregnancy, not knowing I was<br/>
carrying twins (not verified, anyway - no ultrasound, and midwives<br/>
didn&#39;t see enough difference that couldn&#39;t be explained by the whole<br/>
&quot;third baby&#39;s different&quot; thing) I still ate tons of carbs, and not<br/>
protein, which is what the doctors push for women pregnant with twins.<br/>
<br/>
I also crave more sweets while nursing. If sweets aren&#39;t as bad as we<br/>
think, then maybe it truly IS my bodies way of getting what it needs.<br/>
To eat fruit I&#39;d have to eat LOTS of it to get the same calories as I<br/>
do from a cookie. Which is hard to do while taking care of two little<br/>
ones!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you SO much for your story.<br/>
