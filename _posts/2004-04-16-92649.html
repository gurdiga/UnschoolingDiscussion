Someone sent a post about joining a postcard exchange group and there&#39;s the <br/>
link.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in one and so am very wary, mostly for living in a state without <br/>
much population.   Some families get so into it that they&#39;ll be angry with <br/>
people like me for not sending their postcard NOW.<br/>
<br/>
I had dozens from California and Texas, and that meant my obligation was to <br/>
SEND dozens back.  So the expense to people in less populated areas can be <br/>
pretty big.<br/>
<br/>
If you do join, please go easy on people from Wyoming, for instance.  Maybe <br/>
it should be a math project. &lt;g&gt;   I was on another list, not this one but <br/>
still:  There were states with dozens of families and for a while there were TWO <br/>
families in New Mexico, and one dropped, and then I dropped, but still got some <br/>
tacky &quot;we need a New Mexico post card, you lazy slacker bum&quot; cards for a <br/>
while thereafter.<br/>
<br/>
And some people were adamant that they wanted MAPS or capital buildings or <br/>
state birds.  HUH!  I had bought what I thought was pretty and representative <br/>
and that I could afford.  I couldn&#39;t afford to buy exactly what each family <br/>
would like to have from New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
There are other ways to get information about (and even from) other places <br/>
than by hounding volunteers. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There.  I&#39;ve said my piece.<br/>
And having said that, if you remind your kids that some places are sparsely <br/>
populated, I would really appreciate it.  <br/>
<br/>
We used to scan the list for families with anyone named our kids&#39; names, or <br/>
addresses that were interesting.   There has to be SOME criteria for answering, <br/>
and the idea that each family would send 49 cards and get 49 cards back was <br/>
SO lacking in logical forethought that I was appalled.<br/>
<br/>
But this list isn&#39;t that list.<br/>
<br/>
Enter at your own risk.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110679957">Here&#39;s what&#39;s at the site.  They only require a family to send ten postcards <br/>
to have fulfilled their obligation.  Good.  Different set-up:<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE NOTE: TO JOIN DO NOT SUBSCRIBE HERE DIRECTLY until you sent an <br/>
introduction letter to me. Please email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rancherma@...">rancherma@...</a> introducing your <br/>
family to me to keep us safe here. Otherwise you will be sent a rejection letter <br/>
with the same message. Thanks! <br/>

Geography Postcard Kids Project is for Home School children (Open to all <br/>
children too not just Home Schoolers) all around the WORLD. This project started <br/>
in October 2002 to help children enhance their Geographic studies and even some <br/>
history through sending postcards from their local area to other postcard <br/>
kids around the world learning about their home of residence around the globe. <br/>
Track the ones you get by tacking a pin on to a map or create a scrapbook album. <br/>
I have tons of links to maps, games, software, everything for helping your <br/>
child learn geography and have fun doing it! Kids, teens, school classroom, home <br/>
schoolers, even a grandparent can join to help out. <br/>
<br/>
Rules before joining <br/>
1. Must be willing to send at least 10 postcards to start out with to familys <br/>
of your choice. Don&#39;t join if you are not willing to do that many at least. <br/>
The amount sent is up to you after 10. Stay on as long as you wish to help out <br/>
and collect more. <br/>
2. Must have the post cards on hand before joining the group. Recommended you <br/>
have post cards with historical input. Example, historical site, state bird, <br/>
state flower, historical monument, even a funny post card is encouraged.<br/>
3. Failure to send out a post card within a month time frame will get you <br/>
banned from the group. Recommend to send it out within a week from the email you <br/>
get.<br/>
4.No spamming! No forwarding virus alerts or chain mails. Lets keep it post <br/>
card geography related topics <br/>
<br/>
Please be patient I do this in my spare time.</div>
