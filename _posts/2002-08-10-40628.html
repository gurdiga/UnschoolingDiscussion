This list is not the place to bring these topics up. Please Honor That. You <br/>
said you would. The majority requests that you would, the list moderator and <br/>
the list owner have gently requested that you would. Although some have said <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t speak for me... I like Ned&#39;s posts...&quot; This does not negate that this <br/>
list is still not the place for political grandstanding. There are other <br/>
lists more suited for this kind of debate. Please.<br/>

PS <br/>
Ned, many of us have said we enjoyed your posts on your family&#39;s unschooling <br/>
journey. Maybe we could get back to those?<br/>
