Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] The Dollmaker<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Wasn&#39;t The Dollmaker by Harriet Arnow made into a movie?  I want to say<br/>
&gt;someone like Jane Fonda was in the starring role?  Maybe a Hallmark<br/>
&gt;presentations?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was made into a movie but I did not see the movie.      I did not<br/>
&quot;boycott&quot;  the movie,   simply did not get around to seeing it.    I have<br/>
been told that the movie was  somewhat &quot;true&quot;  to the book but that , of<br/>
course,  it had to leave out huge subplots and lots of characters.<br/>
<br/>
Different media have different  means of presentation.   In my opinion,<br/>
part of the greatness of  the book is descriptions----both of surroundings<br/>
and of Gertie&#39;s thoughts.    Hard to know when a movie is able to portray<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
I like both the book and movie To Kill a Mockingbird   but ,  in my opinion,<br/>
the movie was not at all as successful as the book in portraying the<br/>
tapestry of differing ways of life and how they intersect.   Focused more on<br/>
plot and resolution  and was forced to simplify characters.   Still a good<br/>
movie.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I recall a movie by that name that I saw long ago.  I remember that the mother made folk dolls, and I remember that one child was killed while playing in the forbidden train yard near their home.  Is that the same one?<br/>
