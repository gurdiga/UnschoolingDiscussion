<div id="ygrps-yiv-586165026">There could be many different reasons.  Two that immediately come to <br/>
mind are:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Perhaps they need more attention/patience/love/hugs/time with and <br/>
from their parents.    2.  It could be a medical condition, such as <br/>
Juvenile Diabetes (High and/or low blood sugar which will definitely <br/>
affect behaviour).  Or, perhaps a child is on steroids because of asthma <br/>
or some other breathing problem.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think generally that kids - or anyone - act this way because they<br/>
aren&#39;t respected (they&#39;re bribed, manipulated, punished, etc., so they<br/>
naturally use these techniques on others), they don&#39;t get good, fun<br/>
attention (playing games, reading to them, talking with them), and<br/>
possibly some of it is kids who are unaware of how their behavior affects<br/>
others and don&#39;t know any other, better ways to respond.<br/>

doesn&#39;t conform to societal standards<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286592379">When my youngest daughter was a baby, she threw tantrums quite <br/>
frequently--we&#39;re talking the ones where you have to leave the store.... She <br/>
was also the kid that you &quot;had to watch&quot; in  a group of kids because she was <br/>
a biter. Should I also mention that she was breast fed for 2 1/2 years and <br/>
slept in the family bed? On the other side of the coin, her dad and I were <br/>
battling viciously most of the time..... After we (her dad and I separated), <br/>
her tantrums stopped and she mellowed into the most even-tempered person <br/>
you&#39;ll ever meet. I did notice, however, she was more likely to have tantrums <br/>
around lunch time or naptime, so I learned to scheduled my errands around  <br/>
her needs.          <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is our responsibility as parents to do.  Children, especially little <br/>
children, often don&#39;t even have the words to tell us what&#39;s <br/>
wrong.  Sometimes it only shows up in their behavior.<br/>
<br/>
On another list, a mother was telling how her daughter had misbehaved <br/>
horribly at a ballet performance, something she had attended before with no <br/>
problems.  Hours later it came out that the girl was still upset about the <br/>
way she had been treated earlier that day by neighbourhood kids.  She <br/>
hadn&#39;t known any other way of showing her distress than misbehaving.  They <br/>
discussed things she could have done to get help from her mother in dealing <br/>
with her upset, and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be able to go to the ballet again <br/>
without problems.  We just don&#39;t know, sometimes, what&#39;s bothering our own <br/>
kids, let alone someone else&#39;s.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I call those meltdowns. I find it helpful to distinguish between behavior<br/>
that is pretty much under a child&#39;s control and intended to get a certain<br/>
results (which I call tantrums) and behavior that may look awfully<br/>
similar but is really the result of the child being overwhelmed or<br/>
overtired or stressed or in some other way unable to cope. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter had a lot of those, especially at 5 and 6. Seven and eight<br/>
have been much better, although lately life has been stressful and she&#39;s<br/>
been  more &quot;melty&quot;.  Tia&#39;s description of Skye reminded me somewhat of<br/>
Cacie, especally Cacie melting down. When she was 5 and 6 and life was<br/>
pretty stressful, sometimes I spent an hour or more physically grappling<br/>
with her, while she tried to hit me, kick me, spit on me, etc. (she was<br/>
in kindergarten that year, which I think matters). It sucked, but I truly<br/>
think she was doing the best she could do at the time, with the skills<br/>
she had and the situation she was in. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think for some it&#39;s just a matter of learning what to do with emotion.<br/>
Some people *do* feel things much more strongly than others. Some people are<br/>
more affected by their environment than others. For some a feeling might be<br/>
like a wave from a passing motor boat. For others it&#39;s like a tsunami. It<br/>
isn&#39;t fair to compare a kid who quickly learns to handle motor boat waves<br/>
with a kid who can&#39;t handle tsunamis.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re really curious, lots of people with high needs kids find Raising<br/>
Your Spirited Child helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Some are higher in social intelligence so pick up social rules earlier than<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
For some it is lack of communication as others pointed out. If a kid wants<br/>
to tell his mom he&#39;s hungry or bored without being able to put words to what<br/>
he&#39;s feeling so he can&#39;t really communicate something he doesn&#39;t understand<br/>
so all he really knows is that he feels his world isn&#39;t right, and his mom<br/>
is insistent on finishing her business, he&#39;s going to melt down.<br/>
<br/>
For others it&#39;s a learned behavior. If a child is communicating that he<br/>
wants something and he&#39;s constantly told he can&#39;t have it, he&#39;s going to<br/>
blow. If you kept trying to tell your husband you needed something and he<br/>
kept saying effectively that&#39;s not important, that doesn&#39;t matter, how would<br/>
you react? And if you got a response to the blow up, wouldn&#39;t you go to the<br/>
blow up more quickly the next time he wasn&#39;t listening?<br/>
