this eve; it seems her 11yo ds literally devoures these books???  they are<br/>
leaving town for a few wks vacation early in the morning so I won&#39;t be able<br/>

away ...  so, I&#39;d like input if you know anything about this and also if you<br/>
know where can I purchase these books???<br/>

goodness, after reading some of the responses about filling out forms for<br/>
the school districts, *ACK*, I&#39;m glad we&#39;re in TX ... we don&#39;t answer to<br/>
anyone in TX, nor do we have a set # of school days, and h-s&#39;rs are<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165943446">Hail Brian Jacques! The author of the Redwall books. My son Nicholas, 9<br/>
years old, reads them for hours on end. You would be able to purchase them<br/>
anywhere. Or at least you should be able to. Some of the book titles are<br/>
Redwall, Marlfox, Pearls of Lutra, Legend of Luke, Mossflower, Mattimeo,<br/>
Mariel of Redwall, Salamandastrom, Martin the Warrior, The Bellmaker,<br/>
Outcast of Redwall, The long Patrol, The Great Redwall Feast (this is a<br/>
short BEAUTIFUL book, that even my 5 year old enjoys). There are probably<br/>
more, but he has read all but two of these books. They range anywhere from<br/>
about maybe 350 to 450 or so pages, except for the Redwall Feast, it&#39;s only<br/>
about 30 pages or so, with gorgeous illustrations. The books are just<br/>
fantastic. There are parts in them with some of the characters getting<br/>
killed or whatnot, but I feel Nicholas has dealt with the stories fine, and<br/>
they fuel his imagination tremendously.<br/>
<br/>
We have checked most of them out at the library, however they would be nice<br/>
to own and we are planning on getting his Brian Jacques library expanded<br/>
soon.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun! I&#39;m sure your son/daughter will love them!<br/>
<br/>
Also, just a quick note, we also ADORE Jane Yolen, good books, full of<br/>
imagination and magical ideas and lore. She&#39;s written many books, just do a<br/>
search....<br/>
<br/>
~Brynn<br/>

&quot;To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best night and day<br/>
to make you like everybody else means to fight the hardest battle any human<br/>
being can fight and never stop fighting.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Redwall, Marlfox, Pearls of Lutra, Legend of Luke, Mossflower, Mattimeo,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mariel of Redwall, Salamandastrom, Martin the Warrior, The Bellmaker,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Outcast of Redwall, The long Patrol, The Great Redwall Feast (this is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; short BEAUTIFUL book, that even my 5 year old enjoys). There are<br/>
probably<br/>
&gt; &gt; more, but he has read all but two of these books. They range anywhere<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; &gt; about maybe 350 to 450 or so pages, except for the Redwall Feast, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; &gt; about 30 pages or so, with gorgeous illustrations. The books are just<br/>
&gt; &gt; fantastic. There are parts in them with some of the characters getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; killed or whatnot, but I feel Nicholas has dealt with the stories fine,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; they fuel his imagination tremendously.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We have checked most of them out at the library, however they would be<br/>
&gt; nice<br/>
&gt; &gt; to own and we are planning on getting his Brian Jacques library expanded<br/>
&gt; &gt; soon.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Have fun! I&#39;m sure your son/daughter will love them!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, just a quick note, we also ADORE Jane Yolen, good books, full of<br/>
&gt; &gt; imagination and magical ideas and lore. She&#39;s written many books, just<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; search....<br/>

was wondering why you needed to use your teacher&#39;s card in June&quot; ... I told<br/>
her &quot;noooooo, I told him I was a h-s&#39;r and he proceeded to thumb through my<br/>
books *analyzing* whether/not these were acceptable/not, besides we *DO*<br/>
have year~round schools in our area, so summer months wouldn&#39;t be a valid<br/>

THEIR business to scrutnize what my family decides to read (freedom of info,<br/>

(just yet, anyway) and I&#39;d WALK OVER COALS if I thought something might<br/>

isn&#39;t THAT the idea behind the lib&#39;s *goofy* SUMMER READING PROGRAM and<br/>

said I&#39;d gone through the same thing a few wks ago b/c the lib questions a<br/>
vegetarian cookbook I was using for school, for goodness sakes!!!  the<br/>
reason I wasn&#39;t able to check the v-cb out on my teacher&#39;s card was b/c the<br/>

*ACK~AGAIN*!!!   finally, she said &quot;you&#39;ve made some valid points, she read<br/>
back all the complaints back to me, so I knew she was @ least listening then<br/>
she said their staff meeting is Monday morning and she would make a point of<br/>
putting this on their agenda b/c this WASN&#39;T THE FIRST TIME she&#39;s heard<br/>
complaints from HOMESCHOOLING FMS and yes, she agreed Mr. Lib DID OVERSTEP<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hail Brian Jacques! The author of the Redwall books. My son Nicholas,<br/>
9<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; years old, reads them for hours on end. You would be able to purchase<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anywhere. Or at least you should be able to. Some of the book titles<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Redwall, Marlfox, Pearls of Lutra, Legend of Luke, Mossflower,<br/>
&gt; Mattimeo,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mariel of Redwall, Salamandastrom, Martin the Warrior, The Bellmaker,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Outcast of Redwall, The long Patrol, The Great Redwall Feast (this is<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; short BEAUTIFUL book, that even my 5 year old enjoys). There are<br/>
&gt; probably<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; more, but he has read all but two of these books. They range anywhere<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about maybe 350 to 450 or so pages, except for the Redwall Feast, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about 30 pages or so, with gorgeous illustrations. The books are just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fantastic. There are parts in them with some of the characters getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; killed or whatnot, but I feel Nicholas has dealt with the stories<br/>
fine,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they fuel his imagination tremendously.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We have checked most of them out at the library, however they would be<br/>

&gt; expanded<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Have fun! I&#39;m sure your son/daughter will love them!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, just a quick note, we also ADORE Jane Yolen, good books, full of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; imagination and magical ideas and lore. She&#39;s written many books, just<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Hail Brian Jacques! The author of the Redwall books. My son Nicholas, 9<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; years old, reads them for hours on end. You would be able to purchase<br/>
&gt;them<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; anywhere. Or at least you should be able to. Some of the book titles<br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Redwall, Marlfox, Pearls of Lutra, Legend of Luke, Mossflower,<br/>
&gt;Mattimeo,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Mariel of Redwall, Salamandastrom, Martin the Warrior, The Bellmaker,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Outcast of Redwall, The long Patrol, The Great Redwall Feast (this is a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; short BEAUTIFUL book, that even my 5 year old enjoys). There are<br/>
&gt;probably<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; more, but he has read all but two of these books. They range anywhere<br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; about maybe 350 to 450 or so pages, except for the Redwall Feast, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; only<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; about 30 pages or so, with gorgeous illustrations. The books are just<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; fantastic. There are parts in them with some of the characters getting<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; killed or whatnot, but I feel Nicholas has dealt with the stories fine,<br/>
&gt;&gt; and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; they fuel his imagination tremendously.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; We have checked most of them out at the library, however they would be<br/>
&gt;&gt; nice<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; to own and we are planning on getting his Brian Jacques library<br/>
&gt;expanded<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; soon.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Have fun! I&#39;m sure your son/daughter will love them!<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Also, just a quick note, we also ADORE Jane Yolen, good books, full of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; imagination and magical ideas and lore. She&#39;s written many books, just<br/>
&gt;do<br/>
&gt;&gt; a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; search....<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166970104">Maybe with the exception of the Enquirer (sorry I&#39;m not up on the correct<br/>
spelling of this rag) and some romance novels, I thought pretty much all<br/>
reading material was educational whether one hs or not. Gee one would think<br/>
a librarian would know that. Oh well, I too am just glad to be out of the<br/>
box.<br/>

&gt; &gt;O.K., first things first, while you&#39;re both all reved up to scrub, we are<br/>
&gt; &gt;remodeling and have tons of things that need scrubbing &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Now, seriously, Pris, where do you live?  I think we will all come in<br/>
mass<br/>
&gt; &gt;to act as character witnesses to the charges of justifiable homicide when<br/>
&gt; &gt;you ring this creatures neck!!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m In ! I took my kids to the library a few weeks back and gave my<br/>
daughter<br/>
&gt; my teachers card to check out her mandi books on ( 5th grade chapter<br/>
books )<br/>
&gt; the librarian told her she would have to check them out on her personal<br/>
card<br/>
&gt; because the teacher card was only for teaching items???? I said uh hello<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; homeschool, as far as we are concerned everything they read is  a teaching<br/>
&gt; item! duh some people are just so how shall we say   IN THE BOX! I am so<br/>
&gt; glad to be out of it!!!!<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Redwall and Kipling aren&#39;t appropriate?  What is that person smoking?<br/>

can<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; just try to inflict his little power trip caused by his major<br/>
inferiority<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; complex ON YOU! I just despise it when things like that happen. I would<br/>
&gt; &gt;go<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; farther than the head librarian, never know who&#39;s &#39;pet&#39; this little<br/>
jerk<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; might be...I would take it to a superviser of several branches or<br/>
&gt; &gt;something.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I can&#39;t believe he did that, it&#39;s even heating  ME up! HELLO?!?! Gosh,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; can&#39;t even believe it. And you don&#39;t need to deal with that again<br/>
either.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, calm down and scrub and just deal with it by notifying a higher<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; &gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; make sure that it won&#39;t happen again. WHere do you live???<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
