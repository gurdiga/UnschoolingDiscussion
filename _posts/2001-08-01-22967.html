<div id="ygrps-yiv-552946245">I will be traveling to Mexico this fall and staying in San Felipe for <br/>
one month.  We will drive from San Diego.  I will have two minor <br/>
children with me, but dh will not be joining us until later.  My <br/>
question:<br/>
<br/>
What identification do I need?  I have phoned two travel agencies.  <br/>
One told me that we only need certified birth certificates.  The <br/>
other said that I need a notorized letter from dh saying that I have <br/>
permission to take the children out of the country.  My bil says that <br/>
we should all have passports, just to be on the safe side.<br/>

Any advice would be appreciated!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631825352">If your ID matches the mother&#39;s name on the birth certificates, that should <br/>
be all you need. A non-parent needs the notarized letter, but it wouldn&#39;t <br/>
hurt to have it. As far as passports, your kids don&#39;t need them, but again, <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t hurt, just add expense and trouble. <br/>

  I have traveled to Canada with my sons.  I was advised by my travel <br/>
agent to take along a notorized letter from ex.  Boy, was I glad I <br/>
did.  The border agents (both US and Canada) questioned me because I <br/>
was a single parent traveling with minors (they said they checked <br/>
both males and females).  Without the letter they said they would not <br/>
have been able to let us into Victoria.  Apparently this is to hinder <br/>
parental kidnapping.  My travel agent said she had not heard of <br/>
border agent problems, but that hotels in Mexico will sometimes not <br/>
allow registration unless you have some type of proof that you have <br/>
custody or absent parent approval to have kids out of the country. <br/>
She thought she was just being cautious because my sons use their <br/>
dad&#39;s name and tickets were issued in both names. She didn&#39;t realize <br/>
the border agents would be questioning us.  I&#39;d get a letter <br/>
(notarized) at a minimum -- even if you have passports.  Even if you <br/>
don&#39;t have to use it, you may be thankful you have it with you. And <br/>
what about if child needed doctors/hospital?  With this notarized <br/>
letter there&#39;s no question that you have parental &#39;power&#39; from their <br/>
dad.<br/>

the letter. I know going into Canada they worry about custody fights. Have<br/>

have no means to obtain this documentation....can i be denied travel rights?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760431639">If you are in CA, you can go to court and have yourself declared sole legal<br/>
guardian of your child.  The form is intimidating looking but is really self<br/>
explanatory.  You can get a fee waiver and do this all yourself for the<br/>
price of the packet of forms.<br/>

Same advice I was going to give.  Our county has a &quot;parental rights <br/>
advocate&quot;.  She holds a monthly seminar that walks people through <br/>
this paperwork.  I found the advocate for a friend by calling the <br/>
local battered women&#39;s shelter.  Everyone we spoke to was very <br/>
helpful and her court fees were also waived.  I&#39;m lucky my kids dad <br/>
is cooperative.<br/>
