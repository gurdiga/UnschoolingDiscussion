My 5yo kept telling everyone he had a stabbed toe.  He stabbed it on <br/>
the pavement next to the pool.<br/>
He meant stubbed, but stabbed sounded so much more dramatic, we went <br/>
with it. :-)<br/>

<br/>
My son called them the exact same thing, it was very cute!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the other day he had been playing outside (very hot that day) and came<br/>
in yelling &quot;It&#39;s hot as the 80&#39;s out there!&quot;<br/>
At first I thought he possibly meant temperature-wise, but no, he had heard<br/>
someone say &quot;Hot as Hades!&quot; and thought it didn&#39;t make sense so it must be<br/>
&quot;Hot as the 80&#39;s&quot; LOL</div>

etc.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 14 year old still says unchill instead of until.  It&#39;s much more subtle <br/>
than it used to be, but he still does it.  Some kids just hear sounds <br/>
differently than others, another reason why phonics doesn&#39;t help all kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-392722556">Hi Denise;<br/>
<br/>
 I have 2 daughters out of 3 who mispronounced some<br/>
words when they were younger. One of them called an<br/>
orange &quot;norange&quot; and both of them thought that Tim<br/>
Horton&#39;s was pronounced &quot;Tim Portons&quot;.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
realize this until my oldest(17) mentioned it a couple<br/>
of years ago because her younger sister was<br/>
pronouncing it that way. Reading wasn&#39;t easy for<br/>
either one of them-in fact my 11 year old avoids it<br/>
like the plague. (Just took her out of school last<br/>
January).  I wonder if there is a connection.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238909912">Hi, I&#39;ve been reading these postings on spelling and sounds, speaking.    When my daughter, who is now 17, and I&#39;ve only homeschooled, unschooled now for about 2 and a half years,  she couldn&#39;t spell in school, now that shes out, she picked it up herself and her spelling is perfect.  My husband has a hearing loss and school didn&#39;t do anything for him, he still can&#39;t spell, but he  does the best he can.  So don&#39;t worry about your kids, they&#39;ll turn out just perfect, just the way nature intended them to, and now we have spell checker on computers anyway.<br/>
