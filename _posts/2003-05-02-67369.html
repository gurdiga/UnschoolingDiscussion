&lt;&lt; She was 8 years old in 1946 when the R.E.A. brought electricity to her <br/>
home, <br/>
but there wasn&#39;t a plumbed bathroom in her parent&#39;s home until the year she <br/>
married and left it. She grew up taking baths in the kitchen, all the kids on <br/>
Saturday night - big tin wash tub, hot water added between bathers but still <br/>
last one got the dregs. In her family the order was first the oldest boy, <br/>
then the littler kids, and lastly her, the oldest girl. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We took baths in a galvanized tub (#2 was the bath-taking tub, #3 was the <br/>
kind they fed horses from) when I was little.  I remember seeing my dad, in <br/>
the tub, in the kitchen.  We had running water and a gas stove, but the water <br/>
just came out of faucets on the wall.  Even when we got a water heater, the <br/>
hot water still went into a bucket or the bathtub at first.<br/>
<br/>
My dad was building a house out of the salvage/scrap from an older (not <br/>
fancy) church, and working full time too.  So the first room to have walls <br/>
and all was the bathroom so we didn&#39;t have to use the outhouse.   It was <br/>
1955-57 that the house was being finished.<br/>
<br/>
Once my sister and I had baths at a neighbor&#39;s house, about 1/4 mile up a <br/>
dirt road (our nearest neighbors that direction), under the Chinaberry trees. <br/>
 Their kids went and then we went.<br/>
<br/>
I do love hot running water and showers!!!   Never had a shower growing up, <br/>
just bathtub.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393498612">I remember being at boarding school when I was 5 - not recommended BTW -<br/>
and having baths on Saturday in the great big laundry sinks. I guess<br/>
only a few of the girls were left in school over the weekend for this<br/>
treat. I have no recollection of other washing or not through the week.<br/>

Yikes!!! Poor Robyn!!<br/>
<br/>
I am familiar with the joys of reparenting by giving our kids what we wish we <br/>
had had.  I&#39;m glad you have that opportunity.<br/>
