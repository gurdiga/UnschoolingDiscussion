it may be hard but we make paper and it is easy.  Used it for our Christmas <br/>
cards this past year.<br/>

<br/>
we&#39;ve made paper a few times, and it wasn&#39;t hard at all with the method we <br/>
used. my mom gave me a kit that includes a pour mold as well as all the <br/>
screens and couch sheets, etc (Arnold Grummer&#39;s Papermill Kit #301 if <br/>
you&#39;re curious).  i&#39;d write out the steps we did, but i found a good <br/>
description of both pour & dip methods online:<br/>

my son andre was just about 4 when we made our first sheets, so he didn&#39;t <br/>
run the blender, but he was able to participate in all the other steps.  he <br/>
loves picking out colored paper from the recycling bin to rip into bits, as <br/>
well as choosing glitter and other bits to add in.<br/>
<br/>
i just looked at the &quot;helpful hints&quot; page to see if they had the <br/>
instructions for the tin can papermaking method, and found a faq for &quot;what <br/>
kind of kit is right for me?&quot; that included homeschoolers as one of the <br/>
&#39;user groups&#39;.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
what method have you used?  i&#39;d love to hear what you tried & what was <br/>
difficult about it.  oh, i must say, using the pour method is very very <br/>
wet.  i didn&#39;t plan quite far enough ahead to have things lined up next to <br/>
each other & avoid dripping, so we had the kitchen table and two counters <br/>
all covered with paper in various stages.  it&#39;s helpful to have some cookie <br/>
sheets with edges to put the wet screens on!<br/>

<br/>
I added orange dryer lint to one batch and blue to another.  That was nice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147234684">We make paper about once every month and a half.   We use scrap paper,<br/>
gently used paper towels and other ingredients, depending on the kind of<br/>
paper we want.  <br/>
<br/>
You can add sawdust, bark, herbs, flowers, food coloring, etc., for<br/>
special effects.<br/>
<br/>
We make paper for drawing, watercolors, gift wrap, greeting cards and<br/>
stationery.  <br/>
<br/>
We just use an old blender,  a deckle and mould, and dry the paper with<br/>
the iron.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy.   It&#39;s a little messy, but that&#39;s most of the fun.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What we used was old newspapers.  I cut them up into about 2 inch squares and <br/>
then put them in the blender. With about 3 times as much water as newspaper. <br/>
Nice gray color.  The ink did not get messy like I thought it might.  Then I <br/>
added some old tea leaves. And some seeds, that added a nice country looking <br/>
touch. Blended it all up.  I put all that with water into a big plastic tub, <br/>
one of the shallow ones, but large.  Used plastic canvas to get the pulp out <br/>
with and pressed a little with some felt, or sponge to get out the excess <br/>
water.  Turned it out on a towel to dry.  Using the plastic canvas left it <br/>
with a great texture but if you were going to write on it you might look for <br/>
something else.  That was how we did it.  Didn&#39;t get real technical as I <br/>
wanted it easy so my boys could do it too.  We learned that at last years <br/>
unschooling conference.  See another reason to come.  You never know what <br/>
little bit of info you will pick up. LOL<br/>
