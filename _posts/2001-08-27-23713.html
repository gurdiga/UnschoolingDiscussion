Good point !<br/>
I would suggest having homeschooling books/magazines around (there are many<br/>
available at the library)<br/>
maybe he would pick one up and learn something<br/>
also the book:<br/>
The whole parenting guide by Alan Reder, Phil Catalfo and Stephaninie<br/>
Renfrow Hamilton<br/>
<br/>
is a great book with inspiring stories that show the ways our children have<br/>
been learning<br/>
her husband can see that the children have already been taught to talk,<br/>
walk, eat ect..<br/>
and that teaching our children doesn&#39;t end when they turn the &quot;magic&quot; five<br/>
<br/>
My husband was the one that really preferred that I/we keep our children at<br/>
home and brought up that very opinion each day after I came home with our<br/>
oldest (in public kindergarten at the time w/ a great first year teacher)<br/>
&quot;HAVING ANOTHER PUBLIC SCHOOL DAY&quot;<br/>
witch was really a &quot;how can other parents not care about their children day&quot;<br/>

<br/>
for more information about<br/>
or find newbie classes around the community of homeschool group<br/>
if wants it to be &quot;proved&quot; to him he can at the very least be part of the<br/>
investigation period.<br/>
even attending one class where his fears can be addressed can make all the<br/>
difference and just as the 2 made the children together, raise the children<br/>
together they can choose education together with out any &quot;POOF&quot; needed<br/>
best of luck<br/>
