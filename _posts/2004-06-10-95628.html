<div id="ygrps-yiv-624660454">I&#39;m not sure if this is an unschooling related question or not, but as it <br/>

<br/>
Dave and I told Wyl last night about the impending baby sister or brother and <br/>
he is excited-he&#39;s wanted a baby sister for more than half of his life. I&#39;m <br/>
wondering how to present things to him to prepare him for how things will be <br/>
after the baby gets here. I&#39;m thinking I want to present things &quot;equally&quot; a <br/>
positive and a not-so-positive together so that it comes together balanced. Such <br/>

not-so-positive stuff, but we don&#39;t want him to dreading the baby coming, either-kind <br/>
of a balanced (if that is possible) view...  We&#39;re plannig on getting a <br/>
babydoll to practice holding/diapering/feeding with and plenty of books and pictures <br/>
(movies if we can find any) on the technical stuff, but are concerned with the <br/>
presentation of the day-to-day life of baby reality. He&#39;s five, by the way, <br/>
and will be just over 5 1/2 by the time the due date rolls around. Any <br/>
suggestions? Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The idea that kids resent the little brother or sister is mostly a fiction from TV and <br/>
children&#39;s picture books. After ten years of La Leche League work and my five kids (and the <br/>
huge number of families I know), the dire predictions of anger and resentment associated <br/>
with going from one to two or two to three are much exaggerated.<br/>
<br/>
The best preparation, imho, is enthusisam yourself. Let him in on doctor or midwife visits <br/>
when there&#39;s a heartbeat to hear, involve him in picking out baby blankets and soft toys, <br/>
talk about how he can be a help to you, discuss how your routine will change (perhaps <br/>
now story time reading will happen with a baby nursing in one arm...)<br/>
<br/>
Another thing: he won&#39;t be sharing his toys for a long long time with a baby. By the time <br/>
that happens, the baby won&#39;t be new, she will be a fact of his life.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest son had a metal fire truck that he loved. When our daughter was born (literally <br/>
days old), he was just over two. One evening, while I was making dinner, I heard a clunk. I <br/>
turned around and saw that he had just tossed his truck into the baby&#39;s Moses basket <br/>
while she slept (thankfully missing her head!). <br/>
<br/>
Some moms might have interpreted that as his resenting his little sister. But what I figured <br/>
out immediately is that he *wanted* to share his most valuable toy with his new baby <br/>
sister.<br/>
<br/>
He was smiling and peering over the edge.<br/>
<br/>
I spoke to him about saftey and toy choices and thanked him for his heart of generosity. I <br/>
was touched.<br/>
<br/>
To sum up - I think kids raised with joy and wonder about new siblings whose mothers are <br/>
at home, often have less difficulty with adding new babies than the culture predicts. In <br/>
fact, in many cases they love the new babies fiercely.<br/>
<br/>
And secondly, I think the &quot;frustration&quot; of adding a sibling often doesn&#39;t occur until the <br/>
baby is much older (like toddler age where the toddler can wreck the older sibling&#39;s stuff).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That was exactly our experience. Mackenzie was in awe of, and <br/>
overjoyed with his baby sister. Having the sling meant that she came <br/>
everywhere we did and so she didn&#39;t alter our day-to-day lives all <br/>
that much. Nursing times either he nursed too or we read books. All <br/>
in all, the early baby phase was a time of unusual closeness and very <br/>
sweet attention by him to the baby. He was just the sweetest with <br/>
her, it&#39;s many of my nicest memories.<br/>
<br/>
I really avoided all the kid&#39;s picture books out there that tend to <br/>
make it sounds like there&#39;s something to be dreaded about having a <br/>
baby in the house. It was just part of our life. My son came to the <br/>
midwife&#39;s appointments with me, and although he had been playing in <br/>
our living room with my sister when I was in labor in our bedroom, <br/>
about 2 minutes before Asa was born, he turned to my sister and <br/>
said &quot;Mom needs me there now, I better go.&quot; He came in to the bedroom <br/>
and watched the baby being born. And his voice was the first one she <br/>
turned to, he was so thrilled with that. I think it&#39;s because his <br/>
head was at stomach level, so she probably heard his voice in utero <br/>
more than anyone else&#39;s.<br/>

<br/>
Yep, nodding my head again here. Wreck Lego creations, pull out <br/>
chunks of hair, pages off of books, etc. From about 18 to 28 months <br/>
was our toughest time. Although there were great times there too. Asa <br/>
is really mischievous, and Mackenzie loved egging her on. Still does, <br/>
actually ;-) He would just be cracking up at her toddler antics (not <br/>
the hair-pulling though).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766596336">When Annie was born at home 15 months after Stella, Stella accepted her<br/>
instantly.  She was young, for one thing, but she was already talking  and<br/>
was surprizingly rational and we had told her that we would have another<br/>
baby in our family for us all to love.  I didn&#39;t feel it necessary to tell<br/>
her that there would be &quot;bad stuff&quot; as well, especially because she was<br/>
still so young.  She didn&#39;t start feeling the &quot;painful&quot; part of having a<br/>
sibling until Annie was much older and could wreck her elaborate buildings<br/>
and take her toys away while she was playing.  By this time, Stella couldn&#39;t<br/>
even remember a time without Annie, I don&#39;t think (especially since Annie<br/>
stayed such a baby for a long time--she couldn&#39;t crawl until she was a<br/>
little over 12 months.)<br/>
<br/>
When I was pregnant with Evan (who was born almost 2 1/2 years after Annie)<br/>
I still didn&#39;t warn the girls about the possible side-effects of having a<br/>
new baby in the house (though others sometimes did:  &quot;Mommy&#39;s going to be so<br/>
busy.  Are you going to be a big help to her?).  The reason is that I<br/>
believe having another baby join our family is a reason to celebrate, not to<br/>
worry excessively over.  I just didn&#39;t want to put negative ideas in the<br/>
girls&#39; heads that they wouldn&#39;t necessarily feel themselves.  Now that he<br/>
has been here for a year, they are well aware of how a baby can take up my<br/>
time, and how (especially now) they pull hair, etc...  We have dealt with<br/>
their feelings regarding the baby as they have come up, by listening and<br/>
helping them to find ways to get their needs met too, and they do not<br/>
question Evan&#39;s right to membership in this family.  He is simply part of<br/>
the family.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just want to say that I think it&#39;s best to not create problems<br/>
where there may not be.<br/>
<br/>
~Andrea<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Evan was born at home, too, and my daughter, Stella, who was 3 at the<br/>
time, was absolutely fascinated by the whole process, from pre-natal visits<br/>
to the midwives and listening to the heartbeat, to her job of discovering<br/>
and announcing whether the baby was a girl or boy.  My midwives refer to her<br/>
as &quot;little midwife&quot; or &quot;our second apprentice.&quot;  She was always full of<br/>
questions about the what the baby looked like inside me at each visit and<br/>
such.  She was thrilled when she saw he was a boy, saying &quot;Now I have a<br/>
brother, too!&quot;  And like someone else said about their birth, Stella&#39;s was<br/>
the first voice Evan turned to, and the one he turned to the most, as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492006961">ITA with everything that&#39;s been said already.  As a point of <br/>
interest, our favorite book was &quot;We Have a Baby.&quot;  Not positive per <br/>
say, though a very positive book, nor negative, just stating, &quot;We <br/>
have a baby.  A baby to love, a baby to hold, a baby to feed,&quot; etc. <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
I thought Orion (23 mo when baby came) was going to be very <br/>
resentful of baby, but I tried hard to keep that idea to myself.  No <br/>
resentment.  Just wonder, joy, and awe.  He amazes me daily with his <br/>
love.  Julie&#39;s story about the fire truck resonated; when Isaac was <br/>
a few days old, Orion asked to hold him.  I had wrapped gifts for <br/>
them when he was born from dh, baby, and me, quiet things I could do <br/>
with them on the couch.  Orion had gotten a marble maze; as soon as <br/>
I got baby settled in his arms, Orion thrust him at the <br/>
maze.  &quot;Baby, game?&quot; he said.  <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t spend a lot of time preparing for positive and negative, <br/>
but rather answer your son&#39;s questions as they naturally evolve <br/>
through your preg.  Approach baby as something that &quot;is.&quot;  Involve <br/>
him in the preg. in a gentle, natural way (I&#39;d say things <br/>
like, &quot;Wow, the baby just made a big kick.  He must have heard you <br/>
tell that funny joke) and use language like &quot;When the baby&#39;s ready <br/>
to come out ... &quot; and it will just be a natural extension of the <br/>
preg.  My daughter had thrown up the night Isaac was born, so when <br/>
he came at 4:45 am we decided not to wake the kids (4 and 2) but to <br/>
go back to bed instead.  When they came in our room, they didn&#39;t <br/>
seem surprised at all to find baby in my arms.  It just was, <br/>
sometimes pos., somestimes less positive, but really just something <br/>
that is.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909782349">I think the best thing you can do is to rid yourself of the <br/>
expectations and fears that you and your husband have.  Wyl is <br/>
excited and has been aching for a new baby!  In terms of <br/>
unschooling, let him explore his feelings and be there when he needs <br/>
help or reassurance.  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest two are five years apart.  It never occurred to me to <br/>
worry about sharing though I will admit to slight feelings of sorrow <br/>
and fear that I could never love another baby as much as I loved <br/>
her.  The moment Nicholette was born, that was gone.  <br/>
<br/>
During my pregnancy, we shared her excitement.  When I pulled out <br/>
Haleigh&#39;s baby clothes, it was fun to talk about how cute Haleigh <br/>
was in this outfit or share a funny experience about that outfit.  <br/>
We set aside some of the keepsake outfits and I asked Haleigh to <br/>
help me pick out a few special new outfits for Nicholette when we <br/>
went shopping.  It never occurred to Haleigh that giving her clothes <br/>
to her new sister was anything but fun!<br/>
<br/>
Probably the only sharing Wyl will be doing for at elast the next <br/>
year is with his old baby things or sharing a room.  Most of his <br/>
things won&#39;t even be safe for the new baby for years to come. As an <br/>
unschooler, you don&#39;t set your children up to fear learning, you <br/>
make their environment rich and full of opportunities and offer <br/>
assistance when needed.  As an unschooling mother, you share the joy <br/>
and excitement of having a new baby with Wyl and help him through <br/>
the rough spots when needed.  <br/>
I just pai If you remove your fears and expectations, you will free <br/>
yourself to feel and share the excitement that Wyl feels.  This is <br/>
also a great time to bring up modelling behavior.  If Wyl <br/>
experiences sharing in a comfortable, loving and kind environment <br/>
you shouldn&#39;t have much to worry about and will be able to tackle <br/>
any small issues as they come.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree with Jennifer. You might even find that kids in this kind of <br/>
environment have very different experiences with regards to sharing <br/>
than we grew up with. My kids share in ways that I don&#39;t think I ever <br/>
would&#39;ve with my siblings or friends. They aren&#39;t afraid to give <br/>
things away, to share from the heart, or to combine things with each <br/>
other. This year, they combined all of their Lego, which surprised <br/>
me, but they play together even more since they did that. Also, they <br/>
each share, trade, and give things away to their friends all the <br/>
time. We have an unschooling family that just moved in across the <br/>
street with two kids (yes, how lucky are we???!!!), and all four kids <br/>
decided this week to combine their Pokemon cards. I have to bite my <br/>
tongue sometimes to keep from interrupting these amazing acts. I keep <br/>
having to stuff down negative thoughts of how it might not work out, <br/>
they will want to have their own cards back, etc. They are operating <br/>
in an entirely different universe than I grew up in, why shouldn&#39;t <br/>
they act in different ways? In any case, the Pokemon cards are in a <br/>
giant folder that travels back and forth from the other family&#39;s <br/>
house to ours, and so far there hasn&#39;t been any problems. They have <br/>
also combined some of their money to purchase a new mega-pack of <br/>
cards. If they have future problems in sharing this stuff, maybe us <br/>
adults will have to help them work it out. Then again, maybe we <br/>
should just sit back and learn from them. I think they&#39;re operating <br/>
on a more community-minded approach, something like the Northwest <br/>
Indian&#39;s potlatch system. We grew up with the &quot;every man for himself&quot; <br/>
approach instead. We could all learn from their ability to share, I <br/>
think. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting, how much the common culture prepares us for <br/>
these &quot;truths&quot; about childhood - how kids are selfish and have to be <br/>
taught to share, how they have to be &quot;motivated&quot; to learn, how they <br/>
will be jealous of a new baby. My experience is that kids can act <br/>
like this at times, but are also capable of generosity of spirit, <br/>
unmitigated desire to learn, and a capacity to share that is beyond <br/>
that which most adults experience. More than anything, we can learn <br/>
these things from them, not the other way &#39;round.<br/>
