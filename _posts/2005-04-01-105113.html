On a slightly related subject: My husband has a wonderful story of taking a<br/>
symbolic logic class and finding a mistake in something on the board. The<br/>
professor denied it, then other students chimed in, agreeing that there was<br/>
an error. My husband didn&#39;t do very well in the class or with that professor<br/>
in the future (he had planned on being a philosophy major) and it turns out<br/>
that the mistake on the board had been a key part of the professor&#39;s<br/>
dissertation.<br/>
