group is offering a class, but she is not interested in a class once a week. <br/>
I don&#39;t blame her; I took two years of German in highschool and can only say <br/>
my numbers. Sad! Has anyone had experience with the PowerGlide programs? <br/>
Again they sound interesting, but they are not cheap. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-931470321">I have no idea about Power Glide, so I am curious as well, but I have <br/>
some thoughts. Spanish is my first language and I have a different <br/>
experience --because my husband does not speak it, my oldest did not <br/>
want to speak it or even hear it until recently.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1) I don&#39;t know how old your daughter is but my kids like JUMPSTART <br/>
SPANISH (they are 5 & 2.5, though) Evan actually did not like the <br/>
Standard Deviants (he will watch anything) and Muzzy is too expensive <br/>
so,<br/>
<br/>
2) Since you are into letting them watch TV, check out your local <br/>
Spanish Channels like TELEMUNDO and UNIVISION. They have MTV-Latino, <br/>
MundoNick (Nickelodeon in Spanish) and dubbed movies. And of course, <br/>
there are the news and telenovelas. Of course, there is Dora The <br/>
Explorer on Nickelodeon.<br/>
<br/>
3) A lot of DVDs come with a foreign language version of the movie. <br/>
That is a good resource as well.<br/>
<br/>
4) What kind of music does she like? If you give me an idea, I&#39;ll <br/>
steer you to some groups<br/>
<br/>
5) Yahoo! has portals for Spain and other Latin American countries. <br/>
That is a good way to read and find out what the Spanish speaking <br/>
cyber-world looks like. There are the sites for PBSKIDS & MUNDONICK <br/>
with lots of games<br/>
<br/>
6) Lots of the old LIVING BOOKS CD-ROMs are bilingual as well <br/>
(especially the ARTHUR ones).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, more than any &quot;learning tools&quot;, think about the challenge of <br/>
meeting Spanish speaking people. Is there a community of Latinos <br/>
around you? Are there places people meet like restaurants, markets, <br/>
churches, even library hours? Again, I do not know how young or old <br/>
your daughter. Young children will acquire languages that their <br/>
parents speak. I think that preteens and over have more of a sense of <br/>
self and would not rely on your knowing the language BUT they&#39;ll <br/>
either loose interest or their learning process will get &quot;stunted&quot; <br/>
because they have no way of putting those new skills to good practice.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031234876">My daughter went through a phase where she wanted to learn other <br/>
languages.  We bought Power Glide French and she didn&#39;t like it at <br/>
all. It got too monotonous for her.  She was 7 or 8 at the time.  <br/>
