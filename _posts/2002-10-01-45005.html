I&#39;m just wondering if anyone else wonders this?<br/>
How is giving the hearts any different from paying a child to do something?  <br/>
Sandra, I&#39;m not trying to be a bitch or anything but I was reading the <br/>
unschooling boards and read about the boy who wouldn&#39;t shower.  You <br/>
suggested to pay him a dollar.  I don&#39;t understand the difference between <br/>
the two?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, good question. I am wondering now too. I don&#39;t pay my kids to do <br/>
anything. They get money but don&#39;t have to do anything for it. Even the <br/>
oldest who is 16. I give her money from time to time. She use to get an <br/>
allowance but once she got a job that stopped. Then she quit her job and is <br/>
now looking for another one. No allowance for her but I do give her money <br/>
for stuff. She asks to borrow it but I never let her pay it back. She knows <br/>
she needs to get a job soon as she has a car coming in the near future. Her <br/>
watching the kids or doing anything I ask her to do for me aside from what <br/>
she normally does goes unrewarded. Well at least in money terms. We are all <br/>
rewarded big time in this house!!!<br/>
