<div id="ygrps-yiv-360515299">Hi, Sandi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not spending much time reading list mail these days, so it was pretty ironic that I saw your post! <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re Minnesota unschoolers, although actually not by strict definition. My older daughter is almost 21 (not in school from gr. 6-12) and my younger daughter opted to attend the local Waldorf high school this year for her senior year (after home/unschooling since the 2nd grade).<br/>
<br/>
The girls had to take one standardized test per year, the results of which didn&#39;t have to be turned in. Our school district pretty much left us alone. If you&#39;d like to e-mail me, I can give you the name of a person to contact re. the local (Mpls/St. Paul) unschooling group-- and put you on the mailing list for our homeschool theater group!  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is good.  I am pretty spoiled in Missouri.  All we have to do is log <br/>
1000 hours of &#39;class time&#39; throughout one full year (july 1-june30).  The <br/>
testing and reporting really have me worried.  I do not do well with <br/>
&#39;authority figures&#39; :)   As long as it is easy enough to get around, we <br/>
will probably go ahead and make our move.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks!  We are moving to Winona though, so I am not sure how often we <br/>
would make it up there for that.    I will keep it in mind though.  Maybe <br/>
after we get settled you can show us around your fair city, as we have <br/>
never been there before!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much for taking the time to answer my question.  I just I just <br/>
need to be reassured that the big bad scary school board/government is not <br/>
going to come force me to put my kids back into school just because they do <br/>
not like the way we chose to educate our kids ( I STILL do not understand <br/>
why it is ANY of their business anyway!!).<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>
