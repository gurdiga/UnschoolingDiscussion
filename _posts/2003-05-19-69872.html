 </span></blockquote>Yeah, you&#39;re probably right.  He balked today about writing &quot;Happy Birthday <br/>
Grandpa&quot; on the card he drew.  But then, I was pushing it so Grandpa could <br/>
see that he could do it and *I* wouldn&#39;t be under so much pressure.  I am <br/>
such a wimp sometimes.  And yes, I often feel that I&#39;m not patient enough for <br/>
this job!  Not patient enough with my children, not patient enough with the <br/>
process of unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Still, I&#39;m better than I used to be.  I&#39;m more proactive about praising <br/>
unschooling from the rooftops &lt;g&gt; and less likely to run away from <br/>
questioning/criticism with my tail between my legs.  Lately I&#39;ve been saying <br/>
to the family sceptics, &quot;It&#39;s just so amazing and powerful and lasting and <br/>
meaningful when kids can create their own ways of learning.&quot;  They think I&#39;m <br/>
off my rocker and shut up.<br/>
<br/>
And I thank this list for building my confidence.  If I&#39;d stayed on this list <br/>
(AOL boards)  back in &#39;96, I probably would have dealt with the family way <br/>
better way earlier.<br/>

Hi, Pam --<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good line and it&#39;s what I believe.  (<br/>
<br/>
Not the &quot;off your rocker&quot;, part &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
