Backlash over cell phone sting<br/>
Parents allege rights violation by Nazareth teacher and a principal.<br/>
 <br/>
   <br/>

<br/>
Legal and education experts say a Nazareth Area High School student has a<br/>
strong case that his right to privacy was violated last month when an<br/>
assistant principal confiscated his cell phone and used it to check and<br/>
send messages.<br/>
<br/>
And, they say, if the student and the district take their arguments to<br/>
the courtroom  legal motions may be filed in state and federal court<br/>
this week  it could be the first lawsuit of its kind in the nation.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;It&#39;s the kind of case that could go all the way to the U.S. Supreme<br/>
Court,&#39;&#39; said Robert DeKoven, a professor at California Western Law<br/>
School who studies student privacy issues and tracks such lawsuits.<br/>
<br/>
At issue is an incident March 17 when Nazareth technology teacher Shawn<br/>
Kimberly Kocher and Assistant Vice Principal Marge Grube confiscated<br/>
17-year-old Christopher Klump&#39;s cell phone.<br/>
<br/>
Grube, with Kocher&#39;s help, searched his text messages and voice mail.<br/>
Pretending to be Christopher, Grube also used his phone list to call<br/>
other students and sent a text message to Christopher&#39;s 10-year-old<br/>
brother.<br/>
<br/>
Christopher&#39;s parents, Toby and Leigh Klump, went before the school board<br/>
last month, asking for a public accounting of whether the staff members<br/>
would be disciplined. Board Chairman Donald Keller said the Personnel<br/>
Committee was discussing the matter but would say nothing more. School<br/>
law and union rules prohibit districts from disclosing staff discipline.<br/>
<br/>
Grube and Kocher declined to comment, but district officials do not deny<br/>
that the actions took place. They have offered to reimburse phone calls<br/>
&#39;&#39;to anyone who incurred costs because of the incident&#39;&#39; and send written<br/>
apologies to the parents of any student called.<br/>
<br/>
But they stopped short of saying Grube&#39;s and Kocher&#39;s actions were wrong.<br/>
District Superintendent Victor Lesky said Grube had reason to believe,<br/>
based on a text message on Christopher&#39;s phone, that the teenager might<br/>
have been using his phone to deal drugs, and so their search was<br/>
justified.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;Anytime our administrators are facing a situation that&#39;s maybe drug-<br/>
and alcohol-related, they&#39;re going to do what they can, within the law,<br/>
to make sure our kids are safe,&#39;&#39; Lesky said.<br/>
<br/>
The text message came from Christopher&#39;s girlfriend, a college student,<br/>
and was sent while she was driving in her car to pick up Christopher<br/>
after school let out. It read: &#39;&#39;I need a tampon!&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
School officials say it is common knowledge that tampon is slang for a<br/>
large marijuana cigarette.<br/>
<br/>
But Toby and Leigh Klump say that even if Grube and Kocher had the right<br/>
to search their son&#39;s cell phone, and they don&#39;t believe they did, there<br/>
was no message that indicated Christopher was dealing drugs. The Klumps<br/>
said the request was innocent, and Christopher did indeed find a tampon<br/>
for his girlfriend from another girl at school.<br/>
<br/>
They also say Christopher never has been caught at school or anywhere<br/>
else using or selling drugs.<br/>
<br/>
School policy forbids cell phones on school grounds during school hours.<br/>
But Nazareth and other districts in the Lehigh Valley area allow students<br/>
to have phones as long as they remain off and out of sight during the<br/>
school day. Lesky said this unwritten rule came about after the Columbine<br/>
High School shootings in Colorado and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist<br/>
attacks so students have a way to contact someone in case of an<br/>
emergency.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the written policy, the Klumps say, the district had a right<br/>
to take their son&#39;s phone but nothing more.<br/>
<br/>
Jamin Raskin, an American University law professor and author of &#39;&#39;We the<br/>
Students: Supreme Court Cases for and About Students,&#39;&#39; agrees.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;If there was independent evidence that there was reasonable suspicion<br/>
of drug dealing going on, perhaps the violation of the student&#39;s strong<br/>
privacy interests in his phone could be justified,&#39;&#39; Raskin said in an<br/>
e-mail. &#39;&#39;But this seems like a real stretch.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Steve Edwards, a former principal in Hartford, Conn., now vice president<br/>
of the National Crime Prevention Council, had a similar feeling on the<br/>
issue.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;I would think that would be crossing the line,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;If there&#39;s<br/>
reasonable cause, you can search a locker, but that&#39;s school property. On<br/>
occasion as a principal, I would ask a student to empty their pockets or<br/>
purse. But to take someone&#39;s cell phone and start looking at messages? I<br/>
don&#39;t know. Where does it stop?&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Cell phone sting or drug sting?<br/>
<br/>
March 17 was not the first time that Christopher Klump&#39;s cell phone ended<br/>
up in Marge Grube&#39;s office.<br/>
<br/>
Leigh and Toby Klump say their son had his cell phone taken away six or<br/>
seven times previously. The Klumps, who live in Bushkill Township, said<br/>
they told their son to keep it in his car, but he did not always listen.<br/>
<br/>
So when Christopher initially complained that Kocher had spied the phone<br/>
resting on his knee in class and taken it, the Klumps said they hoped it<br/>
would teach him a lesson. But their son had a new twist on the story this<br/>
time. He ran into a friend in the hallway outside Grube&#39;s office. The<br/>
friend grumbled that Grube had used Christopher&#39;s phone to call him. When<br/>
he answered, the friend said, Grube told him to come to her office and<br/>
turn in his phone.<br/>
<br/>
When the Klumps first spoke to Grube, they say, she acknowledged that she<br/>
conducted a cell phone sting of sorts, calling nine students whose<br/>
numbers Christopher stored in his phone. Later that night, though, when<br/>
Leigh Klump looked at the online records for her son&#39;s cell phone<br/>
account, she learned Grube had done much more.<br/>
<br/>
The records showed the calls Grube made. They also showed Grube tapped<br/>
into Christopher&#39;s voice mail and text messages  and had even sent a<br/>
message, pretending to be Christopher, to their younger son.<br/>
<br/>
The Klumps later confronted Grube and the following is their version of<br/>
what she said: Grube now said that it was not a cell phone sting but a<br/>
drug sting that she had conducted with Christopher&#39;s cell phone. She said<br/>
when Kocher took Christopher&#39;s phone away, he told her, &#39;&#39;I was not text<br/>
messaging.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Based on that statement, Grube said she felt justified to check his<br/>
messages to see if he had been. While doing so, she said, she discovered<br/>
the tampon message that she felt it indicated Christopher might be<br/>
dealing drugs.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;I can&#39;t remember when a girlfriend ever called me for a tampon,&#39;&#39;<br/>
Superintendent Lesky said.<br/>
<br/>
Thought she was helping<br/>
<br/>
School officials also said Grube and the Klumps had earlier conversations<br/>
about Christopher, and it was these discussions that motivated Grube.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;She actually thought she was taking actions to help them,&#39;&#39; wrote<br/>
district solicitor Preston Moritz in a letter to Timothy Prendergast, the<br/>
Klumps&#39; attorney.<br/>
<br/>
The Klumps said they told Grube earlier in the year that they were<br/>
concerned because Christopher&#39;s grades were dropping and he skipped<br/>
school a few times. They also mentioned that they were concerned about<br/>
some of the friends he was hanging out with and that they periodically<br/>
test Christopher for drug use. Christopher has never tested positive, and<br/>
the Klumps do not believe he uses drugs, but they said they want to be as<br/>
proactive as they can to keep him from doing so.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Leigh Klump said Grube probably also was aware that they once<br/>
asked a high school counselor to do a drug and alcohol evaluation of<br/>
Christopher.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;The counselor said, &#39;You&#39;re crazy. He&#39;s perfectly normal,&#39;&#39;&#39; Leigh<br/>
Klump recalled with a laugh.<br/>
<br/>
While the school district may argue that this background information<br/>
justified Grube&#39;s search of the cell phone, the Klumps don&#39;t see it that<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;If she had seen my kid in the hallway in some secret exchange that<br/>
would be one thing,&#39;&#39; Leigh Klump said. &#39;&#39;But the circumstances just<br/>
didn&#39;t warrant the search.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
She and her husband also said the logical step if Grube suspected<br/>
Christopher was selling drugs would have been to alert them and the<br/>
police.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, they said, there is another problem with Grube&#39;s claim that<br/>
the tampon message justified her search. The Klumps said Grube claimed<br/>
the message came in while she was in possession of the phone. The phone<br/>
records, however, told a different story: The message was sent the day<br/>
before the phone was taken.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;Their story has shifted so much,&#39;&#39; said Prendergast. First &#39;&#39;it was the<br/>
cell phone sting, then it was the whole thing about the tampon. They<br/>
scrambled to find a reason for why they did what they did.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Courts strict on privacy issues<br/>
<br/>
Prendergast plans to file motions in state and federal court this week,<br/>
claiming that his client&#39;s right to privacy under the state and federal<br/>
constitutions was violated.<br/>
<br/>
Pennsylvania is the only state with a constitution that protects privacy<br/>
rights. DeKoven, the law school professor in California, said that should<br/>
be a key factor.<br/>
<br/>
The federal Constitution protects privacy rights, but the U.S. Supreme<br/>
Court ruled in 1985 that school administrators can search students if<br/>
they have reasonable evidence to suggest the student might have violated<br/>
school policy or broken the law. The court said administrators have to be<br/>
able to protect students from other students.<br/>
<br/>
Pennsylvania courts, however, have given administrators less leeway.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;Normally, school districts just have to say, &#39;We&#39;re concerned about<br/>
drugs and alcohol,&#39;&#39;&#39; DeKoven said. &#39;&#39;In Pennsylvania, the courts have<br/>
said, &#39;You&#39;ve got to actually show the reason why you&#39;re doing this.&#39;<br/>
It&#39;s a much higher standard.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Prendergast said state case law indicates that the courts will consider<br/>
several factors when it comes to determining whether a student&#39;s privacy<br/>
has been violated, including whether the district provided notice that it<br/>
might conduct searches of cell phone voice and text messages.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;Our position is simple,&#39;&#39; Prendergast wrote in a letter to Moritz, the<br/>
district solicitor. &#39;&#39;There is no notice provided because these actions<br/>
were not anticipated by the authors of the student conduct code and have<br/>
far exceeded any authority of the administration to carry out their<br/>
mandate to protect the health and welfare of the student population.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
District officials said they plan to revise their cell phone policy in<br/>
light of this incident.<br/>
<br/>
A tough job<br/>
<br/>
Cell phones, laptops and other technology present a real challenge to<br/>
schools, experts said.<br/>
<br/>
Administrators have caught students using text messages to cheat on tests<br/>
and camera phones to send revealing photos of unsuspecting peers.<br/>
Students who bring their personal laptops to schools have also been<br/>
caught surfing pornography sites.<br/>
<br/>
Having to police this technology, which is getting smaller and thus<br/>
easier to conceal, can be frustrating to administrators, said Michael<br/>
Carr, spokesman for the National Association of Secondary School<br/>
Principals.<br/>
<br/>
Edwards, the former principal, agreed.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;It&#39;s one of the toughest jobs in America,&#39;&#39; he said of being a<br/>
principal. &#39;&#39;Think of the things these people have constantly placed upon<br/>
them: Keeping schools violence- and drug-free, keeping test scores up.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Little wonder then, he said, that he has some administrators snap, such<br/>
as performing a strip search.<br/>
<br/>
Several years ago, a high school principal in San Diego was demoted after<br/>
she made female students show their underwear before heading into a<br/>
school dance. The administrator said she was looking to see if the girls<br/>
were wearing thong underwear, which was against school policy.<br/>
<br/>
Locally, there have been several incidents where school officials<br/>
appeared to infringe upon student privacy rights. In 2001, a former<br/>
Emmaus High School swimming coach settled a lawsuit after a student<br/>
claimed he violated her privacy when he tried to force her to take a<br/>
pregnancy test.<br/>
<br/>
Two years earlier, Catasauqua cheerleaders complained that their privacy<br/>
rights were trampled when two administrators searched their luggage<br/>
before they left on a road trip to a competition. In that case, one of<br/>
the administrators said he did not have a &#39;&#39;specific&#39;&#39; suspicion about<br/>
the cheerleaders.<br/>
<br/>
Apology sought<br/>
<br/>
The Klumps&#39; attorney, Prendergast, said the couple decided to file the<br/>
lawsuits because district officials haven&#39;t apologized for Grube&#39;s and<br/>
Kocher&#39;s actions and have not, to their knowledge, disciplined them.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;We hold students to a certain standard,&#39;&#39; Prendergast said. &#39;&#39;It is<br/>
hypocritical for us not to hold educators to the same standard.If<br/>
Christopher or any other student had broken the law and school policy,<br/>
they would have been disciplined.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
School officials said school code and union policy forbids public<br/>
discussion of staff discipline.<br/>
<br/>
Still, in a letter to Prendergast, Moritz wrote that the request for<br/>
punishment would &#39;&#39;be taken under advisement and at the very least,<br/>
required attendance at a student rights workshop will be forthcoming.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
The district also promised that the Klumps&#39; younger son will not be<br/>
assigned to Grube when he goes to the high school.<br/>
<br/>
It seems unlikely that the Klumps will be satisfied with those actions.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;Their argument from the start was, &#39;We have the right to do this,&#39;&#39;&#39;<br/>
Leigh Klump said. &#39;&#39;Well, they don&#39;t. I want a new policy that says, &#39;You<br/>
guys have to step back here and give these kids room to breathe.&#39;&#39;&#39;<br/>
