<div id="ygrps-yiv-684674681">I hope you all don&#39;t mind something a little OT. I just had to post this, in <br/>

Chocolate is a vegetable. <br/>
 <br/>
Chocolate is derived from cocoa beans. <br/>
Bean = vegetable. <br/>
Sugar is derived from either sugar cane or sugar BEETS. <br/>
 <br/>
Both of them are plants, in the vegetable category. <br/>
Thus, chocolate is a vegetable. <br/>
 <br/>
To go one step further, chocolate candy bars also contain milk, <br/>
which is dairy.  So candy bars are a health food. <br/>
 <br/>
Chocolate-covered raisins, cherries, orange slices and strawberries <br/>
all count as fruit, so eat as many as you want. <br/>
 <br/>

Check your museums there&#39;s a chocolate exhibit making it&#39;s way around, it&#39;ll be here in October. The kids and I are so looking forward it, for now we&#39;re going to enjoy the Robot exhibit that is also making the rounds. <br/>
