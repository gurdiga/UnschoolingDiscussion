<br/>
I agree. Don&#39;t talk to my brother or sister. I&#39;ve tried a few times. My<br/>
brother I actually like, he&#39;s just way to cynical and negative for me to<br/>
handle being around. My sister I can&#39;t stand.<br/>
<br/>
But I still try and tell my kids that they need to get along. How important<br/>
brothers and sisters are. I am hoping they stay close. I made my ex step<br/>
daughter promise me, as she&#39;s the oldest and still a part of this family, to<br/>
keep the kids all in line and liking each other!!! Maybe since I don&#39;t have<br/>
it that&#39;s why it seems so important to me. I really want them to like each<br/>
other when they get older.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know when I typed that I was thinking about my OWN children and it is a <br/>
truthful statement of what I have witnessed as their parent.<br/>
<br/>
BUT I do not speak with ANY of my siblings, I was the family &quot;pleaser&quot; for <br/>
many many years and took lots of abuse, hoping to &quot;make&quot; them feel like <br/>
family and for me to be loved as much as I loved them.<br/>
<br/>
Four years ago a catastrophic event in my immediate family opened my eyes to <br/>
just what &quot;takers&quot; and liars my siblings were.<br/>
<br/>
I cut them out of my life, there was much grieving involved on my part but I <br/>
know I am better off now without them in my life.<br/>
<br/>
Seems kinda odd that I have such strong feelings that my children love each <br/>
other and respect each other and REALLY enjoy being together while I have no <br/>
desire to do the same with my own siblings.<br/>
<br/>
But my children were raised in a VERY different kind of family than I was of <br/>
course.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for making me think!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Same here.  My younger brother and I HATED each other growing up.  I <br/>
mean downright hated...no exagerration.  Or maybe I just hated him.<br/>
<br/>
We are friends now.  We don&#39;t go out of our way to do things <br/>
together, and I wouldn&#39;t say we are &quot;close&quot;.  But we get along ok and <br/>
I don&#39;t feel that horrible animosity toward him now that I did then.<br/>
<br/>
My kids fight like cats and dogs and it really worries me because I <br/>
*can* relate so well to that feeling of hatred.  My hatred toward my <br/>
brother was exacerbated by some of the things my parents did and the <br/>
fact that my parents marriage disintegrated, which left very little <br/>
in the way of emotional support for me.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing my kids fight the way they do makes me feel like I&#39;ve failed <br/>
them somehow.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Me too, Kelly<br/>
<br/>
When Katherine was a baby I went to a workshop on sibling relations. We <br/>
were to introduce ourselves, our current families, and our families of <br/>
origin. My intro included, &quot;and I have a brother five years younger. I <br/>
didn&#39;t like him when we were kids and I don&#39;t intend to start now.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, while I still don&#39;t like him and refer to him as St. Dave (who <br/>
can do no wrong), I have learned to call his wife something besides <br/>
&quot;What&#39;s her name,&quot; so there&#39;s progress, I suppose. I wouldn&#39;t want to <br/>
live in the same town, though, especially if my mother did also.<br/>
