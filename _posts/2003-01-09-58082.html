<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647899516">&lt;&lt;books are the last thing on his list of &quot;fun&quot; stuff.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But can&#39;t that be ok?  My almost 10yo son has no interest in books, but his<br/>
mechanical understanding and hand eye coordination are phenomenal.  He just<br/>
built me a dolly and put together a peddle car for his younger siblings.  If<br/>
you need to hook up a horse trailer to your van, Zach is the man to get your<br/>
lined out.  He is pretty darn good at shooting skeet, playing baseball,<br/>
basketball and PS2.  All things that are more helpful to the family right<br/>
now than loving to read would be.  And more fun to Zach.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OH YEAH.  I never intended to give the impression that it was NOT ok .. Ethan <br/>
is big on the mechanics too.   The fact that he is not &quot;into&quot; books doesn&#39;t <br/>
bother me.  I was just saying that thery are &quot;exceptions&quot; to books being <br/>
inherently lovable ( to everyone)  Some folks suggested comics and such. and <br/>
he does have more interest in those.  He likes to look at cut aways and <br/>
diagrams etc.. But, he&#39;s not into to being read to, or reading himself .  <br/>
Thats just Ethan, and I know he doesnt feel like hes missing out.    Now , if <br/>
I took TV away.. lol. THAT would be a different story :-)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t do THAT either--acting/standing in front of a crowd---so I have no<br/>
&gt; personal take on it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But after watching The Actors&#39; Studio, I hear many different ideas on that. I<br/>
&gt; guess it depends on the actor. When asked what kind of director he likes, the<br/>
&gt; actor will generally fall into one of two categories. Either he wants a<br/>
&gt; director with an exact vision of what he wants---who can verbalize exactly<br/>
&gt; what he sees in his head. Or he likes a director who is &quot;hands off&quot; and<br/>
&gt; allows him the freedom to &quot;become&quot; that character the ACTOR sees in HIS head.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Both the actor and the director can and should have a vision of the<br/>
character in their heads. The director&#39;s job is half over when they have<br/>
cast the right actor. But usually an actor cannot do it alone, because they<br/>
only have their part in their vision and the director has the whole<br/>
production in their&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, if a director says to me &quot;Go for it, it&#39;s all yours&quot; that is too<br/>
much freedom. Just like they shouldn&#39;t say &quot;Here&#39;s is exactly how to say<br/>
this&quot; and then demonstrates it. It should be an organic, symbiotic<br/>
relationship.</div>
