<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261400713">Ahhh, thanks for the clarification. I&#39;d never seen the term used that way<br/>
before. I have to say that a fair number of economically middle class<br/>
families fit into that description. Not to mention those who do get married<br/>
but who do it frequently, with children resulting from each union. Middle<br/>
class is a rather slippery term these days!<br/>

I don&#39;t think this statement was meant to be offensive. Even the Brady Bunch<br/>
is refered to as a blended or mixed family. I conscider myself to be from<br/>
one. My parents divorced and married a man with three kids. We mixed<br/>
together. No bad intentions behind the term.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933288206">I think the problem with the &quot;mixed family&quot; label is that it FEELS like a<br/>
negative label. And no one wants to feel like they have somehow moved<br/>
themselves beyond the pale of civilized society by choosing a particular<br/>
spouse or living arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
I am black, my husband is white, and we are celebrating our 20th ann. today!<br/>
And most of the picture perfect couples who were so sure we were doomed have<br/>
since divorced.<br/>
<br/>
Labels sting and that was one that was originally applied in a post, not in<br/>
the CPS regs that were later sent. If I remember correctly, the post implied<br/>
that statistics that applied to &quot;mixed&quot; families didn&#39;t need to be posted<br/>
HERE. (And no, Dawn, I&#39;m really not trying to open that can of worms again.<br/>
(!) Just giving some history.)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, feelings are feelings and should be respected. The wrong side of the<br/>
&quot;cage&quot; comment was uncalled for in response to a sincerely felt post.<br/>
