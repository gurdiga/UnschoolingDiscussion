<div id="ygrps-yiv-905789005">Hi,<br/>
    I have just joined this list as of today and have yet to introduce<br/>
myself but I had to let those looking for the quilting kit know that<br/>
there is one offered by Magic Cabin Dolls.  Their # is 1-888-623-6557,<br/>
call for a catalog.<br/>
    Their catalog is simply beautiful and they offer much more than just<br/>
dolls.  I have ordered from them a number of times and have always been<br/>
happy with the service they offer.<br/>
    Hope this helps!<br/>
    My name is Angela and my husband Kevin has also just joined the<br/>
list.  We are the homeschooling parents of two boys ages 4 (as of<br/>
today!) and 5.<br/>
     BTW, we are also pagan.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;I saw a first quilting kit for children that included enough materials<br/>
<br/>
 &gt;to make a couple of  items, one being the perfect size for a doll<br/>
 </span></blockquote>quilt.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;I was actually going to get it for myself!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote> OK, where did you see it?  I would like to get it too!  I want to learn<br/>
to<br/>
 quilt and that sounds like an unintimidating way to start.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was through Hearthsong, but I just checked the catalog<br/>
(they<br/>
do have some other nice kits, knitting, looms, basket making etc).  So<br/>
now<br/>
I am thinking it might have been in this catalog I can&#39;t find, something<br/>
about<br/>
log cabin dolls?  I will look around some more later and post if I find<br/>
it.<br/>
