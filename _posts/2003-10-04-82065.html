Norway, and I was finding out that the book had a list of &quot;The Seven Oceans,&quot; <br/>
and the way they got seven was north Atlantic, south Atlantic, north Pacific, <br/>
south Pacific (plus Antarctic, Arctic and Indian).&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Fourth grade. Mrs. Williams. Every Friday we had a test. The first two <br/>
questions were: Name the seven continents. Name the five oceans. We ALL had to get <br/>
them ALL right---AND correctly spelled. Or we had the same two first questions <br/>
AGAIN the NEXT Friday. The tests started the second Friday in September. We <br/>
had those first two questions until the second Friday in JANUARY!  I guess <br/>
sometimes the school process works----or was it our personal desires to NEVER have <br/>
these two questions again that drove 16 children to FINALLY learn what they <br/>
were and how to spell them?<br/>
<br/>
Continents:<br/>
North  America<br/>
South America <br/>
Africa<br/>
Australia<br/>
Europe <br/>
Asia<br/>
Antarctica<br/>
<br/>
Oceans:<br/>
Pacific<br/>
Atlantic<br/>
Indian<br/>
Mediterranean<br/>
Arctic<br/>
<br/>
And come to find out when Cameron was in fifth grade that the Mediterranean <br/>
is no longer considered an ocean! The South Ocean is now one of the five. Go <br/>
figure. I had to learn to spell Mediterranean for no good reason! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seven seas? I&#39;m guessing that there are five oceans and the seven seas (that <br/>
sea-faring Europeans were surrounded by and would have sailed): Mediterranean, <br/>
Baltic, Black, Red, Caspian, Adriatic, and Arabian (Persian Gulf). But that&#39;s <br/>
a guess!<br/>
