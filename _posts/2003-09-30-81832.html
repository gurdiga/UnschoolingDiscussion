<div id="ygrps-yiv-14925548">My son and I have been having some really good conversations lately about<br/>
buddhism, God, meditation and different religions (usually at night when he<br/>
can&#39;t sleep!).  Does anyone have any favorite books for children dealing<br/>
these topics?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-611533389">I forget how old your son is, Marjorie, but we liked &quot;What Is God?&quot; as an<br/>
introduction to religion and spirituality.  I like, (though my 8 yo dd  is<br/>
less enthusiastic at the moment) The Usborne Book of World Religions.  It<br/>
covers, in reasonable detail, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism,<br/>
Islam, and Sikhism, and provides brief overviews of others.  It gives time<br/>
lines of when the world religions began, maps of where the religions are<br/>
primarily practiced, religious sayings, definitions and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Funny, I didn&#39;t much think about discussing religion until the next-door<br/>
neighbour boys (from different families) told dd she was going to hell at<br/>
the tender age of 5 because she didn&#39;t believe in Jesus.  She&#39;s been pretty<br/>
sure since then that Mother Nature is the &quot;deity&quot; for her &lt;g&gt;.  I&#39;ve<br/>
considered myself Christian because I was brought up in the Anglican Church<br/>
(in Canada), but like Julie S., I am realizing perhaps I&#39;m not Christian at<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, check out the first book here:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157690511">Thanks for the recommendations, Robin.  My kids are 6,8 and 11.  My middle<br/>
child is the one specifically interested in religion, although my youngest<br/>
is the one who last week decided she wanted to go to Sunday School!  We<br/>
tried the local Unitarian Universalist Church and we both liked it very<br/>
much.  She had gone to preschool there (by the way, it was the closest thing<br/>
to an unschoolers dream preschool that I&#39;ve ever seen!) and we really liked<br/>
the feeling of community and their vast array of community service<br/>
opportunities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-433116541">I really like that Usborne book that was mentioned.  <br/>
<br/>
The sections of the book have page borders reflecting some art style or icon <br/>
of the religion discussed on that page, which was interesting to my kids and <br/>
me all by itself.<br/>
<br/>
Their explanations are short, clear, and tie in historical times and <br/>
movements without getting at all draggy or boring.<br/>
<br/>
Because of that section/border thing, you can tell which religions are <br/>
related without charts or graphs.<br/>
