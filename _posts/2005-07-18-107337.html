<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089857234"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Kirby had a lot of dental problems, and had four steel-capped teeth when he<br/>
&gt;was little, because some of his enamel was just no good.   Neither Keith <br/>
&gt;nor I<br/>
&gt;had that problem when we were little, so I have no idea what it might&#39;ve come<br/>
&gt;from.   Marty&#39;s and Holly&#39;s were both much better.   With his permanent <br/>
&gt;teeth,<br/>
&gt;Kirby&#39;s seem fine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nicky had this and one dentist told me it happens in utero when the enamel <br/>
is developing, during the sixth month of pregnancy.  I figure for Nicky it <br/>
was that mysterious case of hives I got about that time in my <br/>
pregnancy.  His regular dentist (older, maybe less up to date?) didn&#39;t know <br/>
that but I got to toss it to him when he started in about diet.  I&#39;m sure <br/>
he would have started in on breastfeeding, if he knew Nicky had &quot;still&quot; <br/>
been breastfeeding.  (I&#39;ve been glad I never had to deal with getting that <br/>
challenge about breastfeeding.  I have heard them do it to another mom and <br/>
I defended her.)<br/>
<br/>
So far Nicky&#39;s permanent teeth seem fine.<br/>

(OK, I&#39;m used to unschooling and breastfeeding not being in spell check, <br/>
but &quot;utero?&quot;)</div>
