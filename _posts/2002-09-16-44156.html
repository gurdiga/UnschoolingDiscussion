&lt;&lt; The exception was the comment about restriction - restriction was my<br/>
 interpretation based on your characterization of certain books as a<br/>
 &quot;waste of a tree &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And you don&#39;t think the Bob books aren&#39;t a waste of a tree?<br/>
I think a child would get more from a tree than those books....but then I got <br/>
rid  of ALL of our &quot;early&quot; readers, at my children&#39; request.<br/>
My oldest &quot;learned to read&quot; with them and hated every moment. I see my next <br/>
two learning to read from much more interesting material and don&#39;t have any <br/>
pride involved in proving they can read by buying such drivel.<br/>
Yes, drivel. That&#39;s my opinion that I keep to myself pretty much. Cause if <br/>
one of my children wanted to buy some, you bet I would!<br/>
But they had bad memories for my oldest ds, and I didn&#39;t think those needed <br/>
to be floating around our home.<br/>
Children will usually choose much more interesting material given lots of <br/>
choice.<br/>

I wanted to respond to this statement of Ren&#39;s and give an example of how utterly true this is. I consider my soon to be 4 yr old son a pre-reader. He, however, is constantly asking what signs says, etc, etc. When we go to the library we go to the sections which contain his INTERESTS not his reading skills. When he was interested in mummies we got out books (usually at middle school level) on mummies, ditto on bones, volcanoes, minerals, cars, trains, dinosaurs, etc, etc. I have learned more about these subjects than I ever have cared to know...but you know what so has he---it has quenched his need to know about those subjects for awhile. Why keeps books around that don&#39;t have interesting stories or topics?? Don&#39;t you want the children to WANT to learn to read because the stuff out there is cool??<br/>
<br/>
just my 2 cents<br/>

&lt;&lt; I just asked my son what he liked about having bob books and other easy <br/>
readers around when he was starting to read.  He said he liked the small, <br/>
easy words.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And so far, ALL of my children have said &quot;those are stupid&quot; when I read them.<br/>
So it was an easy choice for me to send them on.<br/>
Like I said, If my child wanted them, no problem. I don&#39;t see how they&#39;re <br/>
going to benefit a child that thinks they&#39;re boring.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL! Ren, I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;ve never read a Bob book to Casey, even to just <br/>
show her what they were. I brought them home and left them around. She <br/>
picked them up, colored them in, and had fun reading a whole book by <br/>
herself. It was really not such a big deal. At the same time she was fooling <br/>
around with Bob books and Easy Reader Level 1&#39;s, I was reading Watership <br/>
Down to her. Go figure. She is a woman of many different interests, levels <br/>
of interest and enjoyment, and tastes. ::shrugs:: No one is telling you to <br/>
go get the Bob books back if your family doesn&#39;tlike them. :o)<br/>

Well, I sure didn&#39;t mean to sound like I was saying people shouldn&#39;t buy them <br/>
or I thought I was being told to buy them!!<br/>
I was only trying to make clear why some people don&#39;t have them on the shelf, <br/>
nor see them in the best light. That&#39;s all :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And I can totally understand what you&#39;re saying. My kids have just taught me <br/>
to steer clear of pronouncements over what is drivel. It&#39;s funny, most other <br/>
places I find Conor&#39;s choices of entertainment questioned because it&#39;s <br/>
soooooooo non-schooly. But here, I&#39;m always explaining how, yes, Casey <br/>
really did freely choose that schooly path at one time or another. :-D<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all a learning process for me.<br/>
