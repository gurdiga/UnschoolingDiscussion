<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824077531">We started with drinking glasses and cups.  This took a little training<br/>
because the kids (including the big one &lt;g&gt;) were so use to just tossing<br/>
their cups/glasses in the sink to be washed.  From there I went on to food<br/>
storage bowls.  I got rid of all the Tupperware and Rubbermaid and all the<br/>
microwave junk.  It has taken about two years because it is expensive to do<br/>
the switch.  But, thank the powers that be that some stores still have<br/>
layaways!!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m now doing mixing bowls (didn&#39;t need many of these because I had a set of<br/>
old stoneware like bread/baking/mixing bowls from my grandmother) and pots<br/>
and pans.  I really lucked out here as I ran across a close out sale and got<br/>
a set of 3 cast iron frying pans for . . . sit down, I am not joking . . .<br/>
$1.50!  I also ran across another sale of Martha Stewart stainless steel<br/>
pots and pans that are HEAVY and have cast aluminum bottoms.  The whole set<br/>
was only $79.00.  I already had a set of Revereware that was my mother&#39;s so<br/>
I will be set in the cooking department.<br/>
<br/>
For storage we are using old mayo, pickle and other glass jars.  I buy<br/>
pickle chips in huge jars and they make great storage thingys for flour and<br/>
sugar.  I also found a great sale on some old-fashioned canning jars and am<br/>
using them for storage.  I&#39;ve kept old spice jars and am using them for<br/>
baking soda, baking powder (no aluminum) and salt that I buy in bulk from<br/>
the health food store.<br/>
<br/>
I also found an old-fashioned coffee pot that is all stainless steel, no<br/>
plastic and hubby grinds his own beans (organic).<br/>
<br/>
Hubby has cancer and IBS and when he was diagnosed we really took a look at<br/>
what and how we were eating and REALLY started reading labels and we about<br/>
died!  He is so much better now and the doctors are absolutely amazed at how<br/>
well he is doing--to the point of scratching their heads and looking<br/>
surprised.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579628884">Lynda, I could ask you a million specific questions about substitutions for <br/>
plastic, but I don&#39;t want to get too far off-topic for this list. (Will you <br/>
join the new organic list Tami started so we can all discuss more about <br/>
this?) Here&#39;s one example: sandwich containers. We use plastic containers <br/>
for sandwiches for lunch (when we are on the road) and for DH&#39;s lunch. I <br/>
thought this was at least better than using plastic wrap or wax paper, <br/>
since they were reusable and don&#39;t create waste. What do you use? Another <br/>
example: freezing foods. I do use (a little) plastic wrap and plastic deli <br/>
containers to freeze extra foods; what could I use instead? I have <br/>
eliminated a lot of plastic wrap by switching to covered glass casserole <br/>
dishes for leftovers.<br/>
<br/>
  See, too many questions! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the inspiring ideas. The few &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;frugal&quot; living sites I <br/>
have seen deal more with living cheaply than living in a more sustainable, <br/>
healthy way. I need more suggestions for the latter. How wonderful that <br/>
your lifestyle changes have made a difference in your husband&#39;s health. May <br/>
he continue to grow well! Did you find any particular books helpful?<br/>

&gt;and<br/>
&gt;am<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;using them for storage.  I&#39;ve kept old spice jars and am using them for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;baking soda, baking powder (no aluminum) and salt that I buy in bulk <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the health food store.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I also found an old-fashioned coffee pot that is all stainless steel, <br/>
&gt;no<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;plastic and hubby grinds his own beans (organic).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Hubby has cancer and IBS and when he was diagnosed we really took a <br/>
&gt;look<br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;what and how we were eating and REALLY started reading labels and we<br/>
&gt;about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;died!  He is so much better now and the doctors are absolutely amazed <br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt;how<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;well he is doing--to the point of scratching their heads and looking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;surprised.<br/>
