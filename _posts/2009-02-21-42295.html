<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116393969">Maybe it&#39;s because my 25th anniversary is next month and Keith and I  <br/>
have already decided not to do anything special.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve been really nice to Keith.<br/>
Surely it&#39;s partly that Keith is happy that the recession isn&#39;t  <br/>
kicking our butts, and he&#39;s the youngest of a family of money  <br/>
hoarders, all of whom are likely to die before he does.<br/>
Oh and maybe it&#39;s because the day before the conference is my  <br/>
birthday.    Keith&#39;s a sweetie.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s something, though, because when I built up courage for the speech  <br/>
to ask Keith if I could go to England for the conference there on July  <br/>
25, he said yes!<br/>
And when I asked my friend Helene McNeill if she might go with me, as  <br/>
she lived there a long time and is brave in London, she said &quot;YES!&quot;   <br/>
Except, she said, if she goes, she needs to visit her aunt in Paris.<br/>
<br/>
Shucks!<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ll get to go to Schuyler&#39;s house!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Woohooo!!!<br/>
<br/>
If I were a kid I would get on my bike and ride, ride, ride, but I&#39;m  <br/>
kinda old.  I think I&#39;ll go and talk to Keith, work in the yard, walk  <br/>
to the store, get the adrenaline out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
AND the conference organizer says I can speak there.<br/>
<br/>
Yes!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036998655">very cool!  my son wants to see medevil castles.  my daugher would love to go to paris.  my dream is to rent a house in provence, with a pool, near a village and nearish to aix, so we can have access to all kinds of stuff, and a place to retreat to - so the more introverted  members of my family can have somewhere to stay/retreat to if some of us want to venture out more than others.   i&#39;d love a month!  or  more!  a lt of the places even have wireless internet, so i am pondering whether my husband can work from france for a few weeks!  of course this is all in my head.  now i need to get it out on the table.  i am excited to be able to travel in september instead of summer vacations/spring break!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-904554161">coloring books, books of mazes, search and find books; I spy books are good too; books to to read to them, books on CD / MP3 Player; small lap / food tray size board games; card games - I got some really cheap decks of Old Maid, Go Fish, etc. for I think a dollar a deck at the drug store; string games - finger string games, I used to color and cut while weaving a story - kept Zac entranced for a while in Church; they make tiny containers of Play Dough, a baggie of Lego&#39;s; colored paper, colored pencils, hole punch, <br/>
<br/>
We took a back pack with us every where we went for years.  It stayed packed and stocked and we grabbed it anytime we left the house - in case we needed a quiet activity.<br/>
<br/>
On long trips we always stocked something new - could be cheap - to be able to pull out something new and novel when he got too restless.<br/>

Oh my, I really don&#39;t know what they will allow on planes now but I&#39;m just throwing out ideas anyway in case it jump starts your own juices flowing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048223565">To keep a healthy good mood I often take the children swimming for a couple of days at a time before departure,so that their body are toned-up and I keep them playing untill the plane is boarded and then I nurse them.So they fall in a deep sleep. I&#39;d keep the small baby in a sling while sitting so your arms are free.<br/>
We also bought dvd player and herbal remedy like lavander and chamomile. And drawing paper !And also one or two little story books.<br/>
The most challenging are the trips to the bathroom...We also give them fresh fruit to keep them refreshed.<br/>
We also plan a trip to Australia.<br/>

<h4>Schuyler at 2009-02-22 10:31:49 +0200 said:</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-136759937">We&#39;ve flown from the U.S. to the U.K. with little, little ones and from the U.K. to Australia a couple of times with older ones. Walking the aisles has always been an important distraction. Most people smile. Depending on who you are flying with, your children may be entertained by the crew. Singapore airlines have been incredibly child friendly. Nursing helps. Having food that they will eat is important, the child meals aren&#39;t specific to your child&#39;s taste. Get things that are new to you children to unwrap on the plane, and do wrap them in gift wrap. Little puzzles, coloring books, books, etc..over pack your carry ons. If you don&#39;t use what you brought, fine, but if there is something in there that you put in on a whim that holds either of your kid rapt for 15 minutes, that is so good. <br/>
<br/>
The layover is important. Go into shops, explore wander, run, play games, play tag. If you are going via Singapore, look for cool costumes, if you are going by Dubai, I bet their airport is good, via Japan, that would be fun too, Kuala Lumpur, really fun. I&#39;ve only ever gone through Singapore. But I can imagine that the other layovers would have heaps of entertainment. Singapore has a fish pond in the middle that&#39;s fun to wander through and gaze into, tossing coins in and talking about what you might have wished for. Spend money during the layover. Try and be as relaxed as you can be. <br/>

At first I was thinking if I got in that day I could sleep off the  <br/>
flight, and that might help, but #1, I&#39;ll probably go a few days  <br/>
before to be able to visit Schuyler, and #2, it&#39;s HARD for me to  <br/>
sleep, in England.  It&#39;s England.  And I&#39;ve only been in summer, so it  <br/>
seems to me the sun&#39;s always up in England.<br/>
<br/>
My Plan B is this:  I could document all the &quot;I knew that&quot; things I&#39;m  <br/>
seeing that day.  I could stay out of museums, eat American food, not  <br/>
watch TV, not ask what kind of birds those are...  I have months to  <br/>
prepare.<br/>
