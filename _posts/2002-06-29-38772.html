&gt; I called this &quot;some more primary-source unschooling stuff.&quot;  They&#39;re about <br/>
&gt; parenting and mindfulness and divergent thinking.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BOOKS TO HELP UNSCHOOLING PARENTS <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was so happy to see this list last week! I copied the works and went to my <br/>
library&#39;s online catalogue. I entered the books by title, no results. I <br/>
entered the books by author, no results. I entered the books by subject, no <br/>
results. :o( I am off to Barnes. I guess that is what I get for living in <br/>
this (as Moly calls it) &quot;stinky ole town where no one knows nothin&#39; and there <br/>
is nothin&#39; to do!&quot; She is right, this town stinks, literally and figuratively <br/>

single problem. (It&#39;s good to check the persons&#39;s feeback profile before<br/>
buying from the of course!)<br/>
<br/>
And <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.addall.com">http://www.addall.com</a> searches a bunch of used book services (including<br/>
half.com) and then sorts the books by price. (And the sorted prices include<br/>
shipping too.)<br/>
