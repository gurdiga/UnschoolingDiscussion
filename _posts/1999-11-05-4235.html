<div id="ygrps-yiv-531214560">I read the story and would like to voice a bit of dissent.<br/>
<br/>
Work is definitely over-rated.  Work often strangles the values which we purport to hold.<br/>
<br/>
When young Peter wants to quit after being verbally abused by a jerk his father goes on to say<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I knew, though, that if I just let him give up, he&#39;d never learn the importance of following through on<br/>
things. So I gave him a long lecture about how hard life is and how people are going to yell at him every day when he has a real<br/>
job. And I kept asking him if he wanted to go back and try for that radio, until he finally said yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t strike me as a very satisfactory response.  I personally don&#39;t want my children to settle for jobs where people are going<br/>
to yell at them everyday. Of course it is possible to badger a kid into doing what you think is right.  He could have just as easily<br/>
said &quot;Well selling stuff door to door is that way, maybe there is an easier way for you to get that clock radio you want.&quot;  I know this<br/>
lacks that certain work ethic, Calvinistic flavour which seems to appeal so much to many people but really seems more relevant.<br/>
<br/>
I find the whole exercise a &quot;teaching&quot; sort of enterprise.  The lessons in the whole thing have more to do with being exploited by a<br/>
number of different people.  Those lessons are important and Peter would have learned them, given the chance.  However the work ethic<br/>
propaganda of the father supplanted these real lessons.  So Peter winds up with getting a cheap radio for which he had to do unnecessary<br/>
work for a company that made most of the money, being abused by both a customer and (in my opinion) his father in the process.  In<br/>
addition he gets the message that one should put up with undeserved s**t instead of changing the situation and meeting one&#39;s needs in a<br/>
more satisfactory way.<br/>
<br/>
The lessons that there are unchangeable crappy things that happen, that there are evil exploitative institutions and employers from whom<br/>
you must accept crap, all can be learned if they must be learned at all ....on the job so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I am being simply contrary.  I didn&#39;t like the story.  I think that the virtues of struggling against adversity,<br/>
persisting in the face of obstacles, and being able to set a goal and achieve it are much better served by other stories.<br/>
<br/>
Eek. I  just reread the story again and like it less and less. Peter could have bought a better clock radio for 75 cents at a yard<br/>
sale.  Retch!<br/>
<br/>
Upon second reading I think the father is an unmitigated bully who is using his kid for his own vicarious satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot; But perhaps Peter&#39;s greatest reward is the pride he has given his parents, who know that their son can accomplish whatever he sets<br/>
his mind to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Therein lies the real confusion.  Peter is doing this to please his parents who don&#39;t really believe that Peter can accomplish whatever<br/>
he sets his mind to unless they &quot;teach&quot; or in this case &quot;make&quot; him accomplish it.<br/>
<br/>
John you seem right on the mark about many things but I think you should think this one out again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254083892">I have to agree!  Although I highly value a work ethic, I also want my <br/>
children to have common sense and the ability of discriminating judgement.  <br/>
If my kid really wanted that radio, and I felt he was going to be doing lots <br/>
of really tough work, the company would mostly profit, and the radio was bad <br/>
quality, maybe a brainstorming session on how best to acheive the goal of a <br/>
clock radio would have produced better results.<br/>
<br/>
Afterall, isn&#39;t it *smart* to look at a garage sale for a good one cheap, <br/>
then to do what he did!  That may be real life for some people, but I sure <br/>
like to think my family has higher standards for what we will take in real <br/>
life than that.  I don&#39;t think being screamed at on your job is a necessity!<br/>
<br/>
I would rather my kid have donated time to a service or charity organization <br/>
that what this kid did.  Time and work efficiency are part of the work ethic <br/>
too.<br/>

The whole thing is a spoof.  The Onion is a satirical newspaper.  My lead-in<br/>
was completely tongue-in-cheek.<br/>

<br/>
That is really funny!  I am embarrassed but I am still laughing.   Could of<br/>
fooled me.  They really sound like families I have known.  Sadly they sound like<br/>
my childhood family in many regards.<br/>
<br/>
I am still laughing.<br/>
<br/>
I am also greatly relieved that I don&#39;t have to continue trying to reconcile<br/>
other posts that you have written with this one which  I can now candidly say<br/>
was some kind of psychotic break.<br/>
<br/>
Apology accepted.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I know what you mean.  There are more than a few families out there<br/>
like that.  I see a fair amount of that attitude in yuppie families, but the<br/>
difference is that they don&#39;t make their children go door to door.  They<br/>
just encourage them to get into highly remunerated yet ethically dubious<br/>
professions such as advertising.<br/>
