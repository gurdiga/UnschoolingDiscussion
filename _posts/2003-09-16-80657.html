&gt; Making sure we are discreetly covered assures that open and unashamed<br/>
&gt; breastfeeding will never be accepted.  It is not accepted simply<br/>
&gt; because people have not become sensitized to it because they do not<br/>
&gt; see it enough.   It will never become accepted as long as it is<br/>
&gt; covered up.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally, I think it&#39;s a gradual process.  People are much more<br/>
comfortable with breastfeeding now than they were even a few years ago.<br/>
They&#39;ve seen people doing it relatively discreetly, and they&#39;ve seen<br/>
pictures in National Geographic or TV.  But I think the real progress is<br/>
likely made because children and teens are seeing it done more.  My son&#39;s<br/>
girlfriend was probably not nursed, and she&#39;s watched her niece being given<br/>
bottles.  But now she&#39;s watched my daughter not only nursing an infant but<br/>
also the almost 3 year old.  I think now she&#39;s more likely to nurse her<br/>
babies than she was.  But my daughter doesn&#39;t whip it out.  She gives<br/>
access.  There&#39;s a difference.<br/>
<br/>
They were at an outdoor concert I played in a couple of weeks ago.  The<br/>
almost 3 was nursing, and a little girl maybe a bit older was completely<br/>
shocked, asking her mother why he was sucking on his mother&#39;s boob.  She<br/>
kept asking and talking about it, and eventually asked Kaelin why he was<br/>
sucking on his mother&#39;s boob.  His answer?  &quot;Uh, I suck the milk out.&quot;  Too<br/>
cute.  That little girl now has something new to think about.<br/>
