<div id="ygrps-yiv-899345486">Hi everybody,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lurked enough and have thoroughly enjoyed the dialogue.<br/>
<br/>
I joined this list after 1.5yrs of homeschooling my 8yr old ds. I took him out of school half way through 1st grade when he was showing signs of depression. He was unstimulated and frustrated. He has huge frustrations with reading and writing (we are looking into vision testing)but is conceptually advanced in most areas. The crunch came when the school principal refused to accept his giftedness and stated &quot;I will not rearrange MY school for your child&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We have been feeling our way through homeschooling ever since. I have now come to the conclusion that I have been trying to &quot;school&quot; too much. I need to find a way to get him excited about learning again. I will go along with any interests he has but he is not very self led. He seems to need quite alot of guidance.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that total &quot;unschooling&quot; is our destination but I know that finding the right balance for my son (and his siblings) IS my destination. I am also sure that a large degree of unschooling has got to be the answer.<br/>
<br/>
Hence my plea to everyone out there! With all your experiences I hoping you can give me some guidance. I&#39;m someone who likes to see something produced on paper (workbooks look great to me although I&#39;ve never considered using a curriculum - he may as well be in school!!) but I know they are not for him. I want to inspire him again. I can see ways and means of unschooling most subjects (art, history, science,geography etc)since it seems to me that they are things we talk about and do as a family anyway. You&#39;ve probably guessed my problem; MATH. I can see introducing concepts while cooking and crafting and in general everyday life but how do you unschool the formulas for calculating the circumference of a circle, Pythagoras and higher Trig functions, calculus, physics functions etc? Do I just have to leave this until he picks them up himself - I think I&#39;m scared to do that. He likes math and science and these higher functions  are going to be important to be able to manipulate the<br/>
 concepts that he already understands.<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any help. Please be gentle with me, I&#39;m new to this ;.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>
Louise  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You may well find that unschooling is not for you and your family, but you <br/>
won&#39;t *really* know unless you jump in with both feet.  To do that, you <br/>
need to stop thinking in terms of school subjects at all, and start <br/>
thinking in terms of what will help your son explore the things he&#39;s <br/>
interested in.  If he&#39;s really interested in science and math, he&#39;s going <br/>
to be asking questions about those things.  You can help him go from one <br/>
question to the next and show him how they all connect.  If he really needs <br/>
calculus and physics, etc. to do what he wants to do, then you can help him <br/>
find ways to learn those things.  But start with where he is now and where <br/>
he wants to go now.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the reason I&#39;m jumping in here is that thinking in terms of school <br/>
subjects really got in the way of my own understanding of unschooling, and <br/>
I started out thinking I was a radical unschooler.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Our family is too new to unschooling to give any advice.<br/>
<br/>
However, regarding vision, we are quite well informed.  Our three sons all<br/>
have glasses for varying reasons.  Our younges is legally blind without<br/>
glasses, and 20/60 with them, he has extreme astigmatism and a crossed eye<br/>
and wears thick bi-focal glasses.  Our middle guy is not so bad, and our<br/>
oldest has bi-focals with a very weak prescription.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we have discovered Vision Therapy, and it has done wonders for our<br/>
children.  Vision Therapy is not only for children with extreme vision<br/>
problems such as our youngest two.  They use VT to treat ADD, and similar<br/>
problems.  There is great information on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
One good source is www.alderwoodvisiontherapy.com and www.visiontherapy.org.<br/>
There are other great sites as well.  www.children-special-needs.org.<br/>
<br/>
You may or may not be interested in the subject, but since you mentioned it,<br/>
I thought I would share.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;MOST&quot; children might read well at seven in school with materials created for <br/>
maintaining the illusion that seven year olds are reading well (that is, 2nd <br/>
grade level reading materials) but as to a person &quot;reading well,&quot; meaning <br/>
they can pick up anything off the table at the doctor&#39;s office and actually <br/>
read it, more likely ten years old for &quot;MOST,&quot; and thanks for pushing six and <br/>
seven year olds to read, it&#39;s NEVER for some people, because they just shut <br/>
down.<br/>
<br/>
Lest anyone here take comfort in the idea that maybe my kids are mentally <br/>
deficient, they&#39;re not.  But leaving them to learn to read naturally, they <br/>
read at 8, 9 and 10 years old.  That&#39;s if Holly&#39;s really reading fluently <br/>
before she turns 11 in November.  She&#39;s reading MOST of the words on Harry <br/>
Potter cards, but she doesn&#39;t go to the dentist and pick up a magazine yet, <br/>
and that is what I call reading.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ya think?<br/>
<br/>
My mileage varies, I guess...  at least for girls. Almost every<br/>
unschooled (or eclectically homeschooled with a real unschooling slant)<br/>
girl we&#39;ve known well has begun reading fluently (i.e., pretty much<br/>
anything they can put their hands on) between 6 1/2 and 7 1/2. Some, like<br/>
my daughter, had been slowly picking up words and concepts for years and<br/>
then suddenly took off at almost 7. Others had different patterns - one<br/>
girl we know was reading nothing when we went to Tucson and was reading<br/>
everything 6 months later when we returned, shortly before her seventh<br/>
birthday.  I do think there&#39;s a developmental change that happens around<br/>
6 1/2 - 7 1/2  in a lot of girls that makes reading suddenly easier. Not<br/>
all girls, of course, but half? Two thirds? I guess I do think most, and<br/>
I assume that schools originally wanted to capitalize on that<br/>
developmental shift... now, of course, they push reading on 4 yr olds. <br/>
<br/>
Granted, it&#39;s a biased sample mostly made up of girls who Rain likes, so<br/>
they may tend to have other personality traits that lead to reading at<br/>
that age. <br/>
<br/>
By experience with boys has been different, the unschooled boys we know<br/>
have generally started reading fluently around 10, but there&#39;s been a lot<br/>
more variation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to hear others&#39; experiences.<br/>

would have started on his own.  My granddaughter is reading a little at 7 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-942364599">This is exactly why I think all babies, by the time they are 6 months<br/>
old, should have a full vision exam by a pediatric opthomologist.  The<br/>
sooner you catch and treat eye problems the better.  I, unfortunately,<br/>
know a bit about this as my 7 year old has had three surgeries, wears<br/>
glasses, and was born with strabismus.  I knew something was wrong at 3<br/>
days old but my pediatrician said i was worried over nothing, and<br/>
refused to give us a referal. I didn&#39;t fight it, I was a new mom.  He<br/>
said that he would refer her at 2 months so I made an appt on her 2nd<br/>
month birthday and was given my referal but by the time we got to the<br/>
pediatric opth, she was 3 1/2 months old.  The first thing out of the<br/>
doc&#39;s mouth was &quot;Why didn&#39;t I see this child at birth!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can bet my 2nd child was in his office before she was a week old,<br/>
and she see&#39;s him every year or so, while Lexie visits her Ped. Opth<br/>
every 3-4 months.<br/>

<br/>
Janene is very frustrated at 4 that she can&#39;t read. I&#39;m not sure how to<br/>
deal with it.  Years ago I would have sat down with lots of different<br/>
curriculum stuff and taught her to read, as I did to so many as a<br/>
teacher.  I&#39;d rather she just wait and read as she is ready.  She may<br/>
not be so inclined. I guess if she asks me I will help her learn. She<br/>
really wants to do what Lexie does.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-879591191">Most of these concepts can arise in the normal questions children ask, for<br/>
example,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;formulas for calculating the circumference of a circle,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do the gears on a bicycle work?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Pythagoras<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How long does a piece of wood needs to be to brace the corner of woodwork<br/>
project?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Higher Trig functions,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Basic Trig can be covered in discussions about how ships navigate or how to<br/>
work out how tall a buliding is.  I can&#39;t think of how Higher Trig could be<br/>
brought up in the course of a normal conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;calculus,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another difficult one for normal conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;physics functions etc?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Discussing the way the physical world works, e.g. gravity, friction,<br/>
acceleration etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do I just have to leave this until he picks them up himself - I think I&#39;m<br/>
 </span></blockquote>scared to do that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see any problem with introducing concepts to children that they<br/>
would not have thought up on their own.  Often children don&#39;t know enough to<br/>
be able to ask questions.  I have no hesitation asking questions to<br/>
stimulate a particular line of thought. A good one is, &quot;Why do you think<br/>
that happened?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He likes math and science and these higher functions are going to be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>important to be able to &gt;manipulate the concepts that he already<br/>
understands.<br/>
<br/>
If, in fact, it is true that he will need &quot;these higher functions&quot; isn&#39;t it<br/>
better that the understanding be a natural outcome of his exploration and<br/>
desire to manipulate the concepts rather than abstract concepts learned<br/>
because some book says you ought to know it?<br/>
<br/>
I have serious doubts about the value of learning much of the higher math<br/>
amongst other things taught in school.  If I or my husband, who is an<br/>
engineer, cannot demonstrate to our daughter how we use a particular<br/>
mathematical concept we are uncomfortable about insisting she learn it.  We<br/>
are confident that should she need to demonstrate her knowledge of math<br/>
concepts or anything else in order to obtain entry to university, she will<br/>
be motivated to study them.<br/>
<br/>
None of us know exactly what academic skills our children are going to need<br/>
to be employable. Possibly up to 50% of the potential jobs have yet to be<br/>
invented.  There is no way you can possibly cover all possibilities.<br/>
Schools do not have any &quot;inside knowledge&quot; on what children need to know.<br/>
Just because school tries to teach particular concepts does not<br/>
automatically mean the information is worth knowing. Keep in mind that we<br/>
all have gaps in our knowledge and spend all our lives filling in the holes<br/>
we consider useful to fill.  Unschooling is a wonderful way to encourage<br/>
children to have confidence in their ability to fill of those holes at any<br/>
time in their life without having to rely on someone else teaching them.<br/>
<br/>
Trust in your ability to guide your children.  You know what basic skills we<br/>
all require to function effectively as adults in our society.  Children tend<br/>
to learn most of it through a desire to imitate the adults around them.<br/>
Make an effort to surround your family with interesting people and<br/>
activities, punctuated liberally with time for reflection and learning just<br/>
happens.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Regarding your statement &quot;lest anyone here take<br/>
comfort in the idea that maybe my kids are mentally<br/>
deficient, they&#39;re not&quot; - how did you become confident<br/>
enough to differentiate between your child not being<br/>
ready to read yet versus a learning disability?  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With or without a so-called &quot;learning disability&quot; (most of which are just <br/>
differences between that child&#39;s actual learning style or talents and what <br/>
schools WISH they had and did to &quot;stay on schedule&quot;), if a child isn&#39;t <br/>
reading he&#39;s not.  It cannot be forced.  If it could, there would be no late <br/>
readers in school.<br/>
<br/>
What CAN be done (schools prove daily) is that kids can be made afraid of <br/>
reading, can change their whole self-image because it didn&#39;t come easily on <br/>
schedule, and can decide books are stupid and they want nothing to do with <br/>
thm.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers can do that at home.  Many do.  I decided early on I wasn&#39;t <br/>
going to.<br/>
<br/>
I &quot;helped Kirby read&quot; in the traditional way two and a half times.  He was <br/>
late in his 6th year of life.  I was afraid he wouldn&#39;t read and maybe it was <br/>
my fault.  We both cried.  I realized it was harmful from the look in his <br/>
eyes, the slump of his shoulders, and the horror in me.<br/>
<br/>
The next two were spared anything they didn&#39;t request.  Lots of play and <br/>
games and songs and goofing with words, but not &quot;Come and do this now.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Holly asks for a reading lesson sometimes, and I&#39;ll write down some words or <br/>
find some flashcards or magnets and go through and find words I think she can <br/>
sound out.  She only wants five minute &quot;games&quot; of it, certainly not 45 <br/>
minutes or anything horrible.  <br/>
<br/>
As to whether they&#39;re smart enough to learn to read, Marty had the look in <br/>
his eyes the day he was born of someone who knew more than I did.  That <br/>
hasn&#39;t changed.  And he spoke well and early, understands concepts, uses cool <br/>
phrasings, and still, &quot;Verbal&quot; is not one of his main intelligences.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re rearranging furniture and rooms lately, slowly, gradually.  The box of <br/>
antique Tinker-Toys showed up on the table.  Marty built a frame with a crank <br/>
fan.  Not the straightforward easiest way, but with gears made by sticking <br/>
sticks into one of the free-turning round thingies.  And with a crank handle. <br/>
 No models, no suggestions, just built it.<br/>
<br/>
Language use and letter recognition and a phonics interest are called <br/>
&quot;reading&quot; or &quot;reading readiness&quot; in school, but in a school-free life, they <br/>
can be really separate things which will eventually come together on their <br/>
own and naturally, but the presence of one or another doesn&#39;t necessarily <br/>
mean the other is right around the corner.<br/>
<br/>
I have always thought a child who learns to read on his own will have a block <br/>
of confidence that nothing will shake.  A child whose mom &quot;teaches him to <br/>
read&quot; and &quot;teaches him math&quot; and thinks she taught him to walk and talk is <br/>
learning to wait for her to teach him history and teach him science.  If a <br/>
child feels that reading wasn&#39;t all that big a deal he will think NOTHING of <br/>
human anatomy or times tables.  They&#39;re very small bodoes of trivia compared <br/>
to figuring out all the rules and exceptions and patterns in written English.<br/>

I have come to hesitate about asking my children anything I wouldn&#39;t ask my <br/>

get TOO much of a teacherly attitude, though (and I&#39;m thinking of some <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-254301624">Joylyn, (and everyone else)<br/>
<br/>
My son also had strabismus at birth, and the Dr.&#39;s did not think it was a<br/>
problem.  However, since it runs in our family, and we had insurance that<br/>
you did not have to get a referral with, I went ahead and made an appt. with<br/>
a PO.<br/>
<br/>
Well, my child not only had extreme far-sightedness to the point of being<br/>
legally blind, but also a severely crossed eye.  He was put in glasses at 9<br/>
months old.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, to everyone out there, have your children&#39;s eyes checked EVERY year if<br/>
you can.  Both our youngest were in glasses for years before our oldest was<br/>
diagnosed.  We had him into the eye Dr. from 3 months old, only to be told<br/>
he was a little far-sighted, but appropriate for his age.  I still continued<br/>
to take him in, and low and behold, at the age of 8 he was losing vision in<br/>
one eye, and was prescribed bi-focal glasses which help him see SO much<br/>
better.  He was told he only needed them for close-up work, but he chooses<br/>
to wear them all of the time, which the Dr. said was just great.<br/>
<br/>
Have your kids eyes checked every year!!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yesterday I had a conversation with Lexie, Joylyn&#39;s daughter (:::waving to <br/>
Joylyn:::) who is 7, I think. I mentioned that I&#39;d read on the Scientific <br/>
American website that scientists are only just beginning to understand how <br/>
spiders can walk on their own webs without sticking to them. I described to <br/>
her how one kind of spider has a way of doing it, sort of mechanically - it <br/>
was complicated, but she listened with great interest. Then, when I&#39;d <br/>
explained it, she immediately started thinking of OTHER ways spiders might be <br/>
able to walk on their own webs without sticking. She started with, &quot;Well MY <br/>
theory is that ....&quot;. What I loved about it was that she didn&#39;t hesitate at <br/>
all to include her own theories right there in with those of the scientists. <br/>
And, in fact, her theories were excellent ones. One was that when the spiders <br/>
spin their webs, they leave unsticky spots and that the spider has an <br/>
internal map that tells it where those nonsticky spots are so that it can <br/>
walk all over the web. Another was that it secretes just a little dab of an <br/>
oil or something in its feet as it walks, that reacts with its own threads <br/>
and makes them not sticky.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - one thing I really like to do is find little interesting topics like <br/>
that, where scientists really do NOT have many answers, especially topics <br/>
that kids can really relate to. The reason the spider conversation came up <br/>
was because Joylyn was just sitting there and spider sort of dropped down on <br/>
her out of a tree, suddenly, and she was showing it to us.<br/>
<br/>
I need to remember to mention to Lexie (because she always likes these little <br/>
animal-related tidbits) that scientists think they&#39;ve discovered something <br/>
about how the Monarch butterflies know how to migrate thousands of miles <br/>
every year. They&#39;ve never really known - but now have evidence that they know <br/>
which way to fly based on the location of the sun. And they came up with an <br/>
ingenious way to study the butterflies, too, by tethering them so that they <br/>
think they are going somewher, but really don&#39;t, and putting a little teensy <br/>
sensor on them so they can keep track of which direction they are flying. <br/>
However, they still don&#39;t know at all how the butterflies know how to go back <br/>
to the same exact spots along the migration route. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-359408486">Thanks everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate all the responses to my original questions. They have definately helped me navigate toward my goal. Now all I need is to hit the delete button and remove all memories of my public schooling and a renewable prescription for CONFIDENCE!<br/>

&gt;&gt;Higher Trig functions,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Basic Trig can be covered in discussions about how ships navigate or how to<br/>
&gt;work out how tall a buliding is.  I can&#39;t think of how Higher Trig could be<br/>
&gt;brought up in the course of a normal conversation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;calculus,<br/>
&gt;Another difficult one for normal conversation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;&gt;Do I just have to leave this until he picks them up himself - I think I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;scared to do that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t see any problem with introducing concepts to children that they<br/>
&gt;would not have thought up on their own.  Often children don&#39;t know enough to<br/>
&gt;be able to ask questions.  I have no hesitation asking questions to<br/>
&gt;stimulate a particular line of thought. A good one is, &quot;Why do you think<br/>
&gt;that happened?&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;He likes math and science and these higher functions are going to be<br/>
&gt;important to be able to &gt;manipulate the concepts that he already<br/>
&gt;understands.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If, in fact, it is true that he will need &quot;these higher functions&quot; isn&#39;t it<br/>
&gt;better that the understanding be a natural outcome of his exploration and<br/>
&gt;desire to manipulate the concepts rather than abstract concepts learned<br/>
&gt;because some book says you ought to know it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have serious doubts about the value of learning much of the higher math<br/>
&gt;amongst other things taught in school.  If I or my husband, who is an<br/>
&gt;engineer, cannot demonstrate to our daughter how we use a particular<br/>
&gt;mathematical concept we are uncomfortable about insisting she learn it.  We<br/>
&gt;are confident that should she need to demonstrate her knowledge of math<br/>
&gt;concepts or anything else in order to obtain entry to university, she will<br/>
&gt;be motivated to study them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;None of us know exactly what academic skills our children are going to need<br/>
&gt;to be employable. Possibly up to 50% of the potential jobs have yet to be<br/>
&gt;invented.  There is no way you can possibly cover all possibilities.<br/>
&gt;Schools do not have any &quot;inside knowledge&quot; on what children need to know.<br/>
&gt;Just because school tries to teach particular concepts does not<br/>
&gt;automatically mean the information is worth knowing. Keep in mind that we<br/>
&gt;all have gaps in our knowledge and spend all our lives filling in the holes<br/>
&gt;we consider useful to fill.  Unschooling is a wonderful way to encourage<br/>
&gt;children to have confidence in their ability to fill of those holes at any<br/>
&gt;time in their life without having to rely on someone else teaching them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Trust in your ability to guide your children.  You know what basic skills we<br/>
&gt;all require to function effectively as adults in our society.  Children tend<br/>
&gt;to learn most of it through a desire to imitate the adults around them.<br/>
&gt;Make an effort to surround your family with interesting people and<br/>
&gt;activities, punctuated liberally with time for reflection and learning just<br/>
&gt;happens.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hugs,<br/>
