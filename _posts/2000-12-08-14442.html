<div id="ygrps-yiv-107922055">Another problem with this issue is the emphasis on the importance of<br/>
reading early.  Children who don&#39;t read well by 2nd or 3rd grade are at a<br/>
disadvantage in our current system, and are often categorized as special<br/>
needs or slow learners, etc.  I&#39;ve suggested to a few non-homeschoolers<br/>
that reading should not be taught until 3rd or 4th grade.  (Not my<br/>
original idea, and that would even be too early for some children.)  They<br/>
just can&#39;t imagine it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, how many adults &quot;hate the classics&quot; because our only exposure to<br/>
them was in high school classes where we were supposed to have all the<br/>
right answers on their plots, etc.  I belong to a book discussion group<br/>
now and really enjoy it.  The point of our group is to share our views on<br/>
a book and there are no right or wrong answers.<br/>

My 10 year old daughter and I belong to a mother/daughter book club at our <br/>
local library. Although she already has a very positive view of reading, it&#39;s <br/>
great to have the opportunity to discuss the books with a diverse group of <br/>
people. I have enjoyed it so much that I&#39;ve decided to look for a book club <br/>
for myself.<br/>
