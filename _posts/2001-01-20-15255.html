Like you I was always told never to sleep with my babies in case they <br/>
got rolled on.  Looking back, after reading all these posts on the <br/>
subject, my 2nd child would probable have been a much happier more <br/>
confident child, if I had known all this then...... He was very <br/>
insecure.<br/>
The kids did hop into our beds as they got older - but only in a <br/>
morning if they woke first.<br/>
I have enjoyed this thread<br/>
