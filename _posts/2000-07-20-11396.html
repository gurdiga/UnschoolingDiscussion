<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191899004">Hi Foks,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great to read this and be re-assured that all this works.  Unschooling is perfect for my 6 year old son.  He&#39;s high energy, self directed.  We need to make sure we schedule time for projects, otherwise I get so tied up with my business or general household maintence.<br/>
<br/>
How do folks balance time for un-schooling?  Do you block out time or let it happen when it happens or a mixture of both?<br/>
<br/>
By the way with reguards to fleas and poison ivy I use products with Melaleuca oil in them and it works great for the itch and the healing.  I also removed a wood tick after it just fell off when I applied the oil to it.   Not all Melaleuca or tea tree oil is the same.  I&#39;ve found a good quality one with the right combination of Terpine and Cineole and it&#39;s water<br/>
distilled.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; I&#39;ve got a cousin who has a terrible time with poison ivy and I remember as<br/>

&gt;  made regular old Lipton iced tea, pour it into ice cube trays and freeze<br/>
&gt;  it.When they were done he&#39;d rub them where he needed to. I imagine these<br/>
&gt;  were soothing because of the could and because of the healing properties of<br/>
&gt;  the tea. And at least with this one wouldn&#39;t need to be carrying around a<br/>
&gt;  package of cigarettes. I&#39;m not sure I care for that idea. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; yea, that&#39;s the tanic acid i think... there&#39;s a product called ivy dry that<br/>
&gt; has the concentrated tanic acid and alcohol in it that is great for poison<br/>
&gt; ivy... i use burrows solution on poison ivy ... and oatmeal baths... also the<br/>
&gt; best thing i&#39;ve used is that poison preventative called technu... if you know<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ve touched it, you can scrub your skin with it and it dissolves the<br/>
&gt; oils... if i don&#39;t have technu, i use dishsoap or turpentine... but i don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know how any of this works for flea bites...<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I have a question--I am highly allergic to flea bites. We were at the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Fairgrounds for 4H. and I was sitting on the ground w/my dd&#39;s club. I<br/>
&gt; &gt;never thought of fleas!!!  I got many many bites all over my legs and<br/>
&gt; &gt;thighs. they get red, hot  & painfully itchy.  does anyone know of any<br/>
&gt; &gt;herbal o homeopathic remedies for this?  I kept me up last night(along<br/>
&gt; &gt;with the person who called about homeschooling at 12:30am!!!!! but that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;another story!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;  thanks<br/>

&gt; Subject: fed up-- the ladies<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nance, the ladies are $50 every time they come. We have a small house, 2<br/>
&gt; bedrooms, 1 bath. So, it costs us $100 a month, and yes, I should be saving<br/>
&gt; that for the 3yo&#39;s college, but then I would lose my mind amid the mess long<br/>
&gt; before I saw him in his cap and gown. Another thing I love about these<br/>
&gt; housekeepers is there are six of them and they are done in 45 minutes or<br/>
&gt; less. They pile out of their van and deploy to every room of the house,<br/>
&gt; while I grab the boys and flee. I&#39;ve tried having one person do it but it<br/>
&gt; takes half a day and it&#39;s a bother having someone in the house that long.<br/>

&gt; Thanks for reminding me of my dear grandfather who chewed tobacco and of<br/>
&gt; getting bee stung while picking scuppernongs.  Grandpa would take a wad of<br/>
&gt; chewed tobacco out of his mouth & paste it right over the bee sting.  It<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; right.  yeah, that seems sensible.  i just don&#39;t keep stuff like that in<br/>
&gt; the house, it gets eaten before we can use it for that!  and the<br/>
&gt; whole thing takes too long for me to be able to say that we can do<br/>
&gt; something together after, they usually have lost interest/ found<br/>
&gt; something else to do.  though i could use that...  it&#39;s kind-of not my<br/>
&gt; problem now, since i&#39;m not there on a mon night for a few weeks,<br/>
&gt; but then again i don&#39;t want dh being heavy-handed about it, makes<br/>
&gt; problems the day after then...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; your set-up isn&#39;t the star-chart thing though, is it?  it&#39;s more like<br/>
&gt; positive reinforcement training than that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the thoughts<br/>

&gt; &gt; That isn&#39;t necessarily true. I know when I potty<br/>
&gt; &gt; trained my children, I would give them a piece of<br/>
&gt; &gt; candy when they used the toilet. I did this for a day<br/>
&gt; &gt; or two. Then quit offering the candy after that. If<br/>
&gt; &gt; they asked for it I would give it to them but I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; make an issue after they were used to using the<br/>
&gt; &gt; toilet. When I ran out of candy I just told them that<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was out and the next time I went to the store I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would get some more. They continued to use the toilet<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I always gave a verbal praise and made a big deal<br/>
&gt; &gt; of it verbally, but they forgot about the candy by the<br/>
&gt; &gt; time I got to the store and never asked for it again.<br/>
&gt; &gt; When I am trying to get them to pick up and they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to I will make a treat and tell them that they<br/>
&gt; &gt; can have it when they are done and praise them all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; way while they are cleaning. When they are done we sit<br/>
&gt; &gt; together and enjoy the treat in our clean house and<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a family time and talk about how nice it is to<br/>
&gt; &gt; work together and then when the work is done we can<br/>
&gt; &gt; all play together. That way it isn&#39;t like a bribe or a<br/>
&gt; &gt; reward but rather time we are using to learn and bond.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, I don&#39;t do this every time so they don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; &gt; used to having a treat for doing something they should<br/>
&gt; &gt; do anyway.    Corallyn<br/>

&gt; Subject: RE: Unschooling Questions<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;what drew you to unschooling?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son-a very active learner. He&#39;s unable to tolerate sitting still for very<br/>
&gt; long.  Over the last year of schooling, the lessons he remembers best are<br/>
&gt; the ones in which we just talked-he asked tons of questions and I answered<br/>
&gt; them, or, if I couldn&#39;t, we looked it up together. Usually while we talked,<br/>
&gt; he ran circles around the house, careened across the kitchen floor on our<br/>
&gt; wheeled desk chair, or rolled on the carpet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to know from people who began as homeschoolers and &quot;morphed&quot; into<br/>
&gt; unschoolers: what was the toughest thing about changing?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m ending my second year of homeschooling, and Seamus (7yob) has let me<br/>
&gt; know in no uncertain terms :-) he prefers unschooling.  He is an extremely<br/>
&gt; high energy child and reenergizes by interacting with others. Questions non<br/>
&gt; stop, always bouncing around and moving. Sit still and &quot;do homework&quot;!?<br/>
&gt; Nearly impossible, and quickly becoming unthinkable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a hard time keeping up with his energy levels. Regular homeschooling<br/>
&gt; is easier for me-but Seamus rarely gets fully engaged with this sort of<br/>
&gt; learning, so I&#39;ve been changing to meet his needs. It&#39;s tiring, but the<br/>
&gt; desire in me is there.  I&#39;m motivated to change every time I see him get<br/>
&gt; engaged in a sloppy unstructured &quot;lesson&quot;.  It&#39;s like a moment of zen, or an<br/>
&gt; epiphany, or the first time I ever ate Butter Toffee ice cream (mmm mmm mmm<br/>
&gt; good!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So for me, the hardest thing to overcome during my transition from<br/>
&gt; homeschooling to unschooling is constant drain on my energy level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What was the hardest thing for you-or was it a snap?  And do you have any<br/>
&gt; suggestions for me to get reenergized? (It doesn&#39;t help that my son is an<br/>
&gt; extrovert and I&#39;m an introvert.)<br/>

&gt; dealing with both of them, and as someone pointed out, the older<br/>
&gt; one is a very insistent person (lovely child, but just has a way of<br/>

&gt; games with them.  This is only this week, so i don&#39;t really know<br/>
&gt; whether it&#39;s making a difference or not.  Ah, well, I&#39;ll keep on<br/>
&gt; keeping on.  There was a programme on the telly earlier about<br/>

&gt; Subject: Lightbulbs<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;How many unschoolers does it take to change a lightbulb?  Just<br/>
&gt; &gt;one, but you might have to wait until they really, really see when<br/>
&gt; &gt;it&#39;s dark...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Tracy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Q: How does a home schooler change a light bulb?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A: First, Mom checks three books on electricity<br/>
&gt; out of the library, then the kids make models of<br/>
&gt; light bulbs, read a biography of Thomas Edison<br/>
&gt; and do a skit based on his life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Next, everyone studies the history of lighting<br/>
&gt; methods, wrapping up with dipping their own<br/>
&gt; candles.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then, everyone takes a trip to the store where<br/>
&gt; they compare types of light bulbs as well as<br/>
&gt; prices and figure out how much change they&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; get if they buy two bulbs for $1.99 and pay<br/>
&gt; with a five dollar bill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the way home, a discussion develops over<br/>
&gt; the history of money and also Abraham Lincoln,<br/>
&gt; as his picture is on the five dollar bill.<br/>
&gt; Finally, after building a homemade ladder out<br/>
&gt; of branches dragged from the woods, the light<br/>
&gt; bulb is installed. And there is light.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Got this from another list.<br/>

&gt; This website is wonderful.  While not as large as I am sure it will be one day, it is full of many more things than Pagan Childcare.  It has Playgroup listings, family ritual and holiday activities, links to Pagan homeschooling and Unschooling Website and message boards, and many other things.  It is a wonderful thing for a Pagan family like ours.  Thanks again!<br/>

&gt; &gt; right.  yeah, that seems sensible.  i just don&#39;t<br/>

&gt; &gt; that!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t usually keep candies in the house either. I<br/>
&gt; only used that for potty training, but I bake and<br/>
&gt; While the kids are tidying up I will put something in<br/>
&gt; the oven and tell them that if they are finished<br/>
&gt; before the treat is then they can have the treat. This<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t something I use all the time. Depends on the<br/>
&gt; situation. Also, sometimes instead of a treat I will<br/>
&gt; tell them they can&#39;t go play until they are finished.<br/>
&gt; This works just as well.  Other times they don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; either just knowing that they helped mommy clean up<br/>
&gt; and then they are off to do what they want. It just<br/>
&gt; depends on the situation and everyones mood. Corallyn<br/>

&gt; &gt;  I&#39;d like to know from people who began as homeschoolers and &quot;morphed&quot; into<br/>
&gt; &gt;  unschoolers: what was the toughest thing about changing?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Relaxing enough to trust that we will learn &#39;enough&#39;!  I&#39;m figuring out that<br/>
&gt; &quot;IT&quot; doesn&#39;t all have to be learned in 8 years or 12 years or 20 years.<br/>
&gt; Whatever we don&#39;t cover while my children are in my care, they will learn on<br/>
&gt; their own in years to come.  I&#39;m still learning about the world around me and<br/>
&gt; have every reason to expect they will do the same.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You said it yourself...the lessons your son remembers best involve his asking<br/>
&gt; lots of questions and getting lots of answers.  If you didn&#39;t know the<br/>
&gt; answer, you looked for them together.  Sounds perfect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only basics I want to make certain we cover are reading and math.<br/>
&gt; Especially the reading.  If he has the ability and desire to read, he can<br/>
&gt; find a resource and learn about anything that interests him.  I figure if he<br/>
&gt; has a good foundation in these two areas, he can find out anything else he<br/>
&gt; needs to learn when he needs it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Math also stimulates music, logic, science, art and general thought processes<br/>
&gt; in addition to helping him figure out taxes, change at the store, or whatever<br/>
&gt; other math/numbers solutions he&#39;ll need in life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as I&#39;m concerned, even more important than these &#39;disciplines&#39; are the<br/>
&gt; abilities to be compassionate, polite and considerate to other people while<br/>
&gt; being true to his own ideals.  My job is to help him find those ideals and<br/>
&gt; learn to put them into honest practice in his own life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The longer I practice at unschooling, the more excited I become about the<br/>
&gt; process!  It truly amazes me the things we discuss and learn when &#39;nothing&#39;<br/>
&gt; is going on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW, my unschooling experiences started with a stubborn teenager who refused<br/>
&gt; to cooperate with any formal schooling...at home or in a ps setting.  At that<br/>
&gt; point I figured my choices were to protect our relationship and wait for him<br/>
&gt; to become &#39;human&#39; again, while giving him opportunities to read, read, read<br/>
&gt; and explore areas that interested him, or I could beat the living daylights<br/>
&gt; out of him and &#39;force him to learn&#39;.  Let&#39;s just say it quickly became<br/>
&gt; obvious that &#39;forced learning&#39; was going to get us no where!  (and, just for<br/>
&gt; the record, I never did get around to the beatings!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That started when he would have been in 9th grade (we removed him from ps<br/>
&gt; mid-8th grade because he had figured out how to be lazy and use the<br/>
&gt; system...wait until mom got a failing notice at mid-term, turn in all<br/>
&gt; homework, getting straight &#39;A&#39;s on everything for 3 weeks and never turn in<br/>
&gt; any work again  would get him a &#39;C&#39; grade.  He was satisfied with that.  It<br/>
&gt; meant he didn&#39;t have to repeat the class and that&#39;s all he cared about.  He<br/>
&gt; saw no reason to prove to the teacher that he knew the material nor any<br/>
&gt; reason to wait around for the rest of the class to catch up to information he<br/>
&gt; had down already.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I did not want to encourage a beat-the-system attitude, so we withdrew him<br/>
&gt; from school.  Well, that coupled with the fact that the school district and I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t see eye to eye on appropriate reasons for him to miss school...ie his<br/>
&gt; father worked out of town all week, home every other weekend and I wanted to<br/>
&gt; take the children to visit for a 3 day weekend.  The school disapproved and<br/>
&gt; refused to &#39;allow&#39; the absence which meant automatic failing marks on any<br/>
&gt; missed work and no opportunity to make it up or do it in advance.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think it&#39;s the school principal&#39;s place to decide my family&#39;s lifestyle or<br/>
&gt; what the needs of my children are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, for several years, he read, asked questions and explored the world while<br/>
&gt; I felt I was neglecting his education but could find no way to convince him<br/>
&gt; that studying would be a good idea.  We tried to enroll him in the local<br/>
&gt; community college at age 16...he was excited and ready.  But, the cc insisted<br/>
&gt; we had to have a letter from the school district stating that he was released<br/>
&gt; from their education jurisdiction.  The school district refused to do any<br/>
&gt; such thing since he had never been under their umbrella.  So, we waited until<br/>
&gt; he was 18 and he enrolled in community classes, passing all the required<br/>
&gt; entrance/placement exams with no problems.  He took a couple of classes, just<br/>
&gt; for the heck of it, but still had some authority issues to work out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Eventually, (age 19) he decided it was time to get married and he wanted to<br/>
&gt; be an electrician&#39;s apprentice.  That meant he had to get a GED.  Other than<br/>
&gt; the college classes where he would not crack a book, but would listen to the<br/>
&gt; lectures, he had done no formal training for several years...5, or so, I<br/>
&gt; think.  I strongly suggested he study before taking the GED test so he would<br/>
&gt; be prepared.  Again, he was not interested.  The end result...the stinker<br/>
&gt; passed with flying colors the first try with no advance preparation!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That started me feeling a little more confident that unschooling would work.<br/>
&gt; so, with our second child (10 years younger), I&#39;ve been much more relaxed and<br/>
&gt; he finds his way to subjects when he&#39;s ready or has a need.  Some areas it<br/>
&gt; would seem he is &#39;behind&#39; peers his age.  For instance, today was the first<br/>
&gt; day he felt confident to declare he was going to go ride his 2 wheel bike on<br/>
&gt; his own...he&#39;s 11 1/2.  Works for me.  He decided he was ready and set about<br/>
&gt; the struggle to get the job done.  Not at all coordinated about it yet, but<br/>
&gt; very pleased with himself.  I strongly suspect he&#39;ll be using his bike quite<br/>
&gt; a bit in the next few weeks and who knows what will happen from there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; OTOH he has an inate ability to figure out math, science and logic without my<br/>
&gt; presenting the information to him in a formal way.  Out of the blue he will<br/>
&gt; tell me he has figured out such and so...After listening to some of his<br/>
&gt; theories and what led to his conclusions, I may give him the formal name of<br/>
&gt; what it is he&#39;s telling me and we talk about it, learning as we go.  It is<br/>
&gt; usually on the algebra, geography, physics or science level.  Sometimes he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; on the right track, sometimes not.  But by listening to his theories first,<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s ready to listen to what I have to say.  When I point out that we are<br/>
&gt; discussing subjects that I didn&#39;t learn about until college, he feels quite<br/>
&gt; pleased with himself.  It is very stimulating to both of us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another big factor to our using an unschooling approach (and another reason<br/>
&gt; for us to avoid ps) is my health.  I have a rather dibilating case of<br/>
&gt; fibromyalgia.  Many days are pretty bad.  It&#39;s not like I need him to take<br/>
&gt; care of me, but if I had to stick to a ps schedule and their requirements, it<br/>
&gt; would be very bad on my health.  I simply do not know from day to day how I<br/>
&gt; will be feeling.  It is VERY difficult for me to make a commitment to an<br/>
&gt; appointment and be confident I can keep it.  Takes days of advance planning<br/>
&gt; and reserving my energy when I know I have something coming up that I MUST<br/>
&gt; do.  So, on good days we do things together, on poor days I help him<br/>
&gt; self-direct his energies.  We couldn&#39;t do that with a ps experience.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s a bit of my experiences.  Hope it helps a little.  As I see it each<br/>
&gt; family has a different path and different things work for them.   There are<br/>
&gt; lots of inspiring stories of families out and about doing things every day or<br/>
&gt; several times a week, learning as they go.  I&#39;m jealous of the $$, time and<br/>
&gt; energy they have to be able to do that.  But, no sense dwelling on what<br/>
&gt; someone else is doing.  This is working very well for us.  The hard part can<br/>
&gt; be trying to explain it to others who are really wary or concerned that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; neglecting his education.  Especially my SIL who is a city cop AND on the<br/>
&gt; school board.  Basically I simply tell them we evaluate him on a regular<br/>
&gt; basis and he is making satisfactory/excellent progress.  That sort of phrase<br/>
&gt; seems to be enough of a techno-phrase to satisfy most people.  (except my<br/>
&gt; mother, but that&#39;s another story!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He always has a thick book in his hand and his nose in it; doesn&#39;t sit still<br/>
&gt; and do nothing for any length of time at all.  He may be watching TV or<br/>
&gt; playing &#39;tendo or &#39;playing&#39; &#39;puter games, or jumping ont he trampoline or<br/>
&gt; wrestling with his dad or cousins, but then there is lots of discussion about<br/>
&gt; what has happened.  (he&#39;s very verbal!)  Which leads to more discussion.<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s learning to train the dogs, which leads to learning about pack behavior<br/>
&gt; and other animal charactistics which leads to environmental awareness,<br/>
&gt; ecogoly, weather patterns/systems, astronomy, you name it.  It&#39;s a cycle we<br/>
&gt; simply cannot avoid.  Good thing, I suppose...BG<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One thing I try to do is keep up with what he is reading.  He reads on a<br/>
&gt; college level, which sometimes leaves him interested in books I don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s quite ready for.  OTOH sometimes he is reading adult level books I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; comprehend and he understands profoundly!  LOL  I learn along the way and it<br/>
&gt; helps me stay in touch with his interests as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; FWIW,<br/>
&gt; Eiraul<br/>

&gt; &gt; That&#39;s too bad that you didn&#39;t get any of our messages. There were several<br/>
&gt; &gt; good ideas. One of the suggestions I had was to talk to your pediatritian<br/>
&gt; &gt; and make sure it&#39;s not something else, mainly asthma. At one point or<br/>
&gt; &gt; another, when all three of my kids were babies they had what I assumed to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; croup and it was not. Two of them over the next couple of days were<br/>
&gt; &gt; diagnosed with RSV and all 3 of them eventually got diagnosed with asthma.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Turns out 2 of them have cold induced asthma, which was I thought it was<br/>
&gt; &gt; croup. They had other symptoms to support my theroy. Anyway, now we have<br/>
&gt; &gt; nebulizers and inhalers to get us throught these tough times. This is not<br/>
&gt; &gt; exactly what I wrote in my first post, but I think it&#39;s close :) Ohters had<br/>
&gt; &gt; good ideas about homeopathic remedies, etc. If I get a chance I&#39;ll dig<br/>
&gt; &gt; through my deleted items folders and see if I can come up with any of them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; A few days ago I was DESPERATE for info anyone might have regarding<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Croup.  The server was down though and I did not get any messages for 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; days.  I was wondering if anyone did respond to my plea and if anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; did would they mind re-issuing me their response.  My 22 month old has<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; had croup about 4 or 5 times.  No one else in our family ever had it and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my other two children have been free and clear.  I know about the steam<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or cold air trick but if anyone had something further to offer, I&#39;m all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ears<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We are all really sick now as a family...barking like dogs with vicious<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; coughs that don&#39;t permit sleep...<br/>

&gt; Hi Susan,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can&#39;t help you with theatre groups in D.C. but I can happily announce<br/>
&gt; that we have an excellent homeschool theatre group here in Saskatoon,<br/>
&gt; Sk. Canada.  It&#39;s even expanded into its own talent agency...<br/>
&gt; So if you need to connect with other resource people just let me know!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I used to correspond with someone named Jean who had a homeschool theater group near Washington, D.C. We were about to exchange some video tapes of each other&#39;s productions when I had big computer problems and lost her address.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Have any of you heard of such a person? I seem to remember she got into some disputes with people who thought she was excluding kids who didn&#39;t homeschool--I think she was even mentioned in Newsweek at one time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; My daughter woke up on Sat. with what sounded like the croup.  I agree<br/>
&gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; your friend, however we talked to the doctor, which prescribed something,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (this was the first time she had it).  My hubby and I decided we wanted to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; try to fight it as naturally as possible so we waited to see how she would<br/>
&gt; &gt; do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with some natural stuff for 24hrs as long as she did not get any worse.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hubby went to the health food store and told the lady what we were dealing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with and she helped him pick out some stuff.  We gave it to her and within<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 8hrs, you could hear the stuff in her chest breaking up and becoming loose<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; which she is now coughing out.  (Yuck, how is that for a visiual).  But<br/>
&gt; &gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I said, this is her first time with it.  We are also, trying to build her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; immune system with herbs.  The stuff we got was &quot;Respiratory &Lung support<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Horehound Blend-Herbs for Kids&quot; plus a bottle of Echinacea.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this help.  Just remember you are the expert on your little<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; one....follow your heart.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just have to add that croup is an inflammation of the airway in your<br/>
&gt; &gt; throat<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; area not the lungs.  They are unrelated though both can stop breathing if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they get bad enough. All of my kids have had croup at one time or another<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and most have been easily treated with the steam in the bathroom routine.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I have had one child rushed to ER when he started to turn blue.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Usually croup is harmless (sounds a lot worse than it is) and will pass in<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; few days but it still warrants watching, just in case.  Wheezing and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; coughing gunk up, on the other hand, is lung related and requires a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; different treatment (whether medical or homeopathy) than croup.  The good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing is that steam in the bathroom is good for croup and for gunk in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lungs so if you&#39;re not sure which it is, it will help regardless.<br/>

&gt; Thanks for the Refrigerator/Freezer trick, Karen!  Duh!  What was I<br/>
&gt; thinking?  I was stumped for summertime treatment.  And D.M. cough<br/>
&gt; suppressant, eh?  I haven&#39;t heard that one...Appreciate your help,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sonia, all 3 of my kids had the croup a few weeks ago.  My dh came down<br/>
&gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a cold, and they all caught it.  My oldest had it the worst.  He was<br/>
&gt; &gt; barking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; like a seal!  We took the kids to the ped. to make sure they did not have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; something else.  He told me that if any of them had real difficulty<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, then take them to the ER.  Otherwise, keep using the steam, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; freezer  (from the refrigerator) to help treat it.  If it did not improve<br/>
&gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a few days he would have considered using a steroid to help keep airways<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; opened, but after about 3 days it improved considerably.  He did recommend<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; using a cough med that had &quot;DM&quot; in its name , and also warm, soothing<br/>
&gt; &gt; drinks<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for the irritated throat.  My kids liked warm carob and milk.  Hope your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; little one feels better soon.  ~Karen<br/>

&gt; Hi Amy,  I need clarification...You say your kids only take asthma meds<br/>
&gt; during colds?  They have no other problems when they are healthy?  My<br/>
&gt; kid is great except when he gets a severe cold.  I didn&#39;t realize asthma<br/>
&gt; could be an on-again, off-again thing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; It sounds to me like this is more than a simple case of croupe. It sounds<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; like asthma. I would suggest you talk to your pediatritian about getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; him<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; going on some asthma meds (prob. albuterol and cromolyn mix) via<br/>
&gt; &gt; nebulizer.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am an asthmatic mom of three asthmatic children and believe me when I<br/>
&gt; &gt; tell<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you, diagnosing and treating asthma at a young age can mean much less<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; treatment and probs. I was not dx&#39;d until this year and I have a lot of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; damage to undo. All of my kids were dx&#39;d early on in life and 2 out of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; only need meds when they have colds . Please talk to your dr.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I need some good motherly (Or fatherly!) advice.  My 22 month old has<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; croup again.  My other two children never had it and in my family I grew<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up in none of us ever had it, so I&#39;m not overly sure how to treat it.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know about the steam and taking the child out into the cold air trick<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but this is summer so what do I do?  Also, when he&#39;s had it before (this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; might be his 4th episode), it&#39;s always happened at night and by day he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fine.  This time it started at 8 this morning and is continuing through<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the day...is it going to get worse tonight yet?  He seems basically<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fine, is not breathing with great difficulty, just wheezing alot.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all do have bad colds right now so it&#39;s extra tough for him breathing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when he&#39;s so congested.  Any advice, information or tips please?  I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appreciate anything anyone has to offer.  A friend in the past told me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to try homeopathy and I did try a couple of doses this a.m. and it did<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not seem to help at all.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: how we &#39;morphed&#39; to unschooling<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Eiraul, I knew I liked you! Now I know why-your story sounds so much like<br/>
&gt; mine!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My oldest boy was much the same-in the 5th grade at ps, my first parent<br/>
&gt; teacher conference had 2 teachers and the principal present to confront me<br/>
&gt; about how Rick was getting no score lower than a 95 from tests and classroom<br/>
&gt; work, but when they averaged in the homework that never seemed to make it to<br/>
&gt; class (although I was wasting all of our evenings making him do it) he was<br/>
&gt; getting D&#39;s. One teacher actually cried and said &quot;I&#39;m just afraid he&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; getting the practice he needs&quot;. Excuse me, but if you can get a 98 without<br/>
&gt; homework, why do you need it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Public school took up our entire lives, it seemed. If they weren&#39;t at<br/>
&gt; school, then they were doing homework or getting ready for school. Not to<br/>
&gt; mention all the times I had to race 20 miles to town to get something that<br/>
&gt; they just had to have for school tomorrow. Absentee policy was also a<br/>
&gt; problem for me, as the school and I disagreed on the importance of just<br/>
&gt; taking a day off to have some quality time alone with your mom. Now, where I<br/>
&gt; live, parents are even being taken to court and fined for school<br/>
&gt; absences-its a good thing we got out when we did!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Your younger son sounds alot like mine-I call him an unschoolers dream<br/>
&gt; child! He only went to ps for k and 1st grade, not enough to rob him of his<br/>
&gt; innate capacity to learn naturally-just because he wants to know. He also<br/>
&gt; was late to ride a bike! He reads alot, has fun with numbers, remembers how<br/>
&gt; to spell words easily, and is happy and free to be himself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I still worry that they are not doing enough actual school work sometimes,<br/>
&gt; that they will never learn to write, as it is something that the boys never<br/>
&gt; seem to want to do. I still hold out hope that when they get a bit older and<br/>
&gt; want to meet more kids on the net they will need to communicate in writing<br/>
&gt; and will then learn it-as everything else, when they decide they need to<br/>
&gt; know, they will learn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We do quite a bit of running around, there are alot of hsers in our area,<br/>
&gt; and many opportunities for classes and group activities. I also work 4 days<br/>
&gt; a week, so although I certainly do not envy your illness, I would like more<br/>
&gt; time to just talk as it seems to be our best learning time also. The years<br/>
&gt; when they were little and I stayed home were so full of joy for us all. Then<br/>
&gt; we may have only gone to town once a week-now it seems I am driving all the<br/>
&gt; time. I am trying to wean us all off of the constant running so that I can<br/>
&gt; drop at least one more day of work. But as soon as I think that, I get an<br/>
&gt; email about gym day and think, Oh, wouldn&#39;t that be fun! (I am still trying<br/>
&gt; to decide on that one)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I love hearing about your oldest son. It is so reassuring to know that it<br/>
&gt; pays off and I think about these kids often when I have my doubtful days.<br/>

 How do folks balance time for un-schooling?  Do you block out time or let it <br/>
happen when it happens or a mixture of both? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A mixture.  Mostly things happen but then we do have outside lessons and an <br/>
online class so they have actual scheduled times and then we have to plan <br/>
ahead, around the rest of life, for &quot;field trips&quot; etc.  So it&#39;s a mix.  But <br/>
it&#39;s OUR mix!<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Definately a mixture-the key thing is following your childs interest. Once <br/>
you two figure out what it is that he wants to learn the schedule may come <br/>
in to effect. For example, if he gets into photograghy, the picture taking <br/>
could be any time at all, but making arrangements to visit a professional <br/>
studio, or a photo journalist would take some planning. If he got really <br/>
into it and wanted his own dark room you may want to take a class somewhere <br/>
and it may take some time and budgeting to come up with all that he needs to <br/>
do it.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, some of the best learning may come from a good conversation <br/>
while hanging out the laundry, or learning to calculate cost per ounce while <br/>
you are at the grocery.<br/>
<br/>
If you are lucky enough to have alot of active hsers in your area you will <br/>
find group classes that sound interesting to him or to you, so you sign up <br/>
and go for it. We had a wonderful Environmental Education class put together <br/>
by a Mom that I chose for us to do, it turned out to be alot of fun, and we <br/>
all learned some great stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the kids may not know what it is that they want to <br/>
learn-especially for the older kids in the deschooling process-but if you <br/>
find some thing that sounds cool and take them it may pique thier interest. <br/>
Museums, parks, science fairs, air shows, small town festivals, craft <br/>
classes at a fabric store, civil war reenactments, rennasaince fairs, oh, <br/>
the list goes on and on. We have a local hs list-Ohio Home Schoolers-where <br/>
people post just these kinds of activities so you can hear about all the <br/>
small things that turn out to be big stuff for your family. Last year when <br/>
someone posted a small county airport having an air show, my ds, who wants <br/>
to fly more than anything, used his birthday money for a plane ride, and the <br/>
pilot let him fly for a good half an hour! That was one happy day for <br/>
Nicholas!<br/>
<br/>
Just have fun with your kids, and you&#39;ll be amazed at all the things you can <br/>
do.<br/>

Here&#39;s another example from real life.  Today we were on our way to the <br/>
store.  My son has read the first few chapters of The Cartoon Guide to <br/>
Physics.  We have since encountered a couple of times when we realized we <br/>
were observing one of Newton&#39;s laws in action.  Today we saw a train on our <br/>
drive.  It was a loooooong train.  So we got to discuss how the engine had to <br/>
overcome a lot of inertia to get the train started but once it was rolling, <br/>
would not be easy to stop -- Newton&#39;s 1st law and never play on the train <br/>
tracks all rolled into one talk.<br/>
<br/>
So, there was actual sitting and reading time (actually most of the time he <br/>
was sort of upside down hanging all over the couch and chuckling at the silly <br/>
cartoons and reading parts to me) so that was kind of structured but he had <br/>
selected the book (after I pointed it out among others that people had <br/>
recommended) and was reading it when he wanted to.  So that&#39;s probably as <br/>
close to structured as I get on that.  Then there was the observation part of <br/>
the &quot;lesson&quot; -- I thought it worked out well but obviously not planned at <br/>
all. <br/>
<br/>
It made the ride to the store more interesting, anyway!<br/>

&gt;Here&#39;s another example from real life.  Today we were on our way to the<br/>
&gt;store.  My son has read the first few chapters of The Cartoon Guide to<br/>
&gt;Physics.  We have since encountered a couple of times when we realized we<br/>
&gt;were observing one of Newton&#39;s laws in action.  Today we saw a train on our<br/>
&gt;drive.  It was a loooooong train.  So we got to discuss how the engine had <br/>

 </span></blockquote>These are the absolute best kinds of days, aren&#39;t they?  We went on a field <br/>
trip once to a bog that was created by glacial movement. Months later while <br/>
on a day trip my kids pointed out that the flat land we were traveling <br/>
through was from those glaciers that stopped before they got to the rolling <br/>
hills where we live. Its all so much better when they really grasp and <br/>
retain these things for life instead of just til they regurgitate them for a <br/>
test and then forget.<br/>

Well, it certainly seems that way.  And I hope it&#39;s true!!  <br/>
<br/>
But I also think it&#39;s one big experiment and I probably won&#39;t be around when <br/>
the &quot;results&quot; are in.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>
