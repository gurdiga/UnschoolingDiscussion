I know now and have known over the years a heck of a lot of kids from almost <br/>
every conceivable educational setting. Unschooled kids, all their lives <br/>
homeschooled kids, schooled then homeschooled kids, public schooled kids in <br/>
many different cities and different levels of funding, privately schooled <br/>

you buy a book published in the 90s and look at the RL and then buy the same<br/>

available to help us if we want it.  I asked ours once how many kids in the <br/>
average grade 4 class would be right at grade level in all subjects.  His <br/>
answer was none of them.  They would all be ahead or behind the curriculum <br/>
in at least one or two subjects.  This teacher spent a lot of years in <br/>
regular classrooms before joining the distance ed program.<br/>

When I went to Seattle to pick Mark up after Thanksgiving I found <br/>
some terrific old books in a little out of the way antique store! One <br/>
classic item is &quot;How to Organize, Classify and Teach a Country <br/>
School,&quot; by W.M. Welch, A.M., published in 1886. Check this out, from <br/>
page 11:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;As soon as you have secured a school and made your contract, next <br/>
learn all you can in a general way of the district in which you are <br/>
to teach. Find out what you can of the character of the neighborhood, <br/>
the customs, religion, etc. of the people, and the peculiarities of <br/>
the different families. Find out who the leading families are, and <br/>
engage your boarding place with on of the best families, of course.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And this: &quot;Visit your patrons, one and all. It will take a little of <br/>
your time, but you will more than save it in the long run. Get the <br/>
favorable opinion and friendly regard of your patrons once, and you <br/>
sow good words for yourself in every household. There is no better <br/>
way to secure parents&#39; cooperation. Next, get a list of all the young <br/>
people of school age in your district from the sub-director and see <br/>
how many of them you can interest in school work. If you can get them <br/>
all to attend school during the winter term, you do a grand work. Do <br/>
not hesitate to try to have some attend who have not been to school <br/>
in a long time, or who are &#39;sowing wild oats,&#39; etc. Get them into <br/>
your school and do all you can for them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Fascinating little book - I also found a first edition (1916) copy of <br/>
Robert Service&#39;s &quot;Rhymes of a Red Cross Man,&quot; which has some of my <br/>
favorites from Service, and several others, like &quot;Star, The Story of <br/>
an Indian Pony,&quot; (copyright 1922 but this edition is from 1946). This <br/>
book includes a foreword from Lt. Gen. Nelson A. Miles: &quot;Let <br/>
reservations be reasonable in size and subject to special rule and <br/>
government until the Indians are fitted to obey the ordinary laws of <br/>
the country which have been made to control educated and intelligent <br/>
white people.&quot; Zowie. Talk about an attitude, eh?<br/>

I need to scoot, getting ready to hit the dusty trail north, but <br/>

&gt;tattered copy, part of my old book collection. This copy is from 1914 and is<br/>
&gt;signed on the front page to Olga Rickert from Edith W. as a Christmas gift.<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s by R.D. Blackmore and is titled &quot;A Romance of Exmoor&quot;<br/>
&gt;Embarassingly enough, I have not yet read it. Hey, I&#39;m a Bibliophilia and own<br/>
&gt;many books I have yet to read.....not enough time in a day.....sigh.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, this is one of my passions, too. I have hundreds of old books, <br/>
and while I haven&#39;t nearly read them all (too little time, too many <br/>
books), I keep looking for them and lugging more home with me every <br/>
chance I get. I find a lot of good old books in my travels, and often <br/>
the inscriptions are as interesting as the books themselves. My <br/>
favorite is a large book of very romantic poetry published in the <br/>
1860&#39;s, which was apparently given to a girl by a fellow who wrote a <br/>
very poetic note along the lines of &quot;Read every poem in this volume <br/>
and then double the feeling and then double it again and that still <br/>
won&#39;t come close to my feelings for you...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So romantic - I&#39;ve always wondered about those people, what happened <br/>
to them, did they live happily ever after?<br/>

<br/>
We too have many, many old books that we lug from state to state. &lt;g&gt; Many <br/>
were inherited and lots of them are actually too fragile for us to read. So <br/>
if a title interests us enough to read, we get it from the library.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite inscriptions was to my father-in-law in 1937. It said <br/>
&quot;with all great wishes for a long and adventurous life.&quot; He would have been <br/>
about 9 or 10 at the time and the book is Mysterious Island by Jules Verne. <br/>
My fil is a quiet man with gentle pastimes. I often wonder if he feels he&#39;s <br/>
had his adventures. I like to think that in his own way he has.<br/>
<br/>
I also just found a book of Rudyard Kipling poetry with a 1928 Chrristmas <br/>
stamp inside. The owner is a Geo. Morris. My grandfather&#39;s name was Walter <br/>
Morris. I wonder how many generations this one goes back? Time to ask Dad, <br/>
the geneologist.<br/>
