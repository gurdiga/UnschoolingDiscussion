<div id="ygrps-yiv-839181045">&lt;&lt;How unschooling won&#39;t work&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I think it will always work, but what the kids learn might be twisted<br/>
in some situations.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  Parents say they are unschooling but don&#39;t actually trust the kids<br/>
to make choices, i.e. glares silently at kid if TV is on too long, &quot;loses&quot;<br/>
the gameboy, is all happy and smiling if kid chooses a workbook,etc..<br/>
<br/>
Example:  Parents are drunks with few interests outside of a bottle.  Kids<br/>
not allowed to go out into the world because they might &quot;spill the beans&quot;.<br/>

You,  me,  and the preschool directors are on the same page on this one.<br/>
They stuck to their guns in enabling the two severely allergic kids the<br/>
opportunity to attend.  I used to be on the Board at this pre-school.  I<br/>
love them for their &quot;play is the work of childhood&quot; philosophy.  And their<br/>
firm stance in not pushing &quot;academics&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
An the staff had no problem;  just a few parents.....It was strange to<br/>
wonder about what message those kids of the complaining parents are hearing.<br/>
The preschool is only two days a week, 4 hours each.  Even if your child<br/>
insisted on peanut butter or peanut products daily.....there&#39;s always after<br/>
school snacks......other opportunities to eat on &#39;school&#39; days.....and FIVE<br/>
days a week when it&#39;s not an issue for those children who don&#39;t have a<br/>
problem!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-35141164">You could &quot;get sick&quot; &lt;vbg&gt;. I don&#39;t mean to be<br/>
flippant, but I think that&#39;s what I&#39;d be tempted to do<br/>
if I thought I was going to be attacked and undermined<br/>
on 3 separate occasions (but of course then you<br/>
wouldn&#39;t see the family that you want to see)! Could<br/>
you say something like this to your brother when you<br/>
meet up: I know you don&#39;t approve of my homeschooling,<br/>
but the fact is I know it is the right thing to do for<br/>
MY family. We will have to agree to disagree on this<br/>
subject. I don&#39;t want to get into any discussions<br/>
about it and I don&#39;t want any comments made about it<br/>
while we are together. It makes the visit tense for me<br/>
and I can&#39;t relax and enjoy myself fully.<br/>
If he persists, you could tell him outright that your<br/>
homeschooling has nothing to do with him and that no<br/>
matter how hard he tries, he will never have control<br/>
over the situation, so let it go!<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

&lt;&lt;Hi, folks --<br/>
<br/>
Thanksgiving is coming.  And while I love most of my<br/>
relatives, there <br/>
is<br/>
always potential for the big<br/>
&quot;we-think-you-shouldn&#39;t-homeschool&quot; fight <br/>
at<br/>
any family gathering.  (Or long car trip with my<br/>
brother.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t take criticism really well -- especially the<br/>
heavy-handed kind <br/>
that<br/>
starts with &quot;your are ruining this child!!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anybody got any happy thoughts for rising above this<br/>
or just slogging<br/>
through?  I&#39;m going to three and a half family<br/>
gatherings over the long<br/>
weekend, and it&#39;s really more than I can sail through<br/>
serenely.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Betsy&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Meghan --<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll put your idea together with some of the others and that&#39;ll get<br/>
me through.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m inspired by your suggestions, and the previous ones, to say (to any<br/>
provocation) &quot;Thanks for the suggestion.&quot; and &quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind.&quot;<br/>
Then I can dwell on the fact that their suggestions are JUST WORDS and they<br/>
don&#39;t have the power to come to my house and tear up my R-4 form and march<br/>
my son down to the school and enroll him.<br/>
<br/>
If I can&#39;t hold on to my cool, I think I&#39;ll borrow someone else&#39;s.  (I&#39;m<br/>
thinking the stereotypically stiff-upper-lippy Giles, in Buffy the vampire<br/>
slayer saying oh-so-mildly &quot;If I want your suggestions...&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I always feel so terrible when I fly off the handle.  But, honestly, people<br/>
say some shockingly rude things.  (&quot;You&#39;ve gotta put this kid in school or<br/>
he&#39;ll never be normal.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  (&quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind&quot; means I&#39;ll memorize every harsh word you<br/>
said and then I&#39;m gonna come on line and mock you to my friends here.<br/>
Snort.)</div>

&gt;When people are shockingly rude to you, I see no reason to be polite back.<br/>
&gt;I never could figure why some families (mine included) seem to think that<br/>
&gt;politeness is reserved for non-family members and not needed with family<br/>
&gt;members.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t figure that one out either.  The other day, my MIL told my <br/>
step-daughter that her hair was awful.  It was the worst colour she had <br/>
chosen yet, and she looked like a witch.  Emily certainly chooses some <br/>
outrageous fashions in hair and clothes, but I thought we had managed to <br/>
convince the grandparents that she was still the same person inside.  Emmy <br/>
is pretty thick-skinnned around strangers, but it hurt her badly coming <br/>
from her beloved grandmother.  I couldn&#39;t believe she would say a thing <br/>
like that.  I know she wouldn&#39;t say something like that to a friend.<br/>
