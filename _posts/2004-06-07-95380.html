<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618885261">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
This looks like a GREAT place to jump in and intro my family.<br/>
<br/>
I am a single mother in CA, my daughter is 7 (going on 58 hahahahah).<br/>
When I first met unschoolers the term HORRIFIED me!!! That was when <br/>
Lenelle was about 4 and I who had been to school and only met one <br/>
very regimented and seperatist family of homeschoolers ever in my <br/>
life still equated school with education. (Even that statement <br/>
doesn&#39;t make sense as I write it since the 6 girls I remeber seemed <br/>
as educated as any of my school peers the years that I had them as <br/>
neighbors)<br/>
<br/>
Ironically never sending my daughter to school, organizing our life <br/>
into a type of school or joining a charter, but simply embracing life <br/>
and motherhood while watching my child grow and learn by leaps and <br/>
bounds finally it seems is revealing, the term unschooler has always <br/>
fit our life.<br/>
<br/>
No one I had ever known had ever breast fed around me but I had <br/>
always wanted to nurse rather than bottle feed so I began looking <br/>
into it while I was pregnant and was enveloped into the world of <br/>
lactation moms and babies who it turned out in our case were also <br/>
largely homeschooling families as well.<br/>
<br/>
The original breastfeeding ads I thought were right on target using <br/>
shock and humor to shake people up abit and inform them. It would <br/>
have been different if they used real pregnant women but they knew <br/>
better. <br/>
