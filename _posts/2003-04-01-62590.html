We never ate fish when I was growing up (I still don&#39;t, usually).  My<br/>
mom hated fish because her parents served it every single Friday and<br/>
every single time they served it, her mom would say, &quot;Don&#39;t choke to<br/>
death on the bones.&quot;  That effectively ruined her appetite for fish.<br/>
