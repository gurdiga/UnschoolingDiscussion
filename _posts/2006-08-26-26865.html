-=- Next year will be in Black Mountain, NC---just outside of  <br/>
Asheville. It&#39;s a YMCA camp. With hotel accommodations, cabins, and a  <br/>
family lodge. No tent or RV camping, but there is a KOA 3 miles away.  <br/>
It&#39;s a beautiful area, and the camp has so much to offer. We&#39;ve  <br/>
signed a two year contract with the option of five more, so we&#39;re  <br/>
planning to settle here if we like it. Always the weekend after Labor  <br/>
Day.<br/>

I will send more details on the camp after this year&#39;s conference.-=-<br/>

<br/>
And even if you can&#39;t go to this year&#39;s conference, you might want to  <br/>
follow the discussion of plans for next fall&#39;s, which is including  <br/>
talk about regional conferences in the Spring, maybe in Arizona,  <br/>
maybe in northern California, likely other places too.<br/>
