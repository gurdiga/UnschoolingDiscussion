Didya hafta mention TJ&#39;s? Sheesh..every list I&#39;m on I seem to get reminded!<br/>
I miss that place.<br/>
<br/>
Ummm...<br/>
I think the only problem I have with the idea that our souls choose their <br/>
families is how the Hell do you explain innocent, beautiful children getting <br/>
the crap beat out of them by some abusive jerk?<br/>
I can not stomache the thought that any life form would choose that for any <br/>
reason whatsoever.<br/>
I sometimes play around with that idea in my mind...that my children chose us <br/>
for their parents, it does make me feel good.<br/>
It does seem that they were meant to be here, with me, I believe that. But I <br/>
just can&#39;t <br/>
reconcile that thought of all souls choosing and that some would choose the <br/>
torture of the parents they get.<br/>
No, I&#39;d rather stick with the randomness and believe that those souls need <br/>
our intervention because they didn&#39;t choose it at any level and they <br/>
certainly don&#39;t deserve it.<br/>
Not that all things aren&#39;t connected.<br/>
I just can&#39;t believe in the choosing part.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not something I really believe either. It was just a conversation we <br/>
were having with Conor once about what some people believe. The point I was <br/>
making with that little story was really about the comment he made. I try to <br/>
be mindful of the fact that his life would have been much different had he <br/>
remained an only child.<br/>
