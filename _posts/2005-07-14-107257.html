 </span></blockquote>Well if that&#39;s so, and parenting is not a factor and what they do has no <br/>
reflection on the way they were raised,   there&#39;s no reason to write a book at <br/>
all.   There&#39;s not even any reason to unschool.   <br/>
<br/>
At no point does a parent get the opportunity to &quot;recognize&quot; that nothing <br/>
they did while their children were growing up affected what they did as adults or <br/>
how they did it.<br/>
<br/>
Why would one even want that?<br/>
OH.   I know some who don&#39;t want that.   My mother, who botched raising my <br/>
half brother whose last act regarding her before she died was to steal all her <br/>
money TWICE (quickly, from a second ATM) and leave the state.     She would <br/>
like to think that it has nothing to do with how she raised him.<br/>
