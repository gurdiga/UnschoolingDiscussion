<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005751833">Dear Fellow Homeschooler,<br/>
<br/>
Admit it!  Homeschooling does have its funny moments.  And <br/>
Homeschooling Humor is the topic for an upcoming segment in NHEN&#39;s <br/>
website. I&#39;m gathering humor pieces for the HS Humor POV.  I have <br/>
several that have crossed my screen over the years and have kept for <br/>
posterity, but I know there&#39;s more out there - some of which hasn&#39;t <br/>
even been written yet.  We&#39;re hoping this project will inspire <br/>
homeschool humorists and pundits across the country to share their <br/>
wit.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve collected any of the many homeschooling jokes that have <br/>
flown through cyberspace over the years, please forward them to me at <br/>
&lt;mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cmoxley@...">cmoxley@...</a>&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cmoxley@...">cmoxley@...</a>.  I will make every attempt <br/>
to credit the original author of the joke or anecdote if that person <br/>
can be found.<br/>
<br/>
If you yourself have created a joke, humorous essay or anecdote that <br/>
shows the lighter side of homeschooling, we&#39;d love to include it. <br/>
Again, just send to &lt;mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cmoxley@...">cmoxley@...</a>&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cmoxley@...">cmoxley@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Jokes, limericks, anecdotes, essays . . . if it&#39;s funny, send it in!<br/>
<br/>
So!  Once again . . .How many homeschoolers does it take to change a <br/>
light bulb?   (We&#39;d love to have MANY punch lines in answer to this!) <br/>
And don&#39;t stop there . . . Why did the homeschooler cross the road? <br/>
What do you get when you cross a homeschooler with an elephant?  What <br/>
time is it when a homeschooler sits on a fence?  Silly, creative, <br/>
funny . . .  your joke could end up on the pages of NHEN!!!<br/>
<br/>
Please forward this to your homeschooling friends.<br/>
<br/>
Carol<br/>
