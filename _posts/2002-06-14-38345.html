finished. One just got her bachelor&#39;s degree in a 100 percent online program <br/>
through Hope International University (a Christian college) and my other <br/>
sister who lives down here in Southern California just got her masters degree <br/>
in library information science from Cal State San Jose (400 miles away). She <br/>
had a few class meetings at another Cal State campus -- but 90 percent of her <br/>
program was online.<br/>

interesting to me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d appreciate any info:)<br/>

<br/>
Go to petersons.com ... in the top right, select<br/>
&quot;Distance Learning&quot; from &quot;jump to area of interest&quot;.<br/>
You can search by type of degree (certificate,<br/>
associates, bachelor, masters, etc.), area of study,<br/>
whether or not residency is required, etc. It&#39;s a<br/>
great place to start looking for distance ed programs.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s good to know.  I&#39;ve been toying with the idea of studying Library<br/>
Science myself.<br/>
<br/>
I live less than 10 miles from the SJSU campus, but I&#39;d MUCH rather take<br/>
classes online.  (Maybe it&#39;s an introvert thing.)<br/>
