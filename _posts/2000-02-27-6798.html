I can see no better lessons in how to handle money, spending responsibly, making wise purchase choices, money management, saving, etc, than those learned from experience with their own money.<br/>

To get 25%, you could just have him separate the money into 4 equal piles.<br/>
He doesn&#39;t even need to know how to count it, just a quarter for each pile,<br/>
a nickel in each pile etc...  Then when it is all divided up, one pile is<br/>
25%.<br/>

Because at seven years old he has a tendency to buy everything in site!<br/>
It turns out to be a big huge waste of money, and for junk.<br/>
I don&#39;t put money away each month...we have invested for each for the<br/>
future.<br/>
I think this is a way for him to learn to put a portion away without<br/>
spending it all.  It will become automatic.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> We have a seven year old as well... He is also into money.  In the past it<br/>
was easier since he just let it save up in his piggy bank untel he had<br/>
enough to buy whatever it was he was saving up for.... but not so now....<br/>
<br/>
Now he has a greater awareness of all his choices.  He gets $2.00 per week<br/>
to spend as he likes... he went through a period not too long ago where he<br/>
would buy a package of Pokemon cards every two weeks... bun thankfully that<br/>
has passed, and he is now into saving it up with his brother, so that they<br/>
can save up for larger items.  (legos, science kits, CD rom games etc.)  We<br/>
just let him do it and found the more we pressured him to spend it according<br/>
to our ideas... the more determined he was to spend every last penny on<br/>
Pokemon cards...   I remember as a youth myself... as I got older I gained<br/>
the discipline to save for progressively bigger items... a watch, a bicycle,<br/>
a moror-cycle or three, then on to cars...   My guess is that your son too<br/>
will eventually learnon his own...  to me it is a great example of natural<br/>
learning in action.<br/>
<br/>
As far a % goes... have you tried explaining that in $1 , 1% of it is 1cent,<br/>
and 2% of it is 2cents and so on.... so that each percent of a dollar is<br/>
represented by 1 cent.  I know my 7 y/o is still slow to grasp such concepts<br/>
though... and i am content to wait as I am sure that he will grasp them in<br/>
time and be much better off than limping along in the school system feeling<br/>
&quot;stupid&quot; because it is so hard for him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>100 penny pile  25 penny pile<br/>
200 penny pile 50 penny pile<br/>
<br/>
Then 1 pie  1/4 pie  25% of a pie<br/>
         2 pies 2/4 pie  25% of two pies<br/>
<br/>
1 hour  1/4 hour   15 minutes  25% of 1 hour (this depends on where he is<br/>
with time)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another way is to build a bar graph (or the old thermometer graph) with a<br/>
goal - the price of a toy he wants to buy, or amount you/he wants to save,<br/>
etc. = which is called 100% (1 unit); then plot your way over time.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve used all of these (and similar) to good effect.  The trick (for us)<br/>
was to steer clear of the arithmetic, which just gets in the way, and focus<br/>
on the concept:  100%=1 unit<br/>
