&lt;&lt; Right now, we&#39;re on a Time Travel kick: Time Machine (the new one); <br/>
<br/>
Back to the Future (the trilogy); probably Time Bandits (again); <br/>
<br/>
maybe the older version of Time Machine. Any other time travel movies <br/>
<br/>
out there? I know there&#39;s been Time Travel TV shows, but we don&#39;t get <br/>
<br/>
regular TV out here so that&#39;s out unless the series is on video <br/>
<br/>
somewhere. Where he stops crimes from happening, because he can read <br/>
<br/>
the news from the following day??? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about that show, but...<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of Twilight Zone episodes from the 60&#39;s about time travel. <br/>
 One about a camera, and one about a plane.  I&#39;ll try to look up the names <br/>
and bring them back.<br/>
<br/>
Black Adder Back and Forth.  If you or your kids have ever watched any of the <br/>
Black Adder series, there&#39;s a new one all about time travel.  It&#39;s set on New <br/>
Year&#39;s Eve of 1999, and involves the Romans in Britain, Robin Hood, <br/>
Shakespeare, Waterloo...  Fun!<br/>
<br/>
Bill & Ted&#39;s Excellent Adventure might be fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-187687386">It&#39;s about time someone posted the name &quot;Early Edition&quot;.  Great show, but I<br/>
wasn&#39;t going to post the name unless no one else had by the time that I<br/>
caught up.<br/>
<br/>
There was a fabulous show that started last fall.  DH found a review about<br/>
it and we couldn&#39;t wait for it.  &quot;That Was Then&quot; was on the air for two<br/>
shows only.  They even showed a preview for the next one and it never aired.<br/>
It was the story about a just turned 30 year old man who was not happy with<br/>
his life, he wished that he could go back to a pivotal point in his life<br/>
when he was in high school so that he could change it.  He went to sleep and<br/>
when he woke up, he was a teenager again.  As soon as he heard a certain<br/>
song, he was immediately transported to age 30 again, with a completely new<br/>
life.  Great show that I would have loved to have seen more of.  I taped the<br/>
first two and I will definitely watch them again some day.  You know what<br/>
they showed on television instead?  Reruns of &quot;America&#39;s Funniest Videos&quot;.<br/>
That&#39;s American culture for you.  I wish that I could get ahold of all the<br/>
episodes that they made of &quot;That Was Then&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Another show that was great for the first year that it was on was &quot;Sliders&quot;.<br/>
This was sort of a time warp traveling one through different possible<br/>
realities.  It got weird and horrorish after the first season.  I like<br/>
Science Fiction, not Horror.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-31588554">Wanted to spout off two more {and I hope I&#39;m not repeating} LO<br/>
 There is a TV show, The Secret Adventures of  Jules Verne <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.scifi.com/julesverne/">http://www.scifi.com/julesverne/</a><br/>
Up LATE {err early} at 5am est here.<br/>
<br/>
And I was also going to say Highlander would be another past/now <br/>
kinda thing. Course a lot of programs in Sci-Fi would fall in to that <br/>
line. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
