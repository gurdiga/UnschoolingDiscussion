&gt; and told for years that their ideas aren&#39;t worth much because they&#39;re just <br/>

   I&#39;m just wondering if you realize how you are beating people down and not <br/>
letting them express themselves if they don&#39;t wholly agree with you (even the <br/>
brand spanking new unschoolers who come her for help). FYI, unschooling is <br/>
not only done one way ... and another FYI, one can be a christian and an <br/>
unschooler. <br/>
  I&#39;m leaving this list because I&#39;m tired of Jesus bashing from you (and some <br/>
others), I haven&#39;t seen anyone bashing your religion (or lack of). AND <br/>
because this list is not conducive to supporting those trying to find their <br/>
way to unschooling. Someone mentioned changing the yahoo description, you <br/>
really should consider it, this is not a welcoming, supportive list!<br/>

<br/>
FYI for those of you who think some here are attacking you when you post <br/>
something, and are complaining about how Sandra and others post, this post is <br/>
an example of an attack. Telling someone how unschooling works, being <br/>
straight with someone about unschooling isn&#39;t an attack. Posting a reply that <br/>
specifically calls someone out and takes them to task is an attack. <br/>

<br/>
No, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m beating people down.   <br/>
That was a freudian-slip use of &quot;spanking,&quot; I&#39;m sure.... (Brand spanking now, <br/>
not SPANKING).<br/>
<br/>
Probably once a week or so I remind people to go to www.unschooling.com and <br/>
that if they finish reading that to go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling,">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling,</a> <br/>
which has links to Christian unschooling sites, and other religious sites.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;FYI, unschooling is not only done one way ... and another FYI, one can be a <br/>
christian and an <br/>
unschooler. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know that.  A couple of Christian sites list my site, and I list lots of <br/>
other sites on mine.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;AND <br/>
because this list is not conducive to supporting those trying to find their <br/>
way to unschooling. Someone mentioned changing the yahoo description, you <br/>
really should consider it, this is not a welcoming, supportive list!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you just came lately, it was a rough couple of weeks.  Lists, like <br/>
parties, picnics, days at the beach, are not homogenized same-at-any-moment <br/>
experiences, and can&#39;t be made that way.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I&#39;m leaving this list because I&#39;m tired of Jesus bashing from you (and <br/>
some others), &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure if you had taken time to let that post sit and edit it you would <br/>
have thought to differentiate between Jesus and Christian homeschoolers.  I&#39;m <br/>
unhappy with the intent and practices of &#39;the Christian homeschooling <br/>
movement&#39; which is not at ALL the same as Jesus bashing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I haven&#39;t seen anyone bashing your religion (or lack of). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t get around much then.  When you go to the Christian sites to avoid <br/>
the horrors you think you&#39;re finding here, you&#39;ll be assured that people like <br/>
me are going to burn in hell.  That might make you feel better.<br/>
