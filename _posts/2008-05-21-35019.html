March 7-8, 2009, Tempe, Arizona.<br/>
The conference isn&#39;t a hotel conference; most attendees are local,<br/>
and it&#39;s at a building on the Arizona State University campus.  So I<br/>
know this is a regional conference, but as an unschooling<br/>
announcement it&#39;s kinda cool.<br/>

together some interesting &quot;mix-n-match&quot; (as Sandra put it)  <br/>
combinations of Dodd and Sorooshian kids, too - all of them are really  <br/>
good at talking about unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yay!  I&#39;m so glad you and Pam will be returning, and I can&#39;t wait to<br/>
see your children in real life too.  The more Terry (my SO) and I<br/>
discuss unschooling, the stronger his commitment seems to become<br/>
(remember, our little one is only 2).  Terry still has apprehension<br/>
regarding the teen years, so I know he&#39;ll look forward to meeting your<br/>
children too.  I can&#39;t wait to tell him.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for saying yes! <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
By next March, there will be hardly any teens left in that batch of  <br/>
people.  Holly will be 17.  Rose will be 18, I think.  All other at  <br/>
least 20.  But with these unschoolers, honestly, when they&#39;re teens  <br/>
they&#39;re more mature than some adults, and when they&#39;re adults they&#39;re  <br/>
more in touch with themselves as kids and the feelings of other kids  <br/>
than most adults.<br/>
<br/>
MANY adults forget their childhoods, because of mental defense  <br/>
mechanisms.  So if school or home was stressful, their brains do them  <br/>
a protective favor and shut out the memories.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who lived peacefully remember more (and some people just  <br/>
remember a lot, and Holly Dodd remembers TOO much).<br/>
<br/>
I have lots of memories, but when I was 13 my mom left for a few  <br/>
months, and that time is like a confusing lump/blank.  She moved back  <br/>
and I got better.   The point of that is here will be six people who  <br/>
have been unschooled (Roya was in school a while young, and Holly has  <br/>
visited schools for half days and I think one whole day in England).<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, four of them have taken college classes; one has  <br/>
graduated from college.  That might be different by March.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve all had job.  Holly&#39;s have so far been babysitting and dog  <br/>
sitting, but she made (and saved!) enough real money to fly to Rhode  <br/>
Island and spend a bunch of money at her friend Quinn&#39;s favorite mall  <br/>
there.  By March, Holly might have &quot;a real job&quot; (you know,  <br/>
withholding tax and all).<br/>
<br/>
Roxana&#39;s been to France and visited other countries around there.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s been to England and visited France.<br/>
<br/>
Roya and Kirby have moved away from home.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a LOT of storytelling potential, and question-answering  <br/>
potential for nervous dads.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275860883">HENA is a small, but growing, conference and I don&#39;t believe they are  <br/>
taping any of the talks. But you can get MP3&#39;s of the Live and Learn  <br/>
Conference talks from past years. I&#39;d suggest that - there are so many  <br/>
wonderful talks from those conferences! The 2005 and 2006 conference  <br/>
recordings have Sandra&#39;s talks and the 2005 and 2007 recordings have  <br/>
some of mine. The 2005 recordings include my daughter, Roya, as well.   <br/>
And there are MANY other wonderful speakers included.<br/>

When a big kid hits a little kid on the playground, we call him a bully;<br/>
five years later he punches a woman for her wallet and is called a mugger;<br/>
later still, when he slugs a fellow worker who insults him, he is called a<br/>
troublemaker, but when he becomes a father and hits his tiresome,<br/>
disobedient or disrespectful child, we call him a disciplinarian. Why is<br/>
this rung on a ladder of interpersonal violence regarded so differently from<br/>
the rest? ~ Penelope Leach<br/>
 Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and<br/>
affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is<br/>
more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present. <br/>
<br/>
~ Jean Baptiste Lacordaire<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-42410685">Actually, this year we will be in the Memorial Union in REAL <br/>
Conference rooms. :)  We were supposed to be there last year, but <br/>
there was a fire and we rolled back to the classroom building rather <br/>
than cancel.<br/>
<br/>
The Memorial Union is MUCH closer to the hotel and the lower level <br/>
includes a bowling alley, pool tables and other fun stuff for the <br/>
teens to hang out in:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.asu.edu/studentaffairs/mu/sparkys_den.htm">http://www.asu.edu/studentaffairs/mu/sparkys_den.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
The conference will be on the second floor where we the whole south <br/>
side reserved, including an actual stage.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a good deal of dining within the MU and I will post <br/>
restaurant hours on our website once they establish them in the Fall <br/>
Semester:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.asu.edu/studentaffairs/mu/dining.htm">http://www.asu.edu/studentaffairs/mu/dining.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m researching speakers right now and I would appreciate any and <br/>
all feedback on who you love (or who you don&#39;t care for) and WHY!  <br/>
Whether you&#39;re coming or not, I really like to hear from people who <br/>
have seen speakers in person.  Contact info in the form of a website <br/>
is most welcome to allow us to learn about the person and contact <br/>
them.  If they&#39;re in Arizona, even better! :)  But we&#39;re open to <br/>
hearing about anyone you think is a great speaker or anyone you had <br/>
an issue with.  <br/>
<br/>
We are an open conference, but we lean heavily to unschooling.  You <br/>
can see our speakers from last year still listed at:<br/>
