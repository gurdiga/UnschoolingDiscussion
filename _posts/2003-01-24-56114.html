<div id="ygrps-yiv-220725595">From Mary <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Again I think it&#39;s possibly the wording that can give one the wrong<br/>
&gt; impression. First you call it a routine, which for me sounds like it&#39;s done<br/>
&gt; exactly the same way. That&#39;s what doesn&#39;t set well with me and for us here.<br/>
&gt; It just seems to strict and not open to change. Then you say it&#39;s a habit,<br/>
&gt; which sounds more like something we have just always done and do when we<br/>
&gt; feel like it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>THANK you! I get what&#39;s happening. In the circles I run in, the word<br/>
&quot;schedule&quot; is the word that throws people off. It sounds like the rigid,<br/>
inflexible thing that you are hearing when I say routine.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, when I&#39;ve shared at homeschool events before, I have talked<br/>
about routines being those things that we do daily, but that don&#39;t have a<br/>
fixed time or means.<br/>
<br/>
So for us, we routinely get up and eat breakfast before other things in the<br/>
day. That sometimes happens at 8:00 a.m. But many days it may be 10 before<br/>
everyone is up.<br/>
<br/>
We generally eat breakfast individually during that time period, but<br/>
occasionally we eat something together. We just about always eat lunch and<br/>
dinner together, but just last night, in fact, the kids and my dh got into a<br/>
long game of Star Craft on the computers, my dd was sick and in my bed<br/>
watching Band of Bros and her older brother was keeping her company. So my<br/>
little 6yodd helped me make trays of food for everyone and we distributed<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;routine&quot; or to use the word you prefer, &quot;habit&quot; is dinner together<br/>
because we all like it. The time changes nightly based on who will be home<br/>
when. But when there is something else more exciting, we aren&#39;t slaves to<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Charlotte Mason talks a lot about habits as rails that our lives run on to<br/>
help them function smoothly. The main contribution I was hoping to make to<br/>
this discussion of homes in chaos is that having a few &quot;habits&quot; that<br/>
everyone enjoys or at minimum agrees to (like putting shoes in our hall<br/>
closet when you come in, please) makes life just easier. Kids at least know<br/>
what they can do to help!<br/>
<br/>
(I find shoes strewn in front of the closet door every day, but I see them<br/>
making the attempt. I pick them up and toss them in. Or they trip over MY<br/>
shoes an toss mine in for me. But the habit is: shoes in hall closet.)<br/>
<br/>
Does this make more sense? I think I understand why I keep setting off alarm<br/>
bells. If you could see how we live, you would know in a heartbeat that we<br/>
do NOT keep a schedule with a bunch of unvarying requirements. But we have<br/>
family habits that help us live together in harmony.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again Mary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-586391649">Okay Julie, I like what you said in this post, but my question would be, how<br/>
do you instill the habits?  I have habits or routines that I have made for<br/>
myself (tied to be a flybaby, only thing that stuck was the morning<br/>
routine), but I don&#39;t think we have habits or routines as a family.  The<br/>
shoes are by the door, the kids just fling them off as they come in, and<br/>
don&#39;t pick them up or straighten them unless someone asks them to.  They are<br/>
suppose to be set on a rug that is there for that purpose.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well mine fling theirs in the general direction of the hall closet, <br/>
so I&#39;ll bet our front entries look a lot a like! :)<br/>
<br/>
I am grateful that they are in the general locale so that I can <br/>
easily pick them up before visitors arrive and toss them in a bin. I <br/>
would never use anything like a rug that required them to be <br/>
neatly ordered since I can&#39;t maintain neat. I can maintain tidy and <br/>
out of view. <br/>
<br/>
So I guess if your kids are tossing their shoes in the direction of <br/>
the rug for tha tpurpose, your kids do have the habit.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes will yell from the other room, &quot;Can someone throw <br/>
all the shoes in the holder?&quot; And someone often does. But I do it <br/>
the most. And I break the &quot;rule&quot; the most too since I often take off <br/>
my shoes in my office or under the kitchen table and forget to <br/>
move them. Dh is the one who finds them and returns them to <br/>
the closet. :)<br/>
<br/>
I guess it just depends on the family and since we haven&#39;t used <br/>
the &quot;let them discover they want to o it themselves&quot; mode, my <br/>
advice might not jibe totally. That&#39;s why I kept asking questions <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
I do like the help it is to me to know that everyone knows what <br/>
they can do to pick up or clean up. One of my friends had such a <br/>
messy home that her boys felt powerless to make a difference in <br/>
it and gave up. My goal has been to let the family know where <br/>
things go, how they can make the home tidy and what they can <br/>
do that makes an impact on how our home looks and feels.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make sense?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164360307">Yes, Julie, it does make sense.  I figured it out, I am shipping my children<br/>
to your house, maybe I &#39;ll come too, and once we have figured it out we will<br/>
come home again and try it out.  How long do you think it will take?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The reason for the rug for shoes is that we live in North Dakota.   There is<br/>
snow here all winter, and the shoes are wet when we come in.  If they place<br/>
them on rug, the snow melts there instead of on the linoleum!  Taking your<br/>
shoes off as you come in the house is definitely a ND custom (at least<br/>
around here).<br/>
<br/>
I am the one who breaks the rule here too, I leave mine on mostly.  It hurts<br/>
my leg too much to walk without shoes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me learn along with YOU!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-840408852">One thing I&#39;ve read suggested when things are ust *too* overwhelming to <br/>
deal with is to put down a hula hoop and just clean inside it. Another <br/>
is to set an alarm for 15 minutes and let everyone (who&#39;s participating) <br/>
do as much as they can in 15 minutes--perhaps with some energetic music.<br/>
