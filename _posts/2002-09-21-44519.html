<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749229154">Hello...my name is Bridget and I am really new to unschooling.  I am <br/>
a Christian Mother of 3 and am homeschooling my 5 yr. old son, <br/>
Camden. A friend just recently told me a little about unschooling and <br/>
it is a huge interest of mine now!!!  I also have an 18 month old <br/>
daughter, Zoe, and a 6 week old son, Aidan who keep me super <br/>
busy...so unschooling is even more of a breath of fresh air to me!<br/>

I would love to meet some Christian unschoolers to have as email <br/>
friends to get to know and have as part of my support system.  Any <br/>
information would be great!!!!  Thanks!  :-)  In Christ, Bridget</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-565379692">Hi there!!!  Thank you for responding to me!  How long have you been <br/>
unschooling???  This is all really new to me.  I am just starting <br/>
homeschooling this year...although I have known I wanted to do it since my 5 <br/>
yr. old was born.  I look back now on Camden&#39;s first 4 years...and what I was <br/>
doing THEN was unschooling...now...I have been working so hard to be by the <br/>
book...it just hasn&#39;t felt right.  Then a friend from my old church told me <br/>
all about unschooling recently.  I had never heard of the term before, but as <br/>
soon as she started to tell me about it...it just clicked!  I&#39;ve always loved <br/>
to be involved hands on with my kids...now I see how much of a stress <br/>
reliever it will be to relax a bit!!!<br/>
<br/>
What type of things do you do with your 5 yr. old as far as schooling??? I <br/>
could use any ideas!!!  My son loves to build with Legos, paint, jump on his <br/>
mini trampoline, climb up our doorframes like Spiderman..hehe.  He loves <br/>
reading the bible with us, reading period, helping with housework and <br/>
cooking, etc.  And of course, he loves to be outside!  So...when I just sat <br/>
back one week and decided to see what he did that I could list as <br/>
schooling...it was incredible!!  He had more ideas than I thought of through <br/>
the week...and they were HIS interests...and not me stopping his creative <br/>
play to come and do a workbook.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.....I could ramble forever...haha.  So...I will just tell you really <br/>
quickly about myself.  I am 33, my husbands name is Troy and he is a true <br/>
gift from God.  I told about my childrens ages in the note...we live in <br/>
Maine.  We attend a baptist church about 1/2 hour from our home!  My husband <br/>
really is feeling called to go to bible college...we are praying for God&#39;s <br/>
guidance with that...because it would be a huge change in our life!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Tell me more about you and your family!!!  Most of all...we just love the <br/>
Lord and He has been so awesome in our life!!!  Hope to hear from you again <br/>
soon!  <br/>
                                                             :-)  Bridget <br/>
