<br/>
&lt;&lt; What animals who bear teeth as a species are born<br/>
without their first set?  I cannot think of any. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cats.  Two litters of kittens have been born here and Holly is very <br/>
observant.  She said they don&#39;t get their teeth until after a few days.<br/>
<br/>
And so I looked on google.<br/>
<br/>
Lions:<br/>
<br/>
&quot; The cubs are born blind, after a few days the begin to see.  The cubs are <br/>
also born without teeth.  They get their baby teeth or milk teeth when they <br/>
are several weeks old.  &quot;     <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/sarmotilover/lions.htm">http://www.geocities.com/sarmotilover/lions.htm</a><br/>

<br/>
For shrews, I found this:  &quot;The infants are naked and blind at birth, but <br/>
mature rapidly.&quot;  I had thought maybe mice and kangaroos and others which are <br/>
born not quite &quot;done&quot; probably don&#39;t have teeth.<br/>

&quot;Just like you and me, the sperm whale is born without teeth.&quot;<br/>

&quot;Dolphins<br/>
... when referring to the sea mammal belonging to the Cetacean order and ... <br/>
inches in length.<br/>
They are born without teeth, not growing them for several ... &quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=- Milk-producing glands: All female mammals possess mammary glands that <br/>
secrete milk.  Newborn mammals, which are born without teeth, suckle this <br/>
milk. -=-<br/>

a for-school thing??)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-The shift from polyphyodonty to diphyodonty allowed only one replacement <br/>
of teeth in mammals per lifetime. These deciduous or milk teeth include <br/>
incisors, canines, and deciduous molars. When the animals are young the <br/>
deciduous molars perform the active chewing function. When the mammal has <br/>
matured, the new set of teeth includes permanent premolars and molars to <br/>
perform chewing (Strickberger 1995). <br/>
<br/>
-=-Young skulls grow so rapidly that a teeth replacement would be needed <br/>
almost immediately should the young be born with fully formed and functional <br/>
teeth. The need for a non-chewing food for the young arose. -=-<br/>
