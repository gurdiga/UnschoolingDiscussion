your analyzing too much. Just go with life and it  will all fall into  <br/>
place.-=-<br/>

The purpose of this list is to discuss what helps unschooling work  better.<br/>
Advising against analysis might be good for a teaparty list, but not for  <br/>

&quot;Just go with life&quot; is what most people do.<br/>

quite as simple as just going with life.  Some people just go with their  lives <br/>
and end up in prison.<br/>
