<div id="ygrps-yiv-106548211">I&#39;m 20 years old and currently attending Hampshire College in Amherst, MA.<br/>
While I like Hampshire, I&#39;m wondering if there might be a college that<br/>
better fits my unschooler, focus and take one subject at a time, approach.<br/>
At this point, I&#39;m interested in 3 types of schools. 1) &quot;Alternative&quot;<br/>
colleges. 2) Colleges that use the block system. 3) Unrelated to unschooling<br/>
but related to my life, good media/journalism schools (I&#39;m focusing on<br/>
magazine journalism and electronic media).<br/>
<br/>
If you could pass on any suggestions, it would be most appreciated. Taking a<br/>
leave from Hampshire, this fall I&#39;ll probably start getting serious about<br/>
College Search, Part II. In the mean time, I&#39;m interested in broadening my<br/>
search as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

college altogether and go out and start writing for a local newspaper now. <br/>
Or if you&#39;re into broadcast journalism, you might consider studying the<br/>
career of Peter Jennings.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my take on the college question:<br/>

in Washington State (Olympia I think), where you can more or less write your own<br/>
course of study, and<br/>
Colorado College, in Colorado Springs, which operates on the block system and<br/>
allows for a variety of courses of study with the student doing most of the<br/>
input as to what he or she needs and wants to pursue. Both excellent colleges.<br/>
Evergren is probably cheaper, as it is a state uni, while Colorado College is a<br/>
private school and extremely pricey.<br/>
