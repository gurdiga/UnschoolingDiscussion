<div id="ygrps-yiv-636791213">computers, computers... thoughts<br/>
<br/>
We are relatively new to the world of computers and world wiiiiiiide<br/>
web.  I noticed in my own first forays, which were in using the word<br/>
processor and a little networking, that my thought process was decidedly<br/>
different when I wrote on the computer than when I wrote with a pen.  My<br/>
fingers, although not rapid like a pro&#39;s are fairly fast because of<br/>
piano playing, so the words can actually slip out faster than what my<br/>
brain is accustomed to in my pen writing.  I found this both exciting<br/>
and disconcerting. I  noticed that sometimes it was just a little too<br/>
easy to type a lot of words without my usual contemplation, again which<br/>
could be either good or bad, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
I like words.  I started to think that perhaps the possibility of a glut<br/>
of meaningless words might actually obscure any truth there might be in<br/>
my communicating.  I&#39;ve  read some thoughtful writings from literary<br/>
figures who are wary of this same thing.  Many writers do their work in<br/>
long hand and then edit on the computer.  One well-respected and<br/>
seasoned fiction writer recently said that he could tell within the<br/>
first few paragraphs if a book was actually created on the computer or<br/>
written by hand, and has yet to be proven wrong.  He bemoans this new<br/>
ability we now have to spew out many words very fast, and the resulting<br/>
proliferation of not-very-well-written books.<br/>
     I have been thinking also about highschool teachers who only accept<br/>
assignments completed on computer word processing, graphics and other<br/>
programs.   When I heard about this and thought about it, I came to the<br/>
conclusion that I would probably do the opposite -- I would want to see<br/>
the physical manifestation, in all its awkwardness and/or flowing<br/>
beauty, of a student&#39;s thought process and creativity as written with a<br/>
pen or pencil, with drawings and lines on a piece of paper.  But maybe<br/>
I&#39;m just old ...<br/>
     Yes, computers are a part of this reality now, and they are a<br/>
powerful tool.  I am wondering, though, about creativity and all those<br/>
zillions of  little spaces and thoughts and ideas that don&#39;t fit into<br/>
the paradigm of one program of another.  I know my daughter can be<br/>
creative with MSPaint, and I&#39;ve had fun with it too, but the creativity<br/>
is within extremely limited parameters.  Is it okay for a child to type<br/>
e-mail messages and stories on the computer if she doesn&#39;t want to learn<br/>
to write with a pen?   I don&#39;t know.  I know that we have spent less<br/>
time smelling tempura, getting our hands all mucky with clay, smearing<br/>
oil pastels and making our creative picture letters for friends and<br/>
family.  So I worry that forms of communicating and thinking and working<br/>
through things that don&#39;t lend themselves to digital electronics may be<br/>
used less and less.  Not a good thought.  But reveals the need for a<br/>
balance.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I am trying to be careful about this world of computers, while<br/>
at the same time appreciating the access it has given me to information<br/>
and worlds I otherwise wouldn&#39;t know about, etc.   I am hoping that the<br/>
computer world will evolve through the input of the most brilliantly<br/>
creative minds around -- probably unschoolers, who value diversity,<br/>
autonomy, process, and all the rest ...<br/>
