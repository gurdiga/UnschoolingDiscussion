 </span></blockquote>Well if you truly want to be democratic:  Those who are interested in shouldering the responsibility ahould let it be known that they are interested.  They should preferrably be folks who know the list, know the list community and that post enough that we know them somewhat.<br/>
<br/>
Then...we VOTE!  We just have to devise the best system for voting.<br/>
<br/>
Also we may want to vote and put together a set of rules for the list.  I think they should be simple and brief, as few as possible to keep our goals.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-311337632">I&#39;m here finally!!  Due to viruses picked up over the last couple of months<br/>
I had to do the dreaded *wipe the hard drive* over last weekend.  I ended up<br/>
not being able to access my mailbox until late today.  :)<br/>
<br/>
As the listed *moderator* for the list it&#39;s my job to help folks<br/>
subscribe/unsubsribe. Every so often we have a case where the commands don&#39;t<br/>
work. I help make sure questions get answered and generally stay ouf of the<br/>
way.  :)<br/>
<br/>
As to moderate this list for on topic/off topic posts, we&#39;ve found that<br/>
doesn&#39;t work very well. By our very nature we tend to be folks interested in<br/>
a myraid of topics. I&#39;ve never seen a truly heated flame war on this list.<br/>
It could be that I&#39;ve been on the net so long that I remember the flame wars<br/>
we used to have and I haven&#39;t seen those in years.<br/>
<br/>
I still have 150 or so messages to read.  Once I read everything I might<br/>
have a better idea of what&#39;s up.<br/>

never think of &quot;editing&quot; people&#39;s posts by cutting and pasting, etc. I&#39;m<br/>
fairly new to the position, but the mamma who preceded me only had to step<br/>
forward twice during her reign. She just politely reminded people that their<br/>
conversations were getting heated and to either change tone or move off<br/>
list. She also did a great job at &quot;talking&quot; out both sides of the arguments<br/>
as to make sure they knew she wasn&#39;t being one sided. I&#39;m sure more lists<br/>
