I often need reminders like this to keep my patience and allow my dd to<br/>
bloom in her way and time.<br/>

We don&#39;t know how some of these people who were labeled dyslexia or some<br/>
other labeled thing they test for would fare if they had been left alone to<br/>
pursue what they are interested in, when they were interested. . . it seems<br/>
most of the  people we know labeled that way have not been involved in<br/>
interest led learning. For all we know, it could be the forced system that<br/>
led to their situation, in fact, I know of several people where this is the<br/>
case, my own brother being a prime example. Since he is an adult and is able<br/>
to pursue what his interests are, he has learned many things beyond my<br/>
capabilities (probably because I am not interested in them). But he had a<br/>
horrible time with &quot;school&quot; related material, and his self-esteem was<br/>
terrible. He is one of the happiest people I know now. . . he has really<br/>
soared since he got out of any educational system. I know my daughter would<br/>
have been labeled dyslexia, and I suspect my son would too, if we ever got<br/>
them tested. I know the signs, but I choose to allow them to develop<br/>
naturally, without intervention, or any of the ways in which they &quot;teach&quot;<br/>
people with dyslexia/ld to read. My daughter reads just fine now. She<br/>
occasionally still writes things backwards, but since most of her writing is<br/>
typed, it doesn&#39;t seem to hamper her at all.<br/>
