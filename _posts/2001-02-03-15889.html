<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389766051">As a new resident of California, I was significantly affected by this book by <br/>
Luis Alberto Urrea. It desribes the lifestyle of the poorest segment of the <br/>
population living just south of the border, peeking distance from San Diego. <br/>
Specifically it deals with the people who live near, and get their livelihood <br/>
from the garbage dumps there. Like all good reading, it gave me a lot to <br/>
ponder in terms of my place in the world. I&#39;m off to get his first book, <br/>
Across the Wire: Life and Hard Times on the Mexican Border. Just FYI.<br/>
