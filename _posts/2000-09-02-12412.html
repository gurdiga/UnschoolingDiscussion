Can you IMAGINE the repercussions if you ds had tried his &quot;experiment&quot; at<br/>
SCHOOL??????? Can you say &quot;large doses of Ritalin&quot;?? Thank heaven for<br/>
homeschooling. At four, he thinks well, just not quite far enough into the<br/>
future!! That will pass!!<br/>

&gt; Hi Susan,<br/>
&gt; I can really sympathize with you!  Last year my son did an &quot;experiment&quot;<br/>
&gt; where he (unknown to me) stuffed toilet paper in the bathroom sink drain<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; overflow hole, turned on the faucet full blast and closed the door.  Then<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; suggested we play outside.  I, again unknowingly, agreed and three hours<br/>
&gt; later returned.  Once I felt the squishy carpet (10 feet down the hall)<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; discovered the ocean of water streaming out of the bathroom down the<br/>
hallway<br/>
&gt; and into the heating ducts, I was a screaming zombie!!!!  The water ruined<br/>
&gt; the subflooring, carpet and pad (throughout 3/4 of the house), ductwork<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; swelled the doorjambs and drywall.  The damage was over 5 thousand<br/>
dollars.<br/>
&gt; Thankfully insurance picked up a good deal of the &quot;experiment&quot;.  I asked<br/>
him<br/>
&gt; later what he was trying to do...he said that he was trying to create an<br/>
&gt; ocean by closing the door.  Boy, at the time, school was sure looking<br/>
good.<br/>
&gt; And there are other days when I think school doesn&#39;t look all that bad.<br/>
But<br/>
&gt; I must admit, that it was pretty smart of him (at four) to have noticed<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; the water flows out better if you stuff it into the overflow hole!  But<br/>
&gt; seriously, I know that I would be having equally hard days (if not harder)<br/>
&gt; sending him off to school and all the issues that brings.  I so enjoy<br/>
seeing<br/>
&gt; him grow and learn (and experiment--within reason!) and I would not want<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; miss that for the world.<br/>
&gt;     I understand your frustrations.  It sounded like though that the day<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; going really well up until that point.  Hang on to the treasures of the<br/>
day.<br/>
&gt; We keep a short journal and write down tidbits of the day to reassure us<br/>
&gt; that we are on the right path.  Keep sharing your experiences with<br/>
us...that<br/>
&gt; helps too.<br/>
&gt; Take Care,<br/>
