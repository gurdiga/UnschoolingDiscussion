I&#39;ve written about out situation before.. basically its &quot;ditto&quot;   My son is <br/>
12. he&#39;s been resisting taking a shower, brushing his teeth and wearing socks ( <br/>
not wearing socks makes his feet STINK)  and changing clothes. since he was <br/>
about 10.5..    Now, I am paying him .25 every time he brushes his teeth.   I <br/>
have also paid him to take a shower.    Usually, I just end up &quot;making&quot; him  <br/>
take a shower and/or change clothes.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I try to be minimalist in my direction of my sons, but sometimes I believe <br/>
I have to step in and force the issue. Health and safety, which includes <br/>
personal hygiene, is one of those issues for me.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, sometimes it helps to have a homeschooling support group <br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
My elder son Zeke started stinkin&#39; about the time he turned 12, which was <br/>
also about the time he started getting really slack about changing clothes. <br/>
So one day we get in the car to go to our bi-weekly &quot;Park Day&quot; gathering of <br/>
local home-schoolers, and I comment that he should have showered or at <br/>
least changed his shirt. He just shrugged. That time I decided not to force <br/>
the issue and just drove to the park.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after we got there, Zeke was standing about 5 feet behind one of <br/>
the mothers, and that mom  suddenly said, without turning around, &quot;I can <br/>
tell you&#39;re there, Zeke, and I can&#39;t see you. Do you know why?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Uh, no, why?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Because I can SMELL you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ever since then, Zeke has always showered and put on a clean shirt before <br/>
going to Park Day, at least. Sometimes a comment from someone NOT the kid&#39;s <br/>
own parent can be powerful.<br/>

<br/>
first they smell themselves and get the response of another person or two <br/>
that they might want to take a shower, and THEN comes the desire to take at least <br/>
one shower a day if not two.  That&#39;s the way it was with my boys.<br/>
<br/>
IF the mother forces him to take a shower, then if he takes a shower he&#39;s <br/>
doing what his mom made him do, and he can have neither joy nor virtue.<br/>
<br/>
Weird as it seems, if you want it to be something he discovers is wonderful, <br/>
you have no choice than to suffer through some weeks or months of stinky-boy.<br/>

nearly 9 yr old, who has always been a rather particular fellow, is now<br/>
resisting showers.  A bath is more palatable for him, though.  When I get my<br/>
rear in gear to actually scrub the tub beforehand, it&#39;s a lot easier to get<br/>
him into the bath.  Somehow, that tub just never stays clean.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991595257">Nope, that&#39;s not it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       We have been extremely laissez-faire from the beginning and yet have <br/>
the same situation with our eight-year-old boy. I think it must be a guy thing <br/>
more than a schooling or unschooling thing.  <br/>
<br/>
       The funny part is that he&#39;s very sensitive to smell, so much so that <br/>
he&#39;ll only eat very bland foods and won&#39;t even be in the same room with us when <br/>
we&#39;re cooking anything that has a noticeable aroma, even a nice one. I have <br/>
read that physiologically, young children&#39;s keen sense of smell and taste makes <br/>
them less likely to appreciate spicy and strong-tasting foods (so it&#39;s not <br/>
just building familiarity but the actual aging process that makes us willing to <br/>
eat a wider variety of foods as adults.)<br/>
<br/>
       But his nose doesn&#39;t work when it comes to body odors or the fabric <br/>
they run off onto. I imagine it&#39;s more cultural than either of us realizes, why <br/>
I like food smells as naturally pleasing but avoid body odors, while he likes <br/>
natural body odors and finds food odors objectionable! :)<br/>
<br/>
       Maybe several of us could use some encouraging perspective from <br/>
unschooling moms whose sons USED to be like this and aren&#39;t anymore! JJ<br/>

before putting them in the wash.  I figure it saves me in laundry! Now, I do this <br/>
too, but I limit it to two wearings and let them air out on a hanger between <br/>
them!  I don&#39;t sleep in them!  lol  <br/>

It&#39;s kind of discouraging to hear that the problem only developed <br/>
with puberty for many of your sons. Must I brace myself for adding  <br/>
new teenage smells on top of all the indoor drips and drops, outdoor <br/>
dirt, and unchanged clothes of an eight-year-old? OTOH, could it be <br/>
too much worse? (Don&#39;t tell me!) &lt;g&gt;  JJ<br/>

a few years of that, he did a 180 and you could never get the kid *out* of<br/>
the shower.  Many years later, after I married, I watched my husband&#39;s much<br/>

<br/>
Kirby and Marty used to be like that and aren&#39;t anymore.<br/>
<br/>
They take a shower every day because they want to.<br/>
<br/>
There were times when I would just go in and open the windows in Kirby&#39;s room <br/>
and aim a fan out to vent the boy-smell, but I didn&#39;t do it hatefully, just <br/>
gently.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;d ask one of them to change his shirt if we were going somewhere, <br/>
and he would.  Sometimes I&#39;d say &quot;If you&#39;re going with [whoever], maybe you <br/>
should plan enough time to take a shower.&quot;   I didn&#39;t say &quot;If you don&#39;t take a <br/>
shower you can&#39;t go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The time came when they started smelling their friends.  And there were jokes <br/>
about the smell of the gaming shop (MANY teen boys, no windows), and at the <br/>
anime convention where Kirby goes, he spoke on a panel this year about how to <br/>
have the best experience at a con, and one of their points was take a shower. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s partly a boy thing, and partly a dweebish thing.  In my (limited, <br/>
as to boys) experience, jockish boys are more likely to take showers than <br/>
sedentary kinds of boys, but for while early in puberty they all seem to need them <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing worth thinking about is that it might be one of the triggers <br/>
for separation of mothers and sons.  We have a lot of other teenaged boys here, <br/>
and though sometimes I&#39;ve smelled the scent of one, they never stank, but my <br/>
own boys did (to me).   I&#39;ve talked to other moms about that too, and they&#39;d <br/>
not had any complaints about my boys, but thought their own boys needed a shower <br/>
QUICKLY.<br/>

Kelli do you have my son&#39;s twin? LOL Mine is 9 and it started this year. He<br/>
HATES to stop ANYTHING to shower or bathe but will reluctantly with lots of<br/>
reminding. I cannot even imagine feeling how he must feel being dirty but he<br/>
honestly doesn&#39;t seem to mind. The sleeping in the same clothes and<br/>
re-wearing clothes multiple times is playing on my patience and my sanity<br/>
LOL<br/>
I think it&#39;s plain disgusting (this comes from someone who LOVES baths!)<br/>
<br/>
LOL Apparently this is a boy thing? Do they ever outgrow it?!?!<br/>
LOL I sure hope so! I remember my brother taking showers for so long we<br/>
thought he drown in there. Then he&#39;d come out and smell SO good and look so<br/>
nice but then he was a few years older than my son - at least when I can<br/>
remember that happening.<br/>

Hi, JJ<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m basically in the same boat with you with my 9 year old.  I think <br/>
that perhaps one&#39;s nose becomes quickly accustomed to one&#39;s own odors, <br/>
so that a stink that others can smell is just unnoticeable to the boy <br/>
exuding it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to just be lighthearted and teasing about it, but I don&#39;t <br/>
want my son to have to hear from other kids that he smells bad.<br/>
<br/>
I will work on trying to keep the tub nicer.  (I bathe without my <br/>
glasses, so I notice a lot less than everyone else, regrettably.)<br/>

Another developmental thing is fears.  He&#39;s afraid of being in a room by <br/>
himself if there&#39;s not a light or a TV or music on.  He wants easy access to me or <br/>
dad, too.  Being in the shower or bathtub is creepy for him right now.  When <br/>
he does shower, he doesn&#39;t want me in the bathroom, but he wants me to be <br/>
right outside the door, in my room.  <br/>
<br/>
Ten was really hard on my other sons in the fear department.  They had deep <br/>
thoughts about death and dying and a higher power and had to talk about them <br/>
late at night.  I was just consoling a friend whose 10 yo won&#39;t spend the night <br/>
for Will&#39;s birthday because he&#39;s afraid.  He&#39;s never had this problem before.<br/>

Yeah,  Alec too,  he goes through phases.  Like when we were in Mexico he had to buy a necklace to wear and some types of pants he really likes.

  He does like to dress nice (&quot;cool&quot;), but could care less about stinking up <br/>
  the joint.  I know someday he&#39;s going to take 2 showers a day like his 19 year <br/>
  old brother did.  I just sometimes wish it was now.  lol.<br/>

  Wow,  this is interesting.  Maybe that&#39;s why Alec is sleeping in our room at night.  He just does not want to sleep by himself anymore.  His sister, who is 9,  just decided she wanted her own room and here we have her older bro who wants to sleep with Mom and Dad.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m OK with it, I know it won&#39;t last.  Its created a closeness between us too that&#39;s really cool.<br/>

shirt?  What if you were going to a family reunion, where lots of folks hadn&#39;t <br/>
seen your children in months, maybe years..  Perhaps a lot of the relatives did <br/>
not embrace homeschooling, let alone unschooling..  The kid has on a 4 day old <br/>
shirt, steeped in armpit odor, spaghetti stains, maybe some snot and of course <br/>
regular dirt.. The kid knows he is going to this shindig, he wants to go.. <br/>
enjoys seeing his cousins and the big dinner.. But, he don&#39;t want to change his <br/>
shirt?   This is a very specific question, but you could insert &quot;any formal <br/>
type setting&quot;  . or heck, even a casual night out for pizza and movies..  <br/>
Basically, anywhere in public, where folks would assume neglectful parenting if they <br/>
saw the way your kid was dressed/smelled.   <br/>
<br/>
  I know that I always gently suggest some &quot;hygiene&quot; .. several times.. <br/>
before I get to the insisting..   If the guys changed thier shirts with no <br/>
resistance, then we wouldn&#39;t be having this discussion.   You are lucky that your boys <br/>
changed/showered/cleaned up when you gently suggested it.  I don&#39;t think it <br/>
is the same as what some folks here are experiencing.. YES, most early <br/>
pubescent boys STINK!      And, yes, Im sure many of them need some gentle guidance <br/>
and reminders to shower and freshen up.. but we are talking about resisting <br/>
hygiene all together. If that were the case, what would you do?<br/>

now being fussy about what she wears. One of her friends told her she <br/>
was ugly and unfashionable so I now have to deal with daily meltdowns <br/>
about what she&#39;s going to put on when she used to throw on any old <br/>
thing. Money is tight yet she feels she has to have nice clothes to be <br/>
&#39;accepted&#39;. Grrrrr<br/>
Luckily my two boys are slobs, will wear anything until it has to be <br/>
peeled off them. They are 10 and 8 and so far have no detectable odour. <br/>
They don&#39;t object to baths as such, just the time the bath removes them <br/>
from in front of the computer!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I think it&#39;s plain disgusting (this comes from someone who LOVES baths!)<br/>
<br/>
LOL Apparently this is a boy thing? Do they ever outgrow it?!?! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Part of our culture&#39;s rejection of human instinct and denial that there ARE <br/>
&quot;natural&quot; ways for humans to be involves destroying the evidence.   <br/>
<br/>
Much of what makes nursing work well involves scent--the mothers smeling the <br/>
babies&#39; heads, the babies being in proximity of the mother&#39;s armpit.   Some of <br/>
sexuality involves scent.   So to avoid sexuality, our culture has relatively <br/>
lately insisted on daily washing with soap, followed by application of things <br/>
to prevent natural smell returning.   If men smell like storebought scents <br/>
and women  smell like powdered anti-perspirant, we can go on to judging people <br/>
by physical appearance instead of using any real clues we might get from <br/>
smelling whether they seem happy or afraid or aroused.<br/>
<br/>
So though we&#39;re all stuck in this culture, let&#39;s please not be so proud of <br/>
lending TOO much power to the anti-instinct, anti-nature forces that create <br/>
artificial differences between men and women and unnecessary artificial <br/>
differences between people and animals.<br/>
<br/>
How could strong scent in a teenaged boy be adaptive biologically?  <br/>
I do think it has to do with nest-leaving.   Easier to push a stinky boy away <br/>
than one who smells like milk.<br/>
It might also have to do with (if we were sleeping in a cave or near an open <br/>
campfire) alerting prowling animals that humans were there and they might not <br/>
want to mess with them because they fight back pretty efficiently if they have <br/>
sticks and rocks.<br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong, but if I didn&#39;t think I had a good chance of being right, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t write it and hit &quot;send.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth thinking about.<br/>

<br/>
Both Holly and Marty went through phases of wanting to take a long bath with <br/>
music on in the room.  We&#39;d put a boom box over the sink and find a long tape <br/>
and if I heard it end I would turn it over if they weren&#39;t ready to get out.   <br/>
That&#39;s good for kids who are restless/hyper and like to do two things at <br/>
once.  With cool enough tub toys, they get three things at once.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best tub toys we&#39;ve found is ice.  Regular ice cubes are okay, but <br/>
ice frozen into molds (metal fish molds are easy to find--people hang them on <br/>
the wall and they&#39;re in thrift stores; we&#39;ve used plastic toy boat hulls to <br/>
make ice boats; bundt pans make ring-ice) floats, melts interestingly, and <br/>
doesn&#39;t make a mess in the tub.  You don&#39;t have to put it away later.<br/>

less.<br/>
<br/>
Clothes stink before people stink.  Men who work barechested in the sun don&#39;t <br/>
stink as much as those who wet a T-shirt with sweat.  Then the t-shirt really <br/>
stinks.   <br/>
<br/>
Perspiration is natural and (at least in the desert) functional.  But there&#39;s <br/>
salt and other waste-stuff in there that are not good for the material if <br/>
they dry and then are stirred up again.  Wool can handle not being washed, but <br/>
cotton not so well.  And polyester stinks some even without people-smells on it. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
I think pants can be worn more than once, but shirts shouldn&#39;t be, nor bras, <br/>
nor panties.   I would encourage a girl to wash clothes that were next to any <br/>
scent-producing body parts.   I would not complain about washing them for her.<br/>

This comment brought back memories. I used to date a guy who went deer <br/>
hunting every fall. I learned from him that hunters never wash thier camo <br/>
outfits and avoid showering several days before opening day. Apparently the <br/>
deer can smell laundry products and soaps and shampoos from much farther <br/>
away than natural human body odors. <br/>
<br/>
You may be right about strong body odors, though. I&#39;ve heard anecdotal <br/>
reports of human urine applied to, say, the higher parts of landscaping plants <br/>
acting as a deterent to browsing animals by suggesting that a large predatory <br/>
mammal may be nearby.<br/>
