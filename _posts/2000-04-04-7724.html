hi,
<p>i <u>completely</u> agree with what carol said.&nbsp; imo the first
thing you need to do is find your &#39;comfort zone&#39;.&nbsp;&nbsp; this is often
the hardest part of unschooling because so many people have strong and
highly judgmental opinions against trusting children but before you can
trust your kids you must trust yourself or perhaps it&#39;s while you learn
to trust them you learn to trust yourself:)&nbsp; either way it&#39;s a process
done side by side and with mutual respect.&nbsp; something i just read,
in the miquon teacher&#39;s notes,&nbsp; she said something to the effect that
you need to be your own first student, for me this is sage advise.
<p>in regards to gaps in knowledge, holt said in <u>teach your own</u>
: &#39;you don&#39;t have to have every resource for your children, and if you
did, they wouldn&#39;t have enough time to make use of all of them.&#39;&nbsp;
imo, the point isn&#39;t to fill kids with knowledge but to help them stretch
and learn to think not memorize or &#39;perform&#39; (one of the problems with
standardized test).&nbsp; so it&#39;s more about helping children develop their
own ability to recognize what they need to learn and how to go about acquiring
that knowledge.&nbsp; it&#39;s this skill that will help them the most in their
adult life.

That does help some.&nbsp; I&#39;m finding that the one thing that seems consistant

they let the child lead.&nbsp; The amount of direct parental involvement
seems to stem from what individual children need or want.</font> <font size="-1">I
can see how this would work.&nbsp; I worry about gaps though, even though

unschooling with the eclectic approach??&nbsp; (sigh).</font> <font size="-1">Kristen</font></blockquote>

Hi Colette, It sounds like you made a very good decision to get your son out <br/>
of that school.  It is ashame that some (many) teachers are only there to go <br/>
through the routine, and receive a paycheck; sad but true.                      <br/>
                                                                A typical <br/>
unschooling day is different for each family-- no two are really alike.  In <br/>
my home, my kids are very young-- my oldest will be 6 in Sept.  I have one <br/>
that will be 4 in Nov and a 10 mo old, too.  We play a lot of games, and read <br/>
books mostly right now.  My kids have a lot of outdoor play, we are raising <br/>
tadpoles, have a goldfish pond, and an indoor aquarium.I try to be an <br/>
encourager when it comes to learning a specific skill, but sometimes I find I <br/>
push a little, too.    That&#39;s ok, because sometimes a little push is needed.  <br/>
:)  We are beginning to participate in our local homeschooling events, such <br/>
as in the annual science and art fair.  My kids are enjoying learning on the <br/>
computer, too.  We do not have a rigid scheduled  day, and usually don&#39;t <br/>
pursue educ. activities until late morning or early after lunch, because <br/>
mornings are not conducive to those kinds of things at this time in our <br/>
lives.  If we are having an off day, we may not do much that seems actively <br/>
educational.  Some days are very busy, and some days are less busy, but it <br/>
all balances out.   We do not have to turn in lesson plans to anyone  here in <br/>
Ind.  The laws are lenient and easy going here.  Tell your questioners that <br/>
homeschooling is legal in all states in the USA.  Have a great Sat., too.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s different for each family.  That&#39;s the good news and the bad!  You get <br/>
to figure it out for yourself but you have to figure it out for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t use a lesson plan but I did a lot of checking when we started to see <br/>
what my kids would have been doing in school.  The state dept of ed has a <br/>
listing called Sunshine Standards on line.  Don&#39;t know what it would be by <br/>
you-- each state does it a little different -- but a lot do seem to have some <br/>
sort of on line info.  And the &quot;What Your X Grader Should Know&quot; series is <br/>
helpful to a lot of people too.  At least these and other organized <br/>
approaches can get you past that first nervous stage of what to do first.<br/>
<br/>
Then it all starts to flow, I think.  We&#39;ve only been at this for about 1 1/2 <br/>
years and I love it and just make it up as we go along.  The kids are doing <br/>
so well that we are just going to keep on doing what we like to do.<br/>
<br/>
Which includes but is not limited to:  outside classes for Tae Kwon Do, piano <br/>
and dance, online math class, lots of CDs and internet computer time, lots of <br/>
trips to the library, a weekly science experiment that we get online, <br/>
suggestions from Gramma (very supportive now that she has started <br/>
volunteering in a local ps 1st grade class!), etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I am also constantly checking to see if something better has come along in <br/>
our area.  No harm in checking, I say.  So far, nothing has.  The latest was <br/>
a charter school but they don&#39;t seem to be really ready for any sort of <br/>
part-time hs/ps arrangement and that&#39;s what we would want to do, if at all.<br/>
<br/>
So, no, I don&#39;t have the option of classes at the local ps.  Some people are <br/>
opposed to this sort of arrangement all together.  I fall into the &quot;whatever <br/>
works&quot; category and just wish I even had the choice at this point but don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Do you have to hand in a <br/>
 letter of intent thru your school district or have you just done this on <br/>
your <br/>
 own?  I have been asked by several people.......&quot;Can&#39;t you be thrown in jail <br/>
 for educating your child at home?&quot;   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We live in Florida so, yes, we have to send in a letter of intent when we <br/>
start hsing.  Then annual evaluations (testing or portfiolio review) after <br/>
that.  And we have to keep a log and portfolio (nothing too formal tho if you <br/>
don&#39;t want to) as we go along.<br/>
<br/>
But these things differ greatly from state to state.  You might want to check <br/>
the state law for your state at:<br/>
<br/>
www.nhen.org<br/>
<br/>
This is a relatively new online hsers networking organization.  They have <br/>
lots of good info.  A page of info for new hsers, for instance.  And they are <br/>
working on putting up more.<br/>
<br/>
And there are lots of other resources on line and in the library to give you <br/>
tips and project and curriculum -- probably too much!!<br/>
<br/>
And, altho this is not the case in many areas, our local school board was <br/>
actually helpful in getting us the info about the regulations and what to <br/>
file.  So you could check there if that&#39;s comfortable.  But it didn&#39;t sound <br/>
like you have a great school situation so maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you can get everything you want and more if you just have lots and <br/>
lots of time to read.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and there are local hsing groups in a lot of areas.  The one near us did <br/>
not fit our family (we are not Christians and they are) but you may find one <br/>
near you that can get you headed in the right direction.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with everything!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>WA state law requires a declaration of intent to homeschool.  It is not <br/>
permission, but tells the school district you will be educating at home.  You <br/>
do not need to worry about it at all before age 8.  <br/>
<br/>
There are testing/evaluation requirements.  They are kept by the parents and <br/>
are not turned over to the school district.  The theory is that if/when the <br/>
child enters public school they will need to know how the child is doing.  <br/>
IMO it&#39;s hogwash because the school has the &#39;option&#39; of re-testing the child <br/>
and will ultimately end up placing the child in the grade the school feels is <br/>
appropriate with our without the tests.  So, don&#39;t let that throw you.  <br/>
Assessments can be done or tests can be taken.  (or ignored, if you&#39;re so <br/>
inclined)<br/>
<br/>
A teaching parent is supposed to take a &#39;how to homeschool&#39; class or have a <br/>
certain amount of college in order to teach at home.  Or a certificated <br/>
teacher can oversee the education.  I don&#39;t worry about it because DH and I <br/>
both have sufficient college hours to check that box.<br/>
<br/>
Those are the basics...for more details on specific laws go to  &lt;A <br/>
HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org/&quot;">http://www.nhen.org/&quot;</a>&gt;Click here: Welcome To the National Home <br/>
Education Network&lt;/A&gt;  (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org/)">http://www.nhen.org/)</a>  Go to the legslative/legal <br/>
page and it lists resources for all states.  They work hard to be accurate. <br/>
<br/>
FWIW, many people never &#39;bother&#39; filling out letters of intent for various <br/>
reasons ranging from &#39;it&#39;s not the gov&#39;t&#39;s business&#39; to &#39;I never get around <br/>
to it&#39;.  There is potential for truancy issues which can bring a fine of <br/>
$25/day.  It is potential and generally not a real threat, at this point.  <br/>
Obviously you&#39;ll have to decide how you feel about it for your family.  I <br/>
only want to point it out so you know it&#39;s out there.  Again, no worry before <br/>
age 8!<br/>
<br/>
As for typical day.  In our home there is no such thing.  I find I like it <br/>
that way.  I have FMS, which often leaves me in pain, exhausted and weak.  On <br/>
those days we don&#39;t &#39;do&#39; much.  On good days we &#39;do&#39; more.  I have had times <br/>
of feeling really guilty because I worried we weren&#39;t covering the basics <br/>
well enough (read not enough textbook or work book work for math or <br/>
spelling).  I&#39;m learning that we can&#39;t help but cover that material in our <br/>
day to day living!  Seemingly out of the blue DS will come and tell me all <br/>
about how multiplication works or some other discovery he&#39;s just made on his <br/>
own.   At that point, I ask questions to help me understand what he&#39;s sharing <br/>
and check to see if he&#39;s on the right track...also to figure out how in the <br/>
world that subject even came up!  LOL  Then I can <br/>
direct/correct/share/support as needed while he figures it out.  It amazes me <br/>
what he comes up with.<br/>
<br/>
DS (11 yr old) reads a LOT.  Our family loves to read.  Somebody is always <br/>
starting or finishing a book around here.  We read out loud to each other and <br/>
silently.  In fact, one of the benefits of my FMS is that on bad days I have <br/>
DS read to me.  Gives us a great chance for quality time together, I can help <br/>
him out with his pronunciation and understanding of &#39;big&#39; words.  He tends to <br/>
read at early adult/college level novels.  Doesn&#39;t want to waste his time on <br/>
kid&#39;s stuff...with the exception of Harry Potter!  (But I read that too.  <br/>
Love those books.)  <br/>
<br/>
Having him read to me is relaxing to me and gives us a great opportunity to <br/>
discuss what&#39;s happening in the book he&#39;s reading, share thoughts on the <br/>
world at large, whatever.  Again, it amazes me the topics we cover on a <br/>
&#39;typical&#39; reading session!  (one of the best benefits is I KNOW where he is <br/>
and what he&#39;s doing, while I am relaxing.  The more relaxed I am, the more <br/>
likely to gain enough energy to accomplish something else.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned to not worry about it if he doesn&#39;t understand the book the <br/>
first time he wades through it...he&#39;ll pick the same book up later and read <br/>
it again with greater understanding.  He&#39;s on his 3rd time through the <br/>
Tolkien series.  Each time brings new insights and better understanding.<br/>
<br/>
The way I see it is if he can read well and understand what he&#39;s reading, he <br/>
can find a resource somewhere to learn anything he wants at any time.  We <br/>
encourage and recognize all manner of learning, but it was/is important to me <br/>
to help him gain reading skills.  I read somewhere that if a child does <br/>
nothing more than read a lot, he will gain a great deal of knowledge.  I&#39;m <br/>
learning that is true for our family.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You should find out who your local support groups are, they can help you with <br/>
whatever registration is required in your state/district.  They can also help <br/>
with unschooling focus groups, field trips, and other things that will assist <br/>
in your homeschooling adventure.  There are many web sites to find support <br/>
groups through.  Back when I started, I found my local and state group <br/>
through <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeschoolzone.com">http://www.homeschoolzone.com</a>  <br/>
<br/>
As for curriculums, we do not use any.  I just keep my ears open and listen <br/>
to what it is my son might be interested in learning, then we pursue that.  <br/>
We also read alot!  Right now we are working on a Harry Potter book (one <br/>
chapter a night).  I also keep a small palmcorder (very small hand held tape <br/>
recorder) so that when my son has a &quot;great idea&quot; or expresses some interest <br/>
in something, I can remember it, and persue it later.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334507217">Hi!  I am new to the list, my name is Amy, and I am the proud mom of one son. <br/>
 My ds is 7 1/2 yo, and we are unschoolers.  I also run an award winning <br/>
In-Home Daycare for children, lead a 4-H group, and have started a local <br/>
homeschooling support group.  Of course, I could not do all of this without <br/>
the support of my wonderful hubby, he is the best.  My son is an Active/Alert <br/>
child, which is sort of a combination of traits from ADD, ADHD, and ODD.  <br/>
These children are very bright, but will defy you to the ends of the earth.  <br/>
Essentially their main problem is that they have hyper-sensitive sensory <br/>
perceptions, and therefore feel overwhelmed most of the time.  This in turn <br/>
creates a fearful child, who tries to control this fear by controlling <br/>
his/her environment (clear as mud?)  Anyway, I really look forward to <br/>
exchanging ideas and stories with all of you.  <br/>
<br/>
I do have one request:  If any of you have been involved in a custody issue <br/>
with an ex-spouse (that involved homeschooling), and if you don&#39;t mind <br/>
sharing your story with other homeschoolers, would you please email me <br/>
privately?  Thanks so much.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-801342872">Amy, this sounds like my child!!!  V sensitive hearing and smell, v <br/>
high empathy, quiet fearful, quite controlling... This was a major <br/>
reason for me to not want to send ehr to school, I didn&#39;t think <br/>
she&#39;d be understood and empathised with.  I try my best to <br/>
empathise with her, maybe I was similar and have a problem <br/>
because of how I was treated.  Hmm.  I&#39;m not keen on labelling <br/>
children, (or anyone, for that matter...) but I might have a look for <br/>
that book.<br/>

I know some people really do not care for &quot;labeling&quot;, and I can completely <br/>
understand that.  I do however recommend the book, as it has some great tips <br/>
on how to help your child learn and mature.  If you would like to join an <br/>
Active/Alert list, we have started one at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.egroups/group/ActiveAlertChildren.">http://www.egroups/group/ActiveAlertChildren.</a>  There was so little <br/>
information and materials for families of children with this personality <br/>
type, that I thought it would be a good idea to give us a place to share our <br/>
up and down days, stories, tips and ideas.  <br/>
<br/>

    (and I) had with his 3rd grade teacher was.......she enjoyed the students 
    that she didn&#39;t really have to teach but the ones that needed help were a 
    burden to her and she didn&#39;t want to take the time out for them.&nbsp; 
    Travis and a couple other children were not up to par in her opinion and she 
    just didn&#39;t want to spend the extra time with any of them.&nbsp; Travis did 
    go into the the extended help program which he liked but anything to do with 
    his teacher, forget it.&nbsp; I tried talking to her about how I felt 
    towards him being taught but it feel on deaf ears.&nbsp; Travis is a child 
    that likes (maybe needs) to learn thru experience.&nbsp; Being taught at, 
    doesn&#39;t seem to work for him.&nbsp; I was the same way.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
    teacher was all concerned that his reading level wasn&#39;t up to what all the 
    others were, etc. and I told her that I wasn&#39;t really too concerned about 
    that since everyone learns at their own rate but once again, 
    nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I finally just got tired of it and decided to 
    teach at home.&nbsp; His reading level is fine.&nbsp; He does get flustered 
    when aske to read outloud which goes along with being extremely 
    shy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that he can use an extra push with spelling and 
    writing too but that&#39;ll come all in due time as well.&nbsp;

    <div><font face="Arial"><tt>For us the kids, 3.5yog and 5.5yob, play outside 
    half the day. They watch Blues Clues any time they want. They also have some 
    Thomas the Train tapes they watch anytime they want. We are currently 
    learning about space and the solar system. I found a 2 min movie on the net 
    that I downloaded about the sun that they like to watch over and over on the 
    comp. Although they can watch the videos anytime most of their time is spent 
    playing games like dominos, puzzles, and just made up games of their own. 
    They keep themselves and me pretty busy. I make sure that they help pick up 
    the house with me. This is usually stuff they got out but we work in the 
    same room together. They feed and water their dogs and cat, climb trees and 
    explore the woods on our lot. They also like to help me cook. Sometimes they 
    will say, &quot;Mom, lets make a cake.&quot;&nbsp; About two weeks ago they got the 
    food coloring out and suggested a cake. We made a yellow cake, from scratch, 
    and divided the batter into four bowls. Then we added the color and took 
    turns mixing all the bowls. We sworled the colors together when we put the 
    batter in the pans and made it a two layer cake. The icing we used was 
    black, but had been lighted by other colors (I always put my left over icing 
    in a container in the fridge for fun cooking times) It was a beautiful 
    purplish&nbsp;pinkish lavenderish and looked gorgious next to the colors of 
    the cake, red, blue, green and yellow, when we cut it.</tt></font></div>
