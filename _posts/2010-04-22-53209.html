<br/>
Also there have been e-mails and phone calls and interviews and lots  <br/>
of online discussion because of the news reports this week on  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s okay, but on the weekend someone wanted me to change one of my  <br/>
pages and the archives of another list because of something she wrote  <br/>
five years ago.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s okay, but my half brother called twice on Sunday.  He&#39;s in his  <br/>
late 30&#39;s and was born when I was 19, to my drunken mother and one of  <br/>
her drunken friends from the bar.  After he saw that the baby was  <br/>
white, he married her.  There was another friend of hers willing to  <br/>
marry her if the baby wasn&#39;t quite so white.   That&#39;s been a long  <br/>
time, there&#39;s fetal alcohol syndrome, there was abuse, I knew, but I  <br/>
learned Sunday that some of it was on my watch, by an older child (10  <br/>
to his 4) and I didn&#39;t know and another adult DID know and said &quot;Don&#39;t  <br/>
tell Sandra.&quot;  Thirty five years was long time for me not to have  <br/>
known that.   (Add it to the &quot;don&#39;t tattle&quot; pile.)  And he has been  <br/>
sober a year.  Usually people get congratulated for that.  I called my  <br/>
sister to see if it was true (she visited him in November), because I  <br/>
don&#39;t trust him.<br/>
<br/>
That was very sad altogether and I feel bad, but I decided when I was  <br/>
35 and Kirby was two that I had had enough of alcoholic disruption in  <br/>
my life and I was done.  I had rescued and enabled and avoided and  <br/>
aided and abetted.<br/>
<br/>
Then there were the problems with and around the Always Learning  <br/>
list.   (Thank you, Heather, for coming back to the list.)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s general crap and nonsense around on the internet just to keep  <br/>
the irritation at simmer (another page of mine swiped whole, with some  <br/>
other links added; more minor plagiarism here and there).<br/>
<br/>
And now some dork posted an insult to Holly.  But I left it, and I&#39;m  <br/>
not sure why or whether I should have.   It seems better to correct  <br/>
the misconception and call a dork a dork.   Still, I&#39;m kinda tired,  <br/>
and  I have a LONG list of questions to answer for someone from Warner  <br/>
Brothers who interviewed me this afternoon.  It&#39;s as long as an  <br/>
article and it&#39;s been a long day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465918887">I&#39;m really really sorry that you get these rough weeks or days or  <br/>
moments, because I never want you to have them. You&#39;ve made my life  <br/>
better by sharing all that you have, and I&#39;m really thankful for that.<br/>
<br/>
Two or three or more times a week, I click a random page to sweeten  <br/>
my life and improve my ability to unschool Addi and Luke.  http:// <br/>
sandradodd.com/random<br/>
<br/>
When I got to visit with you and sit next to you while you worked, I  <br/>
saw all the time and energy and thought that you&#39;ve put into this  <br/>
list and your site to make it available to people for a long time to  <br/>
come.  I saw the struggle you went through when people were grouching  <br/>
at your honesty and forthrightness and helpfulness.  I wanted to  <br/>
shake a few of them.<br/>
<br/>
Ten years ago when I started reading this Sandra Dodd person on the  <br/>
old unschooling.com message board, I was thrilled, and it felt like a  <br/>
breath of fresh air, these ideas you were writing about and your  <br/>
thoughts.  I still get giddy about it.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, Addi sort of had this epiphany that she was really really  <br/>
lucky to have me as a mom.  I mean she really got it that she is  <br/>
being parented differently than most of the people she knows.  We  <br/>
chatted about what you and others write about here and how that has  <br/>
really helped me be a better, thoughtful mom.  She notices how  <br/>
parents treat their kids, and admires you and Pam S, and others.<br/>
<br/>
I saw some pictures of Luke on the SUSS (Sandra&#39;s Unschooling  <br/>
Symposium in Santa Fe (Jan 2010)) blog, and he looks really good, and  <br/>
happy with Roya, and Kirby, and had so much fun that day.  Luke  <br/>
really enjoyed Holly and listening to the conversations we had when  <br/>
you were here.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for all your work and perseverance , and I&#39;m really  <br/>
sorry that your work and willingness to share so much has brought any  <br/>
frustration to you at all.<br/>
<br/>
~Jill (Addi 15, Luke 11)<br/>

That was a really great gathering.  I&#39;ve been thinking of doing some  <br/>

Jill worded that so nicely; I wholeheartedly second what she said.<br/>
<br/>
Shame on someone for attacking Holly, and erroneously and anonymously at that. That&#39;s wrong and uncalled for.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully all the hoopla resulting from the GMA piece will settle down soon; surely some other controversial topic will come up quick enough that will draw the fire of folks who know nothing about the topic but feel compelled to declare it wrong.<br/>

I&#39;m awake at 3:00 in the morning because the wind was blowing really  <br/>
hard.  Now thunder and rain.  And I wasn&#39;t sleeping so well anyway.   <br/>
It was hot, and I was thinking.  And trying not to think.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t worried about the effect on Holly.  She knows she can read.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  I guess I&#39;m worried about the lack of integrity of seeming to  <br/>

but I wanted to cover that over or... I don&#39;t know.  I get tired of  <br/>

I&#39;m going to save the comment elsewhere, but was thinking about why  <br/>
someone would need glasses without being able to read.<br/>
<br/>
Friends of ours had a baby born too early. He wasn&#39;t blind, but he did  <br/>
need glasses very young. I suppose he wore glasses for four years  <br/>
before he could read, but they were just thrilled that he could walk  <br/>
and see! He&#39;s fine now, but without those glasses he wouldn&#39;t have  <br/>
been able to read facial expressions or play with toys very well. He  <br/>
would have run into things and hurt himself.<br/>
<br/>
Some people wear glasses to sew, and do woodcarving. Those aren&#39;t  <br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the thought that the written word is the only thing worth seeing  <br/>
ties in with book worship.<br/>

Holly is strong and whole. Yesterday&#39;s &quot;anonymous&quot; has some issues (in  <br/>
addition to cowardice).<br/>

I am so sorry to hear about your rough week.<br/>
You are such an inspiration for so many. Helping us fill our &quot;tool boxes&quot; with so many wonderful unschooling/parenting/life tools that we need (at least I do). <br/>
I&#39;m grateful for you to share your rough spots because it reminds me we are all human and we all hit these spots. Life is life and some times it hurts.<br/>
You are holding a much needed spot in our unschooling community and for that I am grateful. <br/>
Thank you for sharing you with me/us!<br/>
Oh, I loved Holly&#39;s reply to the goof-ball who posted. She is an amazingly, secure person. Bravo Holly!! :)<br/>

YOu are amazing. Your kids are amazing.<br/>
Pam and many others are amazing.<br/>
I am impressed that Heather send that apology not only to you, Pam and the list but she did<br/>
post there  about it too.<br/>
Very brave.<br/>
There has been a person that tried defending this list there. She was very well spoken and made sense but there is very little comom sense to the stuff they write there.<br/>
  In the mean time I am taking this list advice completely and being even more with my kids doing stuff and just being with them.<br/>
Thank you all for so mush learning I do everyday just by reading when I get a chance.<br/>
As for Holly and what that person posted , you got to be kidding me right? How elementary school was that? No wonder we do not send our kids to school!<br/>

I love those little pat answers that unschooling kids come up with.  They are so factual and succinct in what they say about what they see and know in the world!<br/>
<br/>
The woman who had written that horrible piece on the GMA segment had written something about unschooling teenagers not knowing right from wrong because they&#39;ve never had to deal with consequences.  I&#39;m paraphrasing because I don&#39;t want to find the link right now.  Chamille heard that one bit and her mind went immediately to a very concrete way in which that isn&#39;t true while crossing the street when the sign said &quot;don&#39;t walk&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
She didn&#39;t even have to think very hard or long to come up with just ONE of many ways that comment isn&#39;t true!<br/>
<br/>
Chamille wore glasses to read and so that her eyes wouldn&#39;t work so hard adjusting from near to far.  She outgrew the need for glasses which, the first eye dr said she might do as the muscle in her one eye grew and caught up with her body.  Technically, Chamille needed her glasses to learn how to read and now that she can read, she doesn&#39;t need them anymore, but that was a coincidence!<br/>

I am sorry your world contains so much tension right now.  It must be<br/>
difficult to be doing something positive...you aren&#39;t actively on<br/>
pro-school, pro-discipline sites posting lies or insults to have some of<br/>
those people do that because clearly their ideas cannot stand if yours do,<br/>
in their minds.  Its funny because you keep saying you aren&#39;t running a<br/>
cult--people either want to unschool or they don&#39;t.  You tell people it is<br/>
hard, but rewarding.  You have generously commented that it isn&#39;t a contest<br/>
and doesn&#39;t mean someone doesn&#39;t love their child if they don&#39;t unschool, so<br/>
it is odd that people would try to find fault with any of your kids.<br/>
<br/>
I am also realizing if someone wants to unschool they ask &quot;how can I&quot;, if<br/>
they don&#39;t they seem to ask &quot;why should I&quot; or worse &quot;why did you do that,<br/>
because x disproves your experience, therefore your experience can&#39;t be<br/>
emulated&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It is very frustrating work you do, and I am impressed you keep slogging<br/>
away, sharing your life.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sorry this is happening.  That nonsense about Holly and plagiarism  <br/>
of your website - that kind of thing seems to go in cycles, doesn&#39;t  <br/>
it? It sucks. I want to call someone out.<br/>
<br/>
To learn what happened to your half brother and that someone said  <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t tell Sandra&quot; (because you would have done something about it)  <br/>
must really be difficult. It does speak to the person you are, though,  <br/>
that if you&#39;d known, you would&#39;ve taken action and people knew it.<br/>
<br/>
I, like Jill, read ideas of yours that I&#39;d never heard from all the  <br/>
people I knew who claimed to be unschoolers (I didn&#39;t know they  <br/>
weren&#39;t at the time). Something about your site and what you wrote on  <br/>
unschooling.dotcom, then unschoolingdiscussion, then AlwaysLearning  <br/>
(my migratory path &lt;g&gt;) stuck with me, even though I had some trouble  <br/>
getting my head around the concepts and the straightforwardness,  <br/>
thinking *my* child was different.<br/>
<br/>
It turns out that it doesn&#39;t matter what kind of child I have, the  <br/>
principles are the same. Sure, my life won&#39;t look like yours, or  <br/>
Pam&#39;s, or Joyce&#39;s, or Jenny&#39;s (oh, maybe a bit like Jenny&#39;s &lt;g&gt;), but  <br/>
your thoughts and words and suggestions are consistent, no matter  <br/>
what. And they work. I credit you (and the moderators of this list)  <br/>
with the life I have with Michelle *and* with my husband.<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciated Heather&#39;s apology and I&#39;m glad she&#39;s come back. I  <br/>
know I took breaks from the list when I needed to digest something  <br/>
that hit home for me. I kept (and keep) coming back again and again.<br/>
<br/>
Now, about SUSS....<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; thusfar, but it&#39;s becoming a more frequent thought.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, goody! I&#39;ll be there, wherever and whenever. SUSS was really  <br/>
affirming, plus I met folks who I hope will be friends of mine for life.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all you do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962541102">&quot;Some dork posted (anonymously) something tacky saying that Holly doesn&#39;t<br/>
know how to read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
LOL I just read the comment. It sounds more like a sulky kid being rude. I<br/>
don&#39;t think anyone reading the comment could possibly read it as a<br/>
reflection on Holly. In your place, I&#39;d not delete it and let that<br/>
ridiculous person get the satisfaction of getting a &#39;raise&#39;. I&#39;d just leave<br/>
it there as an immortal monument to his/her graceless presence. We don&#39;t<br/>
know who the person is, but that person knows and will see it there sitting<br/>
in the metaphorical room as the mess s/he tried to make and the party went<br/>
on around it like a bunch of happy people ignoring the drunk passed out on<br/>
the floor :D<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the photos are beautiful.<br/>
