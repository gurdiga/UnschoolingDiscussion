I can definitely sympathize.  Every one of our son&#39;s grandparents are<br/>
teachers.  They span the grades from pre-K to college.  Hold firm -- I keep<br/>
trying to remember that *I&#39;m* the expert on unschooling.  They know nothing<br/>
about it, though they keep trying to tell me that due to their great<br/>
education and experience, they *know* what my son needs.  bah humbug.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, my whole family is teachers.  Grandparents, sons/daughter, <br/>
grandchildren  and (can you believe this?)-- every last new addition <br/>
to the family this past year 6(inlaws) are all teachers.   Yuck!<br/>
It makes me sick!  Not only am I odd in that I am not a teacher.  But <br/>
this whole attitude extends into fashion, food, child rearing outside <br/>
of school, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I am defintely the odd ball.  I guess my college degree and medical <br/>
license means nothing.  In fact they act as if I have shamed the <br/>
family.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, well.  We just stay away and only do Christmas.  My kids pick up <br/>
the attitudes from them b/c they usually don&#39;t want to go anywhere <br/>
with them.  <br/>
