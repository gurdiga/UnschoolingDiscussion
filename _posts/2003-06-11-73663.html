would be more of a get together, hang out, do some sightseeing thing in 2005. <br/>
I mean HEY, I live at the beach, why would we need workshops!!!<br/>

Ren, hoping some beach bums will come hang with me in 2005. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, here there is a brief period in the middle/end of August when you <br/>
might actually enjoy being in the water. I like it cold, in fact, and I am <br/>
not overly fond of swimming in the warm lake we live beside.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know the summer call of the Northerner? &quot;Come on in, it&#39;s great once <br/>
you get used to it.&quot;<br/>

beaches that are warm enough for swimming, even in August.  Most of them are<br/>
on the east coast of Vancouver Island.<br/>
