<div id="ygrps-yiv-950990814">This is the hardest part for me.  I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because I&#39;m an <br/>
only child, or because I over-identify with my daughter who is the same <br/>
age I was when some pretty awful stuff happened to me...I just don&#39;t <br/>
handle being with them 24-7 very well.  I&#39;ve done for weeks or months <br/>
here and there, but we end up very sad.  Right now they are at <br/>
Montessori for a few days a week and it seems to be a good balance to <br/>
keep the mean mommy at bay.  I desperately want to unschool and enjoy <br/>
my children all day long.  Instead when it comes down to it, I <br/>
withdraw.  I don&#39;t like to read to my kids, I don&#39;t like it when they <br/>
try to &#39;help&#39;.  I feel like a creep!  I used to have a lady come help <br/>
me while I was pregnant with Crispin (I was very very sick, couldn&#39;t <br/>
chase Harriet down to get the wet diapers off)  She turned everything <br/>
into a game and I was so envious of her ability to do that.  It is a <br/>
real test of my patience to let my kids help me do anything.  How can I <br/>
so strongly believe something is right, yet feel so wrong in the role?<br/>
Am I alone in this dilemma?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m guessing the Montessori tuition is more expensive than counselling for <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can (QUICKLY!) find a really good short-term counsellor, someone <br/>
who doesn&#39;t intend to draw out your entire life&#39;s story and keep you as a <br/>
regular client for years, but who could have some incredibly easy and good ideas for <br/>
getting you past your stuck place.<br/>
<br/>
If you plan to stay stuck, unschooling might not work out for you.  If you <br/>
want to unschool, you need to have some flexibility and joy and happy <br/>
expectation.<br/>
<br/>
Are you an introvert and just get crowded?  Can you hire a mother&#39;s helper, <br/>
to hang out with the kids and get them snacks and water and play with them?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t like to read to my kids, I don&#39;t like it when they <br/>
try to &#39;help&#39;.  I feel like a creep! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some moms like one age lots more than others.  Maybe you don&#39;t love toddlers, <br/>
but if you don&#39;t love THESE particular children, it will be harder to unfold <br/>
with them as they grow.<br/>
<br/>
You can heal your own childhood traumas by looking at little things your <br/>
children do and thinking that you wish you could have done that.  And if you think <br/>
it sweetly instead of with jealous resentment, you can allow the hurt child <br/>
inside you to experience a moment of release.   <br/>
<br/>
I could be off on this, but if you have childhood issues you&#39;ve been burying <br/>
or ignoring, it might be the season to release them.  If it&#39;s <br/>
child-of-alcoholic stuff, al-Anon can help you and it won&#39;t cost money.  If it&#39;s codependency, <br/>
you might find a self-help group too.  If it&#39;s survival of sexual abuse, <br/>
likewise.  If it&#39;s less generic, it might be worth going to counselling for a <br/>
while, so that you are freed up and open to give your children what they need so <br/>
that they don&#39;t grow up with a lump left over from childhood too.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 32 I started four years of going to Adult Children of Alcoholics <br/>
meetings.  Without that, I would not have been a good mom, and my marriage <br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t have lasted, because I had knots in me I didn&#39;t know that other <br/>
people didn&#39;t all have.  In that same first season, I got pregnant with Kirby. <br/>
 And I went to La Leche League after he was born.  Those two organizations <br/>
and their ideas about how peple can and should live in peace changed my life, <br/>
and my kids&#39; lives, and my husband&#39;s life in really good ways.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling seemed quite like more of the same, to me,  beause it&#39;s related <br/>
to them both.   Children have natural needs for peace and positive regard and <br/>
for joy.  They grow best when they&#39;re not stunted, which seems obvious, but <br/>
it&#39;s easy to forget if we go with the cultural flow which says children are bad, <br/>
irritating, whiney, sneaky and so forth.  Children raised openly and kindly <br/>
don&#39;t need to be that way.<br/>
<br/>
I think that where your kids are or aren&#39;t won&#39;t matter unless you change <br/>
your own heart and eyes toward them and toward yourself.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah--I&#39;m one of those weirdos who doesn&#39;t like baby-babies. I could really <br/>
do without that whole stage. Large slugs! &lt;g&gt; I LOVE toddlers---could eat them <br/>
with a spoon, Eighteen months to three years? A housefull! I think it&#39;s <br/>
because they are learning SO much SO quickly. They are &quot;coming into their own&quot; as <br/>
people with obvious likes and dislikes---and can finally let you know. And <br/>
they&#39;re so damned funny!<br/>
<br/>
The other stage I like is teens. Probably again for the same reasons! &lt;g&gt; I <br/>
don&#39;t get tired of teens. They change so much every day! And they want to know <br/>
SO much (just not necessarily what YOU want them to know! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
A deal! I&#39;ll ship tiny babies to someone, if you&#39;ll ship them back to me at <br/>
18 months. You get them back at three. I get them again at 13! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

Oh I just adore the baby stage. I think that&#39;s why it&#39;s so hard for me to<br/>
face the fact we won&#39;t have more kids. I just can&#39;t bare to think I won&#39;t<br/>
hold such a tiny little one in my arms and put my face to their wrinkly<br/>
little foreheads and breath deep. I have hope for lots of grandkids!!! So I<br/>
will take the babies, all of them. But then again I like the toddler stages<br/>
and kids stages and teen stages so you probably won&#39;t get them all back!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not even close to alone, I would guess.  I&#39;m with you, for one.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I&#39;m on the computer while my kids are downstairs watching tv.  I<br/>
need some decompression time, or I&#39;m going to be a raving bitch.  But I KNOW<br/>
they are having problems, I can hear it.<br/>
<br/>
I chose to be home, I chose to have kids, I chose to be pregnant right now.<br/>
But it isn&#39;t a role I&#39;m natural at and I am having a hard time with it.<br/>
Sometimes we flow so well, then there is now.  -sigh-<br/>
<br/>
Off to help my kids cope with each other.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sorry.   Terrible things from childhood do make a difference in our<br/>
adult life.<br/>
If you never heal from those things as a child they become open wounds<br/>
eventually and threaten happiness. <br/>
<br/>
You owe your kids everything.  They deserve the best mom ever and you<br/>
deserve to have that sadness filled <br/>
place inside you repaired and filled instead with the joy of your kids.<br/>
<br/>
Someone recommended finding counseling and that&#39;s great advice.   There<br/>
are so may ways you can start feeling better right now.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-792888790">Kelly, I know you will tell me you are just kidding, didn&#39;t I notice the &quot;&lt;g&gt;&quot; after each one of your comments, but I have to say it to you because you have shown such vehemence lately in other places.  Your comments on babies being big slugs made me sick.  Truly, it turned my stomach.  I can&#39;t imagine how a mother would think that of her children.  What a hideous beginning for a child whose mother doesn&#39;t want to be around him or her.  Poor babies.  And, 18 months?  You don&#39;t want to be around them for a year and a half?  The whole notion is nauseating, Kelly.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m NOT kidding, grinning, or joking.  And, I hope I never have to read another post where a mother says she can&#39;t stand to be around her newborn baby.  <br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;Kelly, I know you will tell me you are just kidding, didn&#39;t I notice the <br/>

have shown such vehemence lately in other places.  Your comments on babies <br/>
being big slugs made me sick.  Truly, it turned my stomach.  I can&#39;t imagine how <br/>
a mother would think that of her children.  What a hideous beginning for a <br/>
child whose mother doesn&#39;t want to be around him or her.  Poor babies.  And, 18 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-172436681">phew, I am so relieved to hear some really heart felt and honest discussion about the hard realities of parenting for 24/7. I know that as a relative newcomer to this list I have often felt like I could never imagine being the perfect parent that is illustrated so often on this list. I think that it becomes more of a reality as easier over time of practicing some of the ideas and thoughts that have been articulated beautifully on this list but I clearly remember having a miny breakdown a few months after joining this list because I was trying soo hard to practice these ideas and let go of some of my &quot;issues&quot; and I just found myself totally overwhelmed by all three of my children and yelling at one of them for something (so stupid and silly I don&#39;t even remember what it is now) but I remember thinking, my God, do those unschooling moms ever screw up like this? and feeling a little inept. I quickly apologized for my behavior and went on but the fact remains that parenting for me has<br/>
 been the most rewarding wonderful, heartbreaking and exhausting job I have ever had. I wish all those mothers that may struggle great luck and love in their pursuit to find some joy in parenting and unschooling. Kelli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-448209433">I&#39;m all for escaping when necessary.  My little girl is extremely verbal and creative and talks pretty much the entire time she is awake.  I usually love to listen to her chatter, but sometimes I do need a break.  I build in two breaks a day, in fact, and they are both at the gym.  My gym has day care, and I can drop Margaux for an hour in the morning and an hour after my husband gets off work.  She likes the aids there and she can play video games and dress up.  It&#39;s a great play area, with a playground outside, too. <br/>
<br/>
Last week I asked a friend to watch her all day while I went to Spokane with a friend.  Turned out that my friends car broke down about 2/3 of the way there and we had to come back, but it was a day without kids for both of us, and it was very refreshing.<br/>
<br/>
You have to take care of yourself so that you can be a good mom, no matter what the age of your children.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m fortunate in that I&#39;ve loved all my daughter&#39;s ages and stages, and I&#39;ve always had a great support system.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-326615887">I&#39;m going to piggy back (kind-of) onto what Sandra was saying.<br/>
<br/>
**If you plan to stay stuck, unschooling might not work out for you.  If you <br/>
want to unschool, you need to have some flexibility and joy and happy <br/>
expectation.**<br/>
<br/>
Yes,  and if you want it bad enough you can do it.<br/>
<br/>
I was raised in a pretty much traditional status quo home,  kids played with kids, adults hung with adults.   The seperateness was startling. <br/>
<br/>
I also had some abuse that was belittled, and made light of,  but am dealing with it now.<br/>
<br/>
So as you said,  when I had children,  I didn&#39;t enjoy *really* playing with them or later,  even really *being* with them.   I didn&#39;t know how, I was never shown.  I needed some solitude and felt it (I am an introvert) when my oldest 2 were 18 months and a baby, it was especially hard.   I was never told that this would be a short time,  enjoy them and cuddle them,  it will help them and you in the long run.....and so on.   <br/>
You are probably ahead of me on this and have heard all of this, but this was advice that I didn&#39;t even think of or hear of until after the fact.<br/>
<br/>
Point being,  I  am now enjoying my children.  We are living together happily,  playing together.   And I don&#39;t get sick of them.  They hang with me sometimes,  go on their own sometimes.  They are older now.     We are all healing and loving this unschooling life.<br/>
<br/>
I did have to make a conscious decision though.  I was going to parent differently from how I was parented and every so often I have to remind myself.   Especially with society being so different than these ways.  I want to give to my children what I didn&#39;t have!  And you know what?  Its awesome!   <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I do also have to take time to care for myself and that is the balancing act part.  Sometimes it comes easier than other times and when it doesn&#39;t come as easy,  I am learning how to deal with that too  :)  Yoga and breathing.  Which you can do in a variety of places.<br/>
<br/>
You can do it!  And it is so worth the effort.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so disjointed,  but until my kids are older, :)   I probably won&#39;t be able to write a nice flowing piece.<br/>

aren&#39;t cool and loved and all that in infancy, but...they just aren&#39;t that<br/>
interesting.<br/>
<br/>
My little one is 26 months and started talking this summer.  Went from one<br/>
word to sentences in about a month.  WAY more fun now when we can actually<br/>
TALK!!!  My seven year old is facinating.  I have a baby due in, oh 2 weeks,<br/>
and while I&#39;m happy about it, the reality is--the next six months or so is<br/>
just a matter of figuring out his temperment and taking care of him.<br/>
Integrating him into the family.  Crucial and all that.  Loving and all<br/>
that, but honestly, not that interesting to me.<br/>
<br/>
I do feel a bit like I&#39;m &quot;waiting&quot; until ALL my boys are at least 2.5 so<br/>
that we can live &quot;normally.&quot;  Not an attitude that always makes life easy, I<br/>
admit.  And one I&#39;m working on.  BUT in many ways it&#39;s not unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not an awful mom, but I&#39;m not the BEST mom of very little kids.  Doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean I<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t love them.  Doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t take care of htem.<br/>
Doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m a bad person.  Just means babies don&#39;t thrill me.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Your comments on babies being big slugs made me sick.  Truly, it turned <br/>
my stomach. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
IT WAS A JOKE.<br/>
<br/>
It was a reference (I&#39;m guessing) to my having said many times that babies <br/>
aren&#39;t just grubs, as some people seem to treat them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And, I hope I never have to read another post where a mother says she can&#39;t <br/>
stand to be around her newborn baby. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You DON&#39;T have to.<br/>
What Kelly wrote was in the context of me having tried to reassure another <br/>
mom.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Poor babies.  And, 18 months?  You don&#39;t want to be around them for a year <br/>
and a half?  The whole notion is nauseating, Kelly.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kelly&#39;s kids are really, truly happy boys--I&#39;ve seen them in their home.<br/>
And their mom is really, truly happy.<br/>
Your post wasn&#39;t.   Please try to breathe a few times before going off like <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Nichole, expecting much backlash.... bring it on!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why do you want to do that to the list when it&#39;s peaceful and your complaints <br/>
were based on something you knew were intended to be humor?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>issues with her from other lists.You are forcing over a thousand other people to <br/>
listen to you whine about it and THAT is truly rude.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Her issues on the other list:<br/>
<br/>
On Unschooling 101 we had someone, who is an eclectic homeschooler with a <br/>
Waldorf bent, posting that she needs some help finding ways to motivate the <br/>
children in a science class she&#39;s teaching this fall. I said that this is an <br/>
UNschooling list for beginners and that and that she would do better to find a <br/>
Waldorf or teachers&#39; list.<br/>
<br/>
Then Oom came on to say that she thinks that her children&#39;s doing workbooks <br/>
is &quot;working&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Again, this is Unschooling-101. Neither of those things has ANYthing to do <br/>
with unschooling---especially unschooling for beginners.  Please, anyone who&#39;s <br/>
interested in adding to the conversation, jump right in!<br/>
<br/>
Nicole likened me to a townsperson searching out Frankenstein---with a &quot;torch <br/>
and pitchfork&quot;. If you&#39;re interested, it&#39;s still all there in black & white.<br/>
<br/>
The slug thing is a JOKE. Cameron, as an infant--he just slept and <br/>
ate---easiest child anyone could ever want. But I thought I&#39;d made a huge mistake <br/>
because I didn&#39;t feel this overwhelming joy that everyone else does with tiny <br/>
infants. At three months, he smiled at me, and I started to think he *was* actually <br/>
cute! &lt;G&gt; I still have no overwhelming need to hold others&#39; babies.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite ages are toddlers and teens---the two that *most* people find the <br/>
most &quot;choresome&quot; and difficult. I like that they are constantly growing and <br/>
evolving and becoming more and more fascinating. Those two ages are my <br/>
favorites. Period. (Until they become adults, maybe? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

Second one was emergency C-section. :-P~~~~~~~~~<br/>

&lt;&lt; I clearly remember having a miny breakdown a few months after joining this <br/>
list . . . I remember thinking, my God, do those unschooling moms ever screw <br/>
up like this? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I know of any mom who&#39;s never gotten grumpy and said some <br/>
version of NOT NOW (or worse).  The corner is turned when your thought is not &quot;they <br/>
asked for that,&quot; but &quot;I screwed up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are parents who never apologize to their children.  They think that the <br/>
way to maintain their superior position is to justify their mistakes and <br/>
blame the children for them instead of even consider that they could humble <br/>
themselves to the point of admitting fault.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a famous example (used on me and other friends of mine, I know) of <br/>
spanking all the kids when you don&#39;t know who was truly at fault and don&#39;t want <br/>
to take the time to find out, and saying &quot;If you didn&#39;t do it this time, <br/>
there&#39;s some other time you did something and didn&#39;t get caught.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I quickly apologized for my behavior and went on but the fact remains that <br/>
parenting for me has<br/>
 been the most rewarding wonderful, heartbreaking and exhausting job I have <br/>
ever had.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;re willing to do it to the point of exhaustion.  Some parents don&#39;t <br/>
bother.<br/>
They couldn&#39;t possible be unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I remember, very clearly, holding my adopted son Gene Gene in my<br/>
arms at 4 weeks. He was screaming for the third hour (he had terrible colic)<br/>
and I just wanted to toss his butt right out the window.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think there are exceptions of mothers who birth naturally and nurse their <br/>
babies and maybe the hormones don&#39;t kick in right and their mothering instinct <br/>
doesn&#39;t engage, and there may be adoptive moms whose hormones flow easily and <br/>
they get the same kinds of warmth and nighttime waking and bonding with <br/>
someone else&#39;s infant, but on average, in general, it seems it would be MUCH easier <br/>
with one&#39;s own child.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have much free-floating mothering instinct before I had Kirby.  I <br/>
had never liked to babysit.  I didn&#39;t have the urge to hold my friends&#39; babies.  <br/>
But when I was pregnant, the hormones came on STRONGLY and breastfeeding was <br/>
a clear and definite physical advantage for me.  Before, I had wondered how I <br/>
was possibly going to sit still in a chair for half an hour to nurse a baby, <br/>
but I found easy to sit for a WHOLE hour, and smell him and touch him and talk <br/>
to him and just watch him breathe.<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone has the same level of biochemistry in different levels.  I&#39;m <br/>
sure different people&#39;s biochemistry must be at least as varied  as their hair <br/>
texture, skin color and shapes of noses.  Someday people will know more about <br/>
all that, but now it&#39;s new and vague.<br/>
<br/>
If we listen to people who say &quot;Your baby needs to learn to be independent, <br/>
put him in daycare,&quot; that&#39;s a danger to bonding and to the child&#39;s sense of <br/>
confidence and safety.<br/>
