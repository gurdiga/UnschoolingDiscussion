<div id="ygrps-yiv-662441122">Don&#39;t you ever give up.  You are a gifted writer and you have a vision with <br/>
your work that needs to be realized.  The book really changed my life in a <br/>
positive way.  You have to believe in yourself and keep moving forward.  <br/>
There are more out there like me who appreciate you and your work then not.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
