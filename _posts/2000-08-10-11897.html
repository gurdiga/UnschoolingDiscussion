<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037668009"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I need some prayers . I need to quit <br/>
 </span></blockquote>smoking . Im gonna try for Monday. This will be my second time . Last year I <br/>
went to the Drs and he said &quot;Tamie, some people can smoke all their lives and <br/>
never really show any problems. You are not one of them!!!&quot; I quit using the <br/>
patch the following Monday. I quit for 5 months and felt great. Then had an <br/>
arguement with my mom and let it go down the drain.(bad excuse , I know) Now <br/>
my chest hurts all the time and the cough is embarrasing. Im only 29 and <br/>
sound like 80!!! <br/>
Thanks Everyone<br/>
I would like to hear other peoples quitting stories , if there are any. I <br/>
think it will help to hear Im not the only one to screw it up after 5 months.<br/>

Hi Tamie: <br/>
hubbie and I quit before I got pregnant with Zak and then once he was born, <br/>
one night I went out with friends when he was 9 months old and I picked up a <br/>
cigarette and then proceeded to smoke 5 a day for the next 1 year... Then we <br/>
quit again for another 2 years and again I went out to a Casino this time and <br/>
started smoking and then hubbie started smoking... Quit and started, quit and <br/>
started, quit and started and this has been going on for 3 years.... Neither <br/>
of my kids have ever seen us smoke... and today we haven&#39;t smoked for 3 <br/>
months, but we could smoke tomorrow if we are not careful....<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a one day at a time thing for us... It&#39;s the hardest addiction <br/>
there is (for anyone that knows anything about addictions)... It&#39;s more <br/>
addicting than heroin and it&#39;s the most widely accepted (after alcohol)....<br/>
<br/>
Good luck... I will be saying a prayer for you and hope you&#39;ll say one for me <br/>
too.<br/>
