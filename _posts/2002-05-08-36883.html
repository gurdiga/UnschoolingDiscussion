<div id="ygrps-yiv-882993709">Hi, my name is Tammy.  I live in Washington state with my husband and <br/>
two children.  Daughter is 7 and son is 9 (10 in August).  We started <br/>
homeschooling a few weeks ago.  My daughter came home first, in <br/>
march, then son in April.  My daughter is all ready to do activities <br/>
and meet new people.  She really liked school (the friends part) <br/>
except she was frequently bored.  My son was over challenged and I <br/>
feel it will be a long time before he willingly engages in any <br/>
activities.  He is frequently bored and all seems to want to do is <br/>
watch T.V.  We are not a big T.V. family ( we only have one!) so its <br/>
never been something that is a regular part of the day.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
if I should let him watch as much as he wants or stick with my hard <br/>
held view of minimal T.V.<br/>
<br/>
My main concern, however, is the amount of fighting my lovely <br/>
children are doing.  I&#39;m really at my wits end.  Has anyone else had <br/>
these issues?  I&#39;ve done a lot of reading and I know (at least hope) <br/>
that this too shall pass, but what do I do in the meantime?  It&#39;s <br/>
easy to say it will get better, but that&#39;s no help in the heat of the <br/>
moment.  I want them to learn how to work it out, but I don&#39;t think <br/>
they even like each other now.<br/>
<br/>
Please help.<br/>

<br/>
Get them out and about?  If they don&#39;t do out and about well together, take <br/>
them separately.<br/>
<br/>
Cheap movies, zoo, restaurants, museums, construction sites, malls, parks, <br/>
hiking places, dog/frisbee places (if you have a dog).... but SOMEwhere.  Or <br/>
take one of them to the store with you and let them pick stuff out, or make a <br/>
picnic and take them both to a place where they can play on playground <br/>
equipment or climb rocks or something physical, Kind-of together, and kind of <br/>
apart.<br/>
<br/>
After school and the coming and going, they&#39;re probably feeling a little <br/>
stifled and crowded.   My kids really like to be home, but they like it <br/>
better in the big house we have now than they did in the little house we had <br/>
until Kirby was ten or eleven.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I want them to learn how to work it out, but I don&#39;t think <br/>
they even like each other now.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t leave them to learn how to work it out without ideas.  Kids need <br/>
to be safe from their siblings (physically and verbally and emotionally).  <br/>
Too many parents act like it&#39;s THEIR life and they can work it out, but they <br/>
were brought into a family and are stuck in a house, and the parents should <br/>
try to make it a safe and peaceful environment.  That&#39;s MY opinion on it, <br/>
which won&#39;t match everyone else&#39;s, I know already.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;d let him watch TV lots, if it were me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you see the TV watching and fighting as symptoms of other things, then<br/>
it&#39;s really the other things that need fixed, not the symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
He may be watching TV as a way of decompressing from school. I watched a lot<br/>
of TV after school and I can remember specifically one summer college break<br/>
watching HBO pretty much continuously. I just needed to shut down.<br/>
<br/>
He may be watching TV because school has tainted everything as &quot;educational&quot;<br/>
and therefore boring. He doesn&#39;t trust that his interests are really<br/>
interesting if they even remotely resemble school.<br/>
<br/>
As Sandra suggested, get out and do things just for fun. Don&#39;t worry about<br/>
learning. Just explore *life*.<br/>
<br/>
The fighting, too, may be a symptom of the stress of the enormous change<br/>
that&#39;s happened in their lives. (Have you read Siblings Without Rivalry?)<br/>
<br/>
How about if you talk to them about their expectations. Things they&#39;d like<br/>
to do. Dreams they have. Plans for the future, or next week. Talk about and<br/>
share their favorite things (even if it&#39;s a cartoon you can&#39;t imagine<br/>
there&#39;s anything of redeeming value in ;-).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143941136">Hi Tammy,<br/>
<br/>
I thought Des Moines was in Iowa!  I didn&#39;t know there were two of <br/>
them.  Cool.<br/>
<br/>
My girls ised to fight a lot.  They stopped and I&#39;m not sure what <br/>
helped.  They claim it is because I had Wyndham.  You know, the enemy <br/>
of my enemy is my friend sort of thing.  I think it is because they <br/>
were away from school and figured out they were allowed to hang <br/>
together despite the age difference.  Now my problem is Rachel and <br/>
Wyndham  I can&#39;t leave them alone together.  Mostly I solve the <br/>
problem by not leaving them alone together.  The fact that yours are <br/>
younger makes that more difficult.  Are you part of group that can <br/>
take your dd out while you stay home with ds?  Do they have common <br/>
interests you can help them explore?  What is the root source of the <br/>
conflict?  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884043715">Thank you for the great advice.  My dd loves to go out on the town, <br/>
while right now ds wants to hang out at home.  Sometimes friends take <br/>
dd out which helps a lot.  My deep down insticts tell me to let my ds <br/>
watch as much T.V. as he wants but my darn brain keeps getting in the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Bridget<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we are the other Des Moines, nice, small, waterfront town with <br/>
great restaurants, a marina and a movie theater that shows one <br/>
movie.  Yet it is only about 25 minutes away from downtown Seattle.<br/>
 <br/>
I think time away from school will help and being that my son has <br/>
only been home for three weeks and dd has been home for 2 months <br/>
probably has a little to do with it.  Their major conflicts arise <br/>
because they both have to be right and they both have to have the <br/>
last word.  So a very minor disagreement escalates to a huge <br/>
screaming match.  Also ds had some bad influences at school and has <br/>
learned how to talk very rudely, not just to his sister but to all of <br/>
us.  Major attitude.  My two children are very different from each <br/>
other so its hard to find mutual interests.  When one wants to play <br/>
one game the other doesn&#39;t or if they agree and things don&#39;t turn out <br/>
the way dd thinks they should we all suffer.  They even eat opposite <br/>
foods.  Polar opposites.  FUN.<br/>
<br/>
Today my dd is starting a clay for kids class that runs for a few <br/>
weeks, then she will start another class about the time that one <br/>
ends.  That will help.  I know dd needs to make some friends.<br/>
<br/>
Anymore advice will be accepted.<br/>

Soemtimes, I&#39;m able to step between mine and get them to explain the <br/>
disagreement and compromise.  That takes great care and diplomacy and <br/>
you have to be able to maintain your own calm for it to work.  <br/>
Occassionally, just explaining hte problem results in them seeing away <br/>
around it, other times I suggest a compromise and they are okay with <br/>
it.  On some occassions though, the only answer has been to get them <br/>
away from each other for a while.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-475156622">Hi Tammy<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t know <br/>
if I should let him watch as much as he wants or stick with my hard <br/>
held view of minimal T.V.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I think you should let him watch as much as he wants.  Unschooling<br/>
doesn&#39;t work as well as it can unless the child is TRULY setting the<br/>
pace.  Your son is decompressing from school and it will go much faster<br/>
without pressure to do anything but what he feels like doing.  He&#39;s still<br/>
learning, learning can&#39;t be stopped, it happens no matter what.  If<br/>
nothing else, he is learning that you&#39;re serious about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My main concern, however, is the amount of fighting my lovely <br/>
children are doing.  I&#39;m really at my wits end.  Has anyone else had <br/>
these issues?  I&#39;ve done a lot of reading and I know (at least hope) <br/>
that this too shall pass, but what do I do in the meantime?  It&#39;s <br/>
easy to say it will get better, but that&#39;s no help in the heat of the <br/>
moment.  I want them to learn how to work it out, but I don&#39;t think <br/>
they even like each other now.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think outside pressure has a huge impact on how siblings relate.  Mine<br/>
are 11 and 4 but I see a HUGE difference in their closeness when they<br/>
have too much of the wrong kind of socialization.  If Lanora is out with<br/>
her public schooled friends for too long her attitude towards Jonathan<br/>
becomes impatient and haughty.<br/>
<br/>
Physical and emotional attacks are not tolerated so I use a balance of<br/>
intervention and letting them work it out.  Knowing that whining won&#39;t<br/>
get a response from me helps to stop it before it starts.  Usually I give<br/>
comfort to the one who feels wronged and give advice if it&#39;s asked for. <br/>
I try to not &quot;rescue&quot;, it&#39;s okay to say no to sharing, this teaches them<br/>
to be cooperative cuz if you want to use someone&#39;s stuff it&#39;s best to<br/>
keep them friendly towards you.  If it comes to being physical or unkind<br/>
I step in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080285151">Hi Kris,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the encouraging words.  I agree with the outside <br/>
pressure issue.  My son had some bad influences in public school.  <br/>
Boys in his class, especially the ones with older sibilings, were not <br/>
very kind to him; lots of teasing and making fun of.  So I understand <br/>
where his hostility is coming from.  It&#39;s so hard for me to let go of <br/>
the only education I know, which is public school.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s <br/>
so hard for me to give up the tv thing.  I&#39;m working on it though.  <br/>
Talking to everyone here helps too.<br/>

&gt; Hi Tammy<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;I don&#39;t know <br/>
&gt; if I should let him watch as much as he wants or stick with my hard <br/>
&gt; held view of minimal T.V.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, I think you should let him watch as much as he wants.  <br/>
Unschooling<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t work as well as it can unless the child is TRULY setting the<br/>
&gt; pace.  Your son is decompressing from school and it will go much <br/>
faster<br/>
&gt; without pressure to do anything but what he feels like doing.  He&#39;s <br/>
still<br/>
&gt; learning, learning can&#39;t be stopped, it happens no matter what.  If<br/>
&gt; nothing else, he is learning that you&#39;re serious about unschooling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;My main concern, however, is the amount of fighting my lovely <br/>
&gt; children are doing.  I&#39;m really at my wits end.  Has anyone else <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; these issues?  I&#39;ve done a lot of reading and I know (at least <br/>
hope) <br/>
&gt; that this too shall pass, but what do I do in the meantime?  It&#39;s <br/>
&gt; easy to say it will get better, but that&#39;s no help in the heat of <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; moment.  I want them to learn how to work it out, but I don&#39;t think <br/>
&gt; they even like each other now.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think outside pressure has a huge impact on how siblings relate.  <br/>
Mine<br/>
&gt; are 11 and 4 but I see a HUGE difference in their closeness when <br/>
they<br/>
&gt; have too much of the wrong kind of socialization.  If Lanora is out <br/>
with<br/>
&gt; her public schooled friends for too long her attitude towards <br/>
Jonathan<br/>
&gt; becomes impatient and haughty.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Physical and emotional attacks are not tolerated so I use a balance <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; intervention and letting them work it out.  Knowing that whining <br/>
won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get a response from me helps to stop it before it starts.  Usually <br/>
I give<br/>
&gt; comfort to the one who feels wronged and give advice if it&#39;s asked <br/>
for. <br/>
&gt; I try to not &quot;rescue&quot;, it&#39;s okay to say no to sharing, this teaches <br/>
them<br/>
&gt; to be cooperative cuz if you want to use someone&#39;s stuff it&#39;s best <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; keep them friendly towards you.  If it comes to being physical or <br/>
unkind<br/>
&gt; I step in.<br/>
