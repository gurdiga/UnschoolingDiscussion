&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;It was to watch them, standing by my cart, look at my watch occasionally<br/>
&gt; &gt;and say hmmm....I really thought when you were crying, you were doing<br/>
&gt; &gt;a much better job! etc.&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;OR <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;How much longer do you feel the need to do this? I have about 3 more<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;minutes, so just go ahead and continue I will let you know when your time<br/>
&gt; &gt;is up!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; None of those is very respectful of children, though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree.  And ran into this with my youngest, 6 yrs, at Christmas time.  He <br/>
wanted an Egyptian statue.  He was crying almost hysterical.  It was real <br/>
late.  We were all hungry.  <br/>
<br/>
I took him to a quiet corner of the store and explained that we just didn&#39;t <br/>
have the money and that I would help him to earn some money and we would save <br/>
some and come back another day to get the statue.  He was still hysterical.  <br/>
I picked him up and gave him a big hug.  Still crying.  Carried him out of <br/>
the store, he calmed a little.  Held him while we drove and let him pick out <br/>
a restaurant.  Feeling better with some food in his tummy we drove home and <br/>
went back 2 weeks later and he got the statue.  <br/>
I never lie to the boys and always try to help them understand the situation <br/>
and offer some ways to get what they want and always follow through.<br/>

<br/>
Actually its pretty non-violent. And gives a parent<br/>
an alternative.<br/>
