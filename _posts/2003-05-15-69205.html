<h4>Have A Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>15 May 2003, at  1:05pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306488609">For those who emailed me privately about being penpals with my 11 year old daughter, I have lost all the info.  I was having pc problems and in the process of fixing it, my email program was wiped clean, including all the stuff I had saved.<br/>
<br/>
To save you any trouble though, my daughter is not sure she wants to write via snail mail.  She prefers email.<br/>
<br/>
If your children still want to be penpals via email, let me know offlist.<br/>
<br/>
My apologies for the inconvenience.<br/>
