<div id="ygrps-yiv-823871391">Hello all, I&#39;m fairly new to this list and am sure this has probably <br/>
been broached before, but I am looking for kids to pen pal, email pal <br/>
and/or chat pal with my two. The boy is 9 and the girl is 7-- both <br/>
have wide and varied interests. Anyone else out there interested in <br/>
setting your kids up to do this? Please feel free to email me! Thanks!<br/>
