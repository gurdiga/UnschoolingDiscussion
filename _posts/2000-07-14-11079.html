&lt;&lt; If you are having problems with wild mood swings and blood sugar levels, it<br/>
 is more likely to be because of something you are eating, not because you<br/>
 aren&#39;t eating meat or getting enough protein. Maybe you are getting too many<br/>
 simple carbohydrates or waiting too long between meals. &gt;&gt;<br/>

This could be a possibility.    I was eating tons of pasta and fresh vegies, <br/>
little eggs and dairy and almost no meat.  So what do you eat?  Please share <br/>
what you have eaten in, say the last 2-3 days, just to give us hopefulls some <br/>
ideas.  I think part of my problem is not know what to eat or how to prepare <br/>
it so it is tasty.  If you could pass along some simple no lose receipes, <br/>
that would help too......Thanks.<br/>

Thank you so much for the information.  I am going to check out our public <br/>
library and see if they have any of the books you recommended.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to get in to cooking with tofu-but haven&#39;t a clue how or what to <br/>
fix with it....<br/>
<br/>
Would you please explain the different vegan terminology, for us, veggie <br/>
illiterates?  I have read them before but don&#39;t remember them...<br/>

I&#39;m catching up on days of posts here, so you&#39;ve prob. already gotten<br/>
suggestions, but I&#39;ll give you mine. I&#39;ve found that eating meat replacement<br/>
products help to keep me feeling full and up to par. The list of these<br/>
products seems endless already and it grows more everyday. Right now in my<br/>
freezer I have crumbles (used in place of ground beef), chicken nuggets,<br/>
chicken patties, corn dogs, burgers, and some &quot;hot pockets&quot; style sandwiches<br/>
and none of these things contain any meat at all! Morning star farms makes<br/>
all of these products and I can get them all in my regular neighborhood<br/>
supermarket. Two years ago, I had to travel to a healthfood store 25 min.<br/>
away to get these things, so awareness toward vegetarianism is certainly<br/>
increasing. Good luck to you. Vegetarianism is a great lifestyle to lead.<br/>

Nor do I. I simply concider them a meat replacement. I am not a vegetarian<br/>
because of health reasons. I am one for moral reasons. In fact the thing<br/>
that convinced me that I could survive as a veggie was the fact that I<br/>
didn&#39;t have to give up coke and potato chips. &lt;g&gt;. I know a few people that<br/>
are raw foodists and I believe that this is the way to go for health. IMHO.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This book doesn&#39;t say to cut all carbs. What it does<br/>
say is that all sugar is the same whether it is in the<br/>
form of fruits and veggies or candy. The body turns it<br/>
all to sugar. When you start the diet (and I mean a<br/>
way of eating, not the traditional deffinition), you<br/>
start in one of 3 phases depending on your fat %, and<br/>
your health i.e. diabetic, heart disease, blood<br/>
preasure, etc. Then over the course of a few weeks you<br/>
add more carbs to the ones you are already taking in.<br/>
By the time you reach phase 3 of the diet you are<br/>
taking in equal amounts of protein and carbs not one<br/>
more or less than the other.  You really need to read<br/>
the book. It explains the medical basis of the diet<br/>
and why and how it works as well. My bil is an MD and<br/>
he read the book and agrees that yes it is based on <br/>
medical text books. I guess I also have a hard time<br/>
believing that the high carb diet that the govn&#39;t<br/>
endorces is ballanced since we also need protein...and<br/>
since the time they started endorsing the carb diet<br/>
the country has gotten fatter and has more heart,<br/>
blood preassure and blood sugar problems. Aside of<br/>
that I don&#39;t trust much of what the govn&#39;t tells us<br/>
anyway but that&#39;s another subject. LOL   Corallyn<br/>

<h4>Tracy Oldfield</h4>
<time>15 Jul 2000, at  4:33pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-454820631">The Atkins diet, which I have the cookbook for here, designed for <br/>
folk with weight problems and blood-sugar imbalances (with a <br/>
specific section on yeast-infection) limits carbs to 20g per day for <br/>
2 weeks, gradually increasing until a more &#39;normal&#39; level, one at <br/>
which the person following the program is comfortable, is found.  <br/>
The point is actually for the body to go into ketosis, therefore <br/>
using the resources the body has built up over the years.  It&#39;s <br/>
imperative to drink LOTS of water during this period (as always, <br/>
but particularly so) since toxins trapped in fat cells will suddenly <br/>
find themselves free to travel around the body, and also to flush <br/>
the waste products from digesting protein away.  One also needs <br/>
to be aware that withdrawal syptoms from carbohydrates will <br/>
probably arise, along with the effects of said toxins.  I haven&#39;t <br/>
followed the diet fully, but have felt considerably better since <br/>
stopping eating regular breakfast cereal and eating omelette or <br/>
bacon or ham.  I think this is becoming a circular argument, since <br/>
I believe I&#39;ve said this before.  Yes it could be the reduction of <br/>
milk in my diet from cutting out cereal, but I think it&#39;s the protein-<br/>
balance that&#39;s more critical to me.<br/>

cut out carbs.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but isn&#39;t it bad to cut out<br/>
&gt; &gt; all carbs? I was told<br/>
&gt; &gt; it could send the body int o keytosis and set one up<br/>
&gt; &gt; for kidney<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage/failure.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Amy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This book doesn&#39;t say to cut all carbs. What it does<br/>
&gt; say is that all sugar is the same whether it is in the<br/>
&gt; form of fruits and veggies or candy. The body turns it<br/>
&gt; all to sugar. When you start the diet (and I mean a<br/>
&gt; way of eating, not the traditional deffinition), you<br/>
&gt; start in one of 3 phases depending on your fat %, and<br/>
&gt; your health i.e. diabetic, heart disease, blood<br/>
&gt; preasure, etc. Then over the course of a few weeks you<br/>
&gt; add more carbs to the ones you are already taking in.<br/>
&gt; By the time you reach phase 3 of the diet you are<br/>
&gt; taking in equal amounts of protein and carbs not one<br/>
&gt; more or less than the other.  You really need to read<br/>
&gt; the book. It explains the medical basis of the diet<br/>
&gt; and why and how it works as well. My bil is an MD and<br/>
&gt; he read the book and agrees that yes it is based on<br/>
&gt; medical text books. I guess I also have a hard time<br/>
&gt; believing that the high carb diet that the govn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; endorces is ballanced since we also need protein...and<br/>
&gt; since the time they started endorsing the carb diet<br/>
&gt; the country has gotten fatter and has more heart,<br/>
&gt; blood preassure and blood sugar problems. Aside of<br/>
&gt; that I don&#39;t trust much of what the govn&#39;t tells us<br/>
&gt; anyway but that&#39;s another subject. LOL   Corallyn<br/>

<h4>Billy or Nancy</h4>
<time>16 Jul 2000, at 10:16am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-687197959">Julie,<br/>
<br/>
Friday and Saturday I was away at a homeschooling conference, so you don&#39;t<br/>
really want to know what I have eaten over the last few days! :-)<br/>
<br/>
It started innocently enough with a bowl of cereal (bran flakes with soy<br/>
milk. Most soy milks are slightly sweet, so you don&#39;t need to add sugar to<br/>
unsweetened cereal. I like plain soy milk, not the vanilla).<br/>
<br/>
Then with boxing up books, loading boxes into the van, driving to the<br/>
conference, unloading boxes from the van and then unboxing books and setting<br/>
up displays - well you can see it was physically demanding work. Under such<br/>
special circumstances, Nancy usually keeps me motivated and going strong by<br/>
supplying me with a bag of special &quot;power pellets&quot; that can be found at many<br/>
stores. They have a crunchy, protein center derived from a plant overlaid<br/>
with a sweet, dark colored high energy compound which is covered with a<br/>
hard, brightly colored shell so that they only melt in your mouth, not in<br/>
your hand. They go by initials that when combined spell the sound I make<br/>
when I eat them! (LOL) A 10 oz bag supplied most of my nutrition for the<br/>
rest of the day (I told you didn&#39;t want to know!)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not typical of course, but I think it points out that being<br/>
vegetarian doesn&#39;t necessarily mean being some fanatic, ascetic,<br/>
nutritionally obsessed oddball. People don&#39;t realize how easy it can be to<br/>
eat vegetarian, and how many meals are easily adapted.<br/>
<br/>
Breakfast can be cereal. If you are ovo-lacto vegetarian (eat eggs & dairy<br/>
products), you can have an omelet or french toast. Pancakes, waffles - are<br/>
you feeling deprived yet?<br/>
<br/>
Lunch can be a soup and a sandwich. For canned soups, I like Progresso<br/>
Lentil soup. One of my favorite &quot;treat&quot; sandwiches is a toasted bagel with<br/>
crisped Breakfast Strips (Morningstar Farms), a slice of tomato, and<br/>
lettuce. A BLT never tasted so good!<br/>
<br/>
Dinner can be spaghetti (just no meatballs), pizza, tacos with refried bean<br/>
filling instead of meat (most name brand canned refried beans are no longer<br/>
made with lard, but check to be sure), lasagna, pierogis, french fries -<br/>
lots of &quot;normal&quot; food. And yes, you can have salad too.<br/>
<br/>
If you eat out, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Wendy&#39;s, and Subway have the best<br/>
selection of fast food vegetarian offering, although we have gone to<br/>
McDonald and Burger King and ordered cheeseburgers with lettuce and tomato<br/>
instead of the beef.<br/>
<br/>
For more upscale restaurants, Chinese and Italian also tend to have many<br/>
selections that are naturally meatless. But as with the fast food, even if<br/>
they don&#39;t list a meatless offering, they can usually prepare a dish without<br/>
meat if you request it.<br/>
<br/>
Most people don&#39;t realize that even a generation or two ago, meat was not a<br/>
main course the way it is today. It was usually more of a side dish and<br/>
portions were much smaller. This is especially true of the South were more<br/>
vegetables were available.<br/>

&gt; So what do you<br/>
&gt; eat?  Please share<br/>
&gt; what you have eaten in, say the last 2-3 days, just to give<br/>
&gt; us hopefulls some<br/>
&gt; ideas.  I think part of my problem is not know what to eat or<br/>
&gt; how to prepare<br/>
&gt; it so it is tasty.  If you could pass along some simple no<br/>
&gt; lose receipes,<br/>
&gt; that would help too......Thanks.<br/>

 Say it&#39;s not so... Here I am preparing Nature&#39;s Healthy Sausage from the <br/>
 Health food store (soy based I believe) and I was thinking I was at eating <br/>
 something healthy &lt;g&gt;.. Well at least it&#39;s not meat,... one thing at a time<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, no don&#39;t feel bad!  Just wanted to give you a heads up that not all<br/>
soy meat replacement products are &quot;healthy&quot;.  The brand I specifically<br/>
know of is Morning Star (but of course their stuff is yummy !!!) to not be<br/>
truly considered a health food.  We love their chicken-less nuggets and<br/>
corn dogs  : ) Probably all genetically engineered corn/soy products too<br/>
in Morning Star but I don&#39;t even want to go there : 0  !!!  Your doing just<br/>
fine : )<br/>
