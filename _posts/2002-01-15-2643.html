&lt;&lt; Just recently saw the Japanese film _Tampopo_ by Juzo Itami again after<br/>
 many years. One of the scenes shows a woman nursing her baby. She calmly<br/>
 unbuttons her shirt, from the top, and sits on a park bench and feeds<br/>
 her child. Totally unselfconscious. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I&#39;ve seen this. This is the one where the woman&#39;s <br/>
main goal in life is to make the perfect ramen right?<br/>
I thought it was really funny.<br/>
