<div id="ygrps-yiv-465984462">Is there a list for parents whose unschooled children decided to go to school?<br/>
<br/>
My 16yod decided to attend high school and is pretty happy there. (Maybe in part because she knows she can come home at anytime.) My 13yod is still unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I have some parenting questions related to the 16yod, but hesitate to ask them here since she is no longer unschooled. I love the perspectives on parenting that I&#39;ve gained from this list.<br/>

Since the list isn&#39;t very busy, go ahead and ask if you want to.  I  <br/>
don&#39;t know of such a list (former unschoolers discussing kids now in  <br/>
school).<br/>
