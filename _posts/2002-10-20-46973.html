<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173304631">Hi,<br/>
  My son (5 years old) had a conversation with me last night.  He had <br/>
just dumped a huge bucket of crayons all over the place.  I was <br/>
laying with him in bed and asked him why he did it.  He said it was <br/>
because he was mad at his sister.  I told him that just because he <br/>
was made doesn&#39;t mean he should make a huge mess like that, and he <br/>
said, &quot;Then what SHOULD I do?&quot;  I didn&#39;t know what to suggest except <br/>
going upstairs and punching his pillow.  He thought that was stupid! <br/>
lol  So I told him I would think about it.  Any ideas? What should I <br/>
tell him to do when he&#39;s mad?  <br/>
Thanks, <br/>

&gt;   My son (5 years old) had a conversation with me last night.  He had<br/>
&gt; just dumped a huge bucket of crayons all over the place.  I was<br/>
&gt; laying with him in bed and asked him why he did it.  He said it was<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Does he like to throw things? How about one of those nerf dart boards?<br/>
(Water balloons against the fence work here, but we&#39;re about to be shut out<br/>
of that for the season ;)<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I clean things. &lt;g&gt; Nothing like scrubbing a few guinea pig<br/>
cages to give a woman a calming down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690794660">Here&#39;s what my five year old came up with on her own:  She has a puzzle with<br/>
about 25 pieces (not too hard, not too easy) that she puts together when<br/>
she&#39;s mad.  By the time she finishes she feels better and can talk about<br/>
what&#39;s bothering her.  ~Rue<br/>

Breathe real deep five times.<br/>

run around the outside of the house making hooting noises<br/>
or<br/>
write a note you will save for him to give his sister when they&#39;re grown<br/>
or<br/>
line his shoes up wrong<br/>

draw a picture of the monster he would like to become when he&#39;s angry<br/>

his room and scream... give him an outlet for his anger. Enroll him in Karate <br/>
or taekwondoe. He may think punching a pillow is stupid, but get him in front <br/>
of a bag and have him kick. The only thing Jack says after Karate is, <br/>
&quot;Didcha&#39; see that Mom?&quot; with the biggest grin. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903587735">I think this is an important topic, especially since so many adults seem to struggle with this too. Personally I think the first thing to do is take a deep breath or count to ten and move away from whatever/ or whoever caused the anger, then to go off and do something that can help you calm down - that would greatly depend on the individual - some kids might prefer to do something calm like a puzzle or drawing, while others might need something more active like the trampoline or a punching bag. It would be worth exploring with one&#39;s own child what he/she could do to make him/her calm down. And then lastly I think that it might be a good skill to learn to return after one has calmed down, and use an I message to express your feelings. Especially if another person was involved, but even if the child&#39;s anger was caused by an object, he/she might just like to share his feelings with another person.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Around here the Screaming Tree and the Angry Dance are the two big <br/>
favorites. The Screaming Tree is a tree in the yard that you can go <br/>
and scream at if you feel like it. You can also call it any name you <br/>
want :-). That worked a whole lot better when we had 4 acres around <br/>
us than now when the neighbors are right there. My son still misses <br/>
our old screaming tree, it was apparently much better than our new <br/>
one. But the angry dance is great - you know, jumping up and down and <br/>
shaking your fists while saying things like &quot;I&#39;m SO angry!&quot;. I have <br/>
been known to do that on occasion, which usually sets the kids to <br/>
giggling and gets everyone over it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we have pillows in most rooms of the house - on the couches, <br/>
beds, etc. and those are always good for throwing. Personally, I like <br/>
to either throw things, or go off completely by myself if I&#39;m mad. <br/>
<br/>
My son likes to come and have me squeeze him into a little ball on my <br/>
lap, as if he&#39;s becoming a baby again. Who knows, it works. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter doesn&#39;t want anyone to touch her or talk to her. Today in <br/>
the car she got really upset and angry and she declared it to <br/>
be &quot;Silent Time!!!!&quot; and even had me turn off the radio. After a few <br/>
minutes, she said &quot;You can talk now and have music&quot;, and she was <br/>
totally fine. I thought that was amazing insight for a 3 y.o. She <br/>
constantly blows me away with her self-perception. I think she&#39;s on <br/>
like her 200th incarnation on earth or something, and I&#39;m only on <br/>
number 3.<br/>

Only half in jest - assure him that managing his anger is<br/>
something you value the opportunity to help him with.  Take a<br/>
piece of PVC pipe for bone, build some muscles of batting in<br/>
plastic bags (fascia and &quot;give&quot;) attached to the pipe by running<br/>
strings though the opening (tendon-like), cover with a few more<br/>
layers of batting, then some ultrasuede (skin-like) fabric.  I<br/>
would probably take a big wooden bead, tie a string to it, run<br/>
the string through the pipe and add a label on the other end of<br/>
the string &quot;Johnny&#39;s Hitting Pillow&quot;.<br/>

Then I would have said there are people in prison because they HAD to hit (or <br/>
stab or shoot) something made of skin with bone under it, and he should THINK <br/>
about his instinctive need to hit a human, and then figure out some tricks to <br/>
avoid it for the rest of his life if he wants to stay out of jail, where the <br/>
food is probably really bad.  Not even goldfish and fig newtons.  <br/>

I&#39;ve heard of a prison punishment regime where you get a brick of<br/>
(mostly adulterated) meatloaf for all three meals a day, for a long<br/>
period of time.  <br/>

<br/>
I used to work in the San Diego jail and I saw what and how food was<br/>
served to the inmates.  You are right, it&#39;s enough to scare you straight!<br/>
 The worst were the &quot;sandwiches&quot; served EVERY day, dried out bread and<br/>
bologna, &quot;affectionately&quot; referred to as &quot;Duffy Burgers&quot; (the sheriff&#39;s<br/>
last name being Duffy).<br/>
<br/>
My conclusion from my observations is the jail or prison negatively<br/>
alters a person&#39;s mind.  I think even marginal folks can be damaged<br/>
mentally from incarceration.  The other thought was how much it resembled<br/>
public school. *grin*<br/>
