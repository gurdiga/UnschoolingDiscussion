 </span></blockquote>I have bitten my nails for most of my life. When I have a stressless week or <br/>
so, they start to grow, but the moment the pace of life heats up again, they <br/>
disappear without my even noticing. <br/>
<br/>
When I was just a little older than your son, I really wanted to stop biting <br/>
my nails, and actually managed it for a while.  I did it one nail at a time.<br/>
<br/>
 I resolved that I would really try not to bite the nail on the little finger <br/>
of one hand. (The hand I chewed less.) When that nail grew a bit, I tried not <br/>
to bite the nail on the little finger of the other hand, either. Then added <br/>
the ring finger on the first hand. And so on.  Having a good selection of <br/>
chewable nails helped me maintain the chew-free zone. <br/>
<br/>
Painting the tip of the designated digit with an anti-nailbiting solution <br/>
helps. But you have to keep slashing it on.  Then, once it is length <br/>
enhanced, the nominated nail feels different in the mouth, which also acts as <br/>
a reminder, should it inadvertently enter forbidden territory.<br/>
<br/>
I have always eschewed (ouch) chewing gum - nasty disgusting stuff. But I <br/>
have recently been doing experiments, to see whether chewing gum in the <br/>
privacy of my own home will give me the oral satisfaction gained from <br/>
calorie-laden snacking. Somewhat to my surprise, it seems to work!  So <br/>
perhaps gum could also help with the nail-biting?  Then again, perhaps gum is <br/>
ghastlier........<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-44391833">I have a nephew that used to suck on tags of stuff animals and clothes.<br/>
Everybody used to say things to him and his mom about it, trying to<br/>
discourage him in doing this. I always told her to leave him alone he would<br/>
quite when he wanted too. When he spent the night and his mom would forget<br/>
to put a stuff animal in his night bag Bj would get up and go find him one<br/>
to use for the night. He is 8 now and doesn&#39;t do this anymore. I always felt<br/>
bad for the little guy, his grandmother seemed to pick on him the most. I<br/>
know he started hiding for a while. She and I got into an argument over this<br/>
 she is my sister. I told her that I didn&#39;t see what it was hurting. Well<br/>
anyway, he knows that when he comes to Nana house things are different and<br/>
nobody will make fun of you or bug you about what you do.<br/>
