&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Somehow we got onto reading and he told me that all his <br/>
friends know he is not a good reader and they are OK with it. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed this with Madelyn&#39;s (almost 13) schooled friends as <br/>
well.  <br/>
<br/>
When they were younger, they used to razz her about not knowing <br/>
her &quot;math&quot;.  She did feel bad about it. But about middle school age - <br/>
11 and up, they quit asking her schooly-type questions. No more math <br/>
quizzes or snarky questions about how could she learn <br/>
anything &quot;important&quot; without school.<br/>
<br/>
Are they looking around and thinking maybe being in school isn&#39;t so <br/>
great? Are they questioning the wisdom of all those &quot;great&quot; teachers <br/>
(not the really good ones - the sarcastic ones, the fakey ones, the <br/>
passive-aggressive ones)? Are they realizing there is more to life <br/>
than what is offered in school?<br/>
<br/>
Well - maybe that&#39;s too optimistic. . . . . <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just glad they&#39;ve laid off.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I feel so privileged to be along on this ride. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Ain&#39;t it great?<br/>

exciting things to come along in this neighborhood for a long time. We moved here <br/>
almost 3 years ago and he got many of the pop quizzes you mentioned. However <br/>
since then Tom had been the driving force in a number of construction projects <br/>
carried on in the neighborhood (mostly our garage), a couple of skateboard <br/>
ramps, several versions of hand gliders (to fly THEM, no success yet) and of <br/>
course the house, oh and several trials at springy shoes made out of an old box <br/>
spring. I once overheard him ask an overnight guest from his volleyball team &quot;Do <br/>
you build?&quot; Hmmmm, doesn&#39;t everybody? LOL<br/>

they weren&#39;t very stable.  I just like his break-down-all-the steps approach<br/>
to all of his weird projects.  He does the kind of &quot;science experiments&quot; I<br/>
wish I had been allowed to do as a child, how much shaving cream is in a<br/>
can, how much ink is in a Sharpie etc.  I like his costume projects too,<br/>

We&#39;ve lived here all Madelyn&#39;s life so they knew her then too &lt; g &gt;.  <br/>

It just seemed those elementary years were the hardest when the ps <br/>
kids were getting different information from their school/home than <br/>
the information they were getting here.<br/>
<br/>
One of the coolness factors that Madelyn has now, too, is that she is <br/>
really good at hair, fashion, make-up and clothes. She&#39;s also been to <br/>
modeling school (she did choose to stop attending for awhile so she <br/>
hasn&#39;t finished with that, YET  &lt; g &gt;) and that&#39;s attractive to her <br/>
friends as well.<br/>

Thursday night - and fairly successfully!  Next time it&#39;ll be better -<br/>
faster too, I hope.</div>

(the dog type thing). I had a couple of bags of balloons to practice, I kept <br/>
telling my son to go ahead and make more. He looked up and said &quot;How many <br/>
balloons can I use?&quot; for some reason that just broke my heart, I started thinking of <br/>
the limits we put on things. I told him he could use all of them if he <br/>
wanted. It was so great to watch after that anytime he wanted to see him get out the <br/>
balloons and sometimes the video&#39;s and he would just go at it.<br/>
<br/>
That was really a defining moment for me, I started to think of other ways I <br/>
have put limits on things that we would be so much better off if I didn&#39;t. <br/>
Last night we started making Gingerbread and found out half way into it that we <br/>
didn&#39;t have any molasses. We went ahead and made it with Karo syrup but it was <br/>
yucky so we threw out. That was another step, we can try cooking things we are <br/>
not sure we like and if not we can let it go or give it away. Very freeing.<br/>

Tonight she and I went into the gamingshop to pick Kirby up after work.  <br/>

enough to have their hair that short.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly smiled and shrugged and was friendly, and I said, &quot;She&#39;s not in school. <br/>
That helps.&quot;<br/>

He looked at me like I had entirely changed the subject, and said most women <br/>
wait another ten years before they&#39;re brave enough to have a haircut like <br/>
that, or some such. <br/>

I know he meant it as a compliment, but it was a strangely disjoint (and <br/>

<br/>
She&#39;s 12, and I think if she were in school others would have told her her <br/>
clothes were NOT cool and her haircut was stupid, and so forth.   I remember <br/>
when the kids were really little and Marty had a mohawkish (-ish) thing he had <br/>
designed, and neighbor kids came over and the form of the question was &quot;who has <br/>
that?&quot;  It was asked with potential enthusiasm, and the question was really a <br/>
call for authorization.  Had Marty named a famous athlete, musician or movie <br/>
star whose hair he had copied the kids&#39; next response was going to be an awed <br/>
&quot;coooool!&quot; but as soon as Marty said &quot;I thought it up myself,&quot; they were <br/>
deflated, and prepared (had there been a leader to start it) to say &quot;That&#39;s stupid.&quot; <br/>
 But the next question was &quot;why did you do it?&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Marty said &quot;Because I wanted to!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They were uncomfortable, and the conversation changed.   Maybe it was because <br/>
I was right there.  They had no dialog prepared for the unexpected turn of <br/>
events.   He made a decision on his own without copying, and was not ashamed.<br/>
<br/>
They were literally dumbfounded:  nothing to say.<br/>
<br/>
So they played on the swings. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In school, though, another batch of kids would have come by and eventually <br/>
someone would have made it clear to Marty that his options were to blend in or <br/>
to copy celebrities, and any other behavior was to be shamed right out of him.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting, the range of things I&#39;ve seen having kids who weren&#39;t in <br/>
school.  <br/>

beautiful, it fell to below her knees and was very thick. The guy who cut it was <br/>
amazed at the muscles in her neck, LOL. I really hated going anywhere with her <br/>
as people stopped her all the time to tell her that her hair was really long. <br/>
They were being nice but it became very annoying as she already knew that, LOL<br/>
