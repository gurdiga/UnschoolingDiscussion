<div id="ygrps-yiv-406791172">I have been following the thread about letting kids eat what they want when<br/>
they want.  I have had some interesting experiences with this. I used to<br/>
take my kids&#39; candy after Halloween and Easter and then dole it out to them<br/>
a piece at a time because I thought they would eat it all at once and get<br/>
sick. Then one year I was busy and forgot to take their Halloween candy.<br/>
They each had enough candy to fill a pillowcase. Two of my ds&#39;s had eaten<br/>
all their candy within a couple of days. My dd was able to get hers to last<br/>
for about 2 weeks. My oldest ds made his last until the next Halloween, no<br/>
kidding! After that, I quit regulating their candy stashes. My youngest ds<br/>
still has most of his Easter candy from this year, and they didn&#39;t get very<br/>
much.<br/>
<br/>
Another time, when we had made some homemade oatmeal cookies, my middle ds<br/>
ate so many cookies that he &quot;tossed his cookies!&quot; We had warned him that<br/>
would happen, but he did not heed the warning. He doesn&#39;t like oatmeal<br/>
cookies anymore. But now when we warn any of the kids that they might be<br/>
over doing it, all we have to do is remind them of the cookie incident and<br/>
they at least slow down their consumption.<br/>
<br/>
Another experience with my middle ds, when he was quite young, maybe 3 or 4,<br/>
we had to take him to the ER for bad asthma attack. Everyone else in the ER<br/>
was there for stomach bug. ds was admitted to the hospital for a few days. A<br/>
few days after he got back home, surprise! he had the stomach bug. He lost<br/>
10 lbs! Dr told us to let him eat whatever he wanted, as much as he wanted,<br/>
whenever he wanted after he got well so that he could gain back the weight.<br/>
Just about all he wanted was cold cereal, so we let him eat it for<br/>
everymeal. Interestingly enough, at 13 1/2 yo, cold cereal is still his<br/>
favorite food. He likes very little else and would still like to eat it for<br/>
every meal. But it is too expensive to let him do so, plus when ever he has<br/>
cereal for a meal other than breakfast, his younger brother wants some too.<br/>
Ice cream is his second favorite food. :-)<br/>
