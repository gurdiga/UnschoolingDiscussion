<div id="ygrps-yiv-708402728">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so excited to be a part of this new group.  My name is Mimi.  I <br/>
noticed I&#39;m the 17th member to subscribe to this group.  That <br/>
happens to be my second luckiest number!!  My luckiest number <br/>
is #2.  I was born on 2/2/59.  My sister was born on the same day <br/>
exactly one year later.  I have fraternal twin boys.  After the twins <br/>
were born, it was obvious my new favorite number should be #2.<br/>
<br/>
I originally joined the Unschooling.com list about 1 1/2 weeks <br/>
ago.  Apparantly there was some kind of argument going on <br/>
which I didn&#39;t understand, participate in, or really wanted to find <br/>
out the details about.  Today, I found out about this new list <br/>
Sandra Dodd created.  So, here I am.  It&#39;s exciting for me to come <br/>
in on the ground floor.  <br/>
<br/>
I plan to continue subscribing to the other list.  I&#39;m sure that <br/>
should be OK.  If not, let me know and I&#39;ll drop the other list.<br/>
<br/>
I learned about Unschooling in 1994, after reading John Holt&#39;s <br/>
&quot;Learning All the Time&quot;.  I consider it the most important book I <br/>
have ever read.  It truly changed my life.  My boys are 7 years old <br/>
and are unschooled.  We enjoy life and learning in a very relaxed <br/>
and natural way every day.  <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to learning more about unschooling from you, <br/>
Sandra.  I have read many good things about you.  I wish this <br/>
new list much success.<br/>
<br/>

<br>I don&#39;t want anyone to drop off that list because of this one.
