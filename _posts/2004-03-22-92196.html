<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146419003">I am posting to let all of you know that I have made a list for <br/>
others like me looking to learn how to unschool on less. I know that <br/>
there are some amazing people here that could share how they live and <br/>
what they know. A great deal of shall go into this list and a lot of <br/>
research shall be done to help all of us learn to get what we need as <br/>
we also show our children how to do it. <br/>
<br/>
  Please excuse the newness of the group as I just made it today. I <br/>
am very interested in finding other moderators to help me with this. <br/>

 P.S. Unschooling is not something you do for the kids, it is for the <br/>
family, the future, it is a way of life, it is beautful.</div>
