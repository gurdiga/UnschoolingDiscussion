You have to start somewhere.  Anywhere will do, really, because you won&#39;t<br/>
stay there forever.  Everyone changes, and I can tell you from personal<br/>
experience that I&#39;ve changed a lot from what I&#39;ve read here and elsewhere.<br/>
But take a deep breath and start, somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
It sounded to me like you are struggling a bit with the idea of taking the<br/>
unhappy one out of school while leaving the happy one in school for the time<br/>
being. Why would that be a problem?  Just because you&#39;re committed to an<br/>
idea doesn&#39;t mean it has to happen immediately.  In other words, I think<br/>
it&#39;s possible to really believe that unschooling is the way you want to go<br/>
with your children, but that right now it&#39;s your daughter that needs what<br/>
you can give, and your son will need to wait for a bit.  How is that so<br/>
terribly different than when he&#39;s having fun playing and wants you to see<br/>
his tower right away, but you have to put him on hold while you attend to<br/>
her tears over a bumped head?  You&#39;ll get there, in time.<br/>
<br/>
Check the state folders on unschooling.com for Ohio info; we&#39;ve lived<br/>
several places with the military, but Ohio&#39;s not one of them, so I&#39;ve got no<br/>
idea.  <br/>
<br/>
But good luck getting going, whatever you decide to do.  You CAN do it!<br/>

Oh, yeah.  I know that Brandi&#39;s pair aren&#39;t twins, but many of the<br/>
challenges are the same.  Joining a mother&#39;s of twins group either in<br/>
real life or online might generate some practical suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that if your son and daughter had joined your family at a<br/>
much younger age you&#39;d probably be a pro by now at ignoring one for the<br/>
length of time that it took to deal with the other.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a<br/>
juggling act!<br/>
