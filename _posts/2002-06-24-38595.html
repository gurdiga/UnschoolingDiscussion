<div id="ygrps-yiv-126810127">Hmmm. . I am new to the list so your &quot;reputation&quot; as a horrible parent is<br/>
new to me. However, based on this email, I would say you are a caring,<br/>
loving parent who wants her children to learn some basic safety rules and<br/>
responsibilities. I have 4 kids and if they had done that on their bikes,<br/>
their bikes would also be put away in the attic. As far as laundry goes, we<br/>
aim for them to get it in the right place. It&#39;s not a live or death<br/>
situation if they don&#39;t, but it is a goal. So does this make me a horrible<br/>
parent too? :)<br/>

<br/>
Okay  everyone here has established that i am a horrible parent <br/>
because I require that my children must put their dirty clothes <br/>
(usually a swimsuit)  in the laundry room instead of throwing it on <br/>
the ceiling fan,  and that they should pick their toys up off the <br/>
floor  so I wont catch them in the vacuum.   I work 10 hours a day <br/>
sometimes as much as 5 days a week sometimes.  I clean houses for <br/>
people who never have to take responsibility for anything and I see <br/>
how those people are.  My kids have a privilege of watching <br/>
television (we have to have cable or satelite to watch television <br/>
here and we couldn&#39;t afford it until april so television is new to my <br/>
kids).   Due to unforeseen medical bills of my youngest son we <br/>
probably wont have television much longer.    My youngest child was <br/>
born with hypospadias,  severe reflux, severe allergies  and has <br/>
nearly died several times  because of his illnesses.   I am thankful <br/>
for my children, and I never hit them but I do make them think about <br/>
whether they want the responsibility of things they have.  Last night <br/>
I went riding on bicycles with my kids.  My 7 year old went across a <br/>
street without stopping at a stop sign and my just turned 4 yesterday <br/>
son  tried to follow  but i made him stop.   I told my 7 year old <br/>
that the streets where we were riding have cars come thru them at 45 <br/>
miles an hour and if a car had been coming it couldn&#39;t have stopped <br/>
and probably would have killed him.   I told him to stop and wait for <br/>
me at the next stop sign.  He went thru the next stop sign without <br/>
stopping.   I stopped him and told him that if he did it again he <br/>
could either give me $50 (which i would put in his savings account,   <br/>
that is the amount our police fine bicycles for not stopping at stop <br/>
signs)  or I would take his bike.   He then told me he didn&#39;t know he <br/>
was supposed to stop before the stop sign   he thought he was <br/>
supposed to stop on the other side of the stop sign (this kid has <br/>
been going on bike rides for 4 years and never had a problem until <br/>
last night)  I said fine but the rules still applied   the next <br/>
missed stop sign (if he didn&#39;t stop infront of it) if he wasn&#39;t <br/>
killed by a car I would take the money or the bike.   We were one <br/>
block from home and not in a busy part of town anymore.   The next <br/>
stop sign he slowed down  looked at me and grinned and said &quot;I guess <br/>
you will have to take my bike&quot;  and rode thru the intersection <br/>
without even looking to see if a car was coming.    Now his bike is <br/>
hanging on the wall in the garage.  When he shows he respects safety <br/>
rules enough to ride again  he can have his bike    until then  he <br/>
has to walk while his friends taunt him because they saw him <br/>
disobeying me.  He has been to doctors and therapists and <br/>
everything.  Most agreed that he is just a normal kid who is testing <br/>
the limits.   <br/>
So I am a bad parent---but I would take my son clean socks  if he <br/>
ever wore socks.   I believe children sometimes need guidance whether <br/>
they actually learn from it is up to them,  but if my son really <br/>
wants his bike or whatever  he will need to learn to accept the rules <br/>
first.   If my son really wants to watch Dexter&#39;s lab on television <br/>
he will put his clothes in the laundry room   if he thinks clothes on <br/>
the ceiling fan is better then he wont put his clothes in the laundry <br/>
room   it is up to him.     Is that a better way of saying it.  I <br/>
guess I don&#39;t teach my kids  I let them decide what is important  <br/>
with hope they will see it the same way I do,  but not necessarily <br/>
expecting that they will. <br/>

One bad things school do is they try again and again and again to do things <br/>
in a way that isn&#39;t working.  Then they get angry at the kids when it doesn&#39;t <br/>
work, and angry at the parents if their punishments don&#39;t cause school&#39;s <br/>
methods not to work better.<br/>
<br/>
Informed decisions don&#39;t come from just doing what our parents did without <br/>
examination.  Informed decisions don&#39;t come from batting away the experiences <br/>
of parents whose kids ARE stopping at stop signs, who are bringing their <br/>
clothes to be washed or are washing them themselves without threats.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone here is against informed decisions at ALL!<br/>

setting up artificial situations where they&#39;re punished (e.g., not<br/>
allowed to watch a tv show) for not doing  what you tell them to do.<br/>

Someone sent me the URL for a great website yesterday, it ties right into<br/>
this discussion. The URL is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnvc.org/raisekds.htm,">http://www.cnvc.org/raisekds.htm,</a> and here&#39;s<br/>
a quote that seems to address part of what&#39;s being discussed:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;. So with such a high percentage of the population believing that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>punishment is justified and necessary in the education of children, Ive<br/>
had plenty of opportunity over the years to discuss this issue with<br/>
parents, and Im pleased with how people can be helped to see the<br/>
limitations of any kind of punishment, if theyll simply ask themselves<br/>
two questions.<br/>
<br/>
Question number one: What do you want the child to do differently? If we<br/>
ask only that question, it can certainly seem that punishment sometimes<br/>
works, because certainly through the threat of punishment or application<br/>
of punishment, we can at times influence a child to do what we would like<br/>
the child to do.<br/>
<br/>
However, when we add a second question, it has been my experience that<br/>
parents see that punishment never works. The second question is: What do<br/>
we want the childs reasons to be for acting as we would like them to<br/>
act? Its that question that helps us to see that punishment not only<br/>
doesnt work, but it gets in the way of our children doing things for<br/>
reasons that we would like them to do them.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

found guilty of bad parenting and should do it the way someone else says but<br/>
because of the insistence that certain methods must be employed in order for<br/>
certain results to happen. In this case it&#39;s the insistence that coercion is<br/>
necessary for children to learn responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
It is that assumption that gets challenged. There are people here raising<br/>
their children without coercion, without insisting on chores whose children<br/>
are growing into responsible, thoughtful people. Parenting with coercion is<br/>
a choice not a necessity.<br/>
<br/>
Coercion undoubtedly is necessary to get kids to conform to a standard that<br/>
arises from a parent&#39;s desires rather than natural consequences. For example<br/>
from a child&#39;s point of view there are no natural bad consequences to not<br/>
vacuuming the carpet every week (or month or ...) From a child&#39;s point of<br/>
view there seem to be way more pros to leaving toys out than to putting them<br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
But if a parent insists that everyone in the family must meet a certain<br/>
standard and the rest of the family members have different sets of standards<br/>
then coercion is going to be necessary for one person&#39;s standards to<br/>
override everyone else&#39;s. (A side lesson to this is that a really good<br/>
technique to get your way -- it must be good since parents use it a lot! --<br/>
is to be bigger and stronger and more intimidating.)<br/>
<br/>
But the coercion is for the purposes of getting the parent&#39;s standard met,<br/>
*not* because children need it to turn into decent adults.<br/>
<br/>
(That does *not* leave the only choice as letting the kids&#39; standards<br/>
overrule. There *are* other choices.)<br/>
<br/>
Coercion is *not* the only way to get kids to help. They will do so when<br/>
they feel that their help is appreciated. Coercion probably is the only way<br/>
to get them to help in a certain way with a particular amount on a specific<br/>
time schedule though.<br/>
<br/>
If we look at family and home as our gift to our children on one hand and as<br/>
an equal partnership (without imposing responsibilty since the children<br/>
didn&#39;t choose to enter the partnership) on the other hand, then they *will*<br/>
help when they feel they are necessary and when they feel their help is<br/>
appreciated and is making a contribution. (Age is also a big factor. My 10<br/>
yo daughter voluntarily brings in bags from the car and unloads them all<br/>
onto the table whereas last year it often seemed like I was asking her to<br/>
climb Mt. Everest if I suggested it. ;-) The only difference is age.)<br/>
<br/>
If we treat them as conscripted labor who must help because they live here<br/>
too and mom works provide the life they have, they&#39;ll respond as any adult<br/>
would to that attitude.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a huge psychic difference between &quot;Would you pick these up?&quot; when<br/>
the child knows that &quot;No&quot; isn&#39;t an acceptable answer and &quot;Would you help<br/>
me?&quot; when the child knows that &quot;No&quot; is an acceptable answer. It&#39;s a lot more<br/>
pleasant to help someone out who needs your help than it is to do something<br/>
that you have no choice in. I&#39;ve found a few minutes of volunteered, joyful<br/>
help that I express appreciation over leads to more minutes and more<br/>
volunteering. Though coercing help may get me longer more frequent help,<br/>
it&#39;s only result is getting the job done, not leading to someone more eager<br/>
to help or with whom I have a better relationship.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is sounding way more like a power struggle than a lack of understanding<br/>
of safety. He sees this as a contest of wills between your ability to<br/>
control him and his ability to not be controlled rather than a sensible<br/>
choice between safe and unsafe. In his mind he wins if he gets to defy your<br/>
rules -- regardless of the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
*Especially* in terms of safety, I&#39;d stop playing. I see the goal as helping<br/>
him understand rather than obedience. (Even if it&#39;s obedience to a being<br/>
sensible.) (I think I saw a number of suggestions by others that didn&#39;t<br/>
involve power struggles.)<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people have had good things to say about Raising Your Spirited Child<br/>
by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka (which might be helpful). But she&#39;s also written a<br/>
book called Kids, Parents and Power Struggles that might be even closer to<br/>
being on target.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445029986">Wow, Joyce!  I loved your post that began:<br/>
<br/>
  These parenting discussions arise not because someone is being judged and<br/>
  found guilty of bad parenting and should do it the way someone else says but<br/>
  because of the insistence that certain methods must be employed in order for<br/>

<br/>
  I was getting ready to try to sort the whole thing through myself - but I am so glad you beat me to it!  You did a much clearer job than I would have.  This is an issue that we have been dealing with for awhile.  My 7.5 year old is very strong willed and we have worked at respecting her autonomy - but it is a struggle sometimes to figure out how to get all of our needs met.  Anyway,   aside from books - I have had no one to learn from.  (thank goodness for books!)  I have always known there had to be better ways.  So, we are mindfully working at this.  Some days I do much better than others.  Today, fortunately seems to be one of those better days.  Anyway, thanks for your clear thinking and sharing.  I am pretty new to this list - but I have already benefitted from your previous posts.  I can tell that this list will be a valuable place for me to be.  <br/>
<br/>
  I also wanted to mention that for me the link to cnvc that someone (sorry... I don&#39;t remember which post) included earlier didn&#39;t work. In case others had that problem,  the general website is www.cnvc.org   but I don&#39;t know where in the site that quote is listed.   The quote was: &quot;Question number one:What do you want the child to do differently?  If we ask only that question it can certainly seem that punishment sometimes works, because certainly through the threat of punishment or application of punishment, we can at times influence a child to do what we would like the child to do.  However when we add a second question , it has been my experience that parents see that punishment (I, Deborah, think you can read this as any type of coercion) never works.  The second question is: What do we want the child&#39;s reasons to be for acting as we would like them to act? It&#39;s that question that helps us to see that punishment not only doesn&#39;t work, but it gets in the way of our children doing things for reasons that we would like to do them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  This quote is from my favorite (because for me it is an essential touchstone) parenting book. Actually it is only a 24 page booklet, by Marshall Rosenberg titled &quot;Raising Children Compassionately: Parenting the Nonviolent Communication Way&quot;.<br/>
  Marshall&#39;s ideas are really helpful both for parenting and for all relationships.  I am pretty new to his stuff and it&#39;s going to be an uphill climb for me - but one that I KNOW will be well worth it.  If the quote interests you check out the website. <br/>
<br/>
  Here&#39;s one more quote from that booklet that relates to this topic:<br/>
  &quot;When people hear demands, it looks to them as though our caring and respect and love are conditional.  It looks as though we are only going to care for them as people when they do what we want.&quot;  And, by the way, for those of you new to these ideas, I feel compelled to say that Marshall isn&#39;t recommending &quot;permissive&quot; parenting.  It&#39;s a whole different perspective.   <br/>
<br/>
  Anyway,hope the web link and author source is of help to someone ... and Joyce , thanks again!<br/>
