<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177792827">***It takes away my choice to do those tasks of my own volition and for my own motivations ... it would kill the joy of participating in the household.***<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I can understand this to some point.  How do you inspire this joy of participating in a child?  There are plenty of tasks I do that I don�t like doing in the house, and I know I don�t �HAVE� to do them.  Also, isn�t there an understanding between you and your husband?  Perhaps you�ve never sat down and said �you do this and I�ll do this�, but isn�t the understanding there?  As far as sharing in the money, isn�t that what we all do anyways?  We have a roof over our heads, food on the table, clothes on our backs, and when all our �needs� are met then there is the possibility of having some of our wants met also.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me (tell me if I�m right) that the idea of giving an allowance is an opportunity for a child to learn how to spend their money, how to make choices on what to spend within their �budget�, and how to hopefully evaluate the items they are purchasing and determine their �worth� in the child�s eyes.  That makes sense on many levels.  I guess if that is the case, then you can give a kid an allowance, or you can just wait until they have their own job and ability to make those decisions.  It�ll be a skill learned either way � though I guess the value in doing it small scale is that it hopefully won�t have the long term financial effects of making poor choices as an adult.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
***You&#39;re not eight years old.****<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Correct� I�m not.  However, if I want something extra, I have to find some way to �earn� it or choose to do without, right?  So why is that �wrong� for a child to learn/understand?  Can that not be an important principle � the principle of choice, the principle of making decisions, of trying creative ways to get what you want, or the value in waiting?  If you don�t have to �earn� your money, then what do you do?  How do you get what you want when what you want costs money that you don�t have?  Yes, it�s a choice and a tradeoff you face.  I�m not sure I can see the connection between something like �earning� an A for reading.  That�s a skill that is built and (IMHO) shouldn�t be penalized, but satisfying a want comes under something different � or so I think at this point.  I am open to understanding otherwise.  I just don�t see the connection yet.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
***But to require it as a requirement for being a part of the family, no.***<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don�t require �chores� at all to be part of the family.  You are family no matter what.  How could it be otherwise?  I would love to have her help, but I don�t know how to get her to without fighting or cajoling.  She has no want to help, and sees no value in doing so.  Perhaps I have done something wrong.  I don�t know.  At the same time, I just didn�t see what would be wrong with making a deal with her� i.e. if you clean the bathroom I�ll pay you $X amount a week/time�   And true, you may be able to goof off once in a while and get paid, but if you do it often enough or don�t show up at all then they eventually get rid of you.<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m just trying to understand.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t give my kids an allowance as such.  Actually HUBBY gets one, just <br/>
because I do all the family shopping and he really only has to cover himself.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it this way:  you are at a bookstore and your child asks for a <br/>
sticker book.  You are buying a magazine and a bestseller.  You tell him <br/>
no, he doesn&#39;t have enough money.  What is he learning?  To save his <br/>
money?  Or that what you buy for yourself is more important?  Do you really <br/>
take the time to explain that you didn&#39;t buy something the other day to be <br/>
able to buy the book?  Or do you put the book back and buy his stickers?<br/>
<br/>
I think putting the book back shows the &quot;lesson&quot; better, as well as showing <br/>
that you are really all in it together.<br/>
