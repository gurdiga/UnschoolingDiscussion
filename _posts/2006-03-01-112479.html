<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579862274">I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve posted here before, so I&#39;ll supply a brief intro <br/>
to those who don&#39;t know me from unschooling.com and .info.<br/>
<br/>
I am mom to two girls, 13-1/2 and almost 12. We have been <br/>
unschooling for just over 3 years; the girls were in public school <br/>
before that where they were neither unhappy nor inspired. Questions <br/>
like &quot;Is this as good as it gets?&quot; led us to try homeschooling. I <br/>
think we had one math lesson before settling happily into <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Our usual arrangement is for my dh-of-16-years to be home with the <br/>
girls while I am at work, and we live in Western Washington, but <br/>
every so often we take off on a family adventure. Our most recent <br/>
was living aboard a sailboat in the Gulf of Mexico during the worst <br/>
hurricane season ever. (Details are here: <br/>
www.zombieprincess.blogspot.com) I suspect we&#39;ll go back to <br/>
roadtrips now! :-)<br/>
<br/>
My younger daughter is headed to Summerhill for their summer term <br/>
(May to July). Not sure how I will get by without her, but I&#39;m very <br/>
pleased that she gets to realize this dream. And I get a trip to <br/>
England out of the deal.<br/>
<br/>
My older daughter is in a really wonderful and amazing period of <br/>
discovery. She read TTLH recently and has really taken charge of her <br/>
life and learning since then. It&#39;s amazing to watch, though I&#39;m <br/>
scrambling a bit to keep up with and support her big ol&#39; pile of new <br/>
interests.<br/>
<br/>
Life at our house is very busy these days, but So Good. Love it!<br/>

but we have to be there by July (by June really, but nobody is coming<br/>
to see our house..), so if you want a place not too far away to stop<br/>
and stay, and a bit more accomodating than a self-accomodating<br/>
cottage...Although, having just gone to Summerhill and looked at the<br/>
map, it may be a bit more of a trek than I thought.  Anyhow, you and<br/>
yours are welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I rarely listen to the radio in the car, but yesterday I happened to,  <br/>
and they were advertising summer classes (&quot;academics, arts and  <br/>
sports&quot;) at Albuquerque Academy.  I think I&#39;ll at least get the  <br/>
schedule and see if Holly might want to do that.<br/>
<br/>
I went to summer school twice, before 9th grade because I was going  <br/>
to skip 9th grade (but ended up deciding not to) and then again after  <br/>
10th so I could graduate early (and to hang around with my friend  <br/>
Jon, who had failed English &lt;g&gt;).   Those sessions were GREATâ€”more  <br/>
informal, I was meeting kids I wouldn&#39;t have hung out with otherwise,  <br/>
things were at a faster pace, I walked to school in the beautiful  <br/>
summer mornings.<br/>
<br/>
Holly wouldn&#39;t get the same contrast, but her contrast would be even  <br/>
greater if she went.  She&#39;s wanted to go to school, but not really.   <br/>
She wants the experiences without the commitment or pressure, and  <br/>
this might be a great way to go.<br/>
<br/>
I think summer sessions of regular public school might be hard,  <br/>
because she would be around kids who were in dispair, under pressure,  <br/>
or very hostile.  Some of those could risk being a distillation of  <br/>
the worst of school, and some teacher shame the summer school kids  <br/>
too.  My half brother went to summer school (started to and ditched  <br/>
out after a while) and it was harsh.<br/>
<br/>
I know I changed the subject from going to England to Summerhill.   <br/>
That&#39;s a resort school. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
But even local summer school sessions might be something for those  <br/>
kids who have the big &quot;What&#39;s school like?&quot; curiosities.  I doubt  <br/>
that summer school sessions involve fully registering with a district  <br/>
at ALL because of so many kids who aren&#39;t in their regular districts  <br/>
in the summer.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Schuyler! That&#39;s a very nice offer. If current plans hold, <br/>
I&#39;ll be there only in April, and Chloe will come home on her last day <br/>
of term in July. But we&#39;ll keep you in mind if this becomes a <br/>
recurring thing! (Although my heart and pocketbook certainly hope it <br/>
doesn&#39;t!! ;-))<br/>
