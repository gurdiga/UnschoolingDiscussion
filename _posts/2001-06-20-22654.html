<div id="ygrps-yiv-304013342">are you referring to Genevieve Foster&#39;s books--Julius Caesar&#39;s World, George Washington&#39;s World, Chris. Columbus&#39; World etc?  They are horizontal histories--telling stories of the title of the book people and of others around the world who lived at the same time. <br/>
