<h4>Nora or Devereaux Cannon</h4>
<time> 3 Jan 2003, at  6:36am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-340560075">Annette raised it in the context of a poem graded for its<br/>
compliance with pencil/double space, but I have seen other,<br/>
similar comments about generally clue free interactions with kids<br/>
by those with some authority.  I have always thought that a<br/>
goodly part of raising a child who can think is to help them<br/>
distinguish between valid and invalid thinking in others.  The<br/>
needlessly cruel and inane provide great fodder for &quot;lab work&quot;,<br/>
so long as you don&#39;t yourself become gossips and slanderers.<br/>
Indeed sometimes in thinking about why someone did/said what they<br/>
did you can forgive them.<br/>
<br/>
My personal best example of parenting to think was by my mother<br/>
when I was in 8th grade.  There was a writing contest; the<br/>
English teacher assigned us all to write for the contest.<br/>
<br/>
I got into the topic; researched it; decided that the answer to<br/>
&quot;what can be done&quot; was &quot;not a bloody thing - nobody can agree on<br/>
what the goal is&quot;;  got an &quot;F&quot; for content; independently<br/>
submited the paper, with the &quot;F&quot; on top; won first prize; was<br/>
accompanied to the awards banquet by the English teacher; had my<br/>
picture in the newspaper with the award, the paper (&quot;F&quot; visible),<br/>
English teacher, and Society president; learned many, many<br/>
things.</div>

<br/>
WOW.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a heck of a story.  You could sell it.<br/>
Was there discussion or interview at the time about why the teacher gave you <br/>
an &quot;F&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
It would have been kind of cool (and if you wanted to) for you to refuse to <br/>
be accompanied by that teacher, and just say &quot;No, you don&#39;t get to go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What an empowering situation for you.  HA!<br/>
I wonder if the teacher still has bad dreams about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729790069">And then I remember a story about the guy who started Fed Ex (or UPS) got an F for the idea in a <br/>
college economics class or something like that. The professor felt that it was a terrible <br/>

&lt;&lt;Obviously the guy did not listen. :o) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he listened very closely to all his professor said, and thought &quot;This <br/>
guy is full of it!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe the professor&#39;s critique gave him all the good arguments he  needed <br/>
to overcome those &quot;professional objections,&quot; as debate does.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one reason people who unschool and who rub their ideas up against <br/>
other unschoolers&#39; ideas come to win their arguments with relatives and <br/>
neighbors.  They&#39;ve already heard the objections and other arguments.  <br/>
They&#39;ve practiced seeing clearly what they want to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016939282">It was very much empowering - and I never would have done it if<br/>
my mother hadn&#39;t encouraged me to test the validity of the<br/>
teacher&#39;s opinion, accompanied by lots of discussion of why she<br/>
might not like an essay that broke the stereotypes.  Trying to<br/>
decide whether to bring her to the ceremony was hard.  Either<br/>
choice would do damage to her that could be seen as unkind.  It<br/>
seemed that letting her come was the lest likely to cause her<br/>
public harm and most likely to cause her to reflect on what she<br/>
had done to a child - but it was a subject of some long &quot;moral<br/>
choosing&quot; discussions at the kitchen counter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497744175">Fred Smith - and moreover, when he was trying to solve the<br/>
problem of how to get packages from place to place quickly, he<br/>
ultimately threw up his hands at the mathematical models and<br/>
turned to a local art school.  He asked one of the profs to let<br/>
him pose his problem to the students, who drew solutions.  The<br/>
guy who came up with the hub and spoke solution that is still<br/>
used by Fed-X went on to be faculty at the Memphis College of<br/>
Art, where I had him as an instructor.<br/>
