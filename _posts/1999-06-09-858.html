&lt;&lt; I have been where you are and it is NOT fun.<br/>
  I also have to send in a &quot;brief outline&quot; of the intended curriculum for <br/>
the<br/>
  current year.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In Ohio, when we notify(we are notifying of our intent to educate our<br/>
children at home, not asking permission!!!), we have to submit our<br/>
_intendend_ curriculum.The operative word is intednded--things change, and<br/>
life presents us with all kinds of opportunities and challenges. Some folks<br/>
just copy from World Bk Encyclopedia&#39;s typical Course of Study K-12.  I used<br/>
to sweat about it until i realized that they really don&#39;t care--so i write a<br/>
brief narrative statement about continuing our explorations in xyz, using<br/>
educationally and developmentally appropriate materials, etc. I don&#39;t expect<br/>
problems and have never had them!!<br/>
   DEbra&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We kept &quot;residency&quot; in IN to avoid all that &quot;crap&quot;  & paperwork; but I have <br/>
to pass on this from a Hser here in NH.<br/>
She was all hyped up trying to meet their deadline to submit their intended <br/>
curriculum & materials.  She stayed up late to finish it and in the morning <br/>
turned it in.  When handing it to the superintendent&#39;s secretary (or whoever <br/>
it was)  she  bearly looked up from her desk,didn&#39;t even pause from her own <br/>
paperwork, said &quot;Oh, thanks.&quot; and opened her drawer, shoving it in a file.<br/>
HMMM  wonder if anyone even read it?<br/>
