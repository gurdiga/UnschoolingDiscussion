<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667288536">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure who the parent of the teen is who started the <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Unschoolingteens@yahoogroups.com">Unschoolingteens@yahoogroups.com</a> is and I don&#39;t have the time to go back into the archives to <br/>
find out who the parent is.  So, I am sending this to the group in hopes the <br/>
proper person will read this.<br/>
<br/>
I mean to sound prudish, but, my DD, 17, came to me tonight w/concerns over a <br/>
couple of posts that she really thought were/are inappropriate; I have to <br/>
agree.  I have cut/pasted them to this group ONLY for the purpose that I am <br/>
HOPING the parent of the teen who started this group will read it.  I KNOW the <br/>
teens like their privacy and all, BUT, I do think this needs to be moderated a <br/>
bit.  Anyway, following are the post(s):<br/>

16?<br/>
Shyrley&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Age of Consent for heterosexual activity is 16 in Australia as I<br/>
recall, and I guess from your remark in UK also. However in the USA it<br/>
varies from State to State, and with or without parental consent, and<br/>
seems to be mostly 16 or 17 or 18. Young as 14 with parental consent in<br/>
some places. Homosexual varies from &quot;illegal&quot; to 18 to 21. I found<br/>
charts about worldwide ages when I Googled. <br/>
<br/>
I hope if the teens don&#39;t like a thread they skip it, just like we might<br/>
on our list.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the parent was concerned that there might be pedophiles<br/>
masquerading as Unschooling teens and posting to the list?<br/>
