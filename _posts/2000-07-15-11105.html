went veggie. Your fertility drops off conciderably at this age. Many women<br/>
are in the early stages of menopause at 40 and prob. don&#39;t ovulate every<br/>

&gt; This is an interesting discussion -- I had no idea there were so many<br/>
&gt; non-meat-eaters out there! When I was in college I gave up meat for a<br/>
year,<br/>
&gt; or tried to -- I found I just had to have a hamburger or steak about once<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; month! Similarly when I was pregnant I had a real longing for eggs! I<br/>
guess<br/>
&gt; I just needed that extra protein. The Bradley books I read said many<br/>
&gt; pregnant women don&#39;t get enough.<br/>

Early menopause usually only starts if you have never been pregnant.  Once <br/>
pregnant and delivery of child has taken place you push back the age when <br/>
menopause begins.  However I do agree that it sounds unlikely that being <br/>
vegetarian would bring out no conception.  My best friend in England has been <br/>
vegetarian for 15 years and got pregnant (by &quot;accident&quot; which of course there <br/>
isn&#39;t such a thing if you are having sex willingly) just after her 40th <br/>
birthday for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents<br/>
