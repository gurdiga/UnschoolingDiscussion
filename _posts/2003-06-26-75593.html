<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753116009">After I post this, I will slide back into lurkdom where I have been <br/>
for the past several months.  I will go back to sifting and sorting <br/>

interest me.   I went to the unschooling.com web site, and the <br/>
definitions of unschooling on there all seem to be very reasonable <br/>
and appropiate.  As a matter of fact, I am pretty sure I found this <br/>
group by browsing on that web site.   <br/>

<br/>
&quot;Unschooling is primarily about process not content. The <br/>
process of learning, the process of knowing yourself, openness, <br/>
confidence, self-determination, independent thinking, critical <br/>
thinking....none of which one gets when following other people&#39;s <br/>
agenda. Making one&#39;s own agenda is what it is all about. Again <br/>
this is done not in isolation but in the context of ones family and <br/>
community. -Joel Hawthorne &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;None of which one gets when following other people&#39;s <br/>
agenda...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think that is what was missing from my unschooling <br/>
experience. I had to consider every agenda I had, not just the <br/>
ones for the 3 Rs. And I discovered that many of my agendas <br/>
(that I had felt were reasonablecertain chores, times for bed, <br/>
amounts of time on the Internet, how often they could go out with <br/>
friends for parties...) were actually draining energy from my kids&#39; <br/>
ability to conduct their own learning.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s taken me six months to see the huge amount of influence I&#39;ve <br/>
had on how my kids manage their time. <br/>
<br/>
Quick example and then I&#39;ll shut up:<br/>
<br/>
Just last night I was getting dinner ready. The little guys were <br/>
busy playing, my oldest was just home from Shakespeare camp <br/>
and tired and my middle son was in some other room. My 13 <br/>
yodd was sitting at the computer reading Harry Potter and typing <br/>
IMs. I said, (can&#39;t believe it now), &quot;Honey, since you&#39;re not doing <br/>
anything, can you help me set the table?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
She looked up and said, &quot;So you think reading a book and IMing <br/>
means I&#39;m not doing anything? Is that how you see it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nailed! My need for help setting the table seems reasonable. <br/>
Like so many things. But it was interfering with her learning right <br/>
then! (She did help me because she&#39;s a great kid and had been <br/>
reading all day. But the issue was how I viewed her reading and <br/>
IMing...)<br/>
<br/>
Until the last six months on this list, I hadn&#39;t seen how my <br/>
agenda stood in their way. I&#39;ve had to stop seeing life through my <br/>
eyes and start looking through my kids&#39;... totally... before I could <br/>
imagine the impact my parenting practices were having on my <br/>
unschooling attempts.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s been the sometimes shocking and confronting posts of <br/>
this list that have helped me to do that incrementally, little by little.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Julie, I am on my way....but still quite a few months behind you.  Still <br/>
having struggles with old parenting ways, but what you said almost made me cry.  I <br/>
think back at our homeschooling life and all the curriculums we&#39;ve used, all <br/>
the new programs that came down the tube that we HAD to try...constantly <br/>
worrying about whether the kids knew this or that.  <br/>
<br/>
My biggest regret (and I know I need to stop beating myself up over it) is <br/>
that I hadn&#39;t started much sooner, when my oldest was still at home.  I&#39;ve <br/>
&quot;raised&quot; some great kids, but I just wonder how much more awesome they could be, or <br/>
more how much better they&#39;d feel about themselves, if I had started <br/>
unschooling and changed my parenting style when they were little.  <br/>
<br/>
And more often than not, I DIDN&#39;T look through my kids eyes.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
trying to do this so much more lately.  Sometimes I&#39;ll just watch them when they <br/>
don&#39;t know I&#39;m looking and I try and guess what they&#39;re thinking at that moment. <br/>
 I am asking them everyday how they feel, what they need, what they like, <br/>
dislike,...the amount of conversation between us all has tripled.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Yes, me too, I totally agree!  I like the honest, direct approach, it gets <br/>

<br/>
There will be another couple of lists announced soon, I hear, and none of <br/>
them appealed to me.  Those who want politically correct tip-toeing and tea-party <br/>
chitchat [no-hostess teaparty bar? &lt;g&gt; rank-free teaparty? (good luck on <br/>
that)] will have a safe place to go, and maybe people who DO like this list will <br/>
feel safer here too.<br/>
