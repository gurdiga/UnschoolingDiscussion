<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947939708">I just ordered some things from the Vat19 site (a wedding gift for a  <br/>
friend, and a few things for us).  I&#39;ve ordered before from them and  <br/>
their stuff is really good.<br/>
<br/>
A few things reminded me of recent questions on this list or  <br/>
somewhere.  If someone sees this and knows that the questions were  <br/>
asked on another list or forum, please pass it on if the person might  <br/>
miss this.  I kinda think it was all on this forum, though--questions  <br/>
about helping kids get to sleep, and to learn yo-yo tricks (not all at  <br/>
once) &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

Videos with art projects, some from other cutlures, and two videos on  <br/>
yoyo tricks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For helping people get to sleep:<br/>

Maybe you could say &quot;If you&#39;re still awake when the video ends, come  <br/>
and wake me up.&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s not likely to be a deal they take you up on.<br/>
<br/>
I bought this one for Kirby and his roommate when they went together  <br/>
to get a giant screen TV:<br/>

I bet that would work as well, for sleeping, or the aquarium DVD.<br/>
