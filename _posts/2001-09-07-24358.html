&lt;&lt; Nicki, I apologize if I&#39;ve seemed to be targeting you in any way -- I<br/>
 frequently lose track of who I&#39;m talking to &lt;g&gt; in these discussions and<br/>
 tend to just clip what seems relevant to me at the time, regardless of<br/>
 poster.<br/>
 <br/>
 I have no reason to believe I&#39;d be steering clear of you.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Me too.  I got charged for it when my son was born.  I told them I could<br/>
 prove it - that it wasn&#39;t done!  They took it off the bill. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   I really dissected my bill too. They charged me a nursery charge for 2 <br/>
days. DD was w/ me the whole time. I wasn&#39;t as successful though they refused <br/>
to remove the charge. So I paid them $10 a month for 4 years. I was so pissed.<br/>
