to <br/>
discuss this.<br/>

Try _www.alternativeeducationinstitute.org_ <br/>
(http://www.alternativeeducationinstitute.org) .   My kids are registered here and we do what we want, just <br/>
count days and don&#39;t  even keep a portfolio.  It&#39;s in Davie, Florida, and listed <br/>
as a private  school, which means you can homeschool any way you want under it.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
