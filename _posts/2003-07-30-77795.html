National Legislation -<br/>
H.R. 2732, HONDA<br/>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
Ann:  The Home School Non-Discrimination Act of 2003 is the news of <br/>
the day. An &quot;omnibus&quot; bill such as this one takes awhile to sort out <br/>
and comprehend.  H.R. 2732 proposes amending a number of different <br/>
laws, and I have been digging into discussions that explore various <br/>
aspects and ramifications of this bill. Here is some &quot;in the news&quot; <br/>
info to get you started on your own research.<br/>
<br/>
The bill begins:  &quot;108th Congress, 1st Session, H.R. 2732, to amend <br/>
selected statutes to clarify existing Federal law as to the treatment <br/>
of students privately educated at home under State law.&quot;  Read it in <br/>

Family News in Focus, By David Brody, July 16<br/>

Headline:  Home-Schooling Protection Bill Introduced<br/>
&quot;Chris Klicka and his group - the Home School Legal Defense <br/>
Association - wrote the bill... The bill has a chance of passage. It <br/>
has the support of House Education and Workforce Committee Chairman <br/>
John Boehner, which should ensure it has life through the legislative <br/>
process. Supporters say even if the whole bill doesn&#39;t pass, they <br/>
plan to attach certain parts of it to different education bills to <br/>
move their agenda forward.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ann:  Not all homeschoolers believe this bill is a good one. On July <br/>
28, Helen Hegener posted her position on the HEM-Networking list. <br/>
Here is a small quote: &quot;But there&#39;s an even larger question to ask, <br/>
and that is: Why the move to strengthen the power of the federal <br/>
government over what has always been a state concern? <br/>
Constitutionally, education is the province of the states, and bills <br/>
like this one force a conflict between the federal government and <br/>
state governments.&quot;<br/>

HEM News & Commentary is a weekly report on what&#39;s happening in the <br/>
world of homeschooling. Gleanings from the news media, accolades and <br/>
pans, hot discussions, legal and legislative successes and problems - <br/>
all are fair game, and gathered in one column for your convenience.<br/>
<br/>
And just in case you don&#39;t have the time to read every word in print, <br/>
we will summarize and discuss key news and trends that we think are <br/>
the most provocative or that may have the greatest impact on the <br/>
future of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
This service is available free. Archives can be accessed at<br/>

<br/>
The weekly updates will additionally be announced on HEM&#39;s discussion <br/>
lists. You&#39;ll find a print version - the highlights of these reports <br/>
- in a column by the same name in Home Education Magazine.<br/>
