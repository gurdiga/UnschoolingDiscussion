<br/>
&gt; I originally filed an R-4 when we first started homeschooling, however, we<br/>
&gt; were having severe problems wth some neighbors who threatened to call CPS<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; us on almost a daily basis. I researched the charter school and after<br/>
talking<br/>
&gt; to other homeschoolers we decided to go ahead and sign up with the charter<br/>
&gt; school as they provided us protection if/when CPS was called on us. I<br/>
believe<br/>
&gt; it was the day after we signed the paperwork with the charterschool I had<br/>
CPS<br/>
&gt; call me on the phone saying someone called them to report that my children<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; not go to school. I gave them the phone number of the Educational<br/>
Specialist<br/>
&gt; and it was dropped at that. We signed up in the middle of last &quot;school<br/>
year&quot;.<br/>
&gt; By the end of the school year I again had CPS at my door, the same<br/>
neighbors<br/>
&gt; called on me again. This time CPS kept on us for a while and then<br/>
eventually<br/>
&gt; said they found nothing wrong and left us alone. Just yesterday I had the<br/>
&gt; police called on me by the same people again, accusing me of child neglect<br/>
&gt; becaue my children are outside playing instead of &quot;inside the house<br/>
&gt; learning&quot;. The policeman came out, took down our school information,<br/>
checked<br/>
&gt; to make sure my children were in no danger. He in fact came up as we were<br/>
&gt; engaged in a game, laughing and having a great time together. Although I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t feel I have to explain myself to anyone about why we do what we do,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s what is working for us. I would much rather signup with the<br/>
&gt; charterschool for now and have the protection from the trouble my<br/>
neighbors<br/>
&gt; are trying to cause then to loose my children to the kidnappers desguised<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; a governmetn agency.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for unschooling in the charter, as Sandra Dodd said, some charters work<br/>
&gt; hard to allow unschooling. The way it works is as we go about our<br/>
unschooling<br/>
&gt; lives I write down the &quot;educational activities&quot; my children do engage in<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; these are categorized by subjects. Once a month I meet with our<br/>
Educational<br/>
&gt; Specialist and I give her the information. Twice a year I turn over a<br/>
&gt; portfolio of samples of my childrens work. The portfolio we turned in last<br/>
&gt; year was pretty much photographs and tape recordings of my children. I<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; in any way encourage my children to pursue any specific areas of learning,<br/>
&gt; but I do notate what they do pursue and give that information over to the<br/>
&gt; charter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If anyone wants to consider us not unschooling, then that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ve<br/>
never<br/>
&gt; said I&#39;m a &quot;pure&quot; unschooler and really don&#39;t want any such title. I<br/>
perfer<br/>
&gt; to call ourselves natural learners, if we have to call ourselves anythign<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; all. We do what works for us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-395597571">You can get one for anything that is considered harassment which would<br/>
include the kind of &quot;over the fence&quot; or &quot;in your face&quot; kind of thing<br/>
because, and these are the words you use, &quot;the ongoing harassment has<br/>
deprived us of the enjoyment of our home and a minimum quality of life as<br/>
guaranteed under the Constitution.&quot;  You can also include things about<br/>
having to plan all your activities around a fear that they will call CPS yet<br/>
one more time and that CPS will decide to remove your children from your<br/>
home not based on any (oh geez, I&#39;m brain dead after watching all that<br/>
horror on telelvision today, how do you spell that word that means<br/>
substantial) [  ] evidence but simply based on the shere volume of the<br/>
calls.<br/>
<br/>
If asked how you know the calls came from this neighbor you inform the court<br/>
that the neighbor has continuously told you they would call and each time<br/>
they have &quot;threatened&quot; (you want to use that word) you, the threat has been<br/>
followed by a visit from CPS.<br/>
<br/>
No one should have to take that kind of harassment simply because they are<br/>
making a life style choice that is different from someone else&#39;s!<br/>
<br/>
If you decide to go forward with a temp and then a permanent RO, you can<br/>
contact me off list for help with the forms.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the grounds for a TRO is different than filing a criminal complaint.<br/>
With a TRO you don&#39;t have to have physical evidence and you don&#39;t have to<br/>
prove they did it, you just have to a reasonable belief that they are the<br/>
cause of the problem.  A reasonable person would believe that since they<br/>
threatened you and the threat was carried out, then the person doing the<br/>
threatening was the one that carried out the threat.  If it had happened<br/>
only once, then you couldn&#39;t get one but has you have numerous incidents and<br/>
all you have to do is build a pattern of behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, like anything in the legal system, this comes with a disclaimer<br/>
&lt;g&gt;   This works in 99.9% of the cases but every now and again you get a<br/>
quirky judge who won&#39;t give you a final.  Usually if they deny the FRO, they<br/>
will give both parties a little lecture and then they will threaten the<br/>
party you is to be restrained with one of those little &quot;if it happens again<br/>
I will issue this, be warned&quot; speeches.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001080821">There is case law about being able to enjoy your home and that if someone<br/>
deprives you of that enjoyment by harassment or threats that you can recover<br/>
punitive damages.  It is also grounds for a restraining order.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve used it succesfully for some of the folks we have helped that were<br/>
ex-offenders.  Neighbors couldn&#39;t be bothered to find out why they had been<br/>
in jail/prison, just that they had made them fair game for harassment.  So<br/>
we went after the blankety blanks and that is what our lawyer who<br/>
volunteered advise told us to do and it worked.<br/>

&gt; &gt; CPS<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; call me on the phone saying someone called them to report that my<br/>
&gt; children<br/>
&gt; &gt; do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not go to school. I gave them the phone number of the Educational<br/>
&gt; &gt; Specialist<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and it was dropped at that. We signed up in the middle of last &quot;school<br/>
&gt; &gt; year&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; By the end of the school year I again had CPS at my door, the same<br/>
&gt; &gt; neighbors<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; called on me again. This time CPS kept on us for a while and then<br/>
&gt; &gt; eventually<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; said they found nothing wrong and left us alone. Just yesterday I had<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; police called on me by the same people again, accusing me of child<br/>
&gt; neglect<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; becaue my children are outside playing instead of &quot;inside the house<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; learning&quot;. The policeman came out, took down our school information,<br/>
&gt; &gt; checked<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to make sure my children were in no danger. He in fact came up as we<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; engaged in a game, laughing and having a great time together. Although<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t feel I have to explain myself to anyone about why we do what we<br/>
&gt; do,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s what is working for us. I would much rather signup with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; charterschool for now and have the protection from the trouble my<br/>
&gt; &gt; neighbors<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are trying to cause then to loose my children to the kidnappers<br/>
&gt; desguised<br/>
&gt; &gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a governmetn agency.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As for unschooling in the charter, as Sandra Dodd said, some charters<br/>
&gt; work<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hard to allow unschooling. The way it works is as we go about our<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lives I write down the &quot;educational activities&quot; my children do engage<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; these are categorized by subjects. Once a month I meet with our<br/>
&gt; &gt; Educational<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Specialist and I give her the information. Twice a year I turn over a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; portfolio of samples of my childrens work. The portfolio we turned in<br/>
&gt; last<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; year was pretty much photographs and tape recordings of my children. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in any way encourage my children to pursue any specific areas of<br/>
&gt; learning,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but I do notate what they do pursue and give that information over to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; charter.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If anyone wants to consider us not unschooling, then that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; never<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; said I&#39;m a &quot;pure&quot; unschooler and really don&#39;t want any such title. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; perfer<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to call ourselves natural learners, if we have to call ourselves<br/>
&gt; anythign<br/>
&gt; &gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all. We do what works for us.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; There is case law about being able to enjoy your home and that if someone<br/>
&gt; deprives you of that enjoyment by harassment or threats that you can<br/>
recover<br/>
&gt; punitive damages.  It is also grounds for a restraining order.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve used it succesfully for some of the folks we have helped that were<br/>
&gt; ex-offenders.  Neighbors couldn&#39;t be bothered to find out why they had<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; in jail/prison, just that they had made them fair game for harassment.  So<br/>
&gt; we went after the blankety blanks and that is what our lawyer who<br/>
&gt; volunteered advise told us to do and it worked.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Lynda,<br/>
&gt; &gt; is this a state law that constitutes harassment? I was  in a similar<br/>
&gt; &gt; situation a few years back and ended up moving to get away from an<br/>
&gt; &gt; interfering neighbor. I wish I could have used this as a defense.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just an aside to this issue, three *unfounded* complaints from your<br/>
&gt; &gt; neighbor<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; constitutes harassment and you can get a restraining order against<br/>
them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The paperwork is easy to fill out and a fee waiver would cover all<br/>
costs<br/>
&gt; &gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; most costs.  A judge can issue an order to CPS requiring that any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; complaintants against you be required, in the future, to identify<br/>
&gt; &gt; themselves<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and be made aware that false charges can and will be prosecuted.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We helped a woman locally get such an order.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I originally filed an R-4 when we first started homeschooling,<br/>
&gt; however,<br/>
&gt; &gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were having severe problems wth some neighbors who threatened to<br/>
call<br/>
&gt; &gt; CPS<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us on almost a daily basis. I researched the charter school and<br/>
after<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; talking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to other homeschoolers we decided to go ahead and sign up with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; charter<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; school as they provided us protection if/when CPS was called on us.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was the day after we signed the paperwork with the charterschool<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; CPS<br/>

whole world!  Guess we got spoiled.  We shared Christmas gifts and she used<br/>
to bring the kidlets home little souvenirs from her travels.  She got lung<br/>
cancer and then mets to the brain.  We were heart broken.  Such a sweet lady<br/>
all ways around.<br/>
<br/>
Then the neighbor from h*ll bouht the house.  A really psychotic woman who<br/>
decided that she owned the alley between the houses and that everyone else<br/>
on the alley had to pay her rent!  Would you believe she actually fenced off<br/>
the alley (which btw belongs to the city) and then when the cops came and<br/>
told her to take it down she threw herself in the road and had a screaming<br/>

&gt; Good thing to keep in mind. Our new home is on ten acres and so far we<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; wonderful neighbors. Hopefully it will stay this way. I hated living next<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; people who thought their whole purpose in life was to tell other people<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; they should be living. That is a very oppressive way to live.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There is case law about being able to enjoy your home and that if<br/>
someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; deprives you of that enjoyment by harassment or threats that you can<br/>
&gt; recover<br/>
&gt; &gt; punitive damages.  It is also grounds for a restraining order.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We&#39;ve used it succesfully for some of the folks we have helped that were<br/>
&gt; &gt; ex-offenders.  Neighbors couldn&#39;t be bothered to find out why they had<br/>
&gt; been<br/>
&gt; &gt; in jail/prison, just that they had made them fair game for harassment.<br/>
So<br/>
&gt; &gt; we went after the blankety blanks and that is what our lawyer who<br/>
&gt; &gt; volunteered advise told us to do and it worked.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Lynda,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is this a state law that constitutes harassment? I was  in a similar<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; situation a few years back and ended up moving to get away from an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; interfering neighbor. I wish I could have used this as a defense.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just an aside to this issue, three *unfounded* complaints from your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; neighbor<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constitutes harassment and you can get a restraining order against<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The paperwork is easy to fill out and a fee waiver would cover all<br/>
&gt; costs<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; most costs.  A judge can issue an order to CPS requiring that any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complaintants against you be required, in the future, to identify<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and be made aware that false charges can and will be prosecuted.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We helped a woman locally get such an order.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I originally filed an R-4 when we first started homeschooling,<br/>
&gt; &gt; however,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were having severe problems wth some neighbors who threatened to<br/>
&gt; call<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; CPS<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us on almost a daily basis. I researched the charter school and<br/>
&gt; after<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to other homeschoolers we decided to go ahead and sign up with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; charter<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; school as they provided us protection if/when CPS was called on<br/>
us.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was the day after we signed the paperwork with the<br/>
charterschool<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CPS<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; call me on the phone saying someone called them to report that my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; children<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not go to school. I gave them the phone number of the Educational<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Specialist<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and it was dropped at that. We signed up in the middle of last<br/>
&gt; &quot;school<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the end of the school year I again had CPS at my door, the same<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neighbors<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called on me again. This time CPS kept on us for a while and then<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eventually<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said they found nothing wrong and left us alone. Just yesterday I<br/>
&gt; had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; police called on me by the same people again, accusing me of child<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; neglect<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; becaue my children are outside playing instead of &quot;inside the<br/>
house<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learning&quot;. The policeman came out, took down our school<br/>
information,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; checked<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to make sure my children were in no danger. He in fact came up as<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engaged in a game, laughing and having a great time together.<br/>
&gt; Although<br/>
&gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t feel I have to explain myself to anyone about why we do what<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; do,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s what is working for us. I would much rather signup with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charterschool for now and have the protection from the trouble my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neighbors<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are trying to cause then to loose my children to the kidnappers<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; desguised<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a governmetn agency.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for unschooling in the charter, as Sandra Dodd said, some<br/>
&gt; charters<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; work<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard to allow unschooling. The way it works is as we go about our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lives I write down the &quot;educational activities&quot; my children do<br/>
&gt; engage<br/>
&gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these are categorized by subjects. Once a month I meet with our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Educational<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Specialist and I give her the information. Twice a year I turn<br/>
over<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; portfolio of samples of my childrens work. The portfolio we turned<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; last<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year was pretty much photographs and tape recordings of my<br/>
children.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in any way encourage my children to pursue any specific areas of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; learning,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I do notate what they do pursue and give that information over<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charter.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If anyone wants to consider us not unschooling, then that&#39;s fine.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said I&#39;m a &quot;pure&quot; unschooler and really don&#39;t want any such title.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfer<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to call ourselves natural learners, if we have to call ourselves<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anythign<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all. We do what works for us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380416087">I can sympathize. Our ex neighbor called the cops constantly. once on my<br/>
then 10 yo son because he had a &quot;gun&quot; (it was made out of k&#39;nex) in front of<br/>
her house. My husband drives truck and she didn&#39;t want the truck on &quot;her&quot;<br/>
street. she would come in front of our house, standing just outside the<br/>
property line and scream at us. I am so grateful for the peaceful<br/>
relationship we have with our neighbors now. I pray your situation improves.<br/>

&gt; When we moved into this house we had the most wonderful neighbor in the<br/>
&gt; whole world!  Guess we got spoiled.  We shared Christmas gifts and she<br/>
used<br/>
&gt; to bring the kidlets home little souvenirs from her travels.  She got lung<br/>
&gt; cancer and then mets to the brain.  We were heart broken.  Such a sweet<br/>
lady<br/>
&gt; all ways around.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then the neighbor from h*ll bouht the house.  A really psychotic woman who<br/>
&gt; decided that she owned the alley between the houses and that everyone else<br/>
&gt; on the alley had to pay her rent!  Would you believe she actually fenced<br/>
off<br/>
&gt; the alley (which btw belongs to the city) and then when the cops came and<br/>
&gt; told her to take it down she threw herself in the road and had a screaming<br/>
&gt; fit!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And my cousin asked why we want to sell our house &lt;g&gt;  Hey, I told her I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; trade with her &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Good thing to keep in mind. Our new home is on ten acres and so far we<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; wonderful neighbors. Hopefully it will stay this way. I hated living<br/>
next<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; people who thought their whole purpose in life was to tell other people<br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; &gt; they should be living. That is a very oppressive way to live.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; There is case law about being able to enjoy your home and that if<br/>
&gt; someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; deprives you of that enjoyment by harassment or threats that you can<br/>
&gt; &gt; recover<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; punitive damages.  It is also grounds for a restraining order.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We&#39;ve used it succesfully for some of the folks we have helped that<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ex-offenders.  Neighbors couldn&#39;t be bothered to find out why they had<br/>
&gt; &gt; been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in jail/prison, just that they had made them fair game for harassment.<br/>
&gt; So<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we went after the blankety blanks and that is what our lawyer who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; volunteered advise told us to do and it worked.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lynda,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is this a state law that constitutes harassment? I was  in a similar<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation a few years back and ended up moving to get away from an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interfering neighbor. I wish I could have used this as a defense.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just an aside to this issue, three *unfounded* complaints from<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neighbor<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constitutes harassment and you can get a restraining order against<br/>
&gt; &gt; them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The paperwork is easy to fill out and a fee waiver would cover all<br/>
&gt; &gt; costs<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; most costs.  A judge can issue an order to CPS requiring that any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complaintants against you be required, in the future, to identify<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; themselves<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and be made aware that false charges can and will be prosecuted.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We helped a woman locally get such an order.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I originally filed an R-4 when we first started homeschooling,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; however,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were having severe problems wth some neighbors who threatened to<br/>
&gt; &gt; call<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CPS<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us on almost a daily basis. I researched the charter school and<br/>
&gt; &gt; after<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to other homeschoolers we decided to go ahead and sign up with<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charter<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; school as they provided us protection if/when CPS was called on<br/>
&gt; us.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was the day after we signed the paperwork with the<br/>
&gt; charterschool<br/>
&gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CPS<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; call me on the phone saying someone called them to report that<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; children<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not go to school. I gave them the phone number of the<br/>
Educational<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Specialist<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and it was dropped at that. We signed up in the middle of last<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;school<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the end of the school year I again had CPS at my door, the<br/>
same<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neighbors<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called on me again. This time CPS kept on us for a while and<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eventually<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said they found nothing wrong and left us alone. Just yesterday<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; police called on me by the same people again, accusing me of<br/>
child<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neglect<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; becaue my children are outside playing instead of &quot;inside the<br/>
&gt; house<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learning&quot;. The policeman came out, took down our school<br/>
&gt; information,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; checked<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to make sure my children were in no danger. He in fact came up<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engaged in a game, laughing and having a great time together.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Although<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t feel I have to explain myself to anyone about why we do<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; &gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s what is working for us. I would much rather signup with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charterschool for now and have the protection from the trouble<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neighbors<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are trying to cause then to loose my children to the kidnappers<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desguised<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a governmetn agency.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for unschooling in the charter, as Sandra Dodd said, some<br/>
&gt; &gt; charters<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard to allow unschooling. The way it works is as we go about<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lives I write down the &quot;educational activities&quot; my children do<br/>
&gt; &gt; engage<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these are categorized by subjects. Once a month I meet with our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Educational<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Specialist and I give her the information. Twice a year I turn<br/>
&gt; over<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; portfolio of samples of my childrens work. The portfolio we<br/>
turned<br/>
&gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year was pretty much photographs and tape recordings of my<br/>
&gt; children.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in any way encourage my children to pursue any specific areas of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learning,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I do notate what they do pursue and give that information<br/>
over<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charter.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If anyone wants to consider us not unschooling, then that&#39;s<br/>
fine.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said I&#39;m a &quot;pure&quot; unschooler and really don&#39;t want any such<br/>
title.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfer<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to call ourselves natural learners, if we have to call ourselves<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anythign<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all. We do what works for us.<br/>
