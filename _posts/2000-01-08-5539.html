<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500827736">This request goes out to all of you..I am planning <br/>
on unschooling my son (3yo) and would just like <br/>
to have a starting point..i guess..everyone out <br/>
there seems to have children of school age..and i <br/>
would just like to know about the toddler stage..<br/>
this is all sooo new anyway..as everyone expects<br/>
me to be interviewing preschools now...so...any<br/>
words of wisdom from the seasoned masses would be<br/>
greatly appreciated..basically we play all day, run<br/>
errands, do swim and gym, trying out our first <br/>
moms and tots group this week...i&#39;d just like to <br/>
hear about the early years from someone..<br/>
thank you...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-958854453">Hi Eileen, and everyone else...<br/>
<br/>
My oldest just turned 4, so I am pretty much in the same situation as you.    <br/>
It sounds to me like you are already on track.  I read to my daughter <br/>
(almost) every day...but pretty much at this age it is just play, play, play. <br/>
 Not that one would want to have one&#39;s child in preschool - but if I am not <br/>
wrong play is what happens there, too, except with probably some forced arts <br/>
and crafts type stuff (i.e., color the snow man white, now color the sky <br/>
blue, now make the tree green) etc.  :^P Boring! My child is just now (over <br/>
the last 6 months or so) getting really interested in learning how to read <br/>
and write so I just sort of go with it and reinforce what she naturally wants <br/>
to do.  She will tell me stuff like &quot;P makes a &quot;puh&quot; sound&quot; and then we will <br/>
have a conversation about it.  I have found that if I insist that we sit down <br/>
and do something she doesn&#39;t enjoy it - hence the unschooling approach.  <br/>

Hi --<br/>
<br/>
Well, I guess you have already started.  Other than that, I would read to him <br/>
a lot.  Have lots of stuff around to start to learn how to do &quot;projects&quot;  -- <br/>
art type supplies and access to containers and paper and markers (and prepare <br/>
to re-paint) and all kinds of fun stuff.  Early pre-reading cloth or board <br/>
books are good.  Animals are cool -- seeing even our little guinea pig up <br/>
close has been better than just reading about it.  Blocks and play-doh and <br/>
anything to build with -- save paper towel rolls and scrap paper -- these <br/>
make great paper airplanes and towers on castles, etc.  Water play is always <br/>
a good one at this age -- what floats, what sinks, how to blow bubbles, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
This is a fun age where just about anything has some &quot;educational&quot; value.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054619270">that is really, i&#39;m sorry but i can&#39;t think of any other word, sick.  what<br/>
a really really awful thing to do and lopsided to boot.  my son who is 4<br/>
can&#39;t write and isn&#39;t interested in it.  he can&#39;t stay at one thing because<br/>
he prefers 3 or 4 at a time, but he knows most all the body parts, organs<br/>
included, and their basic functions.  his favorite software is for 9 year<br/>
olds (logical journey of the zoombinis) but he would never do a workbook<br/>
because he likes to make his own rules.  he loves to build with any<br/>
construction set (we have k&#39;nex, lego, zoobs and will probably get zome as<br/>
well) and wants to design and build his own robot (which he does with the<br/>
k&#39;nex) but will not draw any shapes if you ask.  he&#39;s highly independent<br/>
but likes company when he&#39;s working .  for christmas he asked for a<br/>
&#39;electricity lab and a chemistry lab&#39; but will not be taught to write his<br/>
name.  how can you judge a child?  i&#39;m sorry for those and many others who<br/>
have to experience such things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490627501">Thank you to those who responded to<br/>
my inquiry..its nice(great) to know<br/>
I&#39;m headed in the right direction..and<br/>
your suggestions will go to good use..<br/>
And I hope I didn&#39;t step on toes with the<br/>
remark about preschool...its just that <br/>
most of the ones near us aren&#39;t all just<br/>
play...some get pretty academic...I personally<br/>
know of two children &quot;held back&quot; an additional<br/>
