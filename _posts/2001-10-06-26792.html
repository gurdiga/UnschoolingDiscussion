 </span></blockquote>My favorite is Wishcraft: How to Get what You Really Want by Barbara Sher. <br/>
It&#39;s a great book that gives practical advice about how to figure out what <br/>
you really want, and then how to get it, without developing a positive <br/>
attitude ;)<br/>
<br/>
Actually, it&#39;s been really inspirational for me in terms of homeschooling as <br/>
well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-60407715">I am ashamed to even be part of the WE, my mom and sister are both mad at <br/>
me, according to them I should be glad for what they are doing. How can this <br/>
person be my mom and actually think like that? I know all are different, but <br/>
she raised me, you would think some of her views/ideas would be instilled in <br/>
me, actually now that I typed that :) Im really glad I dont share her views <br/>
:) Anyway........... I dont feel this is the answer, IMO!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561426800">Ooh, ooh, ooh, I&#39;m SO GLAD you asked!  One book I&#39;ve returned to <br/>
again and again is &quot;The River Why&quot; by David James Duncan.  Funny, <br/>
funny, funny AND inspirational.  I&#39;ve read it so many times I&#39;ve <br/>
almost got it memorized, but I&#39;ll still read it again...and there&#39;ll <br/>
still be something new there.  Wonder how that works?  It&#39;s fiction, <br/>
and at the beginning you&#39;ll think you have to like fishing to enjoy <br/>
it, but read on whether you do or don&#39;t.  It&#39;s about a man&#39;s <br/>
awakening of his spirit/to himself.  Beautiful, beautiful book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756592210">Wow. <br/>
The list is starting to grow ...I now can go to the local (very small )<br/>
library and look for some of the books that you have recommended. <br/>
Thanks all and if any other thoughts pop up do send them on. I will pass<br/>
this list on to the next person in the same situation. You can see how your<br/>
help and support right now  will grow into a support of others in need down<br/>
the road. <br/>
Thanks from the bottom of my heart.<br/>
<br/>
I will survive, and I will be able to help someone else some day. <br/>
Onwards. <br/>
