<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think sex has to  be with someone you love for it to be<br/>
&gt; meaningful and wonderful and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to tell kids this.<br/>
&gt; They&#39;re going to find out differently anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It seems a really bad idea to build sex into either some kind of sacred<br/>
&gt; shrine of love or some kind of dirty, guilty secret with no option in<br/>
&gt; between for normal people with normal desires.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of the smart things my mother did was talk to me a lot about sex --<br/>
factual stuff -- and tell me that I would have less chance of regrets if I<br/>
only had sex with someone I respected and who was a good friend, and who I<br/>
knew respected me.<br/>
<br/>
Since this seemed sensible to me, I was a virgin until age 23. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I really like this, because it doesn&#39;t matter how I look at sex, it still seems to me something far more emotional and intimate as having breakfast and going to the loo, and that it could leave young children open for a lot of hurt and regret.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to save this line to use in ten years or less.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  I think first-time sex IS a really big deal, especially for young<br/>
women.  Being nonchalant about it doesn&#39;t strike me as wise.  <br/>

(I&#39;m agreeing with what you posted and disagreeing with a sentiment<br/>

<br/>
What really great advice!<br/>
 <br/>
Of the five close friends I&#39;ve known since I was 9 or 10, I was the last<br/>
remaining virgin at twenty.  The others all had numerous relationships<br/>
early and one married her 7th grade boyfriend when she finally turned 18<br/>
and they&#39;re still married twenty one years later.   The Catholic girl<br/>
used to joke I&#39;d be a nun. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Today they&#39;re all happy moms with interesting lives in spite of being<br/>
sexually active girls in the days when girls still got a reputation for<br/>
such things.  <br/>

<br/>
Well.....for some of us, chickenness on the dh&#39;s part resulted in two <br/>
unplanned pregnancies. Not something I&#39;m willing to keep risking.<br/>
My Mom concieved me even though they used a condom and spermicidal foam <br/>
stuff..yucko.<br/>
We happen to be very fertile people in this family. And I&#39;m glad things <br/>
turned out the way they did, because I can&#39;t imagine life without these four <br/>
wonderful people.<br/>
But our finances can&#39;t handle any more children and I personally don&#39;t feel <br/>
capable of handling anymore.<br/>
So what does a woman do? Force her dh to do it even if he has major problems <br/>
with it?<br/>
I personally didn&#39;t have a problem getting it done. It irritated me that he <br/>
was so nervous. But it was the right move for us. I was paid for on insurance <br/>
and we would have had to pay out of pocket for him, one more good reason.<br/>
Some people are sensitive to the anasthesia, I knew I wasn&#39;t.<br/>
Not that I&#39;d recommend having it done unless absolutely necessary. For me it <br/>
was the right choice and I&#39;d do it again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Absolutely.  However, a vasectomy isn&#39;t exactly the world&#39;s safest<br/>
procedure.  There are possible side effects that scare me A LOT.  So<br/>
much so, in fact, that I can&#39;t condone my DH into having one.  I&#39;d love<br/>
to see any research that shows that they are safe.  I&#39;ve researched and<br/>
researched and haven&#39;t found any.  Maybe I&#39;m looking in the wrong<br/>
