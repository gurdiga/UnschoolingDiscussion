<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092675144">Dear Unschoolers<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the warm welcome(s).  It is reassuring to<br/>
know you are all there.....albeit in cyber space!<br/>
<br/>
Some comments and questions came to mind as I read the<br/>
postings. <br/>
1. Two years off....? I don&#39;t understand.  How can<br/>
teaching be separated from mothering?  They seem<br/>
basically the same to me. Do others have differing<br/>
outlook?<br/>
2.  It is WONDERFUL to see the diversity of ages! <br/>
reassuring to me to know cyber(netically?) some other<br/>
mothers near my own age, and therefore some of the<br/>
same experiences.  But to know that some of the things<br/>
that my generation pioneered (sort of) are being<br/>
continued.....some of the good things......is truly<br/>
lovely.  I don&#39;t have any daughters....but each of you<br/>
is truly a blessing to your own mother.  I&#39;m kind of<br/>
like the old man in the Millions and Millions of Cats<br/>
book!  I did have the opportunity to have custody of<br/>
my sister when she was 11 until she married and my<br/>
niece as a toddler for a summer.  How different is the<br/>
relationship of mother to daughter or little girl or<br/>
young woman than to boys.  I have 4 boys.....3 are<br/>
young men. And a lovely daughter-in-law.And a step<br/>
daughter with 2 toddlers.  She became my family, too,<br/>
when she was already an adult.<br/>
3.  My own mother was an alcholholic.  And I suppose I<br/>
must be and abstaining one.  Basically though, at 51 I<br/>
seem to be fine.....have some unrelated health<br/>
problems....but I just wanted to reassure those of you<br/>
with the less than perfect parents that it isn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily a sentence of birth defects, hidden or<br/>
otherwise.  My own children are all healthy, gifted,<br/>
and beautiful as are my nieces and nephews.  I just<br/>
wanted those of you strong beautiful mothers who<br/>
DECIDED to break the cycle that your courage does<br/>
manifest in the next generation as pure beauty.  And I<br/>
thank you.  You have bettered the world just by<br/>
existing!<br/>
4.  I live in Florida. Florida laws do required that<br/>
&quot;homeschooled&quot; children be tested with the same<br/>
standardized tests as the ps children.  If the hs<br/>
child is found to be &quot;behind&quot; there is one year to do<br/>
remediation. Then the child is forced to enter ps at<br/>
whatever level they tested. Records and samples of<br/>
work indicating progression are to be reviewed by<br/>
school approved whoevers and are to be produced on<br/>
request....within a few days or so.  That basically is<br/>
it.  Enough though.  No escape from the standardized<br/>
norm.  Which I don&#39;t anticipate being a problem, but<br/>
it must be awfull for some families. Oh, and the state<br/>
wants a list of ALL the books and authors which are<br/>
used in the learning process. Ha!! Wonder if we can<br/>
download the card catolgue at the library? Expect we<br/>
have lots of books that they don&#39;t!!<br/>
5. The high level of spirituality which is exhibited<br/>
though the manner in which all of you express<br/>
yourselves is SO uplifting.  Thank you.<br/>
6  THANK YOU LIST MOM AND MODERATOR!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to reading your posts as<br/>
frequently as I can get to it.  But now it is bedtime<br/>
story time.  A sacred ritual.<br/>
<br/>
Love and Prayers<br/>
Sharon<br/>
 <br/>
oh yes and #7 Are there any Papa&#39;s working with or<br/>
directing the education of their children? Is this<br/>
considered to be a mothering task exclusively?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>For me personally, I don&#39;t teach anything, nor do I want to anymore. To me, <br/>
mothering is being the best that I can be in every given moment. Children do <br/>
or learn what is modeled for them. If I strive to be learning in every <br/>
moment, then so will they.<br/>

<br/>
We try not to direct anything in our house. Papa has been working at home, <br/>
will soon be working at the office, but hopefully back at home sometime soon. <br/>
He is in the process of &quot;deschooling&quot; himself, as his parents are long term <br/>
educators, and so has been indoctrinated in that system. The more he is <br/>
exposed to unschooling and sees how it works in real life, the easier it <br/>
becomes for him. His &quot;education&quot; is occuring at the same time as the rest of <br/>
us. :)<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m a little late on this one.... I was out of town - sorry! Haven&#39;t <br/>
read through the 12 Unschooling-dotcom digests that were awaiting me <br/>
upon my return yet, so I&#39;m not sure if this was addressed yet - sorry <br/>
if it&#39;s redundant!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually in Florida there are a few options, only one of which <br/>
requires testing with the public school children. The options are 1) <br/>
administer any standardized test or a state student assessment test; <br/>
must be given by a certified teacher, or 2) have child evaluated by a <br/>
certified teacher, or 3) be evaluated by a licensed psychologist, or <br/>
4) have child evaluated by another valid tool that is mutually agreed <br/>
upon.  We chose the portfolio/evaluator method, and our evaluator is <br/>
wonderfully receptive to our unschooling. We live in Orlando - let me <br/>
know if you&#39;d like her name (she lives in Oviedo)!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In my portfolio, I keep a weekly log of our activities, to which I <br/>
attach field trip brochures, photos of projects, artwork, worksheets <br/>
or written work (which is done only by the children&#39;s choosing), and <br/>
trip journals. On the back, I keep a list of the books we have read <br/>
that week.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>
