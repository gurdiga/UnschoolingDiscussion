<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618983813">I&#39;m a legit new member also.  But I have been on enough email lists and seen enough spats that I know to stick with a group during one and then see what it&#39;s really like after it&#39;s over.<br/>
BTW, I don&#39;t know if I have sent in an intro or not.  My name is Nicole Bybee.  I am married to the most wonderful Brad.  We live in Idaho.  We have seven wonderful sons ages 12 down to 16 months.<br/>
We have just been homeschooling/unschooling for just a little over a month...so we are VERY new to this...but enjoying it!<br/>
Anyway, I hope to see this spat resolved soon.  So much more can be accomplished when we aren&#39;t trying to prove ourselves right and open our minds to a possibly new way to do things.<br/>
