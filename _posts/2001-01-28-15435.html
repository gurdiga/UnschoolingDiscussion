<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722544515">Hi :-)<br/>
I hope I am replying to the correct post. In response to the video game<br/>
issue, I wanted to suggest &quot;Tetris.&quot; We have the N64 version, and I am<br/>
pretty sure they have a Super Nintendo version. I have never understood the<br/>
video game craze--couldn&#39;t stand to waste the time playing the games,<br/>
couldn&#39;t stand to watch anyone else waste the time. However, we got Tetris<br/>
for Christmas, and now, I can&#39;t stop thinking about it!! heh heh  The kids<br/>
don&#39;t care as much for it (they prefer Tony Hawk). Anyway, that might be a<br/>
fun one for him, and one that you might feel better about letting him play.<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
Casey<br/>

I have also heard that typing, like teaching typing software programs for<br/>
the computer, can enhance reading, making it easier to learn how to read,<br/>
too. Not sure if this works or not, but can see how it could.<br/>
And try Tetris! ;-)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-184619509">LOL, do you dream tetris-like dreams when you&#39;ve been<br/>
playing it alot? <br/>
I do. Even when awake always in the back of my mind<br/>
somewhere I am trying to picture how this piece needs<br/>
to turn to fit there and etc etc etc. Thankgoodness I<br/>
haven&#39;t been able to play it lately. &lt;G&gt; <br/>
Dr. Mario is like it though. Only you have to match<br/>
four colors in a row, not just get pieces in a row.<br/>
It&#39;s a bit harder for ds. But still fun for me. :) <br/>
