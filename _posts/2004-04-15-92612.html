I&#39;ve found that my 4 yr old boy who I don&#39;t buy guns and what not for, makes <br/>
them himself anyway.  Lately it&#39;s been wrapping paper cardboard tubes that <br/>
seem to make great guns and cannons when he&#39;s fighting the British (he loves the <br/>
PBS show Liberty&#39;s Kids).  We were at the Dollar Store last week and in the <br/>
toy aisle there are tons of guns, he was jumping up and down yelling &quot;they have <br/>
guns, look at all the play guns!&quot;.  So I did get a few odd looks, but I don&#39;t <br/>
think he&#39;s ever seen &quot;real&quot; toy guns before.<br/>
<br/>
As for the educational toys like puzzles and stuff, I have a weakness for <br/>
buying these.  The electronic ones like Leap Pad don&#39;t get any use (the inlaws <br/>
bought that one), but we did take it along on a 6 hour car trip & he used it <br/>
then).  He uses the computer occassionally for a few games he has, and he likes <br/>
some fun kids websites about volcanos and castles.<br/>
<br/>
The blocks, wooden puzzles, etc, do get a lot of use.  I try to rotate what <br/>
we have out and build or play with him which increases the use the items get.  <br/>
We&#39;ve had the Mega Blocks put away for awhile and now that they&#39;re back out, <br/>
they&#39;ve been getting a lot of use.  We also LOVE the large cardboard blocks <br/>
that many nursery schools have (they look like bricks).  We have 3 laundry <br/>
baskets full of them and you can build huge things out of them.  <br/>
<br/>
We also have Legos, bristle blocks, wooden blocks, lacing cards, alphabet <br/>
games, board games, matching games, tons of ABC & animal magnets, write on wipe <br/>
off boards, etc.  It gets used if it&#39;s out in the open and looks like fun.  We <br/>
might do Lincoln Logs for Christmas this year, hmmml, I loved those as a kid.<br/>
<br/>
Check out Sandra&#39;s &quot;strewing&quot; page or look in the archives under strewing, <br/>
which in short I&#39;d say is leaving interesting things out where your children can <br/>
happen upon them if interested in checking them out.<br/>
<br/>
We frequent garage sales, the Salvation Army, and discount stores like <br/>
Marshall&#39;s or TJ Maxx which often have great &quot;educational&quot; toys (aren&#39;t they all)  <br/>
for pennies on the dollar.  There I usually let them pick out something that <br/>
looks good to them.  My son loves the Salvation Army & is crushed that our <br/>
favorite one just went out of business.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
