<div id="ygrps-yiv-24540468">These math manipulatives look like blocks of various lengths, all of a uniform height/width. Each one means a different number. one block is a square. two is equal to two &quot;ones&quot;, and so forth. I don&#39;t know about the wooden ones, but the plastic ones we have are all each a different color for each number representation.<br/>
 <br/>
We have some of the plastic ones, the kids just use them as building blocks. I think they&#39;re good for fine motor skills; they don&#39;t seem to use them much right now. Some parents who school will have their children use them to work out math problems, etc. in a visual way. <br/>
