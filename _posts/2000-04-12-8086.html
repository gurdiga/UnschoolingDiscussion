<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065934619">Well, clarification time here too.  My point wasn&#39;t that one shouldn&#39;t use<br/>
tampons at all, rather that one should know what they contain and that<br/>
there is a healthy alternative.  Also, that the rate of cancer is directly<br/>
linked to tampon useage.  I&#39;ve ranted at my whole extended family (Grampa<br/>
had 18 brothers and sisters), so it isn&#39;t just you guys &lt;&lt;&lt;BEWG&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
