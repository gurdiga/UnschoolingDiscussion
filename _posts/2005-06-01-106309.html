<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455189376"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I supervise to screen out net predators,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but that&#39;s all.  <br/>
He&#39;s way ahead of me in cyberspace.  Anna&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Could you elaborate?  What precisely do you do to<br/>
&quot;screen out&quot;?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The computer is in the kitchen. I stand there cooking<br/>
& washing while I talk to him while he plays. He<br/>
updates me constantly on what he is playing and<br/>
learning. He makes me read his posts. I try my best to<br/>
appear interested, even if I would prefer to finish<br/>
the housecleaning. I comment on his posts from a<br/>
creative writing standpoint since he asks me to.<br/>
When he gets into conversations on forums that he<br/>
doesn&#39;t understand or can&#39;t handle, he asks me for<br/>
advice. He knows, because I&#39;ve made it clear, that he<br/>
should never agree to meet anyone he meets online. If<br/>
it did come up, I suppose I would do the same I would<br/>
do for any playdate, meet the parents first and<br/>
supervise the first few meetings.<br/>
He did recently type &quot;masturbation&quot; into google to<br/>
find out what it is. (he heard it on South Park.) I<br/>
found the trail of sites he&#39;d gone to. I told him that<br/>
this happens to be the one thing you can&#39;t get a<br/>
straight answer out of Google about. I answered all<br/>
his questions. I gave him the Kama Sutra to read. I<br/>
spent weeks answering questions about perversions I<br/>
would rather he never learned about. On the other<br/>
hand, I was glad he could learn about them from me<br/>
rather than from anyone else, so I could put them into<br/>
the right emotional context (people who have been<br/>
abused tend to develop addictions based on their abuse<br/>
and then act them out).<br/>
I thought about putting Parental Controls on my<br/>
computer, but a computer geek friend I consulted told<br/>
me that he would probably be able to figure out how to<br/>
work around them, and it might be better to just keep<br/>
talking to him about it.<br/>
So that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing.<br/>
LOL: after he read the first few chapters of the Kama<br/>
Sutra he said to me: &quot;hey Mom, this is a really good<br/>
book. It says that you should get to know someone<br/>
really well before having sex with them.&quot;<br/>
I said, &quot;well, you can say that again!!!&quot;<br/>
