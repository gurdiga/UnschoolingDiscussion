<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456674689">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
When my 4 year old begged to learn to read, I kept sending her out to play fairy. I thought she was too young to read having read so much on the Waldorf system. I then realized she really did want to have the skills to read and we started playing with the letters all over the place. Words are everywhere. One thing she really liked was to dictate a short, very short story. Sometimes just a sentence or two. I would write the story into a small book. 1 peice of paper cut into pieces stapled together. She liked little books. She would then read her story to everyone. I remember her calling her gramma 3 times one day to read her book. She got so much confidence having made the book, written the story and illustrating them. Not Bob books for her, they were Ashley books. I have her little books stashed away and we look at them once in a while. By 5 she was reading most easy readers from the library. At 6, Harry Potter on her own, and fast too. She is fully literate and reads books constantly. I sure am glad I learned to listen to her and gave her the skills at 4 to read instead of listening to the experts I was reading who told me to play doll and fairy with her. Ashley loves books. She is 8 now and exploring the public school system, her choice. I&#39;m trusting she will get what she wants from this new interest and move on, I mean back home again.<br/>

Holly had a couple of books she wrote.  There are a few things I typed for <br/>
kids that they would print out and read to me, themselves and others.  But <br/>
Holly liked to write hers in her own writing, so even though she couldn&#39;t <br/>
&quot;really&quot; read or write I would print out what she wanted to write, and she <br/>
would write it down.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Casey has always liked to write, so she&#39;s been handwriting her stories for <br/>
years. Some of them we staple up into books. Those first ones are just <br/>
precious to look at. It was from when she first understood inventive <br/>
spelling-and inventive they were!<br/>
<br/>
When I felt like we were losing all those pieces of paper she was writing <br/>
on, I started typing them up for her after she wrote them. She said she <br/>
wanted book spelling, so I also edited for her as I went along. We now have <br/>
two notebooks full of her writing. One is called My Big Book Of Little <br/>
Stories and the other is a book of poetry. Priceless.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
