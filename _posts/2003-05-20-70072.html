<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129331523">I&#39;m getting ready to send in my conference registration (I&#39;m SO excited!),<br/>
and I had a couple of questions.<br/>
<br/>
Is the hotel within walking distance of anything?  Shops or restaurants?<br/>
What do the t-shirts and bumper stickers look like?<br/>
Do you have to order them in advance, or can you just buy them there?<br/>
Would donations of toys or games be acceptable for the silent auction?<br/>
Is there a piano available for the Talent Show?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m getting ready to send in my conference registration (I&#39;m SO excited!),<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m excited you&#39;re coming too!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is the hotel within walking distance of anything? Shops or restaurants?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. A lot of restaurants are *very* nearby. Fast food, local joints, all <br/>
sorts:  The Basil Pot (veggie), The Hunter-Gatherer (mini-brewerie/tavern) <br/>
(great hummus platter!), Miyo&#39;s (upscale Chinese), Immaculate Comsumption <br/>
(soups/salads/sandwiches), Domino&#39;s, Wendy&#39;s, Sandy&#39;s hotdogs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What do the t-shirts and bumper stickers look like?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>T-shirts are red with white lettering: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The illiterates of the future will not be those who cannot read and write,<br/>
  but those who cannot learn&quot;                      ~Alvin Toffler, futurist<br/>
<br/>
Bumper stickers from last year (still available) are two tone blue with <br/>
white:<br/>
<br/>
 Unschoolers Live& Learn<br/>
www.schoolsoutsupport.org<br/>
<br/>
This year...mmmm we&#39;re still deciding. But we&#39;ll probably have one in red <br/>
that says:<br/>
<br/>
If you DON&#39;T WANT to read this,<br/>
        Thank a teacher!<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;ll have a more *positive* one as well! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you have to order them in advance, or can you just buy them there?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>T-shirts must be ordered in advance (that&#39;s how they&#39;re so cheap---and 100% <br/>
cotton)<br/>
Bumper stickers may be bought there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Would donations of toys or games be acceptable for the silent auction?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep. Yep. Yep!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is there a piano available for the Talent Show?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We had one last year. But it&#39;s a different hotel. I&#39;ll check next week when <br/>
we meet with Ken. Talent show participants can register as late as noon on <br/>
Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
Anything else?<br/>

I hope you don&#39;t.<br/>
It was one of those mean things said for venting, a kind of spite-fantasy, <br/>
not a wish for it to really happen.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s true, and it makes sense *to us,* but to be negative and poke people who <br/>
will  NOT get the ironic point is kinda cruel, I think,  and the vast <br/>
majority of people who read the bumper sticker would not think kindly <br/>
thoughts of the people in the car.<br/>
<br/>
Uplifting and happy would be more useful, I think.<br/>
<br/>
What about another design and color of the same Live & Learn text, so people <br/>
can color-coordinate to their cars, and pick the script/design they like best <br/>
(OR have both and collect the whole set, to show how many years they&#39;ve been? <br/>
 huh? Huh?)<br/>
