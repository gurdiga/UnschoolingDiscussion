&gt; &lt;&lt;Kris,<br/>
&gt; That sounds helpful.  Please send the info.  The wheat is still going to<br/>
&gt; be a hard one.  I tried to stop eating wheat products for a few short<br/>
&gt; days a couple of months ago... failed.  I&#39;m more motivated know, for<br/>
&gt; obvious reasons, so I&#39;m going to try it again.  Though my 5yo loves to<br/>
&gt; help me make bread (sad face).  Can I make another type of bread or do<br/>
&gt; they all contain wheat?  Or should I avoid all grains?  I&#39;m  sure I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; find the answers to my questions with a bit of research.  Thanks again.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t needed to eliminate wheat that I know of but I know there are<br/>
&gt; several kinds available at the health food stores.  They are made of<br/>
&gt; rice, rye, spelt and others I can&#39;t remember.  It would probably take<br/>
&gt; relearning the bread making art but it&#39;s doable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been collecting bread recipes and I think I may have gotten one or<br/>
&gt; two that are wheat free.  I will look and then post them here.<br/>
