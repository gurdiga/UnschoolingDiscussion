<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623250637">Hello Mary Ellen<br/>
<br/>
Why not try Claymation / Clay Animation ?<br/>
<br/>
This is wonderful experience for a ten year old.<br/>
<br/>
Basically get her to make a model out of clay or playdough. Even  <br/>
plastercine can be used.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure that there is some sort of bendy metal ( a wire coathanger  <br/>
for example ) inside the model as this makes it easier to position.<br/>
<br/>
Then she will need some sort of background - a shoe box turned  <br/>
sideways or a felt board to use as the back ground would look nice.<br/>
<br/>
Then it is a series of photographs taken against the background of  <br/>
the model ( animals work well ) each one in the same pose but  <br/>
something moved. For example if you have a man and want to see him  <br/>
waving in the film, take the first picture, then move his arm  <br/>
slightly upwards, take another picture, move the arm downwards again  <br/>
or higher, take another picture and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Then when you have lots of pictures, import them into the computer  <br/>
and run them in sequence as a slide show. You can create transitions  <br/>
between each picture if desired.<br/>
<br/>
This can be achieved with a video camera in much the same way taking  <br/>
film for about three to four seconds, pause, move object, then film  <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Never move anything in the background that is not supposed to move as  <br/>
this upsets the overall look of the piece.<br/>
<br/>
There are 100&#39;s of websites about Claymation and Clay Animation.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
A fine example would be Wallace and Gromit.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter really gets into this, she can narrate a sound track  <br/>
to play over the finished movie with a story in her own voice. Add  <br/>
music or sound effects etc.<br/>
<br/>
Also, text files can be created to run along the bottom of the movie.  <br/>
Just paste some text on top of each photograph during the editing  <br/>
process and then add the finished photograph with text pasted on to  <br/>
the slide show.<br/>
<br/>
The creative prospects are endless with this type of thing. We use  <br/>
playdough which I make up in different colours in our house. Silver  <br/>
foil looks good on film but not so good in photographs for the back  <br/>
drop.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337701281">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; My 10 yod Jackie wants to produce/direct a play.  I&#39;m not really sure<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
As someone who has spent my whole professional life in both theater and<br/>
film, there is not necessarily anything &quot;easier&quot; in the different media. To<br/>
be honest making a video means fewer performances, but a lot more<br/>
work/organization during principal photography - and then you have to edit<br/>
it (presumably you are thinking of her using your computer). It may not be<br/>
getting everyone together at the same time, but there is still a lot of<br/>
planning.<br/>
<br/>
However both share some basic questions that I would suggest asking or<br/>
jotting down if you already know:<br/>
<br/>
Who is the intended audience? Family, family and friends, your local group,<br/>
the general public?<br/>
<br/>
From this comes the idea of the venue - your living room, your back yard,<br/>
someone else&#39;s home, church or community hall, outdoors at a park (not the<br/>
video showing I guess)....<br/>
<br/>
What kind of project? Already chosen, or self written, group generated,<br/>
adapting an existing story of some kind (eg a well known fairy tale), an<br/>
existing play (that could also be a film script)? Narrative, cabaret/skits,<br/>
performance art?<br/>
<br/>
Who would be the actors? You and her family, her friends, puppets/animation,<br/>
has one of her friends devised the proposal and come to her to be involved,<br/>
was it something grander in scale with adult participants?<br/>
<br/>
My first suggestion would be to look into your local community/college<br/>
theaters. Aside from the possibility that they may have a specific program<br/>
aimed at enticing kids into the theater, these little places suffer a<br/>
chronic shortage of volunteers to do all kinds of fun work like set painting<br/>
or props manufacture; she might be able to participate depending on their<br/>
policies and insurance issues :/. It might be a good way for her to get an<br/>
idea of the scope of the job.<br/>
<br/>
I have always been really happy to have an enthusiastic youngster come<br/>
either to the theater or on certain independent movie sets (not allowed on a<br/>
Union set of course) wanting to help and learn. I remember one kid, about<br/>
11, who did a faux finish (I showed him how then left him to it like any<br/>
other artisan) on one of the floors on a set that I was designing for his<br/>
mother&#39;s short film project. I was not yet a mother, and it never occurred<br/>
to me to speak to him &quot;like a kid&quot;...I heard from his mom later that he was<br/>
so thrilled to be treated &quot;just like an adult&quot; by me.  <br/>
<br/>
Also small local theaters have facilities and other useful resources like<br/>
people, existing costumes and props that they may be able to help her with<br/>
in her own project. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127402594">Mary Ellen, <br/>
My daughter (11) is working on a play as well. It seems overwhelming to me also and I am currently in place where I am trying to not be discouraging and my biggest fear is that I don&#39;t want her to come away from the experience feeling unsupported. I&#39;ll share what she has done so far, maybe it will give you some ideas...<br/>
She has so far developed a story line, written a narrative introduction and character descriptions, designed costumes shared the idea with her friends and has begun auditions and one friend ( who loves to write) is writing the actual script. They have begun asking around for places to perform and are in the beginning stages of working out a budget. I am finding that I haven&#39;t had to facilitate anything yet and quite a bit has been done. As it gets down to needing more rehearsal time and getting everyone together it may get harder, but really it can be done in about a weeks time of intensive work, for which we may just create a backyard theater camp to facilitate. She has already realized that it will take a long time to complete and may decide at some point to simplify a bit. <br/>
I&#39;m feeling the most support I can give her is helping her problem solve when and if issues come up, help her find solutions without rescuing her, which I have made it clear from the beginning that I would help if asked but it wasn&#39;t going to become my play ( like I will teach her to sew but I will not sew the costumes...My only other suggestion is to attend performances and see if she wants to take a theater class. <br/>
Break a leg,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-431277001">My daughter and a couple of friends put on a play with about 40 kids  <br/>
in it - she was 11 or 12 at the time.  They cast the show, set up a  <br/>
rehearsal schedule, came up with costumes (did not sew them, modified  <br/>
thrift store purchases and listed for many of the kids what they  <br/>
needed to get for themselves), they found props, the got one of the  <br/>
moms who plays the accordion to play the music and a kid with a  <br/>
keyboard to do special effects.   They called around and searched  <br/>
until they found a high school that would let them use their theater  <br/>
for one night, for a fee. They also hired two high school kids to run  <br/>
some lighting. They got the money to pay for this by having everybody  <br/>
bring goodies to sell before the show, at intermission, and after the  <br/>
show.<br/>
<br/>
They needed some adult help when they had too many kids at rehearsal  <br/>
at the same time - crowd control help. They needed adult help to get  <br/>
the theater use squared away. And they ended up needing some adults  <br/>
backstage to help get all the kids off and on stage with all their  <br/>
props, etc., at the right times (that&#39;s because the girls putting ON  <br/>
the play also had major roles and so couldn&#39;t supervise backstage  <br/>
during the show).<br/>
<br/>
One night - one wonderful performance.<br/>
<br/>
THEN they did it again - this time they wrote it themselves and  <br/>
handled even more of it themselves, with a number of adults providing  <br/>
support. For this one. First, they held a 6 week acting workshop -  <br/>
one hour per week - for younger kids. Then they auditioned and cast  <br/>
the show. This was somewhat fewer kids - no big ensemble numbers -  <br/>
and much easier to do.  They didn&#39;t charge for tickets, but they did  <br/>
have a big bake sale, again, and they asked for contributions. They  <br/>
pretty much just covered their expenses.<br/>
<br/>
It is doable. Just help her take one step at a time. Help her keep it  <br/>
simpler rather than complicated, whenever possible. Remind her that  <br/>
her FIRST show doesn&#39;t need to be the most elaborate - she can build  <br/>
on her experience and do other shows later.<br/>
<br/>
Also - warn ALL the adults involved that this is going to be  <br/>
primarily a kid-directed activity. Make it REALLY clear to them  <br/>
before they get involved - otherwise you can end up with a terrible  <br/>
situation of adults actually complaining about a child&#39;s competence.  <br/>
Remind them that the mistakes will be charming!<br/>
