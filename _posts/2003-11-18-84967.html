<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661532356">I had the same reaction as Ren-average price 200k?  I live in Central <br/>

Not sure Miami raises the average much. Just think Jupiter Island though. We<br/>
paid less than 200,000. for our house 3 years ago. Now it would go for well<br/>
over that. There isn&#39;t a house in our neighborhood that goes for less than<br/>
200. And we don&#39;t live in a ritzy area. It&#39;s very nice,but not ritzy.<br/>

But you aren&#39;t average for Florida....that is high end for the South. Florida is one of the less expensive states to live in overall. And the area I&#39;m in is exceptionally reasonable. Here&#39;s a little blurb about the NW towns.<br/>
Having lived in Alaska and the West Coast, I am amazed at how reasonable Florida is, especially considering the beautiful beaches....much nicer than anything on the West Coast in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Southern Small Fries<br/>
There may not be a Starbucks on every corner in Wilmington, Delaware, or Fort Walton Beach and Tallahassee, Florida, but they&#39;re certainly the cheapest places to live in the South. (Maybe the dearth of $5 soy latt�s is what keeps prices down in these areas?) Still, there are tradeoffs: Commute time, housing and utilities are cheaper in Wilmington than Philadelphia, but according to recent statistics, violent crimes occur more often in Wilmington than Philadelphia. Yet the negative statistics haven&#39;t made a dent in Wilmington&#39;s tourism. <br/>
<br/>
As for the Gulf Coast, Fort Walton Beach is just 200 miles away from the Big Easy, with cheaper housing and healthcare and less crime. Its 20 parks, numerous beaches, resorts and hotels may make it a popular, yet affordable retirement area. <br/>
<br/>
And to the southeast of Fort Walton, Tallahassee has just as much sun as Tampa, two power schools�Florida A&M University and Florida State University�and remains an affordable Florida city in which to retire, with average home costs of $99,790. In addition to good weather and good prices, Tallahassee has a variety of cultural events and tourist activities.</div>

No my house isn&#39;t average for FL. My area average cost of a house is<br/>
actually about 235,000. The 200,000 average cost of a house is for the<br/>
state. It was just in our local paper about a month ago. I can&#39;t find the<br/>
article now and not sure how accurate it is, but it did say for the whole<br/>
state of FL. And if you look at Jupiter Island which just got most expensive<br/>
city in the country, you can see why the state average is high.<br/>
