<div id="ygrps-yiv-754310733">Yes,  there are horror stories on each side....those children left with<br/>
abusive parents and those removed for seemingly crazy reasons.<br/>
<br/>
However,  in the United States.....it is the only the Court/legal system<br/>
that has the &#39;power&#39; to remove any child from the home.  Children&#39;s<br/>
Protective Services Workers are typically entry level personnel,  many of<br/>
whom have no background in Social Work.  And CPS is a publically funded<br/>
program;  most of the CPS workers work for public agencies;  though in<br/>
recent years,  there has been a movement toward public agencies<br/>
&#39;sub-contracting&#39; child protective services.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes,  the worker will believe/see abuse or neglect are present,  but<br/>
are at a loss to find *legal* evidence.  Currently,  the Courts lean heavily<br/>
toward keeping childrem in a curreent family situation,  in part due to the<br/>
fact that Foster Care is completely inadequate and/or unavailable in most<br/>
areas.<br/>

social workers have the power, in most parts of Canada anyway, to remove <br/>
children immediately if they believe they are in danger.<br/>
And they&#39;ve used some pretty weird excuses for danger over the years.<br/>

came to visit her unexpectedly and was ready to take away her younger son <br/>
if they found anything wrong.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out that the young kid was telling his friends and teacher <br/>
about how &#39;mamma&#39; chases him around and the house and scratches him if he <br/>
tries to kiss her.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;mamma&#39; is their cat.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily the cat ran by and was called by name before the incident turned <br/>
scary.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh yikes!  Too bad people don&#39;t make more of an effort to read the emotions <br/>
that go along with what a child is saying.  If it was really his mother <br/>
doing that, and not in just a joking way, you&#39;d think the emotions he <br/>
showed as he was telling about it would have been obvious.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, it can look a lot worse than it really is.  My <br/>
granddaughter had really awful tantrums until just a few months ago.  She&#39;s <br/>
almost 7 and quite strong.  There were times when my daughter had to <br/>
physically pin her, to keep her from doing her or the baby any serious <br/>
damage.  (These were screaming, hitting, biting, pinching, hair-pulling, <br/>
throwing things, completely out of control kinds of tantrums.)  When Skye <br/>
was being pinned, she would be screaming as loud as she could, &quot;You&#39;re <br/>
hurting me.  You&#39;re hurting me.)  I witnessed one that happened in a <br/>
parking lot, and saw people walking by obviously trying to decide whether <br/>
to step in or call CPS or something.  It was a real worry for a while, to <br/>
the point where Heather actually considered having cards printed up, <br/>
explaining what was going on, and that the only pain Skye was feeling was <br/>
because of her resisting being pinned.  And that she was only being pinned <br/>
to avoid physical injuries to any of them.<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, her parents found her a supplement that made a huge difference <br/>
in her behavior, and then she recently had a native-syle healing circle <br/>
done for her, which seems to have made even more of a difference.  She <br/>
still isn&#39;t an easy child to parent, by a long shot, but the physical <br/>
violence and most of the screaming has stopped.  (This is a child who was <br/>
born at home, attachment parented,  breastfed &quot;forever&quot;, everything Heather <br/>
could discover that might help her to grow up feeling empowered and <br/>
emotionally healthy.  It certainly seems to have a chemical basis, to the <br/>
point where Heather was close to letting the docs put her on Lithium or <br/>
something.)<br/>

Heather sounds a lot like Wyndham.  His problems are chemical allergies. <br/>
Have they investigated that with Heather?  Just a thought.  Not a<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heather is my daughter.  It&#39;s her daughter, Skye,  with the <br/>
problems.  &lt;g&gt;  They&#39;ve had her to 2 or 3 naturopaths, who all said varying <br/>
lists of foods were the problem.  Keeping her off those foods helped some, <br/>
but not enough.  I think I posted before about Skye waking up and asking if <br/>
they could go get something she wasn&#39;t allowed to have that day.  She had <br/>
become completely obsessed about food.  Heather decided to let it go, that <br/>
it hadn&#39;t made enough of a difference.  After a couple of months of letting <br/>
her eat what she wants, she&#39;s pretty well back to a reasonable balance <br/>
between healthy and junk foods.  I assume that the docs tested her for <br/>
chemical allergies at the same time, so she probably doesn&#39;t have the <br/>
chemical allergies.<br/>
