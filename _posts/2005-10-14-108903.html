<div id="ygrps-yiv-22008246">Hello all. We&#39;ve began a co-op of sorts with a neighbor for her son. <br/>
He&#39;s been kicked out of school and was being sent to an alternative <br/>
school. <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions on activities that we can do to bring him closer to <br/>
wanting to do things? Of course, this is only week 2, but we&#39;ve spent <br/>
more time trying to make sure that he doesn&#39;t walk out the door and <br/>
just go than anything else (or just walking off, period, when we&#39;re <br/>
outside the house). I was trying to do a hands off approach, but that <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to be working -- yet. <br/>
<br/>
Someone did state that it would take at least a month for him to &quot;come <br/>
around.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

I&#39;d leave him alone.  After I asked what he&#39;d like to do.  He  probably has <br/>
some very bad memories of group activities.  He might say  &quot;nothing&quot; and if so, <br/>
tha&#39;s okay.<br/>
 <br/>
I think he probably wants to leave because the group is contrived to &#39;make&quot;  <br/>
him do something.  He doesn&#39;t want to do anything.  He doesn&#39;t want to  be <br/>
manipulated or managed or condescended to.  Leave him alone.  <br/>
 <br/>
Why does he have to do anything at all?<br/>

Let him play video games.   Let him watch DVDs.   <br/>
Let him sleep.<br/>

Exactly! And why can&#39;t he leave? Why can&#39;t he take a walk by himself? He is 14? Is there something preventing him from having alone time? We all need that down time. Babies get fussy when overstimulated, three year-olds scream at the grocery store when they have been hauled all over, running errands all day, fourteen year-olds need private alone time, so do adults. We can&#39;t expect every minute of the &#39;school&#39; time frame to be filled with &#39;unschooling&#39; activities, that is not how it works. You aren&#39;t replacing one for the other, you are getting rid of one and going on with your life. Two weeks isn&#39;t enough time for anyone of any age to &#39;get it&#39;. He probably isn&#39;t going to want to do anything for a time except just be. And a lot of that being is going to be being alone. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

sure he does &quot;do things&quot;.  He may not &quot;do things&quot; that<br/>
you want him to do, but he does &quot;do things&quot;. Let him<br/>
be.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A month per year of schooling.<br/>
But....even still....perhaps what you want him to<br/>
&quot;come around&quot; to, might be different than what<br/>
unschooling is about?  Deschooling isn&#39;t about getting<br/>
to a place where he will be willing do the things you<br/>
want him to do (such as co-ops).  It&#39;s about ridding<br/>
him of all his schoolish thinking.  About letting him<br/>
live and enjoy life.  About the both of you learning<br/>
to truly trust each other.<br/>
<br/>
And, you need to deschool yourself.  Keep reading<br/>
everything you can about unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This advice is for you or for your neighbor?  Are the parents actually <br/>
planning on Unschooling the boy?  If not, the advice on this list <br/>
probably doesn&#39;t apply.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Someone did state that it would take at least a month for him to &quot;come <br/>
&gt; around.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Deschooling is often said to take a minimum of one month for every year <br/>
that a person is in school.  I would guess that the harder school was on <br/>
a person, the longer that period of time could be (and being kicked out <br/>
would definitely be considered hard on a person).  The time starts over <br/>
completely whenever any schoolishness is forced on a person (including <br/>
co-ops in a lot of cases!).  So, for a 14 year old that was having <br/>
problems in school, I&#39;d give him at least a year and a half for <br/>
deschooling.  I&#39;d buy (or rent or borrow) a bunch of videos and books <br/>
and games and leave them around the house.  I&#39;d spend as many of my <br/>
waking hours as possible right with him.  I&#39;d talk to him, and leave him <br/>
alone if he wanted to be alone (with frequent checking up on him -- to <br/>
give him food, mention a cool show on tv, point out the weather, etc. -- <br/>
just random cool things that would interest a person).  I&#39;d stay open <br/>
and available to him.  I&#39;d apologize to him for all that he has been <br/>
through in his years in school.  I&#39;d emphasize that he is not a failure! <br/>
  School failed him, not the other way around.<br/>
<br/>
What are his interests and hobbies?  I&#39;m going to stereotype and just <br/>
guess that perhaps he likes skateboarding and music and video games? <br/>
Help him do those things more.  Enjoy him and celebrate his newfound <br/>
freedom.  Have a party -- a NEVER BACK TO SCHOOL party.  Take him <br/>
shopping (if he likes that sort of thing).<br/>
