<div id="ygrps-yiv-468329357">you know, everytime I read about AP/fm beds, it just makes me SO SAD ...<br/>
when my dch were babies (24,21,11,9) we&#39;d never heard about any of these<br/>
ideas ... in fact, I didn&#39;t even know about h-s&#39;ing w/ the older dch or I<br/>
would&#39;ve GLADLY taught them @ home, too ... I nursed until my babies weaned<br/>
themselves, even our adopted dch and I *know* we would&#39;ve enjoyed these<br/>
other ideas, as well ... ohhhhh I *wished* I could roll back time a couple<br/>
of yrs b/c I&#39;d do things differently, oh well  ::::::::::::: *sniff* ...<br/>

Pris ~&gt; who&#39;z always learning something new ...<br/>

&gt; DH & I have had the kids in bed with us from birth.  As they were<br/>
&gt; ready they moved themselves to their own beds.  Every so often one of<br/>
&gt; them will come back in & ask to sleep on our floor.  We got out our<br/>
&gt; sleeping bags & leave them out for them to use.  DD 7 isn&#39;t in but<br/>
&gt; maybe 2 times a month, ds 4 comes in 4-5 times a week & ds 2 stays in<br/>
&gt; his crib with the side down. & a toy box (closed) for him to use to<br/>
&gt; get out.  He&#39;ll come in during the night to be changed or if he wants<br/>
&gt; a drink.  We&#39;ve seen no problems with this.<br/>

You know, there is a lot that I wish I had known when my children were <br/>
babies.  A good friend of mine told me not to beat myself up about something <br/>
I could&#39;ve never helped because I simply didn&#39;t know.  What I can do is the <br/>
very best for my children NOW based on things I know and am continuing to <br/>
learn about - like unschooling.  And if ds was not as shy as he is, I might <br/>
never have discovered this wonderful alternative to school.  From the few <br/>
posts that I have read of yours, your children seem to be lucky to have <br/>
someone who cares so much about them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131052904">ohhhhhh, now aren&#39;t you the sweetie to say such kind things, Sandy :)<br/>
reading the posts made me sad b/c IF I would&#39;ve been aware I would&#39;ve been<br/>
right in the big middle doing all those neat things w/ my dch, too  ...<br/>
yes, you&#39;re *exactly* right, can&#39;t beat yourself up over stuff you didn&#39;t<br/>
even know about :)<br/>
