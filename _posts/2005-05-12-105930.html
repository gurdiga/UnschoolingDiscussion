This is exactly what led me to unschooling.  I taught professionally for ten years, many years ago...:0)  I can tell you that what teachers have to do in order to keep their teaching jobs does not at all correlate to how children actually learn.  Teaching is so much more about crowd control, keeping children busy, and producing good testing statistics.  If a teacher tries to set up a classroom where learning can actually happen, they will always be in trouble with the administration.  So we have been doing this for more than a decade.  One of our daughters is curretnly in college and doing great!  I have a teenager that is not peer dependent, she is 17 and knows how to enjoy herself and socialize with all ages.  Then I have two that are 11, and 12 and we have a great time. I feel like I&#39;ve gotten to relive my childhood only better.  BTW the only time we pay attention to what day it is , is to keep track of a fun event coming up..life is good!<br/>
Hiya show this to your mom, maybe it would help her to hear that there is an unschooling kid right now in college preparing for medical school and another teen who unschools and is doing really well for one 17. She has a job and keeps a bank account and isn&#39;t in any trouble etc... Neither of them ever went to junior high or high school, and my 17 year old has been out since 2nd or 3rd grade.  BTW her ACT score was great.  She took the test because she lost a bet with a friend and came out with a good score.<br/>
Blessings, Ann<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114188515">It does seem ironic the number of unschoolers and homeschoolers who<br/>
are/were public school teachers, or involved in the school in some way<br/>
or another. Would be neat to see the statistics on it. <br/>
<br/>
BTW I liked most of the teachers in the school. I did not mean to<br/>
imply the teachers were the problem,  many of them tried their best<br/>
with my son. It was the enviroment that just did not suit him.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations on your daughters, they sound like they are doing very<br/>
well. <br/>
One of the biggest changes i&#39;ve noticed with my sons esp the oldest<br/>
was , the change of having no peer pressure. They are more self<br/>
assured, and freer to do what they want without the fear of not<br/>
fitting in.<br/>

&quot;Ironic&quot; isn&#39;t the right word, I think.<br/>
&quot;Telling&quot; or &quot;revealing.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Surprising&quot; is the light version, and &quot;damning&quot; is the heavy.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
