 </span></blockquote>Laura, I went and read the reviews on Amazon, while it looks like an <br/>
interesting book the thing that jumped out at me from reading the reviews is how many <br/>
people now feel confident (after reading the book) to follow what they always <br/>
felt in their gut now that another expert has given them the seal of approval. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spent the last few hours reading the archives here and think the <br/>
information there much more valuable. (and cheaper)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son (the sports lover one) once told a group of adults in a Smithsonian <br/>
store that he USED TO BE ALBERT EINSTEIN before he was John.  He was about eight <br/>
I guess.  Some were interested, some moved their small children quickly away <br/>
from him.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow I guess when we were reading about him at some time or other, he must <br/>
have felt some similarities to Einstein&#39;s life I guess.  Maybe there was <br/>
more, at the time we talked a lot about it.  Now, it seemed to embarrass him the <br/>
last time I asked him about it since he&#39;s all &quot;grown up&quot;.  So I don&#39;t ask.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253127418">I haven&#39;t read this book yet but I can recommend it 100%! How so? The <br/>
author, Kathy Hirsch Pasek, was my Psychology instructor a long time <br/>
ago and is now a friend and role model of mine.  I used to babysit <br/>
her kids even, and they are all great boys. (Her oldest son used to <br/>
love the weather channel I remember). She is so enthusiastic, <br/>
energetic, and excited about learning (she even made statistics fun) <br/>
but not pushy or competitive (her kids went/go to a laid back Quaker <br/>
private school).  Kathy also has put out some tapes under the <br/>
label &quot;KaMotion&quot; which address kid-friendly topics like &quot;Which <br/>
elevator will it be&quot; and &quot;100 ways to keep from going to bed&quot;.  I am <br/>
looking forward to getting the book soon (I live in Israel).  She <br/>
also has several other books about language development.  (BTW, her <br/>
secret to career success and involved parenting is full time <br/>
household help--she has taught me that one woman cannot &quot;do it all&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Buy the book! (no, I am not getting a percentage!) Lisa</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986234831">The book is a long dissertation on why toddlers, preschoolers and <br/>
kindergarteners don&#39;t need formalized learning situations, and why it&#39;s bad for them to <br/>
lose play time to curriculum pressure. I suppose if one is facing pressure to <br/>
set their three year old on the academic treadmill it might be useful.<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping to find it fascinating, but I returned it only slightly read. <br/>
Probably because I didn&#39;t need convincing. :)<br/>
