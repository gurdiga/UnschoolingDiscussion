I think it relies entirely on the child. As I have said before, my five year old, shows absolutely no interest, introducing sex to him would be like introducing algebra to him.<br/>
<br/>
Whereas my sister and I talked about my nine year old niece the other day, and we thought it is time to start talking about these issues. And maybe watching a mild movie together would be an excellent ice breaker. I do think children at this age, is at risk for abuse, if they do not have sufficient information. Especially if they have older friends.<br/>

PS I changed the word sex in the subject line because subject containing these words, don&#39;t download. Not sure how this one got passed.<br/>

I&#39;ve been watching That 70&#39;s Show reruns lately.  I think for a 12 or 13<br/>
year old, this show is pretty good for introducing relationship issues,<br/>
including the sexual part of relationships.  It shows, in a pretty<br/>
detailed way, what both the boy and the girl in the relationship might<br/>
be feeling.  Although my 8 year old watches sometimes, it&#39;s not what I<br/>
would pick as a jumping off point for introducing the topics to a 9 year old.<br/>

PS  (I liked the movie The Wedding Planner, because the &quot;cute couple&quot;<br/>
decided NOT to dump their partners to instantly get it on with each<br/>
other.  They waited until their other relationships ended before they<br/>
went after each other.)</div>

It&#39;s not that old.<br/>

I think it came on after we moved, so less than five years old?<br/>
<br/>
Holly was just complaining about Bart Simson always being ten.  That she <br/>
doesn&#39;t mind, but she was watching Halloween specials, and since she keeps <br/>
track of all the things she has ever worn at Halloween by how old she is, she <br/>
thinks its unfair for Bart to have different costumes every year, yet still <br/>
be ten.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like a time travel problem.  A time-treading-water problem.<br/>

<br/>
Personally I think 9 is *way* too late to start talking with our children about sex! And the idea, so prevalent in our society, that sexuality can be covered in a &quot;talk&quot; when the child reaches adolesence really saddens me, as i see this learning as a process that ideally ripens throughout many years. At adolesence, very few children are going to suddenly be open to discussing sex with parents who have never talked openly about it all along! Even children for whom sexuality was an open topic may suddenly become private about these things at this age, as they get to know their new bodies and find their own place with it.<br/>
<br/>
We are all sexual beings, from birth, and sex and sexuality are a big part of life--without sex, not a single one of us would be alive--how important is that?! I&#39;ve begun talking about sexuality with my children since they were just talking, first naming body parts, then talking about reproduction (animals, humans, plants) as things arose, on to specifics and values. I share my values about sex along with other values about food, relationships, the environment, how i want to spend my money--these are valuable life skills, folks, why keep them secret?! <br/>
<br/>
And i don&#39;t only wait to be asked, though i definitely don&#39;t push it either. But this is a society where healthy sexuality is kept *very hidden* (no wonder some kids don&#39;t ask!) and exploitive sex is advertised everywhere, so I feel a strong need to speak out and not perpetuate the shameful silence and imbalance, even when it means stretching my own growth. <br/>
<br/>
I think this shame and silence around sexuality is particularly, though not exclusively, North American. In Europe, the energy around sex and bodies in general is much more relaxed. In Sweden for example, teens are very sexually active, very often in their own homes without secrecy, and (surprise--not!) teen preganncy rates, STD&#39;s etc are *much* lower than in the US. <br/>
<br/>
My folks are German, and though they were both modest and religious, I grew up knowing where babies come from and it was clear to me throughout my childhood that their sexual relationship was natural, affectionate and satisfying. My parents were shocked when parents lobbied to have me expelled in grade 2 for explaining to their children just how our teacher got that big belly and that there was a baby in there. My quiet-spoken mom went in and told them that if their children didn&#39;t know yet where babies come from, it was about time they knew! Luckily (unluckily?) my teacher agreed--she read us a book about babies in bellies and I wasn&#39;t expelled.<br/>
<br/>
I felt comfortable showering with my dad till I was about 9, saw many of my older relatives dressing without embarrassment, and but for a brief period from about 11-13, have always felt comfortable with nudity (though I don&#39;t like it when it&#39;s exploitive).<br/>
<br/>
I had a very full and satisfying active sexual life during my teenage years from about 14 on, always protected and usually, though not always, with committed partners. I matured early and was certainly looking for love, but not neccessarily in the wrong places and i don&#39;t believe this is/was pathological or unhealthy for me--quite the opposite! I&#39;m convinced it has played an important part of my maturing sexuality and me growing into a healthy adult (well, &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;adult&quot; are both relative :-)).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very grateful that my own 17 yo son speaks to me *very* openly about sexual issues when he has concerns (though only on his initiative now) and I know that this would never be the case had I just decided to broach the topic when he was approaching puberty. I&#39;m also sure that being open with him and to him in general is a big part of the picture. It&#39;s not always easy but always worth it. Once recently he was asking me about something I felt a little uncomfortable answering and i answered the best i could and then suggested he ask his friends what they thought and he looked at me incredulous and said &quot;why would i ask them if i could ask my parents??&quot; Oh, yeah, duh!<br/>

See <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.violence.de/prescott/bulletin/article.html">http://www.violence.de/prescott/bulletin/article.html</a> for an interesting viewpoint on the connection bewtween violence and the repression of sexuality, especially in teens. <br/>
<br/>
A good place to start if talking about sex with your kids seems difficult is the Canadian book &quot;Speaking of Sex&quot; by Meg Hickley--she covers all ages and what children might want to know.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>9 year olds are still 4 years off adolescence!<br/>
We just answered the questions as they arose. When my daughter <br/>
at 4 asked where babies came from &#39;mummy&#39;s tummy&#39; was the <br/>
answer she needed at that age. Since then the questions have <br/>
become more detailed and we have answered each truthfully as it <br/>
arose. She has a book on growing up but at the moment she <br/>
thinks its disgusting. We have gay friends so she knows same sex <br/>
partnerships happen. She&#39;s watched babies being born.<br/>
Come to think of it, learning about sex is happening in an <br/>
unschooling fashion.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds good. Pretty much what I do although I always express <br/>
that other people&#39;s values may be different and I explain why. She <br/>
also wanted to know why adults set laws about children&#39;s bodies. <br/>
This led to a complicated discusiion about &#39;for your own good and <br/>
safety&#39; which I can&#39;t really answer to her satisfaction yet.<br/>

wants to know why my generation allowed them and allowed the <br/>
restriction of beauty to mutilate women&#39;s bodies.<br/>
Ummm.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-544150077">Shyrley says  **9 year olds are still 4 years off adolescence!**<br/>
<br/>
Adolescence isn&#39;t an age, it&#39;s a state. Some kids are going to hit it WAY <br/>
before others.<br/>
<br/>
My 10 year old will be menstruating within a year. Some 10 year olds already <br/>
are. By the time they&#39;re starting to develop, if you haven&#39;t already been <br/>
talking about sex they&#39;re quite likely to be embarassed by it all, AND <br/>
they&#39;re distracted by their personal development issues some and can miss <br/>
&quot;hearing&quot; a lot of what you&#39;re hoping to tell them.<br/>
<br/>
...But then Shyrley goes on to say that she really wasn&#39;t advocating not <br/>
talking till some time later, but talking as things come up... whew.  :)  **<br/>
Come to think of it, learning about sex is happening in an unschooling <br/>
fashion.**<br/>

What about uterus?? That&#39;s one of the first sex lessons my kids learned. <br/>
That way the baby can have it&#39;s own womb!!!! (sorry!)<br/>

Marty still doesn&#39;t mind seeing me not fully dressed.  He will walk in and <br/>
talk to me while I&#39;m on the toilet.  It bothers me a little, but not enough <br/>
to say anything.  He&#39;s not LOOKING at me, it&#39;s just as casual as it was when <br/>
he was little.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby was shy for quite a while, but lately he will walk around in just boxer <br/>
shorts and a t-shirt, looking for something or to get food or whatever, so <br/>
now I have seen his big hairy legs.  For a couple  of years, he&#39;d either <br/>
dress completely or wrap a sheet around himself.<br/>
<br/>
But none of them blushes and acts like such things are nasty.  <br/>

vegetarian, no bovine growth hormone lifestyle. She started developing<br/>
breasts at 7. A friend of mine with triplet daughters who are 13 or 14<br/>
now told me it was the same with her family, and they started their<br/>
peiods at 10 and 11.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid (and I&#39;m 34, too), I remember hearing that the average<br/>
was 12-13, and the prediction was that girls started, on average, 6<br/>
months younger than their mothers. I started one month before my 13th<br/>
birthday. I&#39;m built really differently from Rain, though, I&#39;ve alwas been<br/>
skinny and she&#39;s heavier.<br/>
<br/>
At first I thought it was sad that she had to deal with this sort of<br/>
&quot;stuff&quot; when she was still a kid, but now I think that was my issue, and<br/>
whatever speed her body develops at is okay. She&#39;s not the only 9 yr old<br/>
we know who has small breasts, and I don&#39;t wnat her getting the idea that<br/>
there&#39;s sonmething sad or bad or shameful about having them. She is still<br/>
a kid much of the time - she plays with playmobil and swings on swings,<br/>
she isn&#39;t interested in boyfriends, just getting her to run a brush<br/>
through her hair before leaving the house is a trick some days. She has<br/>
the maturity to talk with and relate to older kids, but she&#39;s not<br/>
&quot;growing up too fast&quot;, if that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
And she&#39;s looked a couple of years older than her actual age since she<br/>
was about a year and a half old and people thought she was three, so it&#39;s<br/>
nothing new for her...<br/>

plucked up courage. I was kneeling down getting onions out of a <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I always thought of those &quot;well visits&quot; to the doctor as fishing <br/>
expeditions for doctors.  We have been so lucky to find a doctor who is not <br/>
only an anthroposophical doctor but also an M.D.  So, he mostly treats <br/>
homeopathically, but when the big guns are really needed, he can prescribe <br/>
antibiotics.  He&#39;s against vaccinations against childhood diseases, <br/>
although he wanted me to consider tetanus.  All in all, he is a pleasure to <br/>
work with because he respects Liam and me.<br/>
<br/>
Liam suddenly became really sick today.  One minute he was fine, but it <br/>
seemed that the next minute he had a temperature of 103 and climbing.  I <br/>
had brought him to the doctor only twice before, both times because he had <br/>
Lyme disease, so this was strange to me.  The doctor felt that Liam had <br/>
gotten the flu and his one eardrum was pretty red.  I came home with four <br/>
remedies, and no antibiotics.  Liam is so comfortable with this guy, he <br/>
actually asked me to bring him to the doctor!<br/>
<br/>
I feel so bad that Liam is going to be missing out on the cool Halloween <br/>
things we had planned to do.  Such is life I guess.<br/>

Yeah, when I mentioned it was sad, I was saying it from a mom&#39;s point of <br/>
view. It&#39;s nice to know that it doesn&#39;t have to be that way and that some <br/>
kids don&#39;t see it as a problem. I know I still have a school mentality about <br/>
it too as my daughter was in school when she went through all that. I <br/>
haven&#39;t hit that period yet with an unschooler. I&#39;m sure other school kids <br/>
can make it uncomfortable with their reactions.<br/>

&gt; No, but the president seems to be planning on needing soldiers for a<br/>
&gt; long while to come.<br/>

in South America who had a baby at 5. She is now much older, with kids and <br/>
grandkids, and the boy she had at 5 is now deceased.<br/>

boys, or if you have to be right there. If you do have to be right there, <br/>
make the appointment, for both, back to back. Tell the boys it is time to go <br/>
for a regular checkup. Explain about preventive medicine. Take them, give the <br/>
office the info they need and go wait in the car or run some errands. If they <br/>
or the doctor have concerns arrange for them to talk with Dad about it. I <br/>
understand that whole *I don&#39;t want my Mom to go to the doctor with me.* <br/>
thing. Its the same with girls and their dads. <br/>
<br/>
But then you probably already knew this. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
