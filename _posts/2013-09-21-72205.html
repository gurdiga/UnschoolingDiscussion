The urgency I have been feeling was made even greater. We are on a great path and I see my relationship with my 14 year old son really doing better and better. The book Parent/Teen Breakthrough and this page and the Yahoo groups have been so beneficial as well as Sandra&#39;s site and Living Joyfully. I have learned so much. Even though his life of relaxed/eclectic homeschooling seemed like freedom to most who observed, I can see how it was not the relationship centered lifestyle that would develop the most peace and joy in my home. He&#39;s my youngest. My husband runs his business out of our home. My 18 year old and 22 year old live with us and we are a pretty happy family unit. </span><br><div style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"><ul class="ygrps-yiv-1958193223ygrps-yiv-2045271677" id="ygrps-yiv-1958193223ygrps-yiv-2045271677webMessengerRecentMessages" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;list-style:none;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:11px;line-height:14px;"><li class="ygrps-yiv-1958193223ygrps-yiv-2045271677" id="ygrps-yiv-1958193223ygrps-yiv-2045271677wm:mid.1379184172549:455e201cda0aa86004" style="margin:0px;padding:8px 20px 7px;list-style-type:none;zoom:1;border-width:1px 0px 0px;"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1958193223ygrps-yiv-2045271677" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;zoom:1;"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1958193223ygrps-yiv-2045271677" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;zoom:1;overflow:hidden;"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1958193223ygrps-yiv-2045271677" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1958193223ygrps-yiv-2045271677" id="ygrps-yiv-1958193223ygrps-yiv-2045271677mid.1379184172549:455e201cda0aa86004" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1958193223ygrps-yiv-2045271677" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;zoom:1;"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1958193223ygrps-yiv-2045271677" style="margin:0px 50px 0px 0px;padding:0px;direction:ltr;font-size:13px;line-height:1.38;"><p style="margin-top:10px;padding:0px;white-space:pre-wrap;">Back to my urgency. I am extending a lot of trust to Stevie. I believe I must but I am hanging on to a lot of fear. In his life he has always been drawn to &quot;the risky&quot; or &quot;inappropriate&quot; maybe even because he&#39;s grown up with those labels from me. The thing is, we haven&#39;t stopped him from these things but have shared our views. So for example, right now it&#39;s pretty vulgar rap music which his sister is offended by. He has gotten pretty good at playing it less around her. He&#39;ll share videos with me and we&#39;ll talk about them. He thinks they&#39;re funny. Sometimes I agree, sometimes I&#39;ll say they&#39;re womanizing or a bit lacking in vocabulary (F,F,F). He likes the music (he is a musician). I don&#39;t (I&#39;m a bit of a Rock n Roll snob and don&#39;t hear enough guitars!) but we can have good conversations. I feel like (hopefully) I&#39;m grasping the idea of mutual respect here in the are of what I would have once called inappropriate. </p><p style="margin-top:10px;padding:0px;white-space:pre-wrap;">The &quot;risky&quot; is where I&#39;m having trouble. The latest is skateboarding. The skating isn&#39;t the concern even though sometimes he comes home bloody! He hangs out for a few hours each day skating with kids I don&#39;t know. One of my &quot;rules&quot; was always that I would not let him go to someones house until I had met the parents. It gave me a chance to assess where he was going and feel better myself. Now these kids are not hanging out at someones house. They ride around looking for good things to jump off of. They range in ages and experiences and levels of drug use from none to some to probably a lot. Stevie tells me about it. He probably doesn&#39;t tell me all about it. He knows our family history (lots of addiction on both sides) and how fearful I have been for my kids in that area. He hasn&#39;t tried anything (yet) and I think it is mostly because he thinks he&#39;ll get caught and is worried about it hurting me. I have shifted my conversation to things like your body is still growing and I would love it if you waited until adulthood to experiment with things like that. I posted on &quot;My Unschooler is Interested in...&quot; on Facebook and got so much feedback that I have shared resources with him about drugs. We have watched videos together. Not slanted, scared straight stuff. Not one sided. It has been scary but I have even shared more of my high risk teenage stories that I locked away from my kids. </p><p style="margin-top:10px;padding:0px;white-space:pre-wrap;">Does anyone have ideas. I want to let go of fear because I&#39;m sure it colors the conversation. One of the things I never see discussed is unschoolers trying drugs. Maybe this never happens but I can&#39;t believe that, especially with those starting late like us. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></li></ul></div>--&nbsp;<br>Love and Prayers,<br>Marina</div></div></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1958193223card-action-bar" style="margin:10px;padding:0px;height:20px;"><span class="ygrps-yiv-1958193223hover-btn"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;line-height:16px;"></span></span></div> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1958193223ygroups-quoted"><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> --- In alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;netmamaof3@...&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-1958193223ygrps-yiv-743728333"><div dir="ltr">Well nobody had any advice for me on my first post and now it has gotten more complicated.<br><div><br></div><div>I am concerned about Stevie.

The other day he told us that he had tried pot a few times and didn&#39;t like it. This doesn&#39;t really surprise me as his recent choice of friends is a group of stoner looking skateboarders. I don&#39;t know if he is lying about not liking it or not. He described the other kids laughing and seeming to have fun and him feeling awkward and uncomfortable. He was telling Nicholas (my 22 year old) who never told us and often seems to undermine us with Stevie. I think Nicholas has plenty of resentment he has to work out and enjoys looking cool to his little brother. I never break Stevie&#39;s confidence when he tells me what he and his brother talk about.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div><div>We have had many conversations about drug use in our family as there is so much history of addiction. I tried very hard not to overreact because I really want him to feel safe coming to me. Nicholas kept everything from me when he was a teen. I&#39;m sure it was because I would overreact and treat him like he didn&#39;t know anything and I fear shutting Stevie out the way I did his brother. But I am also very afraid of him damaging his developing brain.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I have told him that it will take some time to rebuild trust and that when he goes out with friends I want him to at least check in at home every 2 hours. He doesn&#39;t fight me on this but also is pretty clear that he doesn&#39;t think it is a big deal. He says &nbsp;his friends aren&#39;t pot heads but only do it once in a while. I grew up with a mom who smoked before she got out of bed in the morning. My whole family (including me as a teen) smoked a lot of pot. I feel like it won&#39;t kill him but want so much more for him.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I don&#39;t believe in the scared straight kind of slanted information or control/punishment as I feel like the former doesn&#39;t work because he&#39;s done a ton of online research and the latter will just make him hide stuff once the punishment is lifted. I have also told him that I trust him to be in charge of his body and make good choices but that I realize that we all make bad choices sometimes.</div>
<div><br></div><div>All of his &quot;role models&quot; (rappers, musicians, skaters) seem to be promoting pot. I hate it but it is reality. I don&#39;t have good clear info on young drug experimentation and later life outcomes. I would like to be able to share unbiased stats on that sort of thing. Also, any thought you have on ways to influence him in a safe direction would be appreciated.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I hope someone answers this time.<br>--&nbsp;<br>Love and Prayers,<br>Marina</div><div><br></div><br></div></div>

I posted on &quot;My Unschooler is Interested in...&quot; on Facebook and got so much feedback that I have shared resources with him about drugs. We have watched videos together.

He was telling Nicholas (my 22 year old) who never told us and often seems to undermine us with Stevie. I think Nicholas has plenty of resentment he has to work out and enjoys looking cool to his little brother. I never break Stevie&#39;s confidence when he tells me what he and his brother talk about.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div><div>We have had many conversations about drug use in our family as there is so much history of addiction. I tried very hard not to overreact because I really want him to feel safe coming to me. Nicholas kept everything from me when he was a teen. I&#39;m sure it was because I would overreact and treat him like he didn&#39;t know anything and I fear shutting Stevie out the way I did his brother. But I am also very afraid of him damaging his developing brain.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I have told him that it will take some time to rebuild trust and that when he goes out with friends I want him to at least check in at home every 2 hours. He doesn&#39;t fight me on this but also is pretty clear that he doesn&#39;t think it is a big deal. He says &nbsp;his friends aren&#39;t pot heads but only do it once in a while. I grew up with a mom who smoked before she got out of bed in the morning. My whole family (including me as a teen) smoked a lot of pot. I feel like it won&#39;t kill him but want so much more for him.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I don&#39;t believe in the scared straight kind of slanted information or control/punishment as I feel like the former doesn&#39;t work because he&#39;s done a ton of online research and the latter will just make him hide stuff once the punishment is lifted. I have also told him that I trust him to be in charge of his body and make good choices but that I realize that we all make bad choices sometimes.</div>
<div><br></div><div>All of his &quot;role models&quot; (rappers, musicians, skaters) seem to be promoting pot. I hate it but it is reality. I don&#39;t have good clear info on young drug experimentation and later life outcomes. I would like to be able to share unbiased stats on that sort of thing. Also, any thought you have on ways to influence him in a safe direction would be appreciated.</div>

I posted on &quot;My Unschooler is Interested in...&quot; on Facebook and got so much feedback that I have shared resources with him about drugs. We have watched videos together.

The other day he told us that he had tried pot a few times and didn&#39;t like it. This doesn&#39;t really surprise me as his recent choice of friends is a group of stoner looking skateboarders. I don&#39;t know if he is lying about not liking it or not. He described the other kids laughing and seeming to have fun and him feeling awkward and uncomfortable. He was telling Nicholas (my 22 year old) who never told us and often seems to undermine us with Stevie. I think Nicholas has plenty of resentment he has to work out and enjoys looking cool to his little brother. I never break Stevie&#39;s confidence when he tells me what he and his brother talk about.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div><div>We have had many conversations about drug use in our family as there is so much history of addiction. I tried very hard not to overreact because I really want him to feel safe coming to me. Nicholas kept everything from me when he was a teen. I&#39;m sure it was because I would overreact and treat him like he didn&#39;t know anything and I fear shutting Stevie out the way I did his brother. But I am also very afraid of him damaging his developing brain.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I have told him that it will take some time to rebuild trust and that when he goes out with friends I want him to at least check in at home every 2 hours. He doesn&#39;t fight me on this but also is pretty clear that he doesn&#39;t think it is a big deal. He says &nbsp;his friends aren&#39;t pot heads but only do it once in a while. I grew up with a mom who smoked before she got out of bed in the morning. My whole family (including me as a teen) smoked a lot of pot. I feel like it won&#39;t kill him but want so much more for him.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I don&#39;t believe in the scared straight kind of slanted information or control/punishment as I feel like the former doesn&#39;t work because he&#39;s done a ton of online research and the latter will just make him hide stuff once the punishment is lifted. I have also told him that I trust him to be in charge of his body and make good choices but that I realize that we all make bad choices sometimes.</div>
<div><br></div><div>All of his &quot;role models&quot; (rappers, musicians, skaters) seem to be promoting pot. I hate it but it is reality. I don&#39;t have good clear info on young drug experimentation and later life outcomes. I would like to be able to share unbiased stats on that sort of thing. Also, any thought you have on ways to influence him in a safe direction would be appreciated.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I hope someone answers this time.<br>--&nbsp;<br>Love and Prayers,<br>Marina</div><div><br></div><br></div></div>

One of my issues is that my own mother got me high for.my first time when I was 13 saying that it was safer with her than with friends. Of course I quickly started to prefer to do it with friends and lie about it. Because of my own experience I made assumptions about how these things must be handled. My mother was not unschooling, she was an addict. I am looking at these things with fresh eyes because I really want it to be different with Stevie than it was with Nicholas at this age . It already is. As I&#39;ve said, he told me. That&#39;s a lot. I do share his music and love to listen to him play guitar and sing. I haven&#39;t stopped him from going out and I tell him I trust him (and I do, mostly). I appreciate any feedback and will continue to work on me.

Giving someone support and not fear or criticism or nagging seem to be remarkably beneficial at limiting their propensity to self-harming. Engaging with him on all of the things he is willing to let you engage with him will be more valuable than sharing with him facts and statistics about the outcomes of drug using on the general population. He isn&#39;t the general population. He&#39;s Stevie, your son. Share skateboarding stuff. Look for ways to enjoy his music, even if it is completely based on his enjoyment. There are shows that I&#39;ve watched since my children have stopped enjoying them that I can remember enjoying when they enjoyed them
 and now are no longer interesting. Someone else&#39;s love of something can totally change your opinion of it. Let him influence you. Maybe you and he could watch A Clockwork Orange together and think about, or, maybe, even talk about language and the ways in which it changes (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadsat" style="font-size:12pt;">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadsat</a>)<span style="font-size:12pt;">. There is a South Park episode about the word &quot;Gay&quot; that might be interesting viewing, as well. Oh, and in the series Firefly the language use is fascinating (</span><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://firefly.wikia.com/wiki/Language" style="font-size:12pt;">http://firefly.wikia.com/wiki/Language</a>)<span style="font-size:12pt;">.&nbsp;</span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-958305803yiv437720946yui_3_7_2_40_1379801683150_55"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-958305803yiv437720946yui_3_7_2_40_1379801683150_55">He isn&#39;t yours to control.

That&#39;s something to ponder - what is safety and how does one achieve it, or the sense of it?&nbsp;<br><br>My stepson skateboards and when he was younger, 13 and new to unschooling, he skated a lot. He experimented with skating without a helmet - carving, mostly, he&#39;s not much of a jumper. There was a certain amount of social pressure at the skatepark to skate without a helmet, but over time Ray decided he wasn&#39;t comfortable carving without one. It didn&#39;t seem safe to him.&nbsp;<br><br>He&#39;s been out street-skating with friends from time to time, and it&#39;s a great way for him to explore new cities. It is undeniably dangerous... but for a young adult male, exploring cities at all is dangerous in a particular way. Not knowing the local expectations can lead to real violence. But vague warnings about maybe-violence aren&#39;t what he needs, he needs someone who knows the territory to give him real information about how to keep a low profile. What does seem to help is to give him a chance to talk about his experiences, and take his thoughts and feelings seriously without lecturing him on what he should do/have done. He&#39;s more likely to think things through, think about the reasons why people behave the way they do, and make thoughtful decisions... but not always &quot;safe&quot; decisions in the sense of avoiding anything that could be dangerous.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="line-height:12.499999046325684px;"><br></span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="line-height:12.499999046325684px;">---Meredith</span></p> <div class="ygrps-yiv-155639098ygroups-quoted"><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> --- In AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-155639098ygrps-yiv-845502101"><div dir="ltr">Well nobody had any advice for me on my first post and now it has gotten more complicated.<br><div><br></div><div>I am concerned about Stevie. The other day he told us that he had tried pot a few times and didn&#39;t like it. This doesn&#39;t really surprise me as his recent choice of friends is a group of stoner looking skateboarders. I don&#39;t know if he is lying about not liking it or not. He described the other kids laughing and seeming to have fun and him feeling awkward and uncomfortable. He was telling Nicholas (my 22 year old) who never told us and often seems to undermine us with Stevie. I think Nicholas has plenty of resentment he has to work out and enjoys looking cool to his little brother. I never break Stevie&#39;s confidence when he tells me what he and his brother talk about.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div><div>We have had many conversations about drug use in our family as there is so much history of addiction. I tried very hard not to overreact because I really want him to feel safe coming to me. Nicholas kept everything from me when he was a teen. I&#39;m sure it was because I would overreact and treat him like he didn&#39;t know anything and I fear shutting Stevie out the way I did his brother. But I am also very afraid of him damaging his developing brain.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I have told him that it will take some time to rebuild trust and that when he goes out with friends I want him to at least check in at home every 2 hours. He doesn&#39;t fight me on this but also is pretty clear that he doesn&#39;t think it is a big deal. He says &nbsp;his friends aren&#39;t pot heads but only do it once in a while. I grew up with a mom who smoked before she got out of bed in the morning. My whole family (including me as a teen) smoked a lot of pot. I feel like it won&#39;t kill him but want so much more for him.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I don&#39;t believe in the scared straight kind of slanted information or control/punishment as I feel like the former doesn&#39;t work because he&#39;s done a ton of online research and the latter will just make him hide stuff once the punishment is lifted. I have also told him that I trust him to be in charge of his body and make good choices but that I realize that we all make bad choices sometimes.</div>
<div><br></div><div>All of his &quot;role models&quot; (rappers, musicians, skaters) seem to be promoting pot. I hate it but it is reality. I don&#39;t have good clear info on young drug experimentation and later life outcomes. I would like to be able to share unbiased stats on that sort of thing. Also, any thought you have on ways to influence him in a safe direction would be appreciated.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I hope someone answers this time.<br>--&nbsp;<br>Love and Prayers,<br>Marina</div><div><br></div><br></div></div></span></blockquote></div></div>

 of my choices by laying the blame on others. Ultimately it doesn&#39;t matter, what could have been done better, what could have improved my outcome.

That&#39;s the trouble with rules - they depend entirely on someone being willing to follow them. What many kids learn from rules is not to get caught breaking them.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;line-height:13.333333015441895px;font-size:13px;"><br></span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;line-height:13.333333015441895px;font-size:13px;">And it&#39;s possible the rules wouldn&#39;t have fit all the situations - my parents had rules like &quot;you can&#39;t be out after curfew&quot; that I sometimes ignored as a teen because I chose to be the designated driver. So I&#39;d be out after curfew taking other kids home safely, trying not to get caught so that I could go on providing that service to my classmates.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;line-height:13.333333015441895px;font-size:13px;"><br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> </span></blockquote></span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;line-height:13.333333015441895px;font-size:13px;">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="font-size:13px;">Did I tell her everything I did because we had good communication?&nbsp; Absolutely not.&lt;&lt;</span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="font-size:13px;"><br> </span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="line-height:12.486978530883789px;">Exactly. So rules wouldn&#39;t have mattered. You&#39;re mistaking a lack of rules for some other lack - a lack of communication, or a sense of care and support. Your mom wasn&#39;t a very good friend, not someone you could trust to help you think things through, or support you through a tough decision.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="line-height:12.486978530883789px;"><br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> </span></blockquote></span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="line-height:12.486978530883789px;">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="font-size:13px;">Unschooling doesnt mean you have to stop being a parent&lt;&lt;</span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="font-size:13px;"><br> </span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="line-height:12.499999046325684px;">Learning doesn&#39;t come from parents.

All those things are part of their perspective of adults, of you, and of what you tell them about the world. And! by the time kids are teens they mostly Don&#39;t Want to be Told about the world. Whether they&#39;re willing to listen to what anyone - parent or otherwise - has to say will depend largely on how trustworthy they find that person.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="line-height:12.486978530883789px;"><br></span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="line-height:12.486978530883789px;">&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</span><span style="font-size:13px;">doesnt mean you have to stop being a parent that has a clear understanding of what these drugs can do to a person&lt;&lt;<br><br>I want to be clear that I&#39;m not saying parents shouldn&#39;t share helpful information - that&#39;s not being a very good friend, either. I Want my friends to give me realistic, helpful information... but I also know that there are some friends who aren&#39;t good sources of information. And sharing information does not automatically result in learning - that&#39;s the important thing to keep in mind, from an unschooling perspective: teaching isn&#39;t learning! Telling isn&#39;t learning. Sharing information isn&#39;t learning. Learning is often experiential - and often involves taking risks. The risk of getting it wrong. Sometimes the risk of getting hurt. And the older kids get the less input you have on deciding what kind of risk is acceptable.<br><br>What you can do is be part of the back-up plan when things don&#39;t work out. That might not sound like much, but it can make a big difference - in terms of people making more thoughtful decisions - to know that there&#39;s someone who will help if things don&#39;t go according to plan.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="font-size:13px;"><br></span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="font-size:13px;">---Meredith</span></p> <div class="ygrps-yiv-62341837ygroups-quoted"><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> --- In AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-62341837ygrps-yiv-1207128200"><div dir="ltr"><div>You still need a stance whether they talk to you or not right?&nbsp; This is something I have thought about for over 20 years.<br><br>My mom took the &quot;friend&quot; stance with me when I was a teenager.&nbsp; I was allowed to go out anytime I wanted.&nbsp; I could pretty much do whatever I wanted as long as we had open communication.&nbsp; I did do whatever I wanted.&nbsp; Did I tell her everything I did because we had good communication?&nbsp; Absolutely not.&nbsp; I wish she had set at least some rules with me when I was a teenager.&nbsp; It could have prevented A LOT of mistakes for me.&nbsp; Im not saying a rule &quot;no drugs&quot; but know where your child is and who he is with.&nbsp; Unschooling doesnt mean you have to stop being a parent that has a clear understanding of what these drugs can do to a person.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; You do not know what is in them.&nbsp; You do not know who made them.&nbsp; Do you eat healthy and do you make educated decisions?&nbsp; <br>

One of the problems with taking a very &quot;hard line&quot; stance on recreational drugs is that it discourages your kids from talking To You about the way whatever drugs they&#39;ve tried effect them. Their only option is to talk with friends - and that may not be a good venue for saying &quot;I don&#39;t like this&quot;. Not everyone enjoys smoking pot - but it&#39;s much harder to admit that when it&#39;s something you&#39;re doing rebelliously, or clandestinely. There&#39;s a value in pretending to enjoy yourself because you&#39;ve invested a lot of energy into doing this thing on the sly.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color:rgb(63,63,63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(63,63,63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">
When my stepson was experimenting with drugs, it helped him to be able to say &quot;I didn&#39;t have a good time&quot; - it even helped him in terms of saying &quot;I don&#39;t want to do that,&quot; later to friends, or leaving parties that were getting too wild.&nbsp;<br>
<br>&quot;Everyone responds differently&quot; isn&#39;t a reason to avoid something, it&#39;s a reason to be mindful.&nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(63,63,63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">
