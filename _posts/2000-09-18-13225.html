&gt;  I meant I hope i can get a book for $10!  No Costco here in New <br/>
&gt;  Zealand. I expect they cost quite a bit more than $10...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If I recall, you mentioned you haven&#39;t read any of the Harry Potter books.  <br/>
If so, definitely start with the first one and work your way through the <br/>
series.  It is a great series.  A bonus benefit is that the earlier books are <br/>
available in paperback (at least here in the US).  Otherwise, the US price, <br/>
without discount, is something like $27.  <br/>
