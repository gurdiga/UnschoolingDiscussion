<div id="ygrps-yiv-635729841">&#92;&gt; My question is this.  I have always asked that she brush her teeth, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; get dressed,  and make her bed in the morning.  After she completes<br/>
&gt; those responsibilities, she is free to do whatever she chooses, from<br/>
&gt; playing her violin, reading, watching tv, playing outside - the<br/>
&gt; choice is hers.  This doesn&#39;t seem unreasonable to me.  I have been<br/>
&gt; reading many postings here, and am wondering if/how my &quot;requiring&quot;<br/>
&gt; her to do ANYTHING (chores, responsitilies etc) might have an effect<br/>
&gt; on unschooling.  I don&#39;t require academics, or &quot;education&quot;, but<br/>
&gt; simple, basic hygiene etc.  Literally, if I didn&#39;t &quot;make&quot; her brush<br/>
&gt; her teeth, she might not for a week.  (yuck!)  She battles me about<br/>
&gt; these basic things!  I have tried numerous things to get these things<br/>
&gt; taken care of, but could use any suggestions you may have.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my daughters and I have a disagreement over basic hygiene/safety/health<br/>
I tell them what I&#39;m worried about (cavities, etc.) We try to come to an<br/>
agreement about when, how often, and if they want me to remind them and how<br/>
I&#39;ll approach it if they forget. There is nothing magical about hopping out<br/>
of bed and brushing teeth. If she does it once or twice a day sometime,<br/>
she&#39;ll get what benefit (and some say it&#39;s marginal benefit anyway, and that<br/>
cavities-or-not are more genetic than anything) there is to be had.<br/>
<br/>
Getting dressed and making her bed are matters of neither hygiene nor health<br/>
(well, unless she wants to play naked in a snowstorm &lt;g&gt;). Those are<br/>
arguments I would drop like hot rocks. If her bed bothers you, make it. :)<br/>
If seeing her in pjs until 3 p.m. bothers you, take deep breaths and learn<br/>
to overcome it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; One more question, while I&#39;m at it.  How do you all deal with<br/>
&gt; disrespect?  Talking back, raising her voice to me, stomping,<br/>
&gt; slamming doors - she gets very frustrated when things don&#39;t go &quot;just<br/>
&gt; right&quot;.  Yesterday it was violin.  She was playing, and didn&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; the song perfect.  She started to get angry.  I suggested she put it<br/>
&gt; away for a bit, and take it out later for a fresh start.  She slammed<br/>
&gt; down the bow, knocked over her music stand in her huff, and slammed<br/>
&gt; her bedroom door.  I have repeatedly talked to her, to help her<br/>
&gt; understand that it doesn&#39;t have to and isn&#39;t going to be perfect<br/>
&gt; everytime, etc etc...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This doesn&#39;t sound to me like disrespect. This sounds to me like she doesn&#39;t<br/>
want a lecture when she&#39;s feeling bad about violin. As a female with<br/>
perfectionist tendencies myself ;) I understand that the worst thing someone<br/>
can do while I&#39;m in a huff over my own real or imagined inadequacies is try<br/>
to talk rationally to me. Sympathy works better, &quot;I hate it when I don&#39;t get<br/>
something right. Here, punch this pillow.&quot; Or just leaving me alone for a<br/>
bit.<br/>
<br/>
Later, after the slamming etc. is all done, she&#39;ll probably be more ready to<br/>
talk calmly, but the conversation at that point might be about how you can<br/>
help her learn to control her outburst and direct them toward acceptable<br/>
outlets (scrubbing a bathtub in a huff or going into the yard and running<br/>
around full speed are terrific, slamming doors and scaring the 3 year old<br/>
aren&#39;t). Telling her she shouldn&#39;t feel how she feels is not, IMHO, the most<br/>
positive approach.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It isn&#39;t healthy for any of us to endure her attitude, (I also have a<br/>
&gt; 3 year old boy that is copying her behaviors), there should be<br/>
&gt; consequences for her actions.  When she gets angry because her game<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t going well, she slams the playstation.  I take away her<br/>
&gt; playstation for the day - the punishment fits the crime.  But what<br/>
&gt; about general disrespect or attitude?  She pushing to see what the<br/>
&gt; limits are, that&#39;s for sure.  Sometimes I wonder if she thinks she<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t have to listen to me, because she thinks she&#39;s as smart as<br/>
&gt; me?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think punishment in general is a really, really bad idea. If your husband<br/>
slams the front door because he&#39;s had a terrible day at work, do you take<br/>
away his door privileges? If you have an awful day and toss your earrings at<br/>
the wall, are you denied jewelry for a certain period of time?<br/>
<br/>
Respect begets respect, and parents have to first show it to children before<br/>
they will get it back from the children. They learn by what we do to them,<br/>
not what we say they should do. If you punish her, she&#39;ll want to punish<br/>
you. If you try to control her (bed making, dressing, toothbrushing to your<br/>
timetable), she&#39;ll do what she can to seize back what control she can.<br/>
<br/>
If you sympathize with her pain, stop her from actually harming herself and<br/>
others while not telling her the feelings themselves are wrong, just her<br/>
expression of them could use some work, I think you&#39;ll see a more positive<br/>
response.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519858419"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &#92;&gt; My question is this.  I have always asked that she brush her teeth,<br/>
&gt; &gt; get dressed,  and make her bed in the morning.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t wait to hear all the responses on this.  Here is my<br/>
perspective:  I view teeth brushing as very very important, even<br/>
essential to the health of our teeth.  Since I don&#39;t want any of us to<br/>
get cavities, I say something like, &quot;Let&#39;s go brush our teeth.  Mine<br/>
feel grody [they do, too, or I wouldn&#39;t say it].  Do yours?  Let&#39;s get<br/>
them all clean.&quot;  Then, we all go and brush our teeth.  We do this<br/>
sometime in the morning hours (usually) and before bed (always).  I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t wake a sleeping child to do this, but I feel that it is<br/>
essential for the awake kid&#39;s to do it.  My kids are only 6 and 2, so<br/>
they aren&#39;t quite able to _properly_ do this themselves, but the 6 yo is<br/>
close and she does her own in the morning and I do touch ups after she<br/>
does her own at bedtime.  If she didn&#39;t brush her teeth, I honestly<br/>
believe that she&#39;d get cavities.  We&#39;ve talked about this and how they<br/>
would feel, how it would be at the dentists and the large amount of<br/>
money and time it would cost the whole family.  She doesn&#39;t balk it at<br/>
all, but she usually has to be reminded.  As for the two year old, she<br/>
wants to be like her sister so she is usually pretty easy.  With my 6<br/>
yo, we had a problem with her and brushing for a while when she was<br/>
younger and consistency was the key with her.<br/>
<br/>
As for bedmaking.  We only make our beds two times in our house (and<br/>
even then it is pretty sloppily made):  when the sheets have just been<br/>
washed and when company is coming that will see the bed.  I read<br/>
somewhere once that making a bed can cause asthma.  Something about the<br/>
bedmites thriving on the sweat of humans and the dampness of the bed<br/>
growing into mold, etc. when the sheets are covered, but that when the<br/>
covers are left open they dry and so the mites can&#39;t grow.  I don&#39;t know<br/>
all the details, but I can see how this could be true and I use it as an<br/>
excuse since asthma runs in my family and I&#39;ve done everything else<br/>
possible to prevent it in my kids, so why not this, too?  I don&#39;t mind<br/>
since I hate making beds.  :)<br/>
<br/>
As for getting dressed, sometimes none of us get dressed for the day. <br/>
It can be more relaxing that way.  When we are going somewhere, I&#39;ll say<br/>
something like,&quot;Let&#39;s go put on some pretty clothes to go to the library<br/>
(or wherever)&quot; and I always get compliance.  I think it is because my<br/>
6yo LOVES to dress pretty.   She usually picks out all of our outfits,<br/>
actually, since she loves it so much.  DH had her picking out his shirts<br/>
to wear for the day when she was just a few months old.  He appreciates<br/>
it since he hates doing it and she loves to get us all matching and<br/>
color coordinated.<br/>
<br/>
I bet your daughter would be really shocked if you told her that she<br/>
didn&#39;t have to make her bed or get dressed for the day!  She&#39;d probably<br/>
test you on it a few times and then do it herself (especially the<br/>
getting dressed part).  Could you go in and brush your teeth at the same<br/>
time as her in the morning?  Could you maybe have her brush your teeth<br/>
or something equally funny to her?  Does she get to pick out her own<br/>
toothbrush and toothpaste?  It took me a couple of years to figure out<br/>
that my daughter hated the taste of mint and that is why she didn&#39;t want<br/>
to brush her teeth.  She loves the strawberry though, and I think it is<br/>
disgusting.  She&#39;s also really into pretty things, so paying extra for a<br/>
&quot;pretty&quot; toothbrush is worth it to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-333878085">Pam, you say &quot;punishment, in general is a really, really bad idea&quot;.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t have to listen to me, because she thinks she&#39;s as smart <br/>
as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; me?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think punishment in general is a really, really bad idea. If <br/>
your <br/>
&gt; husband<br/>
&gt; &gt; slams the front door because he&#39;s had a terrible day at work, do <br/>
&gt; you take<br/>
&gt; &gt; away his door privileges? If you have an awful day and toss your <br/>
&gt; earrings at<br/>
&gt; &gt; the wall, are you denied jewelry for a certain period of time?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Respect begets respect, and parents have to first show it to <br/>
&gt; children before<br/>
&gt; &gt; they will get it back from the children. They learn by what we do <br/>
&gt; to them,<br/>
&gt; &gt; not what we say they should do. If you punish her, she&#39;ll want to <br/>
&gt; punish<br/>
&gt; &gt; you. If you try to control her (bed making, dressing, <br/>
toothbrushing <br/>
&gt; to your<br/>
&gt; &gt; timetable), she&#39;ll do what she can to seize back what control she <br/>
&gt; can.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If you sympathize with her pain, stop her from actually harming <br/>
&gt; herself and<br/>
&gt; &gt; others while not telling her the feelings themselves are wrong, <br/>
&gt; just her<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844877126">I have always believed in consequences for actions.  (When I was <br/>
working), if I didn&#39;t go to work, the consequence would be no pay, or <br/>
possibly losing my job.  If I don&#39;t take out the trash, it could <br/>
stink up the house.  If I leave toys on the floor, the dog will chew <br/>
them up.  Life is full of real consequences.<br/>
<br/>
How can I help my children grow to be responsible adults, if I don&#39;t <br/>
help them understand consequences?  If I don&#39;t help them to be <br/>
responsible?  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m getting my thoughts down correctly.<br/>
<br/>
If you always let your children quit something because they don&#39;t <br/>
feel like it, won&#39;t they grow to be quitters?  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I <br/>
don&#39;t want to force my child to continue playing an instrument she <br/>
dislikes, or doing something she hates to do.  <br/>
<br/>
One issue we had awhile back was volunteer work.  We volunteer weekly <br/>
at the local food bank.  It was fun for my daughter at first, but <br/>
she&#39;s losing interest.  It isn&#39;t exciting to her anymore.  She wanted <br/>
to quit.  An adult can&#39;t quit their job because they don&#39;t feel like <br/>
going to work anymore.  We have come to the agreement of only <br/>
volunteering once a month, that makes us both happy.  <br/>
<br/>
What if a child doesn&#39;t want to pick up their toys?  They&#39;re all over <br/>
the floor, and company is coming.  &quot;I don&#39;t want to&quot;, is what your <br/>
child tells you.  <br/>
<br/>
You need to go to the bank, but your child doesn&#39;t want to brush her <br/>
teeth and get dressed, she wants to read.  She doesn&#39;t budge.  She <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to go.  She&#39;s not listening to reason.  She&#39;s not old <br/>
enough to be left alone, and the bank closes in 1/2 hour.  <br/>
Consequences or punishment certainly seems in order, you&#39;ve got to <br/>
get the results you need, and fast!  (or is there another way, please <br/>
share with me!)<br/>
<br/>
I am truly open to your thoughts, but this is new to me.  I have <br/>
consequences on the brain, and I need deprogramming!  Unschooling is <br/>
wonderful and free, but I don&#39;t want my daughter to run the <br/>
household, where we adjust to her moods.<br/>

completes<br/>
&gt; &gt; those responsibilities, she is free to do whatever she chooses, <br/>
from<br/>
&gt; &gt; playing her violin, reading, watching tv, playing outside - the<br/>
&gt; &gt; choice is hers.  This doesn&#39;t seem unreasonable to me.  I have <br/>
been<br/>
&gt; &gt; reading many postings here, and am wondering if/how my &quot;requiring&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; her to do ANYTHING (chores, responsitilies etc) might have an <br/>
effect<br/>
&gt; &gt; on unschooling.  I don&#39;t require academics, or &quot;education&quot;, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; simple, basic hygiene etc.  Literally, if I didn&#39;t &quot;make&quot; her <br/>
brush<br/>
&gt; &gt; her teeth, she might not for a week.  (yuck!)  She battles me <br/>
about<br/>
&gt; &gt; these basic things!  I have tried numerous things to get these <br/>
things<br/>
&gt; &gt; taken care of, but could use any suggestions you may have.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When my daughters and I have a disagreement over basic <br/>
hygiene/safety/health<br/>
&gt; I tell them what I&#39;m worried about (cavities, etc.) We try to come <br/>
to an<br/>
&gt; agreement about when, how often, and if they want me to remind them <br/>
and how<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll approach it if they forget. There is nothing magical about <br/>
hopping out<br/>
&gt; of bed and brushing teeth. If she does it once or twice a day <br/>
sometime,<br/>
&gt; she&#39;ll get what benefit (and some say it&#39;s marginal benefit anyway, <br/>
and that<br/>
&gt; cavities-or-not are more genetic than anything) there is to be had.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Getting dressed and making her bed are matters of neither hygiene <br/>
nor health<br/>
&gt; (well, unless she wants to play naked in a snowstorm &lt;g&gt;). Those are<br/>
&gt; arguments I would drop like hot rocks. If her bed bothers you, make <br/>
it. :)<br/>
&gt; If seeing her in pjs until 3 p.m. bothers you, take deep breaths <br/>
and learn<br/>
&gt; to overcome it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; One more question, while I&#39;m at it.  How do you all deal with<br/>
&gt; &gt; disrespect?  Talking back, raising her voice to me, stomping,<br/>
&gt; &gt; slamming doors - she gets very frustrated when things don&#39;t <br/>
go &quot;just<br/>
&gt; &gt; right&quot;.  Yesterday it was violin.  She was playing, and didn&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; &gt; the song perfect.  She started to get angry.  I suggested she put <br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; away for a bit, and take it out later for a fresh start.  She <br/>
slammed<br/>
&gt; &gt; down the bow, knocked over her music stand in her huff, and <br/>
slammed<br/>
&gt; &gt; her bedroom door.  I have repeatedly talked to her, to help her<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand that it doesn&#39;t have to and isn&#39;t going to be perfect<br/>
&gt; &gt; everytime, etc etc...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This doesn&#39;t sound to me like disrespect. This sounds to me like <br/>
she doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want a lecture when she&#39;s feeling bad about violin. As a female with<br/>
&gt; perfectionist tendencies myself ;) I understand that the worst <br/>
thing someone<br/>
&gt; can do while I&#39;m in a huff over my own real or imagined <br/>
inadequacies is try<br/>
&gt; to talk rationally to me. Sympathy works better, &quot;I hate it when I <br/>
don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; something right. Here, punch this pillow.&quot; Or just leaving me alone <br/>
for a<br/>
&gt; bit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Later, after the slamming etc. is all done, she&#39;ll probably be more <br/>
ready to<br/>
&gt; talk calmly, but the conversation at that point might be about how <br/>
you can<br/>
&gt; help her learn to control her outburst and direct them toward <br/>
acceptable<br/>
&gt; outlets (scrubbing a bathtub in a huff or going into the yard and <br/>
running<br/>
&gt; around full speed are terrific, slamming doors and scaring the 3 <br/>
year old<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t). Telling her she shouldn&#39;t feel how she feels is not, IMHO, <br/>
the most<br/>
&gt; positive approach.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It isn&#39;t healthy for any of us to endure her attitude, (I also <br/>
have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3 year old boy that is copying her behaviors), there should be<br/>
&gt; &gt; consequences for her actions.  When she gets angry because her <br/>
game<br/>
&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t going well, she slams the playstation.  I take away her<br/>
&gt; &gt; playstation for the day - the punishment fits the crime.  But what<br/>
&gt; &gt; about general disrespect or attitude?  She pushing to see what the<br/>
&gt; &gt; limits are, that&#39;s for sure.  Sometimes I wonder if she thinks she<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t have to listen to me, because she thinks she&#39;s as smart as<br/>
&gt; &gt; me?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think punishment in general is a really, really bad idea. If your <br/>
husband<br/>
&gt; slams the front door because he&#39;s had a terrible day at work, do <br/>
you take<br/>
&gt; away his door privileges? If you have an awful day and toss your <br/>
earrings at<br/>
&gt; the wall, are you denied jewelry for a certain period of time?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Respect begets respect, and parents have to first show it to <br/>

&gt; they will get it back from the children. They learn by what we do <br/>
to them,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Doing nothing would be darned silly, you&#39;re right. :) Sandra Dodd <br/>
wrote something awhile back that has really helped us, which is <br/>
that she has told her boys, &quot;You can only hit after you get an adult <br/>
to come and help and that hasn&#39;t worked.&quot; If they hit before that, <br/>
she reminds them. She also takes the victim off someplace <br/>
calm and spends some time doing something calm with them <br/>
(finger painting or building blocks or some such for the 3 year <br/>
old) and that gives the hitter time to calm down, too, when they <br/>
can then be approached for conversation. I am assuming that <br/>
nobody in the house gets to hit anybody else (parent to parent, or <br/>
parent to child, or child to child) so it&#39;s not like she doesn&#39;t know <br/>
this, it&#39;s a matter of talking out better coping skills for the future.<br/>
<br/>
I would prevent her from hitting her younger brother if I possibly <br/>
could (if she does this a lot, her being 9 and him 3, I would <br/>
probably worry quite a bit and maybe think about some kind of <br/>
family counseling, that&#39;s a pretty big age difference for her to be <br/>
losing control to that point. Does she have her own toddler-free <br/>
space? Are they left on their own a lot or are you most always <br/>
there?) Yelling at him, ditto. I am assuming she&#39;s not just getting <br/>
into a tantrum, seeking him out wherever he is, just to pounce on <br/>
him and hit and yell -- I am assuming instead that he is <br/>
underfoot as all good 3-year olds strive to be and she&#39;s lashing <br/>
out in his general direction. In that case, I&#39;d be keeping tabs on <br/>
the 3 year old and keeping his peskiness to a low level while you <br/>
all sort this out together.<br/>
<br/>
Slamming doors and damaging walls are a much less serious <br/>
proposition. I might sit down with her in calm times and suggest <br/>
other steam-releasing things she can do -- whatever seems to fit <br/>
and work for her, whether it&#39;s exercise, hanging a punching bag <br/>
in the garage, or whatever. I might ask her nicely if she&#39;d help me <br/>
fix the wall, but would not make a big thing of it if she didn&#39;t want <br/>
to. I might tell her of times that I lost my temper and what I found <br/>
ultimately helped me not to act out (once, I threw an entire open <br/>
box of crackers at my husband. I was 29. Oy.)<br/>
<br/>
If my child yelled at me, I would turn my back and walk away (er, <br/>
take the 3 year old with you &lt;g&gt;) and approach them again when <br/>
they&#39;re calm and ask them not to do that again and talk again <br/>
about coping strategies (this will not work if you or her father yell <br/>
at her. What goes around comes around.)<br/>
 <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; something to do with the fact we spend months and $2,000+ <br/>
 </span></blockquote>remodeling <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it for her.  Ouch!  :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am hoping you know already that your spending whatever sum <br/>
of time and money was a gift, and gifts should be given free of <br/>
strings, whatever they cost. A gift that is used to control you is no <br/>
gift at all, it&#39;s a trap.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193241102">There&#39;s quite a bit in your post -- I&#39;m sure we could all go on for days about<br/>
consequences and motivation and learning to be a self directed learner. But,<br/>
in a nut shell, what I would consider is this:<br/>
<br/>
Ask yourself what shuts off communication between you and your daughter?<br/>
Because, if she isn&#39;t talking about what excites her or doesn&#39;t feel free to<br/>
share what&#39;s really going on with her without fear of recrimination then when<br/>
she does need your help she probably isn&#39;t going to ask for it. Ask yourself<br/>
how you can not only help keep her on track but also how you can be the one<br/>
she will feel free to ask for help if she does get stuck. If communication has<br/>
shut down this isn&#39;t going to happen. Keeping communication open between the<br/>
two of you should be on the top of the priority list, way above learning<br/>
responsibility or teaching consequences.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve noticed with my own volatile daughter is that she yells when<br/>
she feels like she isn&#39;t being heard. And it becomes a habit. Habits like that<br/>
take a while to wind down once they have gone into a loop for a while. Don&#39;t<br/>
expect changes to come fast or easy, but if you are patient and change the<br/>
feedback loop they will come.<br/>

&gt; &gt; positive approach.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It isn&#39;t healthy for any of us to endure her attitude, (I also<br/>
&gt; have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3 year old boy that is copying her behaviors), there should be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; consequences for her actions.  When she gets angry because her<br/>
&gt; game<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; isn&#39;t going well, she slams the playstation.  I take away her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; playstation for the day - the punishment fits the crime.  But what<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about general disrespect or attitude?  She pushing to see what the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; limits are, that&#39;s for sure.  Sometimes I wonder if she thinks she<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t have to listen to me, because she thinks she&#39;s as smart as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; me?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think punishment in general is a really, really bad idea. If your<br/>
&gt; husband<br/>
&gt; &gt; slams the front door because he&#39;s had a terrible day at work, do<br/>
&gt; you take<br/>
&gt; &gt; away his door privileges? If you have an awful day and toss your<br/>
&gt; earrings at<br/>
&gt; &gt; the wall, are you denied jewelry for a certain period of time?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Respect begets respect, and parents have to first show it to<br/>
&gt; children before<br/>
&gt; &gt; they will get it back from the children. They learn by what we do<br/>
&gt; to them,<br/>
&gt; &gt; not what we say they should do. If you punish her, she&#39;ll want to<br/>
&gt; punish<br/>
&gt; &gt; you. If you try to control her (bed making, dressing, toothbrushing<br/>
&gt; to your<br/>
&gt; &gt; timetable), she&#39;ll do what she can to seize back what control she<br/>
&gt; can.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you sympathize with her pain, stop her from actually harming<br/>
&gt; herself and<br/>
&gt; &gt; others while not telling her the feelings themselves are wrong,<br/>
&gt; just her<br/>
&gt; &gt; expression of them could use some work, I think you&#39;ll see a more<br/>
&gt; positive<br/>
&gt; &gt; response.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Helping a person understand potential (or even unavoidable) real<br/>
consequences is different to using a constructed &quot;consequence&quot; or even a<br/>
possibility that might be avoided to get another person to behave as you<br/>
wish.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you always let your children quit something because they don&#39;t<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps if we rephrase this - &quot;if you quit something because you don&#39;t<br/>
feel like doing it you will become a quitter - won&#39;t you?&quot;.  I<br/>
personally don&#39;t think so but your feeling on this might be different.<br/>
<br/>
I left out the &quot;let&quot; in that rephrase because there is a whole other<br/>
issue there - parent controlling child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One issue we had awhile back was volunteer work.  We volunteer weekly<br/>
&gt; at the local food bank.  It was fun for my daughter at first, but<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s losing interest.  It isn&#39;t exciting to her anymore.  She wanted<br/>
&gt; to quit.  An adult can&#39;t quit their job because they don&#39;t feel like<br/>
&gt; going to work anymore.  We have come to the agreement of only<br/>
&gt; volunteering once a month, that makes us both happy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is great that you found a way to handle this that suits you both.<br/>
Have you had a look at the comparison you put in there?  A choice to<br/>
volunteer services compared with a job?  In the realm of consequences if<br/>
you don&#39;t volunteer any more you don&#39;t forgo a paycheck.<br/>
<br/>
Also... an adult *can* quit their job because they don&#39;t feel like going<br/>
to work anymore - however most would carefully decide whether and when<br/>
to quit or not based on their finances, career/life change options,<br/>
sense of obligation to employers/clients and maybe other reasons.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What if a child doesn&#39;t want to pick up their toys?  They&#39;re all over<br/>
&gt; the floor, and company is coming.  &quot;I don&#39;t want to&quot;, is what your<br/>
&gt; child tells you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh I hate being in that situation. I haven&#39;t yet worked out a way to get<br/>
what I want in such situations, but I have learned that coercing my<br/>
children to do what I wish feels extremely unpleasant.  I&#39;m hoping to<br/>
see here again a variety of ideas for handling these situations.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You need to go to the bank, but your child doesn&#39;t want to brush her<br/>
&gt; teeth and get dressed, she wants to read.  She doesn&#39;t budge.  She<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t want to go.  She&#39;s not listening to reason.  She&#39;s not old<br/>
&gt; enough to be left alone, and the bank closes in 1/2 hour.<br/>
&gt; Consequences or punishment certainly seems in order, you&#39;ve got to<br/>
&gt; get the results you need, and fast!  (or is there another way, please<br/>
&gt; share with me!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay another tough situation I haven&#39;t learned how to avoid or tread<br/>
through in confidence, but I can share the various things I&#39;ve been<br/>
thinking about... Each time reminds me I should plan better of course.<br/>
I have to consider whether my errand really has to be done this day.<br/>
Perhaps it doesn&#39;t but I really want to, then I still have a right to<br/>
discuss ways for my wishes to fit with the family&#39;s activities.  But<br/>
lets say I feel this task does *have* to be done today - I would point<br/>
out the reasons for that priority.  I might also ask how I can help my<br/>
son/s (I only have boys) enjoy helping me meet this priority.  Perhaps<br/>
there is something exciting I can offer for t/he/m on the way back from<br/>
the bank?  Perhaps the preparation to leave is overwhelming - so maybe,<br/>
considering the urgency and deadline, maybe we can take toothbrushes in<br/>
the car, maybe we can leave our teeth this time and check each other for<br/>
*yucky* things in our teeth on our way out the door, maybe clothes can<br/>
go on over pjs, maybe we can wear easy outerclothes without<br/>
underclothes.  Reading can be done in the car, even in the bank.  I<br/>
don&#39;t have many neighbours but on one or two occasions, asking a nearby<br/>
acquaintance to mind a child for an hour or so could be an avenue worth<br/>
exploring.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-450139588"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have always believed in consequences for actions.  (When I was <br/>
&gt; working), if I didn&#39;t go to work, the consequence would be no pay, or<br/>
&gt; possibly losing my job.  If I don&#39;t take out the trash, it could<br/>
&gt; stink up the house.  If I leave toys on the floor, the dog will chew<br/>
&gt; them up.  Life is full of real consequences.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How can I help my children grow to be responsible adults, if I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; help them understand consequences?  If I don&#39;t help them to be<br/>
&gt; responsible?  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m getting my thoughts down correctly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve answered your own question: life is full of real consequences (don&#39;t<br/>
work: lose your job; don&#39;t pick up toys: dog eats them; don&#39;t close back<br/>
door: cat gets out and gets run over, etc.) Life can also unfortunately be<br/>
made up of arbitrary consequences: toss game control, Mom takes game away.<br/>
Now if the game control ITSELF ran and hid from her, that would be a natural<br/>
real-life consequence. &lt;g&gt; Maybe the game designers are working on that, but<br/>
meanwhile, anything you do to her along those lines is artificial, not an<br/>
inevitable real-life consequence.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you always let your children quit something because they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; feel like it, won&#39;t they grow to be quitters?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I think they grow up to be people who know how to decide what they want.<br/>
My daughters have tried lots of things. Some they stick with, some they<br/>
don&#39;t, some they come back to later. My oldest, for example, has started<br/>
classes or concerted efforts to learn: gymnastics, ice skating, Irish dance,<br/>
art, reading, and I know several other things I can&#39;t even remember right<br/>
now. She quit gymnastics, reading practice, and Irish dance after awhile<br/>
(Irish dance after one lesson, and if you don&#39;t think that caused me agonies<br/>
I had to suppress -- I mean come ON, I *LOVE* Riverdance &lt;gg&gt;) and quit and<br/>
then went back to ice skating. Her art classes were of limited duration only<br/>
because the teacher stopped teaching and I am frankly terrified of finding<br/>
her the &quot;wrong&quot; art teacher so I am taking a good deal of time over helping<br/>
her get to new classes.<br/>
<br/>
Through all of this, she is not afraid to try new things that interest her,<br/>
because she knows she CAN quit any time.<br/>
<br/>
How many things have you started, as an adult, and felt free to quit when<br/>
they bored you? I have gone through phases of crocheting, cross-stitch,<br/>
scrapbooking (likely to get back into that sometime), dog training (ditto),<br/>
dog showing (could not pay me enough to go back) and many more. I quit at my<br/>
whim, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s made me a worse person. I stick with faithfully<br/>
the things I really love and believe in: my marriage, homeschooling,<br/>
writing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One issue we had awhile back was volunteer work.  We volunteer weekly<br/>
&gt; at the local food bank.  It was fun for my daughter at first, but<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s losing interest.  It isn&#39;t exciting to her anymore.  She wanted<br/>

&gt; going to work anymore.  We have come to the agreement of only<br/>
&gt; volunteering once a month, that makes us both happy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>An adult CAN quit his or her job if they feel like it. There are natural<br/>
consequences and choices to be made as a result of it, but adults can and do<br/>
certainly do it all the time. I have quit jobs many times, for good and bad<br/>
and indifferent reasons.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad you were able to reach a compromise, but if she balks in future,<br/>
consider what a chore you may be making of helping people and the very real<br/>
possibility that she will learn to NOT want to help people in the future if<br/>
she is forced now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; What if a child doesn&#39;t want to pick up their toys?  They&#39;re all over<br/>
&gt; the floor, and company is coming.  &quot;I don&#39;t want to&quot;, is what your<br/>
&gt; child tells you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who invited the company? When we have people coming over, and I ask my<br/>
daughters to help and they ask why, I tell them as a half-joke, &quot;Come on,<br/>
you don&#39;t want people to see how we REALLY live!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s their company you can tell them what you expect before they ever<br/>
invite them. If it&#39;s your company, it&#39;s your cleaning problem. :) It would<br/>
be nice if they would help (and asked nicely, they probably will at least<br/>
sometimes) but it was not their choice to have people come over and disturb<br/>
all the lovely piles of things they&#39;ve accumulated on the couch. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; You need to go to the bank, but your child doesn&#39;t want to brush her<br/>

&gt; get the results you need, and fast!  (or is there another way, please<br/>
&gt; share with me!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the first question is, why wait until 1/2 hour before the bank closes<br/>
to make an apparent emergency trip? :) Good planning so as not to<br/>
inconvenience the rest of the family is a good start. Asking your husband to<br/>
do some banking at lunch is good. Online banking is lovely. Offering to do<br/>
something your daughter enjoys while you are out doing what you have to do,<br/>
or offering to do something for her at home that she likes in trade for<br/>
&quot;coming along quietly&quot; is another good way (yes, you can call it a bribe. I<br/>
call it being nice to my children so they will want to be nice to me and<br/>
nobody has to fight about the bank).<br/>
<br/>
Also, you can take a child wearing pajamas and harboring a stinky mouth into<br/>
a bank and nobody will arrest you. :) Some people will even smile, and<br/>
commiserate.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I am truly open to your thoughts, but this is new to me.  I have<br/>
&gt; consequences on the brain, and I need deprogramming!  Unschooling is<br/>
&gt; wonderful and free, but I don&#39;t want my daughter to run the<br/>
&gt; household, where we adjust to her moods.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are asking marvelous questions. Everyone in a family can run the<br/>
household as a joint adventure (Spaceship Townhouse, anyone? &lt;g&gt;) without<br/>
either 9 year old or Mom playing the role of Dictator, and in any family<br/>
we&#39;re all hopelessly destined to adjust to each others moods.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to share a story about teeth brushing. I had just returned from a <br/>
nurse practitioner conference. Drug company reps load you down with all sorts <br/>
of stuff. My ds Eric loved to help go through everything. He discovered a <br/>
poster of photos of the mouths of AIDS patients. Really graphic. I later <br/>
found the poster taped to his bathroom mirror. He wanted to see it everytime <br/>
he went to the bathroom to remind him of the consequences of poor dental <br/>
hygiene. I reminded him that he was not immunocompromised and probably <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have such severe results from an occasional lack of brushing. He <br/>
wanted it anyway. Kind of like a self-imposed &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; scenerio. I <br/>
removed it a few weeks later (the poster made his older sister gag everytime <br/>
she went in the br). Eric does a pretty good job of brushing his teeth. It&#39;s <br/>
routine.<br/>
<br/>
I know you&#39;ll not choose this technique, but I wanted to share this story. If <br/>
you haven&#39;t already, let her choose toothbrush and paste or even fluoride <br/>
rinses. The kid market is being targeted heavily. Take advantage of it. Try <br/>
brushing with her. Don&#39;t make it a battle. Kids usually come to see the <br/>
advantages of oral hygiene on their own. If she has routine dentist visits, <br/>
this also helps. There are many kid-friendly dentists out there. Our <br/>
dentist/hygienist make it fun for my two to come in. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-731252002">I wanted to add a thought to the toothbrushing discussion.  It is <br/>
very hard of me to let go control of toothbrushing.  I have never had <br/>
a cavity, and the thought of a dentist using a drill on my or my <br/>
children&#39;s teeth seems terrifying. I know intellectually that it&#39;s <br/>
not as bad as I&#39;m imagining it to me, but it&#39;s still a real fear.  I <br/>
have to make them brush their teeth or they&#39;ll get the *drill*!  It <br/>
sounds almost as terrifying to me as major surgery.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I religiously brushed my oldest daughter&#39;s teeth <br/>
every night before bed and she ended up with 3 cavities.  With my <br/>
second child, I&#39;ve skipped nights here and there (because I didn&#39;t <br/>
want to wake him up if he fell asleep early or he was in a bad mood <br/>
and I didn&#39;t feel like fighting him) and he&#39;s never had a cavity <br/>
yet.  <br/>
<br/>
I go back and forth.  Some nights I&#39;m ok if they don&#39;t brush, other <br/>
nights I get real rigid about teethbrushing.  I think I&#39;m still <br/>
deschooling the toothbrushing. :)<br/>
