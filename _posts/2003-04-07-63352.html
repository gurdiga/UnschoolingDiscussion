&gt; gives them the freedom to purchase as they see fit, not carry around lots <br/>

&gt; own spending. She couldn&#39;t wait to be old enough to get her own card, she <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;I&#39;d say take a vacation from all this - really TAKE a vacation - for a <br/>

&gt; unschooling IS following the interests of the child and helping them and <br/>
&gt; doing what you can for them.  Taking her out of school and away from the <br/>
&gt; demanding craziness of it all was a good thing.  She hasn&#39;t taken SATS for <br/>
&gt; YEARS but she knows about them and she&#39;s done them and they probably won&#39;t <br/>
&gt; be scary to her when they count for real.  So even though I wasn&#39;t sure it <br/>
&gt; was a good idea for a second or third grader to take such a test, I&#39;m sure <br/>
&gt; it had it&#39;s merits.  It didn&#39;t hurt her and she wanted to try it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay - this is not &quot;the SAT&quot; - the college entrance exam. This is just <br/>
one of the standardized tests sometimes given in public and private <br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>
You put that she&#39;d taken the SAT&#39;s in the context of how she was so <br/>
familiar with what she needed to do to become a doctor - so I thought <br/>
you meant the college entrance exams.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;So I&#39;ve done all that I feel comfortable with, I&#39;ve bought Algebra <br/>
 </span></blockquote>programs<br/>
for the computer, I&#39;ve sent her sites that talk about it, we&#39;ve <br/>
discussed the<br/>
prerequisites for college.  We have college brochures, we&#39;ve talked with<br/>
college coaches (she&#39;s an all-star cheerleader and a softball player). <br/>
We&#39;ve<br/>
both seen what it takes to get into college.  She&#39;s taken the SAT a <br/>
couple<br/>
times and she knows the math is like a foreign language she&#39;s never <br/>
learned<br/>
but she has no desire to learn it.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So - when she took these standardized tests in 2nd and 3rd grade the <br/>
arithmetic in them was like another language to her and she has no <br/>
desire to learn it? In 2nd and 3rd grade they were adding and <br/>
subtracting and just introducing multiplying and dividing. No <br/>
fractions, decimals, or percentages yet.  So -- just to be clear, you <br/>
are talking about algebra - so I assume she has somehow learned adding <br/>
and subtracting and multiplying and dividing, right? And other <br/>
arithmetic?<br/>

Cait scored a perfect score on the achievement tests for second and third <br/>
grade.  That made her eligible for the Johns Hopkins Talent Search classes, <br/>
they suggest taking the SAT to see where you should be placed and what <br/>
enrichment programs that you might be suited to.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d never heard of it, the teacher was gung ho about it, Cait wanted to do <br/>
it, her sister was going to go take it anyway and so she did.<br/>
<br/>
The next year she wanted to take it again &quot;just to see how she would do&quot;.  <br/>
She enjoys this, I do not enjoy taking her on a Saturday morning, EARLY.  <br/>
When I said she hadn&#39;t taken them in YEARS she just reminded me that yes she <br/>
did, when her brother took it a couple years ago, so did she, &quot;just for fun&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Not my idea of FUN in any sense of the word.<br/>

administered for ANY ages that choose to take it.<br/>

for years, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s where the get the names and addresses of the kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes there is a program for elementary aged children.  They need test scores <br/>
in order for your child to get into the enrichment programs (some of which <br/>
are great adventures) so you take the SAT at the high school or I think you <br/>
can do it at Slyvan now.  And it is the SAME test that the high schoolers <br/>
take, she did it at the same time as her older sister.  They don&#39;t expect <br/>
them to come close to a 1600 but it&#39;s their way of offering the enrichment <br/>
programs.<br/>
<br/>
There even may be other tests the let you take now to &quot;qualify&quot; it was a few <br/>
years ago that Cait was in second grade.<br/>

there were four others that were in her age range (not high school students) <br/>
I know Caits first test her combined scores were in the high six hundreds.  A <br/>
college bound student would be devastated but that was not the case with <br/>
Cait.  She thought it was &quot;cool&quot; that she did that well on a test that much <br/>
older kids had a hard time preparing for.  She just took it &quot;cold&quot; with no <br/>
prep because I simply didn&#39;t see the value in taking THE SAT in the second <br/>
grade but she wanted to do it.<br/>
<br/>
The next year her scores were in the 800, comparable to her sisters who was <br/>
in 11th grade, now she REALLY thought THAT was cool.<br/>
<br/>
I just asked her what her scores were two years ago when she took them with <br/>
her brother, she says she doesn&#39;t know but can look it up if it matters.  I <br/>
don&#39;t recall that they were outrageously high, I think her and her brother <br/>
were pretty much neck and neck.<br/>
<br/>
She enjoyed it, I HATE the thought of taking it as did two of the other three <br/>
who have taken them.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, that&#39;s what happens to children who have mothers who bought into the <br/>
whole SCHOOLING notion like I did.  The enrichment program was something she <br/>
was interested in AND she was completely bored with school. Every year she <br/>
was absent more and more for &quot;other&quot; more &quot;interesting&quot; activities that her <br/>
and I did at home.  Her last couple years she was absent more than she <br/>
attended so it took some time to convince DH that homeschooling was what we <br/>
both wanted. But after all the times she was home and we had great adventures <br/>
together and school really wasn&#39;t important he sorta understood or just <br/>
decided it was a loosing battle maybe.  <br/>
<br/>
A teacher once  threatened me with jail if she missed any more school (4th <br/>
grade) and I asked him why she needed to be there, he quickly replied &quot;so she <br/>
can learn&quot; I asked him what she WASN&#39;T learning and he had to shrug and admit <br/>
she had nearly perfect scores in everything he graded.<br/>
<br/>
Same thing happened in sixth grade, (which was the last straw) I met with <br/>

I have an older daughter in school. She was never given testing like that<br/>
when she was younger. A student and high IQ scores. I guess I should be<br/>

they give you certain grades, like second.  You don&#39;t HAVE to take the SAT&#39;S <br/>
at the high school but after the big build up and the pretty brochures the <br/>
kids bring home and how they tell you they&#39;ve &quot;qualified&quot; for this &quot;special&quot; <br/>
program, it&#39;s kinda hard to just tell them they don&#39;t need it.  So they are <br/>
excited and you let them try and horror of horrors, they LIKE it.  Who would <br/>
have guessed that a child would LIKE the SAT?<br/>
<br/>
Guess it&#39;s one of those things you don&#39;t know enough about it to be <br/>
intimidated by it, it was an HONOR almost to her to take it.<br/>
<br/>
I just shake my head and wonder...<br/>

<br/>
  Yep, that&#39;s what happens to children who have mothers who bought into the <br/>
  whole SCHOOLING notion like I did.  The enrichment program was something she <br/>
  was interested in AND she was completely bored with school. Every year she <br/>
  was absent more and more for &quot;other&quot; more &quot;interesting&quot; activities that her <br/>
  and I did at home.  Her last couple years she was absent more than she <br/>
  attended so it took some time to convince DH that homeschooling was what we <br/>
  both wanted. But after all the times she was home and we had great adventures <br/>
  together and school really wasn&#39;t important he sorta understood or just <br/>
  decided it was a loosing battle maybe.  <br/>
<br/>
  A teacher once  threatened me with jail if she missed any more school (4th <br/>
  grade) and I asked him why she needed to be there, he quickly replied &quot;so she <br/>
  can learn&quot; I asked him what she WASN&#39;T learning and he had to shrug and admit <br/>
  she had nearly perfect scores in everything he graded.<br/>
<br/>
  Same thing happened in sixth grade, (which was the last straw) I met with <br/>
  four teachers who were telling me how Cait&#39;s absences were affecting her <br/>
  education.  I asked for her grades, all A&#39;s.  I thought enough said.  Next <br/>

Glena, if your daughter likes noodling around with standardized tests<br/>
and feels very successful with them, maybe she would enjoy having an<br/>
MCAT book and looking at the types of questions that are on the sample tests.<br/>
