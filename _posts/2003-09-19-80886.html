<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526861031">I have a question about immunizations. Some of you may remember past <br/>
discussions about this, my stance has always been that it is a necessary thing because <br/>
that is what I was always taught; in nursing school and before that from <br/>
living in third world countries growing up. But, throughout the years, reading <br/>
here and elsewhere, I have now decided that it isn&#39;t something I want for my kids <br/>
anymore. <br/>
<br/>
The other day, we got a postcard from the kids pediatrician reminding that <br/>
both are due for annual check ups and that Jack still hasn&#39;t had his last round <br/>
of childhood immunizations and that Moly is due for a booster. (I don&#39;t <br/>
remember which one and I&#39;m not going to the fridge to look. &lt;g&gt;) This evening, Darin <br/>
noticed the card and asked me why Jack hasn&#39;t yet gotten his last shots and I <br/>
told him I didn&#39;t think I was going to have Jack go through with the rest. He <br/>
was kind of upset, but mostly wondering why. I explained my change of ideals <br/>
and we talked about this and other things like circumcision, and he said he <br/>
would think about it. He asked if, as we plan, we have another child, will this <br/>
child be circumcised if it is a boy and if I plan on going through the <br/>
immunization series and I said that no I did not plan on doing either. Darin thinks I <br/>
really should have Jack finish the series and get the booster for Moly. I was <br/>
hoping that those of you (especially those who vaccinated some of your kids <br/>
and not others) would share some more on why you chose not to and why you did <br/>
one child (or children) but not others. Thanks! <br/>

<br/>
My dd had tetanus when she was little, and I only gave her 1 booster (I<br/>
think 3 or 4 are recommended.)  I had planned on not giving her any<br/>
vaccines, but we were in a medical situation that really does call for<br/>
tetanus.  The reason I only gave her 1 booster is because while doing my<br/>
research I found that the extra boosters do not contribute to any extra<br/>
protection.  She was adequately covered for the incident, and really didn&#39;t<br/>
need anymore.<br/>
<br/>
In your case, I would say it really does depend on how old your kids are<br/>
and what vaccines you are talking about.  There are some vaccines I may end<br/>
up doing for my dd if she doesn&#39;t get the illness by the time she is a<br/>
teen, but we will see.  It&#39;s been awhile, so my mind doesn&#39;t really have<br/>
the facts... but I do remember when I was doing the research I decided that<br/>
if I had a boy I would most certainly consider the vaccine once he became a<br/>
teen/young adult.  Of course, by then the child is helping to make the<br/>
decision.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-26997178">We started out with immunizing our firstborn son.  He got the first <br/>
round of DPT at 2 months.  His leg got hot, and a knot came there, <br/>
and he cried and screamed for hours.  After getting the shot, a mole <br/>
started to grow at the place where the shot was given.  When I asked <br/>
doctors about it later, they said it could have nothing to do with <br/>
the shot.  But my baby did NOT have that mole there at birth, it only <br/>
came there after receiving the shot.<br/>
<br/>
Then he got the MMR at 12 months.  Shortly thereafter, he broke out <br/>
with red spots.  I took him to the emergency room.  They said it was <br/>
not unusual for some children to catch the disease from the shot.  So <br/>
what was the point of the shot, then?  The point was to keep them <br/>
from getting the disease, and he got it anyway?<br/>
<br/>
At that time I read &quot;DPT - A Shot in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Immunizations:  <br/>
Theory vs. Reality&quot; and learned the that whole theory behind why <br/>
immunizatons are supposed to work is a flawed theory.  Studies have <br/>
shown that the shots do not confer the true immunity that they are <br/>
supposed to confer. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I object to many of the additives put into the shots, which I <br/>
believe are harmful, such as aluminum, thimerisol (mercury) and <br/>
formaldehyde.  Formaldehyde polimerizes living tissue.  Also, some of <br/>
the growth mediums used to grow the cultures are just gross.  &quot;To <br/>
make a live vaccine, the live virus must be attenuated, or weakened <br/>
for human use.  This is accomplished by serial passage - passing the <br/>
virus through animal tissue several times to reduce its potency.  For <br/>
example, measles virus is passed through chick embryos, polio virus <br/>
through monkey kidneys, and the rubella virus through human diploid <br/>
cells - the dissected organs of an aborted fetus!&quot;  (quote from <br/>
Immunization:  Theory vs. Reality).  So since the virus passes <br/>
through animal tissue, it picks up animal RNA and DNA and this goes <br/>
into your child as well.  Who knows whether some of the reactions <br/>
children have to the shot is simply a reaction to the foreign animal <br/>
genetic material placed into their blood.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the body is strengthened after the true disease has run it&#39;s <br/>
course, and immunity has been conferred, but after taking the shots, <br/>
the body is not strengthened, it is compromised.<br/>
<br/>
In nature, you are probably only going to catch one disease at a <br/>
time, maybe two.  You immune system can handle this.  When they give <br/>
these shots, they give three, four or five combinations at once.  It <br/>
is very hard on the immune system to be bombarded with three to five <br/>
different diseases at the same time which it must fight off.  In <br/>
nature, you would not catch that many diseases at once.  So this is <br/>
an unnatural condition.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, most of the childhood diseases which killed so many can now be <br/>
successfully treated with antibiotics, they are not the threat they <br/>
once were.  The shots are more of a threat than the actual disease, <br/>
in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
This are just a few of the reason we chose not to take the shots.  <br/>
Along with the fact that, we do not take kindly to being told that we <br/>
HAVE to do anything, no matter what it is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-531954285">We struggled with this issue as well.  We did not immunize our first <br/>
until he was past 1yo.  I think any younger is just too compromising <br/>
to their immune systems.  We only did the ones we deemed as <br/>
necessary but then we enrolled him in preschool and had to do the <br/>
whole series.  I was not happy and should have filed for a religious <br/>
exemption even though we are not with any church.  I heard later it <br/>
was really easy to do so that was my fauly for not checking into it <br/>
further.  My second has had one round of polio and DTP.  I may or <br/>
may not do the boosters on those but have not decided.  He is not <br/>
going to school so I have no schedule for myself.  The only one I <br/>
may do is the tetnus because when my older son got stitches recently <br/>
after falling on glass they *required* it.  I was happy he already <br/>
had it since one more shot of anything may have put him over the <br/>
edge!!  I have heard if you do MMR you should do them as 3 seperate <br/>
shots, not one which has been one factor that has been pointed to as <br/>
a cause for autism.  My DR. gave me articles to disprove the theory <br/>
and although I agree it is most likely not the case, I would not bet <br/>
my child&#39;s health on it.<br/>
<br/>
IMO, any health &quot;initiative&quot; that is linked with BIG time money is <br/>
hard for me to have faith in.  Ever notice that in the last 10 years <br/>
we suddenly have a whole wave of new vaccines and they keep <br/>
growing.  Chicken Pox?  Come on, for the few cases who are serious I <br/>
am sure there are just as many reactions.  But drug companies have a <br/>
massive interest.  Can you imagine the amount of money earned for <br/>
every vaccine that is made mandatory.  I find it scary.  I also find <br/>
it scary that people just blindly follow their doctors and never <br/>
question anything.  The people who question the norm are viewed as <br/>
crazy although they are the ones who have taken the extra time to do <br/>
the research.  We are more educated and yet there is an implication <br/>
that we are the exact opposite.  I find it is similar with <br/>
homeschooling.  Everyone has to put their two cents in for why it <br/>
does not work and school is great, except these are the same people <br/>
who have NEVER read a single thing or investgated educational <br/>
options at all.  My DH was on the phone with his sister yesterday <br/>
and after she went on and on about how she spent all day running <br/>
around open house for the kids&#39; school and now at 9:30 pm she had to <br/>
check all 4 kids&#39; homework, she proceeded to be suprised that we <br/>
were still planning on homeschooling now that we moved to an area <br/>
with a great school.   DUH!!!!!!!!!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I was  hoping that those of you (especially those who vaccinated some of<br/>
your kids<br/>
 and not others) would share some more on why you chose not to and why you<br/>
did<br/>
one child (or children) but not others. Thanks!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From all 4 of my kids, each one has been vaccinated to a different degree.<br/>
Tara has had all shots necessary (by Dr. standards) because at that time I<br/>
didn&#39;t know one could refuse them, never heard of anyone doing so, and had<br/>
never looked into doing things any other way. When Joseph was born, I<br/>
started off the same way. He&#39;s had all his shots for the first 2 years. When<br/>
he was two, I joined my local homeschool support group. With that came new<br/>
questions regarding breastfeeding, circumcisions and vaccinations. So I<br/>
started to look into it. By this time, Sierra had already had her initial<br/>
shots too. I did a lot of reading on the internet, both for and against vacs<br/>
and talked to as many people as I could about it. By the time Sierra had her<br/>
first MMR, she had a terrible reaction and I had decided to stop them all at<br/>
that point. I think Joseph had one or two more than Sierra at that time. A<br/>
friend of mine had a husband who was some kind of scientist studying vacs<br/>
and she said if she knew then what she knew now, she would only do killed<br/>
polio and tetanus. And only after the child was 2. So I took all the info I<br/>
had, spoke with my husband and made decisions based on what we could live<br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
Giving our kids all the vacs, which had some nasty stuff in them, given way<br/>
too young as far as I was concerned and way too many at once and take a<br/>
chance on something happening. Or not giving them anymore and taking a<br/>
chance on them catching something and then how that would affect them. It&#39;s<br/>
a risk either way for some people. So we decided we were more comfortable<br/>
with no vaccinating. Our last child hasn&#39;t had one.<br/>
<br/>
A parent really has to do the work and be totally comfortable with the<br/>
decision they make for their kids. Either for or against.<br/>

I can&#39;t answer your whole question as I only have 1<br/>
child. Lyndsey has not had any immunizations. We made<br/>
that decision from lots of research. Her doctor is<br/>
okay with this as Tom and I are both from medical<br/>
backgrounds and medically aware of what is going on in<br/>
our community.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>FYI, it is possible, but extremely difficult, to get just plain tetanus.<br/>
I&#39;ve done it.  Most physicians won&#39;t even allow for the possibility, so<br/>
often people are given a false &#39;no, this can&#39;t be done&#39;.  The key is that<br/>
tetanus only hasn&#39;t been tested on all ages, so getting it for a young<br/>
child can be challenging.  But as I said, I&#39;ve done it.  Also, IMHO, I<br/>
don&#39;t think I would ever get a tetanus vax as a prevention unless I were<br/>
going to be out in the bush for awhile, away from immediate medical<br/>
treatments.  Why infect a healthy body?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602746656">After the MMRs, my son Evan&#39;s immunological system became so weak that <br/>
he is now allergic to 17 different allergens. He may have been already <br/>
had the allergies. The fact is that he never got sick before the MMRs <br/>
and immediately thereafter he went from one cold or flu to the other, <br/>
had his first asthma attack within months, had a horrible reaction to <br/>
antibiotics AND developed irritable bowel syndrome. We stopped all <br/>
immunization, especially after his first asthma attack.<br/>
<br/>
I also changed peds and looked for a FAMILY MD who, would not only care <br/>
to learn all about our family history but who could practice <br/>
homeopathy. We&#39;ve been treated homeopathically now for about 3.5 years<br/>
<br/>
As to immunization, I asked how he felt about it. He responded with <br/>
another question: &quot;Are you going anytime soon to Bombay?&quot; Not to insult <br/>
all Bombay residents out there, but his point was that, from a public <br/>
health POV it was not an issue.<br/>
