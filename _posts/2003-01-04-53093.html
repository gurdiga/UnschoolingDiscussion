I like reading Ben Franklin, but what I think I&#39;m reading from you is<br/>
getting on my nerves.<br/>
Let&#39;s just talk about unschooling and IDEAS and let it be.<br/>
If you don&#39;t like a post, delete.   If you don&#39;t like a style, delete.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, on to unschooling.<br/>
We were at the video store today.   We&#39;re always at the video store. <br/>
Recently they&#39;ve been remodeling and they&#39;ve done a nice job.   The<br/>
owners are neighbors of ours across the ally and creek.   I used to pull<br/>
their little kid out of the water when he&#39;d escape from the yard. <br/>
Anyway, they put in a nice new front door, looks great, and while I was<br/>
talking with the lady there, Dylan was looking around, just looking<br/>
around at the ceiling and the door.   Finally he says,  &quot;you know, if<br/>
there was a fire and part of the ceiling fell right here you couldn&#39;t get<br/>
the door open to get out.&quot;   Silence.    The door opens inward.  <br/>
Her husband walks through and notices the blank look on his wife&#39;s face, <br/>
 &quot;What?&quot;   Dylan, ten year old annoying person, repeats what he just told<br/>
Mrs. Video.    Mrs. Video says something about isn&#39;t there a fire code<br/>
and did he check it and, and, and...   I&#39;m trying to sneak out but he&#39;s<br/>
standing in front of the door (that opens inward.)   We finally did get<br/>
out of there and I asked Dylan where he learned about fire codes and he<br/>
says &quot;What&#39;s a fire code?&quot;   &lt;g&gt;    We came home and looked up Montana<br/>
fire codes.   <br/>
All that learning and on a Saturday, too!  <br/>

<br/>
Into film meaning film making?  Is the fulltime work film related?<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has been working extra much, because of inventory and another employee <br/>
leaving.  His armor is nearly finished.   I need to make a pair of pants to <br/>
go over his leg armor, which is articulated kydex (black plastic stuff), and <br/>
he needs gauntlets.<br/>
<br/>
Marty and I have had a lot of interaction lately over online sharings (games, <br/>
sites), watching Kevin Smith question and answer stuff (a two-DVD set we <br/>
rented of Kevin Smith speaking at various universities, all edited up so it <br/>
kinda flows--very interesting), and he&#39;s been extra talkative lately.<br/>
<br/>
Holly got a camcorder for Christmas and has made two little plays-on-video <br/>
with some friends of hers.  They have a list of proposed other scenarios, and <br/>
they&#39;ve voted and rated them in order.  Monday I think they&#39;re doing one with <br/>
stuffed animals moved puppet-like, and they&#39;re doing something like Family <br/>
Feud.  They write their little scripts (not on paper, they just plan them in <br/>
the air, but they rehearse and have some specific dialog, and some ad lib).  <br/>
<br/>
For a year they&#39;ve done these as plays, and once they did some as a radio <br/>
talk show on audio tape.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday night Keith, Marty and Kirby had a manly outing to &quot;Smackdown,&quot; the <br/>
local live visitation of the WWE gladiatorial soap opera.  <br/>
<br/>
Friday night, Keith, Kirby, Holly and I went to a folksinging party.  They&#39;re <br/>
monthly, but we hadn&#39;t been since last Spring for various reasons.  I had a <br/>
GREAT time.  When we left I thought it was about midnight and Kirby thought <br/>
it was about 11:00.  It was 1:00.  That means I had a good time and Kirby had <br/>
an even better time.  There was a teenaged girl there he&#39;s known since they <br/>
were both little.  She&#39;s leaving for college in fall, and Kirby&#39;s usually <br/>
busy on Friday nights.  She lives in Los Alamos, and so is only in town for <br/>
singing parties.  They were in the room for some of the singing, but part of <br/>
the time they were taking dogs for walks and other outside activities.  The <br/>
house we go to was a farm, long ago, and the outbuildings are all still <br/>
there.  There are big stables (a cow barn) and chicken coops and Kirby said <br/>
they talked about past years when they played here and there, and hid from <br/>
the younger kids, and they went and peeked through the places they had used <br/>
for hiding places with lookouts.  I asked if they had to squat down to peek <br/>
through, and he said yes.  She&#39;s still pretty short, but Kirby&#39;s 5&#39;10&quot; or <br/>
-11&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Marty  hadn&#39;t wanted to go to that.  He stayed here with his friend Joey.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, Holly is in the kitchen setting up for a snack for me and her, <br/>
Keith is in the back watching football, and Kirby and Marty are at a D&D <br/>
game.   <br/>
<br/>
I spent an hour and a half talking to an old friend (who&#39;s a former boyfriend <br/>
from early days, Jr. High) about another old friend (former college <br/>
boyfriend) who is listed in the footnotes of a book the former is working on, <br/>
and he&#39;s needing to call him and talk to him after not having seen him for 27 <br/>
years or so.  So I was briefing him on some things he might say and might <br/>
want not say in that conversation, and I ended up crying.  It was cathartic <br/>
but I hadn&#39;t scheduled any catharsis this evening.  It&#39;s wonderful to have a <br/>
friend who knows me so well that when I tell a story that stretches from 1973 <br/>
to 1981, he knows all the other characters, can picture each of the four <br/>
houses involved in the sequence, and can remind me of things I&#39;m forgetting, <br/>
because he was there too.  <br/>
<br/>
Earlier today I was helping another homeschooling mom take notes and do some <br/>
research for a trip to a lawyer Monday.  She might be leaving her husband.  <br/>
That was stress and might have been the seed for the later emotion.  <br/>
<br/>
I notice that discussing unschooling doesn&#39;t limit itself to kids.  They&#39;re <br/>
learning by example from what we do.  Kirby&#39;s seeing that his friendship with <br/>
Rowan could be for life, as mine with Frank&#39;s is.  Holly&#39;s seeing Keith <br/>
resting after working on armor and tents today, and me not bugging him to do <br/>
something with me instead of watching football; that&#39;s useful!  (Last night <br/>
he drove us the 25 miles to that party, and sang, and waited patiently until <br/>
we were all ready to come home.)   Holly&#39;s seeing the stages people can go <br/>
through coming to marital and family decisions, in knowing the family in <br/>
crisis.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty busy day, all in all.<br/>
<br/>
About that humility lecture &quot;someone&quot; got (I think it was me, but I&#39;d hate to <br/>
be accused of arrogance again)...<br/>

No, he&#39;s working for his dad putting cones on baby trees.  Those are the<br/>
flexible plastic protectors they put on newly planted conifers to keep the<br/>
deer from eating them.  It&#39;s good money - piecework - so the harder he<br/>
works, the more he makes.<br/>

Interesting.  That was the part of the class that Lars did *not* like.  In<br/>
fact, he spoke to the teacher and told her his interests.  She brought in<br/>
another teacher to work with him on editing while the rest of the group<br/>
worked on story.<br/>

year she is teaching other people right now and doing a promo video for a <br/>
gymnastic center.  <br/>

I&#39;ve been doing the nostalgia thing, too.  Yesterday I helped my brother<br/>
move.  It was chaotic, because he is a total pack rat, but it was great<br/>
because he has things that were my grandmother&#39;s and things from our<br/>
childhood that I haven&#39;t seen in ages.  He also has a huge and eclectic<br/>
collection of books.  So on some future day that&#39;s less hectic, I&#39;m<br/>
gonna rent my own moving van &lt;g&gt; and drive over and visit him and borrow<br/>
a HUGE pile of books.  (Something to look forward to during the wet months.)<br/>

My other upcoming project is terracing the steep slope in the corner of<br/>
our new backyard.  Anyone have any expertise in building retaining walls<br/>
that they&#39;d care to pass on?<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; What interesting things have your kids been up to lately<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here was our day.  I&#39;m leaving the kids&#39; names out since I&#39;m not sure <br/>
if it&#39;s safe to post them on the web or not.  ds-5 means my 5 year <br/>
old son and ds-3 means my 3 year old son.  Dd is 9. <br/>
<br/>
Dd went to a friend&#39;s house today to go sleigh riding.  While getting <br/>
ready to leave the house, ds-5 was putting his socks on and he <br/>
mentioned the &quot;M&#39;s&quot; on his socks.  I told him that they aren&#39;t M&#39;s, <br/>
they&#39;re W&#39;s.  I explained the difference.  <br/>
<br/>
Before I took dd to her friend&#39;s house, I stopped at the library to <br/>
pick up some interlibrary loan books I had requested.  On the way to <br/>
the library, dd was asking me questions about snow, so I picked her <br/>
up a book about Snowflake Bentley.  I also picked up a silly book <br/>
about a sheep who was having a hard time falling asleep, since she&#39;s <br/>
been having some problems falling asleep on her own.  She read the <br/>
books on the way to her friend&#39;s house and liked them.  <br/>
<br/>
On the way home from dropping dd off, ds-3 was hungry for nuggets, so <br/>
I went through McDonald&#39;s drive through and got him a kids&#39; meal.  <br/>
Then we  went to Wal-mart to pick up a few groceries.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, ds-5 had me write things on signs for a &quot;club&quot; the kids <br/>
were having in the livingroom.  One of them said &quot;You can do anything <br/>
in this room at 7:00.&quot;  I have NO idea why he had me write that!  <br/>
Today he was looking at that sign and was asking me how he would know <br/>
when it was 7:00.  I showed him the microwave numbers and showed him <br/>
that instead of a 2 being there for the hour, a 7 would be there.  <br/>
Then I changed the time on the microwave clock for 7:00 to show him <br/>
what it would look like.  He and ds-3 had a blast changing the clock <br/>
time on the microwave.  When he couldn&#39;t put a time on the clock <br/>
(something like 9:87), he asked why and I explained that there are <br/>
only 60 minutes in an hour, and that once you hit :59, it changes <br/>
over to the next hour.  Therefore, you can&#39;t have a number higher <br/>
than a 5 in the second spot.  I don&#39;t know if he got that completely, <br/>
but I&#39;m sure that what he needed to know at the moment was able to <br/>
sink in.  A child&#39;s mind is beautiful. :)  <br/>
<br/>
While I went to pick dd up, dh and ds-5 started playing the Rush Hour <br/>
game.  We were pleasantly surprised at how well he did on the game!  <br/>
He spent 15 minutes concentrating and studying one of the puzzles <br/>
before he figured it out.  Who says little boys don&#39;t have big <br/>
attention spans!  They just need to be concentrating on something <br/>
that they care about!  <br/>
<br/>
Dd spent some time working on Cluefinder&#39;s Toy Store computer game.  <br/>
It involved a lot of math problems, and she struggled a lot with <br/>
them.  I was in the middle of a project and couldn&#39;t really help her <br/>
much, except for little suggestions here and there.  She worked <br/>
through a lot of the problems on her own with minimal help, even <br/>
though she was frustrated.  When she had challenged herself just <br/>
enough, she quit the game.  <br/>
<br/>
I played &quot;Reindeer&quot; with ds-3.  This game usually involves him <br/>
putting a Santa hat on himself and a reindeer antler headband on me.  <br/>
He holds on to the back of my pants and tells me to fly.  When he <br/>
wants me to stop, he gives me a wedgie. I can&#39;t complain though, <br/>
because &quot;Reindeer don&#39;t talk&quot;.  He goes into the foyer, climbs down <br/>
the chimney (climbs over the couch into the livingroom), and puts a <br/>
present under the tree.  Then he climbs back over the couch and tells <br/>
me to fly to the playroom for more toys.   The game didn&#39;t last very <br/>
long today without the Christmas tree.  He says that he misses it. <br/>
<br/>
Ds-5 and I spent some time on his bunk bed writing tickets for his <br/>
club.  He had me write, &quot;***&#39;s Club&quot; on a piece of paper.  He wrote <br/>
MOM above it.  That is my ticket.  Then he asked me how to <br/>
spell, &quot;****(the name of his sister) is not allowed&quot; and he wrote it <br/>
on a piece of paper.  I am amazed at how well he writes letters <br/>
considering how little time we&#39;ve spent on it!  When he asked what a <br/>
W looked like, I reminded him about the W&#39;s on his socks this <br/>
morning.  Dd got very upset that she wasn&#39;t allowed in his club and <br/>
she tore up the paper.  ds-5 started crying about it.  I think what <br/>
he was really upset about is that he had spent so much time writing <br/>
it for it to get ripped up so soon.  But let&#39;s face it--his <br/>
motivation in writing that was to antagonize his sister, and he can&#39;t <br/>
expect to write something like that and not get it ripped up.  Dd <br/>
asked me why I spelled allowed the way I did.  She thought it was <br/>
spelled aloud.  I explained the difference to her.  What an <br/>
interesting spelling lesson!  While this was going on in the top <br/>
bunk, ds-3 was having his own little Santa Clause Club in the lower <br/>
bed.  When ds-5 kicked her out of his club, ds-3 invited dd to his <br/>
Santa club.  I wonder how long this Santa obsession will last!  <br/>
<br/>
Ds-3 helped me make peanut butter cookies this evening.  His big job <br/>
was pressing the buttons on the microwave.  He loves it and that is <br/>
how he is learning his numbers!  Ds-5 also warmed up his supper by <br/>
asking me which buttons to press on the microwave.  <br/>
<br/>
The kids just watched a movie together.  Ds-5 colored a paper plate <br/>
for me with a heart on one side and on the other side &quot;Mom&quot;. He says <br/>
it is a frisbee.  He is asking me to help him find his new Thomas <br/>
computer game that he got for Christmas.  After I search for that for <br/>
a few minutes, we&#39;re off to bed!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-522649321">**Yesterday, ds-5 had me write things on signs for a &quot;club&quot; the kids <br/>
were having in the livingroom.  One of them said &quot;You can do anything <br/>
in this room at 7:00.&quot;  I have NO idea why he had me write that!  **<br/>
<br/>
Well, so many signs forbid things (Keep OFF the Grass) that it&#39;s nice to<br/>
have a sign that does the reverse and gives permission.<br/>
<br/>
I read a cute library book called The Signmaker&#39;s Apprentice.  A kid who<br/>
works with a signmaker gets a chance to enjoy the power of making and<br/>
posting his own signs.  Of course the first sign he makes says &quot;No<br/>
School Today&quot;.  (Yay!  That makes it an un-schooling book.)<br/>

the class.  Does I Movie sound right?  (He&#39;s asleep, so I can&#39;t ask him.)<br/>
We&#39;ve got Adobe Premiere, but he hasn&#39;t learned how to use it yet.<br/>
<br/>
On the same topic . . . The local hs teen group did 2 or 3 years of learning<br/>
to make videos with a hs dad who was a camera man.  One of the boys went on<br/>
and took a short course at the Gulf Islands Film and Television School,<br/>
after which he was hired on by a brand new TV station here in Victoria.  He<br/>
later got downsized, which I found out is common with new stations.  The<br/>
experienced people don&#39;t want to do the grunt work of working out the kinks<br/>
at a new station, so they hire inexperienced people to start, then let them<br/>
go and hire the experienced people.  At any rate, Sam got some good<br/>
experience out of it and then took another more advanced class at GIFTS.<br/>
He&#39;s off any day now for England on some kind of work exchange program.<br/>
He&#39;s hoping to find something in film there.<br/>
