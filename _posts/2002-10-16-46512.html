<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740566253">We&#39;ve just started to follow a &quot;paleo-diet&quot; (I like that term), and, while <br/>
it&#39;s been tough, seems to be working.  I&#39;ve always had high <br/>
cholesterol/triglycerides, and I&#39;m currently waiting to see the results of <br/>
my last bloodwork to see if this diet has made any change in my #&#39;s.  My <br/>
wife is a diabetic, and she&#39;s noticed large improvements in her blood <br/>
sugar measurements.<br/>
