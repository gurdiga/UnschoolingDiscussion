<div id="ygrps-yiv-728716748">OK, I memorized these in school, but so many years later have forgotten<br/>
some of them.<br/>
IMO, there is no use in forcing anyone to memorize the times tables. <br/>
Once a person understands arithmetic, there are many ways to figure out<br/>
the answer to a problem.  Also, learning the times tables and spouting<br/>
answers to multiplication problems are two different things. <br/>
  But, if your daughter WANTS to learn them, here are some ideas:<br/>
Practice counting by each number, by 2&#39;s, then by 3&#39;s, etc.  You can use<br/>
&quot;counters&quot; if she wants and group them by the number - 10 groups of six<br/>
beans or coins - In the beginning, she can count each one, saying the<br/>
sixth one loud.  1,2,3,4,5,SIX, 7,8,9,10,11,TWELVE, etc.  If she repeats<br/>
this enough, she&#39;ll finally be able to say just the sixth number each<br/>
time.  I got this idea from a Dorling Kindersley book &quot;Times Tables&quot;. <br/>
They do it with pictures, for the 4&#39;s there is an animal with 4 legs so<br/>
they count the legs.<br/>
Put it to music or chanting or a rap beat and say them with her over and<br/>
over.  Or record it on a cassette that she can listen to repeatedly.<br/>
John Holt suggested making a blank times table and let the child figure<br/>
out the answers and fill it in.  (If the child wants to)<br/>

If you want to do everything yourself,<br/>
insist on being the only one who can do it right.<br/>

This sounds like fun, but is reinforcing what they have memorized, not<br/>
teaching it.<br/>

Step Relay and Throw Daddy in the Pool Math.<br/>
Then each<br/>
of us ask our team mate a multiplication question.  When they answer<br/>
correctly, they take a giant step forward and ask the other person a<br/>
multiplication question.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
