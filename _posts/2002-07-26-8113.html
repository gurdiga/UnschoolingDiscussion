&gt; <br/>
&gt; her that she was ignorant (not stupid, ignorant - the girl was very <br/>
&gt; intelligent) and Tammy got all excited.  &quot;I know what *that* means.  It <br/>
&gt; means I&#39;m ignoring you.&quot;  . . . . sigh.<br/>

what they mean. He was fine in school---for the tests--- because we would use <br/>
mnemonic devises like crazy to help him memorize for the test. He ALWAYS asks <br/>
what things mean, and I&#39;m glad he doesn&#39;t fear asking us. Some kids give him <br/>
a hard time. We never have---we just tell him again the definition. His <br/>
friends are kind and tell him too. <br/>
<br/>
He WANTS to be able to remember. Anyone have any good ideas? <br/>
<br/>
Some jokes are difficult for him too (especially if they&#39;re funny *because* <br/>
of language); he&#39;ll giggle politely and then say, &quot;I don&#39;t get it&quot;---and we <br/>
explain. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042940515">How does he do with mathematics? That is a language,<br/>
too. Except the jokes are exact...like prime<br/>
numbers...and it requires a slightly different sort of<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps as he has more that he wants to communicate<br/>
the words will become more available to him. Do he use<br/>
words, himself, that he doesn&#39;t understand when he<br/>
hears them? Does he understand these same words when<br/>
he reads them? What about words that are names of<br/>
components of things,such as axle, radiator, bearing?<br/>
Does he get confused with words that have different<br/>
meanings in different contexts, such as bearing?<br/>
<br/>
I was just conversing with some neuro-physcologists<br/>
(one was pediatric) about something similar. It was an<br/>
MS support list. If you can e more details I&#39;ll pass<br/>
it along and if there is feedback e it to you off<br/>
list.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Poorly. Likes geometry---is very spatial, artistic, athletic. Doesn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; <br/>
math. Understands physics, but not the words/lingo.<br/>

<br/>
Do he use &gt; words, himself, that he doesn&#39;t understand when he<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hears them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. He&#39;d rather not speak.---You met him!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;Does he understand these same words when<br/>
 </span></blockquote>he reads them? &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t read much &quot;literature&quot;. IM&#39;s mostly. Magazines. Will ask about a word <br/>
that occurs often in a book I read out loud.<br/>
<br/>
What about words that are names of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; components of things,such as axle, radiator, bearing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t know. Any other examples?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does he get confused with words that have different<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. Sometimes.<br/>
