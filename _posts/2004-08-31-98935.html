<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774261532">Weeee&#39;re baaack! And, I had a great time, though I cried half the <br/>
weekend because I didn&#39;t have my kids with me. *lame*  The conference <br/>
was amazing, and I&#39;m already really looking forward to next year! Ren, <br/>
let me know if there&#39;s anything I can do to help.<br/>
<br/>
I was lucky enough to pick up the last set of Sandra&#39;s thinking sticks, <br/>
and Emily (7) loves them! We played twice last night and again this <br/>
morning, and she&#39;s asking to play again and finding new ways to play <br/>
with them. For those who don&#39;t know, the sticks are about making <br/>
connnections. So, you throw out two sticks, which will have two <br/>
different categories on them, and those playing make connections between <br/>
the two.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, Emily seemed so amazing to me--it was great to see how her <br/>
mind works. Even at 7, she was making some really interesting <br/>
connections. She got computers/ containers and said that computers were <br/>
&quot;like a big storage box of knowledge.&quot; Then she got safety/ economics <br/>
and made the connection that lifeguards have to pay money for <br/>
certifications to get their job. For music/ cooking, she made up a cool <br/>
song about cooking in the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Sandra! Well worth the money!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265656693">Well, when Sandra Dodd gets back, bug her about when she&#39;s going to be <br/>
making more. *eg*  I know you can order them from her, and they sure are <br/>
a lot of fun. When I first heard people talking about them, I was kinda <br/>
like, &quot;oh, okay...&quot; But, once you see them and play with them, you&#39;re <br/>
hooked! They&#39;re a stroke of brilliance!<br/>
