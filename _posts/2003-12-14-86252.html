<div id="ygrps-yiv-721578437"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Recommending convoluted connections to a child isn&#39;t a child making a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>connection.  It&#39;s an adult making a confusing recommendation.<br/>
~~~<br/>
 Or even some things which really are helpful to people- if they need them-<br/>
are really *unhelpful* to people if they don&#39;t need them-<br/>
<br/>
When I was in high school there was a whole section in our English book<br/>
about the difference between &quot;effect&quot; and &quot;affect&quot;-   I remember thinking,<br/>
why would anyone need that?  It is so clear which is which, I never ever<br/>
even thought of them as similar words- I pronounced them differently in my<br/>
head.<br/>
<br/>
BUT after that &quot;lesson&quot; I, from then on- till NOW,- get them mixed up.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be giving me stuff I don&#39;t want or need.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I heard it on an unschooling board too, and Marty, the only lefty of our<br/>
 </span></blockquote>kids, was helped by me just drawing that one time and saying &quot;look how &#39;bed&#39;<br/>
looks.&quot;  That was enough.  I showed him at the moment he cared and was<br/>
asking.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If we just wait until they need the information, then simple and clear<br/>
 </span></blockquote>will<br/>
very likely work.<br/>
<br/>
Wait for when I care and am asking- then give it to me simply and clearly<br/>
with no extra &quot;fluff&quot; you think I should know.<br/>
