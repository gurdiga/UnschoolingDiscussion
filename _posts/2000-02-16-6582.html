<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972377501">I had recieved a brochure on the Earth Box a couple of months ago. It is simply a self-contained &quot;garden&quot; that uses fertilizer, potting soil, and a mulch cover. My interest is more in the self watering feature, for last year was very dry and even with watering some of our plants still died. I have found a little info on some of the garden searches but have yet to find anyone who has actually used one. They look like a wonderful concept but with shipping run about 36.00 (us dollars) each. <br/>
They do have a toll-free 800 number listed under Earth Box or if anyone needs the addy, feel free to e-mail me and I will gladly respond. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-833144403">Please send me the address for the earth box. My 7 year old loves the idea of a garden, but we have a small yard. This sounds like a great alternative. Thanks.<br/>
