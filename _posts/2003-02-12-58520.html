<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292522918">Evanston Homeschool Educators is having a miniconference in June and Northside Unschoolers (Chicago) are having a one day fair/workshop in the spring.  You can get more info at their websites (at least who to call re: more information).<br/>

  Clonlara, an Alternative School with a HBEP in Ann Arbor, Michigan has a<br/>
  yearly conference in the spring.<br/>
  The conference is generally held somewhere near Ann Arbor, Great Conference,<br/>
  I highly recommend it.  And driving there from Illinois is a piece of cake<br/>
  compared to Montana!<br/>
