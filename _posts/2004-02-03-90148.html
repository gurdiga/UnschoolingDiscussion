Would he be interested in writing reviews for Amazon.com of his favorite <br/>

something and then when you and he are satisfied with the technicalities, it <br/>
could be pasted into the review box at Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
Or what about a game review or walkthrough or tip for a gaming page, if he&#39;s <br/>
a video gaming guy?<br/>
<br/>
Or what about descriptions of items for sale on e-Bay?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to think of the real writing people do online.<br/>
<br/>
Does it have to be in his own handwriting?  I&#39;m guessing no.<br/>

I really like your ideas Sandra.  I think I will try them.<br/>

me).&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
What EXACTLY does PA law say? <br/>
<br/>
SC law says high schoolers must study &quot;literature and composition&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Well, Shakespeare is certainly considered &quot;literature&quot; , right? Shakespeare <br/>
really shouldn&#39;t be READ----it should be experienced. Films and plays are a <br/>
better way of experiencing Shakespeare. Same for Tennesee Williams! There are <br/>
many ways to experience literature. Required readings in my high school were Lost <br/>
Horizons, One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest (you can discuss the diffferent <br/>
endings), The Agony and the Ecstasy, 1984, A Clockwork Orange, Shakespeare, .... <br/>
you get the picture. The PICTURE! &lt;g&gt; Three are also books on tape. We prefer <br/>
the movies. Movies and TV and documentaries can also cover &quot;history&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
SC also requires composition. Define composition!<br/>
<br/>
Art is a composition. So&#39;s music. So&#39;s supper!<br/>
<br/>
I know what they MEAN, but there&#39;s nothing that says I need to use a school <br/>
definition of that word. I compose ALL the time. The conference was a major <br/>
composition! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Cameron writes, directs, film, edits, and COMPOSES mini-films. I don&#39;t <br/>
consider the screen-play the composition. I define the WHOLE thing as a composition. <br/>
His drumming and guitar playing are compositions. His regular posting on <br/>
message boards is composition.<br/>
<br/>
Unless PA specifically defines the words, I figure you can be quite creative! <br/>
<br/>
I admit to not knowing the law in PA, but at 15, he would probably be mature <br/>
enough to understand the ramifications and be willing to write *something* <br/>
down for you if it meant that he could keep unschooling! He could read a book or <br/>
watch a movie, you could both discuss it while the tape recorder was running, <br/>
and you/he could transcribe his words into a &quot;discussion paper&quot;.  You could <br/>
together learn Haiku and write a few poems. I&#39;m guessing the state just wants a <br/>
few examples per year. At 15, maybe he&#39;d be willing to give you a few (if <br/>
you&#39;re not willing to move! &lt;BWEG&gt;).<br/>
