<div id="ygrps-yiv-369893629">Has the question been asked or answered as to how many unschooled kids there<br/>
are in the U.S. or the world? I recently saw some stats that there are ~2.5<br/>
million homeschool kids in the U.S. and that about 13% of respondents<br/>
classified their style as unschooling. That would be 325,000 unschoolers in<br/>
the U.S. alone. I don&#39;t know where these studies get their stats because<br/>
many homeschoolers never register with the government. My family has not<br/>
registered so how could we be included in such a stat? Anyway, I would<br/>
imagine that many/most unschoolers would look to lists such as<br/>
AlwaysLearning for discussion and ideas, yet there are &lt; 2000 members on the<br/>
largest unschooling lists. If each member on the list represents 2, 3, or<br/>
even 5 kids then there are still more than a quarter million unschoolers<br/>
unaccounted for. I&#39;m interested in hearing any thoughts on these stats. How<br/>
many unschoolers are there?<br/>

It just happens to be located in Oregon... where there are a LOT of<br/>
non-compliant homeschoolers.  I&#39;m not sure about other places around the<br/>
US or the world, but I know that about half the homeschoolers I know in<br/>
real life in Oregon are non-compliant.<br/>
<br/>
Technically, unschooling IS homeschooling, so we get lumped in with<br/>
those statistics and I&#39;m fine with that!<br/>

<br/>
Even if we had a way to count all the unschoolers, there would be  <br/>
questions about the counting.  If someone doesn&#39;t buy a curriculum  <br/>
but requires their kids to do schoolwork so that they can make good  <br/>
scores on tests, would that be unschooling?  That family might think  <br/>
so and say so and that would be enough for census takers.   If  <br/>
someone registered to homeschool a teen and hasn&#39;t seen the kid for  <br/>
over six months, should that count?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone can come up with a reliable number that&#39;s even  <br/>
close, high or low either one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-136940596">I&#39;m probably going to play the devil&#39;s advocate here. But there is a good reason to register other than it being the law. It helps us to keep our rights to homeschool because it gives proof that we are out there, that we are law abiding and for those that do the testing required we have those tests to prove that homeschooling works. Then legislator cannot complain that we don&#39;t know what we are doing and take our rights away.<br/>

<br/>
There are very many places in which testing is not a requirement,  <br/>
registered or not.<br/>
There are many people who don&#39;t want their children tested because of  <br/>
the effects testing has on children&#39;s self-esteem and the  <br/>
relationship between children and their parents (even if the test  <br/>
scores are high, it changes the dynamic).<br/>
<br/>
Even in some places where testing seems at first to be required,  <br/>
there are often alternatives (summary, evaluation without  <br/>
standardized tests, portfolio, registration with Clonlara or an  <br/>
outside cover school of some sort).<br/>
<br/>
-=-Then legislator cannot complain that we don&#39;t know what we are  <br/>

<br/>
Schools keep us safe from the government requiring school for  <br/>
everyone.  Every graduate who can&#39;t read or write, every school  <br/>
shooting or stabbing, is another reason the government can&#39;t afford  <br/>
(financially) to force everyone into those buildings.  And they  <br/>
haven&#39;t, anyway, in any place where parochial or private schools are  <br/>
an option.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-833996474">Thanks for all of the responses. I would be really surprised if there were<br/>
close to 325,000 unschooled kids in the US. It&#39;s really amazing to think<br/>
about 2.5 million homeschooled kids being out there &quot;some where&quot;. Do those<br/>
numbers seem big or small to anyone?<br/>
<br/>
The people we meet at the grocery store usually look at us like we are<br/>
freaks or abusive and claim to have never met homeschool kids &quot;in person&quot;.<br/>
Usually they know someone who has a friend or relative that homeschool&#39;s and<br/>
those are rarely good sources of opinion (my stepmom being any reference).<br/>
Recently someone said to my daughter that she was very happy, polite, and<br/>
social, &quot;especially for never being around other people&quot;. Then, I&#39;m thinking<br/>
to myself, &quot;well we are standing here in front of you right now trying to do<br/>
our shopping aren&#39;t we?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If there are so many homeschoolers, 50,000 in every state on average, then<br/>
where are they? How many unschoolers come to the large conferences? Our<br/>
first will be LIG next year and we are very excited to meet some of you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465071722">That agrees with my gut feeling on the numbers. If someone buys 5<br/>
curriculum, they might count for 5 kids. It doesn&#39;t really matter, but the<br/>
2.5 million number shocked me and I could imagine that the true figures are<br/>
much much lower. It does of course depend, as you say, on the definitions of<br/>
homeschool or unschool. It would be nice to be able to tell the frightened<br/>
relatives that we are not the only ones &quot;doing this to our kids&quot;.<br/>

How many unschoolers does it take to change a light bulb?<br/>
<br/>
Dad: &quot;We don&#39;t have any dim-bulbs around here!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mom: &quot;Well, of course the parents take care of it until the children  <br/>
are ready to learn how to change the bulb. It&#39;s a readiness issue.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Blonde Child #1: &quot;What&#39;s a light bulb?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Delight Directed: &quot;If the child has shown an aptitude or interest in  <br/>
the light bulb, we will let him change it by himself!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unit Study : &quot;First we will go to the library and check out some  <br/>
books, then.......you know the rest of this one :)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Charlotte Mason: &quot;If the light bulbs go out, we will just play  <br/>
outside all day!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Classical: &quot;Hark, what lightbulb in yonder ceiling breaks!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Moore Method: &quot;We will wait until the child is tall enough to reach  <br/>
the lightbulb.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Textbook Method: &quot;We haven&#39;t done that chapter yet!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Blonde Boy Child: &quot;First you let it grow.&quot;<br/>
Mom: &quot;What??&quot;<br/>
Blonde Boy Child: &quot;The Plant.&quot;<br/>

Blonde Boy Child: &quot;Isn&#39;t there a plant called a bulb?&quot;<br/>
Mom: &quot;Ahhhh, isn&#39;t he the smartest thing???!!! That&#39;s my smart little  <br/>
sweet thing, give me high five!&quot;<br/>

Principle Approach: Jesus said; &quot;I am the light of the world.&quot;<br/>
So I say, Who needs light bulbs!?<br/>

Susannah Sheffer:<br/>
“How many homeschoolers does it take to screw in a light bulb?”<br/>
<br/>
“Well, we’re not exactly sure how many homeschoolers. Estimates vary.  <br/>
Depends<br/>
on the way you count them. The curriculum suppliers have one number…”<br/>
<br/>
=======<br/>
<br/>
How many traditional homeschoolers does it take to change a light bulb?<br/>
None. Electricity isn’t in the curriculum on today’s schedule.  <br/>
They’ll have to call the electrician on the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
=========<br/>
<br/>
How many Unit Study Method homeschoolers does it take to change a  <br/>
light bulb?<br/>
Before beginning the study, mom contacts HSDLA to see if there is a  <br/>
legal loophole to change a light bulb without first asking the local  <br/>
department of education.<br/>
<br/>
She then contacts the co-op to see if there is enough interest to  <br/>
have a field trip to watch the changing of the light bulb.<br/>
<br/>
The co-op then forms a committee to determine whether this is a  <br/>
homeschooling or unschooling type of activity.<br/>
<br/>
Then, mom checks three books on electricity out of the library, then  <br/>
the kids make models of light bulbs, read a biography of Thomas  <br/>
Edison and do a skit based on his life.<br/>
<br/>
Next, everyone studies the history of lighting methods, wrapping up  <br/>
with dipping their own candles.<br/>
<br/>
Next, everyone takes a trip to the store where they compare types of  <br/>
light bulbs as well as prices and figure out how much change they&#39;ll  <br/>
get if they buy two bulbs for $1.99 and pay with a five dollar bill.<br/>
<br/>
On the way home, a discussion develops over the history of money and  <br/>
also Abraham Lincoln, as his picture is on the five dollar bill.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, after building a homemade ladder out of branches dragged  <br/>
from the woods, the light bulb is installed.<br/>
<br/>
And there is light.<br/>
<br/>
So the answer is: No less than 5.<br/>

- How many home educators does it take to change a light bulb?<br/>
- Only one, but you must make sure you mark it down to physics  <br/>
(electricity and light), technology, PE (climbing ladder), logical  <br/>
reasoning and social skills (well we can&#39;t see each other in the  <br/>
dark, can we?)<br/>
<br/>
- How many curriculum-based homeschoolers...?<br/>
- None. Home electrics isn&#39;t something that should be studied until  <br/>
at least age 14, so they&#39;ll have to call in the electrician at the  <br/>
weekend.<br/>
<br/>
- How many unschoolers or autonomous educators...?<br/>
- As many as want to, whenever they feel like it. But they&#39;ll  <br/>
probably need a whole box of lightbulbs, because they&#39;ll want to  <br/>
experiment to find out how to make them break.<br/>
<br/>
- How many TCS educators?<br/>
- The trouble is, the old lightbulb doesn&#39;t want to be removed.  <br/>
Difficult to find a win-win situation here, but after some  <br/>
brainstorming, the solution is to buy an entire new light fitting and  <br/>
re-wire the room, while leaving the old lightbulb where it was.<br/>
<br/>
- How many yuppy home educators?<br/>
- Two - one to call the electrician, and one to pour the sherry.<br/>
<br/>
- How many feminist home educators?<br/>
- One. And it&#39;s NOT FUNNY!<br/>
<br/>
- How many UK home educating families...?<br/>
- Estimates vary, but nobody really knows.<br/>

There was a time you could just cite the fact that there were glossy  <br/>
magazines out there, but I don&#39;t know if any are left.  Life Learning  <br/>
closed, though they&#39;ve added a learning section to their other  <br/>
magazine, and put out a really nice book  called Life Learning.  Buy  <br/>
that for your relatives and don&#39;t tell them anything, maybe. If they  <br/>
start to ask you questions or criticize you, say &quot;Have you read that  <br/>
book yet?&quot;  And that will keep them at bay a while, and once they&#39;ve  <br/>
read the book they&#39;ll soften up about the questions.<br/>

&gt; books, then.......you know the rest of this one :)&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Charlotte Mason: &quot;If the light bulbs go out, we will just play<br/>
&gt; outside all day!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Classical: &quot;Hark, what lightbulb in yonder ceiling breaks!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Moore Method: &quot;We will wait until the child is tall enough to reach<br/>
&gt; the lightbulb.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Textbook Method: &quot;We haven&#39;t done that chapter yet!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Blonde Boy Child: &quot;First you let it grow.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Mom: &quot;What??&quot;<br/>
&gt; Blonde Boy Child: &quot;The Plant.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Mom: &quot;What plant?&quot;<br/>
&gt; Blonde Boy Child: &quot;Isn&#39;t there a plant called a bulb?&quot;<br/>
&gt; Mom: &quot;Ahhhh, isn&#39;t he the smartest thing???!!! That&#39;s my smart little<br/>
&gt; sweet thing, give me high five!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Principle Approach: Jesus said; &quot;I am the light of the world.&quot;<br/>
&gt; So I say, Who needs light bulbs!?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ========<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Susannah Sheffer:<br/>
&gt; “How many homeschoolers does it take to screw in a light bulb?”<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; “Well, we’re not exactly sure how many homeschoolers. Estimates vary.<br/>
&gt; Depends<br/>
&gt; on the way you count them. The curriculum suppliers have one number…”<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; =======<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How many traditional homeschoolers does it take to change a light  <br/>
&gt; bulb?<br/>
&gt; None. Electricity isn’t in the curriculum on today’s schedule.<br/>
&gt; They’ll have to call the electrician on the weekend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; =========<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How many Unit Study Method homeschoolers does it take to change a<br/>
&gt; light bulb?<br/>
&gt; Before beginning the study, mom contacts HSDLA to see if there is a<br/>
&gt; legal loophole to change a light bulb without first asking the local<br/>
&gt; department of education.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She then contacts the co-op to see if there is enough interest to<br/>
&gt; have a field trip to watch the changing of the light bulb.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The co-op then forms a committee to determine whether this is a<br/>
&gt; homeschooling or unschooling type of activity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then, mom checks three books on electricity out of the library, then<br/>
&gt; the kids make models of light bulbs, read a biography of Thomas<br/>
&gt; Edison and do a skit based on his life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Next, everyone studies the history of lighting methods, wrapping up<br/>
&gt; with dipping their own candles.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Next, everyone takes a trip to the store where they compare types of<br/>
&gt; light bulbs as well as prices and figure out how much change they&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; get if they buy two bulbs for $1.99 and pay with a five dollar bill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the way home, a discussion develops over the history of money and<br/>
&gt; also Abraham Lincoln, as his picture is on the five dollar bill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Finally, after building a homemade ladder out of branches dragged<br/>
&gt; from the woods, the light bulb is installed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And there is light.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So the answer is: No less than 5.<br/>

&gt; - How many home educators does it take to change a light bulb?<br/>
&gt; - Only one, but you must make sure you mark it down to physics<br/>
&gt; (electricity and light), technology, PE (climbing ladder), logical<br/>
&gt; reasoning and social skills (well we can&#39;t see each other in the<br/>
&gt; dark, can we?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - How many curriculum-based homeschoolers...?<br/>
&gt; - None. Home electrics isn&#39;t something that should be studied until<br/>
&gt; at least age 14, so they&#39;ll have to call in the electrician at the<br/>
&gt; weekend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - How many unschoolers or autonomous educators...?<br/>
&gt; - As many as want to, whenever they feel like it. But they&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; probably need a whole box of lightbulbs, because they&#39;ll want to<br/>
&gt; experiment to find out how to make them break.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - How many TCS educators?<br/>
&gt; - The trouble is, the old lightbulb doesn&#39;t want to be removed.<br/>
&gt; Difficult to find a win-win situation here, but after some<br/>
&gt; brainstorming, the solution is to buy an entire new light fitting and<br/>
&gt; re-wire the room, while leaving the old lightbulb where it was.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - How many yuppy home educators?<br/>
&gt; - Two - one to call the electrician, and one to pour the sherry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - How many feminist home educators?<br/>
&gt; - One. And it&#39;s NOT FUNNY!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - How many UK home educating families...?<br/>
&gt; - Estimates vary, but nobody really knows.<br/>

Have you been getting e-mail from HSLDA?  I hope you didn&#39;t give them  <br/>

<br/>
WHAT two evils?<br/>
<br/>
I see testing as one of many evils inherent in the government system  <br/>
of education.<br/>
<br/>
There are MANY joys and learning opportunities and tales of real-life  <br/>
unschooled teens and young adults getting great experiences and jobs  <br/>
without a single test in sight.  There are no &quot;two evils&quot; between  <br/>
which we must choose.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well the education unions certainly have an agenda to eliminate<br/>
homeschooling because it threatens their jobs.<br/>
<br/>
My take on it, is that by complying with laws that I feel are wrong, I<br/>
am accepting them to be right.  I feel pretty strongly that governmental<br/>
oversite of homeschoolers is not a good thing, so I don&#39;t comply with<br/>
it.  If, at some point I must, then I will.<br/>
<br/>
The state in which I live has relatively easy laws to comply with, but<br/>
it requires testing.  The tests are expensive and I would be required to<br/>
pay for them out of pocket, to prove that my kids are reaching a<br/>
benchmark that I don&#39;t agree with in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t particularly care wether or not the government or anyone else<br/>
thinks that how I&#39;m choosing to educate my kids works or not.  I care<br/>
about what my kids think of how we do things, that&#39;s where I put my<br/>
focus and energy, and honestly, testing and oversite get in the way of<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Census taking has always been about taxation and accountability.  I&#39;m<br/>
saving the government a lot of money by keeping my kids out of school,<br/>
especially since I still pay taxes for it.  Government oversite of<br/>
homeschoolers is largely about money, taxes and census taking.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s similar around the world, since census taking isn&#39;t a new<br/>
or revolutionary way to track people and money.</div>

I have my hands poised to talk about &quot;the education unions&quot; (there  <br/>
are two, in the U.S.) and it&#39;s just politics and it&#39;s  not about  <br/>
natural learning, and it doesn&#39;t apply to all the countries  <br/>
represented by readers on this list, so let&#39;s just not go there.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have to drag dirt home with our kids.  We don&#39;t need to drag  <br/>
the politics of education home, or into this list.<br/>

(apportionment). But, I&#39;ve used census data a lot, as an economist/ <br/>
statistician. I can&#39;t think of what it has to do with taxation or  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Meaning our right to continue to homeschool in the USA and elsewhere?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes HSLDA has represented a family in court and they&#39;ve &quot;over- <br/>
complied&quot; by offering more than what the law actually requires. In my  <br/>
state, private schools (which is what we are) do not have to keep any  <br/>
academic records or follow any curriculum or do any assessing or  <br/>
testing. HSLDA lawyers have  provided such academic records to  <br/>
government officials because they are acting in what they, as the  <br/>
attorneys of a specific family, feel is best for that particular  <br/>
family. It is a bit like plea bargaining. Unfortunately, it sets up  <br/>
the rest of us to have the same demands made on us. Lawyers who  <br/>
represent specific clients have to consider what&#39;s best for those  <br/>
clients - that can be and often is a conflict of interest with what is  <br/>
good for homeschoolers, in general. Also, HSLDA used to not support  <br/>
unschooling at all - memberships were rejected if you admitted not  <br/>
using a curriculum. They&#39;ve become more &quot;enlightened&quot; and they accept  <br/>
unschoolers (usually called &quot;delight-driven homeschoolers&quot; in the  <br/>
fundamentalist Christian community) but they very much urge all  <br/>
homeschoolers to use a curriculum, keep records, do testing, etc.,  <br/>
because it makes mounting a legal defense easier.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Despite what unfortunate things happen to public school students and  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No - that&#39;s much too strong a statement to be true. I don&#39;t think  <br/>
there are people anywhere working &quot;daily&quot; to try to take away our  <br/>
ability to homeschool. In my state, I don&#39;t think there is really  <br/>
anybody working at all to take away that right - not anymore. Our  <br/>
governor supports it, our state superintendent of public instruction  <br/>
supports it, our legislature supports it, and our court system  <br/>
supports it. The teachers unions don&#39;t support it, but they are not  <br/>
actively working against it, either - they have bigger fish to fry  <br/>
these days.<br/>
<br/>
Some states are way easier to unschool in freely than others. Some  <br/>
countries are pretty much impossible. We all do what we have to do to  <br/>
keep ourselves and our families safe from legal problems that might  <br/>
interfere with carrying on our happy lives. For unschoolers, that  <br/>
means protecting our children as much as we can from &quot;academic&quot;  <br/>
reporting demands.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The testing is the less of the two evils... and just because they  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Testing is not required in most states. I believe the only states in  <br/>
which it is required are: Arkansas, Georgia (not submitted), Minnesota  <br/>
(not submitted), New York, North Carolina, Oregon, and South Dakota.   <br/>
Pennsylvania and Washington also have testing requirements unless you  <br/>
work with a credentialed teacher. Testing is an option in other  <br/>
states, but there are legal alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
I know we&#39;d rather talk more about learning and less about the  <br/>
legalities here - my point in delving in a little has to do with  <br/>
focusing on clear thinking and good information. I think those are  <br/>
important ingredients in a good unschooling home and something worth  <br/>
striving for. Question Everything! That&#39;s a good unschooling motto.<br/>
