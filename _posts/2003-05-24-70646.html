Time to jump in. First, I&#39;M BACK! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
HEY!!!<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering about you the other day.<br/>
<br/>
Very sorry about your dad.  It kinda changes the color of the world not to <br/>
have a dad when you&#39;re used to having one; it did mine, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you&#39;re here.<br/>

It does change things doesn&#39;t it. I identified him at the hospital and <br/>
that single act of seeing him just put my whole life in a different <br/>
light. It&#39;s like I became at that moment not just an adult but an <br/>
individual. It&#39;s more than &quot;cutting the cord&quot; with birth --what I saw <br/>
was my own flesh and blood being no more. And that has given me a sense <br/>
of urgency about the life I want to not just live but share with my <br/>
loved ones and eventually the world.<br/>
<br/>
My father, btw, was a victim of dementia. He was one of the first <br/>
Olympic athletes to represent Puerto Rico and his body was completely <br/>
malformed by the disease. Although he was active before this happened <br/>
to him, depression, a runaway diabetes and high-blood pressure did him <br/>
in. I just want to die like my gypsy great-grandmother --standing.<br/>
<br/>
So between taking care of my body, my mind and my soul, I&#39;ve been busy. <br/>
It&#39;s been a good busy --the kind that would make my father proud.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

What a wonderful legacy your dad has left....not only to you & your family, but also to those you touch - as in this group.<br/>

My heartfelt sympathies,<br/>
