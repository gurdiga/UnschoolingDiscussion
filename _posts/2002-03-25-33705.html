<div id="ygrps-yiv-359870175">...from my own personal unschooling guru. :o)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in the process of planning a trip down to NM and AZ (to visit people on <br/>
this list!). I was all set to go in April when I realized that I had signed <br/>
Conor up for a class on designing web pages during that time. (Conor has <br/>
been wanting to learn. He liked the class idea BTW)<br/>
<br/>
I sent a frantic email to Jon (my dh) to solicit his advice. Would Conor <br/>
freak out if he got behind in the class, should I postpone or maybe cancel a <br/>
really cool trip, should we talk to the reacher and find out what he will <br/>
miss....? Obviously I should talk to Conor, but what did he think???!!!<br/>
<br/>
This is the wonderfully calming wise note I received back.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;He can always take another web design class. In fact it is assured that he <br/>
&gt;&gt;will be taking another one if he has any interest anyway, because it&#39;s not <br/>
&gt;&gt;like one little class is going to teach him anything beyond the barest <br/>
&gt;&gt;basics.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t sweat it about missing one, even though we spent 8 million <br/>
dollars on it...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ahhh, my sweet and wonderful high-school drop-out hubby. It just comes so <br/>
naturally for him.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
