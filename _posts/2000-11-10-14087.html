<div id="ygrps-yiv-73255744">In May 1915, during the second battle at Ypres, Belgium, Major John McCrae,<br/>
a Canadian surgeon found himself in a horrifying situation.  For some 17<br/>
days, he tended the hundreds of injured and dying men; the casualties of<br/>
trench warfare.<br/>
<br/>
 Never in his career had he witnessed so much pain and suffering.  His<br/>
anquish on that battlefield gave him the inspiration to write a poem; a poem<br/>
which not only pays homage to those who died in that conflict, but perhaps<br/>
more importantly, admonishes the beneficiaries of their sacrifice, to never<br/>
forget; to live their lives in such a way that those who died will not have<br/>
died in vain.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In Flanders fields the poppies blow<br/>
Between the crosses, row on row,<br/>
That mark our place; and in the sky<br/>
The larks, still bravely singing, fly<br/>
Scarce heard amid the guns below.<br/>
We are the Dead. Short days ago<br/>
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,<br/>
Loved and were loved, and now we lie<br/>
In Flanders fields.<br/>
Take up our quarrel with the foe:<br/>
To you from failing hands we throw<br/>
The torch; be yours to hold it high.<br/>
If ye break with us who die<br/>
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow<br/>
In Flanders fields.<br/>
    --Major John McCrae<br/>
<br/>
May we all take some time this Veteran&#39;s Day to remember those who died, and<br/>
recommit ourselves to the cause of peace.<br/>
<br/>
John Andersen<br/>
