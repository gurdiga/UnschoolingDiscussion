&gt; really? LOL then my kids are slow, too, because my almost 11 year old <br/>
&gt; boy has &quot;10,000 robots&quot; (who, btw, all get to vote, when we&#39;re <br/>
&gt; deciding Rummikubes or Kings in the Corner) and my 9 year old girl has<br/>
&gt; robots, too. Enemy robots and friend robots. Always battling things <br/>
&gt; out, not infrequently, in the grocery store with LOTS of noise. LOL<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My 15 year old had a goblin named Rover until she was about 10.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; slow kids. tut.<br/>

of them, plus a badger and some other critters. A few were hideously <br/>
malformed in some way, and some of them weren&#39;t quite sane. We had conversations with <br/>
the squirrels. <br/>
<br/>
Julian&#39;s 14 now. The squirrels were here until about six months ago. I miss <br/>
them, although Julian doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
When Julian was little he had a (male) imaginary friend named Tanya who was <br/>
dead. Except that he talked to him. We wondered whether we should call the <br/>
Center for Grieving Children so he could get support for the loss of his dead <br/>
imaginary friend, except that Tanya was dead from the beginning...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, never mind. He&#39;s just a weird kid.<br/>
