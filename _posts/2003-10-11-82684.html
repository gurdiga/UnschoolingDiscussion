&gt; <br/>
&gt; www.unschooling.com has a teen space.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unschoolers In Action October 10 - 12:54 pm <br/>
&gt; A Place for unschooling kids and teens to hang out and find one another. <br/>
&gt; Teen Space <br/>
&gt; Unschooling Kids <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; That bottom part is the direct address of the teen topics.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; People have to be registered at the site to post on kids/teens, but it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; free <br/>
&gt; and easy to do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At the bottom of that page, &quot;get started&quot; and then click &quot;getting an <br/>
&gt; account.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But they can read without posting.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If a bunch of us told our kids about it all at once, the whole area might <br/>
&gt; perk up a bunch!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They can start their own topics or add to what&#39;s there.  (Maybe you only <br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; to be registered to start a new topic, and not just to post.  I don&#39;t know, <br/>
&gt; because I&#39;m registered. &lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t read the teen boards, though.  There&#39;s <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; TON of stuff there for unschooling parents to read, outside the teen area.  <br/>
&gt; The <br/>
&gt; address for the main page of the discussion list is:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I sent Logan, my 15 yo son, the link and told him about the message board. I <br/>
am only afraid he will become as hooked as me and I will never get the <br/>
computer back. He is into the &quot;Adult Swim&quot; on cartoon network and Anime and I saw <br/>
sever posts about these topics, I thought I would respect their privacey and not <br/>
read. I must say it was relieving to find that other teens share his interests <br/>
so I must not be doing everything wrong, lol.<br/>

Adult Swim and Anime are two BIG interests of my son Conor (14). <br/>
Nothing wrong here. :o) He sometimes posts at the message boards, but <br/>
not too often. He doesn&#39;t do much writing...yet. It&#39;ll come.<br/>
<br/>
Has your son seen the VH1 special about cartoons? It went through the <br/>
history and progression of style, content and form of many of the <br/>
cutting edge cartoons. It had interviews with different cartoonists <br/>
talking about who influenced, who was ground-breaking and why, and <br/>
who they just plain old love. Very cool.<br/>
<br/>
