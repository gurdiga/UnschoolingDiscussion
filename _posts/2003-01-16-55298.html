Welcome to 2003, and a new edition of the best unschooling newsletter<br/>
online! Due to the illness and death of my father, the Unschooling.com<br/>
Online News was not published in November or December. I hope you&#39;ve<br/>
missed it just a little bit. And as always, I hope this collection of<br/>
thoughts and musings leaves you thinking and searching for more.<br/>

How to Raise a Respected Child<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I really believe that unschooling works best when parents trust a child&#39;s<br/>
personhood, his intelligence, his instincts, his potential to be mature and<br/>
calm. Take any of that away, and the child becomes smaller and<br/>
powerless to some degree.<br/>
<br/>
Give them power and respect, and they become respected and powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Is it just that simple? That a parent can GIVE a child power and respect?<br/>
Can a parent give a child freedom?&quot;<br/>

Life, the Universe, and Everything<br/>
<br/>
One way to get the student to come out from hiding is to do all we can to<br/>
legitimize his interests. In other words, to make him feel that whatever<br/>
he is interested in is OK, a perfectly good place from which to look at and <br/>
begin to explore the world, as good as any other, indeed better than any<br/>
other. We will not make him feel this unless we understand ourselves<br/>
that it is true. This will be hard for people who have for years been mis-<br/>
schooled into thinking that life, the world, human experience, are divided<br/>
up into disciplines or subjects or bodies of knowledge, some of them<br/>
serious, noble, important, others ignoble and trivial. It is not so. The<br/>
world and human experience are one whole. There are no dotted lines in it<br/>
separating History from Geography or Chemistry or Physics. In fact, out<br/>
there, there are no such things as History or Geography or Chemistry or<br/>
Physics. Out there is --- out there. But the world, the universe, human<br/>
experience, are vast. We can&#39;t take them in all at once. So we choose,<br/>
sensibly enough, to look at this part of reality, or that; to ask this kind<br/>
of question about it, or that. If we look at one part, in one way, and ask<br/>
one kind of question, we may be thinking like a historian; if we look at<br/>
another part, ask another question, we may be thinking like a physicist,<br/>
or a chemist, or a psychologist, or a philosopher. But these different<br/>
ways of looking at reality should not make us forget that it is all one<br/>
piece, and that from any one place in it we can get to all the other<br/>
places.&quot;<br/>

A Mind At A Time<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s taken for granted in adult society that we cannot all be generalists<br/>
skilled in every area of learning and mastery. Nevertheless, we apply<br/>
tremendous pressure on our children to be good at everything. Every day<br/>
they are expected to shine in math, reading, writing, speaking, spelling,<br/>
memorization, comprehension, problem solving, socialization, athletics,<br/>
and following verbal directions. Few if any children can master all of<br/>
these &quot;trades.&quot; And none of us adults can. In one way or another, all<br/>
minds have their specialties and their frailties. <br/>

Parental Failure<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to follow my children&#39;s lead. I&#39;ve learned by failing. When I fail<br/>
to follow their lead things go wrong. Homeschooling doesn&#39;t work in my<br/>
family if my children don&#39;t feel trusted. When I fail to trust and I inch<br/>
back toward the other end of the continuum; the more traditional side,<br/>
what *I* was taught learning was and how *I* was taught to teach, then<br/>
I fail with my own children. That failure propels me towards the more<br/>
unstructured-trusting-joyful side of the learning continuum. Another<br/>
person might think failing should lead to me trying harder to press my<br/>
own will on my children, but we don&#39;t have that kind of relationship; I&#39;ve<br/>
been learning how to follow their lead every since they were babies and it<br/>
seems more natural to continue to develop that trust as they get older.<br/>
I&#39;m learning something I never learned in school: that failure is a valuable<br/>
teacher and not a shame or a disgrace.<br/>

Social Mythology<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The need for schooling is bolstered by two well-entrenched pieces of<br/>
cultural mythology. The first and most pernicious of these is that<br/>
children will not learn unless they&#39;re compelled to--in school. It is part of<br/>
the mythology of childhood itself that children hate learning and will avoid<br/>
it at all costs. Of course, anyone who has had a child knows what an<br/>
absurd lie this is. From infancy onward, children are the most fantastic<br/>
learners in the world. If they grow up in a family in which four languages<br/>
are spoken, they will be speaking four languages by the time they&#39;re<br/>
three or four years old--without a day of schooling, just by hanging<br/>
around the members of their family, because they desperately want to<br/>
be able to do the things they do. Anyone who has had a child knows that<br/>
they are tirelessly curious. As soon as they&#39;re able to ask questions,<br/>
they ask questions incessantly, often driving their parents to<br/>
distraction. Their curiosity extends to everything they can reach, which<br/>
is why every parent soon learns to put anything breakable, anything<br/>
dangerous, anything untouchable up high--and if possible behind lock and<br/>
key. We all know the truth of the joke about those childproof bottle caps:<br/>
those are the kind that only children can open. <br/>

Book Lovers<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I am the product of long corridors, empty sunlit rooms, upstair indoor<br/>
silences, attics explored in solitude, distant noises of gurgling cisterns<br/>
and pipes, and the noise of wind under the tiles. Also, of endless books.<br/>
There were books in the study, books in the drawing-room, books in the<br/>
cloakroom, books (two deep) in the great bookcase on the landing, books<br/>
in a bedroom, books piled as high as my shoulder in the cistern attic,<br/>
books of all kinds reflecting every transient stage of my parents&#39;<br/>
interests, books readable and unreadable, books suitable for a child and<br/>
books most emphatically not. Nothing was forbidden me. In the seemingly<br/>
endless rainy afternoons I took volume after volume from the shelves.&quot;<br/>

Learning Relationships<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We begin our life as an embryo attached to the wall of our mother&#39;s<br/>
womb. It&#39;s our first relationship. Not much in the way of interaction but,<br/>
quite literally, a vital connection. We are dependent on an umbilical cord<br/>
for nutrients and oxygen, on a sack of fluid for warmth and safety. This<br/>
is our first interpersonal experience. Parents provide, and we survive.<br/>
<br/>
Siblings, peers, teachers, and others may exert greater influence on our<br/>
tastes, attitudes, and behavior in the long run than our parents do.<br/>
People our own age, especially during adolescence, tend to have more to<br/>
say about the way we act, how we dress, how we groom. But what we<br/>
think relationships are, what we expect out of them, and what we know<br/>
about participating in them is largely based on how our parents treated<br/>
us when we were young. If it was with respect and affection, we figure<br/>
that&#39;s the way people will deal with us and how we will deal with them. If,<br/>
however, we are treated without regard, with cruelty, or with<br/>
indifference, then that&#39;s the interpersonal language we know.<br/>
<br/>
Parents bestow upon us the cornerstone for all subsequent relationships<br/>
- our capacity and orientation for love, trust, and fellowship.<br/>
<br/>
...The relationship we have with our parents is more than just where we<br/>
begin our relational development. It remains an important reference<br/>
point for the remainder of our relational lives. &quot;How it was with my<br/>
parents at home when I was a kid&quot; can be a warm and nostalgic memory,<br/>
a precious model to replicate and perpetuate. Or it can be a terrible one,<br/>
frightening, to be avoided at all costs. Or it can be something in between.<br/>
But it is always where we start. And it will always be the foundation on<br/>
which we build our interpersonal world.<br/>

Celebrating Freedom<br/>
<br/>
Recently I stumbled across a wonderful unschooling family on the web:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My name is Nanda, I am married to Hans and together we have four<br/>
boys: Rutger (10), Stijn (7), Jochem (5) and Koen (2). We are a Dutch<br/>
family but four years ago we left the Netherlands and moved to the USA<br/>
to be able to un-school our children. (If you want to know more about why<br/>
we made that decision read; &#39;An Unschooling Adventure&#39; also on this<br/>
site.) Every two weeks from now on I will write about our un-schooling<br/>
life; what we do and don&#39;t do and why it works for us. I have to warn you<br/>
up front though, because you may want to start un-schooling too!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nanda&#39;s site is small but packed tight with her delightful musings on<br/>
unschooling. For instance, this excerpt from an article entitled &quot;So what<br/>
do you do all day?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Un-schooling is a very natural thing for children to do but it didn&#39;t<br/>
always come that natural to me. I often had a tendency to teach my<br/>
children at first. Because I went to school myself, part of me still<br/>
thought that you could only learn if you sit behind a desk and listen to a<br/>
teacher. Then when we get the teachers approval, in the form of a good<br/>
grade, we have learned something, right? But if that&#39;s true, how can it be<br/>
that I don&#39;t remember anything of all the things I&#39;ve learned this way?<br/>
And how can you explain that all the situations that have really taught<br/>
me and helped me grow as a person took place outside of school in real<br/>
life?<br/>
<br/>
My father always says that there is a big difference between knowledge<br/>
and wisdom, and I think he&#39;s right about that. Knowledge is taught in<br/>
conventional schools but wisdom is something that you have to find<br/>
through real life experiences. As un-schoolers we live our life and we try<br/>
to learn as much as we can from every situation we encounter.<br/>
Everyday, our children learn about who they are, what they believe in,<br/>
what they can do and what makes them happy; now that&#39;s wisdom. The<br/>
knowledge just comes to them because they are curious about the world<br/>
they live in, because they love to read and because they encounter<br/>
anyone and everything with an open mind and an open heart.<br/>
<br/>
So what do we do all day? I think Rutger explained it very well to one of<br/>
his aunts when she once asked him this question; &quot; We do exactly as we<br/>
please.&quot; he said and I can only agree.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Why Not Do Both?<br/>
<br/>
Like other people, educators often hold theories about how the world<br/>
works, or how one ought to act, that are never named, never checked<br/>
for accuracy, never even consciously recognized. One of the most<br/>
popular of these theories is a very appealing blend of pragmatism and<br/>
relativism that might be called &quot;the more, the merrier.&quot; People<br/>
subscribing to this view tend to dismiss arguments that a given<br/>
educational practice is bad news and ought to be replaced by another.<br/>
&quot;Why not do both?&quot; they ask. &quot;No reason to throw anything out of your<br/>
toolbox. Use everything that works.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
But what if something that works to accomplish one goal ends up<br/>
impeding another?  And what if two very different strategies are<br/>
inversely related, such that they work at cross purposes? As it happens,<br/>
converging evidence from different educational arenas tends to support<br/>
exactly these concerns. Particularly when practices that might be called,<br/>
for lack of better labels, progressive and traditional are used at the<br/>
same time, the latter often has the effect of undermining the former. <br/>
<br/>
Example 1 comes from the world of math instruction. A few years back,<br/>
a researcher named Michelle Perry published a study in the journal<br/>
Cognitive Development that looked at different ways of teaching children<br/>
the concept of equivalence, as expressed in problems such as<br/>
&quot;4 + 6 + 9 =___ + 9.&quot; Fourth and 5th graders, none of whom knew how<br/>
to solve such problems, were divided into two groups. Some were taught<br/>
the underlying principle (&quot;The goal of a problem like this is to find ...&quot;),<br/>
while others were given step-by-step instructions (&quot;Add up all the<br/>
numbers on the left side, and then subtract the number on the right<br/>
side&quot;). <br/>
<br/>
Both approaches were effective at helping students solve problems just<br/>
like the initial one. Consistent with other research, however, the principle-<br/>
based approach was much better at helping them transfer their<br/>
knowledge to a slightly different kind of problem—for example,<br/>
multiplying and dividing numbers to reach equivalence. Direct instruction<br/>
of a technique for getting the right answer produced shallow learning. <br/>
<br/>
 But why not do both? What if students were taught the procedure and<br/>
the principle? Here&#39;s where it gets interesting. Regardless of the order in<br/>
which these two kinds of instruction were presented, students who were<br/>
taught both ways didn&#39;t do any better on the transfer problems than did<br/>
those who were taught only the procedure—which means they did far<br/>
worse than students who were taught only the principle. Teaching for<br/>
understanding didn&#39;t offset the destructive effects of telling them how<br/>
to get the answer. Any step-by-step instruction in how to solve such<br/>
problems put learners at a disadvantage; the absence of such<br/>
instruction was required for them to understand. <br/>

The Last Word<br/>
<br/>
The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has it&#39;s own<br/>
reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates<br/>
the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality.<br/>
It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery<br/>
everyday. Never lose a holy curiosity.<br/>
