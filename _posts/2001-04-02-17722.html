<h4>George Prudden & Barda Allen</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470410">Hi, This is so great,I was checking out the Clonlara website and through<br/>
that I came across everything else.    Well, now for the intro...<br/>
We are Barda A. Allen & George A. Prudden, married with 5 kids, Amy-19,<br/>
Hubbard-15, Nathaniel-13, David-9 and BJ-6, last names Allen/Prudden. Our<br/>
family lives in Helena, MT, in a house that is over 100 yrs old. We have<br/>
homeschooled since our oldest was school age. When #1d was a preschooler she<br/>
had a brief encounter with a Montessori school- that is an eye-opening story<br/>
in itself, we are unschoolers, all 7 of us!<br/>
Geo. is a craftsman in many trades. In &#39;99 we spent a year in CA where he<br/>
rebuilt my sisters houseboat. He self-taught himself carpentry, electrical<br/>
plumbing, ceramic and stone tiling, actually all the construction trades.<br/>
Our motto was &quot;If you don&#39;t want it done right, don&#39;t call&quot;.That ad in the<br/>
paper brought us lots of repeat customers for years. He also repairs musical<br/>
instruments, as he worked for 13 yrs in a music store in Chicago. We have<br/>
travelled alot over the years and stayed with friends in the midwest and<br/>
they always had a job for Geo. to do.  We haven&#39;t travelled at all for more<br/>
than a year and now he is involved in two bands. The most recent one is<br/>
called &quot;The B Sharps&quot; music that moves and inspires with lounge nouveau<br/>
style. He has a vision of making music his road to financial freedom and<br/>
everytime he gets paid from a job he gives 10% to the church.    #1d is<br/>
working on her GED this year, she has always resisted any &quot;school&quot; stuff,<br/>
but now wants to know it all. She has been working in the cooking field for<br/>
over 2 yrs now. Her 1st job was in a deli. Last June she got hired at On<br/>
Brdway as a line cook. She also works at a place called The Staggering Ox as<br/>
CS. She says she is going to culinary school.  #1s is being mentored by Phil<br/>
M. who wanted to pass on what he knows about business. Last fall I asked #1s<br/>
what he wanted to learn during the school year, his said computers. I<br/>
thought our neighbors could be a wealth of information as one uses Mac and<br/>
the other windows. However , along came Phil and #1s is on his way to really<br/>
mastering more than I could imagine. He is learning how to buy items at<br/>
garage/estate sales and sell them on e-bay. Phil also is teaching him the<br/>
construction trade and how to shovel large piles of snow! When #1s is at<br/>
home he can be found online playing games and talking to friends, through<br/>
this his spelling and typing skills are sharpened, as are his computer<br/>
skills. He can think for himself and is not swayed by the crowd.    #2s<br/>
works very part-time at the best coffee place in the USA. This is what he<br/>
wanted to do this year. He takes orders, washes cups, gophers to the bank,<br/>
the real food store, down the street for buckets of ice, makes italian<br/>
sodas, entertains small children so the parents get a break and plays chess<br/>
with customers. Oh, yes, he also handles money! He has a desk in the owners<br/>
office with a computer and does school work there too. Finally he is<br/>
starting to take a real interest in reading.   #3s loves to ride his bike<br/>
and his razor. He is musically inclined and takes piano lessons from piano<br/>
artists when we come across them. He learned to read a couple years ago.<br/>
#2d is a tomboy, though she does have dolls which she will play with. She is<br/>
interested in reading and math. She is very observing  and asks lots of ?&#39;s<br/>
Me, my babies are growing and now I concentrate on producing streams of<br/>
income. I produce weavings, work 3x&#39;s/wk at the Brdwter Athelic Club so we<br/>
have a free membership. I&#39;m also in NWM. Check out my website at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.retirequickly.com/41749">http://www.retirequickly.com/41749</a>  An exciting and refreshingly different<br/>
NWM company, let&#39;s retire debt together!   Last, but not least, I am a<br/>
Nikken Wellness Consultant, helping people to create balance in their lives,<br/>
providing them with products for a healthier lifestyle and offering magnetic<br/>
massage.  <br/>
Stand in nothingness and you can create anything.<br/>
