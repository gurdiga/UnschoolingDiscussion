<div id="ygrps-yiv-991784982">I read that someone is interested in the moon? (sorry I deleted too<br/>
quickly :-) <br/>
<br/>
My dd is only 17 m/o, but I&#39;ve been unschooling myself lately (lol!) and<br/>
I&#39;ve been looking at a lot of cool websites on astronomy so I thought<br/>
I&#39;d share a few.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/lib/aptree.html">http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/lib/aptree.html</a> This is the Astronomy<br/>
Picture of the Day. This is their caption - &quot;Discover the cosmos! Each<br/>
day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is<br/>
featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional<br/>
astronomer.&quot; I go here everyday and look at a fascinating pic and read<br/>
the explanation. Plus, the explanations are usually full of links, so I<br/>
spend awhile clicking and learning. Tho I have to admit, some days and<br/>
some links are a bit over my head. Not all! But some.<br/>
<br/>
This is absolutely great. Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.seds.org/">http://www.seds.org/</a> which is Students<br/>
for the Exploration and Development of Space. I haven&#39;t even checked it<br/>
all out yet. I spend all my time at their The Nine Planets Solar System<br/>
Tour <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/nineplanets.html.">http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/nineplanets.html.</a> I<br/>
spent the first day following all the moon links. And another day<br/>
following all the sun links. Those are my two favorites that I keep<br/>
going back to. I haven&#39;t completed the tour yet, I&#39;m taking my time :-)<br/>
<br/>
And finally Thursday&#39;s Classroom <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://thursdaysclassroom.com/.">http://thursdaysclassroom.com/.</a> This is<br/>
a NASA website for teachers and students with ideas for study and<br/>
classroom (but fine for us too). I ended up following their links to<br/>
read about the South Pole and diary entries of some college students who<br/>
went there (they are trying to figure out if it will be a good location<br/>
for astronomy). It changes on a regular basis, tho, so the topic will<br/>
not always be the same. <br/>

<br/>
How&#39;s that for a miscelaneous factoid I never learned in &quot;School?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-977193479">Someone mentioned recently seeing wonderful things in the sky because a <br/>
neighbor came over and told them about it. Which reminded me... for those of <br/>
us not lucky enough to have a knowledgeable neighbor, we can have email pop <br/>
in to let us know when cool things are going on in the heavens!<br/>

it might create some Northern Lights, defintely in the high latitutdes but<br/>
maybe even in the middle latitutdes. That would be tomorrow night and the<br/>
next night (17th and 18th)<br/>
