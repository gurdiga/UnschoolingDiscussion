<div id="ygrps-yiv-592477294">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; My daughter had a lot of those, especially at 5<br/>
and 6. Seven and eight<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have been much better, although lately life has been<br/>
 </span></blockquote>stressful and she&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; been  more &quot;melty&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am glad to hear yet again that 7 and 8 turn a<br/>
corner. 5 is very emotional I think. Also melty like<br/>
you say. I can tell when it is happening,dh has a<br/>
tougher time identifying this and feels she is doing <br/>
it on purpose. I am trying to show him the light. :o)<br/>
5 reminds me of 3.<br/>

My dd turned 7 in July. Over the last few months she<br/>
has turned a big corner! She has became more verbal<br/>
and logical and less &#39;in her&#39; emotions. It&#39;s happened<br/>
so quickly that I&#39;m amazed. <br/>
