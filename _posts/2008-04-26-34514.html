<div id="ygrps-yiv-338069975">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
This is my first post, but I&#39;ve been reading for awhile.  I&#39;ve always<br/>
had Sandra&#39;s website on my favourites (and been reading it for a<br/>
couple of years) and read all John Holt&#39;s books.  My oldest went to<br/>
Kindergarten (long story) and now is at home for grade one......and I<br/>
tried &quot;structured unschooling&quot; using project based stuff, but find<br/>
even that turns him off so I&#39;ve backed off and now just try and read<br/>
read read to him and we do &quot;experiments&quot; (science type activities I<br/>
glean from books and internet around things I hear my boys (6,4 and 2)<br/>
interested in........ )<br/>
<br/>
EEEeeeeeaaaaanyways, I&#39;m sure I read this original post here and I had<br/>
to laugh the other morning when August (6 year old) ran into the<br/>
kitchen naked (and our house is COLD in the morning) and said &quot;guess<br/>
what?! My pee pee weighs half a pound!!!!  do you know how I know????<br/>
I weighed myself before I peed and then after!!!!!&quot;  and then until he<br/>
noticed it was cold he talked about how much his jammies weighed<br/>
too.......and finally went and got some clothes on........<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-43115183">August is smarter than so many doctors who told moms they should<br/>
bottle feed so they&#39;d know how much the baby drank.  You can weigh the<br/>
baby before and after breastfeeding.  Doctors and nurses couldn&#39;t<br/>
figure that out and a six year old boy did?  Well there y&#39;go. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I just looked at your website and my mouth is watering at the strawberry<br/>
pictures!  Then I saw that your farm is on Vancouver Island and I wondered<br/>
if you already knew about the upcoming LIFE is Good unschooling conference<br/>
that is south of you in Vancouver, Washington?<br/>

Though it conflicts with strawberry season..?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879475955">WOW it sounds awesome, and inspiring.....but it is right when we are<br/>
going mad here (our strawberry farm) with our &quot;to do&quot; list!!!  I then<br/>
thought, we could plan for next year, but of course it&#39;s on the other<br/>
side of the continent.......the NEXT year perhaps!!??<br/>
