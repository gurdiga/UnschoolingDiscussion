<p><br>I really enjoyed reading your post on this. Are you planning on
ever writing a book on unschooling, with more of your personal story included?&nbsp;
<i>The Unschooling Handbook</i> is good, but a book written of an actual
family&#39;s experience would be wonderful.&nbsp; Plus, a book with your directness
and vision hasn&#39;t been written yet. Are you considering writing one, by
chance... please??

Yes.  Pretty much it&#39;s written.  I had a computer die on me, and the files <br/>
have been copied from an old-old computer, and sent to a friend in Las Cruces <br/>
who has put them on a CD to send them back to me so I can get them into my <br/>
new iMac (which doesn&#39;t take floppy disks).  (Sounds SO much like &quot;the dog <br/>
age it&quot; doesn&#39;t it?)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the encouragement and kind words.  <br/>
<br/>
I used to have a title idea, but I forgot what it was.  I guess it wasn&#39;t too <br/>
brilliant, if it slipped my mind.<br/>
