Barnes and Noble, they don&#39;t go for the books. They love the little store in the <br/>
library that sells books way cheap and they have all kinds of pencils, pens, <br/>
stickers and well...stuff. That&#39;s where they head first. Then they hit the DVD&#39;s <br/>
and VHS section, lastly they hit the CD section. Every once in  awhile, <br/>
they&#39;ll ask me to grab them some cartooning books while they look for movies. Once <br/>
I asked on a day that I did not want to be at the library for long, &quot;Why don&#39;t <br/>
you go find your cartooning books and I&#39;ll look at some movies?&quot; In twin <br/>
speak, they responded, &quot; Why mom?... It would waste so much time for us to look up <br/>
the decimals for the cartooning books... and you almost know the whole place <br/>
by heart...so if you just go get them,... it will be so much faster,... then <br/>
you will have time to look for movies too.&quot; They weren&#39;t being obnoxious, they <br/>
really thought in the essence of saving time we should do it their way. I <br/>
agreed that my knowing where those particular books are would be faster and maybe <br/>
they should go with me to see where they are and then they will know too. So <br/>
we did and now they too know where to go to find those books in particular.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-543385176">Thanks, I just checked out Ruth Chew on Amazon.  Can&#39;t believe I ever missed those books.  We will look for them at the library when the HP craze subsides.<br/>

I absolutely loved books by Ruth Chew when I was younger.  They&#39;re out <br/>
of print as far as I know, but you might find some at the library to <br/>
check out.  :)  Or go to Amazon to read reviews and see if there are any <br/>
used copies to buy.<br/>
