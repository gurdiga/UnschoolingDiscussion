On paper, there are now several versions of illustrated-comics type  <br/>
things.  And there are paraphrases, story-style, for kids (the classic  <br/>
is the Lambs...)<br/>
<br/>
OH!  They&#39;re online:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
But I wouldn&#39;t do that, unless he wants it for bedtime stories or  <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
I would start with The Complete Works of William Shakespeare  <br/>
(Abridged) by The Reduced Shakespeare Company.<br/>
It&#39;s listed 3/4 the way down this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/shakespeare">http://sandradodd.com/shakespeare</a><br/>
The link isn&#39;t as good as it once was, but it will get to their site,  <br/>
from which I found this link just now:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The meme is older than anyone guessed! Here it is, something I just  <br/>
dug up at the library: the First Folio edition of...<br/>
Wm. Shakespeare&#39;s Five and Twenty Random Things Abovt Me<br/>

<br/>
What has worked best here is that I&#39;m just watching Shakespeare while  <br/>
I sew or make something, and a kid will come by and watch, or not.   <br/>
But it helps that if they ask questions I can answer them (or look it  <br/>
up).  I wouldn&#39;t try to watch with the kid, in a stress &quot;we are  <br/>
watching Shakespeare; shhhh!&quot; kind of way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139029607">We haven&#39;t tried this game yet, but I have it bookmarked as something <br/>
to &quot;strew&quot; if they start asking more about Shakespeare, maybe your son <br/>
could try it and write a review.  <br/>
<br/>
It is an arcade style game designed around Shakespeare&#39;s works.  The <br/>
website is way heavy on the &quot;hidden educational agenda&quot; which is a <br/>
little bit of a turn off for an unschooler because it feels like they <br/>
want people to be sneaky about the purpose of the game.  However, if <br/>
your son WANTS to know more about Shakespeare, he might dig a game that <br/>
is designed to be fun AND teach Shakespeare.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-206629021">Oh - there are Shakespeare in a Box sets that are wonderful. The first <br/>
one I bought was directly from the guy who made them up and it cost $40, <br/>
but now there are a couple of them sold on Amazon for less than $10, I <br/>
think. We did one of them at Thanksgiving once, with our extended <br/>
family. They&#39;re really well done - and organized so that you can have <br/>
any size cast. If you have fewer cast members, each will take multiple <br/>
parts and he&#39;s got it all worked out so people won&#39;t end up talking to <br/>
themselves. They give you some props and tell you to grab things you&#39;ll <br/>
have around the house for others.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an amazon description for the Taming of the Shrew set:<br/>
<br/>
SHAKESPEARE is like a host-your-own-murder game, but with an <br/>
intellectual and artistic bent. Beginning with one of Shakespeare&#39;s <br/>
best-known, best-loved works, the comedy The Taming of the Shrew, each <br/>
kit has everything needed to produce and act out a thoroughly <br/>
entertaining 45-minute version of the play: cards for a director and <br/>
technical director, showing how to cast the play, direct it, stage it, <br/>
and create easy sets and sound effects; cards for each of the major <br/>
parts, with a summary of the character and suggestions on how to play <br/>
him or her; ten cleverly abridged copies of the script; and key props. <br/>
For TAMING OF THE SHREW, each kit contains a working plastic recorder (a <br/>
&quot;flute&quot; instead of a lute) and plastic Groucho eyeglasses. Each kit also <br/>
contains a booklet introducing the wonderful world of Shakespeare, <br/>
acting tips and exercises, recipes for grog, and other good party games <br/>
to play.<br/>

Bruce Coville and some by Marianna Mayer.<br/>
<br/>
My husband had bad experiences with Shakespeare so wasn&#39;t going to go  <br/>
with me on our season tickets so I took Kathryn when she was 4 or so.  <br/>
It was Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream. We read Bruce&#39;s version before we  <br/>
went. And she said she understood what was going on. She had the  <br/>
option to leave at any time and opted to stay for the whole thing.  <br/>
Part may have been the whole play experience. And part was that she  <br/>
was used to picking up what was going on from visual cues and tones  <br/>
and not expecting to understand every word even in day to day speech.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Jayn first learnt the story of Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream from the Disney <br/>
Mickey Mouse version (Goofy as Puck). She also was interested because of the <br/>
Titania Barbie doll. Puck is one of the main characters in the Sisters Grimm <br/>
stories (Fairy Tale detectives). I&#39;ve designed costumes for MS N D before <br/>
and showed Jayn my portfolio. I&#39;ve written before about Jayn and her Juliet <br/>
Barbie.<br/>

There are a lot of ways into Shakespeare.<br/>
