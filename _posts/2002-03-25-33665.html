<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795800751">I was thinking the other day about the age old question we are all <br/>
GUARANTEED to hear at least once (more likely 100&#39;s of times) while we are <br/>
unschooling. &quot;But how do you know they are learning?&quot; My usual answer is &quot;I <br/>
talk to them.&quot; The truth of this statement was brought home to me this week <br/>
when I took Casey to a new Children&#39;s Museum.<br/>
<br/>
At each exhibit and doing each craft, I knew exactly where Casey was with <br/>
it. When she drew a series of pictures to use in a zoetrope, and actually <br/>
drew a flower growing, I knew at that instant that she now grasped a concept <br/>
she had never quite understood before. How did I know? I talk to her. I <br/>
watch her. I listen. I observe. I *know* her. She was so delighted to see <br/>
the flower she drew appear to grow. It&#39;s a moment I would not have wanted to <br/>
miss.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same with watching her reading develop. How could I not see her <br/>
progress, and the joy in her eyes, as she realizes she can read a real book <br/>
that she&#39;s really interested in? How could I miss the fact that she used to <br/>
print her name in block letters and can now sign it in beautiful cursive. <br/>
How could I not notice the interesting questions she asks and how they tie <br/>
in and build on the interesting ones she was pondering last year?<br/>
<br/>
How do all those other people NOT see that their kids are learning?<br/>
<br/>
I DO know that silly &quot;How do you know...&quot; question has no power over me <br/>
whatsoever. I&#39;ve thrown it in the heap along with &quot;But how do you teach <br/>
without a curriculum?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just one of many of my happy thoughts for today. :o)<br/>

 How did she start cursive writing? That one is a real<br/>

As to cursive and printing, who cares.  Some of the kidlets do one, some the<br/>
other.  Some learned because I use to do calligraphy and they loved the pens<br/>
and so I bought them calligraphy sets which have instruction books.  I even<br/>
managed to find a set for leftys (of which I have 2.5 &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
We have all kinds of tablets and stuff laying around the house and they just<br/>
picked up what they wanted when they wanted.  If they didn&#39;t, it wasn&#39;t any<br/>
big deal.<br/>

doesn&#39;t have enough of a reason to write yet.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Writing hurt my hand a lot until I was about eleven.  I had a callous on my <br/>
finger that was never going away, and my hand used to cramp.  Fat (&quot;first <br/>
grade&quot;) pencils were much more comfortable than the skinny normal #2&#39;s and if <br/>
I could find a fat ballpoint pen I used that instead of the skinny ones <br/>
(although I always hated ballpoints and still don&#39;t use them except in <br/>
foreign situations of necessity).  Felt tips (then Flairs, now Sanford <br/>
calligraphy pens) are more comfortable for me.<br/>
<br/>
I liked getting the words out, but the physical act was never comfortable <br/>
until I was pubescent.  I don&#39;t know whether it was physical size, maturity, <br/>
resignation to the inevitable, or what.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and Marty get their words out at the computer, without pain.<br/>
<br/>
Because I&#39;ve never made my kids write, they&#39;ve never experienced pain over it <br/>
or associated discomfort with it.   Their ability to put words together in <br/>
artsy, funny, touching and practical ways is unhampered.<br/>

things in life that motivate a person to want to write, but for a <br/>
7yo, I can&#39;t think of too many.<br/>
My dd11 can write.  She probably does it daily now with lists and <br/>
poems and games she makes up, her diary and letters to friends.(not <br/>
all in the same day!)<br/>
My son 8 is a big list writer now.  He is learning to spell with the <br/>
games he plays on the computer.  Not spelling games.  All kinds of <br/>
different games.  He yells out &quot;HOW DO YOU SPELL.....&quot; often, <br/>
throughout the day.<br/>
They learn in bits and pieces, all day everyday.  I answer questions, <br/>
show them things, make suggestions, play games,have conversations.... <br/>
and it happens.<br/>
All the time, learning happens.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628599964">Regarding praise, I meant describing specific things that she is doing<br/>
well, in response to her complaint that she&#39;s not doing it very well.  I<br/>
also meant, describing other things she has mastered, and encouraging her<br/>
if she can do that she can do this, with time.  I&#39;m assuming the child is<br/>
writing because she wants and is expressing frustration that it&#39;s not the<br/>
way she would like it to be.  Perfectionism is something my son has a<br/>
problem with, and I have found praise (acknowledgement) sets him at ease<br/>
and encourages him to stop obsessing.  <br/>
Praise that says, &quot;Hey, look what you did,&quot; may be misconstrued as<br/>
patronising or pressure, but can also help a child feel appreciated. <br/>
This is important if they&#39;ve already been conditioned to feel inadequate<br/>
by parents or teachers with a history of criticizing and only noticing<br/>
what they do wrong.  Recognition is what I&#39;m talking about, not showing<br/>
the parent how great they are for having a child who can do this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-320857016">I think in some way we all like there to be some acknowledgement when we have done something well. Some of us - take it to heart a little too much :) We could speculate whether that&#39;s just related to personality or lack of/too much praise growing up... For example - I am a 28 year old woman who still will tell my dad what grades I get in the college courses I take -  how sad is that - <br/>
<br/>
In any case, with children I think it is sometimes easy to see the things they are doing wrong as opposed to the great things they are doing. I also think kids see through patronization vs. real praise. I agree that a simple acknowledgement of - hey, you did a great job with that - is nice to hear - as long as it is the truth! It sometimes gives you that little bit of incentive to press on with whatever task it is....<br/>

  Regarding praise, I meant describing specific things that she is doing<br/>
  well, in response to her complaint that she&#39;s not doing it very well.  I<br/>
  also meant, describing other things she has mastered, and encouraging her<br/>
  if she can do that she can do this, with time.  I&#39;m assuming the child is<br/>
  writing because she wants and is expressing frustration that it&#39;s not the<br/>
  way she would like it to be.  Perfectionism is something my son has a<br/>
  problem with, and I have found praise (acknowledgement) sets him at ease<br/>
  and encourages him to stop obsessing.  <br/>
  Praise that says, &quot;Hey, look what you did,&quot; may be misconstrued as<br/>
  patronising or pressure, but can also help a child feel appreciated. <br/>
  This is important if they&#39;ve already been conditioned to feel inadequate<br/>
  by parents or teachers with a history of criticizing and only noticing<br/>
  what they do wrong.  Recognition is what I&#39;m talking about, not showing<br/>
  the parent how great they are for having a child who can do this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845999052">Praise is a tricky thing around here sometimes.  Rachel takes it in <br/>
very strange ways occassionally.  Sometimes, saying she did something <br/>
well, or that she looks good in a specific outfit, translates to <br/>
&quot;you&#39;re terrible the rest of the time&quot; in her mind.  And other times, <br/>
it doesn&#39;t have that effect.  Partly, it&#39;s hormones.  But sometimes <br/>
it&#39;s just a crap shoot which reaction we get.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to really pay attention to how what you say <br/>
affects your kids.  This is another case where they are all different <br/>
and we each have to learn how they react to what comments.<br/>

am.  I got several words into my old-style comment about watching TV all <br/>
the time and then stopped myself.  I hadn&#39;t noticed his reaction at that <br/>
point, but when I changed it to, &quot;There must be a lot of shows that you <br/>
really like that are on this late,&quot; his face lit up.  Mum <br/>
understands!  Well at any rate she&#39;s learning.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
