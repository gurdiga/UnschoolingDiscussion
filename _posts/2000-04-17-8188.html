I, too, spent a lot of time being with him at events.<br/>
<br/>
I remember the first time he went off by himself for over an hour.  It was<br/>
with a relatively new unschooling group we had finally found.  We&#39;d met<br/>
with them several times and there were kids his age-6.  They were playing<br/>
by the creek in the large backyard of someone&#39;s house.  I hadn&#39;t seen him<br/>
for over an hour and I was a bit concerned and surprised and delighted.  I<br/>
checked on him, but things were o.k.  <br/>
