<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584690008">I have opened a message board to try and join all australian(and <br/>
Overseas) homeschoolers, Theres different groups everywhere id <br/>
thought it would be nice to have one plce to come to , Also I dont <br/>
want to run it on my own id really like input from others so im <br/>
looking for people to moderate different forums. Maybe you have a <br/>
online business you could advertise here?Or maybe you would like to <br/>
promote your own group? So if your interested Here <br/>

online and in real life.<br/>
