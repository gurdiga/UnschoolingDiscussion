 </span></blockquote>&quot;&quot;Well it depends what your goal is in journaling. If your goal is to go back<br/>
and be able to see progress then the way you&#39;re doing it isn&#39;t meeting your<br/>
needs.<br/>
<br/>
But if your goal is to release some emotions onto paper and you do feel<br/>
better when you&#39;re done, then you&#39;re meeting your goal.<br/>

School is about doing things *the* right way. Real life is about whether<br/>
what we&#39;re doing works or not.<br/>
