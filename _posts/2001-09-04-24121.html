<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113281733">&lt;&lt; At first I didn&#39;t understand this poster&#39;s writing style but reading <br/>
the archieves has cleared up that question--once a teacher, always a <br/>
teacher. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been unschooling now longer than I was a teacher.  Am I always an <br/>
unschooler now too?<br/>
<br/>
Teachers and nuns.  People say &#39;once a nun, always a nun&#39; and &#39;once a <br/>
teacher, always a teacher.&#39;   It&#39;s too bad, and it&#39;s mean and tacky.<br/>
<br/>
If by &quot;always a teacher&quot; I really care about what&#39;s true and fair, I cared <br/>
about those things before I was a teacher.  <br/>
<br/>
This list is supposed to be for unschoolers to discuss unschooling and their <br/>
lives and unschoolers, I&#39;m pretty sure.   It&#39;s an offshoot and subsidiary of <br/>
unschoooling.com, but I often think some of the list members are unaware that <br/>
the main forum even exists.<br/>
<br/>
Today someone will join this list who doesn&#39;t know anything about <br/>
unschooling, or who&#39;s really wanting help NOW, and I think asking people to <br/>
stay on topic and to be fair in their arguments is a good thing.  <br/>
<br/>
I care more about unschooling and unschoolers than about guns or dogs or any <br/>
other side issue.  I also care that the unschooling forum and its list are <br/>
available for the steady stream of new unschoolers who come for stories and <br/>
ideas and help.<br/>
<br/>
Please, anyone reading, don&#39;t depend on this list for all your unschooling <br/>
information or social needs.  There are many discussions online where you can <br/>
stay more to topic and in smaller groups if that&#39;s your preference.<br/>

topics.  And I was glad to see them discussed.  To me, and I think I&#39;ve heard <br/>
it said before, unschooling encompasses just about everything.  There is a <br/>
general worldview that seems to be shared by many unschoolers that I love.  <br/>
That of questioning, allowing and not limiting.  There are varieties in <br/>
different areas, bit I don&#39;t want to feel like getting &#39;off topic&#39; is a bad <br/>
thing.  Again, I&#39;m a competent adult, and if I see something I don&#39;t want to <br/>
read, I delete it.  I just subscribed to another homeschooling list and it <br/>
seems much more dogmatic and not what I&#39;m interested in, but I&#39;m giving it <br/>
some time....I might get something out of it.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if the heat is just really getting to everyone.  It was nice <br/>
and fall like here for a week or so, then the humidity came back. I&#39;m ready <br/>
for the cold weather.:-)<br/>

the internet either.  I really don&#39;t think you have to<br/>
worry about someone not being able to find other<br/>
resources, if they were able to subscribe and post<br/>
here - they&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;ve been to *homeschooling*<br/>
message board that make these discussions look like a<br/>
Sunday School lesson on &#39;be kind to your neighbor&#39;. (I<br/>
was afraid to post!) Also, most of the topics are<br/>
interesting to me, they don&#39;t need to center solely on<br/>
unschooling- everything is part of our lives, and I<br/>
just skim over & delete the ones that aren&#39;t currently<br/>
of interest to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859224602">I agree Brenda...<br/>
I use the delete key for anything that just doesn&#39;t seem relevant to me.<br/>
BUT....it is usually relevant to others, and that&#39;s what life and unschooling is<br/>
all about.<br/>
Thanks for saying so nicely.<br/>
There are lots of times I don&#39;t agree with the opinions expressed, but still<br/>
everyone has an opinion, and everyone can express it...I&#39;m not going to attack<br/>
someone or get upset about someone having a different opinion than mine.  It is<br/>
the way of the world, and thank goodness I have my trusty delete key.<br/>

What I was thinking of by off topic involved direct personal insult, tacky <br/>
accusations about the motives and mental states of participants, and <br/>
discussions about the history of this list itself.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that it&#39;s not educational.  Once people get into the flow of <br/>
learning from everything around them, there&#39;s not a list online anywhere they <br/>
couldn&#39;t consider educational, but that doesn&#39;t mean the soap opera lists <br/>
should head back toward their storylines and the Dodge repair lists shouldn&#39;t <br/>
eventually get back off of Harley-engines, etc.<br/>

&gt;I just got this post in my mail and as I usualy ONLY post on the unschooling.con forum, I had to jump in and tell Sandra &quot;way to go&quot;  I love your devotion to unschooling and (even when I am under fire ;)the way you tell it like it is.  I personally don&#39;t like this list, the forum is so much more fluid.  <br/>

  On the bath, I finally realized I was making her take it because *I* was hot and sticky and irritable. I should have taken the bath. <br/>
