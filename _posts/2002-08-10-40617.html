&gt; advocate eliminating public schooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Betsy. Let me correct one thing, though.<br/>
 The Separation of School and State Alliance (www.sepschool.org) does not<br/>
advocate eliminating public schooling.<br/>
<br/>
It advocates the elimination of FORCED FUNDING of schools by government. In<br/>
other words, public schools, like all others, should continue to exist so<br/>
long as there are people who are willing to pay for them voluntarily. That<br/>
would mean, of course, that those schools are providing a service that lots<br/>
of people actually want.<br/>
<br/>
Today, there is in the ballpark of $400B annually spent on the public<br/>
schools. If that amount was not forced to be paid by citizens to the one<br/>
public school system, it would remain in the hands of those citizens who<br/>
could spend it for any school they would choose for their kids.<br/>
<br/>
There are dozens of private funding programs today that help families afford<br/>
alternative schools for their kids. Many more such programs would exist if<br/>
the tax funding of schools ended. And with that, many new schools would open<br/>
that would satisfy the varied needs of our diverse population.<br/>
