<div id="ygrps-yiv-808831816">Yes Yes!!  a little background first...<br/>
I taught myself to read at 5.  I began reading to my<br/>
daughter while she was in the womb.<br/>
By the time she was a year old she had 3 libraries,<br/>
English, Italian and Spanish.  It was a huge thorn<br/>
in my side that she couldn&#39;t read.  I got more and more<br/>
frustrated.  Wasted more and more money on stuff like<br/>
Hooked on Phonics ,etc.  Finally realized she did not want<br/>
to read.  That was even harder to accept. But on her 10th<br/>
birthday she decided she did want to read and has been<br/>
going strong ever since.  EXCEPT... Here she is reading all<br/>
sorts of books and comprehending and writing the best darn<br/>
book reports, etc but she has the worst spelling.  I<br/>
couldn&#39;t understand how she could read so well and spell so<br/>
poorly.  But one day recently I realized we work on her<br/>
spelling via phonics and with her accent she simply can&#39;t<br/>
hear half the vowels.  <br/>
She was born in Massachusetts, on the South Shore.  Not<br/>
only does she not hear vowels in some cases she doesn&#39;t<br/>
hear consonants either!  For instance the word -better-.<br/>
She honestly hears -beDDer-.  She drops letters at the ends<br/>
of words adds some on to others - it&#39;s SOooo frustrating -<br/>
for both of us.  To make matters worse by the time she was<br/>
4 she was in a speech therapy class for almost 2 years,<br/>
being taught by a woman with an even worse accent than dd<br/>
already had!  Now the stuff is ingrained.  <br/>
<br/>
What do we do?  Her unbelievably horrid spelling silently<br/>
appalls me but recently I realized that it really<br/>
embarrasses her.  Any suggestions would be much<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
ciao, Jacli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137681687">Do you really think that having the accent is the problem?  The reason I ask<br/>
is that hubby and I were discussing this and he thinks that one would need<br/>
to look at other reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Now, his point being that he is a Brockton, Mass native.  He lived in Mass<br/>
until he was 10 and was a spelling bee winner, etc.  Now, he had a very<br/>
thick &quot;Boston&quot; accent, baaa (bar), caaa (car), butta (butter), etc.  He<br/>
doesn&#39;t think the &quot;beDDer&quot; is Boston at all and rather that with a true<br/>
Boston accent it would be beTTa.   We called his sister to ask her (she has<br/>
a real &quot;problem&quot; &lt;g&gt;  born in Mass and now a NC resident with a southern<br/>
accent covering up her Boston accent) what she thought and she said the same<br/>
thing he did.  They don&#39;t &quot;hear&quot; their accents as being other than the<br/>
&quot;right&quot; way to pronounce the words.  They &quot;hear&quot; the &quot;r&quot; in words like car<br/>
or bar even if we don&#39;t hear them saying them.  Am I clear as mud as usual??<br/>
<br/>
He had lived in CA for 15 years when I met him and you could tell right off<br/>
the top where he was from.  Many years later, folks can still tell and that<br/>
is after living in CA for over 30 years.  And even with this lingering<br/>
accent, he is the best speller in this house.<br/>
