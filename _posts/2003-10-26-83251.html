<div id="ygrps-yiv-974404049">Sandra&#39;s objection to this particular article as propaganda that <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be posted here is not one I share. I personally find all this interesting <br/>
--  not threatening -- to think about and discuss, among those with a true <br/>
unschooling attitude. But there&#39;s no need for Sandra to persuade me that <br/>
religious and political posturing can taint the good will in any environment. That&#39;s <br/>
a truth no one can dispute!<br/>
<br/>
       Thank goodness I am not responsible for moderating more than a <br/>
thousand people here in this wonderful environment so full of good will. I will <br/>
gladly defer to the judgment of those who are -- not about truth or history or <br/>
politics or religion, but about this list. :)  JJ<br/>

That sounds good, but an article written by and for fundamentalist<br/>
Christians isn&#39;t a good article for other kinds of people to promote<br/>
to others. They are basically passing a social virus without<br/>
realizing it.<br/>
<br/>
And if a new homeschooler reads that and passes it on as if it is<br/>
truth, then untruth is being spread unknowingly.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think people should pass it on because it contains information<br/>
which is false. It doesn&#39;t matter to me if down in there is a good<br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
I promise NEVER to serve any of you ANY lemonade in which a turd is<br/>
floating. A little falsehood will mar a load of truth, but that<br/>
article is a load of falsehood &quot;supporting&quot; a little truth.<br/>
<br/>
And that &quot;truth&quot;--that learning can happen without a curriculum, and<br/>
that saying &quot;We don&#39;t go to school&quot; is better than we &quot;school&quot; at<br/>
home--is what this list is already about. So let&#39;s put the untruth<br/>
and propaganda back outside of this list and go on with our normal<br/>
business.<br/>
<br/>
Those who are homeschooling for religious and political purposes know<br/>
full well there are better lists for them to be on, and this list<br/>
doesn&#39;t need religious or political propaganda. It doesn&#39;t make it<br/>
easier for anyone to understand unschool</div>

It wasn&#39;t an objection to it having been brought to the list in the first <br/>
place.  It was after than, when someone said &quot;Oooh, I want to post that on my <br/>

seemed important to stress that it has more fallacy than objectivity.<br/>

Thankyou, yes this was exactly my reaction when I started to read that<br/>
article. It was immediately clear to me that the history was bogus, so I<br/>
stopped. It was not until after Sandra and Nancy posted that I thought I<br/>
had better force my way through the whole thing. I think the second half<br/>
about returning to the family would stand on its own without the<br/>
faux-history of the homeschooling movement introduction, if people are<br/>
determined to pass it on to their spouses etc. <br/>
<br/>
That being said, I would not have known about the white supremacist<br/>
jargon (rather than just some catch phrase invented by the author) if I<br/>
hadn&#39;t been informed of it, simply because it is outside of my<br/>
experience. It is interesting how seemingly innocuous phrases take on a<br/>
different meaning when you realize they have been co-opted by that kind<br/>
of political extremism. I appreciate being warned about it.<br/>
<br/>
When I see articles that have as part of their theme &quot;The Collapse of<br/>
the Family&quot; and &quot;The Loss of the Father&quot; I get wary. These are emotive<br/>
sweeping generalizations. I refuse to believe that the family has<br/>
collapsed. <br/>

            This fun (well I think this stuff is fun) website is about<br/>
the National Survey on Family Growth. It has lots of detailed stats on<br/>
marriages and remarriages. Marriage sure does seem popular. Contrary to<br/>
the notion that half of all new marriages end in divorce, these<br/>
statistics show it will be only 33% (one third) after 10 years. There<br/>
are statistics about remarriage after divorce too. That seems to say<br/>
that the majority of people stay married, or want to be married. <br/>

U.S. couple charged with starving four boys<br/>
Sun 26 October, 2003 18:32 BST<br/>
<br/>
PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - A New Jersey couple face charges of starving their<br/>
four adopted sons, aged 9 to 19.<br/>
<br/>
The boys, who suffered from stunted growth, rotten teeth and distended<br/>
bellies, were surviving by supplementing their meagre diet of uncooked<br/>
pancake batter and oatmeal with chips of paint and pieces of wall<br/>
insulation, authorities said on Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, a state case worker made regular visits to the home in the<br/>
Philadelphia suburb of Collingswood, New Jersey.<br/>
<br/>
Their conditions came to light when neighbours phoned police after seeing<br/>
the 19-year-old rummaging through their trash can. Officers discovered that<br/>
the teen-ager weighed only 45 pounds (20 kg). His adoptive siblings -- aged<br/>
9, 10 and 14 -- weighed as little as 23 pounds (10 kg).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It really strikes at the heart of anyone that has any sense of compassion.<br/>
And, quite frankly, it boggles the mind,&quot; Camden County prosecutor Vincent<br/>
Sarubbi told a weekend news conference.<br/>
<br/>
Parents Raymond Jackson, 50, and his wife Vanessa, 48, claimed the boys<br/>
suffered from eating disorders but a physician found no evidence of<br/>
inherited deficiencies, authorities said. The couple also had two adopted<br/>
girls, aged 5 and 12, and were in the process of adopting a 10-year-old<br/>
girl.<br/>
<br/>
Authorities said the parents&#39; two biological children, a boy and a girl both<br/>
over 18, lived in the same house and appeared healthy.<br/>
<br/>
The three younger boys were removed from the Collingswood home and sent into<br/>
foster care, while the 19-year-old was hospitalised. The girls were also<br/>
taken from the home.<br/>
<br/>
The state case worker who had been visiting the Jacksons resigned, and 10<br/>
managers and supervisors from the state Division of Youth and Family<br/>
Services were suspended with pay.<br/>
<br/>
The division has been under fire over a series of child abuse cases,<br/>
including one that involved a 7-year-old Newark boy whose decomposing body<br/>
was discovered with his two starving brothers in January.<br/>
<br/>
The Jacksons have been charged with four counts of aggravated assault and 14<br/>
counts of endangering the welfare of a minor. Both were being held in the<br/>
Camden County jail on $100,000 bail apiece.</div>

&gt; &gt;   &gt;Philadelphia paper said they were &quot;ostensibly&quot; homeschooling, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt;know what they mean by that. The other local paper called them<br/>

&gt; &gt;   I never quite get why people call for *more* state oversight when a<br/>
&gt; &gt;   large number of cases like this are already having more oversight than<br/>
&gt; &gt;   most people. The Victoria Climbie case in the Uk was the same. <br/>
&gt; Multiple<br/>
&gt; &gt;   social worker visits but still the little girl was beaten and straved<br/>
&gt; &gt;   and tortured to death.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   And she was attending school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-619552186">Yes..I think it was Steinberg? that poor, poor baby.  I can&#39;t imagine hitting Brianna...I think I hit my older kids twice. Once, I was going to strangle my son - he was 7 and he had given my 3 carat engagement ring to his teacher. I got it back the next day.<br/>
I slapped my daughter on the hand when she was younger for stealing my clothes and giving them to her friends. After a few times, I realized it wasn&#39;t working.<br/>
<br/>
When I was real young - like 3 or 4 - Rosemary (next door kid) was a major biter. It never occurred to me to bite her back. It wasn&#39;t apart of my reality.<br/>
Her mom would BITE her everytime Rosemary bit someone. I never squealed - but then she bit me so hard she drew blood on my right arm and my mom saw it and told her mom - her mom drew blood from Rosemary. I thought that was so sick.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight, Brianna & I will smudge and pray for all the kids that were taken from us and all the kids that are suffering.<br/>

  I have a book on her.<br/>
<br/>
  She attended school every day.  In retrospect, her teachers said they <br/>
  knew something was wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153707723">I don&#39;t know of any one single place with &quot;the real history&quot; of <br/>
anything.  Learning history involves all the observation and reading <br/>
and critical thinking that comes along.  Ask older people about the <br/>
schools they went to when they were little.  Read what you come <br/>
across about  the formation of local schools in the 19th century.  Be <br/>
aware of the regional history of different parts of the U.S.  What&#39;s <br/>
true of Texas won&#39;t be true of Hawaii; Alaskan schools were different <br/>
in purpose and practice from schools in Boston.  Knowing three <br/>
different lines will be enough to let you know that the history of <br/>
schools in New York City is not representative of all of the U.S.<br/>
