<div><font face="Arial" size="2">My son was not interested in going to the potty 
untill he had just turned four.&nbsp; He had participated in our bathroom visits 
to begin to learn how at three, then he went througha period, where he just 
didn&#39;t want to, so that was fine....I did start to worry ,and wonder if he would 
&quot;ever&quot; go potty on the potty...but I kept hearing that when they &#39;re 
ready..they&#39;ll go.....and that&#39;s just how it happened......I had spent adequate 
time in the bathroom showing him &quot;how&quot; it was done..he had lots of practice, 
just wasn&#39;t ready to make the switch just yet at three, and at four one day he 
just decided to go, when he was good and ready, adn from that first day he was 
ready he went ever since...never having any accidents at night......this is also 
child lead......it&#39;s the same, offer them the tools they need,...i.e: a potty or 
stool, and when they&#39;re good and ready...they&#39;ll use it.&nbsp;
