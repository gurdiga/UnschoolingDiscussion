<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179806303">With a little kid, it&#39;s worth letting it go.   With older kids, I think of whether I would make the correction (subtly or no) with an adult friend, and go that way sometimes.   When Keith uses a word he doesn&#39;t usually use and I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s what he meant, sometimes I ask and he clarifies.  Maybe he meant another word, maybe I just misunderstood it in context.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;m fishing for a word and one of the kids (now teens) will furnish it for me, and I think that&#39;s wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Words have always been common toys here.  It no worse to correct a word than for Marty to show us a better way to do the contstruction sets or for Keith to bring us a better kind of wrench when we&#39;re working on something with a less than optimal tool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-768983839">I wonder how, if at all, you&#39;ve gone about<br/>
&quot;correcting&quot; your kids along the way.  Last<br/>
night my 7yo dd said &quot;I am really liking Judy Blum, momma.&quot;<br/>
I looked at what she had in her hands and it was Sheila the <br/>
Great by Judy Blume.  So I said, &quot;Oh, Judy Blume&#39;s(instead of Blum)<br/>
book called Shelia the Great...I&#39;m so glad you like it.&quot; <br/>
And that was it, then we talked about the story.  <br/>
She has just recently asked for books like this<br/>
that will last her a few days to read, and I don&#39;t want to <br/>
discourage her in any way.  I&#39;ve done this in the past too, like<br/>
when they would write a backwards E or 4, just said that while<br/>
it was fine to do it, that if they wanted to make sure everyone <br/>
knew what they were writing, that they might do it a different way.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we&#39;ve handled it different though.  Recently my 10yo ds<br/>
got a set of Magnetix and was talking about how they were <br/>
trans-succulent.  Dh thought it was just a cool word that ds made<br/>
up....and then I realized he was meaning translucent.  We had a <br/>
big laugh over that one, and ds knows we were not making fun of him.<br/>
But then with ds we actually talked about the fact that it was<br/>
not the word he was saying.  So I handled the 2 situations different.<br/>
I am just curious how if at all others correct(it&#39;s really not the <br/>
word I choose to use, but can&#39;t think of a different one this early<br/>
in the am.) thanks.  krista</div>

<br/>
I would just say &quot;Translucent?&quot; and let him go on.  But I&#39;d probably write down &quot;succulent&quot; and &quot;translucent&quot; (if the mood seemed okay for it) and do a tiny history-of-English moment.  If they know other words like the words they&#39;re learning to use, more dots are connected, and thinking&#39;s freer and bigger.<br/>
<br/>
Holly, especially, likes the history of words.<br/>
<br/>
About the Judy Blum/Blume, I&#39;d&#39;ve probably done just about as you did, just find a way to repeat the name with the other pronunciation.<br/>

<br/>
The short answer is that generally we try not to correct Jayn ever, if her<br/>
meaning is clear, since she always comes to the correction herself in time.<br/>
<br/>
In the vanishingly rare instances that we genuinely just can&#39;t work out what<br/>
the heck she is referring to (or make a reasonable guess), I will go through<br/>
a (using your example) &quot;do you mean that you can see light through it?&quot; or<br/>
&quot;do you mean translucent?&quot; series of questions, only to the point of<br/>
understanding. One amusing example from a while ago, was when she came<br/>
running in to tell us about a problem with her &quot;asshole&quot;, there turned out<br/>
to be paint all over her &quot;asshole&quot; - aha! Her easel. We refrained from<br/>
correcting her specifically, but used the word &quot;easel&quot; in *real*<br/>
conversations and she started using the right word after while. (Sigh)<br/>
<br/>
John Holt tells a story about the rise of &quot;the devil-teacher in him&quot; where<br/>
he was being very self-congratulatory about how he cleverly inserted a<br/>
correct pronunciation of a mispronounced word into a conversation with a<br/>
child, with the motivation of subtly instructing her. He later came to<br/>
believe that he was utterly in the wrong to do so, because his whole focus<br/>
in the dialogue had been where and how he could do so, instead of listening<br/>
to the subsequent speech properly and enjoying the moment with his young<br/>
friend. It&#39;s in either &quot;How Children Learn&quot; or &quot;How Children Fail&quot; - both of<br/>
which I have in storage so I can&#39;t check. <br/>
<br/>
Choosing not to correct is sometimes tough to do. I have to do it actively -<br/>
actively hold back the words - and remind myself to stay in the moment,<br/>
especially when Jayn&#39;s meaning is clear and the mistake is essentially<br/>
cosmetic. When Jayn is in the mode of making a correction for herself, she<br/>
will sometimes struggle through several different repetitions of the problem<br/>
word, each on closer to the correct one. The only time I give her the<br/>
information is when she actually asks &quot;Is that right?&quot; Her father and I have<br/>
the same spirit in terms of her writing letters or numbers backwards,<br/>
especially since it is clear that she recognizes letters written the right<br/>
way around. The most important priority is avoiding making her feel<br/>
&quot;in-the-wrong&quot; or self-conscious.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836188640">IMHO getting names right is important, but the rest isn&#39;t so much <br/>
so.  Sure, she&#39;ll probably never meet Judy Blume, but if she did it <br/>
would be a good thing to pronounce her name right, eh?  Correct <br/>
pronunciation and memorization of names is something I feel is <br/>
respectful and important in adult life, but that&#39;s just me.  OTOH, <br/>
knowing how to politely react when the &quot;offended&quot; (wrong word, all i <br/>
can think of at this minute) person corrects them is just as <br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
As for trans-succulent, translucent, ah, he&#39;ll get it when he has <br/>
more experience, right?  I don&#39;t see how a &quot;Yes, they are <br/>
translucent, that&#39;s a big word.&quot; can hurt, reinforce without <br/>
correcting or being patronizing, ya know.<br/>
