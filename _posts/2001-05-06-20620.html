<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864686715">Thought some of you might enjoy reading it...feel free to comment if you<br/>
like.it is an essay I wrote for our homeschool newsletter.  I thought<br/>
someone might find it interesting...I am much more comfortable with you all<br/>
reading<br/>
it than my local group...they already think us strange...we have a lot of<br/>
families that have &quot;school at home&quot; and think those of us that &quot;color<br/>
outside the lines&quot; are somehow not up to par. Oh well...<br/>
<br/>
Meet An Unschooling Family<br/>
Susan Dahlem<br/>
<br/>
     In our life, we are in a constant state of learning and have found that<br/>
we fit best into the &quot;unschoolers&quot; category and strive to do as little &quot;time<br/>
wasting&quot; as possible. We truly feel (from experience of course Ü) that<br/>
school as the masses know it is a serious waste of childhood and not only<br/>
contributes to the ills of our society, but has resulted in the mass<br/>
production of illiterate, unimaginative, uncreative clones of not-so-great<br/>
minds.  If you don&#39;t believe me try to get a correct order at your local<br/>
fast food place two days in a row!<br/>
<br/>
We are trying so very hard to instruct our children to live life, love<br/>
it...learn from it.  Do what they love and love what they do. And NEVER<br/>
gauge their success by anyone&#39;s standards but their own.  Financial gain<br/>
does not = happiness!  Our goals from the beginning of our parenting<br/>
adventure has been to raise our children to be thinkers, as well as doers.<br/>
We want them to respectfully question authority, to do what is right because<br/>
it IS right, take very little at face value, to have a working knowledge of<br/>
numbers and their purpose, and to be able to write out their thoughts<br/>
without hesitation so that they will be understood and their opinions<br/>
respected. We want them to appreciate art for art&#39;s sake, literature or the<br/>
joy of reading and gaining knowledge, and music just because we don&#39;t trust<br/>
anyone who doesn&#39;t love music!!  Ü We want them to be able to orally convey<br/>
their thoughts and opinions as well as being able to write them down so as<br/>
to demand the respect they<br/>
deserve.<br/>
<br/>
     We have never told any one of our 6 children that they were incapable<br/>
of doing anything. We have told them at times they may should try something<br/>
from a different approach.  We have some very confident, strong family<br/>
members who are people with minds, opinions and choices of their own. Our<br/>
approach to learning has always been a little unorthodox doing mostly<br/>
research type learning. You know, getting on a subject and reading, digging<br/>
and reading some more until your curiosity is satisfied. That is how you<br/>
retain things...being interested in it. We have NEVER spoon fed our children<br/>
information and never will. It is a ridiculous tiresome act that is<br/>
completely fruitless--kind of like trying to teach a pig to sing.<br/>
<br/>
     We have tried to stay away from &quot;What Your Fifth Grader Should Know&quot;<br/>
kind of mentality.  Who knows what my fifth grader should know better than<br/>
me and his/her father?  Jessica at 10 years old (approximate 5th grade age)<br/>
could NOT write, recite or grasp multiplication tables.  Couldn&#39;t, wouldn&#39;t<br/>
or what ever the case was.  BUT, she designed, cut, pieced and put together<br/>
a lovely quilt.  So she obviously inadvertently understood some Geometry.  I<br/>
admit being a tad concerned that maybe I had presented the material in a way<br/>
she didn&#39;t understand...and I admit I have little patience with those who do<br/>
not &quot;get&quot; math.... but suddenly almost three years later she woke one day<br/>
and could, and did, do multiplication - short ways, long ways, side ways!<br/>
And as far as I know she still can.<br/>
<br/>
    We have three who have &quot;graduated&quot; and gone on to be productive, decent<br/>
citizens.  No one has been arrested as of this writing... though I admit I<br/>
always saw myself being dragged off with those little twisty ties around my<br/>
wrists, all the while shouting at the top of my lungs some protester&#39;s<br/>
mantra. No I am not disappointed - just surprised - they are their mother&#39;s<br/>
children you know! And their father&#39;s.  They certainly inherited my<br/>
verbosity and Jerry&#39;s bent towards belligerence.  They all have wage earning<br/>
jobs... even old married Jessica has started her own catering business<br/>
(Kneadful Things - want to know more just ask me!).<br/>
<br/>
    We joke sometimes about the amount of useless knowledge we have in our<br/>
heads with Zach and Jerry regularly vying for the crown and title King of<br/>
Trivial Information.  But, you know what is useless to some is useful to<br/>
others.  Analytical Geometry would be completely a waste of brain RAM for<br/>
Zach but, how many bell peppers to a case...now THAT he knows.<br/>

I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the<br/>
essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,<br/>
and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.<br/>

     I enjoyed it very much!  Thanks for sharing it.  And I LOVE <br/>
Thoreau...nothing quite like him!  His writing has inspired me more than any <br/>
other author&#39;s.<br/>
