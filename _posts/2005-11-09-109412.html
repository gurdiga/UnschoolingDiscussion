<div id="ygrps-yiv-469757439">If someone could wave magic wand, I am sure that my 10yod would want to be able to read like some (even younger) kids she knows.<br/>
But I think it is not fair to her to say she is just not working hard enough.  She came out of K where she basically &quot;read&quot; an easy reader weekly and &quot;moved up&quot;.  She was memorizing.  The phonics and other &quot;tools&quot; made no sense to her.  This frustrated her.  <br/>
We stopped doing any &quot;required&quot; stuff and it was 3 years before she would &quot;try&quot; to read.  Phonics still doesn&#39;t make any sense to her but...<br/>
This year she WILL try to read (instructions, notes, recipes and even books :) and WILL write notes and WILL play with words. She is no longer intimidated by written symbols.<br/>
I read to her and she listens to tapes/CDs with the family.  Still, this is not her favorite information resource. <br/>
She can now read a &quot;Little Critter&quot; book.  She reads large words but mainly in context.  I know that she would likely not get half of them on flash cards. She uses picture clues and guesses and sometimes tries to sound things out, but not much.<br/>
Should I sit her down and make her memorize a list daily?  NO!<br/>
I tell others &quot;her reading skills are emerging&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I have 3 kids.  2 are reading.  2 learned while they were &quot;in school&quot;.<br/>
I can see the methods/tools which they used most.  My oldest son came through a &quot;whole language&quot; program, with us sneaking in the phonics part.  He still just mainly memorized words.  Much of his class had &quot;remedial training&quot; when they were in 4th grade.   He did not need it.  He is very visual with an almost photographic memory, so he could do this.<br/>
My middle son (who is very auditory) depended more on the sounds/pattern/flow of the words.  He is very &quot;verbally aware&quot;. Not sure which Gardner intelligence that is : ) <br/>
<br/>
I know that my daughter will just continue to gradually add more words to her list until it clicks.  She will &quot;hit the ground running&quot; with a huge vocabulary from the world around her.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;She was supposed to read early like I did and like other girls do.&quot;<br/>
   ****I have gotten over this. Not ALL do!<br/>
&quot;She is supposed to love reading like I do.&quot;<br/>
  ****She still may.  She has a better chance now than when she was in school.<br/>
<br/>
She is her own person,  learning in her own way.<br/>
She can add numbers in her head that many adults can&#39;t.  <br/>
She loves Shakespeare movies and has no trouble understanding the original prose. <br/>
She knows people learn in different ways and on different time tables.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My job is to help her when she wants help and otherwise, stay out of her way.<br/>
My job is to provide her with a rich environment.<br/>
Support HER!  Encourage HER!  Celebrate HER!  <br/>
<br/>
I will do NOTHING to make her hate reading. I will do NOTHING to harm our relationship<br/>
