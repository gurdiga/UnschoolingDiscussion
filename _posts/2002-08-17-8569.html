&lt;&lt; He loves the idea that there are <br/>
 people out there like that.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Yeh!!  Like us. We&#39;re SCA newbies, just been with them for a few months <br/>
really.....went to an event last year but didn&#39;t really get it together until <br/>
a couple months ago.<br/>
Anyway, are you still going to the conference? The boys could bring their <br/>
youth combat gear if other SCA&#39;ers will be there.<br/>
I think Sandra&#39;s kids are coming, at least some of them.<br/>
My kids had that look of awe at our first event. They could hardly believe <br/>
how cool it was. They still love it and look forward to fighter practice <br/>
every Sunday. Tell Julian he&#39;ll be among some like minded folks (in more than <br/>
one way)!!<br/>

Marty&#39;s a good boffer fighter, but our kingdom doesn&#39;t have &quot;combat gear&quot; <br/>
requirements.  Our kids just don&#39;t hit other kids in the head or with more <br/>
than 180 degree swing.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s safe and would probably be really happy to play boffers with some of <br/>
the other kids!  The hotel might worry, though.  They&#39;d need to keep it just <br/>
pretty quiet and not on the schedule or in a big announced central area, <br/>
maybe.<br/>
<br/>
If you want, I could get Marty to bring boffers.  He could bring his stuff in <br/>
a duffle bag so boffers would fit.  Marty&#39;s pretty tall now (meaning over <br/>
5&#39;4&quot;, from my point of view) but he&#39;s played with all different age kids his <br/>
whole life, so he would be nice and safe for younger guys, and probably not a <br/>
bad fight for older guys!<br/>
