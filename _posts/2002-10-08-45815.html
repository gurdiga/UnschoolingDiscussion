This morning he was playing in the tub, taking his bath.  He said to <br/>
me, &quot;Mom, may I please fart in the tub?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;yes you may...&quot;  (what else COULD I say?!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotta write that one down for the scrapbook!  Only one more, I <br/>
promise!<br/>
<br/>
We were grocery shopping.  The store was rather quiet, and he was <br/>
sitting in the cart yelling, just to hear his voice.  I playfully <br/>
told him, &quot;shhh&quot; and he asked &quot;why?&quot;  I told him he was being <br/>
obnoxious, and he said, &quot;I not noxious, I&#39;m NOAH!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Too funny!<br/>
What laughter they bring!</div>

remember being at a potluck once, and he was getting impatient in the<br/>
line-up for dinner.  I told him to keep his shirt on.  He looked at me like<br/>
I was crazy and said, &quot;I&#39;ve *got* my shirt on.&quot;<br/>

heard an expression before (comes naturally for little ones, right?).  I <br/>
can remember hanging around with Liam and then seeing a clock and realizing <br/>
that we were going to be late for something.  I&#39;d say something like, <br/>
&quot;Omigosh!  We&#39;ve gotta fly!&quot;  Then, looking at Liam&#39;s terrified little face <br/>
and him saying, &quot;Mommy, can&#39;t we just drive there?&quot;<br/>
