<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273009584">Hi!<br/>
Does anyone have any links/info on the original founding of our public<br/>
school system? My teens and I were talking about it. We&#39;ve Googled it and<br/>
got some weak links (no pun intended!) Just thought someone on this list<br/>
might have the way to that info.<br/>
Thanks, Lee<br/>
