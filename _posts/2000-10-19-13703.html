&lt;&lt; BTW, lots of extended nursing in our house too.  My son is 3 and almost 2 <br/>
 months and still nurses to nap and sleep.  It has really cut down since last <br/>
 year at this time.  He is a spirited/high need child, and the nursing has <br/>
 really helped him to have a secure base. And helped me calm him down of <br/>
 course!<br/>

when I was pregnant with my son....oooohhh how I wish we still had that <br/>
wonderful tool!<br/>
