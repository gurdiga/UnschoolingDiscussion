<div id="ygrps-yiv-639804657">It has always amazed me that when I say something to the effect the the Bible <br/>
is just a book IMHO, there are plenty of Christians to jump on me for my <br/>
belief system.  Yet it&#39;s ok that they actually have that belief system and <br/>
nobody is saying &quot;I can&#39;t believe you actually read that Bible book and <br/>
believe in it&quot;... Yet if  someone were to question my belief in Astrologer <br/>
(not that anyone has done that on this list) then it&#39;s an ok to do that.  I <br/>
find this all quite amusing..<br/>
<br/>
I welcome the opportunity to debate my belief systems yet some people who <br/>
believe the Bible is the only true word of God think it&#39;s blasphemy to <br/>
question this book.  Surely God wants us to question everything otherwise why <br/>
did he/she bother to give us brains?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting a bit fed up with people quoting the bible like that&#39;s suppose to <br/>
make some difference in what they end up saying.   That only works if you <br/>
believe in that system of worship (which by the way is another enormously <br/>
rigid entity like the educational system and the goverment).<br/>
<br/>
How would you all feel if I kept on talking about where Pluto was this week, <br/>
what aspects it&#39;s going to be making to Mars.  Which house is having the <br/>
toughest time in New York?  What about Saturn and the Karma we are creating <br/>
not living a harmonious life with the Universe?<br/>
<br/>
Not really annoyed just some thoughts that were running through my head.  I <br/>
got away from the educational establishment so that I can question other <br/>
beliefs and thoughts not to be told that I was evil.  Evil for having my own <br/>
belief systems?  Good ridance to those people who believe that.  It would <br/>
appear their narrow minds are not readiy for unschooling.<br/>

I, too, think LivingLighthouse&#39;s condemnation of the list as evil was going a <br/>

There are Christians who wish other Christians wouldn&#39;t worship the Bible.  <br/>

maybe you should have said that it&#39;s just a book TO YOU.  to so many<br/>
people, it&#39;s NOT &#39;just a book&#39; and your attitude is extremely<br/>
disrespectful, just as it would be disrespectful for someone to belittle<br/>
your religion or what have you.  <br/>
I am absolutely in shock at how in one day of being on this list I&#39;ve<br/>
seen nothing but attacks on people and bickering back and forth. <br/>
Like.....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Good ridance to those people who believe that.  It would <br/>
appear their narrow minds are not readiy for unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If this is what unschooling is to you and everyone else on this list,<br/>
damned right I&#39;m not ready for it.  Holy cow!  I cannot believe how<br/>
childish and horrible you all seem to each other!<br/>
<br/>
Is this how it is all the time or am I just showing up on the wrong day?<br/>

delete a lot of e-mails when I see a lot of bible stuff quoted <br/>
because for me it&#39;s not helpful.  I was brought up Church of England, <br/>
baptized and know quite a bit about the Church.  I think it&#39;s because <br/>
I want to hear what &quot;you&quot; are thinking not what you are able to quote <br/>
from a book.  Anyone can memorize a book, whatever that book <br/>
contains, and then write it.  Thats was PS teaches us to do.<br/>

to prove some point or other, they&#39;re going to lose me.  There&#39;s plenty in <br/>
the Bible to appreciate and learn from, but when it&#39;s used to prove a <br/>
point, the &quot;provee&quot; would have to believe that it&#39;s actually the word of <br/>
God, which I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I have no desire to criticize people of any faith or try to talk them out <br/>
of it.  I also expect that they won&#39;t criticize mine, or try to make me <br/>
believe theirs.  Unfortunately, there are *some* Christians (and people of <br/>
other faiths) who would try to do just that.  *That* kind of Christian, I&#39;m <br/>
happy to stay away from.  The rest add a valuable point of view.<br/>
