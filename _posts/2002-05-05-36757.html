(edited message)This thread reminds me of a story I heard a few years <br/>
ago....<br/>
There was a very poor woman in some country in central or South America. She<br/>
was talking to a wealthy, well educated man at her church that was visiting<br/>
from America. He had given a sermon on the importance of bettering one&#39;s lot<br/>
in life by making the best use of whatever resources you currently have<br/>
available.... He told her that she should learn about those ants and her <br/>
stoop then...She eventually went on to write books about the things she had <br/>
learned and making quite a bit of money.<br/>
<br/>
I may have the details not quite right, but the jist is that learning about<br/>
one thing kept leading to learning about something else. And a woman who<br/>
thought that she couldn&#39;t learn anything or make anything better out of her<br/>
life was able to do so. And she did it on her own. Kind of like unschooling,<br/>
don&#39;t you think?<br/>

Thank you for posting this story.  It has been very insightful for me.  I <br/>
sometimes get anxious that we aren&#39;t doing enough - and that probably won&#39;t <br/>
change...:-), but your story has helped quell my most recent worries.  <br/>
Thanks.<br/>
