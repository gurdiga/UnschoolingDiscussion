<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483081157">**Well....I know one of the leading Paleontologists in the entire WORLD did <br/>
not get a college degree, he hated school and dropped out twice. Jack Horner <br/>
has made some of the greatest discoveries in the world of Paleontology, and <br/>
after making a name for himself earned an honorary degree.**<br/>
<br/>
Well, not exactly. He has written that he just couldn&#39;t get himself to do the <br/>
humanities requirements for a degree - but he took every undergraduate and <br/>
graduate course available in biology in geology. He describes himself as <br/>
dyslexic. (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.west.net/~ger/JackHorner.html)">http://www.west.net/~ger/JackHorner.html)</a> He was remarkably single minded <br/>
from a very young age. His is a remarkable story of persistance, and of <br/>
pursuing what one loves.<br/>
<br/>
Jack Horner &quot;First of all, you should know that I would&#39;ve done this as a <br/>
hobby. When I went to school I of course took a lot of paleontology classes but I <br/>
also studied petroleum geology so that I could go out and get a job as a <br/>
petroleum engineer and look for fossils on the side. I would have been a truck <br/>
driver or anything else so long as I could look for fossils whether I got paid <br/>
for it or not.&quot;<br/>
