<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749965609">I just joined this list. I live in Ohio and I have 3 daughters, Renee(16), <br/>
Angie(14), and Michelle(8). We have only been homeschooling a little over a <br/>
year. <br/>
I had thought of homeschooling on and off over the years, but never did <br/>
anything about it because I didn&#39;t know how to go about it (fear of the <br/>
unknown). Well, I finally got over that fear when Renee almost commited <br/>
suicide. She made really bad &quot;friends&quot; at school and got into drugs and sex <br/>
and then got really depressed. I took her out of  her second year of 8th <br/>
grade to save her life. <br/>
I pulled Michelle out a week later and Angie a month later (Angie was a <br/>
cheerleader and very &quot;into&quot; school).<br/>
We did &quot;school at home&quot; for about a week, then I read an article by Sandra <br/>
Dodd in HEM magazine about unschooling and I just &quot;knew&quot; that this is what I <br/>
was searching for. Then I read Grace Llewelyn&#39;s(sp?) book and just LOVED it. <br/>
I was still &quot;scared&quot; at that point because I didn&#39;t know if I would be able <br/>
to find a certified teacher who would sign the &quot;assessment papers&quot; that I <br/>
have to send to the school district every year. Anyway, after weeks of <br/>
praying, I found this wonderful woman who unschools her children, and who is <br/>
also a certified teacher and made our &quot;assessment&quot; this year a really good <br/>
experience. I can now relax and let my children learn and grow at their own <br/>
pace and I thank God everyday of my life for this woman. My biggest regret in <br/>
life is not pulling my children out of p.s. earlier.<br/>
Sorry this is so long!<br/>

&gt;Mary Ellen,  My Name is Tanya, I am also new to this list, and also live in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ohio, near canton and massillon, I have a 12yo daughter Morgan who is ADD I<br/>
pulled her out of school in Feb (best decision I have ever made, should have<br/>
done it years ago!!!)<br/>
I also have three other children, Allison 10, Alex 8, and Jack 10 mos, I<br/>
plan to keep the other two home in the fall as this is what they want! I am<br/>
thirty three and my husband is thirty six, he is more scared of<br/>
homeschooling and unschooling in particular than I am but is willing to give<br/>
it a go, as he figures, the job he has, he had no formal training for, and<br/>
it is one that requires a 4 year degree do get into now, if he didn&#39;t go to<br/>
collage how did he learn all of this stuff? he had the interest and drive to<br/>
learn more!!!<br/>
I would like to know more about the evaluation you had for your children, I<br/>
went with the Iowa standardized testing, because I could not get a good<br/>
explanation of any other route to go! I do not beleive in testing, but<br/>
wasn&#39;t sure how to go about the other, and if you are unschooling, what are<br/>
you using as work samples to be evaluated??<br/>
unschooling fits us very well, and I am not sure I could ever go the other<br/>
way!,<br/>
well, enough about me, I think this will be a great place!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-182516173">Hi Tanya,<br/>
              I live in Navarre, on the outskirts of Brewster (right on 93). <br/>
We are very close to Massillon.<br/>
I don&#39;t believe in testing either. That&#39;s why I&#39;m so glad I found this <br/>
certified teacher. <br/>
She was living in this area, but just moved to Cincinnati. I plan to make the <br/>
drive once a year, though!<br/>
She thinks of the &quot;assessment&quot; as a &quot;show and tell&quot;. She told me to collect <br/>
pamphlets from museums, etc. Scrapbooks of things children have done, special <br/>
project they are proud of.<br/>
She enjoys talking with the children and she understands that some children <br/>
don&#39;t like to talk. She&#39;s O.K. with that. My children felt really comfortable <br/>
with her.<br/>
Legally, she needs to see something from the beginning of the year and <br/>
something from the end, so date everything.(Although I didn&#39;t).<br/>
What I used as samples this year were lists of books my children read, T.V. <br/>
shows and movies they watched, cooking, sewing, taking care of pets, etc.<br/>
Her children are great, too. A boy (10), and a girl (7). They&#39;ve never been <br/>
to school.<br/>
Gotta go, daughter no.2 wants to use the phone!<br/>

post!!! we are neighbors practically, I live downtown Brewster!!! right by<br/>
the elementary school!<br/>
my kids are 12, 10, 8, and 10 mos! I would love to get together with someone<br/>
who also beleives in unschooling and chat! my neighbor also homeschools, but<br/>
she does a very strict corriculum, and two other people on the street are<br/>
going to be doing this also, I am sure they will be unschooling  also, I<br/>
would be very interested in schedualing feild trips in groups that would be<br/>
sort of fun! are you interested by chance?<br/>
