 Well, yesterday my son and his 2 friends found a dead squirrel &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a great website for reconstructing a squirrel skeleton, assuming you <br/>
get to it (the skeleton that is).<br/>
We found a mostly decomposed skeleton not too long ago, glued it to cardboard <br/>
and then did a reconstruction online which led to a lot of fun things we <br/>
looked up on google.<br/>

It&#39;ll help you out if you get stuck, we printed our finished version out on <br/>
paper. Fun!<br/>
