<div id="ygrps-yiv-690760417">Hi Kathryn, I am way behind on my mail and just came across<br/>
this.<br/>
I was sorry to hear about your accident.  I have been a car<br/>
accident<br/>
victim 5 times (as a passenger in each one) so believe me I<br/>
sympathize.<br/>
2 years ago (at a time when I was soooo sick and dd was<br/>
even sicker <br/>
and money was a word we whispered in hushed tones with the<br/>
reverence<br/>
held by those who never have enough of it to make ends<br/>
meet)<br/>
my husband was hit by a truck doing 80 in stop and go<br/>
traffic (Marco was <br/>
going 30).<br/>
<br/>
There was a state police car in the lane next to my husband<br/>
when it happened.<br/>
He was in our new Dodge Shadow and the guy in a Suburban<br/>
slammed into him<br/>
just as the police car was trying to get into that lane.<br/>
It was awful.  Getting that<br/>
phone call from the state police was something I&#39;ll never<br/>
forget.  I cried then.  I cried <br/>
when doctors told me Marco was surprising everybody - the<br/>
cops had phoned him in<br/>
as dead at the scene and had actually called for the<br/>
coroner (who had just gone to another<br/>
accident site with them) to come back and call it - with<br/>
how well his body was responding.<br/>
I cried when he got home and you know what? Interestingly<br/>
enough I sobbed my heart out<br/>
when I saw what was left of our car (they had to saw open<br/>
the hood even just to get to the insurance papers in the<br/>
glove compartment!).  Strange.  I never cry but I even<br/>
sobbed like a baby<br/>
when the insurance came through and it turned out to only<br/>
be enough to finish paying off <br/>
the wreck that had once been our car.  That whole time was<br/>
such an emotional rollercoaster<br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
You are thankful for everyone not being more hurt than they<br/>
are but you can&#39;t help but worry about <br/>
the $$$ end of it.  Everyone who had seen the car (from the<br/>
mechanics to the people who processed<br/>
the pictures of the car) kept offering their condolences<br/>
and then when I told them my husband was <br/>
alive kept saying things like God was on his side! or He<br/>
must have had an angel with him! or stuff<br/>
like that.  Well, I don&#39;t believe in God per se but I do<br/>
believe in the power of vibrations.  I decided at<br/>
one point enough belly aching (and with all the worrying I<br/>
had been doing I do mean BELLY ACHING, <br/>
literally) it was time to stop wondering why him, why us,<br/>
why now? and start focusing on the positive.<br/>
What&#39;s that song say? Accentuate the Positive? I did and I<br/>
found out about Herbalife and I started making<br/>
some money, working part time at home, around our<br/>
homeschooling and my 2 jobs.  I was able to quit my two<br/>
jobs and get off my 14 meds a day and turn sooo much<br/>
around.  And I truly believe that if it <br/>
hadn&#39;t been Herbalife it would have been something else<br/>
just as wonderful simply because I was determined to focus<br/>
on the champagne we wanted not the lemons we&#39;d been handed.<br/>
 I have come to believe that we get what we focus on.  Like<br/>
when you&#39;re driving - take your eyes off the road often<br/>
enough and that&#39;s exactly where you&#39;ll probably end up.  <br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s hard but try to start each day focusing on the<br/>
good stuff you want and how great it will feel to<br/>
get it.  If you&#39;re at all like me or feeling like I was You<br/>
know how to do depressed and frustrated already. Try doing<br/>
excited and anticipating.  I found a book Excuse Me, Your<br/>
life is Waiting and it took me to new heights.  It sure<br/>
came in handy on Sept. 11 when my husband was stuck in<br/>
Manhattan and I couldn&#39;t reach him for almost two days.  I<br/>
would highly suggest it.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, this was just my two cents but I hope it helped.  I<br/>
don&#39;t usually get this personal on the list but<br/>
what you wrote touched me, I just hope maybe my experience<br/>
will help you.<br/>
<br/>
Take care and Be well - Jacli<br/>
