<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332518279">Hi,<br/>
This is from a Muslim girl on another list I am on....<br/>
Not all Palestinians are celebrating these unforgivable events!<br/>
What we see on the media is what they choose to photograph...and some of<br/>
them<br/>
may have their own agendas too.<br/>
Colin Powell spoke up and told people on ABC News that the Jerusalem office<br/>
was receiving many many calls of support from Palestinians.  They are upset<br/>
too and angered that they are being portrayed through the photos of the<br/>
actions of some stupid people.<br/>
Yasir Arafat donated blood as a show of support.<br/>
Many Palestinians have relatives in America.  My husband is Palestinian and<br/>
he is horrified and deeply saddened and angered by the terrorist attacks.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing you need to know about Islam is that it is a religion of<br/>
peace.  In fact the name &quot;Islam&quot;  comes from the root word &quot;salaam&quot;  which<br/>
is<br/>
the Arabic word for peace.<br/>
<br/>
Please note that I don&#39;t consider the criminals who were involved in these<br/>
events to be practicing their religion (whatever religion they may have<br/>
claimed to follow) anymore than I consider Protestants in Ireland throwing<br/>
rocks at Catholic schoolgirls or Timothy McVeigh to be practicing theirs.<br/>
Any person may wear a label just as s/he wears a designer shirt, but that<br/>
doesn&#39;t necessarily mean anything more than that.  Some folks wear labels<br/>
for<br/>
social reasons, some for whatever other reasons, and for some it is to try<br/>
to<br/>
easily explain their beliefs.  Then there are the shirts or watches that<br/>
spout the name brand, but were actually made in a backstreet sweat shop by<br/>
people who don&#39;t have quality materials.  These guys are like that.  They<br/>
may<br/>
resemble a great name brand, but they are actually not the genuine<br/>
article....fakes hiding behind the name.<br/>
<br/>
All religions have had and continue to have these kinds of people claiming<br/>
to<br/>
be &quot;of them.&quot;  They find this association convenient for their own purposes.<br/>
Let&#39;s not even talk about the Crusades.  We don&#39;t want another one of<br/>
those!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I prefer the Arabic term &quot;mu&#39;min&quot;  which simply means<br/>
&quot;believer,&quot;<br/>
and which is used in the Qur&#39;an.  In this case, the condition of the heart<br/>
is<br/>
the deciding factor, not the label.</div>
