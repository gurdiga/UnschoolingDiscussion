<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920514885">In my opinion, this conversation has gotten to be very droll.  Though I believe hierarchies are naturally formed, I am very annoyed with the lack of effort the opposition is putting forth in regard to research, facts and quots.  Research is part of my job, especially utilizing the internet.  I challenge someone from the opposition to present some factual evidence that can be quoted instead of just hypotheticals situations, or opinion-based rhetoric. <br/>
<br/>
I posted many links that may have been useful for anyone wanting to do research for the opposition.  Nobody seemed to want to make the effort, or to even find their own examples.  Forgive me if I missed posts in which some concrete examples were mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
Here is another link that may be useful to the opposition.  Can any points be made from it?  I love to read intelligent argument/debate, but this one is lacking.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not meaning to be rude, but wouldn&#39;t it be a great unschooling lesson to do research on your opinion, discover why you believe what you believe and see if anyone else has agreed with you?  Wouldn&#39;t it be good for your children to see you doing this?  It&#39;s important to examine our beliefs, expose them to scrutiny and discover whether they hold up or if they crumble.  It&#39;s not shame to discover that something we&#39;ve once truly believed doesn&#39;t hold water.  We can change.  At the same time, when one is very passionate about a belief, and desirous of convincing others, it is up to that zealott to present a solid and persuasive argument, while the other side remains open.  Some people like the agree to disagree notion, while others will never be satisfied with it.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that something positive comes out of this, and that it is a lesson for our children looking on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163065751">These were REALLY interesting links, Nichole. Thank you. I haven&#39;t <br/>
really spent time looking at historical aspects of libertarian <br/>
societies and these are fascinating!!!<br/>
<br/>
What they are talking about is ranking according to private property <br/>
ownership, as opposed to other ways of ranking, really. I mean - what <br/>
they are looking at are societies in which there was no other authority <br/>
than who owned what.<br/>
