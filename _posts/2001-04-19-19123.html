<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381806629"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;my boys love to hammer, nail, etc. .......but I have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>GREAT &gt;difficulty in getting them to clean up for the<br/>
day &gt;when they are done. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Annette, in Indiana <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with whoever said that they should not have<br/>
the priveledge of using the items in question if they<br/>
do not care for them, and particularly if they are not<br/>
theirs.  Another idea would be to get them their own<br/>
set and let them abuse it.  If they ruin or lose them,<br/>
do not replace them.  If they complain, remind them<br/>
that THEY decided not to care for their things.  <br/>
<br/>
My four year old is often incredibly ostinate.  When<br/>
he has dumped his toys all over the floor and refuses<br/>
to pick them up, we remove every toy he will not pick<br/>
up to time out for a while (1 day, 2, or more).  We<br/>
tell him that if he cannot care for them, he does not<br/>
need to have them.  He used to have the kids&#39; book<br/>
collection in his room, but whenever he got mad, he<br/>
would sweep clear the shelves into a big pile and<br/>
refuse to pick them up later.  I warned him that he<br/>
would lose the books, and they have been happily<br/>
residing in his brother&#39;s room for some time now.  My<br/>
four year old just recently got back the priveledge of<br/>
having books to take to bed with him.  We have been<br/>
making sure that all bedtime books are cleared away to<br/>
the other room before tucking him in for the night.<br/>
