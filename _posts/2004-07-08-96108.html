<div id="ygrps-yiv-226306937">GREAT WHALE WATCHING NEWS!<br/>
 <br/>
Come Whale Watching with a cool bunch of Unschoolers!<br/>
 <br/>
As part of the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference in Peabody, <br/>
Massachusetts August 27-29, we were able to get a good deal with another Whale Watch <br/>
company, also out of Gloucester, for more Whale Watching tickets. The company is <br/>
Yankee Fleet, and we’ll have a link to them on the web site soon.  <br/>
 <br/>
Tickets will be $16 per person if you send a check, or $17 per person if you <br/>
do credit card via Paypal (they charge substantial fees). <br/>
 <br/>
If you’d like to join us, please e-mail us at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:LiveandLearn2004@...">LiveandLearn2004@...</a>. Let <br/>
me know if you’re sending a check (address below) or if you’d like to use <br/>
Paypal. If you want to use Paypal, please make sure you send me an accurate e-mail <br/>
address, and we’ll send you a Request for Payment.<br/>
 <br/>
The Whale Watches will take place in Gloucester, MA on Sunday afternoon after <br/>
the conference.  Whale Watches will return about 5:30-6 PM. Gloucester is <br/>
about 30 minutes drive from Peabody. <br/>
