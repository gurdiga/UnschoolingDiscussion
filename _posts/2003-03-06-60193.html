seven year old can spend the night with a friend for two nights! Then you&#39;d <br/>
be SOOO suprised how much you can do! I&#39;d forgotten what life was like <br/>
pre-&#39;puter; I got TONS done. I totally cleaned Duncan&#39;s room. We rearranged <br/>
Cameron&#39;s room, and he&#39;s started painting one wall. Cam and I started <br/>
demolishing the upstairs bathroom (sledgehammering the tile and tub out!). <br/>
And I REALLY cleaned out my bathroom downstairs. <br/>
<br/>
The house is not finished---but, damn, it looks better! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
