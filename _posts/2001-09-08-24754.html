<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900987442">STUDENTS AGAINST TESTING - PROTEST OCTOBER 9TH<br/>
Bill Wetzel, founder of Power to the Youth (www.youthpower.net) has created<br/>
a resource and networking center called Students Against Testing  (SAT!).<br/>
The website is www.NoMoreTests.com, and includes an enormous and  thorough<br/>
collection of research and information regarding standardized  testing and<br/>
the growing mass of people throughout the country who are opposed to the<br/>
recent push for more testing.  You will find quotes,  research articles,<br/>
speeches by Paul Wellstone, Jonathan Kozol, Alfie Kohn,  and a great deal<br/>
more.<br/>
Featured on the website is a protest against the tests that will be held in<br/>
Palisades, NY.  All are welcome to attend, and Bill Wetzel can send out<br/>
information packets to those people, groups, or schools who would like to<br/>
attend.  Here is a short description from the site:<br/>
&quot;On October 9th, Students Against Testing will be joining hands with<br/>
activists all around the Northeast to make our voices known at the 2001<br/>
National Education Summit in Palisades, NY. The summit is an exclusive,<br/>
invitation-only meeting attended by presidents, governors, business<br/>
executives, state superintendents, and media -- with no principals or<br/>
teachers invited. The single focus of the gathering is to expand<br/>
&#39;standards-based education&#39; as widely and quickly as possible -- which<br/>
translates into more time and energy focused on<br/>
standardized testing and less on real learning in classrooms across the<br/>
nation. Standardized testing has, time and again, proven to be an<br/>
ineffective and mind-numbing way of &#39;educating&#39; today&#39;s  youth.&quot;<br/>
