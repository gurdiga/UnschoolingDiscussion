&lt;&lt;On the other hand, I&#39;ll be really glad not to take three kids on the city<br/>
buses.&gt;&gt;<br/>

Funny how families are so different. Tara just turned 17 and was on a city<br/>
bus for the first time in her life last week. In my 45 years, I&#39;ve only been<br/>
on once, and oddly enough, it was when I was 16.<br/>

really had to and really hates them.  I don&#39;t mind them at all, just not<br/>
with all the little ones.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131069731">I said that people are defensive, not offended. Meaning they have to tell <br/>
me how they couldn&#39;t live without their cars and justify all the times they <br/>
use it and all the places they have to drive.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care. I really don&#39;t. I&#39;m not always sure why people do this. I <br/>
understand that most people need cars, really *need* them to get to work <br/>
and get around. Many cities are really hard to get around by bus or foot or <br/>
bike, and in a rural area you don&#39;t get around at all without a car. I <br/>
don&#39;t want one right now and have made choices that make not having a car <br/>
easier.<br/>
<br/>
We belong to a carshare with (so far) only one car, and it is parked about <br/>
5 kilometres across the bridge from my house,so I don&#39;t use it much. Some <br/>
big cities like Toronto and Montreal have carshares with cars throughout <br/>
the city. The best thing about belonging to the carshare is we have a <br/>
corporate account with a car rental company that gives us reduced rates and <br/>
preferred service. We use that frequently when the weather is good. We go <br/>
camping, to my family&#39;s cottage, the zoo, my in-laws in Cape Breton, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m almost sure we will buy another car in the near future, when the <br/>
benefits outweigh the costs.<br/>
