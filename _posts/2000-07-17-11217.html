<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571714309">We currently have a dog, actually 2 since we are<br/>
dogwatching for mil the next few months, and 2 cats.<br/>
It has been good for the kids I think. The cat had<br/>
babies, we have one left (the other we gave away). It<br/>
was good experience for the kids to watch the cat<br/>
change during pg and then to watch the babies grow.<br/>
Also, on the care, of course the vet I pretty much<br/>
handle be cause my oldest is 5, but it is something<br/>
that I involve the kids in as well. I make sure they<br/>
feed and water the animals every day and they are<br/>
happy to do so. 3yod, I think, has finally quit<br/>
retrieving her cat and sticking it face in the food<br/>
when she feeds it. I don&#39;t know how many times I had<br/>
to tell her that the cat doesn&#39;t need help eating. I<br/>
think she gets this from watching me nurse her little<br/>
brother. When we get the cow I intend to let them help<br/>
with the feeding and watering as well. They loved<br/>
feeding hay to mema&#39;s cow when we would go for a<br/>
visit.<br/>

I do not know where you live but here is a link from Google for Rabbit Rescue <br/>
services throughout the US.  <br/>

<br/>
Maybe you could find one close enough to you, that you guys could go out and <br/>
talk to these people.  <br/>
They could help you and the kids make a good decision, give good care tips <br/>
and you could adopted a rabbit from them or maybe even foster a rabbit.  If <br/>
they have a foster program than you could do that with out being obligated to <br/>
keep the rabbit if it doesnt work out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894809836">Hi Dawn,<br/>
<br/>
I think caring for animals is a wonderful way for children to learn to<br/>
have empathy for other beings.  Also to develop a sense of<br/>
responsibility.  However, any pet should be the ultimate responsibility<br/>
of the adult in the family.  Pets are more then just an interesting<br/>
experiment.  You have chosen to care for another living being, a child is<br/>
not capable of fully comprehending that.  You must consider food costs,<br/>
vet costs (a possibility even for rabbits), potential damage caused by<br/>
the pet and if you are willing to deal with it, and the life span of the<br/>
pet-can you keep them that length of time.  All of this goes along with<br/>
the joy of pet ownership.  <br/>
<br/>
In regards to the miracle of birth,  unfortunately for pets in the United<br/>
States, the &quot;miracle&quot; of  death is far too common.  There are not enough<br/>
homes and millions of unwanted pets.  The babies you as an owner find<br/>
homes for are statistically very  likely not in a permanent home and you<br/>
cannot guarantee the new owner will not have babies too.  Euthanasia is<br/>
often the only &quot;solution&quot; for millions of unwanted pets.  Some shelters<br/>
also have small animals such as rabbits, rats and guinea pigs.  Please<br/>
check with your local shelter.<br/>
<br/>
Just a note of caution about rabbits;  I don&#39;t know if by &quot;in the garden&quot;<br/>
 you meant in a hutch or not.  As a kid we had rabbits who we fenced in a<br/>
small section of our yard.  They dug way underground and came up on the<br/>
other side of the fence and had a hay day in our garden.  My sister and I<br/>
thought it was great but my mom was not nearly as thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for being preachy, pets and pet overpopulation is a sensitive<br/>
subject with me.<br/>

Shelley, <br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for saying this, I too am sensitive about this subject as <br/>
well.  Unfortunately using animals that are overpopulated, to let children <br/>
witness the miracle of birth, is just not giving the kids a good lesson.  <br/>
Unless of course you explain to them what will happen to these animals.<br/>
<br/>
Dawn really really check out a rabbit rescue service, it is very possible <br/>
they may have a foster program.  That is a much better route than going to <br/>
say a pet shop or a feed store from them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-822328402">I am, I am guys!!!!  That&#39;s why I wanted feedback... I have absolutely no <br/>
intention of purchasing said rabbit today.  Today is a &quot;let&#39;s look at what&#39;s <br/>
involved&quot; day.  I already talked to hubbie about which &quot;grown up&quot; was <br/>
actually going to have to do the taking care and we&#39;ve both decided we could <br/>
handle it between us.  I like the idea of a foster rabbit and called the <br/>
Humane Society and are going there to take a look this morning.  I&#39;ve only <br/>
ever had cats when I lived in England (and didn&#39;t bring them to the States) <br/>
so have no idea about other animals.  (My cats went to 2 good homes before <br/>
anybody wants to know what became of them)...<br/>
<br/>
This is more an experiment of &quot;what&#39;s Zak really interested in&quot; than &quot;let&#39;s <br/>
get a pet&quot;..  I&#39;m actually quite reluctant to have animals until I know <br/>
everything there is to know about said species.<br/>

Oh well off on our trip.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993853075">I have 4 boys and we have had various pets at various times. I have to say that<br/>
they have all responded differently to their responsibilities. They generally<br/>
start off enthusiastic, but then get sick of the concept. Our rabbits are still<br/>
fed and watered, but their hutch doesn&#39;t get cleaned out nearly often enough<br/>
(still, that&#39;s only my opinion - if you looked at the kids rooms you&#39;d see that<br/>
they treat the rabbits better than themselves I guess :-( ) and they don&#39;t get<br/>
them out and play with them often enough, which means they are no longer very<br/>
tame. The dog is new, and so far well looked after. The cat was looked after very<br/>
well in her later years by my youngest, but earlier, I had to be constantly<br/>
nagging my eldest to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Be aware of your child&#39;s ways: my #2 couldn&#39;t clean out the rabbit hutch without<br/>
vommiting! He just couldn&#39;t cope with handling poop! #3 cleans up the dog messes<br/>
without a second thought.<br/>
<br/>
I think the animals *are* my responsibility. I help the kids when they aren&#39;t<br/>
coping, because the animal must be cared for or it dies. I think that if you make<br/>
that decision to have pets, life will be a lot easier if you accept beforehand<br/>
that the pet is your responsibility, even if you delegate that responsibility<br/>
most of the time. Otherwise, i guarantee you will end up feeling resentful! Been<br/>
there, done that &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Dawn,  we started out this summer finding some frog eggs.  We have been <br/>
raising tadpoles since mid June.  They are now out in the back yard in a <br/>
plastic  baby pool, and are beginning to grow their back legs!  From this, we <br/>
expanded our learning to include fish, so we bought a 10 gal aquarium, and <br/>
have gradually added 10 fish.  My oldest (almost 6yo) helps to feed the fish, <br/>
and likes to help me clean the tank.  In addition to that we have a dog, and <br/>
my son takes her out to &quot;use the potty&quot;, and sometimes feeds her, too.    We <br/>
have not done a lot of research, but we did get some books on frogs, and <br/>
looked up info on frogs on the web.   I have taken him and his bro. to 2 <br/>
different pet stores to see different fish, and they have seen me show how to <br/>
treat water to remove chlorine, boil rocks before adding them to the tank, <br/>
etc...  I have also made it a point to tell the kids the breed names of our <br/>
fish, so they can begin to learn them.   In addition, we have a goldfish pond <br/>
out back, and we also made it a point to watch birds and butterflies over <br/>
this summer, and looked up varieties of both on the web.  That&#39;s as much as <br/>
we have done with animals so far.  I would love to raise rabbits one day-- <br/>
got to convince dh to go along with it though!  :)  ~Karen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-818542013">How old is your son?  While rabbits look cute and sweet, unless they are<br/>
handled from birth they can be quite a handful for a smaller child.  They<br/>
kick and have razor sharp toe nails and they also bite.  Some breeds like<br/>
lops are more inclined to be mellow and some of the dwarf breeds are quite<br/>
agressive.<br/>
<br/>
Along with the rescue folks you might check with your local ag extention<br/>
office and see if their is a local 4-H&#39;er that would &quot;mentor&quot; your son when<br/>
he first gets his rabbit.  The older kidlets had 4-H show rabbits and they<br/>
mentored new rabbit owners.<br/>
