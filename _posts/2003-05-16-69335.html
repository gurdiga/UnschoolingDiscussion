<div id="ygrps-yiv-131031696">While it hasn&#39;t been particularly calm around this list lately, it&#39;s been a<br/>
great week at my house.<br/>
<br/>
Tim and I spent all of Tuesday afternoon hunting toy stores in town for a<br/>
much desired lego set.  We eventually bought a different, smaller set and<br/>
came home to check the internet.  Oh.  It&#39;ll be released on May 29, and it<br/>
costs $100.  So now he&#39;s wanting it for his birthday this summer!  That&#39;s a<br/>
little out of his range.<br/>
<br/>
But in the several hours of driving around looking for this set, we had<br/>
great conversations about Marco Polo and Kublai Kahn.  Tim brought a book<br/>
home from the library on Marco Polo a couple weeks ago, and we read it<br/>
together.  It&#39;s been chaotic here lately, so I never really asked why he was<br/>
interested in Marco Polo.  (Tim goes to the library at the military school<br/>
once a week; I don&#39;t go, so I often miss his reasoning in wanting a<br/>
particular book.)  <br/>
<br/>
Turns out Marco Polo&#39;s adventures are the whole point of this most recent<br/>
lego series called Orient Adventures.  He&#39;s been reading all about them in<br/>
lego magazine, wanted more information, and found it.  Now he wanted the<br/>
legos so he could really play the stuff that comes out of the books.  He<br/>
also announced he needed a bigger lego space, which involved room<br/>
rearranging, and he cleaned up his room to facilitate that.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like shouting from the rooftops that unschooling really works! to<br/>
everybody who&#39;s ever told me it won&#39;t work, he&#39;ll never learn to follow<br/>
through on things, do research, etc.  But so many people would never see<br/>
this, because it looks just like play.  It&#39;s &quot;just legos&quot;.  Wrong!<br/>
<br/>
Happy, calm, relaxed week.<br/>
