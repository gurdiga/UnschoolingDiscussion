almost always delightful. <br/>

&gt; &gt; But what&#39;s the transistion from<br/>
&gt; &gt; that to taking responsibility for themselves?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If that&#39;s your semi-conscious goal, then you&#39;re probably sending that<br/>
&gt; message and he&#39;s going to feel pushed. Which will make him pull back if <br/>
&gt; he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not ready to go. Make him feel like you&#39;ll be there forever and he&#39;ll feel<br/>
&gt; secure pulling away when he&#39;s ready.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>AH  AH -- I just thought of something really important to say to those of you <br/>
with younger children..... you don&#39;t need to worry about them becoming <br/>
responsible for themselves if YOU are willing to LET them be when they want <br/>
to be to the extent that they are reasonably competent to be. It is human <br/>
nature to grab at it -- they will do that. <br/>
<br/>
So - yes -- if you give him the message that he can&#39;t even trust himself to <br/>
know if he&#39;s hungry or not -- that undermines him taking responsibility for <br/>
himself in the future. So never get into the: &quot;Here, you need to eat this <br/>
because you&#39;re cranky.&quot; &quot;No, I&#39;m not hungry.&quot; &quot;Yes, I think you are.&quot;.....  <br/>
kind of power struggle. That would be undermining, imo.<br/>
<br/>
 But - if you put out of tray of cheese and crackers or whatever, and he <br/>
takes some and eats it and feels better, you just allowed him to be IN <br/>
control and do something beneficial for himself. That isn&#39;t undermining - <br/>
that is supporting.<br/>
<br/>
If he DOESN&quot;T eat it and he is still really cranky and hard to get along with <br/>
-- maybe it is something else and not being hungry. Take it at face value <br/>
that time and offer food EARLIER next time.<br/>

<br/>
Kids don&#39;t fit them, ever, of course. But it makes it easier to get through a <br/>
tough time when you know there are stages as kids grow up. Remember that your <br/>
8 yo just thinks the 3 yo will ALWAYS be like this -- no perspective. So <br/>
another thing to do is tell him, over and over, that the 3 yo will change, <br/>
that this is temporary. Maybe you can say, &quot;Like so-and-so changed....&quot; if <br/>
there is someone he knows who went through a difficult stage and came out the <br/>
other end an okay kid.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206422215">I have been reading the posts on 2 different threads, the ones about kids<br/>
who get cranky and need to eat and the ones about kids who have meltdowns.<br/>
I have one kid who fits both of those categories, like Pam&#39;s child he is<br/>
now 15.  My doctor tells me that stress can also cause hypoglycemia, my son<br/>
even ocasionally gets blinding headaches from this, I think it is when his<br/>
blood sugar levels plummet.  He almost passed out in an airport a couple of<br/>
months ago, missed his flight and everything, I think he hadn&#39;t eaten much<br/>
and had just had a very emotional parting:(<br/>
I wanted to add a positive twist to the explosive type of personality.  My<br/>
son has always had an intense extreme personality, he doesn&#39;t have a lot of<br/>
medium speed, the world is either wonderful or everything is awful.<br/>
However, this means that when he gets involved in something he doesn&#39;t<br/>
dabble he dives right in.<br/>
My husband worries about the anger management issues for our son.  It is<br/>
quite scary when a 140 pounds 5&#39;9&quot; &quot;man&quot; is roaring and raging around the<br/>
place.  I have to say that I have noticed though that even when he appears<br/>
to be out of control these days (including fighting with one of his younger<br/>
brothers) he is not really completely out of control.  I have hopes that<br/>
eventually he will be able to stop himself from flying into a rage over<br/>
small frustrations.  It has taken my father about 60 or 70 years to start<br/>
doing this:(<br/>
