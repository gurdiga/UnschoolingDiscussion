 </span></blockquote>  That&#39;s an awesome idea...one that &quot;I&quot; would love. Maybe in my new <br/>
sewing/quilting room. How cool!<br/>
<br/>
  Speaking of quotes, I love to gather old frames from flea markets and yard <br/>
sales and write quotes in them and hang them around the house. Sometimes I <br/>
even write one or two sentences from a book that inspires me . And I purposely <br/>
choose ones that will &quot;inspire&quot; the rest of the family or get them to think <br/>
about things. Very tricky...hahahaha.<br/>
  <br/>
   I like to hang them in places where they will see them most often...while <br/>
on the phone, computer, doing laundry, dishes, etc. I even hang one in the <br/>
bathroom. And I change the quotes from time to time.<br/>
