I already know where my best creativity is manifest: in writing. I <br/>
love to write. I HAVE to write. and I want to write and make money <br/>
at it. I&#39;ve gone so far as checking out &quot;Wishcraft&quot; and some author <br/>
biographies and a WONDERFUL advice book by Carolyn See a fiction <br/>
author. <br/>
<br/>
And I get scared. I have this dream, and it&#39;s way up there, and <br/>
writing a thousand words per day is a daily goal in shooting for <br/>
that far away dream, and I read it and say &quot;bleh. who would want to <br/>
read this?&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s been said before&quot; and my dream fades.<br/>
<br/>
so I limit my writing to letters and discussion groups online. :(<br/>

over and paint over, and some don&#39;t paint over.   Some people write music and <br/>
then revise, and some keep the ideas in their heads until it comes out and STAYS <br/>
out the way it came out.   <br/>
<br/>
I figure school &quot;methods&quot; come from one theorist or teacher trying to get <br/>
people to learn his way, the way that worked for him and his (genetically <br/>
related) children and his favorite students.<br/>
<br/>
That method might work for a great majority of people, but it shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
taken to the bank as the One True Way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-665791661">I think it was Ray Bradbury that had the words &quot;Don&#39;t Think&quot; over his typewriter (both Zen + stops over editing).<br/>
<br/>
Also, there&#39;s a story about how hard it was for James Joyce to write.  His friend came by on day to find him poised over the typewriter immoble.  The friend (anyone remember who it was - it was another author) couldn&#39;t get Joyce to even acknowlege he was there.  So he left - came back a week later - Joyce was still poised over the t-writer as if he had not moved in 7 days.  THAT&#39;S editing in your head!<br/>
<br/>
Me, I find writing a bit like taking blood - once the needle is in and I&#39;ve started it works well, but hard to begin - fear of saying it &quot;BAD&quot;-ly.  So I moved on to the camera!<br/>

True.<br/>
<br/>
And I noticed (in my rough first draft, which I mailed to all&#39;o&#39;ya&#39;ll)<br/>
&quot;&gt; Writing advice is a danger,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an ambiguous phrase for sure!!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I meant to say &quot;Taking others&#39; advice about how writing works...&quot; but I opted <br/>
for three words instead of enough words! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.<br/>

The distance really helps to look at your work with fresh eyes.  And &quot;shitty<br/>
first drafts&quot; can usually be worked into pretty decent second drafts, which<br/>
can usually be worked into something pretty good eventually.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Then don&#39;t read it! Just keep writing until it starts to flow and feel<br/>
right. Then go back and when you&#39;ve got something more or less done, edit<br/>
and change and revise until it all feels good. Most authors do a *minimum*<br/>
of five drafts, so don&#39;t expect to get it right the first time, especially<br/>
if you&#39;re just starting out. I&#39;m on the eighth draft of my first novel right<br/>
now, and I&#39;m guessing number nine is going to be the one I send off. Just<br/>
keep at it, it does get easier!<br/>
If you want more inspiration, read Anne Lamott&#39;s book &quot;Bird by Bird&quot;. She<br/>
has an entire chapter called &quot;Sh*tty First Drafts&quot;. It&#39;s very cheering.<br/>
