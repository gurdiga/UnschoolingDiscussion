    I have a son named Jon that is 15 that would be interested in playing<br/>
online games. Right now he has been playing with his new Xbox Live. He also<br/>
sometimes plays Yu-Gi-Oh online. What games do your sons play? (I tried to<br/>

think she&#39;d get into Counterstrike, but wanted me to ask if anyone is <br/>
into Everquest on the playstation 2?  She&#39;d enjoy meeting up with other <br/>
unschoolers in Everquest. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477617923">I&#39;m sorry, other emails from the list did come through.  You could <br/>
try my other account <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:barbhas3@...">barbhas3@...</a>. Counterstrike is a pc <br/>
game that you can play online.  All three of mine play it but my <br/>
teen plays it the most.  They have maps like, the simpsons, wal-<br/>
mart, low gravity, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest also plays chess online.  He plays at cowplay.com and I <br/>
forget the name of the other site.  Cowplay is great because there <br/>
are a lot of international players.  <br/>
