   I think that everyone who read your post learned from it.  And you should <br/>
not blame yourself or feel guilty- not only are those emotions a waste of <br/>
time, but you must remember: When we know better, we do better.  I believe we <br/>
all come to this planet to help each other and each one of us has a special <br/>
purpose.  Maybe your beautiful daughter chose to come here to help you grow <br/>
and become stronger as a mother and a woman!  She is definitely an incredible <br/>
gift and I bet she has already taught you a lot.  Now you are sharing the <br/>
things you have learned and experienced with others!  Thank-you to you and <br/>
your child... Jackie</div>
