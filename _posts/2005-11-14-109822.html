I have a policy of not interferring in sibling conflict unless they ask for my help, or, more likely, come to complain about the sibling.  I find that most of the time they will work it out and adult intervention isn&#39;t particulary helpful.  When they do ask for my help, I usually make several suggestions to see if any of those are aggreable to both.  If after several suggestions neither is aggreable to solving the issue, I remove whatever the source fo the issue is until they come up with an idea.  As an example, if the dispute is over a game, this would be a common one at my house.  I would make several suggestions, like replay the turn, start a new game, have older kid &#39;show them how to get through the &#39;level&#39;, then give younger kid two turns, change to single player and alternate rather than compete etc...  If none of this works, then they just have to take a break from the game until they can solve it.  <br/>
Another frequent conflict is if they both want to use the same cd for the computer.  I just don&#39;t buy duplicate software:0)...sooo I will try to suggest a cool alternative so they are happy about taking turns.  Clue finders is popular at my house right now, so while one is playing clue finders I have a cool dvd for the other to watch, then they could switch.  Once in a while it just helps for themto have an afternoon apart.  In which case I let them each invite a friend over so they  play separately for a while.  Hope this helps.<br/>

We bought THREE of the most recent Harry Potter books. I bought one  <br/>
and two of my three kids bought their own. It isn&#39;t a sin to want  <br/>
your own copy of something.<br/>

<br/>
I do just the opposite.  I try to help them communicate before it&#39;s a<br/>
problem when I can see that they are having trouble working it out but<br/>
before they are totally p.o.ed with each other.  I help them to communicate<br/>
what it is that they each want and we brainstorm ideas to solve the conflict<br/>
together.  Oftentimes it&#39;s just a misunderstanding and it&#39;s easy to resolve.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is very cool to watch the girls work out their differences without my<br/>
help.  They usually listen to each other and make suggestions as to how to<br/>
work it out.  They learned to do this with my help.  <br/>
<br/>
I get very frustrated when children are fighting and no one steps up to help<br/>
them work it out.  I have seen things come to blows that could have been<br/>
nipped in the bud with a little help with communications.<br/>
<br/>
It works very well for us.  My kids rarely fight.  They are wonderful<br/>
friends to each other.  That doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t disagree sometimes<br/>
or hurt each other&#39;s feelings sometimes, but it really is not the norm here.<br/>

most of  the time they will work it out and adult intervention isn&#39;t particulary <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I had this policy, too, back when my two now-grown sons were small.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s one of most painful regrets in all of my parenting.  <br/>
 <br/>
The elder, most compliant and cooperative son was capable of much  <br/>
domineering behavior over his younger brother.  I didn&#39;t know it for many  years.  I <br/>
don&#39;t see how he could be blamed for recognizing and using that  power (bigger <br/>
and stronger and smarter) in the total ABSENCE of any kind of  parental input. I <br/>
am so ashamed of myself for allowing my younger son to even  *feel* <br/>
victimized and powerless over and over again, in a pattern, set up by my  &quot;rules&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
This policy FAILED my sons.  I have indisputable proof from their very  own <br/>
mouths about the effects this had on them.  Even the eldest knew what  he was <br/>
doing was wrong, and he shouldn&#39;t have had to feel that  self-loathing.  At the <br/>
very least my younger son shouldn&#39;t have been made  to feel powerless at the <br/>
hands of someone who was supposed to love him,  while his parents were <br/>
complicit in it.  <br/>
 <br/>
Kids DON&#39;T know how to work it out.  They NEED input from their  parents.  <br/>
You DON&#39;T know if they are all happy with the outcome of any spat  that you <br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;interfere&quot; in, because I guarantee you your kids are NOT  telling you <br/>
everything about how they feel.  This policy robs them of any  chance of <br/>
developing their own power, and they could really suffer from  it.  I hope you change <br/>
your policy.<br/>
