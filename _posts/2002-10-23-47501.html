&gt; OK, call me an idiot, but I just finally figured out what you guys are <br/>
&gt; talking about when you say &quot;google&quot; for something! LOL <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then why, after all this time, didn&#39;t you ask? It really isn&#39;t very funny. <br/>
Especially in light of another comment you make on a recent post. <br/>
<br/>
* Just because I don&#39;t read and say &quot;Oh, yes, I agree with you now&quot; does not <br/>
mean that I do not read or consider. I also fail to see how most any of these <br/>
conversations that take place here help unschoolers. Much more attention is <br/>
given to battling over views and values than is given to people asking <br/>
honestly for advice and help. A lot of them are just directed to websites and <br/>
message boards. <br/>
<br/>
Â We send people and each other to google and websites and message boards, <br/>
because sometimes the answer to a FAQ (that&#39;s frequently asked question) is <br/>
lodged somewhere in said web site or message board. Because sometimes, <br/>
someone has already answered said query with a wonderful, enlightening, essay <br/>
or message board post. Sometimes a whole web site may be devoted to a <br/>
particular subject! (wonder of wonders!!!) We send people to other places so <br/>
they know the information about unschooling isn&#39;t coming just from us, (a <br/>
kind of biassed group) but comes from many people, all over the world with <br/>
great views on children and life. Because we have posted and posted on a <br/>
subject and someone just doesn&#39;t seem to get it, so we send them to other web <br/>
sites and boards to try and help them clear their confusion. Trust me, it <br/>
doesn&#39;t always work!<br/>

  Then why, after all this time, didn&#39;t you ask? <br/>
<br/>
  ** Because it hasn&#39;t been anything I needed to know. I&#39;m patient, I know eventually someone will say something or I&#39;ll see something and figure it out. If I don&#39;t, and think I need to know, I&#39;ll ask. I knew it had to do with looking things up, but didn&#39;t know if it was just a way to say &quot;look into it&quot; or if it was something more specific. In this case, I saw an ad for it on a website, and followed the link to check it out. Then I looked at my favorite search engine (Dogpile) and found that Google is one of the sites it pulls from. <br/>

buncha 0&#39;s.  A hundred or something like that.  So I do, in fact, appreciate<br/>
the clarification.  I haven&#39;t been getting enough sleep, I think.<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;google is a number&quot; is stated as though there&#39;s only one definition of<br/>
the thing.  But it&#39;s also a search engine, as we all are reminded quite<br/>
regularly by the queen of Google, Sandra!  Hey, Sandra -- does Google pay<br/>
