Kathryn,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the reply and wise reminder. I&#39;m not really sure why I <br/>
said that about &#39;undermining&#39;. It&#39;s not at all what our relationship <br/>
as co-parents has been about. I think that at the moment I was just <br/>
feeling a little resentment about feeling railroaded into a <br/>
particular regimen. You are absolutely right. Communication is the <br/>
key. Thanks.</div>
