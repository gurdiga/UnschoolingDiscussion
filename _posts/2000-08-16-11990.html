<div id="ygrps-yiv-162677513">What makes me really cringe is to see some poor child walking around with a <br/>
swollen belly due to hunger, and bugs crawling all over his/her face, and <br/>
then have some person try to tell me that there should be more children in <br/>
this situation.  What makes me sick is when people on TV try to tell me to <br/>
help save that child, feed, clothe, and give the child medical care, when it <br/>
is all I can do to feed my one and only child.   I think that the people who <br/>
want abortion outlawed should have to adopt each and every child who is <br/>
unwanted, that is the only way that I would ever agree to it.  My husband is <br/>
a detective with a police department in a major city.  He also happens to be <br/>
with the child abuse division.  There are literally millions of children <br/>
within each and every city that are abused and neglected because the parents <br/>
do not want them!   Give me one good and logical reason we should add to <br/>
these atrocities!  Look at all the unwanted orphans in places like Albania!  <br/>
They sit in orphanages, unwanted and unloved, until they become so disturbed <br/>
that they attempt murder at the ripe old age of 2 or 3 years!  That makes me <br/>
a lot sicker than someone who terminates a pregnancy before they have the <br/>
chance to destroy yet another human being.  Then, as if that is not enough, <br/>
look at how over populated and polluted the earth is!!!!  My greatest wish is <br/>
that the people who put so much passion in to pro-life movement, put as much <br/>
effort and passion in to improving the world (families, hate, violence, child <br/>
abuse, pollution, etc.) before bringing more babies into it and before yet <br/>
another life is destroyed (after being born).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332255537">I agree on many points Amy has brought up (adoption from other countries and <br/>
tons of abuse in our country), but I don&#39;t believe abortion is the answer to <br/>
over-population or the solution to not wanting a baby ....(this is going to <br/>
sound crude and there are exceptions to everything) but I have a huge problem <br/>
with women using abortion as a means of birth control.  If they aren&#39;t ready <br/>
to be a parent, use birth control or keep their legs shut!  These tiny baby&#39;s <br/>
did NOTHING to deserve been flushed out of there safe home.  They did not <br/>
asked to be conceived.  There are a lot of parents who want infants to adopt, <br/>
but few women are willing to make the sacrifices needed for the nine months <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021091142">Many things need to be done for this world to be truly fit for <br/>
human (and every other creature&#39;s) habitation.  I agree that there <br/>
are other, much more natural methods of maiking sure the humans <br/>
don&#39;t plunder the Earth and spoil it for the rest of life, like the <br/>
encouragement of a return to natural breastfeeding, as effective a <br/>
contraceptive as anything else, for the first 6 months at least, and <br/>
for most people, much longer. <br/>
<br/>
As someone who chose to abort a pregnancy after the father <br/>
withdrew his support, I disagree with the comment about keeping <br/>
one&#39;s legs shut.  I believed that a child needs a mother and a <br/>
mother needs a supportive partner, and still do believe this, and so <br/>
I released the child&#39;s spirit before more damage was done to it.  <br/>
And since I believe that we choose our own lives, and our own <br/>
parents, I must disagree with the comment that the child did not <br/>
ask to be conceived.  If you prefer to believe that the body we <br/>
inhabit is not of our choosing, that is your right.  For those who are <br/>
interested in another pov, there&#39;s a poem here that I like, and may <br/>
be comforting to someone faced with the difficult decision of <br/>
continuing or not with a pregnancy.  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yoni.com/motherf/unbornchild.shtml">http://www.yoni.com/motherf/unbornchild.shtml</a><br/>
<br/>
One of my pet peeves is assumptions about other women&#39;s <br/>
choices.  I had chosen to become part of a family, with a partner <br/>
and child.  My partner chose otherwise, and so I chose once <br/>
more, to not inflict the life I would have led on my child and <br/>
myself.<br/>
<br/>
Yours thoughtfully<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140388218">Hi David. I was thinking about this very question as I typed:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; While I am close to your view on abortion, are you sure you don&#39;t<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your supposition that I would state abortion is different since it is a<br/>
&quot;victimless crime&quot; is close. The &quot;victim&quot; factor in an abortion cannot be<br/>
measured without some level of spiritual bias, since the very<br/>
nature/definition of the victim is in question. However, in a rape or murder<br/>
where the victim is a person whom is unquestionably sentient and<br/>
alive-irregardless of personal beliefs, the crime clearly has a victim.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Even for these other crimes, the legislation of morality is complex.<br/>

&gt; intriguing issues.  But clearly ones I&#39;d hope we&#39;d legislate.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Excellent points.  It would be foolish of me to think there is any<br/>
legislation in existence which is not based on morality of some sort, but in<br/>
these cases the ethic of &quot;the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the<br/>
few&quot; seems to guide what legislation takes place.  As soon as humans began<br/>
to live in societies of significant numbers, certain necessary &quot;rules&quot;<br/>
became evident to ensure the safety of the civilization and individual<br/>
property rights. Let&#39;s be harsh for a moment, and say: since unborn babies<br/>
are not yet &quot;property&quot;, but the woman carrying the child is, her welfare<br/>
overrides the potential real estate inside her womb.  I suppose this leads<br/>
me to argue that making abortion illegal doesn&#39;t serve the purpose of<br/>
ensuring the safety of the civilization, people and property at large in the<br/>
U.S.-excepting in a purely long distance survival/future shock sort of way.<br/>
Given the world population dilemma, this is not something which is much of a<br/>
concern right now.<br/>
<br/>
To those reading-I use the term &quot;property&quot; in the most abstract sense.  I in<br/>
no way consider babies or women property, but truly they were considered so<br/>
in the past, and unfortunately are still in some cultures. (Strangely,<br/>
probably in those cultures which do not allow abortion.)<br/>
<br/>
All that above said, I know I would be a horrible Justice of the Peace,<br/>
since I decide most everything on a case by case standard. I have never<br/>
heard of or experienced any life rules of conduct, no matter how black or<br/>
white, that don&#39;t have an exception.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-407924290">Well, this is a two way street.  Yes, more women should take responsibility<br/>
for their actions, however, the resulting life should not be punished<br/>
because someone thinks they should be forced to have that unwanted child. <br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a perfect world and no one has the right to make moral decisions<br/>
for someone else.  If the pro-lifers have their way there will be many<br/>
deaths from back alley abortions.  There will also be instances of women<br/>
having to go to term and then delivering terminally deformed or dead<br/>
fetuses.  We had several cases of fetuses that were not complete and would<br/>
have continued to term but would have &quot;died&quot; shortly after birth and would<br/>
have only lived that short time on machines.<br/>
<br/>
I had the misfortune of working in the radiology department of a large<br/>
hospital.  All the child abuse cases came through our department as the law<br/>
required full body x-rays to be done to check for prior injuries.  While<br/>
some of you may express the sentiments that you would rather be abused than<br/>
aborted, I&#39;m sure there are others that would disagree.  I&#39;m sure the child<br/>
we came to know as &quot;Sunny&quot; would have preferred not to be born than to have<br/>
cigerettes put out on his little legs; than to have needles broken off<br/>
under his fingernails; than to be thrown through a window and left outside<br/>
all night; than to be later returned to his parents because they were<br/>
&quot;cured&quot; after counseling.  Did I mention that &quot;Sunny&quot; was 11 months old and<br/>
that we were all threatened with jail because we faked continuing medical<br/>
problems and kept him in the hospital for 3 extra months.  Oh, in case I<br/>
forgot to mention it, 6 weeks after we were forced to release him from the<br/>
hospital to his parents, he was dead.  AND, at the trial, the mother was<br/>
heard to say &quot;See, if I&#39;d had that abortion we wouldn&#39;t be going to jail<br/>
now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can give you lots more of those kind of cases that I personally<br/>
witnessed.<br/>
