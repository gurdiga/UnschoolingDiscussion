<div id="ygrps-yiv-608496491">Hi Julie!<br/>
I just read your posts and wanted to say thank you for sharing them <br/>
with all of us. I too would like to be straight forward with people <br/>
about how my children learn, so that they can learn how natural and <br/>
joyful it can be.<br/>
 <br/>
At my children&#39;s evaluations this year, we just brought the <br/>
accordion folder full of things we had collected throughout the year <br/>
and a book list. The evaluator knows us from being in the same group <br/>
activities, but I haven&#39;t ever announced, &quot;We unschool&quot;. I have <br/>
answered questions about curriculum with, &quot;We don&#39;t use any. We just <br/>
follow whatever their interests are.&quot; Anyway, she was able to see <br/>
the progress, but I really like the idea of a narrative to tie it <br/>
all together. <br/>
<br/>
At my 13yo son&#39;s eval. last year, he was surprised by what he had <br/>
done throughout the year too. He was only looking at the things we <br/>
had saved: drawings, pictures, ticket stubs, directions for <br/>
experiments, recipes, etc. This year he decided to take a <br/>
standardized test, to assure himself he was learning. If I could <br/>
verbalize, or keep a narrative record to show him, maybe he wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have those doubts. <br/>
<br/>
If you wouldn&#39;t mind, I would love to see any/all of the narratives <br/>
you wrote to give me some inspiration. You could e-mail them to me <br/>
privately. Thanks again for sharing!<br/>
<br/>
Deanne</div>
