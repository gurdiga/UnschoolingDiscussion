<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312154607">Wow! What a great site!<br/>
The kids and I have been listening to the local bird calls (at the site) for<br/>
the past 1/2 hour.<br/>
I&#39;ll definitely put this in my favorites. :-) I am amazed at the resources<br/>
available to us, at our fingertips.<br/>
Thanks for sharing this website.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I heard a woman today, while at the kids gymnastics, talking about <br/>
how she always chooses books for her children over the computer to <br/>
learn about things.  She liked to do things the old fashion way, and <br/>
had strong beliefs about the value of book learning.  I kept my mouth <br/>
shut because I was just sitting there and not really involved in the <br/>
conversation, but I couldn&#39;t believe the attitude.   All of the <br/>
wonderful computer programs and internet information we have at our <br/>
finger tips.  I am still in awe of it.  I can&#39;t imagine limiting it <br/>
or looking down upon it.<br/>
