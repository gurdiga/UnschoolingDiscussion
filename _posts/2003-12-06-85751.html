Definitely mail it.  Also, put his name and age in the return address on the<br/>
envelope.  That will increase the chances of it getting to the &quot;right&quot;<br/>
person in the office who likes to deal with kids&#39; letters.  It&#39;s Hershey -<br/>
I&#39;m sure they do get mail from kids pretty regularly and they may even have<br/>
a PR protocol for how to respond.  You may even address it to the R & D<br/>
department.  What have you got to lose?  -besides the cost of a stamp: )<br/>

Hershey is cool. They were the major leaders in the change to end modern <br/>
slavery in chocolate production. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Hershey Foods Corp., the nation&#39;s largest chocolate-maker, says it is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;shocked&quot; and &quot;deeply concerned&quot; that its products, such as Hershey&#39;s Kisses, <br/>
Nuggets, Hershey chocolate bars and Reese&#39;s Peanut Butter Cups, may be made with <br/>
cocoa produced by child slaves. The company, which has a long history of <br/>
involvement with children, says it is deeply embarrassed by revelations of indirect <br/>
involvement with child slavery. (Hershey Foods, which has a market <br/>
capitalization on Wall Street of $8.4 billion, is affiliated with a school for orphaned <br/>
and disadvantaged children, established in 1909 by company founder Milton S. <br/>
Hershey and his wife Catherine.)&lt;&lt;<br/>
