<div id="ygrps-yiv-573891563">We&#39;ve been unschooling with curriculum for four years.  (My oldest <br/>
just turned 12 and has been home since the end of second grade in <br/>
ps.)  We have the books, etc. and she is free to use or not use them <br/>
as she desires.  There are times when she pours through them for <br/>
days then she may drop them for months only to pour through them <br/>
again, etc.  As with any child, adult, human, etc....she has <br/>
strenghts and weaknesses, for lack of a better term.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been quite confident in her and myself for the past few <br/>
years, but now, for some reason, I find my fears and doubts <br/>
swallowing me.  My husband is pushing for her to return to ps, which <br/>
has her mind racing with the idea.  She rarely brings up returning, <br/>
but when she does, I find myself nervous.  She is extremely mature, <br/>
responsible and bright, however she is behind in certain areas, as <br/>
far as ps standards go.  Just in the past six months, I have watched <br/>
her flourish as a writer, take responsibility for and set her own <br/>
daily rhythm and become quite a young lady.  <br/>
<br/>
As the oldest of seven, with the next in line being 5 years younger, <br/>
she has struggled with her relationship with her siblings, often <br/>
feeling left out because they are all so young.  With the birth of <br/>
our last child 6 months ago, to whom she has a strong bond, she has <br/>
blossomed as the big sister....I often catch her reading them books, <br/>
teaching them to read or count...or just loving them in the sweetest <br/>
of ways.  When most children her age are heading into the often <br/>
dreaded teen years, our daughter has become an absolute pleasure to <br/>
be around.  It pains me to think of losing these daily moments with <br/>
her.  <br/>
<br/>
At this point, I am not facing the struggle of letting her go to ps, <br/>
but the older she gets, the more leary my husband becomes of <br/>
homeschooling.  He is fine with the elementary years but thinks the <br/>
peer relationships of ps are so important...no matter how I explain <br/>
my views, he butts heads with me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure where I am going with this and apologize for the <br/>
length.  I guess I am looking for reassurance or direction?  It is <br/>
so easy to relax when they are ahead and flying, but I don&#39;t often <br/>
hear about those who fall behind here or there.  I&#39;ve been online <br/>
all night trying to find some gem of information but I am coming up <br/>
emtpy.  I suppose my biggest fear is the day she really does want to <br/>
go back to ps (if that day comes) and the thought of having to tell <br/>
her she isn&#39;t on grade level in some areas and in others she would <br/>
face the possibility of boredom.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to your thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Warm Wishes,<br/>

  Most kids are not on &quot;grade level&quot; - don&#39;t worry so much about it. I <br/>
know quite a few kids who have gone to high school after unschooling <br/>
for all their younger years. They have varied reasons for it. Most are <br/>
kids whose parents thought they were &quot;behind&quot; grade level. Sometimes <br/>
the first year - they weren&#39;t ready for the most advanced stuff. But, <br/>
when kids enter high school - there is lots of variation in kids&#39; <br/>
abilities - little retention - and they teach the same stuff over that <br/>
the kids had already been taught in earlier grades.<br/>
<br/>
There are sometimes some funny things that the previously-unschooled <br/>
kids don&#39;t &#39;get&quot; at first - but they catch on very quickly. For <br/>
example, one kid I know had to do a paper for her combination <br/>
history/english class - it was to be a diary entry as if she was a girl <br/>
traveling in a wagon train. They couldn&#39;t type it because &quot;they didn&#39;t <br/>
have typewriters then.&quot; She turned her paper in and the teacher <br/>
returned it because it was not stapled - she was told to staple it and <br/>
turn it in the next day (marked down for being one day late). The girl <br/>
said, &quot;But they didn&#39;t have staples then,&quot; and got marked down extra <br/>
for insubordination. The hardest thing about going to school, for these <br/>
kids, is that kind of nonsense and not being able to speak directly to <br/>
adults without it being called insubordination.<br/>

Jennifer:<br/>
<br/>
Let me ditto Pam&#39;s reply.  I am doing some contract work right now <br/>
for an educational testing company, scoring proficiency tests for <br/>
different states.  What an eye opener!  Lately we&#39;ve been doing 8th <br/>
and 10th grade tests.  If you think your child is not on &quot;grade <br/>
level&quot; you should see what I am seeing, every day, about 900 to 1500 <br/>
times a day, from all over the country.  There are very, very few who <br/>
actually are working up to the level set out by institutionalized <br/>
learning &quot;experts.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
And just what does that mean anyway?  The rubrics that we must use to <br/>
score many of these questions actually punish the creative or out-of-<br/>
the-box thinker.  Bill Gates or Einstein would not have done well on <br/>
many parts of these tests.  Time and again we lowly test-scorers ask <br/>
why we have to score a zero for a kid when we can clearly see that <br/>
this child&#39;s answer is well-written, logical, appropriate, but does <br/>
not fit the pre-determined rubric set by the person who wrote the <br/>
question and the committee he or she used to refine the rubric for <br/>
exactly what they want the child to answer, not what might be an <br/>
equally good response.  No leeway.  The test scorers are constantly <br/>
being tested themselves and called on the carpet for any variation <br/>
from the percentages that the test designers want.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not allowed to say much more due to contractual secrecy, but you <br/>
will find much of the same type of information in the book, THE BIG <br/>
TEST: THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN MERITOCRACY by Nicholas <br/>
Lemann. Here&#39;s a web site where you can read more about this book <br/>
(read an excerpt, reviews, even take a test): <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.the-big-test.com/">http://www.the-big-test.com/</a> <br/>
<br/>
After I read this book I chose to accept a temporary contract job in <br/>
this field. I&#39;m a true unschooler myself, wanting to learn hands-on <br/>
whenever possible.  Wanted to see from the inside what was really <br/>
going on, since so many put so much credence in testing.  Believe me, <br/>
my eyes have been opened. <br/>
<br/>
The most important eye-opener was what I experienced while training <br/>
for this job.  We have to learn these rubrics and are tested, over <br/>
and over again, to be sure we have learned them the way the state <br/>
wants them learned.  I quickly felt the elation that comes with a 90% <br/>
or 100% score on these tests.  I was thoroughly programmed for this <br/>
and surprised that it never leaves you once the programming takes, no <br/>
matter how much we intellectually disagree with it.  And then came <br/>
the depression, self-doubt and loss of self-confidence that comes <br/>
when I found myself scoring 40%, 50% or 60% on some of these <br/>
rubrics.  I quickly realized that if this could happen to me in less <br/>
than one hour, then think of the cumulative impact it must have on <br/>
all the poor kids who are forced to do this, who spend every day and <br/>
every week being &quot;graded,&quot; being told how good they are, or how bad <br/>
they are, at everything they do.  This is the real poison of all <br/>
testing and of setting up parameters for &quot;grade level work.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
My advice:  stay away from anything that tries to put your child in a <br/>
box.  There is so much more to learning than some make-believe grade <br/>
level created by some ego-maniacal academic, or group of academics.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279495125">This was really interesting, Norma. Thanks for posting about your <br/>
experience - especially about the impact on you, personally, when you <br/>
were scored, yourself, on how well your score the test. Fascinating!!! <br/>
It is really something to remember, how POWERFUL that experience can be.<br/>

he means by peer relationships and how that gets fostered in school.  On one<br/>
list, somebody posted that they had decided their kids need socialization so<br/>
they took them into the bathroom once a week and beat them up for their<br/>
lunch money.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Seriously, he probably hasn&#39;t thought about what he means by peer<br/>
relationships.  (I&#39;m assuming your daughter has at least *some* peer<br/>
relationships.)  People mean such different things when they ask about<br/>
socialization.  To some it means learning to follow rules, which<br/>
homeschoolers also do.  To some it means having friendships, which<br/>
homeschoolers also do.  To some it means learning to sit down, shut up, and<br/>
do what you&#39;re told without thinking.  I doubt this is what your husband<br/>
wants for her, but she *would* learn it (or learn to completely rebel<br/>
against it) in school.  You might also ask him how many friends he&#39;s still<br/>
in touch with from high school.  From what I can tell, most people haven&#39;t<br/>
kept many or even some of those friendships unless they grew up in a small<br/>
town and stayed there.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s the tricky part.  I *try* not to butt heads because what he says just <br/>
makes me insane and since I need every ounce of sanity I can muster on a <br/>
daily basis &gt;snicker&lt; I usually don&#39;t argue.  Besides, I think he is <br/>
beginning to enjoy the clash.  He thinks she needs to be around bad <br/>
situations to learn how to deal with them.  He isn&#39;t concerned about <br/>
fostering friendships (at least from what I can glean from his spoutings, <br/>
because she does have close friendships).  He is concerned about her being <br/>
faced with drug use, bullying, etc. and not being able to handle it.  He <br/>
thinks she SHOULD be faced with those things!  I take a completely different <br/>
road.  My goodness, she is only 12!  I *was* faced with those things at 12 <br/>
and I can tell you no good came from those experiences.  I&#39;d give anything <br/>
had I had more guidance and protection! He doesn&#39;t have ONE friend from <br/>
school anymore and often tells me how much he hated school...how he joined <br/>
co-op to avoid it.  Occasionaly I may hear how she needs to be able to be a <br/>
cheerleader or join band or just have 800 kids to choose friends from.  Last <br/>
night it was the &#39;on level&#39; thing.  Those arguements aren&#39;t even worth <br/>
starting because he won&#39;t even listen to HER when she says she isn&#39;t <br/>
interested in those things!  Cheerleading is the last interest on her list <br/>
and she is a self taught guitar player...not even possible in ps here <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I were raised in abusive homes.  We saw and were exposed to <br/>
just about all of it.  I came out wanting nothing remotely like that for my <br/>
children, he came out feeling like there&#39;s always someone worse off.  I <br/>
digress...<br/>
<br/>
Ususally, I am able to appease his *concerns* (sorry if the emphasis of that <br/>
was rude) by nodding my head and keeping quiet, but now that she is getting <br/>
older and finding her niche in different areas (she loves skateboarding and <br/>
punk music) he thinks she needs to be in the masses.  I keep my eyes wide <br/>
open and censor, which he also thinks is rediculous.  He thinks she is smart <br/>
enough to avoid or ignore bad things, I, on the other hand feel as if she is <br/>
constantly exposed, she will become desensitized and find it easier to go <br/>
with the crowd.  She has always been a silent leader in negative situations, <br/>
she doesn&#39;t join in, but she won&#39;t leave or speak out either, which concerns <br/>
me.  I feel like we are still in the stage of laying down our morals and <br/>
beliefs and I see my cousins, who are in ps, being sooo influenced by their <br/>
peers.  In a homeschool setting, I am able to monitor situations more <br/>
closely and gently offer my guidance without being overbearing or nosy.  <br/>
From what I have experienced myself, and seen in others, it is near <br/>
impossible to do that when your child is away 9 hours a day.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well you&#39;ve probably heard here about my son who only learned to read &gt;when<br/>
&gt;he was 12.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I actually just joined the group last night, so I hadn&#39;t read this yet, but <br/>
I have heard similar stories and it does help to ease my anxiety and fears.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I asked a teacher once how many kids in the average grade 4 class &gt;(what my<br/>
&gt;son would have been in at the time if he went to school) were at grade <br/>

&gt;Some would be behind in everything.  And the others would be ahead in &gt;some<br/>
&gt;things and behind in others.<br/>
&gt;Tia<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is inspiring!  Just goes to show that the *system* isn&#39;t always right.  <br/>
I suppose I knew this, but it is so easy to forget.  I come from a family <br/>
with many teachers and the pressure can really be overwhelming at times.  I <br/>
muster up all my strength and hold my head high because I also hear my <br/>
family tell me how well behaved my children are, how much they love to <br/>
learn, etc.  My grandmother came by Thursday to go with us to park day with <br/>
our local support group.  It was raining and no one was there, so she asked <br/>
the kids if they wanted to go to McD&#39;s and play inside.  Not one did.  THey <br/>
wanted to go to the book store instead.  She said she&#39;d never heard a child <br/>
(much less 6..little one is too young to speak up) refuse McDonalds play for <br/>
a book!  As a mother, as a life learner, those words were priceless. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all of your wisdom, I have a hard time shutting up but this <br/>
has sparked my fires!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736803873">Wow Kristen, you must be a fly on my wall!  I feel the same way!  It IS harsh, and in my opinion, quite crazy!  I think I&#39;ll heed Betsy&#39;s advice and try to get stories out of him of *his* childhood in ps.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much, I&#39;m loving this list already!<br/>

This is not meant as harshly as it sounds, but I&#39;ve heard this so many times I wonder if a wake up call isn&#39;t in order.<br/>
<br/>
How far does he want to go to &quot;expose&quot; her to bad things so she can deal with them.<br/>
<br/>
Jail exists.  And *maybe* she&#39;ll land in jail and will have to learn to deal with it someday.<br/>
<br/>
Would he send her to jail in order to learn how to cope with it?  (She would learn all about the things he is concerned about there too).  But is it a good idea?  Of course not.<br/>
