Thanks Eileen,<br/>
<br/>
Right now we are agonizing over what to do to help our<br/>
son, and the rest of the family, function on a daily<br/>
basis.  The last few weeks have been terrible.  He<br/>
seems to have almost no impulse control and every<br/>
emotion he has is the depths of despair or the<br/>
pinnacle of joy.  He throws himself to the floor<br/>
crying if he does not get his way or gets frustrated. <br/>
He jumps and shouts for joy at his small successes. <br/>
He does not have the patience to do simple puzzles,<br/>
color, draw, show any interest in letters, or anything<br/>
else most kids know at his age.  <br/>
<br/>
I am concerned about him lacking the ability<br/>
physically/mentally to control himself enough to<br/>
function at the level we are expecting him to.  He<br/>
KNOWS when he is doing something wrong or<br/>
innappropriate, but he seems unable to stop himself. <br/>
He will grab toys from his brother, hit or scream when<br/>
he is upset, throws tantrums at least a dozen times a<br/>
day and blows evertyhing hugely out of proportion.  <br/>
<br/>
He throws crying fits often, when he lacks the<br/>
patience or the ability to slow down enough to solve<br/>
problems.  Yesterday it was how to put his trike away<br/>
with hands full of toys.  I suggested maybe he should<br/>
get on his trike and put his things in the bag on the<br/>
hadlebars so that he could steer, as he was trying to<br/>
push it from behind, with poor results.  He refused,<br/>
stomped his feet, screamed in agony, fell to the<br/>
pavement and eventually ran screaming to his room (all<br/>
in the span of about a minute) when he could not get<br/>
the trike to go where he wanted it to.  He later shows<br/>
remorse and guilt over his misbehaviors, and shows a<br/>
complete understanding of what he was doing that was<br/>
wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
I hate watching him go through this, and on top of<br/>
that he is DRIVING ME BUGGY!!  I am ready to run away<br/>
from home!  I am not sure what to do with him, and a<br/>
good friend thinks he needs ritalin to help him get<br/>
some impulse control.  I don&#39;t want to do that, even<br/>
temporarily, if I don&#39;t have to.  There is the<br/>
possibility of chemical problems, but we are not sure<br/>
what.  I am hypoglycemic (and have been reading the<br/>
Barley Juice info with interest) and tend towards<br/>
depression.  Thomas bio father was an alcoholic and<br/>
drug abuser (my ex), and his parents abused cocaine. <br/>
So there is a possibility that those things are in<br/>
turn affecting Thomas.  He also has multiple allergies<br/>
and I worry that it might be something we have not yet<br/>
discovered in his diet or environment that is causing<br/>
problems for him.  Any ideas or suggestions? <br/>
Elimination diets we have thought of, and are<br/>
considering, but they would be really hard with all<br/>
his existing allergies, not to mention the difficulty<br/>
of getting preschool age kids to eat different things.<br/>
<br/>
By the way Eileen, Thomas is underweight too.  He has<br/>
always been really thin and wirey, and at age 2 he<br/>
fell somewhere below zero on growth average charts. <br/>
Now he averages about 10-20th percentage of average,<br/>
and his LARGE baby brother is bigger than him.  We<br/>
were very lucky to be able to find carseats and<br/>
strollers that we were able to keep him in.<br/>

<br/>
There are now doing and some have been completed that indicate that FAS is<br/>
not just a maternal thing, that the sperm is also effected by chemical<br/>
dependency/abuse.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that he has one thing under control that is usually something that<br/>
has to be taught--going to a quiet/safe space (his room) to desensitize and<br/>
then coming back to the rest of the family.  The steps taken at the rehab<br/>
center I worked at started there and then worked with the kids to go to<br/>
their &quot;safe&quot; space when they felt the frustration coming on.<br/>
<br/>
One of our patients had drown and as an after effect every little thing<br/>
threw him into a tizzy.  They worked with him for about 6 months to get him<br/>
to where your little guy is and then another six months for him to recognize<br/>
when he was pre-temper tantrum stage.  He was about 6 and really cute.<br/>
After he learned to recognize that stage, he would, in his most little adult<br/>
voice, say &quot;Excuse me, my brains are too busy.  I&#39;m going to regroup.&quot;  Then<br/>
he would go off to our &quot;safe&quot; room (I think I explained about the colors,<br/>
textures and no harsh lines thingy on this list before) and listen to music.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that struck me that you said &quot;at the level we are expecting him<br/>
to&quot; is something we told parents to throw out the window.  The rule was no<br/>
expectations.  Look at where the child is and work to move forward from<br/>
there.  No yardsticks, no comparisions.  Once parents grasped that concept,<br/>
quite frequently both they and the child made tremendous progress because<br/>
the need to make it to level &quot;x, y or z&quot; was removed, thus the stress level<br/>
was removed.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t give up, it does get better!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118047828"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;There are now doing and some have been completed that<br/>
&gt;indicate that FAS is not just a maternal thing, that<br/>
&gt;the sperm is also effected by chemical<br/>
&gt;dependency/abuse.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes I know, which is why I mentioned the paternal<br/>
possibilities.  It worries me, and makes me angry with<br/>
myself.  But I came from an alcoholic and abusive home<br/>
and the fact that I left my ex and married my husband<br/>
at all are miracles I think.  I left him when I was 2<br/>
months pregnant and the realities of trying to parent<br/>
a child with him, or even near him, hit me in the<br/>
face.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I had been coworkers for over 2 years<br/>
at that point and he was recently (less than a year)<br/>
divorced from his chemically dependent, abusive ex. <br/>
We just sort of fell into each other and were married<br/>
a few months later.  He did birthing classes with me<br/>
and was my coach and everything.  He was very excited<br/>
and very ready to parent.  We decided to put his name<br/>
on the birth certificate, since my ex told me numerous<br/>
times to &quot;get rid of it&quot; with regards to the baby.  My<br/>
husbands name is Thomas and it was his idea to name<br/>
our eldest after his side of the family (5 Toms in a<br/>
direct line).  He is a wonderful father, and I am<br/>
extremely lucky.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It seems that he has one thing under control that is<br/>
&gt;usually something that has to be taught--going to a<br/>
&gt;quiet/safe space (his room) to desensitize and<br/>
&gt;then coming back to the rest of the family.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes this is something we taught him early on, and<br/>
recently in the last 6 months, he has begun to self<br/>
implement it and not have to be told when it is time<br/>
for some quiet time.  He will say, &quot;I&#39;m just goin&#39; to<br/>
my room!&quot;  and we will say &quot;Good Idea!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;One thing that struck me that you said &quot;at the level<br/>
&gt;we are expecting him to&quot; is something we told parents<br/>
&gt;to throw out the window.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I meant by that was behavior wise and not<br/>
academics or anything.  We put no pressure on him to<br/>
perform anything along the &quot;schoolish&quot; lines of<br/>
course.  But I see what you mean as applied to<br/>
behavior.  I do not however, think that his<br/>
expectations are unreasonable for his particular case.<br/>
 His expectations are:<br/>
<br/>
1 - to ask politely for things and not demand or<br/>
order.  When he does we simply give him the arched<br/>
brow look, or say &quot;excuse me?&quot; or &quot;Could you ask that<br/>
again?&quot;  He knows the drill and responds &quot;May I<br/>
please...bla bla&quot;  rather than Gimmee!<br/>
<br/>
2 - Do not express your displeasure by screaming at or<br/>
hurting anyone in the family.  If he does, he is asked<br/>
to please go to his room until he is ready to be<br/>
around other people again. <br/>
<br/>
3 - The potty thing.  He knows when he has to go, he<br/>
has absolute control that I have seen him display on<br/>
numerous occassions.  He is just resistant, and/or<br/>
lacks the impulse control and attention span to stop<br/>
what he is doing to go to the bathroom.  He was going<br/>
from standing at the bathroom door, clear upstairs to<br/>
his room to pee his pants and hide them at one point.<br/>
<br/>
This week I have implemented a new strategy.  I set a<br/>
timer and every 15 to 20 minutes (I swear he has the<br/>
bladder capacity of a mouse) I remind him to go to the<br/>
bathroom, not optional.  He pees every single time,<br/>
and it prevents the &quot;accidents&quot; that we were having<br/>
completely.  He likes me to make a big fuss over him<br/>
when he goes, so I do.  He is feeling great about<br/>
himself and being able to go a whole day with dry<br/>
pants.  Now we just have to get over his resistance to<br/>
pooping in the potty, which he has yet to do.  He says<br/>
he is scared.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot for all the encouragement though, Lynda. <br/>
I do appreciate it.  I am thinking that this is more<br/>
chemical related than diet related.  As his diet<br/>
cycles through various likes and passions and there<br/>
seems to be no appreciable difference in his behavior<br/>
when he is focused on a very small menu for a while,<br/>
or when he chages gears and moves on to something<br/>
else.  He really loves baked beans though.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-703735204">Mr. Rogers actually did one of his shows about this,<br/>
so it must be pretty common.  He seemed to feel that<br/>
children had two fears:  they fear they could fall in<br/>
and get flushed down themselves AND they feel that<br/>
their poop is part of themselves and that in flushing<br/>
it away they are somehow flushing away part of<br/>
themselves (which connects again to the first fear, I<br/>
imagine).  I don&#39;t remember an awful lot about the<br/>
show, but I remember that it involved talking about<br/>
these fears, telling them how poop is made, giving the<br/>
child a lot of calming talk about what happens to the<br/>
poop when it is flushed, giving the child lots of<br/>
opportunity to flush the toilet themselves,<br/>
demonstrating how things that are smaller than<br/>
themselves are still too big to go down the toilet...<br/>
<br/>
I wrote a book and illustrated with cartoon pictures<br/>
of my son when he was potty training... it seemed to<br/>
really help him with certain potty issues he was<br/>
having, and he was thrilled to have his own book about<br/>
it.  That might help your child...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111715306">Your son sounds like mine in many ways.  We got quite<br/>
a bit of help from our chiropractor, who is also a<br/>
nutritionist, homeopathist, ND who uses kinesiology. <br/>
The biggest help she gave us was telling us what foods<br/>
he was sensitive to... eliminating corn (corn starch<br/>
and syrup was the most difficult to do), dairy, and<br/>
wheat did him a lot of good... eliminated the constant<br/>
ear infections and helped him with impulse control a<br/>
great deal.  Bach flower essences have helped a bit on<br/>
occasion, as has homeopathy, but I&#39;d say the food<br/>
elimination was the most significant thing.  It didn&#39;t<br/>
solve the problems completely, but it sure kept the<br/>
family sane, and helped my son considerably.  The<br/>
other thing we did was use the book &#39;Holding Time&#39;<br/>
when our son was two... if you can use it now, I&#39;d<br/>
highly recommend it.  It was really hard on us,<br/>
because our son was *extremely* touch aversive, so he<br/>
never relaxed into it the way they describe, but we<br/>
saw *huge* improvements after two weeks of treatment. <br/>
After a couple months we stopped using it regularly,<br/>
and only used it when he seemed to spiral out of<br/>
control of himself, it really seemed to help him get<br/>
grounded and centered.<br/>
<br/>
That is the hard thing, but invaluable, I think... to<br/>
help your son learn to recognize his own feelings of<br/>
stress and &#39;spiralling&#39; and to do what he needs to do<br/>
to break the pattern and center himself.  I found that<br/>
my son was generally lashing out physically when he<br/>
was overwhelmed in terms of stress/stimuli, so helping<br/>
him eliminate the stimuli for a bit was helpful.  I<br/>
found it helpful to make his room very zenlike... not<br/>
a lot of stuff, nothing on the walls... kids like this<br/>
are often very open to the world, they don&#39;t have the<br/>
same ability to filter out what is extraneous and what<br/>
is important.  We sort of prioritize what is of<br/>
import, ignore the peripheral stuff and focus on what<br/>
is useful to the situation; for these kids it&#39;s all<br/>
the same, everything is important, which is *so*<br/>
overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
I think Ritalin is not necessary in a lot of cases, I<br/>
think some parents find it extremely helpful.  You<br/>
need to assess your own situation, and your child&#39;s,<br/>
and be flexible, try different things.  DON&#39;T worry<br/>
about him doing what other kids are doing at the same<br/>
age... they aren&#39;t dealing with the same stuff he is,<br/>
so it isn&#39;t a fair comparison.  Be aware of where his<br/>
own strengths and gifts lie, and praise him for those;<br/>
the rest of the world is hard on his self esteem, so<br/>
shore up what you can at home.  He isn&#39;t sensitive to<br/>
others because he is so overwhelmed by his own senses;<br/>
he is actually more sensitive than most other<br/>
children.  If he can learn to control that to some<br/>
degree, that can be a gift as well as a burden.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-921498922">we told our children poop was our bodies natural way of taking out the garbage, like we do in the house. That made sense to them and removed some of the anxiety. I let them move at their own pace in potty training. We provided potty seat and help if wanted, but left it up to the child when they were ready<br/>

  Mr. Rogers actually did one of his shows about this,<br/>
  so it must be pretty common.  He seemed to feel that<br/>
  children had two fears:  they fear they could fall in<br/>
  and get flushed down themselves AND they feel that<br/>
  their poop is part of themselves and that in flushing<br/>
  it away they are somehow flushing away part of<br/>
  themselves (which connects again to the first fear, I<br/>
  imagine).  I don&#39;t remember an awful lot about the<br/>
  show, but I remember that it involved talking about<br/>
  these fears, telling them how poop is made, giving the<br/>
  child a lot of calming talk about what happens to the<br/>
  poop when it is flushed, giving the child lots of<br/>
  opportunity to flush the toilet themselves,<br/>
  demonstrating how things that are smaller than<br/>
  themselves are still too big to go down the toilet...<br/>
<br/>
  I wrote a book and illustrated with cartoon pictures<br/>
  of my son when he was potty training... it seemed to<br/>
  really help him with certain potty issues he was<br/>
  having, and he was thrilled to have his own book about<br/>
  it.  That might help your child...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-792893447">My child doesn&#39;t have these fears, but she constantly forgets to flush the toilet and she&#39;s 10! I have to remind her to flush the toilet, turn off all the lights that she turns on and shut the front door when she leaves it wide open...yeah to let the flies in the house even though its a nice day outside. We do not have a screen door on this apt...hopefully our next place of residence WILL have one!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049173103">A little late, maybe but.  About children who are afraid to poop in <br/>
the toilet, with both of my children, as soon as they were able to <br/>
stand on their own, I would take them into the bathroom, and show <br/>
them as I emptied their diaper contents into the toilet, and flush <br/>
it.  We would wave bye-bye, and try to flush the toilet themselves.  <br/>
My kids are not afraid, but that may just be luck or something.<br/>
