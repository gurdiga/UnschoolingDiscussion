 </span></blockquote>Mary, I&#39;m 2 days behaind on email, so maybe someone suggested this already.  <br/>
My husband was job hunting from home and it&#39;s was the most stressful thing!  <br/>
I felt like I had to get us out of the house for a few hours so he could have <br/>
some quiet for phone calls but then people call back when we&#39;re home and <br/>
noisy.<br/>
<br/>
I finally got him to move out to the shed.  This is a nice shed built by a <br/>
chain (in CA; there&#39;s probably something similar in Florida) called The Shed <br/>
Shop.  We had it built about 4 years ago for less than $4000, including <br/>
skylights, four windows, good locking door.  It&#39;s 120 sq. feet, which is the <br/>
largest allowed in our city (and another I know of - it may be a standard <br/>
thing) without a permit.  Smaller ones cost less of course.  We hired an <br/>
electrical contractor to do electricity (but skipped the permit - feeling a <br/>
little guilty explaining that one to my kids).   And now it has a phone line <br/>
and is on a network with our house computer.  So Daddy&#39;s office is in the <br/>
backyard and we can be home and live our lives.<br/>
<br/>
And now, it turns out he&#39;ll be starting a business and using that shed as a <br/>
workshop which I think is really cool because he&#39;ll be enough away to give us <br/>
space but close enough for us to be involved in the business.<br/>
<br/>
I have another homeschooling friend with a work-at-home spouse.  He works out <br/>
of a spare bedroom.  When their daughter went through a screaming phase, they <br/>
stressed about it a lot, but it really helped to buy a soundproof door for a <br/>
few hundred.  Apparently much of the sound comes through the door rather than <br/>
walls.  (Of course with my kids, sometimes they&#39;re banging on the wall!  They <br/>
always bang the recliner into it.  The other day I was at the bathroom sink <br/>
just the other side of the wall from the recliner and bang, the medicine <br/>
cabinet popped open!)<br/>
<br/>
Hope these ideas help.<br/>
<br/>
Pam T., still around and appreciating the wisdom on this list<br/>
