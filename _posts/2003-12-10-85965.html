<div id="ygrps-yiv-252039257">Your right, not all will do it the same and we dont. The life examples and <br/>
stories given by this poster are no where near different styles of parenting in <br/>
the unschooling thinking many of us know.  Some of what was written by her <br/>
cannot be displayed as unschooling example it more fits a page on the rights of <br/>
spanking. Just doesn&#39;t fit and never will. If she wasn&#39;t religious would we be <br/>
considering it as possible to Unschool this way? I think not. <br/>
I think people can be religious and unschool if they can tweak but I haven&#39;t <br/>
met one in person yet.<br/>
<br/>
Laura (who is still shocked her close friend confirmed today that they <br/>
believe the Christian/more babies/taking over the world beliefs) no they are not <br/>
unschoolers. Unschooling doesn&#39;t follow their beliefs &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
********************************************************<br/>
&lt;&lt;In both and all directions on this &quot;extreme&quot; thread. Respect for how <br/>
families <br/>
approach these deeply personal subjects, it seems to me, would be an <br/>
important part of unschooling. Acknowledging that not every family will do it <br/>
like <br/>
yours. Some of us are not religious at all, some are, some have had good life <br/>
experiences, some deeply traumatic -- all of these things and more inform how <br/>
we <br/>
unschool and live. But we probably all get that. :)<br/>
