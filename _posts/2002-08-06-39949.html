<br/>
No, actually it&#39;s a whole Southern thing. Mardi Gras actually has <br/>
it&#39;s roots in Mobile (about 45 minutes from where I live) but New <br/>
Orleans gets all the focus and people think it started there because <br/>
it gets so insanely crazy over this holiday now.<br/>
Here in Pensacola, you will find King&#39;s cake in every store come <br/>
February, the typical purple, gold and green beads on people and <br/>
yards get decorated right after the Christmas decor comes down.<br/>
I love Mardi Gras here, we don&#39;t get the crazines of New Orleans, but <br/>
it is a big deal. Many parades and events to attend come February. <br/>
The kids love getting their moonpies (never knew what those were <br/>
before moving here) and beads.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, right. I should have written that Mardi gras has it&#39;s American <br/>
roots in Mobile!!<br/>
Here&#39;s an interesting tidbit about the Mardi Gras/Three Kings <br/>
connection....<br/>
<br/>
LOS REYES MAGOS<br/>
<br/>
The Christmas season continues unabated in Mexico through Epiphany, <br/>
which is called Día de los Reyes (Three Kings Day). Echoing the <br/>
arrival in Bethlehem of Wise Men bearing gifts for the baby Jesus, <br/>
children throughout Mexico anxiously await waking up January 6 to <br/>
find toys and gifts left by the Reyes Magos (Magi). In some regions <br/>
it is customary to leave out shoes where treasures may be deposited <br/>
by the visiting Wise Men.<br/>
<br/>
A special treat served one this day is the Rosca de Reyes--a crown-<br/>
shaped sweet bread decorated with jewel-like candied fruits. Tiny <br/>
figures of babies are hidden in the dough before baking. There is <br/>
much excitement as each partaker cuts his or her own slice, for <br/>
whoever gets a piece containing a baby is obliged to host another <br/>
party on or before Candlemas, February 2, when Mexico&#39;s holiday <br/>
season finally comes to an end.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So apparently, some of the Mardi Gras traditions (the baby in the <br/>
cake thing) is related to the epiphany (three kings) holiday?<br/>
And it&#39;s roots seem to be in Mexico, being heavily Catholic and all.<br/>
Which of course traces back to Europe at some point, because that&#39;s <br/>
where the Catholic religion began. So was it the Spanish that brought <br/>
all this to our neighbors to the South?<br/>
Must be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-364253707">Weeeeellllll - to the extent that you believe that a physical<br/>
place can be where a faith &quot;started&quot; - and the quotes were<br/>
intentional - I think it would be hard to pin point Christianity<br/>
as beginning anywhere except either Bethlehem (birth) or<br/>
Golgotha/Jerusalem (death).  If you&#39;re hunting them on a map, you<br/>
would start by typing &quot;Israel map&quot; into Google - or turning to<br/>
&quot;Israel&quot; in the atlas.  It certainly was intended as nothing more<br/>
than a simple answer to simple statement that Catholicism<br/>
&quot;started in Spain&quot;.   I wasn&#39;t planning on getting into the<br/>
merits of the other denominations, including pride of primacy,<br/>
given that it is so often a revelation for folks that we mackerel<br/>
snappers are Christians at all, LOL.<br/>

his wife moved to Gulf Shores, AL, last September, and<br/>
around Mardi Gras time they were talking about a big<br/>
parade there and other parades in the area. I, being a<br/>
clueless yankee &lt;g&gt; had no idea that Mardi Gras<br/>
existed anywhere other than in New Orleans!<br/>

&gt; 189, &quot;Matthew also issued among the Hebrews a written Gospel in their own <br/>
&gt; language, while Peter and Paul were evangelizing in Rome and laying the <br/>
&gt; foundation of the Church. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>The word catholic (small c) is related to the universal church. That is why <br/>
many churches (Catholic and not Catholic) say the Nicene Creed with the <br/>
following words, We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. <br/>
Because the (small c) catholic does not denote the (capitol C) Catholic <br/>
Church as a denomination, rather it refers to the universal church the <br/>
foundation of such set by the apostles after Christ&#39;s death. Peter became the <br/>
first Pope, or Bishop of Rome, beginning the Catholic Church. Years later a <br/>
monk by the name of Martin Luther nailed his 93 Thesis on the door of the <br/>
Church in Wittenberg in 1517. The Thesis was about the Power and Efficacy of <br/>
Indulgences. Luther wanted to draw attention to the ways he felt the common <br/>
priests, monks and brothers were selling indulgences, and how wrong he knew <br/>
that to be. It ended up with him being excommunicated and he and his <br/>
followers began the Lutheran Church. There have been many other breaking away <br/>
from the Catholic church such as the Greek Orthodox, and the Church of <br/>
England. <br/>
Neither the Catholic or catholic church started in Israel.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619203158">Christianity started in Israel because Jesus came to fulfill the <br/>
law.  Now, instead of just the Israelites being God&#39;s chosen people, <br/>
all who come to faith in Christ are God&#39;s chosen people.  <br/>
<br/>
And actually, Catholicism claims to be the original Christian faith, <br/>
but the original Christian faith is homechurching.  Early Christians <br/>
right after pentacost met from home to home.  It wasn&#39;t until <br/>
Constantine that Christians moved from homes into &quot;Christian <br/>
temples&quot;.  Then Catholicism began. <br/>

&gt;Christianity started in Israel because Jesus came to fulfill the<br/>
&gt;law.  Now, instead of just the Israelites being God&#39;s chosen people,<br/>
&gt;all who come to faith in Christ are God&#39;s chosen people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And actually, Catholicism claims to be the original Christian faith,<br/>
&gt;but the original Christian faith is homechurching.  Early Christians<br/>
&gt;right after pentacost met from home to home.  It wasn&#39;t until<br/>
&gt;Constantine that Christians moved from homes into &quot;Christian<br/>
&gt;temples&quot;.  Then Catholicism began.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sheila<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; How do you figure Christianity started in Israel?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And it&#39;s not a denomination of the Christian faith.  It&#39;s the<br/>
&gt;original<br/>
&gt; &gt; Christian faith, from which others broke off one by one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876108494">LOL - to a great extent, when/where you think Catholicism started<br/>
reflects what you believe to be true.  Folks who hold to some<br/>
idea that Catholicism is a building in a city are reflecting<br/>
their belief that &quot;You are Peter; upon this rock&quot; was purely<br/>
personal to Peter.<br/>
<br/>
As a Catholic, the unbroken line of apostolic succession, from<br/>
Peter to John Paul II, encompassing each priest bishop and<br/>
cardinal makes church that needs no buildings, requires no hills<br/>
in Rome.   To say that a foundation stone was the start of a<br/>
faith is to deny that the faith is anything more than a physical<br/>
institution.  Those are belief systems on both sides.  Of all the<br/>
things I find it profitable to discuss on-line, religious beliefs<br/>
has never made the cut.<br/>
<br/>
...but we are probably getting a bit away from unschooling,<br/>
except for the object lesson of how a simple question leads to<br/>
lots of learning, but that unless we know that we don&#39;t know we<br/>
can be awfully confident.<br/>

disciples travelled around, and the early church letters were to places all <br/>
around the northeastern Mediterranean.  <br/>

Rome and Byzantium were having political problems.  Rome controlled both <br/>

ALL of that is interpretation.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The High Churchmen, in theory at least, emphasize the principle of church <br/>
authority as the final court of doctrinal appeal; whilst the Low Churchmen <br/>
appeal rather to the Bible, privately interpreted, as the decisive judge. The <br/>
High Churchmen exalt ecclesiastical tradition as the voice of church <br/>
authority, regard the Holy Eucharist as in some sense a sacrifice and the <br/>
sacraments as efficacious channels of grace, and they insist on rites and <br/>
ceremonies as the appropriate expression of external worship. whilst the Low <br/>
Churchmen are distrustful of what they call human traditions, regard the Holy <br/>
Eucharist as a symbolic meal only, hold firmly that the grace of <br/>
justification and sanctification is imparted to the soul independently of <br/>
visible channels, and dislike all rites and ceremonies, save those of the <br/>
simplest kind, as tending to substitute an external formalism for true inward <br/>
devotion.&quot;<br/>

Baptists are &quot;low church.&quot;  Church hierarchy and ritual aren&#39;t important, or <br/>
are all internal to each congregation (deacons are good; there are no <br/>
bishops, arch-bishops, etc. outside that congregation with authority though).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132861594">I&#39;m thinking when God promised Abraham that his descendents would be <br/>
a nation.  When God changed Jacob&#39;s name to Israel and his <br/>
descendents became a nation.  When Israel begged God for a king <br/>
instead of continuing as a theocracy. Even when times came that <br/>
Israel wasn&#39;t considered a nation by the world, they were still God&#39;s <br/>
chosen people, His holy nation.  <br/>
<br/>
Remember Joshua and Caleb spying on Canaan?  Didn&#39;t God end up <br/>
delivering that land to Israel?  Maybe when Jesus was on earth the <br/>
world didn&#39;t recognize it as belonging to Israel, but Canaan is <br/>
Israel.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Israel was conquered and enslaved, sometimes it was divided <br/>
and fought among itself, sometimes other nations claimed to own it&#39;s <br/>
land.  But it was always Israel. <br/>
<br/>
It is both a physical place and a group of people.  It is the people <br/>
to whom were given a set of laws, to show the futility of trying to <br/>
have righteousness simply by one&#39;s own works.  It is the place these <br/>
people lived to whom the Messiah came to fulfill these laws.  <br/>
<br/>
And then Jesus told these people to circumcise their hearts, not <br/>
their bodies.  To rest in Jesus instead of Sabath laws.  That all <br/>
their works are like filthy rags, so just trust in Jesus&#39; blood to <br/>
cover their sins instead of sacrificing animals.  And now not just <br/>
people who have born physically to Jewish parents can consider <br/>
themselves God&#39;s chosen people.  Now all who accept Christ as Lord <br/>
and Savior are a holy nation and a chosen people.<br/>

Don&#39;t apply &quot;By grace are ye saved, not by works&quot; to the Old Testament or to <br/>
the Jews!  They have a TON of laws and rules by which they have to prove <br/>
themselves righteous.  And any Christian who wants to use ANY of the Old <br/>
Testament to justify actions should follow all those rules too.  But too many <br/>
Christians only use the Old Testament to justify hitting their kids and <br/>
discriminating against homosexuals.  The rest they want to ignore.  <br/>
<br/>

Please give a verse reference.  I don&#39;t think Jesus said that.<br/>

  &lt;&lt; are you <br/>
  saying that john 1;1 is an interpretation of genesis?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Meaning do I think it&#39;s a reference?<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;my ubderstanding is that the whole <br/>
  old testament is full of prophecy of christ-is.64 comes to mind&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  ALL of that is interpretation.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;The High Churchmen, in theory at least, emphasize the principle of church <br/>
  authority as the final court of doctrinal appeal; whilst the Low Churchmen <br/>
  appeal rather to the Bible, privately interpreted, as the decisive judge. The <br/>
  High Churchmen exalt ecclesiastical tradition as the voice of church <br/>
  authority, regard the Holy Eucharist as in some sense a sacrifice and the <br/>
  sacraments as efficacious channels of grace, and they insist on rites and <br/>
  ceremonies as the appropriate expression of external worship. whilst the Low <br/>
  Churchmen are distrustful of what they call human traditions, regard the Holy <br/>
  Eucharist as a symbolic meal only, hold firmly that the grace of <br/>
  justification and sanctification is imparted to the soul independently of <br/>
  visible channels, and dislike all rites and ceremonies, save those of the <br/>
  simplest kind, as tending to substitute an external formalism for true inward <br/>
  devotion.&quot;<br/>

  Baptists are &quot;low church.&quot;  Church hierarchy and ritual aren&#39;t important, or <br/>
  are all internal to each congregation (deacons are good; there are no <br/>
  bishops, arch-bishops, etc. outside that congregation with authority though).<br/>

&lt;&lt; wait a minute i GOTTA speak up now.. when everyone says what the bible is <br/>
saying.. are we talking the king james version? or the one on the rocks? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, the straight-up one, neat! <br/>
KJV!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the one used to wrestle people with.  <br/>
<br/>
The others are used for niceness.<br/>
<br/>
I like my religion blended, with ice, strained, and with salt on the rim.  <br/>
(LOTS of salt...)<br/>
