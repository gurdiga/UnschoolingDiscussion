We used to have a little exercise trampoline.  $45, 4 inches off the ground,<br/>
good for people up to 250 lbs.  All you could do was jump, no tricks, but it<br/>
was sure good for Tim&#39;s energy, especially during wet Washington winters.<br/>
Worst thing anybody got off of that one was a bruise falling off onto the<br/>
knees.  <br/>

The 12&#39; trampoline and net set up is $389 at Walmart. I&#39;ve been waiting<br/>
for it to go on sale, and figured we would put it up in the spring. It<br/>
hasn&#39;t gone above 20 degrees here for over a week, so I can&#39;t see them<br/>
using it now anyway. People down the road have one w/ a net, and the<br/>
girls have a ball on it. I hear that even with the net, there are a lot<br/>
of reported injuries on them, and my neighbors<br/>
home owners insurance went up when the agent did a drive-by and saw the<br/>
trampoline. I think the problems would come in if the children are just<br/>
left to their own on it. They can get pretty wild. Oh well, if it becomes<br/>
a problem, it comes down just as quick as it goes up.<br/>
Thanks for the tip.<br/>

That&#39;s funny! All that jumping must have some impact on the bladder! When<br/>
my youngest was still potty training (sorry, I just don&#39;t know what else<br/>
to call it) she peed on her friends trampoline. I tried to catch her, and<br/>
get her off before she did, but she just said &quot;Mommie. it&#39;s ok. It goes<br/>
right through&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that must be it. BOINGY BOINGY BOINGY.. And the fact that they dont <br/>
want to get down, run to the house ( or the woods..lol) then run back, climb <br/>
back onto the trampoline.. Its just so much easier to step over and let it <br/>
go.. (OH, btw, our back yard is private and secluded, so they arent <br/>
&quot;flashing&quot; anybody, except Anna, I guess..)<br/>
