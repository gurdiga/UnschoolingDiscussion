 </span></blockquote>They&#39;re pretty cool.  The idea started with the book Flat Stanley, <br/>
where a boy was in bed and a bulletin board fell on him.  He got <br/>
flattened.  He realized all the cool things he could do being flat, <br/>
like being mailed in an envelope to visit his friend in another <br/>
state.  <br/>
<br/>
The flat travelers group on yahoo is mostly homeschoolers.  You make <br/>
a little flat person (or flat animal, or whatever...).  You find <br/>
someone in the database of over 200 people who you would like to send <br/>
your flat traveler to visit.  They take him around, showing him the <br/>
sites where they live, and keep a journal of what he does for a <br/>
week.  Sometimes they send pictures or postcards.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter is keeping a journal of all the places her flat travelers <br/>
visit.  Flat Tiger just came home from Florida, She just sent a flat <br/>
traveler to Hawaii, and another is on its way home from Puerto Rico. <br/>
She is 9 and really into it.   <br/>
<br/>
My son is 5 and sent one out, but really isn&#39;t into it like his <br/>
sister.  He said he doesn&#39;t care if he doesn&#39;t send anymore out. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re taking a party of 8 flat travelers with us when we go to take a <br/>
ride on Thomas the Tank Engine in a few weeks! One of them is from <br/>
Germany! <br/>
