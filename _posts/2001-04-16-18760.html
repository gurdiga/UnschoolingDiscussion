<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026271488">If you are already experiencing symptoms of stresss and if the kids want to<br/>
homeschool AND  since you and they are experienced ,  why wait?<br/>
<br/>
I had my older son in public school at his request in middle school.   BIG<br/>
MISTAKE.   When he was ready to leave,  I thought he should &quot;follow through on<br/>
commitments &quot;  or some such &lt;gg&gt;&gt;.    Fortunately I eventually came to my<br/>
seenses and took  him out in middle of semester but not before further damage<br/>
had been inflicted.<br/>
<br/>
It is certainly your choice but my vote would be &quot;Just do it-----now&quot;<br/>

three children ages 11, 9 1/2, and 8.  Also have two housecats, 2 <br/>

Boy, was I wrong! (but i&#39;m sure you all know that.*grin)<br/>
   I will be taking them out of public school at the end of this <br/>

<br>How would you gradually pull them out? &nbsp;One at a time -- part-time . . .?
<br>
<br>The feeling around here in the schoolies I know is that the year is pretty

You could take them out at the end of today, if you want.  There&#39;s nothing <br/>

more stress and bad attitude.<br/>

I replied to your post before, but my computer messed up, so I don&#39;t <br/>
think it got sent.  In any case, welcome to the list.  I see that <br/>
other people replied, too (but I haven&#39;t got that far, yet).  The <br/>
longer your kids are in school, the longer it will take to overcome <br/>

I&#39;m in Indiana too :) I pulled mine out the beginning of this year, IN has <br/>

<div><font color="#008080" size="4">I&nbsp;can really identify with the issues you 
are dealing with. We have six children, 16,14,10,9,3 and 2. We homeschooled for 
two years before moving from Massachusetts to Tennessee in the fall of &#39;99. Last 
year thw kids went to public school, because of moving twice. Once to a rental 
house then finally to our home.&nbsp; The 9 year old had never gone to public 
school and although he did well academically, he had some problems with 
controlling teachers threatening him when there was no need. All they had to do 
was ask him. We are homeschooling again this year except for the 14 year old by 
his choice. Most of my behavior problems come from this child, and I don&#39;t think 
it is age related. He brings home many cruel jokes and behaviors. How supportive 
is your local school district towards homeschoolers? Are you involved with a 
local home schooling group? Maybe you could ask someone there about it? If the 
children are asking to come home, it may be best to take them out now.&nbsp;I 
don&#39;t understand how you could take them out gradually, or do you mean plan it 
out then take them out? What specifically do&nbsp;you fear happening if you take 
them out now and are they realistic fears? Are you planning on unschooling when 
you do take them out? Are your concerns curicculum or recordkeeping? Are you 
clear on your states laws? I know lots of questions when you want answers, but 
clarification of your particular concerns will help you to address them. 
Personally I would take them out as soon as you can.</font></div>
