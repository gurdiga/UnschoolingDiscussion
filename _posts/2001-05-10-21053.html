&gt;   My three children and I are hypoglycemic (largely<br/>
&gt; due to hyperinsulinemia).  We became severely ill,<br/>

&gt; snacks, as these are acid-producing either in and of<br/>
&gt; themselves or as a by-product of digestion.  We now<br/>
&gt; take green barley juice which neutralizes the blood<br/>
&gt; sugar instantaneously, provides chlorophyll, 92 vitamins<br/>
&gt; and minerals and live enzymes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, this is interesting! My son who is mildly hypoglycemic (has wild mood<br/>
swings, for one thing, if his blood sugar is not evened out) loves and<br/>
craves &quot;green&quot; juice! Maybe his body intuitively knows what is best for him.<br/>
I like it too, but I have a weird stomach and almost all the brands I&#39;ve<br/>
tried just tie it up in knots.<br/>

&gt; measures will not work in these situations.  Those<br/>
&gt; who do not have extraordinary children often do not<br/>
&gt; understand why the routine measures they take with<br/>
&gt; great success will not work for everybody else.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL, ain&#39;t this is the truth! I&#39;m on a &quot;due date list&quot; for each of my kids<br/>
where all the babies were due in the same month and the solutions that they<br/>
have suggested like &quot;sing a special song to make teeth brushing time fun&quot;<br/>
just always baffled me. My son (before we figured out how to eliminate most<br/>
of his sensory issues) equated teeth brushing to being branded with hot<br/>
irons and no amount of special songs was going to change that perception. It<br/>
took a heck of a lot of creativity, time, energy, etc. to get through even<br/>
the tiniest simplest every day routines. Whew! Exhausting. Now that I have<br/>
my daughter, I understand why they made those suggestions. Not that she<br/>
isn&#39;t challenging in her own ways (mostly because, like her mother, she&#39;s a<br/>
fireball, a climber, a daredevil), but in every day life, things are pretty<br/>
darn easy. When it&#39;s time to put shoes on, she sits down and puts her shoes<br/>
on. No screaming about &quot;sock squishies!!!!&quot;. When it&#39;s time to wash her<br/>
hair, she puts her head back and lets me do it. I feel so bad for my son<br/>
that everything had to be so much harder for him than for average kids. I<br/>
can also see how kids like this can raise the level of stress in parenting<br/>
to a high that most folks will never understand. When it literally takes an<br/>
hour to get your kid dressed in the morning because of all the &quot;issues&quot;, it<br/>
can try the patience of even a saint! And of course everyone has opinions<br/>
about how you&#39;re &quot;coddling&quot; them and &quot;catering&quot; to their wishes, because<br/>
they don&#39;t understand how very hard things are for a kid with differing<br/>
abilities. I used to think that if my son was paralyzed in a wheelchair,<br/>
no-one would be insisting that I force him to dress himself with his wasted<br/>
limbs, but because he has these invisible coordination problems, they<br/>
somehow think I should be pushing him to do something he simply cannot do.<br/>
Ditto with potty training and a million other issues.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-580741543">And people interpret what your kid is doing so<br/>
unfairly, too!  I couldn&#39;t get my son&#39;s preschool<br/>
teacher to understand that it was *her* reaction to<br/>
him that was causing my son to lash out at other<br/>
kids... she was stressing him out so badly by<br/>
expecting him to do things he *couldn&#39;t* do, while not<br/>
allowing him to do the things he did well.  I knew<br/>
better than to tell her that, but she was totally<br/>
resistant to suggestions that she give him positive<br/>
feedback and opportunities to limit sensory input. <br/>
She kept talking about trying to get him to be like<br/>
the other kids by just *expecting* him to behave the<br/>
same way.  Clueless...<br/>
<br/>
And I remember going through the *exact* same thing<br/>
with the baby massage!  Lol!<br/>
