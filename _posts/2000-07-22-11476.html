<div id="ygrps-yiv-221259844">Welcome kim,<br/>
I am Amy, unschooling mom to 3 girls. Samantha 7, Dana 4, and Casey 2. I&#39;m<br/>
sorry, but I don&#39;t have much advice to give in the area of assesments. We<br/>
are fortunate to live in a town that does not require them. Just one of the<br/>
lucky ones I guess. Welcome again.<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Hello, I am new here<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hello all.  My name is Kim and I am unschooling 3 of my 4 boys.  My<br/>
youngest<br/>
&gt; is 5 so he isn&#39;t offically schooling yet.  This was my first year and I<br/>
loved<br/>
&gt; it.  I was wondering if anyone on this list lives near Youngstown, Ohio<br/>
area?<br/>
&gt;  I get my assessment tommorow and I am nervous about it because my<br/>
children<br/>
&gt; did more computer work and hands on things.  I  now have a camera and<br/>
video<br/>
&gt; camera to use so I guess this will help for next year.  How does everyone<br/>
&gt; keep track for all the projects and such?  Thanks so much for the answers<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; these questions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477569322">Hi Kim. I am from Ohio-about 40 miles east of Columbus. Alot of the people <br/>
on this list will probably not know what you are talking about regarding <br/>
assessments, as not every state makes people jump through hoops as we have <br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
I think it depends on who you have doing them-ours have been done by a lady <br/>
who is unschool friendly-all we really did was talk. She did look over some <br/>
of the papers I brought along-mostly I guess they just sparked discussion <br/>
over some of the things we had done over the year. I was really nervous <br/>
about it the first time, and made the kids do worksheets and stuff so we <br/>
would have something for the portfolio, but that was not needed.  It turned <br/>
out to be a really relaxed conversation with a nice lady who reassured me <br/>
that Yes, we are learning, we have made the right choice, I am doing enough. <br/>
So, after that I deschooled even more!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871737113">Thanks for the information.  I have alot of pics of the kids cooking, making <br/>
trucks and other things with knex, places that we have visited, ect.  They <br/>
also get on the internet and look up information to questions they have and <br/>
we don&#39;t know the answers too.  Thank goodness for Ask Jeeves.com.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I do assessments in Ohio and am finding a niche with the unschoolers in<br/>
this area.  What you describe is pretty much what I do.  The unschoolers<br/>
are so much more fun and entertaining for me than the workbooks I go<br/>
through with others:/  I was treated to a piano-string trio at one home<br/>
yesterday, which was just delightful:)  And at another, my family was<br/>
invited to stay for dinner and we ended up being there from 4-11 pm!  We<br/>
all had a wonderful time.  I really enjoy assessment time.  <br/>
