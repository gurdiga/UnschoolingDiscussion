Perhaps one of the most important things you can do for your kids is to be  <br/>
aware that you are grieving too. <br/>
This was your brother and it&#39;s so difficult to lose a brother so  <br/>
unexpectedly.  I think it&#39;s important to discuss some of your sadness with  your children <br/>
as well as ways you work through your grief.  It can be a  long process and <br/>
perhaps sharing some of the things you are doing both in and  out of therapy <br/>
might be beneficial to your children. Talk about your sadness as  well as your <br/>
wonderful happy memories of your brother.  Don&#39;t pressure them  to talk about <br/>
it.  <br/>
 <br/>
Six weeks is not that long.  I&#39;d suggest waiting on any outside  intervention <br/>
for awhile. My brother died unexpectedly almost two years  ago.  A completely <br/>
different situation as my kids are older and we didn&#39;t  live close to him, <br/>
however, something that did help us all is to just get out of  the house.  I <br/>
felt closer to my brother just being outside and it helped  the kids when they <br/>
were busy doing something new.  It gave us all something  else to focus on and <br/>
gave me some time to think and work through my grief  knowing they were happily <br/>
occupied.  It&#39;s a long and ongoing process.   I&#39;d just recommend not worrying <br/>
about  fixing it and making everything  okay.  Things will get better and <br/>
easier.  But it will be  awhile.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072279419">In our past we have had a number of deaths and on book I found that helps us<br/>
is &quot;Tear Soup&quot; by Pat Schwiebert.  Pat has worked with parents who lost a<br/>
child and currently does hospice care.  She is also my aunt.  They have a<br/>
site  &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.griefwatch.com/">http://www.griefwatch.com/</a>&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.griefwatch.com/">http://www.griefwatch.com/</a> <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The reason I like the book is because it talks about how each person deals<br/>
with death in a different way and at a different pace.  It is beautifully<br/>
illustrated and simple to read.  I have found that my children, my nephews<br/>
and nieces, my friends and my family have all found the book offers so much<br/>
to the healing process.  My friend had a copy on his table for a long time<br/>
after the death of their friend-he would read it and if his kids wanted he<br/>
would read it to them but he didn&#39;t push it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I also saw a book that allowed children to write about the person they lost.<br/>
I have searched for the book and cannot find it.  Maybe someone on this<br/>
group will remember it.  It is a book that had questions or a phrases that<br/>
the child could fill in and write about the person.   <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463601088">-=-RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DECEASED.......No outsider is able to  <br/>
determine the special bond that connects two people, regardless of  <br/>
the relationship, role or length of time the relationship has been in  <br/>
existence.<br/>
Our relationship with the deceased has a great deal to do with the  <br/>
intensity and duration of our grief.<br/>
What was that relationship? Was the deceased a spouse? A child? A  <br/>
parent? A friend? A sibling?<br/>
How strong was the attachment to the deceased? Was it a close,  <br/>
dependent relationship, or intermittent and independent? What was the  <br/>
degree of ambivalence (the love/hate balance) in that relationship?<br/>
It is not only the person, but also the role that person played in  <br/>
our life which is lost.<br/>
How major was that role? Was that person the sole breadwinner, the  <br/>
driver, the handler of financial matters? The only one who could fix  <br/>
a decent dinner? Was that person a main emotional support, an only  <br/>
friend? How dependent were we on the role that person filled?-=-<br/>
========================<br/>
Nicole, that&#39;s a nice site.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.survivorsofsuicide.com/">http://www.survivorsofsuicide.com/</a> <br/>
beyond_surviving.shtml<br/>
I brought a piece here.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes survivors get cranky with one another because they don&#39;t  <br/>
handle it similarly, and the page above discusses that.<br/>
<br/>
Two friends of mine, kids in band with me, one was in my Sunday  <br/>
School class, the other had been my 8th grade boyfriend, killed  <br/>
themselves at 14 and 15.  We all had things to feel guilty about.   <br/>
I&#39;ve had other friends commit suicide since.  It&#39;s rough.<br/>
<br/>
My dad died naturally (VA hospital helped, but it wasn&#39;t suicide).   <br/>
My sister and I first were disagreeing about how he was as a dad, and  <br/>
I quickly realized we didn&#39;t need to agree about it.  We were 22 and  <br/>
25, I think, and my relationship with him was just very different  <br/>
from hers and that was fine.<br/>
<br/>
Since then it&#39;s been easier and clearer to me.  Still not easy, but  <br/>
much less frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s brother died at 54 recently of lung cancer, pretty  <br/>
suddenly.  Diagnosed and dead within a week.  Kirby didn&#39;t know him  <br/>
very well and about a month later he had a huge attack of double  <br/>
guilt, because he hadn&#39;t known him well enough to feel really bad  <br/>
about it, and thought he should have taken the opportunity and all  <br/>
that.  I assured him it was really okay that he hadn&#39;t known him  <br/>
differently or better.<br/>
<br/>
My dad&#39;s mom seemed disturbed that I had fond memories of my Papaw  <br/>
(who died naturally).  I thought of him as a really nice guy who took  <br/>
me for rides in his big old car and got me &quot;pop&quot; (Dr Pepper in a  <br/>
bottle) and let me sit in his lap.  She had lots of bad stories on  <br/>
him and frustration and anger.  She thought I should know about those  <br/>
things, but I told her that wasn&#39;t MY relationship with him.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe some of that kind of exploration would help your kids.  They  <br/>
don&#39;t need to know anything about their uncle except what they  <br/>
experienced with him themselves.  He will live in each person&#39;s  <br/>
memory in a different way.<br/>
<br/>
I was going through photos yesterday and putting some up where others  <br/>
could get to them.  I just finished writing a brief blurb about my  <br/>
husband&#39;s first SCA squire, who hiked up into the mountains and took  <br/>
aspirin and liquor and died, because he had been convicted of picking  <br/>
up an arrowhead on federal property and keeping it, and because his  <br/>
girlfriend broke up with him.<br/>
<br/>
I came across another photo, looking for that one, of another friend,  <br/>
an alcoholic, who went through friends and relatives in Arizona,  <br/>
moved here and went through our crowd (he lived at our house for a  <br/>
year and some) and then moved to Utah, irritated a group of people  <br/>
there, and killed himself.  He was sweet when he was sweet, and awful  <br/>
when he was drinking.<br/>
<br/>
But with depression and suicidal thoughts, there don&#39;t even have to  <br/>
be &quot;reasons&quot; like those.  It can be no more than the feeling that  <br/>
life is just very, very tiring and futile and it would be nice not to  <br/>
wake up.  I know because I&#39;ve had that feeling.  It wasn&#39;t a spiteful  <br/>
or mean or fearful feeling, just a wistful kind of wish for  <br/>
darkness.  Counselling can help!  (Anti-depressants can help.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe talk to your children about that, too.  Say sometimes things  <br/>
like that can be related to depression, and that might be genetic,  <br/>
and if they do start feeling those feelings they should go to a  <br/>
counsellor who can help them come back away from the edge.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800730360">Amie,<br/>
<br/>
I was very close to my father.  When he died I didn&#39;t grieve as I  <br/>
thought I would.  I couldn&#39;t handle breaking down because it was just  <br/>
too painful to go there at that time.  I needed the freedom to grieve  <br/>
as I needed to, which was a little bit at a time.  Being a grown up,  <br/>
I had that right.  People didn&#39;t push me to do this or that, or  <br/>
behave in a way they thought I should.  Maybe Eric is just grieving  <br/>
in his own way... the way he needs to.  I think if you keep the  <br/>
channels of communication as open as possible, and, as Gail said,  <br/>
talk about what you are feeling (perhaps recognizing that an  <br/>
unexpected outburst had its roots in your own grieving and bringing  <br/>
that out) will help your boys deal with their own feelings.   Space  <br/>
to grieve in their own way may be the best &quot;therapy&quot;.  I would  <br/>
suggest giving it some time as well.<br/>

Amie,<br/>
<br/>
First I am so sorry for your loss. My heart goes out to you and your <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
Your kids and you are moving through a process that there is no way <br/>
around. I know you are full up dealing with your own pain right now, <br/>
but helping them grieve sucessfully is one of the most important <br/>
things. Getting stuck in unresolved loss can have lifetime impact. <br/>
<br/>
I did facilitating for foster and adoptive families for years and my <br/>
specialty was helping kids in grief. <br/>
<br/>
Also all of my kids have loss issues of their bio families, but the <br/>
one we saw the loss with the most profoundly was Ty. He came to us <br/>
at nearly seven after having an adoptive family of four years give <br/>
him back to the state. That boy had grief.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the things we did was to keep talking and keeping the focus <br/>
on the actual issue. When he was angry and mean to his sister, we <br/>
helped him refocus on what he was actually upset about. Sometimes it <br/>
took guess work on our part and it took him a long time to actually <br/>
trust us. But all of the feelings, anger, despair, depression, <br/>
confusion, denial are part of moving through it. They are not <br/>
comfortable, they are not fun for anyone. Kids process emotionally <br/>
and those emotions bubble up physically. It is up to us to help them <br/>
have the words to process what they are feeling.<br/>
<br/>
In the research done on grief an average, well coping, adult takes <br/>
about two years to process a big loss. In comparison it takes a <br/>
child six to eight years. <br/>
<br/>
Some of the things that help us process those losses are the support <br/>
we get from other people. <br/>
<br/>
I remember when my fil was killed. I just kept calling and talking <br/>
to people. I am certain I repeated and repeated myself, but it was <br/>
the way I had to move through that loss. Kids do not always know <br/>
what words to put to their feelings and often need help with that.<br/>
<br/>
Ty has now lived in our home for two and a half years. He still <br/>
experiences some seasonal grief, like the time of year he lost his <br/>
family he will be angry or sad. I really try and pay attention and <br/>
know when those times might be coming up. I help him identify what <br/>
is going on with him. His overall sadness and anger have passed. <br/>
They have moved through him like a wave. Holidays were especially <br/>
hard for him and he has had several that were joyous now and not <br/>
filled with emotional past ghosts. So what I am trying to share is <br/>
you and your kids will heal through this.<br/>
<br/>
My thoughts and prayers are with you,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-187336300">One of the things I&#39;ve learned is from my own grief and being with <br/>
others who&#39;ve had losses is that, developmentally, kids tend to do it <br/>
differently.  Young kids might seem to ignore it and simply go on <br/>
with their play.  Teens often have a lot of anger.  I forget the <br/>
details.  Barbara Coloroso has a book, Parenting Through <br/>
Crisis,  that is helpful on what it&#39;s like for kids as well as how to <br/>
get through it as a parent.  One thing I do remember reading when a <br/>
friend died and her daughter was 10 was that many pre-adolescents <br/>
have delayed grief that hits them maybe five years later when they&#39;re <br/>
maybe more able to wrestle with bigger ideas and issues.  I know it <br/>
said that for girls in that huge enormous mother loss situation.  Not <br/>
sure if was more universally applicable.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that a grief counselor told me - for me - that has <br/>
helped me and lots of the people I&#39;ve shared it with is from the <br/>
title of a poem, &quot;Grief is a Circular Staircase.&quot;  The surprising <br/>
thing for me about grief is how it seems like you keep circling back <br/>
around the same places.  It&#39;s really different than Elizabeth <br/>
Kubler-Ross&#39; stages of grief model which is very linear, first <br/>
denial, then...  I think those &quot;stages&quot; happen but not necessarily in <br/>
order and you don&#39;t necessarily &quot;finish&quot; a stage before moving <br/>
on.  It&#39;s like a circular staircase, where you come around to the <br/>
same place you were before, but with a different perspective, higher <br/>
up, more removed maybe.  But just because you feel anger at some <br/>
point a few years later, it doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t healing.  I can <br/>
still feel shock that my mother&#39;s dead, even ten years later, though <br/>
not nearly so often and not nearly so intensely as shortly after.  I <br/>
wish I could find the poem.  Maybe that isn&#39;t the title google didn&#39;t <br/>
turn up much besides Robert Frost and staircase kits.<br/>
<br/>
Be gentle with yourself and each other.<br/>

can understand that it might be helpful for many.<br/>

black and crying loudly and he found it very oppressive and was <br/>

<br/>
With Ty I talked a lot about my own feelings on it. His adoptive <br/>
family <br/>
were close friends of mine and their decision to disrupt the <br/>
adoption <br/>
was devistating for us. <br/>
<br/>
I said things like, When I think about it I get sooo angry. I feel <br/>
really sad that it happened.  Mothers are supposed to love their <br/>
kids <br/>
and protect them. I am sad you did not have a mother that did that. <br/>
He <br/>
then in turn had permission to share his feelings. He one day asked <br/>
to <br/>
call former mom and confronted her with the whys&#39;. He yelled at her <br/>
and  she said she was sorry. He layed in his bed and cried for hours <br/>
with me just rubbing his back. This is one incident. He moved <br/>
through <br/>
this grief like you shared on a spiral staircase. But the more he <br/>
shared and processed the smaller it became.<br/>
<br/>
He recently had his former brother and sister over for a visit on <br/>
his <br/>
ninth birthday. When they left he said he really does not feel sad <br/>
anymore. I told him that was okay.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that was really important and may apply to Amie and her <br/>
boys <br/>
is Ty did not know it was okay to be angry at her initially. He kept <br/>
trying to figure it out and had huge self blame.He thought he was a <br/>
bad <br/>
kid. That he should have done things differently. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then once he knew he <br/>
could be angry he also needed to know it was okay to still love her. <br/>
Once we were driving and from the backseat he asked if I loved her <br/>
even <br/>
though I was mad.  Remember she was my friend long before he came <br/>
into her <br/>
life.  I explained to him how I had known her for twenty years and I <br/>
really did love her and that was why what happened hurt me so <br/>
