<br/>
Commas and grammar are not insubstantial.<br/>
<br/>
Priorities, my dear!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unless it was a combination such as:<br/>
&gt; -This morning I had coffee, ham and eggs, and toast.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then I saw some grammar police on Oprah one day and he said its:<br/>
&gt; -I have a blue, red, yellow, and green book.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The core of my beleif system was shaken!!! I was outraged!!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Laughingly though, I guess things change so much eventually everyone will <br/>
&gt; have their own rules. And I&#39;ll still have my pet peeves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; thanks for the chat on non-substantial issues.<br/>
