<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s funny you should say that. It is interesting to note that my first<br/>
husband was an officer in the air force. Most of the wives that I<br/>
encountered while we were married wouldn&#39;t say boo without their husbands. I<br/>
was always going on day trips to a nearby city when we first got married<br/>
because there wasn&#39;t anything to do where we lived. And I would sometimes go<br/>
to the movies by myself. The other wives would say things like &quot;you are so<br/>
lucky that your husband *lets* you do that.&quot; And I would say my husband was<br/>
at work when I went to the city so what would it even have to do with him.<br/>
And regarding the movies,I would tell them, if I wanted to see a movie, and<br/>
he didn&#39;t I would just go by myself. I would also remind them that I was an<br/>
adult and didn&#39;t need &quot;permission&quot;. (I was just barely 20 when we married<br/>
and most of those wives were older than me) They would also tell me that<br/>
they were &quot;afraid&quot; to drive that far by themselves, or go to the movies by<br/>
themselves, even if their husband would *let* them. Some of those wives<br/>
wouldn&#39;t even go to a doctor&#39;s appointment without their husband! It really<br/>
agravated my ex that I wasn&#39;t more like those other wives, which explains<br/>
why he is my ex!<br/>
<br/>
Now I am married to an enlisted man in the air force, and most of the wives<br/>
that I meet are very independent and never ask their husband&#39;s permission<br/>
for anything. Although they do discuss plans with their husbands. Since my<br/>
current dh and I have been married, he has gone on several hunting and<br/>
fishing trips. Now instead of anyone ever being surprised that my husband<br/>
&quot;lets&quot; me do something or go somewhere without him, they are surprised or<br/>
impressed that I &quot;let&quot; him go on these trips without me! No one ever asks me<br/>
about my husband &quot;letting&quot; me do anything. But when he goes hunting or<br/>
fishing they will say things like, &quot;you *let* him go, for how long?&quot; Or &quot;How<br/>
wonderful that you *let* him do things like that!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After my oldest ds turned 18, it took a while to break him of asking<br/>
permission to go places and do things. I had to keep telling him that he<br/>
only had to ask permission to use my car, not to go. I told him that he just<br/>
needed to let us know what his plans were, but he did not need permission<br/>
now that he was an adult. My daughter, however, had no problem making that<br/>
transission. As soon as she turned 18, she quit asking permission and just<br/>
started announcing that she was going to do something or go somewhere.<br/>
