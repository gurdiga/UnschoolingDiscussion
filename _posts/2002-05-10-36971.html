<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870377479">DH and I have had the discussion before about how to keep gifts (i.e.<br/>
birthday and Christmas) special, when throughout the year we pick up<br/>
learning type stuff - books, crafts, learning toys etc.  Maybe it&#39;s just<br/>
because our oldest is just 3 1/2, but it&#39;s hard for him to distinguish<br/>
between the two things right now.  Books are a lot of this, because they<br/>
are something I&#39;ve always bought a lot of so whenever I find a good<br/>
source of used kids books I pick some up.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts or suggestions from those who have BTDT.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Cathy</div>

 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t make B-day and Christmas GIFTS special.  The days are special <br/>
because they are important days and are treated that way.  The <br/>
presents are there but are not anywhere near being the most important <br/>
part of the days.<br/>
<br/>
One side effect of this is that we spend a lot less on &#39;gifts&#39; now.  <br/>
No one finds them all that important so a very small more personal <br/>
gift is considered better than a big expensive gift.<br/>

we do is that the night before we each draw another family member&#39;s name <br/>
randomly and the next day we do extra special nice things for that person. <br/>
The fun part is that the point is to try to do extra-special nice things but <br/>
IN SECRET!!! Then - later that night we guess who was our special friend that <br/>
day.<br/>
