Yes Tia, and the same must be said for other businesses. Take away profit,<br/>
and you create socialism.  Either things are done for profit, or they are<br/>
done by the government, and that means that everyone pays for everything,<br/>
and everything costs twice what it does now.<br/>

Take food: It has been observed that if the government ran the markets the<br/>
same way it runs its schools, we would all be starving and broke. It finally<br/>
destroyed the USSR, where it was clear that people in the government had<br/>
stolen everything.<br/>
<br/>
Socialism is the myth that we can all live at the expense of everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
The Constitution says, in short, that the government&#39;s job is to protect us<br/>
from harm, not run our lives and our businesses. The latter is the &quot;freedom&quot;<br/>
part.<br/>

You expense your profits away by paying for perhaps carriage of your logs to <br/>
the mill.   Gee, I wonder who the major share holder is of the carriage <br/>
company.   &lt;Evil G&gt;  You get to choose your corporate year end btw. unlike <br/>
W2-ers&#39;.    (You do have to conform to rules that say that shares are not <br/>
held exclusively by same people from one corp to another.   This is the way <br/>
that the Kennedy Fam. and  such protect themselves from taxes (and get you <br/>
to pay them))  Now when the carriage company has its year end it perhaps <br/>
has to market to its customers so it throughs a party, or send surveys to <br/>
the logging companies and expense the survey costs.  Again this is done <br/>
through a corp. and the share holders must not all be the same.<br/>
<br/>
Tax Avoidence is legal btw so don&#39;t drivel over that.  You can choose to pay <br/>
whatever you want.  If you happen to be a marketing firm too take 20% off <br/>
of advertisement fees (more bang for the buck).<br/>

incorporated as a &quot;C&quot; and using stratagies that are not stupid.<br/>

Any idea why &quot;S&quot;&#39;&#39;s are so popular to me they are worthless unless I have <br/>
one foot in the grave or take most $ from distributions.<br/>
