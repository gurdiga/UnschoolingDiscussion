<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417309217">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i think your daughter&#39;s relationship with learning is more important than<br/>
merely being good at spelling (i know that this is difficult for many<br/>
people to accept, given the competitive nature of our society).  i&#39;m not<br/>
sure what learning difficulties she has (spelling is still extremely<br/>
difficult for me and i was tested at the age of 30, and found out i&#39;m<br/>
dyslexic- no big surprise), but what i&#39;ve noticed with our son is, if<br/>
something is particularly challenging he needs to back off a bit and do<br/>
something that gives him the confidence to meet the new challenge.  part of<br/>
unschooling, for me, is the faith you must have in your child and how<br/>
important it is to observe your child so you can be available when those<br/>
windows of opportunity open, when she feels particularly confident and<br/>
ready to venture out.<br/>
<br/>
i think that one of the biggest problems with our traditional approach to<br/>
education is that challenges are set up as a win or lose experience and<br/>
that failure itself has lost it inherent value.   for example, when<br/>
learning to spell, it&#39;s either right our wrong,  but my experience tells me<br/>
that lots of times one comes very close to right, so i see shades of<br/>
gray.   i think that if you spend time talking with her about spelling and<br/>
why she chose the letters/sounds she did (provided she&#39;s willing and<br/>
doesn&#39;t feel threatened by the challenge) the reason she spelled it the way<br/>
she did might begin to make a lot of sense - from her perspective.   this<br/>
can actually give you some insight into how her mind works- but this takes<br/>
time and patience, often hard things to give especially in an atmosphere of<br/>
doubt.   this kind of dialoging is critical but i think that  giving the<br/>
child the opportunity to witness you being challenged and struggling,<br/>
failing and keeping on trying, and enjoying the process of learning, has<br/>
equal value.    i think,  this witnessing  would allow her to feel like<br/>
she&#39;s normal, that everyone has something with which they struggle -<br/>
strengths and weakness that we each individually learn to use and balance.<br/>

Dr. Raymond Moore has written about the benefits of delayed education and<br/>
many examples of children who did not BEGIN formal education until ages<br/>
10-12.  Her ability to read must be reassuring to you.  Maybe she could<br/>
agree to have you help her edit and correct spelling on *important*<br/>
documents that go to those outside your family?  (Like the gift list to<br/>
Grandma)<br/>

<br/>
People who don&#39;t agree with hs/uns will usually manage to find fault. <br/>
How about asking them for statistics on schooled children and spelling<br/>
(Haha).  Are *learning disabilities* part of Noonan&#39;s?  Maybe you can<br/>
point out the areas in which she is doing better than expected.  Good<br/>
luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-517399712">Lisa your post was awesome.  Although spelling, and anything related to<br/>
language and expression has been a strong suit of mine, my father cannot<br/>
&quot;spell to save his life.&quot;  He is a Mechanical/Nuclear engineer with<br/>
multiple degrees and is the manager of an engineering office with a staff<br/>
of 100+ highly educated men and women at a Nuclear Government reservation<br/>
doing extremely technical and important cleanup work.  He has secretarial<br/>
staff who correct his spelling for him, and often sends interoffice notes<br/>
with tons of acronyms instead of full words so he won&#39;t have to spell them.<br/>
<br/>
He did not always have the luxury of secretaries earlier in his career.  I<br/>
mean the man is nearly 70 years old.  He has worked on the Apollo moon<br/>
rocket project, Three Mile Island 1 (the one that DIDN&#39;T meltdown,) Jet and<br/>
rocket engines, and many many other projects.  More recently, he is working<br/>
on Chernobyl cleanup.  But he CANNOT spell.  I repeat CANNOT!!<br/>
<br/>
I recently recieved an email from him in which the NAME of my niece (who<br/>
lives with them) was spelled wrong.....just a recent example.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And dang it, every time I reread a post of mine I find something that should<br/>
have been fixed before the post was sent.  But you know this underscores my<br/>
point.  I was proof reading and meant to change *the ideas presented* to<br/>
*my ideas presented*,  but with 3 young children, the phone, two dogs, my<br/>
own propensity to wander down mental tangents and the laundry... well... the<br/>
point was more important than being grammatically perfect.<br/>
<br/>
I truly believe that in our quest to make everyone *well* educated, we<br/>
destory part of our own souls.  How many times have we almost written a<br/>
letter to the editor, but were afraid we&#39;d make too many mistakes?  How many<br/>
times have we been silenced by the insidious lesson that only *good* writers<br/>
should have their viewpoints presented to the reading public?<br/>
<br/>
If you can find some of the original letters of Jefferson, Hamiliton, Adams<br/>
et al.  You&#39;ll not find many words that had a standard spelling.  I believe<br/>
it&#39;s  Jefferson who even spelled the same word different ways in the same<br/>
letter.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is so hard to talk about at times.  How do we convey that, yes,<br/>
we have hopes and dreams for our children. We want them to have the skills<br/>
needed to function and function well, yet at the same time we value them as<br/>
they are, not as some invisible *standard* would have us believe they should<br/>
be.  Why should all people be able to spell well?  We&#39;re not all able to fix<br/>
an engine. Shoot, I couldn&#39;t even do that when bobby pins were handy. As for<br/>
fixing one without a bobby pin, forget it.  No one thinks less of me because<br/>
I don&#39;t have that particular skill.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t know how to say that yes, I want people in general to think well<br/>
of me and my family, but not at the expense of having to make sure they&#39;re<br/>
happy with my spelling ability. &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Robin, I hope this isn&#39;t too much.  This is one of my own personal demons,<br/>
this issue of spelling and writing.  After I&#39;ve said all of this, I have to<br/>
remind you that we also need to remember she&#39;s 13.  Many, many young women<br/>
are in a fog during this time. They really don&#39;t think too well at times.<br/>
If she&#39;s never been a very good speller, 13 is not the time to expect it to<br/>
get better.  We need you to tell us more about Noonan&#39;s, so that we might<br/>
could point you to specific resources.</div>

<br/>
My name is Diane (36) - I live in France with Jean Luc (46) and<br/>

nothing that others struggle with &quot;that is not a good as it &quot;should&quot; <br/>

It is simply not important - just as it is not so important with<br/>

child/person is what is perfectly normal.  Enjoying the process of <br/>
learning and knowing is enough and fine - - - regardless of errors <br/>
along the way - or &quot;syndromes&quot; and &quot;disabilities&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
It is the *process* that is important - respecting each child&#39;s<br/>
unique process of learning.<br/>
<br/>
Albert Einstein -- born 1879, Ulm, Germany; died 1955<br/>
co-winner of the 1921 Nobel Prize in physics . . . I worked most of the <br/>
time in the physical laboratory [at the Polytechnic Institute of Z�rich],<br/>
fascinated by the direct contact with experience. The balance of the <br/>
time I used in the main in order to study at home the works of Kirchoff,<br/>
Helmholtz, Hertz, etc. . . . In [physics], however, I soon learned to <br/>
scent out that which was able to lead to fundamentals and to turn aside <br/>
from everything else, from the multitude of things which clutter up the <br/>
mind and divert it from the essential. The hitch in this was, of course,<br/>
the fact that one had to cram all this stuff into one&#39;s mind for the <br/>
examinations, whether one liked it or not. This coercion had such a <br/>
deterring effect [upon me] that, after I had passed the final <br/>
examination, I found the consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an entire<br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
                        *        *        * <br/>
My!  How stress and obligation clutter up the mind.  <br/>
Perhaps spelling is not &quot;the essential&quot; for Robin&#39;s daughter. <br/>
<br/>
All is well. Really.<br/>

Well, hectic holidays aside I&#39;m going to take the time to say <br/>
***Thanks*** <br/>
for writing this now Lisa. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking quite a bit about the idea of the brain being &quot;softer&quot; or more impressionable when we are children, and about the fact that I seem to have a HUGE problem with rules and technicalities at this stage of my life. I went to the community college to take a class recently, and though I did get involved in what the teacher was asking of us, I studied my own learning style and rythms more so than following their guide so that I can be a more aware and awake Mom.<br/>
  <br/>
Noticing areas of disinterest in my kids, I&#39;ve questioned whether I am letting *prime learning seasons* pass us by, and with this question in mind, I payed close attention to everything.<br/>
 <br/>
What I&#39;ve decided, after using myself as an example is No, I&#39;m not.<br/>
My spelling is not great, my grammar is annoying to some, and my on-the-spot math calculations are slow in comparison with many others...but I understand and grasp concepts concerning math and science and communication that many of my more technically gifted friends (and dh falls in there too) struggle with. I found out that I can find relevance and meaning in almost anything, and that I really LOVE people. <br/>
 <br/>
Over the years, I have often been told that I&#39;m too &quot;abstract,&quot; and have made efforts to change some of that in order to be able to communicate with people better. It&#39;s been rewarding up to a point. I will never be a technically detailed writer, nor a concrete thinking mathematician. Never. <br/>
My joy is not in that, although I greatly admire people gifted in these ways. <br/>
<br/>
So, though the little stumbles are not convenient and are sometimes a little embarrassing, I wouldn&#39;t trade my &quot;gifts&quot; for someone else&#39;s. That being so, I can&#39;t exactly encourage my children to do so can I? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
And Lisa, you&#39;re very right about spelling skills. Practice is the only thing that makes sense. Learning the rules and tips are useful once the desire to create a full and complete &quot;work&quot; are in place, but on their own they can be just drudgery. My oldest dd is a wonderful speller for her age, and that is only because she is interested in writing stories about sea-life and reading about whales. She hasn&#39;t learned spelling for spelling&#39;s sake.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m hoping that in coming days she&#39;ll apply this same principle to gaining her &quot;math&quot; skills... somehow gaining the more concrete and measurable skills in order to do or describe or display something that she&#39;s already interested in. Seeing that for 5 years, her interest in nature and science hasn&#39;t slowed down, I&#39;m pretty confident that we&#39;ll begin running into definable math principles at a faster and faster rate...but we&#39;ll see. :)<br/>

It makes me think of &#39;de-story&#39;: to take away part of someone&#39;s <br/>
life story.  It&#39;s all about *meaning* and putting thoughts into words.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-150564458">I just wanted to thank everybody for your imput on the spelling<br/>
topic.  I was able to put together some of your posts and send them off<br/>
to my parents.  My mother called me, of course with her own suggestions,<br/>
like is Becca wearing her glasses, etc.?  Never the less, she was able<br/>
to see other peoples views and maybe she&#39;ll be a little more<br/>
understanding of Becca&#39;s poor spelling skills now.<br/>

If you&#39;d like to see Rebecca go into the gallery of stars under Rebecca,<br/>
11.  She&#39;s 13 now and has grown out her bangs, but you can see who she<br/>
is at least.<br/>
     Have to run, its a busy day!<br/>
