<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619112660">Okay, I&#39;m cracking up. I have received several e-mails, in addition to the <br/>
stuff here, from people apologizing for maybe being rude to me about the <br/>
conference dates!!!! LOL  Interestingly enough, none of the people who are <br/>
apologizing said anything obnoxious or rude at all! <br/>
<br/>
I am fine. I am assuming the less kind things were from people stressed about <br/>
possibly not being able to make a conference they wanted to attend. Please <br/>
don&#39;t worry!<br/>
