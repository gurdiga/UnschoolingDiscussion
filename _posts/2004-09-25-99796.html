<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451415100">&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am not above using the fact that other children are rule-bound and<br/>
<br/>
brainwashed by saying something along the lines of &quot;respecting the house<br/>
<br/>
rules&quot; - even though we don&#39;t actually have any! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;A whole different state of mind, and way of communicating with others. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I came up with a rule (in retrospect).  Holly aimed a toy gun at me <br/>
and fired it, and I said, &quot;I don&#39;t like that at all, Holly.&quot;  She asked why, <br/>
and I said it was always the rule that you could only shoot at someone who was <br/>
also playing.  Then I realized she was never a gun-playing little kid, and <br/>
that it had been fifteen years ago since that rule was in effect.  &quot;Same as <br/>
boffers,&quot; I said.  &quot;You don&#39;t hit someone who&#39;s not also holding a boffer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well that&#39;s just common sense, isn&#39;t it? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was the same as the principle (couldn&#39;t have been a rule, but it was <br/>
discussed when applicable) that it&#39;s only playing if everyone&#39;s playing.  As soon <br/>
as someone&#39;s not having fun anymore (feelings are hurt, wants to quit for any <br/>
reason) the other person can&#39;t say &quot;I was only playing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the other person isn&#39;t engaged in the game (whether boffers, toy guns, <br/>
water play, wrestling, teasing) then he&#39;s not fair game.<br/>
