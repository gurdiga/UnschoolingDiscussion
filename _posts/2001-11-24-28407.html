<div id="ygrps-yiv-573145791">*** But, without looking very deeply into the <br/>
particular practices of this<br/>
                      specific company, we suspect it&#39;s doing things we <br/>
wouldn&#39;t choose to do on<br/>
                      our own. Our son will eventually pick up on our <br/>
ambivalence, if we don&#39;t<br/>
                      change something, and will be disappointed in <br/>
us.***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my disclaimer: I don&#39;t say this to pick at you but to make a <br/>
distinction that has been valuable for me in my own life and my <br/>
parenting.<br/>
<br/>
It was a major turning point for me in my life and my relationship with <br/>
my children when I dropped the *for the children* shoulds and went back <br/>
to making my decisions in a broader because-it&#39;s-what-I-think-is-right <br/>
sort of way, rather than because-it&#39;s-what-I-think-is-right-for-the-<br/>
kids sort of way. I hope it&#39;s obvious that since I love my children and <br/>
try to live consciously, the welfare of my children is inherently part <br/>
of any grander scheme.  <br/>
<br/>
I needed to live my own life with passion and attention and intention.  <br/>
What my children needed (and this is an evolution--the balance <br/>
continues to shift as they grow) was to see me actively living my life, <br/>
guided by my own lights...and to have the freedom to do the same.  One <br/>
side of the equation wasn&#39;t as good as attending to both.  Of course <br/>
they also need me to value them, to be available and involved with <br/>
them, and in communication with them.<br/>
<br/>
One of the problems with trying to be a perfect parent was that no <br/>
matter what I did, something would fall by the wayside.  No matter what <br/>
choices I made, there would be something I could look at in hindsight <br/>
and wonder how I might have been able to make a choice that had as many <br/>
good consequences and fewer bad ones.  It left me spending too much <br/>
time ruminating about my current choices without actually making as <br/>
many, and as a consequence it was harder to enjoy life in the present <br/>
and plan for the future.  I was stuck in neutral trying to figure out <br/>
the harmless choice that would propel us all forward.<br/>
<br/>
*That* was awful modeling for my children, I see in hindsight.  ROFL.  <br/>
Didn&#39;t say I was completely cured. :-D  It was more likely to put them <br/>
in a very cautious mindset, trying very hard not to make their own <br/>
mistakes, that may not actually be the best context in which to live <br/>
their lives.  On the other hand, it may have been perfect in its time. <br/>
;-) They aren&#39;t particularly screwed up, and are, in fact, magnificent <br/>
in their own individual ways.  For now, I&#39;m focused in living the best <br/>
life I can because it&#39;s my responsibility.  Not my responsibility as a <br/>
parent, but as a human being.<br/>
<br/>
No matter what we do, we will disappoint our children sometimes.  No <br/>
matter what we do, we will be able to look at their lives and wonder if <br/>
we could have spared them this or that.  I found that for me, it was <br/>
hopeless to try to eliminate that possibility.  That mindset had me <br/>
focusing in small ways that often missed more important issues.  It&#39;s <br/>
made all the difference in the world to just get back to living the <br/>
life *I* need to live.  <br/>
<br/>
If the game of life is fair at all, doing that will suit their needs <br/>
too.  If it&#39;s not, trying to parent perfectly will backfire anyway.  <br/>
Inexplicably, I think both statements are true.<br/>
<br/>
Ambivalence isn&#39;t a bad thing for children to experience...it&#39;s part of <br/>
life, inevitable for thinking, feeling people.  It&#39;s important for them <br/>
to be aware of it, to understand how to receive the gifts it carries, <br/>
and learn to move anyway. I think what is detrimental for children, <br/>
adults, and the world, is when ambivalence becomes a constant, <br/>
predominant state that limits us.  That&#39;s what I always think of when <br/>
Jewel sings, &quot;I won&#39;t be idle with despair.&quot;<br/>

I really like what you say here.  had a lot of medical problems that <br/>
forced my girls to learn household responsibility.  I had to work <br/>
through a certain amount of guilt at the time, but I realize with <br/>
hindsight that the experiences have made them much stronger people <br/>
and taught them that life does not always go the way you want it to.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, my medical problems were a lot of the reason why we <br/>
unschooled from nearly the start of our departure from the public <br/>
school system 7 years ago.  I was flat on my back for about half of <br/>
that first school year.  Now, we don&#39;t even count schoolyears (they <br/>
just have ages) but it was a conflict with me then.  I would have let <br/>
go of it eventually, but the illness made it happen a lot faster.<br/>
<br/>
But it also made me realize that even though I had a responsibility <br/>
to my kids, I also had one to myself.<br/>

because it can&#39;t exitst without it. :) <br/>
