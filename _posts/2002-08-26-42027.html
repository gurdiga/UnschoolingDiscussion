<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404695434">I hope this comes out legibly!<br/>
I&#39;ve listened to the four I was in on and they all came out clearly and seem <br/>
good and  useful!<br/>
<br/>
I will have some tapes with me in Texas and South Carolina when I go there in <br/>
October, but for other people or those in a hurry, here&#39;s this.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t be speaking from the same notes (I try not to) for either of those, <br/>
so it won&#39;t be a direct repeat, although I&#39;m always on that unschooling <br/>
topic...<br/>
