<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396783520">&quot;When I operate out of integrity and clarity as to<br/>
the appropriate decision, not focusing on the money aspect, I am always<br/>
more content with the outcome, even if it means losing money. Money is just<br/>
that - only money. My relationships with my children, and their happiness<br/>
are way more important to me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed your whole post Lee...especially the beautiful real life examples of this integrity and kindness.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I did not always operate this way and am still having to undo some of the damage I inflicted. Trevor has some anger due to my former parenting practices (or at least I blame myself!). Lately, when he gets mad at a sibling for taking something of his, he reacts with anger. I&#39;m sure part of the problem is not having a door he can shut on his room...something we need to deal with, BUT I tell him I&#39;d rather replace ten of the item he&#39;s pissed about than have him get angry at his little sister or brother.<br/>
I tell him that things can be replaced, but I can&#39;t fix their hurt feelings very easily. This reminder seems to be helping him react more calmly. <br/>
The psyche of a person seems to be the disposable thing in traditional parenting practices. Money should never, ever become more important than peace and joy.<br/>

I&#39;m going through the same things at my house.  I&#39;ve done a lot of damage to<br/>
Connor with my mainstream parenting before coming to this list.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
even realize I was doing him harm until I looked at what I was doing/saying<br/>
to him from another pov.  It is so hard to change my (and dh) habits and it<br/>
is slow going.  Just last night dh and I had a conversation about Connor not<br/>
eating over his plate.  He&#39;s 6yo.  This has been an issue for dh for a few<br/>
years now and he&#39;s sucked me into it.  Well, he asked for my advice last<br/>
night.  So I told him I didn&#39;t think it was a big deal.  The floor is<br/>
laminate/faux wood, he is after all, only 6yo and I&#39;m sure the nagging has<br/>
GOT to be driving Connor nuts.  Lol   Oh, and dh wanted Connor to clean up<br/>
the mess he made all by himself.  So that was another thing I said was that<br/>
if the mess was that important to him, he could ask Connor to help clean it<br/>
up.  I told him that messes are overwhelming to clean up all by a 6yo&#39;s<br/>
self.  SO, we are making progress.  But it is ssslllooowww going.  I was so<br/>
proud of myself for being able to tell dh what I really thought and that dh<br/>
listened and took my advice.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and another thing.  Dave (dh) is in the planning stages of building a<br/>
skate ramp for Connor.  Connor is so into skating and biking on ramps.  He<br/>
is just so excited for it.  Well, the other night, Dave tells Connor that he<br/>
expects him to be out there every night to help build it because HE thinks<br/>
it would be good for him to learn to use a tape measure, yada yada yada.  So<br/>
last night I also told Dave that he is making this ramp all about himself<br/>
rather than doing it for Connor.  He didn&#39;t understand what I meant.  So I<br/>
told him that HE wants this and HE wants that.  So he finally GOT it and has<br/>
changed his tune about the whole thing.  He&#39;s still going to build it.  But<br/>
won&#39;t expect Connor to be out there if he doesn&#39;t want to.<br/>
