of Oz.  It was being put on by a group that travels around the state to<br/>
the different schools and produces these cute little performances.  <br/>
The auditions were held at the school, of course,  and when we got there<br/>
they wanted all the kids to sit in a circle on the floor, littlest to<br/>
biggest.   They had this freaky way of quieting the kids down-- the guy<br/>
would clap his hands  1-2---123, and the kids would get quiet and echo<br/>
the clapping.  Weird.  It struck me as very creepy that ALL the kids<br/>
understood this is what they were supposed to do.  <br/>
Anyway,  it was all pretty tedious for the little kids and when Dylan had<br/>
to use the restroom he just got up and walked across the circle.  The guy<br/>
said  something like, hey, you need to sit down, and Dylan told him he<br/>
was going to the bathroom.  The guy said  -  well, you want to raise your<br/>
hand and ask first! -  and Dylan said,   no thanks, I just want to go the<br/>
bathroom...  It was so sweet to me.  He had no idea other people told<br/>
kids when they could pee.  <br/>
He decided not to stay for the rest of the audition and we went to the<br/>
park instead.  That was much more fun anyway.  We did see the production<br/>
and it was good, but I felt sorry for all those kids who had to raise<br/>
thier hand to go potty.<br/>
