    I sincerely apologize to you and anyone else who thought I am trying to <br/>
offer a cure.  Believe me, after trying for 7 years to get pregnant, I know <br/>
that homeopathy will not cure everything.  But I was hoping to say that <br/>
symptoms can be relieved or even eliminated.  Even doctors of homeopathy <br/>
recognize that some illness can also be hereditary.  This may mean that they <br/>
are very deep rooted and may take a long time to heal.  I believe this may be <br/>
the cause of my infertility.  But I also know that my daughter had migraine <br/>
headaches  3 times a week as a small child and she was allergic to many <br/>
different foods which would then bring on migraines, and thru homeopathy she <br/>
is now headache and allergy free.  I would never push anything on anyone - I <br/>
just want to share what has helped me and my family.  If I have offended or <br/>
hurt anyone, please accept my apologies and know that my intentions are pure. <br/>
 Good Luck to you!     jackie</div>
