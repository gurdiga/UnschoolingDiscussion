&lt;&lt; We are early in our unschooling journey -- Jacob is 2 1/2 yrs and Gabriel<br/>
is 4 mos.  I am very passionate about and committed to unschooling our kids,<br/>
DH is a little more skeptical (tho he&#39;ll come around eventually &lt;G&gt;). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I too came to homeschooling and joining a local support group when Joseph<br/>
(now 8) was only 2. Within that year my husband and I were convinced that<br/>
unschooling was the way to go. I think for us, having children so young and<br/>
not near that dreaded &quot;school age&quot; was a good thing. We had plenty of time<br/>
to ask questions, read information and bounce our own ideas back and forth<br/>
without feelig like there was a time limit or having family and well meaning<br/>
friends looking down their noses at us. By the time they all did that, we<br/>
knew what we wanted for our kids and had the answers to shut them up!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Plus so much of unschooling can be seen so clearly when the kids are young.<br/>
The whole child led idea is so easy to see when the kids are walking and<br/>
talking without us &quot;teaching&quot; them to do it. Once they hit school age or are<br/>
already in school, I think it may be harder for some. Getting rid of school<br/>
mentality is harder than some might think. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Welcome.<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t suppose your DS likes doing farm chores and playing with dogs does he?  The wonderful teen who used to help us out as our part-time &quot;farm hand&quot; left this past year for college (she&#39;s such a COOL kid, despite being public-schooled &lt;G&gt;).  She&#39;s a real free-spirit and really loves animals, and we loved having her around -- she worked for us since she was 12.  Having scaled back on our fiber business, we don&#39;t need as much help as we used to (at the moment anyway), but still could use a hand a few hours a week if we found the right self-motivated kid.<br/>

(The one down side to having so many animals -- well, the feed bills are sort of a down side too! LOL)  Fortunately, next year&#39;s conference is practically in our back yards, so we will definitely be attending that one!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to teach school-group classes at a Science Museum, and then at a Demonstration Farm/Nature Center.  The difference in enthusiasm, participation, and general behavior of the children was STRIKINGLY different between public school groups and home-school groups.  Kindergarten and first grade levels were pretty similar -- all the kids were very enthusiastic about the topic matter, readily volunteered answers and suggestions, and were absolute delights to speak with.  By the time 2nd and 3rd grade levels came, the public-school kids were much rowdier, less enthusiastic, and were volunteering less and were much more easily distractable.  3rd and 4th graders were even more so, and there was a scale up to middle school/high school level, where the kids all sat slumped in their chairs and nobody volunteered.  UGH, what a nightmare for a program presenter!!!  But the home-school groups, regardless of the age level, were ALL enthusiastic and increasingly brimming with knowledge and a thirst for learning.  Didn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to see what the reasons for that difference is!<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Plus so much of unschooling can be seen so clearly when the kids are young.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is SO true!  If I&#39;d had any doubts before (tho really, I never did -- 15 years before I even tried to get pregnant I knew I&#39;d be homeschooling my kids, and as soon as I started to read about unschooling, I knew that this was definitely the way to go!), they would have been completely banished just by interacting with my toddler on a daily basis.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Shelly, how many acres do you have?  We live on a farm in West Virginia.  We <br/>
raise sheep and kids (we&#39;re foster parents) and of course veggies and <br/>
chickens.  How many head do you have?  Currently we have 2 angora goats, 2 milk goats, <br/>
2 adult sheep, and 14 lambs.  The sheep population will be less in the fall <br/>
though.  What breed do you raise?  Ours are a motley crew of mixes (mostly <br/>
suffolk, jacob, coopworth.)  Just did most of my own shearing this year...what a <br/>
job!  We have 40+ acres, but probably only about 8 of that is cleared.  <br/>
However, we lease the other half of this farm (the owner lost our half in a divorce, <br/>
we bought it) and it has probably another 15 acres of field/meadow.  I&#39;d like <br/>
to learn more about herding dogs.  Other than a night time enclosure used <br/>
during lambing time, we have no fencing (at this moment) and we basically <br/>
&quot;shepherd&quot; our animals throughout the day (we have no neighbors and the sheep stick <br/>
around on our farm.)<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to your posts! :o) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I so look at unschooling as just the opposite.  I believe that &quot;school&quot; so <br/>
limits your potential.  You are told what to learn and when and how. No one <br/>
celebrates your uniqueness.  Or encourages your individual interests.  <br/>
<br/>
My boys have no fear about learning new things because they have never been <br/>
told that it isn&#39;t their &quot;grade level&quot; or isn&#39;t &quot;age appropriate.&quot;  They <br/>
explore anything and everything at times.  LOL.  Unschooling is so non limiting.<br/>

I was not very courageous about being &quot;out&quot; about this with my in-laws<br/>

my intentions and didn&#39;t mention it to my in-laws until he didn&#39;t start<br/>
kindergarden.  It was helpful to me that my husband was strongly in<br/>
favor of unschooling.  Has your dh had the opportunity to meet<br/>
homeschooled or unschooled kids, like at a local hs support group?  As<br/>
you experienced, it&#39;s pretty clear overall that homeschooled kids are<br/>
bright and emotionally healthy.  They are the most convincing &quot;sales<br/>
pitch&quot; I think we can ever have for homeschooling.  Giving your dh some<br/>
first hand experience with these kids could be very persuasive.<br/>

I think you should calligraph this, frame it and send it to them:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I used to teach school-group classes at a Science Museum, and then at a <br/>
Demonstration Farm/Nature Center.  The difference in enthusiasm, participation, <br/>
and general behavior of the children was STRIKINGLY different between public <br/>
school groups and home-school groups.  Kindergarten and first grade levels were <br/>
pretty similar -- all the kids were very enthusiastic about the topic matter, <br/>
readily volunteered answers and suggestions, and were absolute delights to <br/>
speak with.  By the time 2nd and 3rd grade levels came, the public-school kids <br/>
were much rowdier, less enthusiastic, and were volunteering less and were much <br/>
more easily distractable.  3rd and 4th graders were even more so, and there was <br/>
a scale up to middle school/high school level, where the kids all sat slumped <br/>
in their chairs and nobody volunteered.  UGH, what a nightmare for a program <br/>
presenter!!!  But the home-school groups, regardless of the age level, were ALL <br/>
enthusiastic and increasingly brimming with knowledge and a thirst for <br/>
learning.  Didn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to see what the reasons for that <br/>
difference is!&quot;<br/>

sister, 15, who had dropped out of high school (or been thrown out--there was <br/>
contention, as the principal had met her in the hall, going to find her to throw <br/>
her out, when she met him at the corner on the way to his office saying &quot;I <br/>
quit&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
I was going to the University of New Mexico, which is &quot;the big&quot; state <br/>
university here.  They wouldn&#39;t take her without her being the age of graduation.  <br/>
But Highlands University, a smaller state school (the former &quot;normal school&quot;) <br/>
did take her on probation, so that her staying there would be based on her <br/>
performance there.<br/>

That was way pre homeschooling-awareness.  It was, though, in New Mexico, <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People were amazed at how quickly I seemed to absorb so much about <br/>
unschooling and totally &#39;get it&quot; so quickly.<br/>
<br/>
But the reason was that I&#39;d been immersed my whole life in early <br/>
childhood education stuff which opposed early academics and put a huge <br/>
value on child&#39;s play and supporting young children&#39;s own innate <br/>
curiosity and love of learning. I was an early fan of David Elkind (The <br/>
Hurried Child, Miseducation, etc.) and  I&#39;d already said, a MILLION <br/>
times, &quot;Why can&#39;t my kids just keep learning the way they have been? <br/>
WHY does everything have to change suddenly when they hit school age?&quot; <br/>
I&#39;d kept my kids out of school as long as I thought possible -  I&#39;d <br/>
moaned and groaned about it a lot - and then suddenly on the AOL <br/>
message boards there were Sandra and a bunch of others saying things <br/>
just like Mary wrote above and I just went WOW WOW WOW - these people <br/>
not only thought what I did, they acted on it!!! It was real. It was <br/>
amazing. I wasn&#39;t 100 percent convinced, not instantly, that they would <br/>
learn without any formal structure imposed by me and we did a couple of <br/>
unit studies first. For 4 weeks we did &quot;oceans&quot; and we had fun -- we <br/>
drew different kinds of whales - real size - with chalk out in the <br/>
street, listened to sea chanteys and made up, read &quot;The Cay&quot; and its <br/>
prequel, looked at different artists and paintings of oceans and ships <br/>
and such, went to Sea World, made science equipment and took it to the <br/>
beach with us (underwater viewers, plankton nets, etc). It was really <br/>
very fun. Then we did the American Civil war - because Roya and Rox had <br/>
just read Across Five Aprils and were into Civil War stuff. That was <br/>
okay - but not as much fun as going to the beach and Sea World, etc. <br/>
&lt;G&gt;. We did go to a civil war re-enactment which was cool. That was it <br/>
- by the end of that month the kids were busy with their own interests <br/>
and I couldn&#39;t find a good time to interrupt them to do another unit <br/>
study. So we really started unschooling the 3rd month of homeschooling.<br/>

 unit studies first.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was always pretty amazed with myself (I&#39;m allowed every now and then!)<br/>
when I got the unschooling idea from very early on. I think it was because<br/>
of a few things. Not in any particular order.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I had talked about our schooling lives a lot. He hated<br/>
school, wasn&#39;t good at it and was pretty much labeled loser there. He became<br/>
part of the party group and just passed by to graduate. The only thing about<br/>
school he did like was the friends he had and the fun they had skipping and<br/>
hanging out. I on the other hand, learned how to maneuver the system for me<br/>
to get through quite well. Making the grades came easy for me without trying<br/>
much and I learned how to get on the good side of most of my teachers. High<br/>
school was easy for me but I still hated it every step of the way. Most of<br/>
the subjects bored me to tears and I had no interest in them whatsoever. The<br/>
ones I did like I could only go so far in so I didn&#39;t &quot;lose&quot; the rest. I<br/>
hated the little school groups and popular and unpopular people put in them.<br/>
I didn&#39;t hang with many at all.<br/>
<br/>
Tara at a very young age showed how extremely inquisitive and intelligent<br/>
she could be. She was an awesome kid, and when I &quot;had&quot; to put her in<br/>
preshcool, I saw that slowly get squashed. Elementary school was even worse<br/>
and this bright energetic kid was turning into mush before my eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Thirdly, I had a very unscooling family right in front of me when I first<br/>
joined a support group. Her kids were already between 14-17. So it was very<br/>
easy for me to see how it all worked. She asked the same question over a<br/>
lot. Why??? Everytime someone wanted to do something or thought something<br/>
should be a certain way, she would ask why? I started to see how some people<br/>
couldn&#39;t answer that and some gave it great thought. It made sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
So between that family, us seeing what was happening to Tara and our own<br/>
experiences in school, all the while watching Joseph and Sierra thrive on<br/>
just being kids, it was inevitable for us to get it all. We were lucky. I<br/>
just wish I would have known about this years ago. I mean way long ago. Not<br/>
sure I could have kept Tara home because of her dad, but I sure would have<br/>
given it a try.<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of that, Miss Tara, big advocate of school, just yesterday<br/>
announced that she could have very easily, looking back now, given up school<br/>
all through junior high. But says she wouldn&#39;t want to miss high school.<br/>
Hey, there may be hope for my grandchildren yet!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031627333">Cal Poly State University in San Luis Obispo (the only state U. I know<br/>
about since that&#39;s where I went) requires a declaration of major from<br/>
anyone applying, freshman or transfer, so that they compete only against<br/>
those in their major for admission.  Like I said, though, this school<br/>
has some highly competitive departments.  I am sure there are many state<br/>
universities that would happily accept a freshman with no transcripts of<br/>
high school or college.<br/>
I completely agree of course that high school is not necessary for<br/>
college (having not gone to jr. high or high school).<br/>
The intriguing cover letter would probably work very well for many<br/>
schools!  Only problem with that would be schools (like Cal Poly) who<br/>
have a points-based system for admissions, awarding points for certain<br/>
classes completed, certain test scores, certain extra-curriculuar<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554592366">Hi Nancy, nice to meet you!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Shelly, how many acres do you have?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>15, but most are still wooded.  (I told you it was a SMALL farm! LOL)  Not nearly enough pasture, we were working on clearing and then the kids came along so made that a lot more difficult.  We will most likely be moving to a larger piece of historic family property (57 acres) eventually (all depends on how cooperative the family is about letting us live an unhindered lifestyle).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We live on a farm in West Virginia.  We <br/>
&gt;raise sheep and kids (we&#39;re foster parents) and of course veggies and <br/>
&gt;chickens.  How many head do you have?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I currently have 15 adults and 10 lambs.  But some of the adults will be sold, some of the lambs will be eaten, etc.  I prefer to keep 15 or less thru the winter, as the cost of hay is ridiculous.  At times I&#39;ve had as many as 30 total, but that&#39;s really too many sheep for this property.<br/>
<br/>
We also have laying hens (14) and ducks (also 14, but 5 are being sold).  I&#39;m currently down to a minimum number of angora rabbits (10), but at my peak production kept my level at around 50.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What breed do you raise?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was raising Border Leicesters -- started with Corriedales (and didn&#39;t like them), moved to BLs and Romneys (and crosses of the two), but I just liked the BLs better.  At this point, I&#39;m selling off the rest of my BLs and converting to Katahdins, which are a hair sheep (don&#39;t produce wool), because they are easier to care for and I don&#39;t need the wool since I&#39;ve basically shut down the fiber business for the next few years.  When I get back into wool sheep again I&#39;ll go with a rare breed -- both because there will be more demand for my fleeces, and also because I&#39;ve become intersted in Conservation Genetics.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Just did most of my own shearing this year...what a <br/>
&gt;job!  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>:-)  I sheared my own until I got pregnant with Jacob (even then I still sheared a few myself).  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;d like <br/>
&gt;to learn more about herding dogs.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m always happy to talk about herding and shepherding! :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Other than a night time enclosure used <br/>
&gt;during lambing time, we have no fencing (at this moment) and we basically <br/>
&gt;&quot;shepherd&quot; our animals throughout the day (we have no neighbors and the sheep stick <br/>
&gt;around on our farm.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, you don&#39;t have any predation problems??  We grazed unfenced areas with the dogs controlling them for quite a while until we got all of our open area fenced in -- will need to do it again when we move to the larger property.  You can manage sheep (especially a small number) fairly well without dogs, but once you&#39;ve done it with dogs you get lazy &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Will look forward to discussing sheep and homesteading and raising kids with you! :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-653030164"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Has your dh had the opportunity to meet<br/>
&gt;homeschooled or unschooled kids, like at a local hs support group?  As<br/>
&gt;you experienced, it&#39;s pretty clear overall that homeschooled kids are<br/>
&gt;bright and emotionally healthy.  They are the most convincing &quot;sales<br/>
&gt;pitch&quot; I think we can ever have for homeschooling.  Giving your dh some<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Betsy, that&#39;s excatly what I plan on doing. :-)  I have no doubt once he&#39;s had a chance to experience kids and parents that actually have taken this approach to learning that his hesitations will dissappear.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;G&gt;  Thanks, Sandra!  You actually reminded me to read it to DH!  I haven&#39;t expressed MY reasons for wanting this to him recently, so when I read what I wrote about why I want to do this to him, he said he&#39;s sure I&#39;ve told him that before but it didn&#39;t really sink in.  <br/>
<br/>
In the past he&#39;s said that he&#39;s not confident in HIS teaching skills -- he doesn&#39;t see the difference between teacher and facilitator yet.  But he&#39;s not done the reading and thinking about this I have.  He generally has a fairly open mind, he&#39;ll come around! :-)<br/>
