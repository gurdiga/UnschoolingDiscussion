<div id="ygrps-yiv-70102866">&lt;&lt; I agree with you.  I just joined this group and I&#39;m really about ready<br/>
to leave already!<br/>

<br/>
Then talk about unschooling!!!<br/>
<br/>
Is it the job of others on the list to present all the information?  You give <br/>
US your current thoughts, or ask questions, or tell unschooling stories.<br/>
<br/>
Worse than discussing politics is discussing whether we should be discussing <br/>

<br/>
Any participant on this list who is disappointed with the subject at hand has <br/>
the power to change the subject.<br/>

&quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>
