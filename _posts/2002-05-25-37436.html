<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646703105">&lt;&lt;By the time our kids are using computers in work<br/>
situations, excel <br/>
spreadsheets and Access databases, etc., are pretty<br/>
likely to be passe.<br/>
<br/>
I was once a cobol and fortran programmer. Fat lot of<br/>
good that does me <br/>
now &lt;<br/>
BEG&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
--pam&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But Pam, and all... Doesn&#39;t the manipulation of older<br/>
programs help with today&#39;s programs?? I started in<br/>
good ol DOS before the Web was a household name..<br/>
Before the web had pictures and flash and Java and<br/>
all... It helps to know what is happening behind the<br/>
scenes that a lot of people don�t even know is even<br/>
there ... I think children should be taught<br/>
extensively on today�s computers because it will only<br/>
be harder to fix/work with later.. Kind of like<br/>
talking to a new born.. Its important.. <br/>
<br/>
I have a professor that moved to AK .. He started<br/>
working on computers at the age of 60 because the<br/>
college required that e-mail was done and that the<br/>
reports came out in a specific WP format... That was<br/>
when he couldn&#39;t &quot;get over&quot; by using a good old<br/>
fashion typewriter, Mercy!! And I&#39;ll tell you it is<br/>
mighty difficult to explain to him what went wrong<br/>
knowing he has absolutely no background with programs<br/>
and how they work.. <br/>
<br/>
PMFJI with out saying HI.. But I just got passionate<br/>
over this subject... <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My Fortran experience hasn&#39;t helped me much with the object oriented<br/>
languages they use now. HTML was fine. (Not object oriented of course.) But<br/>
Java and JavaScript still baffle me.<br/>
<br/>
In fact it might be better for someone to start off fresh without the<br/>
preconceived -- and now obsolete! -- notions of how things supposedly work.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I started in<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Doesn&#39;t Windows still use DOS? Behind the scenes at least. Seems to me those<br/>
little start up and whatnot files had DOS commands in them. (I have a Mac<br/>
but have been forced to use PC&#39;s every once in a while.) And why things are<br/>
done the screwy way they&#39;re done is for DOS purposes, isn&#39;t it? So, that&#39;s<br/>
not really old knowledge, just masked knowledge! ;-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think they should be allowed access to computers as soon as they&#39;re<br/>
interested, just as I made language freely accessible to my daughter without<br/>
teaching and without expectations that she needed to learn anything in<br/>
particular. I was confident she&#39;d learn what she needed by using language<br/>
for what she needed it for.<br/>
<br/>
Same with computers I think. :-) They&#39;re a useful tool that kids will use<br/>
for their own useful purposes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And I&#39;ll tell you it is<br/>

&gt; and how they work..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s funny, my father, who is an engineer, has always gotten mechanical<br/>
things so quickly and I think he&#39;s been frustrated that he didn&#39;t pick up on<br/>
computers like a fish in water. He&#39;s had them for years and does use them<br/>
but it isn&#39;t a natural. He still isn&#39;t connected to the internet and isn&#39;t<br/>
quite sure why he&#39;d want to.<br/>
<br/>
But my father in law who barely knows which end of the hammer to use jumped<br/>
from a typewriter to a word processor to a computer (just 3 short years ago)<br/>
as the need arose. He searches the internet, orders things on line, emails<br/>
and sends attachments. And he now even has his own webpage. His attitude of<br/>
&quot;just show me *one* way to do this *one* thing&quot; would not fill anyone with<br/>
confidence that he would embrace technology at all. But he&#39;s also got a fax,<br/>
answering machine, cel phone and a beeper. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So a lot, I think, has to do with need and a willness to try new things<br/>
rather than early training. I suspect my father just doesn&#39;t have a need the<br/>
way my father in law does.<br/>

Nah.<br/>

Allowed to use?<br/>
<br/>
Sure.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t deny it to them - we have 6 computers in this house &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
But children are naturally curious. Repeat: Children are naturally curious.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll wonder about computers and programming and it&#39;ll come up and if they <br/>
have responsive, supportive, aware, helpful, resourceful adults around, <br/>
they&#39;ll learn a LOT about how they work. No &quot;lessons&quot; necessary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-452946465">I really don&#39;t believe one needs to understand the workings behind the<br/>
scenes of computers in order to use them. I use a microwave but if something<br/>
goes wrong, I call someone to fix it. I know enough to take off the tin foil<br/>
so it doesn&#39;t spark, I know how to defrost chicken breasts using the<br/>
semi-complex button combos and timers, and I now know to put a small wooden<br/>
spoon into a cup of water before heating it to boiling.<br/>
If my modem stops working I can use the help command to discover what kind I<br/>
have and bring that info to the repair person. Why do I HAVE to learn more<br/>

many, many years ago, he told me that in order to be a competent driver the <br/>
most important thing I should know first of all is what to do if the car <br/>
doesn&#39;t work.  He actually walked me through this.  He said: &quot;If the car <br/>

for your wallet, pull out your triple-A card, and call for help.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He has a great sense of humor, but the point is we don&#39;t have know the <br/>
inner workings of a thing (unless you WANT to) to be able to use it well.<br/>

changed to Goddess.  The manager even put it on my name tag!  The <br/>
reason for the title - I was the only one there with a natural <br/>
affinity for computers so if something didn&#39;t work, they called the <br/>
goddess.  I kept telling them it was no big deal, and some of the <br/>
stuff that baffled them was such a shock for me.  I&#39;d sometimes just <br/>
have to walk up front and push two keys to &#39;fix&#39; their problems.  Mind <br/>
you, these were not stupid people either.  One of them had a PhD in <br/>
liturature, one of them was still in college and was making the honor <br/>
roll every semester.  But computers just plain scared them.<br/>

toddler and needed to pick up my oldest somewhere at a certain time (I <br/>
forget where, only that we needed to be there).  I was struggling to <br/>
get those lug nuts loose when a trucker stopped and helped.  I let him <br/>
but then when we got the tire fixed I wouldn&#39;t let the guy at the <br/>
service station put it back on.  I took it home and did it myself so I <br/>
 would be sure that I *could* do it if I had too.<br/>

is the visual, language based medium the is intimidating rather than the<br/>

Those were the days when anytime I went into a computer store I&#39;d do a<br/>
simple little program on the computers there (10 print Eat a Bug 20 Goto<br/>

computer magazines, so we could play games really simple games...<br/>

about &#39;84 to &#39;94, and everything changed ... when I got back it was<br/>

spend money on taking kids to movies and going to Barnes and Nobles) when <br/>

whatever the problem is (with a little research of course) without dishing <br/>
out all of that money to take your computer, or whatever to the shop to get <br/>
it fixed. You realize after paying for a &quot;fix it man&quot; to fix the (what you <br/>
thought was a big problem) problem, the problem may have been some dust <br/>
accumulating on the fan, the battery in the system clock needed to be <br/>
changed, you just need to clear your cache...other little things. <br/>

I guess because of my background with wiring and things of that nature I am <br/>
more inclined to know what is going on with things. I know how to build <br/>
computers, add memory, install software, and all of that good stuff. I would <br/>
like for my kids to have that knowledge as well. ONly 4 of my boys are <br/>
interested in doing so (one of those four includes the baby). My 2 oldest <br/>
boys are in the process of gathering all of the information they need to <br/>
build gaming computers. I am behind them 100 % It is so funny, my oldest son <br/>
can&#39;t wait for something to break down so he can take it apart and &quot;try to <br/>
fix it.&quot; Usually he does a good job. I remember when the Nintendo didn&#39;t play <br/>
games any longer, he got his screw driver and went in that little box and <br/>
moved some things around...whatever he did, I am not sure...but he got it to <br/>
work. I think that opened the doors for him. <br/>
<br/>
I love knowing how things work. Maybe that is why I am so crazy now...TO <br/>

great fun.  It was a tiny Timex-Sinclair   It came with 2k of memory<br/>
and we bought a 16k upgrade for it, that was nearly totally useless.<br/>
It was a big cube that plugged into an expansion slot on the back and<br/>
would work loose while you were typing, causing the system to crash.<br/>
It had no storage device, so you were forced to type in any programs<br/>
you wanted to use every time.  Sigh.....  We upgraded from that to an<br/>
Atari 400 when it came out.  WOW!  What a great machine!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
However, back to the topic of the original post.  I feel that having<br/>
access to a computer and whatever software the kids are interested in<br/>
is vital.  Games are great teachers if we allow them to be.  We do not<br/>
have to teach the kids, we just have to be willing to allow them to<br/>
access what they want (within reason, of course) and be willing to<br/>
also allow them to solve their own problems that arise.  As for<br/>
spreadsheets and databases, the basic function of these programs has<br/>
not changed over the years.  I find that I can move from one package<br/>
to another with little problem.  I have had no formal computer<br/>
training, only a great fascination with the technology and a lot of<br/>
curiosity as to how it can be manipulated to do what I want.  This has<br/>
caused me to spend a good deal of time and energy learning on my own<br/>
and as result, I am able to be quite productive with my machine.  Why<br/>
would our kids not be the same?<br/>
<br/>
Do your children express an interest in computers?  Do they want to<br/>
play games?  I find that allowing my 13 year old son his own computer<br/>
and allowance to buy his games as he can has taught him many useful<br/>
things.  (logic, money management, troubleshooting strategies, and<br/>
many other of life&#39;s lessons)  To my way of thinking this is<br/>
unschooling at it&#39;s best.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That point could be debated either way, but I think for people trying to get<br/>
unschooling it&#39;s helpful to see that there *is* a difference between<br/>
teaching and learning.<br/>
<br/>
Most people come to unschooling with the mindset that teaching and learning<br/>
are inseparable. And teaching means a teacher leading someone along a<br/>
particular pathway to a particular destination. In order to get unschooling<br/>
it&#39;s helpful to have the false connection between teaching and learning<br/>
severed so people can start bulding a new model of learning.<br/>
<br/>
So calling &quot;making yourself available&quot; teaching might be a fun debate about<br/>
the malleability of the English language, I think it might just be confusing<br/>
for people trying to get the concept of learning without teaching. The<br/>
important part of the process that new unschoolers need to grasp is the<br/>
central core to learning is what happens inside the learner, not whatever<br/>
the teachers (passive or otherwise) are doing outside the learner.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that the environment isn&#39;t important in unschooling. It&#39;s very<br/>
important. But it&#39;s getting someone to the point of view that learning<br/>
happens from the inside reaching out rather than the outside pushing in that<br/>
helps people get unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-908390380">Last episode Anji Henderson &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:vual77@...">vual77@...</a>&gt;, had this to say:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The audio tape was what the original Atari and Commodore machines had<br/>
as well.  The 5 1/4&#39; drive was an amazing invention to all of us!  The<br/>
30 + minutes it took to save a program was reduced to a few seconds.  <br/>
<br/>
The Timex-Sinclair had no storage device, only 2k of ram (internal<br/>
memory) with an option to expand to 16 k of ram. The 16 k module was a<br/>
box that plugged into the expansion slot on the back of the computer<br/>
and was bigger and heavier than the computer itself.  (The computer<br/>
was about the size of today&#39;s palm computer.)  When you think of our<br/>
machines with 128 meg and up being standard, it is amazing that 2k<br/>
would do anything, but it did.  We had to type in each program we<br/>
wanted to use every time we turned on the machine as when you turned<br/>
it off, the program was gone!  I still can not believe we actually<br/>
bought the thing!<br/>

to help guide when they need us.  &quot;Did you try looking on the web site<br/>

&lt;&lt; When my very mechanically-inclined brother taught me how to drive those <br/>
many, many years ago, he told me that in order to be a competent driver the <br/>
most important thing I should know first of all is what to do if the car <br/>
doesn&#39;t work.  He actually walked me through this.  He said: &quot;If the car <br/>
doesn&#39;t start, you pop the hood and take a look at the engine.  Then, reach <br/>
for your wallet, pull out your triple-A card, and call for help.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He has a great sense of humor, but the point is we don&#39;t have know the <br/>
inner workings of a thing (unless you WANT to) to be able to use it well. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a great story. &lt;g&gt;  I want a brother like that.<br/>
<br/>
My dad thought it was important that I know how engines worked and he <br/>
convinced me to rebuild a VW engine with him.  EEEEYEW.  It was miserable.  <br/>
He rebuilt it with me holding the oily parts gingerly and trying to <br/>
concentrate on what he was saying.  My driver&#39;s ed teacher, too, went through <br/>
all KINDS of detail about how linkages and pumps and hoses and filters <br/>
worked.  I suppose it helped.  At least when I hear noises or feel grindings <br/>
I can say &quot;transmission&quot; or &quot;fuel system.&quot;  But that&#39;s like knowing a stomach <br/>
cramp from a muscle twinge.  It&#39;s not hugely useful all by itself if I don&#39;t <br/>
know what to do NEXT.<br/>
<br/>
But that theory about not needing to know how to build or fix it to use it <br/>
well applies to musical instruments, VCRs, writing (gerunds!?), gardening, <br/>
sports...  Not every great jock is an expert on physics or anatomy or the <br/>

this terrific book, which I still have.  It&#39;s called Everything I Know <br/>
About Cars Would Just About Fill a Book, by Stephanie Judy.  The book <br/>
allowed me to learn about the way cars really work without having to get me <br/>
fingernails black (not that that would bother me all that much).  The <br/>
advantage was that mechanics were not able to take advantage of me too <br/>
badly because I could speak intelligently about what I thought might the <br/>
matter.  I could give the car a sort of preoperative diagnosis, and the <br/>
mechanic could see that he wouldn&#39;t be able to pull the wool over my eyes <br/>
too badly.<br/>

To tie this into unschooling, I know I never would have wanted to take an <br/>
automechanics class in school, but when he gave me that book, I read it <br/>
cover-to-cover and gobbled it up (it helped, I suppose, that the book was <br/>
well written, well illustrated, written for someone like me, and very funny).<br/>
<br/>
I still have the book, but I just saw that if you want to buy it on Amazon, <br/>

retired from public school teaching) gets exasperated with me. She says that <br/>
creating a learning environment and supporting children as THEY learn is the <br/>
very best kind of teaching and that I&#39;m one of the best teachers she&#39;s ever <br/>
known. It drives her crazy that I want to NOT call that teaching.  <br/>
<br/>
SHE gets the difference between the &quot;fill their heads with stuff I think they <br/>
should learn&quot; kind of teaching versus what we do in my family. But she also <br/>
thinks that the &quot;work&quot; that I do -- having conversations, helping the kids <br/>
find resources they need, taking them to interesting events or activities, <br/>
etc., is simply &quot;the best kind of teaching under ideal circumstances.&quot; <br/>

will come to unschooling like my mom did -- seeing it as a logical extension <br/>
of what she says the very best teachers know really is best for kids -- <br/>
minimally invasive education &lt;G&gt;. (As the Hole in the Wall project guy called <br/>
it.)<br/>

&lt;&lt; When I say that I didn&#39;t &quot;TEACH&quot; my children to read, my mother (recently <br/>
retired from public school teaching) gets exasperated with me.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This same Pam who wrote that used to needle and poke at me, years ago, when I <br/>
said I wasn&#39;t teaching my kids to read.  &quot;You must be doing SOMETHING.  What <br/>
are you doing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I persevered. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She says that <br/>
creating a learning environment and supporting children as THEY learn is the <br/>
very best kind of teaching and that I&#39;m one of the best teachers she&#39;s ever <br/>
known. It drives her crazy that I want to NOT call that teaching. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s facilitating learning.  That&#39;s the terminology which can make the <br/>
difference in how homeschooling parents make their decisions and comfort <br/>
themselves.  &quot;Teachers&quot; have certain rights and duties which &quot;learning <br/>
facilitators&quot; do not.<br/>
<br/>
When learning facilitators are employed by a school and get <br/>
teacher-paychecks, then they are the best kind of teachers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But if homeschooling parents insist on thinking of themselves as teachers, <br/>
all the history of &quot;teacher&quot; and every vision of a teacher in their <br/>
conscious, subconscious, and Jungian brains *WILL* color that and slant it <br/>
toward control and guilt and martyrdom and responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
If they look at their children as active learners, and focus on that, then <br/>
they will connect what they are doing with all the happy learning visions in <br/>
their multi-level brains, and with all the happy learning instances and <br/>
opportunities in their internal model of the universe, and that will be <br/>
freeing instead of limiting.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Teacher&quot; points at one spot.<br/>
&quot;Learner&quot; points at the infinite number of other spots.<br/>
