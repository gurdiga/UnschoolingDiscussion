<div id="ygrps-yiv-757836927">The July/August Life Learning magazine arrived here today.<br/>
<br/>
Last issue, some people were disappointed at the anti-TV and anti-computer <br/>
messages which appeared not just in one place in the issue, but three (I think).<br/>
<br/>
This time, the editorial says :<br/>
&quot;The theme of this issue--kids&#39; rights and adult control over kids&#39; <br/>
lives--snuck up on me gradually, then eventually had to whack me on the side of the <br/>
head, in order to get my attention.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Turns out most of the issue concerns letting kids do more.<br/>
<br/>
I have read big chunks, but not all of it yet, but wanted to let people know <br/>
this!  <br/>
If you don&#39;t subscribe, this might be one well worth buying in person.<br/>
<br/>
A letter from Robyn Colburn was published, and it&#39;s a great letter.  It&#39;s <br/>
followed by a letter in favor of the same thing Robyn had questioned, the <br/>
anti-computer position.<br/>
<br/>
The end of the second letter (which I&#39;m guessing the author will re-think <br/>
after she reads this current issue) was<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I say, everything in balance, in its own developmentally appropriate time.  <br/>
However, I am not about to let my two-year-old child play in traffic in the <br/>
name of freedom; nor will she have unfettered use of electronic media until she <br/>
can make that decision for herself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
[I jumped off from that to a decision-making topic, so I&#39;ve cut that and will <br/>
start a new thread instead of going so far off topic.  But Life Learning!  <br/>
Exciting new issue.]<br/>

I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s me - Coburn not Colburn - if so, thanks. I&#39;ve never had<br/>
a letter to an editor published before. I was emboldened to send if after a<br/>
discussion here.<br/>
