<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522674628">-=-I have a question.  My son&#39;s friend told him about an experiment <br/>
<br/>
using bleach and kerosene.  I told him it was too dangerous.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is this unschooling?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is telling him it&#39;s too dangerous unschooling?<br/>
It&#39;s parenting.<br/>
Is it the best parenting you could do?<br/>
I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
Neither do I think buying him some kerosene and handing him the bleach would <br/>
be good parenting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Thanks for the advice.  My son is not interested enough right now to <br/>
<br/>
do the research on his own.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good solution either.<br/>
<br/>
If it were me, I&#39;d ask the boy who gave him the advice what happens.  If it&#39;s <br/>
a dangerous explosion or toxic gas, or if the answer is &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; I <br/>
would tell him not to ever tell anyone else to mix those chemicals again, ever.  <br/>
If he seemed receptive, I&#39;d leave it at that.  If he were defiant, I&#39;d talk to <br/>
his mom.<br/>
<br/>
But as to finding out what happens, I bet a quick google search would turn up <br/>
some interesting information, which you could share with your son, and all <br/>
would be happy and positive.<br/>
<br/>
Making him look it up is punitive and doesn&#39;t teach joy in research.<br/>
Telling him &quot;It&#39;s too dangerous&quot; doesn&#39;t teach him anything except &quot;maybe <br/>
mom&#39;s right, maybe mom&#39;s wrong.&quot;  You don&#39;t want him mixing the chemicals later <br/>
to see, do you?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Because I told you so&quot; wouldn&#39;t be on my top-200 messages for unschooling <br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now that google makes research so easy, I feel about this the same way I feel <br/>
about making a kid look a word up instead of just telling him how to spell <br/>
it, or telling him &quot;it&#39;s in the encyclopedia&quot; if he asks something about history <br/>
or geography.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s here,<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://SandraDodd.com/aradicalthought">http://SandraDodd.com/aradicalthought</a><br/>
but it&#39;s short [quote to the end]:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Never tell a child &quot;Go look it up.&quot; Parents, teachers, friends and <br/>
countrymen, how would you like it? <br/>
<br/>
When a child wants to know why flowers have a scent, they want someone to say <br/>
&quot;To attract bees&quot; not &quot;GO LOOK IT UP.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Go look it up&quot; tends to mean &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;I know but I&#39;m not going to <br/>
tell you.&quot; What&#39;s the advantage of that?<br/>
<br/>
Either a child will opt NOT to look it up (and the trust in the parent will <br/>
erode a little) or he will, under duress, perform this task which might be <br/>
difficult for him, or might take so long that he doesn&#39;t care anymore (and the <br/>
trust in the parent will erode a little).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m NOT saying to discourage kids from looking things up. I never said not to <br/>
show kids how to look things up. I mean don&#39;t treat it like something parents <br/>
won&#39;t do, parents don&#39;t have to do, but that kids do, or that kids have to <br/>
do, because they are powerless kids.<br/>
<br/>
Encyclopedias should be alluring, not forbidding. Dictionaries should be a <br/>
playland, not a dark, scary place you dart into for one thing and slam shut <br/>
behind you. If you believe they ARE fun, you should look things up in front of <br/>
your children, often, and with enthusiasm. That will teach them how to use <br/>
reference materials, and will make them want to do so, because they will see it as <br/>
something useful and enjoyable that adults do. If you believe dictionaries and <br/>
encyclopedias ARE dark, scary and forbidding, why on EARTH would you send your <br/>
children there?</div>
