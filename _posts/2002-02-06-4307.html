Hi all, <br/>
<br/>
Not to be a downer or anything, but my Mom died this morning at 4:30am. It&#39;s <br/>
been an intense few days...it&#39;s good to come here and feel connected to <br/>
something outside of my family for a minute! A side distraction can be <br/>
helpful sometimes. <br/>
<br/>
The funeral is Saturday and I would really like to share Jan&#39;s poem with my <br/>
family. I had copied it and lost it in the rush to get up here. <br/>
<br/>
I tried to e-mail you Lisa, to ask for you to send it again, but I don&#39;t <br/>
think the e-mail went through. <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m here asking for it again!! Thank you in advance. <br/>
<br/>
And thanks for the kind words Dee. I am a bit overwhelmed with &quot;always <br/>
learning&quot; e-mail digests and think I&#39;ll just put it off for another day!! Too <br/>
much to think about right now, everything seems a bit surreal, YK? <br/>
<br/>
I keep expecting her to walk up the hall any moment...my mind hasn&#39;t accepted <br/>
that I won&#39;t see her again even though I watched her slipping away in the <br/>
hospital. <br/>
<br/>
I suppose it will sink in when I don&#39;t get anything in the mail for my <br/>
Birthday this year...ugh. <br/>
Mother&#39;s day will never be the same, will it? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to be here much for a bit...but it does my heart good to skim <br/>
through the posts and feel a bit more connected!!! <br/>
<br/>
Take care everyone, <br/>
Ren <br/>
