<div id="ygrps-yiv-300263624">Group, <br/>
<br/>
Lately there have been many posts that have referred more to parenting<br/>
concerns than schooling (or unschooling). Many people whose children are<br/>
still under five seem to believe that they need to start in on some sort of<br/>
schooling, even UNschooling, whatever that might be to them, when what they<br/>
are mostly asking about needs to be understood/seen as parenting, not<br/>
schooling. <br/>
<br/>
Children need decent (or, if possible, excellent) parenting. Some of the<br/>
comments I&#39;ve read here reveal that many parents today need parenting<br/>
themselves AND definitely need parenting training. For that, I suggest going<br/>
to your library and get the help that your own parents did not provide for<br/>
you on how to raise a small child. Years ago, Luz and I read &quot;Parent<br/>
Effectiveness Training (PET) and learned a lot. There surely are many new<br/>
books that can help with the fundamentals of getting along with and caring<br/>
for our own small kids.<br/>
<br/>
Children&#39;s needs are amazingly basic, but are urgent. They need to know that<br/>
someone is protecting them from harm, hunger, cold, falling out of windows,<br/>
getting stuck in things, etc. After that (once they feel safe), their need<br/>
is to PLAY. Play is a child&#39;s way of finding out about the world. Schooling<br/>
does not provide that knowledge, so the main thing after basic maintenance<br/>
is play. Therefore, when parents have got the maintenance down, they simply<br/>
need to take the next step for their child: Providing (safe) access to the<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You asked (in 2124) for resources to help you begin to unschool. Understand<br/>
that unschooling is usually a practice of NOT doing schooling... Unschooling<br/>
is not a &quot;technique&quot; of schooling. It is THE ABSENSE of schooling. Once we<br/>
learn the real dangers and deficits of doing schooling to children, then we<br/>
can begin to learn how to raise a child so that s/he takes charge of his/her<br/>
own learning, and we can simply stand by and help with access and admire the<br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
Luz and I have put together a packet of info for parents who wish to<br/>
unschool their kids. If you&#39;d like the whole thing, send an email and we<br/>
will return it to you right away.  If you just want the list of books that<br/>
we believe are helpful (helped us raise our son) here is that excerpt from<br/>
the packet: <br/>

<br/>
We are extremely partial to John Holt&#39;s books since he was our own major<br/>
inspiration, and was such a beautiful writer and expressed his admiration<br/>
for children so clearly.<br/>
<br/>
The lesson we learned from Holt was that children are born learning and are<br/>
built to do it. They don&#39;t need to be made to learn or shown how. Recently,<br/>
someone wrote that Kids are HARDWIRED to learn. We agree strongly.<br/>
<br/>
We also believe that discipline is something children have at birth, it is<br/>
not something that needs to be taught, let alone pounded into a child. I<br/>
believe that those who use the word &quot;discipline&quot; to describe what they do to<br/>
their children, should use the word &quot;punish&quot; instead. I do not believe that<br/>
children are &quot;spoiled&quot; by good care and/or kindness, ever.<br/>
<br/>
As for Scout&#39;s other question, about family and friends who will not<br/>
understand. ---- Since your child is still far from &quot;school age&quot; there is<br/>
time to prepare those people for what you&#39;ll be doing. First, if they don&#39;t<br/>
support you, they&#39;re not your friends (family or not).<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, your job is to fully understand what you&#39;re doing yourself. If<br/>
you&#39;re sure about your own practice, it will show to everyone and there<br/>
should be much less of a problem and less need to explain the details. A few<br/>
of the basic facts are these: Going to school is a waste of valuable time;<br/>
School does not educate, it indoctrinates; there is very little that&#39;s<br/>
taught in school, and even less that&#39;s learned -- most learning happens<br/>
outside of schools; the biggest lesson that schools teach is &quot;You are not a<br/>
good learner!&quot;  Another strong lesson is this: Your opinions and needs are<br/>
not important, so sit down and be quiet.<br/>
<br/>
Once your &quot;friends and family&quot; learn some of those facts, they might see<br/>
things more in your way.<br/>

Thank you for your response. Obviously, I know we have time to <br/>
research and learn as much as we can before the time when we have <br/>
to &quot;register&quot; our plan with the state, etc. I began by joining a <br/>
local group of homeschoolers here in StLouis that use a Yahoo group <br/>
listing such as this. It has been very helpful in giving me ideas <br/>
about the many different avenues to take with helping your children <br/>
learn and homeschooling. I believe that unschooling is where my <br/>
interest lies. I would appreciate the info packet you spoke of in <br/>
your email. Is it an email thing or should I send you postage? <br/>

read some of your articles this week. Thank you for all of your <br/>
