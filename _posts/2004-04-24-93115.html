<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593595156">The title got lost, and I&#39;m veering away anyway.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I suppose it would then be a question of which is more damaging for each <br/>
child&#39;s situation...school or a bad home-life. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But even a so-so homelife can be worse than school for some kids.  Depends on <br/>
the kids.  Depends on the school.<br/>
<br/>
I was much better off in school than I would have been home with my mom.  <br/>
<br/>
I was thinking this morning at the grocery store that if I couldn&#39;t <br/>
homeschool anymore for some reason, Holly wouldn&#39;t mind a bit going to school.   <br/>
Kirby&#39;s too old to matter anymore.  Marty&#39;s almost legal drop-out age (or maybe is) <br/>
so he&#39;s on the cusp.  And my thoughts wandered on over to the range of <br/>
homeschoolers, the stereotypes (and all stereotypes are based on something, they <br/>
don&#39;t come out of nowhere), and what school would do to my kids or vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
All my kids would have been good students.  Marty would have been better in <br/>
sports and math than language-related stuff, probably; same as his dad, <br/>
dyslexic leftie.  Holly would have been popular and succeeded in music and sports if <br/>
she had an interest in either, and probably be a straight A student.<br/>
<br/>
School hurts even kids like that, but because it wouldn&#39;t crush the life out <br/>
of them, I could live with them going to school, and it wouldn&#39;t be as bad <br/>
because they wouldn&#39;t have me and their dad shoving from the other side saying <br/>
&quot;The teachers are right&quot; and &quot;No allowance until your grades are up&quot; or &quot;No <br/>
music or TV until your homework is done.&quot;   We could buffer their experiences.<br/>
<br/>
But if I had a child who was physically handicapped, or had a serious speech <br/>
defect, or was even an FLK (funny-looking-kid, used by special ed teachers of <br/>
kids with head deformations from forceps or injury or fetal alcohol syndrome; <br/>
not all of them are brain damaged, but sometimes there are brain damage <br/>
situatios that show in the formation of the head),  I would not subject him to that <br/>
hall of doom.    <br/>
<br/>
One of the saddest things I ever hear (and I&#39;ve heard or read it lots) is in <br/>
an account of a child who is terminally ill or has a condition that shortens <br/>
life, it seems they always work in before the article or interview is over that <br/>
the child is going to go to school so his life can be as normal as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Why go to school if you&#39;re about to die?  Why not Italy?  The Bahamas?  <br/>
Disney World?<br/>
<br/>
And then the question is why go to school if you&#39;re going to live?  <br/>
<br/>
But given all imaginable factors, unschooling isn&#39;t for everyone and school <br/>
won&#39;t destroy EVERY child.<br/>
