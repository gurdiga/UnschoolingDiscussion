<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Shannon typed...<br/>
&gt; His mother and I have decided that unless one of them is bleeding, broken<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; unconscious that we don&#39;t really want to hear - he did this, he did that<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know that it is the best way to handle it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a (home schooling, with school each day) friend who I talk to on<br/>
the phone.<br/>
<br/>
One time over a year ago, we were chatting away, and her kids came to her<br/>
crying, and she said ,&quot;Unless you&#39;re bleeding, or something is broken, I<br/>
don&#39;t want to hear it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At the time, I htought that was hilarious.  Now I&#39;m disgusted at my<br/>
reaction.  I said it to my own chidlren the next day, and it was just<br/>
gross.  Really?  I&#39;m only interested if they&#39;re bleeding?<br/>
<br/>
The doesn&#39;t sound like the kind of parent I would like to be.<br/>
<br/>
In the battle situation...I&#39;m not entirely sure what I would do, having<br/>
not really come up against this before.  I think there is a big difference<br/>
between a 5 year old and a 10 year old, in regard to size, strength and<br/>
maturity (amongst other things).<br/>
<br/>
I would probably discuss with both children about the need to keep each<br/>
other safe, while still having fun...such as, drawing back before the<br/>
point of contact.<br/>
<br/>
I would also let my little son know that whatever problem, or joy he wants<br/>
to share with me is important to me, a lot more so than chatting with a<br/>
friend.<br/>
<br/>
If my children are hurting (or ecstatic), then they want me, and I want to<br/>
be available to them...no matter what.<br/>

----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Holly has a piercing scream that disturbs all adults within hearing  <br/>
range.  She&#39;s had it since birth.  When she was little we would  <br/>
always run in when she screamed, expecting something HORRIBLE to be  <br/>
happening.  We didn&#39;t want to tell her &quot;never scream,&quot; because if  <br/>
she&#39;s being attacked or abducted, that scream by itself could save  <br/>
her, and because it was SO effective getting attention, we had to ask  <br/>
her to limit it to REAL emergencies.  We said &quot;If someone&#39;s hurt  <br/>
badly, or bleeding, scream.&quot;  But we would say &quot;not cool&quot; about  <br/>
screams involving frustration about another child not giving her a  <br/>
toy, or anything like just screaming for fun on the swingset.<br/>
<br/>
My mom had a policy that if someone tattled and the other kid got a  <br/>
spanking, the tattler got one swat for tattling.  It didn&#39;t last  <br/>
long, because we talked to her and said that wasn&#39;t fair.   You might  <br/>
think &quot;duh!&quot; but she had grown to adulthood having not tattled on her  <br/>
brother who raped her and the died of a fever not long after, and it  <br/>
warped her view of the virtue of not tattling, I think.   We were  <br/>
also being punished for disturbing her from whatever she was doing  <br/>
and having to deal with children.  None of that showed much compassion.<br/>
