<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323163567">Welcome Faith!<br/>
Many factors go into the sibling relationship, but I notice that<br/>
schooling families I know tend to often say &quot;the children need time apart<br/>
from each other&quot;.  Now mine are young, so I may change my views later,<br/>
but...  It seems that as children grow and develop interests and friends<br/>
that time away from their siblings will occur as a result of that.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think I need to put a lot of energy into artificially creating<br/>
separate spaces for each child.<br/>
My $.02!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m sure this brings siblings closer and we end up with a tight-knit<br/>
 </span></blockquote>family instead of only spending a few hours in the evenings together, IF<br/>
THAT!! (With as much homework as ps send home!!!)&gt;&gt;<br/>
