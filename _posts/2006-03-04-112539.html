moderating my desire for, say, junk food, tv, spending too much on<br/>
books, spending too much in general, chocolate, etc. -=-<br/>
<br/>
WHY do you have those desires?<br/>
Did your parents limit your access?  Did they make you eat what was  <br/>
on your plate?<br/>
<br/>
If you think back through how you experienced those things as a  <br/>
child, and your attitudes and behaviors now, that might help you see  <br/>
it not as a fact of life, but as a response to environment.<br/>
<br/>
Most people have never met anyone who wasn&#39;t raised with various  <br/>
levels of limits, requirements, shaming messages and control.<br/>
<br/>
I have three children who were not so limited, and they are all teens  <br/>
(14, 17, 19).  They have NO problem spending too much on their  <br/>
hobbies, they don&#39;t eat too much chocolate or junk food (hardly any,  <br/>
honestly).  They don&#39;t watch TV as much as their critics predicted  <br/>
they would.  They COULD, but they don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Their choices are made in whole new waysï¿½in thoughtful ways, and  <br/>
mature ways, and rational ways.  I eat for comfort; they don&#39;t.  I  <br/>
spend money because it makes me feel better; they don&#39;t.  They aren&#39;t  <br/>
needy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-and here in this unschooling life it would seem that such  <br/>
restraints are not encouraged.-=-<br/>
<br/>
In the face of wide-open choices, decisions are made differently.   <br/>
They never have to think &quot;What can I get away with before the jailer  <br/>
returns?&quot; or &quot;How much chocolate can my id stuff in before my super  <br/>
ego starts reciting the rules about the evils of chocolate, and  <br/>
before my guilt kicks in?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here are some good things from past discussions:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Joyce, of food, wrote<br/>
-=-When there are controls on food and then you let go of the  <br/>
controls, the kids will want lots of things. It&#39;s like being on a  <br/>
strict book ration and then let loose in a book store with $1000 ;-)  <br/>
But once they realize they can have anything they want, they don&#39;t  <br/>
want just for the sake of being able to have it. They just ask for  <br/>
what they want.-=-<br/>

Robyn Coburn wrote something pretty clear on the effects of  <br/>
restrictions too, and it&#39;s here:<br/>

Holly has twice in the past week turned down offers of purchases.   <br/>
She&#39;s careful with her own money and careful with other people&#39;s  <br/>
too.  She&#39;s not needy.   This writing, on being respectful of  <br/>
children, addresses that:<br/>
