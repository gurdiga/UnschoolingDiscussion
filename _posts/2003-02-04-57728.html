it up on the wall. Are your scouts Wolfs or Tiger Cubs? Anyway, pick out a <br/>
badge or some insignia that they are familiar with and make copies. The <br/>
object is to pin the badge in the correct spot on the drawing of the scout.<br/>
<br/>
Relay races: Have kids divide into 2 teams. Have them hop on one foot from <br/>
one side of the room to the other while holding a peanut in a spoon. <br/>
Alternately, have them get down on all fours and blow the peanuts, or perhaps <br/>
something a little heavier.<br/>
<br/>
Kids form a circle with one person in the middle blind folded. The non-blind <br/>
folded kids  speak and the one in the center has to guess who it is. If he is <br/>
right, the person who is recognized has to get in the center.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067574287">&quot;A cooperative musical chairs came:&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I liked the frogs on lily pad idea.<br/>
We have played cooperative musical chairs in the more common fashion, like <br/>
the non-cooperative version.<br/>
You remove a chair each time but not a kid. They have to pile onto less and <br/>
less chairs until everyone is trying to get on one chair (usually falling off <br/>
and laughing hysterically by that point)<br/>
<br/>
Cooperative hot potato:<br/>
When the person is caught with the &quot;hot potato&quot; (use a ball) they go to a <br/>
separate circle (the hot potato circle) and they are the ones that call hot <br/>
potato for the other group.<br/>
After there are two children in the hot potato group (or more) they decide <br/>
among themselves what they will count to before they all yell hot potato.<br/>
Eventually everyone joins the hot potato group.<br/>
<br/>
Human Tic Tac Toe:<br/>
draw out a large grid OR use nine chairs to represent the tic tac toe board.<br/>
Have the players line up in two teams. X&#39;s cross their arms O&#39;s circle arms <br/>
over heads and one player at a time (from alternating teams) places <br/>
themselves on the board.<br/>
You have one team that wins but it&#39;s a lot more cooperative than the regular <br/>
version.<br/>
<br/>
Hope these help. Have fun!!<br/>
