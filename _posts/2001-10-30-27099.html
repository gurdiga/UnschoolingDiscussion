<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304749689">Okay enough sight . . . but there is no EVIDENCE to support wny of it&#39;s<br/>
conclusions and it perpetuates the myth that you cannot believe in<br/>
evolution and intentional design or god at the same time.  You can.  Who<br/>
are we to say how god can or cannot work?<br/>
<br/>
I am more than willing to examine issues and unusual takes on things but<br/>
I do ask for some evidence when you say for example that the lunar<br/>
landing didn&#39;t happen.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Actually *I*  prefer the old stuff------especially the stuff in the &quot;undated&quot;<br/>
issues that JH  deliberately used solely numbers rather than dates to identify<br/>
because he did not want folks to think the info and ideas were too<br/>
&quot;old-fashioned&quot;  or &quot;out-of-date&quot;.<br/>

&gt; Okay enough sight . . . but there is no EVIDENCE to support wny of it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; conclusions and it perpetuates the myth that you cannot believe in<br/>
&gt; evolution and intentional design or god at the same time.  You can.  Who<br/>
&gt; are we to say how god can or cannot work?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am more than willing to examine issues and unusual takes on things but<br/>
&gt; I do ask for some evidence when you say for example that the lunar<br/>
&gt; landing didn&#39;t happen.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Actually *I*  prefer the old stuff------especially the stuff in the <br/>
&quot;undated&quot;<br/>
issues that JH  deliberately used solely numbers rather than dates to identify<br/>
because he did not want folks to think the info and ideas were too<br/>
&quot;old-fashioned&quot;  or &quot;out-of-date&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Bummer it risked violating law. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
(Unless in the small print in the publication notice it had the date of <br/>
publication.)<br/>
<br/>
Home School Digest didn&#39;t date some of their issues (might still not) and the <br/>
publisher was listed as God or some such.  Not quite &quot;rendering to Ceasar,&quot; <br/>
post-office- and publication-speaking.<br/>
<br/>
But yes!  The old stuff has some actual John Holt.  And the old stuff is more <br/>
vibrant to me, because there was more uncertainty.  It was the dirt road with <br/>
the ditch and the salamanders, instead of the wider paved road over culverts, <br/>
no dips, street lights and road signs.  Billboards.  <br/>
<br/>
But there was  a time when I depended on GWS for my lifeline to the greater <br/>
world of unschoolers, when Kirby was five and six.  I&#39;m thrilled that it <br/>
existed.  I&#39;m sorry I gave away some of my back issues, EXCEPT that they <br/>
might have changed the lives of another family or three.  I hope.<br/>
