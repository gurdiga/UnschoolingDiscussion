&lt;&lt; BTW, I personally think the anti-weapon woman is being discourteous to <br/>
 come to a group and insist it be her way, anyway. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I agree. I woudn&#39;t change the group for one person...if everyone was <br/>
fine with the weapons before her, then it&#39;s her choice to join in or not. But <br/>
it isn&#39;t fair for her to try and ban something everyone else was happy with <br/>
.....ridiculous.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They don&#39;t do all the badge work in the meetings. And most girls do not earn <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; all the badges. There are a lot of them! If there are some you just don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; want your daughter doing, you could just mention it to the scout leader. <br/>
&gt; They could either not do that badge in group,  or your daughter could skip <br/>
&gt; that particular meeting.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And - the leader has to judge the girls and parents. I would not have had 9 <br/>
yo&#39;s discussing dating situations, but 12 yo&#39;s, yeah maybe, depending on the <br/>
girls. DISCUSSING them with each other -- things they&#39;ve read in books or <br/>
seen in movies? Seems like a good idea to me.  My kids don&#39;t &quot;absorb&quot; stuff <br/>
said by other people - kids or adults - as if it is truth, so I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
worry about that. IF I didn&#39;t want my daughter exposed to ideas different <br/>
than my own, or only on my own time schedule, I&#39;d definitely keep her out of <br/>
Girl Scouts, because part of the program is definitely to explore <br/>
relationships and personal behavior, etc. <br/>
