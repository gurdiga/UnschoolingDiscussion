<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133549905">Some research is being done as to the relationship to &quot;their&quot; soy and &quot;our&quot;<br/>
soy.  The relationship may be to the chemicals that are in &quot;our&quot; soy<br/>
products and relatively unseen in &quot;their&quot; soy products.<br/>
<br/>
There is also another study being done that appears at this time to indicate<br/>
that what may work for some ethnic groups will not work as well for other<br/>
ethnic groups.  The reasoning behind that is that in certain ethnic groups<br/>
there is no history of a certain food product being &quot;unknown&quot; and not being<br/>
part of the diet for thousands of years thus when it is introduced it is<br/>
something the body sometimes see as an &quot;enemy&quot; or the body doesn&#39;t know how<br/>
to react to it or properly process it.<br/>
<br/>
There is a high incidence of obesity and diabetes in the First Nations<br/>
peoples.  The rates are double and in some areas even higher than that of<br/>
the &quot;white&quot; population.  The link appears to be &quot;commodities&quot; foods.  When<br/>
returned to a historical diet the rate drops dramatically.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240951574">I have read that the soy products in Asia differ from what is produced here, and that the hormone amounts are much lower in Asian tofu.  I got this from another list, though, so I can&#39;t cite any specific research.  I&#39;ll try and see what I find.<br/>
