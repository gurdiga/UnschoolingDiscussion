<div id="ygrps-yiv-518406810">As I&#39;ve shared before, my daughter and I are really into this project <br/>
of getting petitions signed so that scooters and skateboards aren&#39;t <br/>
banned.  Well, we figured that in order to get finished in time, we <br/>
need to work some during the day, even when dh isn&#39;t home to watch <br/>
the boys (ages 5 and 3).  <br/>
<br/>
Sunday we tried and had to quit after the first block.  They couldn&#39;t <br/>
stop fighting.  They were loud and fighting and uncooperative, and it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have made a good impression on anyone we&#39;re asking to sign.  <br/>
I pulled them in the wagon, had drinks and snacks along.  I explained <br/>
to them that I was doing this so they could keep riding their <br/>
scooters (even they like their scooters).  When we got home, dd cried <br/>
and cried about not being able to get the petitions done, told her <br/>
brothers she couldn&#39;t stand them, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I was frustrated, because I wanted to help all my kids do what they <br/>
wanted.  My daughter desperately wanted to be out doing this, my boys <br/>
obviously did not.  <br/>
<br/>
Some days I&#39;m able to take them to my mother in law&#39;s, which they <br/>
like.  I can&#39;t do that every day though.  <br/>
<br/>
So we tried it again today.  I offered them change for their coin <br/>
country ( a book that helps kids save their change, and when it&#39;s all <br/>
filled up they have $20).  My 5 year old really wants to fill his <br/>
coin country up because he knows he&#39;ll be able to buy a Thomas engine <br/>
when it&#39;s filled.  The deal was that if they didn&#39;t fight and let dd <br/>
and I knock on doors, they would get the change.  Again, I pulled <br/>
them around in their wagon and they had juice cups along. We didn&#39;t <br/>
even get to finish the block this time, they were so bad.  Again, dd <br/>
is upset, crying that we&#39;ll never get done, telling her brothers that <br/>
she&#39;ll never play with them again, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m at the peak of frustration now.  My son just came up to me <br/>
whining about something and I just had to tell him that I was really <br/>
upset right now and couldn&#39;t talk at the moment.  I felt bad doing <br/>
that, but I didn&#39;t know what else I was able to do...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440340872">How about let your daughter work on making signs? I bet places like the library, local gas stations, and other local businesses would let her put a sign up asking people to contact whoever it is that is pushing for this law, and tell them that they are against it. That would get the news of the bill out and hopefully get more objections to it pouring in, it would be something constructive for her to do so she doesn&#39;t feel like she&#39;s just waiting around doing nothing, and when she&#39;s done with a bunch, you can load all the kids up in the car and let her run the signs into stores and ask to put them up while you wait outside with the boys. If you don&#39;t mind putting your phone number on it, it could even have people contact you to add their names to the petition. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sitting a small wagon together for a while while mom and big sister<br/>
do the &quot;important stuff&quot; sounds like a recipe for getting<br/>
frustrated. How about your daughter pushes the four year old in the<br/>
stroller while you pull the wagon? Or is that too much for her? That<br/>
way, the five year old could get out and walk at times if he needed<br/>
to. Maybe he could carry a sign that says, &quot;Kid&#39;s for skateboards!&quot;<br/>
;)<br/>
<br/>
My youngest is a homebody too. Doesn&#39;t mean she can&#39;t have a good<br/>
time when we go out, just means it takes a bit more work on my part. <br/>

Separate wagons?  Borrow one that your nine your old can pull?  Or would<br/>
they fight about who had the better &quot;ride&quot;?<br/>

Mica, I&#39;ve seen the book mentioned before on this list.  I went ahead <br/>
