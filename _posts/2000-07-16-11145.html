<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; people having trouble keeping the weight off and I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t imagine all these eggs and meat products can<br/>
&gt; be good for your cholesterol levels. Oh well, I<br/>
&gt; guess no diet is perfect. LOL.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the thing. On Protein Power diet you don&#39;t have<br/>
to watch your fat in take. I know because I lost 5 in<br/>
off my waist alone (I didn&#39;t measure my tighs) in sex<br/>
weeks. I had more energy and felt better than I had as<br/>
a teen. I actually got bored around my house. I did<br/>
this eating bacon, eggs, steak, etc. It does caution<br/>
the colleterol in eggs, the easy remedy is to eat more<br/>
whites than yolks. At bed time I always have a snack.<br/>
I started eaging scrambled eggs instead of toast. I<br/>
used 6 eggs and only 2 yolks so I ate no carbs at<br/>
bedtime filled up on protein and wasn&#39;t worried about<br/>
the collesterol. For lunch I would often eat either<br/>
tuna or egg salad. With the egg salad I would use the<br/>
6 eggs again throwing away 4 yolks and put in celery<br/>
and onion and whatever seasonings I wanted and serve<br/>
it in a letuse bowl. With the tuna I would core out a<br/>
tomato and fill it with the tuna  salad and then eat<br/>
it like an apple. It was delicious.  Corallyn.<br/>
