<div id="ygrps-yiv-664818494">I beat my mom at Trivial Pursuit last night!  First time ever.  Whoo-hoo!!<br/>
<br/>
Now, what does that have to do with unschooling, you ask?  Well, I&#39;ll tell you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never done terribly well at that game, although I enjoy it, because there are certain categories that I avoid like the plague -- certain that I&#39;m not going to be able to answer their questions.  Very limiting perspective, that, and a sure-fire system for losing.  Resoundingly.  Consistently.<br/>
<br/>
We played for the first time in at least a couple of years last night, and I led most of the way -- barely losing the first game, then winning the second.<br/>
<br/>
The difference?<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t afraid of any of the categories (well, okay -- Entertainment still gets me).<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
Because I&#39;ve been learning alongside my Liam for the past two years, and my world has just opened up!<br/>
<br/>
Science and Nature questions have become my new favorite category.  &lt;wow -- I&#39;m definitely an Arts & Literature kind of girl&gt;  That&#39;s his main interest.  He must have been experiencing quite a bit of brain expansion over the past two years, if I&#39;ve picked up that much simply by listening to him talking about it!<br/>
<br/>
I even knew what tree grows in English churchyards.  Do Yew?  &lt;g&gt;  That&#39;s because of fantasy reading we&#39;ve done, and the fact that I remembered that the yew is the tree most sacred to the Druids.<br/>
<br/>
So, there!<br/>
