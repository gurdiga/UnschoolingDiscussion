<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295121899">&lt;&lt;there have been documented cases of children whose parents are deaf and<br/>
cannot speak and the children developed their own language&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if there was more than one child or they heard language from people<br/>
other than the parent.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen no documented cases of feral children learning language.<br/>
