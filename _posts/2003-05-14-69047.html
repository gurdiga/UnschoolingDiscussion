The poor kids come to me and say they want to stay at our house.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s where what we&#39;re doing is even more insidious than the educational <br/>
aspect.  We have free kids and we haven&#39;t had to decency to move them away <br/>
from mainstream society where their freedom won&#39;t be an attractive nuisance.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Attractive nuisance&quot; is a legal term for dangerous things like swimming <br/>
pools and big trampolines that people might have in their yards.  And you <br/>
have a legal obligation to lock them up so others can&#39;t get to them, if you <br/>
don&#39;t want the legal responsibility for the damage done by people coming into <br/>
your yard against your will and being injured.<br/>
<br/>
Laws develop gradually in any case-law situation, and this one crawled up <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
So I think being an unschooling family in a &quot;normal&quot; neighborhood might be <br/>
considered &quot;an attractive nuisance,&quot; socially.    We have something <br/>
mesmerizing and the neighbor kids want it.  And they play in it, and they go <br/>
back home with a profound disappointment they never would have had if our <br/>
families had been as dour and controlling as theirs.<br/>
<br/>
They might never be happy at home and in school again.<br/>
<br/>
Did we MEAN to do this?  I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s kind or good.<br/>
I think it&#39;s necessary for social change to occur, but there is so much <br/>
associated discomfort in the meantime, it honestly makes me sad to think <br/>
about its effects on innocent others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969495561">Wow,  never heard of &quot;attractive nuisance&quot;,  I guess that&#39;s probably <br/>
what we are to them then.<br/>
<br/>
I do try and keep my own personal space with the Mom and Dad <br/>
though,  it is just better that way.   We have some real differences <br/>
on lots of sujects and I think it would totally make living so close <br/>
unbearable.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve already inflicted their rules on my home when their kids are <br/>
here.   I really don&#39;t know what to think of that.   At some point <br/>
I&#39;m going to have to talk with my kids more about this.<br/>
<br/>
If I allow their kids to play video games or watch TV when they&#39;re <br/>
here,  they may not allow them to come over anymore.    I know my <br/>
daughter would really be sad about that.<br/>
<br/>
Its a very hard situation.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve had skateboard ramps in our driveway for several years, so I&#39;m <br/>
totally aware of the &quot;attractive nuisance&quot; thing!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve lost some friends over my children&#39;s freedom.  People don&#39;t <br/>
always want their kids to know how good their lives could possibly <br/>
be.  It *is* sad.<br/>
