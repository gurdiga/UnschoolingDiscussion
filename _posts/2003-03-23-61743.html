<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600123894">first thanks everyone for game links they sent for<br/>
walkthroughs.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I am a little irked when a gal in a hs chat<br/>
piped up and disapproved of my son (13) playing <br/>
playstation.<br/>
I had mentioned the games name, and how he was<br/>
having difficulty with the first level.<br/>
And told her that he had purchased the game with his <br/>
own money.<br/>
She than wanted to know if I would allow him also<br/>
to have drugs and prorn?<br/>
<br/>
She let me know that her husband had won a playstation<br/>
and they sold it. The funny thing is he works for Sony.<br/>
They don&#39;t have a TV, even though some of the kids were older.<br/>
No TV?, I can respect what ever their wishes are. <br/>
<br/>
But in this house there are 4, including one in each childs bedrooms<br/>
and one hooked up to a playstation.<br/>
I very seldom montiored what the children watched. And if I had<br/>
to do it all over again I wouldn&#39;t change a thing. I feel kids need<br/>
to make their own choices in TV selection. <br/>
You monitor too closely, you get little zombies.<br/>
And bet your life,  when you are gone, don&#39;t tell me they are<br/>
going to watch only what you want them to watch.<br/>
Maybe this might exlude children of early ages.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was thinking of that last night during all this conversation. LOL<br/>
I really guess some people wouldn&#39;t like it that our<br/>
oldest(9)sometimes play EVERQUEST (also now owned by SONY) which is<br/>
a role playing online game.{somewhat like D&D} <br/>
We do watch over, just because there are real people playing, but<br/>
there are rules that limit language and though there is cool<br/>
eye-candy, there are no graphic graphics. <br/>
There is a lot she has learned from it. (encouraged reading, group<br/>
cooperation, split second reactions, ... etc)<br/>

No TV?, I can respect what ever their wishes are.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Really respect it?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you do.  I don&#39;t think you should.   <br/>
<br/>
All this &quot;I respect your choices&quot; that people say to be polite can be totally <br/>
thought free.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to call the police because my neighbors spank, but I don&#39;t <br/>
respect it.  If the kids ever come to me for help, I&#39;ll at least talk to <br/>
their parents.  In the absence of big injury or cry for help, I won&#39;t <br/>
interfere.  But I sure don&#39;t respect it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe saying you accept their right to have those wishes is closer.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t throw your respect around too easily!<br/>

Some people aren&#39;t very smart.<br/>
Unfortunately for ME, a lot of them are homeschooling and so when people meet <br/>
me and I say &quot;homeschooling,&quot; more often than not they&#39;re thinking of someone <br/>
with that little mentality.<br/>

for doing it. <br/>
Most of the time I use the word &quot;respect&quot; meaning the definition; a<br/>
courteous regard for people&#39;s feelings<br/>
&quot;in deference to your wishes&quot;; &quot;out of respect for his privacy&quot;<br/>
<br/>
not as:<br/>
 a courteous expression (by word or deed) of esteem or regard<br/>
&quot;his deference to her wishes was very flattering&quot;; &quot;be sure to give<br/>
my respects to the dean&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046066743">I homeschool my 5 yo daugter and she watches Smurfs,<br/>
G. I. Joe, Ed Edd & Eddy, Courage the Courdly Dog, and<br/>
more.  She plays with our Playstation, and even<br/>
listens to Eminem and Pink.  In fact her favorite<br/>
movies are the Tremors trilogy and Eight Legged<br/>
Frieks.  The only things that I sensor from her is<br/>
mild to extreme violence, sex and gore.  I grew up<br/>
with all of the above in a Baptist house hold in<br/>
public school and I turned out just fine.  My parents<br/>
sheilded me from very little.  How your children turn<br/>
out directly relates to how you as a parent raise<br/>
them, not what they watch on TV, hear on a radio, or<br/>
the video game they play to pass the time.  Get off<br/>
your soapbox.  That is just a copout.<br/>
