<div id="ygrps-yiv-865898412">Reading some of these posts about personal freedoms, etc. <br/>
reminded me of Toni Morrison&#39;s book for children, &quot;The Big Box&quot;. <br/>
She wrote it along with her son when he began having problems <br/>
at school. If you haven&#39;t read it, it&#39;s great. Here&#39;s a quote from the <br/>
book: &quot;...But if freedom is handled just your way, then it&#39;s not my <br/>
freedom, or free.&quot; <br/>
