You may laugh, but my Mom vacuumed all of our cats every week. The poor dears had to get used to it, Mom did it from the time they were very little and most of them learned to love that nozzle being rubbed over them...silly, but effective in a house with several cats.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563905179">This is cracking me up.  Our cat (the remaining 8yr.old if you have <br/>
been reading about the pets and death) used to not mind the vaccuum, <br/>
even going so far as chasing the nozzle and sitting on the canister.<br/>
Well, I had the brilliant idea to vacuum him one day and now he runs <br/>
for the hills when he hears it start up.  Won&#39;t ever be able to do <br/>
that again.  Ugh the pet hair!  Oh well.<br/>
