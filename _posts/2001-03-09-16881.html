Welcome to the 21st century! Homeschooling is growing faster than <br/>
ever, and with this comes new challenges and opportunities. With this <br/>
in mind, we present one of the hottest speakers on the homeschooling <br/>
circuit: Cafi Cohen, author of And What About College, Homeschooling <br/>
the Teen Years, and her newest book, Homeschoolers&#39; College <br/>
Admissions Handbook.  Cafi will enlighten, energize and inform us <br/>
with her decades-long experience as a homeschooler and national <br/>
speaker. Joining us this year will be our featured speaker, Larry <br/>
Bangs, a veteran homeschooler going back to the 60&#39;s. Larry is owner <br/>
of Wildridge Software, and has won numerous awards for his innovative <br/>
and integrating approach to learning. Larry&#39;s speech will focus on <br/>
the importance of integrating diverse subjects in order to understand <br/>
the whole.<br/>
<br/>
Joining us this year are perennial favorites, including Barbara Klein <br/>
of The Learning Community; Nancy Plent of the Unschoolers Network; <br/>
Manfred Smith, founder of the Maryland Home Education Association; <br/>
Billy Greer of FUN Books and NCHE, a teen panel of long-time <br/>
homeschoolers, and experienced adult homeschoolers who will be <br/>
leading workshops and helping to make this a day a special one for <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
