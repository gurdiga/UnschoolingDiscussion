<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645882184">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
Work on a new book begins, this time focused on the first year in<br/>
homeschooling. To this end, I turn to the vast pool of homeschooling<br/>
experts across the country ? YOU! - who will receive a complimentary<br/>
copy when your ideas are included.  So that we can show the variety of<br/>
ways people homeschool, Im looking for ideas from many people on<br/>
several different topics outlined below.  Please feel free to respond to<br/>
one or several of them ? the skys the limit!<br/>
<br/>
RESPOND TO:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ldobson@...">ldobson@...</a> with the appropriate subject line. If<br/>
you are answering two different topics, please send separately with the<br/>
appropriate subject line. OR Snail Mail:  Linda Dobson, POB 85, Rainbow<br/>
Lake, NY  12976<br/>
Either way you respond, please include your name, city and state of<br/>
residence, and information on how I may contact you, if necessary<br/>
(phone, address, and ? best - email).<br/>
<br/>
DEADLINE:  June 1, 2000.  But don&#39;t delay!  Your contributions to this<br/>
advocacy are appreciated as the priceless gifts they are.  Please feel<br/>
free to share this message with your friends and support group.<br/>
<br/>
EMAIL SUBJECT LINE:  First Year Wish<br/>
What one thing do you wish someone had told you during your first year<br/>
of homeschooling?<br/>
Hope everybody answers this one!  Be brief, be long. Be funny, be<br/>
serious; share what youve learned.<br/>
<br/>
EMAIL SUBJECT LINE:  Learning Activity<br/>
Share a learning activity your children really enjoyed ? science,<br/>
history, games, in the car learning games, backyard games, spelling,<br/>
math, painless trigonometry - WHATEVER!  From tots to teens!  Provide a<br/>
brief description of the activity, what you feel your child(ren) got out<br/>
of it, and your child(ren)s reaction or results.<br/>
<br/>
EMAIL SUBJECT LINE:  Hurdles Overcome<br/>
 Share a story or two about a first year problem you had to overcome in<br/>
order to homeschool. Include (but please dont be limited to!) deciding<br/>
to work or not to work, creating a business at home, learning to<br/>
simplify, working out a schedule (even if it means homeschooling from<br/>
midnight to 3 AM!), continuing special services from the school, missed<br/>
friends, no chance at sports participation(this list could be endless!)<br/>
<br/>
EMAIL SUBJECT LINE:  Homeschoolings Diversity<br/>
Helping readers get a &quot;feel&quot; for the following approaches.  Your note<br/>
should include the approach you use, whether or not your children were<br/>
in school prior to homeschooling, and  a brief explanation of why you<br/>
chose this route.   Ill contact you for more info!<br/>
1)  Traditional school-at-home<br/>

school)<br/>
8)  Independent co-operative learning situations<br/>
9) Did I forget any?  Let me hear about it!<br/>
<br/>
EMAIL SUBJECT LINE:  Common First Year Experiences<br/>
Giving readers a heads-up on what to expect.  Your note should include<br/>
concrete examples of the experiences you have now learned are fairly<br/>
common to beginning homeschoolers.  Please note if you:<br/>
1) Started at the beginning (with a youngster who never went to school)<br/>
OR<br/>
2) Brought a child home from school<br/>
<br/>
EMAIL SUBJECT LINE:  Why I Came to Homeschooling<br/>
Helping readers understand the many reasons families choose<br/>
homeschooling. Your note should include a brief explanation of whether<br/>
or not your children were in school prior to homeschooling and your own<br/>
familys situation at the time of your choice.  Ill contact you for<br/>
more info!<br/>
1)  Proactively ? thought homeschooling was a great idea, wanted to<br/>
spend time with your kids, for whatever reason find philosophical<br/>
agreement with the approach, aware that public schools are succeeding in<br/>
their intended results, etc.<br/>
2) Reactively ? came to homeschooling as a reaction to dumbed-down<br/>
academics, safety concerns, bullying, &quot;new assessment stress,&quot; or other<br/>
reactions to a public school education.<br/>
3) Reluctantly ? came to homeschooling because your child was truant,<br/>
dropped out or in jeopardy of dropping out, extended illness, child<br/>
doesnt want to homeschool, angry child, noticed school-induced<br/>
problems, other??<br/>
4) Part-time or temporarily ? came to homeschooling as a supplement to<br/>
school, came to homeschooling knowing it was only a temporary move,<br/>
other??</div>
