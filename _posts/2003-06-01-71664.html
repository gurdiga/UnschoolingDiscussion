  If there is, I must be way over it.  I&#39;m 46 and get on everything--swings, <br/>
slides, plastic mountain, teeter totters.  I roll down hills and try to coax <br/>
the ball into the basket.  The only thing I won&#39;t get on, at the old parks that <br/>
haven&#39;t been renovated, are the puke wheels.  I&#39;m not athletic at all, but I <br/>
can keep up with my son and HAVE FUN!<br/>
