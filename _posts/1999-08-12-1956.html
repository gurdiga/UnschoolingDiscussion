<div id="ygrps-yiv-308743756">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
We get 20 books from the library every two weeks.  I always intend to<br/>
share some of the better selections with others but next thing i<br/>
know, we are rushing them back to the library before i get a chance. <br/>
well this time, i&#39;m doing it! &lt;G&gt; Most of these are written simply<br/>
enough for a 3 yo to enjoy and understand the content being read to<br/>
them or a beginning reader to read, but with enough complex ideas to<br/>
draw on that a 9+ yo (or adults! see &quot;Twisters!&quot; description) would<br/>
enjoy and pick up entirely different concepts. my apologies to anyone<br/>
 that is on more than one of the same list that i am sending this to<br/>
and will get a dupe.  here goes...<br/>
<br/>
My First Columbus Day Book by Dee Lillegard<br/>
a nice trip through the history of Christopher Columbus as a boy with <br/>
a dream, on up through his explorations and discovery.  broken into <br/>
short stories of all the historic phases of one story per page.  some <br/>
are a little poetic.  simple enough for a very young child to <br/>
understand and pictures that are appealing to the younger eyes. i <br/>
think this is a great one for encouraging an interest in history.<br/>
<br/>
A Polar Bear Can Swim (what animals can and cannot do)<br/>
 by Harriet Ziefert<br/>
A Viking Science Easy-to-Read Level 2 book <br/>
Series of &quot;can&quot; lead into &quot;cannot&quot; and then lead into who &quot;can&quot;...<br/>
&quot;A honeybee can make honey, but a honeybee can&#39;t make milk&quot; <br/>
&quot;A cow can make milk&quot;<br/>
I learned a few things from this one - did you know that a cow can <br/>
drink 75 gallons of water in a day? that a bat can catch 600 insects <br/>
in an hour?  WOW!  <br/>
In the back, it gives ideas for related projects<br/>
<br/>
Twisters! by Lucille Recht Penner<br/>
A Step into Reading step 2 book.<br/>
Another WOW! &quot;I&quot; learned a lot from this book too! i never heard of <br/>
water tornadoes called waterspouts that can suck all the water out of <br/>
a pond, or a &quot;dust devil&quot; tornado, or how hurricanes are named, or <br/>
about special planes called &quot;hurricane hunters&quot; that fly right into <br/>
hurricanes to study them!  A great, simple yet informative <br/>
introduction to meteorology and history too!  there are many <br/>
references to famous storms in history.<br/>
<br/>
People by Peter Spier<br/>
A sort of &quot;people&quot; encyclopedia that portrays differences in people <br/>
and cultures in everything like clothes, food, religions, games, <br/>
languages, famous people in history, etc.  an older book copyright <br/>
1980 but still worth a look if your library has it.  ends on a note <br/>
of &quot;isn&#39;t it wonderful that we are all different from each other?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Christmas Ornaments Kids Can Make by Kathy Ross<br/>
Excellent Crafty book!  The ornaments are easy and require very few <br/>
materials, most of which you probably have around your house or might <br/>
otherwise throw away (a reindeer from a toilet paper tube, angel from <br/>
coffee filters, and my favorite for &quot;cute&quot; - dog face made from a <br/>
doggy biscuit!).  has about 30 ornaments with simple directions and <br/>
good illustrations.<br/>
<br/>
How to be a Friend (A guide to Making Friends and Keeping Them) <br/>
by Laurie Krasny Brown and Marc Brown.<br/>
A Dino Life Guides for Families Book<br/>
A fun way to present an often difficult situation for kids.<br/>
The &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; is stated followed by cartoonish type examples using <br/>
real dialogue.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!  Anyone else have some to share?<br/>

Thanks for this, Michelle.  I made note of the books I thought would interest <br/>
my son and added them to our library list.  We too bring home usually 30+ <br/>
books from the library every couple of weeks, plus CD-ROMs and music CDs.  I <br/>
usually look for a few specific books from our running list, and then gather <br/>
the rest randomly.  I enjoy browsing through the <br/>
recently-returned-but-not-back-on-the-shelf-yet carts of our library for a <br/>
good variety of topics and authors and styles without having to travel up and <br/>
down each row of shelves.  I LOVE the library!!!!!          Peace -- Debbie</div>

knows exactly where some of his favorites are and heads right to <br/>
them - Curious George? &lt;G&gt;  We often sit right down on the floor in <br/>
the aisles and make ourselves at home to pick out books.<br/>
<br/>
    I just learned something new after visiting the kid&#39;s room for <br/>
almost 3 years!  i would notice new non-fiction books but with the <br/>
limit of 4 on new books, we wouldn&#39;t be able to get them at the time. <br/>
 i would watch for them on later trips and think &quot;geez, must be good <br/>
books, they&#39;re never in!&quot;.  well, i found out that they only stay in <br/>
the kid&#39;s room for two months and then are moved upstairs into the <br/>
adult section in the appropriate category - science, history, crafts,etc.  <br/>
i found this out on a day that i wasn&#39;t having very good luck finding <br/>
anything exciting in the kid&#39;s room and did i ever end up having a <br/>
BLAST picking out some really fun books!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423917046">Thank you Michelle!  I&#39;ll be checking out a couple of those books you <br/>
mentioned.  Here&#39;s some reviews I&#39;ve written up over the past year.  A few of <br/>
them are adult books, but the majority are story books.  I&#39;m really oriented <br/>
towards learning first through characters and fiction.  I guess that&#39;s one of <br/>
the reasons why I ended up unschooling :-)<br/>

<br/>
A recent favorite at bedtime for my 2.5 year old is &quot;Before I Go to Sleep&quot;,<br/>
(Don&#39;t have the author handy right now.)  It&#39;s a lovely book all about a<br/>
little boys imaginings on a hot summer evening at bedtime.  It&#39;s all in<br/>
verse and has wonderful illustrations.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do this in Book stores as well...&lt;g&gt;  They are like candy stores to this<br/>
family!  I can harldy wait until the boys are really old enough for the<br/>
library.  Although my 2.5 year old loves books and loves to be read to as<br/>
often as possible, his brother is not yet ready for the library.  At<br/>
16months and just barely verbal, he still eats books more than he looks at<br/>
them.  He will sometimes sit and look at a book or sit still for a quarter<br/>
of a story, but I cannot take both of them to the library.  That would be<br/>
an adventure!  They would both be running in opposite directions, and the<br/>
baby would be emptying the bookshelves (one of his favorite pastimes.)<br/>
Luckily we have more kids books around here than they will be able to get<br/>
through in a LOOOOOONG time, and aquiring more all the time.<br/>

Also, don&#39;t forget to check out the adult non-fiction section on a regular <br/>
basis for books for your kids.  As one library fiend to another, I have <br/>
realized that some books written for adults on particular subjects appeal <br/>
more to my children than the children&#39;s versions.  Although, I do have to say <br/>
that children&#39;s non-fiction choices have improved dramatically over the past <br/>
few years.<br/>
My son loves anything about woodworking and tools, so we find lots for him in <br/>
the adult section.  I also find that adult titles about wildlife, art, <br/>
crafts, cooking, etc. tend to interest my children more than the children&#39;s <br/>
books.  So, don&#39;t forget that you don&#39;t have to stay in the children&#39;s room. <br/>
(even if some library workers try to keep you  there!) Fortunately, at our <br/>
library, they don&#39;t!<br/>
Have fun &#39;brary hunting...<br/>

what Sterling has pulled out and sat down with for quite some time - <br/>
the gardening books, home repair books (but then he loves to take <br/>
things apart!), etc.<br/>
