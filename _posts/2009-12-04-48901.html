<div id="ygrps-yiv-515078110">I dont&#39; have this book anymore but i really disliked what they said about natural consequences, which for me were not natural at all.<br/>
Also, at some point, they give some advice to make things easier at the supermarket, and if it does not work and the kid still does not &quot;behave&quot; (they don&#39;t use this term I guess), then he&#39;s not allowed to come along the next time.  <br/>
 <br/>
I wish i still had the book to be more precise. Someone remembers that?<br/>
 <br/>
It really is not about choices for me.  <br/>
 <br/>
Asking a kid who does not want to go outside whether she wants to wear the red or blue jacket is not giving her real choices as we&#39;ve decided to go anyway. <br/>
And it&#39;s not the same as saying &quot;well, i&#39;m sorry honey but i don&#39;t want to cancel this appointment (or whatever) and we&#39;re going anyway but look i have your great spiderman jacket, and you can take your nintendo and still be playing in the car, or but i&#39;ve got a new book you&#39;re going to love waiting for you in the car or whatever.<br/>
And it&#39;s not the same as getting used to giving more and more choices to your kid. <br/>
 <br/>
Parents are not encouraged to rethink their &quot;have tos&quot; and to be honest and authentic with their kids. Maybe, it&#39;s no big deal, maybe it&#39;s still better than what they were doing before reading the book. <br/>
The problem i&#39;ve noticed around me (our local attachment parenting was really fond of these books) is that parents believe they&#39;re being very respectful and they don&#39;t understand why their kids are still reluctant to do those things, have a lot of crisis... and they kind of blame the kids. <br/>
 <br/>
I believe it can be as harmful as nvc but maybe i&#39;m wrong. I read it a long time ago.  <br/>

I&#39;m not defending the book, I&#39;m questioning the point.<br/>
<br/>
Would you take a child to a store regardless of how he behaved in a  <br/>
store?  If so, are there no natural consequences?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not talking about created punishments.  I&#39;m suggesting that there  <br/>
is a purpose to going to the store.  Sometimes there&#39;s time and mood  <br/>
and energy to make the store a great museum of exploration.  Sometimes  <br/>
there&#39;s only time for the mom to sing and talk and entertain the child  <br/>
to get through quickly.  Sometimes someone needs medicine or  <br/>
ingredients for a meal or a baking project or something and there&#39;s no  <br/>
time at all for entertainment and learning.  There can&#39;t be one set of  <br/>
rules that apply to every visit to every store without any other  <br/>
factors.<br/>

in.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have many sad stories I just never tell about the families we knew  <br/>
when La Leche League was our main social world and source of  <br/>
inspiration.  Some of the greatest parents of infants seem, in  <br/>
retrospect, to have treated those days as an innoculation against any  <br/>
future problems.  It doesn&#39;t work that way.  It&#39;s probably better to  <br/>
have been parented gently and generously, but if those sweet parents  <br/>
then send a child to school and show surprise that the child isn&#39;t  <br/>
better than other kids forever because of the enriched first few  <br/>
years, it can make those children particularly frustrated.  If a  <br/>
mother shows that she knows, for sure, how to be attentive and then as  <br/>
though an alarm went off and her mother days are at a close she sends  <br/>
them off, it does send mixed messages.<br/>
<br/>
Of those families I knew in those days, a dozen to twenty families,  <br/>
three are still intact.  I was never a leader.  I&#39;m still married.   <br/>
Lori Odhner is still married, and is running marriage enrichment  <br/>
workshops or retreats in Pennsylvania.  Dorothy Kerwin is still  <br/>
married.   She wasn&#39;t a leader either. (Lori was.)<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in there, those other families came apart.  One was a  <br/>
homeschooling (unschooling, mostly) family, but the others ended up  <br/>
having kids in school, and parents separated for various reasons.   <br/>
Alcoholic airline pilot husband.  Alcohol.  Frustration and violence.   <br/>
Meanness and negativity.  Promiscuity combined with sarcasm that  <br/>
crushed the souls of mates first and children after.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no one book that advises on all those topics.  People do need  <br/>
to find the information they need, whether from other people, movies,  <br/>
websites, books, organizations, therapists, counsellors...   No one  <br/>
can provide a single book or website that will cover all of those  <br/>
aspects, though I&#39;ve kinda tried to. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a reminder of something about my website, Joyce&#39;s, anyone  <br/>
else&#39;s, and everyone&#39;s:  Each person who comes there reads different  <br/>
things, in different orders, with her own eyes and her own mind and  <br/>
her own experiences to color the way it&#39;s perceived.  Some are coming  <br/>
to relax into learning.  Some are coming to reassure themselves that  <br/>
unschooling is stupid.  Some are distraught and can hardly take in any  <br/>
ideas at all.  Some misread.   No one will read it all. No two will  <br/>
read it the same way.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never spoken in scripts to my child.  If a book suggested saying  <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s okay to be frustrated&quot; or &quot;I know younger siblings can be a  <br/>
pain,&quot; I said it in my own voice, in my own way, not in a parrot  <br/>
voice, not in a poodle voice.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard parents absolutely BOTCH the entire communicative  <br/>
process, both in coldhearted mean ways and in mincingly irritating  <br/>
falsely sweet and clueless ways.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t see how anything on that page is suggesting anything at all  <br/>
like that.  Is someone on another list (apparently in France?)  <br/>
suggesting that I think that is a book to live by or what?<br/>
<br/>
Look:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/siblings">http://sandradodd.com/siblings</a><br/>
<br/>
After EIGHT links to unschooling information by and for unschoolers  <br/>
(each of which leads to other pages), at the very bottom of the page  <br/>
it says this:<br/>
<br/>
 From outside the unschooling realm, consider this: Siblings Without  <br/>
Rivalry, by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------<br/>
<br/>
IF a person wants something above and beyond those eight links, then  <br/>
that book might give them another perspective and the perspective of  <br/>
people who aren&#39;t unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing has ever gotten me totally off base because I&#39;ve always read  <br/>
and thought and looked at my kids and thought some more, and read  <br/>
other things, talked to people, discussed things... how could one  <br/>
single source get a person totally off base unless that was the  <br/>
person&#39;s starting place and the person thought one book could be *it*?<br/>
<br/>
I love Whole Child, Whole Parent, but when she said TV was evil, I  <br/>
didn&#39;t repeat mindless-zombie-style &quot;TV is Evil.&quot;   I figured she  <br/>
meant if you&#39;re maintaining a designer-spiritual-pastel baby house,  <br/>
then TV won&#39;t go with the other decor.  The friends who will be  <br/>
impressed with your hand-carved toys won&#39;t be impressed with Mr.  <br/>
Roger&#39;s Neighborhood.   By the time I read that book, though, I had  <br/>
friends who were impressed with music, art, research, history and my  <br/>
own ability to reason, and so whether or not I had a TV wasn&#39;t going  <br/>
to make me any friends nor lose me any friends.  Anyone who wants to  <br/>
shun me or my kids because we watch TV sometimes can get the hell out  <br/>
of my house.   I don&#39;t care.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt disparaged TV, though it&#39;s kinda hypocritical since the  <br/>
inspiration for the term &quot;unschooling&quot; came from a TV commercial. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

potential to be toxic.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s what makes helping people understand unschooling  <br/>
difficult. Many people come asking for what to do. The want new  <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; actions to replace old actions. But unschooling doesn&#39;t  <br/>
work like that. It&#39;s about listening to and trusting your kids, not  <br/>
other people. But to unlearn how to override kids, you need to listen  <br/>
to other people ;-) Unfortunately schools are good at impressing on  <br/>
kids that they need to sit down, shut up and listen to learn. So  <br/>
people bring lots of baggage with them to learning about unschooling  <br/>
and the transition can be rough.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry you went through that.<br/>

It was my post sandra was talking about! Sorry for that.<br/>
 <br/>
In French, this passage sounds terrible (to me at least!) and after the talk about faber and mazlich, i was just wondering if it could be a problem of translation.<br/>
Also, in our local parenting group which became a homeschooling group, rosenberg, gordon, and faber and mazlich were of great influence. <br/>
At first, this influence seemed really positive but now i can say it&#39;s been more negative than anything else.<br/>
It would be very long to describe but it&#39;s like it complicated everything. It was really disempowering as it gave the impression we needed a method to do better. It was also recommended to follow workshops.<br/>
I know it&#39;s what we made of the books and it does not necessarily mean the books are awful.<br/>
But it&#39;s weird that people can spend a lot of energy defending these books even though their family life is far from peaceful. And they say &quot;well, it&#39;s just that I can&#39;t apply properly what the authors say but NVC is still a great thing&quot;, or they don&#39;t even realize things can be simpler, more peaceful. <br/>
Reading Rue Kream, John Holt, and Sandra Dodd has really been great for me so I tell friends about it and lend them the books (and I wish your books were translated into French Sandra). But if they don&#39;t like it, no big deal, I&#39;m not going to argue and try to convince them. I just know how it helped me and how life is so much better right now. It&#39;s all that counts.<br/>
If somebody thinks NVC or another book helped having a better relationships with their children, good for them. But why defend these books if you don&#39;t like that much your life with your kids, if your kids do not look very happy, if they&#39;re not peaceful, if many aspects of your life are complicated...? It&#39;s mystery to me. <br/>
 <br/>
And it does not affect my life right now but it did affect it because people kept using these books, promoting it without saying (or not realizing?) it had done no real good in their lifes. I found out that later when I got to know them better. <br/>
I was lucky enough to be told about Sandra&#39;s website quite early, and lucky to read English too. Unfortunately, a lot of parents I know can&#39;t read English.<br/>
 <br/>
I realized things could be simple, not always easy but so much simpler. I enjoyed more and more my life with my kids, and (re)discovered it could be fun to learn. I&#39;ll always remember one of the first advice that went right through my heart and started it all, it was something called &quot;it only takes a second to Do better&quot; on the parenting peacefully page. Waouh, so simple, so true. I turned off the computer and went to play with my son and from this point never (almost!) said &quot;hold on&quot; when he wanted to show me something and I was on the computer (hold on! i&#39;m talking about being respectful to you and having a great life together on the computer! It&#39;s more important than going to see the great tower you&#39;ve just built and you want to show me!!!!!!!!!!)<br/>
 <br/>
 Sorry for this very long  and confused message, it will be my last one for a while because it takes me too much time to write in English and my kids are still very young and need me A LOT. But I will keep reading you (and your books, and your blogs and websites) at night when they are asleep. I enjoy it so much.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A lot of people do not realize their lives are complicated, not peaceful, etc.  Also, a lot of people&#39;s lives would be even worse without those books ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Being French myself, I think there is even more of a need for deschooling in France than there is in the US.  Schools in France are even more about rote memorization and &quot;do as you are told&quot; than in the English speaking world.  My husband, who is German, went to university (ecole de commerce, actually, for those who understand the system) in France and was appalled that there was no dialog in class, the French students never questioned what the prof said.  I think that might be why French parents feel like they need to do exactly what a book says must be done, without thinking much about how and where it applies to their real life and children.<br/>

The whole purpose of a discussion list like this is to really examine  <br/>
ideas from all angles, and to tweak and improve them when we can, and  <br/>
to find the exceptions.<br/>
<br/>
In a discussion like these on AlwaysLearning, each person who&#39;s  <br/>
interested in any thread can learn things to connect to what he or she  <br/>
is already thinking or knowing, or can look at it as &quot;Good.  Knew  <br/>
that.&quot;  or &quot;Confirms what I thought,&quot; and that&#39;s learning too; it&#39;s  <br/>
reinforcement of belief, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t write a &quot;how to&quot; about unschooling because there isn&#39;t a how  <br/>
to that doesn&#39;t involve the reader/unschooler and what she knows,  <br/>
likes and does.  We can&#39;t tell anyone how to unschool, we can only  <br/>
help them become the kind of people who can be unschooling parents.<br/>
<br/>
If ANY other club, method or belief system has given an individual  <br/>
parent tools she or he can use to be a better unschooling parent,  <br/>
that&#39;s great.  Some people remember one particular teacher who was  <br/>
patient and enthusiastic and sometimes they try to be that way with  <br/>
their kids.  Some people remember a great summer where they learned a  <br/>
lot about nature, and they try to work some of those opportunities  <br/>
in.   That&#39;s why people say &quot;unschooling is different in every  <br/>
family.&quot;  Or that&#39;s why they should say it. &lt;bwg&gt;  Sometimes they say  <br/>
it to justify lazy, lame parenting.<br/>
<br/>
So where was I?  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
If Bea&#39;s right and there is a tradition in France of choosing a  <br/>
professor/teacher/leader and then following his advice to the letter,  <br/>
then I can see why they would villify some books and glorify others.    <br/>
And if a group has moved from one extreme to another, the desire to  <br/>
jettison the name of the old group, their meeting place, all their  <br/>
books and their team colors might be natural, but it might not be  <br/>
healthy.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m playing American football (anyone who knows me knows I&#39;m not,  <br/>
and haven&#39;t since we were little kids playing flag football in the  <br/>
yard at with the neighbors)... if I&#39;m playing football and I abruptly  <br/>
change sports and decide to play rugby, a lot of things will be  <br/>
different.  But if I am in a reactionary mode and say EVERYthing is  <br/>
different now, and I say &quot;football players drink water between plays,  <br/>
and I&#39;m not a football player, so I&#39;m not going to drink water,&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;football players do this particular stretch before they play, and I&#39;m  <br/>
playing a different sport now, so I will never do that stretch again,&quot;  <br/>
that&#39;s being reactionary rather than rational.  That&#39;s being emotional  <br/>
rather than logical.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen unschoolers declare with feeling that their kids will NEVER  <br/>
have to learn/do/be this or that that the parents associated with  <br/>
school.  Standing in line, or taking a test, or being with kids they  <br/>
don&#39;t like.  But the parents have gone too far sometimes.   One mother  <br/>
said that critical thinking was something they taught in school, and  <br/>
she was really angry that she had been asked to think critically about  <br/>
things in a homeschooling forum.<br/>
