<br/>
It seems to keep getting younger and younger.   My FIL noticed this when I was introducing him to unschooling.   I was telling him how I saw the light going out in my son&#39;s eyes, 2nd grade,  and he said,  &quot;yeah,  I remember seeing that in 5th grade or something&quot;.    He was a teacher 30 years ago.  He agreed that he thought it was happening younger now too.     <br/>
<br/>
The schools are becoming more efficient,,,,blech!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure it also has to do with how sensitive a child is?   Maybe?    All I know, is that it eventually affects us all.<br/>

this mindset that I was always PREPARING for<br/>
life...that somehow what I was doing right then wasn&#39;t<br/>
the important thing.  My kids don&#39;t have that.  They<br/>
are living their lives right now, today--and they<br/>
aren&#39;t spending their precious time learning someone<br/>
else&#39;s agenda to prepare them for some hypothetical<br/>
future.  <br/>
When they learn something, it&#39;s because it&#39;s useful or<br/>
fascinating or fun for them right THEN.  <br/>

I seriously have seen the dull stare in kids as young as 1st grade.   Many of these kids haredly ever spend a whole day with their own families/parents.   Shipped off where ever and when ever it is possible.  It is sooooo sad.<br/>

6th grade, Sister Agnes, St. Christopher&#39;s School in East Hartford CT... we<br/>
were split up in to groups for the remainder of the year. I was in the &quot;B&quot;<br/>
group... the &quot;dumb&quot; group, the &quot;not straight A&#39;s group&quot; ... watch my spirit<br/>
fly out the window with my attention and my love of learning... it took 15<br/>
years, a certain college professor and a favorite topic to gain it back<br/>

   &gt; I like the message. But I think they usually break them by fifth grade.<br/>
   &gt;<br/>
   &gt; Maybe school is more efficient than you&#39;re remembering! By the 13th<br/>
year,<br/>
   &gt; they&#39;re up to working on breaking the stunted but emerging ADULT<br/>
spirit!<br/>

   I think 3rd grade is when parents realize that it&#39;s happening. I know<br/>
SOOOOO<br/>
   many parents who pulled their kids during or after 3rd grade. They start<br/>
to<br/>
   realize that the kids they know and love are changing, and some decide<br/>
they<br/>
   don&#39;t WANT that spark in their kids to die, so they get them the hell out<br/>

   there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-598429774">My Most Humiliating Moment -<br/>
6th Grade.<br/>
I had to go to the bathroom. I really had to pee!<br/>
The teacher said no. She said I could wait. A few minutes later - I had my hand up again (BTW-when we wanted to go to the bathroom, we used one finger for pee; two fingers for well - you know); She said No - I said &quot;Please&quot;<br/>
&quot;No&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A few minutes later I raised my hand again. She made me stand by her desk for disobedience. &quot;If you want my attention - then you have it!!&quot;<br/>
I peed right there.<br/>
I couldn&#39;t help it.<br/>
I was struggling to hold it in while she banged her stupid gavel and screamed at me to be still.<br/>
This woman was so fearsome!! She had a gavel that she pounded on her desk. She broke at least one a year. Anyway - she was so fearsome that hardly any of my classmates said or did anything. My whole 6th grade was torture.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-832767114">Mine was in 1st grade - the teacher used to pull me out of my seat and up into the front of the classroom by my ear.....she would then safety pin a note on my shirt explaining to my parents what a &quot;bad girl&quot; I had been (for the life of my I can&#39;t remember what I did that was so &quot;bad&quot;).  I would always tear it off and stuff it in the bushes surrounding my house.  Funny thing -- my parents moved 2 years ago and the bushes were removed.....lots of little notes stuffed way down in.

       &gt; &lt;&lt;&quot;School Takes 13 years because that&#39;s how long it takes to break a<br/>

       &gt; I like the message. But I think they usually break them by fifth grade. <br/>
       &gt; <br/>
       &gt; Maybe school is more efficient than you&#39;re remembering! By the 13th<br/>
    year, <br/>
       &gt; they&#39;re up to working on breaking the stunted but emerging ADULT<br/>
    spirit! <br/>
       &gt; <br/>
       &gt; <br/>
<br/>
       I think 3rd grade is when parents realize that it&#39;s happening. I know<br/>
    SOOOOO <br/>
       many parents who pulled their kids during or after 3rd grade. They start<br/>
    to <br/>
       realize that the kids they know and love are changing, and some decide<br/>
    they <br/>
       don&#39;t WANT that spark in their kids to die, so they get them the hell out<br/>
    of <br/>
       there. <br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m sure it also has to do with how sensitive a child is?   Maybe?    All <br/>
I know, is that it eventually affects us all. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, probably.<br/>
And how bubbly.  <br/>
I actually survived it pretty well, but I was only in school 11 years not 13 <br/>
(no kindergarten and left a year early).  Also I had a WHOLE lot (over half <br/>
of them) of teachers I realled enjoyed one way or another, and although some <br/>
were stupid or mean, I saw it for what it was.  I think partly because I <br/>
wanted to be a teacher, I was really clinical about the whole thing early on. <br/>
 I heard the sing-song voice in my 2nd grade teacher sometimes.  I saw that <br/>
sometimes she was really there and sometimes she was distracted entirely.   <br/>
Third grade teacher was kind of dull and old and boring.  Not mean, but never <br/>
exciting.  Fourth grade, huge range of everything, and she was smart and <br/>
creative (I&#39;m still in contact with her).  And so on.  So I saw them as <br/>
fallible (though I did still wonder whether they lived at school, maybe, <br/>
until I was 11 or so) and didn&#39;t feel dependent on them for anything except <br/>
safety (at which they sometimes failed, but not always).<br/>
<br/>
But as to the original question about the bumper sticker, I think it&#39;s a good <br/>
one!<br/>
And I also think lots of people who would see such a bumper sticker would say <br/>
&quot;Thirteen years!? They did me in six! &lt;g&gt;&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt; I seriously have seen the dull stare in kids as young as 1st grade.   Many <br/>
of these kids haredly ever spend a whole day with their own families/parents. <br/>

<br/>
Well I&#39;ve seen the dull stare from kids a year or two or three old who were <br/>
WITH their parents, so not ALL dullality is school-byproduct.  Some is <br/>
familial, whether nature or nurture (or lack thereof, in either case).<br/>
<br/>
There are kids who give up early, though, and it&#39;s so sad to think about.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget, though, that some people find friends at school who change <br/>
their lives in happy, wonderful ways.  Some (like me) hadn&#39;t been around <br/>
adults who had read or travelled or who talked about ideas instead of tractor <br/>
parts.<br/>

friends in our neighborhood, one of whom he considered his &quot;best friend&quot;<br/>
last year. Both of them went to kindergarten this year, and now Mackenzie<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to play with either one of them. I can see why. Their basic<br/>
personalities and ways of playing have totally changed. It&#39;s eerie.<br/>
These are all kids from really cool families too, parents who I<br/>
really like and who are gentle, peaceful people. Kids who were<br/>
attachment parented and breastfed to age 4, and a co-sleeping and all of<br/>
that. School is just the last bastion though, I&#39;m always amazed at how<br/>
otherwise totally radical parents still ship the kids off to kindergarten at<br/>
age 5. If I remember right, there was even an extended breastfeeding book<br/>
called &quot;Through the Schoolyard Fence&quot; or something like that. I just can&#39;t<br/>
get why someone who can see that it&#39;s okay to still be nursing a 5 year old<br/>
also can&#39;t see that it&#39;s okay just not to send him away! Do away with the<br/>
schoolyard fence.<br/>

  Yes,  I think that&#39;s  the case with these kids.   Its been a hard road with these types of realizations.   Ending of friendships with the parents.  <br/>
<br/>
  Its hard, or I should say impossible, for me to relate to another adult when their children are so neglected.   <br/>

  &gt; up into the front of the classroom by my ear.....she would then safety <br/>
  &gt; pin a note on my shirt explaining to my parents what a &quot;bad girl&quot; I <br/>
  &gt; had been (for the life of my I can&#39;t remember what I did that was so <br/>
  &gt; &quot;bad&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
  Just in case people think others are exaggerating their school <br/>
  humiliation stories -- here is an article in today&#39;s papers:<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;Wednesday, some local parents say a teacher is taking that same <br/>
  tactic from   the courtroom to the classroom. The school district <br/>
  involved is the Southland   Independent School District, located along <br/>
  U.S. Highway 84 between Slaton and   Post. &quot;Monday afternoon, she taped <br/>
  five children&#39;s mouths shut, of which my son   was one and my son is <br/>
  asthmatic,&quot; says Pam Philips, outraged after her sons 6th   grade <br/>
  english teacher taped his mouth shut after he was disruptive during <br/>
  class   on Monday. &quot;According to my child, she used masking tape on <br/>
  Monday and told them   she would bring duct tape the next day,&quot; says <br/>

I agree with the bathroom thing.  Also, I always remember in junior <br/>
high the bathrooms were a wreck.  I went to this really nice school <br/>
and the majority of the bathrooms had no locks.  Here you have 100&#39;s <br/>
of girls just starting their periods and trying to change their pads <br/>
and hold the door with one hand.  Especially at that age, the idea of <br/>
being caught was soooo embarassing.  I think I heard the excuse once <br/>
it was so kids would not smoke!  Yeah, I think it is easier to hold <br/>
the door and smoke than change a pad/tampon!!  That one reason would <br/>
be enough to keep my kids home.  Everyone deserves to do their <br/>
business in peace!!<br/>

Imagine what would happen if kids got together and decided they wanted to <br/>
tape the teacher &quot;shut&quot; and maybe tape her to her chair?  They would be in a <br/>

&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That also happened to the son of a good friend of mine,  in the school that <br/>
my kids went to last year.  The same teacher also put kids in &quot;time out&quot; in a <br/>
very small supply closet.   There are, unfortunately, atrocities like this <br/>
abound in schools, public and private.<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading all the posts about how folks and thier childrens spirits <br/>
have been broken by school.  I know it happens, I&#39;ve seen it happen.  I would <br/>
say that Ethan had his spirit broken by school. Not one specific event, <br/>
person, or &quot;thing&quot; ,  but just the culmination of school in general, broke him and <br/>
made him feel inferior and unaccepted.   <br/>
<br/>
But for me, personally, and for many many folks I know, they were never <br/>
&quot;broken&quot; by school.   I thrived in school.  I loved it.  I had some &quot;not so good&quot; <br/>
stuff happen in school, but, nothing traumatic.   Anna loved school, she also <br/>
thrived and flourished in school.  She only had one bad experience and it was <br/>
because of a  horrid teacher.   That experience did not scar her and make her <br/>
hate school, she just hated that particular teacher.  <br/>
<br/>
I am not discounting any of the horrible things that others have had to <br/>
endure. I am just making a point that everyone that goes to school does not get <br/>
thier spirit broken.<br/>

from public school IS very significant, I&#39;m just saying, it&#39;s not 100%, thats <br/>
all.<br/>

families/parents. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well I&#39;ve seen the dull stare from kids a year or two or three old <br/>
who were <br/>
&gt; WITH their parents, so not ALL dullality is school-byproduct.  Some <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; familial, whether nature or nurture (or lack thereof, in either <br/>
case).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are kids who give up early, though, and it&#39;s so sad to think <br/>
about.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t forget, though, that some people find friends at school who <br/>
change <br/>
&gt; their lives in happy, wonderful ways.  Some (like me) hadn&#39;t been <br/>
around <br/>
&gt; adults who had read or travelled or who talked about ideas instead <br/>
of tractor <br/>

was we, the students, GAVE out teachers their authority in the classroom.<br/>

Oooh, did I have trouble after that!  I got really picky about how much<br/>
authority I was gonna allow and exactly to whom.  -grin-  I was ok with<br/>
getting in trouble for it, but my mom sooooo didn&#39;t understand.<br/>
