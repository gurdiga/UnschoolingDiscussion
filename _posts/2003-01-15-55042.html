I asked if there were two Heidis because I think there ARE two and I was <br/>

bunsofaluminum? I haven&#39;t read every SINGLE post, but a lot of them <br/>
the past four or five days. All of the recent ones, as I just <br/>
click &quot;next&quot; and move down the line.<br/>

What made you think there are two Heidi&#39;s? Just curious.<br/>
