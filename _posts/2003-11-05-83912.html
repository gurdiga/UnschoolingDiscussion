fear.   Every reason I gave had to do with convenience, not fear.   Pam <br/>
mentioned that she was not comfortable getting candy from folks she didn&#39;t know.. I <br/>
can certainly respect that.. But, in my case, I was born and raised here, .. <br/>
36 years of living in the same community.. I DO know the folks that live around <br/>
me, and I trust them.     My children choose what they want to do for <br/>
Halloween, and since our local churches began trunk or treat, that is their choice.   <br/>
It has nothing to do with fear, it has to do with fun.   Why does it so <br/>
offend you?  <br/>

It doesn&#39;t.  But as a former Southern Baptist, serving in &quot;women&#39;s <br/>
leadership&quot; at one of the world&#39;s largest Southern Baptist churches for several years, I <br/>
know all about harvest festivals in place of Halloween and all the rest.  I <br/>
know the motivations behind the &quot;no scary costumes&quot; and &quot;must dress like <br/>
biblical characters&quot; edicts.  If your particular church doesn&#39;t do trunk or treat <br/>
out of fear of being too pagan, then good for you.  I am CERTAIN there are <br/>
churches that do.<br/>

fear of taking your kids to strange neighbors.  Fear that your children would <br/>
be in an unsafe area.  LOL.  Which is part why I take my kids to friends I know <br/>
or Jackson knows.  LOL.  Not fear of being too pagan.  LOL.<br/>
I feel so naive now.<br/>
But the one trunk or treat we did do, year before last, had no restrictions <br/>
on costumes, they had &quot;scary&quot; trunks, we had a scary trunk.  They did have a <br/>
hotdog supper with it.  And they had fun games.  There were adults dressed up <br/>
too with scary costumes, etc.  But I have heard of one church that had those <br/>
restrictions.  Not sure any more.  We don&#39;t go to church.  So I am not familiar <br/>
with most.  <br/>

church does not do trunk or treat)  celebrates Halloween in the fashion that I <br/>
described in a earlier post.   I can only speak for.. hmm.. I&#39;de say about a 100 <br/>
mile radius of Conover, NC.. but it is much more common around here to <br/>
celebrate Halloween in traditional ways ( in MANY-- the MAJORITY-- of churches)  <br/>
than to try to change it to &quot;something Christian&quot;<br/>

veins and bones and blood dripping out of the neck.  Or no, I guess it would <br/>
have to be on a platter.  LOL!!  <br/>

have them same type rules for the kids, NO SCARY COSTUMES and recommend fairy <br/>

So LOT&#39;S of different parts of life try to discourage the ugly and scary <br/>

I don&#39;t know about that! Women of the Bible, boring? There are some pretty <br/>
catty, slutty, nasty, brave, and honorable women in the Bible. And there are <br/>
lots of stupid, always looking for the next easy score, men in the Bible. Many of <br/>
them with strong, smart, biding their time, women behind them. <br/>
<br/>
Jezebel helped her husband out. He had more land than he knew what to do <br/>
with, yet he still wanted this one small vineyard, so Jezebel frames the man. He <br/>
is charged with the capital offense of cursing God&#39;s name, and is stoned to <br/>
death. However, God punishes her as she is cursed to be eaten by dogs within the <br/>
city walls, her corpse would be like dung on fields so no one could bury her, <br/>
or say *this is Jezebel*. Meaning that no trace of her would exist and no one <br/>
could go to a grave and say &quot;here she is.&quot;  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;A girl could dress up like Jezebel and hang stuffed dogs off of herself, as <br/>
 </span></blockquote>if they were biting and eating her. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is Bathsheba; King David fell so hopelessly in love with her he calls <br/>
for her, has sex with her and knocks her up. Oops! She has a husband, So David <br/>
sends her husband, Uriah, back out into battle. Specifically the front lines <br/>
so he would be killed so David and Bathsheba could keep their little secret. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;A girl could dress up as if she were pregnant and drag around the corpse of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>her murdered husband. <br/>
<br/>
David sends Rizpah&#39;s, a concubine of Saul, son&#39;s into the hands of the <br/>
Gibeonites. The Gibeonites impaled the men and left their bodies out in the <br/>
elements. Rizpah bravely leaves her home, and goes out to sit with the men&#39;s bodies, <br/>
keeping birds and animals from further desecrating the bodies. She stands out <br/>
there by her children, away from her duties at home for months! Rotting <br/>
decaying bodies, and she stays by them to keep them from suffering further insult by <br/>
becoming carrion. David sees her loyalty and brave actions and has the bodies <br/>
removed for proper, honorable burial. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Dress up in sackcloth and have two dolls spiked beside you? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is Delilah; she was a paid &quot;spy&quot;. She gained Samson&#39;s &quot;love&quot; and <br/>
tricked him into telling her the source of his strength. The problem with this story <br/>
is that she had to trick Samson three or four times before he would tell her <br/>
about his hair, and each time she was caught in the act and yet he still goes <br/>
back to her and tells her more and more! <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;A girl could dress up as a slutty hairdresser of Israel and a boy could <br/>
 </span></blockquote>dress up as the stupid Samson. &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jael goes out and tricks an enemy of the Israelites, killing him with <br/>
kindness, and finally a tent peg. <br/>

That one sounds good.<br/>
<br/>
I bet if the girls started dressing up like THOSE women, the church might <br/>
just recommend a few years of witches and goblins to get closer to the message of <br/>
Jesus.  Vampires and Cannibals.  Now THAT can tie in easily with communion.<br/>
<br/>
I like Potiphar&#39;s wife framing Joseph for rape when he won&#39;t fool around with <br/>
her:<br/>
<br/>
39:6 <br/>
And he left all that he had in Joseph&#39;s hand; and he knew not ought he had, <br/>
save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well <br/>
favoured.<br/>
<br/>
Joseph<br/>
is seduced <br/>
39:7 <br/>
And it came to pass after these things, that his master&#39;s wife cast her eyes <br/>
upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.<br/>
<br/>
39:8 <br/>
But he refused, and said unto his master&#39;s wife, Behold, my master wotteth <br/>
not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my <br/>
hand;<br/>
<br/>
39:9 <br/>
There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any <br/>
thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great <br/>
wickedness, and sin against God?<br/>
<br/>
39:10 <br/>
And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not <br/>
unto her, to lie by herhat Joseph went into the house to do his business; and <br/>
there was none of the men of the house there within.<br/>
<br/>
39:12 <br/>
And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his <br/>
garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.<br/>
<br/>
39:13 <br/>
And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, <br/>
and was fled forth,<br/>

That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, <br/>
he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie <br/>
with me, and I cried with a loud voice:<br/>

And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that <br/>
he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.<br/>

And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.<br/>

which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:<br/>

I wondered if anyone would mention Bathsheba.. I always think of her as David <br/>
&quot;peeping Tom&#39;ed&quot; on  her while she bathed.. I recently read something about <br/>
&quot;biblical sexual feats&quot; about David and Bathsheba&#39;s affair.. it was.. ahem.. <br/>
interesting.. :-)<br/>

Where did you read it? Book, Internet, magazine??? Do tell me please! <br/>
<br/>
Actually, I think Bathsheba is one of the most maligned women in the Bible. <br/>
People (preachers, historians...) place the blame squarely on her, when it was <br/>
David who wasn&#39;t where HE was supposed to be. Back in the day kings went off <br/>
to war. But David, for some reason stayed at home. Maybe he was too old, but <br/>
twice the writer of these verses tells us that David stayed at home, reinforcing <br/>
the idea that David, obviously wasn&#39;t where he was supposed to be. <br/>
<br/>
In 2 Samuel 1:12; we are told that David has risen from his couch and takes a <br/>
walk on the roof of his house, where he sees a woman bathing, and that she <br/>
was very beautiful. It doesn&#39;t state that Bathsheba flaunted herself, it states <br/>
that David was watching her, unknown to her. Then he sends some guys to go get <br/>
her, and commands that she come to him. As a good subject she goes. He bids <br/>
her to lay with him and then we are told that she just gets up and goes home. <br/>
So she isn&#39;t the greedy manipulator so often portrayed. Later she has to send <br/>
word to David that she is pregnant. Some have said that she planned the <br/>
pregnancy, but how? If she didn&#39;t know that the king was a peeping tom, and she only <br/>
went to him as a subject of a king, and although she did have sex with him, <br/>
she didn&#39;t hang around plotting something, she went home. So David calls her <br/>
husband home from battle and tries to get him to take a little R&R, but being the <br/>
loyal soldier, Uriah will have none of it. Here we see that Uriah, the <br/>
foreigner is a better man than the king he is serving. David tries two or three <br/>
times to get the guy to go home. (He wants Uriah to go home and do what all men do <br/>
on return to their wives after a long campaign, so maybe Uriah will think the <br/>
child is his.) Finally David sends Uriah back out to war, and sends him to <br/>
the front lines where he is sure to get killed. At this point, Bathsheba becomes <br/>
David&#39;s wife and because of this, many would tell us that Bathsheba is the <br/>
instigator of this devious little plan, but really it is David who has committed <br/>
the sin and then makes even bigger sins trying in vain to cover up. Alas, he <br/>
doesn&#39;t get away with it. Nathan delivers a prophesy telling David that his <br/>
son will be struck down. And he is. We would assume that David would then not go <br/>
back and &quot;be&quot; with Bathsheba, but he does and eventually he and she have <br/>
another son, Solomon. And that is a whole &#39;nother story. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, you didn&#39;t want a Bible lesson? Sorry. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
