<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308620845">The whole premise of a child lying about being tired (Myranda&#39;s response to <br/>
Sandra&#39;s garage sale, mean Mom scenario) is really, really bugging me.<br/>
How would you decide as a parent when your child is truly tired or simply <br/>
manipulating you? UGH!<br/>
If you trust your child from the beginning, they have no need to lie....no <br/>
need to &quot;manipulate&quot; because they know that the adults are going to heed <br/>
their requests and fulfill their needs.<br/>
A parent that has decided a child is lying about being tired (or hungry or <br/>
anything else) is really needing some help imo.<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of things floating around in my brain.<br/>
One relates to the assumption that most parent&#39;s are not going to make <br/>
harmful choices.<br/>
I sat at Sierra&#39;s gymnastic lesson yesterday. I can&#39;t STAND this particular <br/>
teacher, but it was only a make up lesson, not her regular coach and she <br/>
wanted to go.<br/>
The teacher makes 3 and 4 year olds get in line, name letters of the alphabet <br/>
etc.... all in the gymnastics class and gives them time out if they don&#39;t do <br/>
as they&#39;re told.<br/>
All the parents applaud the whole sick class, probably feeling their little <br/>
darlings are being prepared for school better (well sure, start sucking their <br/>
ability to think for themselves even sooner) but I can hardly stand to sit <br/>
there.<br/>
First of all, most 3 and 4 year olds don&#39;t need to take any kind of class to <br/>
enjoy tumbling.<br/>
And then, to add insult to injury, the parents berate their own children when <br/>
they cry after being put in time out.<br/>
Sick, sick, sick. If it were up to me, I&#39;d never, ever go back. But Sierra <br/>
seems oblivious because SHE is always doing exactly as the teacher says, <br/>
loves it.<br/>
As I sit there, I see toddlers strapped into strollers even against their <br/>
will.<br/>
I am the ONLY Mom that will follow her toddler around, even walking outside <br/>
for long periods of time to splash in puddles or find rocks.<br/>
I hear scoldings and withholding of desired items, all for a damn class that <br/>
is supposed to be FUN!! So much for most parents not making harmful choices.<br/>
<br/>
We had a problem today within our support group in which a boy was name <br/>
calling a lot and the other kids asked him to please go away until he could <br/>
stop.<br/>
It ended up with the Mother feeling defensive, the child being in denial <br/>
about what he had done and the unschooling kids scratching their heads trying <br/>
to figure out how to deal with people like this.<br/>
I see so much destructive behavior, even among homeschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
Myranda&#39;s view that most parent&#39;s don&#39;t make harmful choices does not hold <br/>
water.<br/>
Having been involved in homeschooling for 15 years? How is it possible to not <br/>
see this?<br/>
In 1987 I was graduating from High School. And I believe you are younger than <br/>
I Myranda.<br/>
Just how is it possible that you have been heavily involved in homeschooling <br/>
before ever having children and while you were in HS?<br/>
Or were you simply aware of it back then? &#39;Cuz involvement and awareness are <br/>
two different things.<br/>
I don&#39;t see how most people are going to be heavily involved unless they are <br/>
actually homeschooling, although there are rare exceptions.<br/>

  ** Like I said, maybe I just haven&#39;t known the same type of people. My boys have been in gymnastics, basketball, art, music, and PE classes at places like YMCA&#39;s a rec centers. I&#39;ve never heard or seen parents like you mentioned in Sierra&#39;s class. One, maybe every now and then, but no where near everyone! <br/>

Yeah this one gets me too. I had on Dr. Phil today while the baby was <br/>
napping and I was trying to catch up on my e-mail. I usually like what he <br/>
says but today was different. I never heard his views on children and I <br/>
didn&#39;t like what I heard. He was talking about discipline and taking things <br/>
away from kids when they are &quot;bad.&quot; The one good thing I heard was him <br/>
trying to tell parents that spanking doesn&#39;t work. But I digress. He <br/>
actually said that children have a dark side and will manipulate and conive <br/>
to get their way. He was talking about time outs and this one couple said <br/>
their child wouldn&#39;t stay in a time out. Dr. Phil asked how big the child <br/>
was and why couldn&#39;t the parent make then stay there? They said the kid <br/>
would scream the whole time. Dr. Phil said to force them to stay there and <br/>
then when they calmed down, inform them that their time out was now <br/>
starting. The parents said he would just start up again. Now this is the <br/>
worst part. Dr. Phil said he&#39;s actually had kids that threw up and said they <br/>
were choking and dying while being made to stay there, just to ignore it and <br/>
be consistent. I had to turn off the TV. Don&#39;t think I can stomach to listen <br/>
to him again.<br/>

<br/>
I think a lot of parents make harmful choices just out of ignorance as to <br/>
other ways and also because how they have been raised. I know it was like <br/>
that with me. I can&#39;t say most or all or even halfd because I just don&#39;t <br/>
know. I just wish I had someone like the people on this list when I was <br/>
raising my first. Whether it friends or just someone saying something in a <br/>
store. Maybe I would have come to a realization sooner.<br/>
<br/>
And I was also wondering about the whole 15 year thing. Isn&#39;t Myranda one of <br/>
the youngest if not the youngest on the list?<br/>

than me as well. If she isn&#39;t, she sure seems like it. 15 years ago, I was a <br/>
sophomore in HS. I knew about hsing as well. I thought hsed kids were the <br/>
weird family down the road who never let their kids play with the rest of us, <br/>
who didn&#39;t celebrate traditional holidays, shunned Halloween to the point of <br/>
lecturing any child brave enough to ring their bell. And I certainly wasn&#39;t <br/>
involved in political hsing battles then either. But hey, maybe she was <br/>
really into it even then, who are we to not give her the benefit of the <br/>
doubt? &lt;eg&gt;<br/>

How would you decide as a parent when your child is truly tired or simply <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Myranda&#39;s view that most parent&#39;s don&#39;t make harmful choices does not hold <br/>
water. Having been involved in homeschooling for 15 years? How is it <br/>
possible to not see this? In 1987 I was graduating from High School. And I <br/>
believe you are younger than I Myranda. Just how is it possible that you <br/>
have been heavily involved in homeschooling before ever having children and <br/>
while you were in HS? Or were you simply aware of it back then? &#39;Cuz <br/>
involvement and awareness are two different things. I don&#39;t see how most <br/>
people are going to be heavily involved unless they are<br/>
actually homeschooling, although there are rare exceptions.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think a lot of parents make harmful choices just out of ignorance as to <br/>
other ways and also because how they have been raised. I know it was like <br/>

know. I just wish I had someone like the people on this list when I was <br/>
raising my first. Whether it friends or just someone saying something in a <br/>
store. Maybe I would have come to a realization sooner.<br/>
<br/>
And I was also wondering about the whole 15 year thing. Isn&#39;t Myranda one of <br/>
the youngest if not the youngest on the list?<br/>
