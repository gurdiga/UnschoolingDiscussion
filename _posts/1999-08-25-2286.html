hi lisa!  thnx for your thoughts!  your quote above is exactly my point, and <br/>
the reason i wanted to ask an unschooling list how it is handled in your <br/>
households?  bc as i said, i realize that kids wont choose to do it w/o some <br/>
sort of motivation...  such as seeing the value in it for themselves, bc they <br/>
want to pls me, or something???  i still am wondering...  also, talking with <br/>
them about it is booorrring to them... & i hesitate to bring it up now since <br/>
i am mulling over different attitudes about it...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Chores and other aspects of housekeeping<br/>
should be a part of unschooling and should be treated in similar ways.&gt;  i am <br/>
a new enough unschooler to need examples here of how you mean.  what have you <br/>
tried?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868722694">First off, my kids are young (26 mos, 5 mos). Second, we don&#39;t call them chores:)<br/>
and we don&#39;t do them on a schedule or even very regularly. Beds don&#39;t have to be<br/>
made, toys don&#39;t have to be put away before we leave, etc. I also involve my<br/>
oldest in all the chores that are done. She sits at the sink when washing dishes<br/>
and &#39;helps&#39; by rinsing or drying or handing dishes to me. When we clean the<br/>
bathroom, I scrub the tub and shes cleans the toilet with vinegar and baking soda<br/>
(it fizzes so its fun) and a brush. When I vaccuum she does also with her own<br/>
vaccuum and uses mine when I&#39;m finished. This is just part of our day and is<br/>
never something that &#39;needs&#39; to be done. If dd doesn&#39;t feel like participating,<br/>
then she doesn&#39;t (and the &#39;chore&#39; won&#39;t necessarily get done either since we<br/>
usually start doing something else:), but this rarely happens (so far, remember<br/>
she&#39;s young:). Sometimes I don&#39;t feel like cleaning the bathroom when she wants<br/>
to, so we don&#39;t do it, or she does it by herself.<br/>
<br/>
We also keep an open discussion about what we are doing. As adults, there are<br/>
things that have to be done. When I&#39;m writing my lesson plans for class, or doing<br/>
research for a paper that&#39;s due, I talk with Fiona about why it has to be done<br/>
right then and why I can&#39;t play with her at the moment. More often than not,<br/>
though, I will still take a break and play for a few minutes before resuming my<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
Our house is usually untidy. Fiona seems to reach a point where she needs to pick<br/>
up her toys and then will do it. Sometimes, dh or I reach that point first and do<br/>
it, while trying to involve her. We have the rule whoever notices it takes care<br/>
of it. We don&#39;t see any of it as a &#39;chore&#39; though, just another thing to do<br/>
together. What we have found so far is that Fiona is taking on more and more<br/>
responsibility as we go. She is noticing when things are dirty and asks to clean<br/>
them or even starts on her own (ie the toilet, she could do that every day:) This<br/>
has also helped dh and I since we no longer say things like &quot;well, I cooked so<br/>
its your turn to wash the dishes&quot;. Sometimes we don&#39;t even wash the dishes after<br/>
a meal and wait to do it the next day (or two or three days later if the mood<br/>
strikes). Not everyone can live this way, my mom hates it:) But as we have been<br/>
moving towards the unschooling way of thinking we have found that we continusly<br/>
evaluate things based on their importance in the moment, and more likely than not<br/>
washing dishes or cleaning the bathroom loses:)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>

<br/>
thanks for going into such detail, it really helps to imagine others&#39; ideas.  <br/>
actually your handling of things sounds quite similar to the way we did it <br/>
here when ours were little.  explaining and getting everyone&#39;s input has <br/>
always been a big part of our dynamics.<br/>
&lt;we have found that we continuously<br/>
evaluate things based on their importance in the moment,&gt;<br/>
this too is similar to the way i handle things.  some nites the dishes dont <br/>
get done and i just do final check to see the perishables are all put away bc <br/>
i and everyone else just want to curl up together and choose to read or sleep!<br/>
<br/>
it seems that once one gets into older and more children, there is more of a <br/>
need for  &quot;management&quot; or overlying structure, though there can be CHOICES <br/>
within that.  when we just had one and then two little ones, we didnt find a <br/>
desire or need for bedtimes, but later it worked out best to have them.  <br/>
(LOOOVE them!) and when the olders were little, they followed and helped with <br/>
chores, learning as they went (much like yours!)-- but now have to be <br/>
responsible for doing some themselves bc it is important/helpful to the <br/>
household.  also, another example is that we too didnt do things with much <br/>
regularity (or probably call them chores either!) then, but now find it is <br/>
really necc. unless we just want to be putting out fires.<br/>
<br/>
i liked most what you said to someone else: (in your next post) &lt;unschooling <br/>
is about choices.&gt;  i strive to communicate that to my older ones (9 & 7) bc <br/>
i dont want them to feel they have to do things without knowing why.  i think <br/>
that is what caused me to become passive in so much of my learning and <br/>
activity in childhood-- i did not often feel that i had much control over how <br/>
things played out, so i discontinued caring and just went along...   the 9 & <br/>
7yo&#39;s esp are very helpful, and they dont see it as too much work, i guess to <br/>
clarify, it is the timing thing that causes the reminding... i am ready for <br/>
it to be done, they are busy with other things.  life goes on...   :)<br/>
