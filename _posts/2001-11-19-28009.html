<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569475146">There is a woman that runs a &quot;one room&quot; schoolhouse in the next town up from<br/>
us.  If the kidlets were ever forced to attend school, that is where they<br/>
would go.<br/>
<br/>
She contracts under a charter school.  The charter pays the rent on a<br/>
beautiful new two story house that is walking distance from the university<br/>
and lots of other neat things to see and do.  She has twenty students<br/>
ranging in age from 6 to 18.  They take off on week long camping trips,<br/>
they&#39;ve been to DC and places like the Shakespeare Festival.<br/>
<br/>
At anyrate, I digress.  There are a few of the kids that have various<br/>
allergies.  At the beginning of the year they studied allergies and as a<br/>
&quot;community&quot; came up with a plan work and live around those allergies.<br/>
<br/>
A kids were interviewe for a local program and the general concensus was<br/>
that they were so glad they went to this school.  For the kids with<br/>
allergies they said that they no longer felt like &quot;freaks.&quot;  For the kids<br/>
that didn&#39;t have allergies they said that they were glad they went to this<br/>
school because they hadn&#39;t even known how bad allergies could be and had<br/>
always at &quot;regular&quot; ps just thought the kids with allergies were &quot;weird.&quot;<br/>
One little girl, I think she was about 6, said &quot;I&#39;m glad they have allergies<br/>
cause . . .&quot; and then stumbled along trying to explain that she didn&#39;t mean<br/>
she was glad they had allergies but glad they were in her school because now<br/>
she didn&#39;t think they were weird.  She ended it by saying, with a look of<br/>
wow, &quot;I didn&#39;t know fake food could taste so good.&quot;  Meaning things like<br/>
non-dairy cheese.<br/>
<br/>
It can be done, just takes folks with the right attitude.<br/>
