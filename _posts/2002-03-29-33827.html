<br/>
 IMPORTANT notice from Yahoo by list owner<br/>
<br/>
Please read the following notice to prevent your e-mail boxes from<br/>
being seriously SPAMed with tons of advertising.<br/>
<br/>
The following is only applicable to those list members who have<br/>
Yahoo IDs. I checked and they HAD changed all my settings!!!<br/>
<br/>
You may remember when you signed up for a Yahoo ID and were asked by<br/>
them if you wished to receive any &quot;Special Offers & Marketing<br/>
Communications.&quot; Yahoo recently revised their privacy policy. As a<br/>
result, and regardless if you chose to receive any of these &quot;Special<br/>
Offers&quot; or not when you signed up for your Yahoo ID, Yahoo have set<br/>
every single person who has a Yahoo ID (and those that have more than<br/>
one) to &quot;Yes&quot; in these preferences. This means that you may well be<br/>
inundated with even more junk mail than you are already receiving.<br/>
<br/>
In order to change your settings back to whatever you had them at<br/>
before, you will need to log in to your account and physically change<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Login at the following URL - you will be prompted for your Yahoo ID<br/>
and password:   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://edit.my.yahoo.com/config/eval_profile">http://edit.my.yahoo.com/config/eval_profile</a><br/>
<br/>
The middle segment within the Member Information (email addresses)<br/>
section has a link to: Edit your marketing references. Click on this<br/>
link and you will see all of your settings were changed to &quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
Meaning of course that you will receive all kinds of &quot;offers&quot; from<br/>
Yahoo and their &quot;partners.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unless you wish to receive even more junk mail than you are already<br/>
getting, you may wish to go through the entire page and choose<br/>
whether to receive such notices. Also, right at the bottom of the<br/>
page are other ways you could be notified - by phone or postal mail.<br/>
Unless you wish to receive unsolicited phone calls and paper junk<br/>
mail, you will need to change these settings to &quot;No&quot; also.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have finished your selections, make sure you click on the<br/>
Save Changes button right at the bottom of the page.<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo is supposedly sending out notices to all its users regarding<br/>
this particular change. However, it is estimated it will take<br/>
several weeks for everyone to receive their notification. In the<br/>
meantime ... a considerable amount of marketing mail could be making<br/>
its way to everyone&#39;s mail boxes. </span></blockquote></div>
