<div id="ygrps-yiv-927829365">One thing I have found that works with little kids when they&#39;re upset or  <br/>
angry enough to hit: Tell them that they may not hit, but that they can squeeze  <br/>
your thumb or finger as hard as they want to/need to and as long as they want. <br/>
 It can get out some of that physical feeling of anger, but they can&#39;t hurt  <br/>
you.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve also found that if you have to remove a child from a conflict, it&#39;s  <br/>
better to remove the victim than the aggressor when that&#39;s clear. Makes it much  <br/>
less gratifying to be the aggressor. If you have one child who is consistently <br/>
 the aggressor, however, you have to assume there are bigger issues than just <br/>
 occasionally being really angry at the other child.<br/>

Removing the apparent victim, when &quot;removal&quot; means being with mom and not alone <br/>
can be an advantage to the removee.    It also sets the example of walking <br/>
away from a dangerous situation instead of hanging in there until you&#39;re rescued.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-163165534">In all of this conversation about fighting kids and how to parent through  <br/>
that, I thought of a family that I used to know. They never, ever hit their  <br/>
kids, and their two sons went through a few months where they were at each other  <br/>
constantly. The parents would break it up, help the kids get rid of some of <br/>
the  anger, and process the situation with them.<br/>
 <br/>
Finally the oldest, who was about 9, said, &quot;FINE! I just won&#39;t hit him  <br/>
anymore! Sometimes I wish you&#39;d just spank us and be done with it so we just  <br/>
didn&#39;t have to keep talking about it.&quot; Then he went off in a huff. And he never  <br/>
hit his brother again, even when provoked.<br/>
 <br/>
Processing can be a bigger deterrent than anything else. <br/>

The phrase &quot;process the situation&quot; sounds horrible to me.<br/>

There are big processing plants that make noise and spew out smoke, and I <br/>
don&#39;t want to process my kids.<br/>
