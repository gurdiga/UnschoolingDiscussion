<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767681588">From another list to demonstrate that the autonomous aproach to reading works, even whena  proffesional has made a &#39;diagnosis&#39;<br/>
I had permission to share this.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My 14 yr old had an updated assesment of his dyslexia today so that he could<br/>
apply for extra time in his GCSE&#39;s this summer (he is taking 2 as a private<br/>
candidate.. ..i hate the way they make us jump through more hoops AND have<br/>
to pay for it!) The assesors were stunned to find that within the 2 yrs of<br/>
being<br/>
home edcuated his reading age is now average for his chronological age..He<br/>
left school at 12 yrs old with a reading age of an 8 yr old..thats an<br/>
increase of 6 yrs in the space of 2 !! During his 8 yrs at school he had no<br/>
end of welfare/specialist/sen group/ tuition, wheras autonomous HE has<br/>
enabled him to reach this level. I knew there was progress by the way he was<br/>
immersing himself in magazines and web sites related to his interests..i<br/>
just didnt have an age figure on it . I feel sick to the pit of my stomach<br/>
that most LEAS (mine included) do not support the autonomous approcah and<br/>
the recent Dfes guidline draft  encouarges this appalling practise.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can you imagine what would have happened to this child had the &#39;experts&#39; started on him! He would have loathed reading for ever.<br/>

<br/>
My Katie has speech apraxia and dyslexia, and I thank God every day <br/>
that we started home schooling when she was a baby. She&#39;s never had <br/>
the &quot;experts&quot; (she did have a speech therapist for a couple of years) <br/>
put her into a special group, nor has she had the experience of the <br/>
other kids telling her how dumb she is for not being able to read <br/>
yet. She had a tough time as it was, going to Miss Rachelle. Fully <br/>
aware that she was not the same as other kids. <br/>
<br/>
In reading up on dyslexia, I ran across a man&#39;s story who <br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; reading until his adulthood. He finally &quot;saw&quot; the spaces <br/>
between words, and a man who had struggled with fast food signs and <br/>
bulletin boards, ran to the nearest library and checked out Treasure <br/>
Island, and read it in one day. He helps dyslexic kids, and relates <br/>
anecdotes where teenage guys will shed tears, because no one ever <br/>
showed them how to &quot;see&quot; the words before.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s amazing what the school system does to damage kids, innit?<br/>

&gt; Does dyslexia run in families! I wondering about the possibility of my<br/>
kids having a learning disablity since my hubby and I both had a bit of<br/>
dyslxia when in school. I was passed from special ed classes speach therapy.<br/>
Non of wich helped much.I just needed more time to accomplish things. Timed<br/>
tests where always a struggle. Individual attention and extra help.<br/>
Sometimes it was a matter of them using the right teaching method.<br/>
<br/>
I am new here. My son is 18mth and daughter is 2. She is already starting<br/>
her to say alphabet and counting to 10. My kids are both speaking in broken<br/>
sentences up to 5 wrds long the little one. Can some one give me some<br/>
average milestones? They take things apart I can&#39;t get them back together.<br/>
She hides libray books so I wont return them! </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-919937807">I loved that book! My mom is the main one in our circles who is <br/>
fretting about my 10 yo not reading yet, and I told her that guy&#39;s <br/>
story. She remains pretty much unimpressed. School teacher. Firmly <br/>
entrenched in the notion that anyone who isn&#39;t reading fluently by <br/>
age 8 will never be a good reader.<br/>
<br/>
But I DID love that book. amazing.<br/>
