&lt;&lt;what would families that have <br/>
different colors prefer to hear?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have pale *white* skin and my kids have medium brown skin...they take after <br/>
their father, not me.  Because we&#39;re divorced we&#39;re rarely seen together as a <br/>
family...it&#39;s usually the kids and me.  I never mind when kids ask questions! <br/>
 The usual one being, &quot;How come your kids are a different color that <br/>
you?&quot;...directed at me, or &quot;How come your mom&#39;s white?&quot;...directed at one of the kids. <br/>
 We usually just say that families can have all different colors, and <br/>
sometimes the kids seem a bit shocked, and we&#39;re glad to have *expanded their <br/>
universe.*<br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t like is when adults assume that I&#39;m not their mom or even don&#39;t <br/>
believe that I&#39;m their mom after I&#39;ve corrected them!  Children never make <br/>
this mistake.  They can always tell who the *mom* is! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Two of my three kids are light-skinned and light-eyed like me (except <br/>
they get a tan and I just don&#39;t) and nobody doubts they are mine. But <br/>
Roxana is Iranian-looking, dark-haired and dark-eyed. MANY times people <br/>
said very rude things in front of her. Grocer store checkers were the <br/>
worst offenders, asking, &quot;Those two are yours but where did you get <br/>
this one?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
An answer I eventually started using (for my daughter&#39;s sake) was: &quot;On <br/>
the outside she takes after the gorgeous women in her dad&#39;s family, but <br/>
she looks JUST like me, on the inside.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I never minded honest questions, really, but I did hate the rude things <br/>
people said that embarrassed Roxana and made her feel there was <br/>
something wrong with being darker or just different than her sisters.<br/>
<br/>
If they quietly asked me something, that was better, but, it isn&#39;t any <br/>
business of a perfect stranger to find out why my middle daughter might <br/>
look different than her sisters, so any questions by strangers are <br/>
rude, imo.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134694209">Yes, I agree with whoever said, &quot;just tell kids who ask that &#39;God made people in different colors&#39;, that&#39;s what I have done, too. .  . As far as making any of my family members uncomfortable because they&#39;re different shades than I am, that&#39;s not happened.  Yes I let them know that they&#39;re themselves and I wouldn&#39;t change them, and I welcome the &#39;diversity&#39; that they bring.<br/>
 <br/>
Childrens remarks dont bother me.  When my youngest was newborn, and I&#39;d take both kids somewhere, and could hear kids asking their moms about my kids, the ones I appreciated were the moms who would say, &#39;look how lucky they are! They have a beautiful baby, and that little girl has new baby sister!&#39;  This was great for me, because my first child had jealousy issues at first, and when she&#39;d hear that stuff, I think it made her realize that siblings could be a good thing.<br/>
