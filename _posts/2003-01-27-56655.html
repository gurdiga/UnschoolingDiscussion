<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258750940">Forgive more rambles but...<br/>
I remember hearing about a parent who homeschooled several of her kids<br/>
through school to graduate very early.  This intense school-at-home<br/>
prepaired them for college early and then the kids went into...guess<br/>
what?!  Teaching/Academia.<br/>
What else do they know??<br/>
<br/>
With all due respect to the really good teachers out there, this<br/>
reminded me of the saying &quot;Those who can DO. those who can&#39;t teach! <br/>
<br/>
I wonder what Susan (of TWTM) would be doing if she had been unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck Sandra.  &quot;Knock em dead&quot;<br/>

I&#39;ll settle for just not being knocked dead myself, but thank you very much <br/>
for the encouragement and further ideas for me!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-519085590">My father started going to Cooper Union to go into engineering. By this time<br/>
he had already been working hands on with electronics for a few years, so<br/>
had practical experience. Within 1 semester he dropped out because the<br/>
curriculum was memorization of facts instead of teaching the students WHERE<br/>
to find the info when they need it. He found it to be a huge waste of<br/>
time...ended up working for IBM for a number of years and had his own<br/>
computer consulting business&#39; on and off over the years. All self taught. He<br/>
is also a supporter of homeschooling and now after a visit (he and my mother<br/>
live in the Gambia) with face to face discussion of unschooling he is a<br/>
supporter of this method as well.<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is that although he was proud of me for getting a Masters in<br/>
secondary ed/English I think he always had that attitude re: those who can<br/>
do; those who can&#39;t, teach.<br/>
<br/>
Life is about growth and change...and I love my children enough to let them<br/>
grow their own way:)<br/>
