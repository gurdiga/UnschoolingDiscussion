They worked those to death in public school. We even did a butterfly/moth one

present at all...anything interesting to a child musically inclined that she

she thinks its boring. She also hates repitition....including anything she 
already learned a year ago. How do I show her that what she may have learned is 
worth going over again to see if there is new information that has recently come 
to light or something she may have missed the first time around because she

<div id="ygrps-yiv-821392580">Well, for what it&#39;s worth, here&#39;s what I do. If I know<br/>
my kids are interested in something, I get materials I<br/>
come across (if they&#39;re affordable or free) and just<br/>
leave them lying enticingly around, or just say look<br/>
what I got and start working on it myself if I&#39;m<br/>
interested, and they&#39;ll join me. For example, they<br/>
were really into King Arthur last year. So I got<br/>
everything from  a Monty Python: Quest for the Holy<br/>
Grail video to 3-d castle puzzles. We read A<br/>
Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#39;s court, got<br/>
medieval paper dolls, and devoured all the library<br/>
books on the topic. If I&#39;d found a King Arthur<br/>
wordsearch puzzle, though, they&#39;d never have done it,<br/>
because they hate wordsearch puzzles. Sometimes things<br/>
flop. Right now, we&#39;re into Colonial times, and they<br/>
thought they hated those Dear America books (fictional<br/>
but historically accurate journals of kids from<br/>
different eras) but I found a great colonial one, so I<br/>
just started reading it aloud to them one night, and<br/>
they love it. If I&#39;d just left that book on the table,<br/>
they&#39;d have ignored it. <br/>
<br/>
So I guess it&#39;s a matter of not only knowing what<br/>
topics they like, but also what ways they like to<br/>
explore those topics. <br/>
<br/>
My own kids seem to have designed their own thematic<br/>
mud this week. :) Seriously! Building mud castles and<br/>
moats, digging up worms, compost, gardening.<br/>
Everything is mud lately. If someone asked them what<br/>
they were learning, I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;d say they<br/>
were studying mud. Well, it *is* April! <br/>

Or you can invite her to join you for concerts, library listening room excursions, cultural events, vidoes of concerts and musicals, etc.  Talk about everything together, sharing thoughts and feelings and exploring issues.  See if any fires are lit.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would definitely take a break from the Unit
Studies. How about going to a museum or the Library, just for fun?&nbsp;
does your Library have CD&#39;s or other music you can sheck out and listen
to? You could both learn about her favorite musical artist together....Ask
the Librarian for some help. You could also go sight seeing in your own
area just as if you were new to town. This could incorporate some map reading,
some math, some social studies, all done informally. If you need documentation
for your state, then collect tourist pamphlets from the palces you visit.
Does your town have some free or affordable places to&nbsp; explore? How
about going to a park?&nbsp; I agree with the idea of taking in a concert.&nbsp;
Do you or your daughter have a hobby? If so, spend time on them together.
My son sometimes plays with Legos while I crochet in the same room.
<br>You could also ask her if she has any ideas. Be prepared for the unusual
when you do this. I have asked and been hit with everything from&nbsp;
&quot;Let&#39;s make muffins&quot; to &quot;Let&#39;s go to the Art Museum&quot;. and &quot;Let&#39;s take a
walk.&quot;

<br/>
By doing it with  games, movies, recorded music, photos, paintings, trips to <br/>
zoos or museums and not by it being anything that looks like school or <br/>
&quot;education&quot; to her.<br/>
<br/>
If a book was really good a year ago, she might enjoy having it read to her <br/>
again now or next year.  If the reason (to her, at least) is just because <br/>
it&#39;s a good book, and not because it&#39;s good for her, it will be better <br/>
received (not just emotionally, but intellectually).<br/>

&gt;Well, it worked all right! The whole family was<br/>
&gt;gathered around the computer oohing and ahhing and<br/>
&gt;wowing over the photographs of the cob houses and<br/>
&gt;ESPECIALLY the mixing dance and the muddy kids. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259017681">We also use family interests for learning.  I don&#39;t limit it to the <br/>
children&#39;s interests.  If I or my dh are interested in something, I&#39;ll try <br/>
to find something (usually a book, video or tv show) that&#39;s at a kid level <br/>
also.  One of our nearby library&#39;s has a service where they will gather the <br/>
books, etc. for you about anything.  I haven&#39;t tried it yet because I keep <br/>
forgetting to call them.  I will also show my kids where books about certain <br/>
subjects are shelved at the library.  I like to check out the new book <br/>
shelves and will get books for the kids even if it&#39;s been awhile since they <br/>
expressed an interest in something.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, for what it&#39;s worth, here&#39;s what I do. If I know<br/>
&gt;my kids are interested in something, I get materials I<br/>
&gt;come across (if they&#39;re affordable or free) and just<br/>
&gt;leave them lying enticingly around, or just say look<br/>
&gt;what I got and start working on it myself if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;interested, and they&#39;ll join me. For example, they<br/>
&gt;were really into King Arthur last year. So I got<br/>
&gt;everything from  a Monty Python: Quest for the Holy<br/>
&gt;Grail video to 3-d castle puzzles. We read A<br/>
&gt;Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#39;s court, got<br/>
&gt;medieval paper dolls, and devoured all the library<br/>
&gt;books on the topic. If I&#39;d found a King Arthur<br/>
&gt;wordsearch puzzle, though, they&#39;d never have done it,<br/>
&gt;because they hate wordsearch puzzles. Sometimes things<br/>
&gt;flop. Right now, we&#39;re into Colonial times, and they<br/>
&gt;thought they hated those Dear America books (fictional<br/>
&gt;but historically accurate journals of kids from<br/>
&gt;different eras) but I found a great colonial one, so I<br/>
&gt;just started reading it aloud to them one night, and<br/>
&gt;they love it. If I&#39;d just left that book on the table,<br/>
&gt;they&#39;d have ignored it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So I guess it&#39;s a matter of not only knowing what<br/>
&gt;topics they like, but also what ways they like to<br/>
&gt;explore those topics.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My own kids seem to have designed their own thematic<br/>
&gt;mud this week. :) Seriously! Building mud castles and<br/>
&gt;moats, digging up worms, compost, gardening.<br/>
&gt;Everything is mud lately. If someone asked them what<br/>
&gt;they were learning, I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;d say they<br/>
&gt;were studying mud. Well, it *is* April!<br/>
