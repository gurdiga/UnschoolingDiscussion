<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787807410">I can identify with this sentiment, actually...<br/>
<br/>
I am STILL trying to get the guys to read more. We do not limit TV, video <br/>
games or computer. One or more always seems to be on around here. However, I <br/>
know families (schooled and home/unschooled) who do limit, either by not <br/>
having some of the options or by agreeing beforehand on when the screen goes <br/>
on or off. And their not-yet-teen boys are avid  readers -- some are into <br/>
comic books, others read kids&#39; chapter books like RL Stine, Harry Potter and <br/>
Hardy Boys, one is reading classic fiction (ie, Dickens, Twain). (In fact, <br/>
when I was a kid, my parents limited strictly, and I had read classic <br/>
fiction by the time I was 11 or 12.) Meanwhile, mine (10 and 6 -- 6yo is not <br/>
a reader yet) are watching Disney Channel and Nickelodeon or playing <br/>
&quot;Zelda&quot;! My question is, is there anyone out there who does not limit TV, <br/>
etc., and has kids, esp. boys, who would prefer to read? If so, I&#39;d like  to <br/>
hear about the circumstances under which that happens and what they are <br/>
reading.<br/>

Boy can I identify with this!<br/>
In our first year of homeschooling I was very intent on encouraging Jordan<br/>
to read more.ï¿½ I remember one day saying (rather impatiently) &quot;Put down that<br/>
book, it&#39;s time to go to the library!&quot; That stopped me in my tracks and made<br/>
me reevaluate the whole &quot;school at home&quot; thing. What an eye opener! LOL<br/>

<br/>
I never have had strict limits on TV, but we&#39;ve had periods of no cable<br/>
(thus little worth watching).  After spending time on this list, I realize<br/>
that I was placing some limits on their tv, but I can honestly say that<br/>
they&#39;ve never had strict limits such as so many hours per day or not being<br/>
allowed to watch certain things.  It has been about 1 1/2 years since I&#39;ve<br/>
removed all limits.<br/>
<br/>
7yod doesn&#39;t read on her own, but loves to be read to and listen to books on<br/>
tape and watch tv/movies.  She has listened to many books that would be<br/>
considered way above her reading/listening level by those who pay attention<br/>
to that classification.  Right now, her dad is reading to her, Golf My Way<br/>
by Jack Nicholson.  Maybe not a *classic*, but certainly not the typical<br/>
bedtime story for a 7 yo.<br/>
<br/>
10yod was reading at about 6 1/2 and reads an incredible amount and variety<br/>
on her own and also still loves to have me read aloud to her and to read<br/>
aloud to me.  She reads both fiction and non-fiction on her own and chooses<br/>
both typical and non-typical books for her age.  I have never had any rules<br/>
on what they should read.  I have discussed fiction vs non-fiction in terms<br/>
of just explaining the difference, but have never suggested that one is<br/>
better or more important to read than another.  I belong to an adult book<br/>
club and 10yod is fascinated and asks me all sorts of questions about it.<br/>
<br/>
Both my kids also enjoy watching tv.  I was raised watching tv and loving to<br/>
read.  I probably watch the least amount of tv in my family, because I have<br/>
lots of books I&#39;d like to get to.  But I honestly wish I had more time to<br/>
watch tv/movies.  There is so much great stuff to experience in that medium.<br/>
<br/>
What makes something a classic anyway?  Should everyone in the world read<br/>
all of Shakespeare and Dickens and Hawkings and the Bible and Asimov and<br/>
Lewis and EB White and Silverstein and every other great book ever written<br/>
and read them all by the age of 18?  I certainly think that the more we know<br/>
about various things, the more we *get* from conversations in which tidbits<br/>
come up from various literature, history, or ancient myth.  But it is<br/>
impossible for any one person to know everything.  We do not have to know<br/>
everything there is to know before we turn 18 and it would be impossible<br/>
anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My oldest son would rather read than do just about anything else   Well, he&#39;s <br/>
16 now, so anything else besides something that involves girls :-).     He <br/>
has always loved to read.. never been limited on TV.. he watched a lot when he <br/>
was younger, but still liked reading better.  He has read more books than most <br/>
folks read in a lifetime, and he read them of his own accord, not by <br/>
&quot;assignment&quot;.  He does go to school, but every book he has been assigned to read, he <br/>
had already read, usually several years before it was assigned.  <br/>
<br/>
  My dd does not care for TV, but she is not really an avid reader.  If a <br/>
book really grabs her interest, she will stick with it til she&#39;s finished, but <br/>
often she loses interest and does not finish a book.   My 11 yo son HATES to <br/>
read.  He will avoid it at all costs.   He can read, he just does not enjoy it at <br/>
all.  He loves TV, computer and video games.    He has gaming magazines and <br/>
such, but he just looks at the pictures or asks me to read the articles to him <br/>
if he is interested.   My 8 yo son is a lot like my dd, he can take or leave <br/>
reading.   If there is a book he really likes, he will read it over and over.  <br/>
But, lots of times I offer to read to him or listen to him read, he declines.  <br/>
He does still perfer me to read aloud to him over him reading to me.  <br/>
<br/>
  I love books and I love to read.  My oldest son is most like me in that <br/>
regard.  My other children&#39;s &quot;less than enthusiastic&quot;  ideas about reading do not <br/>
come from too much TV, a non-supportive reading environment, or lack of <br/>
resources.  It is just part of thier personalities, thier dispostions.    I think <br/>
love of reading is inherent, like love of animals or gardening.   There is not <br/>
much influence folks have as far as &quot;making&quot; kids love to read.    Yeah, you <br/>
can make someone HATE to read by forcing it on them or shaming them for not <br/>
being proficient at it.    <br/>

read?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 I have 2 boys (9 and 7). They love being read to. and they love audio tapes<br/>
as much as  movies. My oldest was reading at night for a couple of hours but<br/>
has stopped since we relaxed bedtime. It&#39;s usually quite late by the time I<br/>
finish reading to them so he goes straight to sleep. ]<br/>
<br/>
Jacob, 7, doesn&#39;t read books on his own but I think that&#39;s mostly because he<br/>
finds the books he loves a little too difficult. It&#39;s more fun to listen to<br/>
me! They both love books and I&#39;m sure as they become more confident readers<br/>
that they will read on their own. They see Mark and I read all the time and<br/>
there are lots of books around. Jess just the other day said that books are<br/>
great because they take you into another world.<br/>
<br/>
I have just tried to make our reading time really special. I know for me<br/>
some of my best memories are of my mum lying on my bed with me reading me to<br/>
sleep. Mum had four more children after me and I don&#39;t think she read to the<br/>
others very much. I am the only one of us who reads voraciously and I think<br/>
it&#39;s because of the feelings generated in me from those times with mum.<br/>
<br/>
We finished reading  The Carnivorous Carnival (L. Snicket) and I asked the<br/>
boys if they wanted to try HP. They haven&#39;t been interested at all. They<br/>
said okay (doubtfully) and we finished the Philosopher&#39;s Stone in less than<br/>
a week and they&#39;re hooked. I&#39;m alittle hoarse but they are soooo excited.<br/>
I&#39;ve read 7 chapters of The Chamber of Secrets in 2 days so I&#39;m hoping that<br/>
the Prisoner of Azkaban arrives in time or we won&#39;t know what to do with<br/>
ourselves!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m dying to read Order of the Phoenix but $45 for a book is just<br/>
outrageous. I just hope we don&#39;t have to wait too long for a paperback which<br/>
will probably still be nearly $20.<br/>

 <br/>
I read very early as a child and remember being so excited to get home from school, in first grade so that I could lie on the couch and read my Grimm&#39;s Fairy Tales and Hans Christian Anderson...  They were my first fat hard back books and were such a great escape.  I hadn&#39;t been completely conscious of how much I had expected my children to be like this until I read Sandra&#39;s article in this month&#39;s HEM magazine and I realized that i sooo have a picture, still, of home schooling being about lots of time to read without interruption.  I hated being called to dinner because I would have to put down my book.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have always read to them a lot and they have asked for it as well.  This past year, before coming here, I had established daily &quot;reading time&quot; (based on a book by Lucy Calkins) when they would pick out lots of books and we would cuddle up in bed or on the couch and read for an hour.  It could happen any time of day. I never scheduled it in, (well, I guess evey day is a schedule &lt;g&gt; ) but I did strongly encourage it to happen.   After just a few weeks, reading had suddenly become a Mommy expectation, another power struggle.   Now that I have given all that up, they are slowly starting to bring me books again during the day.  We do read to them every night before bed but they love that.  We are really into Roald Dahl&#39;s shorter books, like George&#39;s Marvelous Medicine, and The Giraffe the Pelly and Me.  Also, I read somewhere that boys like nonfiction and joke books a lot.  Girls, for the most part are suposedly into fiction more. We go to the library every week and they get lots of<br/>
 all kinds but the non fiction dinosaur books are my three yr. old boy&#39;s favorites and the non fiction animal, sports and joke books are the oldest boy&#39;s favorites.   The older one is starting to want to sound out words, very few and verysporadically and I am not doing anything unless asked.  I did too much all year and am shocked he has any interest in it now!    And yes, we do (as of last month) allow mostly unrestricted TV.  It&#39;s Summer and they are very into being outside and running around so I haven&#39;t had to deal with the TV watching much.  Just a few days of a few hours in a row and I learned that I could survive it fine, even enjoy it with them!  I love TV and I don&#39;t watch that much so why did i assume that was all they would do?<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I love TV and I don&#39;t watch that much  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I loved this statement.<br/>
<br/>
Too many people seem to think that &quot;I love something&quot; means &quot;I don&#39;t love <br/>
anything else.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I love chocolate, but I have brownie mixes in the cabinet that have been <br/>
there for two months.  The only chocolate I&#39;ve had in a week has been some <br/>
chocolate syrup on ice cream Wednesday or so, and that&#39;s even having a bag of dark <br/>
chocolate in a drawer right next to my computer.<br/>
<br/>
You can love something and not LIVE there hourly or even daily or weekly.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s first real reading (no illustrations) amazed me.  I knew he could <br/>
read magazine captions and cards, but in preparation for a karate belt test when <br/>
he was nine or ten, he read (right in front of me, in the car) a chapter on <br/>
the history of Okinawan karate, from a book NOT written for kids, and translated <br/>
from Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
That wasn&#39;t easy reading, but he showed no indication that it should be too <br/>
hard for him.  He read it and passed the oral part of his belt test.   I acted <br/>
casual, but it was serious acting! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has only read one novel.  Maybe two.  He had a book he wouldn&#39;t let <br/>
Holly see, so I&#39;m guessing it was somewhat nasty.  Fan-fiction style of stuff.  <br/>
It was borrowed.  And he read a novel based on The Legend of Five Rings card <br/>
game.   Most of his reading is technical--games rules, and tournament policies, <br/>
and administrative stuff having to do with games and gaming stores.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see Marty reading for fun, but he&#39;ll read magazine articles about <br/>
movies or music or games or comedians he likes, and his rate and comprehension <br/>
seem to be mature/normal/non-kidlike.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s reading novels now.  She wants me to find her a  Nancy Drew book.  <br/>
Any recommendations on a good first one?  Maybe some of you have girls who&#39;ve <br/>
read some lately.<br/>

Hi Sandra - The books are numbered, so she could always start with #1 :0).<br/>
I buy them at antique stores (usually about $3) because I like to read the<br/>
original version (I don&#39;t know if all of the new ones have been pc&#39;d, but<br/>
some of them have.)  ~Rue<br/>

&lt;&lt;My question is, is there anyone out there who does not limit TV,<br/>
etc., and has kids, esp. boys, who would prefer to read? If so, I&#39;d like  to<br/>
hear about the circumstances under which that happens and what they are<br/>
reading.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kids are very young yet. Well at least the two that do read. Tara, the<br/>
school child, won&#39;t read anything unless she absolutely has to. Joseph is<br/>
only 8 and doesn not ever have to turn off TV if he doesn&#39;t want to. He<br/>
stays up a lot later than the rest. Very often, late at night, he will take<br/>
books in his room to read in bed. He has the choice to do lots of other<br/>
things, but he wants to read. We have tons of cable channels so it&#39;s not<br/>
like there isn&#39;t anything on TV. Many times I have to go in his room and<br/>
gather up all the books he&#39;s been taking in there and out them back out<br/>
where everyone can get to them. Sometimes they are kid books and sometimes I<br/>
find encyclopedia&#39;s in there too. Lately he prefers to draw. He&#39;s doing<br/>
something with YuGiOh. He draws pictures and then writes things, like are on<br/>
the cards, on the pictures too. So he&#39;s even reading there. He&#39;s not a<br/>
little book worm or anything, but he definitely choses to read many times<br/>
when he could chose something else.<br/>

Air mail to Australia is really expensive.<br/>
Them sending you money that you don&#39;t have to pay to exchange is also <br/>
expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Two pounds of book to Australia:<br/>

It&#39;s not going to fit in one of those envelopes.  For letting it take a <br/>

so far gone already I&#39;d be laminating until I was 75!!! He has a whole shoe<br/>
box full of cards he has made himself. All drawn with pictures he drew.<br/>
Literally hundreds of them and I see no end in sight. Thing is he has the<br/>
real YuGiOh cards too. Tons of them. Not sure why he goes through so much<br/>
trouble (seems to me not at all to him!) but he&#39;s really good and loves to<br/>
do it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825213380">Follow-up on Nancy Drew - the series has as important a social<br/>
context for its time as does Junie B or Unfortunate Events or<br/>
Captain Underwear have for ours.  I happened to love the Hardy<br/>
Boys and Ruth Fielding and the Bobbsy Twins and Campfire Girls<br/>
and Cherry Ames and all the others of the genre.  My grandfather<br/>
had every one of them from when my mother was the only child of<br/>
the Academic Dean of a Normal School; I would immerse myself for<br/>
days at a time in the summers when we visited.  It doesn&#39;t take<br/>
long to spot the formula or ferret out the social norms being<br/>
conveyed.  Some of the bowdlerized revisions cheat you of that<br/>
second part of the joy, so make sure you know which ones you want<br/>

| Shadow Ranch<br/>
| Lilac Inn<br/>

| | &lt;&lt;  The original hardbacks. I too have not read the<br/>

| |<br/>
| | From the time the books were new, they were updated regularly<br/>
| to keep them<br/>
| | modern.  I knew about that in the 60&#39;s, that the versions we<br/>
| were reading had<br/>
| | updated radios and cars, and clothes.  It&#39;s the first series<br/>
I<br/>

| | hoping is maybe a girl has been reading some and can<br/>
recommend<br/>
| a particularly<br/>
| | good one.<br/>
| |<br/>
| | When I was a kid, I liked The Secret in the Old Clock and the<br/>
| River Boat<br/>
| | whatever, but many years have passed and maybe there&#39;s<br/>
| something newer and cooler!<br/>

came out there were 455 holds on those 60 copies.  I checked the cassette<br/>
(I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s unabridged) and there were something like 27 holds on 6<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235099206"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Okay, now I really am depressed! $18.00!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>$18.00 book ~ how much can international postage be?? Certainly not more<br/>
than<br/>
$20?!? Enlighten me! Why can&#39;t one of us send ya one??<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing it has to do with the Australian dollar.  I know that $18 US<br/>
has until recently translated into about $27 Canadian.  Maybe $18 US<br/>
translate to $45 or whatever it was Australian.  Then you have to look at<br/>
living costs and wage rates to really compare.  Things cost more in Canada<br/>
(in general) but wages are higher for the most part.<br/>
