<div id="ygrps-yiv-966448832">My MIL sent our boys a $60 gift card for Target.  Included was a note that<br/>
said to go buy some school supplies.  So off to Target we went and we came<br/>
home with a new pair of track pants for each boy, a new shirt for each, a<br/>
tent set (tent, child&#39;s folding chair, sleeping bag, flashlight, and<br/>
thermometer/compass/whistle/magnifying glass) and a new Spongebob DVD.<br/>
<br/>
School supplies are great!  LOL<br/>
