<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967336761">I have a son who is nearly 11 who I&#39;ve been homeschooling for going on four <br/>
years. I want to go all the way with unschooling but have a husband who is <br/>
seriously opposed where math is concerned. He wants to see a structured math <br/>
program followed on most days. He has seen the benefits of not enforcing <br/>
learning in a lot of subjects. He&#39;s supportive of unschooling as far as <br/>
writing or spelling or grammar or handwriting is concerned. He&#39;s pretty sure <br/>
Glenn will learn science and history naturally as we go along. He&#39;s read one <br/>
John Holt book and he read Dumbing Us Down. Really liked both of them. Agreed <br/>
with them. I have read him some really wonderful stuff I&#39;ve read about <br/>
unschooling math written by some of the people who are on this list. I&#39;ve <br/>
read to him from Why Children Fail which certainly seems appropriate to this <br/>
issue. But he just can&#39;t go along with unschooling math. He is the kind of <br/>
person who really needs to control others and will up the ante when <br/>
challenged. If you cross him when he&#39;s not in the mood to be crossed, he&#39;ll <br/>
make life much more unpleasant. He&#39;s being somewhat unpleasant lately. So far <br/>
we&#39;re conceding the math issue to him. It&#39;s seemed like a tradeoff to me. <br/>
Glenn and I get to be home with each other and the bulk of our day is <br/>
unstructured and though the math is a sore point, we get it out of the way <br/>
fairly quickly. But it&#39;s not the way I want it to be. Have any of you dealt <br/>
with husbands like this? What do you do?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m a person with a pretty strong need to plan and control things,<br/>
people, etc.  In me, I have to admit that it comes from being deeply<br/>
insecure and fearful.  Planning/bossing is just a thing I do, kind of a<br/>
bad habit, that helps me feel more secure.<br/>
<br/>
This may not be where your dh is coming from.  Or it may, but it may be<br/>
a lot harder for a man to admit it.<br/>
<br/>
I took &quot;school math&quot; for 14 years and never hated it.  However, I don&#39;t<br/>
persue or enjoy it now as a part of my life.<br/>

there are things in between unschooling and very structured that <br/>

ahead of grade level in this one subject?  It sounds to me like he&#39;s got <br/>
some baggage from the past.  I&#39;m reminded of some of the sports dads my <br/>
husband (the coach) has had to deal with.  Guys who never went nearly as <br/>
far as they wanted to in their sport, but by God their son is going to do <br/>
it.  I really feel for those poor kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh dear.  I don&#39;t have time right now, or I&#39;d go into a long rant about how <br/>
dangerous it is to push kids into algebra before they are 13 or 14 or 15 at <br/>
least. It is worse than counterproductive.<br/>
<br/>
There is &quot;algebraic thinking&quot; - that is fine -- kids do it pretty naturally <br/>
anyway and it can be really satisfying and fun -- and there are ways for <br/>
parents who aren&#39;t skilled in this area to encourage it in their children, <br/>
but that is VERY different than formal algebra studied in a systematic, <br/>
standard way. I have super strong opinions that that is a major mistake to <br/>
start early. I&#39;d try to find other mathematical things to do even for a kid <br/>
who was WANTING to study algebra -- there are so MANY other areas to explore <br/>
that are so much more appropriate and that a younger kid will get so much <br/>
more out of. <br/>
<br/>
You know - we could probably flood this list with suggestions for math <br/>
programs -- and I&#39;d, personally, probably enjoy it -- but I have to admit it <br/>
feels odd to do it here. Incongruent and risky (to use a couple of great math <br/>
terms &lt;BEG&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always skittish about recommending stuff and having it be interpreted as <br/>
me recommending that parents pick a program and make the kids do it. Although <br/>
I&#39;ve spent a lot of time looking at math resources, I think it is better, <br/>
truly BETTER, for a kid to do NO formal math if it is parent-pushed. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I always worry, too, about the fact that so many adults <br/>
have math anxiety/issues/phobias/hatred/fears/etc. that even unschooling <br/>
parents will, inadvertently, pass their own feelings along to their kids <br/>
without even realizing it. Kids aren&#39;t going to be following up on math stuff <br/>
that they might otherwise be interested in if they get negative vibes from <br/>
their parents -- math anxiety (generated by the way schools teach math) is <br/>
often manifested in avoidance -- people don&#39;t necessarily admit they have <br/>
math anxiety, they just go through life always avoiding math. Kids might pick <br/>
up on it being something to avoid. So sometimes I start thinking that a <br/>
really fun satisfying math program might be better than that --  since at <br/>
least the kids will have exposure and therefore the opportunity to get into <br/>
math if that is their inclination.<br/>
<br/>
ANyway -- I&#39;ve let myself get off the topic. <br/>
Yes -- I&#39;ll come up with some ideas for math programs that involve <br/>
investigation and exploration. I&#39;ll have to dig in my boxes of stuff -- I <br/>
have everything pack up because we&#39;re moving kids&#39; bedrooms around right now.<br/>

it&#39;s as simple as that.  If you believe that forcing/coercing/cajoling.<br/>
etc. your child to do some math papers or programs that he doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to do is wrong, then I guess I myself can&#39;t imagine doing it and feeling<br/>
right in my own skin. I&#39;ve always been a single mom, so I have no<br/>
real-world experience with this and may be full of it... but there you<br/>
are.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I&#39;ve done on occasion is just sit down and think about the<br/>
math that Cacie does as part of life. I think most of the computational<br/>
skills she&#39;s learned have been acquired through games - not &quot;educational<br/>
games&quot; but games where scorekeeping was required, like Rummy, Poker, 5<br/>
Crowns, Midnight Party, Yahtzee, Probe, Bazaar... she loves games. Today<br/>
we were at Chuck E Cheese with some friends, and her friend was trying to<br/>
figure out how many tickets she&#39;d have if she added the ones she&#39;d just<br/>
won, and then if she subtracted the price of a certain prize... and Cacie<br/>
just knew all of the answers instantly, she didn&#39;t even have to think<br/>
about it. She also does a lot of logic, algebra, and geometry stuff,<br/>
through games, software, brain teasers, life... it&#39;s generally not<br/>
labeled as such anywhere but it is. I have occasionally enumberated and<br/>
described all of these activities to well-meaning people who thought she<br/>
wasn&#39;t &quot;doing any math&quot;, and it seemed to make an impression. One woman I<br/>
know kept a &quot;math log&quot; because she needed to document her son&#39;s math<br/>
studies for her charter school, and she just noted down anything she<br/>
could think of that he had done that involved any kind of math skills.<br/>
Some people are just accustomed to seeing something written out in black<br/>
and white, and any sort of documentation or &quot;piece of paper&quot; makes an<br/>
impression.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about all of this, I&#39;m again amazed at how much Cacie can do,<br/>
how much she knows, and how effortless it all has been for her. I<br/>
sometimes imagine a world full of people realizing how years of their<br/>
lives were stolen from them by the public school system - it makes me<br/>
angry to think about it, I remember my school years mostly as very, very<br/>
boring, with me trying to do anything that would make the time pass<br/>
faster. If someone today gave me the gift of of 656 days (7 hours a day<br/>
times 12.5 years) to do with what I pleased, I can imagine so many<br/>
wonderful things to fill them with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878526272">***I&#39;m not sure you can unschool and still make your dh happy, and maybe<br/>

right in my own skin. I&#39;ve always been a single mom, so I have no<br/>
real-world experience with this and may be full of it... but there you<br/>
are.***<br/>
<br/>
I have a similar lack of experience in that my husband is so calm about<br/>
unschooling. Granted, he had a long time to get used to the idea &lt;g&gt; as I<br/>
became rabidly unschoolish while pregnant with our first.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s to the point now that I had to talk him into letting me do the &quot;Reading<br/>
in 100 Easy Lessons&quot; book with Brit. It did not sit well with his<br/>
conservative unschooling heart (or with mine either, I confess, but after a<br/>
lot of hashing we didn&#39;t see a better alternative for what she wanted and,<br/>
so far so good).<br/>
<br/>
When we do disagree about child rearing, he&#39;s swayed by common sense (and I<br/>
hope I am, too &lt;g&gt;). If I&#39;ve read a dozen books, talked to 20 people and<br/>
thought about something for weeks, he&#39;s not one to stomp around issuing<br/>
directives. And if he did, I&#39;d suspect an adult temper tantrum and wouldn&#39;t<br/>
think of inconveniencing our daughters with it (though I would try to help<br/>
him work out what the real problem was so he&#39;d feel better).<br/>
<br/>
The answer to the problem husband may be to sit down with him and dig to the<br/>
real issue. What is he afraid will happen if there are no math lessons? If<br/>
he isn&#39;t willing to read about unschooling, unschooled math success stories,<br/>
post to a list like this or talk to people at unschooling.com, I would start<br/>
to question his right to be involved in the decision-making process until he<br/>
educated himself.<br/>
<br/>
***One thing that I&#39;ve done on occasion is just sit down and think about the<br/>

games&quot; but games where scorekeeping was required, like Rummy, Poker, 5<br/>
Crowns, Midnight Party, Yahtzee, Probe, Bazaar... she loves games.***<br/>
<br/>
Ditto with Brittany. She likes the way numbers work, you can see her<br/>
enjoying it. She occasionally comes to me to report that 4+2 and 3+3 both<br/>
equal 6, or that when she&#39;s 23 her cousin (11 years older) will be 34.<br/>
<br/>
Last night she wanted to know what came after thousands, then after<br/>
millions, then after billions, then after trillions, until I had to laugh<br/>
and say, &quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; I guess I should go look it up and let her know.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not afraid of arithmetic, but I am of higher math, because of my own<br/>
schooling, and I worry sometimes about being one of the parents PamS was<br/>
talking about who can turn their kids away from math without thinking about<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I try really hard not to let that influence me, and luckily my husband (and<br/>

you can tell your husband that someone with a BS in math and an MS<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We haven&#39;t explored this and it&#39;s a good point. One of the reasons my <br/>
husband had initially liked the idea of homeschooling was that our <br/>
son hadn&#39;t learned much of any math when he was in first grade in <br/>
public school. Once he was home he started picking it up pretty <br/>
easily. When we first started homeschooling, I didn&#39;t know much about <br/>
unschooling and from what little I did know I wasn&#39;t too interested. <br/>
So for his first two years of homeschooling I&#39;d make up problems for <br/>
him to do, since I hadn&#39;t found a book/program that suited us. The <br/>
first year we did mostly mental math and using logic to arrive at <br/>
answers. Glenn did move ahead of his grade level with some facets of <br/>
arithmetic/computation. His dad liked that and probably assumed that <br/>
Glenn would always be ahead of his public schooled peers. I imagine <br/>
he&#39;s told people at work that Glenn did such and such as a third <br/>
grader or fourth grader or whatever. He&#39;s probably not ready to give <br/>
up that vision of his son to one of his son learning math at whatever <br/>
pace he wants to. I&#39;ve seen a bit of the sports dad character in him, <br/>
it&#39;s probably a good comparison. We won&#39;t be inviting him to any more <br/>
karate belt exams, at least for a while  :-(<br/>

<br/>
Pam who wrote the wait-on-algebra information is &quot;abd&quot; (all but degree) or so <br/>

she teaches college-level math.<br/>

second. I went looking for both letters a couple of weeks ago, <br/>
wanting to reread what Keith said, and couldn&#39;t find that second <br/>
letter anywhere. Here is the first letter anyway:<br/>
<br/>
*************************************<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t know the ages of your children (or yourself or your <br/>
 </span></blockquote>husband :) but it doesn&#39;t really matter.  Think of your everyday <br/>
actions, then look at how they can be represented with math.  Scaling <br/>
of cooking ingredients (ratios), boiling water (physics or <br/>
chemistry), bouncing a ball (physics), watching the moon circle the <br/>
earth (geometry), (as in why does a ball fall to earth but the moon <br/>
does not?).  Find art with a protractor, compass, straight edge, <br/>
(like the Greeks) or just play with graph paper (geometry & trig).  <br/>
Look for symetry in nature or man made artifacts (ratios again).  <br/>
Look for applications of fractions (ratios, division, <br/>
combinatorics).  Talk about the lottery or statistics in elections or <br/>
sports.<br/>
 <br/>
Algebra and calculus are abstractions to be delved into once you see <br/>
the need for modeling in the first place.  Interest in &quot;the need&quot; I <br/>
find to be hinged on a budding interest in some tangible format.  Do <br/>
they like architecture or engineering (mud pies to model planes)?  <br/>
How about competitive puzzles (board games, cards, video games)?  My <br/>
son (12) just finished reassembling a TV. (The picture was cutting <br/>
out.)  He now knows that the insides are not some kind of magic.  We <br/>
talked a little about circuits and assembly and troubleshooting.  In <br/>
the process of finding the broken circuit, we talked about TV signals <br/>
and waveforms and how both audio and video came from the same <br/>
antenna.  I didn&#39;t try to go into the math of electronics (really <br/>
complicated modeling), but he now is a little more interested in just <br/>
how that stuff works.  It took him 3 days of putzing around with it, <br/>
(and a $20 part) and mostly all I did was encourage him to be careful <br/>
and take small steps.<br/>
 <br/>
I think the greatest thing I have learned from homeschooling, it the <br/>
fact that it is ok to say, &quot;I don&#39;t know, let&#39;s find out.&quot;  The other <br/>
side of that is being able to judge when the child is bored with the <br/>
subject and you can let it slide.<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck,<br/>
