<div id="ygrps-yiv-1626177951">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I thought I would introduce myself.  My name is Debbi, wife to Ron <br/>
and mom to my 5 children Je-Ve&#39; 14yod, RJ 12yos, Jacob 10yos, Corbin <br/>
4yos, and Joshua 2yos.  We live in Utah, in the Salt Lake City area.<br/>
<br/>
We recently began homeschooling (again).  We are going with more of <br/>
an unschooling aproach this time, and it seems to be working well, <br/>
(more with my older ones that my 10yob).<br/>
<br/>
I let them study whatever they are interested in during the day, and <br/>
tell/write about it, before they go out to play, so we can keep a <br/>
record for the school district (in case they ask, like it&#39;s any of <br/>
their business anyway).<br/>
<br/>
We are reading Summer of the Monkey&#39;s right now, and loving it.  I am <br/>
interested in learning more about how to learn grammar, spelling, <br/>
math etc... in an unschooling way.  Any ideas?  Any websites?  I am <br/>
all ears...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-636884097">Debbie,<br/>
<br/>
Here are some ideas:<br/>
<br/>
Grammar:<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll pick that up just like they learned to talk.  They might not know the names of the parts of speech, but they&#39;ll know how to use English properly if they&#39;ve heard it and read it used properly.<br/>
<br/>
If they like MadLibs, that is a great way to introduce grammar but really...(and this is from my mom the English professor)...you do not need to teach grammar except where they are lacking in its actual use (like the rules for commas for example).<br/>
<br/>
Math:<br/>
<br/>
Math is all around you and I wouldn&#39;t push math in the traditional way.  I learned this the HARD way.  I *wanted* to unschool but math held me back.  I *wanted* to believe he&#39;d pick it up on his own but sheesh...he was almost 13!  I worried myself sick.  I needn&#39;t have ever worried.<br/>
<br/>
Guess what.  I laid off for a year.  This year, HE decided (at 14) that he would work through a math book.  And guess what else:  He is plowing through it as though it was the most natural thing in the world:  this after YEARS of struggling, pushing, tantrums and tears.<br/>
<br/>
What if he had never wanted to pick up a math book?  Well, I can see now that he really didn&#39;t even need to.  He is going through one now so he is familiar with it because he wants to go back to school next year....but the fact is, he isn&#39;t *learning* from the book.  He is *verifying* what he has already learned from life!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Writing:  <br/>
<br/>
My kids chat, email, and use LOTS of INstant messaging.  They can communicate.  All these things make spelling (and typing) important. I never taught them to type but they can &quot;hunt and peck&quot; as fast as I can type in the traditional way...and I type upwards of 78wpm.  I&#39;ve decided that the &quot;home row&quot; isn&#39;t all that important.<br/>
<br/>
As for content, let them tell you all about the things that are important to *them*.  write it down while they talk and show it to them.  Someday, they will want to write it themselves.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There are folders on specific subjects at www.unschooling.com, but my boys <br/>
(who are 13 and 16) have learned from writing (online) and reading (online, <br/>
gaming guides, magazines, games rules--some of those booklets are 100 pages <br/>
or more), and their spelling and grammar are great!<br/>
