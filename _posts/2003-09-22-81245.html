because I just can&#39;t get caught up reading it and my local lists are all very <br/>
active at this time too!  But I just couldn&#39;t keep me ole mouth shut, lol.  A <br/>
person&#39;s beliefs should be treated with great respect regardless of where they <br/>
came from or how they come up with them (the beliefs, that is). I believe <br/>
that disrespecting a persons beliefs is disrespecting the person. You don&#39;t have <br/>
to agree with them, You can question them, You can express that they are not <br/>
yours and that you don&#39;t like them or whatever. But in the end all we have are <br/>
our beliefs. I have not always been on the right side of my on views on <br/>
respecting someone&#39;s beliefs, I admit I have been bad occasionally. In the area that <br/>
I live my beliefs are considered by the majority as bad, wrong, sins, and if <br/>
my neighbors choice to talk to me they might decide to have me publicly <br/>
stoned, but they should be able to believe what ever they want. <br/>
Sandra, I too live with Trek-fans and they think I am <br/>
weird...........................<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And I believe that if someone&#39;s beliefs -- and the actions they justify<br/>
because of their beliefs -- are harmful to children or harmful to society in<br/>
general, people *should* speak up.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, beliefs are personal. And people have the right to believe whatever<br/>
they want. But beliefs affect people&#39;s choices, and those choices affect<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
I have a right to believe that red haired people are incarnations of the<br/>
devil. The belief by itself isn&#39;t harmful. But beliefs are used to filter<br/>
actions through. And that belief would make it a good choice to be hateful<br/>
to red haired people and to beat my red haired child.<br/>
<br/>
Some people see questioning someone&#39;s beliefs and pointing out their flaws<br/>
in them as disprespectful. Those people aren&#39;t going to feel very<br/>
comfortable here. <br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the list isn&#39;t to disrespect people or even to disrespect<br/>
ideas. That would be counter to the purpose of the list, I think, since I&#39;m<br/>
picturing it involving stamping something harmful/stupid/not acceptable<br/>
without exaining why it&#39;s harmful/stupid/not acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose is to examine ideas and beliefs and practices and see how those<br/>
help or prevent people from getting to unschooling and getting to more<br/>
joyful lives.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe here&#39;s a shorter way of saying what I was trying to say! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Out in life, people should feel free to believe whatever they believe that<br/>
isn&#39;t harming others. I won&#39;t go around to the Catholics and tell them<br/>
they&#39;re wrong because their beliefs won&#39;t lead people to the goal that I<br/>
think it&#39;s important to have. They have their goals. Hopefully goals they&#39;ve<br/>
examined. And they&#39;ve chosen the belief system that will help them get<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
But here on this list, people are asking by signing onto the list to be<br/>
helped towards the goal of unschooling. And any beliefs that get in the way<br/>
of that goal that are brought to the list will be examined and beliefs that<br/>
we&#39;ve found helpful will be brought up so people can help themselves get<br/>
where they&#39;re saying they&#39;d like to go.<br/>

&lt;&lt; So if my belief system led me to believe adults should introduce children <br/>
to<br/>
sex, that&#39;s a belief that should be treated with as much respect as &quot;be<br/>
kind&quot;? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Before anyone commits yes or no to that, there ARE people who believe this, <br/>
or the profess to believe it.<br/>
<br/>
Should they be as welcome on this list as anyone else?<br/>
<br/>
People who believe that to the point that they make life&#39;s decisions based on <br/>
it really SHOULD homeschool, for their own legal and social advantage.<br/>
<br/>
Is that as legitimate a reason to homeschool as any?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&gt; I believe <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that disrespecting a persons beliefs is disrespecting the person.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;So an adult who believes underage sex is a good thing should be treated as<br/>
respectfully as those who don&#39;t?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have less respect for a person who says a rape victim chose that fate than <br/>
I do for a person who believes in the possibility or liklihood that a rape <br/>
victim was innocent, and had not agreed in advance to go through that, so we <br/>
didn&#39;t need to feel sympathy for her.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who claims to respect all people equally hasn&#39;t thought much about <br/>
what &quot;respect&quot; means.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But in the end all we have are our beliefs.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a mini-van.<br/>
They didn&#39;t ask me what my beliefs were when we bought it.<br/>
If you need a ride, the beliefs of the people standing there won&#39;t give you a <br/>
ride as well as that mini-van.  Unless astral projection will do.  Or if you <br/>
REALLY believe in Star Trek and you can request to be beamed up.<br/>
