<div id="ygrps-yiv-219692492">Having been to my first and only &quot;unschooling Conference&quot;, (or any <br/>
other for that matter!), I must say &quot;Hooray! and &quot;Thanks a gazillion&quot; <br/>
for the great information and great speakers. To actually meet and <br/>
observe Sandra, Anne, Pam, and Mary in action was so soothing and <br/>
affirmimg. Having questions answered and fears put to rest has <br/>
solidified my commitment to my child; &quot;you shall always be free of <br/>
the public school dogma. You will always be healthy and curious!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They all touched so many people there. Sometimes a parent must feel <br/>
another&#39;s success or experience to firm resolve or take the next <br/>
step. We felt that and more. So...to all the folks who devoted time <br/>
and energy to coming and all the great people who brought them to <br/>
us...a deep sigh, a glad smile, and simple &quot;thank you&quot;! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040754486">Hi<br/>
We just got back from the conference.<br/>
We had a great time.  What a thrill to meet such awsome people.<br/>
My dh Bob and I totally love Kelly and Ben Lovejoy.  Talk about great <br/>
people!<br/>
The speakers were so wonderful.  I was on the verge of tears <br/>
listening to Anne and Mary and Pam.  They talked of things that <br/>
touched me deeply.  Sandra had me laughing and just generally feeling <br/>
really good and calm.  <br/>
Bob, my dh was hanging out with a bunch of women, late into the night <br/>
the first night there, providing accompaniment with his guitar to <br/>
their wonderful harmonies.  I missed that, but he had a blast.<br/>
He won the privledge (they pushed him into it) of being the grand <br/>
finale at the talent show, which he ended by singing the song <br/>
to &quot;Sponge Bob Square Pants&quot;.  It was great.  He started with &quot;Are <br/>
you ready kids?&quot; and they all yelled &quot;Aye Aye captain&quot; without him <br/>
even telling them what he was going to sing.<br/>
My little ones Jack and Jamie (6 and 4) had so much fun playing with <br/>
all the other little ones.  My older one Carly(13 soon) had a great <br/>
time doing all the cool funshops and meeting some really cool kids.<br/>
I brought pictures of my ds Sam and got to share him with a few <br/>
people.  I felt really sad that he didn&#39;t get to experience such a <br/>
great event.  He would have loved it.  I probably would have only <br/>
seen him fleetingly there.  I could just imagine him running by with <br/>
a group of kids, hanging out at the video games area, swimming and <br/>
having an all around blast and coming to me for quick needs here and <br/>
there.  <br/>
My dh was actually reading HEM on the way home!  I couldn&#39;t believe <br/>
it!<br/>
He was one of the dads there that were helping the newbie dads to get <br/>
over their fears and doubts.  He told me some of the things he said <br/>
and I was blown away!  He has never been in the position to have to <br/>
go really deep into describing what we do, and when he did, he came <br/>
to some realizations of his own.  Mostly that he really does trust <br/>
our kids and knows they are intelligent, fascinating people.  He <br/>
learned a lot listen to Ben talk about Rule vs. Principles.<br/>
Ben had a &quot;dad&#39;s meeting&quot; the first day there and that really set the <br/>
stage for some good male bonding.  They were sworn to secrecy and <br/>
were very tight lipped coming out of it.  Ben&#39;s a really smart guy.<br/>
He held the meeting in the hotel lounge and mentioned &quot;beer&quot; to <br/>
entice them down there.  It might have been coincidence that it was <br/>
happy hour too. ;-)<br/>
We&#39;re already looking forward to going to next years conference in <br/>
New England.<br/>
