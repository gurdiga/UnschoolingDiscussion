<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895950996">My mom went to Italy this summer to learn about Reggio schools. Since she <br/>
came back, she was on a Reggio schools email discussion list for teachers. <br/>
These were her last two posts on that list - I thought you all might enjoy <br/>
and appreciate them.<br/>

I agree that we must look at each child individually -- isn&#39;t that what <br/>
developmentally appropriate really is all about?  Not all children learn in <br/>
the same way or at the same age. This idea that our governor in Caifornia <br/>
has that &quot;all children will be reading by the second half of kindergarten&quot; <br/>
is ridiculous and dangerous. We already are way behind other states (for <br/>
many reasons) and it is all boiling down to politics. We teachers in this <br/>
state are going crazy with the &quot;accountability&quot; craze. Pushing children <br/>
into an area of learning before they are interested or ready for that <br/>
particular kind of thing may raise test scores temporarily but will do <br/>
lasting damage to the child and the education system in the long run. I am <br/>
a high school teacher of child development with a lab school on the campus <br/>
which I also direct. I also teach at the local community college and state <br/>
university part time in the early childhood education departments. I enjoy <br/>
hearing all the points of view - it keeps me sane. Jeanne<br/>

I honestly don&#39;t think &quot;they&quot; have a real definition in mind for &quot;reading&quot;; <br/>
at least I haven&#39;t been able to find a consistent feeling about it among <br/>
the several school districts around here. Most kindergarten teachers will <br/>
answer that they think it means knowing all the &quot;sounds of letters&quot; and <br/>
being able to use phonics to read simple books. Since I am in a high school <br/>
and see the poor results of many years of pure phonics I guess I am <br/>
prejudiced against using this method exclusively. The good readers are the <br/>
ones who learned at an early age to love books and were read to by members <br/>
of their families; not many of my students love to read for pleasure and <br/>
most really hate writing. I find his so sad. I think there is some hope on <br/>
the horizon however now that so many people in California are taking their <br/>
children out of school and homeschooling. These families are dedicated and <br/>
hardworking for the most part and their children consistently score above <br/>
the public school students in every area. I know many of these children and <br/>
families and find them very xcited about learning and doing lots of things <br/>
together in homeschooling groups. This may be a wake-up call to the state <br/>
ed department. We&#39;ll see.<br/>
