<div id="ygrps-yiv-336802645">Hello! I have been reading on this site for a couple months (off<br/>
and on, as we just returned from a long trip with limited internet<br/>
access). We have two sons, Gabriel (8 years) and Raphael (8 months).<br/>
We live in Minnesota, though we try to spend at least a month, if not<br/>
more, each year in Bolivia, where my husband is from.<br/>
<br/>
When Gabriel was younger, I always thought I would homeschool<br/>
(didn&#39;t know about unschooling at the time). But then I started<br/>
graduate school when he was four, became too preoccupied with what *I*<br/>
was doing, and slipped into the typical M.O.he went to a<br/>
Montessori preschool, and went through second grade at public school.<br/>
My husband and I have always had serious philosophical and practical<br/>
critiques of schools in general, though, and at the end of last school<br/>
year decided to keep Gabriel home this year. This was after having<br/>
struggled with his first grade teacher and school  administrators, who<br/>
freaked out when he did things like climb a door inside the building<br/>
(oh horror!) and struggling with his second grade teachers to try to<br/>
get them to lay off the boring, repetitive, and required homework. <br/>
<br/>
Reading John Holt was one of the things that clinched the decision to<br/>
homeschool, unschooling is a much better fit for our parenting style<br/>
(or at least, our parenting ideals, we&#39;re works in<br/>
progress). Still,<br/>
I&#39;ve only really been unschooling for a couple months because I<br/>
sabotoged the first few months of deschooling with occasional<br/>
(frequent?) parent panic attacks, afternoons of insisting he do<br/>
something &quot;educational&quot;, and getting frustrated and doing<br/>
things like<br/>
taking away his Play Station.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I have many shortcomings that sometimes make this<br/>
unschooling journey difficult. Right this minute, I&#39;m being<br/>
forced to admit oneimpatiencebecause as I&#39;m writing<br/>
this Gabriel<br/>
keeps walking in and telling me in great detail about past and future<br/>
K&#39;nex models. The first few times, I was guilty of the automatic<br/>
&quot;mm-hm&quot; response, I couldn&#39;t tell you what it was he was<br/>
trying to<br/>
explain to me. I realized that I was so wrapped up in what I was doing<br/>
that I resented the interruptionand its not like I&#39;m doing<br/>
something that can&#39;t wait a couple minutes while I hear about the<br/>
next<br/>
cool invention. Luckily, he is more patient than I am, and he gave me<br/>
several more chances to be interested in what he was doing (I am so<br/>
impressed by his inventiveness and understanding of   engineering,<br/>
balance, simple machines, design, as he creates K&#39;nex and<br/>
Bionicles!).<br/>
The other largish obstacles for me are balancing the needs of an<br/>
8-year-old and an infant, and trying to de-stress and de-school myself<br/>
while simultaneously finishing a PhD degree (a Sisyphean task if ever<br/>
there were oneI am leaning toward a clean break and a guilt-free<br/>
desertion of the university, but don&#39;t know if I am brave enough<br/>
to do<br/>
so). <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad to have found this forum/community! I&#39;m looking<br/>
forward to<br/>
future discussions!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to share this piece from Kahlil Gibran, as well, which I<br/>
first heard as a song from Sweet Honey in the Rock. While I don&#39;t<br/>
personally go for the divine archer bending me to his will, the<br/>
message of deep respect for children has always resonated with me.<br/>
<br/>
Your children are not your children. <br/>
They are the sons and daughters of Life&#39;s longing for itself. <br/>
They come through you but not from you, <br/>
And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you. <br/>
You may give them your love but not your thoughts. <br/>
For they have their own thoughts. <br/>
You may house their bodies but not their souls, <br/>
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot<br/>
visit, not even in your dreams. <br/>
You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. <br/>
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday. <br/>
You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent<br/>
forth. <br/>
The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends<br/>
you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far. <br/>
Let your bending in the archer&#39;s hand be for gladness; <br/>
For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow<br/>
that is stable. <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

 <br/>
The formula I&#39;ve always heard is it takes one month per year of school  <br/>
starting after the mom stops saying &quot;do some work&quot; (or whatever, fill your own  <br/>
panic-message in there &lt;g&gt;) for deschooling to settle out so that the  child will <br/>
be curious and open to things he might&#39;ve rejected or avoided  before.<br/>

 <br/>
That happens with everyone sometimes.  Husbands to wives and vice  versa, <br/>
kids not hearing parents...<br/>
 <br/>
Could you photograph some of his good K&#39;nex sculptures?  I regret not  having <br/>
photographed Kirby &quot;Turtle sculptures,&quot; when he had arranged his Ninja  <br/>
Turtle figured in elaborate scenarios.  Marty did Lego things I wish I&#39;d  <br/>
photographed.  We have a few photos of Holly&#39;s My Little Pony parties and  weddings.<br/>
