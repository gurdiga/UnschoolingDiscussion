<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230262825"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt;Do the rest of you guys feel a formal mealtime is important?&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I grew up with an iron rule about being at the table by 6 pm and eating<br/>
whatever was on my plate with a smile or my chair got taken away - yuck!<br/>
<br/>
I do still like the idea of a shared meal.  When my husband and I got<br/>
together I always nagged him to slow down and eat with me.  He thought I was<br/>
nuts.  Now that we have kids he really wants us all to eat together and goes<br/>
great lengths to accomplish that even on nights when I teach or have to<br/>
leave.  He grew up eating in front of the TV.<br/>
<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t always interested in sitting as long as it takes for us to<br/>
eat, they need to get down and wander around, and then come back for more.<br/>
I&#39;m ok with this but dh goes freakin&#39; ballistic every time.  *sigh*  I&#39;ve<br/>
created a monster ;)<br/>
<br/>
I have only recently found patience with my children, where I had none<br/>
before.  I think it&#39;s just his turn to vent since he had to be the patient<br/>
one while I went nuts for awhile.  I am just trying to not get upset with<br/>
him and flame the fires.  Instead I guess I have just been trying to kind of<br/>
narrate when the kids are doing something that I know will bother him.  &#39;Oh,<br/>
do you need a break for a minute?  Well, you can come back for more if you<br/>
want to&#39;  that kind of stuff.  Seems like if I speak up before he starts<br/>
huffing and puffing, he can deal with it better.<br/>
<br/>
He is so concerned about Harriet starting to read soon because he and his<br/>
sister both read at about 4.  This list has been an amazing help for me<br/>
because I can just throw out little tidbits whenever he says &#39;we really have<br/>
to get you reading FOR REAL&#39;.  This morning he said something like that<br/>
Because the kids were sitting together in our recliner and Harriet was<br/>
reading to Crispin.  She knows the story by heart and was saying the<br/>
appropriate phrases with the right pictures.  To me, that is reading,<br/>
especially for a 4 year old.  I just said, &#39;well I&#39;ve read several times<br/>
that fine motor skills are really the first step in reading, maybe you guys<br/>
can do a project&#39;  <br/>
I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s ideal, but he is so curriculum focused.  I am trying to<br/>
ease him into some more unschooling ideas without shoving it down his<br/>
throat.  That won&#39;t work with him.<br/>
Although he would never used anyone else&#39;s published curriculum, I can see<br/>
him going to great lengths to put together a very detailed plan of his own.<br/>
I really want to do more natural learning.  I have a ways to go myself<br/>
before I can truly foster natural learning in my kids.  Thanks for the help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-194256328">When I was a kid, we always had formal mealtime.  Everyone sat down together and ate dinner and talked.  It was a very pleasant time (up until I was a teenager and even now a grown woman).  As I got older and my relationship with my mother deteriorated, mealtime got to be a stressful time.  My food couldn&#39;t digest.<br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;ve had kids, we haven&#39;t had a formal mealtime.  Not because I don&#39;t want to...but because of lack of ability.  We do all eat at the same time, but there is no place for all 5 of us to sit down and eat together.  It&#39;s always been a combination of financial reasons and lack of space to put a table big enough to sit us all.  <br/>
<br/>
The kids have a &quot;kid&#39;s&quot; table that doubles as an art space.  (I spraypainted it a few years ago with slate so they could do chalk on it on rainy days).  DH and I usually sit on the couch or on the floor and eat.  <br/>
<br/>
I have hopes and dreams of one day being able to sit down as a family and eat, but while we can&#39;t, we still try to interact during that time frame.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365020680">I grew up in a family of bookworms so while we did eat at the table,<br/>
often even all together, we usually all brought our books to the<br/>
table and all ate while reading ;)<br/>
<br/>
I still love to do that, but I realize that a lot of people find it<br/>
rude. My husband has talked about eating as a family but in truth he<br/>
prefers to eat in front of the TV. Nothing wrong with that! The only<br/>
person who wants to eat as a family (and often tells both him and me<br/>
to &#39;sit&#39; at the table) is our 2 yr old daughter! But big part of her<br/>
wanting us at the table is that there are still a lot of foods she<br/>
eats messily and is therefore told she can only have them at the<br/>
table. As she learns to keep her soup off the couch, things will<br/>
change!<br/>
