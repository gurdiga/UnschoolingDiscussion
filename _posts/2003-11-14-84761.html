<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769839688">Just out of curiousity, I did a little research.. Here are the <br/>
results for the growth of this group over the past year<br/>
<br/>
New Ownership took place on Aug 31, so the first set of number is <br/>
indicative of growth since new ownership.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sept, Oct, Nov 03 - 155 new members (as of today)<br/>
June, July Aug 03 - 149 new members<br/>
March, April, May 03 - 289<br/>
Dec, Jan, Feb 02-03 - 222 new members<br/>
Sept, Oct, Nov, 02 -  182 new members.<br/>
<br/>
I can not find out how many members unsubscribed in those months, <br/>
those figures are for mods and owners only.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-757562196">On the new members counts, that includes resubscribes.  Pretty frequently <br/>
people change e-mail accounts so it looks like someone left and a new person <br/>
joined but it was just a switch of address.  Same, basically, if someone goes off <br/>
the list while on vacation or moving, and then re-ups.<br/>
<br/>
I think this list has been over 1200 for a year or two, and hasn&#39;t ever hit <br/>
1300.<br/>
