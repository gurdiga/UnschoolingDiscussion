<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122584541">I am very excited tonight. Lately 5yob has been very<br/>
interested in learning to read so I have been<br/>
providing plenty of oppertunities for him to learn in<br/>
that area. But while he has been spending so much time<br/>
on reading I have been thinking in the back of my mind<br/>
that he needs to learn his numbers better. I hadn&#39;t<br/>
done anything with numbers because I wasn&#39;t sure how<br/>
to make it fun and interesting for him. Well, tonight<br/>
at dinner we started talking about shapes and looking<br/>
around the room for different shapes. Then he started<br/>
to count the rectangualar cabinet doors which lead to<br/>
him adding and subtracting them by opening and closing<br/>
them. Silly me. And I thought he needed to learn more<br/>
about his numbers and he has already figured out some<br/>
simple math without me.<br/>
