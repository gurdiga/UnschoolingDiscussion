<div id="ygrps-yiv-797204312">This year I broke with tradition and gave my daughter her dream party  <br/>
for her eighth birthday.  She&#39;d wished for a swimming party (in  <br/>
November in the midwest) and a surprise party!  I made arrangements  <br/>
to rent a poolside hotel room and planned her surprise party!  It was  <br/>
amazing to see the look on her face when she walked into the hotel  <br/>
pool with her daddy (thinking that he was meeting a client there to  <br/>
drop off some job) and 12 of her closest friends jumped out and  <br/>
shouted &quot;SURPRISE!&quot;  She was stunned!  The kids swam and swam and  <br/>
swam and ate pizza and cake and swam some more.  The hotel cut me a  <br/>
deal, $20 off the regular room cost because it was a Sunday night.   <br/>
We held the party around the pool, we had it to ourselves and I  <br/>
didn&#39;t have to clean my house! In all, I calculated that my cost  <br/>
wasn&#39;t any more than if I&#39;d held the party at home because I would&#39;ve  <br/>
had the expenses of  games and prizes and decorations and I would&#39;ve  <br/>
felt compelled to send the kids home with fancier goody bags.  But,  <br/>
since I was providing the kids with lots of free swimming time in  <br/>
November, I figured a beach ball and a little bit of candy was fair  <br/>
enough!  Zoe loved her party and swimming with all her friends and I  <br/>
heard good reviews from the kids and parents who attended!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the whole consumerism idea<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I still think this anti-stuff attitude is some sort of puritanical  <br/>
thing. I think it is magical thinking that comes from fear - exactly  <br/>
like anti-tv or anti-videogame thinking.<br/>
<br/>
What the heck is wrong with enjoying STUFF?<br/>
<br/>
What are parents so afraid of that they act unnecessarily stingy with  <br/>
their kids?<br/>
<br/>
I am an economist and I know a lot about the roots of the anti- <br/>
consumerism movement - starting with Karl Marx and Thorstein Veblen,  <br/>
etc. I understand all the arguments. I understand conspicuous  <br/>
consumption, for example. I understand how people come to associate  <br/>
their status in life with what products they buy, what label clothing  <br/>
they wear, etc. I GET all that. I understand how people in the United  <br/>
States consume more than our fair share of the world&#39;s resources. I  <br/>
know all about this whole thing. I&#39;ve participated in studies of  <br/>
&quot;simplicity/simple living.&quot; I&#39;m all in favor of less stuff in order  <br/>
to simplify our lives and have more time for walks in the woods, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But what I don&#39;t see is that parents being GENEROUS with their  <br/>
children is what leads to the negative side of consumerism. It is the  <br/>
opposite, it is parents who focus on &quot;things&quot; and care about their  <br/>
social status based on &quot;things&quot; and who treat their children like  <br/>
&quot;products&quot; who end up caught in the negatives of consumerism. For  <br/>
these people, they never really totally ENJOY the stuff they&#39;re  <br/>
buying, they buy and buy in order just to HAVE stuff to show off.<br/>
<br/>
But when a kid wants a wonderful exciting happy birthday party with a  <br/>
bounce house - that kid is NOT status-seeking or engaging in  <br/>
conspicuous consumption or excessive consumerism - he/she is simply  <br/>
LOVING LIFE!<br/>
<br/>
I think parents are so afraid of messing up their kids that they hope  <br/>
that by withholding things (not allowing tv or videogames, not  <br/>
letting kids have things they want) that they&#39;ll sort of earn some  <br/>
kind of safety or security.<br/>
<br/>
Harry Potter&#39;s awful cousin, Dudley, counts his gifts and throws a  <br/>
tantrum because he thinks he&#39;s been shorted one. If your kid is doing  <br/>
THAT, then maybe you have something to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
I think parents are afraid that kids will get to be like Dudley if  <br/>
they give the kids too much stuff. But that&#39;s really not the case at  <br/>
all - it is that parents SUBSTITUTE the stuff for real relationships  <br/>
- it is because parents, themselves, act like a person&#39;s value is  <br/>
based on the labels they wear and what kind of car they drive and so on.<br/>
<br/>
If we want our kids to BE generous people, we ought to be generous  <br/>
with them.<br/>
<br/>
We can be thoughtful consumers and still be generous - those are not  <br/>
necessarily contradictory.<br/>

Rowling&#39;s characterizations of Harry and Dudley certainly do convey  <br/>
that message.<br/>
Ron Weasley is quite excited to get ANYthing, because of his  <br/>
deprivation.  So Ron &quot;appreciates&quot; what he has.<br/>

hotel guest could bring into the pool.  They told me that the only  <br/>
policy they had was that there could be no more than eight people in  <br/>
our hotel room at a time.  That was no problem because our room was  <br/>
pool-side and guests used it solely for changing clothes (and one mom  <br/>
and young child recovered from a scary swimming incident in privacy  <br/>
in there).  The hotel happily allowed food and our large group  <br/>
gathering around their pool.  Guests could enter the pool area  <br/>
directly off the lobby of the hotel without a room key.  IT was ideal!<br/>
<br/>
They didn&#39;t charge anything beyond the room charge ($79 for a double  <br/>
plus yummy complimentary continental breakfast in the a.m.)  If other  <br/>
guests had wanted to swim we would not have had the pool all to  <br/>
ourselves but the hotel was relatively empty on a Sunday night.  Our  <br/>
party was fun but not crazy or extremely loud so other guests  <br/>
could&#39;ve enjoyed the pool if they&#39;d wanted.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365047192">Pam, your post helped solidify an almost-idea that was rattling <br/>
around in my mind:<br/>
<br/>
Vilifying &quot;things&quot; (or TV, or video games, or even school) is really <br/>
very close to glorifying them. It isn&#39;t a straight continuum with <br/>
vilification at one &quot;end&quot;, glorification at the other, and balance <br/>
somewhere in between--it&#39;s more like a horseshoe, with the two ends <br/>
bent nearly touching.<br/>
<br/>
So I agree that it is &quot;parents who focus on &quot;things&quot; and care about <br/>
their social status based on &quot;things&quot; and who treat their children <br/>
like &quot;products&quot; who end up caught in the negatives of consumerism&quot;, <br/>
BUT I would argue that that group includes parents who focus on the <br/>
EVILS of &quot;things&quot;--who care about their social status based on NOT <br/>
having &quot;things&quot; and who treat their children like &quot;products&quot; in that <br/>
a child who likes blinky plastic toys is virtually a failure for the <br/>
parent--who are caught up in the negatives of consumerism.<br/>
<br/>
Also, on the Harry Potter parallels, I don&#39;t think Ron&#39;s attitude <br/>
toward things is as simple as &quot;poor people appreciate things&quot;. True, <br/>
he seems generally pleased with his Christmas and birthday gifts, <br/>
but that doesn&#39;t stop him from being horrified by his Weasley <br/>
sweater (due to the color, not its being handmade) or his godawful <br/>
dress robes.<br/>
<br/>

I read the post about renting one of those &quot;bouncy things&quot;...out loud to my 6 <br/>
and 8 year old sons......Why I&#39;m not sure...I guess I don&#39;t like the feelings I <br/>
get when spending so much money on our bday parties but i also see the joy in <br/>
their eyes too.....but the whole consumerism idea eats at me...anyway, in <br/>
immediate response to my read aloud ...my 6 y/o son said &quot; Hey mom, one day can <br/>
we rent one of those things for just a regular day and not just on our birthdays <br/>
b/c they&#39;re SO fun?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been accused of spending too much money on birthday parties. I&#39;m...well....extravagant...when it comes<br/>
to celebrating the birth of my boys. But that&#39;s my excuse! I AM THRILLED they were born, and they each <br/>
*ONLY* turn four ONCE, ONLY turn nine ONCE, only turn 13 ONCE. *I* only turn 45 ONCE! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
We celebrate birthdays here. BIG. We make a big deal of celebrating that we get to have them in our lives. <br/>
It IS a big deal!<br/>
 <br/>
Each boy is different though---Cameron loved big parties with lots of kids and themes. Duncan prefers a <br/>
bigger family-only celebration---like a trip to Busch Gardens or Disney World (he LOVES theme parks!).<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not hard (for me, anyway) to justify expense for birthdays. I&#39;m just so glad they were born---and I <br/>
tell them that too! &lt;g&gt; But I&#39;m also glad they&#39;re still around. I would miss them so much if they weren&#39;t <br/>
here. We have several friends who&#39;ve lost children tragically. That just makes me want to celebrate my <br/>
time with them even more.<br/>
 <br/>
Bouncy houses, face paints, balloons, costumes, trips---whatever! It&#39;s ONLY once a year, and it&#39;s ONLY <br/>
for the first years of their lives! It should be something they remember! I&#39;m just delighted they were <br/>
born!<br/>
 <br/>
~Kelly, party girl----who will also rent a bouncy house just because it&#39;s Tuesday! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
