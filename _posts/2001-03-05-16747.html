Flaxton was not flooded.  Much to my dd relief.  water in great <br/>
quantities scares her to death....<br/>
My neice and her 2 babies had to be evacuated. She lives near the <br/>
river, close to selby. Her dh stayed in the house, and luckily it <br/>
never actually did get flooded.<br/>
<br/>
Talking about wells and water. I can remember as a child, a farm near <br/>
to where I used to live, having one of those old fasioned water pumps <br/>
with the iron handle that you had to pull up and down to get the <br/>
water out.  They did have running water at this time - but the old <br/>
pump still worked.<br/>
