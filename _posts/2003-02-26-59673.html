<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499010763">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Manon and I have a 2 1/2 year old ds.  He is spirited and lately he seems to love to do anything he is not supposed to be doing.  He will go in the room and close the door telling me not to come in and either pee on the floor or eat paper or write on the walls.  We don&#39;t have a lot of rules (just what I consider essential).  I know the problem might be in my reactions as I will sometimes yell or overreact when I just can&#39;t take it anymore.  I usually try to remain calm and explain to him why I don&#39;t like him doing that.  For example, when he pees all over the house I say Oh let me help you clean that up and I explain that if he doesn&#39;t want to wear a diaper he should go in the potty.  Sometimes it almost seems as if he wants me to go in the room and take the paper or whatever out of his hands while he has a good cry in my arms.  It&#39;s like he&#39;s begging me to take control.  What would you guys do?<br/>
