<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305086618">Hello everybody,<br/>
<br/>
do you remember my July posting citing some of the questions I received <br/>
as a feedback to my German language homeschooling website? Thanks a lot <br/>
to all those who contributed to finding answers and to everybody else <br/>
for taking the time to listen!!!<br/>
<br/>
I wrote a little article as a quintessence of many answers I got (in <br/>
German). My friend Brenda Leonard (whom many will know from her <br/>
contributions to this list) asked me to translate it into English, so <br/>
here you go for anybody who might bother to read it: <br/>
www.unschooling.de/stefanie.mohsennia/polynom_en.html<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t received too much feedback to the articles I translate and <br/>
provide in German language on my website. Unfortunately, it looks like <br/>
the German answer to our bad performance in the PISA study (OECD <br/>
Programme for International Student Assessment) which everybody is very <br/>
concerned about over here, might be a compulsory last year of preschool <br/>
(for all 5-year-olds) and longer school hours - HOORAY! We all know this <br/>
is the wrong direction!<br/>
<br/>
You are all so lucky to have the freedom to unschool!!!<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
Steffi<br/>
from Germany (the only country in Europe where homeschooling is just <br/>
plain illegal)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123030257">Hi, Stefanie.<br/>
<br/>
Your timing on this is perfect. We have had three German-speaking people<br/>
staying with us for the past week, and my explanation of unschooling was<br/>
probably not as clear as it could have been. They&#39;re leaving this morning,<br/>
but I&#39;ll e-mail the link to them so they can read it later.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Lillian<br/>
