Okay.  thanks!  All I&#39;d heard was the management of the conference changed.  <br/>
I think they&#39;re waiting for it to settle before getting back with me.  Maybe <br/>
their meetings are so taken up with the politics that they haven&#39;t gotten <br/>
back to the conference planning.  But it&#39;s SOON, and I don&#39;t want the ticket <br/>
price to get so high they can&#39;t afford to get me up there any more.<br/>
