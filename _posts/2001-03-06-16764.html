<div id="ygrps-yiv-895866444">Hi...  whoever it was posting about selling curriculum, I just came<br/>
across something you might be interested in.  I get the About.com email<br/>
newsletter.  It is great by the way... and... at this site, toward the<br/>
bottom of the page, there is a link to selling/buying curriculum<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homeschooling.about.com/education/homeschooling/">http://homeschooling.about.com/education/homeschooling/</a><br/>
Hope it helps...<br/>
