<div id="ygrps-yiv-83899448">Hope this is OK to post:<br/>
<br/>
My brother (OK, he&#39;s an elementary school teacher) is a TOTAL horror nut + a writer (INFP/ISTP).  Funny thing is he&#39;s TOTALLY self-taught, but cannot see that his sons would be better off self-teaching their own passions.  His eldest is bullied mercilessly because he&#39;s an NF too.  Soft male in school - not good!  :O(<br/>
<br/>
 Anyway, he hosts &quot;Flashshot: the Daily Horror Flash Fiction&quot; and since there are so many NF&#39;s maybe you want to play too!  Write &#39;em or read &#39;em.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the gig:  Scare someone, give them a chill, in 100 words or less.  He posts them on an email list.  (Yes, he promo&#39;s his e-books that way, just so you know.  The writer gets to plug their own ventures/bio too.)  I read it each morning while typing missives to you folks.  Some are good.  Some stink IMHO.  He stopped guessing what is good/bad because like all art, 50% love/hate it.  I&#39;ve even sent in three flashes of my own.<br/>
<br/>
He was recommended for nomination for a Stoker award for the service to horror fans (Stoker is like an Oscar in horror). <br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you want the email address to sub to.<br/>
