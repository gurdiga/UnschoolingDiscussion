<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335717034">Hi!<br/>
I have been reading your list with great interest. I<br/>
am currently homeschooling my bipolar 14 year old<br/>
daughter. She was diagnosed as bipolar a day before<br/>
she started high school, and was pretty much crucified<br/>
by the 6 weeks or so that she attended high school,<br/>
before we pulled her out. She was a basket case when<br/>
we started to homeschool her and I decided to let the<br/>
poor kid &quot;deschool&quot;. My plan was to eventually go to a<br/>
school at home approach but I didn&#39;t have the heart to<br/>
do that until she recovered.<br/>
Deschooling has been pretty cool. She has read up on<br/>
such subjects as true crime, Andy Warhol, Marilyn<br/>
Monroe [ a curvy, blond, blue eyed, left handed,<br/>
bipolar female, much like my daughter]. We both<br/>
enjoyed reading &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; together and<br/>
loved it. I occasionally assign her something vaguely<br/>
academic and it goes over like a lead ballon. I am<br/>
convinced she learns best what she chooses to learn..<br/>
Our family setting is not great for unschooling. My 2<br/>
older kids and my husband see AnnaClaire as spoilt<br/>
rotten. We have not done much with the local<br/>
homeschoolers who tend to have younger kids and are<br/>
quite religious. I guess I&#39;m not sure to where to go<br/>
from here with her homeschooling.<br/>
Has anyone else been in my sitaution? A mentally ill<br/>
teen and a hostil family? Any thoughts would be<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
Charisse     <br/>

<br/>
If so - unschooling/homeschooling groups do tend to be pretty tolerant <br/>
of kids with &quot;quirks&quot; - IF you can find such a group.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise - I&#39;d think your best bet would be to explore her own <br/>
interests and make contacts based on those interests, rather than <br/>
trying to find homeschoolers, specifically.<br/>

Can you do some extra-nice things for them occasionally, even if they don&#39;t live at home any more?  Give them a little more &quot;spoiling&quot;, so they aren&#39;t so jealous of what she gets?  (I&#39;m vague about the older kids ages. Are they adults now, or still in school?)<br/>
<br/>
And can you apologize for sending them to high school?  (Seriously).  Tell them you think that school is an unpleasant waste of time and that you are sorry they had to go through it?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS  Some kids who are miserable in high school kill themselves.  My husband and I both thought about it around age 15.  Some of the hormones at that age can be terrifically hard to cope with.  Suicide-prevention is just ONE good reason to homeschool, and one I would think your husband might support.  We can offer a hundred other reasons, I bet.</div>

One of my friends did in Jr. High (9th grade, high school age in some places) <br/>
and one in 10th (high school).<br/>

<br/>
Maybe get some brochures for resident treatment places (WITH the rates) and <br/>
ask the all if they think that would be better.  Going to school and being a <br/>
model cheerleader doesn&#39;t seem to be the alternative.  So your alternative is <br/>
fantastic, and it&#39;s not about them.   <br/>
<br/>
I concur on the apology being a possible idea.  Run through a little fantasy <br/>
scenario of how cool it would&#39;ve been if you&#39;d all homeschooled ten years ago, <br/>
and smile real big.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045755380">Thanks, Robyn. I was actually a member of this group<br/>
for a while, but had to &quot;Unsub&quot; because I just didn&#39;t<br/>
have time to keep up with the number of e-mails that<br/>
that group generated. They are a very active group!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966196082">I&#39;m afraid that apologizing to my older kids would not<br/>
be of much use. I have a 20 year old son who remembers<br/>
his high school days fondly. He attended a local fine<br/>
arts charter school and did spendidly. He got good<br/>
grades and was known as a very talented writer. Now,<br/>
as a college sophmore at a Big Ten campus he is<br/>
struggling to find his niche.<br/>
My 17 year old daughter simply shines at high school.<br/>
She gets good grades, has tons of friends, does<br/>
sports, band, gets awards on a regular basis, the<br/>
whole nine yards. On the whole, she is a good sister<br/>
to AnnaClaire. It is a sore point for her that she has<br/>
to work so hard [i.e. staying up late nights in order<br/>
to &quot;cram&quot;], while her sister doesn&#39;t.<br/>
The biggest problem is my husband. As the son of a<br/>
former school teacher and college professor, he has<br/>
some heavy duty philosophical problems with this whole<br/>
Unschooling concept. He agrees with homeschooling, but<br/>
would be a whole lot happier if she spent her time<br/>
writing papers, learning Latin,etc He is also<br/>
struggling with some health issues [diabetes,<br/>
depression, high blood pressure] and not always a<br/>
patient man. The truth is that the my beloved husband<br/>
and youngest child get on each other&#39;s nerves. He gets<br/>
to spend less time alone with me because she is always<br/>
around which is a sore spot. He is concerned that she<br/>
&quot;always gets her own way&quot;. His older brother had some<br/>
serious problems with mental illness and kind of ran<br/>
the family because everyone tiptoed around the guy. My<br/>
older sister had some very heavy duty mental health<br/>
problems and died as the result of suicide-her illness<br/>
may have contributed to my folks breaking up.He<br/>
doesn&#39;t want AnnaClaire to come betwen the two us. I&#39;m<br/>
sorry to be so long winded-it&#39;s just that families are<br/>
complicated and both mental illness and homeschooling<br/>
force people to think long and hard about priorites.<br/>
I think maybe I&#39;d better get back to lurking...<br/>
Thanks again for your thoughts!<br/>
