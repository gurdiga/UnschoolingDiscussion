<div><font size="2">so, what&#39;s everyone reading?&nbsp; I&#39;ve picked up a really 
eclectic mix from the library, an HTML guide, a gardening book, &#39;The Te of 
Piglet&#39; (they didn&#39;t have the Tao of Pooh) &#39;The Birth of a Mother&#39; and 3 fantasy 
novels, 2 Anne McCaffrey &#39;Pern&#39; books and one David Gemmell, the first I&#39;ve read 
of his.&nbsp; Needless to say, the only ones I&#39;ve finished yet are the Anne 
McCaffrey&#39;s; they&#39;re light-relief against a project I&#39;ve taken on that I don&#39;t 
know how to do.&nbsp; (which is a point, if anyone&#39;s overly familiar with Lotus 
Approach, I&#39;d be extremely glad to hear from them &lt;g&gt;)</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">The only problem now is finding time to read them all before 
they have to go back!</font></div>
