<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378691716">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
2 things:<br/>
<br/>
One, I have heard Florida mentioned a few times for unschooling.  <br/>
Where or what for that matter?  I am in South Florida.  I know there <br/>
is a conference this month for the Florida Association of parent <br/>
educators (I think thats their title??).  I am not sure how unschooly <br/>
or not they are?<br/>
<br/>
Second, if you do a conference in the NE, I vote for CT the first <br/>
week of September--labor day weekend!  I have a wedding there and we <br/>
are spending a forture, would love to make something out of it!!  <br/>
Okay so I know it is a bit close in timing to the SC conference, but <br/>
hey a girl can wish.  I do have to check my calender and see if we <br/>
can swing that one. WE are planning to drive but have not set dates <br/>
yet so I will see if that one is a possibility.  Also, do we have to <br/>
register early?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any input<br/>
<br/>
Olga :)</div>

my breath! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No. You *could* register at the door. But early registration allows me to <br/>
plan better (and not sweat the money!), so we offer &quot;Early Bird&quot; registration <br/>
which saves you BIG bucks! Early Bird reg ends June 1st, so it&#39;s best to go <br/>
ahead and make plans as soon as possible in order to save $$.<br/>

<br/>
FPEA is having a convention on May 22 weekend. From what I know FPEA isn&#39;t<br/>
real unschooling friendly and also the convention isn&#39;t very kid friendly<br/>
either. They tell you right on the website to make arrangements for your<br/>
kids ahead of time. It&#39;s in Kissimmee.<br/>
