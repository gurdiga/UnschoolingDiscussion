<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028010995">I have to say that having a digital camera is one of the best things for<br/>
unschooling that we&#39;ve done, for many reasons. We can take enormous amounts<br/>
of photos of Lego constructions, Lego guys in various poses doing various<br/>
things (my favorite was the day my son&#39;s Lego people went &quot;mountain<br/>
climbing&quot; - he made a mountain out of pillows and a blanket over the top,<br/>
then had posed them in various mountaineering ways on the sides), and other<br/>
things that are transitory We&#39;ve done things like taken a picture of a<br/>
scraped knee, then taken a picture each day afterwards as it scabbed over<br/>
and healed - gave the kids a time-lapse view of how their bodies worked. I<br/>
take pictures of artwork when it gets too voluminous to keep every bit, or<br/>
of art projects that are too cumbersome to keep around but that the kids<br/>
want to remember.<br/>
But I also think it would be great if you lived in a state that required<br/>
documentation, because you can photograph everything and there&#39;s no film or<br/>
developing costs. You could have pictures of your kids at museums, parks,<br/>
field trips, their writing, projects, camping trips, crafts, baking, and<br/>
artwork. If I took photos of all the stuff my kids do in the course of a<br/>
day, I can imagine it would look pretty impressive all totaled into a<br/>
collection if need be.<br/>
I love photography in general and have been the unoffical photographer of<br/>
our homeschooling group. Last year when we had our group&#39;s Honoring<br/>
Ceremony, I put together a slide show on the computer of the whole year and<br/>
various stuff we&#39;d done, and set it to music. As we watched it, the parents<br/>
were all saying &quot;Wow, I forgot we did that&quot;, and &quot;We did so many things last<br/>
year, I didn&#39;t remember.&quot; When you view it like that at the end of a period<br/>
of time, it *is* impressive just the endless cool things that an unschooling<br/>
lifestyle can lead you to. So for those who have to document, I&#39;d say that a<br/>
digital camera can be priceless. We figured that we saved the cost of our<br/>
camera in film developing alone in less than 6 months. And no more storing<br/>
huge amounts of photos and negatives. I just burn them all to CDs and<br/>
they&#39;re stored.<br/>

I completely agree. We got a digital camera for work, but I use it <br/>
for personal things all the time.  I can take as many shots as I want <br/>
until I get it right and no expensive film developing (or bad film <br/>
developing). Now, I take pictures of alot of the things we do that we <br/>
cannot keep because there is no written work or drawing to go with it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648638142">Don&#39;t forget letting the kids take pictures! I love my digital camera because I don&#39;t feel<br/>
antsy about letting my 6  yo (or 3 yo) take picture after picture after picture. Jason (my <br/>
6 yo) has got a great eye and sets up wonderful shots. And he absolutely loves it.<br/>
<br/>
You can check out his pics at our website (Look for the album labeled Pictures by Jason)<br/>
