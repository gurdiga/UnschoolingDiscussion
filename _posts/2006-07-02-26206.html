<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744199435">I forwarded his speech to my DH and titled the email, &quot;the best <br/>
graduation speech ever.&quot; It had what seemed to be some (gasp!) original <br/>
thought, passion, and insight, and it took GUTS to get up there and <br/>
deliver it. SOMEONE has to speak these truths. Maybe it will snap some <br/>
of his peers out of the &quot;sheeple&quot; ways of living.<br/>
