Kelly, what are your raffle rules?  <br/>
Holly just put a homeschooling t-shirt in the charity box for tomorrows <br/>
pick-up but I pulled it back out and said &quot;No!  A homeschooler needs this!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do you have an aversion to used clothes of that special nature?<br/>
<br/>
I also came across a denim jumper that I wore quite a bit years ago before it <br/>
became the Mark of Virtue for conservative homeschoolers.  I could write up <br/>
and sign a certificate of authenticity.  I remember some people (the non-U.S. <br/>
readers mostly) who didn&#39;t know what an exotic &quot;denim jumper&quot; might be!<br/>
<br/>
I also have the set of four Schoolhouse Rock videos.  We got it on DVD.  So <br/>
those would be used too...  Yes?  (If no, that&#39;s okay.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds humorous! If not, practical! &lt;G&gt; And there *are* some non-US residents <br/>
coming!<br/>

We have a neat array already! Pam Genant just sent me two HUGE boxes of toys <br/>
and Yu-Gi-Oh! cards and a copy of Harry Potter 5 and, and, and ---all SORTS of <br/>
stuff!  Duncan&#39;s already saving his money up for the conference---he wants <br/>
SOOO many things (and it must be *so* hard to have them in his own dining room <br/>
and not able to touch! :-( <br/>
<br/>
THANKS, PAM!!! I promise a personal thank you for this when I see you <br/>
online---I must&#39;ve *just* missed you while I was in the shower!<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a market for all sorts of used things----especially books and <br/>
games.<br/>
<br/>
The more, the merrier! Bring &#39;em on! And Thanks!<br/>
