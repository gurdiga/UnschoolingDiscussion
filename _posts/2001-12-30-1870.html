 </span></blockquote>What beautiful sweetie-pies, Joylyn!  Thanks for putting those pictures up!<br/>
<br/>
I thought I would add pictures of us, too, so I added a picture of my son <br/>
Liam, and that went well.  Then, I tried to add pix of dh and me, but I <br/>
haven&#39;t been able to due to one of those computer glitches that prevents <br/>
you from doing things you ought to be able to do.  But, I&#39;m glad I got <br/>
Liam&#39;s picture up!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, Joylyn; your daughters are just beautiful.<br/>

WOW!  I saw a picture when it was new!  (more often than not, I finally see <br/>
something a few weeks or months later, because I forget to go and look)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111778321">Nice pictures Joylyn. Great action shots of them both. Chloe said <br/>
she wishes her team could have those hot pink shirts like Janene. <br/>
She didn&#39;t like soccer too much (too much running she said) even <br/>
though she was really good and scored goals. She likes gymnastics <br/>
and ballet.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and now Chloe wants some hot pink braids now after seeing the <br/>
girls with the blue and purple braids. Thank you very much ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830552076">I&#39;d be glad to put pink braids into Chloe&#39;s hair.  HOwever, she must be <br/>
still for a LONG time.  Like 4-5 hours.   If she&#39;s willing to do that, <br/>
I&#39;m willing to try. <br/>
<br/>
btw, that would be using big braids.  Lexie&#39;s hair took longer, like two <br/>
days, 6 or so hours each day.<br/>
