&lt;&lt; If this is too personal, I understand. I was wondering how the first born <br/>
is <br/>
 doing now? Do you see any major differences because of how that child was <br/>
 raised as far as the spankings and restrictions and all? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know you weren&#39;t asking me Mary, but I just had to chime in.<br/>
My oldest that had all the punishments, spankings etc... is a lot more angry <br/>
than he otherwise would have been, I am quite sure.<br/>
He deals with the same anger issues I do, see how it gets passed on?<br/>
The rest of my children, though they suffered a little of my idiocy (but not <br/>
nearly the same crap) are more calm and gentle. Even my spit fire girl, who <br/>
is very independant and strong willed, is not the angry person that he is.<br/>
I really believe it&#39;s my fault. <br/>
But we are working on it, and I see him learning new tools for dealing with <br/>
it all the time. I&#39;m glad I figured this out before he was raised.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-759905359">For us, it really depends on the situation. Whining is our biggest problem. I simply say that I can&#39;t understand when someone talks and whines at the same time, and sometimes do a little whine-talk of my own to make them laugh. That usually ends it. If not, I tell them I&#39;m going to go do something (use the potty, put folded laundry away, get a drink) and that I&#39;ll be right back and we&#39;ll talk about it then. By the time a few minutes have past, the whines will be gone for sure. <br/>
<br/>
For general snippyness, I&#39;ll ask that they use a nice tone of voice and say whatever again. They do the same to me! &lt;g&gt; Keeps us all straight.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never had a problem with swearing, because I don&#39;t, and DH doesn&#39;t when the kids are around. They&#39;ll repeat swear words that are in songs (a favorite now is &quot;we&#39;ll put a boot in your ass, it&#39;s the american way&quot;) but I&#39;ve warned them that doing that around grandparents or most other adults may offend them. <br/>

some cases if he doesn&#39;t listen the FIRST time...it could lead to harm. <br/>

 ***Reb Bradley has a book out called, <br/>

For those of you torn between your Christian worldview and not wanting to harm your children, there *are* Christian authors who are against spanking.  William Sears, for one, has an excellent chapter in his Discipline Book... 10 reasons not to spank or something like that.  <br/>
 <br/>
***I just believe that he...and <br/>
our 1 1/2 yr. old and 3 mth. old...need to be raised to know we are in <br/>

I was taught they were, in church.  That you should fear God, with trembling.<br/>
That God was a JUST God which is why he could never EVER  make even one <br/>

Yeah that&#39;s exactly how it came out with my daughter, anger and lots of it. <br/>
I guess I&#39;m curious to ask thinking maybe someone can tell me it didn&#39;t hurt <br/>
their child that was spanked that much. That way I can take some of the <br/>
blame off of me and the guilt I deal with even yet. If someone&#39;s kid turned <br/>
out great after having all the discipline that I provided too, then maybe it <br/>
wasn&#39;t all my fault and some of it was my daughter&#39;s personality or her <br/>
brain not doing what it should have been doing. See, my daughter self <br/>
injured for years and although she&#39;s okay now, it really tore me apart. To <br/>
know that your child hurts herself to take away the pain she&#39;s feeling. <br/>
Pretty crappy.<br/>

Well I talk and talk and talk some more. I&#39;m so much more patient now then <br/>
when I was younger. (or is it that I&#39;m just slower?!) I don&#39;t even send <br/>
anyone to their rooms or anything. I&#39;ll usually suggest a calming down <br/>
period if I see things are heating up. It&#39;s usually between my 6 and 7 year <br/>
olds. When I suggest that we all take a minute to breath and calm down, one <br/>
of them will actually get up and leae and go somewher else. Luckily we have <br/>
plenty of other places for one to go around here. The one that stays is <br/>
usually the one I can talk to first about what happened and how did they <br/>
feel and how do you think the other one felt and what could we do different <br/>
if it happens again. Then when that&#39;s settled, I go and see the other one, <br/>
who by now I can talk to. Usually that&#39;s my son but not always. That&#39;s <br/>
pretty much how we work everything out. Not always does one leave either. <br/>
They are getting more and more use staying and working it out and I even <br/>
hear them both at different times working it out together before anything <br/>
starts. How nice is that???<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m working on getting my husband to understand. He&#39;s really good with <br/>
the kids but sometimes he doesn&#39;t think right away and raises his voice, <br/>
which causes the kids to ask if he&#39;s mad at them. That&#39;s a good reminder for <br/>
him then to go a different route. He definitely doesn&#39;t want them to think <br/>
he&#39;s mad at them for whatever.<br/>
<br/>
If one of the children takes a tone maybe that isn&#39;t sounding so nice, I <br/>
will ask them to stop a minute and think if that&#39;s the way they really want <br/>
to put it. I haven&#39;t ever had any of them in the past couple of years say <br/>
yes and continue being as some might call sassy. I say past couple of years <br/>
because I have a 16 year old who we didn&#39;t nurture the same way and well, 12 <br/>
and 13 were tough years. 14 and 15 were better and now we&#39;re great!!<br/>
<br/>
I just look at what would work for me and someone saying is that what you <br/>
really meant or why are you saying it like that would cause me to stop and <br/>
listen. It works with the kids too. At the same time, they are very much <br/>
able to express anger to me or my husband and have that be fine. It&#39;s just a <br/>
matter of caring about the other person at the same time you&#39;re mad at them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893929816">Thanks Mary.  This is similar to how we handle things now.  I just like<br/>
to be able to bounce ideas off of like minded people and see what comes<br/>
out of it.  Glad to hear it is working so nicely for all of you!  So, I<br/>
just need to keep on, keepin&#39; on  :)<br/>
  So , for the person who wrote pro-spanking - in a wierd way thank you<br/>
too.   That is no way near how I want to handle my life and family .<br/>
That email can serve as a &quot;don&#39;t do this &quot; reminder.  I don&#39;t want<br/>
mindless fearful children and that is why I am on this list. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; mindless fearful children and that is why I am on this list. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I read a book called &quot;To Train up a Child&quot; by Michael and Debi <br/>
Pearl.  Believe me, those of you who were &quot;repulsed&quot; at my very mild <br/>
posts stating that I believed in parental rights would have a fit <br/>
over that book. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
After I read that book, I tried to put my finger on what exactly made <br/>
me so incredibly uncomfortable about that book, and the statement <br/>
above is exactly what I ended up realizing.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my children to obey automatically without thinking.  I <br/>
want them to be able to question what I ask them to do.  Some day <br/>
their boss might ask them to do something wrong.  Some day their <br/>
country might ask them to do something against their convictions, and <br/>
I want them to know how to stand up for what they believe.  I want <br/>
them to know the difference between what they believe and what <br/>
society tells them to believe.  I want them to think for themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even want my children to obey God without question.  That <br/>
might sounds shocking at first to another Christian, but if you think <br/>
about it, doesn&#39;t God want someone who is following Him out of love <br/>
and true conviction than out of blind obedience?  I also want my <br/>
children to question anything a church or teacher  or Christian book <br/>
tells them is &quot;God&#39;s Will&quot;.  So many people are SO easily influenced <br/>
by that kind of stuff.  I want my kids to know that the pastor can be <br/>
wrong.  The popular Christian book can be wrong.  We need to search <br/>
the truth for ourselves and find out what God is truly telling us.  <br/>
Kids raised to blindly obey without thinking might not be willing to <br/>
think and question first. <br/>

&gt; Unschooling doesn&#39;t necessarily mean not spanking.<br/>

<br/>
I think it means unpunishing and uncontrolling, right along with the<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see how you (generic you) can truly have one without the others. If<br/>
you are going to trust and respect your child&#39;s timetable, ability and<br/>
desire to learn math and how to read, I cannot fathom how you wouldn&#39;t also<br/>
trust her timetable, ability and desire to learn to be a good human being<br/>
(unpunishing) and sensible consumer of entertainment and food<br/>
(uncontrolling).<br/>
