What we have noticed here is that the TV is on more in the winter than<br/>
the summer and that if you have only let go of the restrictions for a<br/>
few weeks and saw the 3-4 hour TV watching sessions, then you haven&#39;t<br/>
let go long enough.<br/>
<br/>
Some days our TV is on for 3 hours or more, most days it never goes on<br/>
or only is on for brief periods of time.  The kids know they are allowed<br/>
to watch what and when they want, so there&#39;s no panic over missed shows,<br/>
etc...<br/>
<br/>
Right now Star Wars is on, my son (8) put it on, it&#39;s still on, he&#39;s in<br/>
his room building Star Wars inspired Legos.  My daughter (5 1/2) is<br/>
watching the movie (for her brother, she says), not her favorite but she<br/>
likes Obi Wan.<br/>
<br/>
When it&#39;s over we are going on a picnic, then home.  When we get home<br/>
the kids will either turn the TV back on, visit with me while I sew, or<br/>
play with the neighborhood kids who have some home from school.<br/>
Anything they choose to do is fine with me.  Including turning the TV<br/>
back on.<br/>
<br/>
I used to buy into all the &quot;research&quot; about how TV was bad for<br/>
developing brains.  I don&#39;t believe it anymore.  I&#39;ve seen my children<br/>
blossom being unschooled (which includes the TV).  I had a one hour<br/>
restriction TV the entire time I was growing up, trust me when I say - I<br/>
never learned to self regulate the TV!  I&#39;m a junkie when it comes to<br/>
TV!  Although after more than 20 years without the one hour limit, I&#39;m<br/>
learning to self regulate.<br/>
<br/>
We had weird restrictions on everything in my house, food, candy, milk<br/>
(!!), TV, books.  You name it, it was probably restricted.  My children<br/>
have no restrictions, they are healthier and happier than I was.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve rambled, thanks for listening.<br/>
