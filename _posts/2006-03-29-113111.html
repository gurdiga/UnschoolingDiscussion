<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586464157">&lt;&lt;I&#39;m not talking sexual contact between family members or even if you come<br/>
from a family were you never saw mom and dad kiss. <br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t get snuggles past babyhood.  Never held hands for anything but sefety<br/>
and an adults need to hurry you along.  Because those things have been<br/>
discussed.  I was thinking more about those who do snuggle, tussle, tickle,<br/>
and tease.  With all that physical contact in relaxation and play are we<br/>
teaching our children how to touch others?<br/>
<br/>
  Alowing them a greater comfort zone and mastery of basic touch skills.<br/>
(Like one of my kids learned today if you lean your pointy chin on a womans<br/>
breast she may find it painfull, as a breast isn&#39;t a fatty mass but full of<br/>
sensitive mammery glands.)  Hmmm.  going to have to think about &#39;mastering<br/>
basic touch&#39; a bit more.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I find this topic very interesting.  I too think there must be a sexual<br/>
intelligence.    <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Back to the topic of touch though.  I have two children.  My oldest (11) is<br/>
a lot like her dad in many ways.  My youngest (9) is more like me. (from<br/>
looks to personality with both of them) I enjoy touch/snuggles more than my<br/>
dh.  My dh doesn&#39;t seem to need as much touch as I do and my older dd is<br/>
like that too.  She likes to be close and even still sits on my lap often,<br/>
but she doesn&#39;t ask for back rubs and snuggles and kisses like my younger dd<br/>
does.  Snuggling with my younger dd really makes her shine.  It is obvious<br/>
when she needs a dose of love in that way.  The connection that my older dd<br/>
needs when she is down is more of a listening ear rather than touch so much.<br/>
Of course, they both need a listening ear and they both need touch, but it&#39;s<br/>
very obvious that there is a difference in their needs.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That need/lack of need for touch between my dh and I does play a role in our<br/>
sexual relationship too.  Not sure I want to go into that here though.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-808094962">Yes, I think it does depend on something within the child as well as the <br/>
way they are treated.<br/>

lessened since he fell in love (he&#39;s 22) but even so, I always get a hug <br/>
when he gets home or leaves, and many more besides. My youngest isn&#39;t <br/>
very huggy - but he does sit closer to me on a regular basis than anyone <br/>
else.<br/>
