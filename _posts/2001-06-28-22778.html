D.C. council seeks compulsory school for 2-year-olds <br/>
---------- <br/>
   About half of the District of Columbia&#39;s 13 council members <br/>
   support a new proposal that would force children as <br/>
   young as two into school. &quot;I was struck by the fact that <br/>
   so many young children enter elementary school totally <br/>
   unprepared to learn,&quot; said proposal sponsor Democrat <br/>
   Councilman Kevin Chavous, on National Public Radio. <br/>
