<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624707571">-=-Sandra, I sincerely need an answer to this question  - What exactly is the <br/>
role of this list....because maybe I&#39;m the one in the wrong place?-=-<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t need to ask me.  It&#39;s on the home page of the yahoo groups page <br/>
for this list:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Â Description    Category: Home Schooling <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn what they <br/>
need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling parent is a <br/>
facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with curiosity and <br/>
enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what, when, where and <br/>
how of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to Spongebob <br/>
Squarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or you&#39;d like to find out more <br/>
about how video games and life in general are filled with learning, come join <br/>
us!<br/>
<br/>
As discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling is <br/>
*not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed <br/>
learning, nor is it done on a part-time basis. Everyone with an interest in <br/>
unschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you keep in <br/>
mind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in ways <br/>
designed to help each other become unschoolers or become better at <br/>
unschooling. We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a <br/>
&quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members, since many listmembers love a lively <br/>
debate and questioning beliefs to their foundations. If you have questions <br/>
about this list please feel free to contact list moderator Joyce Fetteroll (<br/>
fetteroll@...)<br/>
<br/>
This list and the Unschooling.com site were created and are still supported <br/>
by Home Education Magazine: (http://www.home-ed-magazine.com); Helen Hegener (<br/>
HEM-Editor@...) is the list owner</div>
