from within the understandings of Biblical Christianity, but I <br/>
won&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; you the concepts here.  It puzzles me on this list how <br/>
people who supposedly let their children learn on their own motive <br/>
and schedule, somehow feel free to correct the other adults without <br/>
necessarily even reading what they said carefully.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this is how threads wind (or unwind?) into completely <br/>
different topics... some buzz-word triggers a person onto a pet theme <br/>
or soapbox... things that make you go, &quot;huh?&quot;<br/>
