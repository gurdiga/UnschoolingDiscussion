<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144014987">I love my Sears Kenmore cannister vac and when I stand<br/>
it up on end it takes hardly more space than an<br/>
upright - and I can say that it definatly cleans<br/>
better and more surfaces than an upright. I&#39;m in an<br/>
Apt. and don&#39;t have much space to spare either but I<br/>
would never trade the versatility of a good cannister<br/>
for another upright. My vac. has a six foot hose (most<br/>
don&#39;t) which comes in handy when doing stairs and<br/>
getting the cobwebs off the ceiling and walls and all<br/>
attatchments are stored inside the cannister. Got mine<br/>
in 1998 for $300 with part of our wedding gift money<br/>
and I&#39;m so pleased with it - I still tell my husband<br/>
how much I like it whenever I use it! ;-)<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

My advice it to go to Walmart and buy the 69.99 vacum by Ureka, Singer or such. Those others are only expensive. You can buy 4 for the price of one of the other&#39;s and you don&#39;t know if they will last!<br>
Rainbows are too much trouble to get out and do a quick once over. &nbsp;Kirbys are ok but trouble too.<br>
Don&#39;t buy a Black and Decker- I have seen too many of them at the service desk at Walmart.<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-766794995">I&#39;ve seen the rainbow vac, I was impressed, especially with the idea <br/>
of using water to clean the air.  But sooooo expensive!  and a lot of <br/>
bits.  I probably wouldn&#39;t use the main &#39;beater&#39; attachment.  I <br/>
currently have a hoover wet&#39;n&#39;dry type, the canister (us Brits call <br/>
them cylinder-vacs) is quite light, and I can&#39;t vac up without <br/>
someone asking me for a turn!  I love the manouverability of this <br/>
vac, it can reach all over, though I know the new uprights with the <br/>
integral hoses are better than my mum&#39;s old hoover where you had <br/>
to take the front off...  The other thing I like is that the muck doesn&#39;t <br/>
go anywhere near the motor, useful as I and one daughter have <br/>
long hair, I would be constantly unwinding it from the drum-brush <br/>
and belt.<br/>
<br/>
Now, unshcooling, I guess this would come under the topic of <br/>
&#39;home-economics?&#39;  LOL<br/>

think a cylinder would actually take up more space.  JMO, of <br/>

I have to agree that Rainbows are a bit of trouble to get out and set up but definitely worth it IMO. We had one of those 69.99 Eurekas from Wal-Mart before, and I&#39;m glad we made the switch. Of course we have a dog and the Eureka picked up very little dog hair compared with the Rainbow, so that&#39;s one reason we like it. And of course if you&#39;re dealing with lots of allergies, the Rainbow is a great way to help out that problem. Gee, now I&#39;m sounding like a vacuum salesperson. Sorry, didn&#39;t mean to turn this into a sales pitch. LOL!<br>

Several years ago my hubby and I bought three vacs like those described above <br/>
in about two years and I finally said...that&#39;s it, I&#39;m going to pay more and <br/>
get a good one.  I bought a Panasonic for about $225 and it has been well <br/>
worth it.  We&#39;ve had it now for eight years and it is still going strong.  My <br/>
Mom has an Oreck 8 pounder (also expensive), but it is amazing.  That&#39;s where <br/>
I would go if I were looking for a vacuum now.  Sometimes I think it just <br/>
pays to buy quality.  Look into warranties, too.  My Panasonic had a 15 year <br/>
replacement warranty.  Of course,  I do a lot of vacuuming because we have 7 <br/>
kids, a dog and a cat, plus lots of dirt!  Just my opinion...<br/>

That&#39;s great, Susan! Sounds as if you got a terrific vacuum cleaner.<br>

Hee, hee. That reminds me, Susan, of what my husband said after we purchased our rainbow almost a year ago. He said he&#39;d be vacuuming much more often. Sure. I think he&#39;s used the vacuum a total of half a dozen times. I guess I&#39;ll let it go, though, since he always loads the dishwasher :).<br>
