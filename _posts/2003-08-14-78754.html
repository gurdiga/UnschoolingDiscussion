&gt; Just vaguely making blanket exceptions for vague &quot;disorders&quot; like that is <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No one is doing that.. Really, just relax.   We are talking about a process.. <br/>
No one is advocating or suggesting to &quot;GET THEM BOOKS OUT and teach Johnny to <br/>
read!  HOOKED ON PHONICS TO THE RESCUE!  OH, Lord, somebody call Ned Vare!!, <br/>
my kid can&#39;t read yet!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works.  No one is saying that it doesn&#39;t   Nobody is saying that <br/>
children will not learn to read, when they are ready, through unschooling ( <br/>
the happy bubbly kind that someone else mentioned).  My initial point was just <br/>
that reading does not come naturally to all children, OR adults.    It&#39;s not a <br/>
slam on unschooling or a &quot;loop hole&quot; Nobody is saying &quot;OH OH.. unschooling <br/>
does not work with everybody&quot;   Why do you think that everything is a <br/>
&quot;questioning the integrity&quot; , of the &quot;rightness&quot; of unschooling? That is not the case at <br/>
all.  <br/>
<br/>
ATTENTION NEWBIES WHO ARE ON THE FENCE, in case you mistakenly thought I <br/>
meant that unschooling is not good for a child who does not read &quot;naturally&quot;<br/>
<br/>
GOD, unschooling is the absolute, 100%, without a doubt, BEST  way for folks <br/>
who have difficulty learning to read to be able to overcome those challanges <br/>
and go on to be the best readers they want to be.  I know it works.  I have <br/>
seen, read, heard, and LIVED that it works.    But it will take all the &quot;things&quot;, <br/>
interaction, support, exposure,  that others have talked about, things that <br/>
are PROactive, rather than REactive, to help the child learn to read at thier <br/>
own time and comfort level. NO NO NO, not lessons and workbooks and programs <br/>
and &quot;intervention&quot;  Just living and loving and being there for the kid.  <br/>
Providing books.. heck all kinds of printed material, reading aloud to them, <br/>
answering thier questions, all the stuff other folks have already mentioned.     <br/>
