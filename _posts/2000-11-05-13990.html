<div id="ygrps-yiv-527282623">Here is a fabulous web resource all about what is widely recognized as the<br/>
greatest upset in presidential election history:<br/>
Harry Truman, the only president in this century to not hold a college<br/>
degree, surprised the world by defeating the powerful and exquisitely<br/>
well-connected conservative, Thomas E. Dewey.  A modern-day David and<br/>
Goliath story.<br/>

Interestingly enough, one of the candidates in that election is still alive<br/>
today, 52 years later!  Do you know who I&#39;m talking about?<br/>

A pre-election story on Thomas E. Dewey, the man whose victory was a<br/>
foregone conclusion according to most pollsters and political experts:<br/>
<br/>
(From the whistlestop.org site) &gt;&gt;&quot;The governor of New York,&quot; Sidney<br/>
Shallett aptly observed in the Saturday Evening Post, &quot;talks not like a man<br/>
who wants to be President, but like a man who already is President in<br/>
everything but name, and who merely is awaiting the inaugural date before<br/>
taking over.&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>
