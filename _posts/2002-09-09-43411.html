<br/>
I think that&#39;s the major reason.<br/>
<br/>
Another related reason is that early sexual activity doesn&#39;t as often <br/>
traumatize boys as it does girls.  Two of my adult male friends had sex at <br/>
12, each with a teenaged girl babysitter (in totally different towns, not the <br/>
same girl).  They aren&#39;t ashamed of it nor seem to feel that they were ruined <br/>
or robbed.  That didn&#39;t even involve them leaving the house!  Their parents <br/>
PAID those girls to come over.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote> I&#39;d like to live in a world where &#39;getting pregnant&#39; isn&#39;t seen as a <br/>
complete disaster, even if you do it at 13 or its an accident. If the <br/>
female chooses to keep the baby then it shouldn&#39;t be an <br/>
impediment to anything else she wants to do with her life. If she <br/>
wants to go to university there should be creches, child support etc <br/>
etc.<br/>
It shouldn&#39;t be an automatic sentence into poverty and single <br/>
parenthood.<br/>
<br/>
There also still seems to be young people out there who still don&#39;t <br/>
know how to make choices, about how to avoid pregnancy. I <br/>
helped out at a youth advisory centre in the UK before I came here <br/>
and teenagers were still convinced you couldn&#39;t &#39;get pregnant&#39; the <br/>
first time. Or if you didn&#39;t love the boy.<br/>
It was heart-breaking dealing with a pregnant 13 yo whose parents <br/>
disowned her because she was pregnant, knowing that the state <br/>
would judge her unfit when she gave birth and would probably take <br/>
her baby away.<br/>
Proper sex education may have helped, also empowering girls so <br/>
that they can either feel strong enough to say no, not going along <br/>
with their mates, and strong enough to use contraception. British <br/>
sex education in schools often doesn&#39;t happen till 15 and lasts <br/>
about half an hour. When I was in school we got shown a video of a <br/>
baby being born. That was it. No mention of where the baby came <br/>
from. Of course, we all knew, as we gained our education from <br/>
discussions with other 15 year olds....<br/>
<br/>
Sigh<br/>

<br/>
That does not follow.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to suggest that those of us who don&#39;t tuck our teenaged boys in <br/>
bed before 10:00 don&#39;t care about respect or disease.  It doesn&#39;t follow at <br/>
all.<br/>

<br/>
My boys are not promiscuous.  They&#39;re not sexually active.  They&#39;re not <br/>
dating.  They do things with groups of kids, usually groups of all males, but <br/>
often with some subset of the six homeschooling teenaged girls who are part <br/>
of their social lives too.<br/>

on boys I knew of that weren&#39;t homeschooled. You were the one in fact that <br/>
said stick to unschooling kids and not kids in general. I just agreed with <br/>
what someone else posted. No one ever said anything about anybody&#39;s boys <br/>
here on the list or anyone else that was homeschooled. Are you missing posts <br/>

lol! I guess this does come into it..We have boys and I often wonder how our family and parenting may be different because of having all boys rather than girls or a mix. Is there a difference? Do we treat them differently than we would if they were girls? I really am not sure..Leonie W. <br/>

Ours are only 9 and 6 (almost 10 & 7 &lt;g&gt;) - we have one of each, and *so <br/>
far* we haven&#39;t treated them differently. Course that could change in those <br/>
teenage years, but we&#39;ll cross that bridge when we get to it :)<br/>
