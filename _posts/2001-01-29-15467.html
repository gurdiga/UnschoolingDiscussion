<br/>
1.)  Sure, your son can come live with me, (though it&#39;s a little cold<br/>
here right now!) and<br/>
2.)  No, sorry, I don&#39;t know Kyle!  I have met Joni Mitchell&#39;s family<br/>
though and one of Joni&#39;s claims to fame is the fact that she is a proud<br/>
&quot;flatlander&quot; from right here; Saskatoon, Saskatchewan!<br/>
<br/>
Sending lots of Saskatchewan sunshine to everyone out there...<br/>
