<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083496939">I&#39;m wondering again. Okay, I hear you all sighing!!!<br/>
<br/>
We use to have dinner time every day with all of us sitting down together. I <br/>
thought it was important. I was raised that way and I always remember that <br/>
we did it and it was nice.<br/>
<br/>
Well we don&#39;t do that anymore. My husband is very rarely home at a time when <br/>
everyone is hungry to sit down and eat together. I haven&#39;t really noticed a <br/>
difference in a bad way. It&#39;s been quite awhile now that it&#39;s been like <br/>
this. I don&#39;t see it as a problem.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone else does this or doesn&#39;t do it and what their <br/>
take is on this?<br/>

<br/>
Wow. That is an issue here right now. More for me probably, than anyone.<br/>
I was raised to think this was good and right. Had to think it through and <br/>
realize that&#39;s probably because it was the only time the whole family was <br/>
actually together in the whole entire day. So the importance was in the <br/>
connection because everyone is so fragmented by school and work.<br/>
In an unschooling family there is loads of time that everyone is together, <br/>
compared to the average family.<br/>
So no, I don&#39;t think it really is a big deal.<br/>
But I LIKE having meals together. Mainly because it means I actually cooked a <br/>
real meal, not just threw sandwiches or other quick stuff together.<br/>
It makes me happy to have us all sitting down, chatting, eathing yummy food I <br/>
cooked and just being together.<br/>
But working in the evenings has put a damper on it, so I try to remind myself <br/>
that it won&#39;t always be like this and we will have some meals together again.<br/>
sigh...<br/>

I have a friend who homeschools and is so much of a morning person that<br/>
she doesn&#39;t usually even want to eat dinner, she&#39;s that zonked in the<br/>
early evening.  Her take on the dinner issue, is that since we give our<br/>
kids lots of attention throughout the rest of the day, we should get a<br/>
free pass on dinner if we want it.  In my house, scandalous though it<br/>
may be, we eat dinner kind of collapsed in front of the television.  We<br/>
have our best conversation in the car (dh) or at bedtime (ds).  (Not to<br/>
mention mini-conversations during commercial breaks. &lt;bweg&gt;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree that all families need time together as a family.  In this<br/>
modern day society, most families don&#39;t have time for each other EXCEPT<br/>
at dinner time, so they force themselves to catch up with each other<br/>
then.  Since I spend all day with my kids and quite a few hours with DH,<br/>
too, (and he with the kids), we just don&#39;t need this.  As a matter of a<br/>
fact, we do usually eat together, but I don&#39;t freak out when we don&#39;t. <br/>
For example, the other night my 6yo was eating supper in the kitchen and<br/>
I was about to sit next to her to eat mine.  I decided that I&#39;d rather<br/>
sit in the living room and I invited her to bring her dinner and join<br/>
me.  She declined, stating that she would rather eat by herself and have<br/>
some time alone.  No big deal.  I&#39;d been with her ALL DAY.  What was a<br/>
half hour apart?  Probably good for both of us, actually.  <br/>

It&#39;s not the dinner specifically that&#39;s important, it&#39;s the opportunity to<br/>
connect. Dinner just makes it convenient.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, my parents would discuss adult things mostly at dinner. I<br/>
think. I didn&#39;t pay much attention. Whatever it was, it was deadly dull ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I wanted dinner when I had a family to be full of interesting converstation<br/>
but since I&#39;m not a talker and my husband isn&#39;t a talker I finally was<br/>
honest in my expectations and realized it was a lot more fun to watch TV<br/>
while we ate :-) We talk on walks and in the car and connect at other times.<br/>
Works much better.<br/>

<br/>
I guess I never looked at that way. Come to think of it, when I was growing <br/>
up, generally during the week, it was the only time we had to be together. <br/>
With school and work and homework, my mom and dad and I seemed busy all the <br/>
other times.<br/>
<br/>
My kids and I of course spend loads of time together and my husband although <br/>
working late, does the same. As soon as he comes home, he&#39;s in the playroom <br/>
for at least a few hours. Being they don&#39;t have a bedtime, it works for them <br/>
all. He also does many field trips with us and always comes with me to pick <br/>
up the kids from sports camp every Friday. I guess that&#39;s why I don&#39;t see a <br/>
negative thing attached to it.<br/>

because it&#39;s an obvious time for us.  DH goes to work at 5:30 a.m., and<br/>
comes home by 6 or 7 p.m. (he&#39;s army, lousy work hours!).  He&#39;s hungry,<br/>
we&#39;re hungry, we eat.  Since we haven&#39;t seen him all day, so it gives<br/>
everybody a chance to talk.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t see it as a problem, at least right now, then ok.  If it<br/>
becomes one later, couldn&#39;t you just go back to having a shared mealtime?<br/>
I&#39;m assuming you have other family gathering times or whatever, when you are<br/>
all together and can do something or talk or whatever.  Isn&#39;t that the<br/>
point?  It&#39;s not as though the food is the critical issue.<br/>

Sometimes we all sit at the supper table together to eat, sometimes not. It <br/>
really just depends on the &quot;mood&quot; at the time supper is being served. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
In other words, we have no &quot;set&quot; way of doing &quot;supper time&quot; :-)<br/>

Yes we do have plenty of other times we are all together. I had said before, <br/>
although my husband works late, because of the kids staying up late he gets <br/>
to spend plenty of time with them in the evening. I have my time during the <br/>
day and we all do many field trips together. And the obvious birthday <br/>
holiday things too.<br/>
<br/>
The point is the together time and I was just not seeing as simple as that. <br/>
I guess years of hearing dinner time should ALWAYS be done as a family <br/>
engrained in my brain. For the most part every day the kids all eat together <br/>
and I see that as important time for them too.<br/>
