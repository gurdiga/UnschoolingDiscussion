<div id="ygrps-yiv-238537040">Wow, what an amazing amount of response to my<br/>
questions! I really appreciate it! <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot to process in what you all said. I&#39;ll<br/>
have to read it a couple times. :) To answer some<br/>
questions, I don&#39;t know why I consider sci-fi trash.<br/>
Probably my English major background.;) Someone said<br/>
if I limit what he reads it could stifle his love of<br/>
reading. Thanks for that. I need to keep that in mind.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t *have* them do stuff like build models. But I<br/>
*will* grab a book from the library about Egypt<br/>
activities since they&#39;re into that Pharoah game, and<br/>
leave it lying around enticingly. Then they come to me<br/>
and say can we build this river delta?  Now I&#39;m<br/>
thinking I could leave some space activity stuff<br/>
around and soon they&#39;ll be building spaceships. :) I<br/>
do want to encourage the interest in science that<br/>
leads to wanting to read sci-fi. Luckily, I haven&#39;t<br/>
*sneered* at the sci-fi books. So I don&#39;t think he<br/>
senses disapproval. <br/>
<br/>
Someone asked about why I&#39;m worried about the scary<br/>
parts if I know he&#39;ll stop reading. Well, that&#39;s<br/>
because of my kids&#39; sensitivity. My dd, for example,<br/>
loves marine animals, and she got a National<br/>
Geographic shark video, which had a graphic, bloody<br/>
attack scene at the very beginning. Of course she<br/>
stopped watching, but still, it was enough to have her<br/>
afraid to go in the ocean when we visited Texas, to<br/>
have her need to sleep with me for weeks, to have her<br/>
not want to read *any* marine animal books or watch<br/>
*any* movies that might have anything popl out at her<br/>
again. I guess I was worried that adult sci-fi would<br/>
have some sort of effect like that on my son. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks again, SO MUCH, for all the advice.<br/>
Juli<br/>
