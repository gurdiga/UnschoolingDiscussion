<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730509683">&lt;&lt;  From the <br/>
beginning, I thought that I would see such a difference in children who were <br/>
homeschooled from those that went to school. And even though I know <br/>
homeschooled doesn&#39;t always mean a great difference from being in school, I <br/>
still thought I would see the children behave differently. I don&#39;t and I <br/>
must say I&#39;m a bit surprised.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Extremely sheltered kids seem different, but sometimes they seem just <br/>
extremely sheltered.<br/>
<br/>
I know two sheltering homeschooling families here.  One was La Leche League, <br/>
but the mom was blind and the oldest girl did most of the housework and <br/>
childcare, and the family was full of rules.  (I haven&#39;t been counting them <br/>
in the four homeschooling families I knew, because they weren&#39;t in my <br/>
babysitting co-op, and I mostly knew the girl from her babysitting another <br/>
family I know; they weren&#39;t homeschoolers.)    The girl married as a <br/>
teenager.  She hadn&#39;t dated at all, as far as I could see, so it seems to me <br/>
(I&#39;m not sure) that she found someone at church and married him as that was <br/>
her only real escape from her house.  She was &quot;a good kid&quot; and things were <br/>
peaceful at home as far as I ever knew, but marrying someone was her <br/>
&quot;success.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another family lives very rurally and they use correspondence school for <br/>
their kids.  Other than the SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism) their kids <br/>
didn&#39;t have much &quot;educational exposure&quot; (not a good term, but good enough for <br/>
this story) because the parents figured the correspondence school would be <br/>
their education.  Period.  So the kids are not very broadly exposed to <br/>
things.  The oldest married at 16 or 17 and moved to England.  The second is <br/>
an irritating punk macho boy (Kirby says he&#39;s better lately, but I don&#39;t care <br/>
enough to find out, personally).  The third lived for years babysitting for a <br/>
very schoolish family, but at least it got her away from the boring rural <br/>
correspondence school life and around people who listened to musicals, read <br/>
books, played games and talked.  Even though they badmouthed homeschooling.  <br/>
And she&#39;s always had Kirby and Marty to lean toward or stand next to if <br/>
anyone badmouthed homeschooling too much.<br/>
<br/>
But neither of those stories involves unschooling families.  They both <br/>
involve early marriage/escape.<br/>
<br/>
When people have tried to associate me with school-at-home families, I&#39;ve <br/>
always resisted, from the very beginning, when Kirby was five.  In person, I <br/>
indicate with a drawing or an object &quot;Here is school.  On this side are the <br/>
conservative homeschoolers who homeschool because they think school is <br/>
teaching their children too much, and they want to shelter them.   Here (on <br/>
the opposite side of my &quot;school&quot;) we are, and other families who homeschool <br/>
because they think school is too narrow and too limiting.  We want our kids <br/>
to know MORE than school was going to teach them.  We think school is too <br/>
limiting.  They think school isn&#39;t limiting enough.  They&#39;re on the far other <br/>
side of school from us.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Since my homeschooling has always been based on Kirby himself (since he <br/>
wasn&#39;t going to do well in a school situation when he was little) and on my <br/>
philosophies about how learning best works, I was never in it for the <br/>
political-statement or social-statement reasons that would cause people to <br/>
say &quot;Homeschoolers need to all band together.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know that over the years I&#39;ve irritated people who were trying to <br/>
accomplish political action of one sort or another, or to get a numbers-base. <br/>
 I didn&#39;t want to be counted with people whose kids are home because they <br/>
don&#39;t want them to meet people of other religions or beliefs, or they don&#39;t <br/>
want their kids being with people of other races or cultures, or they don&#39;t <br/>
want anyone suggesting to their children that homosexuality is anything <br/>
except sinful depravity, and that maybe people are somehow related to apes <br/>
and monkeys.   I don&#39;t want to help them homeschool.  I don&#39;t even really <br/>
want to help them preserve their right to isolate their children and lie to <br/>
them and make them read books which are fantasy-based or Bible-based <br/>
reconstructed history and science.  I think it&#39;s stupid.   <br/>
<br/>
What they prove when their kids get good test scores is that one-on-one <br/>
forced education works better than mass forced education.  I don&#39;t care to <br/>
contribute to the proving of that.  It makes me sick to think about those <br/>
poor kids with noplace to go after &quot;school&quot; when school&#39;s at home.<br/>
<br/>
Where their advantage does lie is that a child who is dorky or awkward, or <br/>
has a speech impediment, or is funny looking and who would have been chewed <br/>
up and spit out at school can, by being homeschooled, be confident and calm, <br/>
and that often shows in speech and movement.  I&#39;ve met a couple of young <br/>
adolescent boys and I knew they were homeschooled right away, because even <br/>
though they were the kind of boys who would have had the gloss of shame and <br/>
fear on them in school, they were bright-eyed and direct even though their <br/>
clothes and haircuts were not nearly stylish, or would have been downright <br/>
unacceptable in a school setting.<br/>
<br/>
So preventing overt bully-damage and teacher-shame is the best I see those <br/>
families doing.<br/>
<br/>
That, and if you LIKE that sort of thing, they&#39;re raising kids who are <br/>
unaware of the diversity of the world around them.   As fantasy life goes, <br/>
some people DO like that.  And I think some new-age families end up doing the <br/>
same thing to an extent, if their kids are around pagans and wiccans and <br/>
celebrate the neo-pagan equinox and solstice holidays, and they aren&#39;t made <br/>
aware that in some parts of the country that could get them really shunned <br/>
bigtime.  <br/>
<br/>
Sandra, just rambling now, but onto something, maybe</div>
