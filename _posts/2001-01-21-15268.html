<div id="ygrps-yiv-701973941">I plan on making these with the kids and talk about the effects of some <br/>
commercial products on the environment and about being more self-reliant by <br/>
making our own cleaning stuff.  I haven&#39;t tried this yet but I&#39;m gathering <br/>
the ingredients now and will be trying it soon.  The washing powder is <br/>
supposed to last a family of 4 for a year.  I think the kids will have a <br/>
blast grating the soap!<br/>

One possibility is we use less. I like using borax for<br/>
my occaisional sanitizing cleansing becasue I have<br/>
become very sensative to the smells of other cleaners.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even like the citris smells added to some<br/>
&#39;natural cleaners&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Anything natural or man made can be a pollutant when<br/>
dumped  in sufficient numbers. That can include the<br/>
leftovers from juicing apples that would get dumped<br/>
illegally in the waterways near my old home. So<br/>
somthing that seems as benign as apples can become<br/>
toxic.<br/>
<br/>
There are no easy answers. Use less is my motto. <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

I don&#39;t know all of the answers but I have read that commercial laundry soaps <br/>
have a lot of filler which can be just about anything.  I think just putting <br/>
less &quot;stuff&quot; in the water shed it part of the solution.  I know phosphates <br/>
are a concern as well but can&#39;t claim to know that borax is less harmful.<br/>
