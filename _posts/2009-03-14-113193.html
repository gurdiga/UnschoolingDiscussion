<br/>
There&#39;s an UNSCHOOLING Conference this Sept in San Diego!!<br/>
<br/>
Good Vibrations Unschooling Conference<br/>
Sept 10-13, 2009<br/>
Doubletree Hotel near Del Mar<br/>
<br/>
EARLY BIRD REGISTRATION ENDS IN LESS THAN 6 WEEKS!!<br/>
<br/>
Start a new tradition--Be here for our inauguration--Start making memories! Be<br/>
a founding family of the Good Vibrations Unschooling Conference.<br/>
<br/>
This is your opportunity to mix it up with other unschoolers in a swirl of<br/>
trust, support and celebration! Our fabulous speakers are ready to inspire with<br/>
radical thoughts, ideas to end resistance and wisdom to make your unschooling<br/>
life the best that it can be. I can feel the energy and excitement already as I<br/>
picture the day at the beach, the wildly entertaining talent show, the dancing,<br/>
the funshops, round-table discussions, unschoolers happy and free, kids trusted<br/>
and loved! It will be amazing! And it&#39;s right in your backyard. Did I mention<br/>
the beach, lounging by the pool? And surfing lessons? Yeah, those, too.<br/>
<br/>
All the exciting details are here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://GoodVibrationsConference.com">http://GoodVibrationsConference.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m especially excited about Roya Sorooshian. She&#39;s a grown unschooler who will<br/>
be one of our main presenters- an absolute delightful person who is living a<br/>
joyful, productive and busy life! Come see what unschooling looks like when<br/>
it&#39;s all grown up. :) And her mom, Pam Sorooshian will be speaking, too,<br/>
sharing the wisdom she&#39;s gleaned through her many years of unschooling. Other<br/>
speakers include Jeff Sabo, Miranda Demarest, Rain Fordyce, Beth Fuller, Erika B<br/>
Perkins and Sandra Dodd, all ready to deliver positive, inspiring unschooling<br/>
messages. You will be refreshed and renewed!<br/>
<br/>
My favorite funshop? Hard to choose. Team Twilight? HSM Dance Party? <br/>
Knitting? Oh, I know- International Candy Tasting!<br/>
<br/>
This conference is where you&#39;ll pick up lots of good vibrations and a lots of<br/>
unschooling friends. We can never have enough, right?<br/>
<br/>
So head on over today to join us in the sun and sand at the discounted rate.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and don&#39;t forget to reserve your hotel room, too. And join the discussion<br/>
group to get in on the chatter.<br/>
<br/>
See you in September!<br/>
