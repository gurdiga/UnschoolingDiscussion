&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t think the word &quot;cliquish&quot; is a fair description.  We have <br/>
&quot;camaraderie&quot; built up among people who agree strongly and have <br/>
participated in the list for a long time.  However, I don&#39;t think that <br/>
that existing affection between posters is actually used to taunt others <br/>
or to play &quot;keep away&quot; from them or to purposely make people feel &quot;less <br/>
than&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good point.  If there were an unschooling list which was invitation only and <br/>
you kept hearing it was good, but you couldn&#39;t get invited, and they  kept <br/>
having information you wanted but wouldn&#39;t let you have it, THAT might be a <br/>
clique.<br/>

&quot;Clique&quot; is an insult-word, used only in negative ways.<br/>

<br/>
Three Cheers For Cliques <br/>
by Michael Cook  <br/>
<br/>
It is common practice in our clubs to say &quot;Of course&#39; this club is run by a <br/>
little clique, and nobody can break in.&quot; The connotation is overwhelmingly <br/>
negative. <br/>
<br/>
True sometimes. <br/>
<br/>
However it can be said of most clubs that there is a core group of people who <br/>
do most of the work. attend virtually all of the events, and keep the <br/>
organization running. <br/>
<br/>
They also form a clique - &quot;A small, exclusive group of people&quot; according to <br/>
Random House. No negative connotation. <br/>
<br/>
This type of clique doesn&#39;t want to be exclusive. They want others to join <br/>
them. They want help doing all of the things they do for the organization. They <br/>
want company at all of the eventsthey so faithfully attend. BUT, they will be <br/>
there working, anyway. /P&gt; Sure, there are cliques which jealously guard their <br/>
control over a club and refuse to let other members penetrate their little <br/>
organizational group, but there are few of those. In most clubs, the small group <br/>
of people you see regularly on the list of officers and heading committees <br/>
are really the most interested members. <br/>
<br/>
This type of clique doesn&#39;t deserve jealous critcism. They merit your <br/>
support. The real enemies of the organization are the members who don&#39;t volunteer but <br/>
stand around complaining about cliques! If there isn&#39;t a core group of <br/>
interested peopleto keep a club running, there will soon be no club. When the core <br/>
group decides they have had enough of carrying the load, let&#39;s hope there are <br/>
other members ready to step in and shoulder it. <br/>
<br/>
Have you helped your club&#39;s clique lately? <br/>

David, who are you protecting here?  What are you trying to do?  It seems that<br/>
your trying to say that this has damaged the group and that worries you, but<br/>
it makes me think you are just using this oppurtunity to cast your imaginary<br/>
&#39;clique&#39; in a light of shame.  I don&#39;t believe such a clique exists.  The term<br/>
&#39;clique&#39; carries a connotation of exclusion, an element which simply does not<br/>
exist.  Jonathan&#39;s offhand remark doesn&#39;t seem to have offended anyone, or<br/>
they would have said something.  You yourself don&#39;t seem to be offended, just<br/>
carrying on with your political manuvering.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that after Jonathan responded to your last email about &#39;Those<br/>
concerned about the future of WPLUG&#39; and made some very good points, you have<br/>
resorted to attacking HIM personally under the cover of, &#39;look what you&#39;ve<br/>
done to the group&#39;.<br/>
<br/>

-----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
What is a clique, anyhow?<br/>
    Clique 1. Noun. A small, exclusive set of people. <br/>
    Exclusive 1. Adjective. not shared with any others, confined to a <br/>
selected few. <br/>
    Exclude 1. Verb. To keep out, prevent or forbid the entry of. <br/>
    <br/>
Some groups are, by nature, exclusive. It’s important to define the reason <br/>
for the exclusivity <br/>
before we call that group a ‘clique’, which has a negative connotation. <br/>
<br/>
In order to run programs or functions in any organization, committees or <br/>
groups must be formed. People are chosen, by various methods, to be on such <br/>
committees. If these groups were accessible to everyone at any time, there would be <br/>
little work accomplished. As the saying goes, “Too many cooks spoil the <br/>
broth.” Congress is this kind of group. By definition these committees could be <br/>
called ‘cliques,’ as they are exclusive. Cliques are a matter of perception - <br/>
unless you really are trying to prevent someone from befriending your friend. <br/>
This is a truly rare occurrence. <br/>
<br/>
It’s not our job to judge, to label as cliques or to purposely exclude <br/>
others. As Christians, we are a chosen people. From the outside, we might look like <br/>
a clique. Let’s do what we can to be an “inclusive clique.” One that draws <br/>
others into fellowship in Christ! <br/>

So on just the first page of a google search, I found similar discussions <br/>
about religion, geekitude and car ownership.<br/>
<br/>
This list is for unschoolers to discuss unschooling.<br/>
If anyone who is NOT really interested in that feels like an outsider, that&#39;s <br/>
not a bad thing.<br/>
If people who don&#39;t contribute resent those who do contribute, that&#39;s a <br/>
personal problem.<br/>

Maybe that&#39;s  what&#39;s happening on this list. People subscribe and see the obvious &#39;camaradarie&#39; (sp?) and feel uncertain about whether they will fit in and begin to post emotionally primed for rejection. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how you overcome that. I mean, you can&#39;t expect people who have connected and built up friendships to pretend that they haven&#39;t.

You can&#39;t expect to feel included in something when you&#39;ve just begun.  But that doesn&#39;t mean the group is a clique.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think with lists, there are going to be certain people who post certain ways.   And not all posters are going to be appreciated by all.  Alot of what people have been complaining about here is what actually helped me get to my place in unschooling.   I am completely sold,  not a question in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad that we have honest, get to the point, no beating around the bush people here!!    Can I bring a few of you with me to my own Minnesota list?  &lt;g&gt;  Ya see,  I&#39;m too honest with my list. :)<br/>

that I&#39;d found a home and wanted to be friends with some of the people <br/>
there. So I stalked them &lt;BEG&gt;. I&#39;m only kind of kidding, because I did <br/>
know I wanted to be friends, but you can&#39;t just instantly create <br/>
friendships - I read for months without saying anything. Then I went to <br/>
some live chats - we used to have a lot of them on AOL.  I asked <br/>
questions - didn&#39;t argue - cracked a few jokes here and there. I wasn&#39;t <br/>
GIVING advice at that time - I was getting it only. But I did write, <br/>
offlist and on, responses to posts that really meant something to me. <br/>
Slowly, over the YEARS, not days or weeks, I got to know some people <br/>
better and better. I went to conferences - quite a few of them - and <br/>
met people in person. Offered rides to and from the airport so I&#39;d have <br/>
some undistracted one-on-one time with somebody I especially liked <br/>
online &lt;G&gt;. Invited them to meet for dinner or even stay at my house <br/>
when they were in town or just passing through.  Invited them to my <br/>
support group park days. I made a pretty concerted effort to develop <br/>
friendships with people I really respected and admired and who seemed <br/>
really FUN to me. Some panned out - some didn&#39;t. Some were disastrous, <br/>
by the way. Some are among my dearest closest friends now. Some are on <br/>
this list.<br/>

just in maybe the past year or less starting to post more. This is the <br/>
first time I&#39;ve really felt I could be a *responder* rather than only an <br/>
*asker*. Some of that, of course, is because my kids are so young--the <br/>
oldest is just *not-starting* kindergarten this month. But some of it is <br/>
because it just takes a while to work through whether this list is <br/>
&quot;home&quot; and feel comfortable with it.<br/>

&gt;GIVING advice at that time - I was getting it only. But I did write, <br/>

join in.  Maybe it&#39;s just a personality thing.  If I hear someone in line at <br/>
Walmart talking about something that I&#39;m interested in, I join the <br/>
conversation...especially if they&#39;re pondering the answer to something and I can help <br/>
them. :o)  <br/>

<br/>
We (us and another family) went on an expedition one time up in Maine and <br/>
we were looking for a particular lighthouse.  We got pretty lost and <br/>
finally Jimmy (my husband) suggested we pull over and he&#39;d go up to a house <br/>
and ask directions (thus breaking yet another male stereotype).  He went up <br/>
to this house and rang the bell. The door opened and we could see Jimmy and <br/>
this man talking.  After a few moments, Jimmy came back to the car and got in.<br/>
<br/>
We asked him what the guy had said.  Jimmy said, &quot;I don&#39;t know! I couldn&#39;t <br/>
understand ONE THING that man just said!&quot;<br/>

  &gt;   &gt; Nancy B. in WV, who honestly can&#39;t take another person joining this list <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; then <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; calling it&#39;s members mean<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   Well, Nancy----then it&#39;s going to be a lo-o-o-ong row for you to hoe!<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   It happens.<br/>

  I&#39;m sorry, Janis---it was a joke (maybe yours was too?). I was just saying <br/>
  that it was happening since before I joined---and I doubt it&#39;ll ever stop. Nancy <br/>
  will probably be very disappointed if she thinks newbies will *always* <br/>
  understand this list from the get-go.<br/>
