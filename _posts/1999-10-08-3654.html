<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846154027">Carolyn,I did not have an unmedicated delivery and although I felt a<br/>
twinge of guilt at first, it faded quickly.� The important and only fact<br/>
that is relevant is a healthy child.� The same for the breasfeeding.�<br/>
Some things are meant to happen for a reason.� Please stop feeling<br/>
guilty or let down.� You did every thing that you could do and it was<br/>
just not meant to be.� It does not mean that you are less a mother<br/>
because you used medication.� You nutured that baby for nine months<br/>
inside your body and you did everything to insure that the baby was<br/>
delivered into this world healthy and safe.<br/>

&gt; birth<br/>
&gt; is clearly best for babies, but Annie did not get one of those.� I<br/>
&gt; regret it<br/>
&gt; every day and think about it every day.� And we probably won&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; another,<br/>
&gt; so I won&#39;t get to experience the kinds of births I read about that<br/>

I have three kids.  The first was delivered with epidural, breaking of the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-642198114">My wife had two kids the old hospital route 25+ years ago and then our 10 year<br/>
old was born with a midwife in hospital after we went there from home when there<br/>
was meconium in the water.  We had a uneventful (almost oxymoronic) birth,<br/>
stayed for four hours, received what sadly seems to be typical abusive hospital<br/>
treatment (especially if you were trying for a home birth) and went home.  Our<br/>
six year old was born at home, even though there was meconium in the water.<br/>
Fortunately the birth happened almost immediately after the water broke.  In my<br/>
wife&#39;s experience the less medical involvement the easier, happier the birth. As<br/>
a nurse I continue to be almost incredulous at the treatment we received in<br/>
hospital.  The power problems of some nurses are enormous.  If they don&#39;t have<br/>
total control and if &quot;patients&quot; don&#39;t just do what they&#39;re told some nurses just<br/>
go nuts apparently.   I really do wish there was a way to let people know ahead<br/>
of time about the home birth option and the non medical model for child birth.<br/>
The suffering of women under the medical model( most of whom should not be<br/>
there), is enormous.<br/>
<br/>
Our then four year old was present for the birth and enjoyed it immensely. Our<br/>
grown twenties something daughter was present for both births.  It was<br/>
wonderful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-519653864">I wish I had known about the home birthing earlier....though by our third<br/>
child I knew,  but decided against it ( I just couldn&#39;t figure out how it<br/>
would work,  though didn&#39;t explore it thoroughly).  Our family physician&#39;s<br/>
wife home birthed most of their children.  (They also homeschool,  so he is<br/>
a &#39;true&#39;  physician for us!)<br/>
Anyway,  Joel,  your post reminded me of my hospital experience with my<br/>
second child.....I was there less than 24 hrs,  and that seemed TOO long!!<br/>
I could hardly wait to get put of there and back to the peace of our<br/>
home...with our family together.<br/>
    And since I got on this hospital treatment topic.....Our toddler was<br/>
recently hospitalized for croup.  I battled all night with the resident who<br/>
wanted to run a whole myriad of ridiculous tests to rule out every rare and<br/>
unlikely disease in existence!!  And he denied my simple request to have a<br/>
humidifier to help her breathe.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;GRRRR!!!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
    I literally had to fight off the phlebotomist (I can&#39;t remember why they<br/>
wanted to collect blood...);  I had to refuse the test repeatedly and<br/>
finally,  pulled my daughter out of her hands.  The nurse also became my<br/>
enemy rather than my daughter&#39;s advocate......She claimed to me that she&#39;d<br/>
try to convey my wishes to the resident,  yet she advocated for him....and<br/>
snuck the phlebotomist back in the room at 5:30 a.m. when I had fallen<br/>
asleep.  I saw her note that said I agreed to have the test in the early<br/>
a.m.  -- which I did not.  I was able to confront her before she left her<br/>
shift that morning.   PHEW!  It&#39;s exhausting in the retelling,  too!!<br/>
    Well,  thanks for listening everyone.....sorry to be such a lurker<br/>
around here...I have so many opinions I&#39;d like to contribute to these lively<br/>
discussions  Alas,  I have committed myself to a personal fitness program,<br/>
so my mornings are currently devoted to brisk 45  minute walks .... I&#39;m<br/>
barely able to read my e-mail,  much less resapond!! ;-)<br/>
Good night all....<br/>

remember the baby is your own!  mostly everything can be refused if you <br/>

 Susan<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The state can NOT compel you to test your child.  ALL vaccinations are <br/>
optional - but they DO put the pressure on.  The &quot;24 hour&quot; test is the PKU <br/>
(probably)  it is routinely done in a hospital, but it is NOT effective in <br/>
determining if your child has a PKU problem. (blood disorder) until the baby <br/>
is about 2 weeks old.  The hospital is &quot;required&quot; to test for PKU, and they <br/>
do it routinely before sending baby home just in case the parents do not come <br/>
back for their 2 week check up.  <br/>
<br/>
You are the parent, you can ALWAYS refuse whatever tests you do not want the <br/>
child to have.  ALWAYS.  Unfortunately, the medical establishment in general <br/>
usually puts so much pressure on parents, and they state &quot;hospital policy&quot; <br/>
etc.  so that parents don&#39;t make waves.  If you ever have a doctor or nurse <br/>
INSIST upon tests as &quot;legally we must&quot; - please tell them that they will need <br/>
to speak to your attorney about those tests, and that you will be taking your <br/>
baby home now.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you feel comfortable with all the &quot;musts&quot;, then disregard the <br/>
above. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-410833118">I am tempted to say tell them to (expletive deleted) but just to reinforce Mary&#39;s<br/>
observations in most circumstances simply, firmly saying no will do.  There are<br/>
extreme circumstances where hospitals will get court orders etc. but these are<br/>
rare.  They wanted to do PKU on our baby we said no we&#39;d do it at home with the<br/>
midwife.  They wanted to do antibiotic eye drops and we refused.  We were abused<br/>
for our refusal but that is par for the course and (more expletives deleted<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127935615">I must be the only one on this list who feels this way, which wouldn&#39;t be a<br/>
first, but I was happy to stay in the hospital for the first 24 hours, but NO<br/>
more.  Those beds tend to make your body hurt after a while!! Like it doesn&#39;t<br/>
hurt already!<br/>
<br/>
I liked being waited on hand and foot! :-)  I had a great group of nurses who<br/>
were totally concerned with what I wanted.  With my first I was 19 and clueless<br/>
so I needed to stay to receive the help and advice.  With my 2nd I was happy to<br/>
get home and get on with caring for the baby my way and feel comfortable.  And I<br/>
only had a 5 yr old around, who was excited to see his sister.  But when I had<br/>
the last one, I had a 7 yr old, my step-daughter (5) and my 2 year old, who was<br/>
too excited to maul her baby sister!  The older ones weren&#39;t a problem but<br/>
Cheyenne was extremely attached to me and having a baby to compete with made her<br/>
a little anxious!<br/>
<br/>
Also, with all of my births I&#39;m glad I chose the hospital.  I had complications<br/>
with all.  With the first two, their heart rates were dropping severly and I was<br/>
only given 15 minutes to push or they were going to go C.  I also was given<br/>
oxygen with both, was given demoral (sp?) with my first (what a waste, didn&#39;t<br/>
help a bit!) and had to lay down to deliver my 2nd, what a pain!!!  Totally<br/>
screwed up my back! It turned out that she had the cord around her neck twice.<br/>
But with my 3rd, I believe bc of tons of prayer beforehand, I was able to sit up<br/>
in a rocking chair and rock through the contractions, which were extremely<br/>
painful, due to too much petocin (sp?).  (My contractions weren&#39;t strong enough,<br/>
and I was 2 weeks late.)  I also was able to get on my knees facing the back of<br/>
the bed to push.  What a blessing!  Especially bc she was sooooo big<br/>
(9lbs10-1/2oz)!  But she came out blue and not breathing.  My mother-in-law<br/>
totally lost it!  She started breathing and surprise, surprise, after thinking<br/>
for 9 months we were having a boy, she turned out to be a girl!!!  And a very<br/>
healthy one at that.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s my experience with childbirth, hospitals and medication.<br/>

&lt;&lt; For those of you who were released from the hospital inless than 24<br/>
 hours,   How? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Before the last one (homebirth) the previous two I didn&#39;t use an obstetrician <br/>
I went with our General Practitioner.  I had the 3rd child and said okay I <br/>
want to go home.  He asked that I stay at least 4 hours so he could check <br/>
blood pressure etc.  <br/>
<br/>
On the 4th one my GP was on vacation.  They only available remotely similar <br/>
doctor was a young intern...  I had her, said I wanted to go home do the <br/>
paperwork, he oh no you have to stay at least 24 hours.  I told him no <br/>
thanks, do the paperwork or I&#39;d ignore it and go home anyway.  They called my <br/>
GP on vacation &lt;g&gt;, his response was send her home.<br/>
<br/>
Midwives are VERY good about explaining tests and telling you that there are <br/>
options.  My 4 month old hasn&#39;t had any immunizations, and won&#39;t until at <br/>
least age two.  I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d recommend a midwife with a first birth, <br/>
but I&#39;d sure mention it, most first time mothers are a bit to scared to walk <br/>
away from the *professionals*.<br/>
<br/>
But, I&#39;m 43, I&#39;ve had a lot of practice with the medical professionals and <br/>
kids.  I don&#39;t do specialist unless absolutely necessary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-451657465">It&#39;s true you as a parent have the *right* to refuse treatment.....however,<br/>
as I stated in my earlier post,  it&#39;s often quite a challenge to have this<br/>
right respected.  My dd was forced to have a test which I adamantly and<br/>
repeatedly refused.  I finally begged them to at least wait until I could<br/>
confer with my family physician OR the head of the peds dept,  who would<br/>
come in the a.m.  The nurse basically waited until I snoozed off for about a<br/>
half hour,  then brought the lab person in to do the test.  they started<br/>
this test and refused to stop when I awoke and requested it.  turns out the<br/>
nurse wrote a note to the lab saying I agreed to do it at that time (around<br/>
5 a.m.,  when we were not even settled in the room until after 1 a.m.).<br/>
    I only managed to get her out of one unnecessary test.....that&#39;s because<br/>
I had a chance to talk with the head of Peds when he did his daily review.<br/>
he agreed with me to cancel the other ordered test.  here again,  a lab<br/>
person came in expecting to do the test and we had to call the head of peds<br/>
to &#39;confirm&#39; that my refusal was &#39;ok&#39;!!?!  later,  a lab person returned to<br/>
try and do one test over (the 5 a.m. one) becuse it hadn&#39;t<br/>
&#39;taken&#39;.........GRRRRRRR!!!!!<br/>
    Joel,  I appreciate your &#39;inside&#39; perspective.  I have had a bit of a<br/>
look at the inside when I worked for a hospice a few yrs ago (social work).<br/>
At any rate,  I was all to aware of the sad state of hospital medical<br/>
practice.....not a good place for a sick person!!!<br/>
Susan<br/>
who is grateful to have a place to be heard on this....looks like i&#39;m<br/>
building a soapbox to stand on;  I&#39;ll try to control myself ;-)<br/>

My daughter (age 19) never received the Hep B  vaccine because they weren&#39;t <br/>

pushing the vaccine for to &quot;catch up.&quot;   I&#39;m always leary of new <br/>

to his records,  he has had it,  but I know he hasn&#39;t.   I think when <br/>
I transferred his medical records here, they marked the HiB shot in <br/>
the Hep B spot.  That&#39;s scary in and of itself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066573530">sometimes its hard to see the forest for the trees....<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m glad I chose the hospital....&gt;&gt;  THEN...  &lt;&lt;I was only given 15 minutes <br/>
to push or they were going to go C... was given demoral with my first (what a <br/>
waste, didn&#39;t<br/>
help a bit!)... had to lay down to deliver my 2nd, what a pain!!!... too much <br/>
pitocin...&gt;&gt;<br/>
(emphasis mine)<br/>
<br/>
every one&#39;s birth experience is valid and you can choose to take from it what <br/>
you want.  you were perhaps in true emergency situations and the hospital <br/>
might have saved lives!  yet, many times one intervention leads to another <br/>
which can put women in more and more vulnerable situations!   birth is a <br/>
normal happening and in most cases there would be no complications if let be. <br/>
 yet from hospital births how often do we hear about this or that going <br/>
wrong?  they become minor things when compared to losing a life, which is the <br/>
fear.  and so, parents are left feeling indebted to the hospital when it at <br/>
times was more a part of the cause...<br/>
<br/>
not so much your personal situation (which i do not judge) but it reminded me <br/>
that many times over i&#39;ve heard similar stories and am reflecting that it <br/>
could be better out there.... more advocacy from within for the normalness of <br/>
birth, etc...<br/>

Swedish Medical and she HAD to have it as a condition of employment.  It&#39;s <br/>
probably necessary for her though due to possible blood contamination. <br/>
<br/>
France has dropped the mandatory requirement for this vaccine.  Also, <br/>
Australia put out an interesting report a few weeks ago stating that they <br/>
believe that they could reduce the crib death rates by 50% if infant <br/>
vaccinations were stopped.<br/>

&quot;Independent analysis of raw computer data generated by the <br/>
government-operated Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) confirms <br/>
that in 1996, there were 872 serious adverse events reported to VAERS in <br/>
children under 14 years of age who had been injected with hepatitis B <br/>
vaccine. The children were either taken to a hospital emergency room, had <br/>
life threatening health problems, were hospitalized or were left disabled <br/>
following vaccination. 214 of the children had received hepatitis B vaccine <br/>
alone and the rest had received hepatitis B vaccine in combination with other <br/>
vaccines. 48 children were reported to have died after they were injected <br/>
with hepatitis B vaccine in 1996 and 13 of them had received hepatitis B <br/>
vaccine only before their deaths. By contrast, in 1996 only 279 cases of <br/>
hepatitis B disease were reported in children under age 14. &quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-46218410">I would recommend that no one unless they are in a high risk category e.g.. injection<br/>
drug user, health care worker, and such like take the hep. B vaccine. Why.  I would<br/>
certainly strongly advise against children taking it.  I think great caution with all<br/>
of the vaccines is justified.   If I were traveling to high risk areas I might<br/>
consider some vaccinations but beyond that I am very cautious.  I am vaccinated for<br/>
Hep B because I am a nurse who has often worked with patients who use injection drugs<br/>
and have other risk factors.<br/>
<br/>
This is non-expert advice just a my opinion.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Speaking of vaccinations:  I would avoid Hep B vaccinations for children.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; believe it is a pharmaceutical driven campaign which has the interests of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; bottom line far ahead any possible public health benefits. I am not keen on most<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Would you make this recommendation for all ages of children, Joel, or<br/>
&gt; just for young children?<br/>
&gt; My daughter (age 19) never received the Hep B  vaccine because they weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; giving it yet.  Now my son (13) is in the age group that they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; pushing the vaccine for to &quot;catch up.&quot;   I&#39;m always leary of new<br/>
&gt; vaccines and so we haven&#39;t gotten this one yet.  Actually, according<br/>
&gt; to his records,  he has had it,  but I know he hasn&#39;t.   I think when<br/>
&gt; I transferred his medical records here, they marked the HiB shot in<br/>
&gt; the Hep B spot.  That&#39;s scary in and of itself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-6626514">In spades! the number of interventions which result in more interventions is<br/>
enormous. Situations which have formerly been handled successfully (e.g. a wide<br/>
variety of breech presentations) are now medical emergencies in part because the<br/>
skills which formerly were learned to deal with them have been abandoned. A<br/>
c-section for breech presentations is the current solution when skillful turning<br/>
of the baby was formerly done by skilled practitioners.  Induction is now done<br/>
for a variety of feeble reasons as often as it is done for genuine life<br/>
threatening emergencies.<br/>
<br/>
It is also impossible to know in any given situation how the birth would have<br/>
turned out if nature had been encouraged instead of thwarted.  People tally up<br/>
the failed home births while ignoring the rotten outcomes of hospital birth.  The<br/>
significance of the initial connection between mother and babe is played down.<br/>
Fortunately hospital nurseries are becoming the relics they ought to be.  Even<br/>
preemies do better when they are handled and kept in close contact with a real<br/>
person.<br/>
<br/>
The same forces which prevent us or at least dissuade us from looking<br/>
realistically at our parents come in to effect when looking at what we do to our<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in any given individual instant people are doing the best they can  but<br/>
it behooves us to look at the larger picture if we really want to change things<br/>
for the better.  There is a rational role for medicine in birthing but it is very<br/>
small.<br/>
<br/>
The vested interests of various groups e.g. hospitals, doctors, pharmaceutical<br/>
companies, insurance companies  et. al. have to be examined to understand what is<br/>
really going on.<br/>
<br/>
I have really gotten terribly chatty of late.  I think unsubscribing from other<br/>
lists has just focused my talk-talk here. Seems to be what everybody&#39;s got....<br/>

&gt; every one&#39;s birth experience is valid and you can choose to take from it what<br/>
&gt; you want.  you were perhaps in true emergency situations and the hospital<br/>
&gt; might have saved lives!  yet, many times one intervention leads to another<br/>
&gt; which can put women in more and more vulnerable situations!   birth is a<br/>
&gt; normal happening and in most cases there would be no complications if let be.<br/>
&gt;  yet from hospital births how often do we hear about this or that going<br/>
&gt; wrong?  they become minor things when compared to losing a life, which is the<br/>
&gt; fear.  and so, parents are left feeling indebted to the hospital when it at<br/>
&gt; times was more a part of the cause...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; not so much your personal situation (which i do not judge) but it reminded me<br/>
&gt; that many times over i&#39;ve heard similar stories and am reflecting that it<br/>
&gt; could be better out there.... more advocacy from within for the normalness of<br/>

small example I gave in reference to things we wish had gone differently,<br/>

just to offer an example.  When I really want to whine, you&#39;ll know it! :))<br/>
<br/>
This kind of topic gets me so excited because it gets into critical<br/>
discourse analysis, a favorite pastime of mine (I didn&#39;t make up the term;<br/>
it&#39;s British and a kind of hybrid of sociolinguistics, dramaturgy, and<br/>
ethnography...)  There&#39;s some Foucault in this too, of course, at base.<br/>
<br/>
CDA is about picking apart the relationship between the investments and<br/>
powerplays that drive and weight dialogue in almost any situation, line by<br/>
line, pause by pause, and gesture by gesture.  Dealing with doctors is a<br/>
prime situation for fun with CDA, because they know that they have *quasi*<br/>
legal power (and my mother was a doctor, I have lots of doctors in my<br/>
family, *but still*, or maybe *and so*!), and even more, they deal with<br/>
people at the *most* vulnerable moments of life.<br/>
<br/>
Any interaction with anyone claiming to be a medical professional thus<br/>
starts off totally and almost laughably slanted in their direction;  even if<br/>
they were to say something like &quot;We must bleed you&quot;, the average person<br/>
would lie back and accept the correctness and inevitability of being bled.<br/>
Not that all medical advice is this wrong, of course.  Just by way of<br/>
example of the weight of the authority that doctors wield.  And not only the<br/>
words doctors say, but the lack of listening to patients, interruption<br/>
(someone else mentioned this stuff too), body language, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Police, too--basically any member of any official institution.  Like the<br/>
state schooling apparatus.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, don&#39;t get me started.  But I just thought I&#39;d mention that the name of<br/>
the person who came up with critical discourse analysis is Norman<br/>
Fairclough, in case anyone wants to read some really entertaining, if<br/>
somewhat academic, detailed picking apart of the dynamics of language and<br/>
power...<br/>
