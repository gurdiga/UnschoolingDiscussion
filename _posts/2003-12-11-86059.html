       Not a detractor.  <br/>

       Not a rhetorical device.  <br/>

       Not a straw man. <br/>

&gt; If unschooling isn&#39;t better or best, let&#39;s disband the group and go and do <br/>
&gt; what we think IS best.   If I didn&#39;t think unschooling wasn&#39;t a better <br/>

More interesting rhetoric.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d much rather you would talk about your own unschooling thoughts and <br/>
experiences than talk about me, or about what you hypothetically  might think about <br/>
things that haven&#39;t happened.<br/>
