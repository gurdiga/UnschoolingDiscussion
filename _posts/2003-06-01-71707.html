low but his vocabulary knowledge was well into 6th grade (their tests show <br/>
grade levels).<br/>
So while he didn&#39;t read well out loud the time he had been home brought his <br/>
voc up several years. This was the beginning this &quot;school year&quot; so I would <br/>
imagine the scores have advanced greatly without their suggested 800 hours of paid <br/>
torturing. Something like 5000.00 I think they said it would cost for them to <br/>
do what he did on his own and he no longer &quot;feels&quot; stupid as he used to say.<br/>

&gt; OMG Kathryn!!! LMAO I was just taking the last big gulp of coffee when I <br/>
&gt; started to read your post and ta-da, coffee went everywhere. So is he still <br/>
&gt; downstairs?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, he actually wasn&#39;t downstairs for a long time (we split before Julian <br/>
was 2, and he is 13 now), but two years ago Perry (Julian&#39;s dad), Beth (my <br/>
partner) and I bought a two family house together. Perry lives on the first floor, <br/>
and Beth, Julian and I have the second and third floors.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously we&#39;re very good friends, but we have had some difficult times. But <br/>
he spends more dedicated time with his kid, and always had, than most <br/>
non-divorced fathers. He focuses one on one time for at least two-three hours with <br/>
Julian almost every day.  And Julian does not remeber a time when Beth hasn&#39;t <br/>
also been a parent. So he&#39;s got a good ratio: one kid to three doting parents. He <br/>
really should be pretty bratty and spoiled. LOL<br/>

I really enjoy hearing of any couples who split and are able to be civil to<br/>
each other, especially when children are involved. I really do envy that.<br/>
Good for all of you!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kathryn!!! This is so awesome. I congratulate you and your partner and your <br/>
ex-hubby in this move. No kid can have too many people love them. My hubby just <br/>
got home and wanted the latest on this weekends threads. I opened yours right <br/>
when we started talking about viewpoints. He thinks you all are so awesome. <br/>
Julian is one lucky kid!!!<br/>
