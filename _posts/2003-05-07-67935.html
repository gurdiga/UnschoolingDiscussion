<div id="ygrps-yiv-802778424">I forgot to mention Lionel&#39;s Traintown as a computer game. You can build<br/>
your own train layouts and run all sorts of trains on them. They also have<br/>
more &quot;schoolish&quot; things like train games that feature math, matching games,<br/>
etc. All of it is done with trains. Both of my kids play like this CD-Rom,<br/>
but if grandpa (a bonafide train fiend) comes over, he might take over the<br/>
computer :-)<br/>
