<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292855432">It just struck me that successful breastfeeding seems like it might be <br/>
a good predictor of later success with education choices that are more <br/>
individual and family-oriented than plain old &quot;school.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
       Has there been any investigation of this idea, research findings <br/>
published or even thought given to it, that anyone here knows of?<br/>
<br/>
       I don&#39;t mean to suggest one won&#39;t be able to unschool without having <br/>
breast-fed.<br/>
<br/>
       What I mean is only that if there&#39;s a real correlation, knowing about <br/>
it could be a great way to find and support more people in unschooling. We <br/>
could make ourselves visible, helpful and accessible for moms who, by their <br/>
successful breastfeeding, establish themselves early on as likely to be well-suited <br/>
to unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
       I&#39;m not thinking of a recruitment drive &lt;g&gt; -- but for parents and <br/>
children likely to appreciate unschooling anyway, eventually, wouldn&#39;t it be <br/>
wonderful if we could help acquaint them with it more seamlessly, without all the <br/>
stumbling around and possibly wasted opportunities some of us endured first, <br/>
or the dulling and damage of school experiences that are less likely to be <br/>
right for them than for the &quot;average&quot; family.<br/>
<br/>
       I&#39;m just throwing it out for thought. If there really is a <br/>
correlation, it would seem to make sense, as positive outreach.<br/>

&gt; overlapping groups. It&#39;s amazing how much I still get out of LL meetings even though <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m no longer nursing. The attachment parenting part of it just goes way <br/>
&gt; beyond nursing, and I&#39;ve found that unschooling is so much a continuation of that <br/>
&gt; philosophy in our lives. I&#39;m hoping to become a leader, too, this year.<br/>
