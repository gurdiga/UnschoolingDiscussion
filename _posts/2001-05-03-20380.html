I&#39;ll reply to your email asap.  <br/>
I did not work when Laurie was young (or old). I was fortunate in <br/>
that her father had a great job that allowed me to stay home with <br/>
her. I did babysit other kids while she was young though. I was <br/>
married. <br/>
My own life revolved around Laurie because that is the way I wanted <br/>
it to be. I did have other pursuits, but she was there with me. I <br/>
gardened organically, sewed, cooked healthfoods (which we all know is <br/>
more time-consuming) read, and kept the house as clean as possible <br/>
while babysitting.<br/>
She enjoyed being right by my side while she was young, but by the <br/>
time she was six she was more into spending time alone. Books <br/>
were/are her best friends. She&#39;s a bookaholic! which I encouraged of <br/>
course.<br/>
It&#39;s a bit hard to tell the difference between our pursuits. She WAS <br/>
my pursuit. Everything else came second. <br/>
<br/>
If I need to clarify anything let me know. :-)  Valerie<br/>

I started college at age 43 with Laurie. I found that all I wanted to <br/>
do was write, although the classes with her were a hoot...but then <br/>
everything I do with her is a hoot!<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>
