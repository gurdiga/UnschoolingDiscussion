<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749369307">I agree with you wholeheartedly.  This is basically the message I was<br/>
trying to get across but ended up every which way but loose...<br/>
I do have a concern, however, when it comes to my 5-yo grandson who was<br/>
diagnosed with ADHD.  Now, I know I&#39;m going to raise some antennae, but<br/>
let me just say here and now that I know how often this blanket diagnosis<br/>
is applied to kids -- the school system tried to apply it to my son<br/>
James.  I wasn&#39;t about to buy into it one bit, but even though I trusted<br/>
my own experiences with James, I felt it couldn&#39;t hurt to check it out<br/>
with my brother who is the area&#39;s acknowledged expert on ADHD.  Anyway,<br/>
my grandson&#39;s behavior was something different entirely.  He was most<br/>
definitely out of control -- unable to settle himself down, particularly<br/>
in &quot;stimuating&quot; environments -- preschool being one of them.  He was<br/>
literally bouncing off walls.  As adamantly opposed as I am to meds for<br/>
kids, I, of course, had to accept my daughter&#39;s decision to at least try<br/>
medication.  The difference is amazing.  This child can now sit and<br/>
color, can play Legos, etc., activities he couldn&#39;t engage in before for<br/>
more than a few minutes at best.  He notices how he feels &quot;different&quot;<br/>
now.  He&#39;s not drugged out, his personality is unchanged, etc.; he&#39;s just<br/>
calmer and is able to focus.  In my grandson&#39;s case, my daughter has been<br/>
encouraged to use behavior mod (not with food, of course) -- praising him<br/>
whenever he&#39;s focused, etc., since as effective as the medication might<br/>
be, nothing really happens long-term without &quot;training&quot; the brain..  But,<br/>
I&#39;m not the expert, and although, as I mentioned, my brother is, I&#39;m more<br/>
comfortable hearing about people&#39;s own personal experiences with this<br/>
issue.  If I&#39;m forgiven, may I have some feedback on the ADHD issue.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I&#39;m glad to see you have not given up hope on the list yet, as your previous <br/>
post seemed to indicate. Please understand that this group is not the <br/>
standard, all inclusive type, that a lot of Yahoo groups tend to be. Rather, this is a <br/>
group of ecclectic thinkers, people who can&#39;t stand thinking inside the box <br/>
and more than anything put their children above and beyond everything else that <br/>
exists. Some people have always unschooled, some have found it later than <br/>
they would have liked, but were just glad to find that such a way of life exists <br/>
outside their own homes. It is not just about school though. Rather it is <br/>
about living life and the knowledge one gains by enjoying that life. All of us <br/>
have different points of view, but what you must understand about this group is <br/>
that whatever topic you choose to post, you WILL get feedback and often the <br/>
outlooks will vary. My only caution to you is to not take what responses you get <br/>
as personal attacks. More often than not, when we are defensive, it is because <br/>
one side or the other is not fully comprehending what is being pointed out at <br/>
the request of the original poster. Being unschoolers is hard enough to <br/>
explain to other homeschoolers, the last thing anyone here wants to do is argue our <br/>
choices. <br/>
<br/>
As for the whole ADHD/ADD argument, I am well versed but frankly not in the <br/>
mood for it this afternoon. That does not mean that I will not be responding it <br/>
simply means I will contemplate my response if I choose to end up talking <br/>
about the condition. The saddest thing about this as a condition is that so often <br/>
even the &quot;experts&quot; are wrong. Sadly I think far too many parents take the <br/>
easy road out by going the drug route, just because some expert says so. Then <br/>
there are kids who are misdiagnosed completely from day one, are then put on drug <br/>
therapies that don&#39;t work and these kids are tossed to the side as not being <br/>
worthy of education.<br/>
<br/>

comtemplation.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You mean that my example was illustrative of a highly destructive <br/>
behavior - the dots being given out for the kids staying on task, <br/>
right? That was the point. The thing is - these manipulations DO work, <br/>
temporarily and briefly. They don&#39;t work for what we want in the long <br/>
run - they don&#39;t help kids develop intrinsic motivation, for example, <br/>
but they quiet down the class, for a while. From a classroom teacher&#39;s <br/>
point of view - that&#39;s &quot;working,&quot; I guess. Sad.<br/>
