<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853086570"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Those in service positions are expected to use it here: restaurant wait <br/>

Generally<br/>
lawyers use it with their clients and clients with their lawyers. Ditto with<br/>
doctors and policemen. Judges get it from *everybody*! &lt;g&gt;  Teachers tend to <br/>
let<br/>
you know what they expect: those that &quot;ain&#39;t from around here&quot; tend to let <br/>
it<br/>
slide.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
So only doctors and lawyers are deserving of the recepricated respect, not <br/>
lower class service people?<br/>
There is a saying about how you can tell alot about a person by how they <br/>
treat their server<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Fraternization is NOT just in the military. I enforced it when we had a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>restaurant. As manager, I didn&#39;t associate with my waitstaff (although we <br/>
were<br/>
very friendly). My brother DID---he&#39;d go out and get drunk and party with <br/>
the<br/>
staff. They lost a lot of respect for him when they&#39;d see him at his <br/>
worst.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I own a restaurant and we have not found socializing with our <br/>
employees to be a problem. Some of our ex employees are very good friends <br/>
still (Jade and I just played pictionary with two of them last night) and <br/>
many of our new employees stay for an hour or so after work to socialize <br/>
with us and each other. We encourage eating together and open communication. <br/>
I agree that their are people who I would have to be careful around in the <br/>
sense that they are not very good employees and I need to be more <br/>
authoritarian but for the most part all of our employees do a great job.<br/>
When I hire them it is made quite clear that I have no problem firing people <br/>
for not helping my business (I have fired a best friend, who is still a <br/>
friend, my sil, and my nephew) and they know that no matter how much I like <br/>
them personally, I will fire them if they are not doing what needs to be <br/>
done.<br/>
The only line I feel I need to draw is what is for the best interest of the <br/>
business.<br/>
btw My long term employee would tell me what needs to be done if I wasn&#39;t <br/>
pulling my weight and expect that I take care of it just like I would do to <br/>
them. They give me ideas for improving my business that I wouldn&#39;t have come <br/>
up with myself and my business wouldn&#39;t be as great as it is today without <br/>
the relationships that I have built with the people who work with us.<br/>
<br/>
Just my different perspective on relationships in business from my personal <br/>
experience.<br/>
