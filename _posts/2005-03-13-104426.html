<div id="ygrps-yiv-26221872">we met at the Wild Bird Center and drove out to Antelope Island. <br/>
Katie and I. KATIE...my natural born night owl, who can&#39;t get up <br/>
before noon. RIIIIIGHT. And she was even up late last night, but <br/>
still somehow managed to get up when I stirred her at 9:00 am. We <br/>
were on the road by 9:30, met the group by 10, and were peering at <br/>
water birds through scopes, looking at bison on the hillsides, and <br/>
some antelope bounding through the tall yellow grasses in the <br/>
distance. <br/>
<br/>
In the interior of the island there is an old farm. It seems to be <br/>
the destination for scout troops and field trips, etc. It was our <br/>
ending point today, and while there we saw the nest where a barn owl <br/>
resides. Didn&#39;t see him, but we did pick up owl pellets off the <br/>
floor. No one else seemed so interested in mine, which has the teeth <br/>
and looks like ribs of, a vole most likely. It&#39;s in a ziploc on the <br/>
table, waiting for someone to get interested enough to pick it apart. <br/>
Or not.<br/>
<br/>
We walked around the farm a bit, while our guide pointed out a tree <br/>
full of pine siskins and goldfinches, which made both Katie and me <br/>
remember the thistle seed feeder we had on the back deck in Idaho, <br/>
that the siskins and goldfinches loved so much. The chickens also had <br/>
us longing for our country place a bit. But the friendliness of the <br/>
people around us more than made up for the friends we left behind.<br/>
<br/>
The group went down towards the marsh on the edge of the farm, where <br/>
one experienced member of the group spotted an OWL! It was a male <br/>
long eared owl, and he had gone into &quot;camouflage&quot; mode, :pulling <br/>
himself up very tall and narrow, and holding extremely still. Usually <br/>
an eared owl will set itself flush against the tree trunk and REALLY <br/>
go invisible, but this guy was out from the trunk a foot or so, and <br/>
he was amazing. That is the first owl I&#39;ve ever seen, though I&#39;ve <br/>
heard many. His eyes were round and yellow with big black pupils, and <br/>
his feathers, through the viewing scope, looked so soft. Just Amazing!<br/>
<br/>
After lunch, we went to the library, where Katie picked up a Star <br/>
Wars DVD about Episode III and many books on tape. We listened <br/>
to &quot;Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher&quot; in the van on the way home. I <br/>
picked up a half dozen books on Feng Shui.<br/>
<br/>
while us girls had been out &quot;amateur naturalist-ing&quot; the men of the <br/>
family, and the Young Woman, had spent a lazy day watching TV and <br/>
lounging in a nest of sleeping bags and blankets, or the couch, or <br/>
the easy chairs. <br/>
<br/>
right now, the two younger kids are digging a hole in the side yard, <br/>
and sifting dirt and rocks through my yellow one-handed noodle <br/>
strainer, oldest daughter is at the theatre being a Servant Girl <br/>
Extra, and hubby is watching something on TV.<br/>
<br/>
I want to see what the little diggers have unearthed.<br/>
<br/>
bye!<br/>
<br/>
Heidi who saw an OWL today!</div>

If you need a chart to help you figure out what the bones might be, <br/>
