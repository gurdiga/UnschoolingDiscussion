<br/>
weaving on dads invented looms, <br/>
sewing, <br/>
piano, self taught<br/>
gardening<br/>
roofing<br/>
installed insulation<br/>
Spanish (learned in my community)<br/>
cooking<br/>
 let me think what else<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in Uvalde Texas.  Mostly agricultural, two radio programs, the crop report, and La Rancherita del aire.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up without Rock n roll, so my hubby makes fun of me, I don&#39;t know jack what happened in pop culture from &#39;60s and 70&#39;s.  sorry, grew up in a time vacuum, dad did not allow tv from 1980 - 1983., teen years  no tv<br/>
<br/>
did not get color tv until 1983.<br/>
so all tv was film noir to me, until &#39;83<br/>
I didn&#39;t even know Star Trek, my favorite childhood tv show was in color until 76 when I went to aunties house., amazing huh.<br/>
<br/>
lets do the time warp again, take a step to the right....do do...monica m<br/>
