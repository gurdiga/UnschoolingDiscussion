<div id="ygrps-yiv-514855412">Try saying &quot;horsestick&quot; aloud.  all one word.. It sounds like Horse dick.    <br/>
My 3 yo daugther wanted one.. she got on.. she talked about her horsestick <br/>
all the time.. how mch she loved it.. how she loved to ride it.  yeah, its <br/>
pretty crude.. but I swear, it was funny around here..  She just got Stick <br/>
horse mixed up and called it a horsestick.  .. Imagine, in the dept store.. <br/>
LOOK Momma , lookk.. a horsestick!  a horsestick!.   Hey, heres something <br/>
else funny.  (  I probably told you guys this before)  My oldest son Landon <br/>
bought a girl friend of his ( platonic) a pink stick horse for Christmas.  <br/>
They buy each other sort of gag gifts that are remniscent of thier childhood. <br/>
 She loved pretty little pony, hence the frilly, singing stick horse gift.  <br/>
Landon wrote her a card. Jessica,  your very own horsestick to ride whenever <br/>
you please.. .What a hoot.. Jessica LOVED it.  She bought Landon a LOTR <br/>
clanking sword.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-555374581">OK, I am just a little slow.  I kept saying it in my head, but it just<br/>
sounded like horse stick.  Guess I should have ventured to say it outloud!<br/>
LOL  That really is funny!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555870096">Well, it would never have occured to us.. the sound of saying it &quot;backward&quot;  <br/>
but when she said it.. it sounded EXACTLY like . . well.. like it sounds.. <br/>
lol.   Anna has always been &quot;backwards&quot; with her words.. Its been a constant <br/>
( good natured) joke around here .. Hmm. let me see if I can think of some <br/>
others.  She told me her preschool teacher&#39;s name was money.. it took me a <br/>
while to remember her name was Penny.. lol.. She used to say her pants were <br/>
&quot;driving&quot; up her butt, inside of &quot;riding&quot; up her butt..She used to recite a <br/>
blessing before dinner. &quot;Come Lord Jesus, be our guest, put our service to <br/>
the test&quot;  ( that last line mixed up from Beauty and the Beast.. it should <br/>
have been , let this food to us be blessed) Then as she got older, her flubs <br/>
were even more funny.. A couple of years ago, she took me aside and told me <br/>
in all seriousness that uncle Kyle&#39;s pants made him look like he had an <br/>
erosion.  LMAO!!.. I about DIED.. OH GOD, it was so freaking funny.. because <br/>
he DID look kind of like an idiot in these spandex/lycra bike shorts that had <br/>
a padded crotch.. AND because Anna had obviously made a connection from our <br/>
recent discussions of boys getting erections and Kyles &quot;erosion&quot;  Whew wee.. <br/>
Then, one night we talked about renting Children of the Corn, it was one of <br/>
the first horror movies that dh and I saw together.. The rental store didnt <br/>
have the first one.. but we got some of the sequels.. Anna asked later.. &#39;are <br/>
we going to watch that Corn Kids movie&quot;    She does this kind of thing all of <br/>
the time.. its really endearing. She is such a sweet, smart girl.. its funny <br/>
to hear her get her words mixed up.   We dont laught AT her.. but we sure do <br/>
laugh WITH her.<br/>

The famous example used in linguistics classes, when people are writing <br/>
sounds out phonetically is this:<br/>
<br/>
cat shit<br/>
and <br/>
catch it<br/>
are notated the same way.  You get them from context when they&#39;re spoken.<br/>
