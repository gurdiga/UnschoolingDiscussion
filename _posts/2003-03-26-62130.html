<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096775507"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Maybe a &quot;wait list&quot; for when an item is in big demand. That way they know <br/>
&gt;&gt;they&#39;ll get a turn and it won&#39;t be forgotten.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can you elaborate?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m talking about when everyone&#39;s waiting for the computer or TV. You make <br/>
an actual list, like they have in restaurants when you&#39;re waiting for a <br/>
table. Put down the child&#39;s name as the next one to use the computer or pick <br/>
the TV program. There&#39;s a lot of power in knowing you are &quot;next.&quot;  I would <br/>
also try to distract or play ar pay attention to the one who&#39;s really having <br/>
a hard time waiting. Make that time fun.<br/>
<br/>
Your little 3 year old will probably need you to be his advocate if there <br/>
are really shows he wants to watch. Or even if he just feels like he never <br/>
gets to pick and just wants a turn.<br/>
<br/>
Like you said, the first month or 3 of satellite is a BIG deal. The novelty <br/>
will wear off. It did in our house.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
~Mary<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green <br/>
earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly alive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
                      ~ Thich Nhat Hanh<br/>
