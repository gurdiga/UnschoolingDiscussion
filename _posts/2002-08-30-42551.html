<div id="ygrps-yiv-420298993">When I was a kid, my driver&#39;s ed class consisted of driving the high school<br/>
basketball coach over to the next town in the Texas Panhandle for donuts and<br/>
showing we could change a flat.<br/>
<br/>
However, my Dad was a driving instructor for the Texas Highway Patrol and<br/>
what he did was take the situations out of the book and place me in those<br/>
situations in real life.  Instead of simply trying to memorize that you<br/>
should be so many car lengths back from the car in front of you, he pointed<br/>
out that if I can see the road below the car stopped in front of me&#39;s back<br/>
bumper I am about 1 car length back.  Then we would get out of the car and<br/>
check it out.  Helped all the details stick.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
