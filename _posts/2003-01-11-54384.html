<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; His problem isn&#39;t with using the tools, but safely storing them.  What<br/>
&gt; kind of extra help could we offer him other than a reminder that tools<br/>
&gt; left out are unsafe?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, you could help him pick them up when he&#39;s done with them.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He&#39;s<br/>
&gt; a great kid, but impulse control and self-regulation aren&#39;t his strong<br/>
&gt; suit.  We couldn&#39;t make him be anything other than who he is if we tried.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>But you can help him learn to pick them up and put them away out of habit by<br/>
doing it with him, couldn&#39;t you?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We haven&#39;t offered &quot;our&quot; solutions or tried to control.  We have<br/>
&gt; simply asked him not to leave his tools where the little ones can get<br/>
&gt; to them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t remember how old the child in question is, but I don&#39;t know that his<br/>
age is necessarily relevant.<br/>
<br/>
However, your age and position in the household is relevant.  In the end,<br/>
it&#39;s your responsibility as the parent to protect the little ones.  Not his,<br/>
because he didn&#39;t choose to have little siblings.  I&#39;m sorry if that sounds<br/>
hard-core, or like doing something for him that you think he ought to be old<br/>
enough to do.  But the solution to him enjoying his tools and his siblings<br/>
being safe is you. <br/>

Thanks for the sites.  I&#39;ll check them out.<br/>
<br/>
Can you or Sandra tell me where to find &quot;Karl Bunday&quot;?  Sandra mentioned a<br/>
list of colleges that have accepted HSers.<br/>

Re: Idiot and Dummy books -  I have never thought the titles were that<br/>
great, but my husband loves them and has several.  Actually, the content is<br/>
often pretty good.<br/>
