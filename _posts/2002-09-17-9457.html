&lt;&lt;g&gt; I was going to suggest that Heather give her mom<br/>
John Holt books for every Christmas and birthday until<br/>
her mom &quot;gets it&quot;. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is funny, because she actually gave me &quot;How<br/>
children learn&quot; last year.  I guess I should give it<br/>
back to her & have her READ it! LOL<br/>
