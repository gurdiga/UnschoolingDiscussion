<div id="ygrps-yiv-951082480">It seems to me that one of the ideas talked about here is the <br/>
need to allow kids choices. We want them to be internally <br/>
motivated. We want them to not feel that there is a world of <br/>
wonderful attractive stuff out there that we are holding back from <br/>
them for their &quot;good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We want to make a safe place for growth, self-directed learning <br/>
and freedom to create without fear.<br/>
<br/>
I affirm all of this.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, one of the things that concerns me is that I  <br/>
hear women talking about children as though they are <br/>
little adults. Kids are notoriously poor at imagining future <br/>
outcomes. They don&#39;t always tie past behavior with present <br/>
results. (Sleep is an easy example of this, particularly with young <br/>
kids.) They often won&#39;t try something new (as in food) just based <br/>
on it&#39;s color. They often aren&#39;t conscious of other people&#39;s <br/>
possessions or even their own. (I&#39;m talking about young children <br/>
especially--under 10).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t fault them for this. I wouldn&#39;t demean them, spank them or <br/>
treat them condescendingly. But I would set some routines to <br/>
help them. And have. We&#39;ve always had a &quot;clean up after <br/>
yourself&quot; policy and I haven&#39;t given that up. I don&#39;t see that they <br/>
need to agree emotionally so much as to understand the <br/>
purpose of it. I see this as helping my kids get a picture of what it <br/>
means to contribute to how we run the house.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly I help them to put things away, I allow them to leave out <br/>
a game over a couple of day period if they are in the middle. I&#39;m <br/>
not talking about rigidity. I&#39;m talking about consideration for the <br/>
fact that seven people are sharing this space together.<br/>
<br/>
Another example:<br/>
<br/>
Setting a bedtime has helped my kids sleep well and spend the <br/>
next day in good spirits. If a child is surprisingly alert one night,<br/>
 I might suggest she page through a book until she sleeps, or I <br/>
might rube her back and sing to her. But having her in bed at <br/>
8:30 or 9:00 is important to her and to me, whether she totally <br/>
gets why or not. She is willing and that&#39;s because we take great <br/>
care in not laying a big burden of expectations on her in all her <br/>
other waking hours. It&#39;s just the routine.<br/>
<br/>
I read aloud to my younger ones around the same time each <br/>
day. I encourage my younger kids to sit with me for a chapter. <br/>
They can choose after that if they want to stay. They almost <br/>
always do. But sometimes at the outset, they haven&#39;t made the <br/>
mental transition to reading time and if I just left it to them, read <br/>
aloud time might not happen that day because our schedules <br/>
wouldn&#39;t synch up.<br/>
<br/>
So I tell them that at this time, I&#39;ll read to them and they are happy <br/>
to work around it. Do we occasionally skip? Of course. But <br/>
knowing when something is going to happen that is usually <br/>
pleasurable is actually a relief to several of my kids. They want to <br/>
count on something and look forward to it. I think this makes <br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
My middle two are asking for a routine and some accountability <br/>
for their goals because they like sharing the process and being <br/>
able to see themselves achieve their goals. My other three aren&#39;t <br/>
interested in that so they run their own gig. <br/>
<br/>
We do have our weekly routines for keeping the house clean and <br/>
the kids are continuing those.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m saying is that I can&#39;t imagine running a family of <br/>
seven where everything every day is up for grabs. (And really, I <br/>
am a very relaxed housekeeper compared to every other mom I <br/>
know. I am in no way anal about this stuff.) But  we all get along <br/>
better when there are empty spaces on tables for crafts, books <br/>
are where they should be, clothes are clean, dinnner happens <br/>
together every night and reading time is around the same time <br/>
daily.<br/>
<br/>
To me, these are routines that support our unschooling lifestyle. <br/>
I don&#39;t see them competing with it at all.<br/>
<br/>
I am inviting criticism or support. I&#39;m curious to know what others <br/>
think.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree with this in the first part. What I&#39;m wondering is though, that if <br/>
given enough time, it all evens out and the child is the one that discovers <br/>
it on his own. The whole possession thing I think is something that comes <br/>
with age. You just can&#39;t expect a 2 year old to care for things like an 8 <br/>
year old. But it doesn&#39;t last forever if handled in a way so that the child <br/>
isn&#39;t forced or made to feel &quot;bad&quot;. The sleep thing, I also wondering that <br/>
if people actually gave the child enough time, if they really would stay up <br/>
all night. Has anyone had a young child that they allowed to stay up every <br/>
night, without comment, still staying up all night long and cranky the next <br/>
day for more than a couple of weeks??? Around here it doesn&#39;t work that way, <br/>
the novelty wore of quick and my kids would crash. And when they are tired <br/>
and out of sorts the next day, they say so. If I would &quot;let&quot; them stay up <br/>
for 2-3 nights and then &quot;make&quot; them go to bed for a few more nights and then <br/>
let them stay up and so on, what does that really prove to them and what can <br/>
they possibly figure out for themselves. Sometimes inconvenience for parents <br/>
is worth it in the long run for the children. As far as not eating something <br/>
because of how it looks, so what? I&#39;ve done it too when something just <br/>
doesn&#39;t look right to me. I would hate for someone to try and convince me <br/>
otherwise on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But I would set some routines to help them. And have. We&#39;ve always had a <br/>
&quot;clean up after yourself&quot; policy and I haven&#39;t given that up. I don&#39;t see <br/>
that they need to agree emotionally so much as to understand the purpose of <br/>
it. I see this as helping my kids get a picture of what it means to <br/>

fact that seven people are sharing this space together.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I&#39;m very anal about housecleaning and neatness. I just try very hard <br/>
not to impose it on those around me!!! But with 6 of us here and dogs and <br/>
cats and friends around, I do need to have a certain look to my house. And I <br/>
do mean that &quot;I need&quot;. No one else is that concerned with it around here!! <br/>
There are times when I will actuall tell the kids that the look of a certain <br/>
room is upsetting me to look at and would they mind helping me neaten it up. <br/>
Of course this would be all their stuff, I would never ask this of the <br/>
kitchen or living room!!! I have never had any one of them (aside from the 2 <br/>
yo) tell me no. They understand that it is important to me and will help. <br/>
And I find that a certain look of their own rooms has become important to <br/>
them. Just not to the same degree as me, but then again, it&#39;s not my room.<br/>
<br/>
I do say most nights sometime before bed, I think it&#39;s clean up time, can <br/>
someone help me pick up the floor? This is only in the playroom because I <br/>
need to vacuum every night to get all the crumbs from the above said 2 yo&#39;s <br/>
breakfast, lunch and dinner. Again I always have help. Sometimes I ask <br/>
before their dessert time, sometimes after, it&#39;s just never rigid and not <br/>
always an every night thing. Some nights the floor stuff is few and I just <br/>
do it or my husband will. It&#39;s not a chore or a mandatory thing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We do have our weekly routines for keeping the house clean and<br/>
the kids are continuing those.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m saying is that I can&#39;t imagine running a family of<br/>

are where they should be, clothes are clean, dinnner happens<br/>
together every night and reading time is around the same time<br/>
daily.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree with a large family functioning better under those circumstances. I <br/>
just don&#39;t see it as needing chores or a schedule. My house is not up for <br/>
grabs either and it&#39;s pretty much always neat and always clean. Maybe it&#39;s <br/>
just the way one goes about it. In fact I do believe it is that very thing <br/>
that is most important. My kids probably don&#39;t even know what a chore is, <br/>
yet you would see them do things that I guess others would call chores. <br/>
(putting away their clothes, both dirty and clean, cleaning up, letting the <br/>
dogs in or out, etc) So again, I think it&#39;s the approach that is most <br/>
important.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This certainly may be true, but for a family with lots of small <br/>
children, it may be too taxing to the mother to wait to find out. In <br/>
our family, I&#39;ve noticed that creating patterns for things like <br/>
bedtime, meal times and clean up have been so much a part of <br/>
our lives that they aren&#39;t resentedthey are the assumed <br/>
lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
The whole possession thing I think is something that comes <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; with age. You just can&#39;t expect a 2 year old to care for things <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right! Which is why 2 yos don&#39;t play with older sister&#39;s china doll <br/>
to find out if she can &quot;handle&quot; it or not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But it doesn&#39;t last forever if handled in a way so that the child <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; isn&#39;t forced or made to feel &quot;bad&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is what I mean. I think we&#39;re dealing here more with how <br/>
parents go about creating an environment that is safe for kids to <br/>
express their feelings, desires, rebellions (yes, even these) and <br/>
more. I guess I get concerned when the tone of a discussion <br/>
sounds like there is a &quot;right&quot; way to be a family and it looks like <br/>
this: no bedtimes, eat whatever they want, never give them a <br/>
&quot;chore&quot; (as though the word itself is dangerous).<br/>
<br/>
Some of the women here have expressed that their kids don&#39;t <br/>
want to help when asked, are staying up very late and their <br/>
homes feel like chaos. To keep reminding them that the children <br/>
need to have a choice about it all puts them in a powerless <br/>
position in their own lives!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an example maybe some of you can relate to.<br/>
<br/>
I was in LLL for ten eyars as a leader. Sometimes (many times, <br/>
actually) I would encounter a mother of multiple kids who took <br/>
the LLL approach of attachment parenting to an extreme that <br/>
was damaging her family. Nursing all night long and not getting <br/>
sleep for herself, she felt cranky and tired during the day (the <br/>
mother). Holding the baby all day, the other kids started to resent <br/>
that their mother was always unavailable and attending to the <br/>
baby. But no pacifiers, no swings, no baby seats were allowed. <br/>
No cribs, no bassinets...<br/>
<br/>
You get the picture.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of mother after a couple of babies invariably gave up <br/>
this form of parenting by baby four. I&#39;ve seen it so many times. <br/>
They turn from total nurturing to scheduling and bottles, <br/>
nighttime &quot;cry-it-out&quot; systems and swear by them.<br/>
<br/>
I hated both kinds of parenting. <br/>
<br/>
To me, the goal of attachment parenting and on-demand nursing <br/>
was to provide babies with attentive care that would harmonize <br/>
with the family, not undermine it. <br/>
<br/>
For the mother who simply must read to her toddler and <br/>
vaccuum the floor because so much crap is on it, putting the <br/>
baby in a swing isn&#39;t going to harm the baby or the mother-baby <br/>
bond. Using a pacifier in car trips isn&#39;t a violation of <br/>
demand-feeding.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m concerned about here is that it seems like there <br/>
is a &quot;right way&quot; as in behavior rather than an attitude that is <br/>
deeply interested in the child and all his concerns. To me, <br/>
parents who are able to be attentive, who give options, who are <br/>
in dialog with their children will find lots of ways to conduct their <br/>
family lives and no two should be alike.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d much rather see a mother set up a daily time to pick up the <br/>
house and ask her kids to do it with her, than for her to become <br/>
so discouraged with their lack of participation and caring that <br/>
she ditches all the good stuff to be gained from this lifestyle and <br/>
ricochets into the old &quot;control&quot; view.<br/>
<br/>
Food:<br/>
 I&#39;ve done it too when something just <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; doesn&#39;t look right to me. I would hate for someone to try and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>convince me <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; otherwise on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;key words&quot; On a regular basis. But I have had my dh say to me, <br/>
&quot;Julie, you&#39;ve got to give this a try. It looks wretched, but it really is =<br/>
<br/>
good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There are times when I will actuall tell the kids that the look of a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>certain <br/>

 </span></blockquote>(aside from the 2 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; yo) tell me no. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me neither. But we&#39;ve lived this way since they were born. We <br/>
always pick up at five.<br/>
<br/>
For families who have either been highly controlling or who have <br/>
not ever had a routine in place, it may not work like this. I feel for <br/>
them! I don&#39;t think their kids will be damaged to simply let them <br/>
know what the routine of the house is going to be.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is really unhappy abuot it, why can&#39;t they dialog and <br/>
come up with an alternative plan that takes everyone&#39;s needs <br/>
into account? Why do we simply default to the child&#39;s, &quot;No I don&#39;t <br/>
want to.&quot; and then consider that the end of the discussion?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It&#39;s not a chore or a mandatory thing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is semantics. Ours is a habit and I think habits are <br/>
good. And we have exceptions when someone can&#39;t, doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to or needs a break.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that is most important. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here I would agree with you. I just don&#39;t like hearing that moms <br/>
feel overwhelmed and out of control in their own homes. I&#39;ve <br/>
seen too many burn-out and feel like failures for not attaining <br/>
some vision of an ideal that may even be twisted from what it <br/>
ought to be.<br/>

The choices are not just: mother sets daily time for clean up and <br/>
asks vs. house trashed and mom becomes complete control <br/>
freak. I know this as I live in one third choice myself.<br/>

I&#39;d rather see children go to school rather than be abused <br/>

I don&#39;t think anyone is saying that the parent shouldn&#39;t have any power,  there&#39;s a balance, a partnership; between parents and children.  But this balance and partnership takes time.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure it might take more time also when its a family of 8-10.  You have that many more people learning something new.<br/>

parents who are able to be attentive, who give options, who are <br/>
in dialog with their children will find lots of ways to conduct their <br/>
family lives and no two should be alike.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d much rather see a mother set up a daily time to pick up the <br/>
house and ask her kids to do it with her, than for her to become <br/>
so discouraged with their lack of participation and caring that <br/>
she ditches all the good stuff to be gained from this lifestyle and <br/>
ricochets into the old &quot;control&quot; view.<br/>
<br/>
Food:<br/>
I&#39;ve done it too when something just <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; doesn&#39;t look right to me. I would hate for someone to try and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>convince me <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; otherwise on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;key words&quot; On a regular basis. But I have had my dh say to me, <br/>
&quot;Julie, you&#39;ve got to give this a try. It looks wretched, but it really is = <br/>
<br/>
good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There are times when I will actuall tell the kids that the look of a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>certain <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; room is upsetting me to look at and would they mind helping <br/>
 </span></blockquote>me neaten it up. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Of course this would be all their stuff, I would never ask this of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; kitchen or living room!!! I have never had any one of them <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(aside from the 2 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; yo) tell me no. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me neither. But we&#39;ve lived this way since they were born. We <br/>
always pick up at five.<br/>
<br/>
For families who have either been highly controlling or who have <br/>
not ever had a routine in place, it may not work like this. I feel for <br/>
them! I don&#39;t think their kids will be damaged to simply let them <br/>
know what the routine of the house is going to be.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is really unhappy abuot it, why can&#39;t they dialog and <br/>
come up with an alternative plan that takes everyone&#39;s needs <br/>
into account? Why do we simply default to the child&#39;s, &quot;No I don&#39;t <br/>
want to.&quot; and then consider that the end of the discussion?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It&#39;s not a chore or a mandatory thing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is semantics. Ours is a habit and I think habits are <br/>
good. And we have exceptions when someone can&#39;t, doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to or needs a break.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree with a large family functioning better under those <br/>
 </span></blockquote>circumstances. I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; just don&#39;t see it as needing chores or a schedule. My house is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>not up for <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; grabs either and it&#39;s pretty much always neat and always clean. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe it&#39;s <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; just the way one goes about it. In fact I do believe it is that very <br/>
 </span></blockquote>thing <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that is most important. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here I would agree with you. I just don&#39;t like hearing that moms <br/>
feel overwhelmed and out of control in their own homes. I&#39;ve <br/>
seen too many burn-out and feel like failures for not attaining <br/>
some vision of an ideal that may even be twisted from what it <br/>
ought to be.<br/>

Thank you Kelli. I agree. And wasn&#39;t it Sandra who said that we <br/>
should do one thing at a time, change one piece at a time? I am <br/>
taking that to heart. <br/>
<br/>
The first week that we let our kids know our change of direction, <br/>
two of the kids had meltdowns later in the week. They felt that all <br/>
the happy routines we had set together were going to be <br/>
overturned and lost. Amazing isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
Two of them said, &quot;We have too much freedom now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I reassured them that they had freedom to choose things, but not <br/>
total responsibility. We were rearranging our roles in their lives to <br/>
be supporters, cheerleaders and facilitators rather than <br/>
gate-keepers. (And believe me when I say, we are among the <br/>
most relaxed, listen-to-your-kids kind of parents we know around <br/>
here already so I didn&#39;t expect that the change would be that <br/>
significant to them).<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I realized is that some personalities really <br/>
enjoy &quot;performing&quot; for someone else. They felt that their work <br/>
might no mlonger matter to me if I wasn&#39;t requiring it of them. So <br/>
that&#39;s been a transition... and it&#39;s gone pretty quickly actually <br/>
since I&#39;ve been able to be more involved in more fun stuff than <br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve started to adjust. Both of these kids wanted a schedule <br/>
so I helped them to create one. Then they both tossed it within a <br/>
week. The older of the two has a very orderly way of going about <br/>
her business and the younger one is now finding his own <br/>
rhythm. I think this is very important.<br/>
<br/>
But when we consulted them on clean up and weekly &quot;chores,&quot; <br/>
they all agreed that the house runs better when we do them that <br/>
way. So we continue.<br/>
<br/>
(Someone asked me how I&#39;d feel if my dh told me I needed to <br/>
clean up the yard... funny how everyone thinks the yard is the <br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
I think this type of thing is interesting too,    <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
is this type of a personality, (a passive, people pleaser), even harder to read?         My husband is this way,  and was also controlled his whole life.  He was not abused, I would see it as a type of coersion.  They (he and his siblings) were basically told this is the way it is and lets make the best ot it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He always thought he was a happy, well-adjusted person,   well, now I come along with all these unschooling ideas (freedoms) and he reevaluates all his childhood and he really is questioning alot of things.     He was never asked what he wanted, yet he never ever told his parents no either.   They always thought he was OK,  but now he doesn&#39;t even know what he likes or dislikes.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think he has been relatively happy with his life,  but he never realized his life could be a different way,  like for example, making a living doing something he enjoys.    <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Of course. I keep saying that I&#39;m asking for help (not requiring it <br/>
with punishment for not complying), but I have routines in place. I <br/>
don&#39;t just wait until the spirit moves us to clean or keep house. <br/>
That&#39;s the issue for me. Why isn&#39;t that clear?<br/>
<br/>
Do you <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; see that no one here is saying &quot;Don&#39;t ask for help&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I see is that each time anyone (including me) suggests <br/>
that we have a routine practice, the response comes back that <br/>
the child is somehow being forced or is losing his ability to <br/>
choose.<br/>
<br/>
My point was that kids hae a better idea of how to be a part of a <br/>
family if the parent set up routines for basic family liviing. I think <br/>
the imput of the kids is valuable. But I guess I don&#39;t understand <br/>
this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do you want to help clean up the house?&quot; with the strong <br/>
possiblity of &quot;no&quot; versus<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s our house clean up time!&quot; and then we all get going to do it.<br/>
<br/>
If someone said, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m on the computere and about to beat a <br/>
level, can I join you in a minute?&quot; I&#39;d say yes every time. If daily a <br/>
kid said, &quot;I&#39;m going to go to the bathroom&quot; and skipped being a <br/>
part of the clean up time, I&#39;d want to have a conversation about <br/>
why he or she didn&#39;t want to help and what that meant in the <br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
But if every day, every aspect of family living is a &quot;yes/no&quot; vote <br/>
rather than with some predictable format that works like waves <br/>
on a beach, I feel like we would lose something valuable. (What <br/>
if half of the kids thought playing on the computer was better than <br/>
meals together? In our home, we eat together. I don&#39;t think about <br/>
whether someone would prefer to eat alone in his room...)<br/>
<br/>
What am I missing?<br/>

haven&#39;;t once mentioned privilege loss. I&#39;ve brought up setting up <br/>

I&#39;ve asked for help plenty of times. But I guess I think it&#39;s not so <br/>
weird to think that we&#39;ll do certain things each day together to <br/>
keep the house under wraps.<br/>

Sigh. I guess I&#39;m not being very clear.<br/>

&lt;&lt; one of the things that concerns me is that I  <br/>
hear women talking about children as though they are <br/>
little adults. Kids are notoriously poor at imagining future <br/>
outcomes. They don&#39;t always tie past behavior with present <br/>
results. (Sleep is an easy example of this, particularly with young <br/>
kids.) They often won&#39;t try something new (as in food) just based <br/>
on it&#39;s color. They often aren&#39;t conscious of other people&#39;s <br/>
possessions or even their own. (I&#39;m talking about young children <br/>
especially--under 10).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t matter if they turn foods down based on color, as long as the <br/>
parents have no requirements that they try everything or clean their plates.  <br/>
In the absence of coercion to eat assigned foods, turning down foods is fine. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Part of taking care of one&#39;s possessions is keeping them out of the mouths of <br/>
dogs and out of the hands of people who won&#39;t take care of them.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Kids are notoriously poor at imagining future <br/>
outcomes. They don&#39;t always tie past behavior with present <br/>
results. (Sleep is an easy example of this, particularly with young <br/>
kids.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And unless they&#39;re allowed to try it out, they can&#39;t begin to tie them <br/>
together until they&#39;re much older, until the mother &quot;lets&quot; them try it.<br/>
<br/>
My kids, even under ten, learned that if they needed to get up early they <br/>
needed to go to sleep earlier.  They BELIEVED it, not because I told them so, <br/>
but they had had some days when they slept later than they had planned to, or <br/>
when they really had to get up and felt too tired.<br/>
<br/>
Waking kids up early for meanness because they stayed up late, &quot;to teach them <br/>
a lesson,&quot; teaches them that other people can be spiteful.  Artificial <br/>
lessons are not at all the same as honest learning from the natural world.<br/>
<br/>
End of March, Kirby will have eight days straight of Driver&#39;s ed, 9:00 in the <br/>
morning.  I have watched him for years decide how late to stay up on his own. <br/>
 I can tell you now, that when that time comes he will be going to sleep <br/>
before midnight, probably with a couple of exceptions for his D&D games (but <br/>
those are Saturdays, and Sundays the class is at 10:00).   And I will not be <br/>
making him go to bed, because I don&#39;t need to.  He&#39;s sixteen and hasn&#39;t <br/>
needed me to tell him when to get up or when to go to bed for a couple of <br/>
years.   When he leaves home to go to an apartment or college or whatever, he <br/>
won&#39;t &#39;go crazy.&#39;  His experimenting with staying up all night happened long <br/>
ago.  He has more actual body awareness of his need for sleep than many <br/>
adults do, because he has had opportunities to go to sleep when he was tired, <br/>
instead of by the clock.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t have to imagine future outcomes.  He lived them with things which <br/>
weren&#39;t as crucial as getting to work or getting to a test.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We&#39;ve always had a &quot;clean up after <br/>
yourself&quot; policy and I haven&#39;t given that up.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve modelled taking our dishes to the sink.  But we&#39;ve modelled something <br/>
better than &quot;clean up after yourself.&quot;  If my husband or I get up to leave <br/>
the table, we will also offer to take someone else&#39;s plate.  And not at all <br/>
surprisingly, if one of them gets up they might offer to take ours.   If the <br/>
rule/policy/tradition is they have to take their own, why should they take <br/>
ours?  If the tradition is we take things to the sink, they don&#39;t think of <br/>
limiting what they take to their personal items.  Someone will also take the <br/>
butter back to the fridge, or whatever else.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She is willing and that&#39;s because we take great <br/>
care in not laying a big burden of expectations on her in all her <br/>
other waking hours.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand this.  It seems to be crucial, because you&#39;re crediting it <br/>
with why she is willing to be put to bed, but I don&#39;t understand what &quot;it&quot; <br/>
(the &#39;big burden of expectations&#39;) is.<br/>

possiblity of &quot;no&quot; versus<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s our house clean up time!&quot; and then we all get going to do it.<br/>
<br/>
If someone said, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m on the computere and about to beat a <br/>
level, can I join you in a minute?&quot; I&#39;d say yes every time. If daily a <br/>
kid said, &quot;I&#39;m going to go to the bathroom&quot; and skipped being a <br/>

why he or she didn&#39;t want to help and what that meant in the <br/>

if half of the kids thought playing on the computer was better than <br/>
meals together? In our home, we eat together. I don&#39;t think about <br/>
whether someone would prefer to eat alone in his room...)<br/>

&lt;&lt; The sleep thing, I also wondering that <br/>
if people actually gave the child enough time, if they really would stay up <br/>
all night. Has anyone had a young child that they allowed to stay up every <br/>
night, without comment, still staying up all night long and cranky the next <br/>
day for more than a couple of weeks??? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I thought Holly stayed up all night at an overnight New Year&#39;s Eve party, but <br/>
I just asked her and she said, no, that she went to sleep before the other <br/>
*school*  kids did (she emphasized that word).    She says she went to bed at <br/>
like 2:30 but Parent Trap was on and she watched that for about half an hour. <br/>
 Other kids stayed up later, but not much later.  Like 3:30.<br/>
<br/>
Marty stayed up all night at the New Year&#39;s Eve party he went to.  And he <br/>
stayed up until Midnight on the first, just to try to make 36 hours.  It was <br/>
a contest with another kid.  Marty won.<br/>
<br/>
Holly says she&#39;s never stayed up all night, but once at her friend&#39;s house <br/>
they stayed up until the sun came up.  But &quot;you could just see the light,&quot; <br/>
she said (dawn) and it was summer.<br/>
<br/>
Holly says this morning she wanted to wake up at 10:00 so she was sure to be <br/>
in bed by 1:00.  <br/>
<br/>
I tucked her in about 12:15, but she stayed awake a while, apparently.  I <br/>
went to bed at 12:25.  She says she watched some of Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service, <br/>
in bed.  Turned it off after a while.<br/>
<br/>
But with the freedom to stay up as late as she wants, she has never stayed up <br/>
all night just to do it.  There&#39;s no thrill in doing what&#39;s not forbidden.<br/>
<br/>
One night her friend has to stay awake all night for medical tests.  Holly <br/>
woke up at 10:15 that morning, and spent the night with the friend and her <br/>
mom, going to a restaurant, and WalMart, and doing overnight things, so she <br/>
could go to the doctor.  Holly came back home and took a nap the next day.  <br/>
She doesn&#39;t remember how long the nap was.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; This is what I mean. I think we&#39;re dealing here more with how <br/>
<br/>
parents go about creating an environment that is safe for kids to <br/>
<br/>
express their feelings, desires, rebellions (yes, even these) and <br/>
<br/>
more.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have rebellions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m serious.   My children are not in the least rebellious.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I guess I get concerned when the tone of a discussion <br/>
<br/>
sounds like there is a &quot;right&quot; way to be a family and it looks like <br/>
<br/>
this: no bedtimes, eat whatever they want, never give them a <br/>
<br/>
&quot;chore&quot; (as though the word itself is dangerous).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well if the idea is to help children grow up without the need for rebellion, <br/>
then there is definitely a wrong way, and that is to control what they do and <br/>
say and to try to control what they think and believe.   <br/>
<br/>
But if the idea is for a family to LOOK a certain way, then yes--household <br/>
rules and routines are going to be pretty necessary.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Some of the women here have expressed that their kids don&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
want to help when asked, are staying up very late and their <br/>
<br/>
homes feel like chaos. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I believe all of those are people who have just lately begun trying to loosen <br/>
controls, and in some of the cases they seem perhaps to have just removed the <br/>
rules without laying another framework in its place.<br/>
<br/>
-=-To keep reminding them that the children <br/>
<br/>
need to have a choice about it all puts them in a powerless <br/>
<br/>
position in their own lives!-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think people are trying to empower them to live with their children <br/>
respectfully, instead of putting children back in their [child] place, and <br/>
waiting for some future time when they can be no longer &quot;just&quot; children.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This kind of mother after a couple of babies invariably gave up <br/>
<br/>
this form of parenting by baby four. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
INVARIABLY!?<br/>
<br/>
I know families who did NOT, and some of them are in this forum.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But no pacifiers, no swings, no baby seats were allowed. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen families use pacifiers much, but other things, used for a <br/>
break, not as the first line of baby-care, were not against attachment <br/>
parenting ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe different parts of the country are different.  I think the Bible Belt <br/>
is going to resist attachment parenting for a long time because it looks like <br/>
sin.  It looks like letting a child &quot;have his way,&quot; which is a sin in itself <br/>
in some families.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For the mother who simply must read to her toddler and <br/>
<br/>
vaccuum the floor because so much crap is on it, putting the <br/>
<br/>
baby in a swing isn&#39;t going to harm the baby or the mother-baby <br/>
<br/>
bond. Using a pacifier in car trips isn&#39;t a violation of <br/>
<br/>
demand-feeding.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Okay.  MAKING a child use a pacifier on a schedule would be more in keeping <br/>
with the discussion here, though.   Putting a baby in a swing on a schedule, <br/>
instead of when he seemed to want to snooze hasn&#39;t been recommended anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;d much rather see a mother set up a daily time to pick up the <br/>
<br/>
house and ask her kids to do it with her, than for her to become <br/>
<br/>
so discouraged with their lack of participation and caring that <br/>
<br/>
she ditches all the good stuff to be gained from this lifestyle and <br/>
<br/>
ricochets into the old &quot;control&quot; view.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are those the only two choices?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Here I would agree with you. I just don&#39;t like hearing that moms <br/>
<br/>
feel overwhelmed and out of control in their own homes. I&#39;ve <br/>
<br/>
seen too many burn-out and feel like failures for not attaining <br/>
<br/>
some vision of an ideal that may even be twisted from what it <br/>
<br/>
ought to be.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For a mom who&#39;s feeling like that to create a routine of chores and <br/>
punishments probably will NOT make the situation better.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Two of them said, &quot;We have too much freedom now.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had an uncle who purposely  botched a robbery to get put back in prison.<br/>
It&#39;s not a good defense, that &quot;too much freedom&quot; argument.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;One of the things I realized is that some personalities really <br/>
enjoy &quot;performing&quot; for someone else. They felt that their work <br/>
might no mlonger matter to me if I wasn&#39;t requiring it of them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed getting good grades in school.  I enjoyed racing other girl scouts <br/>
to get badges.  But is that really a healthy thing?  My kids haven&#39;t had a <br/>
chance to have that feeling. So whether their personalities need it or not, <br/>
we don&#39;t know.   So far they do things because it seems interesting, or <br/>
because it needs to be done.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They&#39;ve started to adjust. Both of these kids wanted a schedule <br/>
so I helped them to create one. Then they both tossed it within a <br/>
week. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly has done that several times.  She wants structure.  But then she <br/>
immediately wants to ignore it.<br/>

I don&#39;t &quot;think about it,&quot; but if a kid has a new video game and he&#39;s playing, <br/>
I&#39;ll say &quot;There&#39;s food&quot; and he has the TOTAL option to say &quot;Save me some!&quot; or <br/>

&lt;&lt; My kids probably don&#39;t even know what a chore is, <br/>
yet you would see them do things that I guess others would call chores. <br/>
(putting away their clothes, both dirty and clean, cleaning up, letting the <br/>
dogs in or out, etc) So again, I think it&#39;s the approach that is most <br/>
important. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was watching a movie and sorting maybe six or seven loads of <br/>
laundry which had been done over the past few days and dumped on the couch.  <br/>
Each kid was asked, as he or she passed through naturally, to take the <br/>
basket, put the stuff up, and bring back the basket.  Two of them had some <br/>
&quot;public stuff&quot; (towels or sheets) in addition to their own clothes, if it was <br/>
something that gets stored near their room.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody complained and I got the baskets back.  <br/>
<br/>
I took my husband&#39;s basket back when I went to bed, but I won&#39;t put the stuff <br/>
in his drawers.  He will, and then he&#39;ll pick up the growing pile of our <br/>
bedroom stuff and put it in the empty basket.<br/>
<br/>
The only bad thing of all that was Marty came to watch the movie with me, and <br/>
he paused it to go do something.  After about five minutes I called him and <br/>
said it was no fun to fold laundry without the movie, so he rushedback, said <br/>
&#39;sorry&quot; and turned it back on.  He had just not realized that it was <br/>
important for my folding routine! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t done all the laundry switching.  That was done by various people who <br/>
needed something clean, or who were passing by or going downstairs at one <br/>
time or another during the week.<br/>

This is EXACTLY the area I find myself frustrated in....the creating an<br/>
environment that allows freedom when there is a toddler as well as a ten<br/>
yr old.  The movies, videos,  games I would like my oldest to have free<br/>
access to and the constraints of child safety-proofing that give the<br/>
toddler freedom to explore safely.<br/>

&quot;We&#39;ve modelled taking our dishes to the sink.  But we&#39;ve modelled something<br/>
better than &quot;clean up after yourself.&quot;  If my husband or I get up to leave<br/>
the table, we will also offer to take someone else&#39;s plate.  And not at all<br/>
surprisingly, if one of them gets up they might offer to take ours.   If the<br/>
rule/policy/tradition is they have to take their own, why should they take<br/>
ours?  If the tradition is we take things to the sink, they don&#39;t think of<br/>
limiting what they take to their personal items.  Someone will also take the<br/>
butter back to the fridge, or whatever else.<br/>

Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
This is a big problem with me.  I think my husband and I have modeled<br/>
picking up our dishes and taking them to the kitchen, and I have modeled<br/>
putting them in the dishwasher, but my children don&#39;t do this.  Sometimes<br/>
they take the dishes to the kitchen, but they almost never put them in the<br/>
dishwasher.<br/>
<br/>
I had started to require one to load the dishwasher and one to empty.  I did<br/>
this for maybe a few weeks before I came to this unschooling board.  Then I<br/>
didn&#39;t require it of them, and told them why.  So now, they leave dishes all<br/>
over and don&#39;t put them in the diswasher again.<br/>
<br/>
What to do?<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; one of the things that concerns me is that I<br/>
&gt; hear women talking about children as though they are<br/>
&gt; little adults. Kids are notoriously poor at imagining future<br/>
&gt; outcomes. They don&#39;t always tie past behavior with present<br/>
&gt; results. (Sleep is an easy example of this, particularly with young<br/>
&gt; kids.) They often won&#39;t try something new (as in food) just based<br/>
&gt; on it&#39;s color. They often aren&#39;t conscious of other people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; possessions or even their own. (I&#39;m talking about young children<br/>
&gt; especially--under 10).<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It doesn&#39;t matter if they turn foods down based on color, as long as the<br/>
&gt; parents have no requirements that they try everything or clean their<br/>
plates.<br/>
&gt; In the absence of coercion to eat assigned foods, turning down foods is<br/>
fine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Part of taking care of one&#39;s possessions is keeping them out of the mouths<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; dogs and out of the hands of people who won&#39;t take care of them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Kids are notoriously poor at imagining future<br/>
&gt; outcomes. They don&#39;t always tie past behavior with present<br/>
&gt; results. (Sleep is an easy example of this, particularly with young<br/>
&gt; kids.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And unless they&#39;re allowed to try it out, they can&#39;t begin to tie them<br/>
&gt; together until they&#39;re much older, until the mother &quot;lets&quot; them try it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My kids, even under ten, learned that if they needed to get up early they<br/>
&gt; needed to go to sleep earlier.  They BELIEVED it, not because I told them<br/>
so,<br/>
&gt; but they had had some days when they slept later than they had planned to,<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; when they really had to get up and felt too tired.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Waking kids up early for meanness because they stayed up late, &quot;to teach<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; a lesson,&quot; teaches them that other people can be spiteful.  Artificial<br/>
&gt; lessons are not at all the same as honest learning from the natural world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; End of March, Kirby will have eight days straight of Driver&#39;s ed, 9:00 in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; morning.  I have watched him for years decide how late to stay up on his<br/>
own.<br/>
&gt;  I can tell you now, that when that time comes he will be going to sleep<br/>
&gt; before midnight, probably with a couple of exceptions for his D&D games<br/>
(but<br/>
&gt; those are Saturdays, and Sundays the class is at 10:00).   And I will not<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; making him go to bed, because I don&#39;t need to.  He&#39;s sixteen and hasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; needed me to tell him when to get up or when to go to bed for a couple of<br/>
&gt; years.   When he leaves home to go to an apartment or college or whatever,<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t &#39;go crazy.&#39;  His experimenting with staying up all night happened<br/>
long<br/>
&gt; ago.  He has more actual body awareness of his need for sleep than many<br/>
&gt; adults do, because he has had opportunities to go to sleep when he was<br/>
tired,<br/>
&gt; instead of by the clock.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He doesn&#39;t have to imagine future outcomes.  He lived them with things<br/>
which<br/>
&gt; weren&#39;t as crucial as getting to work or getting to a test.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;We&#39;ve always had a &quot;clean up after<br/>
&gt; yourself&quot; policy and I haven&#39;t given that up.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve modelled taking our dishes to the sink.  But we&#39;ve modelled<br/>
something<br/>
&gt; better than &quot;clean up after yourself.&quot;  If my husband or I get up to leave<br/>
&gt; the table, we will also offer to take someone else&#39;s plate.  And not at<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; surprisingly, if one of them gets up they might offer to take ours.   If<br/>

&gt; rule/policy/tradition is they have to take their own, why should they take<br/>
&gt; ours?  If the tradition is we take things to the sink, they don&#39;t think of<br/>
&gt; limiting what they take to their personal items.  Someone will also take<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; butter back to the fridge, or whatever else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;She is willing and that&#39;s because we take great<br/>
&gt; care in not laying a big burden of expectations on her in all her<br/>
&gt; other waking hours.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t understand this.  It seems to be crucial, because you&#39;re crediting<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; with why she is willing to be put to bed, but I don&#39;t understand what &quot;it&quot;<br/>
&gt; (the &#39;big burden of expectations&#39;) is.<br/>

that by implying that they should use these things and not feel bad about it <br/>
you could damage their confidence.  The better choice for me has always been <br/>

I know that I never used a swing, play pen, bassinet, crib, pacifier, bottle <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857993332">&lt;&lt;(What <br/>
if half of the kids thought playing on the computer was better than <br/>
meals together? In our home, we eat together. I don&#39;t think about <br/>
whether someone would prefer to eat alone in his room...)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My boys hardly ever eat with us.  They are never hungry when we are. I was <br/>
brought up to eat three meals a day and at certain times and have a hard time <br/>
getting out of that.  My boys eat when hungry and eat until not hungry.  It <br/>
is my goal to never interfere with that.  Don&#39;t want them to have the same <br/>
issues I have.  They are in control of food.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Trust me. As an LLL leader, I didn&#39;t suggest these if a mother <br/>
didn&#39;t want to use them. What I *did* do, however, is not look <br/>
down at a mother who felt overwhelmed and felt she couldn&#39;t <br/>
admit to pacifier use at a meeting. Whenever someone feels she <br/>
must hide in a group to fit in, the ideology ends up on shaky <br/>
ground.<br/>
<br/>
The better choice for me has always been <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to try to work with what they want to do.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That was my point. And sometimes it meant nurturing a mom <br/>
who made choices that didn&#39;t jibe with LLL ideals 100%.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know that I never used a swing, play pen, bassinet, crib, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>pacifier, bottle <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; etc. and we are great. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Same here. (Though a couple of our kids used a pacifier and the <br/>
last one had a crib for naps). I didn&#39;t even have a stroller for the <br/>
first three kids and all of them slept in our room.<br/>
<br/>
And I feel that if I had used these things it could <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have damaged our parent-child bond.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I am convinced that the parent-child bond isn&#39;t guaranteed <br/>
by these practices either.<br/>
<br/>
My only point in using that analogy is to expand some of this <br/>
dialog--to make room for admissions and needs. When there is <br/>
such a strong idealism being communicated in every post, <br/>
people shut down telling the truth to fit in. But then they don&#39;t get <br/>
the help they actually need.<br/>
