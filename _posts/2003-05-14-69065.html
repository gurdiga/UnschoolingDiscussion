That was a beautiful post, thanks for sharing.  You do look at the world <br/>
differently when you&#39;ve had a child die, there&#39;s just no way around it.  <br/>
Every second is precious, every cup of spilled juice is a reminder of the one <br/>
who&#39;s messes you long to clean up and will never be able to.  EVERYTHING <br/>
becomes a joy as a mother and a shelter from a harsh world sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
The sound of a baby crying yet again in the night when you are so exhausted <br/>
you cry for sleep brings a smile to your face because you CAN nurse that <br/>
precious child and comfort them.<br/>
<br/>
Your words were beautiful, I feel them in my heart, thanks for sharing!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Interesting.  I lost my first.  She was born 2 months early and then turned<br/>
out to have a major heart defect.  She lived 7 1/2 months and died following<br/>
heart surgery.  I didn&#39;t have another child to focus on.  What I did do was<br/>
rush into a new marriage (the stress had finally kicked the previous one<br/>
over the edge) and pregnancy.  While I always say that Heather was the best<br/>
mistake I ever made, it can&#39;t have been easy for her and her brother growing<br/>
up in and after that messed up marriage.<br/>

I felt the same way you do about the things I learned and gained from having<br/>
Ariana for that short time.<br/>
