<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976877556">I have been pretty much unschooling our boys for the past couple<br/>
months.  I honestly just started it and didn&#39;t really say anything to<br/>
DH.  He would ask what we did in a day and I would tell him what we<br/>
did.  So after dinner tonight he asked me &quot;so, are you unschooling the<br/>
boys now?&quot;  I almost fell out of my seat!  I said &quot;yeah, pretty much&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
He then says, &quot;I&#39;ve read about it and it seems like a good concept as<br/>
long as you stay on top of it&quot;.  I told him that I plan on living a<br/>
full life full of experiences with them (and him!).  He then asked to<br/>
read one of my unschooling books!  I was so happy!  I gave him a<br/>
couple to start him off and Sandra&#39;s &quot;Moving a Puddle&quot; is next to our<br/>
bed for him to read too.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I can now say we are officially unschooling!<br/>
