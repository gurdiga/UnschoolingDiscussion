I am trying to get some info on  &quot;unschooling.&quot;  I am 60 years old and have<br/>
a daughter who just turned 8 and would be in 3rd grade in public school.<br/>
Because I believe strongly that our world is so different now I believe that<br/>
children no longer benefit from the public school&#39;s antiquated values and<br/>
teaching methods.  I believe strongly that we must teach them flexibility or<br/>
allow that, encourage love toward others and their environment and survival.<br/>
To that end I enrolled her in CAVA this year at the suggestion of another<br/>
parent in our small town.  I realize we have only replaced the same<br/>
curriculum--maybe a little better quality--to be done at home with the same<br/>
requirements and testing as in the classroom setting.  I am feeling<br/>
frustrated as I try to make my daughter sit and do reading, answer<br/>
questions, math over and over, etc.  I really am an unschooling advocate.<br/>
We travel abroad a great deal and her learning comes from example.  We cook<br/>
together and discuss measurements; she has an incredible vocabulary and<br/>
conceptualizes well but she certainly is not reading &quot;at grade level&quot;  How<br/>
do I make the leap to unschooling and still satisfy the law about accredited<br/>
schools in California.  Thus far we use the CAVA materials as an outline and<br/>
fake it.  Any thoughts?  Thanks. Maureen Jones, mother of Caitlin.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92476888">I think what you can do, and what most unschoolers in CA do, is to file an R4. It turns your home into a private school, meeting state requirements, without having to awnser to the school board.<br/>
 <br/>
~Rebecca<br/>
<br/>
4. Filing a Private School Affidavit (R4 Form) for exemption as a Private School. (E.C. 33190 & 48222)<br/>
The least restrictive method for homeschooling is to teach your children without being involved with a school district or any form of government schooling. You can establish your own private school in your home. In California, private school teachers are not required to have teaching credentials. Once you establish your private school you must file a Private School Affidavit with the CA Department of Education between October 1st and 15th annually. As a private school, you are required to maintain certain records (see list below) and must comply with the CA Education Codes that pertain to private schools. Again, Private School Affidavits must be filed annually between October 1st and 15th.<br/>

<br/>
Maureen, Rebecca was right when she gave you the information about the R-4.<br/>
As a traveler and Unschooler, I would recommend that option for you as being<br/>
the freest also. All the reassuring legal information about the four h/s<br/>
options in CA is available at two State wide homeschool organizations&#39;<br/>
websites:<br/>
<br/>
The California Homeschool Network<br/>
http://www.californiahomeschool.net<br/>
<br/>
And<br/>
Home Schoolers of California<br/>
www.HSC.org<br/>
<br/>
HSC also has an email list, although it is not about unschooling<br/>
specifically.<br/>
<br/>
To find local home schoolers with parkdays and what-not in your area try<br/>
www.nhen.org and click on the county contacts link. Where are you in CA?<br/>
<br/>
My local group is Culver-Westchester Homeschool Network - not many<br/>
Unschoolers <br/>
www.geocities.com/djjhp/CWHNmain.htm<br/>
<br/>
Now as to getting to Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing that you can do is toss your curriculum materials into a box,<br/>
along with coloring books, games, toys, stuff that Caitlin can pull out on<br/>
her own when she is at a loose end and wants something different to do that<br/>
day. Treat as just another resource, some of which will be nonsensical. Also<br/>
throw in the garbage the &quot;teacher guides&quot; or whatever. Caitlin will find her<br/>
own way of utilizing the material, or not, and either outcome is just fine.<br/>
<br/>
She will probably want to de-school, also called decompress, which is a<br/>
period of seeming inactivity while the psychic damage from being forced to<br/>
engage in activities not of her choosing heals. She may appear unmotivated,<br/>
but it won&#39;t last, as long as you remain calm and non-judgmental as you seem<br/>
to be.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of great sources of information:<br/>
<br/>
www.sandradodd.com/unschooling Essays from Sandra and others conveniently<br/>
organized into topics of interest - although they are really all connected.<br/>
<br/>
www.unschooling.info/  New wonderful message boards<br/>
<br/>
www.unschooling.com  Old wonderful message boards<br/>
<br/>
There is also the yahoo group UnschoolingBasics, a sister to this wonderful<br/>
list, aimed specifically at people just beginning the journey to<br/>
Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun, and welcome to the journey.<br/>
