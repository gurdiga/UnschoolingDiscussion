&lt;&lt; I asked her if I could share her thoughts with this list, she said sure, <br/>
but <br/>
 make sure you tell them about the neat cell cake we baked last week.  So, we <br/>
 baked a round cake, frosted it and she decorated it with candies and such to <br/>
 represent a cell, she&#39;s done it before but was in the mood to either bake, <br/>
 buy licorice whips and fire balls and gum drops and jelly beans, to <br/>
 experiment more, or maybe just eat cake!   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now THAT is what a 14 y.o. should be doing with her interest!! :)<br/>
Very cool.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
