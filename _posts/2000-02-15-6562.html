<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619923358">hi,<br/>
<br/>
sorry about this late response but i wrote this sometime ago but changed<br/>
servers and email address and  ran into some glitches so i&#39;ve been<br/>
off-line/list for a bit and am slowly catching up.  sorry if i&#39;ve<br/>
repeated what others have said but i&#39;ve got lots to read:)<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>

hi wini,<br/>
<br/>
i am also 40 with a 4 yo (son).  i&#39;m a painter and pretty much stopped<br/>
painting after getting<br/>
pregnant.  my situation is a bit different because what&#39;s kept me from<br/>
paint for the past few<br/>
years was an autoimmune disease which screwed up the muscles in my<br/>
shoulders preventing<br/>
me from doing nearly everything (including dressing).  though it seems<br/>
to be passing<br/>
getting back to painting has become a lesson in patience.<br/>
<br/>
what i would like to say as far as working and homeschooling is i think<br/>
its very possible and it will<br/>
look very different.  i think the essence of unschooling is to be who<br/>
you are and pursue your<br/>
interests - you don&#39;t have to sacrifice yourself or your kids, but when<br/>
you pursue something do<br/>
it in the context of your family, not - you do your thing and your child<br/>
does her, creating a side by<br/>
side situation but involve your daughter in what you are doing and get<br/>
involved in what your<br/>
daughter is doing.  setting up mutual experiences where everyone&#39;s needs<br/>
are important and<br/>
are met.<br/>
<br/>
here&#39;s an example of something we have done.  my husband, thad, had been<br/>
working at home<br/>
and he would stay up late to work on the computer.  well rene&#39;,  who was<br/>
3 1/2  when this came<br/>
about, really wanted to work with him so we bought him his own computer<br/>
and set it up next to<br/>
the other one.  thad and rene&#39; would work late into the night right next<br/>
to each other.  now thad is<br/>
working for a software company and has set it up for rene&#39; to be a<br/>
software tester.  rene&#39; can&#39;t wait<br/>
for this to happen.  he doesn&#39;t get to go everyday - which i thinks he<br/>
would like - but he is excited<br/>
because he will be getting involved.<br/>
<br/>
obviously your situation will be unique and i think it will call for<br/>
some creativity but i absolutely<br/>
believe anything is possible you just have to find what works for you.<br/>
i think a lot of people fear<br/>
a lost of identity when their children take a prominent role in their<br/>
lives hence the high daycare<br/>
enrollment (nearly all my friends have gone the route of &#39;2 person<br/>
income&#39; and most don&#39;t<br/>
really need the money as much as they need the verification that they<br/>
are contributing<br/>
financially and can call themselves something other than &#39;stay at home<br/>
parents&#39;).  i certainly can<br/>
understand this need.  our society has made it an embarrassment to say<br/>
you&#39;re a stay at home<br/>
parent.  but we must do what it is that makes us confident because it is<br/>
really important to our<br/>
kids that we as parents find our own happiness but in the context of<br/>
being parents.  good luck<br/>
though i doubt you need it,  just follow your heart as it appears you<br/>
have been and all will be<br/>
fine (and rough days will be well worth it:)<br/>
