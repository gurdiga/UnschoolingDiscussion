Kirby got a D on his first essay in English 101.  I told him he could  quit <br/>
English if he wants.  Honestly, this teacher is repressive and boring  and he <br/>
said his workmate in there who got a B (there were no A&#39;s) was ranting  about <br/>
how awful the course is and how arbitrary the teacher is, and she&#39;s  thinking <br/>
of quitting it.  Meanwhile his friend Renee is in English 120 and  says her <br/>
teacher is very interesting and all laid back.<br/>
 <br/>
He likes the math and college success classes. But I agree with him about  <br/>
the English paper.  The teacher told him he wrote well, but that  that&#39;s not <br/>
enough.  He was 10 points off (a whole grade) for not  underlining the thesis <br/>
sentence, and another 10 points off because some  paragraphs were less than 100 <br/>
words.   So that was a C before she  even read a word.<br/>
 <br/>
The tuition is a loss, but just like not finishing a dozen donuts just  <br/>
because you paid for them, it&#39;s better for him to suffer less and not have a D  or <br/>
an F on a report card, and a LOT of bitter essay-writing memories than for  <br/>
him to wait and try another semester for a teacher he likes better.<br/>
 <br/>
As usual, since this school-contact began, I&#39;m suffering more emotional  <br/>
trauma than he is.<br/>
 <br/>
The first grade in his entire life, and it&#39;s a D.   That wounds  my soul, but <br/>
his own soul is strong and whole and seems fine!<br/>

As Madeline says &quot;Pooh pooh&quot;! And of course in the real world of writing<br/>
these are the kind of issues that in the first instance the typographer<br/>
might handle (if I am taking the meaning of &quot;underlining&quot; aright), and in<br/>
the second would be noted by his editor (*if* it was important for some<br/>
reason) and worked on with him. Merely saying he &quot;wrote well&quot; isn&#39;t really<br/>
very helpful in terms of constructive criticism to help him get better at<br/>
academic writing.<br/>
<br/>
Is it Strunk and White who authored &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;? That was<br/>
recommended a lot when I was in college.<br/>

<br/>
Some English teachers are big on rewriting being part of the process.  <br/>
So adding some ideas or some verbiage to the shorter paragraphs and <br/>
underlining the silly thesis statement(s) may be enough to significantly <br/>
improve the grade.  If the paper was done on the computer, this could be <br/>
done pretty quickly.<br/>

That was the final deal, it&#39;s over, it&#39;s a D, no reprieve.  <br/>
<br/>
He said every day of class there have been more people missing.   That was <br/>
even before first big grading day.  Four each of B, C, D and  F.  When he fist <br/>
went to that class he said there were about 25  people.  Now 16.  So it&#39;s not <br/>
just Kirby&#39;s newness to the  situation.  People who&#39;ve been to school for 13 <br/>
years or more are bailing  too.<br/>

all those years at home and suddenly a C in a subject he&#39;s good at. It infuriated me and <br/>
stressed me and eventually drove me to unschooling totally. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m stunned at the ridiculousness this teacher is calling writing. Shame on her! Gives <br/>
writing teachers everywhere a bad name.<br/>

Pull him out of that class. That&#39;s what you&#39;d tell us to do. ;-)<br/>

<br/>
It felt good to make the offer and his eyes light up, but hey--when we went  <br/>
to the oral surgeon to arrange to get his wisdom teeth out, he signed all the  <br/>
forms.  He&#39;s 18, and he can pull himownself out of that class if he wants  <br/>
to.  But I can stand by and say &quot;No problem, English classes will be with  us <br/>
always.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
And I think even just that brush with formal essay writing with picky  <br/>
requirements will be enough to make him a little more aware, for a while, of the  <br/>
details in the writing he sees around him.  And that in itself will  probably be <br/>
a better writing exercise than sticking with this course of  humor-free, <br/>
rule-filled schoolitude.<br/>
 <br/>
What I liked about his essay was that he focused on the good and  responsible <br/>
mothering of the subject.  Others might have characterized her  as an <br/>
entrepreneur or as someone who overcame prejudice, but Kirby showed her as  a <br/>
self-sacrificing mother.<br/>
 <br/>
So there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

When he first went to each class, he offered the teacher an apple, and said  <br/>
something like, &quot;I&#39;ve never been to school before, but I saw this in a movie,  <br/>
and so I thought...&quot; or something to that effect.  They all declined  <br/>
politely, he said, and he brought the apple home.<br/>
 <br/>
She knows. Nothing personal or individual about any of the students  matters. <br/>
 There are pages and pages of explanation of how many points will  be taken <br/>
off for what faults, how many points off if you arrive for your  one-on-one <br/>
appointment without 3x5 cards, how many points if you don&#39;t show up  at all, etc. <br/>
  The course is set.  The pawns are interchangeable  and there are no <br/>
personal relationships expected, required, or accepted.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-&quot;Wrote well&quot; seems like a backhanded compliment to me.  Throwing  him a  <br/>

 <br/>
I think it&#39;s an admission that her goal isn&#39;t about writing, it&#39;s about  <br/>
showing them how to &quot;be academics.&quot;  It&#39;s about conformity and  &quot;cooperation&quot; <br/>
(when cooperation means blind following for the good of the group,  but her group <br/>
is dwindling).<br/>

<br/>
OTH, it sound like Kirby will need to decide if he wants to play the game or not, by crossing the t&#39;s and dotting the i&#39;s exactly the way this teacher wants them crossed and dotted, if he decides to stay in the class.<br/>

<br/>
Strunk and White is a solid book (no doubt deserves the title classic). But there are so <br/>
many wonderful grammar references/resources now that aren&#39;t quite to &quot;old&quot; feeling.<br/>
<br/>
I loved _Woe is I_ too.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite grammar *references* though, are Nitty Gritty Grammar and More Nitty Gritty <br/>
Grammar (by Edith Fine and Judith Jospehsonthe self-proclaimed Grammar Patrol).<br/>
<br/>
These books are the kind that you can flip to a section that deals specifically with the <br/>
punctuation/grammar issue of concern. More NGG is indexed by alphabet so you can look <br/>
for commas by looking under &quot;c&quot; or semi-colons by looking under &quot;s.&quot; The best thing <br/>
about the Nitty Gritty Grammar books is that they use synidcated cartoons to reinforce <br/>
grammar and punctuation principles.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest at fourteen read the books all the way through just to see all the comics. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I got it for Cameron &#39;cause S&W is technical and boring. O&#39;Conner is fun and playful---<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and a little more &#39;current&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard (here & @ A-L) about two other fun ones---and I may pick them up, but I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>really like _Woe is I_.<br/>
<br/>
I loved _Woe is I_ as a good grammar read, but find it a bit harder to use for quick checks. <br/>
I have both.<br/>

<br/>
Brings back memories of why I hated high school and college English...and now that I&#39;m in my forties I&#39;m drawn to fiction writing and am fairly good at it.<br/>
<br/>
Some teachers are on power trips, and their instructions are meant to be anal and confusing and they&#39;re just looking for a reason to mark you down, not really looking to help you learn how to write.  Sad.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s time and energies would be better spent with a teacher who wants his/her students to actually learn something.  If all the students bail, that will send a strong message to the power trip lady. ;)<br/>

<br/>
Revision is the name of the game in the real world.<br/>
They wrote the first draft in class, she gave them a checklist of what to fix, and they had the one shot to fix it (while referring back to that list all they wanted).<br/>
<br/>
It was a test.  It was a test of practice writing.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t real, live writing for lively realworld purposes.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874622863">any time one enters any institution in order to &#39;learn&#39; something,<br/>
there is a fork in the road. one can learn the subject or one can<br/>
learn the teacher. learning the teacher is a useful skill and will<br/>
lead to a better &#39;grade&#39; and maybe better understanding of other<br/>
people. i guess it all depends on what is important to one at the<br/>
time.. teaching to write is a rare skill, but anyone can grade based<br/>
on adherence to the petty little rules :( I wonder how many really<br/>
good future writers were convinced they suck by incompetent &quot;English<br/>
teachers&quot;..  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The teacher told him he wrote well, but<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s not enough.  He was 10 points off (a whole grade) for not<br/>
&gt; underlining the thesis, and another 10 points off because some <br/>
&gt; paragraphs<br/>
&gt; were less than 100 words.  So that was a C before she  even read a<br/>
&gt; word.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
When I was in school I wrote the story of how my cat was stuck in a tree for over a week, etc, as a children&#39;s story.  My Professor&#39;s remarks were that this was &quot;too scary a concept for children&quot;. It had a happy ending.... oh well, as a child I would say the experience was more sad than scary. <br/>

Lots and lots of money in Juvenile fiction! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Johnson was an ass.   Your first story could be about a nasty teacher<br/>
who is reduced in size by magic red ink and then squashed under the<br/>
sensible shoe of a very clever statistician.  <br/>
