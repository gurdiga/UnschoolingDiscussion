<div id="ygrps-yiv-494587433">Hi Stephanie,<br/>
<br/>
We lived in University City, 47th and Pine to be precise.  At least a murder<br/>
a year on our block, in addition to countless car thefts, muggings, the<br/>
everyday occurence of unleashed pit bulls who you know weren&#39;t trained to be<br/>
sweet and friendly roaming the streets, and oil collecting on our window<br/>
screens and probably our lungs blowing up from the refineries in South<br/>
Philly.<br/>
<br/>
Boring, strange suburban life down here seems like a party every day<br/>
compared to that.  Suburban Phila is of course not as bad as where we were.<br/>
We even looked in Lansdowne but couldn&#39;t afford anything that wasn&#39;t falling<br/>
apart and would need renovations that we couldn&#39;t afford!<br/>
<br/>
Ezzo.   Hmmm....Below I&#39;ve copied two articles from another list I&#39;m on,<br/>
from a member in the UK who&#39;s very concerned that Babywise not spread to her<br/>
shores.  She&#39;s been working with Penelope Leach, actually, on this.<br/>
<br/>
The first is from the London Independent, and the second is just a public<br/>
release, not published anywhere.  But it tells the story of Ezzoing from an<br/>
inside perspective.  You&#39;ll see.<br/>

HEADLINE: SMACK THE CHILD, PRAISE THE LORD!; A CALIFORNIAN COUPLE<br/>
BELIEVE BABIES SHOULD BE BEATEN INTO OBEDIENCE. NOW THEY ARE BRINGING<br/>
THEIR METHODS TO BRITAIN. AND CHILDCARE EXPERT PENELOPE LEACH IS LEADING<br/>
THE BATTLE TO KEEP THEM AWAY. BY MARY BRAID<br/>
<br/>
Gary and Ann Marie Ezzo have caused a storm in the United States with<br/>
their controversial programme for bringing up baby the Lord&#39;s way, with<br/>
critics claiming their extreme views have resulted in infants being<br/>
rushed to hospital suffering from severe malnutrition and dehydration.<br/>
<br/>
A month before they wash up on British shores, bringing their strict<br/>
child-rearing &quot;first-time obedience&quot; programme in which even babies get<br/>
a taste of corporal punishment, the evangelical couple from California<br/>
are already being roundly denounced. &quot;I don&#39;t want them over here<br/>
speaking to our parents,&quot; says the British child -care expert Penelope<br/>
Leach, already the Ezzos&#39; arch enemy on the US conference circuit.<br/>
<br/>
Leach makes no apologies for sounding draconian about the Ezzos, whom<br/>
she condemned this week at a BMA children&#39;s conference in London.<br/>
&quot;Everyone has a right to their opinion until it amounts to cruelty to<br/>
babies,&quot; she says. &quot;What they say should carry a government health<br/>
warning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The antipathy is mutual. Gary Ezzo claims parental indulgence has<br/>
brought &quot;moral decline&quot; to the US and Britain. He sees Leach as the<br/>
devil&#39;s agent and will, in turn, denounce her child-centred philosophy<br/>
at public appearances in Britain next month.<br/>
<br/>
The Ezzos look benign enough, if a touch over-starched. Mrs Ezzo, a<br/>
nurse, favours chaste Puritan lace collars and her husband a scrubbed,<br/>
closely shorn Mormon look. A few years ago the couple were nobodies.<br/>
Then they started parenting classes at their local church, apparently<br/>
because their own well-disciplined brood was the envy of the<br/>
congregation.<br/>
<br/>
Business has boomed as American parents have clamoured for the Ezzos&#39;<br/>
heavily Christian teaching materials, and their secular books in which<br/>
God gets hardly a mention on the journey to the lucrative wider market.<br/>
Their promise of well -behaved children, who sleep through the night,<br/>
has created the multimillion-dollar &quot;ministry&quot; Growing Families<br/>
International.<br/>
<br/>
It is easy to see why the Ezzos are reviled by the child-care<br/>
establishment. In On Becoming Babywise, a best-seller in the States,<br/>
they decree that babies as young as eight months can be taught high-<br/>
chair manners, such as special Ezzo &quot;signs&quot; for &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank<br/>
you&quot;, and to sit up straight with their arms by their sides. They<br/>
recommend that baby&#39;s arms are held in position until the message sinks<br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
That the difference between right and wrong cannot yet be appreciated<br/>
should not prevent morally degenerative behaviour being stamped out, so<br/>
parents must stop babies banging on high-chair tables, flipping over<br/>
plates and wilfully arching their backs, by swotting baby&#39;s hand or<br/>
squeezing it until &quot;it causes discomfort&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It is best to obey at the earliest opportunity for the corporal<br/>
punishment stakes rise as baby grows.<br/>
<br/>
At 18 months children should be smacked for poor table manners, with a<br/>
plastic spatula to &quot;inflict pain but not break bones or damage skin<br/>
tissue&quot;. And if that causes tears, mothers should not worry because &quot;God<br/>
did not intervene when His Son cried out on the cross&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The Ezzos advise parents to put themselves first and make baby fit their<br/>
routine, which might explain why their message drifted from the pews to<br/>
the mass market.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Teach the child to obey according to the character of true obedience,<br/>
immediately, completely, without challenge and without complaint,&quot; they<br/>
advise, warning parents not to cuddle too much or to follow the Leach<br/>
principle of feeding on demand unless they want to be slaves to their<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
They recommend feeding every four hours and offer a method that promises<br/>
to have a new baby soon sleeping through the night.<br/>
<br/>
The Ezzos have horrified child development experts by advising mothers<br/>
to leave even six-month-olds alone in their playpens for up to 30<br/>
minutes, twice a day. To avoid &quot;unhealthy attachment&quot;, mothers must stay<br/>
out of sight and persevere even through tears. &quot;(If left to cry) your<br/>
baby will not lose brain cells, experience a drop in IQ or have feelings<br/>
of rejection that will leave him manic depressive at age 30,&quot; states<br/>
Babywise. Their strictest - and surely most unrealistic - dictum is that<br/>
a child not potty trained by two and a half must be made to take<br/>
responsibility for cleaning up its own mess.<br/>
<br/>
According to Arthur Roderick, of the Maranatha Foundation for Christian<br/>
Education Europe, the Swindon-based evangelical organisation which is<br/>
bringing the Ezzos to Britain, the couple are misunderstood and<br/>
misrepresented. He claims to have seen nothing about toddlers cleaning<br/>
up their own mess or any other extreme advice in the materials the Ezzos<br/>
have sent to him. Of allegations that children on the Ezzo programme<br/>
have been hospitalised, Mr Roderick says the Ezzos cannot be responsible<br/>
for &quot;disciples that go ten times further&quot; than they recommend.<br/>
<br/>
The couple, who say the British press is prejudiced [Praise the Lord<br/>
they are!], are not giving interviews before they arrive on 27 October<br/>
but Mr Roderick says they have the support of mainstream American<br/>
evangelical churches. It is not so. The Ezzos have divided evangelical<br/>
Christians. Their former church has distanced itself from their<br/>
programme and leading Christian figures claim they are distorting<br/>
scripture. The American Association of Paediatricians has received a<br/>
flood of complaints about the couple, and is currently investigating<br/>
their methods.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year The Washington Post printed some worrying messages<br/>
posted on the Ezzos&#39; website which suggested their programme was being<br/>
over-zealously applied, especially by those who seem to believe it<br/>
carries the Lord&#39;s endorsement. One exasperated mother complained that<br/>
her two- year-old was still disobedient despite the welts on her bottom.<br/>
<br/>
A father said that even after discipline his 13-month-old daughter was<br/>
still refusing to give the Ezzo sign for &quot;all done&quot; after eating, and a<br/>
mother said she was astonished that her six-month-old had begun to arch<br/>
her back in her high chair. &quot;It&#39;s sad to see that they are really<br/>
sinners,&quot; she wrote.<br/>
<br/>
While Leach insists that the most worrying aspect of the Ezzos&#39; theory<br/>
is that it interferes with normal child development, one mother told The<br/>
Washington Post that she felt the Ezzo programme had turned her<br/>
offspring into &quot;Stepford children&quot;. But every attack on the Ezzos brings<br/>
a little flurry of complaints from American parents who claim their<br/>
advice transformed a difficult baby.<br/>
<br/>
Mr Roderick, who supplies teaching materials to 40 independent<br/>
evangelical schools in Britain and 400 Christian families who teach<br/>
their children at home, is the only distributor in Britain of the Ezzo<br/>
programme. He swears by it. His own nine grandchildren - all under four<br/>
- are on it and well-behaved. Corporal punishment, he insists, is only a<br/>
small element in the philosophy but a useful deterrent for &quot;a wayward or<br/>
sinful child&quot;. Without proper discipline, he argues, we will  always<br/>
have &quot;13-year-old boys impregnating 12-year-old girls&quot; [Note: recently,<br/>
two 12yo girls were reported pregnant in the UK media. Later, one of the<br/>
fathers, a 23yo, was prosecuted for actual and statutory rape. The other<br/>
child was the product of a violent and abusive father].<br/>
<br/>
Surely it is an overreaction to think that the programme, despite its<br/>
popularity in America, will reach the mainstream in less loopy Britain?<br/>
Leach warns against complacency. Smacking is still popular with British<br/>
parents - about 75 per cent still smack the under-ones. Offering a<br/>
simple message in complicated times, the Ezzo programme, Leach warns,<br/>
could well find a home on deprived, desperate sink estates, especially<br/>
when Tony Blair&#39;s government has such &quot;unreasonable expectations&quot; of<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
Rachel Hodgkin, senior policy officer with the National Children&#39;s<br/>
Bureau and a supporter of the anti-corporal punishment campaign Epoch,<br/>
urges the Government to condemn the Ezzo methods ahead of the visit. &quot;As<br/>
far as I can see, it is all about breaking a child&#39;s spirit as early as<br/>
you can,&quot; she says. &quot;It should be taken seriously. I think the<br/>
Department of Health should come out and say that this amounts to<br/>
emotional and physical neglect of babies.&quot;<br/>

And now, the second post, which is graphic and quite disturbing.  I include<br/>
it partially for Faith, since these folks went into this with the best of<br/>
intentions and were basically brainwashed to the point that their child<br/>
almost died and has serious longterm repercussions.<br/>
<br/>
If you get upset easily (as I did), it&#39;s probably not such a good idea to<br/>
read it unless you&#39;re seriously considering Ezzoing or seriously concerned<br/>
about someone who is...There are a few footnotes and leads to other<br/>

AN OPEN LETTER REGARDING THE DANGERS OF PREPARATION FOR PARENTING<br/>
(BABYWISE)<br/>
<br/>
The following is Matthew Hsieh&#39;s history as described by his parents,<br/>
Michael & Michelle Hsieh, April 1999.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this letter is to generate public awareness about yet<br/>
another child who has surely suffered due to following a Christian<br/>
parenting program entitled Preparation for Parenting/Preparation for the<br/>
Toddler Years (secular versions marketed in stores as On Becoming<br/>
BabyWise 1 & 2) by Gary and Anne Marie Ezzo1. We hope that knowledge of<br/>
his case can be used to promote existing and future efforts to inform<br/>
communities of the extremely serious dangers associated with following<br/>
the Ezzos&#39; program, even in its newest editions. It is our hope that, as<br/>
awareness grows, popularity for its teachings will diminish to the<br/>
extent that most churches will no longer promote or choose to be<br/>
affiliated with them.<br/>
<br/>
Initially, we would like to qualify a couple of points. We are both<br/>
college graduates from prestigious universities. Michelle has a business<br/>
degree with an accounting concentration from the University of<br/>
Washington (a rigorous and highly acclaimed program), and Michael has a<br/>
mechanical engineering degree from the University of California,<br/>
Berkeley. He currently works in international sales in the high-tech<br/>
industry, while Michelle is currently a full-time mom. We point this out<br/>
to say that we are not uneducated, fly-by-night, take-whatever-we-hear-<br/>
as-gospel types of people. In fact, we have always prided ourselves on<br/>
possessing strong common sense, thinking things through in an analytical<br/>
manner, and distinguishing between right and wrong. Secondly, we want to<br/>
stress that the classes we attended were, and still are as of this<br/>
writing, the most up-to-date versions of the program. For instance, the<br/>
program&#39;s infant feeding schedules have been revised to suggest feeding<br/>
every two-and-one-half to three hours and to incorporate &quot;flexibility,&quot;<br/>
yet the overall message is indeed the very same as in earlier editions<br/>
(it was shocking to us to learn what they used to recommend!). Major<br/>
problems still exist with following the Ezzos&#39; parenting program.<br/>
<br/>
Matthew was born March 26, 1998. Just prior to his birth, we took the<br/>
first parenting class, Preparation for Parenting (Prep), in a series of<br/>
what was promoted to be the most Christian-based, medically accurate<br/>
parenting information. We took the second class, Preparation for the<br/>
Toddler Years, a couple of months later. As first time parents, we were<br/>
excited about applying the principles, thereby raising our children to<br/>
be both loving and obedient. The messages were strong and clear, and the<br/>
boastful claims of thousands of parents correctly applying the<br/>
principles with only optimum results left little room for debate or need<br/>
to question the material. A couple of times we remember hearing there<br/>
was controversy regarding the program, but we were encouraged to dismiss<br/>
it as coming from parents not using good judgement or incorrectly<br/>
applying the principles, or as simply &quot;secular&quot; society&#39;s attack due to<br/>
the program&#39;s Christian affiliation.<br/>
<br/>
Other than his first week, Matthew&#39;s first two months went rather<br/>
smoothly. His first week was tough, and, looking back, it should have<br/>
been our first indication not to follow the feeding schedule we were<br/>
taught in Prep. We should point out that Matthew was a small newborn.<br/>
Although he was full-term and healthy, he was just under six pounds at<br/>
birth, possibly due to low amniotic fluid levels, which, although not<br/>
significantly alarming, prompted the obstetrician to induce labor eleven<br/>
days early. (Induction is a relatively common practice, and Matthew was<br/>
still considered full-term.) Matthew was born on a Thursday; we were<br/>
discharged on Friday, and yet, during that first week of life, we were<br/>
back at the hospital every day but one. In his third day, he already<br/>
appeared to be losing a little too much weight too quickly, and he was<br/>
getting increasingly jaundiced. His before/after nursing weights<br/>
indicated that he was getting adequate amounts of breastmilk, even<br/>
though he was found to be an extremely efficient eater-normally five<br/>
minutes on one side, and he was done. However, telling the lactation<br/>
consultants and nurses that he was fed every two-and-one-half to three<br/>
hours gave them the intended message that he was being fed on demand.<br/>
Yet, &quot;we knew better&quot;-demand feeding was unhealthy, and we were using<br/>
the Ezzos&#39; parent-directed feeding (PDF) approach.<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday his jaundice was severe enough to require hospitalization, and<br/>
while there our pediatrician also had mother-baby compatibility tests<br/>
performed to see if his body was rejecting Michelle&#39;s milk-tests were<br/>
normal. We were sent home the following day but continued on home photo-<br/>
therapy for the following couple of days. This required a daily visit<br/>
from a nurse. Michelle remembers them telling us 1) to be sure to feed<br/>
on demand, 2) not to press beyond the two-and-one-half- to three-hour<br/>
mark, and 3) to monitor (actually document) all feeding times and<br/>
wet/poopy diapers. Again, we chose to ignore the feeding on demand<br/>
advice due to our &quot;medically supported training,&quot; but we did make sure<br/>
to feed him in the time frame suggested, as this went right along with<br/>
PDF.<br/>
<br/>
Ignoring this advice to feed on demand (or cue) was our FIRST BIG<br/>
MISTAKE. However, despite our scheduled feedings, Matthew&#39;s jaundice did<br/>
clear up, and his wet/poopy diapers met the minimum number, although<br/>
they did seem fairly &quot;weightless.&quot; As new parents having no experience<br/>
to compare it against, we assumed infants just eliminated very tiny<br/>
amounts fairly often. Things continued this way through his two month<br/>
appointment, where his weight registered in the twenty-fifth percentile.<br/>
Although his nursing continued to be short in length, the milk supply<br/>
seemed adequate, and Matthew was fairly content.<br/>
<br/>
Things slowly began to change at this point. Matthew became more<br/>
fussy/irritable and Michelle found herself always questioning her milk<br/>
supply, wondering if he had colic or excess gas (we tried Mylicon Drops)<br/>
or was just overtired. She began pumping regularly, hopefully to ensure<br/>
sufficient milk supply, and also tried supplementing with a bottle, but<br/>
he repeatedly and vehemently refused, becoming so upset that he would<br/>
even refuse the breast at that feeding. Many times Michelle&#39;s intuition<br/>
told her that Matthew was hungry before the scheduled time, yet she<br/>
chose to ignore those signals and instead comfort him back to sleep, due<br/>
to the Ezzos&#39; scheduled feeding philosophies, which had been drilled<br/>
into us. Our training specifically said that regularly feeding him<br/>
sooner than our schedule would interrupt his hunger, digestive, and<br/>
sleep/wake cycles, causing him to be a snacker, and this would just be<br/>
unhealthy for him (and us) overall. We had no reason to argue with this<br/>
supposed medically-backed advice. On very rare occasions, Michelle would<br/>
exercise &quot;flexibility&quot; and feed him before &quot;time&quot; due to his<br/>
uncontrollable cries, but most often he would &quot;submit&quot; to her comforting<br/>
him to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
It was at Matthew&#39;s three-month (possibly between three & four months)<br/>
check-up that we discovered his weight, in terms of percentiles, had<br/>
plummeted. He had dropped off the charts altogether. To say the least,<br/>
we were very alarmed, as he was soon diagnosed as &quot;Failure to Thrive&quot;<br/>
(FTT). Again, when asked about nursing frequencies, we answered every<br/>
two-and-one-half to three hours and of the lack of success in getting<br/>
him to supplement with a bottle. We were told that as long as we had<br/>
always fed on demand, Michelle&#39;s supply should meet his needs. We were<br/>
told to continue as we were, and to come in for frequent weight checks<br/>
between well-child appointments. During this time Matthew&#39;s temperament<br/>
had evened out a bit, and once again he seemed fairly content. What we<br/>
now believe, in fact, to have been the case was that Matthew had become<br/>
resigned to taking only small amounts of milk-not nearly close to what<br/>
he needed to &quot;thrive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We began introducing solid food, which Matthew took to very eagerly. We<br/>
hoped this would help him to put on some more weight. We again followed<br/>
the strict suggestions for proper training from our parenting class, and<br/>
encouraged Matthew to keep his hands down while we spoon fed him. He did<br/>
NOT like this, but we were encouraged to persevere, as our training had<br/>
indicated that he could and would learn to keep his hands down and out<br/>
of/away from his food.<br/>
<br/>
This was our SECOND BIG MISTAKE. He did, in fact, learn to submit to<br/>
keeping his hands down (or our holding them down), but his interest in<br/>
food was quickly diminishing. At six months, we knew beyond a doubt that<br/>
he was still getting far below adequate amounts of milk (we rented a<br/>
highly accurate scale and did before- and after-feeding weights to get<br/>
his total intake for twenty-four-hour periods), and felt we had no other<br/>
choice but to keep feeding him solids as well. His growth had not<br/>
improved, and he was still off the charts.<br/>
<br/>
More and more, Matthew was losing interest in nursing, while still<br/>
refusing outside supplementation by bottle or cup. It was obvious that<br/>
nursing was not a &quot;comfort&quot; to him, as Michelle had always read and<br/>
heard it to be for other babies (a trust issue). It was increasingly<br/>
common for him to arch his back and display other obvious signs that he<br/>
did not want to nurse any longer-just a couple of minutes every four<br/>
hours or so, and he had enough. His back arching was interpreted as a<br/>
possible sign of acid reflux, so we tried Zantac but experienced no<br/>
change in behavior.<br/>
<br/>
If we had rigidly been following the Ezzos&#39; advice in this scenario, we<br/>
would have punished him for his defiant arching. However, Michelle was<br/>
unwilling to punish Matthew for this, in fear that it would cause him to<br/>
reject nourishment even more. At this time (still about six months)<br/>
Michelle was placed on Metaclopramide, a generic form of Reglin, to<br/>
increase her milk supply. It worked wonders. It was obvious through<br/>
pumping that she now had plenty of milk. However, Matthew&#39;s behavior<br/>
about nursing did not change. For so long he had resigned himself to<br/>
small amounts, we believe he had learned to feel full on that<br/>
insufficient amount of milk.<br/>
<br/>
Things continued like this until Matthew was nine-and-one-half months<br/>
old. He was learning up through this time to supplement breastfeeding by<br/>
taking formula from a cup, but again, extremely small amounts of maybe<br/>
an ounce or two. His spoon-fed and fingerfoods were, however, on the<br/>
decline to the point where he would refuse to swallow the spoon-fed food<br/>
we did get in, and wanted nothing to do with fingerfoods. Then, within a<br/>
two-day period, Matthew stopped nursing altogether (apparently due to<br/>
Michelle becoming pregnant, which changes breastmilk flavor). Over the<br/>
next week he became increasingly dehydrated, with a fever above 103-104<br/>
degrees. He would take perhaps eight ounces of formula over the whole<br/>
day, and, still to his dislike, we continued to spoon feed him until he<br/>
would protest too loudly or stop swallowing. We felt we had no choice<br/>
but to push the baby foods, as we were so concerned with his lack of<br/>
formula intake. With his continued rapid decline in<br/>
energy/health/weight, he was admitted to Children&#39;s Hospital to begin<br/>
naso-gastric (NG) tube feedings. He was released from the hospital after<br/>
4 days but has remained on the NG tube.<br/>
<br/>
To say the least, these last months with him on the NG tube have been<br/>
the hardest ever. There were times that he was throwing up so much we<br/>
didn&#39;t know if he would make it. However, with the proper amounts of<br/>
nourishment, his weight has begun to climb dramatically, along with his<br/>
energy and disposition. At the beginning of the tube feedings, he was<br/>
almost ten months old and weighed a mere fourteen pounds, eleven ounces.<br/>
(If he had continued following the curve he set in his first couple of<br/>
months, he would&#39;ve been just shy of 20lbs at this point.) At twelve<br/>
months, he showed significant progress, weighing in at a wonderful<br/>
eighteen pounds (still off the charts, but getting closer).<br/>
<br/>
During this time, we spent a lot of time reflecting on what brought a<br/>
perfectly healthy baby boy to this state of complete food<br/>
aversion/infant anorexia. He has undergone every test (a grueling<br/>
process) to rule out medical problems, which left us with an unexplained<br/>
&quot;behavioral&quot; diagnosis. It was then that a chance reading of an article<br/>
warning against Babywise in a local paper led Michelle to do a little<br/>
more research into the Ezzos&#39; parenting program that we had been so sold<br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
What we found was astonishing. Matthew is just one of hundreds who have<br/>
been diagnosed with improper weight gain or &quot;Failure to Thrive&quot;<br/>
associated with this program. We were not just looking for somewhere to<br/>
put the blame. We had complete respect for the Ezzos and their methods.<br/>
Friends have followed through with the program with only &quot;success.&quot; In<br/>
our hearts, we just knew, as we looked back over his history, analyzed<br/>
medical reports and other articles, that this program indeed was the<br/>
significant reason for his problems.<br/>
<br/>
We cannot begin to explain the feelings of anger, guilt, and remorse<br/>
that accompany the realization that due to some very improper and<br/>
unsound medical advice and child-rearing techniques, our son has had to<br/>
endure so much. &quot;Unpleasant&quot; doesn&#39;t even come close to describing how<br/>
it feels to force this unnatural tube down our son&#39;s nose as he is held<br/>
there screaming, only to have to do it again if he pulls it out or,<br/>
worse, throws it up. And to think that it has been recommended and is<br/>
quite probable that we will have to proceed with the invasive surgery<br/>
for the more permanent stomach tube.<br/>
<br/>
It is our firm opinion that the Ezzos lack the background and,<br/>
therefore, the authority to be preaching about step-by-step methods for<br/>
raising an infant into a thriving toddler. They allow no room for<br/>
individual temperament, size (premies, low birth weight babies, etc.),<br/>
stomach capacity and digestion speed, along with a variety of other<br/>
factors. When their program doesn&#39;t work just right, or they are<br/>
notified of cases of low weight gain, the Ezzos immediately seem to<br/>
attribute it to the parents (a guilt trip) for either not following<br/>
teachings correctly, or following them too rigidly, which is<br/>
contradictory. It has been proven that there is a 300% variation among<br/>
mothers for storage capacity of breastmilk2. Those with larger<br/>
capacities can more often nurse at longer intervals, whereas women with<br/>
smaller capacities need to nurse much more frequently. Most importantly,<br/>
it was noted that all women in these studies had the ability to produce<br/>
plenty of milk over twenty-four hours; what varied was the maximum<br/>
amount they could deliver at one sitting. It is also known that if an<br/>
infant is fed on demand, more appropriately titled &quot;cue feeding,&quot; during<br/>
the first couple of months, the mother is much more likely to establish<br/>
appropriate milk quantities. We were taught to ignore those &quot;cues.&quot; Yes,<br/>
we were told to incorporate some &quot;flexibility&quot; when the child was<br/>
obviously hungry (like crying to be fed), or when it was to suit our own<br/>
needs. However, the Ezzos&#39; definition of demand feeding as feeding a<br/>
baby only when it cries is simply wrong. In fact, demand feeding is<br/>
actually recognizing the child&#39;s hunger cues (before crying, as crying<br/>
is often a late sign of hunger3) and feeding them accordingly. We<br/>
remember those cues vividly, and yet ignored them and tried to pacify<br/>
Matthew in other ways until his &quot;appropriate&quot; feeding time. How very<br/>
sadly wrong we were.<br/>
<br/>
How obviously wrong we were again to choose to follow the seemingly<br/>
medical and biblical advice of the Ezzos in Preparation for the Toddler<br/>
Years. Here we were taught to teach our child appropriate &quot;highchair<br/>
manners&quot; of holding his hands down while he was being fed, and again it<br/>
was said all children can learn obedience in this area. Health and<br/>
medical professionals in the feeding therapy arena would all say this is<br/>
actually one of the worst things one can do. A child naturally wants to<br/>
touch, experiment, etc.-this is a developmental stage/activity all<br/>
children should be allowed to experiment with. Is avoiding a messy floor<br/>
or table to teach compliance worth the possible costs? Yes, some infants<br/>
and maybe even most will learn to be happy to let you hold their hands<br/>
down while spoon feeding and then to let them experiment after with<br/>
finger foods. But, it can be argued, is this really success? Or, is<br/>
success worth the possible cost of later food aversion? Let us tell you,<br/>
it most definitely is not! We remember heartily laughing at a friend<br/>
who, having not taken the parenting program offered by the Ezzos, often<br/>
had to give her six-month-old a bath after a feeding. &quot;How do you keep<br/>
him from exploring with the food and keep it out of his hair?&quot; she would<br/>
ask. We would simply think how much extra work she was creating for<br/>
herself by allowing her child to be, as the Ezzos might describe, &quot;out<br/>
of control and sinful.&quot; Her child is now a healthy, well-behaved one-<br/>
year-old, and that laugh was sadly at our own expense.<br/>
<br/>
So, did we have success with the parenting program? Obviously not. Do<br/>
others have success? Some think they do, as their children learn to be<br/>
fed on schedules, sleep through the night, and otherwise be &quot;obedient.&quot;<br/>
However, is there a long term cost of this obedience? Have bond and<br/>
trust areas been unknowingly damaged? We really wonder. There are plenty<br/>
of good parenting books and classes, but any one of those that comes<br/>
across as if theirs is the only good way (for it is God&#39;s way, right?),<br/>
not only has a lot of nerve but should be questioned in other areas as<br/>
well. If readers take the time to do this, we are confident that they<br/>
will find not only that many of the Ezzos&#39; ideas on parenting are being<br/>
widely questioned as unreliable and outright wrong, but that deeper<br/>
issues of integrity, accountability, and honesty are also in question.<br/>
And, contrary to what we were told about &quot;secular&quot; criticism, much of<br/>
the questioning has come from within the Christian community.<br/>
<br/>
Please, don&#39;t just take our word for it. Do your own research. When you<br/>
are finished, we believe you will draw the same conclusions we have. We<br/>
thought we were following sound parenting information and doing what was<br/>
proclaimed to be in the best interest of our son. We could not have been<br/>
more wrong, and we will always live with that knowledge. We now believe<br/>
nursing on demand, especially in the early months of life, is among the<br/>
most critical things one can do for the long-term health and well-being<br/>
of their child. The harm that has been associated with the Ezzos&#39;<br/>
parent-directed feeding schedules is not always easily undone, and is<br/>
simply not worth the potential risks. No other child or parents deserve<br/>
to endure what we have suffered.<br/>
<br/>
It is our sincere prayer that as awareness of the controversies and<br/>
problems with the Ezzos&#39; Preparation for Parenting and Preparation for<br/>
the Toddler Years (On Becoming BabyWise, books 1 & 2) programs<br/>
increases, the followers will decrease.<br/>
