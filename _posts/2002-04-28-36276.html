&lt;&lt; Where did this ridiculousness originate, anyway? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the most ridiculous theory in the world, but I&#39;ve never yet seen <br/>
anyone explain it in an actually-practical way.  I&#39;ve seen people get all <br/>
caught up in it and get excited and then wander away to get all excited about <br/>
something else.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the official definiton of coercion for their purposes:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Coercive: In TCS usage, a person is under coercion if they are enacting <br/>
one idea or impulse while a contrary one is still active in their mind â€“ in <br/>
other words, if they are literally acting against their own will. Being in <br/>
such a state of mind is psychologically harmful. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If a parent gets kinda tired of taking care of a child, I guess, they&#39;re <br/>
being coerced to continue to care for him.<br/>
<br/>
It is my opinion that just because someone says that it is psychologically <br/>
harmful not to attend to one&#39;s own immediate desires in every second doesn&#39;t <br/>
even NEARLY make it true.<br/>

<br/>
No.  The child hasn&#39;t done anything to coerce the parent, so it would be<br/>
wrong to say the child is coercing the parent.  What you could say (but I&#39;d<br/>
claim it makes no sense) is that the parent coerced emself by having a<br/>
child, and thereby creating a bunch of duties.  The parent is resenting eir<br/>
past choice, which is no one elses fault.</div>

Some of what is said here may challenge you, shock you, disturb you, or seem <br/>
harsh. But remember that people are offering it to be helpful and what feels <br/>
uncomfortable to you might be just what someone else needed to hear.<br/>
