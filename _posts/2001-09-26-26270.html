<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623741249">This way, if the kids are afraid to start out being the first to write, I <br/>
started an email list for them.<br/>
<br/>
It WILL be monitored!<br/>
<br/>
I also have to approve all new members so you will get a post from me if <br/>
your child, like mine, has his/her own account as I need your permission <br/>
for the child to join it.<br/>
<br/>
This way, I know that they are not a spammer or worse :o)<br/>
<br/>
The address for this is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschooledfriends">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschooledfriends</a><br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you or your kids there!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581053445">For those who care, LOL! I&#39;m not leaving the list,<br/>
just change email addy&#39;s.<br/>
I didn&#39;t like how my messages would get held up when<br/>
post from my msn acct so I opened up a yahoo acct. My<br/>
messages get posted so much faster now, but I hate<br/>
having to jump through hoops just to check it. So back<br/>
to msn.<br/>
I&#39;m also unsubbing from a ton of lists. I can&#39;t handle<br/>
600+ posts a day on one acct. I have like 10 of them.<br/>

Have you considered clicking &quot;edit my membership&quot; for your yahoo <br/>
group lists and choosing the option of &quot;no email?&quot;  This is the way I <br/>
manage my groups; I just go to the group website and check the <br/>
messages there, avoiding clogging my private email account.  You <br/>
could also choose daily digest to come to your personal account.<br/>
