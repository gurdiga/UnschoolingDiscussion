&lt;&lt; My husband and I are at odds (not uncommon) about wether the kids are<br/>
 respectful or disrespectful. I think my husband confuses obedience with<br/>
 respect. Just because the kids don&#39;t immediately obey, my husband gets upset<br/>
 because they don&#39;t respect me. I feel they do respect me, just don&#39;t always<br/>
 obey. So, how does one show respect? Is disobedience always a sign of<br/>
 disrespect? I mean the kids do obey, just not right away. I think we have a<br/>
 great amount of respect for one another, but don&#39;t want to be fooling<br/>
 myself. I love the various opinions and advice from all of you and thank you<br/>
 for your help in advance. :)<br/>

   Does your dh like to read? :o)  Kids Are Worth It by Barbara Coloroso<br/>
<br/>
   Do we really want our children to &quot;obey&quot; us? Or do we want a working <br/>
relationship w/ respect. I try to think before I ask,tel,demand,whatever of <br/>
my dd.....would I speak this way if she were a friend or a stranger? <br/>
<br/>
   I (being short a fuse today) snapped at dd to quit hitting the roof <br/>
interior w/ her stick. If it were a friend of mine doing the same thing how <br/>
would I have acted? I would have said &quot;hey Ginger could you please stop using <br/>
the stick in my car?&quot; Something like that. If we treat our children w/ <br/>
respect they in turn(eventually) will treat us w/ respect.<br/>
