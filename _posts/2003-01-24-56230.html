Hot race on buckle of the Bible Belt<br/>
<br/>
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Nothing&#39;s more delectable than a sanctimonious <br/>
Republican whose re-election has gotten caught in his zipper. <br/>
<br/>
Since Tim Hutchinson, a U.S. senator, Baptist preacher and one-time <br/>
enthusiastic champion of family values, last faced the voters of Arkansas, he <br/>
has divorced his wife of 29 years and married a former member of his <br/>
congressional staff who is 13 years his junior. .  . . . .<br/>

-=-The Bible Belt’s Assault on Education<br/>
The Kansas Evolution Policy Attacks the Essence of Education: The Teaching of <br/>
Facts and Reasoning, Not Feelings or Faiths<br/>
 <br/>
The essence of education is the teaching of facts and reasoning skills to our <br/>
children, so that they learn how to think.A little more than two centuries <br/>
down the road, some Americans are asking if the nation has strayed from <br/>
tolerance to &quot;anything goes.&quot; Residents of Aiken, S.C., — in the heart of <br/>
America&#39;s &quot;Bible Belt&quot; — are among those who are wrestling vigorously with <br/>
that question.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The churchgoing majority has always dictated the basic values on which <br/>
most people here rely in their daily lives. There are no fewer than 70 <br/>
churches in Aiken, and on Sunday most of their seats are filled. When the <br/>
city was originally laid out in an English grid style, each denomination was <br/>
given a whole city block to start its church.  <br/>

Bible Belt n :<br/>
areas in southern U.S. (North Carolina, South Caroline, Georgia, Tennessee, <br/>
Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Kansas). See also Borscht Belt, Corn Belt, and <br/>

NOUN:   Those sections of the United States, especially in the South and <br/>
Middle West, where Protestant fundamentalism is widely practiced. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
VERY CREEPY but right on target for us:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Southern Evangelicals argued the same case with respect to children. <br/>
Surely no sane person would claim that children were equal to adults or that <br/>
they should not be subject to adult discipline. And these religious leaders <br/>
then went on to claim that black people were really children that had never <br/>
grown up-a belief that was widely held, even among abolitionists. The <br/>
conclusion was that blacks needed the same supervision and correction as <br/>
children.-=-<br/>

<br/>
From the same long history of religion in the south, about prayer meetings <br/>
and the Civil War:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;When the Civil War finally came, it turned out to be the most religious war <br/>
in U.S. history. Both armies sponsored revivals and prayer meetings. Here is <br/>
a little sample from the diary of a Southern Methodist chaplain:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There was preaching in Dalton every night but four, for four months; and in <br/>
the camps all around the city, preaching and prayer meetings occurred every <br/>
night. The soldiers erected stands, improvised seats, and even built log <br/>
churches, where they worshipped God in spirit and in truth. The result was <br/>
that thousands were happily converted and were prepared for the future that <br/>
awaited them. Officers and enlisted men alike were brought under religious <br/>
influence.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
End of that article:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; They comforted the Southern whites not only by telling them that they were <br/>
superior to blacks, but also that they were morally superior to Northern <br/>
whites, who were less religious than they. For after all, you can&#39;t be moral <br/>
if you&#39;re not religious; can you?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The three Southern Evangelical churches achieved great success with this <br/>
message, and by 1890 they accounted for 95 per cent of all Southern church <br/>
members. And their heritage lives on. Today we are still confronted with <br/>
Southern Evangelicals who claim that belief in the literal truth of the <br/>
Bible, the subordination of women, the physical abuse of children and a <br/>
narrow view of the role of the state as merely a system of criminal justice <br/>
have all been ordained by God. And none of them will acknowledge-nor do very <br/>
many even remember-that their religion arose from the theological defense of <br/>
slavery.&gt;&gt;</div>

My best friend Shea lives in Aiken County SC, and is a non-spanker and<br/>
NCPer.  When I think I have it tough living where I do and wrestling with<br/>
this stuff, constantly having to defend my parenting practices, I just thank<br/>
my lucky stars I don&#39;t live where she does.  Some of the stories she has to<br/>
tell are unbelievable.<br/>
