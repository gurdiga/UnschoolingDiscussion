<div id="ygrps-yiv-707760985">Subject: Radio Program on Creation Science 11/24<br/>
<br/>
WHAT: Special  Creation Science Focus<br/>
WHERE: Christian Talk 660AM <br/>
WHEN: Wed., Nov. 24,  7:00am-8:00am<br/>
WHO: Dr. Tony Beam and Dr. John Cobin interview Dr. Albert  Anderson of<br/>
Greenville, SC. Dr. Anderson is a local medical doctor who has  studied<br/>
the creation science issue for over 30 years. He is very  knowledgeable in<br/>
the area of the origin of the races and genetics. This past  week two<br/>
13-year old home schoolers called it. They did a GREAT job! On  Tuesday,<br/>
Nov. 30, Dr. Stuart Patterson, professor emeritus and chairman of  the<br/>
chemistry department at Furman University, will be the featured  guest.<br/>
Drs. Anderson and Patterson are both young Earth creationists and  members<br/>
of the Creation Study Group board. You don&#39;t want to miss  this<br/>
opportunity to get the facts and call in with your questions!<br/>
<br/>
Dr.  Beam, a professor a North Greenville College, heads the Christian<br/>
World view  Center at NGC. Dr. Cobin has his Ph.D. in public policy from<br/>
George Mason  University and studied under Dr. Walter Williams who is a<br/>
frequent guest host  on the Rush Limbaugh Show with over 20 million<br/>
listeners per week. If you  have already listened to their show, you know<br/>
how informative it is. It truly  challenges your thinking. <br/>
<br/>
This one-hour segment each morning is  informative and thought-provoking.<br/>
They often deal with the issue of  creation, since Biblical creation is<br/>
the foundation of a truly Biblical world  and life view.  Turn the radio<br/>
on while you are eating breakfast with  the children.<br/>
<br/>
If you have already been listening, let the radio station  know you<br/>
appreciate the program. If we are to keep this genre of  high-quality,<br/>
Bible-based, strongly apologetic programming on the air, they  need to<br/>
hear from you. Email your comments, questions, encouragement to  Duane<br/>
Corn, operations manager,  at:<br/>

again to hear Dr. Stuart  Patterson on Tuesday, November 30, 7:00am. <br/>
