I don&#39;t have asthma (thankfully) but my husband and I both suffer from<br/>
numerous allergies. I don&#39;t know what conditions would make asthma better or<br/>
worse except maybe air quality?  Around the Puget Sound area there&#39;s quite a<br/>
variety of that. Good days and bad days...good areas and bad.  Sometimes the<br/>
readings are off the scale in allergens like trees and grasses and mold. Do<br/>
any of those things make yours worse? We do have a lot of rain, of course. I<br/>
know quite a few people here with asthma and they seem to get by with<br/>
medication.<br/>
