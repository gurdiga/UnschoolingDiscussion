&lt;&lt; I responded with - hopefully natural learning - I&#39;ll just follow the leads <br/>
of my children - to which I was told that this was unschooling - well I am <br/>
totally niave when it comes to labelling as I always thought that unschooling <br/>
was taking children out of school and trying to reverse it&#39;s affects &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think &quot;natural learning&quot; is the more proper and widely-used term in <br/>
Australia.  <br/>
<br/>
The reversal of school affects is usually called &quot;deschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I always assumed that the first 7 years of a childs&#39; life is about play and <br/>
I wasn&#39;t preparing myself to teach them to read or write or count out of the <br/>
ordinary - ie/ when baking a cake we would count eggs or when collecting <br/>
rocks we would count rocks but I haven&#39;t gone out of my way as to sit their <br/>
and try and teach Cam to read etc.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nothing changes at seven.  By then either he&#39;ll be starting to read or he <br/>
won&#39;t be ready yet.   By then you&#39;ll have been doing this for years and won&#39;t <br/>
be worried about it!  <br/>
I think your plan to wait is a good one!<br/>
<br/>
School pushes reading so they can push little-kid textbooks and readers.  The <br/>
information in those is often lame.  But as long as his input comes from <br/>
people who are better readers than he is he won&#39;t be limited to baby-stuff, <br/>
but can hear REAL stories with big words, lofty ideas, funny passages, and <br/>
not be dependent on one-syllable &quot;see Bob sit&quot; junk.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-742333156">Thanks Sandra and Rue for the sites - they are excellent and I am <br/>
looking forward to checking them out more. I am so greatful to those <br/>
who put a lot of their energies into these sites as they are such a <br/>
blessing to families and children who benefit from them.<br/>
<br/>
To Shellie who asked about if anyone experienced rabid <br/>
antihomeschoolers - yes I have with the comments of - in reply to my <br/>
saying that I am homeschooling - &quot;Oh your a bloody idiot&quot; from my <br/>
dear father. Actually we shifted from one side of Australia to the <br/>
other - away from family - so that we could homeschool in peace and <br/>
without the questioning and judgement. I have two nephews the same <br/>
age as my 3 1/2 year old son and the comparisons that were always <br/>
being made - well there was no way on earth that my partner and <br/>
myself were going to place our son in the situation of constantly <br/>
being compared with them as I know that he will be a late developer <br/>
when it comes to reading and writing etc - he shows no interest and <br/>
just wants to play all the time.<br/>
<br/>
BTW Sandra your comment on my statement<br/>

play ...<br/>
<br/>

changing my ways of thinking there are still parts that are still <br/>
conditioned - I have an undergrat degree in psych and that is what we <br/>

<br/>
I love the way you describe Josephines name - I am going to put that <br/>
in her book where I write letters to her. I actually sing that <br/>
song &quot;delta Dawn&quot; to her and one line says &quot;Delta Dawn what&#39;s that <br/>
flower you have on - could it be a faded rose of days gone by&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Anyway I chose the name Josephine because I had only ever known two <br/>
Josephines in life and both girls (from school days) were just <br/>
beautiful people in every way plus it is a feel good strong name to <br/>
me.<br/>

<br/>
With Piaget&#39;s stages of development (if that&#39;s the ages you&#39;re talking <br/>
about), those things are a range--some kids come early to one or late, some <br/>
stay in one a LONG time, some zip by.  But if there is any reality to the <br/>
theory (and I think there is) then the child will process information <br/>
differently on his own, with no change in the parental input.  You won&#39;t <br/>
really have the need to know that he&#39;s reached another stage in his <br/>
understanding, because with unschooling, you probably wouldn&#39;t have done <br/>
anything differently ANYway.  <br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;re welcome! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Great-great Aunt Josephine.  She was a poet and a self-proclaimed <br/>
&quot;adventurer&quot;.  I have a newspaper clipping - very old and yellowed - about <br/>
her climbing Mt. Fuji in Japan when she was 90 years old.  When asked why she <br/>

Now Sandra,,,you don&#39;t think that a person who is interested in unschooling<br/>
would be able to just read the unschooling parts? &lt;g&gt;   I know when I go to<br/>
a web site I have to click on most things just to see what&#39;s there.<br/>
And I know some of your other parts are still helpful in coming around to an<br/>

I know it was immensely helpful to me.    If anything, it was a glimpse into<br/>
an unschooling family&#39;s life.  This was very important to me since I knew no<br/>

understand what we&#39;re doing but I have a huge curiousity about how those <br/>
of you who have been living this way for a long time actually live day <br/>
to day.  I&#39;m just reading Frank Smith&#39;s &quot;The Book of  Learning and <br/>
Forgetting&quot; and he talks about joining clubs and how we do that to learn <br/>
and reaffirm our own identities as well as define ourselves.  Online <br/>
clubs etc are great because it is possible to find people who we really <br/>
share beliefs and concerns, however in most cases, if you stop posting, <br/>
nobody notices which takes the humanity right out of it.  By getting to <br/>
know more about the details of each others lives, we are forming more <br/>
intricate relationships.  So I always love hearing about the things you <br/>
all do and how and where you live.  It makes each of you so much more <br/>
real to me.  Plus,  I can&#39;t wait to go to the conference to really meet <br/>
as many of you as I can...so I can put &quot;names to your faces!&quot;<br/>

Hi Laurie,<br/>
<br/>
Start by not worrying.&lt;g&gt;   Live today and tomorrow and every day that<br/>
follows with your son as if you were on the best summer vacation ever.  <br/>
Find out what he enjoys doing and help him find ways to do it.   <br/>
Go to the beach, take a hike, go to the zoo, or OMSI.  Go see a play, a<br/>
movie, a concert.  Whatever he enjoys and you can manage, do that. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about curriculum.   They&#39;re expensive and boring and designed<br/>
by people who don&#39;t know your son and what he likes to do.   If Levi is<br/>
alive, he&#39;s learning all the time.   He&#39;s learning what he needs.  Give<br/>
him an interesting world to explore and new things to do and see, and<br/>
forget curriculum.   <br/>

Find other unschoolers near you if you can.  If you can&#39;t, stay on these<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-412115704">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am new on the list. My name is Sue and I have 2 children Cameron 3 1/2 yrs old and Josephine 20 months. We live in Brisbane Australia and my partner Kevin and myself are interested in homeschooling our children. We practice attachment parenting and found that we had to make a complete life change once we had our children ie/ Kev has given away the corporate life so as to spend more time with the family and we have moved from one side of Australia to the other to incorporate travel in our children&#39;s and our lives.<br/>
<br/>
Recently I was asked how I have planned to homeschool my children etc. and I responded with - hopefully natural learning - I&#39;ll just follow the leads of my children - to which I was told that this was unschooling - well I am totally niave when it comes to labelling as I always thought that unschooling was taking children out of school and trying to reverse it&#39;s affects and that homeschooling was that your children learn at home with there being many different options - ie/ curriculum, natural learning etc.<br/>
<br/>
I can only gather from reading the last few emails on this list that I was wrong in my thoughts and I am looking forward to reading and learning more. My hope is that I want to be able to follow my childrens lead - so far we go on lots of nature walks because that is what they and we as a family love to do, and the kids just play. I always assumed that the first 7 years of a childs&#39; life is about play and I wasn&#39;t preparing myself to teach them to read or write or count out of the ordinary - ie/ when baking a cake we would count eggs or when collecting rocks we would count rocks but I haven&#39;t gone out of my way as to sit their and try and teach Cam to read etc.<br/>
<br/>
 We do lots of reading ourselves so they see their parents reading a lot but Cam doesn&#39;t show the interest in it - my daughter however does. So, I was just going to follow their lead and if it took Cameron until he was 10 to take an interest - well then so be it. At the moment he is interested in the stars and the moon and he saw a telescope in a magazine that I had. He asked what it was and I told him and then he said that he wanted one so that we can look at the stars at night and go camping. So, since all of us where interested in it we have decided to save our pennies together and this has created even more interest for him and bonded us all the more. <br/>
<br/>
At the moment Cam gets $3 per week - we bank half of it and the other half he saves for things like the telescope or for a ride at the shop. We introduced this method as everytime we went to the shop he would perform wanting everything - so we decided to give him his own money and so when he wanted something we told him that he would have to save for it. - it has worked wonders because now we don&#39;t have the tantrums because he knows that he has a means now for obtaining it (well not as many tantrums &lt;lol&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I know my children are young but since I am new at this I still have some concerns that maybe I am going about things wrong ie/ am I being too laxed in their education, should I be teaching them to read soon, am I missing out on the window period or are there any helpful hints and suggestions that anyone can provide for me in the natural learning way?<br/>
<br/>
I do get these doubts every now and then that I may be doing it all wrong so any input will be helpful and I am not the least bit worried about someone being very blunt or direct with me as challenge to ones belief is always on the path to better understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Now to check out what unschooling is all about - thanks for listening<br/>
<br/>
Sue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808540766">Sue, it sounds like a strong name to me too.  I chose it because of my <br/>
  Great-great Aunt Josephine.  She was a poet and a self-proclaimed <br/>
  &quot;adventurer&quot;.  I have a newspaper clipping - very old and yellowed - about <br/>
  her climbing Mt. Fuji in Japan when she was 90 years old.  When asked why she <br/>
  did it, she replied, &quot;because I never had before&quot;.  : )<br/>
<br/>
  I just love that - isn&#39;t it amazing how a name can hold so much value. I have had a lot of positive responses from people when they ask what my daughters&#39; name is and I can see immediately how that positive energy transfers over to my daughter. With my son his name is Cameron and he is full of sooo much energy ( alot more than most people can handle) and my family nicknamed him Camacazzie - I felt that this had negative connations attached when they would call him that in front of people we had only just met. I felt that an unfair judgement would be predetermined just from the name so I had to ask them to stop calling him that as I did not like the label and what it implied.<br/>
