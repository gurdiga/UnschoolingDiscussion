The first couple of paragraphs:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;THERE&#39;S no such thing as public education. Education happens to exactly one<br/>
person at a time.<br/>
<br/>
There are some things that you just have to do by yourself. Even if I&#39;m your<br/>
teacher, you can&#39;t have my education; your education is a private task that<br/>
is given to yourself.<br/>
<br/>
The education of someone or everyone else doesn&#39;t add a single item to your<br/>
stock of knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s no such thing as compulsory education. Education is something<br/>
that each of us gives to ourselves or allows others to give us. Otherwise we<br/>
call it indoctrination or assault; we don&#39;t call it knowledge.&quot;<br/>
