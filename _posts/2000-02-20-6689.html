&lt;&lt;O.K., now remember I am severly cyber-challenged.  If you meant, go click<br/>
<br/>
on the thingy at the bottom of this page and wait until the home page comes<br/>
<br/>
up, well it took about 1 minute and I have a possibly terminally ill<br/>
<br/>
computer who is going in on Monday to get a new motherboard and memory<br/>
<br/>
chip.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It took me 45 seconds and got nowhere (no percentage loaded), so I bailed <br/>
out. This was not a typical load time, and perhaps the server was having a <br/>
problem when I did this.<br/>
