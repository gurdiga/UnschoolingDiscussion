<div id="ygrps-yiv-336231059">Interesting, but doesn&#39;t seem to understand what unschooling really means.  It certainly is NOT leaving kids on their own!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Indeed, given the temptations and distractions of everyday life, is it unreasonable to wonder how much kids can really learn when just left up to their own devices? Conventional wisdom tells us that when not compelled to study the basics of reading and writing and arithmetic, the average kid will fritter away the day playing video games and flipping TV stations. And while unschoolers argue that that is an unfairly pessimistic take on children&#39;s curiosity and innate abilities, it would be hard for them to deny that their approach can lead to the acquisition of idiosyncratic skills. When she went off to her freshman year in college, Laurie Chancey was already a gifted computer programmer -- but struggled to get through a class in remedial math.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Never mind that many school children struggle with math and few are gifted computer programmers.<br/>
<br/>
I like the end quote: &quot;I mean, at some point, people stop asking what grade you&#39;re in.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;m not a member of salon.com, I had to click on an advertisement in order to read the complete article.  I didn&#39;t have to watch the ad, I just had to wait until it was over.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868732042">Somebody posted the entire article on another list<br/>
that I&#39;m on. I thought it was surprisingly positive.<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m being cynical, but most of the article on<br/>
homeschooling that I&#39;ve seen have had a more negative<br/>
slant than this.<br/>
<br/>
The criticisms are interesting because they help me<br/>
clarify my goals. For example,<br/>
&quot;And while unschoolers argue that that is an unfairly<br/>
pessimistic take on children&#39;s curiosity and innate<br/>
abilities, it would be hard for them to deny that<br/>
their approach can lead to the acquisition of<br/>
idiosyncratic skills.&quot;<br/>
What is wrong with idiosyncratic skills? Do we want<br/>
cookie-cutter education for everyone? I don&#39;t think<br/>
so. I see this as an advantage, rather than a<br/>
disadavantage of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s infinitely better to take a year of<br/>
remdial math instead of 12 years of boredom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565288809">Sandra, I wanted to let you know that I read your response to the<br/>
slander and appreciated the fact that you took &quot;whoever&quot; to task for<br/>
misrepresenting your family&#39;s experience. I have really appreciated<br/>
the honest and personal look inside your lives that helps me to be<br/>
brave about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
One small idea popped into my head as I read it and I thought I&#39;d pass<br/>
it along to you (since I&#39;m pretty sure the idea originated with one or<br/>
other of your posts anyway). The way this person chose to represent<br/>
you was based entirely on a belief that the measurements of the school<br/>
system are an accurate reflection of the vaidlity of unschooling. She<br/>
thought that if your son *had* been in remedial classes, that fact<br/>
somehow invalidated unschooling as an adequate choice for your kids&#39;<br/>
education.<br/>
<br/>
Yet what I have had to get over personally is the idea that good<br/>
grades in a classroom is what successful home education is all about.<br/>
You were right to give her the facts of Kirby&#39;s success, but I wanted<br/>
to shout at her as well: Remedial classes don&#39;t &quot;prove&quot; that<br/>
unschooling is a bad option for home education.<br/>
<br/>
Rather, what makes me continue in this lifestyle is the awareness I<br/>
have of the privilege it is to be with my kids, to be their friend, to<br/>
help them become the people they ought to be... kind, caring,<br/>
compassionate, curious, enthusiastic, attentive, and competent in the<br/>
arenas that matter to them.<br/>
<br/>
I have one who is not ready for college taking a college course! It&#39;s<br/>
tough for him, but his interest holds him there. The rest of the<br/>
students in class groan every week... he bounds in like a puppy and<br/>
leaves energized and full of good thoughts and ideas. He is behind in<br/>
the work and isn&#39;t good at the self-discipline yet. But he loves learning.<br/>
<br/>
So what does that mean?<br/>
<br/>
It means to me that he is still in control of his life... figuring out<br/>
what matters enough to stick to it and grow, not numb to the<br/>
opportunity but thoroughly conditioned to perform anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m saying is that I have appreciated all the times<br/>
you&#39;ve refocused the discussion on the quality of life that<br/>
unschooling affords... while we&#39;re living it... that the goal isn&#39;t to<br/>
outperform our friends&#39; schooled peers, but to create an individual<br/>
family environment where each person is loved, attended to and<br/>
stimulated to become who he or she is meant to be.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Sandra.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, but a pretty good take for &quot;the general public&quot;-not too attacking and <br/>
over-the-top. I didn&#39;t read &quot;leaving kids on their own&quot;-which to me, means <br/>
&quot;alone&quot;. &quot;Left to their own devices&quot; is twisting the &quot;child led learning&quot; aspect of <br/>
it, but again, general public... They DID let the unschoolers have their say <br/>
to clarify...<br/>
<br/>
Conventional wisdom tells us that when not compelled to study the basics of <br/>
reading and writing and arithmetic, the average kid will fritter away the day <br/>
playing video games and flipping TV stations. <br/>
Personally, for me, &quot;the average kid&quot; is a B&MS kid, who&#39;s parents, teachers, <br/>
family members, etc. see video games and t.v. as evil/bad and something that <br/>
IS &quot;frittering away&quot;-to be limited. From my perspective, unschooled kids are <br/>
shown how to learn from t.v. and video games-make the most of the media-hence, <br/>
they&#39;re NOT &quot;the average kid&quot; and so it just doesn&#39;t apply.<br/>
<br/>
I liked that quote, too.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how it was with Kirby, except he did the homework  faithfully.  He <br/>
bounded into class, and he bounded home to do  homework.  And although he didn&#39;t <br/>
like the frustration at first, he found  people to help him because he KNEW <br/>
already that it can help to hear  explanations from more than one source.  <br/>
Teachers often discourage that,  and try to make themselves the sole source.<br/>
 <br/>
For all those kids who HAD gone to public school, it was a remedial  math <br/>
class.  For Kirby, it was a first-ever math class, and he didn&#39;t  test in at the <br/>
bottom level.  THAT is the point I was trying to  make.  For Kirby, it wasn&#39;t <br/>
remedial. &lt;g&gt;  It was not for  college credit, but having aced that one he can <br/>
take 120.  Some who were  in his class still have to take one more class <br/>
before they can take 120.   <br/>
<br/>
So in review. . . &lt;g&gt;  Some who went to school for 13  years have to take two <br/>
or three pre-credit classes.  Kirby without a  single math lesson in 18 years <br/>
took one of them.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for the kind words.  I was stunned that she would resort fo  flat-out <br/>
LYING to discredit me.<br/>

If her goal is to discredit you - and from what I&#39;ve read of her<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017837061">Overall I saw some good things in this article about unschooling by <br/>
unschoolers.  I did find the following remark to be rather incensing<br/>
and <br/>
ridiculously hilarious at the same time: <br/>
<br/>
Gail Paquette, a home-schooling mother of two and the founder of the<br/>
Web <br/>
site Hometaught.com(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hometaught.com/)">http://www.hometaught.com/)</a>, is one of<br/>
unschooling&#39;s <br/>
most vocal critics. &quot;A child-led approach may develop the child&#39;s <br/>
strengths but does nothing to develop his weaknesses and broaden his <br/>
horizons,&quot; she writes. &quot;I [mostly] disagree with the premise that <br/>
children can teach themselves what they want to learn, when (and if) <br/>
they want to learn it. Certainly children do learn some things on their<br/>
<br/>
own, but their often roundabout way of going at learning is not <br/>
necessarily the best way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The phrase &quot;develop his weaknesses&quot; really stuck out.  Why would anyone<br/>
<br/>
want to do that?  Sounds like this metaphor has children being log <br/>
houses that lack chinking for the gaps in their development.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think you need to be well-rounded or fill every space to be successful.<br/>
 <br/>
For so many people, it&#39;s not even a possibility.  It&#39;s just <br/>
homogenization.  It would also seem to me that it&#39;s schooled children <br/>
whose horizons are narrow, not the other way around.  School, as most<br/>
of <br/>
us know who&#39;ve experienced it, is nothing but an endless round of rote <br/>
assignments from highly censored textbooks.  It wasn&#39;t until we <br/>
graduated or left school that we had more opportunity as adults to fill<br/>
<br/>
in the gaps that were curious blank at school.  If I drummed up the <br/>
courage to ask questions, I knew the ones I asked had to be properly <br/>
phrased and filtered if I were to expect approval or to be taken <br/>
seriously.  In other words, I knew better than to ask too many real <br/>
questions, ie., ones I wanted the answers to.<br/>

I would guess that the author meant that if Johnny has a hard time with<br/>
spelling, that he isn&#39;t going to put the effort in to learn to spell on his<br/>
own.  She doesn&#39;t understand how strong a drive can be to perfect something<br/>
for some intrinsic reason instead of an extrinsic motivator.  I think she<br/>
thinks that if something is hard, then kids won&#39;t do it.  I have not found<br/>
that with my own children.  When they decide something is important to them,<br/>

<br/>
We had a park day discussion related to this this week.<br/>
<br/>
A kid who hates to make mistakes will learn almost sureptitiously, and possibly on a &quot;delayed&quot; timetable, and won&#39;t show progress (or maybe even visible effort) until the task is mastered. This can give the impression that the child isn&#39;t &quot;working&quot;, but the child probably is working internally. <br/>
<br/>
An example: a friend&#39;s one year old fell down the first time she tried to walk, so she avoided walking without something to hold on to (like a parent&#39;s hands) for several weeks, and then she took off running. <br/>
