Your site for studying religions is great...keep up the good work. <br/>
<br/>
Have you come across any books regarding the Celts and their beliefs?? We<br/>
are studying the medieval period right now. Christianity was pervasive but<br/>
the &#39;other&#39; beliefs still had a presence.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas? <br/>
