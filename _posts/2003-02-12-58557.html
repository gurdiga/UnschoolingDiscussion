Oh yuck! They not only recommend taking away all the kids toys, they <br/>
advocate lying about it and saying the &quot;magical toy fairy&quot; came<br/>
and did it. Here&#39;s a quote: &quot;The secret is, if &quot;you&quot; are not <br/>
responsible...and a fairy (or elf, or gnome) did it...then it MUST be best!&quot; <br/>
But a<br/>
fairy DID NOT really do it and the parent IS responsible. Where does that <br/>
leave us?<br/>

Back in my former schooling-mom life, I sent my son to a Waldorf inspired <br/>

only one right way for children to &quot;progress&quot; and they apparently had the <br/>

questioned my son&#39;s &quot;extended&quot; nursing was someone in the Waldorf <br/>
community.  Even my folks (whose children were exclusively bottle-fed) <br/>
never gave me the hairy eyeball about my breastfeeding <br/>
6-year-old!  Weird!  In fact, back in 1994 a friend of mine had gone to a <br/>
Waldorf community doctor who had told her that children must be weaned on <br/>
their first birthday, not before and not after!  It had something to do <br/>
with the kid&#39;s ethereal body getting tangled up in the mom&#39;s ethereal body.<br/>

kid all tangled up with your PHYSICAL body for 1 year and 9 months (that&#39;s <br/>
1.75 years, folks) &lt;bweg&gt; and if we permit this entanglement to go on 1.76 <br/>
years (or, maybe it&#39;s even 1.751 years, but I wouldn&#39;t want to worry <br/>
anyone) or longer, our ethereal bodies become hopelessly knotted up with <br/>
our kids&#39;, and that leads to all kinds of horrendous, messy sorting-out <br/>
problems.  Who knew the risks involved?  I mean, there ought to be a <br/>
warning label on sex!  (Hmmm, that&#39;s not a bad idea, now that I think of it.)<br/>

Motherhood is such a MESSY business.<br/>

of the Waldorf ideas but don&#39;t go in for their rigidity.  My daughter, for<br/>
instance, is attracted to all the nature, art, and music stuff that they do.<br/>
She also doesn&#39;t care much for the plastic stuff, but she would never take<br/>
the stuff away from her kids.  She buys wooden toys and simple dolls for<br/>
them but also things that they want that she doesn&#39;t much like.  (And she&#39;s<br/>
the one who was still nursing her daughter at age 6.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-692110297">Dear listmates,<br/>
I feel compelled to say that all three of my children attended a small<br/>
Waldorf School during some of their elementary years - the experience was<br/>
rich and fun for 2 out of the 3 of them. We never discarded our beloved<br/>
plastic toys, nor did I feel that I had to take any teacher or<br/>
adminstrator&#39;s opinions about my children as anything other than their<br/>
opinion. I stayed true to my relationship with them throughout. I think we<br/>
need to be careful to not belittle nor negate an entire educational path<br/>
with some out-of-context Steiner quotes or the few negative experiences of<br/>
some folks. Each Waldorf School is a different entity, each person&#39;s<br/>
experience of it also different. Just as we would not like unschooling to<br/>
be judged someone who has seen a family in neglectful bedlam who calls<br/>
their path unschooling. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-228189915">I personally prefer wood toys and all natural toys over plastic.  I think<br/>
in general they have more staying power. (However we have a lot of both.)<br/>
For instance, a wooden doll house is apt to be used by a teenager as well as<br/>
a six year old, and kept into adulthood, passed down through the generations<br/>
  I wish we had a brio train set as opposed to the plastic one we have now. <br/>
My children like it, but it is less packable for Israel, to tell the truth<br/>
and we may have to leave it behind because of the volume.<br/>

Most educational philosphies have some good points and some bad.  The method<br/>
of teaching reading, for instance, Waldorf style is very relaxed and sounds<br/>
kind of fun....(Draw a mountain for the letter M for instance.) That doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean it is for everyone.(The reading method).  Certainly, being Jewish, I<br/>
object to a lot of their philosophy. And having nursed all but one  of my<br/>
children till age 4, I don&#39;t buy into their nursing ideas and relationship<br/>
ideas either. (well, all but two but my last is almost four)<br/>
<br/>
I find it best to pick what works for my children, and makes them happy.<br/>
<br/>
Same with Charlotte Mason.  I do think that for some children BOB books and<br/>
the ilk are the worst types of books to learn to read with (even if child<br/>
led, that is waiting till the child asks).  Many children do better by<br/>
*real* books that have something to say rather than simply teach phonics. <br/>
But their are children out there that want the phonics...<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Waldorf Toys<br/>
 <br/>
Dear listmates,<br/>
I feel compelled to say that all three of my children attended a small<br/>
Waldorf School during some of their elementary years - the experience was<br/>
rich and fun for 2 out of the 3 of them. We never discarded our beloved<br/>
plastic toys, nor did I feel that I had to take any teacher or<br/>
adminstrator&#39;s opinions about my children as anything other than their<br/>
opinion. I stayed true to my relationship with them throughout. I think we<br/>
need to be careful to not belittle nor negate an entire educational path<br/>
with some out-of-context Steiner quotes or the few negative experiences of<br/>
some folks. Each Waldorf School is a different entity, each person&#39;s<br/>
experience of it also different. Just as we would not like unschooling to<br/>
be judged someone who has seen a family in neglectful bedlam who calls<br/>
their path unschooling. <br/>
In respect and aloha, Lee<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s all true.<br/>
<br/>
But I think there is a systemic dishonesty in the training and execution of <br/>
Waldorf education when the teachers know but don&#39;t admit that there is a <br/>
weird spiritual basis for particulars of their curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
If you have that Steiner quote in context, I&#39;d be glad to read it.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the stuff is really pretty.  Lots of my kids&#39; early toys came from <br/>
Hearthsong catalog, which was pretty thoroughly Waldorf stuff.  I have <br/>
nothing against wet-on-wet painting or music or silk scarves or kids learning <br/>
to knit and to make things together.<br/>
<br/>
I have issues with dishonesty, and when the whole system is presented as an <br/>
ostensibly cognitive-development based program when it&#39;s actually a <br/>
spiritually based program, I think the teachers are modelling dishonesty from <br/>
the get go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432395603">with my last child we took a mommy and child preschool class, we got kicked out of group circle music time because my son actually reacted to the singing by dancing. we were asked to sit out because of a natural reaction, that initself is such a contradiction to some of there child led philosophies. I also nursed when i pleased he was 3 then, nursed til 5, of course they thought of me as some sort of waldorf rebel. I do however like the natural toys approach, play with things of the earth, but that could be of my native american approach too. So in point we should, i feel, do whatever feels right......both to us and our children. We are not perfect and I do not believe there is ONE way to parent.........JUST BE WHO WE ARE AND WHAT FEELS RIGHT, hopefully it will turn out well. We do our best.  By the way I have many Waldorf books to sell, lol, if anyone is interested. Last but not least I feel we can pull many philosophies together as I have done, learn something from everyone, that has helped me alot over the years. But listening to our instincts is really important therefore knowing where to draw then line as I have read many of you have done well when it came to the Waldorf approach.  Peace and Blessings......Blackwolf<br/>

Oh yuck! They not only recommend taking away all the kids toys, they <br/>
advocate lying about it and saying the &quot;magical toy fairy&quot; came<br/>
and did it. Here&#39;s a quote: &quot;The secret is, if &quot;you&quot; are not <br/>
responsible...and a fairy (or elf, or gnome) did it...then it MUST be best!&quot; <br/>
But a<br/>
fairy DID NOT really do it and the parent IS responsible. Where does that <br/>
leave us?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;d been looking into the Waldorf approach...seems to come with the AP <br/>
 </span></blockquote>territory...but this sort of thing is enough to turn me off<br/>
completely. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Back in my former schooling-mom life, I sent my son to a Waldorf inspired <br/>
school. It was very dogmatic and controlling. There was<br/>
only one right way for children to &quot;progress&quot; and they apparently had the <br/>
answer. It was NOT a nurturing time for us.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree, that was a really horrifying article to read. I think if I <br/>
did this to my kids, they would experience a deep and profound grief <br/>
that I could never erase. My son has an entire world of &quot;Ojos&quot;, his <br/>
name for his group of Lego people. Each Lego person has his own <br/>
specific attributes, personality, job in the &quot;Ojo&quot; world, etc. and <br/>
they are so important to him that when other kids come over, he asks <br/>
me to put them up. A couple of times, kids who didn&#39;t understand his <br/>
universe did things like switched heads and bodies of the Ojos <br/>
around. Perfectly normal thing to do, but to him it was like they&#39;d <br/>
just decapitated his best friends, he was horrified. It took us <br/>
two hours to get all the little people sorted out and back to normal. <br/>
So I can imagine that if the toy fairy just disappeared them all, he <br/>
would 1) Never want to see or hear about another fairy in his life, <br/>
good or bad, 2) Never trust me again, let alone probably another <br/>
human being, and 3) Grieve as if those little people were really dead <br/>
(which to him, they would be). What a terrible thing to do to a child.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I have to admit, I understand the temptation. I used to think <br/>
Waldorf was a grand idea, and had visions of my children&#39;s tidy, <br/>
pastel-painted room with playsilks and stands and twigs and nuts <br/>
around in nifty little baskets, them playing lovingly with their hand-<br/>
crafted dolls. So, walking through the plastic jungle of <br/>
transformers, Bionicles, and action figures is a bit of a shock, but <br/>
it&#39;s their stuff and it matters to them, so that&#39;s what counts. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the folks who wrote this article need an idealism fairy to come <br/>
into their head and pack all that nonsense away :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-789751155">I guess my experience of Waldorf education was so positive in that it was<br/>
not cloaked in any sort of secrecy about Anthroposophy (that weird<br/>
spiritual thing!) being the underpinning of the scene. It did not threaten<br/>
me - it did not scare me - it did not even affect me nor my children&#39;s<br/>
experience. What did make it a solid and deep experience was the reverence<br/>
and respect for my children and their process shown by their various<br/>
teachers.<br/>
