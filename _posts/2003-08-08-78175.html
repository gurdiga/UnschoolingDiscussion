I think you are becoming blurred in your sensibilites as to what is<br/>
generally acceptable, by what is acceptable in your own home.<br/>
<br/>
There is a difference. A big difference !<br/>
<br/>
Try going to a toddler group, or anywhere where parents are with their young<br/>
children, and call one of the other children a slug, and see what reaction<br/>
you get !<br/>

&gt; &quot;Doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t love them.  Doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t take care of htem.<br/>
&gt; Doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m a bad person.  Just means babies don&#39;t thrill me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kelly&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Exactly.<br/>
&gt; My dh does not care for the baby stage. That doesn&#39;t mean he does not<br/>
ADORE his own children from the moment he laid eyes on them, it means he<br/>
enjoys other stages better. It&#39;s not a crime to enjoy certain stages more<br/>
than others. And it doesn&#39;t lessen the love you feel for your own children<br/>
in any way.<br/>
&gt; I happen to adore toddlers. Chubby, cute, silly-talking, busy toddlers.<br/>
Especially that really kissable place right underneath their chin.<br/>
Mmmmmm....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And the slug comment? OH PLEASE! Slug means SLOW MOVING...as in Sluggish.<br/>
My dh often says &quot;I feel like such a slug today&quot; when he&#39;s feeling slow and<br/>
tired. It was a total JOKE. If you found it in poor taste, then I venture to<br/>
say that there is a lot of humor that you might want to ignore.  I happen to<br/>
know Kelly respects her children deeply and intensely and is not<br/>
disrespectful to anyone elses children either. My very busy babsy boy felt<br/>
very comfortable and loved at the conference last year, he&#39;ll be there again<br/>
this year.<br/>
&gt; We stayed with the Lovejoys for a couple of nights and felt completely at<br/>
ease, welcomed and all filled up with joy when we left.<br/>
&gt; Babies ARE slugs...not in a bad way, it wasn&#39;t meant as a put down.<br/>
Sheesh.<br/>

I think tone of voice is obviously REALLY important and people should <br/>
remember it is all in their own heads if they haven&#39;t met the other <br/>
person in real life.<br/>
<br/>
So - think of &quot;You little slug, you&quot; in a warm cuddly lovey-dovey voice <br/>
while mommy is gazing into sweet little baby&#39;s eyes.<br/>
