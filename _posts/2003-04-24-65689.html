<br/>
<br/>
I am a proud mommy of a hyperactive 4 year old who has a tendancy to <br/>
go on a verbal whiney rampage at least daily regarding something I <br/>
usually cannot change to his satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned to give myself a mental vacation during these times. I <br/>
have learned to block out the unimportant complaining. Then when a <br/>
legitimate complaint comes forth like &quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot; I am all ears <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
It takes practice, but if you could live thru the discomfort of <br/>
bearing this child into the world, you can train yourself to have <br/>
selective hearing.  Men have this inherantly. The last time I told my <br/>
husband to pick up his socks, he used this selective hearing and the <br/>
socks remained there. If I were to tell him someone was choking on a <br/>
lego, then he&#39;d be there so quick! Thus the glories of selective <br/>
hearing.  <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t work all the time.  The husband still can&#39;t use his to <br/>
block out the loudness of the kids at play when he&#39;s trying to <br/>
concentrate on something.  I usually choose not to take that time to <br/>
do anything and let the kids have their fun.  But still...<br/>
<br/>
The whining is not playtime noise.  It is meant to get mom&#39;s <br/>
attention.  It is like a siren.  A bell.  A signal that something is <br/>
not right.  <br/>
<br/>
Babies cry, little kids whine, older kids complain and adults vent. <br/>
Ah, the glories of communication.  We are human and we are never <br/>
fully satisfied with things.  That&#39;s why we are capable of adaptation <br/>
and changing. <br/>
<br/>
Little kids don&#39;t have the aptitude yet to understand the world <br/>
around them fully; what they can change and what they cannot and how <br/>
to adapt to any of it. So they whine.<br/>
<br/>
Moms are a bit different.  We can understand the difference between <br/>
these things and we are pros at adaptation.  We also understand when <br/>
a child is just whiney or when it is a serious need requiring our <br/>
attentiveness.<br/>
<br/>
You CAN selectively tune out the whining. You can also note to your <br/>
child that you are going to ignore until the complaining stops and <br/>
explain that you cannot change what cannot be changed (kids believe <br/>
moms are superhuman sometimes).<br/>
<br/>
I would also look into diet, general stresses, television <br/>
programming, sleep disturbances, and playtime situations to see if <br/>
there isn&#39;t an underlying stress that is causing your child to be <br/>
overly sensitive. This goes back to the part where mommies can change <br/>
some things. :)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  And remember that raising a child is like growing a <br/>
flower garden.  The more effort you put into it, the more beautiful <br/>
and wonderful it will be.<br/>
