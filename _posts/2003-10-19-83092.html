Maybe I&#39;m kidding myself, considering my reaction to this, but it&#39;s what I <br/>
like to believe.  I&#39;ll calm down in a bit, and I don&#39;t start stuff like this -- <br/>
you know?  It&#39;s just hard to stay cool and collected when I&#39;m attacked.<br/>

Ya know, I had to ponder long and hard before responding to this person... <br/>
The funny thing is his first e-mail asked if *everyone* in our group unschooled. <br/>
 I laughed and laughed then told him he only got that impression because I am <br/>
so vocal on the list, that in truth *I* am the minority in the group.  I did <br/>
ask his purpose in publishing the names and e-mail addresses of the people who <br/>
teach as he does (who wrote to him off-list).  <br/>
<br/>
But this tirade did force me to look at myself and MY attitudes toward others <br/>
in the group.  *I* certainly have not been supportive of those who dwell on <br/>
*breaking the will* of their children and forcing them to do their *school <br/>
work.*  I did feel smugly superior and it showed :&#39;(  I now know that I *teach <br/>
best what I need to learn most* (thank you Richard Bach) and have apologized to <br/>
the parents I feel I&#39;ve alienated by my lack of support.  Now when I hear &quot;I <br/>
can&#39;t unschool, his dad would take him from me&quot; I must have empathy, not <br/>
criticism ... tough leap to make, but I appreciate the opportunity to better myself <br/>
and better support our group.  (bite my tongue instead of clucking it!!)  So I <br/>
guess he stirred our sh!t because it needed to be stirred!  :)  <br/>
