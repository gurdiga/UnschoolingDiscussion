<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119251807">We live in Pittsburgh, PA (which may be more south/west than you are looking at - based on the other states in your list) .  The state laws are considered among the more restrictive.  But -- you don&#39;t have to register you child until she/he turns 8 -- which gets rid of some early performance pressure.   Each year you have to (I think) turn in objectives (which can be VERY general, i.e., continue to read books for pleasure, understand math in everyday life, etc.), in some places (though not in my school district) turn in a portfolio with examples of work, and have a certified teacher do the evaluation.  You choose the evaluator from any certified PA teacher and I&#39;m told that it is pretty easy to find a  unschooling/unschooling friendly evaluator.  I  know plenty of unschoolers in the city of Pittsburgh school district and they don&#39;t seem to be having any problems. Other school districts may vary. <br/>
<br/>
The city feeling in my experience is EXTREMELY laid back.  No one cars what you drive, so far as I can tell. Housing stock is reasonably cheap for a medium sized city.  I&#39;ve had friends find move-in condition 3-4 bedroom houses in reasonable neighborhoods in the 80&#39;s and I&#39;m told even in the 60&#39;s.  My own neighborhood just saw an incredible jump in prices, but that seems to have cooled down somewhat. <br/>
<br/>
What I really love about Pittsburgh is that as a legacy of the robber coal and steel barons (Carnegie, Frick, etc.) from the turn of the century -- it had a LOT of money put into arts/musuem/parks infrastructure, so for the size of the city, it really has better museums adn parks than it &quot;ought&quot; to have.  <br/>
<br/>
Other stuff: several universities and colleges, so good bookstores and used bookstores.  Lots of stuff to do with kids indoors and outdoors.  A reasonably active alternative parenting community.  A  terrific active, non-religious, largely-unschooling homeschooling group (and some other schoolier, christian ones). <br/>
<br/>
Not sure whether there is already one or more british grocery businesses -- but specialty shops like that seem to do well -- judging from the numbers of them around that stay in business. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway -- that&#39;s the long-winded answer.  I&#39;d be happy to answer any questions on or off-line if you have any. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094060713">Olga, for your third question, it would seem that you would have to <br/>
be near a large city to have a large enough foreign community to buy <br/>
your special made products unless you sold online or through mail <br/>
order.  Could mail order or online be an option?  That would expand <br/>
your options so much as to where you could live.<br/>
<br/>
I live in MA.  According to an article in USA Today, we topped the <br/>
list of states that discourage homeschooling but I have never had a <br/>
problem.  We just write a letter of intent at the beginning of the <br/>
year and a short progress report at the end of the year.  CT has no <br/>
regulations at all.  Maybe you could suscribe to the yahoo groups of <br/>
all the states you are interested in, go on no email, and just read <br/>
through a lot of their posts to see what issues people are <br/>
talking/complaining about.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget to figure in culture shock for your family.  Going from <br/>
a large city to the isolation of a gazillion acre farm (for example) <br/>
may be too much of a sudden change.  We just moved from a city to a <br/>
small town and my kids are having a tough time adjusting to the fact <br/>
that not everything is only a bus stop away from where they are at <br/>
every moment.  This town doesn&#39;t even have busses.  We did move close <br/>
to the center of town so they have stores nearby, just not the <br/>
variety they are used to.<br/>

Do you know anything about VA beach?  My dh was thinking about the <br/>
annapolis, MD area but we visited his brother there and I thought it <br/>
was similar to here and what you described.   I am pushing for more <br/>
north and somewhere where we can live a little away from the main <br/>
town where we would locate the bakery and find cheaper housing and <br/>
live in the country a bit.  We are looking for a place with a <br/>
mixture of tourism and a sort of hometown atmosphere.  Who knows, <br/>
maybe we are dreaming!<br/>

were unpleasant to me came from there.<br/>
Cheap housing is a problem anywhere 50 miles of DC which Anapolis is.<br/>

<br/>
Olga, <br/>
<br/>
We were born and raised in Connecticut and just recently moved from there. <br/>
Connecticut has no regulations as far as homeschooling / unschooling goes. Some <br/>
officials may tell you it is law to sign a NOI but it really is not required. <br/>
There is an attorney there that will stand up for your rights if there ends up <br/>
being a problem. Connecticut has a large homeschooling network that offers <br/>
wonderful support & various activities and play groups for children of all ages. <br/>
I don&#39;t know if you are familiar with Ned and Luz but they also live in <br/>
Connecticut and have a group called Unschoolers Unlimited which is a great group. <br/>
We lived down near the shore in Milford and then near the Mass. border in <br/>
Enfield, both were pretty good places. If you were to consider moving to <br/>
Connecticut, I would say NOT to move to Hartford although it probably would be a good <br/>
place for your business, Hartford is BUSY and if you are more for the quiet <br/>
neighborhood then Hartford would not be for you. I don&#39;t know if New Hampshire <br/>
would be a good place for your business, it would have to be in the very busy <br/>
areas like Manchester, Nashua, Portsmouth to name a few, not too quiet! The <br/>
quieter areas like where we live, business&#39;s come and go and tend not to do very <br/>
well mainly because everyone is driving to the busy towns for work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091398848">1&2: Maine seems to be great so far we have been here 6 years my husband was <br/>
born and raised in Maine. Our letter of intent is simple -One statement. Here <br/>
your friends are made by you not by your car or the size of your home and tend <br/>
to be less long lasting friends. Snow near the ME NH line is beautiful and <br/>
not overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
Prices differ depending on the town. Lebanon ME is very low and very country <br/>
but not much in the town. South Berwick is a perfect small town with country <br/>
but costly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. Portland, Lewiston, Auburn, Bangor and Augusta or Portsmouth NH would be a <br/>
good place for the business. There is also Manchester NH or Boston MA. Or for <br/>
seasonal business there is York, ME, Kittery, ME or Hampton NH but Hampton is <br/>
icky in the summer. Tends to be a trouble spot. York is also a VERY nice <br/>
place to live as is Kittery but higher. Dover NH seems to be adding some specialty <br/>
foods. They are a smaller city and a nice place to live. York, Kittery, Dover <br/>
are all about 45 minutes to Boston and 50 to Manchester as far as airports <br/>
with the exception of Pease which flies to FL that Is in Portsmouth/Newington NH <br/>
about 10 minutes from York, ME, Kittery, ME,Dover, NH and Hampton, NH.<br/>
Hope I made sense I jumped a bit.<br/>

<br/>
This is not exactly true.  Each town has it&#39;s own rules but they all must<br/>
stay withing the two court rulings.  The court rulings basically say we have<br/>
to write a letter of intent at the beginning of each year, and a periodical<br/>
method of evaluation that is mutually agreed upon.  We do not have to stay<br/>
up with what the schools teach or anything like that.  The confusion comes<br/>
because some towns have forms that ask for hours in each subject and also<br/>
ask for a face-to-face meeting.  Neither of those are required, though.  We<br/>
are working to educate each superintendent by giving them a booklet of<br/>
facts.  A group just formed in MA that is dealing specifically with this<br/>
issue.<br/>

You are too cute.  That is something I would do.  Actually, right <br/>
