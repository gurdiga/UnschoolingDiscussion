<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can you recommend some enticing math books for an adult dabbler?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YES.<br/>
Art books on perspective.<br/>
Music books on historical musical forms (if you can read music and <br/>
musicology; if not, never mind that one).<br/>
The history of games.  There are some BEAUTIFUL games books out there, with <br/>
how-to, and you can figure out why some games last for hundreds of years.<br/>
Books on chess or bridge or poker.<br/>
Architecture books.  <br/>
Books on historical architecture--Roman bridges, medieval castles, aquaducts <br/>
and water-movement for plumbing and irrigation.<br/>
How-to books on electricity or plumbing or house construction or making a <br/>
deck or putting in a brick patio.<br/>
Any/all of the videos (video first on these, if possible) and books called <br/>
Connections, Connections II or The Day the Universe Changed.<br/>
Mysteries--like Brother Cadfael or Sherlock Holmes or the Brit-horseracing <br/>
guy.<br/>
Trivia books like Guiness Book of World Records.<br/>
Geography books with maps and stats about population density, religion, <br/>
language (native and secondary languages charts are wonderful).<br/>
Alice in Wonderland and Through the Lookingglass<br/>
Books on landscaping or interior decoration or clothing design.<br/>
<br/>
I think that generally buying &quot;a math book&quot; only reinforces the idea that <br/>
math isn&#39;t a full infusion of the whole universe, but that it exists in <br/>
frightening math books.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, who does actually own at least a dozen particularly-math books, not <br/>
including all of Keith&#39;s math and programming stuff.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Speaking of frightening math stuff, my MIL who has her doctrate in Math <br/>
Education, subscribes to a Math Magazine!! LOL One day we were over there, <br/>
and Lelia  and I saw this magazine, and Lelia who just is not into math, was <br/>
horrified to see there was such a thing as a &quot;math magazine&quot;. It will be <br/>
interesting to see how she and FIL (who has doctrate in HIstroy Education and <br/>
40 plus years as teacher) react with Quinton being unschooled. Lelia is their <br/>
grandaughter by adoption and was already being unschooled when they met. . . <br/>
I am thinking Quinton will be a different story. FIL has offered several <br/>
times to &quot;teach&quot; Lelia history. Ah well, I&#39;m sure I will be asking for advice <br/>
from all of you then! :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ahhhhh.  I really like the idea of math made concrete and beautiful,<br/>
rather than abstract and ethereal.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen the &quot;perspective&quot; episode of Connections, and it was really<br/>
cool.  I should shake it loose from the library and watch it again.<br/>
(Perfect timing, as our Connections book has disappeared and we have not<br/>
been able to hunt it up!<br/>
