<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491631072">&lt;&lt;Is this considered unschooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Again, Dawn it would depend on who you asked.  Most people I think would<br/>
agree that as long as a child is truly free to engage or not engage in an<br/>
activity, then most likely unschooling is going on.  But at a point, and I<br/>
think it is different for everyone, you start to realize that kids don&#39;t<br/>
need the artificiality of workbooks, subjects, etc. to learn.<br/>
<br/>
In one of Holt&#39;s books, he talks about a child learning to swim.  Using that<br/>
scenario, consider my following descriptions.  One set of parents sign the<br/>
kid up for swimming lessons and force the child to attend (definitely not<br/>
unschooling).  One set of parents signs the kid up for lessons and when the<br/>
kid asks to stop going the parents have no problem (possibly unschooling).<br/>
One set of parents asks their kid if he is interested in taking swimming<br/>
lessons and kid says would like to try it.  After 2 lessons wants to stop<br/>
and parents agree (unschooling as is most often practiced).  One set of<br/>
parents plays in the water with their baby and continues on as child becomes<br/>
toddler and older.  At some point, the kid turns loose of parent to<br/>
s-t-r-e-t-c-h and reach wall, eventually paddling a couple of strokes,<br/>
eventually swimming (unschooling as described most often by Holt).<br/>
<br/>
At least that is how it plays in my head, your mileage may vary.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is a learning process for the parents too!  <br/>
<br/>
The swimming example hits home for me.<br/>
<br/>
Kid #1:  Lessons at the Y.  He had fun.  He may have actually learned <br/>
something.  But. . . <br/>
<br/>
I learned how to teach a little kid how to swim.<br/>
<br/>
Kid #2:  No lessons.  We played at the beach and at various pools and now she <br/>
swims beautifully -- if a little splashy.<br/>
<br/>
And I tell people this who ask me -- and they do -- Moms with their first <br/>
little one.  I didn&#39;t know how to teach or show or be comfortable or safe  -- <br/>
or whatever you want to call it -- a little kid to swim.  So the lessons at <br/>
first helped me too.<br/>
<br/>
Good example Julie!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236673258">**The Moore&#39;s &quot;forumla&quot;  is basically unschooling until the age of 12 or so<br/>
<br/>
and then a move toward academics for high school.  Most children will do<br/>
<br/>
this on their own. It&#39;s sort of a natural progression, since those 12 year<br/>
<br/>
olds really do want to join the adults in making a living and being<br/>
<br/>
independent.  The Moore&#39;s just move into *bookwork* mode, but acknowledge<br/>
<br/>
that not every child will want or need the same thing. A hands on learner<br/>
<br/>
will stil lbe a hands on learner, so things should be geared to the child.<br/>
<br/>
If you can read between the language used, you&#39;ll find that it&#39;s not a lack<br/>
<br/>
of trust in the children, but rather an expectation that *education* means<br/>
<br/>
standard school fare for the Moore&#39;s.**<br/>
<br/>
I remember the &quot;formula&quot; as no formal academics until age 8 or 9, and an <br/>
equal balance of academics, manual work, and service after that age. It <br/>
shares with unschooling a conviction that children want to be and should be a <br/>
part of the adult world, not segregated from it, but assumes more adult <br/>
control of the process. (I&#39;m very fond of a lot of the Moore&#39;s writings.)<br/>
