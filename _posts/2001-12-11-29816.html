<div id="ygrps-yiv-838560539">Hi Karen - since you mentioned that you&#39;re a vet, I&#39;d like to ask you a question if I may.<br/>
<br/>
What is your opinion about heartworm preventative medication? The kind you take monthly.<br/>
We live in Phoenix, AZ. It is relatively dry and we don&#39;t get many mosquitos.<br/>
Our vet is recommending the heartworm meds, though, because of a recent rise in heartworm reported locally.<br/>
We are considering it, but are wondering if it is really necessary.<br/>
If you think it is, what is the best brand, in your opinion?<br/>
We have a dog with fairly short hair (a vizsla).<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-7836125">Since you&#39;re a vet, I have a rabies vaccine question if you don&#39;t <br/>
mind!  I was doing research on vaccines for my kids and came across a <br/>
rabies vaccine that had listed as an ingredient something that <br/>
suggested it might have been cultured on aborted babies.  As a <br/>
strongly pro-life family (we dont&#39; give mmr or varivax vacc. for that <br/>
reason), I want to look into this for the next time we have a pet who <br/>
needs a rabies vaccine!  Do you know if this is true, or is it only <br/>
true in rabies vaccines from certain manufacturers?  Also, can you <br/>
take a religious or ethical exemption to a vaccine in the same way you <br/>
can for children?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072710721">What was it Chandler said once on Friends? &quot;Can open, worms all over <br/>
the place!&quot; Oh, well, since &quot;retirement&quot; I sometimes miss practice. <br/>
Sort of. A little.<br/>
<br/>
I live in TX, so heartworm preventative is a must. If your vet thinks <br/>
the rate has risen there, then you should probably weigh whether to <br/>
put your dog on meds based on probability or cost ($25/mo vs. $600 to <br/>
treat, with a 10% possibility of contracting the disease, eg). If you <br/>
can afford it, by all means, put him on it. The treatment is hard on <br/>
them. Heartgard is my recommendation and it&#39;s very safe and very <br/>
effective unless you have a collie, in which case talk to your vet. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827102209">Just a clarification: while it is an arsenical compound (I&#39;m talking <br/>
about Immiticide now, not the older Caparsolate, which should never <br/>
be used), and could be called a &quot;poison&quot; in that it kills worms, the <br/>
regimen is two injections, 24 hours apart, deep into the muscles of <br/>
the lumbar back. Not an epidural; done correctly and with pain meds, <br/>
apparently like a bad backache. Occasionally a vet will recommend one <br/>
injection, then return in one month for two more if the case is <br/>
serious enough. It&#39;s still a horrible treatment and one you&#39;ll want <br/>
to avoid, but it&#39;s SO much better than the old treatment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611827567">Yep, it&#39;s expensive, which is why it&#39;s not done much, since you would <br/>
then have to return for vaccines if the titers were too low. (rhymes <br/>
with biter). And yes, lots of vets &quot;rely&quot; on the yearly vaccines to <br/>
get pets in for the yearly exam. We&#39;ve been trained like that, but <br/>
it&#39;s changing, and if you all would promise to bring in your pets <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547693152">I have never heard of an ingredient like that (what was it? Placenta? <br/>
And if so, are you sure of the source?) in animal rabies vaccine. <br/>
Manufacturers try to culture on the same species it&#39;ll be used in, <br/>
but that&#39;s not always practical, hence duck embryo vaccines, etc, in <br/>
the past. Human medicine has turned to human recombinant DNA for <br/>
insulin, for example, but I&#39;m not sure of the source. I&#39;ll see if I <br/>
can research it. And no, there&#39;s no ethical exemption, only medical. <br/>
If I have a dog who&#39;s had a life-threatening reaction to rabies <br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a vet, so I&#39;m sticking my nose in here! What vaccines you get <br/>
&gt; for your<br/>
&gt; &gt; pets should depend on the environment they&#39;re in. An indoor cat <br/>
may <br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; &gt; need rabies (state law). An outdoor one may need to be evaluated <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; risk<br/>
&gt; &gt; from upper respiratory and leukemia viruses. When I practiced in <br/>
an <br/>
&gt; upper<br/>
&gt; &gt; middle class town with well-cared-for dogs, I honestly thought <br/>
parvo <br/>
&gt; was on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the downswing. I changed to a large metropolitan practice, and I <br/>
saw <br/>
&gt; 1-4<br/>
&gt; &gt; parvo cases a day in the summer. Distemper too, and I thought it <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; almost<br/>
&gt; &gt; gone.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If I were to get another animal, I&#39;d vaccinate routinely for the <br/>
&gt; first year<br/>
&gt; &gt; and every three years after that, depending on where I was. Or <br/>
I&#39;d <br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; blood titers checked; that&#39;s what I do for my own rabies immunity!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-619507449">Without getting out on the web right now, I&#39;d say it&#39;s true in most <br/>
states, if not all. Ask a vet in your state. Some are three year, <br/>
some are one year if the rabies problem is a large one. It is here; I <br/>
get a weekly email from the state govt of positive rabies cases and <br/>
it&#39;s rarely less than 5 a week. Most of those are wild animals, so if <br/>
you have indoor cats, the chance of them contracting it is remote if <br/>
they NEVER go outside. However, if they bite someone while <br/>
unvaccinated, the victim has the right to demand they be tested <br/>
immediately instead of undergoing quarantine, as a vaccinated animal <br/>
would. It&#39;s not a law, but they can, and I have had the unfortunate <br/>
experience of having to put down perfectly nice but unvaccinated <br/>
animals before to test for rabies (it&#39;s not a survivable test). <br/>

  What was it Chandler said once on Friends? &quot;Can open, worms all over <br/>
  the place!&quot; Oh, well, since &quot;retirement&quot; I sometimes miss practice. <br/>
  Sort of. A little.<br/>
<br/>
  I live in TX, so heartworm preventative is a must. If your vet thinks <br/>
  the rate has risen there, then you should probably weigh whether to <br/>
  put your dog on meds based on probability or cost ($25/mo vs. $600 to <br/>
  treat, with a 10% possibility of contracting the disease, eg). If you <br/>
  can afford it, by all means, put him on it. The treatment is hard on <br/>
  them. Heartgard is my recommendation and it&#39;s very safe and very <br/>
  effective unless you have a collie, in which case talk to your vet. <br/>

&gt; Manufacturers try to culture on the same species it&#39;ll be used in, <br/>
&gt; but that&#39;s not always practical, hence duck embryo vaccines, etc, in <br/>
&gt; the past. Human medicine has turned to human recombinant DNA for <br/>
&gt; insulin, for example, but I&#39;m not sure of the source. I&#39;ll see if I <br/>
&gt; can research it. And no, there&#39;s no ethical exemption, only medical. <br/>
&gt; If I have a dog who&#39;s had a life-threatening reaction to rabies <br/>
&gt; vaccine, I can write a medical exemption. Rare, though.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Since you&#39;re a vet, I have a rabies vaccine question if you don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; mind!  I was doing research on vaccines for my kids and came <br/>
across <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; rabies vaccine that had listed as an ingredient something that <br/>
&gt; &gt; suggested it might have been cultured on aborted babies.  As a <br/>
&gt; &gt; strongly pro-life family (we dont&#39; give mmr or varivax vacc. for <br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; reason), I want to look into this for the next time we have a pet <br/>
&gt; who <br/>
&gt; &gt; needs a rabies vaccine!  Do you know if this is true, or is it <br/>
only <br/>
&gt; &gt; true in rabies vaccines from certain manufacturers?  Also, can you <br/>
&gt; &gt; take a religious or ethical exemption to a vaccine in the same way <br/>
&gt; you <br/>
&gt; &gt; can for children?  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m a vet, so I&#39;m sticking my nose in here! What vaccines you <br/>
get <br/>
&gt; &gt; for your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pets should depend on the environment they&#39;re in. An indoor cat <br/>
&gt; may <br/>
&gt; &gt; only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; need rabies (state law). An outdoor one may need to be evaluated <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; risk<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from upper respiratory and leukemia viruses. When I practiced in <br/>
&gt; an <br/>
&gt; &gt; upper<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; middle class town with well-cared-for dogs, I honestly thought <br/>
&gt; parvo <br/>
&gt; &gt; was on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the downswing. I changed to a large metropolitan practice, and I <br/>
&gt; saw <br/>
&gt; &gt; 1-4<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; parvo cases a day in the summer. Distemper too, and I thought it <br/>
&gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt; almost<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; gone.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If I were to get another animal, I&#39;d vaccinate routinely for the <br/>
&gt; &gt; first year<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and every three years after that, depending on where I was. Or <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d <br/>
&gt; &gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; blood titers checked; that&#39;s what I do for my own rabies <br/>
immunity!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692299422">The active ingredient in Heartgard, ivermectin, in large doses, can be fatal<br/>
for collies. The dose in Heartgard is labeled safe for collies, but they are<br/>
much more sensitive and some vets still recommend using a different brand of<br/>
preventative (Interceptor or Revolution, for example.) Shelties, border<br/>
collies, etc, are not as susceptible, but I&#39;ve had clients that didn&#39;t even<br/>
want to take that chance. I&#39;ve seen two fatalities, both from accidental<br/>
overdose in collies (the Lassie type).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Heartgard is my recommendation and it&#39;s very safe and very<br/>
&gt;effective unless you have a collie, in which case talk to your vet.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just curious, since we don&#39;t seem to have heartworm here, but why not<br/>
collies?  Mine is a border collie cross.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491582153">Thank YOU!!  I was starting to feel bad for starting the dog thread <br/>
by asking about mine.<br/>
<br/>
We go to the vet today.  Gotta get rid of these fleas!  Tried a flea <br/>
bath, tried the natural stuff that works on the cats (and keeps lice <br/>
off people too) - nothing works.  I think he just had so many that we <br/>
are going to need to go the vet route for them.  I&#39;m still checking <br/>
into low cost neuter programs but I may just cave and pay for him.  <br/>
(He was taking liberties with a stuffed bear last night.)<br/>
<br/>
Oddly, training the dog is a lot like raising Wyndham in some ways.  <br/>
I think that&#39;s why I can deal with this nearly out of control dog <br/>
better than anyone in the family.  I&#39;m just more used to it because I <br/>
dealt with the same impulsive traits in Wyndham!  (No, I don&#39;t treat <br/>
my son like the dog or compare him to the dog - I just see that they <br/>
share a few charateristics.)<br/>
