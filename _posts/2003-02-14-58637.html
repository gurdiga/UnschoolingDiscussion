&gt; supply.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a great analogy, because my daughters do use their unlimited access<br/>
to tv the same way they use their unlimited access to chocolate, potato<br/>
chips, ice cream, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have limits on food and keep all sorts of &quot;junk&quot; normally on hand<br/>
right alongside &quot;the good stuff&quot;, and my girls eat what they want --<br/>
sometimes this is what others would consider junk, sometimes it&#39;s not. My<br/>
youngest can be relied upon to ask for a bagel or toast for breakfast, every<br/>
morning, though she knows she could have ice cream if she wanted it. My<br/>
oldest is more likely to remind me that we&#39;re out of lettuce for her salads<br/>
than that we are out of chips.<br/>
<br/>
This is not to say they don&#39;t eat &quot;junk&quot; food -- they do. So do I. But we<br/>
all also choose &quot;good&quot; foods right along with them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Isn&#39;t it our responsibility to offer a healthy assortment of food<br/>
&gt; from which to choose, including some not-so-healthy treats, to enjoy on<br/>
&gt; occasion, and in the same way, isn&#39;t it our responsibility to provide a<br/>
&gt; healthy assortment of entertainment options.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Except for the &quot;on occasion&quot; part, I&#39;m right with you. Do you imagine that<br/>
those of us who don&#39;t limit television have children with no other interests<br/>
BUT that television? Or that we don&#39;t see to it that they have a variety of<br/>
things that we believe might interest them, ready if they want them?<br/>
<br/>
My daughters are outside right now pretending to be babies (a friend just<br/>
had one). They are in the fresh air, running around and making a good deal<br/>
of noise, playing happily. They have not been told to do so, and if they<br/>
were instead playing video games or watching tv, I wouldn&#39;t care a jot. Thus<br/>
lives freedom.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I realize this is hard to do<br/>
&gt; in the case of television, unless you plain just don&#39;t own one, but with<br/>
&gt; games and cd-roms, we do have more ability to offer a nice array of<br/>
&gt; options, in a limited supply, so that outdoor play and face-to-face social<br/>
&gt; interaction (more organic human activities), are the more available option,<br/>
&gt; and I would strongly argue, the healthier option.  I do believe there is<br/>
&gt; much value in the electronic world, and pleasure in the enjoyment of<br/>
&gt; delicious treats, but is there a way to offer these, without the attractive<br/>
&gt; packaging and addictive quality that they offer to both adults and<br/>
&gt; children, the quality that marketers work hard to improve in order to<br/>
&gt; persuade us to buy more!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s the problem, of course: video games are fun, and television is<br/>
entertaining. I know this is not universal to everyone here (or anywhere)<br/>
but it is a fact that a great many people, big and small, find this a<br/>
self-evident truth. If these things were not fun and entertaining, who would<br/>
bother to fool with them? Attractive packaging may get you to buy, but not<br/>
to play or watch if there are other better things on offer.<br/>
<br/>
If you find outdoor play and face-to-face social interaction healthier<br/>
options, you should by all means choose them. When you start choosing them<br/>
FOR other people though, even when those other people are short and under<br/>
your jurisdiction, you rob them of their free choices, as well as the<br/>
opportunity to learn to make good ones.<br/>
