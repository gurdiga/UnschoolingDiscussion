<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151273643">Christianity is<br/>
a belief not a religion &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Since when? It is both. For some of us, believing in the message that <br/>
Christ brought is enough to claim the term &quot;Christian&quot;...but when <br/>
those beliefs are in direct opposition to the majority of Christian <br/>
churches/religions, you&#39;ve got to then wonder if we&#39;re really <br/>
Christian&#39;s at all? <br/>
Maybe we&#39;re followers of Christ. Christianity is indeed a religion, a <br/>
religion with powerful people trying to control the people we put <br/>
into government, how the homeschool laws are written and so on.<br/>
It is a belief for myself also, but that does not negate the <br/>
existance of a religion with some very powerful and negative messages.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051606555">Christianity comes from Christ, religion is man made. <br/>
There is no mention in the bible of Catholics,<br/>
Protestants, Lutherans, Baptists, Methodists, these<br/>
were all created by man.<br/>
