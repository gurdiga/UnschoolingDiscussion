&lt;&lt; Anyway, has anyone tried reading Tolkein out loud?  Does it flow well <br/>
enoughto do it that way?  Is it particularly difficult?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s beautiful aloud.  My sister and brother-in-law, when they were first <br/>
together in the 1970&#39;s, were living in a one room wood-heated building, and <br/>
every night they read to each other from Lord of the Rings.  I went over <br/>
there extra times during that time, and would take a turn reading.  Those not <br/>
reading would cook, fold clothes, tend the fire, whatever they could do <br/>
quietly, and then readers would switch off.  It was a really great experience <br/>
(even though I was just a visitor).<br/>
<br/>
I calligraphed Bilbo&#39;s Bath Song for them then and it&#39;s framed and in one of <br/>
the bathrooms in the big stone house they&#39;re building.<br/>
<br/>
Whether kids would appreciate it, I can&#39;t say.  We had all read the books <br/>
before, so this was for review and for the joy of the experience.  For them <br/>
it was bonding.  A trip to another world together (even though sometimes I <br/>
showed up like Samwise to tag along a ways).<br/>
