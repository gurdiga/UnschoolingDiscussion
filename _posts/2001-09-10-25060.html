<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811900806">(hiding my face and kind of mumbling) I love the Teletubbies and I think they <br/>
are one of the least sexist kid&#39;s shows made. I really think that any show <br/>
with two female characters, one person of color and one, supposedly, gay <br/>
character is worthy of my affection...where else are you going to see that? <br/>
My dd no longer watches them but dh and I still hum the songs. Maybe it is <br/>
mind control, but what sweet control it is. Ok the windmills and stuff are <br/>
pretty creepy and a show made for babies is a bit twisted, but gotta love <br/>
their house, and the bunnies, and the flowers...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-769344676">It makes me crazy (o.k., so crazier &lt;g&gt;) to see folks plop a baby in front<br/>
of tv and the walk off and leave them.  I had a woman call that wanted help<br/>
doing bonsai with some young plants she had.  We were sitting in the kitchen<br/>
for at least two hours and the whole time the television was on in the other<br/>
room.  I figured she had kids at home but it was sooooo silent that after<br/>
awhile I thought she had simply left it on.<br/>
<br/>
We got all the roots and wiring done and the plants all in their new little<br/>
pots and I said that she should think about getting living moss to add to<br/>
her pots.  I gave her a list of some nurseries that would sell the moss to<br/>
her by the chunk.  She jumped up and said she would run right down and get<br/>
some and said, &quot;Hold on while I get [baby&#39;s name] and I&#39;ll walk out to the<br/>
barn (where you had to park your car) with you.&quot;  She ran in the room with<br/>
the television and came back out with a baby already in a car seat.  I guess<br/>
I had a questioning look on my face because she said, &quot;Oh, when I&#39;m busy I<br/>
park her in front of the tv.&quot;  Poor baby had a glazed look on her face.<br/>

From what I have read Poe and La La are more or less white girls, Dipsy more <br/>
or less boy POC, and Tinky Winky more or less white boy who certain people <br/>
feel is too comfortable with his bag. I remember reading this in the paper <br/>
when Teletubbies first came out. That is how the show was supposed to be set <br/>
up. Back then I raged against them. My child would NEVER watch the Tubbies. I <br/>
had been a mom long enough by then to have known I should have never said <br/>
never, but hey, my words taste pretty good. By the way the Tubs came to us at <br/>
a time when Syd (now 4) was getting up at 4:00 am, taking one 1 hour nap late <br/>
in the day, staying up till 10:00 pm and I recieved a diagnoses of MS....I <br/>
needed that Tubs to save my sanity, literally. No she didn&#39;t watch them <br/>
unattended for hours, but did sit in front of them quietly for an hour while <br/>
I sat comatose on the couch.<br/>
And yes, I realize that I have been too busy to post on the weighty topics <br/>
but when Teletubbies comes up I am all over it, wonder what that says? : )<br/>

(my word, not his) if he thought any self-respecting gay man would not have<br/>

better job, too.<br/>

and we watch it with him as we tend to watch most things as a family or at <br/>
least one of us parents is in there with them. There is one video with a <br/>
parade of animals that Quinton just LOVES and he gets up and screams and <br/>
says. . . &quot;rade, rade, rade!!!&quot; It&#39;s kind of like the Ark. . .two by two, but <br/>
not really cause there is no Ark. Anyway, another teletubbie family here.<br/>
