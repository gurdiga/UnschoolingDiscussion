<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150892717">JUmping in-My girls age 13 have been wondering about the Japanese <br/>
game &quot;Go&quot;.  (sp?)<br/>
The are 13 -into all things Japanese<br/>
WE are in BC Canada-would need to use Mail order.<br/>
Any ideas of what you think of the game ? -places to order in Canada?<br/>
<br/>
They have signed up for an evening course in Japanese language and <br/>
culture at the College of the Rockies here-Starts in January<br/>
They are sure hoping it happens ( very small town so often classes dont <br/>
get  the numbers needed.<br/>
 The college had no problem in letting the girls sign up for it- they <br/>
went to an open house for fall/winter classes and met the instructer <br/>
etc.<br/>
They occasionally try out language tapes they order through the Library.<br/>
They are also interested in the Rosetta Stone course.<br/>
Anyone  had kids use this? What did they think of it?<br/>
<br/>
By the way <br/>
-they developed these interests through Manga-Anime-many of the videos-<br/>
Starting with &quot;My Neighbour Totoro&quot; on through &quot;Spirited Away&quot;  etc etc <br/>
(saw them rewatching it again on my way to bed last night)<br/>
They developed their reading  ablity through using the computer-playing <br/>
comp games-they own about all of the Harvest Moon games for PS , Ds,Wii<br/>
watching some manga on You Tube in Japanese when they cant find the <br/>
English<br/>
I sure get a kick out of watching them go...Who knew???<br/>
They spend hours every day writing stories plots-Harvest Moon  <br/>
walkthroughs <br/>
They decided they might sign up for the Spanish course if the Japanese <br/>
one doesnt happen.<br/>
And these are my little ones that almost wouldnt leave the house last <br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping someone might be familiar with the game etc<br/>
And thanks a million if you have the time to reply<br/>
Regards<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718885934">Go is fun!  One of my favorite things about it is that it is easy to<br/>
handicap games and you can play a game that is enjoyable for both<br/>
people even if you have very different skill levels.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing they are interested because of Hikaru no Go, right?  I<br/>
loved reading (and watching) it.  That was what sparked an interest in<br/>
Go for both my youngest brother and myslef.  I haven&#39;t played very<br/>
much but I downloaded a program so that I could play on the computer.<br/>
The AI was pretty good - good enough to be a nice challenge for a<br/>
beginner, at any rate. This one:<br/>

<br/>
As for Go boards,  my brother got really into it and ordered a<br/>
beautiful Go table (the thick ones with legs) and stones from Japan.<br/>
It is beautiful and very nice to play on. That table was rather<br/>
expensive, but the board he had before that was also very nice and<br/>
easy to buy.  I have a Go board that I bought a long time ago and it<br/>
is rather small and not that great to play with.  I think it is 12<br/>
inches and a lot of Go boards that I saw when I searched online are<br/>
that size.  Too small.  The board feels very cramped and the stones<br/>
are so small that you can&#39;t hold them the right way when you play (if<br/>
your daughters have seen Hikaru no Go, they will know what I mean).<br/>
This board is probably big enough to be nice to play on:<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t own that board, but I have purchased things from that store<br/>
before and I have been happy with the store as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
I hope your daughters have fun - it is a neat game!<br/>
