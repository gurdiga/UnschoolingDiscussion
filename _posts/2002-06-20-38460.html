Background<br/>
<br/>
Evaporative cooling is one of the most ancient and one of the most <br/>
energy-efficient methods of cooling a home. It long has been regarded as <br/>
environmentally &quot;safe,&quot; since the process typically uses no ozone-depleting <br/>
chemicals, and demands one-fourth as much energy as refrigeration during the <br/>
peak cooling months of the year. In dry climates, evaporative cooling, even <br/>
the relatively inefficient &quot;swamp box&quot; household cooler, can be used to <br/>
inexpensively cool large homes.<br/>
<br/>
Direct evaporative cooling adds moisture to the air. In wet climates, or <br/>
during the late summer rainy season in the desert, this results in <br/>
uncomfortable and, for many individuals, unacceptable indoor humidity. In <br/>
Phoenix, those who have the option to choose between evaporative cooling and <br/>
refrigeration usually switch systems during July and do not go back to <br/>
evaporative cooling until mid-September. Indirect evaporative cooling, <br/>
without added humidity, is less effective, costs more, and if not used <br/>
properly, can cause damage to refrigeration systems.<br/>
<br/>
The most common form of residential evaporative cooling uses a vertical pad <br/>
of cellulose fiber, a system for delivering water to the top of the pad, and <br/>
a fan to draw air through the porous pad as the water runs down the medium <br/>
and is absorbed. As dry air moves over the wet pad, water evaporates, and the <br/>
air gives up its heat. The air moving from the wet pad into the home is <br/>
cooler than the outdoor air. Where water is high in mineral content, a <br/>
bleed-off system often is used on the water circulation system, constantly <br/>
dumping part of the water and allowing the refill valve to replace it with <br/>
fresh water. This decreases the mineral build-up on the pads and on the <br/>
inside of the cooler, but at a 25 to 50 percent increase in water use.<br/>
<br/>
The drop in temperature depends on how much water the air can absorb (a <br/>
function of the relative humidity), how evenly the pad media is wetted, and <br/>
how long the air is exposed to the pad (a factor of turbulence, wetness, and <br/>
speed of air movement), the evaporability of the water (both temperature and <br/>
hardness of the water affect this), and the ability of the building to &quot;vent&quot; <br/>
warmer exhaust air back to the atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
There is general agreement, even among domestic manufacturers, that U.S.-made <br/>
evaporative coolers are not as energy- or water-efficient as they could be. <br/>
These products are targeted heavily to middle-, lower-middle-, and low-income <br/>
households, and appear to be designed against a one- to two-year capital <br/>
payback, rather than optimum operational efficiency. Operating savings in <br/>
both water and energy, as well as in maintenance costs, often fall victim to <br/>
production of price-competitive units.<br/>
<br/>
Inefficiencies in less expensive units include: under-powered, inexpensive <br/>
aluminum-wound fan motors rather than more energy-efficient, larger <br/>
copper-wound motors; recirculating pumps that run faster and hotter than <br/>
necessary to compensate for a lack of volume capacity; fans that run up to 20 <br/>
percent over design capacity to move larger volumes of air at increased <br/>
velocity to make up in wind movement what is lost in evaporative efficiency. <br/>
<br/>
Slower movement of air through a thicker pad medium, adequately wetted by a <br/>
properly sized pump, all contained within a high-reflectivity cabinet, and <br/>
with all components operating at voltages higher than the usual household <br/>
current, would result in energy and water savings as well as a longer-lived <br/>
cooler and a more cost-effective long-term investment.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-531447698">We have a swamp/evaporative cooler.<br/>
We turn it on somewhere around mid-April when the temps start getting warm.<br/>
Then we switch to A/C usually around July when the monsoon season starts and<br/>
the dewpoint goes up.<br/>
The advantage over using a swamp cooler vs. A/C for cooling is cost.<br/>
It&#39;s much less expensive to run a cooler, and the only working parts<br/>
involved are a fan and a pump.<br/>
When the dewpoint goes above 55 degrees, that&#39;s when the cooler is no longer<br/>
effective, and it&#39;s just blowing hot, moist air in the house.<br/>
Right now in Phoenix, it&#39;s still dry and yesterdays dewpoint was 14 degrees!<br/>
Our cooler is still working great and even though it&#39;s been around 110+<br/>
degrees lately, it&#39;s still fairly comfortable in the house even in the heat<br/>
of the day.<br/>
I&#39;m so glad we have the option of using a cooler.<br/>
Many of the newer houses these days (especially those red-tiled roof houses)<br/>
are strictly A/C.<br/>
Some people view having and using a cooler as something the &quot;lower class&quot; of<br/>
people use because even if poor people here don&#39;t have an A/C unit,<br/>
practically EVERYBODY has a cooler to use, even if they live in a shack.<br/>
I don&#39;t care, though, I love our cooler and use it proudly!<br/>
