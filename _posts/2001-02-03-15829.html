I&#39;m checking into the &quot;materials&quot; donation question now.  The e-mail<br/>
from Gujarat was sent throughout India as well as to me, so I think they<br/>
<br/>
were hoping to get materials locally.<br/>
<br/>
--<br/>
<br/>
Now checked.  Nope. Don&#39;t send material stuff.  Doctors without Borders<br/>
is putting together medical kits in Belgium.  World Health Organization<br/>
says not to send clothes, blankets, or blood donations -- all of which<br/>
are easier (and cheaper) to get and transport locally.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard back from my friends in Gujarat.  They now have 3 teams<br/>
with four doctors and a community activist in each.  NONE of the<br/>
international aid has reached the rural areas where they are, and they<br/>
don&#39;t expect it will (they expect the big relief organizations will<br/>
concentrate in Bhuj and Ahmedabad and then go home).  Biggest problem in<br/>
the rural areas is clean drinking water -- we are getting some aid from<br/>
the American Friends Service Committee for portable water purification<br/>
equipment.<br/>
<br/>
For those who wish, tax deductible donations should be made out to the<br/>
Gandhian Foundation, and sent to me --<br/>

We will consolidate the funds, and get them through to Gujarat daily.<br/>

Thanks.<br/>
