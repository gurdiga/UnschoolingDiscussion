<div id="ygrps-yiv-867494036">Someone was asking about dealing with relatives who interfere or disapprove of unschooling...there was a thread awhile back because my mother was asking that my daughter Sarah, age 7, NOT email her as Sarah prefers but hand write her a letter. Sarah did agree to it, but there was a big go around between my mother and I over it and unschooling. <br/>
 <br/>
I just thought I&#39;d post that it&#39;s been some two months now I think...maybe just six weeks...and my mother has STILL not written Sarah back. <br/>
 <br/>
Sarah did send a handwritten letter to Paul&#39;s mother, who has written her back. She&#39;s still emailing, but thankfully hasn&#39;t brought up the fact that my mother hasn&#39;t written. <br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a slight possibility it didn&#39;t arrive.  I&#39;ve had three mail failures <br/>
in the past year, after a life time of maybe that many altogether.   <br/>
Coincidence, maybe.   Holly  never got her birthday card with $12 check for her 12th <br/>
birthday.   The grandparents say it was sent.  I said we&#39;ll wait a while and see <br/>
if it shows.  It never has.  I don&#39;t want to send them the bill for $12 worth <br/>
of expected birthday money. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
