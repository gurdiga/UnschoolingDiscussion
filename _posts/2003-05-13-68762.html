Sounds healing!!<br/>
<br/>
I know some people recommend selling that stuff, but I wouldn&#39;t sell (or <br/>
give!) someone my kid&#39;s spot in a school I really thought was harmful.  So <br/>
why give them a school-at-home seat that used to have my kid&#39;s name on it?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thrown books away that I could have sold to a used bookstore because I <br/>
thought they had bad advice that would do more harm than good.<br/>
