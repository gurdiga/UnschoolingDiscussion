<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277168649">Hi Annette,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just finished reading the responses to the &#39;sassy&#39; e-mail you sent <br/>
before and I feel very lucky to digest such a wide variety of responses and <br/>
information.  This forum is such a wonderful thing.  I can only imagine how <br/>
hard it was for my mom, and others, who had problems come up and didn&#39;t have <br/>
such a resourse.  And, even with the resourses, it still isn&#39;t an easy <br/>
thing,,,(and ,,,hey, who said it would be?!!)<br/>
I have a 9 yr old daughter who is extemely strong willed and bright (aren&#39;t <br/>
they all, really!), who has been a source of great frustration, and my <br/>
greatest teacher.  I have handled her sassyness/rudeness in different ways at <br/>
different times, and it seems to me now that it has had to do more with where <br/>
I am at the moment, than with her outbursts.<br/>
  When I am out of sorts, frustrated, or in stressful times I tend to do the <br/>
&quot;ok, that&#39;s it, i&#39;m sorry, but you can&#39;t talk to me like that&quot; and there are <br/>
consequenses, etc.  <br/>
When I am balanced, and my needs are being met, it seems I have much more <br/>
patience and I am willing to ask her questions &quot;is there something that is <br/>
bothering you&quot;, &quot;is there something that you need that you aren&#39;t feeling <br/>
like you&#39;re getting right now&quot;, &quot;what is this really about&quot;.  Sometimes I can <br/>
see she is just tired, or overwhelmed, but there are times when I have asked <br/>
a question like this and the answer is nothing that I could have ever <br/>
expected and it led to a great conversation, and a greater awareness of where <br/>
she is and who she is.  <br/>
If I am really honest with myself, I think there are times (I am a single <br/>
mom) where I know I don&#39;t have the inward resourses to really be able to <br/>
handle the answer to a question like &#39;what do you really need right <br/>
now&#39;,,,,,where the answer would be, &#39;i just need your undivided attention <br/>
with no interruptions&#39;, when I, myself feel empty and overwhelmed.  <br/>
I know I am a &#39;good mom&#39;, we all are, we&#39;re all doing the best we can.  And <br/>
yet, there is always room for improvement, but I know the answer is not to <br/>
beat myself up because I didn&#39;t do it right or perfectly, because there is no <br/>
such thing.  I keep finding the better I am to myself, the kinder I am to <br/>
myself, the kinder I am to my daughter.  The more I listen to, and respect <br/>
myself, the more I listen to , and respect my daughter.  And, since in the <br/>
past, I have had an issue with perfectionism, I keep hearing something: <br/>
&#39;Growth is not an event, it&#39;s a process&#39;.  It&#39;s not some place to get to, <br/>
it&#39;s an ever winding, ever discovering vehicle.  The &#39;answers&#39; will come only <br/>
to facilitate new questions.  It&#39;s all been a wonderful ride and just keeps <br/>
getting better :-)  I feel honored to have the opportunity to be at home with <br/>
my daughter, no matter what challenges have come up.  I know this is not the <br/>
&#39;norm&#39;, in societal terms, and I relish the opportunity to live our lives <br/>
together in this way.  <br/>
I don&#39;t usually write on here and just want to thank everyone for their <br/>
input, it&#39;s been very helpful and insightful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Jennifer</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-940260650">Hi Annette. My husband and I went to a parenting seminar once that <br/>
reccommended a similar method as Eirauls 3 strikes, but it was a bit more <br/>
formal. It really does work wonders. I&#39;ll see if I can explain it.<br/>
<br/>
First you make House Rules. No More than four-I think the ones I used were <br/>
No physical Violence, No Rudeness, Do your chores, and Do Homework (we were <br/>
still in school then)<br/>
<br/>
The second thing you do is rank privledges-5 things that your kids <br/>
like-maybe T.V., Nintendo, playing outside, whatever. You rank them so the <br/>
one they love the most is the last on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Then you make your X chart. Everytime one of the house rules is violated, <br/>
the offender gets an X. The first two X&#39;s are freebies, the third one, they <br/>
lose the first privledge. Another X, they lose the next privledge. At the <br/>
seminar they said that for young kids like yours they only lose the <br/>
privledge for the day, but older kids-like mine-they lose it for the rest of <br/>
the week.<br/>
<br/>
This was perfect here. It was all there in black and white, the rules as <br/>
well as the price for breaking them. There was no whining about it, or <br/>
begging me, or saying that I wasn&#39;t being fair, because it was the same for <br/>
all of them. And it was very good for me, because I do tend to let them off <br/>
the hook for alot of things. Once the kids realize that you are serious and <br/>
that you will not give in, they shape up amazingly quickly. After the first <br/>
week, I don&#39;t think anyone ever got as high as 5 X&#39;s. The only thing that <br/>
really matters is that you make all the things work for you-if you can&#39;t <br/>
stick to it, don&#39;t do it. I think that those idle threats are the <br/>
worst-saying &quot;Stop or you won&#39;t go to the birthday party&quot; when you know darn <br/>
well that you are going to go no matter what. Those are the things that make <br/>
your kids not pay attention to what you say-they aren&#39;t stupid, they know <br/>
they can get away with ignoring you. So, if you can&#39;t live with saying No <br/>
Playing Outside, then don&#39;t make that one of the things they lose.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps-good luck-and know that you are not alone, we all go through <br/>
this sort of thing at one time or another.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there is a great deal of wisdom in this little bit!  I know it was an <br/>
issue for me.  Learning to set limits/consequences that I could live with AND <br/>
meant something to the boys made all the difference in the world.<br/>
<br/>
I like the formality of your chart.  I can see where that would work very <br/>
well for many families.  It would give me grief.  Limiting myself to <br/>
enforcing 4 rules would leave me feeling like I had to overlook too much.  <br/>
Notice I said FEEL like I had to overlook things...I&#39;m pretty sure it is <br/>
really more a matter of clearly identifying the problem and recognizing that <br/>
it fits into &#39;x&#39; category.  (It&#39;s a personal difficulty of mine and not a <br/>
criticism of the program!)<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s why we homeschool...I don&#39;t do schedules or routines very <br/>
well.  BG<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the ideas.  More data for my brain to file.  I now have a new <br/>
brain wrinkle.  (my goal is to avoid &#39;smooth brain syndrome&#39; LOL)<br/>
