&lt;&lt; So what does a woman do? Force her dh to do it even if he has major <br/>
problems <br/>
with it?<br/>
I personally didn&#39;t have a problem getting it done. It irritated me that he <br/>
was so nervous. But it was the right move for us. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some things are an &quot;us&quot; thing, and some aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I had my tubes tied when Holly was born.  I knew I didn&#39;t want to have any <br/>
more children.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say that Keith doesn&#39;t want any more children.  <br/>
<br/>
Marriage is not for the entire life of both people.  It&#39;s until one dies.   <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my reasoning:<br/>
IF I die before Keith, leaving children, he might remarry.<br/>
<br/>
If he has had a vasectomy, he won&#39;t attract a woman who wants children.<br/>
If he attracts a woman who doesn&#39;t want children, how would she treat MY <br/>
children?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s less a concern now that Holly&#39;s about to turn 11, and all the kids are <br/>
quite verbal and in the double digits.  But when I was first thinking about <br/>
it Keith (who is younger than I am) was 35 years old.  No guarantees <br/>
whatsoever that I will live until he is past his usefulness to some other <br/>
woman in the future.<br/>
<br/>
If I were to remarry now or in the future (like if Keith died today), I&#39;m 49 <br/>
years old.  I have no business being a 70-year-old mother of a 20 year old.   <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also, Keith has that end-of-mankind fantasy going and it&#39;s important to his <br/>
fantasy life that he is fertile just in case he&#39;s one of the last few humans <br/>
on earth after catastrophic whatever.  That&#39;s no problem for me.<br/>

If a couple is not sure whether to get &quot;fixed&quot; or who should get <br/>
fixed, having your tubes tied is one solution.  Here are three others:<br/>
<br/>
1. The man can get a vasectomy, then have it reversed later.<br/>
2. If the woman is regular, you can use natural family planning until <br/>
the woman reaches the age of menopause.<br/>
3. My wife read a book called &quot;A Full Quiver&quot;.  12 years ago when we <br/>
got married, we did not intend to have children because I was 39 and <br/>
my wife at 35 had a 16yo daughter from her previous marriage.  But <br/>
then my wife read the above book and stopped taking birth control.  A <br/>
month or so later, we had our first son, then a daughter 19 months <br/>
later, then a son 19 months after that, then none for the past 9 <br/>
years.  Still not using birth control even today.  The book says that <br/>
God has a certain number of children in mind for you, and that is the <br/>
number you will have.  Seems to hold true for us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-285686434">I&#39;m saying something else.  But I had to read your post three times <br/>
before I figured out what I WAS saying.  Thanks for the chance to <br/>
clarify.  (By the way, clever use of &quot;snip&quot;.  &lt;BG&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
A month after my wife stopped the pill, she was pregnant for our son, <br/>
who was then born nine months later.  Instead of my using &quot;had&quot;, <br/>
which is often used in place of &quot;born&quot;, a clearer word might have <br/>
been &quot;conceived&quot;.  We considered him our child as soon as he was <br/>
conceived, and we&#39;ve had him ever since.  &lt;s&gt;  <br/>
