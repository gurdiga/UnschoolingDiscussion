 </span></blockquote>Yes and no.  Overall, he is much less unhappy and frustrated then he <br/>
had been.  But at the same time, he has a lot more twitches and <br/>
repetitive behaviours and he is much more fearful and in irrational <br/>
way about some things.  <br/>
<br/>
I told the therapist I feel like I&#39;m sitting in the middle of a dry <br/>
grassy field with a ring of little fires all around me.  As soon as I <br/>
get one mostly out another pops up on the other side.  That&#39;s what <br/>
it&#39;s like with him.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that part of the reason I can see more clearly that <br/>
something is definitely not right with him is because we finally got <br/>
him stable enough for the symptoms to stay the same for more than a <br/>
day at a time.  Before he was like Dr. Jeckyll, Mr. Hyde, Mr. Smith,  <br/>
Mr. Jones and several other people all rolled into one.  I never knew <br/>
what to expect from one day to the next so I couldn&#39;t figureout what <br/>
was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Bridget - and as worried as I am about him, I wouldn&#39;t want to go back <br/>
two years and have THAT kid back.</div>
