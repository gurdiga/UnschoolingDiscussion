<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776615670">This thread of discussion has went around before.  Although I DO understand <br/>
the negative connotations of certain words, the &quot;schoolish&quot; thinking that <br/>
goes behind them, and the fact that many of those words are not needed in <br/>
unschooling, I still contend that sometimes it is just a matter of <br/>
practicality to use them.<br/>
<br/>
Anna takes piano lessons.  Most times we just say &quot;piano&quot; .. But, she does <br/>
have a teacher, and she does have lessons( a specified time that she attends <br/>
each week).   Anna loves piano, she loves her teacher, she really enjoys her <br/>
lessons.  Anna calls her teacher Mrs Radar, and if someone asks &quot;who is Mrs <br/>
Radar, we will say &quot; Anna&#39;s piano teacher&quot;  Why should we say &quot; the lady who <br/>
plays piano and shows Anna how to play&quot;??   I can exchange the words &quot;playing <br/>
piano&quot; for lessons or practice, but the reality is, she practices piano.  She <br/>
practices because she wants to make progress, she wants to become better at <br/>
it.  It is HER choice.  Lots of times she just plays piano ( I can hear her <br/>
down there playing right now). <br/>
<br/>
Same thing goes for JP&#39;s baseball practice.  They have practice on Mondays <br/>
and Saturdays.   Again, we usually just leave out the word &quot;practice&quot; and <br/>
just say. &quot;you&#39;ve got baseball today&quot;  But he may ask, &quot;a game or practice&quot;?  <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Its not a matter of letting go of traditional schoolish thinking, its just a <br/>
matter of practical use of words.   I would never say the kids helping me out <br/>
in the kitchen is math &quot;lesson&quot; or cooking lesson.   I don&#39;t plan out things <br/>
to be specific learning experiences, they just turn out that way.    But, in <br/>
the proper context, I&#39;m not going to ban words that perfectly describe what <br/>
we are doing.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
In discussions of unschooling, if we use those terms, the clarity turns to <br/>
mud.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Anna calls her teacher Mrs Radar, and if someone asks &quot;who is Mrs <br/>
Radar, we will say &quot; Anna&#39;s piano teacher&quot;  Why should we say &quot; the lady who <br/>
plays piano and shows Anna how to play&quot;??  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not an unschooling situation.  If people here, in these discussions,  <br/>
use &quot;lessons&quot; and &quot;teaching&quot; about situations which are natural learning <br/>
situations, it can potentially encourage newer unschoolers to think they <br/>
still need to see lessons and to teach.  And they don&#39;t, and they shouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Same thing goes for JP&#39;s baseball practice.  They have practice on Mondays <br/>
and Saturdays.   Again, we usually just leave out the word &quot;practice&quot; and <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;But, in the proper context, I&#39;m not going to ban words that perfectly <br/>
describe what <br/>
we are doing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all about context.<br/>
<br/>
There are times kids should definitely NOT use the &quot;f&quot; word and there are <br/>
time when you can&#39;t quote something without using it.  Any rule about NEVER <br/>
using it or ALWAYS using it would be silly.<br/>
<br/>
But if I were to say that because it&#39;s okay to use it when quoting a comedy <br/>
routine or singing a South Park song that it&#39;s okay to say it full voice at <br/>
grandma&#39;s during dinner, that would make no sense whatsoever.  (And if I were <br/>
to forbid my children ever to say it until the day they die, I would just be <br/>
giving them a mandate to be sneaky and never say it in front of me.)<br/>

karate 3 times a week and baseball 2 times a week.  Right now, those two <br/>
things are his passion and they consume a lot of his time and energies.  ( <br/>
going to practice, playing at home, talking about them, reading books about <br/>
them, watching videos.. etc).  To me, they ARE  unschooling, because they are <br/>
what he is chosing to do.  Really, it doesnt matter if those things are <br/>
unschooling or not, JP loves them and we he will continue to do them as long <br/>
as he wants to.  I just did not know that there were categories that were or <br/>
were not considered unschooling, I thought it was a way of life.   <br/>

people are using it for, the discussion should not make understanding<br/>
unschooling more difficult and ideally discussions should strive to move<br/>
someone forward.<br/>
<br/>
No one should see a discussion of words as about what they personally should<br/>
or shouldn&#39;t do in the privacy of their homes, but they should see all<br/>
discussions as being about helping others unschool.<br/>
<br/>
There are new people joining all the time. And the list is oriented towards<br/>
helping them understand unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s definitely not unschooling.  It&#39;s a &quot;school&quot; in more ways than one.<br/>
<br/>
But an unschooler can take karate and still be an unschooler, he&#39;s just not <br/>
in an unschooling situation when he&#39;s at the dojo.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; To me, they ARE  unschooling, because they are <br/>
what he is chosing to do.  Really, it doesnt matter if those things are <br/>
unschooling or not, JP loves them and we he will continue to do them as long <br/>
as he wants to.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Right.  And if you&#39;re not forcing him to be in those classes, or making him <br/>
take karate &quot;for his PE credit&quot; or whatever, his experience there won&#39;t be <br/>
the same as some of the other kids&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I just did not know that there were categories that were or <br/>
were not considered unschooling, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously?<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s why you&#39;ve been so frustrated sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
When you become an unschooler it doesn&#39;t transform the rest of the world.  It <br/>
changes your stance in relationship to the rest of the world, but what&#39;s <br/>
still teacher/student run in piano classes, dojos, universities, zoo-run <br/>
children&#39;s docent programs, whatever all, is still what it is.<br/>
<br/>
How can our unschooling change what OTHER people are doing?  It just changes <br/>
how we respond to it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I thought it was a way of life. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our way of life doesn&#39;t change the karate dojo where Kirby goes.  He&#39;s <br/>
testing for a brown belt in a week or two.  (They never tell us until the <br/>
last minute, but it&#39;s this month.)  The fees won&#39;t be different because he&#39;s <br/>
an unschooler.  The forms and requirements won&#39;t be different.  The fact that <br/>
Kirby isn&#39;t in school has affected his interactions there in some subtle and <br/>
profound ways, but he&#39;s still bound by their rules because he chose to go <br/>
there.  He teaches, when he teaches, their way.  He responds to the kids <br/>
maybe a little more individuall, and he doesn&#39;t have the school-based <br/>
put-downs and analogies some of the others there have, because he just <br/>
doesn&#39;t have them inside to accidently dish out sometimes.  (The others don&#39;t <br/>
mean to, but sometimes they&#39;ll say something like &quot;You wouldn&#39;t do that in <br/>
school, would you?&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s just like in school...&quot;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-919819871">*** He&#39;s <br/>
testing for a brown belt in a week or two.***<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations to Kirby.   Good for him.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan tested for brown belt in April and it was a grueling two and a half<br/>
hours.<br/>
He had to know all the kata&#39;s and because his club is also a Tae Kwon Do<br/>
club he had to know the Taegeuk Poomse&#39;s one through eight and the<br/>
exercises.<br/>
<br/>
Gads!   The sparring was the hardest.   It came at the end of the test<br/>
when he was tired already and he sparred fifteen minutes with the first<br/>
degree brown belt who wasn&#39;t testing and wasn&#39;t tired and who is<br/>
twenty-two and TALL, and he sparred the eight other students testing for<br/>
other colored belts. <br/>
<br/>
He couldn&#39;t break the brown board and felt bad.    He felt like he could<br/>
have broken it at the start of the class but not at the end when he was<br/>
shaky and tired.    <br/>
<br/>
So, Kirby already knows it won&#39;t be easy, I guess.   He&#39;s tested before<br/>
and seen others test.    Just a warning to his mom, (if you&#39;re going to<br/>
be there).   Resist that urge to stand up and YELL at the other students<br/>
and instructors kicking your son. &lt;g&gt;   Brown belts find that<br/>
embarrassing.<br/>

<br/>
This school doesn&#39;t have that kind of test.  I think I&#39;m glad! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
The black belt test is long and involves more other people, I think.<br/>
<br/>
The sparring is kinda formalized for these (at least has been up to this <br/>
point).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s going to cost money, though, and we just paid his annual tuition/fees at <br/>
the dojo, and his gi is getting really threadbare.  <br/>
<br/>
Well...  He&#39;s healthy and these expenses can be borne.<br/>

<br/>
One of the few benefits of living in a small town, things are cheap.<br/>
We pay the dues monthly, which is easier than coming up with it all at<br/>
once, and the testing fee&#39;s haven&#39;t been too high yet. <br/>
<br/>
Testing for black belt will be expensive here, though.  Because of the<br/>
Tae Kwon Do affiliation he&#39;ll have to test in another town and be judged<br/>
by a Master.   Apparently Master&#39;s aren&#39;t cheap.    Hopefully that&#39;s a<br/>
few years away.<br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;re off to his class right now...<br/>
