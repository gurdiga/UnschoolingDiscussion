I like your sense of humor ;-)   although there are some definate truths in what you said... what is that saying... &quot;there is always truth in jest?&quot;...<br/>

Do you have copies of that video??<br/>

  &gt; ~heather asks, in fun,<br/>
  &gt; Ps-  and Ned - what is hell anyway ;-) just kidding -<br/>
<br/>
  Hell is listening to young mothers taling about what curriculum to stuff<br/>
  down their kid&#39;s throat this year. Hell is watching parent smack their<br/>
  children in the supermarket because they reached out and touched something<br/>
  irresistable on a shelf.<br/>
<br/>
  Hell is imagining a Hell just because some fool said it exists and I should<br/>
  fear going there after I live a life of doing my best whether it exists or<br/>
  not.<br/>
<br/>
  Are we off topic yet? ....No?....   OK,  Hell is missing short putts. Hell<br/>
  is homework. I&#39;ve made several hour-long TV programs,  called &quot;School is<br/>
  Hell&quot; and they play regularly on cable access hereabouts. I&#39;m sure those<br/>
  make a little Hell for the local school pushers. (anyone want copies?)<br/>
  (now I have to say &quot;no wink intended,&quot; when I follow a question mark with a<br/>
  ) <br/>
<br/>
  Hell is caring what other people think.<br/>
