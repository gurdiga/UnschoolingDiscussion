<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246642223">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say thanks for the warm welcome and reading<br/>
suggestions... will definitely check out Dr. Sears and the La Leche<br/>
League site (I visited it before, but didn&#39;t notice the reading list I<br/>
guess... will go back!). I do intend to breastfeed exclusively, and for<br/>
at least a year.  And I&#39;m writing down the other books folks have<br/>
suggested, will take that to the library next time I go. Thank you!!<br/>
<br/>
I also want to rescind my request for more on the discipline/spanking<br/>
topic... apparently that thread was dead by the time my email made it to<br/>
the list anyway... and besides, it&#39;s not going to be an issue for me for<br/>
quite some time!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for me to keep up with the posts and make timely<br/>
suggestions... had one for the cats though... if yours have a history of<br/>
FUS (urinary trouble), esp. males, avoid fish ingredients in the food,<br/>
and/or feed Purina Special Care. All my cats are on it because one had a<br/>
near-fatal bout of FUS a few years ago. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing I have to mention re: allergies and yeast infections...<br/>
especially when a yeast infection is the result of a course of<br/>
antibiotics, take acidophilus supplements and/or eat lots of yogurt with<br/>
live cultures after the course. It will restore the bacterial balance<br/>
and (hopefully) prevent the yeast, and you can avoid antifungal drugs.<br/>
I&#39;ve successfully cured vaginal yeast with dilute yogurt douches, also a<br/>
combo of calendula (marigold) tea and vinegar water (using them<br/>
alternately, not together). <br/>
<br/>
Take care!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-542435173">Nicole, welcome!  the previous reading suggestions are great, I&#39;d <br/>
second that most things to do with parenting are covered well and <br/>
supportively by LLL approved literature.  I&#39;d add a book I found <br/>
recently in our main library in town, The Birth of a Mother, <br/>
perhaps not one for reading while one&#39;s up to one&#39;s ears in nappies <br/>
and milk, but a good insight into the psychological processes of <br/>
becoming a mother.  Bill and Martha Sears&#39; books sometimes <br/>
have off-putting titles like &#39;The Discipline Book,&#39; but they are the <br/>
modern &#39;god-parents,&#39; almost, of what we now call attachment <br/>
parenting.  Their &#39;Baby Book&#39; would be top of my list to give to <br/>
pregnant friends if I wasn&#39;t sure they were intending to <br/>
breastfeed, it has a good chapter on bottlefeeding which, by the <br/>
time one has read it will make one want to breastfeed!  On the <br/>
subject of discipline, I think it&#39;s never too early to start, and by that <br/>
I mean to take from the Latin roots of &#39;discipline,&#39; which are to do <br/>
with leading.  The best discipline, IMO, is respecting one&#39;s child, <br/>
and as LLL says, &#39;from infancy on, children need loving guidance <br/>
which reflects acceptance of their capabilities and sensitivity to <br/>
their feelings.&#39;  I need this tattoo-ing on the inside of my eyelids I <br/>
think!!  <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes for your birth, had a home-birth with no2, was great!<br/>
