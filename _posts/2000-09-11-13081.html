<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590976196">A man in a hot air balloon realized he was lost. He reduced altitude and<br/>
 spotted a woman below. He descended a bit more and shouted, &quot;Excuse me,<br/>
 can<br/>
 you help me? I promised a friend I would meet him an hour ago, but I<br/>
 don&#39;t<br/>
 know where I am.&quot;<br/>
 The woman below replied, &quot;You are in a hot air balloon hovering<br/>
 approximately 30 feet above the ground. You are between 40 and 41 degrees<br/>
 north latitude and between 59 and 60 degrees west longitude.<br/>
 &quot;You must be an engineer,&quot; said the balloonist.<br/>
 &quot;I am,&quot; replied the woman, &quot;How did you know?&quot;<br/>
 &quot;Well,&quot; answered the balloonist, &quot;everything you told me is technically<br/>
 correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and the<br/>
 fact<br/>
 is I am still lost. Frankly, you&#39;ve not been much help so far.&quot;<br/>
 The woman below responded, &quot;You must be a manager.&quot;<br/>
 &quot;I am,&quot; replied the balloonist, &quot;but how did you know?&quot;<br/>
 &quot;Well,&quot; said the woman, &quot;you don&#39;t know where you are or where you are<br/>
 going. You have risen to where you are due to a large quantity of hot<br/>
 air.<br/>
 You made a promise which you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me<br/>
 to<br/>
 solve your problem.  The fact is you are in exactly the same position you<br/>
 were in before we met, but now, somehow, it&#39;s my fault.</div>
