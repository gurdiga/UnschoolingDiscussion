<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224592613">&lt;&lt;I&#39;m trying to completely stop eating trans-fats...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m moving toward raw foods myself, nothing cooked more than homemade<br/>
yogurt.  That should help with the trans-fats, if you are interested.  It is<br/>
only my first week but I already feel more energetic.<br/>
<br/>
I had found that no matter how little I ate or how much I worked out that I<br/>
simply continued to gain weight, until I saw my reflection in the mirror as<br/>
resembling a bullfrog.  I already feel less bloated.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see how it goes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-349797470">My 19 year old son wants to try again to get his<br/>
permit, but can&#39;t learn by reading the book, he is a<br/>
visual learner.  He tried reading the book the first<br/>
time and failed misreably.  I was wondering if there<br/>
is a video available.  I went on to the California DMV<br/>
website and there was nothing.  Any ideas would be<br/>
appreciated.  (I have already tried reading him the<br/>
book).<br/>

<br/>
I just saw a strange picture in a magazine of people planning some movie<br/>
stunts moving little cars on the ground and making chalk marks.  So, you<br/>
could act out the rules with props (unless it would seem really stupid<br/>
and babyish to your son).<br/>
<br/>
I think you might also take every rule and find a street location, not<br/>
too far from your house, where it applies.  Then maybe you could drive<br/>
the route and talk about each rule.  Maybe your son could drive the<br/>
route and you could tell each rule at the pertinent point.<br/>
<br/>
There also must be curriculum suppliers who sell materials to public<br/>
schools and public school teachers.  You could maybe find something on<br/>
the web that sells driver&#39;s ed materials.  Or perhaps a website that<br/>
rents videos or DVDs by mail that might have the kind of video you wanted.<br/>
