&lt;&lt; Did your cats have any period of  adjustment to<br/>
the box?  Has it ever started it&#39;s cleaning cycle while the  cat was in the<br/>
box?<br/>
<br/>
Is yours the &quot;littermaid&quot; brand?  I know there are two of them on the<br/>
market right now.??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes we have been through 2 of them and both were Littermaid. Cats didn&#39;t<br/>
have any problem at all adjusting. And no the thing won&#39;t start with a cat<br/>
inside. In fact just the other day was the first time I saw it stop when it<br/>
detected something still inside. It was me putting in more litter but the<br/>
sensors picked it up and stopped right away. I would never use anything else<br/>
now.<br/>
