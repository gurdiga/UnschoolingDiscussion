<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063216948">Just want to let people know for future reference that our mayor continues to call for evacuations and refuses to open up shelters.  But it&#39;s impossible.<br/>
 <br/>
We tried to leave but there is no way out of Houston.  There is no gas and no space on the highways.  People&#39;s cars are dying on the road from overheating (it&#39;s almost 100 degrees) or lack of gas and they&#39;re not moving anywhere anyway.  They&#39;re using the bathroom at the sides of the road because they&#39;re so stuck.  Even when opening the contraflow lanes, it takes only 5 minutes for them to become so packed they&#39;re at a stand still.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m afraid the national media will make it look like a very organized effort with the government completely in charge.  That&#39;s because they, the officials, think they are.  They aren&#39;t out here with the rest of us, standing in line for the last of necessities, worried sick because *we can&#39;t leave*!.  Eventually, they&#39;ll take their helicopter rides at the tax payer&#39;s expense to safety and we&#39;ll still be here scared to death.  <br/>
 <br/>
We stayed this long because my dh was busy working for the state making sure abused children were evacuated.  Little did we know we would be stuck and the city would refuse to open shelters in sturdier buildings.  I&#39;m sure they will eventually but most of the city&#39;s poor are not in the madatory evac areas and therefore don&#39;t qualify for free transportation out.  Most of the city is not under madatory evacuation and buses will stop running soon.  There will be no way for people to get to the shelters.<br/>
 <br/>
So, I guess we&#39;re staying put.  We&#39;re pretty well stocked except for water.  Oh well, should be a wonderful unschooling adventure. :-/<br/>

Oh Holly - what about at least finding basements or storm shelters...what  <br/>
about churches?  Are there any churches with big basements that can take  people <br/>
in who can&#39;t get out of town?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002527281">Yes, we&#39;ll be doing that.  We also have very large containers (I think 10 gallons each) that I&#39;ll be filling and putting bleach in but that will be water of last resort since I can&#39;t really clean the old containers.  Plus we bought lost of cheap sugary drinks. BLECH!  They don&#39;t do much to quench thrist IMO but my hope is they&#39;ll keep us alive if need be.  Anyway, that&#39;s all that&#39;s left.<br/>
 <br/>
BTW, we have received word of the where the shleters will be.  They will be opening after the storm.  I can&#39;t wait for the next election.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781153884">Houston doesn&#39;t have basments. :-)  We are on a swamp and the ground water is too high.  And, as I just posted, the shelters will open *after* the storms.  Some people got more votes than sense.<br/>
 <br/>
My husband&#39;s office building is square (that helps keep the roof on) and made of concrete so we&#39;ll go there.  It&#39;s a huge building and most of the rooms are in the interior.  He has a key.  We&#39;re taking the animals and we expect others to be there too since thay all had to work yesterday so we hope there are no problems with that.  My dogs are now my career since I started a dog training business and I need them as demo dogs.  It takes about 2 years to train them the way I need them.  I won&#39;t leave them behind.<br/>
 <br/>
Yesterday, my 11 dd asked about taking her hamster.  I told her he would be fine if we left him and the tears...How could I say no?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-418432645">Holly, I&#39;m so sorry to hear that.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been watching CNN and MSNBC all day, and no, the media is not  reporting <br/>
how orderly and organized it is.  All the stories are about the  traffic jam. <br/>
 I have also been listening to the Houston radio station I  posted and it&#39;s <br/>
bad out there.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m in Arkansas.  I want to go help, but I can&#39;t.  I keep  thinking of some <br/>
way I can (since Katrina hit, too).  I&#39;ve already made my  donation to the Red <br/>
Cross.  It&#39;s a helpless feeling.<br/>

I know you can&#39;t get out and you&#39;ve had other offers closer in, but I have  <br/>
dogs and hamsters and your would be welcome at my house.  All of  you would, of <br/>
course!  If you have to go to a shelter where they can&#39;t take  them, I will <br/>
be willing to drive to get them.<br/>
