<div id="ygrps-yiv-461822188">-=- I read the Unschooling <br/>
Handbook and, well, never looked back. . .  .-=-<br/>
<br/>
From  time to time I get hung up on &quot;homeschooling&quot; because part of <br/>
me really  feels like she will really enjoy life more if &quot;she&#39;d just <br/>
learn to  read!&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How is that not &quot;looking back&quot;?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
-=-but she is teaching herself to some degree-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Learning on her own.<br/>
Teaching is something different from learning.<br/>

 <br/>
I think six is too young to think about speech therapy.  WAY too  young.<br/>
And it&#39;s way too young to worry about reading.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I still can&#39;t seem to get the house <br/>
organized and I&#39;m not used to  focusing on &quot;play&quot; with Jocelyn. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Make a schedule and go somewhere every other day, even if it&#39;s just to a  <br/>
grocery store you don&#39;t usually go to.  You and Jocelyn go out every other  day, <br/>
somewhere.  Picnic.  Visit a friend.  Museum.   Hike.  That minor structure <br/>
will lead to other things to do, discuss, look  up, build, want and think about.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- Maybe posting this novella will be all I need (so sorry -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Therapeutic writing is what makes these lists work! don&#39;t be sorry.<br/>
Everyone who reads what you wrote will think as she/he reads &quot;Me too,&quot; or  &quot;I <br/>
used to&quot; or &quot;I haven&#39;t had that problem (yet).&quot;   That&#39;s helpful to  you and <br/>
the readers all, then.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve gone through angsty confused seasons.  Maybe everyone has.   That lack <br/>
of direction seems to presage a really solid, inspired season.   Or maybe it&#39;s <br/>
just that statistically nobody can average out all the time, and  there WILL <br/>
be ups and downs.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- A great story, website, anything!-=-<br/>
 <br/>
There are typical days and some special days here:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>THANK YOU...I know that. Really I do. Again it&#39;s that pressure I <br/>
allow to get to me; the looks from strangers or the questions from <br/>
unsupportive relatives and then question my own gut. Thanks for that <br/>
blank reminder that I KNOW where we are going with this. She is 6. <br/>
I&#39;m going to say that everytime I get that look.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ahhh! Clarity. Again, thank you....I am just coming out of 2 years <br/>
of creative overload...I need a spiritual rest. I need to stop. It&#39;s <br/>
best for now.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I am looking forward to reading about Holly. I remember reading <br/>
about her several years ago......I remember you from some place on <br/>
the net, Sandra. I need these reminders. I am emensly grateful and <br/>
emotional for the response right now.......I can&#39;t explain it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you</div>
