<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754061248">I just realized that my relationship with my kids has taken on new <br/>
meaning for me. I love 18-month-olds and 2-year-olds, and my youngest <br/>
just turned 3. That means if I want to be around my grandkids at that <br/>
age, my kids have to want to be around me. Ack!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I think the thing to remember is number one, many people that are pushed have <br/>
&gt;horrible relationships with their parents. If an Olympic Gold medalist was my <br/>
&gt;priority, not a peaceful, happy relationship, then maybe that would be a good <br/>
&gt;approach.<br/>
