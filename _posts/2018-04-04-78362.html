<div id="ygrps-yiv-791419466">This transcript wasn’t so easy to do! <br/>
And I’ve added some links and illustrations.  You can read along with the YouTube video of me and Kirby being interviewed in 2010.<br/>

<br/>
At first, when the film Class Dismissed came out (which you can rent online, at a link you can get to from Youtube if you click through), the individual interviews were not available, and then for a few years you could buy or rent them.  <br/>
<br/>
I accidentally came across the upload of this one, to YouTube.  Working with the automatically-generated subtitles (which are crazy, mostly), I edited and formatted it.  <br/>
<br/>
There may be errors or typos, and if you find any and let me know, I can fix them. <br/>
<br/>
It seems sometimes I didn’t answer the question.  Sometimes I didn’t.  :-)  I do go off on tangents.  <br/>
<br/>
When you have an hour to fall into a hole, though, this one might be an option. :-)<br/>
