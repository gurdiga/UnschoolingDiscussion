<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194410126"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;They have lots of food restrictions, limited media exposure&gt; disney is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>evil tv is evil, coorporate monsters that will make &gt;your child<br/>
materialistic, unimaginative and violent) and rots &gt;your brain, <br/>
<br/>
fitting under most of your description here (yes, i admit it...i&#39;m a<br/>
crunchy mama!  don&#39;t shoot!), i&#39;d like to take a moment and address some<br/>
issues that have popped up for me.  i do believe that disney is evil. <br/>
the company&#39;s motive in existing is to manipulate children and their<br/>
families to make profits.  i don&#39;t fear that my children (who happen to<br/>
adore disney everything despite my disdain) will fall into this trap,<br/>
however, because we talk a lot about advertising, commercialism, and<br/>
materialism in this house and i believe that they&#39;re saavy enough to<br/>
avoid it.  doesn&#39;t discount that disney sucks and materialism is a huge<br/>
problem in the world.  i don&#39;t think it&#39;s a negative or snobby thing to<br/>
be aware of these problems.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;waldorfy toys, no plastic toys, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we prefer to buy (and make) these sorts of toys because we choose to try<br/>
and tread lightly on the earth.  i think it does an injustice to our<br/>
children and their future to ignore the harm that the manufacturing of<br/>
these products does, not to mention what mess is left behind when they<br/>
break and go to the landfill.  and that doesn&#39;t even touch the child<br/>
labor issues.  this also doesn&#39;t feel like a snobbery issue.  my kids<br/>
have plasticy toys that they&#39;ve gotten as gifts, or they bought for<br/>
themselves, and even a few that we&#39;ve bought because they really wanted<br/>
them...but i don&#39;t think it&#39;s unwise to try and choose lower impact toys<br/>
and talk to your kids about the issues and why it&#39;s important to you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Organic foods only, no sugar or hydrogenated whatever.  (don&#39;t &gt;eat the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>baked goods).  Just kidding, some is fine.  But, very &gt;restrictive in my<br/>
opinion.  <br/>
<br/>
i know it sounds restrictive...and maybe it is with the folks you&#39;re<br/>
talking about specifically.  but for my family, it&#39;s about values.  we<br/>
value healthy bodies and a healthy earth as well as personal choices. <br/>
and instead of being a dictator and demanding my kids never play with<br/>
plastic toys or eat refined foods, we talk to them about what the impact<br/>
of these choices are and let them choose.  i&#39;m a crunchy veggie mama who<br/>
prefers certain things, but has kids with their own minds who have eaten<br/>
ham and fish when away from home(tho veggie as well) and candy (sometimes<br/>
including food coloring) and cookies (even with unwholesome ingredients),<br/>
play with plastic toys when they want (but usually choose not to), and<br/>
watch plenty of advertising-overloaded, schooly type cartoons by choice. <br/>
not all of us are as judgmental or restrictive as you&#39;ve experienced!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But, I do feel a little judged when I bring a pepsi or fast &gt;food for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lunch.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Laura J<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i hear ya!  the same happens to me.  but does it really matter if you&#39;re<br/>
ok with your choices?  for me, the twinge of embarassment comes from<br/>
knowing it&#39;s perhaps not the best thing i could be ingesting.  but, if i<br/>
want it...i eat it anyways and ignore the snootiness. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-570081345">Hi Lisa,<br/>
It sounds like you are one of the crunchy mamas that I like hanging out with.  Most are totally cool about things, most of my friends are in the crunchy category.  We fit there more than we fit in the mainstream, but mostly with parenting issues.  Most are into organics, which is great, if you can cook and can afford it.  Most of my friends are in a co-op, in fact, I&#39;m one of the few that aren&#39;t.  The cooking and money issue for us.  We definitely talk a great deal about commercialism and materialism with our son.  My folks work for Disney seasonally, so we have a lot of it around from them.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I was mostly referring to the snobbery you referred to.  Kind of the superior attitude that you would find in most any group if it were large enough.  But, it&#39;s sometimes hard to have such high standards for everything that people can&#39;t relax about things.  They like to brag that their kids have never had any processed sugar or artificial dyes.  Granted, their kids are young, but that is such an impossible standard to meet.  What pressure.  The group of moms I was referring to, and I have to admit, it sounded like a generalization, so I apologize for that, these moms are full of unsolicited advice, and have even done the shame-shame finger thing to me for letting my 3 year old watch Star Wars.  I wasn&#39;t around them for long.  Very uptight and too serious about every little thing.  I moved on.  But, most of my friends are fairly crunchy mamas, so I&#39;m definitely not &quot;anti crunchy&quot;, I&#39;m &quot;anti-judgmental&quot; and pro live and let live.<br/>

aren&#39;t.  The cooking and money issue &gt;for us.<br/>
<br/>
i hear ya on the money front!  we can&#39;t afford much of what we&#39;d prefer<br/>
to buy these days even through our co-op.  it&#39;s a bummer how expensive it<br/>
can be to buy wholesome, clean food.  we are fortunate enough to have a<br/>
friend with a farm that isn&#39;t certified, but they don&#39;t use pesticides or<br/>
chemicals on their crops, so we buy from them and grow whatever we can,<br/>
which helps a ton with the cost issue.  what about cooking is an issue<br/>
for you?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>with our son.  My folks work for Disney &gt;seasonally, so we have a lot of<br/>
it around from them. <br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s funny how kids so young can be so interested in such things...i<br/>
wouldn&#39;t lecture my kids about it or take the disney stuff away or<br/>
anything, but they&#39;re interested (probably because we are!), so we talk. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
i do know what you&#39;re referring to.  seems there are always people out<br/>
there dishing *the truth*. ;)  even worse when they expect that you&#39;ll<br/>
bow down and follow their lead.  in my experience, it&#39;s not the crunchy<br/>
mamas...they&#39;re the most in tune and genuine folks i know.  but snobbery<br/>
comes in lots of coats...no one group or type of person is immune.:)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But, it&#39;s sometimes hard to have such high standards for &gt;everything<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that people can&#39;t relax about things.  <br/>
<br/>
no kidding.  having standards and expectations for anyone but yourself<br/>
never does any good!  you can&#39;t force someone to be other than<br/>
themselves...trying only brings loads of undue frustration. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;They like to brag that their kids have never had any processed &gt;sugar or<br/>

<br/>
ugh.  that sound corny.  what a thing to brag about.  maybe be astounded<br/>
at the sudden realization...but brag? isn&#39;t there more to enjoy about<br/>
kids?  sheesh.  can&#39;t blame you for being annoyed.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
good for you!  it certainly doesn&#39;t make sense to hang out with people<br/>
like that.  life&#39;s too short.  especially when there are plenty of<br/>
wonderful, loving, non-judgmental folks out there who can help you shine.<br/>

Very negative terminology.   Brussel sprouts just sit there.  They have no <br/>
intent or motivation.  If you don&#39;t like them, that&#39;s something in and about you <br/>
yourself.  And that&#39;s fine.  My  husband hates peas. I don&#39;t much like bell <br/>
peppers.  But Holly does, and that&#39;s wonderful for her.<br/>
<br/>
I always hope that my own prejudices or aversions are not passed on to my <br/>
children.  If they can be happier than I am, more open, and more positive in any <br/>
aspect or corner of life, I rejoice.<br/>

&gt; *anti-social behavior in pursuit of a product is a good thing.*  they<br/>
&gt; wanted to get kids to get so wrapped up in their products that they&#39;d bug<br/>
&gt; their parents to death and buy stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if you let go of what Disney detractors are saying you should be seeing<br/>
and look around at real life (outside your own home full of Disney lovers!<br/>
;-), are Disney&#39;s tactics working any better than anyone else&#39;s? Are we as a<br/>
society drowning in a sea of Disney? (The Disney Stores in our area are all<br/>
closed.) My daughter likes what she likes and only a small percentage was<br/>
every Disney.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you&#39;re over sensitive to Disney because your kids love Disney?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we prefer to buy (and make) these sorts of toys because we choose to try<br/>
&gt; and tread lightly on the earth.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re thinking will be clearer if you identify the &quot;we&quot; as your<br/>
husband and you rather than &quot;we&quot; the family.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a difference between sharing why I make the decisions I do and<br/>
sharing information to influence the decisions my daughter makes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i think it does an injustice to our<br/>
&gt; children and their future to ignore the harm that the manufacturing of<br/>
&gt; these products does, not to mention what mess is left behind when they<br/>
&gt; break and go to the landfill.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I choose paper bags over plastic. I use as little plastic wrap as possible.<br/>
I prefer glass bottles over plastic (though it&#39;s getting harder to do that.)<br/>
None of those are perfect choices and each impacts the environment in its<br/>
own way. But it&#39;s a principle and makes me feel better.<br/>
<br/>
*BUT* I&#39;m betting more plastic comes into one Wal-Mart wrapped around<br/>
pallets of boxes in one day than I could possibly use to wrap food with in<br/>
my entire life even if I were the Saran Wrap queen.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m betting there&#39;s more plastic wrapping a single building that&#39;s being<br/>
worked on than my daughter could throw out in all the toys she&#39;s ever owned.<br/>
(And she has a lot of plastic.)<br/>
<br/>
I think even if every toy ever made ends up in the land fill it isn&#39;t even a<br/>
tiny percentage of the plastic that&#39;s wasted elsewhere, especially in<br/>
manufacturing, construction and shipping.<br/>
<br/>
The impact of the guilt on a child over liking a toy made of plastic is<br/>
*way* out of proportion to the impact of the toy on the environment.<br/>
<br/>
I think if we want to share our values on practices where the harm is only<br/>
potential and is several layers removed from us, it helps kids see the<br/>
issues more clearly if we aren&#39;t sharing our values in ways that will<br/>
influence their choices. Kids shouldn&#39;t feel they&#39;re in the position of<br/>
choosing between a plastic toy or a clean environment. They should choose<br/>
non-plastic because it&#39;s an important principle to them, not because they<br/>
believe giving up one plastic toy or a dozen plastic toys will have a<br/>
significant impact on the environment.<br/>

<br/>
Thinking in terms of what kids should know and believe is wandering into<br/>
school think. Discussing ways to &quot;make sure&quot; kids believe something (though<br/>
we really can&#39;t!) are better for conventional parenting lists.<br/>
<br/>
But that doesn&#39;t mean our only option is to leave it up to chance! We can<br/>
put respect for the child first and *still* pass on our values. (They may<br/>
not adopt our values, but trying to impose our values doesn&#39;t guarantee<br/>
they&#39;ll adopt them either.)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter lives with someone who lives the values of caring about the<br/>
environment. I share why I make the choices I do for myself about minimizing<br/>
limited-use plastic, walking when it&#39;s feasible, using a car that gets good<br/>
gas mileage and so on. That has left her free to think about it and make the<br/>
choices for herself because I&#39;m allowing her to think about the idea<br/>
separate from herself.<br/>
<br/>
Once an idea makes sense to someone, then people can decide whether the<br/>
ideas are important enough to them to change their choices.<br/>
<br/>
(And my daughter does care about the environment. But she was free to choose<br/>
not to.)<br/>
<br/>
But if we tangle up passing on the values with helping them make the &quot;right&quot;<br/>
choices according to the value system we want them to adopt, then we&#39;re<br/>
doing exactly what school parents do by making kids feel wrong for prefering<br/>
fun to school work.<br/>
<br/>
(And with as much credibility. It would be spinning a huge whopping lie to<br/>
stand in front of a building wrapped in plastic and try to get the child to<br/>
understand how that plastic toy they want has a negative impact on the<br/>
environment. Giving up a plastic toy should be a personal choice based on<br/>
principle because the toy has essentially nil impact on the environment<br/>
compared to the plastic used in manufacturing and so forth.)<br/>
<br/>
Free choice works better than guilt. For one thing, free choice allows<br/>
someone to adopt the values whenever the feel they make sense. Guilt gives<br/>
them the choice between adopting values with guilt for wanting something<br/>
that goes against the values or rejecting the values in order to reject the<br/>
guilt and get what they want.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Thats a bit like saying don&#39;t try and steer them toowards a healthy diet so<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Same thing. We can live our values and let them choose. We can choose to<br/>
prepare what we feel are healthy foods and make healthy food easily<br/>
available while also allowing them to make their own choices at restaurants<br/>
and requests for snacks from the grocery story or choosing an alternative<br/>
(like cereal) if they don&#39;t like dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Brushing teeth has a special factor in that kids often don&#39;t like to do it.<br/>
But we can remove as many negative aspects of brushing teeth as possible<br/>
like brushing without paste and doing it with them and for them and all the<br/>
other suggestions that have wandered through here. And we can tell them why<br/>
we choose to brush.<br/>

they tread on the earth (by buying all natural peanut butter for <br/>
example) and then hop in their cars to drive home.  The computer <br/>

If a child turns 30 and does NOT have those problems, but did suffer a <br/>

<br/>
If she wants to do that, good!  <br/>
If she spends all her energy imagining something that&#39;s not realistic, that&#39;s <br/>
not as good.<br/>
<br/>
There were times in the past when pollution was worse.  The nineteenth <br/>
century left the early 20th century with a lot of pollution.   They left other <br/>
generations with a mess.   My parents left my generation with a social and <br/>
emotional mess.  But they were dealing with world wars and other realities not of <br/>
their doing, and that they couldn&#39;t have prevented.<br/>
<br/>
The world moves on.   Depriving children of plastic toys will no more turn <br/>
the tide than throwing a virgin in a volcano will change geology.   If it makes <br/>
the parents feel better to make their own toys, that&#39;s cool IF the children <br/>
like those toys better.   If the parents insist the child lives and likes to <br/>
suit the parents, that&#39;s not as cool.<br/>

I never said I didn&#39;t offer them choices. I explained my views and let them find out for themselves. They make some choices I don&#39;t like but they are free to do so.<br/>

But I also think that they, and we and society are gonna have to make some unpalatable choices soon enough whether George Bush believes in global warming or not. Leting &#39;natural consequences&#39; teach hard lessons can sometimes be cruel.<br/>

not saying that i won&#39;t get it.  i&#39;m just saying that that isn&#39;t<br/>
typically the case.  we have an extremely limited budget and the kids<br/>
honestly rarely get gifts.  when asked what they&#39;d like, they usually ask<br/>
for something that is easily made.  we sometimes make things together<br/>
(which makes them feel amazingly accomplished), or my dh and i will come<br/>
up with something.  i also would prefer to buy something made by an<br/>
actual person. my kids are delighted and thankful for everything they<br/>
have.  they have never expressed any sentiment like *i don&#39;t like your<br/>
homemade dollies mama, i wish i had a plastic baby from the store.* <br/>
granted, this wouldn&#39;t work if they chose a leap pad or something...i<br/>
can&#39;t sew up one of those. ;) i would buy it if we could afford it. <br/>
there are a lot of factors at play in our lives and we all make value<br/>
based decisions within those guidelines.  i don&#39;t see how any of this is<br/>
negatively impacting my kids.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Kids shouldn&#39;t feel they&#39;re in the position of<br/>
&gt;choosing between a plastic toy or a clean environment. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i agree. and my children don&#39;t.  they don&#39;t have any grasp on just how in<br/>
danger the environment is.  i don&#39;t choose to fill them with fear and<br/>
worry.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;They should choose<br/>
&gt;non-plastic because it&#39;s an important principle to them, not &gt;because<br/>
 </span></blockquote>they<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;believe giving up one plastic toy or a dozen plastic toys will &gt;have a<br/>
&gt;significant impact on the environment.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this hasn&#39;t become an issue in our home.  my kids don&#39;t freak out about<br/>
having plastic toys.  they have fun with them if they&#39;re entertaining. <br/>
we just don&#39;t happen to have a lot.  we don&#39;t have a lot of anything. <br/>
if, when they&#39;re older, they ask for plastic things, we&#39;ll look into the<br/>
reviews of the product and buy them if we can.  money is a huge issue for<br/>
us and we prefer to avoid buying anything that will end up being junk<br/>
(whether made from wood or plastic or anything else.)  if they want to<br/>
spend their hard earned money on things that are plastic, no problem. <br/>
it&#39;s their choice.  i&#39;ve had to turn down buying beautifully handmade<br/>
things that they&#39;ve wanted many more times than plastic simply because of<br/>
the cost. <br/>

By the time his brother came along, ten years later, they changed dramatically.  They were living in a house, early daycare, mainstream diet and everything else.<br/>
<br/>
My BIL is way crunchy.  Raw foods only, no media at all and will probably move to the woods someday to live off the land.  A wonderful, very spiritual person who is totally involved with environmental groups.<br/>
<br/>
No point here, I just find it so interesting to see the differences within the same family over time.  The brothers lived very differently and are really different in many ways.  Opposite of how their parents lived.  Similar in some ways, temperament for one, but so very different in their current lives and beliefs.<br/>

I live in a desert and we&#39;ve had drought for three years.  <br/>
<br/>
If a kid threw a quart of water on the driveway instead of under a tree or on <br/>
the flowers, it would be really crazy and kind of infuriating.  They know <br/>
that water that&#39;s being thrown out should be thrown where it will do some good.<br/>
<br/>
When it does rain here, it often just opens up  and dumps.  We&#39;re a mile high <br/>
and on a slope, so it bangs down and runs off.   Still, if a kid has a quart <br/>
of water and throws it in a puddle, that was no harm whatsoever.    No sense <br/>
walking out in the rain and pouring that water on a plant with it raining.<br/>
<br/>
If the real problem is packaging and not the toy inside, maybe your family <br/>
could study that problem and find out why people use so much plastic packaging.  <br/>
 Remember to wonder whether you&#39;d like to buy aspirin out of a common bin, or <br/>

 <br/>
My kids know why I feel the way I do, we talk about it all the time. Do I hope they grow up with the same values? You betcha. Will they? Not neccessarily. I have three kids who are &quot;old enough&quot; to test the theory so far at 26, 17, and 15. Of those three, two have chosen to also boycott Nestle and and one doesn&#39;t care. None of them are much into Disney or plastic, I guess the future will tell if they take the grandkids to Disneyland and buy them plastic toys galore. :-)<br/>

Do I care? No. They may do what they chose with their money, just as I chose how to spend my money. When they were younger, they could buy a Butterfinger with their allowance, have one at someone else&#39;s home, get one as a gift. They wouldn&#39;t get one from me. If they asked for one at the store, I would tell them that they needed to pick a different candy, mommy doesn&#39;t buy Nestle.<br/>
 <br/>
I love my kids, and I respect their choices, but I respect my own choices as well. Not using a lot of plastic is important to me, it is how I chose to do what I can do as one individual. I do not want my kids to grow up thinking that their individual acts of selflessness, of service, of kindness, have less meaning because they alone can&#39;t fix the whole problem. I want them to feel that their actions matter, in some small but significant way.<br/>
 <br/>
In the same way I feel that my unschooling my small family of children (well, 5 isn&#39;t so small, I guess, but you get the drift) will have a positive impact on our society. Maybe my 5 won&#39;t begin to outweigh the hundreds of thousands of kids their age who are schooled, but I still feel that my contribution is important and meaningful, to myself, my family and my community, even if it is small. I also feel that my family&#39;s boycott of Nestle, our limiting plastic, and our acknowledging the manipulation and civil rights violations of Disny is important and meaningful.<br/>
 <br/>
Perhaps living with parents who are passsionate has it&#39;s downside. You certainly do have to wait until you are older to act upon your ultimate decisions on some issues. However, living with passionate people has it&#39;s upside. You get to unschool, and you get to have interesting conversations at the dinner table. My children can articulate their beliefs and defend their opinions with aplomb. They do not always agree with us, and sometimes in very important ways. We have a couple who have chosen to go back to public school after years of unschooling, and I am not a fan of public school in the least. That did not influence their decision, and it does not affect our relationship now that they ahve made a different choice than I would make.<br/>
 <br/>
Part of my respect for my children is my belief that they will not just follow blindly in my footsteps, but have the education and the personality and the respect for their own beliefs to follow their own heart when the time comes. So far that has proven to be true.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I have the first and the third. And yes, I thank my parents. In some respects (learning, curiousity, courage) they gave me great examples and much freedom. They laid a foundation for me to make good decisions about how I live and not because I was steered or guided but because so much was possible as a kid. If they&#39;d restricted the candy I might have nicer, less painful teeth, but I might also have some resentment. If my toys had all been wood or I was made to make sacrifices or feel guilty for our environment there might have been some small difference but I might never want to recycle another bottle again. <br/>
   We have our kids for a couple of decades. Then they have 50 or more years to live by their own rules. You can guide and coerce and cajol and watch them rebel or follow your wishes through thoughtless habit or you can let them have their freedom and watch as they lay a proper foundation for a secure adulthood where decisions are based on their own thoughts and their own feelings. <br/>
    I just had a molar pulled, went bad because of an old deep cavity and it hurt like sin for a week. I didn&#39;t blame my parents. I recognize what that in the bigger picture of the free and loving childhood I had, one that led me to unschooling ultimately, a tooth is a small sacrifice.<br/>
