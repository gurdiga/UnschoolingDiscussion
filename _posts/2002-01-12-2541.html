<div id="ygrps-yiv-124343726">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s my 10 cents worth.... Before I had children I thought I would<br/>
breastfeed anywhere and everywhere and that it would be other people&#39;s<br/>
problem if they didn&#39;t like it.  They didn&#39;t have to look.... When I had Max<br/>
(my youngest)... I was breastfeeding him in my living room and my parents<br/>
came over (my mother and step-father)... All of a sudden I was really<br/>
uncomfortable breast feeding in front of this man, even though I&#39;ve known<br/>
him 20 years and he wasn&#39;t staring.  I had to take myself off into the<br/>
bedroom because I love of this as a bonding moment with my son that I did<br/>
not want to share with my family watching.  It was the strangest feeling....<br/>
I nursed in public very rarely.... usually nursing before we went out or<br/>
when we came back... I just found I was uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Now here&#39;s the other side of the story.... Breasts are for feeding<br/>
infants.... that&#39;s their primary purpose... It is man that has sexualized<br/>
them into being something to look at and droll over... maybe men never get<br/>
over that mother attachment and look longingly at women to fulfil something<br/>
they are missing or never had...In countries such as New Zealand and<br/>
Austrailia the average amount of time for breastfeeding is the first 3 years<br/>
of life and you have to buy bottles from a Pharmacy as it&#39;s unusual to not<br/>
breastfeed.  I wonder how people look there.<br/>
<br/>
I have also found, having grown up in England, now living in America that<br/>
the Americans are a lot more uptight when it comes to sexual things and also<br/>
to this breast feeding thing.  So I think it must be a cultural thing.<br/>
<br/>
So what do I believe.... every woman needs to do what she is most<br/>
comfortable with regardless of whether other people are comfortable or<br/>
not.with her decisions.  I believe it&#39;s very co-dependent to worry and do<br/>
things differently because other people will be unhappy.  We take away their<br/>
power when we don&#39;t let them say &quot;I&#39;m really uncomfortable with you<br/>
breastfeeding in front of me because I feel (a) guilty because I didn&#39;t do<br/>
it (b) ashamed because we sexualize our bodies in this country (b)<br/>
uncomfortable seeing your breasts as it arouses me (from a man&#39;s point of<br/>
view that is) and any other number of guilt feelings that others have.  Let<br/>
them have the opportunity to have their uncomfortable feelings if you want<br/>
to breast feed in public... Let then deal with their emotions....<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is rambling but I love this topic and have thought long and hard<br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>

I like this. I think that&#39;s a big part of it for me. I don&#39;t tell my<br/>
sister she can&#39;t wear her many facial studs just because it makes me feel<br/>
squeamish to look at them  - it&#39;s her body, and her choice. She&#39;s not<br/>
doing it just to bug me - I think that&#39;s a different situation - and it&#39;s<br/>
not her job to make me feel comfortable, it&#39;s my job. Again, if someone<br/>
really thought women at a LLL conference would be out trying to make<br/>
people uncomfortable, that would be different, but I don&#39;t see that as<br/>
the issue.<br/>
<br/>
What if some of the guests at this hotel are uncomfortable seeing Black<br/>
people? What if a hotel guest is Muslim and prefers that women cover?<br/>
Where do you draw the line? <br/>
<br/>
I nursed my very large 3 yr old at the state prison in Safford, and I&#39;m<br/>
pretty sure that no one noticed. I would have been pissed if someone had<br/>
told me to &quot;be discreet&quot;, though. It would be like having a homeschooling<br/>
conference and reminding the participants that since they would be in a<br/>
large group, they might have to wait in lines for things like restrooms<br/>
and drinking fountains, and they should raise their hands if they have a<br/>
question instead of just shouting it out. Yeah, a few homeschoolers may<br/>
need those reminders, but it&#39;s pretty insulting to the group as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Me:&lt;&lt;There was a time when women were told to &quot;discreetly&quot; cover their<br/>
ankles<br/>
and wrists at all times, too...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra:&quot;So do you think we&#39;re building up to nekkid twats?  <br/>
Is it just the slippery slope?  <br/>
<br/>
(If not, I don&#39;t see real the connection between ankles and boobs.)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re both body parts that only women are, or were, required to cover,<br/>
and covering these parts is sometimes an impediment to normal live<br/>
activities. Twats don&#39;t qualify.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What power? From who?  If it&#39;s my power, you can have it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe...<br/>
(a) I feel guilty because I couldn&#39;t breast feed my child-for what ever<br/>
reason.<br/>
(b) I&#39;m confused about why bodies are sexualized in our society.<br/>
(c ) I&#39;m embarrassed at seeing your breasts because I feel that they are<br/>
part of your private being and not the public being I just unwittingly<br/>
stumbled over. [I have yet to feel aroused seeing a mother breastfeed her<br/>
child. Maybe other men have.]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I get an inner glow  when I see a mother nursing because I know for myself<br/>
that it is such a good and healthy thing for child and mother. I want to<br/>
applaud it and encourage it in anyway I can. From my perspective you should<br/>
do whatever you feel you need to make this happen. Certainly be comfortable<br/>
doing it.  But please be aware that needlessly exposing your breasts is<br/>
going to embarrass me and many of my gender.  And it does make it more<br/>
difficult for me to promote the breast feeding of our children to my fellow<br/>
men.<br/>

Oh, so you&#39;ve noticed it too! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I never realised how uptight this culture is regarding<br/>
any form of sensuality/sexuality until I moved back<br/>
here last year (after being away for 12 years). I<br/>
think California is a little more relaxed than some<br/>
places though.<br/>
I breastfed Tamzin until she was 2 and a half (she<br/>
weaned herself then). We fed in public on many<br/>
occasions without so much as a glance in most<br/>
circumstances. I was as discreet as I could be though,<br/>
for my own sake as much as anyone elses (I&#39;m no<br/>
exhibitionist &lt;g&gt;).<br/>

&lt;&lt; I went looking for some report about the Polynesians and weaning but came<br/>
across a report of how certain tribes find mothers and fathers sexually<br/>
stimulating infants to be perfectly normal and calming for them, where there<br/>
was a strong connection between nursing and sexual stimulation.<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hugcares.org/ph/childhod/chch62dm.htm">http://www.hugcares.org/ph/childhod/chch62dm.htm</a> -- the reseach appears to<br/>
have all done by men and seems chock full of bias but that doesn&#39;t negate<br/>
the practices they observed regardless of what conclusions they drew from<br/>
them.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://webpages.charter.net/jspeyrer/war2.htm">http://webpages.charter.net/jspeyrer/war2.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
German children were also used by parents and servants as sexual objects from <br/>
an early age.367 German doctors often said &quot;nursemaids and other servants <br/>
carry out all sorts of sexual acts on the children entrusted to their care, <br/>
sometimes merely in order to quiet the children, sometimes &#39;for fun.&#39;&quot;368 <br/>
Even Freud said he was seduced by his nurse and by his father,369 and said <br/>
&quot;nursemaids, governesses and domestic servants [were often] guilty of [grave <br/>
sexual] abuses&quot; and that &quot;nurses put crying children to sleep by stroking <br/>
their genitals.&quot;370<br/>
<br/>
So.  Germany 100 years ago, not just Polynesia.<br/>
<br/>
This is getting too gross for me so I&#39;m going to stop reporting it, but the <br/>
reminder that what we&#39;re doing isn&#39;t just one minor step away from American <br/>
business-as-usual and school, but it&#39;s a full flight from a century ago, <br/>
might help.<br/>
