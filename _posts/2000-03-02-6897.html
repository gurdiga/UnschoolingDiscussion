    got married at 18, had eldest at 21, almost 22 :-)&nbsp;and dh is older than

    see is that having children when you&#39;re that young seems to give people even 
    more of an idea that they can tell you what to do with them &lt;g&gt;&nbsp; 
    I know my father was told when he announced that mum and he were engaged

        <div><font size="2">Thanks Joshua, it was clear enough for me :-)&nbsp; 
        You said you had children young, do you mind asking how young?&nbsp; 
        Some folks idea of young are way different to others, I know!!&nbsp; I 
        struggle here as I have always been a mature, serious (earnest?) type 
        although whether that&#39;s me or &#39;schooled (or perhaps bullied) me&#39; I&#39;m not 
        sure, and I agree with the theory that everyone has an age that fits 
        them, once they reach that age they stay for a while until decrepitude 
        takes over.&nbsp; So it&#39;s hard for me to let go and play with my 
        children more, (I used to, though, and do with other folks children, 
        particularly 1yo-ish&#39;s, now I think...why has that stopped I 
        wonder?&nbsp; Probably since I started being asked why at every 
        verse-end...)&nbsp; and I sometimes wonder whether I am the right kind 
        of person to be unschooling or even homeschooling, but the alternative 
        is, for me, so abhorrent that I plod on anyway!!</font></div>

          <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Tracy, you have touched upon a theme in 
          my life as well!&nbsp; How to the work of getting to know yourself and 
          still be a functioning parent - ie. not letting it make you self 
          absorbed! - I have thought about it a LOT, and the only conclusion I 
          have reached is to just do my best...&nbsp;&nbsp; By this I mean to 
          STRIVE for aspects such as being loving, being fair, bening 
          encouraging, being fun, being *UP*, laughing amap, being clear, being 
          consistant, etc... realizing I will never be all of these things all 
          the time!&nbsp; In this way I get to begin to connect with my 
          childishness (laughter, being silly, having fun, playing WITH my kids) 
          at the same time as remaining a (semi) responsable adult by striving 
          for fairness, and authourity.&nbsp; I dont think that things allways 
          come in neat, packages in life... which means somtimes we need to 
          improvise and do the best we can!&nbsp; Sure it would be nice if we 
          had all been raised in such a way as to know ourselves real well 
          etc.&nbsp; But in my life at least, (having children at a young age) I 
          have had to just share my own growth with them.... something I hope 
          they will take with them into their own lives.... the STRIVING chuck 
          limiting patterns/beleifs/attitudes.&nbsp; </font></div>

          well &lt;shrug&gt;&nbsp; </font></div>

I can relate. I had my now 9yo daughter when I was 19. I actually looked <br/>
young for my age (before I had my 2nd child) and people reacted a little <br/>
akwardly when she called me mommy. I guess they thought I had her when I was <br/>
14 or something. I always felt *old* next to my peers but *young* next to the <br/>
parents of her peers. Luckily, no one in my family doubted my ability to <br/>
raise her based on my youth. They saw us doing everything we could to raise <br/>
her well and they saw the results. They offered, and still offer, a lot of <br/>
advice, but rarely criticize. Then again, they don&#39;t yet kow we&#39;re <br/>
unschooling. ;-&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476922096">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i was 36 when i had rene&#39; i&#39;m now 40 .  we were not financially better off, as you said was the most common reason for waiting, in fact neither of us were employed at the time and the only money we had was a little stock my grandparents had given me many years before.  why did i wait?  because i had made some really bad choices in men prior to meeting my husband and really<br/>
couldn&#39;t see being happy in either of those relationships.  i didn&#39;t want children without the hope of happiness, though this was more of an unconscious thought at the time - you know you do things without really knowing why but you know you have to do it.<br/>
<br/>
i am glad i waited on one hand because i&#39;m more patient (which for me was a major huddle:) and i&#39;m more resilient to external pressures.  that is i can draw boundaries and stick to them a bit better and am not so easily made to feel guilty.  but this was my weakness and i&#39;m sure it is not true of younger people in general.  on the other hand i think having kids younger has<br/>
great advantages.   for example in my early 20&#39;s 4 to 5 hours sleep on average punctuated by an &#39;all night&#39; was do-able.  this would not be possible now or should i say i would be impossible now &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
i think child rearing is a more instinctive thing and age has little if anything to do with it.  other than patience i think the only real change in my understands and perspective on parenting is that i&#39;m more articulate.   i read books by holt and pearce in my early 20&#39;s, some 10 to 15 years before have a kid.   i&#39;m not sure why i read these books i just did,  i still<br/>
maintain the beliefs i had then but now i could probable write a reach paper and back up my opinions with the writing of others.<br/>
<br/>
anyway i know what you&#39;re saying my sister- in-law would fit the picture you described.   one of the down sides about waiting (other than the biological clock/gentic thing) is that people don&#39;t really respect you and treat you as if you are not normal or are lacking some &#39;hormone&#39; or emotion or something because you don&#39;t have kids.  so this just leads me to the conclusion<br/>
that people generally like to judge other people.   so just do what makes you happy because if someone wants to pick on you they&#39;ll surely find something:)<br/>
<br/>

austin,tx<br/>
ps  i had always looked a good 10 years younger than i was - when i was in my mid 20&#39;s people thought i was 13 or 14 and i was never taken seriously at all.  so i can really empathize with what you are saying.  it is because of this that i take my son very serious, even if he&#39;s talking about some cartoon.  because we, as a society, ignore and trivialize the thoughts of those<br/>
younger than us and this is a great lost because wisdom is wisdom no matter how small or young the person speaking it is.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; LOL, still being in my twentys, I have to make a comment here!  It the same<br/>
&gt; thing occured to me the other day- that I DO NOT function very well as a<br/>
&gt; parent on anything under 6 good hours of sleep, and prefer 7-8.  I remember<br/>
&gt; a time even after I had kids but was not the primary support person that I<br/>
&gt; could get by fine on missing the odd night entirely (working night shift)<br/>
&gt; without suffering too much.  NOW.... it is so PAINFUL to go through a day at<br/>
&gt; home not feeling rested.  It just leads me to the conclusion that at least<br/>
&gt; in part the difference has less to do with age, and more to do with the<br/>
&gt; unkannily high level of energy output it requires to be the main care-giver<br/>
&gt; for your children at the same time as keeping the house under control, doing<br/>
&gt; laundry, cooking, shopping etc etc.  It is not the kind of thing where I can<br/>
&gt; just &quot;drift&quot; through the day without trying as I have been able to do at<br/>
&gt; many of my prevous jobs on days when I was lacking sleep.<br/>
&gt; Any other of the younger parents agree?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL! Hey! Nothing wrong with being an &quot;older&quot; mother either you know! I<br/>
think as long as you are a good mother, and are happy being a mother, it<br/>
shouldn&#39;t matter how old (or not old) you are. There are bad mothers of<br/>
all ages. I would never judge someone as a mother simply because of<br/>
their age. <br/>
<br/>
Personally tho, I am glad I waited. I&#39;m not that much &quot;older&quot;, but I was<br/>
29 when I had my baby (my first so far). No, I was not more intelligent,<br/>
or more experienced with children (tho I was better off financially) but<br/>
most important *for me* is that I was more sure of myself and more<br/>
patient then I was in my early 20&#39;s or teens. I would have made an<br/>
awful, awful mother in my teens. But that is ME and no one else. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just standing up for us old fogies :-) My friends are actually a<br/>
mixed bag. I have some who waited, some who wanted kids early but had<br/>
problems and finally had them in their 30&#39;s and some who had them young.<br/>
And some of them are better mother&#39;s than others, but I can honestly say<br/>
it seems to have nothing to do with age. <br/>

<br/>
LOL, still being in my twentys, I have to make a comment here!  It the same<br/>
thing occured to me the other day- that I DO NOT function very well as a<br/>
parent on anything under 6 good hours of sleep, and prefer 7-8.  I remember<br/>
a time even after I had kids but was not the primary support person that I<br/>
could get by fine on missing the odd night entirely (working night shift)<br/>
without suffering too much.  NOW.... it is so PAINFUL to go through a day at<br/>
home not feeling rested.  It just leads me to the conclusion that at least<br/>
in part the difference has less to do with age, and more to do with the<br/>
unkannily high level of energy output it requires to be the main care-giver<br/>
for your children at the same time as keeping the house under control, doing<br/>
laundry, cooking, shopping etc etc.  It is not the kind of thing where I can<br/>
just &quot;drift&quot; through the day without trying as I have been able to do at<br/>
many of my prevous jobs on days when I was lacking sleep.<br/>
Any other of the younger parents agree?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-225737559">Hi Joshua,<br/>
<br/>
Just a quick note - i had my first child at 25 which was considered young by<br/>
my immediate family and friends and just recently had my last baby at 33.<br/>
<br/>
I actually think I was a much more conscientious mother with my first child.<br/>
The house had to be just-so, baby always clean and dressed prettily, me with<br/>
make-up on by 9am etc because I lacked any confidence at all. Therefore I<br/>
tried extra hard to &quot;do it right&quot; For me this led to postnatal depression<br/>
which was unrecognised for years as I continued to &quot;function&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now with my four children at home all day, i am blissed-out of my mind and<br/>
very, very relaxed about housework and the girls having matching socks and<br/>
panties etc!! (In fact if they actually get totally dressed I am pretty darn<br/>
happy!) So I have definitely &quot;enjoyed&quot; the two babies I had in my thirties<br/>
so much more than the two I had in my twenties.<br/>
<br/>
I realise that there are many factors at work here but still I think the<br/>
&quot;best&quot;  younger mothers I know work incredibly hard and deserve incredible<br/>
appreciation for doing the best they can with the hardes (and potentially)<br/>
most rewarding job in the world!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
    And I have kind of the opposite.  My mom had me when she was 17.  Because <br/>
she started in on the sex ed lectures when I was 12 and had 2 more children <br/>
while I was a teenager, I wanted nothing to do with children for a long time. <br/>
 I had my first pretty much right by the biological clock with my friends - <br/>
29 - but then all those friends I thought I&#39;d be raising my children with <br/>
went the daycare route and have very different attitudes about almost <br/>
everything regarding children.  So, here I am.  <br/>
    But my mom did a great job, and I remember loving that she would play tag <br/>
with me and stuff when the other mothers wouldn&#39;t.  And getting to go to <br/>
college with her sometimes and color in the corner.  And bragging to friends <br/>
in 6th grade that I could still trust MY mom cause she wasn&#39;t 30 yet.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not addressing you directly, Karen, but addressing this idea. I&#39;ve<br/>
seen many people say how great it is to be (or have) a younger mom<br/>
because you&#39;re &quot;willing&quot; to play with the kids and I have to speak up on<br/>
this. It&#39;s attitude not age! Yes, there are many older moms who do not<br/>
like to play tag, color, etc with their kids, but I bet it&#39;s not their<br/>
age, it&#39;s them. My mom had me at 21, and she certainly didn&#39;t ever play<br/>
tag (or much of anything else) with us. I had mine at 29 and while she<br/>
is not yet old enuf to play tag per se, I already chase her around the<br/>
house and roll around on the floor with her. <br/>
<br/>
Ok, true, my knees are not what they used to be, but IMO it&#39;s worth the<br/>
pain to give her a happy childhood. I&#39;m constantly kneeling down to be<br/>
at her level all day long, ignoring the creaking in my knees (and by the<br/>
way, they started to give out in my early 20&#39;s, so having a child<br/>
younger would not have made much of a difference). <br/>
<br/>
I also often hear people talk about &quot;first time moms&quot; (of any age) and<br/>
how they don&#39;t know anything and are too uptight. I always stand up for<br/>
myself when I hear that because I think I&#39;m pretty laid back. Maybe it&#39;s<br/>
because I&#39;m of an unschooling mindset, but I let Bridget do all sorts of<br/>
things. Last night I lay a blanket on the kitchen floor, put down a pot,<br/>
and let her splash water all over (the blanket was to soak up the water<br/>
so she wouldn&#39;t slip). When you give dd something in a cup, she likes to<br/>
drink some and then pour the rest on the floor. Dh says I should just<br/>
give her sippy cups (with the lids). Why? It&#39;s easy enuf to clean up,<br/>
the carpet is old anyway, and this way she is learning, exploring,<br/>
playing and having fun :-)<br/>
<br/>
My whole point is, people are who they are for many different reasons.<br/>
You can&#39;t make sweeping generalizations based on age (or how long you&#39;ve<br/>
been parenting). Yes, some of us are more confident and patient because<br/>
we&#39;re older, but some were already confident and patient when they were<br/>
young. Some moms will play with their kids no matter what their age, and<br/>
some won&#39;t, no matter how young they are. Some people loosen up as the<br/>
parenting years go by, some are pretty laid back from day one. <br/>
<br/>
So anyway, that&#39;s MO :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079363425">I second that, Shannon!!!! All mothers and children are important and <br/>
special no matter what their age!  Perhaps the people who make comments or <br/>
give you strange looks are not people that one should be concerned about <br/>
what they think?  Perhaps they would be lousy parents?  Or are?  Don&#39;t judge <br/>
another until you have walked a mile in their shoes I say!!! I agree that I <br/>
have had more patience and money than I did when I was younger, but there <br/>
have been nights when I have fell into bed so exhausted and thought, &quot;If <br/>
only I had had children at a younger age, I would have had more energy for <br/>
them!&quot;  There are pros and cons both ways.  I also hear the time clock <br/>
ticking for more children where as it would have been different if I had <br/>
begun at a younger age.  It&#39;s a toss up!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095720164">Truer words were never spoken and I have been staying out of the discussion<br/>
because it is soooo age biased!  It is simple, some folks are born old and<br/>
boring and tired.  Some folks never grow up and there are a whole variety<br/>
inbetween!  Nobody parents all their kids the same.  No two 20 year old, no<br/>
two 30 year olds and no two 40 year olds parent the same and they won&#39;t<br/>
parent the 2nd, 3rd or umpteenth kid the same as the first one.  Some folks<br/>
are watchers, some are doers.<br/>
<br/>
I &quot;acquired&quot; 5 kids when I was 19.  Instant parenthood because my sil was<br/>
hospitalized.  It was also instant intro to unschooling because the kids<br/>
were on overload and I figured they had enough on their plates without<br/>
school.  Of course, I didn&#39;t have a clue that what we were doing was<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My first kidlet was born when I was 22, last one when I was 36.  Each was<br/>
different and the parenting combined their individuality with my<br/>
personality.  Age never had anything to do with it.  I&#39;m OAD now and the<br/>
kidlets and I are still doing lots of things together including lifting<br/>
weights, roller blading and bicycling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I SO agree, and I take children&#39;s concerns very seriously for the same reasons of being ignored and disrespected as a child, which is so baseless and unfair.  Children have so much to give, and they give it freely and without thought of any payment other than your attention and kindness and recognition.  We are the ignorant ones if we ignore them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301522749">My parents didn&#39;t adopt me until my mom was 30 and my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;dad was 47. 30 years ago this was almost unheard of. All of my friends were<br/>
&gt;products of parents that had had them in their early 20&#39;s if not sooner. I<br/>
&gt;always felt out of place. I then went on to marry @ 22 and have my babies @<br/>
&gt;23, 26, & 28. Now  I feel out of place for being a young mom. I guess when<br/>
&gt;it comes to society, you can&#39;t win for loosin&#39;.<br/>
&gt;Amy Worthen<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can relate so well to this Amy.  When my parents married, they were both divorced and blending their families.  They did not have my brother and I (their last) until they were in their late 30&#39;s (Mom) and mid 40&#39;s (Dad.)  I often wonder why they bothered (yes we were intentional) as I know now that we were an annoyance and a burden to them.  I think they only had us as trophy children, to cement their marriage for themselves and others (espeically the ex&#39;s.)<br/>
<br/>
My elder siblings had children later (mid 30&#39;s) and I went on to get married at 22 and have my children at 23 and 24.  They don&#39;t talk to me much, but from the comments I got from them early on I know they don&#39;t approve.  My brother (the closest in age to me) married 3 weeks after I did and has two girls VERY close in age to my two boys.  He is the one that I am still the closest to, despite two states in between us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165015047"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I have NEVER been able to function well on little sleep.  Now that I am a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>full time mom I need even more than ever, even though I am still several<br/>
years till thirty.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ME NEITHER!!  And thankfully I have a four year old that still naps.  My<br/>
entire 31yrs, I have required A LOT of sleep, if I don&#39;t get it, I am hell<br/>
on wheels.  I am cranky, crotchety, the whole nine yards.  Thankfully, as I<br/>
have gotten older, If I do not get enough, I can not get some, then catch up<br/>
later.  Fortunately, my beloved is a early bird, and I get to sleep in on<br/>
weekends and even take NAPS.<br/>
<br/>
When Dana was teeney, I have no idea how I worked full time, nursed and and<br/>
did what I had to do.  My dear hubby worked SEVEN days a week then(7pm til<br/>
8am - for 16 months) so that DanaBeth would not have to go to daycare(I had<br/>
to work cause I had the health insurance).  God love the little kid, she go<br/>
to bed with me at ten -- I would bring her in bed with me, starting at<br/>
7weeks when I returned to work, put her in the crook of my arm, turn off the<br/>
light and tell her it was sleepy-ni-night-time and she would rest her little<br/>
fingers on my face and fall fast asleep till we had to start our day at 6ish<br/>
am.  We would get up, I would feed her (she wasn&#39;t nursing then - I pumped<br/>
twice a day - I think I set Guinness records for breastmilk production), go<br/>
to sleep, my Daddy would drive 45 min so she wouldn&#39;t have to go to daycare,<br/>
and watch her for 2 hours till Joey got home,  Joey would feed her, she<br/>
would sleep for 2 hours, awake for 2, sleep 2, so on.  I have no idea how we<br/>
made it through that year plus.  Long story short, I think we(my family) are<br/>
making up for lost time with our sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening, the trip down memory lane was touching for me.  How<br/>
easily we forget how time quickly passes.  I think I will go snuggle with my<br/>
girl, her hands are getting so big.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
