<div id="ygrps-yiv-530334805"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So do you live in Germany, Brenda? And if so, how do you homeschool? Unless<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re military, I know it&#39;s illegal. My db and sil live there and send the<br/>
&gt; kids to Catholic school, but they might hs if it were legal.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re military.  Someone recently told me, however, that the laws are<br/>
starting to be challenged.  Wouldn&#39;t know, since my reading skills aren&#39;t up<br/>
to German language news.<br/>
<br/>
Twelfth Night would be the start of the church liturgical season of<br/>
Epiphany, which is the one that immediately precedes Lent.  The day before<br/>
Lent begins, Ash Wednesday, is the day of Carnival (Fasching, Mardi Gras,<br/>
Shrove Tuesday, whatever you call it).  However, some folks, like thems in<br/>
New Orleans &lt;g&gt;, like to get an early start on their partying, and begin as<br/>
soon as the appropriate season begins.  So actually both answers are<br/>
correct, although in the Shakespearean sense, I belive that we&#39;re talking<br/>
about Twelfth Night as Epiphany, or the Feast of the Three Kings, rather<br/>
than a jump on party season!<br/>
