<div id="ygrps-yiv-334315828">Anyway.......<br/>
<br/>
I have a question for all of you wonderful moms out there!!!<br/>
I know this has nothing to do with &#39;unschooling&#39; per say but it does<br/>
have to do with the process of getting those cute little bundles of joy<br/>
to unschool!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering if anyone knew anything about stretch marks<br/>
itching!  :-)  I know it sounds funny but for the past few weeks mine<br/>
have, tremendously!!!  I was wondering if it had to do with the amount<br/>
of stretching I had to do with my last.  I was absolutely huge when I<br/>
had her.  She weighed 9lbs10-1/2oz when she was born. :-@<br/>
I don&#39;t remember itching so bad with my others.<br/>
<br/>
Is this something I should contact my dr. about or is it normal?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any info!<br/>

Faith, <br/>
    Yes!!! I know what you mean, my stretch marks itched terribly also! I do <br/>
remember the doctor told me NOT to scratch them, as it would make the tearing <br/>
worse... Try some Vitamin E on your tummy. Blessings, Lori in TX</div>
