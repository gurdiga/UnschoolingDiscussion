My daughter is 12yrs old and we have only been H/sing for 6 months.  <br/>
When we are actually studying - Which isnt often these days! - I find <br/>
the one on one really good.  But from the social side, yes she does <br/>
get lonely.  Luckily she has a friend who lives across the road.  <br/>
However this friend is busy with home work and after school <br/>
activities so they cant always hang around together. Toni is getting <br/>
better at occupying herself these days - but still likes company.<br/>
Toni does have older brothers and sisters - but they have all left <br/>
home.<br/>
