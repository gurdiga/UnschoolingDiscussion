&gt; always recommends to parents when they come into the bookstore <br/>
&gt; looking for books their kids might enjoy.<br/>

mentions them in his books) and then PBS showed the WONDERFUL movie of &quot;The <br/>
Railway Children&quot; -- it was lovely.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter was in school until 4th grade. Yet ANOTHER reason I <br/>
started giving up on school was that her teacher couldn&#39;t get permission to <br/>
have &quot;Half Magic&quot; be used in their supposedly &quot;Literature-Based Mathematics&quot; <br/>
program. Half-Magic was not on the approved literature list for the State of <br/>
California -- so she applied to have it added and it was turned down. The <br/>
only explanation was that it was &quot;too old and outdated.&quot; She and I were both <br/>
disgusted -- what kind of reason is THAT? Are they going to use that reason <br/>
for eliminating all the great literature of the past? Yeah, right.<br/>
