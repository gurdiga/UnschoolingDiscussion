<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560005615">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
My 6 1/2 year son in fascinated by everything Egyption.  He&#39;s comparing<br/>
their written language and ours.  It&#39;s all very interesting for a<br/>
pre-reader.  He&#39;s also been making a Rosetta stone writing Japenese,<br/>
Korean and Egyption characters in a tray filled with plaster.  I think<br/>
it&#39;s really neat that he can go this route with his learning, couldn&#39;t<br/>
do this in first grade in public school!<br/>
<br/>
Also thanks for the buy nothing ideas, it helps me appreciate more the<br/>
blouses, skirts, vest, slippers and bags that I&#39;m sewing!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

**Sherry, This sounds great! Dover books has tons of affordable stuff about<br/>
foreign cultures. You might want to request a catalog. (they only send them<br/>
if you ask) Oh fine. Now I can&#39;t find the info...I&#39;ll see if I can dig it up<br/>
later.<br/>
