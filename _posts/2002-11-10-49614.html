I have younger kids  9, 8 and 5,  so I havn&#39;t started to think about college yet,  but I know that-- The Teenage Liberation Handbook by Grace Llewellyn,  would probably be helpful.  I know our library system had it.   I read it and it has tons of great ideas,  Ms. Llewellyn has a great perspective on things.<br/>
 <br/>
So many colleges now are very open to homeschoolers,   also there is a topic in unschooling.com message boards on teens and unschooling that might be helpful.<br/>
 <br/>
Take Care, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-13294693">The unschoolers that I am familiar with in my area have all started with <br/>
dual enrollment at the age of 16. Our local community college is very <br/>
receptive with this and the homeschoolers. Depending on the class, some kids <br/>
have to take a test to let the college know they can handle what they are <br/>
taking. Generally, after 2 years of community college, other colleges are no <br/>
problem. The most I&#39;ve heard the unschoolers having to do was take the <br/>
SAT&#39;s.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-797644216">Thank you both for your quick answers. I will check out the <br/>
requirements here for the community college as well as the books and <br/>
board suggested. Hopefully there will be something specific for oregon<br/>

see from a homeschooler who applied.  If you&#39;re expecting that your kids<br/>
will want to attend a college near home.  Grace Llewellyn is in Oregon,<br/>
isn&#39;t she?<br/>
