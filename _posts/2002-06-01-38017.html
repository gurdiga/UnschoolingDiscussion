<div id="ygrps-yiv-431303037"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Roly-poly bugs or Pill bugs (the ones that live in basements, under porches<br/>
&gt;&gt; or any cool damp place. They roll up if touched.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve got boring ones here in Mass. The ones back in PA did that but the<br/>
&gt; ones here are underacheivers. They just curve a bit. Maybe I should bring<br/>
&gt; some real ones back with me next time I visit Pittsburgh to show them how<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s supposed to be done!<br/>
<br/>

maybe they&#39;re unschooled roly-poly bugs and have found a way to protect<br/>
themselves based on their own experiments.  Maybe the PA bugs have all been<br/>
&quot;shown&quot; how to properly roll all their lives and haven&#39;t ever had the chance<br/>
to try it their own way!<br/>

who needs to get a real life or something.....<br/>

sorry, Joyce,<br/>
I just could not resist, and it appears that you have the sense of humor to<br/>
handle this!</div>
