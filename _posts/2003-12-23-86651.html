&gt; life, but I think being able to ascertain which commitments are truly <br/>

&gt; does not make the Truly Important list, IMO.  It&#39;s only a game.  <br/>

under- emphasized in our culture isn&#39;t Truly Important either, is it? <br/>
<br/>
       Video and fantasy gaming are &quot;only a game&quot; too but individual kids <br/>
often deem such games Truly Important, with no parent coaching or modeling or <br/>
admonishing or reminding to stick with it for their own good. (I hope adults <br/>
aren&#39;t taking over this realm as they have so many kids&#39; sports?)<br/>
<br/>
       The most painful unschooling mistake I made wasn&#39;t with sports or <br/>
games, but with piano and violin lessons. Sigh. All with the very best intentions <br/>
and only because our dd was genuinely interested. <br/>
<br/>
       In this one area of our unschooling lives, I thought somewhat like <br/>
Lillian sounds, with my circular justification that if dd liked it and wanted it, <br/>
my job was to back up the organization we&#39;d found to deliver it to her, and <br/>
to make sure she got what she wanted in full measure even in spite of herself! &lt;<br/>
rueful grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       So I now tend to see organized sports versus outdoor play the way I <br/>
see music lessons with required practice versus rock guitar or drums in the <br/>
garage or bedroom  when we were growing up -- <br/>
<br/>
       Or sleeping late after reading in bed under the covers versus missing <br/>
the schoolbus after staying up late to get the homework finished?<br/>
           <br/>
       I suggest that what truly matters isn&#39;t how much emphasis the activity <br/>
gets but who decides the emphasis, in other words whether such activity is <br/>
&quot;adult controlled&quot; or honestly belongs to the kids.   JJ<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-114067329">I made a mistake when my daughter was into Chinese a few years ago.  <br/>
She really wanted to learn how to speak Chinese and she wanted to <br/>
sign up for a children&#39;s Chinese class at a local college.  She <br/>
enjoyed it even though it was schooly.  But I was worried that she <br/>
wasn&#39;t interested in studying for it and worried that she wouldn&#39;t do <br/>
well on the quizzes.  So I &quot;strongly encouraged&quot; (as in I made up <br/>
flash cards and practically made her sit and study with me).  If she <br/>
could have just gone and listened to the lessons but then not worried <br/>
about &quot;studying&quot; that would have been cool.  Then she could have just <br/>
hung out with her Chinese speaking friends and she probably would <br/>
have really enjoyed it and maybe would have stuck with it.  But <br/>
I &quot;encouraged&quot; her interest in Chinese by &quot;studying&quot; with her and now <br/>
she isn&#39;t interested anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
She played soccer for several years.  Last year for whatever reason <br/>
she really started disliking it. I think she was never really <br/>
passionate about it but tolerated it ok. Before I was really into <br/>
unschooling, I thought she needed a physical activity to make her <br/>
activities &quot;well rounded&quot; so I said, &quot;Let&#39;s sign up for soccer!&quot;  The <br/>
longer we were unschooling the more she really started knowing who <br/>
she is and knowing what she did and didn&#39;t want to do.  I think she <br/>
just finally realized, &quot;This isn&#39;t me&quot; and started resisting it. (And <br/>
I consider that to have been a healthy response and I&#39;m glad she got <br/>
to that point where she knows Who She Is!)    She never wanted to go <br/>
to practices and games.  I started &quot;making&quot; her go because of her <br/>
commitment to the team, telling her she didn&#39;t need to sign up again <br/>
but it wouldn&#39;t be nice to leave the team short on players.  It got <br/>
very unpleasant for her and for the whole family. Who wants to drive <br/>
30 minutes to cheer on a player who doesn&#39;t want to be playing?  It <br/>
started to become SO terrible getting her to go to those games that I <br/>
just let her quit.  There weren&#39;t waiting lists for her team and she <br/>
probably left the team short on players (but still able to play if <br/>
not too many kids got sick at once).  <br/>
<br/>
My son asked me to sign him up for soccer.  He said he wanted to, he <br/>
knew what was involved, we bought him a uniform.  He was 5 1/2.  He <br/>
hadn&#39;t realized how hard it would be for him to go out on the field <br/>
without me.  So I started going out on the field and practicing <br/>
soccer with him, but it started to get to the point where he wanted <br/>
to go off to the other side of the field, away from the other kids by <br/>
ourselves.  I kept trying to gravitate us to at least be playing in <br/>
the general area of the rest of the kids on the team.  He hated <br/>
that.  I ended up letting him quit before they even had their first <br/>
game because at the last practice we went to I couldn&#39;t even get him <br/>
to get out of the car.  I would have had to literally drag him to the <br/>
field, and what good would that have done?  <br/>
<br/>
My youngest son (who&#39;s 4 1/2 now) has recently been expressing an <br/>
interest in signing up for soccer.  I told him he could when he turns <br/>
5 (our league&#39;s minimum age) and talked to him about it awhile.  I <br/>
told him it would be so fun for us to bring our lawn chairs and sit <br/>
on the sidelines and watch him play.  He said, &quot;No, I want you to <br/>
sign up with me mommy&quot;.  I said that I could sign up to be a team <br/>
parent or an assistant coach and come to all his practices and games, <br/>
but that&#39;s not what he wanted.   He wanted me to have a uniform too <br/>
and play right alongside him.  Like a mother-son soccer team!  In the <br/>
end, he told me that he wouldn&#39;t sign up unless I&#39;d sign up with <br/>
him.  :)  We do everything else together, he doesn&#39;t understand that <br/>
there are some activities where moms can&#39;t &quot;sign up&quot; right along with <br/>
their kids.  <br/>
