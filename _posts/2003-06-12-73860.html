not any more!!  the old reputation doesn&#39;t apply anymore;  they&#39;ve gone <br/>
fashionable trying to capture other markets besides old hippies and people <br/>
with bad feet...<br/>
<br/>
check out styles here:   www.Birkenstock-cn.com  .   specials, bargains and <br/>
closeouts here, too.<br/>
<br/>
for even better prices, look for them on ebay;  lots of new but obsolete <br/>
(past seasons) styles, plus sometimes gently used ones.  best to find them <br/>
locally to try on to figure out your sizing, then buy online.<br/>
