from it need more natural light in the winter.&nbsp; Do Aubrey&#39;s &quot;cycles&quot; seem

 </span></blockquote>Seasonal Affective Disorder.  Mimicking depression, I think, not bipolar so<br/>
much: patients will be depressed in the winter, but probably not manic in the<br/>
summer.  Light boxes are &#39;standard&#39; treatment, although the first URL I looked<br/>
at claimed (in 1994) that it hadn&#39;t been clearly distinguished from the<br/>
placebo effect.<br/>
