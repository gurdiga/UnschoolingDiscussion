<div id="ygrps-yiv-753934669">Hi all, Sessuale here :)<br/>
I am planning to go to India soon and was wondering if anyone else has been there and if so would you mind maybe giving me a heads up, tell me what your experience was like so I can prepare myself and our little one.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Sessualej</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307891719">I can help with that one!  I have a second home in the far south of<br/>
India, north of Madurai, an adopted daughter from Bombay, and friends<br/>
all over the place (and my adopted parents too -- I adopted them.)  I<br/>
also spoke to an incipient homeschooling group in Gujarat, India, last<br/>
September.  So if you e-mail me what you want to know (privately?  will<br/>
the list want to hear all of this?), I&#39;ll do what I can.<br/>
