&gt; &lt;&lt; I went to the<br/>
&gt;  doctor last week with many many symptoms and he told me it was probably just<br/>
&gt;  mild fibromylgia (would hate to see severe) but ran some test anyway.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; Heather,  if you have a group of symptoms, it sounds like Chronic Fatigue<br/>
&gt; Syndrome, with fibromyalgia going with it.  My sister has this, and it is<br/>
&gt; very close to MS and I believe that my sister says that only way they can dx<br/>
&gt; MS is with a brain scan.  At any rate, if you want to email me privately, I<br/>
&gt; can get you in touch with her regarding her symptoms.<br/>
&gt; Teresa<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>MS is very often dx without an MRI. An MRI can only find lesions 2 mm<br/>
wide. MS lesions found in autopsies can be microscopic.<br/>
<br/>
Lesions on an MRI are ONLY an indicator of the presence of the lesions<br/>
themselves not of MS. There are many reasons lesions could appear such<br/>
as head trauma.<br/>
By tracking over time  MRIs indicating increases of lesions or an<br/>
enlargement of a lesion can be indicitive of MS.<br/>
MS is most often diagnosed using a combination of nerological tests and<br/>
tracking symptoms. <br/>
Major indicators such as positive spinal tap,  positive evoked<br/>
potentials,  Optical Neuritis and unexplained disrubances in<br/>
nuerological related sensations (patches of burning skin where nobody<br/>
can feel any heat on your skin, the sensation of ants crawling all over<br/>
a part of you etc.) are typically used to diagnosed when there are an<br/>
absence of visible lesions in an MRI.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Only an autopsy can tell for sure if you have MS.<br/>
And it is not unusual for a person with one auto immune disorder to<br/>
develop one or two more....OH JOY :-(<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Teresa, I didn&#39;t mean to offend you and I hope I didn&#39;t. I&#39;ve heard<br/>
accounts of the same balderdash being spewed from neurologists to their<br/>
patients, from many many MS sufferers on the support newsgroups<br/>
<br/>
The problem with most neurologists is that MS is not their<br/>
specialty.Very few Neuros are up to date on MS.....there is no money to<br/>
be made treating an MS patient.Drug companies put little effort into<br/>
cure research because there is toooo much money to be made on treatment<br/>
drugs.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty much a health *maintenance* diseases like CFS or Arthritis.<br/>
<br/>
Many Neuros tell this myth about MRIs to patients to shut them up. You<br/>
wouldn&#39;t believe how many patients are labled *all in the head* because<br/>
a Neuro won&#39;t consider MS until lesions appear in multiples in an MRI.<br/>
Did your sister see her MRI? If she didn&#39;t she should and get the<br/>
previous ones and have them compared by another Neuro.<br/>
We&#39;ve had many, many people on the MS support newsgroup take their<br/>
*films* of their MRIs and run to another Neuro for a second opinion to<br/>
find out that the First Neuros opinion was  completely wrong.<br/>
<br/>
My first neuro told me everything was all right. Nothing showed on the<br/>
MRI so it couldn&#39;t be MS.<br/>
I asked for a second opinion after 2 yrs of grief from this guy. The<br/>
second opinion  fellow said the neurological tests and the problems with<br/>
my eye post Optic Neuritis were more than enough tohave diagnosed MS two<br/>
yrs previous to my visit to him. <br/>
He sent me to a specialist at the MS clinic here in town at the McMaster<br/>
University Medical Centre who thought the same as the second Neuro and<br/>
was pleased to say I had no lesions but he truly felt I had MS and told<br/>
me to my face that I have MS.<br/>
He was convinced enough to give me a Rx for a drug to help with<br/>
fatigue....a drug that only works on fatigue in MS patients....it works<br/>
for me so there is another chalk mark to say MS (unfortunately)<br/>
<br/>
When two out of three Neuros say you have it and one is a well known<br/>
specialist....then you have it even without the MRI&#39;s say so.<br/>
If this Neuro of hers doesn&#39;t believe in CFS she should get another<br/>
opinion. CFS has been considered a true and real disease for 10 yrs now.<br/>
<br/>
Is your sister on line? There should be a support newsgroup for CFS.<br/>
These support newsgroups are a great place to get info and support,<br/>
neuro recommendations for your area etc. and you don&#39;t have to be<br/>
diagnosed to participate only interested in the disease.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve found my alt.support.mult-sclerosis newsgroup a real help, with<br/>
great people willing to offer support and suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
I hope your sister&#39;s life gets easier.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>hi,<br/>
<br/>
i agree about the support.  i was on list a list for still&#39;s disease and everyone<br/>
was really nice but most people didn&#39;t have kids and those who did didn&#39;t hs (or<br/>
if they did they kept it to themselves)  so its nice to have more then one thing<br/>
in common but more importantly its nice to speak about being chronically ill in<br/>
the context of the great joy and choice ( since being ill is not:) of<br/>
unschooling.  i like this context &lt;g&gt; and really appreciate the patience of those<br/>
who are fortunate not to have this in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>

&gt;  The problem with most neurologists is that MS is not their<br/>
&gt;  specialty.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I phrased that rather awkwardly.....very few Neurologists have<br/>
MS as a specialty.<br/>
<br/>
[snip]  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I found this to be very curious.  When I first became ill in 1993, I was very<br/>
&gt; weak and had trouble even washing off the kitchen table.  After weeks of<br/>
&gt; feeling this ill, I went to see my family doctor.  He thought that I had a<br/>
&gt; bone spur in my shoulder so he sent me to a neurosurgeon.  The neurosurgeon<br/>
&gt; did and MRI and then told me that I had MS.  He pointed out &quot;plaques&quot; on the<br/>
&gt; MRI and said that I would have to go see a neurologist, since his specialty<br/>
&gt; was surgery.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The plaques should be investigated but you can&#39;t tell from a single MRI<br/>
if there is a progression in number or size of plaque(s). This is why it<br/>
can take yrs to get dx. It has to be tracked over a few yrs to see a<br/>
pattern of attacks and an increase or enlargement of plaque(s).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well, it took weeks to get my appointment, and by the time I<br/>
&gt; did, I was feeling almost back to normal (except for the numbness and<br/>
&gt; tingling in my arms).  The neurologist refused to take the neurosurgeons word<br/>
&gt; for it and said that I had diagnosed myself!  He said that he could see<br/>
&gt; nothing wrong with me and that I was healthy as a horse.  He did say that my<br/>
&gt; blood pressure was extremely, extremely low (which probably, according to<br/>
&gt; him, cause the dizziness, weakness and other symptoms) so he said I should go<br/>
&gt; home and start eating alot of salt!   Well, I have tried (since new symptoms<br/>
&gt; have come and gone in the last few years---vision, problems with my legs,<br/>
&gt; pain and many others that I would really rather not go into) to see other<br/>
&gt; neurologists.  They always refuse to do any more MRIs or any other tests, and<br/>
&gt; instead hinted that all of this is in my head.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately this is typical.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;However, with all the pain I<br/>
&gt; had (and some other symptoms that cannot be faked), I knew this wasn&#39;t so.<br/>
&gt; Finally a reumatologist said that since my killer T-cells were extremely low<br/>
&gt; and I had all the &quot;pain points&quot; that he thought I had CFIDS and Fibromyalgia.<br/>
&gt;  That has become my &quot;official&quot; diagnosis, even though a couple of my symptoms<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t match the criteria---and basically has my doctor very concerned.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Could you get a referral to an MS specialist from the Rheumatologist?<br/>
this may hold more weight than one from a GP.<br/>
At least you may be able to rule out MS. Have your eyes been checked by<br/>
an Opthamologist? They can tell if you&#39;ve had episodes of Optic Neuritis<br/>
which is difficult for even a neurologist to see.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway, I have tried everything on my own, change in diet, natural medicine<br/>
&gt; and herbs, but nothing has helped.  Your info on the MRIs has been the first<br/>
&gt; I heard.  I have been told that my first MRI was &quot;nonconclusive&quot; (they said<br/>
&gt; that they could see &quot;something&quot; but weren&#39;t convinced that is was plaques like the neurosurgeon said) and that they could see no reason for another MRI, even though it has been a few years. They also said that since I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have a conslusive MRI that I didn&#39;t have MS and there was no need to be<br/>
&gt; retested.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh what crap...if they don&#39;t track and the neurosurgeon saw plaques who<br/>
are they kidding? Plaques are obvious with today&#39;s MRI machines. The<br/>
plaques that do show up are considered large because they are 2 mm or<br/>
larger to have shown up in the first place.<br/>
I will tell you this though ... the majority of auto immune disorder<br/>
patients I&#39;ve had personal contact with have had to fight like hell to<br/>
be treated decently and honestly.<br/>
An informed patient has to tread carefully so as not to bruise doctors&#39;<br/>
egos and get the treatment they deserve!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Therefore, I grasped at the diagnosis of CFIDS and<br/>
&gt; fibromyalgia----at least then I have a diagnosis!!-----and I have quit going<br/>
&gt; to doctors for a diagnosis.  Now the only doctor that I see is my family<br/>
&gt; doctor---who I like very much-----and he treats me for the pain and other<br/>
&gt; symtoms.  I figure that if it is something like MS, I will have to wait until<br/>
&gt; it is so obvious that it hits them over the head!  In the meantime, I will<br/>
&gt; just try to help myself as much as possible!<br/>
&gt; Tammy<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>MS isn&#39;t a life threatening disease just a pain in the a** disease.<br/>
It&#39;s something one can live with if one has too. Very few MS patients<br/>
are non ambulatory.....80% walk into their doctors for their regular<br/>
appts and of the 20% that don&#39;t, the majority of them only have to use a<br/>
wheel chair occasionally and just have to use crutches or a cane for the<br/>
most part.<br/>
