<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120632529"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;Matthew made a good point,though, that there are younger kids <br/>
 </span></blockquote>without families or in bad family situations who would benefit from <br/>
something like this. But wouldn&#39;t that be basically a foster program <br/>
then?<br/>

***Now there&#39;s a really great idea, and the state might pay that low <br/>
tuition for fulltime coverage.  I don&#39;t know what they pay ... but as <br/>
Sandra aptly pointed out, not all of us who care about kids are in <br/>
the kind of situation to take in more happily.  I&#39;d rather, at this <br/>
point, help sponsor a disadvantaged child in an unschooling-type-<br/>
school/home (is that what we are talking about here?)<br/>

***************************************************************<br/>
There are parents trying to just legally homeschool foster kids let alone <br/>
trying to pass unschooling and a boarding situation off to them. The school would <br/>
need to be approved by DHS and the parents of the children would need to <br/>
approve also if they were still involved.  <br/>
I would think that Matt would or may already have a list of interested <br/>
families without waiting a year or more for all the DHS red tape. Then add to it the <br/>
want to be there by the child. If its forced in any way we are no longer <br/>
looking at an unschooling situation. <br/>
