<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042519209">I saw a link somewhere recently--maybe here? for weirdrichard.com, a lego <br/>
lesson plan building site. Cool site.<br/>
But I am confused about what legos we need for most of these types of plans. <br/>
They recommend the AOE (about 20 K) or eventures for homeschoolers (6K a <br/>
year!)<br/>
Any suggestions? Do they have to be Dacta, or are regular Legos okay if you <br/>
already have the lesson plans? Any suggestions as to kits/where to buy?<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847758747">We use just regular legos we already have (seems like thousands some <br/>
days).  Yesterday we did weirdrichard&#39;s lesson on figuring volume of <br/>
a rectagular prism.  Fun time for my 11 yo and a 12 yo friend.  We <br/>
also worked on surface area.  He also has a lesson on using lego <br/>
wheels to teach about pi and circumference.  The boys took this and <br/>
applied it to all the wheels in the house.<br/>

pulls into a big bag for my hunny, and he passed it on to my son. He has a <br/>
huge tub for his legos, but usually gets this out instead. He did need help with <br/>
it when he was younger, but now he&#39;s strong enough.  Yes, we have THAT many <br/>
legos!   We used to hang it on a hanger in his closet.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also cool because when you open it up and lay it out on the floor, you <br/>
can sift thru the pieces and find the little ones more easily. Ever try to find <br/>
a clear plastic antennae lego piece in a big bin? lol  Oy! <br/>
