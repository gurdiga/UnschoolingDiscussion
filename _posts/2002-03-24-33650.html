<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681128827">&lt;&lt;to see if TX would do what it does so well and ignore previous medical<br/>
history&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not exactly a fan of Texas are you?  Well, I won&#39;t hold it against<br/>
you  &lt;g&gt;.  Actually what Harris County (where Houston is) does so well is to<br/>
send the message that mistreating children is not tolerated. It is known as<br/>
one of the counties toughest on child abusers.  We were foster parents in<br/>
Harris County for several years.  We had 14 children placed with us due to<br/>
abuse and only one went home.  The system there is very explicit about<br/>
requirements for reunification and very hard on parents who do not meet<br/>
those requirements.<br/>
<br/>
By TX law, Mrs. Yates doesn&#39;t meet the criteria for legally insane.  And by<br/>
most accounts the family&#39;s story of Mrs. Yates mental condition has been<br/>
inconsistent (she was doing worse OR she was doing better so MIL wasn&#39;t<br/>
coming to help as much, etc.)  This was also the family, so intent on<br/>
getting help for and supporting this woman, that they didn&#39;t attend her<br/>
sentencing hearing but went on talk shows instead.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-941953606">If they are supposedly known for being so tough on child abuse then why<br/>
aren&#39;t they following the example set by other counties in other states and<br/>
prosecuting the father and doctor?  And maybe the mil who was NOT just 1<br/>
hour late but several hours late!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566158289">On today&#39;s news (Fox) it was confirmed that she had FOUR prior psych<br/>
admissions.  They also stated that the husband either left before sentencing<br/>
or wasn&#39;t there at all because he was off to do Larry King.<br/>
