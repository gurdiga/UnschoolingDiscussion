<div id="ygrps-yiv-357778639">I would LOVE to share Kirby&#39;s newest resume with people. It&#39;s all  <br/>
cool. But... He has a secret job. And he&#39;s not even in the CIA or a  <br/>
60&#39;s nuclear physicist. Darn it. But I can share bits of it. He works  <br/>
at Blizzard in Austin and is applying for a different position.   <br/>
Sorry for the need to leave out some parts, but seriously; he&#39;s seen  <br/>
people fired for naming their jobs in public or saying what they do.<br/>

strong relationships with my co-workers to improve team performance.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dear Mr. ******************,<br/>
<br/>
My outgoing personality and extensive customer service experience,  <br/>
along with my time with Blizzard ***********************makes me a  <br/>
strong candidate for the position of  <br/>
********************************.   I would like to invest myself  <br/>
further in the company&#39;s success.<br/>
<br/>
I have seven years of experience in gaming and supervision, having  <br/>
been employed in a gaming store for four years from the time I was  <br/>
fourteen, and teaching karate for those years and afterward.<br/>
<br/>
During my time in the gaming store, I judged and organized local and  <br/>
regional tournaments for several games, oversaw sales tables, and  <br/>
taught games in the shop.<br/>
<br/>
I studied in the karate dojo for ten years. I went from assisting to  <br/>
being the lead instructor of the junior classes. I left that job to  <br/>
be in a film that has yet to be released. I&#39;ve led a busy life.<br/>
<br/>
I never went to a formal school until I took a few college classes. I  <br/>
was homeschooled in an artsy, radical way through play, exploration  <br/>
and travel.  It was documented as it went by my mother, who is a  <br/>
leader in the field of unschooling.  She has a book and a website   <br/>
(SandraDodd.com/unschooling).    Primarily, I learned how to learn.<br/>
<br/>
When I was eighteen, I did extremely well in the couple of classes I  <br/>
took at the community college.  I have continued to learn from  <br/>
everything and everyone around me.<br/>
<br/>
I hope the momentum of my life will be of value to Blizzard.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely yours,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-633924778">Very cool! I love that his unschooling is placed in there very clearly and  <br/>
proudly.<br/>
 <br/>
That is the most creative cover letter I have ever seen. Seriously. *Where*  <br/>
does one learn to make a cover letter like that? The classes I&#39;ve taken and <br/>
the  things I&#39;ve seen online have been carbon-copy, repetitive of the resume/job <br/>
 offer, dull, unimaginative and hokey. *That* is the kind of cover letter <br/>
Dave  needs in his now year and a half job search!<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for sharing all that.<br/>

energies to your company, while remaining vital and alive.&quot;<br/>

Some he took out of the resume when it was cut down.  I had helped  <br/>
him by phone several months ago write the unschooling part, and it  <br/>
hadn&#39;t been used but he still had it.  He started to apply for this  <br/>
job in the winter, but decided he didn&#39;t know enough to do a great  <br/>
job and didn&#39;t want to be one of the guys who doesn&#39;t really know  <br/>
what he&#39;s doing.<br/>
<br/>
He said he used the discarded parts of the resume and looked at some  <br/>
cover letters online.<br/>
<br/>
Also, before he wrote that, he &quot;shadowed&quot; someone who does the kind  <br/>
of job he wants to do, so he knew more about what it involved and so  <br/>
he&#39;d be more confident he could do it and speak confidently in an  <br/>
interview.<br/>
<br/>
And he never even took one of those high school careers awareness or  <br/>
life-skills classes.  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

I&#39;m sure those of you who have followed The Adventures of Kirby for  <br/>
so many years will sympathize with the great pain I feel at not being  <br/>
able to tell you everything I know about what he&#39;s doing.    After  <br/>
his whole life of full disclosure (starting in La Leche League, when  <br/>
he nursed in front of others and was an example of this&#39;n&#39;that  <br/>
forever after), for me to say &quot;and...  Uh...&quot; is not fun.<br/>
