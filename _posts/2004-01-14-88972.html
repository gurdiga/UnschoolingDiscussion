Oh, and the new one is about video games, and he parodies four games (or <br/>
kinds of games) and THEN at the end (let it keep running) you can *play them.*<br/>
<br/>
That is amazing.<br/>
<br/>
So do any of you remember the name of that frustrating, terrible DOS game <br/>
that used to be on universities&#39; computers in the 70&#39;s and on some home computers <br/>
in the late 70&#39;s?   It&#39;s one of the games that&#39;s parodied.  I nearly choked <br/>
laughing so hard.<br/>
<br/>
Keith can&#39;t remember but thinks the name started with a Z or something like <br/>
&quot;Zorg.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It started like &quot;you&#39;re outside a hut (or cave or I forget what).&quot;  You see a <br/>
rope, a lantern, a key, a... (various bits of game junk).  What do you want <br/>
to do?<br/>
<br/>
And you had to type back to it, and most of the verbs got you &quot;I do not <br/>
understand.  What do you want to do?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone remember that?   You&#39;d have to say &quot;Take rope&quot; or &quot;get rope&quot; or &quot;use <br/>
rope&quot; but there wasn&#39;t much more you could do.<br/>
<br/>
Well anyway, here it is, playable (short but hilarious):<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607310084">Andrew (14) and his friend Matt (13) spent the weekend at Matt&#39;s <br/>
house.  When they showed up to drop Andrew off Andrew had on his <br/>
black Trogdor shirt and Matt had on his white Trogdor shirt.  They <br/>
made me laugh.  Andrew&#39;s CCD class (Catholic sunday school thing) has <br/>
a lock in at a bowling alley this sunday.  Friends can come (Matt&#39;s <br/>
going, he&#39;s a Buddhist at the moment...Andrew told him it was okay to <br/>
go it&#39;s not going to be bowling for Jesus LOL) anyway, Matt and Andy <br/>
are going to bring the Strongbad Sings CD and see if the Bowling <br/>
place will play it, since it&#39;s only going to be the St.Andrew&#39;s kids <br/>
there.  It should be hilarious!<br/>
<br/>
Right now, however, Andrew is having a Burnout 2 marathon with <br/>
himself. Hey, in Andrew&#39;s case his love for european sports cars <br/>
turned him onto racing games which in turn had him get me to <br/>
subscribe to European Car magazine, and learning to drive when he was <br/>
12. <br/>

Actually, it is Zork.  &quot;The Zork Trilogy is set in the ruins of an ancient empire lying far underground. &quot;  I used to love it, and still do.  My husband and I played together, creating detailed maps, including the changing, disorienting maze you have to map out, figuring out the logic puzzles, etc. together.  The frustration was the part that made me THINK.  I still love games that are of this ilk (though now the graphics are incredible of course), including the Seventh Guest, the Leisure Suit Larry series (very R rated), etc.  <br/>

It seemed that every time I went to my then-boyfriend&#39;s office he was <br/>
playing that bleeping game on the Dec Vax 11/780. He still plays it <br/>
sometimes. He has since taught it to our eight-year-old. I have told him <br/>
that if I had known back then I would be watching my son play the same game <br/>
twenty years later I might have walked away instead of marrying him :-)<br/>

You can play the old rogue or the newer version online at <br/>

If it was &quot;Deep as a well,&quot; I think it might be the moon reflected in water.  <br/>
It looks as far away (deep) as it can.<br/>
<br/>
So I have one.  My dad had a word puzzle and I told him never to tell me the <br/>
answer.  And I bought a farmer&#39;s almanac once that had the same puzzle, and <br/>
said &quot;answer on page xxx&quot; and so I put the almanac in a safe place so I could <br/>
look if I never figured it out or my dad died.<br/>
<br/>
My dad died long ago.  I never figured it out.  I never found the almanac.<br/>
<br/>
Here it is:<br/>
<br/>
A man has a forty pound block of lead and a balance scale.  He divides the <br/>
lead into four pieces such that with the balance scale he can weigh anything <br/>
from one to 40 lbs.<br/>
<br/>
So two of them are apart by one.   That&#39;s all the math I can think.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been 35 years.  I&#39;m willing to be told the answer now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730947978">Hmm.... I wonder if it was &quot;as deep as a house&quot; and I DID solve it  and then forgot that I had solved it and remembered it wrong for 20+ years.  ARGHHH.  Makes me wish I were more consistent about keeping a diary. <br/>
<br/>
I like the answer of the &quot;moon&quot; though -- I think I will believe that to be the answer for at least the next 20 years. <br/>

So do any of you remember the name of that frustrating, terrible DOS game <br/>
that used to be on universities&#39; computers in the 70&#39;s and on some home computers <br/>
in the late 70&#39;s?   It&#39;s one of the games that&#39;s parodied.  I nearly choked <br/>
laughing so hard.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
******************<br/>
<br/>
OHH, yes, I do remember that - -can&#39;t remember the name, though.  <br/>
<br/>
Here is a question, though, for anyone else who remembers playing that game.<br/>
<br/>
The game had a riddle: <br/>
&quot;Deep as a well, round as a cup, all the king&#39;s horses can&#39;t pull it up. &quot;:<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know the answer?  I have now wondered for well over 20 years. lol.  <br/>

because I didn&#39;t know any better ;-)<br/>
<br/>
My kids tried it, but quickly tired of it.  Not enough<br/>
instant gratification like today&#39;s games, i guess.<br/>
<br/>
I played a similar star game...trying to remember the<br/>
name...it was played on an internet message board.  It<br/>
was called Planet Bashers, and I would upload my moves<br/>
every day.  Great fun!  The group who played called<br/>
ourselves the Ferrets.  My kids were the first kids<br/>
born to any of us, so they were the &quot;micro-ferrets&quot;.<br/>
LOL!  Thanks for stirring up such fun memories!<br/>

&gt;&gt; YES!  it was Zorg.  I always died before I got<br/>

games&quot;.  I introduced him to the Hitchhikers Guide text based game when he<br/>
was about 8, and he loved it!  They were a bit frustrating for him, but he<br/>
got the idea to make a story and tell it to his friends, bit by bit while<br/>
walking around the park and giving them chances to influence the story<br/>
outcome.  They are also a bit like the choose your own adventure books.  He<br/>
has a friend in another part of the state who calls him up periodically and<br/>
practically begs for an adventure.<br/>
