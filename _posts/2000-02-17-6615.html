<div id="ygrps-yiv-334634865">ok...well it could carry disease, if you wish to keep it, just make sure <br/>
everyone washes their hands well after playing with it...<br/>
Give it water, some bedding...ripped up newspaper will do...or wood <br/>
shavings...or hay...<br/>
I suppose it will eat anything...fruits/veggies...stale bread...they also <br/>
sell Mouse food<br/>
at pet stores...<br/>
and if you go to the pet store, how about an exercise wheel....<br/>
I too am an animal saver....good luck...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-7297697">O.K., not safe, they carry fleas that may or may not have Lyme Disease<br/>
(depends on your area) and if it allowed them to catch it, it has problems.<br/>
  When it gets better (if it does which it might not because cats usually<br/>
end up causing internal injuries) it will not be a happy camper and little<br/>
fingers make great munching areas.  Now, if they don&#39;t go with the barn<br/>
idea, then you need mouse food from the pet shop and water.  Also, they are<br/>
great escape artists and have great strength in relationship to size so<br/>
have been known to push aquarium lids off.<br/>

I am what they call a mouse fancier.  I love mice!  They make great pets, but <br/>
usually not the wild ones.  :-(  Sorry.  I would let him go, and replace him <br/>
with a store bought mouse.  They usually cost under $2.  You can put them in <br/>
a little mouse house (acquarium is fine).  I usually use some kind of store <br/>
bought bedding plus some cotton, hair from haircuts, and paper towels for <br/>
them to dig and burrow in.  You can feed them store bought mouse food, plus <br/>
they love fresh veggies (tiny bits), sunflower seeds, bread pieces soaked in <br/>
milk, and peanut butter.  You can train them to walk all over you (if you <br/>
don&#39;t mind their droppings).  We don&#39;t have any right now, but when we did, <br/>
they were great fun to watch.  Females can live together nicely.  Stick a <br/>
wheel in the cage, some toilet paper tubes, and watch the fun.  I think they <br/>
are much more interesting than hamsters or gerbils.  Our last two were a <br/>
beautiful sleek black male named Eeeka, and a long-haired mail named Huck who <br/>
used to &quot;talk&quot; to the kids.  We miss them.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014527743">Dear Jill, or any other mouse expert,<br/>
<br/>
   I was in the pet store one day when a man came in and bought about a dozen <br/>
mice.  Clueless, I asked why he was buying so many.  When he replied he was <br/>
going to feed them to his snake, I screamed, &quot;I&#39;ll take one!&quot;  I am a devout <br/>
vegetarian with a tender heart, and I wanted to save even just one of these <br/>
creatures from the jaws of death.  I bought a tank, bedding, food and some <br/>
toys, named the new family member Walt and set up his cage in my kitchen so <br/>
we could all watch him.<br/>
<br/>
   I don&#39;t know if Walt just had a personal hygiene problem or if this is <br/>
true for all mice, but Walt had a very undesirable odor.  I had to move him <br/>
to a spare bedroom, and no matter how often I cleaned his cage, he reeked.  <br/>
It got to the point where no one but me went in that bedroom, and I only went <br/>
in to clean the cage and make a hasty retreat.  By that point, I was so <br/>
disgusted by poor Walt that I could have fed him to a snake myself!  I ended <br/>
up giving him back to the pet store, and I feel guilty about this even three <br/>
years later.<br/>
<br/>
   So I guess this is my question: Walt was a white mouse with red eyes.  Are <br/>
there less stinky mice?<br/>

ROFL.  Probably not.  Mice are not the prettiest smelling creatures.  Of <br/>
course in a home with 3 dogs and 7 cats, and 2 rabbits, the mouse odor is <br/>
just part of the ambiance.  <br/>
<br/>
The animal I would NOT have again due to odor is the guinea pig.  That was <br/>
too much even for me. <br/>

anyway.<br/>
I think the kids will be fine.  We live on a farm after all, and have<br/>
lots of animals.  I really don&#39;t want anything more to take care of<br/>
anyway.  They are troopers when it comes to bad times with animals<br/>
anyway.  They are tough after seeing horses put down, and chickens get<br/>
killed or ill.<br/>

&gt;  There was something about that on Discovery channel [I think] a few weeks<br/>
&gt; ago, pretty nasty stuff.  Are they also found in the mid-west?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>   Sue, this is too funny.  as i read David&#39;s message, i recalled <br/>
seeing a big deal on it at discovery.com a couple weeks ago.  i <br/>
followed one of the links and found a lot more good info too.  i also <br/>
had found my way to a map showing the number of cases thus far <br/>
for each state.  why oh why didn&#39;t i bookmark this site?<br/>
<br/>
    what i do know is that hantavirus is nothing to take chances <br/>
with.  If it is diagnosed early enough, one might survive but the <br/>
chances are pretty slim.  We&#39;ve had several cases in Montana in <br/>
the last couple years and the victims did not survive.  It has been <br/>
detected in 30 states now.  It is an airborne virus transmitted from <br/>
mice urine and droppings.<br/>
<br/>
     Because of the seriousness of this virus, i just retraced my <br/>
footsteps (or should i say fingertips? &lt;G&gt;) to find the maps and <br/>
other sites with in-depth information about the virus for anyone who <br/>
is interested.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416418687">These things are spreading like wildfire.  Lyme was originally only found<br/>
in a small segment of the country and now it is found all over the place. <br/>
They are now, supposedly, trying to track how it is spread and are keeping<br/>
a close eye on the one David mentioned because they are afraid it is going<br/>
to spread like Lyme did since the same population spreads both.<br/>

there less stinky mice?**<br/>

Females are way less smelly.<br/>

Lone males can REALLY stink up the place.<br/>
