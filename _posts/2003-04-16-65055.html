<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936691031">A while back we were discussing the Wiggles and various members of that troup <br/>
- before our Steve/Joe discussions.  I just have to share a vaguely <br/>
unschooling/unfooding kind of story from this morning about the Wiggles.<br/>
<br/>
Nathan (4.5) came downstairs to say goodbye to his father at 8:30 this <br/>
morning to show him a book of Leonard Bernsteins he had taped together from <br/>
his Dad&#39;s discarded homemade cd covers.  After his dad left, I asked if he <br/>
was ready for breakfast and he said &quot;Yes.  And we could watch - (here he <br/>
carefully placed on the floor in front of him his comfort toys from sleeping: <br/>
two finger puppet ballerinas, the Leonard Bernstein book, two gingersnaps has <br/>
asked for before bed last night, his teddy and his well-worn, hole-y blue <br/>
blankie) - THE WIGGLES.&quot;  He did the butt wiggling dance with the arms <br/>
jogging in front as he said Wiggles, then picked up all his stuff and dashed <br/>
off to the sun room to find the tape.  They watched the tape once at <br/>
Christmas when they got it, this is their second time.<br/>
<br/>
He just cracks me up sometimes.  He can identify many conductors and <br/>
composers from pictures, knows more about classical music at his age than I <br/>
did at 20, enjoys snuggling with gingersnaps on his bedside and then eats <br/>
them for breakfast (with Cheerios and milk) in front of the Wiggles!  I think <br/>
childhood is magical.<br/>

<br/>
That is so sweet!!<br/>
<br/>
I love it when kids focus on what they want to focus on. Conductors or <br/>
whatever.  When I got interesting collections of ideas going on as a kid, I <br/>
would hear from adults &quot;You don&#39;t need to know that&quot; and from kids &quot;Why do <br/>
you care?&quot;  Or just simply &quot;That&#39;s stupid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think my kids have ever heard those those put-downs, and I think <br/>
that&#39;s wonderful.  I heard them regularly.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly.  I think my mother, in particular, was afraid to say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; <br/>
in answer to our questions.  We learned not to ask questions, and to be wary <br/>
of letting people know our interests.  We is my brother and I, fifteen months <br/>
apart.  We have two older sisters who were full of telling us how stupid we <br/>
were.  <br/>
<br/>
Now when I say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; and am in a place where we can&#39;t look it up, we <br/>
find another solution or save it for later.  Yesterday I had a brain drain on <br/>
what the inside parts of a flower are called - stamen and pistol.  The kids <br/>
picked tulips on our way to the Home Depot (yes, two came up by the bulbs) <br/>
and when I couldn&#39;t remember the answer they said &quot;Let&#39;s call Daddy!&quot;  Mark <br/>
had easy access to google while I was driving and the kids were passing the <br/>
phone back and forth between them.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the whole magic of it really, isn&#39;t it?  Have an interest, explore it. <br/>
 Have a question, answer it.  Nothing is impossible for them.  They have <br/>
enormous self confidence.  Really, the only trouble they seem to have is in <br/>
realting to schooled kids they are friends with.<br/>
<br/>
I just love this life!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bingo.<br/>
<br/>
So won&#39;t others call that &quot;anti-social&quot; and &quot;doesn&#39;t relate well to agemates&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s simple statement that he didn&#39;t want to go to the prom with his <br/>
girlfriend caused unprecedented (in HIS life, from his point of view) uproar. <br/>
 When he deals with homeschooled friends and they ask him something, the <br/>
answer honestly can be a yes OR a no.  But yet another brush with school kids <br/>
has added yet more evidence to his reasons to avoid brushes with schoolkids.<br/>
<br/>
But won&#39;t the general view of that be that Kirby doesn&#39;t know how to act <br/>
right?  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It will be interesting to see, years down the line, how this shakes out, and <br/>
whether unschoolers are subsumed back into the population by marrying <br/>
schoolkids who insist on school, or whatever.<br/>
