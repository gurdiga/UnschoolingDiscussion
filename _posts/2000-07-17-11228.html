<div><font face="Arial" size="2">you know on the other lists, it works really well 
with a list Mamma....she kind of politely takes the responsibility of shoooing 
off the raving attitudes, and asking people to clearly mark OT..OT&#39;s......and 
makes short sweet comments to bring us back to our focus..thing is here....we 
have hundreds of Mammas, and Pappas, and we all feel the need to reply, and give 
our opinions on certain things that go on....If we could agree on a general 
etiquette, much like a moderated list, and elect a list Mamma, someone who is 
willing to moderate us...it may be helpful in keeping the flow , flowing .&nbsp; 
Just an idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle*</font></div></html></div>
