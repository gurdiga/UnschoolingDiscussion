<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008716922">Ok, all of my unschooling friends,<br/>
most of you responded to the negativity of <br/>
advertisments, and the ideals of going back to school etc.<br/>
in my just thinking post.<br/>
<br/>
I do daycare in my home, and its very apparent that &quot;the be off with<br/>
you&quot; stage can start as early as infants.<br/>
Some parents are bound and determined that the child will be at my<br/>
daycare no matter if the child is ill etc. and they will be to work.<br/>
Thank God ,for helping me to write a good contract that backs me up.<br/>
<br/>
The advertising, I feel is supporting this attitude, and what messages exactly<br/>
are our children learning?  Wow, this may come back on the parents someday.<br/>
Just ask my ex.<br/>
<br/>
Reminds me of the song:  Cats in the Cradle.<br/>
<br/>
Kids do &quot;get a life&quot;, and than they aren&#39;t on your apron strings, in fact,<br/>
pending on how they have been rasied (pushed out the door, ignored) they don&#39;t<br/>
need you anymore, but please remember with these children money is always<br/>
welcome and accepted.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-772770251">It really does amaze me how many people I know (who<br/>
wouldn&#39;t need the money if not for the 3 or 4<br/>
vacations a year (without the kids!), the house with a<br/>
3 room master bedroom suite, etc.) who put their<br/>
children in daycare 10 hours a day starting at 6 weeks<br/>
old.  My neighbor has a 2yo grandson my 2yo loves to<br/>
play with, but she doesn&#39;t get much chance because<br/>
he&#39;s in daycare 10 hours a day M-F.  I heard his<br/>
mother and grandmother in their pool the other day and<br/>
yelled over to ask if Elysian & Jay could play (here<br/>
or there) and they said he wasn&#39;t there, his mother<br/>
wanted a day off to go swimming so she had dropped him<br/>
at day care! Didn&#39;t it occur to them that maybe Jay<br/>
would have wanted a day to swim rather than spend<br/>
another 10 hour day in a daycare - and didn&#39;t she miss<br/>
him?<br/>
