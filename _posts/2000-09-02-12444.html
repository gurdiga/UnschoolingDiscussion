&lt;&lt; So far, though, I haven&#39;t read one bit of parenting advice that I haven&#39;t <br/>
heard/read before, at least a dozen times. These ideas are not new to me. <br/>
I&#39;ve read, heard, researched, read some more, weighed, considered, sometimes <br/>
tested, sometimes accepted, sometimes rejected, I think every parenting <br/>
philosophy you can think of. I&#39;ve found our balance, together with the <br/>
children and DH. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If there is absolutely NOTHING new here, nothing you haven&#39;t read or heard <br/>
elsewhere, no thoughts to chew on or ponder, why the heck are you here?<br/>
Did you just come here to share your amazing wisdom with the rest of us?<br/>
Cuz I personally don&#39;t join email lists or message boards if I am not hearing <br/>
anything new to think about!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045413869">You guys gotta quit asking me stuff, we&#39;re clogging the list! I came here for unschooling ideas (since it is an unschooling list) - to learn new things to do, projects to try, places to go, ideas to look into and research, and any thing else that looked like something my kids would be interested in! Not to get bombarded with millions of OT questions and start huge debates about OT things when I post my opinion, hoping to help and perhaps give others something to consider. <br/>

Well, the thing I keep telling my teenagers is you just    don&#39;t     know    <br/>
what   you    don&#39;t      know.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a sign of maturity to realize that.  <br/>

<br/>
One big unschooling idea is that children shouldn&#39;t be spanked.<br/>
An idea you can look into and research is the harm that spanking can do<br/>
to children.<br/>
Your kids would be interested to know all children are deserving of<br/>
respect and should never be spanked.<br/>
<br/>
None of the above is Off Topic to unschooling.<br/>

Your not even scratching the surface of what unschooling is, if <br/>
that&#39;s all you want.  An ecclectic list would probably be filled <br/>
with &quot;to do&quot; ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531269967">Thanks for your suggestion! If you know of any good lists like that, please let me know. Most I&#39;ve tried out are way too &quot;schoolish&quot; for us, with things like organized field trips or class suggestions. <br/>
