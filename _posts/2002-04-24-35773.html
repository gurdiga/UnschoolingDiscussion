<div id="ygrps-yiv-255911156">Hi JoAnna -   Getting Started was the first book on homeschooling that I<br/>
read.  I remember being on the second page and telling my husband I didn&#39;t<br/>
need to read any more!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious as to what you mean by, &quot;and have finally made the decision to<br/>
start a combination of the two this fall&quot;.  How do you envision combining<br/>
homeschooling and unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list!  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021676702">Hi, all! I just joined this list and wanted to introduce myself. My <br/>
name is Jo Anna, I&#39;m 28 with a 7 year old daughter. She&#39;s currently <br/>
in Public School, but is very advanced and not thriving well in <br/>
public school because she&#39;s bored stiff. She&#39;s been in 3 different <br/>
schools in 3 years to try to &quot;fix&quot; this problem, and none of them <br/>
really are any better than the others (well, the school she was in in <br/>
1st grade was good, but over an hour away, and she was throwing up in <br/>
the car every day twice a day - on the way there and the way back.)<br/>
<br/>
Due to her advanced skills and the public school&#39;s inability to <br/>
accommodate them, we&#39;ve spent most of this school year investigating <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling, and have finally made the decision to <br/>
start a combination of the two this fall - so this will be her last <br/>
year in public school unless something goes horribly wrong!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very excited, and plan to write our own &quot;curriculum&quot; based on <br/>
Rebecca Rupp&#39;s guidance in her books &quot;Getting Started Home Learning&quot; <br/>
and &quot;Home Learning Year by Year&quot;. Her style has really struck a <br/>
chord with me, and is very similar to my style of teaching.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope to post here often, and will probably have a million <br/>
questions for all of you as we get started!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I was just wondering if you&#39;ve given any thought to NOT writing up a <br/>
curriculum?  MAybe just go with the flow and do fun things for a bit <br/>
and see what you both think?   I can tell you that they do learn <br/>
without a plan from mom!  They even manage to learn things I can&#39;t <br/>
teach!<br/>

Don&#39;t be surprised or offended to get lots of opinions on curriculums and <br/>
such. ;o) We&#39;re a pretty determoned group when it comes to spreading the <br/>
word about total unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058117810">Thank you for the input - that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m looking for!!<br/>
<br/>
Actually, that&#39;s why I put quotes around the word &quot;curriculum&quot; - because it<br/>
really isn&#39;t a curriculum per se, but a plan of action.  It&#39;s parental<br/>
guidance for child-led activities.  In other words, we want to do a thematic<br/>
child-led program but I feel there needs to be some parental guidance for<br/>
logistics sake.  So, the plan right now (and like I said, I&#39;m just learning<br/>
all this, so I&#39;d love feedback from you!) is to sit down with my daughter<br/>
before our &quot;nonschool&quot; year starts and talk about themes she&#39;d like to<br/>
pursue next year.  She&#39;s already told me she&#39;s interested in endangered<br/>
species, so we&#39;ll probably start there.  Then, if we have any activities<br/>
that need special materials or advanced notice (like a trip to the Aquarium,<br/>
you have to buy your tickets in advance, etc.) then we&#39;ll plan those first.<br/>
Having a plan of action is more what I meant.  I guess I should&#39;ve been more<br/>
clear - my apologies!!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-933861032">Thanks, Mary - I don&#39;t get offended easily, but thanks for the warning.<br/>
I&#39;ve only been on this list for about 18 hours, and the battles are quite<br/>
interesting.  I feel like I&#39;m unschooling myself on human interaction<br/>
(sociology, anyone?)  LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105894984">Thanks for the clarification.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the need for a plan, I have one who can&#39;t function day to <br/>
day unless he knows what is happening when and where we will be, etc.<br/>
<br/>
My one word of caution, don&#39;t get so wrapped up in the plan that you <br/>
(plural -  you and/or your dd) can&#39;t change it later!  What sounds <br/>
great in August, may be the pits in December.<br/>
