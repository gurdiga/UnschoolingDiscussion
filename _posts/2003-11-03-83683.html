<div id="ygrps-yiv-526606726">WHY someone would <br/>
want to give a kid a &quot;God Loves You&quot; tract on Halloween.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering, and why not?  It is another opportunity for Christians to <br/>
share the love of Jesus with others.  My son got a few of those.  He looked at <br/>
them, asked me the same question you asked.  I answered what I said above.  He <br/>
said okay, and threw it away.  That was his choice, and besides, what else was <br/>
he going to do with it?  I look at it this way.  If we are willing to go to <br/>
other people&#39;s houses and expect them to give us candy, if in their own homes <br/>
they want to attach a tract and give it out with the candy, who am I to judge?  <br/>
It&#39;s no different than tying a yellow ribbon around the old oak tree.  We can&#39;t <br/>
expect people to repect our values as unschoolers or republicans or democrats <br/>
or independents or I don&#39;t care either which ways if we are not mutually <br/>
respectful.  <br/>

SEND THEM TO ME!!!<br/>
<br/>
I love those.  I used to pass them out when I was younger and the fervor was <br/>
upon me, and I like to see the variety.  Holly got one last year, and Kelly <br/>
Lovejoy sent me a good one, a little comic book.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re still in the trash and you can retrieve them, or if any of you are <br/>
not packrats and will eventually throw them away (if you got any) please send <br/>
them to me:<br/>

Child evangelism is a big thing around here - but it is extremely <br/>
offensive, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
It has far more potential, imo, to turn children away from organized <br/>

so-called religious people behave in such inconsiderate ways - imposing <br/>
themselves in inappropriate places and appealing to other people&#39;s <br/>

I noticed little booklets in my kids&#39; candy bag.  They were awfully excited <br/>
to pull them out and show them to me... I braced myself for the explanation <br/>
that I would have to pull out of you know where for this... they were Halloween <br/>

*****************************************<br/>
At a restaurant I worked at, this smug Christian family would come in and <br/>
give me a tract and a 1.00 tip (on about a 25.00 meal).  These people were so <br/>
ignorant.  I so wanted to say, &quot;Keep your damn tract and your measly 1.00 tip.  <br/>
The pagan at the other table just gave me a $5.00!&quot;  Never did though...didn&#39;t <br/>
want to lose my job :o(<br/>
<br/>
And I absolutely hated working Sunday morning, after the Church crowd came <br/>
in.  The tips were the worse and the people were the most rude out of the entire <br/>
week.  The drunks that came in Friday and Saturday nights were kinder than <br/>
the Church people.  I hate to sound like I&#39;m stereotyping, but the same thing <br/>
happens to my daughter who now waits tables.  She dreads Sunday afternoons.<br/>

members come out to the church parking lot and decorate up thier car trunks, truck <br/>
beds, hatch backs, whatever.. Folks dress up and hand out candy.. It&#39;s so much <br/>
easier than going door to door.. Kids come from all over town ( not just <br/>
church members) and they trick or treat around the trunks..There are usually games <br/>
and a hot dog supper too.  Most &quot;mainstream&quot; Baptists, Methodists, <br/>
Presbyterians, Lutherans are not against &quot;Halloween&quot; per se (in this area)  It&#39;s just <br/>
the extreme fundies that think its &quot;Satans Holiday&quot;..  Just about every church <br/>
around here does something for Halloween, it may be a Fall Festival  or Trunk <br/>
or Treat.. I have had most of my &quot;Halloween Fun&quot; at church functions..   <br/>

members park in the church parking lot, and give candy out of the trunks of the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-553831683">Teresa sent me a link to the chick tract site.<br/>
OH MY GOSH!!  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s both frightening and funny.<br/>
<br/>
From their page on Catholicism, some of the most blatantly bogus &quot;history&quot; <br/>
I&#39;ve ever seen:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Didn&#39;t Christianity consist of the Catholic Church for the first 1500 years?<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;No. While the Catholic Church was seeking to control the world through <br/>
religion, true Christians were running for their lives from the Catholic holocaust <br/>
that ran for centuries. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;God has always had His people, faithful to Him and His Word. They had no <br/>
part in the Roman Catholic Church. Through much of history, organized religion <br/>
has hunted and slaughtered God&#39;s people. For an excellent overview of this, <br/>
read the classic work, &quot;The Trail of Blood,&quot; at one of these websites:  xx&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
[and they give two, and I&#39;ll go look, but one only has to know the history of <br/>
the publication of the Bible to know that God did NOT always have &quot;his <br/>
people&quot; and there was no Baptist church going back to the time of Christ. ]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and from that same page, an answer to the complaint Pam S. made about people <br/>
&quot;witnessing&quot; to other people&#39;s kids, though this is about all Catholics:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In his book, Smokescreens (you can read it online), Jack Chick explains why <br/>
it is important for us to witness to Catholics, rather than accepting them as <br/>
brothers and sisters in Christ. We must love them enough to tell them the <br/>
truth! Some will become angry, others will respond in faith. But if we truly love <br/>
them, we won&#39;t hold back the truth. &gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-399612657">First let me say, Sandra, too late!  Garbage goes quickly around here, so <br/>
those tracts are gone!  Maybe I&#39;ll remember next year and save them for you, but <br/>
that&#39;s a long time from now and I&#39;m almost 40 so I&#39;m not promising anything.  <br/>
<br/>
Second, I&#39;d like to say, Pam S., I guess we&#39;ll just have to agree to disagree <br/>
about handing those tracts out w/ the candy.  I think if I were personally <br/>
worried about them, I wouldn&#39;t have my children going to someone else&#39;s house <br/>
and asking them to give them something.  I don&#39;t take anything too seriously <br/>
anymore, and really, this web group has helped tremendously in that just in the <br/>
last few weeks.  I see my children making considerate choices without my <br/>
intervention in all areas of their lives, and I feel such freedom.  I feel like I <br/>
have intelligent discussions instead of barking out orders and commands.  I am <br/>
seeing my children as mutual partners in our family, and I am amazed at how <br/>
wonderful they are.  Consequently, I wouldn&#39;t care if someone gave them a tract <br/>
from Wicca, or Jehovah Witness&#39;, or Timbuk2.  I am confident we&#39;d discuss it <br/>
intelligently, they&#39;d decide whether or not they&#39;d want to know more, and we&#39;d <br/>
go with whatever their decision came to be.  I must say, though, I am very <br/>
surprised people get so offended at tracts.  To me it&#39;s like emails I don&#39;t want, <br/>
junk mail, phone calls after 9-and commercials.  Delete, delete, delete.  And <br/>
it is just sharing of information, you can take it or leave it.  If I&#39;m <br/>
getting this unschooling way of thought down, and kids are watching things and doing <br/>
things that mainstream America doesn&#39;t do and we are still trusting them, why <br/>
can we not trust them as well in regards to religion?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, those Chick tracts are .. well. like I said &quot;notorious&quot; .. They are <br/>
downright absurd.. so much so, that is it funny.. But, not really funny when you <br/>
think about the propaganda that they spread.    I don&#39;t know how many of them <br/>
that Landon has collected, actually, he is the one that told me (showed me) <br/>
about them..<br/>

can&#39;t count how many skinned knees, twisted ankles, ripped costumes, scary dog <br/>

running across big lawns,  dropping your candy,  all some common <br/>
pain-in-the-ass  things about door to door trick or treating in the boondocks.   In town, <br/>
and in housing developments, folks do still go door to door, but there are <br/>
churches, rec centers, malls, and lots of other places that offer easier options <br/>
to country living trick or treating. <br/>

are just turned off by it and that&#39;s fine with me. My point was that if <br/>
someone really CARES to try to convert people, this is a <br/>
counterproductive way to do it because it is offensive to other <br/>
parents. I get it that they think they have this great gift - eternal <br/>
life - and they want to pass it on - but my point is that they are <br/>
hurting their own chances of passing it on when they hand out tracts to <br/>
trick-or-treaters.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661929841">Isn&#39;t it just nauseating? But Chick Tracts have a cult following, of <br/>
sorts. Kind of a collector&#39;s item.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s just awful, IMO. you should see the one on the antichrist. He&#39;s <br/>
dressed like the pope, and all these priests and nuns with a 666 on <br/>
their foreheads. L <br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I don&#39;t know if anyone takes Chick seriously. Possibly. But no <br/>
one I&#39;ve ever met. (In my VAST experience, you see ;)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; From their page on Catholicism, some of the most blatantly <br/>
bogus &quot;history&quot; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve ever seen:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Didn&#39;t Christianity consist of the Catholic Church for the first <br/>
1500 years?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;No. While the Catholic Church was seeking to control the world <br/>
through <br/>
&gt; religion, true Christians were running for their lives from the <br/>
Catholic holocaust <br/>
&gt; that ran for centuries. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;God has always had His people, faithful to Him and His Word. They <br/>
had no <br/>
&gt; part in the Roman Catholic Church. Through much of history, <br/>
organized religion <br/>
&gt; has hunted and slaughtered God&#39;s people. For an excellent overview <br/>
of this, <br/>
&gt; read the classic work, &quot;The Trail of Blood,&quot; at one of these <br/>
websites:  xx&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; [and they give two, and I&#39;ll go look, but one only has to know the <br/>
history of <br/>
&gt; the publication of the Bible to know that God did NOT always <br/>
have &quot;his <br/>
&gt; people&quot; and there was no Baptist church going back to the time of <br/>
Christ. ]<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and from that same page, an answer to the complaint Pam S. made <br/>
about people <br/>
&gt; &quot;witnessing&quot; to other people&#39;s kids, though this is about all <br/>
Catholics:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;In his book, Smokescreens (you can read it online), Jack Chick <br/>
explains why <br/>
&gt; it is important for us to witness to Catholics, rather than <br/>
accepting them as <br/>
&gt; brothers and sisters in Christ. We must love them enough to tell <br/>
them the <br/>
&gt; truth! Some will become angry, others will respond in faith. But if <br/>
we truly love <br/>
&gt; them, we won&#39;t hold back the truth. &gt;&gt;<br/>

me...it has to be true!  I think they spread proselytism and hate.<br/>

We go to town to trick or treat with friends in their neighborhood.  When my <br/>
