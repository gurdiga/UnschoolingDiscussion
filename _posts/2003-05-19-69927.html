<div id="ygrps-yiv-128422351">Hello there all,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to share a link to a great online multiplication <br/>
resource:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gdbdp.com/multiflyer">http://www.gdbdp.com/multiflyer</a><br/>
<br/>
Multiflyer is a free game to play online (or you can register and <br/>
download the game and also get cool extra interactive <br/>
multiplication tools and fun stuff.) The premise is that you are a <br/>
pilot trying to save the solar system. You have to use your <br/>
multiplication skills to find navigation coordinates to get to the <br/>
next station. The game also has a practice feature for drilling.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
Dan Perkins<br/>
