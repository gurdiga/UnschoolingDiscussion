<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026274186">Hi Tracy-- I&#39;m Karen from Ind., and I have some very young kids, too.  I <br/>
enjoyed reading your posts, and I was curious as to where you live in the <br/>
U.K., if you don&#39;t mind sharing.  Your posts catch my attention, as I can <br/>
easily visualize you and your family while reading them.  Thanks for sharing <br/>
so many happy thoughts!                 Karen</div>
