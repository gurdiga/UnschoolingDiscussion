<h4>Shimokawa Family</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-721566114">I&#39;m a foreigner.  I&#39;m American, but Ilive in Japan.  My son gets English<br/>
from me (so your friend could just speak her native language) and<br/>
Japanese from everybody else - Dad, neighbors, people at the store, at<br/>
church, etc.  He speaks both just fine.  The children&#39;s &quot;instruction&quot;<br/>
does not have to be in English (or the official language of the<br/>
country).  Until recently (just because I&#39;m too pregnant to get around<br/>
anymore) we participated in an international group around here, and Mook<br/>
(ds) got his &quot;instruction&quot; in different languages each time we went.  He<br/>
certainly doesn&#39;t speak them all, or even understand what they&#39;re<br/>
saying.  What he has learned, however, is that not everybody in the<br/>
world speaks the same language, has the same skin color (here that would<br/>
be black hair, slanted eyes, etc.), or the same culture.  <br/>
