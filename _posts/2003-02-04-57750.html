<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We looked at many possible pieces of land through a realtor and had about<br/>
&gt; given up. ;-(  Then we saw an ad---for sale by owner---in a local newspaper.<br/>
&gt; Ten acres---12 years pesticide free, so seven years organic! It was an old<br/>
&gt; dairy farm. A bubbly creek runs through it (potable!). Five acres flat with<br/>
&gt; five acres rolling almost all pasture. A few evergreens and some hardwoods on<br/>
&gt; the hills. With views, in a little cove with really cool neighbors (one<br/>
&gt; single mom with a 10 year old son she homeschools). 18 miles west of<br/>
&gt; Asheville, NC.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m taking the boys up this weekend to get their opinions. (Duncan will be<br/>
&gt; all for it as there are horses that live next door! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds perfect!  How wonderful for you.  I hope your boys like it.<br/>
<br/>
I love that you&#39;re still thinking conference, just in a new place.  Kelly<br/>
the conference queen!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, but just so everyone knows, there&#39;ll HAVE to be a year layoff  (or two) <br/>
while we build and get settled! Don&#39;t go counting chickens, y&#39;all!<br/>
