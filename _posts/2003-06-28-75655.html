<div id="ygrps-yiv-348573392">We have a rather unusual Unschooling life here right now, and we&#39;re in the <br/>
middle of it, but I thought you folks might be interested.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re Unitarian Universalists (in fact, I work as a Director of Religous <br/>
Education for a UU church), and here in Boston right now is the annual gathering <br/>
of UU&#39;s, General Assembly. I have been before in different places, but this is <br/>
the first time it&#39;s been so close, and my family is joining me.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday was the first day we attended, and Julian and I went in. It was so <br/>
cool doing this with him. He had the option of us registering him and doing <br/>
all the youth stuff, but he wanted to go along with me. We did three workshops, <br/>
two of which were exceptional. The first was on modern slavery (there are more <br/>
slaves in the world today than any time in history, including many in the <br/>
US), and was incredible. If anyone wants to hear more, I&#39;d be happy to share. <br/>
Julian was amazed, and wants to do some social action.<br/>
<br/>
The second was on marriage rights, and the panel included reps from Canada, <br/>
VT, CT, and the main plaintiff in the MA case re: same sex marriage. <br/>
<br/>
We also wandered the Exhibit hall, which has so much interesting stuff it&#39;s <br/>
amazing! There were also lots of people who hadn&#39;t seen Julian in a long time, <br/>
so I got to show off my tall, cool boy (which Julian actually just loves. He <br/>
smiles, talks about stuff he&#39;s doing, and stands VERY tall!).<br/>
<br/>
Mostly it was a nice, exhausting day, and we have a couple more. It&#39;s also so <br/>
cool that in one weekend Julian will hear people like Tom Hayden, Julian <br/>
Bond, Frances Moore Lappe, etc. speak.<br/>

<br/>
VERY cool!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; the first was on modern slavery (there are more <br/>
slaves in the world today than any time in history, including many in the <br/>
US) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Absolute numbers, or proportionally?<br/>
<br/>
With six billion people there are more of EVERYTHING people-wise, I&#39;m <br/>
guessing.  <br/>
Anyone know when it was three billion and when we&#39;re expecting seven billion? <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a proportional thing, I&#39;m guessing the definition of slavery has been <br/>
amended to &quot;can&#39;t afford to move away&quot; (land-serfs &gt;&gt; factory serfs?).<br/>
