&gt; Yes, I mean healthy in the sense that their bodies are working at <br/>
&gt; their *optimum* level. I&#39;d say easily less than 1% of people I know <br/>
&gt; or have met or seen are *healthy*. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Optimum&quot;. As in optimum schoolwork? Whose definition?<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m 45-50 lbs overwieght. I *could* eat better. Mostly I eat anything <br/>
that doesn&#39;t eat me first (except for peas and sweet potatoes and eggplant). <br/>
I &quot;exercise&quot; by living my life. It&#39;s a busy life. I occasionally walk. I&#39;ve <br/>
tried running (yech!). I have a pool---but the boys are in it way more than I <br/>
am. <br/>
<br/>
But could I get up: &quot;at 5:00 in the morning, milk three cows, <br/>
carry the pails of milk back to the house, churn the cream into <br/>
butter, split the firewood, walk 6 miles to town to get the supplies <br/>
you need &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
That actually sounds like an EASY day! I&#39;ve done more on a Tuesday! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;to sew all the dresses for your family for the next year?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In one day??? &lt;G&gt; I have all boys! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your great-grandma may have HAD to do that! I don&#39;t HAVE to, but if I must, I <br/>
could! I got up every morning at 5:30 and worked a conference ALL DAY until I <br/>
collapsed after midnight, hardly eating---for FIVE days straight. I&#39;m still <br/>
standing---and obviously healthy ENOUGH for what I DO. And I don&#39;t do that <br/>
every day, but I would if I had to. And THAT would MAKE me healthier, I <br/>
suppose.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; The health club I used to go to did Body Age testing, where they <br/>
&gt; tested your body fat, evaluated your diet, put you on a treadmill and <br/>
&gt; ramped it up until you fell apart, tested your VO2Max (oxygen use), <br/>
&gt; etc. and then they told you what your actual bodily age was - as <br/>
&gt; opposed to the number of years you&#39;ve lived on the planet. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like SCHOOL! <br/>
I don&#39;t have much time for what other folks THINK I must do or be. REALLY no <br/>
time for it. Who decides what my chronological vs bodily age is anyway? I <br/>
know people who could live on and on and on who look pretty out of shape. <br/>
Others have dropped dead running and eating organic. Do you REALLY hold with <br/>
&quot;body age&quot;? What if you die tomorrow? Will it tell you THAT? In advance? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Surprisingly, even most people who were tested there (people who had <br/>
 </span></blockquote>bothered to go to a health club and be active in the first place) had <br/>
a bodily age *above* their chronological age. Often well above.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not REAL life. It&#39;s a simulated, run &#39;em into the ground <br/>
experiment. REAL life is chasing Jalen around for four days! (right, Ren?)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d say healthy means that if someone asked you to climb a mountain <br/>
&gt; tomorrow, you could do it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I could do that. Might be slow, but if my son&#39;s life depended on it? YOU <br/>
BETCHA!!!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;You could walk 20 miles if you needed to. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Uh huh. I&#39;d get a good pair of shoes and some blister bandaids.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Healthy means being able to do anything a body your age should be <br/>
&gt; able to do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can do that. But I don&#39;t &quot;DO&quot; pretend stuff. I&#39;ll do real life things. And <br/>
do them well.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;It means not getting every cold that comes along.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m hardly EVER sick. I&#39;ve missed two days of work IN MY LIFE from illness. <br/>
My 14 year old NEVER was absent from school with illness (other than chicken <br/>
pox)---8 years! <br/>
<br/>
It &gt; means getting up every morning and feeling vital and alive.<br/>
<br/>
I do that too. Bright, sunny, and cheer-y! Can anyone vouch for me? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 I heard a &gt; woman, a healthy-looking woman, at the gym yesterday telling her <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; friend that every morning she had to have two cups of caffeine and <br/>
&gt; three ibuprofin or the stress she&#39;s under gives her a monster <br/>
&gt; headache. *every day*. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe she shouldn&#39;t spend so much time in the GYM! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not healthy. Out of a friend&#39;s 6 &gt; siblings (all in their 30&#39;s or early <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 40&#39;s), one has had a heart <br/>
&gt; attack, two already have diabetes, all are out of shape and <br/>
&gt; overweight. That&#39;s not healthy. But they&#39;re very typical Americans. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of me and MY sibling. We&#39;re both going strong in our 40&#39;s. No illnesses. No <br/>
broken bones. I&#39;m a diet caffeine-free coke junkie---that&#39;s what I lived on <br/>
through the conference. I was tired, but NEVER unavailable. And I think I <br/>
smiled most of the time! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If Americans overall were healthy, the diet <br/>
&gt; industry wouldn&#39;t be a multi-billion dollar industry, there wouldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; be an entire 50-foot-long aisle in the supermarket filled with <br/>
&gt; antacids, cold remedies, aspirin, ibuprofen, acetominophen, etc. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about let&#39;s think about unhappy, unfulfilled people with controlling <br/>
parents who thought they were never good enough and didn&#39;t accept them for <br/>
who they are???? Who need feel-good drugs to ummmm....feel good?<br/>
<br/>
How &#39;bout being told they NEED these things and not being able to make <br/>
decisions for themselves?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d guess that my definition of healthy is maybe more rigorous than <br/>
&gt; what many people consider healthy. I&#39;m not talking about just &quot;not <br/>
&gt; sick&quot; though, but optimum health. So yes, almost no-one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Optimum is what you make of it. Unschooling is optimum for us---and that <br/>
includes out health as well. Where we are right now is &quot;optimum&quot;. We are <br/>
quite healthy. I think genetics plays a HUGE role. My husband and I are <br/>
extremely healthy. Our boys are too. I can do anything I want to do. If I <br/>
needed to run a marathon, I could. I might take a while to finish &lt;G&gt;, but <br/>
I&#39;d get there!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I hang around amazing people who are rarely sick, who have remarkable <br/>
lives (many of you met them this weekend). Maybe they&#39;re doing things they <br/>
love, so they&#39;re not stressed and miserable. Maybe there are different <br/>
definitions of optimum health. I don&#39;t know the folks you&#39;re talking <br/>
about---and I don&#39;t want to. How many do you know?<br/>

Moreover, it was a &quot;test&quot; designed to convince people they needed LOTS of <br/>
expensive spa/coach/dietary supplements or whatever all that &quot;health club&quot; <br/>
was selling.  Imagine the electrical bills and the cost of liability <br/>
insurance and ever-replacing new exercise equipment.  They have something to <br/>

people afraid.<br/>

<br/>
I can!!<br/>
<br/>
I met Kelly on an extended stress-fest weekend, and she was bright, quick, <br/>
patient, efficient, and happy.   Would she be healthier if she woke up <br/>
feeling vital and alive, ready to go to the health club and build up her <br/>
stamina in case she needs to climb a mountain?<br/>
<br/>
And by the way, &quot;climbing a mountain&quot; covers a range of levels of &quot;climbing&quot; <br/>
and &quot;mountain.&quot;  There&#39;s a foot trail up the front of the Sandia Mountains.  <br/>
That&#39;s a mile vertical increase in elevation.  I don&#39;t know how many miles <br/>
the trail is long.  Five or seven maybe?  I really don&#39;t know.   People don&#39;t <br/>
need ropes or equipment.  They hike.  That is  not considered mountain <br/>
climbing.  It&#39;s hiking.<br/>
<br/>
Health doesn&#39;t create knowledge or interest in mountain climbing, which has <br/>
much to do with equipment not even available until the past few years.  <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t hike the La Luz trail, but have lots of friends who have and who do.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a mountain, for sure, but it&#39;s not &quot;mountain climbing.&quot;<br/>

with what you feel like, then good for you.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re missing my point, which is not that arbitrary other <br/>
people should decide who is healthy and who is not, but that in *this <br/>
one example*, people who were *already* attending a gym (and, BTW, <br/>
the gym was free to all of us, because our employer paid for it, so <br/>
the gym wasn&#39;t trying to sell us any new services, they were only <br/>
trying to help people see where they could improve their health and <br/>
do so), were finding out that their health could be improved. These <br/>
were people who volunteered for this, they certainly weren&#39;t forced <br/>
into it by some arbitrary health police :-)<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, and George Burns smoked and lived to 100, so smoking doesn&#39;t <br/>
really cause any health problems either. Maybe I should go light up <br/>
again. &lt;vbg&gt;  <br/>
Whether or not *some* healthy people live longer or don&#39;t is <br/>
beside the point. Health *for me* is not just about how long I&#39;ll <br/>
live, but about the quality of life I have right now. If I can do <br/>
anything I set my mind to doing, and am not restricted by my body, I <br/>
feel great. And if in the meantime, I can spend more years enjoying <br/>
this planet and my family, that&#39;s great too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>(right, Ren?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Right, but measurable quantities, like VO2Max, whether you believe in <br/>
them or not, will determine how long you can chase your kids around <br/>
before dropping to the ground. Whether you ever want to get it <br/>
measured or not, your body (as is everyone&#39;s) is bound by whatever <br/>
level you can process oxygen at, process glycogen from your cells to <br/>
feed your muscles, etc. We *are* biological, physical machines at the <br/>
most basic level. As someone who has an interest in this sort of <br/>
thing, and as a sort of engineering geek type person, it&#39;s <br/>
interesting to me that there are measurable things (like Vo2Max) that <br/>
I can improve on, that actually make a difference in how I feel, or <br/>
how my body will perform. As with everything else in unschooling, I <br/>
don&#39;t expect my interests to be your interests, or anyone else&#39;s. If <br/>
it&#39;s not interesting to you, you obviously wouldn&#39;t sign up to do it.<br/>

great fulfillment. For people who don&#39;t, they don&#39;t. That doesn&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree. Unschooling is, and always has been, the way we want to live <br/>
our lives. It gives our kids the time to just exist, be happy, play, <br/>
run around. I&#39;m sure it helps their mental, emotional, and physical <br/>
health as well, on many levels. Which, of course, is only one reason <br/>
we&#39;ve walked this path of unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s great. My husband&#39;s father died at age 42 of a heart attack <br/>
(when my DH was 7), and his brother had a heart attack at 31, so he <br/>
doesn&#39;t have the best genetics going for him. Me, I&#39;m really grateful <br/>
he gets out there and runs, bikes, plays raquetball, or whatever <br/>
keeps him fit and his heart working *optimally*, I&#39;m glad he eats my <br/>
vegetarian chili instead of a big ol&#39; steak and potato with lots of <br/>
butter dinner, because I don&#39;t want our kids to miss him as much as <br/>
he misses his dad. Even if he has some congenital heart problem and <br/>
his diet and lifestyle choices prolong his life 10 years, or 20, <br/>
myself and his children will get that many more years to be with him. <br/>

to hang around with other vibrant, alive, funny, happy, energetic <br/>
people. My assertion about &quot;most&quot; people being unhealthy had nothing <br/>
to do with the people I hang with on a daily basis. Indeed, I <br/>
probably live in one of the healthiest sections of one of the <br/>
healthiest cities in America. I&#39;ve got 5 organic groceries within <br/>
biking distance of my house, and miles of biking and running and <br/>
hiking trails surrounding us. But that doesn&#39;t mean that all the rest <br/>
of America is healthy. I still stand by my assertion that *most* <br/>
people in our country are unhealthy. Like I said, if you walk into a <br/>
shopping mall or some other random place in the middle of the U.S. <br/>
somewhere, what you don&#39;t see is a whole bunch of healthy, fulfilled, <br/>
happy people bouncing around. What you see is stressed, pallid, <br/>
unhealthy people. Living in such a health-filled place, perhaps it&#39;s <br/>
even more of a contrast when I go somewhere else, who knows. And <br/>
really, it doesn&#39;t matter to me if anyone else cares what my <br/>
definition of healthy is. Like I&#39;ve said, it&#39;s what I think of when <br/>
our family makes food choices, or activity choices. We like to be <br/>
healthy, we like our bodies to work in healthy ways, so we make <br/>
healthy choices. And we&#39;re happy. &#39;Nuff said.<br/>
