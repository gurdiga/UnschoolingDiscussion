<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836698812">You have to do like we did with our dd when she got perfume in her eyes<br/>
and we had to flush them out. She was three at the time. We took a big<br/>
towel and wrapped it around her arms and chest and one of us would hold<br/>
her like that while the other did the flushing. It sounds bad but it<br/>
worked and it was the only way we could get it done short of taking her<br/>
to the ER. Which they would have done the same thing anyway. Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809033578">Hi Melanie;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m only just learning about these options myself, but some alternative<br/>
therapies may be less invasive.  Have you ever considered seeing a<br/>
homeopath or naturopath?  A friend of mine&#39;s daughter had the most<br/>
vicious eye infection the doctor had seen in awhile - conjunctivitis -<br/>
and when antibiotics didn&#39;t help my friend tried only a dose or two of a<br/>
homeopathic remedy and there was an immediate and dramatic change.  The<br/>
remedy consisted of a teeny tablet placed under the tongue and it<br/>
dissolved immediately.  I know what torture it can be to give our young<br/>
ones medicine.  Something else might work better.  Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-308613540">What kind of eye infection could cause blindness?  Conjunctivitis will<br/>
go away on it&#39;s own.  I know since I had it when I was pregnant, and the<br/>
Dr. said I could not take the meds while I was pregnant.  It was very<br/>
uncomfortable, but it did eventually go away.<br/>
I sympathize.  I guess if it was me, I would just have to force him in<br/>
the most loving way possible.  Lots of  snuggling later.  Maybe a reward<br/>
afterward...say a favorite story read ect....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525356684">maybe blind fold him and let him experience what it&#39;s like to not have the<br/>
use of his eyes.  and keep talking with him and explain to him why you<br/>
can&#39;t allow that to happen.  i tell my 41/2  yo son that it&#39;s my job to<br/>
help him stay healthy, safe and happy and sometime we can&#39;t get all of them<br/>
at the same time but that&#39;s what we aim for.<br/>
<br/>
you might want to ask him something like -  it&#39;s my job of keeping you<br/>
healthy and safe but i do want you to be happy as well so since we can&#39;t<br/>
not  give you the medicine what can we do to make it easier for you to take<br/>
it.  i think first you might want to relax him by add the element of play -<br/>
a game like blind folding - to give him back a little power ( i think drs<br/>
use this kind of thing to help them with little ones).<br/>
<br/>
at this age (2-5) power seems to be paramount, they like to express their<br/>
power as much as possible and will resist anything which appears to<br/>
threaten to take it from them.  this not a quick process but i&#39;ve had<br/>
success with my son and i feel it has a very long term positive effect of<br/>
strengthening the bond of trust.<br/>

good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017907936">these are the only meds we every use and we have good success them.  if you<br/>
don&#39;t want to see a altern. dr you can use a homeopathic product called calms<br/>
(it&#39;s easy to find where ever they sell homeopathic) and give it to mook<br/>
about 20 to 30 before trying to give him his meds.<br/>
