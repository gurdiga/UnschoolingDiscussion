any great unschooling saintly mum or anything, I struggle with it on a daily <br/>
basis.<br/>

<br/>
yunno the more I read the more I think we need a truly international <br/>
organisation to actively support unschooling or even home schooling (we call <br/>
it all home education in the UK).<br/>
I think we need an org with some money in it so we can hire people if needed <br/>
and also produce some paper copies of information. I really feel that with <br/>
globalisation is coming the undermining of the &#39;rights&#39; of children and <br/>
their parents, especially with regard to unschooling.<br/>
