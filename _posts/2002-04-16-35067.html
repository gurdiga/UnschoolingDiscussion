He&#39;s starting soccer today which is arranged by grade level.  He&#39;s so excited about it that he&#39;s worked himself up to being quite nervous.  For the last few days he keeps saying &quot;I&#39;m in grade 2&quot;  &quot;grade 2, right?&quot;  He wants to make sure he knows when they ask at registration!<br/>

&gt; Oh gosh Corina!! I can totally relate.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When adults ask that standard question &quot;what grade are you in?&quot; my <br/>
kids actually get a very befuddled look and turn to me for <br/>
help. &quot;What grade am I in?&quot;<br/>
I usually answer &quot;IF you were in ps, you&#39;d be in_____???&quot; and then I <br/>
have to pause and really think about it because I don&#39;t know <br/>
anymore!!!!<br/>
Another answer they give (to the &quot;what school do you go to?&quot; thing) <br/>
is &quot;we don&#39;t go to school&quot;.<br/>
Period.<br/>
No explanation needed.<br/>
I usually get a kick out of the look on people&#39;s faces when they say <br/>
that.<br/>

Everytime someone asks my daughter what grade she&#39;s in she has to look at me<br/>
in puzzlement. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466749675">I agree they say the funniest things.<br/>
<br/>
Last evening, my daughter, son, and I were playing Clue.<br/>
<br/>
My son is three years old. It dawned on him at some point that the pieces in <br/>
the game were called by &quot;real names&quot; as opposed to just their color.<br/>
<br/>
When he found out that the yellow token is &quot;Colonel Mustard,&quot; he began <br/>
calling the red token &quot;Miss Ketchup&quot; instead of &quot;Miss Scarlet.&quot;<br/>
