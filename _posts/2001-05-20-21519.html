Our second-oldest son surprised us the most. He&#39;d been packing around <br/>
a big orange hardcover book for a while, but we never saw him reading <br/>
it. We assumed he was using it for pressing flowers - a family <br/>
interest at the time - because we didn&#39;t think he could read yet. But <br/>
one day he asked a question that showed me he&#39;d been reading the book <br/>
- in fact he was over halfway through it already. It was &quot;James and <br/>
the Giant Peach,&quot; not exactly light reading. That son is now an <br/>
industrial electrician, BTW.<br/>

myelf in a seperate post:-) I have a question for you<br/>
and the other experienced unschoolers here. If your<br/>
boys didn&#39;t read until this late, how did you handle<br/>
yearly testing and/or evaluations? In our<br/>
state(Washington) children older than 8yo are required<br/>
to take an annual standardized test or be evaluated by<br/>
a licensed teacher. I&#39;m starting to panic over how my<br/>
9yo ds will do during his evaluation this summer, as<br/>
it will be his first. He does read, but doesn&#39;t know<br/>
how to write in cursive and isn&#39;t at &quot;grade level&quot; in<br/>
math.  My second question is how do unschoolers handle<br/>
record keeping? TIA! and now I&#39;d better go write my<br/>
intro:-)<br/>

yearly testing and/or evaluations? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t do them.<br/>
<br/>
New Mexico no longer has a testing law.  Kirby should have gone in in third <br/>
grade.  I went to the orientation meeting and decided to just ditch the test. <br/>
 We ditched the make-up test too.  Nobody came after us.  I quit registering.<br/>
<br/>
If I had a hostile ex husband I&#39;d probably have to do more formal stuff, but <br/>
my husband&#39;s in favor of skirting the law.  There are more ways in some <br/>
states than others.  If I really, truly had to register or use a curriculum I <br/>
think I&#39;d use Clonlara.  But I don&#39;t, so I don&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t keep records.  <br/>
<br/>
If I had to keep records, I would follow the excellent advice I&#39;ve read in <br/>
and around unschooling.com and other such places, and I would keep a <br/>
portfolio with lots of photos of kids in interesting situations and places, <br/>
tickets from musuems and movies and concerts, etc.  I will never again keep <br/>
school-style records.  When I was a teacher they paid me to do it, and the <br/>
records on each child were about 1/3&quot; high and 8&quot; wide for each 9-wk period.  <br/>
The records on what the whole class had done weren&#39;t much more detailed than <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
I used to look at the expected competencies (kind of a curriculum for our <br/>
local school district) every month or two to see if Kirby was learning stuff, <br/>
when he was five and six.  He was.  After a while I forgot to look.<br/>

<br/>
My understanding is that in Washington, the test results are only reported<br/>
to the parents, not to the school district.<br/>
<br/>
Some states have laws that permit parents to administer tests at home, and<br/>
potentially the parent could read questions to the student.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
***True on both counts, Betsy. Laura, you can get a standardized test<br/>
through FLO (Family Learning Organization...they have a website of course)<br/>
for about $25 and &quot;administer&quot; the test yourself. Then send it back to FLO,<br/>
who will grade it and send the results back to you. No one else sees it, and<br/>
you&#39;ve complied with the law. I won&#39;t tell if you just &quot;forget&quot; to do it,<br/>
though. And unless you have to interact with the local schools, no one else<br/>
will care, either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-771276598">Well, Sharon, I&#39;m not Helen but I can tell you that from our experience it<br/>
all comes when the time is right.<br/>
<br/>
Oldest son wanted to join Webelos and didn&#39;t want anyone to know that up<br/>
until then I did all the reading.  He &quot;demanded&quot; that I teach him to read IN<br/>
ONE WEEKEND, no less!  He learned to read enough to get by but he didn&#39;t<br/>
enjoy it.  In his late teens, early 20s he *discovered* Zane Gray and no he<br/>
loves to read and when he isn&#39;t reading he is listening to books on tape.<br/>
Now, he doesn&#39;t write except under great duress!<br/>
<br/>
Second son, I swear, was born reading.  I don&#39;t remember a time when he<br/>
couldn&#39;t read.  He loves reading and writing.<br/>
<br/>
Third son (17) is a resistant reader (my terminalogy) and only does so<br/>
because he has to in order to get prepared as he wants to go to college to<br/>
become a veterinarian.  He still does as much as he can on video or tape or<br/>
on the net.  However, he writes beautifully, go figure &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kidlet No.5 learned to read when he was about 10 because he wanted to read<br/>
those books that were so popular there for awhile (Goose Bumps) and I just<br/>
couldn&#39;t read them to him.  Now you can&#39;t drag him away from books!<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry about age.  When they feel a need or want, they will either<br/>
teach themselves or ask you for help.<br/>

maybe you can find another local to ask.<br/>
<br/>
Complete texts of education/homeschooling laws for each state are available<br/>
on the NHEN.org website.  (I don&#39;t remember the exact URL, but it&#39;s pretty<br/>
easy to find.)<br/>
<br/>
Some states have laws that permit parents to administer tests at home, and<br/>
potentially the parent could read questions to the student.  (That&#39;s<br/>
certainly done in schools for kids who are labled &quot;learning disabled&quot;.)<br/>

&quot;The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that<br/>
English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We don&#39;t just borrow<br/>
words; on<br/>
occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them<br/>
unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.&quot;-- James D. Nicoll<br/>

experiences with learning to read. It was interesting and helpful!<br/>
