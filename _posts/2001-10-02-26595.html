If you go to www.unschooling.com and read the library, archives and message <br/>
board,  you might decide you don&#39;t even need this list!   (Seriously, there&#39;s <br/>
a ton of information there, and you can ask questions and get answers same or <br/>
next day.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940617394">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m new here too. I have three kids 18, 11 and 7. My oldest was unschooled except for math. He was good at it and it was no problem but my second struggles with it and it makes him feel stupid. I would like to leave it alone completely but I&#39;m afraid this will leave him at a disadvantage later. My youngest has her oldest brothers aptitude for math which makes it all that much more frustrating for my 11 year old. With her I&#39;m not afraid to leave it alone because I&#39;m confident that she will be able to pick it up, whenever she finds she needs to, without any difficulty. Do unschoolers use a math curriculum, do they make sure their kids understand the basics at some point or do they rely experience and need to accomplish the task?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Leslie Rice<br/>

<br/>
Now, the key thing to this &quot;tossing out the window&quot; thing is to open the <br/>
window!  There, did that help? :)<br/>
<br/>
Really, it&#39;s OK.  You have my permission to throw the text books away.  That <br/>
and a dollar . . .  But go ahead.  Figure out what you want and do it.<br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t be put off by people everywhere who will tell you &quot;the way&quot; to do <br/>
anything.  Figure out what works for you and dive in!  <br/>
<br/>
Warning:  If our experience is any guide, it will all have to be changed <br/>
regularly.  Also OK.  And one thing will click with one kid and not with <br/>
another.  And don&#39;t hold your breath waiting for everyone you know to <br/>
understand.  It really doesn&#39;t matter.  And you will be completely spoiled in <br/>
no time -- just like us!  <br/>
<br/>
What other cliches have I left out guys??  :)<br/>

<br/>
The latter.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody can make sure anyone understands any basics.<br/>
<br/>
A math curriculum takes a small subset of an entire language and a way of <br/>
looking at the world, and says &quot;If you learn these few dozen tricks, you will <br/>
never need to worry.&quot;  It&#39;s not true.  And it creates a set of &quot;requirements&quot; <br/>
(false requirements) which pretty much ignores the larger world of real <br/>
mathematical thinking and inquiry.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have what I think is a cute story about math and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not <br/>
the only unschooler who has experienced this:  When my daughter was 6 <br/>
she was in a ballet class.  Another mother was having trouble with her <br/>
six year old who hated first grade.  I suggested homeschooling and she <br/>
replied that she would never be able to teach her daughter the math.  <br/>
I bit my tongue, but thought, &quot;lady, if you can&#39;t do first grade <br/>
math...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, she seemed to be a functioning human being inspite of her <br/>
self proclaimed lack of math, so I guess the world keeps revolving <br/>
whether you don&#39;t learn the math at school or don&#39;t learn the math at <br/>
home!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-835816792">Your child can and will learn math when it has some meaning in real life.<br/>
 <br/>
My friend struggled all through public school with math.  She could not<br/>
memorize the &quot;times tables&quot;.  She could not add or subtract in her head. <br/>
She never got fractions or percentages.  And in high school she had to<br/>
take algebra twice and still never understood it.   <br/>
Today she is a loan officer.  In real life there are calculators and<br/>
adding machines and computers and people to ask.  Teachers are the only<br/>
ones who get uptight about answering questions, I think.  There is such a<br/>
thing as learning on the job.  <br/>
<br/>
Her inability to do math in school has never effected her life as an<br/>
adult. As an adult she learned exactly what she needed.   It did effect<br/>
her life at school however.  She felt stupid and humiliated and suffered<br/>
from terrible headaches.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know anyone who doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s better to be confident and<br/>
happy and healthy.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-909655189">Hi Deb,<br/>
I couldn&#39;t agree more and thanks for your encouragement. This is exactly the advice I was looking/hoping for! I think I&#39;ll like this list community. I don&#39;t know if I like the term unschooler because it feels a little negative but I&#39;m not what I&#39;d call a homeschooler either unless I&#39;m dealing with the school board. They sure wouldn&#39;t go for the term unschooler. I&#39;m an alternative or community educator/student maybe. Two things for sure, I don&#39;t make my kids go to school and I don&#39;t follow a curriculum, which seems to be just the ticket on this list. A third thing about me, that may be significant here, is that I believe I have more to learn from my kids than I have to teach them.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t know if I like the term unschooler because it feels a little <br/>
negative but I&#39;m not what I&#39;d call a homeschooler either unless I&#39;m dealing <br/>
with the school board. They sure wouldn&#39;t go for the term unschooler.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The term&#39;s not the greatest, true, but it&#39;s an internal term <br/>
anyway--unschoolers are homeschoolers.  Not all homeschoolers are <br/>
unschoolers.  But as far as the state and the neighbors are concerned, to say <br/>
&quot;We&#39;re homeschooling&quot; is a true statement.  It&#39;s only within homeschooling <br/>
discussions that the distinction is useful.<br/>

My hair is about a foot shorter now (the end was scrawny) but still not <br/>

tell Mack, the lovely black lab). Ours is at my feet as I type. He&#39;s my<br/>
family&#39;s third heeler (one was red) and was a rescue dog who was returned<br/>
from an unsuccessful adoption where the people apparently beat the crap<br/>
out of him for 2 weeks, and he did some fear-biting for a while, but not<br/>
for months now... and he&#39;s the sweetest dog. He was spending hours with<br/>
my mom on the bathroom floor a few months ago during her radiation<br/>
treatments, just being there with her. <br/>

<br/>
My next question will sound a bit off tangent, but do you thwart yourself<br/>
often by not doing what you&#39;d love to do?  And... why would you do that,<br/>
thwart yourself I mean?<br/>
<br/>
Life is struggle enough without creating a struggle over learning.  This is<br/>
not to say that sometimes what we want to learn and do will require us to<br/>
work hard and even tussle with concepts or skills, but that&#39;s not quite the<br/>
same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Tell us more about your child, her likes and dislikes and maybe we can help<br/>
you see from a different perspective.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-552926616">Welcome, Leslie,<br/>
I believe Sandra directed you to unschooling.com and I can only agree<br/>
with her and encourage you to read as much as you can about unschooling. <br/>
The term unschooler may not be perfect but the IDEA is magnificent.  John<br/>
Holt, if you&#39;ve never read him, would be one place to start.  <br/>
There are a lot of wise and experienced voices here to support you.  And<br/>
I agree, I also listen to the wise voice of my son, age nine, going on<br/>
infinity.<br/>
<br/>
Did you post a question about dissension among the ranks?  Never fear. <br/>
It hasn&#39;t come to blows yet, and can be a very interesting personality<br/>
study. ( for personal, internal review only)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What does being unschooled mean to this teen? The way you say &quot;wants to<br/>
be unschooled&quot; sounds awkward to me, like you (or this teen) is expecting<br/>
unschooling to be a discrete thing, like from 9-12 every day he&#39;ll<br/>
unschool. It doesn&#39;t work that way....<br/>
<br/>
And what exactly do you mean by &quot;college-bound&quot;? Has this teen always<br/>
just planned to go to college? Does he have a specific time and place to<br/>
go picked out? *Why* does he want to go to college?<br/>
<br/>
I sort of envision my kid becoming interested in things like algebra and<br/>
geometry at around 12, since that seems to be a pattern among girls we&#39;ve<br/>
known who are sort of like her, who have spent the time up until then<br/>
without doing any formal studies of mathematics but grove on stuff like<br/>
logic problems and Martin Gardner and all that. At that point, I figure<br/>
I&#39;ll help her find some algebra or geometry resources and see what she<br/>
likes (I personally would love to get back into Algebra and geometry, and<br/>
then try to go further... I&#39;m trying to find very cheap Harold Jacobs<br/>
texts, because I&#39;ve looked through them and enjoyed them).<br/>
<br/>
Of course, that would be math for the sake of math. If she still wants to<br/>
go to Stanford in 10 years (right now she wants to go because they were<br/>
all nice to her at the Battle of the Bands, and she really likes the<br/>
tree) but somehow hasn&#39;t enjoyed the resources we&#39;ve found and hasn&#39;t<br/>
learned a lot from them, at least hasn&#39;t learned enough to get into<br/>
Stanford, then I imagine we&#39;ll have to find other resources... my job<br/>
would be  buying or borrowing stuff and asking my friends for advice on<br/>
resources, together we would figure out exactly what math she needed to<br/>
know to go to Stanford, and she would then learn it in whatever way she<br/>
decided was best.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, she might decide to be a band groupie and not go to Stanford,<br/>
or anywhere else, and then she can go the rest of her life without<br/>
learning any formal &quot;higher&quot; math... although we&#39;ve been playing Bazaar a<br/>
lot, and that&#39;s algebra, but she doesn&#39;t know.....<br/>

being made. You use two randomly selected cards for each game, and they<br/>
each have 6 or 7 different equations of jewels, like two red jewels (and<br/>
they show pictures of two red jewels for this) = a blue, a white, and a<br/>
yellow jewel.  That&#39;s the exchange system part. Then there are also<br/>
smaller cards that you &quot;buy&quot;, each of which has a combination of 5 jewels<br/>
on it, like two blues and 3 greens. On your turn, you can either roll the<br/>
die, which has all five jewel colors on it and a star (wild), or you can<br/>
make one exchange, based on the equations, Exchanges can be made forwards<br/>
or backwards, you can trade, say, a green and get 3 blues, or trade 3<br/>
blues and get a green. At the end of your turn, if you want, you can buy<br/>
a small card if you have the right jewels, and after you buy, you get<br/>
points according to how many jewels you have left in your hand - the<br/>
fewer you have left, the more points. <br/>
