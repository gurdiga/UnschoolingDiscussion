Oh, I was just saying that I was looking forward to my next catalog. I get it <br/>
regularly. Carly dd, trying to be helpful, decided to throw the glut of <br/>
overflowing catalogs into the recycle bin. There went my King Arthur&#39;s <br/>
cataIog. Now I&#39;m just waiting for the fall edition. <br/>
My brother asked me what I wanted for my birthday. A gift certificate from <br/>
King Arthur&#39;s would suit me fine. All that wonderful bread baking that we can <br/>
do.<br/>
Hope you enjoy the return to the oasis,<br/>
Ginny<br/>
