<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088611484"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; ADD with Hyperactivity (must meet six of the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This list sounds so much like school. My boys all walk around the table when I am reading to them, can not do math without foot tapping, singing, humming, the hate taking turns and waiting in line (doesn&#39;t everyone?) That list sounds like most children I know. Those are things children do. They are not robots.  This ADD and label thing is crazy. I too have one child who is especially spirited. The book suggested earlier, Raising Your Spirited Child. <br/>
<br/>
I do have a child with &quot;severe disabilities&quot; due to Cerebral Palsy. We don&#39;t call him cp child. We call him by his name. He has special needs, just like all my kids. They all have different and special needs because they are all unique individuals. They all have &quot;IEP&#39;s&quot; (Individual Education Plan), what ever they want to do is the plan. Elliot is 12 and needs assistance with most everything, dressing, teeth brushing, feeding, diapers, does not write (uses a computer), can not &quot;get&quot; math but is fine on calculator. But my other kids need special help in other areas. I don&#39;t understand why it is important to label. <br/>
<br/>
I went to a Parent Support Group Meeting (for the first and last time) a few months ago and the parents introduced themselves to me as; Chad&#39;s mom, he has __________. That is how it went all around the table. When it got to me I named myself, then said I had four children, stated ALL of their names and they all said, &quot;they are all special needs&quot;. Well, yea, but not in the way they were thinking. It was too weird for words. <br/>
