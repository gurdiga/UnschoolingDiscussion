My 14 year old has an explosive type of personality, too. He is 5&#39;4&quot; and<br/>
150 lbs. He is wide shouldered and very strong. Built like a bull. He<br/>
gets frustrated very easily. He has been labeled dyslexic and bipolar. I<br/>
know I struggle with these labels. I just wonder sometimes...:) It&#39;s<br/>
hard to be a teenager no matter what year we are in. There are so many<br/>
up&#39;s and down&#39;s. He was &quot;tortured&quot; for the nine years he was in public<br/>
school. What a farce that was... Last night he swore at me at Costco&#39;s<br/>
in front of a crowd using the &quot;f&quot; word about 6 times. He walked out of<br/>
the place. It was over a game I couldn&#39;t afford. Everything was fine an<br/>
hour later. I know he still isn&#39;t used to the idea of unschooling. He<br/>
doesn&#39;t understand the &quot;unrules&quot; since he has had so very many adults in<br/>
his life - actual teams of adults - giving him rules upon rules. The<br/>
tension in our house has gone down 80% since we began unschooling. We<br/>
are on our 12th hour of Oregon Trail here today. He is READING on his<br/>
own and they said he COULDN&#39;T. I am not saying much to him except to<br/>
help him out with one or two &quot;big&quot; words and say &quot;isn&#39;t this great!&quot; He<br/>
is off all med&#39;s. Lost 16 pounds. It&#39; s been a very short time since we<br/>
began this new journey in our lives. I know it is only going to get<br/>
better! Michele<br/>
