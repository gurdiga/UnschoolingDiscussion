<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597950091">Why is Santa better than Christmas trees or candy or costumes?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been thinking lately. Of course this comes after I already <br/>
had my daughter believing in Santa Claus. She loves fantasy and is always to <br/>
blur the boundaries between reality and fantasy but she likes to know the <br/>
boundaries first. I&#39;m feeling pretty guilty that I&#39;ve constructed this false <br/>
character for my daughter. It doesn&#39;t mesh with the honesty and trust that are part <br/>
of unschooling for me. <br/>
So a question...I would like the Santa thing to end with Cahterine and not <br/>
have Harry believing it as well. Has anyone else dug themselves out of the Santa <br/>
mess after their child already believed? <br/>
I know this will confirm with my relatives that I&#39;m a hippie freak and with <br/>
my in-laws that I&#39;m out to spoil all the fun but I&#39;m finally getting to the <br/>
point where their opinions don&#39;t mean diddly where it runs counter to my <br/>
daughter&#39;s interests.<br/>
<br/>
********************************<br/>
Well, we love Santa, and Julian believed, at least a little, until he was 11. <br/>
He&#39;d certainly been exposed to questions, but he let go when he wanted to. I <br/>
consider that one of the greatest gifts we&#39;ve had with unschooling... no <br/>
pressure to let go before he wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fantasy, and play, and magic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-452518028">We went back and forth on this issue for a few years.  We weren&#39;t going <br/>
to &quot;lie&quot; to our kids, then we were leaning toward Waldorf homeschooling <br/>
and then we thought that the fantasy was a great idea and enriching and <br/>
all that, then we weren&#39;t doing Waldorf and weren&#39;t sure about Santa, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, we haven&#39;t told our kids that there is or isn&#39;t a Santa.... <br/>
they just picked it up from cousins and friends and decided that there <br/>
is indeed a Santa Claus.  DS asked me last year who Santa Claus is and <br/>
I said &quot;Me!!&quot;  He thought that was hilarious and doesn&#39;t believe me for <br/>
a second so that&#39;s the fun we&#39;re having with it and I&#39;m not planning to <br/>
change anything.  He&#39;s happy believing in the magic of the holiday and <br/>
Santa and he thinks it&#39;s hilarious that I think *I&#39;m* Santa.  And I&#39;m <br/>
happy that he&#39;s happy!  LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-248938436">My son believes in Santa and fairies, gnomes, elves, dragons etc.  It <br/>
makes his life magical and mine too to be honest.  I love putting <br/>
honey out for the fairies and looking for gnomes in the woods.  Yule <br/>
is such a fun time for us making presents for Santa and leaving him <br/>
cookies and milk.  Whom am I to say these things don&#39;t exist?  I <br/>
believe in fairies and gnomes, so why not the other things.  I don&#39;t <br/>
see it as lying to my son, because I can&#39;t say with certainty that <br/>
these things don&#39;t or have never existed.  There are Santa like <br/>
constructs in many cultures, so maybe there is some truth to it.  My <br/>
son knows about all the different Santas, and his favorite is a <br/>
wizard type one that wears a dark blue coat with stars on it.  I <br/>
forget what culture it came from right now.  We have many different <br/>
types of Santas we put out that time of year.<br/>
<br/>
I never plan on telling him that Santa doesn&#39;t exist, so I haven&#39;t <br/>
been lying to him.  He may decide at some point that he doesn&#39;t <br/>
believe anymore, but that doesn&#39;t mean his is right.  He may decide <br/>
to believe his whole life and keep the magic alive.<br/>
<br/>
Just my take on it,<br/>

I&#39;m with you on this &quot;I do believe in fairies!  I do believe in fairies!  I do believe in fairies!&quot; (clapping the whole time :) Santa too.  I agree there are many things out there that are &quot;unexplained&quot; but I truly believe exist.  It&#39;s hard for me to imagine this is the one and only reality.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m constantly surprised, as a long time secular humanist, how much I DO <br/>
believe.  My first instinct about things like fairies is to say, &quot;No, of <br/>
course not, it&#39;s just an archetype for....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then, if I really think about it, and I really look at how I&#39;m reacting to <br/>
it and most importantly, what I won&#39;t do--I find I really do believe.  It&#39;s <br/>
those lines I WON&#39;T cross that really inform me.  Odd, huh?<br/>
