&lt;&lt;&quot;It will often take a parent willing to make a few promises and guarntees<br/>
before opportunities come open.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Would you   expand on this?  I&#39;m interested in how to go about creating<br/>
community opportunities for my son.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, most people seem to feel teens are a big risk.  They are <br/>
regarded as irresponsible, lazy, and apathetic; or resentful, angry, and <br/>
violent.  Given the conditions in which most teens are held, those <br/>
descriptions can, in fact, be accurate!  It&#39;s a sad commentary on our society <br/>
that the potentially most energetic, creative, committed, and hopeful portion <br/>
of our population ends up being viewed, and feeling, so negatively.  <br/>
Editorializing aside, though, we need to be willing to understand and accept <br/>
that most people are coming from a place of fear when dealing with teens.<br/>
<br/>
I found there was a little resistance to my younger son being a volunteer in <br/>
charge of the data base he rebuilt.  I think the people in charge were <br/>
concerned he would work on it for a bit, then quit, because to be honest, the <br/>
job was boring!  But they were desperate--they were in charge of a rapidly <br/>
expanding (exploding :) training program and *had* to have a way to keep the <br/>
data base current, and my son was the only option for them.  No adult, after <br/>
months of asking, advertising, and begging, was willing to take it on.  So <br/>
they agreed, and ended up getting much more than they expected.<br/>
<br/>
My role was in identifying the need, realizing my son could fill that need, <br/>
convincing (nagging :) my son until he was willing to take a shot at it, and <br/>
convincing (promising) the staff he would deliver.  I had the advantage of <br/>
having been known to these people for quite a while.  If I had been a total <br/>
stranger, I&#39;m not sure they would have accepted my son, no matter what their <br/>
need, because of the negative stereotypes we carry about teens.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you have an activity in mind for your child, but early efforts have <br/>
failed because the people in charge of that activity don&#39;t want to &#39;risk&#39; <br/>
using a teen, you can realize what is behind that refusal, and work to show <br/>
that your child comes with guarantees :)  You can document other programs the <br/>
child has worked with, for example, showing your child was prompt, courteous, <br/>
respectful, would follow through, etc.  Ask adults who have been impressed by <br/>
your child for reference letters, for example.  Or you can be known for your <br/>
own positive attributes, and open the door to your child that way.  Either <br/>
way, understand that people have that negative concept of teens, and don&#39;t <br/>
try to change it for teens in general, just your kids in particular.  Show <br/>
you, and your teens or kids, are worthy of trust, and the rest will follow.  <br/>
The nicest part about it is knowing you&#39;re helping in a small way to <br/>
permanently change our culture&#39;s view of teens in general :)<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, neither I nor my son ever thought of him as being the leader he <br/>
turned out to be.  We thought he would do the computer thing, and leave it at <br/>
that.  But pretty soon he was helping out with other jobs, small ones at <br/>
first, like stapling and labeling newsletters, while he waited for me to come <br/>
pick him up.  Then he was troubleshooting the rest of the computers in the <br/>
building.  Then he was answering questions for visitors when they stopped by <br/>
when the paid staff were out.  Then he was answering the phone, and pretty <br/>
soon they asked him to be a Trainer himself, in that pilot program.  OK, so <br/>
I&#39;m still bragging :)  But the point is, neither of us thought of him as more <br/>
than a computer guy--I won&#39;t say &#39;geek&#39;, though if he had been in school, he <br/>
would have been stereotyped like that.  But when he had the opportunity to <br/>
show his initiative, the rest followed naturally, even though in a direction <br/>
we never anticipated.<br/>

Many thanks for the answer.  Just what I wanted!<br/>
<br/>
As my son is 11, I haven&#39;t had experience with how people treat teens.  I<br/>
do know that many use different standards for kids than for adults.<br/>
