<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076024680">Andy Holly, I hear what you are saying about being artistic.  I never took<br/>
an art class, I wish I had those experiences you had articstically.  I went<br/>
another route, I went into teaching and from high school latin I went off<br/>
course into bilingual education.  Somewhere I took a very wrong career turn.<br/>
<br/>
My latest obsessive thought is getting my two son&#39;s writing or even drawing,<br/>
they dont. THey like computer games, and other items.  At least the eldest<br/>
likes to read Emily rodda and is most happy in his own cavie world.<br/>
<br/>
Someday I will share our tale of how we came to homeschool.  But in another<br/>
town, I probably would be a school teacher.  I have no qualms on my choices<br/>
and in fact I still teach.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you want to do the &#39;art thing&#39; do it.  I want to too but I am<br/>
more of a craftsy person anyway.  My one criticism about teaching here  In<br/>
Austin and texas in general, is that the &#39;system&#39; is taking all of the<br/>
creative portion from teaching.  I can&#39;t be a part of that system.  I prefer<br/>
to create and journey on this off road path.  I find serendipity in our<br/>
artistic journey of unschooling. Every conversation every topic between my<br/>
kids and I are artistic in nature.  Diplomacy is always a theme around here<br/>
and it takes work to be artistic it would be oh so easy to be banal and<br/>
simple.  well hasta luigi, monica</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-953741136">i guess my general answer (not that one is needed) to this is yes and no...<br/>
<br/>
i think i am finally to the place that the idea of selling art, selling something that i created, doesn&#39;t make me feel like i would be selling my arm or my child.  it used to be completely incomprehensible to me that people were really capable of selling their art.  kwim?<br/>
<br/>
art had become a sensitive subject to me.  i had a horrendous art teacher in high school that put down everything i did and made her mistakes and others my fault.  or at least made me believe they were.  <br/>
<br/>
i used to believe i was an artist.  i used to be a practicing artist.<br/>
<br/>
now, i haven&#39;t done artistic things in so long that i don&#39;t feel i should call myself an artist.<br/>
<br/>
i need to get back to the point where i believe that i am an artist.  that anyone is capable of art. that everyone has an artist inside them.<br/>
<br/>
then, i need to just start doing art.  as much as possible.  i need to find my flow and believe i am an artist.<br/>
<br/>
maybe several years down the road after this i will have the opportunity to sell some of my art, maybe not.  i certainly wouldn&#39;t mind being able to support my family through art<br/>
<br/>
part of  what is holding me back is the awful memories of that teacher and because art is so personal for me i worry about putting myself out there and being vulnerable - which i need to do.<br/>
<br/>
finally, the other thing holding me back is guilt.  the only other thing i have ever really wanted to do with my life is be a wife/mother.  so i worry about taking time and money away from my family to be creative and artistic.  i know that i need to spend time just for me so i don&#39;t lose myself, but i feel guilty about it and that blocks creativity too.<br/>
<br/>
hope that makes at least a little sense.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  i too dream of being an artist, but fear no one will care or want<br/>
<br/>
my art.  and i fear that i will let other people opinions about my very<br/>
<br/>
personal art affect how i do art. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When you do something so passionately that you don&#39;t care if others care, or <br/>
want it I think what is likely to happen is that you will infuse the work and <br/>
the air around it with that thing that people do care about and want.<br/>
<br/>
The statement above sounds like you were thinking you want to make a living <br/>
as an artist.    That&#39;s not the same as BEING (in your being, in your soul, in <br/>
your actions, in your priorities) an artist.<br/>
<br/>
A mundane and unrelated parallel:<br/>
Kirby is 17, works at a gaming shop, and when August comes he will have <br/>
worked there for four solid years.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has a friend who has said he really wanted to work there, would like to <br/>
work there, has applied, but isn&#39;t hired.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby used to volunteer to help there, when he was 12 and 13.  He would pick <br/>
up chairs at the end of the day, offer to vacuum, help fold calendars for <br/>
mailing, run errands.   Kirby loved the shop and was helping because he wanted to <br/>
be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
His friend declared flatly in a large group of people (I was there) that they <br/>
were asking for volunteers for a tournament, but he wasn&#39;t going to work for <br/>
them for free.<br/>
<br/>
Marty has worked many of those tournaments.  They give him store credit and <br/>
he gets cards for games he plays.    Marty was offered a job, but turned it <br/>
down.  He didn&#39;t want to work where Kirby works.  (Makes sense.)  Meanwhile, the <br/>
other guy who claims to want to do that refuses to actually DO it unless he&#39;s <br/>
paid.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something about peace, contentment and commitment that&#39;s alluring, <br/>
and it can be apparent in art and music and food prep and bedmaking and, I <br/>
guess, game-store customer service.<br/>

for me to call myself a writer, even though I was writing every day! <br/>
That schoolish notion of having to prove something is worthy kept re-<br/>
asserting itself in my head, and this was after I had been <br/>
unschooling for several years. It&#39;s amazing how long it takes to get <br/>
rid of some of those old tapes in our heads, isn&#39;t it?? I still find <br/>
it hard to call myself a photographer, because I have never published <br/>
any of my photography (well, except the April issue of Home-Ed <br/>
magazine, I guess now I am published). But photography is one of my <br/>
biggest passions, and I am nothing if not a photographer! <br/>
I think this one of the worst things that school does to people, it <br/>
makes them feel like something needs to be seen and approved of by <br/>
some &quot;higher authority&quot; before it is valid. As if no one had ever <br/>
seen Michelangelo&#39;s work or read Shakespeare&#39;s plays they would be <br/>
any less brilliant.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; then, i need to just start doing art.  as much as possible.  i need <br/>
&gt;to find my flow and believe i am an artist.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is one of the hardest things I&#39;ve tried to do as a mom. Finding <br/>
flow amid the chaos of parenting young kids is certainly a challenge.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; part of  what is holding me back is the awful memories of that <br/>

&gt;myself out there and being vulnerable - which i need to do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found it really helpful to read the writings of artists, poets, <br/>
and writers about their art and about how vulnerable they feel about <br/>
it (even people we take for granted as being at the top of their <br/>
field). When you read these famous people&#39;s feelings of insecurity <br/>
about their art, I think it makes it easier to see that there is no <br/>
real line between &quot;real&quot; artists or writers and &quot;amateurs&quot;. We&#39;re all <br/>
just people, creating from our hearts, and it&#39;s always difficult to <br/>
show that heart to the rest of the world.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; finally, the other thing holding me back is guilt.  the only other <br/>
&gt;thing i have ever really wanted to do with my life is be a <br/>
&gt;wife/mother.  so i worry about taking time and money away from my <br/>
&gt;family to be creative and artistic.  i know that i need to spend <br/>
&gt;time just for me so i don&#39;t lose myself, but i feel guilty about it <br/>
&gt;and that blocks creativity too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I try not to look at it as taking something away from my family when <br/>
I pursue my own goals. In many ways, it adds to the family to have a <br/>
person following their passions. The kids get to see that the love of <br/>
learning and creation don&#39;t stop when you reach adulthood, and they <br/>
get introduced to different worlds that they might not otherwise <br/>
know - worlds of galleries and paint shops, or worlds of writer&#39;s <br/>
groups or poetry readings. Also, most of the time if I&#39;m off writing, <br/>
my husband is getting to spend one-on-one time with the kids. Since <br/>
he&#39;s as much of an unschooling parent as I am, it makes sense that he <br/>
also would get to share in their day, their journey. He brings things <br/>
to their relationship that I don&#39;t, and vice versa. He is more likely <br/>
to do things like throw them on the bed and wrestle around with them, <br/>
and he&#39;s a whiz at baking chocolate chip cookies. I&#39;m more likely to <br/>
read books with them, work in the garden together, or go for a bike <br/>
ride. It does them good to have more than one parent&#39;s <br/>
talents/abilities/interests in their unschooling lives.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, taking time out to follow one&#39;s own passions can be taken <br/>
to an unhealthy extreme. Finding the balancing point is the tough <br/>
part, but I think when you do find that part, it enhances the family <br/>
and the unschooling journey of all.<br/>

I&#39;ve started thinking &quot;I&#39;m a philosopher.&quot;<br/>
Most of what I&#39;ve done for the past 25 years has been to help people (in the <br/>
SCA, in recovery groups, in LLL, here) figure out what they believe and why, <br/>
and how what they believe plays out in their real lives.<br/>
<br/>

or if they had done that work and not been discovered until after they died, <br/>

Cameron was actually TOLD that! That *really* great artists never get paid,  <br/>
