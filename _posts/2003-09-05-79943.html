<div id="ygrps-yiv-168131183">**I asked my daughter about this and she said that the people who go <br/>
there complained about the NC-17-rated stories so that is why they got <br/>
rid of them.  She said she never saw any ones rated X (never saw them...**<br/>
<br/>
NC-17 and X are equivalent.  I used the more attention grabbing term <br/>
first so people would notice, but old stuff on FanFiction.net that was <br/>
very explicit was labled &quot;NC-17&quot;, not literally labled &quot;X-rated&quot;.    I <br/>
just don&#39;t think that the meaning of the term NC-17 jumps out at people <br/>
in a recognizable way.  It&#39;s literally the same as X, but has a blander <br/>
connotation.  Sorry if it was confusing.  I wanted everyone to be aware <br/>
that many of the FanFiction.net authors are adults, even in some of the <br/>
more childlike topic areas, e.g. Harry Potter fic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308517645">This is an IM between my daughter (15) and myself, followed by email she sent me - about fan fiction.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Don&#39;t laugh - yes we were IMing from different rooms in the same house - we do it all the time.)<br/>

PSoroosh (10:38:07 AM): how much X-rated type of stuff do you run into on fanfiction.net?<br/>
PSoroosh (10:38:19 AM): people on unschooling discussion are warning other parents about it.<br/>
HarlequinPhantom (10:38:21 AM): Basically none, since the new policy...<br/>
PSoroosh (10:38:27 AM): how about before the new policy?<br/>
PSoroosh (10:38:29 AM): a lot?<br/>
PSoroosh (10:38:50 AM): and - is there still stuff left there since the new policy? Do you run into ANY?<br/>
HarlequinPhantom (10:38:52 AM): They used to allow nc-17 fics, but now nothing over R. And before that, most people /did/ categorize their fics properly...<br/>
HarlequinPhantom (10:39:05 AM): Occasionally someone will post some lemon under &#39;G&#39;. But it&#39;s rare and it&#39;s really obvious from the start.<br/>
PSoroosh (10:39:09 AM): how much should parents of, say, 10 yo&#39;s, be worried?<br/>
HarlequinPhantom (10:39:12 AM): Nah.<br/>
PSoroosh (10:39:29 AM): well - you&#39;re on the list, temporarily, want to post about it firsthand?<br/>
PS! oroosh (10:39:38 AM): or I should pass along your experience?<br/>
HarlequinPhantom (10:39:45 AM): Lemons rated G are so badly written anyway (people writing highly rated stuff that&#39;s well-written ALWAYS post them correctly) that most people don&#39;t bother reading them very far in. *g*<br/>
HarlequinPhantom (10:39:48 AM): Go ahead..<br/>
PSoroosh (10:40:18 AM): is nc-17 same as X?<br/>
HarlequinPhantom (10:40:20 AM): I don&#39;t read on ff.net much anymore anyway, it&#39;s not selective enough, and there&#39;s far too much drivel. <br/>
PSoroosh (10:40:26 AM): or are there two different levels?<br/>
HarlequinPhantom (10:40:28 AM): Yeah, basically.<br/>
PSoroosh (10:40:32 AM): okay<br/>
PSoroosh (10:40:34 AM): what do you read?<br/>
PSoroosh (10:40:43 AM): anything else to suggest?<br/>
HarlequinPhantom (10:40:47 AM): I love sugarquills.net for Harry Potter fics...<br/>
HarlequinPhantom (10:41:21 AM): fictionpress.net, ff.n&#39;s sister site for original works, has some good stories - MUCH harder to write a decent origi! nal story than fanfic, so there&#39;s a higher percentage of g ood fics vs. bad.<br/>
PSoroosh (10:41:40 AM): can you send me an email with this info?<br/>
HarlequinPhantom (10:41:48 AM): For other HP, and also Cats and the other few fandoms I read fics of, I usually have one or two fansites I browse. I don&#39;t read fanfiction much anymore, mostly just write.<br/>
HarlequinPhantom (10:41:51 AM): Sure...jas.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://go.to/godawful">http://go.to/godawful</a> is a fun site for reading good writers/editors&#39; takes on really bad fics...<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.subreality.com/movieverse.htm">http://www.subreality.com/movieverse.htm</a> is a superb X-men fanfic archive. LOADs of fics, good layout, v. navigable and fastloading. Easy to read format is also a plus.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/xmenmoviefanfic/index2.html">http://www.geocities.com/xmenmoviefanfic/index2.html</a> the previous one&#39;s sister site, I believe.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sugarquills.net">http://www.sugarquills.net</a> SugarQuills is a great place to find quality Harry Potter fiction, because, unlike ff.n, they have a selection process, so not every fic gets in. Still, not every single fic is top-of-the-line, but there is some  really good stuff here, and you don&#39;t have to sort through the piles and piles of rubbish you get on ff.n.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sekaiseifuku.net/puppyfarm.html">http://sekaiseifuku.net/puppyfarm.html</a> Has a few nice fics, but they&#39;re ALL Sirius/Remus slash, not an archive, a personal site, so if you&#39;re not into S/R, then... ;) If you /are/, or are willing to suspend disbelief, they&#39;re VERY well-written.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://azkabanslair.slashcity.org/">http://azkabanslair.slashcity.org/</a> I haven&#39;t browsed Azkaban&#39;s Lair much, so I don&#39;t know everything about it, but it has at least a few good stories, and it&#39;s selective, like Sugar Quills. I think Azkaban&#39;s Lair is solely, or at least primarily, S/R slash.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.catsfanfiction.ipfox.com/">http://www.catsfanfiction.ipfox.com/</a> Cats fanfics, it seems to be down right now, but it&#39;s REALLY good when it&#39;s up. VERY beautiful layout, great stories. I have a couple posted here. ^_~<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.catsfanfiction.com/">http://www.catsfanfiction.com/</a> &lt;-- Very much the same as the one above it, but not as many fics. I haven&#39;t seen it up in ages, so I&#39;m guessing the downtime is permanent...<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I used to have a TON of Cats links, but I&#39;ve lost all but a couple, and none of them are fanfics except my own - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kalliroscope.net/9lives/">http://www.kalliroscope.net/9lives/</a> &lt;-- shameless plug there, but I like to think that some of my fics (about 95% of the fics on Nine Lives are by me) are pretty good...<br/>
 <br/>
Googling for fanfiction + whatever fandom you&#39;re into usually works quite well. Also, there&#39;re LOADS of webrings dedicated to fanfiction.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-243189396">That exchange between Pam and her daughter was like reading a conversation <br/>
between Landon and I.  And, it reminded me of something I failed to mention when <br/>
I posted about Fanfiction.. ( and the explicit material)   Landon reads FF <br/>
from all over the net, not just on THE ff website.   He is subbed to several <br/>
email lists for FF writers.   So, my report of  &quot;adult&quot; type FF was really <br/>
indicative of the whole Internet.. lol... not just the FF website.    <br/>
