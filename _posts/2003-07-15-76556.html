  Trevor (6 in September) has developed an interest in werewolves, King Kong, <br/>

My boys all loved Godzilla movies.  They are cheap and easy to find.   There <br/>
is a whole genre called &#39;Kaiju&quot; that includes all Japenese monster stuff.  <br/>

<br/>
Being just fresh from a session of reading The Old Schoolhouse magazine and <br/>
looking through their website, that question was really jarring for me!!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah!  I&#39;m back in unschooler-territory!<br/>
<br/>
The first things that flashed through my head was what the fundamentalist <br/>
Christians who write for The Old Schoolhouse would have said about a child&#39;s <br/>
[sinful] desire to know about werewolves and dinosaurs.<br/>
<br/>
But speaking of scary things, there is an interview with Patrick Farenga in <br/>
this new issue of The Old Schoolhouse.<br/>
<br/>
Remember the discussion here a month or two back, after Day spoke in Florida <br/>
and someone expressed dismay that she didn&#39;t seem too dedicated to unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
According to this article, all their kids have been in school and out, and as <br/>
of that writing, only the 16 year old (eldest) was home.   He said the <br/>
youngest will probably stay home too next year.  He said the main reason was that he <br/>
and his wife had to work full time after GWS closed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to be here with &quot;practicing unschoolers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The quote used for decoration and allure in another article in that issue is <br/>
this, and makes me afraid to even begin to read the whole article:<br/>
<br/>
The article&#39;s name is &quot;Running From the Chisel&quot; and the quote is:<br/>
&quot;God help me, I do not like to stretch.  I want to be comfortable.  But <br/>
truthfully, even more, I don&#39;t want to be a whiney brat. . . God help me to be a <br/>
young David rather than a spoiled bratty mother raising spoiled bratty royalty.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I like being around people who believe in being kind to their children.<br/>
<br/>
THANKS to this list!!<br/>

<br/>
Godzilla!   The old ones.  Lots of building stomping, train crunching,<br/>
jet swatting, etc.  Great for little kids!<br/>
Some Godzilla titles:<br/>
<br/>
Godzilla King of the Monsters<br/>
Godzilla Raids Again (subtitled)<br/>
King Kong vs. Godzilla<br/>
Godzilla vs. Mothra<br/>
Ghidora the Three Headed Monster<br/>
Godzilla vs. Monster Zero<br/>
Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster<br/>
Godzilla&#39;s Revenge<br/>
Son of Godzilla<br/>
Godzilla vs. Megalon<br/>
Destroy All Monsters!<br/>
Godzilla vs. Mecha Godzilla<br/>
Terror of Mecha Godzilla<br/>
Godzilla 1985<br/>
Godzilla vs. Biolante<br/>
Godzilla vs. King Ghidora<br/>
Godzilla vs. Mecha Godzilla 2<br/>
Godzilla vs. Space Godzilla<br/>
Godzilla vs. Destoroyah  ( Godzilla has a yucky death at the end of this<br/>
one, might be upsetting to small people who really love Godzilla.  It&#39;s<br/>
kinda melty and gross, says Dylan)<br/>
Godzilla vs. Gigan<br/>
Godzilla 2000<br/>
<br/>
Some other good monster movies:<br/>
<br/>
Gorgo<br/>
Reptillicus<br/>
Twenty Million Miles to Earth<br/>
The Beast From Twenty Thousand Fathoms<br/>
Reptillian (newer)<br/>
Creature from the Black Lagoon<br/>
It Came From Beneath the Sea<br/>
<br/>
If you like cheesey B movies: (and who doesn&#39;t?&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Monster From the Ocean Floor  <br/>
Attack of the Crab Monsters<br/>
<br/>
(We have more titles if you need to know them, but these are two of our<br/>
favorites)<br/>
<br/>
A good old Silent movie is Nosferatu.  It&#39;s a vampire movie directed by<br/>
F.W. Murnau and it&#39;s available at Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots more according to Dylan but that should get you started.<br/>

B&W movies with bad special effects, like King Kong.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to buy her The Blob, but was told it&#39;s OUT OF PRINT!!!!  yikes.  How <br/>

quite often have monsters.  Although, there might be<br/>
