&lt;&lt; The whole AP thing would be a lot easier if you lived with an extended <br/>
 family and could, for example, take a bath or prepare a meal and know that <br/>
 other adults or older cousins or whatever were in the other room with your <br/>
 kids. Or, that your kids had playmates their age so that it wasn&#39;t all up to <br/>
 you.<br/>

Good point.  However, it would not be to my benifit to live closer to my <br/>
family because they don&#39;t parent anywhere near the attachment style I use <br/>
with my children.  I have made a community of friends, who parent the same <br/>
style.  I have a sub-culture in my beliefs that offers me support on my worse <br/>
days and laugh with me on my best.  I, also, am a facilitator for Attachment <br/>
Parenting International and provide a meeting place for like minded parents, <br/>
so that they can start making up their own &quot;extended families&quot;.<br/>

&lt;&lt; it&#39;s true that in the past moms had <br/>
 their babies at their sides all the time and children grew up surrounded by <br/>
 loving family who were there for everything they needed, but that is way <br/>
 different from mom at home all day with the kids, isolated in some bedroom <br/>
 community or exurban homestead, dad off at a distant job, coming home late <br/>
 and tired, and trustworthy family members hundreds or thousands of miles <br/>
 away. &gt;&gt;<br/>

This is one of the reasons dh and I moved back to Arizona so that kids could <br/>
grow up around one set of grandparents... Recently my brother and his fiancee <br/>
moved here from Canada as well so now we really do have extended family and <br/>
even though we&#39;d love to move somewhere cooler, like Colorado or Northern <br/>
California and up that coast, it&#39;s not such a good idea.  Mum spends a lot of <br/>
time with Zak and Max and it&#39;s good for them and for me.  Recently my brother <br/>
and f started babysitting so we could go out and the kids loved it.  They got <br/>
new playmates (so much for problems with socialization as my friends who <br/>
don&#39;t believe in homeschooling will tell me about).<br/>

<br/>
I think for me that I don&#39;t need my parents to be the same as Steve and I <br/>
because they are not my kids parents, they are their grandparents.  I have <br/>
watched my mum talk to my son about where she grew up and about how she went <br/>
on a train (Zak&#39;s passion at the moment) when she was 5 years old into the <br/>
country where she&#39;d never been.  (She was talking about being evacuated <br/>
during the second world war)..  She obviously didn&#39;t use those words, but Zak <br/>
asked her questions about why she had to live away from her parents and what <br/>
was war.  She used to rock him to sleep when he was 2 and sing &quot;The White <br/>
Cliffs of Dover&quot; by Vera Lynn... She made him a tape of Vera Lynn songs and <br/>
that&#39;s from nearly 60 years ago. Zachary knows all the words to many second <br/>
world war songs (I didn&#39;t know them until we got the tape).<br/>
<br/>
My mum&#39;s not a paragon of virtue, but what she brings to Zak&#39;s childhood is a <br/>
part of my history and past as well and Zak cannot get that from people we&#39;ve <br/>
just met, as lovely and wonderful as a lot of those people are.<br/>
<br/>
I also feel safe leaving my kids with her.  She wouldn&#39;t abuse them in any <br/>
way and for me that&#39;s worth a lot, even living in this horrible hot desert <br/>
for the next 7 years (dad retires and they may move to somewhere cooler, in <br/>
which case we&#39;re out of here)...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t always get along with my mother, and I&#39;ve had to learn to set a lot <br/>
of boundaries with my family and explain to them the way we are raising our <br/>
children, and mostly they have respected that, whether they&#39;ve agreed with it <br/>
or not.  On the whole this has been a massive learning experience for my own <br/>
psychological growth and a journey I don&#39;t think I would have missed.<br/>

Yeah...finally someone has the courage to say what I&#39;ve been thinking for <br/>
years!  I thought this when I read Jean Liedloff&#39;s Continuum Concept <br/>
also...that the tribe make-up and communal living situations was just so <br/>
different from what most of us live in that it&#39;s very difficult to do the <br/>
same kind of parenting amid our situation of other parent working far away <br/>
and long hours, extended family living miles away, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think that even several years ago in our country we had more of this sense <br/>
of community.  I know that when I grew up in a small town 30 plus years ago, <br/>
kids were allowed much more freedom to &quot;run&quot; because there was always someone <br/>
around looking out for them.  I don&#39;t see that as much anymore.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s difficult to find that sense of community for our families.  Or am I <br/>
just looking in the wrong places??<br/>
