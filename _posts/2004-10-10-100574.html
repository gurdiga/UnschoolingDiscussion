&lt;&lt; What can we suggest to people who might move towards unschooling that <br/>
<br/>
will help them bypass fear or transcend it or dismiss it?  (Or vaporize <br/>
<br/>
it with laughter like a bogart in the Harry Potter books.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re several layers from mainstream, so that&#39;s a lot of fear to laugh away.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve wished for years there were some way to screen out people who just <br/>
aren&#39;t going to overcome fear, or be creative or flexible enough to unschool.   <br/>
Because the people who get angry at the advice seem often to be saying that the <br/>
wish the advice had never been there.  Yet for every one of them there are five <br/>
or ten who are THRILLED that the ideas were available, and who are able to <br/>
see and try them right away.<br/>
<br/>
-=-(Maybe this is too hypothetical, since I&#39;m not really talking about a <br/>
<br/>
specific person.)-=-<br/>
<br/>
But if there are even groups or types of people to whom participants here <br/>
have seen it apply it&#39;s still personal experience.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Desensitisation and experience are starting points to deal with fear of <br/>
<br/>
the unknown, I think. -=-<br/>
<br/>
When people remember their own childhood experiences in light of the idea <br/>
that maybe it COULD have been different, and then they gather experiences with <br/>
their children, then they have something to laugh the bogarts away with.  Before <br/>
that, they would be faking it.   Pretending to laugh at a monster is probably <br/>
scarier than just being quietly and privately scared.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m getting tired of being quietly and privately scared while putting<br/>
on a big, fake smile to the world about our homeschooling. I&#39;m deeply<br/>
afraid. I don&#39;t tell anyone we&#39;re unschooling. I&#39;m terrified of the<br/>
anger that runs in me--anger at myself, my past, a few judgemental<br/>
people around us, Tyler who is becoming a teenager. I&#39;m shaking in my<br/>
shoes because of the fight that is so often between the two of us.<br/>
<br/>
We have a lot of deschooling to do as he spent 6 yrs in the system. I<br/>
read the posts on this list and am always encouraged to continue to<br/>
look into my own past, to look at my habits, to work on changing them<br/>
with healthier, more respectful ones.<br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s a sneer in my voice too often. Too many times I have to go<br/>
back and apologize and try to say it another way. Too many days I feel<br/>
thwarted and put out and unheard and so afraid that I&#39;m making a huge<br/>
mistake with him, that everyone who keeps telling me that he needs<br/>
structure and a rigid routine or he&#39;ll get lost is right. That my<br/>
instincts to protect his creative spirit is off-base and taking him<br/>
out of school is going to ruin his chances of any kind of a productive<br/>
future.<br/>
<br/>
So I keep coming back to this list, and I keep talking to other<br/>
unschoolers who remind me that they once felt the way that I<br/>
feel--lost and unqualified--while completely accountable.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve realized this week that part of my anger is jealousy. What an<br/>
ugly thing to see inside of myself. To know that I feel envious of my<br/>
son&#39;s opportunity to pull out of a system that was teaching him to be<br/>
a static person--the system that taught me the same thing. I have this<br/>
frozen inaction problem, and it was building in him. I have years and<br/>
years of training to break through and he might actually have a chance<br/>
to find his voice and his song.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ll work on that again today, on turning the envy into gratitude.<br/>
Gratitude for the chance to help clear the way as much as I can.<br/>
Gratitude for the daily lessons that parenting brings me, with this<br/>
whole new layer of unschooling that has been mining some very old<br/>
stuff out of me, bringing it all to the surface.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m definitely not laughing yet, but I am appreciating the joy and<br/>
whimsy I hear from so many people who are living the unschooling<br/>
life-it&#39;s a light at the end of this tunnel we&#39;re travelling in for<br/>
right now. Ocassionally that light reflects off of some small moment<br/>
in our day and we know that we can be part of it too. In the meantime,<br/>
I&#39;m trying to find the courage to continue looking at all of the<br/>
things that are in the shadows.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-809913344">Kelly, good for you! I&#39;m impressed with your introspection and honesty. Good things are <br/>
right ahead... and here now!<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is 17 and I have similar anxieties at times. He is working at Starbucks, plays <br/>
Magic, the Gathering and War Hammer, and sees friends. He spends time online and <br/>
watches movies. He reads. He acts.<br/>
<br/>
But he isn&#39;t &quot;preparing for college&quot; and he isn&#39;t clear on what he wants to do next year. <br/>
There are days when I feel so great about his being home and other days I hope we&#39;ve <br/>
made the right choice.<br/>
<br/>
When I hear that voice inside, I remind myself that the other choice was so much worse <br/>
and that&#39;s why we are here today. And I look at him. He&#39;s happier each day.<br/>
<br/>
But my biggest encouragement I wanted to give you is to let go of feeling ***sooo*** <br/>
responsible. You can support and create space for kids to grow and learn. You can&#39;t &quot;make <br/>
them&quot; learn, you can&#39;t &quot;force them&quot; to become a certain kind of person. In short, you aren&#39;t <br/>
&quot;responsible.&quot; You are behaving in a responsible way, however, when you honor who your <br/>
child is first.<br/>
<br/>
A wise friend and counselor once told me &quot;The only thing you can give your kids is your <br/>
love.&quot; This comment came in the context of my feeling I had damaged my kids when I left <br/>
the Christian faith as we had understood it. I worried that I wasn&#39;t passing on what they <br/>
needed for their futures. I worried that I wasn&#39;t &quot;giving&quot; them enough.<br/>
<br/>
His comment that the only thing we can give is our love stopped me cold. I was at the time <br/>
an overachieving homeschooler. Love. Love - I could do that. I could speak nicely, I could <br/>
pitch in, I could listen to his detailed explanations of how to play a game I don&#39;t like or <br/>
understand, I could watch a movie and talk about it afterwards, I could show interest, I <br/>
could fold his laundry when it finished before he noticed, I could buy him a hamburger <br/>
when we go out... None of these had to do with ensuring his future success as an adult...<br/>
<br/>
Love.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling has given me more space to love my kids. Do I believe that it&#39;s enough?<br/>
<br/>
I do.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe you are feeling that your parents wouldn&#39;t have exerted themselves <br/>
this much to meet your needs?  That could be a really painful feeling.  <br/>
(For me when I&#39;m touchy and angry there is often pain hidden underneath <br/>
that I&#39;m trying to ignore.)<br/>
<br/>
**I have this frozen inaction problem, and it was building in him.**<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean.  My husband was telling me that he was warning his <br/>
students about this feeling of &quot;learned helplessness&quot;.  He gave them the <br/>
example that an elephant that is &quot;trained&quot; on a heavy chain when young <br/>
can be controlled with a very light rope when older because it has <br/>
completely given up pulling against it.<br/>
<br/>
** So I&#39;ll work on that again today, on turning the envy into gratitude.**<br/>
<br/>
Gratitude is SUCH a positive force.  I just wanted to warn you that your <br/>
son is probably not mature enough at this stage to express gratitude, at <br/>
least not with any consistency.  So he may not be at the same place you <br/>
are emotionally.  (Although I&#39;d guess he may sometimes get swamped by <br/>
the same sense of fear that rises up to attack you.)<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Completely accountable&quot;?<br/>
If your relatives (or whoever the few judgmental people around you are) keep <br/>
on a steady  harangue, are you accountable for the damage that does?  I don&#39;t <br/>
think so.<br/>
<br/>
Are parents whose kids are in school &quot;completely accountable&quot; for all the <br/>
damage inflicted by kids at school and teachers at school and school itself?  Do <br/>
the parents get full credit if at school the kid thrives and has a teacher who <br/>
really changes his life and a rich friend who takes him to live in Europe?  <br/>
Who (besides maybe a few  who know there was an option) blames the parent if <br/>
school is awful for a kid?<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of parts of lives that parents can take no direct credit or <br/>
blame for.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I have this frozen inaction problem, and it was building in him. -=-<br/>
<br/>
*Maybe* (not probably, but slightly-possibly) it&#39;s a genetic thing and it <br/>
would have built in him anyway.  Kirby procrastinates the same way I do.  The <br/>
other kids are more like their dad in that.   I went to school and Kirby never <br/>
did, so it can&#39;t have been school.  (I didn&#39;t procrastinate about school stuff <br/>
as much, though I was a night-before paper-writer, but I was never a <br/>
three-days-later paper writer.)<br/>
<br/>
-=I have years and<br/>

<br/>
Of training to do things?<br/>
What training, and trained by whom?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;ve realized this week that part of my anger is jealousy. What an<br/>
ugly thing to see inside of myself. To know that I feel envious of my<br/>
son&#39;s opportunity -=-<br/>
<br/>
I used to see the jealousy in my husband.  I had been through a lot of Adult <br/>
Children (of Alcoholics, in my case, but other Adult Children programs and <br/>
co-dependency groups will help in the same way) meetings and activities and <br/>
readings and discussions and self-examination by the time homeschooling was a <br/>
possibility and a factor here, and that helped EXTREMELY.  I had already examined <br/>
the whats and why&#39;s of my childhood, and imagined better options, and forgiven <br/>
my mom quite a bit, and resolved to use that as a way to make decisions with <br/>
my own kids.   One of the biggest resolutions in all that was not to have a <br/>
kneejerk &quot;NO&quot; when answering children&#39;s questions.  If &quot;Yes&quot; is a possibility,&quot; <br/>
why slam a &quot;NO&quot; in a child&#39;s face?   And because a lot of that &quot;yes&quot; led to <br/>
some of the sweetest moments in my life to date, I was reinforced in the idea <br/>
that being a generous and gentle mom was good for the children and good for the <br/>
peace and joy of the family, but it was also good for the mom.   When I was <br/>
generous and gentle, it made me a more generous and gentle person, right then and <br/>
there.    I had the right and ability (and even experience) to be a &quot;NO WAY&quot; <br/>
person, or &quot;Don&#39;t even think about it&quot; mom.  But that would have made me harsh <br/>
and harder right on the spot.   It would have wounded my children&#39;s souls and <br/>
selves every single time.<br/>
<br/>
-=-it&#39;s a light at the end of this tunnel we&#39;re travelling in for<br/>
right now. Ocassionally that light reflects off of some small moment<br/>
in our day and we know that we can be part of it too. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can think of it as under a thick shade instead of a tunnel.  A <br/>
tunnel sounds scary and dangerous and of a fixed length.   Maybe you can come up <br/>
with some reflectors or flashlights at least. &lt;bwg&gt;  I&#39;m serious, though.  If <br/>
you make an image, you can make a friendlier, airier, lighter, safer image.  <br/>
Maybe you can be in a forest with limited visibility and no direct sunlight but <br/>
you KNOW the light is up there because the trees are alive and you KNOW it <br/>
needs to rain sometimes, but that&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
-=-In the meantime,<br/>
I&#39;m trying to find the courage to continue looking at all of the<br/>
thingthat are in the<br/>
Z shadows.-=-<br/>
<br/>
One thing I remember well from the time I was turning over all the damp rocks <br/>
in my own early childhood memories was that I would think of a specific <br/>
moment when I was afraid or sad, and I would remember as well as I could what had <br/>
contributed.  How had my mom been?  Drunk?  Self-involved and jealous herself <br/>
of my opportunities?  Resentful of being stuck with me?  And I would imagine <br/>
what she might have done just a LITTLE big better in that moment.  And gradually <br/>
I would imagine what it might have been like if she had been wiser and more <br/>
generous and less wounded herself.<br/>
<br/>
So on my own parenting checklist, into my toolbox (or toolbox wishlist) went <br/>
be sober<br/>
pay attention to the kids<br/>
rejoice in their joys<br/>
realize I had choices and I chose to have children and I chose to stay home<br/>
appreciate the opportunity I had to be with them<br/>
appreciate the fact that I was fertile (other friends were sad to be <br/>
childliess)<br/>
appreciate the fact that they were born alive<br/>
appreciate the fact that they were healthy <br/>
appreciate that they were verbal and curious<br/>
and just generally try to appreciate every smile, every joke and every moment.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Unschooling has given me more space to love my kids. Do I believe that <br/>
it&#39;s enough?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Years ago I was at a conference and near the end of it there was a panel:  <br/>
David and Mickie Colfax  (of Homeschooling for Excellence) and Dr. Raymond and <br/>
Dorothy Moore were there and I don&#39;t remember if there were others.  For the <br/>
moment that struck me, there were no others involved (and those may have been <br/>
the only ones).   <br/>
<br/>
One of them, answering a question from the audience, said &quot;Some homeschoolers <br/>
say all you have to do is love your kids.&quot;  There was a pause while they <br/>
looked at each other, rolled their eyes, shook their heads and all kind of snorted <br/>
and chuckled.  The eye contact I remember was Mrs. Colfax and Dr. Moore.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t make me doubt myself.  That was good.<br/>
<br/>
They went on to say once your kids were old enough you needed to make them <br/>
work, and do lots of hard work.   That love wasn&#39;t it.<br/>
<br/>
As part of really loving my kids, I give them breaks and I give them <br/>
opportunities and I help them do hard things they want to do and I don&#39;t force them to <br/>
do many things they don&#39;t want to do.  Holly changed her mind about the <br/>
dentist the other day after she pressed me to make her an emergency appointment.  I <br/>
persuaded her to just buck up and go.  Holly got whiney and resistant about <br/>
going up the tram to the crest with her grandfather and uncle and dad the other <br/>
day, after she had insisted that was the main thing she wanted to do while <br/>
they were there.  I didn&#39;t say, &quot;OK, no problem.&quot;   I said &quot;There&#39;s snow up <br/>
there, come on I&#39;ll help you get ready.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When she was warmly (and cutely) dressed, she felt better about going. It was <br/>
the quick preparation that dismayed her.  They decided kind of suddenly to go <br/>
NOW, so they could see the sunset from up there.<br/>
<br/>
She had a great time.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll remember that after her grandfather&#39;s dead, and that&#39;s not a <br/>
consideration she could think of herself, but her dad and I have grandfather memories <br/>
(some good and some regrets) so we pressed her in a kindly way for her own <br/>
good.  Neither of us will remember it long, but she will.<br/>
<br/>
If love isn&#39;t the most important or only thing, I do think it is a crucial <br/>
hinge on which every other decision depends.<br/>

&gt; Maybe you are feeling that your parents wouldn&#39;t have exerted themselves<br/>
&gt; this much to meet your needs?  That could be a really painful feeling.<br/>
&gt; (For me when I&#39;m touchy and angry there is often pain hidden underneath<br/>
&gt; that I&#39;m trying to ignore.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes! Exactly! This is an issue I&#39;ve been working with myself most of<br/>
my adult life, but I apparently haven&#39;t finished the work!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; **I have this frozen inaction problem, and it was building in him.**<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know what you mean.  My husband was telling me that he was warning his<br/>
&gt; students about this feeling of &quot;learned helplessness&quot;.  He gave them the<br/>
&gt; example that an elephant that is &quot;trained&quot; on a heavy chain when young<br/>
&gt; can be controlled with a very light rope when older because it has<br/>
&gt; completely given up pulling against it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Learned Helplessness. Yes. That&#39;s it exactly. It has taken so much<br/>
effort to get through that wall when I want to accomplish anything.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; ** So I&#39;ll work on that again today, on turning the envy into gratitude.**<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Gratitude is SUCH a positive force.  I just wanted to warn you that your<br/>
&gt; son is probably not mature enough at this stage to express gratitude, at<br/>
&gt; least not with any consistency.  So he may not be at the same place you<br/>
&gt; are emotionally.  (Although I&#39;d guess he may sometimes get swamped by<br/>
&gt; the same sense of fear that rises up to attack you.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Indeed, he&#39;s not there. I recognize that this part of it is my<br/>
journey, not his. Sure, he&#39;ll see me changing and growing, that will<br/>
effect him in some way, but it&#39;s mine. Hopefully it will help to<br/>
lessen the tide of fear that swamps us both!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Betsy!<br/>

&gt; shoes because of the fight that is so often between the two of us.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is it about learning and his future?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. About him getting the support and encouragement that he needs<br/>
from outside of our tiny family as well so that he can have the<br/>
freedom and the strength to do whatever it is that he is led to do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; About his place in your family?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well. Sort of. He&#39;s the first grandchild and great-grandchild. Because<br/>
of his interests (fantasy/gaming/cartooning) he&#39;s sort of been written<br/>
off by most of the family as being *creative* which isn&#39;t as valid to<br/>
most of them. He&#39;s also judged as being lost in his own world. But I<br/>
think he&#39;s created that world to have a place that felt good within<br/>
the world he&#39;s been stuck in. I know that I am a part of that<br/>
world-with the rules and regulations and judgements I carried. I have<br/>
dropped many of them (no sugar, no tv, monitored game and computer<br/>
time, bed time)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What other people are immediate factors?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>truthfully? nobody. Not daily anway. It&#39;s just me and him and his<br/>
step-dad who is very encouraging about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; =Too many days I feel<br/>
&gt; thwarted and put out and unheard and so afraid that I&#39;m making a huge<br/>
&gt; mistake with him, that everyone who keeps telling me that he needs<br/>
&gt; structure and a rigid routine or he&#39;ll get lost is right. =<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does he want more structure?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no. he wants even less, and we have almost none.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-I keep talking to other<br/>
&gt; unschoolers who remind me that they once felt the way that I<br/>
&gt; feel--lost and unqualified--while completely accountable.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Completely accountable&quot;?<br/>
&gt; If your relatives (or whoever the few judgmental people around you are) keep<br/>
&gt; on a steady  harangue, are you accountable for the damage that does?  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think so.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. I ruminated on that all morning. I have some very co-dependent<br/>
issues that I&#39;ve been working on for a while. I regretted using the<br/>
word, because I knew it would be a red flag. I&#39;m also glad I used it<br/>
because the responses have been so thoughtful and have pointed me<br/>
inward again. Never a bad thing.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=- I have this frozen inaction problem, and it was building in him. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *Maybe* (not probably, but slightly-possibly) it&#39;s a genetic thing and it<br/>
&gt; would have built in him anyway.  Kirby procrastinates the same way I do.  The<br/>
&gt; other kids are more like their dad in that.   I went to school and Kirby never<br/>
&gt; did, so it can&#39;t have been school.  (I didn&#39;t procrastinate about school stuff<br/>
&gt; as much, though I was a night-before paper-writer, but I was never a<br/>
&gt; three-days-later paper writer.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, yes. His father and I are both procrastinators in the extreme. I<br/>
guess I&#39;ve never thought of it as a genetic possibility, that it was a<br/>
learned behavior or habit. Hmmm. Well, I&#39;m still trying to be more<br/>
organized and responsible in my life, maybe that will rub off...maybe<br/>
it won&#39;t. The big thing I suppose is for me to let go of needing it to<br/>
be one way or the other. Right?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; -=I have years and<br/>
&gt; years of training to break through-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of training to do things?<br/>
&gt; What training, and trained by whom?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, well...training to wait and be quiet and be told what to do next<br/>
by whoever is in authority...training to have low expectations for<br/>
myself and from the world...training to underachieve.<br/>
<br/>
Dang. That made me sound like such a loser. I&#39;m not really as bad as<br/>
all that. I&#39;m actually a lot better than I was a decade ago. I&#39;m even<br/>
a lot better than I was a month ago! I could stand to focus on the<br/>
positive a little more.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-I&#39;ve realized this week that part of my anger is jealousy. What an<br/>
&gt; ugly thing to see inside of myself. To know that I feel envious of my<br/>
&gt; son&#39;s opportunity -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I used to see the jealousy in my husband.  I had been through a lot of Adult<br/>
&gt; Children (of Alcoholics, in my case, but other Adult Children programs and<br/>
&gt; co-dependency groups will help in the same way) meetings and activities and<br/>
&gt; readings and discussions and self-examination by the time homeschooling was a<br/>
&gt; possibility and a factor here, and that helped EXTREMELY.  I had already examined<br/>
&gt; the whats and why&#39;s of my childhood, and imagined better options, and forgiven<br/>
&gt; my mom quite a bit, and resolved to use that as a way to make decisions with<br/>
&gt; my own kids.   One of the biggest resolutions in all that was not to have a<br/>
&gt; kneejerk &quot;NO&quot; when answering children&#39;s questions.  If &quot;Yes&quot; is a possibility,&quot;<br/>
&gt; why slam a &quot;NO&quot; in a child&#39;s face?   And because a lot of that &quot;yes&quot; led to<br/>
&gt; some of the sweetest moments in my life to date, I was reinforced in the idea<br/>
&gt; that being a generous and gentle mom was good for the children and good for the<br/>
&gt; peace and joy of the family, but it was also good for the mom.   When I was<br/>
&gt; generous and gentle, it made me a more generous and gentle person, right then and<br/>
&gt; there.    I had the right and ability (and even experience) to be a &quot;NO WAY&quot;<br/>
&gt; person, or &quot;Don&#39;t even think about it&quot; mom.  But that would have made me harsh<br/>
&gt; and harder right on the spot.   It would have wounded my children&#39;s souls and<br/>
&gt; selves every single time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay. Yes. I can work with a statement like *Yes is a possibility*.<br/>
That is extremely helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m amazed that after a solid 15 years of working on myself and<br/>
letting go of the disappointment and unhappiness of my childhood, that<br/>
so many of these old things have risen up again. I should know better.<br/>
I know that our Self is like an onion with many layers of the same<br/>
thing. When we peel away a layer, we get to experience the sweetness<br/>
and freshness of that newfound freedom from the old outer layer, but<br/>
eventually the new layer will need to be peeled away...and so on.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-it&#39;s a light at the end of this tunnel we&#39;re travelling in for<br/>
&gt; right now. Ocassionally that light reflects off of some small moment<br/>
&gt; in our day and we know that we can be part of it too. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe you can think of it as under a thick shade instead of a tunnel.  A<br/>
&gt; tunnel sounds scary and dangerous and of a fixed length.   Maybe you can come up<br/>
&gt; with some reflectors or flashlights at least. &lt;bwg&gt;  I&#39;m serious, though.  If<br/>
&gt; you make an image, you can make a friendlier, airier, lighter, safer image.<br/>
&gt; Maybe you can be in a forest with limited visibility and no direct sunlight but<br/>
&gt; you KNOW the light is up there because the trees are alive and you KNOW it<br/>
&gt; needs to rain sometimes, but that&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. Thank you. This too, is very helpful. I do understand the power<br/>
of affirmation and visualizing. I hadn&#39;t even noticed the kinds of<br/>
imagery I have been using in my thinking and talking and writing.<br/>
<br/>
I feel so much better after this exchange. Thank you.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-In the meantime,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m trying to find the courage to continue looking at all of the<br/>
&gt; thingthat are in the<br/>
&gt; Z shadows.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One thing I remember well from the time I was turning over all the damp rocks<br/>
&gt; in my own early childhood memories was that I would think of a specific<br/>
&gt; moment when I was afraid or sad, and I would remember as well as I could what had<br/>
&gt; contributed.  How had my mom been?  Drunk?  Self-involved and jealous herself<br/>
&gt; of my opportunities?  Resentful of being stuck with me?  And I would imagine<br/>
&gt; what she might have done just a LITTLE big better in that moment.  And gradually<br/>
&gt; I would imagine what it might have been like if she had been wiser and more<br/>
&gt; generous and less wounded herself.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another very useful activity. I&#39;m going to play with this one in my<br/>
journal. I can think of several dozen moments right off the top of my<br/>
head. I can also see how those moments fuel my reactions with<br/>
situations with my children.<br/>
<br/>
Ok. This has been quite enlightening. I&#39;m going to go make some tea<br/>
and have the good cry that&#39;s been pushing at my head for the past half<br/>
hour.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
<br/>

my adult life, but I apparently haven&#39;t finished the work!**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not finished either, and I&#39;m 45!<br/>
<br/>
(from a second post -- same poster)<br/>
<br/>
** Well, yes. His father and I are both procrastinators in the extreme.**<br/>
<br/>
It seems like people might become serious procrastinators when there are <br/>
parents (or teachers) around that are severely judging the tasks being <br/>
done?  It seems to me that natural consequences are almost never as bad <br/>
as parental disapproval/ridicule consequences.  (I&#39;d make an exception <br/>
in what I said for drug abuse and reckless driving which do have <br/>
horrific natural consequences.) <br/>
<br/>
I was always a timid person, and when I was avoiding something my mom <br/>
would encourage me to consider &quot;what&#39;s the worst thing that could happen?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
**Well, I&#39;m still trying to be more<br/>
organized and responsible in my life, maybe that will rub off...maybe<br/>
it won&#39;t. The big thing I suppose is for me to let go of needing it to<br/>
be one way or the other. Right?**<br/>
<br/>
In the case of adult children of alcoholics there seems to be the <br/>
tendency to be either all falling apart, or very tightly held together.  <br/>
Trying to find a moderate way between the extremes isn&#39;t easy, but it <br/>
sounds like you are heading in that direction.<br/>
<br/>
** Oh, well...training to wait and be quiet and be told what to do next<br/>
by whoever is in authority...training to have low expectations for<br/>
myself and from the world...training to underachieve.**<br/>
<br/>
Training to be convenient for other people and to perform for them.  Right?<br/>
<br/>
I believe the public school system was not intended to educate future <br/>
leaders for this country, just future followers.  When you first become <br/>
aware of the amount of brainwashing in your early years of education, <br/>
it&#39;s pretty staggering.<br/>

we get less flack from others.<br/>

<br/>
But, I seriously (and I mean VERY seriously) think they are on the road <br/>
to a happy life - in fact, I think they&#39;re on the road to a creative, <br/>
artistic, beautiful, passionate life that has PLAY at its core. AND, <br/>
what&#39;s more, some of them will become doctors, lawyers, or engineers - <br/>
and they&#39;ll have a depth in their lives that most of their colleagues <br/>

<br/>
YES!<br/>
<br/>
I talked about this at the conference...and what inspired me was that a week before the conference we were at our river cabin and we were dead exhausted one night...heading to bed, and Jake asked, &quot;Mom, will you rub my back tonight?&quot;  I looked at him and I was DYING to get into my own bed and get to sleep, but I looked at my sweet child and the longing in his eyes and I knew my own sleep wouldn&#39;t be content if I said no, so I said, &quot;Yes.&quot;  And his entire *aura* changed...Then Sam asked, &quot;Will you rub MY back tonight?&quot;  &quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And it was from that moment that I came up with this for my talk:  &quot;When I use that shiny, glorious *yes* tool, I can see my children physically and emotionally relax into a place in their hearts where they feel incredibly loved, understood, respected and safe ~ the very definition of Joy.&quot;<br/>

&quot;Will you rub MY back tonight?&quot;  &quot;Yes.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Today Holly finally came out of her room at 1:30 in the afternoon.  For MANY <br/>
days she has either needed to get up early or her very loud uncle was here and <br/>
he got up at 7:00 and started talking every day, without regard to Holly <br/>
being in the living room because she had given her grandfather her bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
I had just finished my own lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Holly came in and said, &quot;Mom, will you please make my bed?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I took a breath and said &quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She lightened up as she stood there, like when a dog wags its tail.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And will you make me lunch?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I did, and she was soft and sweet and happy, and said, &quot;Will you brush my <br/>
hair?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She sometimes asks for one of those but all three in a short space was <br/>
unusual.    Marty and I are going out of town for three days soon, and I think she&#39;s <br/>
starting to feel it, and it&#39;s better for every single person involved if <br/>
she&#39;s not feeling needy or ignored.<br/>
<br/>
The other day I was hand-feeding one of her rats piñon nuts.  I bought them <br/>
from a roadside stand, roasted and shelled, and they were expensive--$8 for a 4 <br/>
ounces or so, but I&#39;ve roasted and shelled them (and picked them, a sappy, <br/>
sticky mess in the hot dirt), so it seemed worth it.   Her rat LOVED them, and I <br/>
kept giving her another.  She wasn&#39;t hiding them or saving them, she was <br/>
finishing them right up and reaching toward me for another with her nose.   Holly <br/>
was drawing at the table, and the rat was running around on the table, up on <br/>
Holly and back down.  I had been setting things out for her to climb in and <br/>
over, before I thought to offer her one of the precious local nuts.<br/>
<br/>
Holly talked about how efficiently they eat, without dropping a single bit.<br/>
<br/>
After about five, Holly said &quot;She doesn&#39;t need any more of those.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was an odd thing to say.  It sounded like her grandmother.  &quot;The kids <br/>
don&#39;t need to do [whatever].&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;That&#39;s okay, I&#39;m having fun and she likes them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But they&#39;re expensive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s okay.  She&#39;s not going to eat them all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And after ten or eleven, she was done.   She turned down the next one and <br/>
took off.  I left it lying there.  She came back later, sniffed it, but kept <br/>
playing.<br/>
<br/>
I talked a little about how rich MoonShine must feel, because she got as many <br/>
nuts as she wanted.   Even rats will choose to stop when they&#39;re full, if <br/>
they&#39;re living secure lives.   After she was full of nuts, climbing around on the <br/>
table became more important to her.<br/>

this wonderful freedom that he wishes he could have had (DS has <br/>
never been in school - he&#39;s 6). I told DH to start NOW doing the <br/>
things he wishes he could have done and to think of the opportunity <br/>

&gt; Training to be convenient for other people and to perform for them.  Right?<br/>

&gt; I believe the public school system was not intended to educate future<br/>
&gt; leaders for this country, just future followers.  When you first become<br/>
&gt; aware of the amount of brainwashing in your early years of education,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s pretty staggering.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What has been most staggering to me in the last month or so is how dep<br/>
the brainwashing went. I have read about unschooling for  7 or 8 years<br/>
now, and really tried to change my parenting with a lot of success.<br/>
When Tyler didn&#39;t return to school, I hit a layer of sludge that I<br/>
didn&#39;t even know existed. I thought I was ready for all of it, and<br/>
able to handle whatever he wanted to do or not do. But the not doing<br/>
anything schoolish or academic has triggered so much doubt.<br/>
<br/>
I will say, however, that the responses I&#39;ve received in this thread<br/>
have gone far in improving the quality of the week that Tyler and I<br/>
just spent together. It was mostly just amazing, with much quiet time,<br/>
a lot of running around together doing errands or helping my in-laws,<br/>
and CALM conversations. A lot less emotion. Emotional things talked<br/>
about with no drama. Just...good.<br/>

pulled a muscle in his back hefting buckets of cat litter into the<br/>
basement for his grandparents and was stretched out on the couch with<br/>
a sock full of warm buckwheat on his back. I sat down and he asked me<br/>
to put the sock in the microwave for a few minutes. I rolled my eyes<br/>
and said &quot;I just sat down.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
His face fell, and he started to roll off the couch to do it himself.<br/>
I jumped up and pushed him gently back and took the sock and told him<br/>
I&#39;d do it. He said never mind. I apologized and said that I wanted to<br/>
do it for him, that I knew his back was sore and that it would be nice<br/>
to do something to help him. He turned into this big mushy boy and we<br/>
spent the next hour giggling together.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the big example that sticks out, but I know it happened dozens<br/>
of times and it kept getting easier, and seeing him light up with<br/>
pleasure and with this small child cuddlyness where usually it&#39;s mean<br/>
mom and grumpy teen boy...I don&#39;t know. I just feel so...so sure that<br/>
I&#39;m on the right track.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-96892978">Yes, I think that&#39;s very true. I just need to find a way to speak with<br/>
people who are concerned and negative about it (like his father who<br/>
lives in another state and isn&#39;t really interested in reading anything<br/>
I send to him.)<br/>
<br/>
But I can&#39;t fix their relationship, or smooth the way for Tyler with<br/>
his dad. I can only listen and make suggestions if he wants them. It&#39;s<br/>
unfortunately breaking his kid&#39;s heart right now to have his dad<br/>
invalidating everything he is interested in learning about, telling<br/>
him that he should focus on academics and subjects, keep the other<br/>
stuff as hobby.<br/>

&gt; I wanted to highlight this statement because I think it is pretty<br/>
&gt; common. If we unschool and our kids are passionate about astronomy or<br/>
&gt; biology or math or engineering, they are somehow more &quot;impressive&quot; and<br/>
&gt; we get less flack from others.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Those &quot;artistic&quot; kids cause our extended families and friends to worry<br/>
&gt; more - because they don&#39;t look like they&#39;re on the road to becoming a<br/>
&gt; doctor, lawyer, or engineer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But, I seriously (and I mean VERY seriously) think they are on the road<br/>
&gt; to a happy life - in fact, I think they&#39;re on the road to a creative,<br/>
&gt; artistic, beautiful, passionate life that has PLAY at its core. AND,<br/>
&gt; what&#39;s more, some of them will become doctors, lawyers, or engineers -<br/>
&gt; and they&#39;ll have a depth in their lives that most of their colleagues<br/>
&gt; will not have.<br/>
