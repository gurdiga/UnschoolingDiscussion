<br/>
I have been observing this conversation on both lists for quite a while now.  I know I have never posted on this list, but I do post to RUL fairly often and I have been a lurker here for a while.  While I will not get into whether I agree or disagree with anyone here, including the folks you are talking about, I will say that coming back to this list every time they say something and reporting to people on it smacks of &quot;tattling.&quot;  So, in that way, their assessment is sadly closer to the truth than I would like to believe.  Not saying this is the case overall , just that what I see you doing here seems to be exacerbating the problem, much in the same way that you claim they are.  Why not just let it go?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I&#39;m glad someone let me know my integrity had been questioned.  I think that <br/>
sort of thing is worth reporting.<br/>
<br/>
This list was SEVERELY disrupted by two people, one of whom wouldn&#39;t ever <br/>
tell us if she was homeschooling, and one of whom was NOT homeschooling (still <br/>
isn&#39;t yet).   That&#39;s not the way things should be.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think we need to discuss it here, but I don&#39;t think telling Tia not <br/>
to discuss it comes under &quot;not discussing it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Two people made very much trouble her and are making false report elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile on THIS list, people had gotten back to talking about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Amy, tell us about unschooling, not about the other list, or about what Tia <br/>
should post, please pretty please.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955534688">Sandra, I could ask Tia to tell us about unschooling,  just as you told me to. What&#39;s the difference?    I&#39;m not sure I understand.  It&#39;s not like the subject was dropped and I brought it back up again.  I know what is happening on THIS list just as well as you do.  I&#39;m on it, too.   I was just suggesting what I thought might be a reason for some of the confusion going on.  And btw, it was Tia, not me, who was talking about the other list.  I only said I was on it.  Sorry if you disagree with what I&#39;ve said but honestly I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s ok for Tia to keep discussing this, but not ok for me to say something, especially since I am not posting over and over about this topic.  That said, I will not post about this ever again unless you or someone else directly responds to me and asks me something.  So trust me, I really wanna let it go<br/>
<br/>
I have only one child - a baby - 7 months old.  So we aren&#39;t exactly unschooling in the way that other folks discuss here.  But I do hope to do this.  And I do take into consideration what folks here have to say about how to interact with kids so that I can begin to work on it now before things get yucky.  This is one of the reasons I have not posted here about unschooling.  But I plan to do so in the future.  So thanks for the invitation.<br/>
