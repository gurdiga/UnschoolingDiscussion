Thanks!<br/>

My kids and husband went four different directions, a friend and I ate <br/>
chicken, corn on the cob, mashed potatoes and Dr Pepper, and watched <br/>
&quot;American Sweethearts.&quot;  (Oh, and reassured the dog that the fireworks noises <br/>
and stink weren&#39;t people coming to get us.  I always feel sorry for dogs on <br/>
fireworks days.)<br/>
