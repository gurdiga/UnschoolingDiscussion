<div id="ygrps-yiv-199409856">Michelle, you asked about some &quot;moon goo&quot;-- I don&#39;t know if this can help <br/>
you, but here is a recipe for &quot;silly stuff&quot; that your son can also help make <br/>
with you!                                                                       <br/>
                    Materials:  1c flour, 1/2 c salt, 2 TBsp veg. oil, 1 c <br/>
water, 2 tsp cream of tartar,  food coloring (optional), stove, pot, mixing <br/>
spoon, storage container                                                        <br/>
                                            Procedure:  1. Mix all <br/>
ingredients in pot. 2. Cook over med. heat, stirring until mixture sticks <br/>
together in a ball.  3.  Remove pot from heat, and let dough cool.  4.  <br/>
Squeeze and knead--have fun!  5.  Store in airtight container.                  <br/>
                                                                                <br/>
        Unlike some clays, this is a dough that stays soft.  My kids <br/>
thoroughly enjoy playing with this.  I have other recipes for diff. clays.  <br/>
If you or anyone else is interested,just let me know, and I&#39;ll be happy to <br/>
send them to you.                                                               <br/>
                                        Do you have access to a telescope?  <br/>
It is fascinating to look at the moon and to see the craters!  Also, because <br/>
my boys were recently space crazy, we glued paper plates to make ufo&#39;s, and <br/>
covered paper towel tubes with foil, rolled another paper into a cone, <br/>
attached it to one end, stuffed yellow tissue paper in the other end, and <br/>
created (in a quick matter) rockets.  Most of our crafts are completed in <br/>
short order since they are so excited to play with them!  Anyway, I hope you <br/>
both have a great time exploring the moon!                                      <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239420146">Hi, Michelle, the alien mom!<br/>
I too have very creative sorts around here. Fun but exhausting at times of <br/>
course! For a spaceship I would give Zain a big ole cardboard box and let him <br/>
decorate it, etc. I once gave my then-5 yo son some boxes to make a play <br/>
castle while i caught 40 winks with my then-newborn son and when i awoke <br/>
there was this enormous castle with turrets and doors! I was blown away! Now <br/>
if i had gotten too involved it would never have been as elaborate or as <br/>
creative b/c this particular son gets into power struggles with me very <br/>
easily. All he needed help with was opening the paints so he could paint it <br/>
all bright green! We saved that castle setup for at least 5 years. And it was <br/>
played with almost every day, whereas the same sort of cardboard castle <br/>
structure that we bought at a medieval festival last summer has yet to be <br/>
played with! Also my crowd likes to play spaceship every time they see a <br/>
laundry basket! They dump out the laundry (grrrr!) and jump inside and shout <br/>
blast off! sometimes the basket is upside down on top of them! But if i had <br/>
ever suggested this i am sure the game would never have been repeated! In our <br/>
house the bed is the moon, Michelle! Have fun!<br/>
