Here is a copy of the letter Kennedy Space Center sent out which includes a<br/>
link to their events page. I am pretty sure the homeschool day is only *one*<br/>
day, I believe it&#39;s towards the end of March. Let me know if you have any<br/>
trouble with the link.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Good morning:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am the Youth and Education Marketing Representative for Kennedy Space<br/>
&gt; Center Visitor Complex. I was surfing the web looking for Homeschooling<br/>
&gt; Publication and groups, and I came across your useful website! I would<br/>
&gt; like to speak to someone about how to make  our resources more<br/>
&gt; convenient for your Florida Homeschoolers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Under your regional field trip section, Kennedy Space Center is listed<br/>
&gt; as expensive and crowded. Is there any way to change that description? I<br/>
&gt; would like to highlight our educational value to both students and<br/>
&gt; educators.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We do have a Salute to Homeschoolers Day in March. Please see below for<br/>
&gt; details<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would appreciate some suggestions or advice on how to better reach<br/>
&gt; your members.  We have wonderful programs for performance groups, Scout<br/>
&gt; troops and student groups. Please check out our range of educational<br/>
&gt; programs at:<br/>

&gt; Thank you for your time and council.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most sincerely,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; In replying to her note to ask if she&#39;d like me to forward her inquiry<br/>
&gt; to the list, I also asked her if KSC could spare a representative for<br/>
&gt; LIFE Fest 2003. She replied that she would love to attend, so now we<br/>
&gt; will have KSC representation at LIFE Fest. (I&#39;ve also asked if they<br/>
&gt; would like to present a children&#39;s program.  I&#39;ll let you know what I<br/>
&gt; hear back.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In my brief chat with Ms. Hubscher, I said that, as far as I was<br/>
&gt; concerned, I enjoyed KSC, but was disappointed when they started<br/>
&gt; charging admission fees just to enter the grounds (they used to only<br/>
&gt; charge for the bus tours and films)and was unable to attend with the<br/>
&gt; frequency I had before the fees were instituted (when I lived in<br/>
&gt; Brevard).  I wondered if they would consider a periodic free or reduced<br/>
&gt; admission day for educators and this is what she wrote back:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***********************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What a helpful response! I would certainly like to volunteer to attend<br/>
&gt; the LIFE fest. I will bring over our Education Information and answer<br/>
&gt; any questions from the participants. This would be a great chance to<br/>
&gt; listen to comments and receive a different perspective directly from the<br/>
&gt; market. Thank you for the invitation!  What a coincidence in dates!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The charge for attendance is certainly a change from the open policy<br/>
&gt; from prior years, and local teachers have had a bit of a harder time<br/>
&gt; organizing and executing field trips. However, the increase in price was<br/>
&gt; necessary to bring in the new amazing exhibits, activities and<br/>
&gt; resources. See, KSCVC is not funded at all by  government money, and the<br/>
&gt; admission prices have allowed incredible improvements to the educators<br/>
&gt; experience! We are now, after these improvements, one of the top 5<br/>
&gt; attractions in Central Florida, and less expensive than our competition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will definitely keep the discounted admission day in mind. The Salute<br/>
&gt; to Homeschoolers Day does have a cost, but  lunch and specialized<br/>
&gt; activities are included to the participants.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please do post the question on the web-site. We are very interested in<br/>
&gt; becoming more involved with this dedicated group of educators, and any<br/>
&gt; feedback would certainly be  helpful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I look forward to accepting comments and suggestions, and I am happy to<br/>
&gt; be attending the LIFE Fest!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Talk to you soon,<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, if you have suggestions or comments for the Kennedy Space Center,<br/>
&gt; send them along.  You can send them right to Ms. Hubscher, but send them<br/>
&gt; to the list, too. Maybe we can compile them into a nice list of<br/>
&gt; suggestions complements of LIFE of Florida.  Anyway, it&#39;s nice to know<br/>
&gt; our opinion counts at KSC. :-)<br/>
