I know that the goal (and I applaud it) is to let unschooling.com&#39;s mailing<br/>
list be open and unfettered, but with messages like the one below directed<br/>
at Sandra Dodd, is there ANYTHING that can be done? Anything? The willful<br/>
disruption of an otherwise excellent mailing list is taking place.<br/>

Put up or shut up time, Sandra.  Either have your supposed sources stand up<br/>
and be counted or stuff your bs!  You are good at English, or so you say, so<br/>
you should know the definition of libel.  Also, just in case you didn&#39;t<br/>
know, being the promulgator of innuendos and gossip is actionable.<br/>
<br/>
I usually ignore you when you stoop yet once again to sophomoric behavior.<br/>
Lots of folks think you are a bag of hot air, posturing and strutting around<br/>
playing expert and that ignoring you would be the best way to deal with<br/>
someone with National Enquirer journalistic proclivities.  Twould appear<br/>
that they were wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Since you are now attacking others, I will be more than happy to send them<br/>
chapter and verse on where you are stepping over the legal line and how to<br/>
deal with you.  I hope we are real clear on this now.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, you are aware that there is medication for delusional behavior and<br/>
paranoia.</div>
