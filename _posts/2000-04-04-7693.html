&lt;&lt; Oh, the woes of an Ebay widow... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh boy, can I relate to that.  My DH spends eons just &quot;window-shopping&quot;  on <br/>
Ebay.  He collects and customizes action figures and buys/sells ALL THE TIME. <br/>
  We know the UPS man on a first name basis around here.  Drives me nuts, but <br/>
hey - could be worse.  There are definitely worse things for him to be <br/>
chasing than toys!  LOL<br/>
