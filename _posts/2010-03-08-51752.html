<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035574731">Great moments from the 2010 Oscars.<br/>
<br/>
Best Animated Movie winner Pete Docter (Up) saying, &quot;never did I dream making flip books out of my third grade math books would lead to this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Best Musical Score winner Michael Giacchino (Up):    &quot;I was nine and I asked my dad, &quot;Can I have your movie camera? That old, wind-up 8 millimeter camera that was in your drawer?&quot; And he goes, &quot;Sure, take it.&quot; And I took it and I started making movies with it and I started being as creative as I could, and never once in my life did my parents ever say, &quot;What you&#39;re doing is a waste of time.&quot; Never. And I grew up, I had teachers, I had colleagues, I had people that I worked with all through my life who always told me what you&#39;re doing is not a waste of time. So that was normal to me that it was OK to do that. I know there are kids out there that don&#39;t have that support system so if you&#39;re out there and you&#39;re listening, listen to me: If you want to be creative, get out there and do it. It&#39;s not a waste of time. Do it. OK? Thank you. Thank you.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I think there might be something very special about the working culture over at Pixar, the kind of people they attract.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-738938087">Not even necessarily &quot;supporting dreams,&quot; but supporting goofing around!<br/>
Or kids finding secondary value in math books (as bound pages  <br/>
animation could be created in) .&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was awesome.  I heard those comments, and Holly and Marty were in  <br/>
the room, and none of us even gave the other a meaningful glance,  <br/>
because they know those things and they know I know them.<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU, Robyn, for transcibing those.  I&#39;m going to put them  <br/>
somewhere,<br/>
probably at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/focus">http://sandradodd.com/focus</a><br/>
