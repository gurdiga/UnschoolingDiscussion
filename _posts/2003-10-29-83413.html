<div id="ygrps-yiv-395559782">&lt;&lt;Or maybe they should suffer the same consequences as adults&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have any of you seen the Kathy Bates movie &quot;A Home of Our Own&quot;?  True story<br/>
about a family working desperately to build a life for themselves and how<br/>
they come to work together.  Anyway, in the beginning, the mom is a beater,<br/>
smacking the oldest with a belt quite often.  Later in the movie, she is<br/>
beaten by a boyfriend and her son is helping her treat her wounds.  In a<br/>
heart wrenching scene, she tells the boy to never beat anyone, about how<br/>
much it hurts inside and out.  He says he knows.  Later that night, the kids<br/>
are awakened by the sound of the mom, bawling, nailing the belt to a tree.<br/>
It is the beginning of a new life for this family.  I loved the movie if you<br/>
can&#39;t tell.<br/>

Awesome movie! And if the kids had not gone to school then it would have been <br/>
the perfect unschooling movie. The one little boy eventually does so much <br/>
with hauling things from the junkyard to help furnish the home that he catches <br/>
the eye of the yard owner. In the end the whole town is better for knowing the <br/>
family. Great movie! I have a good hard bawl every time I see it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757016768">A Home of Our Own...I&#39;ll be looking for that one, for sure. We have a <br/>
credit at Blockbuster right now, and have been trying to think of <br/>
something really worth getting (because, to return it means another <br/>
trip to town...which we are trying to cut down on.)<br/>
<br/>
I like Kathy Bates, though, and it sounds like a goodun!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings, HeidiC <br/>
