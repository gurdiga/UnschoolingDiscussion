<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hi Joyce,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My name is Debbie Harbeson and I homeschooled/unschooled my two  <br/>
&gt; children through high school.  They are now college graduates and  <br/>
&gt; on their own doing very well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just recently quit a job (I�m doing freelance writing now) where  <br/>
&gt; I worked for 8 years teaching reading, spelling, comprehension and  <br/>
&gt; math in a private center. During this time, I had constant doubts  <br/>
&gt; and issues about reading and how one learns to read and if it  <br/>
&gt; really is natural, etc.  I always thought reading was a natural  <br/>
&gt; process but I learned a lot at this job that made me wonder whether  <br/>
&gt; or not I was right about that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just read some of your articles on your site, http:// <br/>
&gt; joyfullyrejoycing.com/ on reading and found them very interesting  <br/>
&gt; and hit upon a lot of things I have wondered about for the last 8  <br/>
&gt; years, taking into consideration my personal experience with my two  <br/>
&gt; kids and then with the many, many kids I taught at the center.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the back of my mind, I thought some of those kids I worked with  <br/>
&gt; might be fine and their only problem was that they were dealing  <br/>
&gt; with schools and their artificial guidelines about what needs to be  <br/>
&gt; taught when, etc.  Yet, I also became aware of some very  <br/>
&gt; interesting research into the brain and learned through teaching  <br/>
&gt; that there are indeed some differences with reading and it may not  <br/>
&gt; always be so natural for some kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Those in reading research point out that speech and language have  <br/>
&gt; been hard wired into us for extremely long evolutionary time but  <br/>
&gt; reading and spelling are quite young skills and so it�s not so easy  <br/>
&gt; to compare them with each other.  There are real man-made  <br/>
&gt; situations involved in decoding our language into symbols on a page  <br/>
&gt; and there do appear to be some people whose brains are not wired to  <br/>
&gt; make this an easy task.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For years, I have wished there could be some research done on  <br/>
&gt; unschoolers and their reading progress. I�d love to see if they  <br/>
&gt; start out with the same areas of the brain not quite wired up well  <br/>
&gt; and whether or not they connect naturally as they age.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What I think most unschoolers have as an advantage is families who  <br/>
&gt; make sure they learn whether or not they are reading, but there is  <br/>
&gt; also no doubt in my mind that someone who can read at a younger  <br/>
&gt; age, and enjoys it, can gain so much more information and knowledge  <br/>
&gt; and be far ahead of a counterpart who is not gaining that knowledge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don�t know if reading is inevitable, I�ve seen families where  <br/>
&gt; everyone loves to read and learned to read easily and then one  <br/>
&gt; child desperately wants to read to but doesn�t seem to be able to  <br/>
&gt; do so. Then we do work with them, primarily in the area of phonemic  <br/>
&gt; awareness and literally rewire their brain and they take off.  It�s  <br/>
&gt; amazing and if I had not been a part of it myself I would still  <br/>
&gt; think as you do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I�m not real sure why I�m writing except that I think it could be  <br/>
&gt; interesting to have a �conversation� about all of this. Do you have  <br/>
&gt; any research you can lead me to that would be helpful to me?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for listening. J<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And yet all the research is done on schooled kids. Researchers can&#39;t  <br/>
eliminate the effect of school on any aspect researchers examine in  <br/>
kids (or adults for that matter!) Science can&#39;t know what is natural  <br/>
for kids. They can only determine what is natural to schooled kids.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids with dyslexia do have a more difficult time decoding.  <br/>
There are a few extra steps they need to go through in order to read,  <br/>
but they do read.<br/>
<br/>
Does that mean everyone can read? So far it&#39;s not knowable. What we  <br/>
do know, though, is that there are unschooled kids who first make all  <br/>
the connections to read at much later ages than they are allowed to  <br/>
in school. And they are quickly reading at age level. *That* we do know.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Those in reading research point out that speech and language have  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s a reasonable line of thought about reading being  <br/>
relatively recent, but the written language wasn&#39;t dropped on  <br/>
humanity by some outside entity. It was developed from the human mind  <br/>
to be used by the human mind. It was shaped and molded by skills that  <br/>
were already naturally present. What wasn&#39;t easy and natural for the  <br/>
human mind to grasp would have been weeded out.<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible not everyone has a full set of those skills? I can  <br/>
only say that unschooled kids aren&#39;t leaving home without reading. Is  <br/>
it possible the kids who don&#39;t have a full set of skills are given up  <br/>
on and put in school or special programs to be taught to read? Of  <br/>
course that&#39;s possible. But just because it&#39;s possible, does it  <br/>
actually happen? That&#39;s the important question.<br/>
<br/>
But theories based on speculated data aren&#39;t going very far until the  <br/>
actual data shows up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For years, I have wished there could be some research done on  <br/>

&gt; and be far ahead of a counterpart who is not gaining that knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you look at the world through reading glasses, that&#39;s true ;-) We  <br/>
as a society are very reading-centric. We&#39;re familiar with the  <br/>
process of absorbing massive amounts of information through books. We  <br/>
can easily imagine information that would be very difficult to absorb  <br/>
any other way.<br/>
<br/>
But if society tomorrow dropped reading and turned to hands on  <br/>
learning or visual learning, we&#39;d be much better at seeing the ways  <br/>
reading is limited. That doesn&#39;t mean that books aren&#39;t best in some  <br/>
situations. But we&#39;ve put reading on such a pedestal that we elevate  <br/>
the skills we can learn through reading and look down on the skills  <br/>
we learn other ways.<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest limitation of information gathered through  <br/>
reading is that the reader experiences the connections made by and  <br/>
passed on by the writer. While we&#39;ll absorb some of those connections  <br/>
and we&#39;ll make some connections the writer may have missed, it&#39;s not  <br/>
how we&#39;re naturally hardwired to learn. We&#39;re hardwired to learn by  <br/>
pulling our own order from chaos, refining our understanding, testing  <br/>
it out, using it, refining it further. (How babies pull a mastery of  <br/>
language out of the chaos of noise interacting with and swirling  <br/>
around them.) We don&#39;t *naturally* learn by taking in chunks of other  <br/>
people&#39;s information. While some people seem to be able to learn that  <br/>
way, it isn&#39;t what&#39;s natural and it&#39;s very difficult for many people.<br/>
<br/>
 From the lowest organism that can learn from experience to the  <br/>
highest order organisms, we all learn by pulling order from chaos.  <br/>
It&#39;s how we evolved to learn. We can watch others and learn, but we  <br/>
don&#39;t truly learn until we&#39;re doing something for our own personally  <br/>
meaningful reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Learning Spanish from a book and an instructor will fail miserably  <br/>
for most people. And yet kids pick a language up effortlessly when  <br/>
immersed in it. (As do adults who trust the process.) Hair dressing.  <br/>
Swimming. Auto repair. Sewing. Skiing. Painting. Brain surgery.  <br/>
Rocket science. Pool playing. Horse racing.<br/>
<br/>
While reading could add to the knowledge, we&#39;re doing a disservice to  <br/>
other more natural ways of learning when we barely notice their  <br/>
contribution. Watching a video will also add knowledge. As does  <br/>
talking to people. Each has their strengths and can all enhance the  <br/>
learning. But where we build the foundation, though, is in hands on  <br/>
doing and trying and thinking and talking and redoing and so on.<br/>
<br/>
I think a big problem is that testing is easiest to do on knowledge  <br/>
gained through reading. It&#39;s hard to test how effectively people are  <br/>
building their own connections. But with reading, we can more easily  <br/>
design tests to show how much someone has absorbed of the (basically)  <br/>
predigested material.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make learning from reading superior? No, it makes learning  <br/>
from reading easily testable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don�t know if reading is inevitable, I�ve seen families where  <br/>
&gt; everyone loves to read and learned to read easily and then one  <br/>

&gt; amazing and if I had not been a part of it myself I would still  <br/>
&gt; think as you do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At what age is it decided -- by the children or others -- that these  <br/>
children you work with can&#39;t read? What pressures do the children  <br/>
feel about reading? No matter how gentle the school program, once a  <br/>
child is getting close to 4th grade they can&#39;t miss the messages that  <br/>
they aren&#39;t doing what *seemingly* everyone else can.<br/>
<br/>
(Yes, an occasional unschooled child can have a passion to read  <br/>
before they&#39;re ready. It&#39;s not all school created. But some kids have  <br/>
a passion to ride a bike before they&#39;re ready. As far as I know, the  <br/>
kids whose mothers spoke up and asked about how to help their  <br/>
children, have all had their kids read when the kids were ready. It  <br/>
was frustratingly not when the kids wanted to be ready, but they did  <br/>
read.)<br/>
<br/>
My husband at 49 is learning to swim. While he had lessons as a  <br/>
child, things that other kids were picking up from play and  <br/>
instruction and trying things out and watching others, didn&#39;t make  <br/>
the right kind of connections for him. He didn&#39;t learn how to stroke  <br/>
and breath. He picked up a bad set of skills. Now he&#39;s rewiring his  <br/>
brain. (I on the other hand, had no lessons and can stroke and breath  <br/>
just fine from natural learning.)<br/>
<br/>
So, are the kids you&#39;re working with naturally wired poorly for  <br/>
reading, or was the unnatural process of learning to read in school  <br/>
forcing their brains to make wrong connections in order to perform in  <br/>
ways they couldn&#39;t yet do because their brains weren&#39;t ready?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, sorry, no research. It&#39;s theories and conclusions based on  <br/>
results that unschoolers see in their kids. The data sampled is  <br/>
obviously parent selected. If a parent doesn&#39;t trust a child can  <br/>
read, they&#39;re not going to stick with unschooling if a child reaches  <br/>
an age where the parent is certain the child won&#39;t read without  <br/>
instruction. Does that mean the child can&#39;t read on their own? No. It  <br/>
only means the parent decided the child couldn&#39;t. Does that mean the  <br/>
child could read on their own? We can&#39;t know. But what we do know --  <br/>
that later onset of reading is perfectly natural in humans --  <br/>
*suggests* that reading is natural for everyone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just happened upon one of Hayden&#39;s notebooks (& I got permission to<br/>
photograph it for my blog -- I&#39;ll post the link when it&#39;s done)... he was 3<br/>
& 4 during these writings (he is now 10): lists of movies, names, book<br/>
titles, even a contract for me to sign and a list I wrote of his favorite<br/>
Star Wars words.  He loved letters, the shape of them, the message of them,<br/>
the ART ;) He read his first book at 6.5; he quickly read his current<br/>
favorite games and his reading improvement has definitely followed the same<br/>
incline as his complexity of video game playing!  See:<br/>

He falls in and out of love with *people talking to him about reading,*<br/>
hence his above quoted &quot;I hate reading&quot; stage.<br/>
He likes me to read to him, because I read more quickly and I &quot;recognize<br/>
more words&quot; than he does.  When I&#39;m not there, he reads independently, just<br/>
fine.<br/>
He also types like crazy!! AND he keeps his fingers near the &quot;home&quot; keys,<br/>
without even knowing what that&#39;s called!<br/>
I think his spelling is amazing; first because of the years and years he<br/>
spent becoming familiar with words by copying them down in notebook after<br/>
notebook and second because I am always willing to spell for him whatever he<br/>
asks - he wants to communicate effectively and I&#39;m a ready resource to<br/>
facilitate that process.<br/>

comment on this before reading Joyce&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The second statement is well qualified with &quot;no doubt in my mind and  <br/>
&quot;can gain,&quot; so I can&#39;t dispute it.   The writer is sure one can gain  <br/>
more by reading than by not reading.<br/>
<br/>
I think in the 19th century that was true.  I think much of our  <br/>
educational system is based in the 19th century.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some families (not unschooling families) in which once a  <br/>
child learned to read, no one read to him anymore.  So a child who can  <br/>
read picture books but not Harry Potter is condemned to read &quot;easy  <br/>
books&quot; without many fun ideas, and some of them lose the desire to  <br/>
read because it was shown as something the parents aren&#39;t willing to  <br/>
do for fun, or because the easy books are more discouraging than  <br/>
encouraging sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
As to hardwiring, it&#39;s one of the things Howard Gardner has proposed  <br/>
with his theory of multiple intelligences<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/intelligences">http://sandradodd.com/intelligences</a><br/>
<br/>
If a person is not high on the verbal intelligence scale (if that&#39;s  <br/>
where reading lies), years of phonics lessons might make him LESS  <br/>
likely to pick up a book when he&#39;s old enough to have figured it out  <br/>
in his own way.   Years of being branded &quot;not a reader&quot; (whether in  <br/>
those words or just by living in remedial groups and having to take  <br/>
home &quot;bad report cards&quot;) has turned millions of happy, hopeful  young  <br/>
children into book-hating adults.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-129588201">When I went to put some of Joyce&#39;s response on my bookworship page, I  <br/>
found something that might help in this discussion:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When someone thinks books are the one crucial step to any further  <br/>
learning, then books and school have crippled that person&#39;s ability to  <br/>
think expansively, and to see what&#39;s unfolding in front of them in the  <br/>
real world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was me, in another discussion some years back.<br/>
<br/>
And that reminds me of something I pulled to use in a talk I&#39;m giving  <br/>
in Tempe, Arizona in March (plug for the HENA conference, a one-day  <br/>
conference on March7):<br/>
<br/>
****************************<br/>
Some people see experienced unschoolers (&quot;experienced&quot; meaning in this  <br/>
context people who have done it well and effortlessly for years, who  <br/>
aren&#39;t afraid anymore, who have seen inspiring results) mention  <br/>
classes, and they think &quot;Ah, well if the experienced unschoolers&#39; kids  <br/>
take classes, then classes are good/necessary/no problem.&quot;<br/>
But if beginners don&#39;t go through a phase in which they REALLY focus  <br/>
on seeing learning outside of academic formalities, they will not be  <br/>
able to see around academics. If you turn away from the academics and  <br/>
truly, really, calmly and fully believe that there is a world that  <br/>
doesn&#39;t revolve around or even require or even benefit from academic  <br/>
traditions, *then* after a while you can see academics (research into  <br/>
education, or classes, or college) from another perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Once there was heavy fog at our house. Kirby was four or five. He had  <br/>
never seen it at all, and this was as thick as I have ever seen fog.  <br/>
He wanted to go and touch it. I yelled &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot; and we ran up the  <br/>
road, and ran, and ran. About seven houses up we got tired, and I said  <br/>
&quot;Look&quot; and pointed back toward our house, which was gone in the fog.<br/>
<br/>
I did NOT say &quot;See? You can&#39;t touch it, really, it&#39;s touching us, it&#39;s  <br/>
all around us.&quot;<br/>
I didn&#39;t say &quot;Let&#39;s don&#39;t bother, it&#39;s just the same wherever in there  <br/>
you are.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I let him experience the fog. He learned by running in fog and  <br/>
smelling it, and losing his house in it.<br/>
<br/>
For someone who has been out of and away from school for six months to  <br/>
take a class will not be the same experience as someone (child or  <br/>
parent) who has been out and away for eight or ten years. It will be  <br/>
different in very, very profound ways. And &quot;profound&quot; doesn&#39;t show  <br/>
from the house. You have to run until you can&#39;t see the house, and  <br/>
then profundity kicks in.<br/>
<br/>
****************************<br/>
<br/>
Same with books.<br/>
<br/>
I love books.  That doesn&#39;t keep me from telling unschoolers that they  <br/>
need to learn to see learning outside of books.<br/>

a lot more valuable and relative information and knowledge than most of<br/>
her schooled peers reading and doing school stuff.  Being able to read<br/>
does not garauntee more information and knowledge gained!  I&#39;ve met<br/>
plenty of people that can read, but really don&#39;t think, have no desire<br/>
to gain knowledge , or gather information, kids and adults.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of being ahead and behind is another thing that should be<br/>
discarded.  Outside of the measurements of the school system, how can<br/>
anyone be ahead or behind?  How can someone be behind in their own<br/>
knowledge and exploration of the world?  It doesn&#39;t even make sense!  Am<br/>
I behind in my knowledge of cooking because I&#39;m not a chef?  Am I ahead<br/>
of that same chef because I can draw and the chef can&#39;t?<br/>

possible!  I can understand, in the given scenario, how a child in that<br/>
circumstance, not being able to read and people continuing to throw<br/>
things at the child, until something finally &quot;clicks&quot;.  Who&#39;s to say<br/>
that the child in question wouldn&#39;t eventually come to the same<br/>
connections if left in peace to discover it on their own, through their<br/>
own natural exploration?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps that child could&#39;ve watched the Electric Company more, or<br/>
whatever other shows on PBS that do that phonemic stuff.  Perhaps that<br/>
particular child, if left to discover reading in their own way, might<br/>
have naturally gravited towards this understanding of the written word. <br/>
I see my younger daughter doing this very thing, on her own accord. <br/>
It&#39;s not at all how my other daughter figured out how to read, and if<br/>
I&#39;d tried to do the phonemic awareness thing with her, she would&#39;ve been<br/>
extremely frustrated with it simply because it would not have made sense<br/>
to her in any way whatsoever!</div>

I&#39;m not concerned that my children be &quot;ahead&quot;. I don&#39;t see any benefit<br/>
to it unless they&#39;re going to go to school, in which case I suppose it<br/>
would be good for their self-esteem to not be considered dumb by<br/>

information and knowledge that a young child would be able to process<br/>
that would be so beneficial for him/her to know now instead of later.<br/>
Does it really matter whether my child learn about dinosaurs at age<br/>
four, or age eleven, or age 26 for that matter? And is it necessary<br/>
for him/her to learn that from books, or are there other ways to get<br/>
information? An exception might be some of the really academic stuff,<br/>
but I&#39;d think that a child who is ready for that level of<br/>
intellectualization of the world is also probably ready to understand<br/>
how symbols relate to words. <br/>
<br/>
It does seem to me that my kids&#39; learning to read did coincide with<br/>
their brains being ready to start researching the outside world and<br/>
entering others&#39; created worlds. Which was around age 9-10. Before<br/>
that, I suspect, being able to read would have been little more than a<br/>
party trick, in terms of its value to them.<br/>

This week I bought myself a widescreen DVD version of the movie Dead  <br/>
Poets Society and started out watching it.  Didn&#39;t finish.  But I was  <br/>
noticing how many of the actors who were relatively unknown then are  <br/>
now much more famous, and kids who weren&#39;t of movie-watching age when  <br/>
it came out are turning teens now and might appreciate seeing Robert  <br/>
Sean Leonard (who is Dr. Wilson on the TV show &quot;House&quot; now) and  <br/>
Kurtwood Smith (who plays Eric&#39;s dad on &quot;That 70s Show&quot;).  Ethan  <br/>
Hawke&#39;s there. Both he and Robert Sean Leonard went on to play in  <br/>
Shakespeare movies (Hamlet and Much Ado About Nothing, respectively,  <br/>
and Robin Williams has a small role in the Kenneth Branagh Hamlet).<br/>
<br/>
Be warned, those who haven&#39;t seen Dead Poets Society, or haven&#39;t seen  <br/>
it since you had kids and were unschooling.  It&#39;s rough.  Maybe  <br/>
preview it before you show kids.  And Robin Williams is playing a  <br/>
serious role.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ANYWAY....   the book worship part.<br/>
<br/>
In a poetry class the Robin Williams character is teaching, he wants  <br/>
them to tear the introductory section out of their heavy, fat poetry  <br/>
textbooks, and these high school boys in a private boarding school  <br/>
are afraid to tear a book and he says something like &quot;go ahead--it&#39;s  <br/>
not the Bible; you won&#39;t go to hell.&quot;  It&#39;s a moment, the looks the  <br/>
boys are giving each other.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763595045">Reading is something I have been thinking alot about lately.  Of my 4 <br/>
kids, one is reading.  He is 6 and last year just started to read.  <br/>
Some days he reads everything he sees, from serial boxes, to direction <br/>
on an expirement kits.  Other days he reads nothing. (or atleast not <br/>
outloud).  He wasnt taught to read, I can claim no credit, he just <br/>
asked a few questions like, &quot;ing&quot; says ing right.  Or is that a b or a <br/>
d, it says &quot;b&quot;, right?  Or can you read this sentence then I will read <br/>
that one.  <br/>
My 7 year old has made a few comments about his brothers reading.  He <br/>
believes he should have learned to read before him since he is older.  <br/>
I explain that isnt how it works. And he will learn when he is ready. <br/>
He doesnt have the same interest in words.  Everyonce in a while he <br/>
will see something and read it.  But I in absolutely no way feel he <br/>
learns less because he doesnt read yet.  Matter of fact, during that <br/>
time schooled kids are being force fed phonics, my son is discovering <br/>
things, playing, looking at pictures, listening to books on tape, <br/>
expirementing, creating.  He just has better things to do right now.  <br/>
Its like putting a kid to bed before they are tired enough to go to <br/>
sleep... just a waste of time and a power struggle.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-979974347">Hello, my name is Debbie and I’m the person who wrote the message to Joyce that was forwarded here.  I would like to thank everyone who has taken the time so far to respond to the thread.  As I read them all, I tried to jot down some further thoughts and comments and answers to questions posed and I’m sharing them all here in one post.  Hope it makes sense. ☺<br/>
<br/>
1.  Several people picked up on my comment about there being ‘no doubt in my mind that someone who can read at a younger age, and enjoys it, can gain so much more information and knowledge and be far ahead of a counterpart who is not gaining that knowledge.&#39;  I appreciate the pointing out of what was really a pretty judgmental point on my part. I was speaking from the experience of that job mostly, yet from my plain old life experience too, because I do think that reading is a great way to gain information in an easy and fast manner. I guess I think of it as an extremely valuable tool for going through life.<br/>
<br/>
2. Sandra said maybe the importance of books was more true for the 19th century and I think that is a good point.  Now we have lots of ways to get the exact same info that is in books through various audio and video means.  Yet somehow books still seem to trump that for me because for one thing, you don&#39;t need any electricity.<br/>
<br/>
3. I agree with whoever made the point about continuing to read aloud even after a child can read.  For years I&#39;ve been pointing this out, that in our family, even after the kids could read, we read aloud and I could read books above their reading level and they gained a lot of fun and information that way along with their own reading.<br/>
<br/>
4.  I&#39;ve never thought of books as closing one to the real world. I always thought of them as opening many, many new worlds very easily.  Of course I understand that there is a lot of learning that happens outside of books (remember I basically unschooled my own two kids) but I still think reading is such an important and valuable tool.<br/>
<br/>
5.  Someone asked why this is even important to me. Well of course it was important to me when I had the job and wondered about it all and I knew part of the problem was that the kids were stuck in school.  But as to reading in general, I just think it just makes life easier.  I mean back to the 19th century comment, while that makes some sense, I can&#39;t help but point out that here we all are, discussing this by reading each other&#39;s points.<br/>
<br/>
6.  On being ahead and behind.  Another good catch to point out that my comments were being affected by the situation I was in and yet, I guess I do consider reading and books just, well, an efficient way to gain information. And that&#39;s important for me because I use the information to stop and think.  I&#39;ve realized over the year though that a lot of people don&#39;t stop and think and ponder and consider, so the point made about how a lot of people who can read don&#39;t necessarily think is very true.  So perhaps the most important piece here is not reading per se, but the ability and desire to really think things through in depth.<br/>
<br/>
7. On the rewiring of the brain.  This is the one thing that probably kept me going in the job for so long. I am fascinated by scientific research on the brain and since the introduction of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), we are gaining more and more knowledge about how the brain works every day.  Blood flows to the parts of the brain that are working when someone performs a task and fMRI is a way to see and measure the blood flow to various parts of the brain. This fMRI has been used in reading research and it&#39;s fascinating.  They used fMRI and measured the parts of the brain that were working on good readers and then on those who were struggling and saw clearly that one part of the brain was not working on the ones who struggled.  Then the group, the ones who were struggling were given lessons specifically geared to improve phonemic awareness (this is not the same as phonics by the way), and when they measured them again, that part of the brain that &#39;lit up&#39; with the good readers also &#39;lit up&#39; with these people.  This was big news in the reading research field because it clearly showed that there is a brain-based way of helping people who struggle with reading.  It&#39;s not that they couldn&#39;t use that part of the brain, but that for some reason it wasn&#39;t wired and making the connections it was with the people who learn to read easily.<br/>
<br/>
Now some of you may be thinking, well who knows if they would not have picked this up naturally.  I can tell you this, that they have done research on some who were young and struggled but had no help and when tested as adults they had the same part of the brain not making the connections.  And again with those adults, once they were helped with phonemic awareness, their brains behaved the same way and made new connections. This is probably where my statements about &#39;ahead&#39; and &#39;behind&#39; came into play because when those adults were finally taught to read, it didn&#39;t necessarily help them because they had missed so many years of &#39;practicing&#39; reading that it is very difficult to get them to read fluently.<br/>
<br/>
8.  On the story someone told about &#39;it must be true because I read it in a book&#39;  I tell everyone that the most important lesson my father ever taught me (he was also a very avid reader by the way but only went to school through 6th grade).  Anyway the lesson he taught me was to not believe everything you read, it&#39;s basically only someone&#39;s opinion.  That little piece of advice has helped me tremendously. :)<br/>
<br/>
I hope I was able to share my thoughts clearly and welcome any further feedback from those interested in the discussion.<br/>

<br/>
Schooled. Some who were in school or had been in school.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;young&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But younger than some who were already reading, is still only defined as a <br/>
problem by school, not unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;struggling<br/>
<br/>
snip...<br/>
<br/>
had no help &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So not unschoolers then. Sounds like people who had been metaphorically <br/>
abandoned by reading teachers, and then had taken on the idea in their own <br/>
minds that they were broken and needed to be repaired by some brain and <br/>
reading doctor.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; It&#39;s not that they couldn&#39;t use that part of the brain, but that for <br/>
some reason it wasn&#39;t wired and making the connections it was with the <br/>
people who learn to read easily. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yet. The &quot;some reason&quot; is tied up to &quot;not yet&quot;. The &quot;some reason&quot; is because <br/>
someone had an external timetable and the kids&#39; time was up. No mystery <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
But in an unschooling environment, help is *defined by the learner* as such. <br/>
The internal connections will be made at the right time, without being <br/>
pushed into place by some program or other.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t like the implication that the best help comes from Experts who <br/>
have a program. Yes it is interesting science. But just because it works <br/>
does not make it the only thing that works, or that it is essential or <br/>
better than allowing reading to unfold and blossom in an unschooling <br/>
household.<br/>
<br/>
No one is testing the brain electricity of unschoolers as a control group, <br/>
so I guess we just have our own experiences and observations to guide us. <br/>
And the principle of Celebration - that our children are whole and unbroken <br/>
and exactly where they are supposed to be, reading or not (yet).<br/>
<br/>
Two days ago Jayn read aloud instructions from the Alice tutorial for about <br/>
half an hour. It still requires concentration for her to read, not yet <br/>
automatic decoding, but that is so clearly coming. Alice is a college level <br/>
animation program. More real vocabulary in context.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>An advantage of unschooling that I&#39;ve heard about repeatedly is that<br/>
vocabulary does not lag due to reading at later ages.  I can attest to<br/>
vocabulary gain with Karl who uses very unelementary words in everyday<br/>
conversation without even batting an eye.  Young nonreaders don&#39;t need<br/>
to read to get more vocabulary even though, for sure, being read with<br/>
or talked with is indispensible.  I don&#39;t talk &quot;Dick & Jane&quot;-like to<br/>
encourage Karl to practice speaking vocabulary and there&#39;s no need to<br/>
read in practice mode to encourage the accumulation of reading<br/>
knowledge.  Karl gains reading knowledge by asking questions and<br/>
making comments about what he sees in the written words around him.<br/>
The other day while parked at a gas station, he asked me to read<br/>
&quot;phone&quot; on the phone booth in front of us.  He had tried it<br/>
phonetically and the &quot;h&quot; made no sense.  He was annoyed at the illogic<br/>
and I remarked that English has a lot of that but Spanish not so much<br/>
of it.<br/>
<br/>
There are all kinds of ways to gain key reading knowledge without<br/>
being sat down at books and mastering it a word at a time.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is generally the sticking point people have when the subject of  <br/>
book worship comes up. *No one* has claimed that reading isn&#39;t  <br/>
useful. No one could come to my house and even think that ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that because of the emphasis in the society on  <br/>
reading, we get blinded to the benefits of *other* ways of learning.<br/>
<br/>
In this society, reading is treated like a 50&#39; tree in a field with a  <br/>
bunch of stubby trees. Seen from a distance it&#39;s all by itself and  <br/>
it&#39;s enormous. What we&#39;re discussing isn&#39;t knocking that tree down.  <br/>
We&#39;re saying the other trees -- the other ways of learning -- have  <br/>
been trimmed down so far they&#39;re not even noticed. If the others are  <br/>
nurtured and seen for their own value, the 50&#39; reading tree is still  <br/>
there, but it&#39;s just not all by itself anymore. It&#39;s surrounded by  <br/>
other valuable ways of learning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yet somehow books still seem to trump that for me because for one  <br/>
&gt; thing, you don&#39;t need any electricity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But you&#39;re still thinking in terms of book style information.<br/>
<br/>
When you see and value what *can&#39;t* be learned through reading, then  <br/>
you&#39;ll get what we&#39;re saying. It&#39;s not that others are more important  <br/>
than reading, it&#39;s that others have their own value. Reading is good  <br/>
for some things, but not good for other things. Hands on is good for  <br/>
learning some things, not as good for other things. Same for all ways  <br/>
of learning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; even after the kids could read, we read aloud and I could read  <br/>
&gt; books above their reading level and they gained a lot of fun and  <br/>
&gt; information that way along with their own reading.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They could listen to books on CD if hearing books read was just to  <br/>
take in books above their reading level.<br/>
<br/>
Even more valuable is shared experience. Kat (17) and I still read  <br/>
manga together just for the shared experience. Like watching a show  <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but I still think reading is such an important and valuable tool.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But, see, who said reading wasn&#39;t valuable? Do paste the quote if you  <br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
The situation with book worship is like those black and white photos  <br/>
where one thing is in color to emphasize it. Reading for this society  <br/>
is in color, all other ways of learning are in black and white. We&#39;re  <br/>
trying to help people see that&#39;s just a trick of the photo created by  <br/>
society. All learning is in color. We&#39;re not taking away the color  <br/>
from reading. It&#39;s still just as colorful. But doing, talking,  <br/>
watching people and videos, listening and so on are all just as  <br/>
colorful if people could finally see how valuable those contributions  <br/>
are in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
And individuals will find some ways more colorful than others. Some  <br/>
will find reading the most colorful. Some will find videos the most  <br/>
colorful. Some will find working with their hands the most colorful.  <br/>
And so on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But as to reading in general, I just think it just makes life easier.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Has anyone said reading doesn&#39;t make life easier? Again, if you could  <br/>
quote that it would be helpful. (Because maybe the words are coming  <br/>
across in ways people don&#39;t intend! Maybe it was mine and I need to  <br/>
know! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I would say, yes, in general adults who can&#39;t read will have a  <br/>
tougher time in life. There&#39;s a lot of information (like filling out  <br/>
forms, extracting information from schedules) that reading makes lots  <br/>
easier. There may be things they want to know that aren&#39;t as easily  <br/>
found other ways.<br/>
<br/>
But how many adult illiterates are there who didn&#39;t spend years in  <br/>
school with forced reading instruction? Or who grew up in  <br/>
impoverished areas where reading wasn&#39;t available. Unfortunately we  <br/>
can&#39;t really separate an adult who can&#39;t read from the damage of  <br/>
being demoralized and embarrassed in school because they never  <br/>
learned and had to hide it.<br/>
<br/>
But the subject isn&#39;t adult illiteracy. It&#39;s about teaching children  <br/>
to read. So, the question relevant to unschooling is does being able  <br/>
to read at 6 or 8 make life easier for every child?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s another one of those brain traps. School people are used to  <br/>
thinking in terms of generalizations: what&#39;s good for all 8 yos and  <br/>
10 yos. They have to treat them as a single unit because schools are  <br/>
set up to treat them that way.<br/>
<br/>
But unschoolers don&#39;t. We talk about what does a particular child  <br/>
need. A 6 yo who has pleasant experiences with reading but can&#39;t yet  <br/>
read herself is absorbing from life in other ways.<br/>
<br/>
So when we say all 6, 8 and 10 yos don&#39;t need to read, we *don&#39;t*  <br/>
mean unschoolers in any way discourage kids from reading! If a child  <br/>
is ready to read at 6, an unschooled child will be reading then. If  <br/>
the child won&#39;t be ready until 12, they&#39;re supported in who they are  <br/>
while they&#39;re learning other ways, and then they read at 12. The  <br/>
child hasn&#39;t missed anything. They&#39;ve been doing *other* things that  <br/>
they found just as valuable with the time they would have spent reading.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now some of you may be thinking, well who knows if they would not  <br/>
&gt; have picked this up naturally. I can tell you this, that they have  <br/>
&gt; done research on some who were young and struggled but had no help  <br/>
&gt; and when tested as adults they had the same part of the brain not  <br/>
&gt; making the connections.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But in between they were subjected to school methods of learning to  <br/>
read. It&#39;s not unheard of for unschoolers to begin reading at 12.  <br/>
They begin reading and are quickly reading at age level. But what  <br/>
would they be like if they&#39;d been subjected to 6 years of reading  <br/>
instruction that wasn&#39;t making sense to them because their brains  <br/>
weren&#39;t ready for it?<br/>
<br/>
Until that school factor can be eliminated, it&#39;s impossible to tell  <br/>
if it&#39;s school instruction behind that phenomenon or something else.<br/>

I suspect a big factor in kids not developing phonemic awareness  <br/>
before schools give up on them is they&#39;re separated from someone  <br/>
(Mom) who has the leisure to read to them when they want, what they  <br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
 From what I&#39;ve heard, some unschooled kids figure out reading by  <br/>
chunks and not individual phonemes. (I&#39;m guessing the phonemes come  <br/>
later for them, once they&#39;ve gathered enough data in ways that make  <br/>
sense to them. It would be interesting if an unschooler had a teen  <br/>
who  first read by word shapes and ask if they can break words down  <br/>
into phonemes.)<br/>

<br/>
Reading is only a great way to gain information in an easy and fast<br/>
manner, if you know how to read.  For a kid who doesn&#39;t, it would be a<br/>
dreadful experience.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone is arguing that reading isn&#39;t a valuable tool, just<br/>
that it isn&#39;t necessary onto force a child who isn&#39;t ready.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Yet somehow books still seem to trump that for me because for one<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t need electricity to wash my clothes either, I could go to the<br/>
river dredge up water, haul it to my house, make some soap and use my<br/>
knuckles to rub out stains and dirt.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; For years I&#39;ve been pointing this out, that in our family, even<br/>
 </span></blockquote>after the kids could read, we read aloud and I could read books above<br/>
their reading level and they gained a lot of fun and information that<br/>
way along with their own reading.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s just nice to share information wether or not the child<br/>
you are sharing it with could read it themselves or not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve never thought of books as closing one to the real world. I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>always thought of them as opening many, many new worlds very easily. Of<br/>
course I understand that there is a lot of learning that happens outside<br/>
of books (remember I basically unschooled my own two kids) but I still<br/>
think reading is such an important and valuable tool.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
All learning happens outside of books!  You can garner information from<br/>
books, but the learning is happening inside the individual with real<br/>
world connections.  I have no doubt that reading can show us things we<br/>
have never thought about before, but the same is true for hands on<br/>
activities.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I mean back to the 19th century comment, while that makes some<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sense, I can&#39;t help but point out that here we all are, discussing this<br/>
by reading each other&#39;s points.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but I think the point is about wether or not kids should be forced<br/>
to learn how to read, or wether or not that is even possible, and that<br/>
if a child isn&#39;t ready, it can cause a lot of damage.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve realized over the year though that a lot of people don&#39;t stop<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and think and ponder and consider, so the point made about how a lot of<br/>
people who can read don&#39;t necessarily think is very true. So perhaps the<br/>
most important piece here is not reading per se, but the ability and<br/>
desire to really think things through in depth.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think, it&#39;s more about allowing kids the freedom to come to the world<br/>
on their own terms, absorb information as they are ready, and really<br/>
understand things because there isn&#39;t any pressure to perform to someone<br/>
else&#39;s standards.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;They used fMRI and measured the parts of the brain that were working<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on good readers and then on those who were struggling and saw clearly<br/>
that one part of the brain was not working on the ones who struggled.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really believe that kids shut down when forced into situations they<br/>
aren&#39;t ready for.<br/>
<br/>
All the study really showed is that once someone became aware a certain<br/>
aspect of reading, their brain showed it.  It doesn&#39;t mean anything good<br/>
or bad.  The way I see it, is that when kids are living in a hotbed of<br/>
learning without force or coersion, they make all kinds of connections. <br/>
Surely a lot of those connections aren&#39;t made with kids in school, since<br/>
they are only interested in certain types of learning connections.  All<br/>
the rest of the child is irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>
What unschooling does, is makes it all relevant!  Not just wether or not<br/>
someone is able to read or how or when.  Unschooled kids do learn how to<br/>
read and before they do, they are making other, more relevant to the<br/>
individual, connections.  One could argue that it is way more important<br/>
to make valuable connections than specific connections, and who better<br/>
to decide what is valuable than the individual?</div>

 </span></blockquote>kept me going in the job for so long. I am fascinated by scientific<br/>
research on the brain and since the introduction &gt;of fMRI (functional<br/>
magnetic resonance imaging), we are gaining more and more knowledge<br/>
about how the brain works every day.  Blood flows to the parts of the<br/>
brain that are &gt;working when someone performs a task and fMRI is a way<br/>
to see and measure the blood flow to various parts of the brain. This<br/>
fMRI has been used in reading research and it&#39;s &gt;fascinating.  They used<br/>
fMRI and measured the parts of the brain that were working on good<br/>
readers and then on those who were struggling and saw clearly that one<br/>
part of the &gt;brain was not working on the ones who struggled.  Then the<br/>
group, the ones who were struggling were given lessons specifically<br/>
geared to improve phonemic awareness (this is not &gt;the same as phonics<br/>
by the way), and when they measured them again, that part of the brain<br/>
that &#39;lit up&#39; with the good readers also &#39;lit up&#39; with these people. <br/>
This was big news in &gt;the reading research field because it clearly<br/>
showed that there is a brain-based way of helping people who struggle<br/>
with reading.  It&#39;s not that they couldn&#39;t use that part of the brain,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;but that for some reason it wasn&#39;t wired and making the connections it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>was with the people who learn to read easily.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Now<br/>
 </span></blockquote>some of you may be thinking, well who knows if they would not have<br/>
picked this up naturally.  I can tell you this, that they have done<br/>
research on some who were young and &gt;struggled but had no help and when<br/>
tested as adults they had the same part of the brain not making the<br/>
connections.  And again with those adults, once they were helped with<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;phonemic awareness, their brains behaved the same way and made new<br/>
 </span></blockquote>connections. This is probably where my statements about &#39;ahead&#39; and<br/>
&#39;behind&#39; came into play because &gt;when those adults were finally taught<br/>
to read, it didn&#39;t necessarily help them because they had missed so<br/>
many years of &#39;practicing&#39; reading that it is very difficult to get<br/>
them to read &gt;fluently.<br/>
<br/>
I found a the study that uses fMRI and reading. This paper was done in 2003 and only with children 8-12 and not with adults.  It&#39;s a study of children with dyslexia, it&#39;s a study of children in school. If anyone wants to read the study its at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pnas.org/content/100/5/2860.full.pdf.">http://www.pnas.org/content/100/5/2860.full.pdf.</a> The study I found makes no mention of adult students. It does however state that the remedial program that they used (remedial comes with such baggage, doesn&#39;t it?) is in common use which would suggest that any adult who was tested had gone through the programs that should have changed their neural wiring. <br/>
<br/>
There have been recent papers out about the plasticity of the adult human mind. These adults who you argue are demonstrating a rigid mind, an inability to read as well as a younger reader who has practiced more, are getting the rigidness from somewhere outside of their minds ability to adapt to change. I would imagine that the rigidity comes from years of feeling like they were stupid by being told that reading was the only way to knowledge. Reading is probably not something that gives them a warm feeling inside. <br/>

I&#39;d miss people&#39;s questions, but I&#39;d look up and Holly had given them  <br/>
a clear and quick answer.  She was typing as fast as I was, and with  <br/>

speed. Only practice did that.  And Holly pretty much types with her  <br/>
two middle fingers, but she&#39;s zippy.<br/>

Holly&#39;s points were as easy to read as anyone&#39;s, and easier than some,  <br/>

all the video games or My Little Ponies or Barbies or whatever she  <br/>

was dialog in Harvest Moon or Robert Louis Stevenson poems (she loved  <br/>
those for a month or so) or magazine articles about rock bands she  <br/>
liked.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re here discussing things, but there are also people who prefer  <br/>

than reading, it&#39;s that others have their own value. Reading is good<br/>
for some things, but not good for other things. Hands on is good for<br/>
learning some things, not as good for other things. Same for all ways<br/>
of learning. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure some of us can come up with more examples but just for instance:<br/>
<br/>
In the last couple of days, Karl has been playing with a game CD<br/>
called &quot;Crazy Machines, the Wacky Contraption Game.&quot;  At first we were<br/>
plunking around on the beginning challenges to put the prefabbed<br/>
contraptions together to make them work, and quickly ran aground.  We<br/>
did the same thing a few weeks ago and put the game aside.  I got<br/>
burnt out on it and Karl plugged onward without me for a few minutes,<br/>
and the next thing I know he has discovered the freestyle area of the<br/>
game where all the components are at your fingertips and you can<br/>
fabricate any contraption and push the start button to see what<br/>
happens.  He spent hours on it.<br/>
<br/>
Yes it can be written and read about, and has!  If I didn&#39;t have the<br/>
game or acces to the physical object, I could still read about it.<br/>
And I would still think an onscreen game is better than reading to<br/>
play with and figure out the cause and effect.  It&#39;s probably a lot<br/>
safer than playing around with bombs, electricity, and heavy objects<br/>
in physical form too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-555181824">More interesting responses which produced more thoughts from me :)....<br/>
<br/>
1. I&#39;m not sure why I started sounding like someone specifically said<br/>
reading wasn&#39;t valuable.  Somehow as I was writing my response my<br/>
thoughts started drifting to defending reading.  Maybe that came out<br/>
because I&#39;m a weekly political columnist for a daily newspaper and find<br/>
myself defending things like freedom and letting people live their lives<br/>
as they see fit a lot. As you all certainly know there are a lot of<br/>
people who have trouble with the idea of freedom.  So just dump whatever<br/>
I said along those lines.<br/>
<br/>
2. I think everyone was right to point out that the research was done on<br/>
people who were all &#39;schooled.&#39; And that&#39;s partly what has kept me<br/>
wondering all these years, the thought that if we could only do some<br/>
research on unschooled people if the results would be different and<br/>
everyone could learn how to help people learn, which may be just leaving<br/>
them alone of course. :)  Plus just my basic curiosity I guess.  <br/>
<br/>
3. If a well-defined scientific study could be done and I&#39;m not even<br/>
sure it can, that just would be cool. We&#39;ve certainly changed our<br/>
assumptions about many other things over the centuries as we learn more<br/>
through scientific study. The problem I see in our day and age is that a<br/>
lot of science is out to defend assumptions rather than coming from the<br/>
basic idea of proving what&#39;s true.  Whole industries come out of<br/>
assumptions, and the remedial reading industry is probably one of them,<br/>
so you have to be so skeptical and vigilant of any research.  And that&#39;s<br/>
difficult and time-consuming.  But I still hold that eventually true<br/>
science wins, even if it takes centuries.<br/>
<br/>
4. One of the things that has come out of this research is there is<br/>
supposedly a way to screen young kids to see if they may have trouble<br/>
reading.  I&#39;ve watched this play out at the center I worked at and do<br/>
not draw any positive conclusions that it&#39;s as predictable as anyone<br/>
would like.  When I contacted some of these families a few years later,<br/>
some kids were doing fine and others were having trouble, so I saw no<br/>
evidence that a screening actually did anything. Except to worry parents<br/>
of course, which may be the inherent idea even if the people think they<br/>
are well-intentioned and helping the families.  Also, if it does prove<br/>
to be predictive, it would really only show us it is predictive with<br/>
&#39;schooled&#39; kids because we are trying so hard to fit everyone in that<br/>
box and they must do certain things at certain ages.<br/>
<br/>
5. I don&#39;t think I ever said this here yet, but I guess one reason I&#39;ve<br/>
thought about this so much was due to my personal experience unschooling<br/>
my two kids.  My daughter learned to read easily and is as voracious a<br/>
reader and my father and I. My son wasn&#39;t so interested but I just left<br/>
him alone because I believed in my heart that it was natural and he<br/>
would learn to read and enjoy it if he could go at his own pace and<br/>
interest.  And he did because by the time he was in his mid-teens he<br/>
started reading lots more and he never had any trouble with the reading<br/>
he had to do in college.  He&#39;s a great speller too and we did that<br/>
naturally as well, interestingly enough he spells better than my<br/>
daughter.  Of course we had no trouble finding ways for him to learn<br/>
without reading while he was growing up.  So when I started to learn<br/>
more through this job and learn about the research and all, I wondered<br/>
if we may have just been &#39;lucky&#39; in that they did not have some of these<br/>
issues.  But right now, I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s probably true that it&#39;s more<br/>
about the schooled vs the unschooled rather than any specific brain<br/>
science.  I still think we may discover interesting things eventually<br/>
through brain science, it&#39;s certainly an untapped field, a whole new<br/>
frontier, a, a,... okay getting a bit weird now, huh? :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895291224">-=-I&#39;m not sure why I started sounding like someone specifically said<br/>
reading wasn&#39;t valuable. Somehow as I was writing my response my<br/>
thoughts started drifting to defending reading. Maybe that came out<br/>
because I&#39;m a weekly political columnist for a daily newspaper and find<br/>
myself defending things like freedom and letting people live their lives<br/>
as they see fit a lot.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Usually when someone sounds like something, it&#39;s because they&#39;re  <br/>
thinking it.   Typos are an exception. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=- As you all certainly know there are a lot of<br/>
people who have trouble with the idea of freedom. So just dump whatever<br/>
I said along those lines.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand this.<br/>
I understand the words, but I don&#39;t understand the intent.<br/>
<br/>
-=-When I contacted some of these families a few years later,<br/>
some kids were doing fine and others were having trouble, so I saw no<br/>
evidence that a screening actually did anything. Except to worry parents<br/>
of course, which may be the inherent idea even if the people think they<br/>
are well-intentioned and helping the families. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It harmed the kids, and it harmed the relationship between the parents  <br/>
an the children.  It harmed their freedoms and the way they perceived  <br/>
themselves and others.<br/>
<br/>
-=- there is<br/>
supposedly a way to screen young kids to see if they may have trouble<br/>
reading. I&#39;ve watched this play out at the center I worked at and do<br/>
not draw any positive conclusions that it&#39;s as predictable as anyone<br/>
would like.-=-<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;screen&quot; you&#39;re talking about some kind of test or evaluation.   If  <br/>
you think those are benign, I question whether your understanding of  <br/>
unschooling approaches what people on this list have come to accept as  <br/>
given.<br/>
<br/>
 From my perspective:<br/>
<br/>
***Of all the things I believe strongly, one which has changed my life  <br/>
as profoundly as any one other belief is my personal knowledge that  <br/>
test scores can and do (can&#39;t fail to) affect the treatment a child  <br/>
receives at his parents&#39; hands. High scores, low scores, average  <br/>
scores--no matter. Parents cease to treat the child as his original,  <br/>
known self and color him soul deep with that number.<br/>
<br/>
***My life would have been different. My husband&#39;s life would have  <br/>
been different, without those 5th and 8th grade ITBS scores. I venture  <br/>
to say without even knowing who is reading this that your life would  <br/>
have been different, and specifically I believe your life would have  <br/>
been better, had not you been branded with a number on your &quot;permanent  <br/>
record&quot; (there&#39;s a big mean scary joke, the &quot;permanence&quot; and important  <br/>
parts) as a young innocent ten or thirteen year old full of potential,  <br/>
at some unknown point on a learning curve which might soon be at its  <br/>
settled-out point, or might just be beginning. ***<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/testing">http://sandradodd.com/testing</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t think I ever said this here yet, but I guess one reason I&#39;ve<br/>
thought about this so much was due to my personal experience unschooling<br/>
my two kids.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still not clear on the unschooling history from which you&#39;re  <br/>
writing.   This post is inconsistent with the note forwarded by  <br/>
Joyce.    The value of this discussion depends on people being as  <br/>
clear and honest as they can be.  Your first writing wasn&#39;t addressed  <br/>
to this list, but was to Joyce, which is fine.  Still, consistency is  <br/>
important if the newer unschoolers are to gain faith in your  <br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
You wrote &quot; I homeschooled/unschooled my two children through high  <br/>
school. &quot;   DId you homeschool in a dedicated fashion and then change  <br/>
at some point wholly to unschooling, or are you describing an eclectic  <br/>
hybrid of schooling with more freedom than some school at home  <br/>
families use?   If throughout that time you were involved in teaching  <br/>
reading and math, is it possible you have never stepped fully away  <br/>
from schools?<br/>

Considering that most screening is for getting funding for whatever a<br/>
group is doing, and is intended not necessarily to help children so<br/>
much as to help justify the getting or continuation of funds.<br/>

When I said just dump it, I meant just dump the part where I felt like I<br/>
had to defend reading as something valuable. I understand that what<br/>
people were trying to say was not that reading wasn&#39;t valuable but that<br/>
there are so many other ways to learn.  And I agree.  Hence, the dump<br/>
it.  Hope that&#39;s clearer.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know how you got the idea that I thought screenings were benign.<br/>
I don&#39;t think that at all. Keep in mind I&#39;m talking about my experience<br/>
working in an educational center that teaches reading.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know how you or others here would judge or evaluate my family&#39;s<br/>
homeschooling experience.  I would not say I succeeded in being a<br/>
radical unschooler if that&#39;s what you mean.  Is that okay as far as me<br/>
continuing to discuss things on this list?<br/>
 <br/>
I also don&#39;t know where you comment about honesty came from.  From the<br/>
start, I have included my full name and anyone could have, and probably<br/>
some have already, done a google search to see if I&#39;m out there<br/>
anywhere. So I&#39;m unclear on what that was about.<br/>
 <br/>
If anyone really wants to know, probably the best way to understand how<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling translated into my family is to read the free,<br/>
short, humor book I wrote about our family&#39;s early homeschooling<br/>
experiences a few years back.  (If anyone here reads Life Learning<br/>
Magazine, an excerpt was published in the Jan/Feb 2005 issue<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/0502/JanFeb05.pdf)">http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/0502/JanFeb05.pdf)</a><br/>
 <br/>
The book is available for free download here: www.timeforbedlam.com<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.timeforbedlam.com/">http://www.timeforbedlam.com/</a>&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
At the end of the book I have a series of &#39;interviews&#39; of me, my husband<br/>
and our two kids where I explain my philosophy a bit and you can see<br/>
more about how it worked for us.  But no matter what your educational<br/>
philosophy, I think you&#39;ll find it a fun read. :-)<br/>
 <br/>
Hope that helps explain things better.<br/>

Sounds like your daughter has great visual memory and imagery and that&#39;s<br/>
one reason it was better and easier for her to learn to read by sight.<br/>
<br/>
And to your question, simply put, phonemic awareness is the process of<br/>
hearing a spoken word and being able to differentiate the individual<br/>
sounds that make up the word.  It&#39;s not about the letters you see, it&#39;s<br/>
about the sounds you hear.  So the word cat for example has three sounds<br/>
but the word thought does also.  And the word box has 4 individual<br/>
phoneme sounds ( b, o, k, s)<br/>
<br/>
And yes, the Electric Company video you linked is dealing with phonemic<br/>
awareness.  It&#39;s working on word patterns and isolating the first sound<br/>
in the words.  But when the lady says her part, she putting together two<br/>
sounds at once so the word is not being said in an entirely isolated<br/>
manner.  To demonstrate all three sounds separately in those words, it<br/>
would have been fun to see three people playing that game.<br/>

No, it isn&#39;t.  &quot;Dump it&quot; where?  It&#39;s in the archives of this list,  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847447565">A vast part of phonemic awareness is unconscious though because of<br/>
dialect variations and how that plays out in our own pronunciation.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, the &quot;t&quot; in &quot;bit of&quot; is like a &quot;d&quot; sound in my own<br/>
pronunciation but elsewhere more distinctly a &quot;t&quot; sound in the way<br/>
others pronounce it.  And the reason that&#39;s important is if anything<br/>
phonemic awareness after reading is very different (as sound pictures<br/>
go) than pre-reading, and it&#39;s a large part of why spelling and<br/>
reading through our understanding of spoken language is not<br/>
straightforward.  Another example is the word &quot;sandwich&quot;... the<br/>
combination of &quot;nd&quot; with &quot;w&quot; forces the &quot;nd&quot; to sound like an &quot;m.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s why phonemic awareness in the context of reading doesn&#39;t make as<br/>
much sense as we might like it to.<br/>
