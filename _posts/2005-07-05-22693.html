<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076632245">This is an attractive and interesting page for kids:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kidsclick.org/">http://www.kidsclick.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
What surprised me was the link right below:   &quot;What does this page look like <br/>
through a Librarian&#39;s Eyes?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is, sort of, the page translated into Dewey Decimal system notation.    <br/>
Dewey Decimal is cool with me.   I&#39;ve gone straight to costume books and <br/>
English history in libraries I&#39;d never been in because I knew the numbers.   <br/>
But...    I hesitate to think that a librarian would think that the world wide web, <br/>
the whole internet, all the real-world current and constantly updated sites <br/>
would need the dewey decimal system.   So I doubt that many really <br/>
computer-savvy librarians would think of the internet as a library.    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But on the other hand, I have a new computer.   I was used to my old one (and <br/>
its father before it &lt;g&gt;).   I was frustrated that it didn&#39;t have the same <br/>
&quot;recent documents&quot; feature, and that an add-on I had before (WorkStrip) didn&#39;t <br/>
do what IT used to do.    How would I ever find my files?    And Sherlock, even <br/>
SHERLOCK didn&#39;t do what it used to do.   Oh, I was sad.    Then I figured out <br/>
that the regular old &quot;find&quot; feature that used to not find much will now find <br/>
ANYTHING and everything, no matter how badly named. &lt;g&gt;   (Almost.)<br/>
<br/>
So maybe I was thinking too much like an old-time librarian or something.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I wish there had been cool sites like this when my kids were little, <br/>
and so for all of those of you with still-little kids, you might find some <br/>
wonderful things (and if they were to use this a few times, the Dewey Decimal <br/>
system might make more sense when they come across that).<br/>
