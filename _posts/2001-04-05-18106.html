<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900717181">I have to ask you about your address Noni? My not quite two year old daughter <br/>
calls her cousin Nory by Noni and her name is Victoria!<br/>

Hi Johanna!<br/>
<br/>
Noni comes from Tahitian Noni Juice- or the flower/fruit Morinda Citrofolia.  <br/>
It&#39;s an ancient fruit that has been used for thousand of years to keep good <br/>
health and to treat many health problems. Used mainly in the Islands where it <br/>
grows- Tahiti, Hawaii, New Guinea, maybe the Caribbean... but now it&#39;s also <br/>
used all over the world since it&#39;s being bottled now by the company Morinda.  <br/>
I was a distributor for awhile, but I just like the word Noni and 411 is my <br/>
daughter&#39;s birthday- and also the &#39;symbol&#39; for information.  Why does your <br/>
daughter call her cousin Noni?  Is it that she just can&#39;t pronounce her real <br/>
name? (How cute!)<br/>
<br/>
:-) Victoria</div>
