<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003029112">I had always been staunchly opposed to any kind of play with toy guns - <br/>
even opposed to water guns.  I finally had a light bulb moment ... my <br/>
reaction to toy guns were not about my kids.  It stems from my own <br/>
issues.  I&#39;ve learned to take a step back and see what they are doing <br/>
for what it is ... simply playing.  So, I&#39;m comfortable with that now, <br/>
but I have a new issue.  Most of our schooled friends are highly <br/>
opposed to guns (one won&#39;t even let her son pretend that his hand is a <br/>
gun and make shooting sounds).  They tell me their feelings are because <br/>
of how the school environments are these days.  I try to respect their <br/>
wishes and tell my kids that we can&#39;t do any pretend shooting when we <br/>
are with those kids; however, my younger son is not one to be <br/>
controlled (which, yes, I can see as a good thing!).  We enjoy my <br/>
friend&#39;s and her son&#39;s company, but would love to have our visits be <br/>
more comfortable ... where we can just let our kids play without <br/>
interfering and telling them how to play.  Does anyone have any <br/>
thoughts on the topic, or have you encountered a similar situation?<br/>

I was reading a book about philosophy and South Park, and one guy was  <br/>
saying that pretending violence or racism (imagining being a  <br/>
character in the show, or identifying with a character to see a joke  <br/>
from his point of view) is no different from pretending to be a super- <br/>
hero or a good guy.  (I hope my paraphrase isn&#39;t totally botching the  <br/>

Marty has played a video game called Knights of the Old Republic, a  <br/>
Star Wars based game, three times, I think.  You can play it as a  <br/>
good guy or a bad guy, or an undecided/changeable kind of character  <br/>
and it comes out differently different times.  It&#39;s a morality game.   <br/>
I think kids NEED that kind of play and exploration.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935066044">Philosophizing about morality is why Archie Bunker was such a great show and<br/>
why it was so controversial when I was a kid.  We weren&#39;t allowed to watch<br/>

the Dynomite kid (what was that show called?) was a way to imagine being<br/>

Instead of telling them you cant play with guns how about making swords out of &quot;animal balloons&quot; or getting foam swords, or those foam blow darts, or soft play bow and arrows, or sling shots....homemade or bought, or???.........<br/>

What about pretending with fairy wands or pixie dust?  When that mom  <br/>
says something narrow-minded,  you could sprinkle &quot;smart dust&quot; on her  <br/>
and then smile blissfully (in character) and bat your eyes  <br/>
expectantly while you wait to see if it works!<br/>
<br/>
(Much meaner than pretending to shoot her with a gun.)<br/>
<br/>
What I used to tell my boys was not to &quot;shoot&quot; at anyone who wasn&#39;t  <br/>
playing.  Only those who agreed to play were fair targets.  It was  <br/>
minor, but it was the same principle as &quot;it&#39;s only fun if everybody&#39;s  <br/>
having fun.&quot;<br/>

It is very very hard when your son&#39;s major passion IS guns of all types - he has air soft guns & BB guns,  AND 99 % of the kids in our group are not allowed to touch real nor toy guns.  He started out with toy guns and then cap guns - he even had a Gatling cap gun for a while - is was way cool!!!!   He often mentions that it is frustrating that none of the homeschool families will let their kids be around guns.  When he took a film class he made war films - he got the two that he knew were allowed to play with guns to help him reenact wars and he filmed it.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, when we ran into the &quot;no gun play&quot; rule the first time I was<br/>
really worried; my boys are both super into play guns. And I worried<br/>
for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Since I wanted to make it clear that guns are not for play but there<br/>
are play guns, I arranged a visit out to the NV desert, where my<br/>
stepdad is a gunsmith. He let Rowan walk around the shop, showed him<br/>
all kinds of guns, then we went out into the boonies, where stepdad<br/>
had set up a demonstration that&#39;s been really good for adults, where<br/>
you fill up gallon jugs with water and red food color, and then shoot<br/>
those. The red water goes everywhere, and makes it really easy to see<br/>
that in real life, things you shoot tend to explode, quite unlike what<br/>
they do in movies.<br/>
<br/>
So there we are... and Mom realizes she&#39;s out of red coloring, but has<br/>
blue, and hey, a splash is a splash. And we set up the demo, and give<br/>
Rowan The Serious Talk About Gun Safety (tm), back him up to next to<br/>
stepdad, who proceeds to demolish the jugs, and blue water goes flying<br/>
everyplace. It&#39;s totally cool. Rowan has a very thoughtful look on his<br/>
face, and I ask if he understands that this is what happens when you<br/>
shoot living things with guns. He smiles and says &quot;but Mama, those<br/>
were more like what happens to aliens, cause it was blue!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Obviously the NRA&#39;s Eddie Eagle program would be more successful if it<br/>
included aliens. =P<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t worry about him understanding the gun thing any more.<br/>
Clearly, he gets it. =) =) So I just let him play. And everything is a<br/>
gun. The only request we make is that they not shoot at living things<br/>
or at people not playing. And that works for us.<br/>

The first time Marty watched Othello,  he turned to me halfway  <br/>
through and said (with FEELING), &quot;Iago is GENIUS!!!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It seemed immoral for him to say it and for me to hear it, but I  <br/>
understood what he meant.  He had admiration for the cunning of the  <br/>
plan, not for the morality and intent and result.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think one of the hardest things to deal with is when someone else <br/>
is barking out rules to your child&#39;s friend and then looking at you <br/>
to support them by you telling your kid to stop it to.  I actually <br/>
heard a friend of mine tell her daughter and a group of kids she was <br/>
playing with that &quot;Cindy is not to pretend or play SpongeBob&quot;.  She <br/>
ran over to where they were to say this cause she heard someone say <br/>
something that sounded like Sponge Bob!  <br/>
Anyway, back to guns.  I do what others have said.  I ask them not <br/>
to point them at people who are not playing. And that means me too <br/>
cause I find it disconcerting to have a toy gun pointed at me.  I <br/>
also ask my kids not to take them to the park.   They usually prefer <br/>
to take lightsabers anyway.  I like the idea of buying a bunch of <br/>
those foam swords and just keeping them around for when certain <br/>
company comes over.  Honestly,  I didnt buy my kids guns for a long <br/>
time either but after watching them make them out of every material <br/>
available I realized how stupid that was.<br/>
I was just thinking of something similiar the other day.  When <br/>
friends come over my kids run around doing all sorts of things.  <br/>
They play video games, run around in dress up stuff, ride bikes, <br/>
play posessed babies and sometimes turn a movie on for about 10 <br/>
seconds.  I dont like to tell them they cant play or do certain <br/>
things.. but we have friends who like to descide what the kids can <br/>
play etc.. drives me nuts cause they think it is awful that the kids <br/>
are in their playing video games.  We have a hard time finding <br/>
friends that will just sit back and relax and let the kids have fun <br/>
with each other.</div>

I have sort of a similiar problem and have honestly started avoided going over to a lot of peoples houses. <br/>
<br/>
The parents say let the kids go play and have fun so they run off then same parent gets all annoyed after they have been playing video games for 2 hours and starts to shoo them off and make them go outside and get exercise or go play in the room or whatever order they decide to give.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is Nate ...6, 7 in October but mentally in the 18 month range. He loves to do things like make pictures on the wall with toothpaste. Its not cause he wants to be naughty and upset people. Toothpaste feels neat and it smells minty great and who dosent love modern art?<br/>
<br/>
Many seem to feel offended about the fact that when Nate is with me i have to either keep him with me with the other adult(s) or hang out with all the kids. <br/>

<br/>
This made me think of a time when one of our old neighbors came over. He and <br/>
Jayn were I think about 5 and were standing in the tub painting with <br/>
ordinary kid acrylics on the tiled wall of the bath recess. They were having <br/>
a ball, with much giggling and squealing.<br/>
<br/>
His mom came down the hall to check up on him and walked into the bathroom. <br/>
She was absolutely astounded and said, &quot;What are you doing??!!!???&quot; <br/>
(punctuation my interpretation of her disapproving voice). I was standing <br/>
right there in the bathroom, and BTW wasn&#39;t it obvious what they were doing?<br/>
<br/>
Her son immediately started saying over and over, &quot;She don&#39;t mind, Mom, she <br/>
don&#39;t mind.....&quot; Mom seemed pretty skeptical, but like I said, I was right <br/>
there obviously allowing and encouraging the game.<br/>
<br/>
I said something about how easily it would all come off. As indeed it did, <br/>
eventually, and Jayn enjoyed that wet and messy part just as much as the <br/>
painting.<br/>
<br/>
It is more respectful of the host to stay with your child if you are <br/>
concerned that they will want to do something that could be inappropriately <br/>
destructive or make the host feel uncomfortable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve thought about what makes villains so interesting and I concluded  <br/>
it&#39;s because they&#39;re passionate and love what they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of like unschoolers &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But villains don&#39;t care how they sweep obstacles out of their way. If  <br/>
someone says no to you, you get to shoot them! :-) Rules schmules. A  <br/>
delicious feeling of power and control.<br/>
<br/>
Though I think the more interesting villains are the ones who  <br/>
maintain some code of honor. That ups their need to be clever in  <br/>
their pursuit of happiness.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully unschoolers are helping their kids pursue their passions  <br/>
while still being respectful of others. So we&#39;re raising respectful  <br/>
villains :-)<br/>
<br/>
Heroes do good out of obligation to do what&#39;s right. They do what  <br/>
they&#39;re supposed to do. It&#39;s not usually personal. Sort of like the  <br/>
pursuit of the American Dream: go to college, get a good job, buy a  <br/>
house with white picket fence, marry and have 2 children.<br/>
<br/>
Except Batman. He may not love what he&#39;s doing, but he&#39;s passionate  <br/>
about getting it done. It&#39;s personal to him. And he chooses the  <br/>
freedom to ignore rules if they get in his way.<br/>

One thought that popped into my head that scratches the surface of  <br/>
the issue was to ask people why Silence of the Lambs was so popular.  <br/>
Did people like it because they want to be serial murderers? Or a  <br/>
hunter of serial murderers? I&#39;m thinking neither, and yet lots of  <br/>
people went to see it. Did serial murders go up after it&#39;s release?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s an excerpt from the techdirt article that someone posted the<br/>
other day...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Violence has always been and remains a central interest of humankind<br/>
and a recurrent, even obsessive theme of culture both high and low ...<br/>
It engages the interest of children from an early age, as anyone<br/>
familiar with the classic fairy tales collected by Grimm, Andersen, and<br/>
Perrault are aware. To shield children right up to the age of 18 from<br/>
exposure to violent descriptions and images would not only be quixotic,<br/>
but deforming; it would leave them unequipped to cope with the world as<br/>
we know it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This seems to be the fear of gun play.  That kids will become violent if<br/>
they play with guns.  So parents try to eliminate anything violent, to<br/>
shield their children.<br/>
<br/>
Someone on another list I&#39;m on was asking about nonviolent video games<br/>
for their young child.  They were concerned with an online set of kid<br/>
games that had things such as hitting crabs with yoyo&#39;s and dropping<br/>
nuts on squirrels.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed to me that it was a little overprotective and extreme.  What<br/>
we actually do to crabs to eat them seems so much worse than hitting<br/>
them with a yoyo and I&#39;ve had squirrels intentionally hit me with nuts. <br/>
At our very basic nature, it&#39;s eat or get eaten.  When a lion downs<br/>
another animal, it is pretty violent, it&#39;s nature, we are a part of<br/>
nature.  Even though we have higher thinking skills, we still have those<br/>
basic animal instincts.<br/>
<br/>
Guns are an evolutionary weapon, I imagine it used to be sticks and<br/>
stones, and then more advanced weapons came along as we entered the iron<br/>
age, and then more advanced and more advanced.  Guns were designed to<br/>
kill other people, but like swords and knives, they evolved for other<br/>
purposes too, hunting, survival, protection.<br/>
<br/>
I know one bow hunter IRL, I know even more people who practice archery,<br/>
that have never been hunting, and have never killed a living being.<br/>

Wow.  My dad was a bow hunter, and I never even once pictured the  <br/>
remote possibility of him aiming an arrow at a human.<br/>
<br/>
He was an extremely peaceful guy, and my vision of him is of his  <br/>
being very sweet and gentle.<br/>
<br/>
Those who would keep a child from playing with a toy archery set or a  <br/>
water gun are having WAY more violent thoughts than my dad and I had.  <br/>

boys I knew. We played Cowboys and Indians and war games a lot. When I<br/>
was in my teens, I collected replica guns. I still love guns. To me,<br/>
they&#39;re things of beauty. Does that make sense? But I&#39;ve never fired a<br/>
real gun and have no interest in doing so. Not even on a firing range.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter as a child, though she participated in many of the<br/>
&quot;boyish&quot; games - soccer and climbing things, for example - preferred<br/>
Barbie dolls and My Little Pony to toy guns. Three years ago, when she<br/>
was 20, she signed up for a stint in the Australian Army Reserve and<br/>
got to handle real guns and wear real camo. I&#39;ve no idea where that<br/>
came from.<br/>
<br/>
My son has a few toy guns but has only used his Super Soaker water<br/>
cannon in recent years. Neither he nor his mates have ever been that<br/>
interested in playing war games. They&#39;re all gamers. Pat can play<br/>
&quot;shoot &#39;em up&quot; videogames for hours on end and some of them are far<br/>
more realistic than anything I would have imagined playing war games<br/>
as a boy. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m perfectly okay with that. We&#39;ve had some fascinating conversations<br/>
about the authentic depiction of real life events. Generally speaking,<br/>
I&#39;m all for it. I would rather he saw what really happens when<br/>
somebody gets shot and know that it&#39;s not bang and you fall over,<br/>
which is as far as I got in my understanding when I was a boy. <br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, my wife grew up in Belfast, Northern Ireland, at a time<br/>
when playing with a toy gun or even forming the shape of a gun with<br/>
pointing fingers was an invitation to be shot at by a British soldier.<br/>
<br/>
Things that came to mind. Don&#39;t know if there&#39;s anything useful in it. :-)<br/>

<br/>
I read this book a long time ago in a Children&#39;s Lit Course, and it<br/>
was very transforming regarding my understanding of children&#39;s need to<br/>
confront the concepts of good and evil, with violence and all.  It<br/>
talks a lot about Grimm&#39;s fairy tales, which are quite violent in many<br/>
ways.  I believe Bettelheim also talks a bit about how the watered<br/>
down Disney fairy tales do our kids a disservice in comparison to<br/>
Grimm&#39;s tales.  I think Bettelheim&#39;s views would be directly<br/>
applicable to the question of toy guns. <br/>
<br/>
Bettelheim also has the view that when we protect our children from<br/>
those harsh realities of good and evil, it actually hurts our<br/>
children.  This is because, even when we don&#39;t discuss it with our<br/>
children, they will still *have* those &quot;evil&quot; ideas going through<br/>
their head.  If we deny our children the opportunity to work through<br/>
the ideas, they can actually develop some guilt or self-hatred (&quot;Why<br/>
am I thinking these violent thoughts?&quot;  &quot;What kind of person am I?&quot;).<br/>
 Again, I personally think the gun issue is applicable here, too. <br/>
Even if we shelter our children from guns by refusing them to enter<br/>
our house, our children will surely eventually become aware of their<br/>
existence.  What will our children be thinking of themselves when they<br/>
want to work through the use/purpose of guns within themselves, and<br/>
when we deny them the ability to come to terms with their own feelings<br/>
on the matter?<br/>

are SO opposed to it (any kind of shooting play, both imaginary and <br/>
with toys), any suggestions will probably be rejected.  I&#39;m probably <br/>
better off asking questions.  I could open the door by asking if <br/>
their objection to good guy/bad guy play is strictly because of <br/>
potential school violence, or even because of a no-tolerance policy <br/>
at school.  That might give me the opening to explain that I&#39;ve been <br/>
giving it a lot of thought recently and have decided to relax and <br/>
allow my kids to explore the good guy/bad guy roles. I can explain <br/>
that although I was very uncomfortable with this kind of play in the <br/>
past (and am still uncomfortable with guns in general), I find this <br/>
play to be a creative outlet, as well as a way for kids to explore <br/>
moral issues.  <br/>
<br/>
In the past, when my friends and I have had discussions about the <br/>
kinds of play we engaged in as kids (cops & robbers, cowboys & <br/>
indians, etc), the response always seems to be, &quot;things are different <br/>
now.&quot;  I suppose I need to ask, how are things different?  We (people <br/>
in our age group) are not more violent for having played these <br/>
games.  And couldn&#39;t the lack of accessibility of these toys or kinds <br/>
of play actually glamorize them, or make them seem more enticing?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really not expecting to get anywhere with these two friends.  I <br/>
just can&#39;t stand feeling stressed when we&#39;re playing together, <br/>
because I&#39;m afraid my kids will use the forbidden <br/>
words: &quot;gun,&quot; &quot;shooting&quot; or &quot;bad guy.&quot;  It&#39;s tough for my younger son <br/>
to *not* include this in his play.  I think these two friends would <br/>
even be opposed to all of your wonderful suggestions of foam swords, <br/>
and things like that (which I think I&#39;ll get to have on hand <br/>
anyway).  I guess the only way I&#39;ll know for sure is to ask, right?</div>

<br/>
I have that book and have learned a ton from it.  I recommend it to  <br/>
anyone interested in fairy tales, folklore, psychology, philosophy...<br/>
<br/>
Bettelheim has detractors, but it&#39;s not about his research.  It&#39;s  <br/>
about his treatment of children in his care (mental health research  <br/>
facility).  Corporal punishment, not sexual abuse at all.    For some  <br/>
people, they want to reject all his work because they found something  <br/>
to criticize about him.  For me, I think the work should stand on its  <br/>
own merits.  The Uses of Enchantment has some really great things  <br/>
others hadn&#39;t written at all.  I&#39;ve loved fairy tales since I was  <br/>
tiny, and so all the psychological stuff about archetypes and  <br/>
morality thrills me--Jung and Bettelheim and anyone else with a story  <br/>
to tell or a theory to propose.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some people won&#39;t watch PeeWee&#39;s Playhouse because Paul Reubens  <br/>
touched himself in a movie theater.  I always think he was a nice guy  <br/>
to go to the movies instead of whacking off at his parents&#39; house,  <br/>
where he was visiting.<br/>
<br/>
Some people won&#39;t watch Michael Jackson videos from the 80&#39;s because  <br/>
he had a scandal many years later.  I think Thriller is one great  <br/>
pile of music, no matter what Michael Jackson and Pee Wee Herman and  <br/>
Bruno Bettelheim all did rolled into one crazed orgy of bad behavior.<br/>
