<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; .  So some days I worry it is enough?  <br/>
&gt; How is the reading and math going to come in <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My boys are now 6 & 8.  My 8 year old began reading... like more than just <br/>
sounding out words... just after he turned 6.  Now he reads VERY well.  My six <br/>
year old will see the word &quot;van&quot; and say &quot;vacuum&quot;.  To him, every word that <br/>
begins with a &quot;v&quot; must be vacuum.  Kind of funny.  Also, he still mixes up his <br/>
&quot;b&quot;s and &quot;d&quot;s.  I have done my best to convince him that the word &quot;bitch&quot; will <br/>
never be found in a Hooked on Phonics book  (ditch is what they are shooting <br/>
for    : )    Anyway, it seems that once they can read, we as moms can relax.  I <br/>
have a friend with a 15 yr old.  She reads beautifully and reads everything <br/>
(very mature reader) despite the fact that she didn&#39;t read until she was 10.  <br/>
Math has been accomplished to this point mostly by $$$$    A trip to the dollar <br/>
store... including tax... a gift of $20 from Grandma... what can that buy?  <br/>
Stuff like that.  Then Monopoly Jr.   Math has sort of taken care of itself.  I <br/>
have Dillon do workbooks just to have something to show an evaluator.  In <br/>
Florida, compulsory school age begins at 6, so I will register Matty this next <br/>
coming school year.  When people spend time with my boys, they are very struck <br/>
by how verbal they are and how much they know about fish and bugs and money and <br/>
bank proceedures and laundry and... well, the list goes on and on.  But... <br/>
telling time to the 5 minute mark and knowing place values to the 100 millions <br/>
isn&#39;t something that has come up in our everyday life, so my boys don&#39;t know <br/>
stuff like that.  BUT... they know how credit cards work and why it is better to <br/>
save up and then buy something rather than charge it   : )   ~Kris<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hee hee.  About a year ago we often did respite for our adopted son&#39;s <br/>
siblings (they are back home now...LONG story...) but his little sister, cutest <br/>
little campbell soup girl, was about 4 yo.  She mixed up a lot of her letters when <br/>
talked, used B&#39;s for D&#39;s.  She loved to play in soapy water and the boys would <br/>
all cackle hysterically when she&#39;d say she wanted to &quot;Wash da bitches.&quot;  <br/>
