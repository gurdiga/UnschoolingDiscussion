<br/>
The latest issue of Kids Discover just came yesterday. I couldn&#39;t find a<br/>
website for it so far; none is listed in the magazine. There is only a<br/>
non-toll free phone number. Everything provided on the back cover is listed<br/>
below.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kids Discover  (published monthly, 10 issues a year)<br/>
149 Fifth Avenue<br/>
New York, NY  10010<br/>
(212) 677-4457<br/>
<br/>
Send subscriptions to:<br/>
Kids Discover<br/>
P.O. Box 54205<br/>
Boulder, CO 80328-4205<br/>
<br/>
There is a card in the magazine for a one year, 10-issue subscription for<br/>
$19.95. The regular price is $26.95 per year. I also saw some magazine<br/>
services online that have it for $19.95, but I have never purchased<br/>
anything from them. Also, there are no advertisements in the magazine,<br/>
which is unusual and very nice!<br/>
