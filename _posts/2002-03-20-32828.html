<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788373728">I was wandering down memory lane and was thinking about all this &quot;h&quot;ysteria<br/>
over defining unschooling and what is or isn&#39;t &quot;true&quot; unschooling and came<br/>
up with a whole lot of words beginning with &quot;h&quot; that were a great influence<br/>
on my journey with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Historically I come from a long line of unschooling type thinkers (notice<br/>
the sentence starts with &quot;h&quot; &lt;g&gt;).  Both my grandfather and<br/>
great-grandfather would have been right at home with unschooling.  If my<br/>
grandfather or any of his 18 brothers and sisters wanted to learn about<br/>
something, their father (this was in the 1800s) would order up whatever was<br/>
needed (including shipping tutors in).  There was no &quot;I am a landowner and<br/>
farmer, you will be too&quot; or &quot;you are a girl you will learn to clean and<br/>
cook.&quot;  My grandfather was the same with my mother and my aunts and uncles.<br/>
In fact, he risks federal prison and withdrew them all from school!<br/>
<br/>
Herb.  My dad would have been right at home with unschooling.  Even though<br/>
my sister and I went to ps it wasn&#39;t required that we fit the mold and<br/>
wherever our interests led that is where we were encouraged to go.  I was<br/>
working on motorcycles when I was 5.<br/>
<br/>
Heather.  She was my first experience with what is now called unschooling.<br/>
She was the influence that led me to &quot;unschool&quot; my nieces and nephews back<br/>
when homeschooling was underground.  I still stop and think &quot;what would<br/>
Heather do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holt.  He gave it a name and the foundation from which the world of<br/>
unschooling has grown.<br/>
<br/>
Helen.  She is why I joined this list and while there are many others that I<br/>
respect (Mary, Mary, Linda, and the list goes on), her words are the ones<br/>
that always seem so rational in what sometimes seems like a war of words or<br/>
even a deliberate misunderstanding simply because one party may not like the<br/>
original poster, not their words.<br/>

<br/>
Defining Unschooling<br/>
<br/>
by Helen Hegener<br/>
<br/>
Over the past few months there has been a lot of discussion<br/>
in homeschooling circles about unschooling, what it is, what it<br/>
isn&#39;t, and how one does it - or doesn&#39;t. Workshops on unschooling<br/>
have become standard fare at homeschool conferences and conventions,<br/>
and several homeschooling publications have tried to define the word.<br/>
There are even derivatives now, like Christian unschooling and<br/>
structured unschooling and radical unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is an interesting word, or at least I think it&#39;s<br/>
a word. How many people need to use a word, and more or less<br/>
understand and agree on what it means, before it officially joins our<br/>
language - as in it gets added to our dictionaries? I don&#39;t think the<br/>
word homeschooling was around for more than six or seven years before<br/>
it showed up in a major dictionary. Maybe with a few more years of<br/>
useage unschooling will join the ranks of publicly recognized and<br/>
respectable words.<br/>
<br/>
But to be included in a dictionary, a word needs a<br/>
definition, and unschooling is a particularly difficult word to<br/>
define. Just last month there was a long and involved discussion<br/>
about what it means - and doesn&#39;t mean - on one of America Online&#39;s<br/>
homeschooling forums. There were those who felt unschooling totally<br/>
precludes the use of school-type materials, and those who said the<br/>
materials don&#39;t matter, it&#39;s your attitude that counts. From the<br/>
online discussions, one could gather that unschooling generally seems<br/>
to refer to the act of not learning in the same ways we were expected<br/>
to learn in school, i.e. with textbooks, workbooks, lesson plans,<br/>
drills and all the rest. But many avowed unschoolers said they do use<br/>
these handy educational tools, just not always in the ways they were<br/>
originally designed for.<br/>
<br/>
Most unschoolers agree that it goes a little further than<br/>
that, tho, and can mean the entire process of shaking off schoolish<br/>
habits, patterns, and expectations. Of course others will say that<br/>
it&#39;s not a process at all, but just what they do with their kids<br/>
every day. It&#39;s their interactions, their interconnectedness, their<br/>
very lives.<br/>
<br/>
In the Dec/Jan 1995 issue of Growing Without Schooling,<br/>
editor Susannah Sheffer had some interesting comments on the history<br/>
of the word &#39;homeschooling,&#39; and I was surprised to learn that<br/>
unschooling was actually the predecessor of that word. For a long<br/>
time now I&#39;ve thought it was the other way around!<br/>
<br/>
Susannah noted that John Holt had used the word &#39;unschooling&#39;<br/>
in GWS #2, noting &quot;at the beginning Holt simply used it as a synonym<br/>
for what we now call homeschooling.&quot; She adds &quot;By issue #12, which<br/>
I&#39;d date at June 1979, you can see that the magazine was using<br/>
&#39;unschooling&#39; and &#39;homeschooling&#39; pretty much interchangeably, and<br/>
gradually the term &#39;homeschooling&#39; became the more common one.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Grace Llewellyn gives our term an interesting spin in The<br/>
Teenage Liberation Handbook. Throughout the book she prefers the term<br/>
unschooling, explaining early on that it has fewer negative<br/>
connotations than homeschooling. But in Chapter 11, on Legal Issues,<br/>
she writes: &quot;I am shifting my terminology a little. In this chapter,<br/>
I will mostly use the euphemism &#39;homeschooling&#39; rather than<br/>
&#39;unschooling.&#39; &#39;Unschooling&#39; is not a legally recognized term, and<br/>
probably never will be. Don&#39;t use it when you talk to schools,<br/>
courts, or legislators; it will confuse them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, maybe we shouldn&#39;t get our hopes up about getting it<br/>
into the dictionaries.<br/>
<br/>
For that matter, do we even want official dictionary-style<br/>
recognition of the word&#39;s meaning? Unschooling means many things to<br/>
many people... that became quite obvious in the America Online<br/>
discussions. And that&#39;s part of its appeal. Each family, each<br/>
individual, can decide what they want it to mean for themselves<br/>
within a loosely-accepted larger context.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an odd dynamic at work in that once a word is<br/>
defined, it begins to lose its meaning through overuse,<br/>
overpopularity. The word homeschooling, officially recognized for<br/>
some time now, has been showing up in some strange places, most<br/>
notably as what parents do with their children after school and on<br/>
weekends. Because the term is widely recognized and accepted, it&#39;s<br/>
being used to stretch the meaning of other activities, with the very<br/>
real danger that the word&#39;s own original meaning will be completely<br/>
lost.<br/>
<br/>
This has already happened with the term &#39;alternative<br/>
schools.&#39; Where that once meant schools which functioned outside the<br/>
educational bureaucracy, it now also means special public schools for<br/>
kids who don&#39;t fit well into the usual regimen. If one uses the term<br/>
alternative schools but means free schools, or student-participatory<br/>
schools, or any of the other originally accepted definitions, the<br/>
distinction needs to be made clear.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is still a wonderfully nebulous term, subject to<br/>
individual interpretation. Homeschoolers can argue themselves in<br/>
circles about what it means, and that&#39;s as it should be. We need<br/>
words that are vague yet descriptive, changeable while unchanging. In<br/>
much the same way that homeschoolers have taken leave of the<br/>
educational bureaucracy, we&#39;ve taken leave of the English language<br/>
bureaucracy and are exploring new options in communication. We&#39;re<br/>
unschooling in the best sense of the word.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848160706">Made my morning, Lynda, to read your musings as I sat here eating my <br/>
muffets (a Canadian version of Shredded Wheat I always bring back <br/>
from my trips north). Interesting what you wrote about your <br/>
ancestors, as there&#39;s a long streak in my family of not wanting much <br/>
to do with schools and schooling. Again, it wasn&#39;t any &quot;just be happy <br/>
little farmers&quot; attitude, because they weren&#39;t - my grandma was a <br/>
professional musician before she married my grandfather, who was a <br/>
construction foreman on Shasta Dam near Redding. My <br/>
great-great-grandfather was one of the first doctors into Mendocino <br/>
County... but there are many stories in my background of kids leaving <br/>
school at a tender age to get on with life. An uncle left school when <br/>
he was 12 - his father died and he took over running the family farm. <br/>
My dad left school at 14 to work on cars in his uncle&#39;s shop, and at <br/>
16 my grandmother helped him fudge his age so he could join the Army <br/>
with his brothers. My mom quit school at 13 simply because she <br/>
preferred riding her horses through the hills - and her parents never <br/>
made her go back. I remember my grandma once saying that a kid can <br/>
learn a lot more worth knowing from a horse than from a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just getting back up to speed with this list (and many others), <br/>
but it&#39;s nice to see that old familiar friendly conversation going on <br/>
here.<br/>

doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
It is really hard to describe how we unschool or define it without a whole<br/>
history.  I never paid too much attention to rules or gender specific roles<br/>
because we never really had any in our family.  My grandfather taught all us<br/>
girls how to hammer a nail and use a saw.  My dad had no problem with<br/>
teaching us how to rebuild a Harley or letting us help rebuild the engines<br/>
in cars or learning how to do body work.  I learned to box when I was 10<br/>
(that was in the 50s and unheard of) because one of my uncle&#39;s best friends<br/>
was a professional boxer and when I asked about it they showed me.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it was the area I grew up in or maybe I just lucked out by being born<br/>
into several generations of liberated folks.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always been totally &quot;kicked back&quot; and a rebel, so what has become known<br/>
as unschooling came easy, we just didn&#39;t know it had a name for the longest<br/>
time &lt;g&gt;  I think the family motto is &quot;Hey, KEWL&quot; and then we explore.<br/>
<br/>
Today is a typical day for us.  Youngest kidlet (9) got up at about 8.  She<br/>
did exercises (she wants to take gymnastics but decided she wanted to be in<br/>
shape first) which included the weight machine, free weights and floor<br/>
exercises and stretches.  Then she made herself breakfast and played on the<br/>
computer for awhile.  Then she headed outside with Tuff E (new puppy).  They<br/>
fed the rabbit and played chase.  She came in about 12:30 and fixed lunch<br/>
for herself and Tuff E.  Right now she just finished watching a video (Why<br/>
Coyote Has The Best Eyes) and is now watching cartoons.<br/>
<br/>
The boys rolled out of bed about 1.  Eldest son pulled out a writer&#39;s<br/>
handbook and spent about an hour reviewing writing practices.  He&#39;s decided<br/>
that his writing isn&#39;t up to par for college and he is headed off to college<br/>
in the fall.  He then went out and hit the punching bag for a while, then<br/>
played with the puppy, took a shower and called a couple of friends.  They<br/>
all took off for parts unknown.  About an hour ago they stopped back with a<br/>
movie that they thought hubby and I would enjoy watching.<br/>
<br/>
Middle kidlet futzed on the computer for a while and the curled up in the<br/>
sun with a book while grumbling that he wished the woman that wrote the<br/>
Harry Potter books would get her arse in gear and get the next one<br/>
published.  Later he went out and practiced punting a football.  He hasn&#39;t<br/>
decided if he will try out for the high school team next year or the Pop<br/>
Warner team or if he will just make a video when he is older and send it to<br/>
NFL scouts.<br/>
<br/>
Hubby transplanted a tree for me earlier, then went shopping and is now<br/>
watching Rosie or Oprah.<br/>
<br/>
I worked on a deposition for a ADA case against the state this morning and<br/>
now I&#39;m up here in my VIP space pounding away at this machine &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday was completely different and tomorrow will be too.  Although, I<br/>
have been informed (3 different times, by 3 different people, in 3 different<br/>
ways &lt;g&gt;) that it is time to get busy in the garden so I guess that means we<br/>
will probably all be out in the garden tomorrow.  Which reminds me, I was<br/>
suppose to be looking for blue flowers that smell good on the net.  Anyone<br/>
know of any that are blue AND smell good?<br/>
<br/>
So how do I define it?  I don&#39;t.  Definitions are too constraining.  It<br/>
grows and changes as do we.<br/>

Hi Mary,<br/>
 Puddles came about because we had acquired a new puppy (Jenni.. golden<br/>
retriever) and she left little puddles all over the place :(. Also, after<br/>
giving birth to a 10+ lb baby, I can create a few &#39;puddles&#39; myself when I<br/>
sneeze ( I can&#39;t stand allergy season!). So the kidlets were making fun<br/>
about the problem the puppy and I share and the name just evolved. My &#39;real&#39;<br/>
nickname is Queenie and it came about because some friends, realizing I<br/>
needed a boost, delegated me to that imaginary status. Being an imaginary<br/>
position, I also acquired imaginary &#39;power&#39; worth about the size of this<br/>
dot--&gt; . It&#39;s been amazing to see how some people see the name and assume I<br/>
have a superiority complex %-/ when, in fact, it is quite the opposite.<br/>
