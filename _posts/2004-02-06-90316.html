I have four children and I try to be and unschooler, like follow their lead<br/>
rd time reading out loud to any of  my children for one big<br/>
reason and that is because English is my second language and I have a heavy<br/>
accent. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say read books to them in your OWN language. They&#39;ll pick up the English <br/>
from around them. They&#39;re surrounded by it! <br/>
<br/>
Let them HEAR your wonderful mother tongue, and WOW everyone with your <br/>
children&#39;s abilities in TWO languages!<br/>
