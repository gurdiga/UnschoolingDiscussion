That&#39;s odd talk for an unschooler (to paraphrase Ned Pepper).<br/>

I have a Master&#39;s degree in Clinical Psychology.  I ran parenting classes.<br/>
I worked with children for almost 15 years and had training out the wazoo.<br/>

It about ruined me as a parent.  Not that I&#39;m a fan of Dr. Laura&#39;s.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012803424">Being an unschooler has nothing to do with expecting folks who present<br/>
themselves as experts to at least have some clue about what they are doing<br/>
AND to not use inuendos or false assumptions to pad their credibility.<br/>
<br/>
What not-a-doc does would be the same as you doing brain surgery.  You don&#39;t<br/>
dissect a psychi using a scalpel, do you? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
