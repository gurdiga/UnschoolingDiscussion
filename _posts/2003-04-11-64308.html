&gt; <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t want to be sprayed, he&#39;d be inside and sitting far from water <br/>
&gt; hearing <br/>
&gt; what I thought about it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He knew what I thought about it.  The facet was attached to the house.  I was <br/>
out in the front yard.  We talked about how there are certain times that <br/>
grown ups don&#39;t want to play at all.<br/>
<br/>
Bonnie was a fun neighbor, often they wet each other when they were both <br/>
watering at the same time.  It was a game, he really learned on his own that <br/>
it isn&#39;t always a good thing to share your water with someone.<br/>
<br/>
He sat pretty silently while we all ran around trying to remedy the situation <br/>
and it all came together.  He was sad he had created such confusion and when <br/>
we talked about it, he just said he couldn&#39;t help it, he NEEDED to do it.  <br/>
<br/>
He needed to do it because he didn&#39;t know the consequences, he needed that <br/>
FUN moment.  Afterwards he saw what happened because of it, he NEVER did that <br/>
again.  I&#39;m sure he had opportunity because we were always gardening and <br/>
watering (those lovely HOA gardening contests) but he didn&#39;t.  He learned his <br/>
lesson.  No spanking involved, no punishment from me involved.  The fact he <br/>
made Bonnie sad and upset was enough for him to know it wasn&#39;t a good thing.<br/>
