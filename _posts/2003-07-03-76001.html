<div id="ygrps-yiv-813914190">Hi Kate,<br/>
<br/>
I agree with what Mary said. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a thing wrong with your<br/>
daughter. Some children still breast feed at 5. Perhaps unuasual, but still,<br/>
in some cultures it happens. She is so little! It sounds as though she&#39;s<br/>
just fine and oh so normal.<br/>
<br/>
Your MIL on the other hand, appears to have issues. Why all the focus on<br/>
your daughter? Her own guilt being triggered??? Sounds like it.  It reminds<br/>
me of my mother who is jealous,  childish,  narcissistic, and very<br/>
threatened by anyone who gets more attention than she does. Who would want<br/>
to sit on someone&#39;s lap who is so obviously a bully? You have a smart kid<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Whoever it was that said they pack up and leave when someone mistreats her<br/>
children, I applaud you. No child should be forced to tolerate such a creep,<br/>
family or not.<br/>
<br/>
My mother has pulled this with me before with not only myself, but my son as<br/>
well. She will accuse or point the finger, lie, whatever immature behavior<br/>
to  attempt to take the focus off of her own behavior and bully. Needless to<br/>
say, we rarely see the woman.<br/>
<br/>
Go with your heart. Tell that old wench to lay off and mind her own<br/>
business. Your daughter is just fine and as any healthy child, chooses only<br/>
to sit on the laps of loving and kind individuals. I&#39;m sure if her heart was<br/>
in the right place, your daughter would be all over her. Ah, blessed is the<br/>
wisdom of children.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the passionate reaction, but really...What rude nasty things your<br/>
MIL  has said. Not very loving. I sure as hell wouldn&#39;t want to be in the<br/>
same building with someone like that, let alone have physical contact.<br/>
<br/>
Be strong Kate!<br/>
