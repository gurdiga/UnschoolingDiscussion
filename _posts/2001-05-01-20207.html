<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652957710">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t post much but read every digest.  I am so glad Valerie and Laurie found this list.  It is great to know that my gut is right.  At first, we met with much opposition(they said, what did I know, Dana was only 27 months old - I would change my mind - now she is 5 and a half) with family, etc.  But now, I could give a whiz about anyone else&#39;s thoughts on our learning process.  Last week, my mom, Dana and I went on a short little vacation - my mother is now the biggest unschooling fan.  She witnessed Dana doing math calculations in her head, sounding out words and was duly impressed with her emotional abilities.  She says she takes back all the worries and she had and is quite impressed with what she sees Dana do.  Mind you, we still do not have &quot;formal&quot; lessons.  If Dana wants a workbook, I buy one, if she wants me to print out worksheets I do, and she will do 30-40 at a time - asking me questions when needed.  This is truly a wonderful experience we are having and I wouldn&#39;t change it for the world.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the inlaws still don&#39;t get it, but they aren&#39;t worthy of my concern =) that&#39;s a whole other not worth repeating story.<br/>
<br/>
Valerie, can&#39;t wait for the book.  Laurie, you should tour unschooling conventions and seminars!  To all others, thank you for being here, you have been my rock.<br/>
<br/>
With warmest regards, <br/>
Karen Mowery<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-183701834">Thank you Karen. I am really so glad to give all of you the security <br/>
of knowing you are doing the right thing. Bravo for your mom! It took <br/>
my mom 18 years to see it, and she only saw it then when Laurie did <br/>
well in college (oh well, at least she finally saw it). <br/>
<br/>
How do we find out about unschooling conventions and seminars? I <br/>
wasn&#39;t even aware of them.<br/>

HEM? on-line?) that when she did a show on homeschooling she was so stuck in<br/>
the &quot;what about friends?&quot; mindset that she couldn&#39;t open up her eyes and see<br/>
that these kids in front of her were happy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-583482237">Knock me down with a feather... there are unschooling support <br/>
groups??? (other than this one of course)  I am amazed at how far <br/>
this has come in 15 years... Is there any way I can get on a mailing <br/>
list?  Or would you guys tell me when you hear of a <br/>
seminar/convention? Laurie and I need to attend all that we can.<br/>

most people sometimes forgets to question authority or question the way <br/>
something is done just because its been done &quot;forever&quot;. I suspect its that <br/>
way with homeschooling. . . she doesnt know anyone who does it any other way <br/>
and has probably never thought much about it. I have heard her say on many <br/>
occasions that being a parent is the hardest job in the world. . . I <br/>
personally dont  find it hard at all. . . it certainly has its challenges <br/>
like anything else, but hard is not a word I would use to describe it. I <br/>
think a John Holt book like &quot;Escape from Childhood&quot; would be a good book for <br/>
her to read.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-989352125">I agree about parenting not being difficult. I found it to be the <br/>
most natural and rewarding thing I ever did (and am still doing). And <br/>
being an unschooling parent...well, life doesn&#39;t get any easier.<br/>
