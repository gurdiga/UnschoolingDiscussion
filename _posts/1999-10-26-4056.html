<div id="ygrps-yiv-895797091">Hi, Helen!<br/>
<br/>
We live in New York, and for reporting purposes (and assessment purposes)<br/>
we use Clonlara School.  Some unschoolers loathe them, others love them.<br/>
<br/>
We have found them to be helpful to us.  <br/>
<br/>
They offer a curriculum, but they suggest families modifiy it to their own<br/>
needs.  Also, they do believe in a child led learning, and learning through<br/>
life experiences.  They do not &quot;believe&quot; in text books (per se), but<br/>
respect a families choice to use them.<br/>
<br/>
Clonlara not only assists homeschoolers, but has a private accredited<br/>
school as well, which gives them some credability.<br/>
<br/>
They offer a high school diploma (which some recognize, others don&#39;t.  But<br/>
for answering relatives, and the world in general, you can say they are<br/>
graduating through a private school.  As for colleges, you may still want<br/>
to go for the GED, or just take those SAT&#39;s - depends on the school.)  Your<br/>
children can even tell folks they are enrolled in Clonlara school, without<br/>
lying, if they are being hassled.  (we have always told people that we are<br/>
homeschoolers, and our son says it proudly.  We are thinking of just saying<br/>
we are enrolled with a private school, because we have already had busy<br/>
bodies report us to social services, because we homeschool!  We&#39;re getting<br/>
tired of the hassle.)<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, IF it becomes important for your children to attend a graduation,<br/>
Clonlara has a graduation each year, for their graduating students.  I&#39;ve<br/>
heard wonderful things of it.  I&#39;ve heard some unschoolers denounce this<br/>
practice.  Personally, I feel it depends on the child&#39;s desire.  I have a<br/>
friend who has her children enrolled in Clonlara.  So far, one wants to go<br/>
for the ceremony, the other has no desire for it.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, if your interested (or just want to inquire), Clonlara&#39;s phone<br/>
number, addres, and web page are:<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m trying to examine all the options.  My main concern is how to deal with<br/>
inlaws, friends and other curious people who all seem to need answers.  As<br/>
I said,<br/>
my girls are 13 and 15, and I&#39;m starting to feel the pressure.<br/>
<br/>
The way it looks, our only options are public school (NOT),<br/>
correspondence(WAY to<br/>
much paperwork--I could go on and on about this one), and GED, or--<br/>
nothing.<br/>
<br/>
 Did you do anything special to prepare your boys for the GED?<br/>
