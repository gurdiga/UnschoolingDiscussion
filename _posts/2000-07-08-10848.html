I read everyone&#39;s responses, I kept say &quot;hey, we do that&quot; or &quot;yeah, me too&quot;.  <br/>
Toddlers are extremely frustrating:  )  :  )  We do all the tricks mentioned <br/>
depending on the day and the effectivness.  If one doesn&#39;t work, I try <br/>
another.  I have found that if my dd wants to do or go somewhere that is the <br/>
best time to get her to clean up.  I usually say &quot;We can&#39;t do .....because <br/>
all the toys need to go to their homes first, &quot;until we put the toys away, we <br/>
can&#39;t do.....&quot;  Part of the time, this works.  Sometimes, my dd changes her <br/>
mind about do whatever, just to avoid cleaning up.<br/>
<br/>
I think part of our problem is my own discipline or lack of it, I should say.<br/>

can do [activity of choice] ... after we [clean up<br/>
this, calm down, take a nap, etc.].&quot; I have a little<br/>
doorknob hangy-thing that talks about ways to love a<br/>
child. One of the things is, &quot;Say yes as often as<br/>
possible.&quot; I try to make sure most of what I say is a<br/>
&quot;Yes&quot; without making it seem like there are no<br/>
attendant responsibilities to privileges.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you are right-I have friends who are neat freaks, and they still <br/>
have clean houses with or without kids. I think the secret is that you have <br/>
to be a nag. My friend and her dh would always be on thier kids to put the <br/>
toys away. They could never lay anything down and walk away-coats, shoes, <br/>
books, toys-always had to put it away. She also throws everthing away. I <br/>
used to be shocked at how few toys her kids had. But, her house is always <br/>
neat. It seems like it really didn&#39;t take too long either-a few years of <br/>
being a nagging b#$%h really paid off-I just can&#39;t ever seem to do it <br/>
though.<br/>

Nice Moms finish messy, I guess.<br/>
