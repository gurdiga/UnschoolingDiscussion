<div id="ygrps-yiv-226793312">At the pet store near me I was told that there is either food or something <br/>
you put on the food that reduces the musky smell and I also know that washing <br/>
them frequently helps reduce the odor. I wonder if the aerosol spray doggy <br/>
deoderant would help in between bathing?!I would imagine keeping their cage <br/>
very clean ( the ones in the store used a litter box) would help as well!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853565650">When I was doing research on ferrets I found that there are a lot of them<br/>
in local animal shelters.  I just wanted to send out the idea to those<br/>
who have said they are interested to call the shelter near them.  I<br/>
checked out Portland&#39;s web site and they had 3 different pairs, all of<br/>
them stated how friendly and docile they were.  You might be able to<br/>
avoid a lot of behavior problems by getting some that are already<br/>
socialized.<br/>
