&gt; **************************************************************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dear Reader,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The phrase &quot;Not enough children are getting drugs,&quot; should<br/>
&gt; not be used by radio reporters while I&#39;m driving a car. It<br/>
&gt; could be hazardous to other drivers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last week I was listening to Morning Edition on National<br/>
&gt; Public Radio (NPR) while driving to work. And when I heard<br/>
&gt; the beginning of a report on the use of medication to treat<br/>
&gt; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), I should<br/>
&gt; have pulled over to the shoulder of the road and turned off<br/>
&gt; the car so that I could talk back (shout back!) to the radio<br/>
&gt; without endangering my fellow motorists.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m happy to say that I got to work without plowing my car<br/>
&gt; into anyone else. That&#39;s the good news. The bad news: Even<br/>
&gt; though hundreds of thousands of children are being given<br/>
&gt; pharmaceuticals to treat ADHD, there are &quot;experts&quot; out there<br/>
&gt; who are convinced that our kids are under-medicated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now aren&#39;t you glad you weren&#39;t driving a car when you read<br/>
&gt; that last sentence?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt; Dreaming up diseases<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The NPR report was part of a series on mental illness in<br/>
&gt; children. But does ADHD really qualify as a mental illness?<br/>
&gt; In the most extreme cases, possibly. But I wholeheartedly<br/>
&gt; agree with a Brandeis University medical sociologist named<br/>
&gt; Peter Conrad who told NPR that the American medical<br/>
&gt; establishment has come to regard normal human differences as<br/>
&gt; medical problems - such as judging a child to have a disease<br/>
&gt; because he doesn&#39;t pay as close attention as the kid in the<br/>
&gt; next desk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And you know what we do with a disease in this country: We<br/>
&gt; medicate it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In direct counterpoint to Mr. Conrad&#39;s clear thinking, the<br/>
&gt; NPR piece also featured Columbia University psychiatrist<br/>
&gt; Peter Jensen who believes that only half the kids with ADHD<br/>
&gt; are being properly medicated. So if Mr. Jensen had his way,<br/>
&gt; the number of U.S. kids taking an ADHD medication would<br/>
&gt; roughly equal the entire population of Ireland. That&#39;s well<br/>
&gt; over 3 million.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mr. Jensen is particularly pleased with a National Institutes<br/>
&gt; of Mental Health (NIMH) study that compared the effectiveness<br/>
&gt; of behavior modification to medication in treating ADHD. The<br/>
&gt; behavior modification proved to be useful, but medication was<br/>
&gt; found to be more effective. Case closed, says Mr. Jensen.<br/>
&gt; Time to medicate those 1.5+ million stragglers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But psychologist William Pelham says, not so fast. Both<br/>
&gt; Pelham and Jensen participated in the NIMH study, and Mr.<br/>
&gt; Pelham points out that other studies (ones that didn&#39;t simply<br/>
&gt; compare a behavior modification group to a medication group)<br/>
&gt; have found that more than half of ADHD subjects may be<br/>
&gt; successfully treated with behavior modification alone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No doubt, the concept of trying behavior modification before<br/>
&gt; resorting to drugs is going to be a hard sell to the medical<br/>
&gt; establishment. But there&#39;s still a critical element missing<br/>
&gt; from both of these treatment options.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt; Oh behave!<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The behavior modification techniques described in the NPR<br/>
&gt; report don&#39;t include diet modification. And that&#39;s a huge<br/>
&gt; omission.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the e-Alert &quot;How to Dismantle an &#39;89 Ford&quot; (6/3/02), HSI<br/>
&gt; Panelist Allan Spreen, M.D., told us how he had successfully<br/>
&gt; treated hyperactive children with a two-step process: 1) by<br/>
&gt; discovering and removing food allergies, and 2) by enhancing<br/>
&gt; nutrition. The drawback to this process is that it&#39;s more<br/>
&gt; difficult to strictly modify a child&#39;s diet than it is to<br/>
&gt; have a prescription filled. And dietary changes take time. A<br/>
&gt; pill is a quick fix. But that quick fix comes with possible<br/>
&gt; side effects as well as long-range problems.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the June 2002 e-Alert, Dr. Spreen wrote: &quot;It&#39;s amazing how<br/>
&gt; many hyperactive children are chemically sensitive. The trick<br/>
&gt; is finding out what the sensitivity is. Food allergies are<br/>
&gt; chemical sensitivities, and they must be ruled out first.<br/>
&gt; This starts by cutting out the historic offenders - milk (or<br/>
&gt; other dairy), wheat, corn, soy, peanut, and adding to the<br/>
&gt; list anything (ANYTHING) that the child craves (or just<br/>
&gt; insists on eating everyday).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Bear in mind also that sugar is a chemical. It&#39;s purified<br/>
&gt; and concentrated to a point w-a-a-a-y beyond what our bodies<br/>
&gt; were genetically designed to comfortably handle, and blood<br/>
&gt; sugar swings resulting from its use can absolutely have an<br/>
&gt; impact on behavior. Improvement can be absolutely amazing,<br/>
&gt; and then maddening to discover that so much control was<br/>
&gt; available from within the refrigerator.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt; Add nutrients<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once a child&#39;s diet is purged of aggravating factors, there<br/>
&gt; are important nutrients that can help calm hyperactivity. Dr.<br/>
&gt; Spreen recommends vitamin C in high doses (a &quot;great<br/>
&gt; detoxifier&quot;) as well as alpha lipoic acid; used in<br/>
&gt; conjunction with a good basic multi-vitamin/mineral regimen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dr. Spreen adds, &quot;Most ADHD kids have deficient diets, and<br/>
&gt; essential fatty acids (important for proper nerve formation<br/>
&gt; and conduction) are often undersupplied. Fish oil<br/>
&gt; supplements, along with extra vitamin E to assist in its<br/>
&gt; metabolism, can be very helpful. Sometimes, magnesium (in<br/>
&gt; doses not high enough to loosen stools) can be a big calmer<br/>
&gt; in the mineral department, and certain amino acid-type<br/>
&gt; supplements like GABA and L-tryptophan can be amazingly<br/>
&gt; effective. However, get educated by starting at the<br/>
&gt; beginning and don&#39;t quit until you have the answer.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt; Option one<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The NPR report quotes a Johns Hopkins psychiatrist named<br/>
&gt; Daniel Safer who notes that over many years of treating<br/>
&gt; children with ADHD he&#39;s seen the attitude of parents change.<br/>
&gt; Where parents were once cautious about medicating their<br/>
&gt; children, many are now quite willing to request a<br/>
&gt; prescription for Ritalin. Several factors have contributed to<br/>
&gt; this change in attitude. In 1991, for instance, the U.S.<br/>
&gt; Office of Education officially identified ADHD as a condition<br/>
&gt; qualifying a child for special education. And there&#39;s no<br/>
&gt; doubt that the direct advertising of prescription drugs has<br/>
&gt; made our culture much more comfortable with the idea of<br/>
&gt; solving problems with pharmaceuticals.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And now there&#39;s a new drug that&#39;s making the decision to<br/>
&gt; medicate just that much easier. Strattera is a non-stimulant<br/>
&gt; ADHD medication introduced by Eli Lilly less than a year ago.<br/>
&gt; And it&#39;s selling like gangbusters. One million prescriptions<br/>
&gt; for Strattera were written between November 2002 and June<br/>
&gt; 2003. The fact that Lilly can back up a new product with a<br/>
&gt; formidable international marketing effort has a lot to do<br/>
&gt; with these huge sales. But an ADHD drug that doesn&#39;t mimic<br/>
&gt; amphetamines (as Ritalin does) is probably very attractive to<br/>
&gt; parents.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But is it safer? That&#39;s hard to answer. Like Ritalin, the<br/>
&gt; long-range effects of Strattera are still a question mark.<br/>
&gt; And Strattera&#39;s most common side effects (mood swings,<br/>
&gt; dizziness, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and<br/>
&gt; tiredness) read like the symptoms of a disease. Does that<br/>
&gt; sound like the best way to help kids get focused?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dr. Spreen sums up the ADHD situation with this<br/>
&gt; comment: &quot;Never assume that drugs are the only answer.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I would add to that: As effective as it may be in<br/>
&gt; treating ADHD, behavior modification isn&#39;t complete without<br/>
&gt; modification of the diet as well.<br/>

&gt; .. and another thing<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You don&#39;t really need another reason to increase your vitamin<br/>
&gt; C intake, but here&#39;s one anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Researchers at the University of Manchester and the Institute<br/>
&gt; of Public Health at Cambridge University examined data from<br/>
&gt; an 8-year population survey of almost 25,000 subjects to<br/>
&gt; analyze the association between rheumatoid arthritis and<br/>
&gt; vitamin C intake through fruit and vegetable consumption.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Only 73 subjects developed rheumatoid arthritis, and their<br/>
&gt; diets had one common denominator: low intake of fresh fruits<br/>
&gt; and vegetables. Exactly how these foods protect the body from<br/>
&gt; this debilitating, inflammatory disease will require further<br/>
&gt; research.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Without question, a daily orange, apple, carrot, and banana<br/>
&gt; will do most of us quite a bit of good. And munching them may<br/>
&gt; just let us cross rheumatoid arthritis off our list of things<br/>
&gt; to worry about.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Everyone has occasional trouble sleeping - and sleep problems<br/>
&gt; generally increase as we age. But even occasional sleep<br/>
&gt; problems can damage your health and make you old before your<br/>
&gt; time. Here&#39;s some good news, though. New research shows that<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s possible to:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  * Easily enter a state of deep, restful sleep whenever you<br/>
&gt;    want.<br/>
&gt;  * Regain the natural ability to sleep soundly.<br/>
&gt;  * Regain the ability to produce vital life enhancing<br/>
&gt;    substances at the same (or even higher) levels as you did<br/>
&gt;    when you were much younger.<br/>

It was interesting, but hey----they didn&#39;t suggest just NOT expecting the <br/>
kids to sit in desks and pay attention, only recommended changing their diets so <br/>
that would be easier to do. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
