<div id="ygrps-yiv-509771735">I just told Lexie that one of her friends that she usually sees on park <br/>
days was going back to school.  She sobbed.  She cried. She was very <br/>
upset.  When will I see her again?  This is horrid.  After I calmed her <br/>
down and promised that we&#39;d continue contact on weekends, she said &quot;when <br/>
does this stupid school season start anyway?!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We went up to Ventura today (2 1/2 hours away) to go to the University <br/>
of New Mexico Alumni Picnic.  They had brought in green chili from New <br/>
Mexico.  The price was even pretty good, and they roasted it for us.  We <br/>
put it in bags but left the peel on.  Tonight I spent 3 hours peeling 40 <br/>
pounds of green chili.  Oh my fingers burn so good.  My new van now <br/>
smells like green chili.  I purposely stood by the roaster so as to <br/>
smell it.  Lots of other folks were doing that too.  I sure miss the <br/>
smell of New Mexico in the fall.  I&#39;m sure that most of you who are not <br/>
from New Mexico have no idea what I&#39;m taking about (the burn of my <br/>
fingers, the smell of the chili, the entire bottom half of the freezer <br/>
filled with little plastic freezer bags of peeled green chili (I typed <br/>
children there...is my slip showing?) but It was a good evening.  Janene <br/>
and Lexie actually helped peel a bit.  My lecture to them is &quot;glad to <br/>
have your help, watch me peel this one, once you start peeling, please, <br/>
do not rub your eyes, do not pick your nose.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
RIGHT AWAY I thought &quot;She shouldn&#39;t have peeled it all at once!&quot; and then you <br/>
said you got burned fingers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised (and happy!) to learn that if you freeze it roasted and <br/>
unpeeled, then thaw it, the peels just about slide off.  So if you have <br/>
sufficient freezer space, you can peel just some (before the fingers start to <br/>
sting) and then freeze the rest whole.<br/>
<br/>
How cool that there is a little bit of UNM available there for you!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204247388">Roy has been inventing new holidays so that other kids<br/>
can be out of school more :-) He has TV Day, Present<br/>
Day, Trick Day, Reverse Day, Nothing Day, Regular<br/>
Holiday, No Day, Do What Roy Says Day and I&#39;ll have to<br/>
ask him the rest when he wakes up...He made a list<br/>
last night while I was reading to him<br/>
(late...midnight)<br/>
<br/>
Peppers (chili, green chili, banana, jalepeno, red,<br/>
bell,etc) areedible  one of the few things that<br/>
actually do well here. They do smell good, and the<br/>
squirrels don&#39;t seem to like them :-) I have<br/>
transplanted the plants to five gallon buckets and<br/>
kept them for several years, peppers all year with the<br/>
winter in the greenhouse-porch. Roy has been creating<br/>
new hot-sauces, and labeling them. One is Lava Sauce,<br/>
the label has a volcano on it, the sauce itself is<br/>
very thick, like molten lava. DH uses that one a lot.<br/>
Not me....it is TOO hot.<br/>
