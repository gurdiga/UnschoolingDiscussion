<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318323899">I had reverse weather depression too!  When I lived in the SW, I just loved <br/>
the monsoon season, and looked forward to February when there were a few days <br/>
of clouds!  I just loved the hot nights--could never tire of those!  It&#39;s <br/>
depressing too, to shield yourself inside and away from the sun day after day <br/>
with heavy blinds and drapes--sheers cut a lot of the glare for me--but I <br/>
didn&#39;t care for the look.  <br/>
<br/>
We recently moved to the Midwest (Iowa) and for the last two winters have <br/>
longed for snow (last year we got 2 snowstorms that both melted within a <br/>
week....). Dh and I dreamt of having a picture perfect midwestern life for <br/>
our kids--yo know, a white holiday season, sledding, cozy eves by the <br/>
fireplace and all.   When we got here, I ran out in anticipation and bought <br/>
each of us coats, boots, mittens, hats, snowpants, sleds, shovels, and other <br/>
paraphenelia.  The kids will have outgrown everything by next season--and <br/>
they&#39;ve worn it all MAYBE 3 times..........Well, today it is in the 50s <br/>
believe it or not, and we haven&#39;t had a flake all year!   I could--if I <br/>
wanted to--uh, rake...<br/>

If you want guaranteed snow you could move to NE North Dakota.  We usually<br/>
have snow in early October, which may melt, but by this time of year it is<br/>
going to stay until April.  I would be very willing to trade places, lol.<br/>
Actually, I don&#39;t mind the snow (from a distance), I am just afraid slipping<br/>
on the ice.  My children have been ice-skating everyday this week on an<br/>
outdoor rink in our very small town (300) and loving it because the<br/>
temperatures have been in the twenties!  (Today was actually in the low 30&#39;s<br/>
though).  By February, we should be having a bunch of 20 below days.  Feel<br/>
free to come, lol.<br/>
<br/>
many blessings,<br/>

I live in Munich(really small town), it is about 45 minutes north of Devil&#39;s<br/>
Lake.  No there is no unschooling group!  In fact, I don&#39;t even know anyone<br/>
who I am brave enough to tell about unschooling, lol.  The support group we<br/>
go to is in Devil&#39;s Lake, and they are most die-hard school at home, (like<br/>
video Abeka).  They have looked at me askance for years, when I told them<br/>
things like I don&#39;t give grades and there is basically nothing in that<br/>
cumulative file I am suppose to have.  I have the file, just don&#39;t put<br/>
anything in it!  I am really afraid to tell even my closest homeschooling<br/>
friends.  Of course, this is somewhat new, though I have ALWAYS been<br/>
considerably more relaxed than most.<br/>
<br/>
If you have an unschooling group there let me know.  I would love to meet<br/>
some unschoolers in person.  I never have.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Oh,  Erin,   bummer,   I feel the same way,  I&#39;ll e-mail you privately.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I know there has got to be thousands of unschoolers out there,  but<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; do feel like they have to be cautious and I understand why,  it just it so<br/>
&gt; aggravating because it would be so nice to have a group.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m working, thinking through,  how to get a group together up north<br/>
here.<br/>
&gt; Although you are about 4 hours from me,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll be in touch,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; I live in Munich(really small town), it is about 45 minutes north of<br/>
&gt; Devil&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lake.  No there is no unschooling group!  In fact, I don&#39;t even know<br/>
&gt; anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; who I am brave enough to tell about unschooling, lol.  The support group<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; go to is in Devil&#39;s Lake, and they are most die-hard school at home,<br/>
(like<br/>
&gt; &gt; video Abeka).  They have looked at me askance for years, when I told<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; &gt; things like I don&#39;t give grades and there is basically nothing in that<br/>
&gt; &gt; cumulative file I am suppose to have.  I have the file, just don&#39;t put<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything in it!  I am really afraid to tell even my closest<br/>
homeschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; friends.  Of course, this is somewhat new, though I have ALWAYS been<br/>
&gt; &gt; considerably more relaxed than most.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you have an unschooling group there let me know.  I would love to<br/>
meet<br/>
&gt; &gt; some unschoolers in person.  I never have.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; many blessings,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Where in ND do you live?  (Besides NE?)   Is there an unschooling<br/>
group<br/>
&gt; &gt; there?   I&#39;m only 2 1/2 hours from ND,   we are over in Fargo-Moorhead<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; &gt; the time.   Grandmas and Grandpas all live over there.<br/>
