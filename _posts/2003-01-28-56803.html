14. Behind the Name: The Etymology and History of First Names<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.behindthename.com/">http://www.behindthename.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Created by Mike Campbell, a Canadian with a great interest in<br/>
linguistics, this site is a cornucopia of information about the<br/>
etymologies of first names. Containing information on over 11,000 first<br/>
names, users can begin by entering their own first name into the search<br/>
engine (which can be customized), and information will be returned about<br/>
the origin of the name and other helpful details. From the site&#39;s home<br/>
page, users can also click on a number of topical headings, such as<br/>
Spanish Names or Biblical Names to see an entire list of names related<br/>
to these cultures or themes. Also helpful are a series of short essays<br/>
on the general origins of first names, names by usage, and elements of<br/>
first names. Users can both post questions to the message boards<br/>
provided on the site and view lists of the most popular names by year,<br/>
going all the way back to the year 1900. [KMG]<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>

me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
