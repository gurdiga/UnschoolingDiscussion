&gt; Yes, but I don&#39;t know how helpful it would be.  If you&#39;ve ever had raw<br/>
cow&#39;s<br/>
&gt; milk, you know that the taste between that and the stuff you get at the<br/>
store<br/>
&gt; is pretty drastically different!  But, go to the cooking aisle at the<br/>
grocery<br/>
&gt; store, canned milk section and you&#39;ll probably find a box or can of goat&#39;s<br/>
&gt; milk.  They may also have it fresh in the dairy section.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was raised on goat&#39;s milk.  From 6 yr&#39;s old, I helped with the care of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; goats.  By 10 they were my job entirely...including milking, veterinary<br/>
care<br/>
&gt; and birthing.  It is much easier to handle the care of a goat than a<br/>
&gt; cow...especially if you want the whole family involved.  Also, goat&#39;s milk<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; often easier to digest than cow&#39;s.  If allergies are an issue in your<br/>
family,<br/>
&gt; you may get ahead even more by avoiding allergens in the goats feed.  Be<br/>
&gt; careful what you feed the goat because the milk flavor changes (i.e. give<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; lots of peaches or peach peels and you&#39;ll get milk that tastes much<br/>
different<br/>
&gt; than fed only on grain and hay!). (they do like the glue on the<br/>
&gt; cans and can be a friendly lot, which leads to &#39;nibbling&#39; on people.  I<br/>
never<br/>
&gt; received any more injury from a goat than getting my foot stepped on and<br/>
&gt; bruised...once.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t bother keeping a billy goat on the same property with a nanny!  The<br/>
&gt; billy goat hormones/phermones will cause the milk to smell and taste<br/>
&gt; different...it can be quite nasty.  Besides you only need a billy around<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; breeding...for that you can transport the nanny for a visit to a local<br/>
&gt; breeder or artificial inseminate.  Believe me, billy goats smell!  Nannies<br/>
&gt; only are not at all bad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been out of town (and on no mail) for a few days...so if this little<br/>
&gt; rant of mine has nothing at all to do with the current thread...my<br/>
apologies!<br/>
&gt;  It&#39;ll either be the start of a new one or cheerfully (I hope!) ignored.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-74693950">The kidlets had about 30 goats.  The liked the La Mancha&#39;s the best because<br/>
of their personality.  The Nubians and the large white goats were their<br/>
least favorites and they sold them off.  Nubians are noisy and whiney (yes,<br/>
goats can whine &lt;g&gt;) and the white ones were pushy.<br/>
<br/>
They had very few vet bills.  They recommended that you get one that has<br/>
been dehorned as a goat will use its horns if it has them.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as to Amy&#39;s question/comment, we never had any problems with them<br/>
being with the other livestock or pets.  The barn cats use to sleep with<br/>
them at night and the chickens were forever under their feet.  As to dogs,<br/>
well, they made a wide berth of all the livestock as most will thump dogs<br/>
if they get a chance, particularly rams and bucks.  Cows with calves and<br/>
horses with foals will attack them and donkeys are reknown for hating dogs.<br/>
<br/>
I think people think goats eat tin cans because they will eat the labels<br/>
off them &lt;g&gt;  They are like little kids and will try anything.  Also, don&#39;t<br/>
hang your laundry or anything else you don&#39;t want chewed on or<br/>
investigated!  Curiousity may have killed the cat, but I think the goats<br/>
got there first %-}<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We had different breeds of goats for 10+ years and never had problems with <br/>
other animals and goats.  Kept the chickens and goats in the same enclosure <br/>
and still had eggs and milk and no bad encounters between the goats and <br/>
chickens.<br/>
<br/>
I would definitely keep the goats in a penned area (if you can!  We had some <br/>
that were escape artists!)  Generally they are quite smart and very <br/>
inquisitive.<br/>
<br/>
We had very few vet bills with our goats.  In fact, I don&#39;t recall ever <br/>
having them go to the vet.  Occasional sores that would fester and need <br/>
attention (clean it out and apply tobacco was our solution), keep their feet <br/>
trimmed, brush them daily (we did it just before putting them on the milking <br/>
stand...not sure if it was for the good of the goat or to keep the hairs out <br/>
of the milk, but definitely knew when I hadn&#39;t done a good job before hand <br/>
because of how much hair got into the milk!).  Birthing, of course.  Never <br/>
had any problems with any of those either.  Allowed the kids to nurse for a <br/>
short time (week or two), then bottle fed the kids which were sold, given <br/>
away or fattened for slaughter.  I don&#39;t recall any deaths of kids at <br/>
birthing and we only had one occasion where we needed to put down an adult.  <br/>
You can get vaccinations, antibiotics and other health care supplies at the <br/>
local feed store and do all that yourself, if you are willing.<br/>
<br/>
I guess a lot depends on how much of a do-it-yourselfer you are.<br/>
