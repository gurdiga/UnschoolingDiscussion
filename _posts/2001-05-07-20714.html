<div id="ygrps-yiv-492335131">You might try telling him that you and your daughter do not like being<br/>
around someone who pushes  people and snatches their things away and remove<br/>
yourself from the room he is in EVERY time that it happens. Do not give him<br/>
attention for doing something that you don&#39;t like.   Let him be alone for as<br/>
long as it takes to agitate him.  He seems to be looking for attention.  Why<br/>
is that do you think?  Does he feel that his sister takes some of the<br/>
attention from him?  Is there a way that you could do something with him<br/>
that is special like play games when his sister is sleeping?  I am sorry<br/>
that this is happening to you. It sounds frustrating.  Hope you figure out<br/>
something. I am sure there will be lots of good ideas here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-60933795">Have you talked to him about reasons that he might be<br/>
doing this?  You probably have to suggest possible<br/>
reasons; 4yr olds have trouble assessing and<br/>
verbalizing their own feelings.  At one and a half,<br/>
his sister is still young enough to be resented for<br/>
the special attention, and old enough to interfere<br/>
with his own independent pursuits... a particularly<br/>
annoying combination.  Especially since girls seem to<br/>
be more people-pleasing, and so get more strokes<br/>
generally and fewer negative feedbacks than boys do. <br/>
*You* might understand that this may have a direct<br/>
correlation to apparently controllable behavior on his<br/>
part, but chances are your 4 yr old is not<br/>
internalizing it that way. <br/>
<br/>
Four is generally a more relational age than three...<br/>
at three their focus is on individuating, pushing<br/>
limits, testing boundaries and rules; at four they<br/>
become more interested again in their connections to<br/>
their parents and other loved ones, in how they belong<br/>
to and are like their parents.  The competition for<br/>
time and attention from you may have been subsumed a<br/>
bit in that developmental independent pushing at age<br/>
three, and be more emotionally immediate for him again<br/>
at four... generating more resentment at a time in<br/>
which he has more mental and physical resources with<br/>
which to express his anger and wreak revenge(and<br/>
hopefully oust the Young Pretender).<br/>
<br/>
If you can find the reason(s) that he is acting out,<br/>
it will be easier to alleviate the behavior.  You can<br/>
give him special attention, give him special powers<br/>
and independence that your daughter does not have,<br/>
both in terms relational to her (being her teacher in<br/>
skills he has mastered, taking his word for it and<br/>
praising when he &#39;translates&#39; for her, etc) and in<br/>
ways completely independent of her (going to movies<br/>
with mom or dad without her, having a different bed<br/>
time, being able to choose his own food, etc).  Make<br/>
sure he has some area that is totally off-limits to<br/>
her; all kids are territorial, and like anyone else<br/>
have a need for occasional quiet and solitude... make<br/>
sure he has that opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
And then (here&#39;s the hard part) ignore the attacks...<br/>
I don&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t snatch her away.  I mean<br/>
treat them matter of factly, don&#39;t react to them in an<br/>
emotional way.  Pretend you are picking her up in<br/>
order to put her in a chair, change her diaper,<br/>
whatever.  Reprimands to him or conspicuous comfort to<br/>
her will just increase his resentment.  And the<br/>
possibility is that at least part of the time the<br/>
&#39;attack&#39; is actually just a four-year-old&#39;s attempt to<br/>
interact in an interesting way... he may simply find<br/>
her reactions interesting or amusing.  <br/>
<br/>
Get her out of the way, distract him with some project<br/>
that is more interesting and fun... and then catch him<br/>
out at any positive interactions with her and praise<br/>
them conspicuously.  Any little thing.  The more good<br/>
feelings you can get him to connect to her and<br/>
positive interactions with her, the better.  Start out<br/>
by praising the tiniest positive action and gradually<br/>
raise the bar as he gets acclimated... just like potty<br/>
training.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was wondering how the 1 1/2 year old treats the older one?  Is there any<br/>
pushing, grabbing and yelling coming from the opposite direction?  I know<br/>
it&#39;s more appropriate/likely at the toddler level, but that doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
that your son (4) will LIKE it.  Make it clear that you eventually expect<br/>
the little one to also show genteel behavior.  :-)   (This is a wild guess,<br/>
so if it&#39;s off the mark, please ignore it.)<br/>
<br/>
When I was 4 and my little brother was not quite 2, my parents let me have<br/>
a lock on my bedroom door so I could persue my own activities some times<br/>
without having an impetuous toddler wander in and knock over my stuff.  (It<br/>
was a lock that was easy for my parents to open from the outside w. a<br/>
butter knife or a screwdriver.)<br/>

I&#39;ve been meaning to reply to this one as our kids are really close to the<br/>
same age. I have a 4.5 yo ds and a 1.5 yo dd and some days they are just<br/>
great - playing together like the best of pals. Some days it is really<br/>
tough, especially when I have something I need to get done, LOL.  Today I<br/>
was packing for our trip, so it was one of &quot;those days&quot;. One thing I try to<br/>
insist on in our house is that we treat each other respectfully. Anyone who<br/>
can&#39;t do that can remove themselves to another room or to a quiet spot to<br/>
calm down (including DH and I!!). So if either one of my kids is verbally or<br/>
physically harming the other, if they can&#39;t work it out themselves, I ask<br/>
the one who is being the aggressor to come with me to another room to calm<br/>
down. Or, if I need to comfort the other one first, I ask the agressor to<br/>
wait for me and then after I&#39;ve comforted the other one, I go and help them<br/>
work through whatever the problem is - talking about it, hugging, etc.. With<br/>
my two, it&#39;s not necessarily the oldest who is the most aggressive. My dd is<br/>
a biter and hair puller (which my ds never did at this age), so I have to be<br/>
really vigilant as she does this out of the blue. I&#39;ve also tried to give ds<br/>
some places that he can play where my daughter can&#39;t disturb his stuff. It<br/>
has to be very frustrating for him to build something up only to have her<br/>
come and knock it down. I&#39;ve also noticed that things are much calmer if<br/>
they each have some dedicated &quot;mommy time&quot; at some point during the day. My<br/>
son gets it when my daughter naps, and my daughter usually gets it after my<br/>
son goes to sleep (since he doesn&#39;t nap, he usually goes to sleep first and<br/>
she&#39;s more of a night owl). I try not to make any judgements about anything<br/>
I don&#39;t see personally, and if the kids aren&#39;t getting along, I just take<br/>
the tack &quot;I see things aren&#39;t working out, why don&#39;t we play in separate<br/>
rooms until you two feel like playing in the same space again?&quot; and they<br/>
usually want to do that. I also remember that the book &quot;Siblings Without<br/>
Rivalry&quot; had some good suggestions, I need to re-read it now as my daughter<br/>
is getting verbal enough to implement some of their suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
As for your son mostly playing with the neighbors and missing mom time,<br/>
perhaps this is part of the problem?? This is hard for me to address as our<br/>
kids don&#39;t play at other&#39;s houses without us there, unless it&#39;s a special<br/>
occasion and then only with one or two trusted families. Perhaps you can set<br/>
up a special time while your daughter naps to do crafts or build with legos<br/>
or do some one thing that your son really wants to do. If you made a<br/>
schedule (with his input) at the beginning of the day or week, and talked to<br/>
him each morning about what that day&#39;s activity would be, maybe he would<br/>
want to do that instead of hanging with the other kids??  Just some<br/>
thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, I know that with kids at these ages a day can either be<br/>
fabulously brilliant (yesterday I sat in the beautiful sunshine while my<br/>
kids played &quot;beavers&quot; and worked together to build a beaver lodge in the<br/>
creek by our house with sticks) or a day can be agonizingly chaotic (today<br/>
while I tried to pack, my kids took turns antagonizing each other with<br/>
whistles and harmonicas until the racket threatened to explode my brain).<br/>
