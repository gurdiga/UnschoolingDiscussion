Are you going to be anywhere near Pensacola when you come to FL?  Aaaah, no <br/>
one ever comes up this way...no Disney World Schlock!! haha<br/>
Seriously though, if you are in the NW panhandle, write and we&#39;ll meet up at <br/>
the park or something.<br/>

I understand about lists of fun ideas...I love them too.  I seem to have the <br/>
problem of not enough money or time to do everything I want though. One good <br/>
place to look for &quot;to do&quot; ideas is the local alternative papers.  If you have <br/>
publications that are specifically for parents or some liberal types of <br/>
papers, they usually list local activities, classes, plays and other events. <br/>
I have found anything from pottery classes to African dance. There is so much <br/>
available if you just look.<br/>
A really fun to-do-at-home type books are several by Nancy Blakely. We have <br/>
the &quot;Lotions, Potions and Slime. Mudpies and More.&quot;<br/>
But there are a couple other &quot;Mudpies&quot; books available.<br/>
This one has snow recipes...good if you&#39;re up North somewhere. I won&#39;t be <br/>
doing those anytime soon!<br/>
Another book we love has many recipes for doughs and paints called &quot;Magic <br/>
Mixtures&quot;. It&#39;s an indispensable reference for all types of projects.<br/>
Another good item to keep around is a huge roll of butcher paper....good for <br/>
outdoor fingerpainting (with your entire body of course).<br/>
There is a thread at unschooling.com titled something like Unschooling <br/>
materials (does anyone remember?) and there are many, many good ideas for <br/>
activities and items that inspire creativity.<br/>
It&#39;s worth printing a copy of.<br/>
I still would love to take a &quot;Sandra class&quot; just to glean years of great <br/>
ideas. Plan to do that at the conference this fall!!! Right?<br/>

&gt;Your probably right.. that I shouldn&#39;t try to change her mind. I am more<br/>
&gt;concerned now, because my middle daughter is wanting very much to spend a<br/>
&gt;week or two with this Aunt, and I&#39;m afraid she will try to convince our<br/>
&gt;daughter that she has &quot;missed out on so much by not going to school&quot;. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I thought she&#39;s going to do that, even if she was wavering a bit in <br/>
her stance and I might yet convince her, I&#39;d still take her aside when I <br/>
arrived and ask her nicely to lay off any comparisons of the kids.  I&#39;ve <br/>
even been known to let someone think they&#39;re right, just to keep my kids <br/>
from getting that kind of garbage.  Like I would say, &quot;Remember what we <br/>
were talking about the other day? Do me a favor and don&#39;t mention it to <br/>
Jr. just yet...we haven&#39;t had a chance to discuss the school thing with <br/>
him....&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you think that would give her just the permission she <br/>
needs to blab all her junk to Jr., then ignore me.  And you can&#39;t let <br/>
your kid hear you say it...if they&#39;re like mine, they&#39;ll pipe up and ask <br/>
what&#39;s going on!  lol.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also been known to prepare my kids ahead of time for people who I <br/>
know are going to make certain kinds of comments.  Will is so well <br/>
prepared that last night he yelled at me, &quot;MOM!  You&#39;re trying to make <br/>
me be like EVERYBODY ELSE!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Only because he wanted to use a frozen mini-pizza box from Sam&#39;s without <br/>
a single decoration as his Valentine collection box at the skating party <br/>
tomorrow.  lol.<br/>
