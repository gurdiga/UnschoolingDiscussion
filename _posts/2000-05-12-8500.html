<div id="ygrps-yiv-481440184">In Ohio, we have to notify the school superintendent before the beginning of <br/>
the new school year, letting them know that we are going to cover all <br/>
subjects &quot;necessary&quot; and giving them a list of the curriculum, etc. that <br/>
we&#39;ll be using during the year.  (How&#39;d ya like that run=on sentence?)  :)<br/>
Anywho...if I&#39;m unschooling and I don&#39;t really have a &quot;curriculum&quot; to list <br/>
or whatever, what do you suggest I do?  I plan on listing a couple things <br/>
that I know will be used.  But, what do I list for the unknown parts?  :)  <br/>
Would appreciate any suggestions you might have to offer.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!     ~Marcy~<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i believe the law reads: &quot;Brief outline of the intended curriculum for the<br/>
current year.  Such outline is for *informational* purposes only&quot; and a<br/>
list of &quot;textbooks or correspondence courses or commercial curricula or<br/>
other basic materials that the parent intends to use for home education.<br/>
Such list is for *informational purposes only.*&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Since you can&#39;t be held to what you include in your notification, what a<br/>
lot of people I know do is to print out the World Book scope and sequence<br/>
from their web site and include that as the &quot;intended curriculum&quot; and then<br/>
go through their house and community and list resources they might use.<br/>
