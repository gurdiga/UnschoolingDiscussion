<div id="ygrps-yiv-416722056">Gabriel (8) wants to figure out how to connect to the web and download<br/>
free games for his PlayStation Portable. I&#39;ve looked at several<br/>
websites, but to be honest I am just in way over my head! I don&#39;t know<br/>
if the &quot;homebrew&quot; games are okay to download, or how to go about it.<br/>
Do any of you, or your kids, have suggestions for how I can help<br/>
Gabriel figure this out?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210450463">My 14 year old could help him.  That&#39;s the new hand held play <br/>
station right??  He knows how to put movies on a memory stick(?) and <br/>
has some links.  Email me offline and we could exchange numbers too <br/>
if that would help.  We have a cell phone with free long distance so <br/>
he could call you.  He is asleep right now and is mowing the <br/>
neighbors lawn when he wakes up.  He&#39;d be thrilled to talk to <br/>
someone about the psp. <br/>

Here&#39;s a link in my favorite places:<br/>
