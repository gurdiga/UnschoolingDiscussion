It sounds to me like this is more than a simple case of croupe. It sounds<br/>
like asthma. I would suggest you talk to your pediatritian about getting him<br/>
going on some asthma meds (prob. albuterol and cromolyn mix) via nebulizer.<br/>
I am an asthmatic mom of three asthmatic children and believe me when I tell<br/>
you, diagnosing and treating asthma at a young age can mean much less<br/>
treatment and probs. I was not dx&#39;d until this year and I have a lot of<br/>
damage to undo. All of my kids were dx&#39;d early on in life and 2 out of the 3<br/>
only need meds when they have colds . Please talk to your dr.<br/>

&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I need some good motherly (Or fatherly!) advice.  My 22 month old has<br/>
&gt; croup again.  My other two children never had it and in my family I grew<br/>
&gt; up in none of us ever had it, so I&#39;m not overly sure how to treat it.  I<br/>
&gt; know about the steam and taking the child out into the cold air trick<br/>
&gt; but this is summer so what do I do?  Also, when he&#39;s had it before (this<br/>
&gt; might be his 4th episode), it&#39;s always happened at night and by day he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; fine.  This time it started at 8 this morning and is continuing through<br/>
&gt; the day...is it going to get worse tonight yet?  He seems basically<br/>
&gt; fine, is not breathing with great difficulty, just wheezing alot.  We<br/>
&gt; all do have bad colds right now so it&#39;s extra tough for him breathing<br/>
&gt; when he&#39;s so congested.  Any advice, information or tips please?  I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; appreciate anything anyone has to offer.  A friend in the past told me<br/>
&gt; to try homeopathy and I did try a couple of doses this a.m. and it did<br/>
&gt; not seem to help at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sonia<br/>

My daughter woke up on Sat. with what sounded like the croup.  I agree with <br/>
your friend, however we talked to the doctor, which prescribed something, <br/>
(this was the first time she had it).  My hubby and I decided we wanted to <br/>
try to fight it as naturally as possible so we waited to see how she would do <br/>
with some natural stuff for 24hrs as long as she did not get any worse.  My <br/>
hubby went to the health food store and told the lady what we were dealing <br/>
with and she helped him pick out some stuff.  We gave it to her and within <br/>
8hrs, you could hear the stuff in her chest breaking up and becoming loose <br/>
which she is now coughing out.  (Yuck, how is that for a visiual).  But like <br/>
I said, this is her first time with it.  We are also, trying to build her <br/>
immune system with herbs.  The stuff we got was &quot;Respiratory &Lung support <br/>
Horehound Blend-Herbs for Kids&quot; plus a bottle of Echinacea.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this help.  Just remember you are the expert on your little <br/>
one....follow your heart.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906059589">Just have to add that croup is an inflammation of the airway in your throat<br/>
area not the lungs.  They are unrelated though both can stop breathing if<br/>
they get bad enough. All of my kids have had croup at one time or another<br/>
and most have been easily treated with the steam in the bathroom routine.<br/>
However, I have had one child rushed to ER when he started to turn blue.<br/>
Usually croup is harmless (sounds a lot worse than it is) and will pass in a<br/>
few days but it still warrants watching, just in case.  Wheezing and<br/>
coughing gunk up, on the other hand, is lung related and requires a<br/>
different treatment (whether medical or homeopathy) than croup.  The good<br/>
thing is that steam in the bathroom is good for croup and for gunk in the<br/>
lungs so if you&#39;re not sure which it is, it will help regardless.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-767278277">Sonia, all 3 of my kids had the croup a few weeks ago.  My dh came down with <br/>
a cold, and they all caught it.  My oldest had it the worst.  He was barking <br/>
like a seal!  We took the kids to the ped. to make sure they did not have <br/>
something else.  He told me that if any of them had real difficulty <br/>
breathing, then take them to the ER.  Otherwise, keep using the steam, and <br/>
freezer  (from the refrigerator) to help treat it.  If it did not improve in <br/>
a few days he would have considered using a steroid to help keep airways <br/>
opened, but after about 3 days it improved considerably.  He did recommend <br/>
using a cough med that had &quot;DM&quot; in its name , and also warm, soothing drinks <br/>
for the irritated throat.  My kids liked warm carob and milk.  Hope your <br/>
little one feels better soon.  ~Karen</div>
