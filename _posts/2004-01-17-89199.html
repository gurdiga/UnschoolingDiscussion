<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685671589">Just wondering if anyone has heard of or been to this conference in the <br/>
Dallas-Fort Worth area.  <br/>
<br/>
It bills itself as having been around for 8 years, and has some significant <br/>
workshop presenters, including Alison McKee, the author of two books, <br/>
Homeschooling Our Children, Unschooling Ourselves and From Homeschool to College and <br/>
Work: Turning Your Homeschooled Experiences into College and Job Portfolios, and <br/>
Taber Shadburne, who is a psychologist who works with Grace Llewellyn and her <br/>
&#39;Not Back to School Camp&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot more info, of course, at their website:  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen this conference mentioned here (although that doesn&#39;t mean it <br/>
hasn&#39;t been...), and I&#39;d like to get some solid feedback before I pony up for <br/>
registration at the end of the month.<br/>
<br/>
Good stuff?  Not-so-good stuff?  Solid stuff?  Tongue-wagging stuff?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m game for any and all information out there.  :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ll admit to being a bit prejudiced! &lt;g&gt; But the reason I started the Live <br/>
&gt; & <br/>
&gt; Learn Unschooling Conference was because I wanted to meet all these <br/>
&gt; incredible folks I&#39;d gotten to know virtually for two years.<br/>
<br/>

I wondered if that&#39;s what the Live and Learn Conference was for -- kind of a <br/>
face-to-face for this online community.  What a great idea!  I didn&#39;t realize <br/>
it was that young....thanks for starting it.<br/>
<br/>
Laura B.<br/>
who was thinking of maybe doing BOTH, frankly :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is not all who attend though.  I went to the first one.  We had been <br/>
unschooling but I knew of no one else who was.  I had been searching the web, and <br/>
ran across the SOS sight and thought it sounded like a good place to see more <br/>
unschooling in action.  Although I had no idea it would be so child friendly. <br/>
 It was refreshing and that is where I heard about the unschooling dotcom <br/>
list and a few months later joined.  <br/>
Thanks Kelly.<br/>
