<div id="ygrps-yiv-628298962">**I expected to feel so much better.  I didn&#39;t. I ate the low fat, <br/>
vegetarian foods (McDougall plan, which I still think is healthy).  <br/>
But I found myself having to go &quot;off the plan&quot; because I was so <br/>
hungry and I wanted something with fat in it.**<br/>
<br/>
I recently read parts of a very interesting book that claims that animal<br/>
fat is healthier for us than many kinds of vegetable fat.  (The book is<br/>
Nourishing Traditions, by Sally Fallon.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to know if what the author claims could possibly be true,<br/>
since it contradicts &quot;common wisdom&quot; about saturated fats.  However,<br/>
common wisdom about education is so wrong that it helps me believe that<br/>
nutrition &quot;experts&quot; could possibly be just as full of it.<br/>
<br/>
Common wisdom on eggs, tropical oils and margarine have all<br/>
flip-flopped, so maybe what we &quot;know&quot; about saturated animal fats is<br/>
also wrong.  I just don&#39;t know enough about biochemistry to evaluate<br/>
conflicting claims.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Makes sense to me, esp. when you look at indiginous cultures that <br/>
existed largely on animal fats, like the Inuit and didn&#39;t have the <br/>
health problems that &quot;experts&quot; claimed were caused by animal fats. <br/>
Then again, it&#39;s debatable whether any animal farmed today would be <br/>
on the same scale of healthiness as, say, a wild elk, rabbit, or <br/>
seal. Also there&#39;s that issue of the fact that the Paleo people that <br/>
many of the new &quot;meat is great&quot; diets are based on were *way* more <br/>
active than your basic sedentary 21st century human. Who knows what <br/>
differences it makes to be eating that kind of saturated fat and <br/>
moving your body 12 hours a day vs. sitting still most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
My uncle, who is Siberian, said that his mom would feed them lard by <br/>
the tablespoon. He&#39;s close to 70, and healthy as a horse by all <br/>
accounts. Totally anecdotal, of course. My DH&#39;s dad, who used to load <br/>
his toast up with lard before eating it died of a heart attack at 42. <br/>
I&#39;m sure there&#39;s way more variables...<br/>

vegetarian, but who grew up eating the pheasants my dad shot, and the <br/>
elk my grandpa bagged, and the veggies we canned from our garden, and <br/>
a whole bunch of butter and lard.</div>
