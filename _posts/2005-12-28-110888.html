&gt; Oh, oh -- we have a hermit crab too!!  We&#39;re new hermit crab owners  <br/>
&gt; and are getting things figured out but we lost one of the two we got  <br/>
&gt; in November.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You need more hermit crabs.  They live in colonies of hundreds or even<br/>
thousands in the wild, and will become depressed and die if left on<br/>
their own.  You don&#39;t need to own that many, though! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The best website I have found is www.hermit-crabs.com <br/>
<br/>
The hermit crabs are my special pets, because I have loved them since<br/>
I was a kid, so I &quot;allowed&quot; myself to get them about a year after we<br/>
dropped school-at-home and started unschooling.  So I have had them<br/>
for a really long time now, almost three years! YAY!  <br/>
<br/>
I have six of them, and they have lived for the whole time.  One of<br/>
them, the seventh one, died soon after I bought him though, so I think<br/>
he wasn&#39;t very healthy to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
I spent a long time researching how to build a habitat for them, and<br/>
what kinds of foods to give them, and how to keep them healthy.  It<br/>
was sooo much fun!  And that was when I knew that I finally &quot;got&quot; the<br/>
unschooling stuff, too.<br/>
