 </span></blockquote>       All the Harry Potter books, including Order of the Phoenix, with <br/>
award-winning actor Jim Dale reading. We all love &#39;em, over and over and OVER.  <br/>
Also Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit, which ds8 listens to before bed. But you <br/>
might want to try Braodway musical soundtracks too, because they tell stories <br/>
in song and work well on car trips too. Big favorite in our family and everyone <br/>
can sing along. JJ<br/>

I hadn&#39;t thought about that (though she might still be a little <br/>
young - 2.5) but she does love to sing.  She&#39;s even started making <br/>
up her own songs, depending on what part of the house she&#39;s in.  <br/>
She&#39;ll stand in the backyard and just look around and start singing <br/>
about what she sees (same with other parts of the house).  My DH saw <br/>
her do it for the first time the other day.  He starts yelling for <br/>
me to come and see, he was so excited.....I just didn&#39;t have the <br/>
heart to tell him that she&#39;s been doing that for a while now.  :-)<br/>

available as well, from Timberdoodle, and Vision<br/>
Forum, and Amazon.com.  <br/>
<br/>
Jim Weiss does them the best, of course, because he is<br/>
a master storyteller.<br/>
<br/>
We own about 5 Henty books on tape, and Andrew decided<br/>
to listen to the 3 or 4 that have to do about Ancient<br/>
Rome this year.  <br/>
<br/>
I found myself sitting in his room until 2am the other<br/>
day listening to &quot;Beric the Breton&quot; because I was so<br/>
engrossed in the story.<br/>

last order.  When I played some of the stories for her online (they <br/>
have a section where you can listen to some of the story) she made <br/>
me play the same one over and over and over again.  :-)  At least I <br/>
know that she&#39;ll like them.<br/>

out of the give-away box, &quot;NO - we want to listen to this and this and <br/>
this and this.<br/>
<br/>
Raffi was also a favorite then, for music.<br/>
<br/>
Rosie, our youngest, grew up listening to musical theater soundtracks, <br/>
though, and can&#39;t remember not knowing all the songs and words to a <br/>
number of musicals - for young kids consider: Sound of Music, Annie, <br/>
Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Cats, My Fair Lady, <br/>
Camelot, Beauty and the Beast, the Lion King, and also soundtracks to <br/>
ALL the great Disney movies - Anastasia, Mulan, Aladdin are our <br/>
favorites.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-898744945">We borrow them from the library all the time.  They are usually <br/>
mixed in with the books on tape and the containers look the same.  <br/>
We buy Jim Weiss because all 3 love his narrations (6, 9 and 12 <br/>
years old), in fact, my dh and I also enjoy them on car rides.  I <br/>
found the cheapest way to buy them are bn.com because they are <br/>
discounted and you can get free shipping with only $25 purchase or <br/>
from rainbowresources.com when we make a big order.  Rainbow gives <br/>
free shipping on $150 or more.  They have many other books on cd.  I <br/>
love their science experiment kits and field guides too.  : )<br/>

I was thinking last week of getting rid of some things like that, and talked <br/>
myself out of it.  A friend who had taught elementary years ago gave us a box <br/>
of 45 rpm records and read-along books.  I can remember having to go and find <br/>
a little record player for the kids to play them on.   And I remember Marty <br/>
and Kirby when they were 3 and 5 listening to The Three Billy Goats Gruff and <br/>
acting it out with some My Little Ponies and a troll doll, on a bridge they had <br/>
built out of stuff from their toys, over and over.<br/>
