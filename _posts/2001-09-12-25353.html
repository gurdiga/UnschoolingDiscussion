  I am heterosexual and believe in a closed marriage, but I&#39;m a<br/>

I&#39;d be flabbergasted if the US turned communist, but some of the greatest<br/>
ideas come from the fringes. The hippies freed me from white gloves,<br/>
girdles, make up and bras :-)<br/>
<br/>
I suspect eventually the unschoolers will free a lot of kids from the<br/>
concept of one size fits all education.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the communists will help us get a little more balance between the<br/>
haves and have nots.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-480440702">Julie, <br/>
First, you have as much right to live here as those who espouse a<br/>
church-state do.  That&#39;s the beauty of our country, we are all allowed to<br/>
be what we want.  Too bad so many others don&#39;t understand the plurality<br/>
of it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was wondering what you mean by communism.  The word has several<br/>
different connotations.   I assume you do not mean the system in place in<br/>
the former USSR but rather a purer more accurate form of communism?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-682451167">I think our country has spent the last fifty years telling Christians they<br/>
can have no imput in political decisions because of their faith and that is<br/>
wrong. I do not want to tell you not to worship, or even how to worship.<br/>
Separation of Church and State was intended to prevent an individual church<br/>
from dictating the government, not individuals from expressing their<br/>
convictions in politics or government. Many of our leaders were led by their<br/>
faith in God in the decisions they made as leaders of our country.<br/>
Amendment 1<br/>
congress shall make no law respecting the setablishment of religion, or<br/>
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech,<br/>
or of the press:or the right of the people peacable to assemble, and to<br/>
petition the government for a redress of greviance.<br/>
<br/>
Key words: or prohibiting the free exercise thereof: or abridging the<br/>
freedom of speech.<br/>
I am just as much an American as someone who chooses to be communist or<br/>
anything else  and I have the right to take my convicitons and beliefs into<br/>
all areas of my life, including the political arena.<br/>

&gt;      Excellent point.  Those who founded the country were quite obviously<br/>
&gt; opposed to a church-state but for some reason, those who would want one<br/>
now<br/>
&gt; sometimes see themselves as more truly AMERICAN than people whose beliefs<br/>
&gt; differ from the founders in other ways.<br/>

historical documents but this is the easiest reference to use.  The <br/>

about germ warfare and there are documented accounts after the <br/>
