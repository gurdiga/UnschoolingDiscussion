<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540525219">OK, I&#39;m going to post some stuff here that is totally embarassing to me now.<br/>
Much of which I no longer agree with, but I actually said a couple of years <br/>
ago.  Some of it wasn&#39;t true (like about me not being a tv addict, I failed <br/>
to mention that I WAS one when I first owned a tv) but I felt the need to <br/>
defend my beliefs against the WISE words of Anne, Joyce and Sandra....others <br/>
too.<br/>
So what follows is only MY posts, over a very long conversation about tv.<br/>
You can imagine what the other ones were like, similar to the issues <br/>
discussed here recently. In these posts you will see a shift in thinking <br/>
happening, you will also see my reactions to  everyone &quot;ganging up&quot; on my <br/>
beliefs at the time.<br/>
<br/>
This is VERY lengthy, I think you should probably skip this email unless it&#39;s <br/>
really relevant to your life right now. If you&#39;re wondering about letting go <br/>
of restricting tv, this is the post for you!!<br/>
You&#39;ll at least see that some of us die hards weren&#39;t always so open minded. <br/>

I think this is a very personal topic, each family has to do what works <br/>
for <br/>
them. I feel that all forms of entertainment need to be put in <br/>
perspective <br/>
and prioritized. To me tv, computer games and gameboy are mostly <br/>
entertainment value. Yes, my kids learn certain positive things from <br/>
each of <br/>
these, they are not bad in and of themselves...but I do limit the <br/>
amount of <br/>
time we do those activities. This has worked for us and we let the kids <br/>
be <br/>
part of the decision on what is a healthy amount of time, and then only <br/>
after <br/>
the chores, activities, errands etc.... are done do we allow them to <br/>
sit and <br/>
veg. This may not sound very &quot;unschooled&quot; but it works in our family. <br/>
The <br/>
kids don&#39;t feel cheated and I have some sanity. There are always those <br/>
days <br/>
where I just let them choose 100% but if I do that all the time <br/>
everything <br/>
seems to fall apart. <br/>

I guess I believe along Charlotte Masons&#39; ideas on this topic. That it <br/>
is <br/>
good and healthy to be outdoors for long periods of time....how do you <br/>
do <br/>
that if hours and hours are spent at a tv or electronics games? You do <br/>
what <br/>
works for your family, we do what works for us right? I feel that <br/>
technology <br/>
has many benefits but one negative is that we become too dependant on <br/>
it...and yes, my kids VEG when in front of a tv. That&#39;s fine at times <br/>
but if <br/>
I let them choose 100%of the time they spend all day for many days in a <br/>
row <br/>
with no sign of interest in anything else. They have told me they feel <br/>
better <br/>
and enjoy the day more when I regulate it and remind them to &quot;come <br/>
outside <br/>
and play&quot; or go swim or whatever. I think that&#39;s where parental <br/>
experience <br/>
comes in to play...at some age they have to choose on their own but as <br/>
they <br/>
show growth and maturity I let go more and more. You may see this as <br/>
too much <br/>
control but I do view excess amounts of electronics as negative. It is <br/>
not <br/>
negative in and of itself but when it begins to rob your life of <br/>
contact with <br/>
family members and doing the other things you love---it&#39;s too much! I&#39;m <br/>
not <br/>
telling you how to run things in your house...just what works for us. <br/>
There <br/>
are numerous studies that show anything in excess of 2 hours of tv per <br/>
day is <br/>
detrimental....maybe that isn&#39;t true for everyone but I personally feel <br/>
like <br/>
it&#39;s a big time waster. It is a passive activity..not the games, but <br/>
the tv. <br/>
And too much of that causes my oldest to become very aggressive and not <br/>
fun <br/>
to be around. I grew up without a tv and guess what? I was not someone <br/>
that <br/>
became &quot;bored&quot; because I could think up my own things to do...there was <br/>
always reading, putting on skits, building tree forts, sledding or <br/>
something <br/>
else to do. I think people today are not in touch enough with the <br/>
earth, with <br/>
the animals and things that grow under their feet. It is important to <br/>
me that <br/>
my children spend a lot of time outdoors so that they have the <br/>
opportunity to <br/>
learn about and be connected to the earth. Of course you can do this <br/>
and <br/>
watch tv, play games etc... but we are on the topic of EXCESS time <br/>
spent <br/>
doing those things. Live and let live, each person has to do what works <br/>
for <br/>
them. <br/>

I think that&#39;s great that it worked out that way...I&#39;m not willing to <br/>
have <br/>
the tv on that much of the time at our house. Call it a hang up if you <br/>
must, <br/>
but I&#39;m very old fashioned that way. I think along the lines of how the <br/>
Indians lived...totally in touch with the earth and how to live off of <br/>
it. <br/>
No, we usually don&#39;t have to do that now but I feel very strongly about <br/>
being <br/>
in touch with the life force that sustains us and not absorbing <br/>
ourselves in <br/>
excess amounts of technology. I agree with you Joyce about not across <br/>
the <br/>
board applying someones views, but that is the part of Charlotte Mason <br/>
I <br/>
choose to apply. Not because she was &quot;right&quot; but because we feel a <br/>
connection <br/>
to her words about being outdoors. And we do not have &quot;outdoor time&quot; <br/>
any more <br/>
than we have math time. I choose to limit tv and gameboy, I don&#39;t think <br/>
that <br/>
makes me an evil parent! Maybe you are all right and it will backfire <br/>
on <br/>
me...they will turn into tv junkies for the rest of their lives, but I <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
think so. Growing up without one in my house did not limit my world nor <br/>
did <br/>
it turn me into a tv addict. What if we chose not to have one in our <br/>
house? <br/>
Would that make me overly controlling? I don&#39;t see these things as <br/>
necessary <br/>
to a full life. Just an extra. The only reason we own one is to view <br/>
videos <br/>
and have access to news occasionally....my kids and I did not have one <br/>
for 6 <br/>
months last year and it was awesome. Didn&#39;t miss it. Maybe I&#39;m stuck in <br/>
the <br/>
past (and no, I don&#39;t have illusions about the difficulties people <br/>
faced not <br/>
so long ago) but I like living a fairly simple life, I don&#39;t believe <br/>
that <br/>
deprives my kids of anything. You may have a point about the <br/>
studies...obviously there are a lot of factors that aren&#39;t taken in to <br/>
account. My feeling is that sometimes the kids they study have <br/>
neglectful <br/>
parents that are absent or out of it and the kids just sit in front of <br/>
the tv <br/>
most of the day, every day. I personally don&#39;t see any benefit from <br/>
sitting <br/>
in front of it every day but that&#39;s an individuals choice. My only <br/>
point <br/>
before was not that parents should limit their childrens time doing <br/>
these <br/>
things, but that if they choose to I personally do not see a problem <br/>
with <br/>
that. Unschooling means I allow my children to self-educate--and yes, <br/>
that <br/>
may mean vegging at times. But I do not hand complete control of that <br/>
area <br/>
over to them and that is a good thing for us. <br/>
<br/>
By renallyn6 on Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - 05:42 pm:<br/>
The topic started with a question on whether a mom should limit the <br/>
time her <br/>
son spent on an electronic game and some of us responded that yes, we <br/>
would <br/>
(which evolved into the tv debate) and others said No, they would no <br/>
worry <br/>
about it. Topics often evolve into other discussions which are very <br/>
valuable <br/>
even if not totally linked with the first question, yk? I agree with <br/>
some of <br/>
you, I have a son that is a bit addictive with it ( any electronic <br/>
games, tv <br/>
you name it) and I set a very good example as far as being active. I am <br/>
a <br/>
mother of four that kickboxes, plays tennis, runs, bikes, takes yoga, <br/>
paints, <br/>
teaches art classes etc... almost every week I do all of the above!! <br/>
And yet, <br/>
if I don&#39;t limit the electronic entertainment, my son will choose it <br/>
every <br/>
time. Its funny, I brought up this discussion with him and mentioned <br/>
that I <br/>
would like his input again on this topic. He said that he wants it <br/>
limited <br/>
because he finds that his day goes better but asked me if I would be <br/>
willing <br/>
to up his gameboy time by 15 minutes. I was fine with that. My example <br/>
does <br/>
rub off but not enough to keep him from doing nothing but tv almost all <br/>
day <br/>
every day. I am all for limits imposed by parents. It sounds like a lot <br/>
of <br/>
you have not had to impose the limits and it&#39;s worked out really well. <br/>
But <br/>
their are different kids with different personalities and each of us <br/>
has to <br/>
find what works and what we are comfortable with YK? And my son is <br/>
equally <br/>
affected by the games, tv and computer. Anything passive he finds very <br/>
addictive and it makes him MEAN if he gets too much...it&#39;s very <br/>
obvious. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By renallyn6 on Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - 11:48 pm:<br/>
I&#39;m not willing to go through the months and months it may take to let <br/>
him <br/>
get to that point, nor am I willing to let him turn into the mean guy <br/>
in the <br/>
house to acheive that end. I have let it go for several days in a row <br/>
with no <br/>
control and it makes the day very unhappy for all involved. Not all <br/>
kids are <br/>
like that, but he is. And I don&#39;t think scarcity is the problem as he <br/>
has had <br/>
long binges and gets to play it every day if he wants--just AFTER he <br/>
completes chores and whatever else he has planned. We set a limit on <br/>
time and <br/>
make sure the household goals for the day are met. At that point he is <br/>
free <br/>
to choose his gameboy up to the amount of time he has preset with us. I <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
see that letting a child use tv, electronic games, etc... as much as <br/>
and as <br/>
often as they want always has the effect you are talking about. For <br/>
most kids <br/>
maybe, but everyone is different that way. He has spent entire days <br/>
playing <br/>
Nintendo (at a friends house, we will not buy one) and done nothing but <br/>
be <br/>
mean to his brother and end the day with quite an attitude problem. He <br/>
is not <br/>
usually like this. Anyway, I understand your point about withholding <br/>
things <br/>
and it becomes the &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; but I don&#39;t think that healthy (in <br/>
my <br/>
mind) regulation is a bad thing in every case. I could live without any <br/>
of <br/>
it, so the fact that we own gameboys and tv is a sign of my willingness <br/>
to <br/>
let them choose. And I do not prescribe a certain time as &quot;outdoor <br/>
time&quot; but <br/>
I do kick them out if they start acting like they have cabin <br/>
fever...LOL. <br/>
Usually they go down to the creek and forget about electricity all <br/>
together...mud is wonderful for that! And yes, I spend a lot of time <br/>
down <br/>
there with them, getting eaten by the large and hungry Florida <br/>
mosquitoes!! <br/>

I appreciate your thoughts on this topic. And as usual they make me <br/>
think. I <br/>
am personally not willing to spend money on a gaming system of any <br/>
kind, we <br/>
are very simple with anything materialistic and prefer to spend our <br/>
money on <br/>
travel. Now if my son were to save his own money and want to purchas it <br/>
himself that would be a different matter. He has saved $30.00 to buy <br/>
the new <br/>
Zelda game for his gameboy. Now on the issue of me keeping him from <br/>
it...that <br/>
is definitely not where the anger comes from. This is a child that <br/>
tends to <br/>
get grumpy if he does anything passive for too long (even reading) and <br/>
needs <br/>
to move physically a lot. Doesn&#39;t like to sit still and fidgets a lot, <br/>
just <br/>
his way. My younger son doesn&#39;t get the mean streak from gaming and tv <br/>
and <br/>
could care less about it if you mention doing something else. They are <br/>
just <br/>
different souls. He has asked me to limit his time as he feels better <br/>
when <br/>
he&#39;s not on it too much. There isn&#39;t any anger directed at me for <br/>
limiting <br/>
it, but then, he is part of the process of choosing how much time is <br/>
appropriate. And I&#39;m a lot more relaxed about it all when the house is <br/>
in <br/>
order and we are done with that part of our responsibilities. This is <br/>
an <br/>
ongoing process though, as he is getting close to being a teen. <br/>
Obviously he <br/>
knows my hesitations over the health of excess tv and games but he&#39;s <br/>
taught <br/>
me a lot on that topic himself. He&#39;s been obsessed with this Zelda game <br/>
he <br/>
wants to buy and talks about it constantly. I realized I was getting <br/>
irritated about his obsession with it and when he picked up on that we <br/>
had a <br/>
little converstion. He pointed out that I was not trusting him enough <br/>
and I <br/>
agreed and let it go. I realized I was labeling the game (because I <br/>
know how <br/>
obsessed he&#39;ll get for a while after buying it) as noneducational. A <br/>
not so <br/>
good trap to get into. Anyway, I do listen to him and he taught me <br/>
something <br/>
that day. But I still won&#39;t be buying a Nintendo system..my dh and I <br/>
agree <br/>
that we&#39;d rather spend our money in other ways. That will be up to my <br/>
son. <br/>
And we limit the tv time for all of us, not just my son...so maybe <br/>
that&#39;s why <br/>
he doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s a big deal. I hate households where the adults <br/>
have <br/>
different rules for the kids than they do for themselves....that&#39;s not <br/>
what <br/>
I&#39;m trying to do here. <br/>

I think it&#39;s ok to agree to disagree also...YK? Just because different <br/>
unschooling parents do things differently in each home does not make <br/>
them <br/>
&quot;less&quot; or &quot;more&quot; unschool. Yes, there are those that do not understand <br/>
the <br/>
concept and are calling what they do unschool but the majority are <br/>
indeed <br/>
unschooling, with differing views on tv, teeth brushing etc... I <br/>
understand <br/>
what you are saying about making your point well defined to encourage <br/>
people <br/>
and teach each other but I think sometimes you will come up against <br/>
well-informed, intelligent people that just plain disagree with you. <br/>
But I <br/>
don&#39;t feel the need to make everyone do things my way, just explaining <br/>
why I <br/>
do it the way I do. My kids actually have a lot of freedom with most of <br/>
this...I just expect certain things done before we do other <br/>
activities--helps <br/>
me be calm when the house is straightened-this might not bother another <br/>
person but it does me. And maybe I&#39;ll think exactly like all of you at <br/>
some <br/>
point but then again, maybe I will always feel this way? I&#39;m leaving it <br/>
open. <br/>
There are no black and whites on this issue to me...just different <br/>
people, <br/>
with different methods. And the way we do it works so right now I&#39;m not <br/>
messing with it...LOL. <br/>

I too, decided to relax and &quot;see&quot; what would happen...obviously this <br/>
hasn&#39;t <br/>
been long enough for self regulation to kick in but I hate the sound of <br/>
the <br/>
D___ thing all day. My dh also gets cranky with constant noise. I have <br/>
found <br/>
that my kids are fine if I say &quot;can we go do something else now?&quot; they <br/>
just <br/>
need a little prompt (not a demand) They have found a couple shows they <br/>
really want to watch every day, other than that they don&#39;t mind leaving <br/>
it <br/>
alone. This discussion has prompted a lot of thought on my part about <br/>
my <br/>
views and where the negative thoughts about certain things come from. I <br/>
was <br/>
actually asking my son how to play Pokemon on the game boy and he <br/>
showed me a <br/>
bunch of tricks to it. So yes, I still regulate the tv....but I&#39;m <br/>
questioning <br/>
my motives more often. My kids act relieved when I suggest another <br/>
activity, <br/>
like they can&#39;t unglue by themselves...maybe it just takes more time. <br/>
<br/>
By renallyn6 on Tuesday, July 3, 2001 - 03:28 pm:<br/>
well I&#39;m definitely a freak, so I guess I shouldn&#39;t expect my kids to <br/>
be any <br/>
different..lol. I too, have relaxed and had some major ups and downs <br/>
over it. <br/>
I have decided to give them more control but still insist they help out <br/>
first. Actually, I have not had to insist...they are very willing and <br/>
ready <br/>
to help out. Probably because they can hardly beleive their luck on <br/>
very <br/>
little control over tv and gameboy. I have to say though, my oldest has <br/>
spent <br/>
three full days on his gameboy since he bought the new Zelda game for <br/>
it. How <br/>
long do you let it go before you worry about their health? I do not <br/>
agree <br/>
with sitting on your tushy all day...not healthy. But I&#39;m hearing your <br/>
words <br/>
(Sandra, Anne and others) and letting him have time to figure it out <br/>
before I <br/>
intervene too heavily. He&#39;s been relatively pleasant--he thinks some <br/>
games <br/>
put him in a rotten mood because you have to go up one level at a time <br/>
and <br/>
it&#39;s frustrating, where in the Zelda game you can go around anywhere <br/>
you want <br/>
and work out different puzzles (kind of unschoolish eh? hmmmmmm). So <br/>
we&#39;re <br/>
learning and adjusting and in the mean time I am sick of hearing the tv <br/>
on <br/>
also. <br/>

Yeah, the earplugs hurt after a while. I think a large part of the <br/>
problem is <br/>
living in a tiny house (1250 sf) with six people that really value <br/>
their <br/>
private spaces. When I can&#39;t hear the tv all the time it does not bug <br/>
me so <br/>
much. And I&#39;m really proud that he could analyze himself so well and <br/>
figure <br/>
out what made him grumpy about certain games...this thread had a lot to <br/>
do <br/>
with our conversations over it, I was really impressed with his <br/>
insights on <br/>
the issue. I&#39;ve heard a couple of &quot;damn&quot;s coming from the bedroom but <br/>
he <br/>
doesn&#39;t emerge in this rotten, be rude to everyone mode. A pleasant <br/>
change <br/>
for sure. And he spends his own money on the games so it was a big deal <br/>
the <br/>
way he went about it. He ended up trading in some old games and hardly <br/>
spending any money to buy it so he had some money for the game guide <br/>
and <br/>
whatever else he wants. So he practiced his own budgeting <br/>
again....something <br/>
I sure wish I had learned at a young age. <br/>
<br/>
I think that I have a hard time with letting them sit around because dh <br/>
and I <br/>
are very active. I work out almost every day and we&#39;re training for a <br/>
triathlon right now. But then I have to stop and remember, the kid <br/>
LOVES swim <br/>
team and goes to practice every day of the week with very few <br/>
exceptions...so <br/>
relax right? Not so easy to do. I perceive his excess time on it as a <br/>
waste <br/>
of time (not so easy to rid yourself of that one) and I&#39;m still not <br/>
sure how <br/>
comfortable I am with this idea of self-regulation ( ok, ok, I&#39;m not <br/>
comfortable at all...but work with me here). But I have noticed a <br/>
considerable change in their attitude when I ask them to help me with <br/>
household stuff or other things...maybe the control over this is <br/>
helping them <br/>
feel less controlled (even though I did not feel I was very controlling <br/>
over <br/>
all...just on that issue). Well, one day at a time...not making any <br/>
promises <br/>
here. Just trying to find the balance. <br/>

I&#39;m probably one of the only other people here that does believe it&#39;s <br/>
ok to <br/>
limit tv when necessary. I find my one son getting very lazy and not <br/>
interested in other activities for DAYS on end if I don&#39;t say anything. <br/>
If I <br/>
say &quot;ok, enough tv for today&quot; and suggest that we do something, he is <br/>
usually <br/>
glad for it. If he&#39;s in the middle of something he really wants to <br/>
watch I <br/>
just say &quot;ok, when that&#39;s over do you think we could go do something?&quot; <br/>
and he <br/>
always is fine with that. I have relaxed a lot over the whole issue but <br/>
I <br/>
think there are some kids that are more addictive and affected by it <br/>
than <br/>
others. I just disagree with total self regulation on that <br/>
topic....sorry. I <br/>
do believe it is best to be relaxed over it and I&#39;m glad that self <br/>
regulation <br/>
works for all of you. <br/>

Ok, I know this is a little OT....I noticed my kids will eat oodles of <br/>
veggies and healthy stuff if I make it as readily available as the <br/>
junk. The <br/>
key to junk food is that you open a package and it&#39;s ready to eat...if <br/>
you <br/>
have healthy stuff as easy to get to, they will eat it just as much as <br/>
the <br/>
junk. At least, this is an observance I&#39;ve made with my own and my <br/>
neices/nephews. <br/>
<br/>
I think tv could be like that too....the more options available, the <br/>
more <br/>
they will balance it all. <br/>

The first thing I thought when I read your post Tam is &quot;they haven&#39;t <br/>
had <br/>
enough time to deschool&quot;.... <br/>
It took mine over a year, and we were very relaxed homeschoolers prior <br/>
to <br/>
that. Around 1 1/2 years later I started seeing some &quot;sparks&quot; of <br/>
inventiveness I hadn&#39;t before. <br/>
That&#39;s not to say they suddenly developed a yearning for math lessons <br/>
or <br/>
writing. My 8 y.o. doesn&#39;t read. My 11 1/2 y.o. couldn&#39;t tell us 10 <br/>
times 5 <br/>
last night! I KNOW I taught him the 10X tables at least twice!! But you <br/>
know <br/>
what? It has to be meaningful for them or it won&#39;t stick anyway. Being <br/>
in <br/>
touch with oneself is so much more important than when they learn to <br/>
write or <br/>
do math equations. <br/>
Keep trusting them, keep trusting yourself. It really does work. <br/>
I totally understand your apprehension about not &quot;strewing their paths&quot; <br/>
enough. I have felt guilt over that lately too...going back to work and <br/>
a new <br/>
baby are eating up my time. But when I stand back and look at it in an <br/>
unschooling perspective, it is rosy! The boys have battled their Dad <br/>
nightly <br/>
in Pokemon (the card game) which is massive amounts of strategical <br/>
thinking, <br/>
reading, math etc... We&#39;ve done relay races in the driveway, bike rides <br/>
etc... we had a birthday party for their stuffed animals yesterday <br/>
(complete <br/>
with decorated cake and candles) So NO, it doesn&#39;t look like school in <br/>
any <br/>
way. But we are living life, as a family, complete with cleaning house, <br/>
watching tv and just hanging out too. <br/>
Your girls are learning what an appraisal is. How many kids have ever <br/>
even <br/>
seen an appraiser? I bet most of them are in school when important <br/>
things <br/>
about their lives are going on. Don&#39;t take for granted the flow of <br/>
daily <br/>
living and what that teaches. It&#39;s REAL life...YOUR life. And they are <br/>
absorbing all of that. <br/>

Having formerly been a little controling, and now pretty much letting <br/>
them <br/>
choose I can relate to both sides of this issue. <br/>
I have found that my kids often would love to do something else, but I <br/>
have <br/>
to come up with an idea or just ask them if they&#39;d like to go somewhere <br/>
today. I have also noticed they tend to watch more tv (or play gameboy) <br/>
after <br/>
being very social. Like down time for them. <br/>
I have noticed my kids being much less obsessive about the tv now that <br/>
I&#39;m <br/>
more relaxed. I think Sandra, Anne and others are right about that <br/>
&quot;forbidden <br/>
fruit&quot; thing! <br/>
There is nothing wrong with waiting until a fave show is over and <br/>
saying <br/>
&quot;hey, lets&#39; go outside and play tag&quot; or whatever. <br/>

I had no TV for a while, I also had negative associations with tv. <br/>
I got my feathers ruffled a little bit when bringing up my viewpoints <br/>
in this <br/>
very forum not too long ago. <br/>
That annoyed feeling made me think though. <br/>
It made me ponder and question if maybe the people here were right!! <br/>
COULD I be causing addictive behavior in my children with my control? <br/>
Was I hindering their world in some way? <br/>
I finally had to admit that MY views on tv were just that.....MINE. <br/>
My children have a right to choose their own life. <br/>
And they have now. <br/>
Trevor had many years of control so he is still acting fairly obsessive <br/>
with <br/>
the new cable we had installed. <br/>
Better now, with the safety and guidance of his parents than later on <br/>
his own <br/>
imo. <br/>
It&#39;s not fair for one persons prejudices to decide the entire <br/>
household. <br/>
Now that I see tv for what it is, just another tool, we have really <br/>
enjoyed <br/>
some wonderful moments as a family. <br/>
My kids have learned a TON from it. <br/>
I just can&#39;t fathom an unschooler not having a tv and shunning all the <br/>
learning opportunities just because of their own prejudices against it. <br/>
To me, unschooling means using all of the tools at our disposal, to <br/>
shun one <br/>
tool means losing out on a host of opportunities that any other tool <br/>
can&#39;t <br/>
offer. <br/>
All of those benefits to not owning one, that were listed above? <br/>
Can you believe that we have that AND a telly? <br/>
Hmmm.... <br/>
The television is not evil. It&#39;s just a tool. <br/>
You can use it or not use it as you choose.....It doesn&#39;t take over <br/>
your life <br/>
unless you want it to. <br/>
Some of these responses make me wonder if people think television is <br/>
akin to <br/>
smoking and causes addiction. <br/>
Why would you think that tv owners are less likely to really listen to <br/>
their <br/>
spouses or listen to them 100%? <br/>
Do you think we all sit in front of the tv every time we have a <br/>
conversation? <br/>
I find that remark insulting, as though we tv owners can&#39;t have <br/>
effective <br/>
communication or healthy marriages!!! Sheesh. <br/>
And insulting Sandra was really lame after you asked for her opinion. <br/>

. &quot;I will experiment with candy and get back to you&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Then it won&#39;t work. <br/>
You can&#39;t expect an experiment to reap the benefits we are talking <br/>
about. <br/>
Only total, long term trust will bring the results being discussed in <br/>
this <br/>
forum. <br/>
You will try the &quot;experiment&quot;, see the children gorging themselves sick <br/>
on <br/>
candy and junk most likely (because they haven&#39;t learned self control <br/>
yet) <br/>
and you will say &quot;this does NOT work, what is wrong with those people?&quot; <br/>
It only reaps the benefits when the trust and non-control are always <br/>
there. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s ok with me at this point to let my children miss the learning <br/>
that is <br/>
available through television because of what I view as the negative <br/>
aspects <br/>
of it - to me this over-rides what is positive. Some of these negative <br/>
aspects are: lack of attention and less independant creative play (I&#39;ve <br/>
seen <br/>
this repeatedly as a pre-school teacher) and the desire to be <br/>
entertained &quot; <br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re suggesting is that because there are unhealthy/negative <br/>
things on <br/>
television, you will shut down the positive aspects of it? <br/>
That&#39;s like burning down the library because there are books that are <br/>
negative. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;lack of attention and less independant creative play&quot; <br/>
??? <br/>
Really? Well, that is not true in my house. <br/>
My 8 y.o. ds loves spending time by himself. He is highly creative, <br/>
prefers <br/>
to daydream alone much of the time, putter in the woods or draw. <br/>
He has unlimited access to tv, food, books etc... and yet I see his <br/>
creativity abound. <br/>
He is very good at entertaining himself. All of my kids are. But I have <br/>
a 12 <br/>
y.o. that is still obsessing with the tv because we didn&#39;t have one for <br/>
a <br/>
while....... <br/>
I suggest you are inferring things from a limited point of view. <br/>
Kids in school can&#39;t even be compared to unschoolers in that area. <br/>
Everything in their lives seems to be controlled, forced and limited. <br/>
Of course their creativity is stifled. <br/>
And independant play is not necessarily a good thing. <br/>
Some people need more person to person interaction, others are more <br/>
introverted. <br/>
I don&#39;t think that independant play is a goal for unschoolers with <br/>
preschoolers. <br/>
Independance is overrated. <br/>
Interdependance is much healthier. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Also I tend to think that unschoolers here and homeschoolers generally <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
watch that much. &quot; <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers here? Well that is going to vary a lot from person to <br/>
person. <br/>
I&#39;ve read of some that do watch a lot, I don&#39;t. But just because I <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I will dictate my childrens viewing any longer. <br/>
Homeschoolers in general probably villianize tv to a large degree. <br/>
That&#39;s been my experience, because many homeschoolers still carry a lot <br/>
of <br/>
school ideas into their lives. <br/>
I suggest that we&#39;ve all been duped, and letting children choose is the <br/>
better way. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-389874910">OK, I&#39;m going to post some stuff here that is totally embarassing to me now.<br/>
Much of which I no longer agree with, but I actually said a couple of years <br/>
ago.  Some of it wasn&#39;t true (like about me not being a tv addict, I failed <br/>
to mention that I WAS one when I first owned a tv) but I felt the need to <br/>
defend my beliefs against the WISE words of Anne, Joyce and Sandra....others <br/>
too.<br/>
So what follows is only MY posts, over a very long conversation about tv.<br/>
You can imagine what the other ones were like, similar to the issues <br/>
discussed here recently. In these posts you will see a shift in thinking <br/>
happening, you will also see my reactions to  everyone &quot;ganging up&quot; on my <br/>
beliefs at the time.<br/>
<br/>
This is VERY lengthy, I think you should probably skip this email unless it&#39;s <br/>
really relevant to your life right now. If you&#39;re wondering about letting go <br/>
of restricting tv, this is the post for you!!<br/>
You&#39;ll at least see that some of us die hards weren&#39;t always so open minded. <br/>

I think this is a very personal topic, each family has to do what works <br/>
for <br/>
them. I feel that all forms of entertainment need to be put in <br/>
perspective <br/>
and prioritized. To me tv, computer games and gameboy are mostly <br/>
entertainment value. Yes, my kids learn certain positive things from <br/>
each of <br/>
these, they are not bad in and of themselves...but I do limit the <br/>
amount of <br/>
time we do those activities. This has worked for us and we let the kids <br/>
be <br/>
part of the decision on what is a healthy amount of time, and then only <br/>
after <br/>
the chores, activities, errands etc.... are done do we allow them to <br/>
sit and <br/>
veg. This may not sound very &quot;unschooled&quot; but it works in our family. <br/>
The <br/>
kids don&#39;t feel cheated and I have some sanity. There are always those <br/>
days <br/>
where I just let them choose 100% but if I do that all the time <br/>
everything <br/>
seems to fall apart. <br/>

I guess I believe along Charlotte Masons&#39; ideas on this topic. That it <br/>
is <br/>
good and healthy to be outdoors for long periods of time....how do you <br/>
do <br/>
that if hours and hours are spent at a tv or electronics games? You do <br/>
what <br/>
works for your family, we do what works for us right? I feel that <br/>
technology <br/>
has many benefits but one negative is that we become too dependant on <br/>
it...and yes, my kids VEG when in front of a tv. That&#39;s fine at times <br/>
but if <br/>
I let them choose 100%of the time they spend all day for many days in a <br/>
row <br/>
with no sign of interest in anything else. They have told me they feel <br/>
better <br/>
and enjoy the day more when I regulate it and remind them to &quot;come <br/>
outside <br/>
and play&quot; or go swim or whatever. I think that&#39;s where parental <br/>
experience <br/>
comes in to play...at some age they have to choose on their own but as <br/>
they <br/>
show growth and maturity I let go more and more. You may see this as <br/>
too much <br/>
control but I do view excess amounts of electronics as negative. It is <br/>
not <br/>
negative in and of itself but when it begins to rob your life of <br/>
contact with <br/>
family members and doing the other things you love---it&#39;s too much! I&#39;m <br/>
not <br/>
telling you how to run things in your house...just what works for us. <br/>
There <br/>
are numerous studies that show anything in excess of 2 hours of tv per <br/>
day is <br/>
detrimental....maybe that isn&#39;t true for everyone but I personally feel <br/>
like <br/>
it&#39;s a big time waster. It is a passive activity..not the games, but <br/>
the tv. <br/>
And too much of that causes my oldest to become very aggressive and not <br/>
fun <br/>
to be around. I grew up without a tv and guess what? I was not someone <br/>
that <br/>
became &quot;bored&quot; because I could think up my own things to do...there was <br/>
always reading, putting on skits, building tree forts, sledding or <br/>
something <br/>
else to do. I think people today are not in touch enough with the <br/>
earth, with <br/>
the animals and things that grow under their feet. It is important to <br/>
me that <br/>
my children spend a lot of time outdoors so that they have the <br/>
opportunity to <br/>
learn about and be connected to the earth. Of course you can do this <br/>
and <br/>
watch tv, play games etc... but we are on the topic of EXCESS time <br/>
spent <br/>
doing those things. Live and let live, each person has to do what works <br/>
for <br/>
them. <br/>

I think that&#39;s great that it worked out that way...I&#39;m not willing to <br/>
have <br/>
the tv on that much of the time at our house. Call it a hang up if you <br/>
must, <br/>
but I&#39;m very old fashioned that way. I think along the lines of how the <br/>
Indians lived...totally in touch with the earth and how to live off of <br/>
it. <br/>
No, we usually don&#39;t have to do that now but I feel very strongly about <br/>
being <br/>
in touch with the life force that sustains us and not absorbing <br/>
ourselves in <br/>
excess amounts of technology. I agree with you Joyce about not across <br/>
the <br/>
board applying someones views, but that is the part of Charlotte Mason <br/>
I <br/>
choose to apply. Not because she was &quot;right&quot; but because we feel a <br/>
connection <br/>
to her words about being outdoors. And we do not have &quot;outdoor time&quot; <br/>
any more <br/>
than we have math time. I choose to limit tv and gameboy, I don&#39;t think <br/>
that <br/>
makes me an evil parent! Maybe you are all right and it will backfire <br/>
on <br/>
me...they will turn into tv junkies for the rest of their lives, but I <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
think so. Growing up without one in my house did not limit my world nor <br/>
did <br/>
it turn me into a tv addict. What if we chose not to have one in our <br/>
house? <br/>
Would that make me overly controlling? I don&#39;t see these things as <br/>
necessary <br/>
to a full life. Just an extra. The only reason we own one is to view <br/>
videos <br/>
and have access to news occasionally....my kids and I did not have one <br/>
for 6 <br/>
months last year and it was awesome. Didn&#39;t miss it. Maybe I&#39;m stuck in <br/>
the <br/>
past (and no, I don&#39;t have illusions about the difficulties people <br/>
faced not <br/>
so long ago) but I like living a fairly simple life, I don&#39;t believe <br/>
that <br/>
deprives my kids of anything. You may have a point about the <br/>
studies...obviously there are a lot of factors that aren&#39;t taken in to <br/>
account. My feeling is that sometimes the kids they study have <br/>
neglectful <br/>
parents that are absent or out of it and the kids just sit in front of <br/>
the tv <br/>
most of the day, every day. I personally don&#39;t see any benefit from <br/>
sitting <br/>
in front of it every day but that&#39;s an individuals choice. My only <br/>
point <br/>
before was not that parents should limit their childrens time doing <br/>
these <br/>
things, but that if they choose to I personally do not see a problem <br/>
with <br/>
that. Unschooling means I allow my children to self-educate--and yes, <br/>
that <br/>
may mean vegging at times. But I do not hand complete control of that <br/>
area <br/>
over to them and that is a good thing for us. <br/>

By renallyn6 on Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - 05:42 pm:<br/>
The topic started with a question on whether a mom should limit the <br/>
time her <br/>
son spent on an electronic game and some of us responded that yes, we <br/>
would <br/>
(which evolved into the tv debate) and others said No, they would no <br/>
worry <br/>
about it. Topics often evolve into other discussions which are very <br/>
valuable <br/>
even if not totally linked with the first question, yk? I agree with <br/>
some of <br/>
you, I have a son that is a bit addictive with it ( any electronic <br/>
games, tv <br/>
you name it) and I set a very good example as far as being active. I am <br/>
a <br/>
mother of four that kickboxes, plays tennis, runs, bikes, takes yoga, <br/>
paints, <br/>
teaches art classes etc... almost every week I do all of the above!! <br/>
And yet, <br/>
if I don&#39;t limit the electronic entertainment, my son will choose it <br/>
every <br/>
time. Its funny, I brought up this discussion with him and mentioned <br/>
that I <br/>
would like his input again on this topic. He said that he wants it <br/>
limited <br/>
because he finds that his day goes better but asked me if I would be <br/>
willing <br/>
to up his gameboy time by 15 minutes. I was fine with that. My example <br/>
does <br/>
rub off but not enough to keep him from doing nothing but tv almost all <br/>
day <br/>
every day. I am all for limits imposed by parents. It sounds like a lot <br/>
of <br/>
you have not had to impose the limits and it&#39;s worked out really well. <br/>
But <br/>
their are different kids with different personalities and each of us <br/>
has to <br/>
find what works and what we are comfortable with YK? And my son is <br/>
equally <br/>
affected by the games, tv and computer. Anything passive he finds very <br/>
addictive and it makes him MEAN if he gets too much...it&#39;s very <br/>
obvious. <br/>
<br/>

By renallyn6 on Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - 11:48 pm:<br/>
I&#39;m not willing to go through the months and months it may take to let <br/>
him <br/>
get to that point, nor am I willing to let him turn into the mean guy <br/>
in the <br/>
house to acheive that end. I have let it go for several days in a row <br/>
with no <br/>
control and it makes the day very unhappy for all involved. Not all <br/>
kids are <br/>
like that, but he is. And I don&#39;t think scarcity is the problem as he <br/>
has had <br/>
long binges and gets to play it every day if he wants--just AFTER he <br/>
completes chores and whatever else he has planned. We set a limit on <br/>
time and <br/>
make sure the household goals for the day are met. At that point he is <br/>
free <br/>
to choose his gameboy up to the amount of time he has preset with us. I <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
see that letting a child use tv, electronic games, etc... as much as <br/>
and as <br/>
often as they want always has the effect you are talking about. For <br/>
most kids <br/>
maybe, but everyone is different that way. He has spent entire days <br/>
playing <br/>
Nintendo (at a friends house, we will not buy one) and done nothing but <br/>
be <br/>
mean to his brother and end the day with quite an attitude problem. He <br/>
is not <br/>
usually like this. Anyway, I understand your point about withholding <br/>
things <br/>
and it becomes the &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; but I don&#39;t think that healthy (in <br/>
my <br/>
mind) regulation is a bad thing in every case. I could live without any <br/>
of <br/>
it, so the fact that we own gameboys and tv is a sign of my willingness <br/>
to <br/>
let them choose. And I do not prescribe a certain time as &quot;outdoor <br/>
time&quot; but <br/>
I do kick them out if they start acting like they have cabin <br/>
fever...LOL. <br/>
Usually they go down to the creek and forget about electricity all <br/>
together...mud is wonderful for that! And yes, I spend a lot of time <br/>
down <br/>
there with them, getting eaten by the large and hungry Florida <br/>
mosquitoes!! <br/>

I appreciate your thoughts on this topic. And as usual they make me <br/>
think. I <br/>
am personally not willing to spend money on a gaming system of any <br/>
kind, we <br/>
are very simple with anything materialistic and prefer to spend our <br/>
money on <br/>
travel. Now if my son were to save his own money and want to purchas it <br/>
himself that would be a different matter. He has saved $30.00 to buy <br/>
the new <br/>
Zelda game for his gameboy. Now on the issue of me keeping him from <br/>
it...that <br/>
is definitely not where the anger comes from. This is a child that <br/>
tends to <br/>
get grumpy if he does anything passive for too long (even reading) and <br/>
needs <br/>
to move physically a lot. Doesn&#39;t like to sit still and fidgets a lot, <br/>
just <br/>
his way. My younger son doesn&#39;t get the mean streak from gaming and tv <br/>
and <br/>
could care less about it if you mention doing something else. They are <br/>
just <br/>
different souls. He has asked me to limit his time as he feels better <br/>
when <br/>
he&#39;s not on it too much. There isn&#39;t any anger directed at me for <br/>
limiting <br/>
it, but then, he is part of the process of choosing how much time is <br/>
appropriate. And I&#39;m a lot more relaxed about it all when the house is <br/>
in <br/>
order and we are done with that part of our responsibilities. This is <br/>
an <br/>
ongoing process though, as he is getting close to being a teen. <br/>
Obviously he <br/>
knows my hesitations over the health of excess tv and games but he&#39;s <br/>
taught <br/>
me a lot on that topic himself. He&#39;s been obsessed with this Zelda game <br/>
he <br/>
wants to buy and talks about it constantly. I realized I was getting <br/>
irritated about his obsession with it and when he picked up on that we <br/>
had a <br/>
little converstion. He pointed out that I was not trusting him enough <br/>
and I <br/>
agreed and let it go. I realized I was labeling the game (because I <br/>
know how <br/>
obsessed he&#39;ll get for a while after buying it) as noneducational. A <br/>
not so <br/>
good trap to get into. Anyway, I do listen to him and he taught me <br/>
something <br/>
that day. But I still won&#39;t be buying a Nintendo system..my dh and I <br/>
agree <br/>
that we&#39;d rather spend our money in other ways. That will be up to my <br/>
son. <br/>
And we limit the tv time for all of us, not just my son...so maybe <br/>
that&#39;s why <br/>
he doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s a big deal. I hate households where the adults <br/>
have <br/>
different rules for the kids than they do for themselves....that&#39;s not <br/>
what <br/>
I&#39;m trying to do here. <br/>

I think it&#39;s ok to agree to disagree also...YK? Just because different <br/>
unschooling parents do things differently in each home does not make <br/>
them <br/>
&quot;less&quot; or &quot;more&quot; unschool. Yes, there are those that do not understand <br/>
the <br/>
concept and are calling what they do unschool but the majority are <br/>
indeed <br/>
unschooling, with differing views on tv, teeth brushing etc... I <br/>
understand <br/>
what you are saying about making your point well defined to encourage <br/>
people <br/>
and teach each other but I think sometimes you will come up against <br/>
well-informed, intelligent people that just plain disagree with you. <br/>
But I <br/>
don&#39;t feel the need to make everyone do things my way, just explaining <br/>
why I <br/>
do it the way I do. My kids actually have a lot of freedom with most of <br/>
this...I just expect certain things done before we do other <br/>
activities--helps <br/>
me be calm when the house is straightened-this might not bother another <br/>
person but it does me. And maybe I&#39;ll think exactly like all of you at <br/>
some <br/>
point but then again, maybe I will always feel this way? I&#39;m leaving it <br/>
open. <br/>
There are no black and whites on this issue to me...just different <br/>
people, <br/>
with different methods. And the way we do it works so right now I&#39;m not <br/>
messing with it...LOL. <br/>

I too, decided to relax and &quot;see&quot; what would happen...obviously this <br/>
hasn&#39;t <br/>
been long enough for self regulation to kick in but I hate the sound of <br/>
the <br/>
D___ thing all day. My dh also gets cranky with constant noise. I have <br/>
found <br/>
that my kids are fine if I say &quot;can we go do something else now?&quot; they <br/>
just <br/>
need a little prompt (not a demand) They have found a couple shows they <br/>
really want to watch every day, other than that they don&#39;t mind leaving <br/>
it <br/>
alone. This discussion has prompted a lot of thought on my part about <br/>
my <br/>
views and where the negative thoughts about certain things come from. I <br/>
was <br/>
actually asking my son how to play Pokemon on the game boy and he <br/>
showed me a <br/>
bunch of tricks to it. So yes, I still regulate the tv....but I&#39;m <br/>
questioning <br/>
my motives more often. My kids act relieved when I suggest another <br/>
activity, <br/>
like they can&#39;t unglue by themselves...maybe it just takes more time. <br/>

well I&#39;m definitely a freak, so I guess I shouldn&#39;t expect my kids to <br/>
be any <br/>
different..lol. I too, have relaxed and had some major ups and downs <br/>
over it. <br/>
I have decided to give them more control but still insist they help out <br/>
first. Actually, I have not had to insist...they are very willing and <br/>
ready <br/>
to help out. Probably because they can hardly beleive their luck on <br/>
very <br/>
little control over tv and gameboy. I have to say though, my oldest has <br/>
spent <br/>
three full days on his gameboy since he bought the new Zelda game for <br/>
it. How <br/>
long do you let it go before you worry about their health? I do not <br/>
agree <br/>
with sitting on your tushy all day...not healthy. But I&#39;m hearing your <br/>
words <br/>
(Sandra, Anne and others) and letting him have time to figure it out <br/>
before I <br/>
intervene too heavily. He&#39;s been relatively pleasant--he thinks some <br/>
games <br/>
put him in a rotten mood because you have to go up one level at a time <br/>
and <br/>
it&#39;s frustrating, where in the Zelda game you can go around anywhere <br/>
you want <br/>
and work out different puzzles (kind of unschoolish eh? hmmmmmm). So <br/>
we&#39;re <br/>
learning and adjusting and in the mean time I am sick of hearing the tv <br/>
on <br/>
also. <br/>

Yeah, the earplugs hurt after a while. I think a large part of the <br/>
problem is <br/>
living in a tiny house (1250 sf) with six people that really value <br/>
their <br/>
private spaces. When I can&#39;t hear the tv all the time it does not bug <br/>
me so <br/>
much. And I&#39;m really proud that he could analyze himself so well and <br/>
figure <br/>
out what made him grumpy about certain games...this thread had a lot to <br/>
do <br/>
with our conversations over it, I was really impressed with his <br/>
insights on <br/>
the issue. I&#39;ve heard a couple of &quot;damn&quot;s coming from the bedroom but <br/>
he <br/>
doesn&#39;t emerge in this rotten, be rude to everyone mode. A pleasant <br/>
change <br/>
for sure. And he spends his own money on the games so it was a big deal <br/>
the <br/>
way he went about it. He ended up trading in some old games and hardly <br/>
spending any money to buy it so he had some money for the game guide <br/>
and <br/>
whatever else he wants. So he practiced his own budgeting <br/>
again....something <br/>
I sure wish I had learned at a young age. <br/>
<br/>
I think that I have a hard time with letting them sit around because dh <br/>
and I <br/>
are very active. I work out almost every day and we&#39;re training for a <br/>
triathlon right now. But then I have to stop and remember, the kid <br/>
LOVES swim <br/>
team and goes to practice every day of the week with very few <br/>
exceptions...so <br/>
relax right? Not so easy to do. I perceive his excess time on it as a <br/>
waste <br/>
of time (not so easy to rid yourself of that one) and I&#39;m still not <br/>
sure how <br/>
comfortable I am with this idea of self-regulation ( ok, ok, I&#39;m not <br/>
comfortable at all...but work with me here). But I have noticed a <br/>
considerable change in their attitude when I ask them to help me with <br/>
household stuff or other things...maybe the control over this is <br/>
helping them <br/>
feel less controlled (even though I did not feel I was very controlling <br/>
over <br/>
all...just on that issue). Well, one day at a time...not making any <br/>
promises <br/>
here. Just trying to find the balance. <br/>

I&#39;m probably one of the only other people here that does believe it&#39;s <br/>
ok to <br/>
limit tv when necessary. I find my one son getting very lazy and not <br/>
interested in other activities for DAYS on end if I don&#39;t say anything. <br/>
If I <br/>
say &quot;ok, enough tv for today&quot; and suggest that we do something, he is <br/>
usually <br/>
glad for it. If he&#39;s in the middle of something he really wants to <br/>
watch I <br/>
just say &quot;ok, when that&#39;s over do you think we could go do something?&quot; <br/>
and he <br/>
always is fine with that. I have relaxed a lot over the whole issue but <br/>
I <br/>
think there are some kids that are more addictive and affected by it <br/>
than <br/>
others. I just disagree with total self regulation on that <br/>
topic....sorry. I <br/>
do believe it is best to be relaxed over it and I&#39;m glad that self <br/>
regulation <br/>
works for all of you. <br/>

By ren on Friday, August 10, 2001 - 08:10 pm:<br/>
Ok, I know this is a little OT....I noticed my kids will eat oodles of <br/>
veggies and healthy stuff if I make it as readily available as the <br/>
junk. The <br/>
key to junk food is that you open a package and it&#39;s ready to eat...if <br/>
you <br/>
have healthy stuff as easy to get to, they will eat it just as much as <br/>
the <br/>
junk. At least, this is an observance I&#39;ve made with my own and my <br/>
neices/nephews. <br/>
<br/>
I think tv could be like that too....the more options available, the <br/>
more <br/>
they will balance it all. <br/>

The first thing I thought when I read your post Tam is &quot;they haven&#39;t <br/>
had <br/>
enough time to deschool&quot;.... <br/>
It took mine over a year, and we were very relaxed homeschoolers prior <br/>
to <br/>
that. Around 1 1/2 years later I started seeing some &quot;sparks&quot; of <br/>
inventiveness I hadn&#39;t before. <br/>
That&#39;s not to say they suddenly developed a yearning for math lessons <br/>
or <br/>
writing. My 8 y.o. doesn&#39;t read. My 11 1/2 y.o. couldn&#39;t tell us 10 <br/>
times 5 <br/>
last night! I KNOW I taught him the 10X tables at least twice!! But you <br/>
know <br/>
what? It has to be meaningful for them or it won&#39;t stick anyway. Being <br/>
in <br/>
touch with oneself is so much more important than when they learn to <br/>
write or <br/>
do math equations. <br/>
Keep trusting them, keep trusting yourself. It really does work. <br/>
I totally understand your apprehension about not &quot;strewing their paths&quot; <br/>
enough. I have felt guilt over that lately too...going back to work and <br/>
a new <br/>
baby are eating up my time. But when I stand back and look at it in an <br/>
unschooling perspective, it is rosy! The boys have battled their Dad <br/>
nightly <br/>
in Pokemon (the card game) which is massive amounts of strategical <br/>
thinking, <br/>
reading, math etc... We&#39;ve done relay races in the driveway, bike rides <br/>
etc... we had a birthday party for their stuffed animals yesterday <br/>
(complete <br/>
with decorated cake and candles) So NO, it doesn&#39;t look like school in <br/>
any <br/>
way. But we are living life, as a family, complete with cleaning house, <br/>
watching tv and just hanging out too. <br/>
Your girls are learning what an appraisal is. How many kids have ever <br/>
even <br/>
seen an appraiser? I bet most of them are in school when important <br/>
things <br/>
about their lives are going on. Don&#39;t take for granted the flow of <br/>
daily <br/>
living and what that teaches. It&#39;s REAL life...YOUR life. And they are <br/>
absorbing all of that. <br/>

Having formerly been a little controling, and now pretty much letting <br/>
them <br/>
choose I can relate to both sides of this issue. <br/>
I have found that my kids often would love to do something else, but I <br/>
have <br/>
to come up with an idea or just ask them if they&#39;d like to go somewhere <br/>
today. I have also noticed they tend to watch more tv (or play gameboy) <br/>
after <br/>
being very social. Like down time for them. <br/>
I have noticed my kids being much less obsessive about the tv now that <br/>
I&#39;m <br/>
more relaxed. I think Sandra, Anne and others are right about that <br/>
&quot;forbidden <br/>
fruit&quot; thing! <br/>
There is nothing wrong with waiting until a fave show is over and <br/>
saying <br/>
&quot;hey, lets&#39; go outside and play tag&quot; or whatever. <br/>

I had no TV for a while, I also had negative associations with tv. <br/>
I got my feathers ruffled a little bit when bringing up my viewpoints <br/>
in this <br/>
very forum not too long ago. <br/>
That annoyed feeling made me think though. <br/>
It made me ponder and question if maybe the people here were right!! <br/>
COULD I be causing addictive behavior in my children with my control? <br/>
Was I hindering their world in some way? <br/>
I finally had to admit that MY views on tv were just that.....MINE. <br/>
My children have a right to choose their own life. <br/>
And they have now. <br/>
Trevor had many years of control so he is still acting fairly obsessive <br/>
with <br/>
the new cable we had installed. <br/>
Better now, with the safety and guidance of his parents than later on <br/>
his own <br/>
imo. <br/>
It&#39;s not fair for one persons prejudices to decide the entire <br/>
household. <br/>
Now that I see tv for what it is, just another tool, we have really <br/>
enjoyed <br/>
some wonderful moments as a family. <br/>
My kids have learned a TON from it. <br/>
I just can&#39;t fathom an unschooler not having a tv and shunning all the <br/>
learning opportunities just because of their own prejudices against it. <br/>
To me, unschooling means using all of the tools at our disposal, to <br/>
shun one <br/>
tool means losing out on a host of opportunities that any other tool <br/>
can&#39;t <br/>
offer. <br/>
All of those benefits to not owning one, that were listed above? <br/>
Can you believe that we have that AND a telly? <br/>
Hmmm.... <br/>
The television is not evil. It&#39;s just a tool. <br/>
You can use it or not use it as you choose.....It doesn&#39;t take over <br/>
your life <br/>
unless you want it to. <br/>
Some of these responses make me wonder if people think television is <br/>
akin to <br/>
smoking and causes addiction. <br/>
Why would you think that tv owners are less likely to really listen to <br/>
their <br/>
spouses or listen to them 100%? <br/>
Do you think we all sit in front of the tv every time we have a <br/>
conversation? <br/>
I find that remark insulting, as though we tv owners can&#39;t have <br/>
effective <br/>
communication or healthy marriages!!! Sheesh. <br/>
And insulting Sandra was really lame after you asked for her opinion. <br/>

. &quot;I will experiment with candy and get back to you&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Then it won&#39;t work. <br/>
You can&#39;t expect an experiment to reap the benefits we are talking <br/>
about. <br/>
Only total, long term trust will bring the results being discussed in <br/>
this <br/>
forum. <br/>
You will try the &quot;experiment&quot;, see the children gorging themselves sick <br/>
on <br/>
candy and junk most likely (because they haven&#39;t learned self control <br/>
yet) <br/>
and you will say &quot;this does NOT work, what is wrong with those people?&quot; <br/>
It only reaps the benefits when the trust and non-control are always <br/>
there. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s ok with me at this point to let my children miss the learning <br/>
that is <br/>
available through television because of what I view as the negative <br/>
aspects <br/>
of it - to me this over-rides what is positive. Some of these negative <br/>
aspects are: lack of attention and less independant creative play (I&#39;ve <br/>
seen <br/>
this repeatedly as a pre-school teacher) and the desire to be <br/>
entertained &quot; <br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re suggesting is that because there are unhealthy/negative <br/>
things on <br/>
television, you will shut down the positive aspects of it? <br/>
That&#39;s like burning down the library because there are books that are <br/>
negative. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;lack of attention and less independant creative play&quot; <br/>
??? <br/>
Really? Well, that is not true in my house. <br/>
My 8 y.o. ds loves spending time by himself. He is highly creative, <br/>
prefers <br/>
to daydream alone much of the time, putter in the woods or draw. <br/>
He has unlimited access to tv, food, books etc... and yet I see his <br/>
creativity abound. <br/>
He is very good at entertaining himself. All of my kids are. But I have <br/>
a 12 <br/>
y.o. that is still obsessing with the tv because we didn&#39;t have one for <br/>
a <br/>
while....... <br/>
I suggest you are inferring things from a limited point of view. <br/>
Kids in school can&#39;t even be compared to unschoolers in that area. <br/>
Everything in their lives seems to be controlled, forced and limited. <br/>
Of course their creativity is stifled. <br/>
And independant play is not necessarily a good thing. <br/>
Some people need more person to person interaction, others are more <br/>
introverted. <br/>
I don&#39;t think that independant play is a goal for unschoolers with <br/>
preschoolers. <br/>
Independance is overrated. <br/>
Interdependance is much healthier. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Also I tend to think that unschoolers here and homeschoolers generally <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
watch that much. &quot; <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers here? Well that is going to vary a lot from person to <br/>
person. <br/>
I&#39;ve read of some that do watch a lot, I don&#39;t. But just because I <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I will dictate my childrens viewing any longer. <br/>
Homeschoolers in general probably villianize tv to a large degree. <br/>
That&#39;s been my experience, because many homeschoolers still carry a lot <br/>
of <br/>
school ideas into their lives. <br/>
I suggest that we&#39;ve all been duped, and letting children choose is the <br/>
better way. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958329618">OK, I&#39;m going to post some stuff here that is totally embarassing to me now.<br/>
Much of which I no longer agree with, but I actually said a couple of years <br/>
ago.  Some of it wasn&#39;t true (like about me not being a tv addict, I failed <br/>
to mention that I WAS one when I first owned a tv) but I felt the need to <br/>
defend my beliefs against the WISE words of Anne, Joyce and Sandra....others <br/>
too.<br/>
So what follows is only MY posts, over a very long conversation about tv.<br/>
You can imagine what the other ones were like, similar to the issues <br/>
discussed here recently. In these posts you will see a shift in thinking <br/>
happening, you will also see my reactions to  everyone &quot;ganging up&quot; on my <br/>
beliefs at the time.<br/>
<br/>
This is VERY lengthy, I think you should probably skip this email unless it&#39;s <br/>
really relevant to your life right now. If you&#39;re wondering about letting go <br/>
of restricting tv, this is the post for you!!<br/>
You&#39;ll at least see that some of us die hards weren&#39;t always so open minded. <br/>

I think this is a very personal topic, each family has to do what works <br/>
for <br/>
them. I feel that all forms of entertainment need to be put in <br/>
perspective <br/>
and prioritized. To me tv, computer games and gameboy are mostly <br/>
entertainment value. Yes, my kids learn certain positive things from <br/>
each of <br/>
these, they are not bad in and of themselves...but I do limit the <br/>
amount of <br/>
time we do those activities. This has worked for us and we let the kids <br/>
be <br/>
part of the decision on what is a healthy amount of time, and then only <br/>
after <br/>
the chores, activities, errands etc.... are done do we allow them to <br/>
sit and <br/>
veg. This may not sound very &quot;unschooled&quot; but it works in our family. <br/>
The <br/>
kids don&#39;t feel cheated and I have some sanity. There are always those <br/>
days <br/>
where I just let them choose 100% but if I do that all the time <br/>
everything <br/>
seems to fall apart. <br/>

I guess I believe along Charlotte Masons&#39; ideas on this topic. That it <br/>
is <br/>
good and healthy to be outdoors for long periods of time....how do you <br/>
do <br/>
that if hours and hours are spent at a tv or electronics games? You do <br/>
what <br/>
works for your family, we do what works for us right? I feel that <br/>
technology <br/>
has many benefits but one negative is that we become too dependant on <br/>
it...and yes, my kids VEG when in front of a tv. That&#39;s fine at times <br/>
but if <br/>
I let them choose 100%of the time they spend all day for many days in a <br/>
row <br/>
with no sign of interest in anything else. They have told me they feel <br/>
better <br/>
and enjoy the day more when I regulate it and remind them to &quot;come <br/>
outside <br/>
and play&quot; or go swim or whatever. I think that&#39;s where parental <br/>
experience <br/>
comes in to play...at some age they have to choose on their own but as <br/>
they <br/>
show growth and maturity I let go more and more. You may see this as <br/>
too much <br/>
control but I do view excess amounts of electronics as negative. It is <br/>
not <br/>
negative in and of itself but when it begins to rob your life of <br/>
contact with <br/>
family members and doing the other things you love---it&#39;s too much! I&#39;m <br/>
not <br/>
telling you how to run things in your house...just what works for us. <br/>
There <br/>
are numerous studies that show anything in excess of 2 hours of tv per <br/>
day is <br/>
detrimental....maybe that isn&#39;t true for everyone but I personally feel <br/>
like <br/>
it&#39;s a big time waster. It is a passive activity..not the games, but <br/>
the tv. <br/>
And too much of that causes my oldest to become very aggressive and not <br/>
fun <br/>
to be around. I grew up without a tv and guess what? I was not someone <br/>
that <br/>
became &quot;bored&quot; because I could think up my own things to do...there was <br/>
always reading, putting on skits, building tree forts, sledding or <br/>
something <br/>
else to do. I think people today are not in touch enough with the <br/>
earth, with <br/>
the animals and things that grow under their feet. It is important to <br/>
me that <br/>
my children spend a lot of time outdoors so that they have the <br/>
opportunity to <br/>
learn about and be connected to the earth. Of course you can do this <br/>
and <br/>
watch tv, play games etc... but we are on the topic of EXCESS time <br/>
spent <br/>
doing those things. Live and let live, each person has to do what works <br/>
for <br/>
them. <br/>

I think that&#39;s great that it worked out that way...I&#39;m not willing to <br/>
have <br/>
the tv on that much of the time at our house. Call it a hang up if you <br/>
must, <br/>
but I&#39;m very old fashioned that way. I think along the lines of how the <br/>
Indians lived...totally in touch with the earth and how to live off of <br/>
it. <br/>
No, we usually don&#39;t have to do that now but I feel very strongly about <br/>
being <br/>
in touch with the life force that sustains us and not absorbing <br/>
ourselves in <br/>
excess amounts of technology. I agree with you Joyce about not across <br/>
the <br/>
board applying someones views, but that is the part of Charlotte Mason <br/>
I <br/>
choose to apply. Not because she was &quot;right&quot; but because we feel a <br/>
connection <br/>
to her words about being outdoors. And we do not have &quot;outdoor time&quot; <br/>
any more <br/>
than we have math time. I choose to limit tv and gameboy, I don&#39;t think <br/>
that <br/>
makes me an evil parent! Maybe you are all right and it will backfire <br/>
on <br/>
me...they will turn into tv junkies for the rest of their lives, but I <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
think so. Growing up without one in my house did not limit my world nor <br/>
did <br/>
it turn me into a tv addict. What if we chose not to have one in our <br/>
house? <br/>
Would that make me overly controlling? I don&#39;t see these things as <br/>
necessary <br/>
to a full life. Just an extra. The only reason we own one is to view <br/>
videos <br/>
and have access to news occasionally....my kids and I did not have one <br/>
for 6 <br/>
months last year and it was awesome. Didn&#39;t miss it. Maybe I&#39;m stuck in <br/>
the <br/>
past (and no, I don&#39;t have illusions about the difficulties people <br/>
faced not <br/>
so long ago) but I like living a fairly simple life, I don&#39;t believe <br/>
that <br/>
deprives my kids of anything. You may have a point about the <br/>
studies...obviously there are a lot of factors that aren&#39;t taken in to <br/>
account. My feeling is that sometimes the kids they study have <br/>
neglectful <br/>
parents that are absent or out of it and the kids just sit in front of <br/>
the tv <br/>
most of the day, every day. I personally don&#39;t see any benefit from <br/>
sitting <br/>
in front of it every day but that&#39;s an individuals choice. My only <br/>
point <br/>
before was not that parents should limit their childrens time doing <br/>
these <br/>
things, but that if they choose to I personally do not see a problem <br/>
with <br/>
that. Unschooling means I allow my children to self-educate--and yes, <br/>
that <br/>
may mean vegging at times. But I do not hand complete control of that <br/>
area <br/>
over to them and that is a good thing for us. <br/>

By renallyn6 on Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - 05:42 pm:<br/>
The topic started with a question on whether a mom should limit the <br/>
time her <br/>
son spent on an electronic game and some of us responded that yes, we <br/>
would <br/>
(which evolved into the tv debate) and others said No, they would no <br/>
worry <br/>
about it. Topics often evolve into other discussions which are very <br/>
valuable <br/>
even if not totally linked with the first question, yk? I agree with <br/>
some of <br/>
you, I have a son that is a bit addictive with it ( any electronic <br/>
games, tv <br/>
you name it) and I set a very good example as far as being active. I am <br/>
a <br/>
mother of four that kickboxes, plays tennis, runs, bikes, takes yoga, <br/>
paints, <br/>
teaches art classes etc... almost every week I do all of the above!! <br/>
And yet, <br/>
if I don&#39;t limit the electronic entertainment, my son will choose it <br/>
every <br/>
time. Its funny, I brought up this discussion with him and mentioned <br/>
that I <br/>
would like his input again on this topic. He said that he wants it <br/>
limited <br/>
because he finds that his day goes better but asked me if I would be <br/>
willing <br/>
to up his gameboy time by 15 minutes. I was fine with that. My example <br/>
does <br/>
rub off but not enough to keep him from doing nothing but tv almost all <br/>
day <br/>
every day. I am all for limits imposed by parents. It sounds like a lot <br/>
of <br/>
you have not had to impose the limits and it&#39;s worked out really well. <br/>
But <br/>
their are different kids with different personalities and each of us <br/>
has to <br/>
find what works and what we are comfortable with YK? And my son is <br/>
equally <br/>
affected by the games, tv and computer. Anything passive he finds very <br/>
addictive and it makes him MEAN if he gets too much...it&#39;s very <br/>
obvious. <br/>

I&#39;m not willing to go through the months and months it may take to let <br/>
him <br/>
get to that point, nor am I willing to let him turn into the mean guy <br/>
in the <br/>
house to acheive that end. I have let it go for several days in a row <br/>
with no <br/>
control and it makes the day very unhappy for all involved. Not all <br/>
kids are <br/>
like that, but he is. And I don&#39;t think scarcity is the problem as he <br/>
has had <br/>
long binges and gets to play it every day if he wants--just AFTER he <br/>
completes chores and whatever else he has planned. We set a limit on <br/>
time and <br/>
make sure the household goals for the day are met. At that point he is <br/>
free <br/>
to choose his gameboy up to the amount of time he has preset with us. I <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
see that letting a child use tv, electronic games, etc... as much as <br/>
and as <br/>
often as they want always has the effect you are talking about. For <br/>
most kids <br/>
maybe, but everyone is different that way. He has spent entire days <br/>
playing <br/>
Nintendo (at a friends house, we will not buy one) and done nothing but <br/>
be <br/>
mean to his brother and end the day with quite an attitude problem. He <br/>
is not <br/>
usually like this. Anyway, I understand your point about withholding <br/>
things <br/>
and it becomes the &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; but I don&#39;t think that healthy (in <br/>
my <br/>
mind) regulation is a bad thing in every case. I could live without any <br/>
of <br/>
it, so the fact that we own gameboys and tv is a sign of my willingness <br/>
to <br/>
let them choose. And I do not prescribe a certain time as &quot;outdoor <br/>
time&quot; but <br/>
I do kick them out if they start acting like they have cabin <br/>
fever...LOL. <br/>
Usually they go down to the creek and forget about electricity all <br/>
together...mud is wonderful for that! And yes, I spend a lot of time <br/>
down <br/>
there with them, getting eaten by the large and hungry Florida <br/>
mosquitoes!! <br/>

I appreciate your thoughts on this topic. And as usual they make me <br/>
think. I <br/>
am personally not willing to spend money on a gaming system of any <br/>
kind, we <br/>
are very simple with anything materialistic and prefer to spend our <br/>
money on <br/>
travel. Now if my son were to save his own money and want to purchas it <br/>
himself that would be a different matter. He has saved $30.00 to buy <br/>
the new <br/>
Zelda game for his gameboy. Now on the issue of me keeping him from <br/>
it...that <br/>
is definitely not where the anger comes from. This is a child that <br/>
tends to <br/>
get grumpy if he does anything passive for too long (even reading) and <br/>
needs <br/>
to move physically a lot. Doesn&#39;t like to sit still and fidgets a lot, <br/>
just <br/>
his way. My younger son doesn&#39;t get the mean streak from gaming and tv <br/>
and <br/>
could care less about it if you mention doing something else. They are <br/>
just <br/>
different souls. He has asked me to limit his time as he feels better <br/>
when <br/>
he&#39;s not on it too much. There isn&#39;t any anger directed at me for <br/>
limiting <br/>
it, but then, he is part of the process of choosing how much time is <br/>
appropriate. And I&#39;m a lot more relaxed about it all when the house is <br/>
in <br/>
order and we are done with that part of our responsibilities. This is <br/>
an <br/>
ongoing process though, as he is getting close to being a teen. <br/>
Obviously he <br/>
knows my hesitations over the health of excess tv and games but he&#39;s <br/>
taught <br/>
me a lot on that topic himself. He&#39;s been obsessed with this Zelda game <br/>
he <br/>
wants to buy and talks about it constantly. I realized I was getting <br/>
irritated about his obsession with it and when he picked up on that we <br/>
had a <br/>
little converstion. He pointed out that I was not trusting him enough <br/>
and I <br/>
agreed and let it go. I realized I was labeling the game (because I <br/>
know how <br/>
obsessed he&#39;ll get for a while after buying it) as noneducational. A <br/>
not so <br/>
good trap to get into. Anyway, I do listen to him and he taught me <br/>
something <br/>
that day. But I still won&#39;t be buying a Nintendo system..my dh and I <br/>
agree <br/>
that we&#39;d rather spend our money in other ways. That will be up to my <br/>
son. <br/>
And we limit the tv time for all of us, not just my son...so maybe <br/>
that&#39;s why <br/>
he doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s a big deal. I hate households where the adults <br/>
have <br/>
different rules for the kids than they do for themselves....that&#39;s not <br/>
what <br/>
I&#39;m trying to do here. <br/>

I think it&#39;s ok to agree to disagree also...YK? Just because different <br/>
unschooling parents do things differently in each home does not make <br/>
them <br/>
&quot;less&quot; or &quot;more&quot; unschool. Yes, there are those that do not understand <br/>
the <br/>
concept and are calling what they do unschool but the majority are <br/>
indeed <br/>
unschooling, with differing views on tv, teeth brushing etc... I <br/>
understand <br/>
what you are saying about making your point well defined to encourage <br/>
people <br/>
and teach each other but I think sometimes you will come up against <br/>
well-informed, intelligent people that just plain disagree with you. <br/>
But I <br/>
don&#39;t feel the need to make everyone do things my way, just explaining <br/>
why I <br/>
do it the way I do. My kids actually have a lot of freedom with most of <br/>
this...I just expect certain things done before we do other <br/>
activities--helps <br/>
me be calm when the house is straightened-this might not bother another <br/>
person but it does me. And maybe I&#39;ll think exactly like all of you at <br/>
some <br/>
point but then again, maybe I will always feel this way? I&#39;m leaving it <br/>
open. <br/>
There are no black and whites on this issue to me...just different <br/>
people, <br/>
with different methods. And the way we do it works so right now I&#39;m not <br/>
messing with it...LOL. <br/>

I too, decided to relax and &quot;see&quot; what would happen...obviously this <br/>
hasn&#39;t <br/>
been long enough for self regulation to kick in but I hate the sound of <br/>
the <br/>
D___ thing all day. My dh also gets cranky with constant noise. I have <br/>
found <br/>
that my kids are fine if I say &quot;can we go do something else now?&quot; they <br/>
just <br/>
need a little prompt (not a demand) They have found a couple shows they <br/>
really want to watch every day, other than that they don&#39;t mind leaving <br/>
it <br/>
alone. This discussion has prompted a lot of thought on my part about <br/>
my <br/>
views and where the negative thoughts about certain things come from. I <br/>
was <br/>
actually asking my son how to play Pokemon on the game boy and he <br/>
showed me a <br/>
bunch of tricks to it. So yes, I still regulate the tv....but I&#39;m <br/>
questioning <br/>
my motives more often. My kids act relieved when I suggest another <br/>
activity, <br/>
like they can&#39;t unglue by themselves...maybe it just takes more time. <br/>
<br/>
By renallyn6 on Tuesday, July 3, 2001 - 03:28 pm:<br/>
well I&#39;m definitely a freak, so I guess I shouldn&#39;t expect my kids to <br/>
be any <br/>
different..lol. I too, have relaxed and had some major ups and downs <br/>
over it. <br/>
I have decided to give them more control but still insist they help out <br/>
first. Actually, I have not had to insist...they are very willing and <br/>
ready <br/>
to help out. Probably because they can hardly beleive their luck on <br/>
very <br/>
little control over tv and gameboy. I have to say though, my oldest has <br/>
spent <br/>
three full days on his gameboy since he bought the new Zelda game for <br/>
it. How <br/>
long do you let it go before you worry about their health? I do not <br/>
agree <br/>
with sitting on your tushy all day...not healthy. But I&#39;m hearing your <br/>
words <br/>
(Sandra, Anne and others) and letting him have time to figure it out <br/>
before I <br/>
intervene too heavily. He&#39;s been relatively pleasant--he thinks some <br/>
games <br/>
put him in a rotten mood because you have to go up one level at a time <br/>
and <br/>
it&#39;s frustrating, where in the Zelda game you can go around anywhere <br/>
you want <br/>
and work out different puzzles (kind of unschoolish eh? hmmmmmm). So <br/>
we&#39;re <br/>
learning and adjusting and in the mean time I am sick of hearing the tv <br/>
on <br/>
also. <br/>

Yeah, the earplugs hurt after a while. I think a large part of the <br/>
problem is <br/>
living in a tiny house (1250 sf) with six people that really value <br/>
their <br/>
private spaces. When I can&#39;t hear the tv all the time it does not bug <br/>
me so <br/>
much. And I&#39;m really proud that he could analyze himself so well and <br/>
figure <br/>
out what made him grumpy about certain games...this thread had a lot to <br/>
do <br/>
with our conversations over it, I was really impressed with his <br/>
insights on <br/>
the issue. I&#39;ve heard a couple of &quot;damn&quot;s coming from the bedroom but <br/>
he <br/>
doesn&#39;t emerge in this rotten, be rude to everyone mode. A pleasant <br/>
change <br/>
for sure. And he spends his own money on the games so it was a big deal <br/>
the <br/>
way he went about it. He ended up trading in some old games and hardly <br/>
spending any money to buy it so he had some money for the game guide <br/>
and <br/>
whatever else he wants. So he practiced his own budgeting <br/>
again....something <br/>
I sure wish I had learned at a young age. <br/>
<br/>
I think that I have a hard time with letting them sit around because dh <br/>
and I <br/>
are very active. I work out almost every day and we&#39;re training for a <br/>
triathlon right now. But then I have to stop and remember, the kid <br/>
LOVES swim <br/>
team and goes to practice every day of the week with very few <br/>
exceptions...so <br/>
relax right? Not so easy to do. I perceive his excess time on it as a <br/>
waste <br/>
of time (not so easy to rid yourself of that one) and I&#39;m still not <br/>
sure how <br/>
comfortable I am with this idea of self-regulation ( ok, ok, I&#39;m not <br/>
comfortable at all...but work with me here). But I have noticed a <br/>
considerable change in their attitude when I ask them to help me with <br/>
household stuff or other things...maybe the control over this is <br/>
helping them <br/>
feel less controlled (even though I did not feel I was very controlling <br/>
over <br/>
all...just on that issue). Well, one day at a time...not making any <br/>
promises <br/>
here. Just trying to find the balance. <br/>

I&#39;m probably one of the only other people here that does believe it&#39;s <br/>
ok to <br/>
limit tv when necessary. I find my one son getting very lazy and not <br/>
interested in other activities for DAYS on end if I don&#39;t say anything. <br/>
If I <br/>
say &quot;ok, enough tv for today&quot; and suggest that we do something, he is <br/>
usually <br/>
glad for it. If he&#39;s in the middle of something he really wants to <br/>
watch I <br/>
just say &quot;ok, when that&#39;s over do you think we could go do something?&quot; <br/>
and he <br/>
always is fine with that. I have relaxed a lot over the whole issue but <br/>
I <br/>
think there are some kids that are more addictive and affected by it <br/>
than <br/>
others. I just disagree with total self regulation on that <br/>
topic....sorry. I <br/>
do believe it is best to be relaxed over it and I&#39;m glad that self <br/>
regulation <br/>
works for all of you. <br/>

By ren on Friday, August 10, 2001 - 08:10 pm:<br/>
Ok, I know this is a little OT....I noticed my kids will eat oodles of <br/>
veggies and healthy stuff if I make it as readily available as the <br/>
junk. The <br/>
key to junk food is that you open a package and it&#39;s ready to eat...if <br/>
you <br/>
have healthy stuff as easy to get to, they will eat it just as much as <br/>
the <br/>
junk. At least, this is an observance I&#39;ve made with my own and my <br/>
neices/nephews. <br/>
<br/>
I think tv could be like that too....the more options available, the <br/>
more <br/>
they will balance it all. <br/>

The first thing I thought when I read your post Tam is &quot;they haven&#39;t <br/>
had <br/>
enough time to deschool&quot;.... <br/>
It took mine over a year, and we were very relaxed homeschoolers prior <br/>
to <br/>
that. Around 1 1/2 years later I started seeing some &quot;sparks&quot; of <br/>
inventiveness I hadn&#39;t before. <br/>
That&#39;s not to say they suddenly developed a yearning for math lessons <br/>
or <br/>
writing. My 8 y.o. doesn&#39;t read. My 11 1/2 y.o. couldn&#39;t tell us 10 <br/>
times 5 <br/>
last night! I KNOW I taught him the 10X tables at least twice!! But you <br/>
know <br/>
what? It has to be meaningful for them or it won&#39;t stick anyway. Being <br/>
in <br/>
touch with oneself is so much more important than when they learn to <br/>
write or <br/>
do math equations. <br/>
Keep trusting them, keep trusting yourself. It really does work. <br/>
I totally understand your apprehension about not &quot;strewing their paths&quot; <br/>
enough. I have felt guilt over that lately too...going back to work and <br/>
a new <br/>
baby are eating up my time. But when I stand back and look at it in an <br/>
unschooling perspective, it is rosy! The boys have battled their Dad <br/>
nightly <br/>
in Pokemon (the card game) which is massive amounts of strategical <br/>
thinking, <br/>
reading, math etc... We&#39;ve done relay races in the driveway, bike rides <br/>
etc... we had a birthday party for their stuffed animals yesterday <br/>
(complete <br/>
with decorated cake and candles) So NO, it doesn&#39;t look like school in <br/>
any <br/>
way. But we are living life, as a family, complete with cleaning house, <br/>
watching tv and just hanging out too. <br/>
Your girls are learning what an appraisal is. How many kids have ever <br/>
even <br/>
seen an appraiser? I bet most of them are in school when important <br/>
things <br/>
about their lives are going on. Don&#39;t take for granted the flow of <br/>
daily <br/>
living and what that teaches. It&#39;s REAL life...YOUR life. And they are <br/>
absorbing all of that. <br/>

Having formerly been a little controling, and now pretty much letting <br/>
them <br/>
choose I can relate to both sides of this issue. <br/>
I have found that my kids often would love to do something else, but I <br/>
have <br/>
to come up with an idea or just ask them if they&#39;d like to go somewhere <br/>
today. I have also noticed they tend to watch more tv (or play gameboy) <br/>
after <br/>
being very social. Like down time for them. <br/>
I have noticed my kids being much less obsessive about the tv now that <br/>
I&#39;m <br/>
more relaxed. I think Sandra, Anne and others are right about that <br/>
&quot;forbidden <br/>
fruit&quot; thing! <br/>
There is nothing wrong with waiting until a fave show is over and <br/>
saying <br/>
&quot;hey, lets&#39; go outside and play tag&quot; or whatever. <br/>

I had no TV for a while, I also had negative associations with tv. <br/>
I got my feathers ruffled a little bit when bringing up my viewpoints <br/>
in this <br/>
very forum not too long ago. <br/>
That annoyed feeling made me think though. <br/>
It made me ponder and question if maybe the people here were right!! <br/>
COULD I be causing addictive behavior in my children with my control? <br/>
Was I hindering their world in some way? <br/>
I finally had to admit that MY views on tv were just that.....MINE. <br/>
My children have a right to choose their own life. <br/>
And they have now. <br/>
Trevor had many years of control so he is still acting fairly obsessive <br/>
with <br/>
the new cable we had installed. <br/>
Better now, with the safety and guidance of his parents than later on <br/>
his own <br/>
imo. <br/>
It&#39;s not fair for one persons prejudices to decide the entire <br/>
household. <br/>
Now that I see tv for what it is, just another tool, we have really <br/>
enjoyed <br/>
some wonderful moments as a family. <br/>
My kids have learned a TON from it. <br/>
I just can&#39;t fathom an unschooler not having a tv and shunning all the <br/>
learning opportunities just because of their own prejudices against it. <br/>
To me, unschooling means using all of the tools at our disposal, to <br/>
shun one <br/>
tool means losing out on a host of opportunities that any other tool <br/>
can&#39;t <br/>
offer. <br/>
All of those benefits to not owning one, that were listed above? <br/>
Can you believe that we have that AND a telly? <br/>
Hmmm.... <br/>
The television is not evil. It&#39;s just a tool. <br/>
You can use it or not use it as you choose.....It doesn&#39;t take over <br/>
your life <br/>
unless you want it to. <br/>
Some of these responses make me wonder if people think television is <br/>
akin to <br/>
smoking and causes addiction. <br/>
Why would you think that tv owners are less likely to really listen to <br/>
their <br/>
spouses or listen to them 100%? <br/>
Do you think we all sit in front of the tv every time we have a <br/>
conversation? <br/>
I find that remark insulting, as though we tv owners can&#39;t have <br/>
effective <br/>
communication or healthy marriages!!! Sheesh. <br/>
And insulting Sandra was really lame after you asked for her opinion. <br/>

. &quot;I will experiment with candy and get back to you&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Then it won&#39;t work. <br/>
You can&#39;t expect an experiment to reap the benefits we are talking <br/>
about. <br/>
Only total, long term trust will bring the results being discussed in <br/>
this <br/>
forum. <br/>
You will try the &quot;experiment&quot;, see the children gorging themselves sick <br/>
on <br/>
candy and junk most likely (because they haven&#39;t learned self control <br/>
yet) <br/>
and you will say &quot;this does NOT work, what is wrong with those people?&quot; <br/>
It only reaps the benefits when the trust and non-control are always <br/>
there. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s ok with me at this point to let my children miss the learning <br/>
that is <br/>
available through television because of what I view as the negative <br/>
aspects <br/>
of it - to me this over-rides what is positive. Some of these negative <br/>
aspects are: lack of attention and less independant creative play (I&#39;ve <br/>
seen <br/>
this repeatedly as a pre-school teacher) and the desire to be <br/>
entertained &quot; <br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re suggesting is that because there are unhealthy/negative <br/>
things on <br/>
television, you will shut down the positive aspects of it? <br/>
That&#39;s like burning down the library because there are books that are <br/>
negative. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;lack of attention and less independant creative play&quot; <br/>
??? <br/>
Really? Well, that is not true in my house. <br/>
My 8 y.o. ds loves spending time by himself. He is highly creative, <br/>
prefers <br/>
to daydream alone much of the time, putter in the woods or draw. <br/>
He has unlimited access to tv, food, books etc... and yet I see his <br/>
creativity abound. <br/>
He is very good at entertaining himself. All of my kids are. But I have <br/>
a 12 <br/>
y.o. that is still obsessing with the tv because we didn&#39;t have one for <br/>
a <br/>
while....... <br/>
I suggest you are inferring things from a limited point of view. <br/>
Kids in school can&#39;t even be compared to unschoolers in that area. <br/>
Everything in their lives seems to be controlled, forced and limited. <br/>
Of course their creativity is stifled. <br/>
And independant play is not necessarily a good thing. <br/>
Some people need more person to person interaction, others are more <br/>
introverted. <br/>
I don&#39;t think that independant play is a goal for unschoolers with <br/>
preschoolers. <br/>
Independance is overrated. <br/>
Interdependance is much healthier. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Also I tend to think that unschoolers here and homeschoolers generally <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
watch that much. &quot; <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers here? Well that is going to vary a lot from person to <br/>
person. <br/>
I&#39;ve read of some that do watch a lot, I don&#39;t. But just because I <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I will dictate my childrens viewing any longer. <br/>
Homeschoolers in general probably villianize tv to a large degree. <br/>
That&#39;s been my experience, because many homeschoolers still carry a lot <br/>
of <br/>
school ideas into their lives. <br/>
I suggest that we&#39;ve all been duped, and letting children choose is the <br/>
better way. <br/>

Thank you so much for posting this. I have saved it and plan to read it once<br/>
a week until I have stopped panicking at the amount of TV my kids are now<br/>
indulging in.<br/>
<br/>
I told them at the beginning of the week, they could decide how much they<br/>
wanted to watch and they literally danced for joy before running over and<br/>
hugging me!!<br/>

<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; OK, I&#39;m going to post some stuff here that is totally embarassing to me<br/>
now.<br/>
&gt; Much of which I no longer agree with, but I actually said a couple of<br/>
years<br/>
&gt; ago.  Some of it wasn&#39;t true (like about me not being a tv addict, I<br/>
failed<br/>
&gt; to mention that I WAS one when I first owned a tv) but I felt the need to<br/>
&gt; defend my beliefs against the WISE words of Anne, Joyce and<br/>
Sandra....others<br/>
&gt; too.<br/>
&gt; So what follows is only MY posts, over a very long conversation about tv.<br/>
&gt; You can imagine what the other ones were like, similar to the issues<br/>
&gt; discussed here recently. In these posts you will see a shift in thinking<br/>
&gt; happening, you will also see my reactions to  everyone &quot;ganging up&quot; on my<br/>
&gt; beliefs at the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is VERY lengthy, I think you should probably skip this email unless<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; really relevant to your life right now. If you&#39;re wondering about letting<br/>
go<br/>
&gt; of restricting tv, this is the post for you!!<br/>
&gt; You&#39;ll at least see that some of us die hards weren&#39;t always so open<br/>
minded.<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>

&gt; I think this is a very personal topic, each family has to do what works<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; them. I feel that all forms of entertainment need to be put in<br/>
&gt; perspective<br/>
&gt; and prioritized. To me tv, computer games and gameboy are mostly<br/>
&gt; entertainment value. Yes, my kids learn certain positive things from<br/>
&gt; each of<br/>
&gt; these, they are not bad in and of themselves...but I do limit the<br/>
&gt; amount of<br/>
&gt; time we do those activities. This has worked for us and we let the kids<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; part of the decision on what is a healthy amount of time, and then only<br/>
&gt; after<br/>
&gt; the chores, activities, errands etc.... are done do we allow them to<br/>
&gt; sit and<br/>
&gt; veg. This may not sound very &quot;unschooled&quot; but it works in our family.<br/>
&gt; The<br/>
&gt; kids don&#39;t feel cheated and I have some sanity. There are always those<br/>
&gt; days<br/>
&gt; where I just let them choose 100% but if I do that all the time<br/>
&gt; everything<br/>
&gt; seems to fall apart.<br/>

&gt; I guess I believe along Charlotte Masons&#39; ideas on this topic. That it<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; good and healthy to be outdoors for long periods of time....how do you<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; that if hours and hours are spent at a tv or electronics games? You do<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; works for your family, we do what works for us right? I feel that<br/>
&gt; technology<br/>
&gt; has many benefits but one negative is that we become too dependant on<br/>
&gt; it...and yes, my kids VEG when in front of a tv. That&#39;s fine at times<br/>
&gt; but if<br/>
&gt; I let them choose 100%of the time they spend all day for many days in a<br/>
&gt; row<br/>
&gt; with no sign of interest in anything else. They have told me they feel<br/>
&gt; better<br/>
&gt; and enjoy the day more when I regulate it and remind them to &quot;come<br/>
&gt; outside<br/>
&gt; and play&quot; or go swim or whatever. I think that&#39;s where parental<br/>
&gt; experience<br/>
&gt; comes in to play...at some age they have to choose on their own but as<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; show growth and maturity I let go more and more. You may see this as<br/>
&gt; too much<br/>
&gt; control but I do view excess amounts of electronics as negative. It is<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; negative in and of itself but when it begins to rob your life of<br/>
&gt; contact with<br/>
&gt; family members and doing the other things you love---it&#39;s too much! I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; telling you how to run things in your house...just what works for us.<br/>
&gt; There<br/>
&gt; are numerous studies that show anything in excess of 2 hours of tv per<br/>
&gt; day is<br/>
&gt; detrimental....maybe that isn&#39;t true for everyone but I personally feel<br/>
&gt; like<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a big time waster. It is a passive activity..not the games, but<br/>
&gt; the tv.<br/>
&gt; And too much of that causes my oldest to become very aggressive and not<br/>
&gt; fun<br/>
&gt; to be around. I grew up without a tv and guess what? I was not someone<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; became &quot;bored&quot; because I could think up my own things to do...there was<br/>
&gt; always reading, putting on skits, building tree forts, sledding or<br/>
&gt; something<br/>
&gt; else to do. I think people today are not in touch enough with the<br/>
&gt; earth, with<br/>
&gt; the animals and things that grow under their feet. It is important to<br/>
&gt; me that<br/>
&gt; my children spend a lot of time outdoors so that they have the<br/>
&gt; opportunity to<br/>
&gt; learn about and be connected to the earth. Of course you can do this<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; watch tv, play games etc... but we are on the topic of EXCESS time<br/>
&gt; spent<br/>
&gt; doing those things. Live and let live, each person has to do what works<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>

&gt; I think that&#39;s great that it worked out that way...I&#39;m not willing to<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; the tv on that much of the time at our house. Call it a hang up if you<br/>
&gt; must,<br/>
&gt; but I&#39;m very old fashioned that way. I think along the lines of how the<br/>
&gt; Indians lived...totally in touch with the earth and how to live off of<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; No, we usually don&#39;t have to do that now but I feel very strongly about<br/>
&gt; being<br/>
&gt; in touch with the life force that sustains us and not absorbing<br/>
&gt; ourselves in<br/>
&gt; excess amounts of technology. I agree with you Joyce about not across<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; board applying someones views, but that is the part of Charlotte Mason<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; choose to apply. Not because she was &quot;right&quot; but because we feel a<br/>
&gt; connection<br/>
&gt; to her words about being outdoors. And we do not have &quot;outdoor time&quot;<br/>
&gt; any more<br/>
&gt; than we have math time. I choose to limit tv and gameboy, I don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; makes me an evil parent! Maybe you are all right and it will backfire<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; me...they will turn into tv junkies for the rest of their lives, but I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think so. Growing up without one in my house did not limit my world nor<br/>
&gt; did<br/>
&gt; it turn me into a tv addict. What if we chose not to have one in our<br/>
&gt; house?<br/>
&gt; Would that make me overly controlling? I don&#39;t see these things as<br/>
&gt; necessary<br/>
&gt; to a full life. Just an extra. The only reason we own one is to view<br/>
&gt; videos<br/>
&gt; and have access to news occasionally....my kids and I did not have one<br/>
&gt; for 6<br/>
&gt; months last year and it was awesome. Didn&#39;t miss it. Maybe I&#39;m stuck in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; past (and no, I don&#39;t have illusions about the difficulties people<br/>
&gt; faced not<br/>
&gt; so long ago) but I like living a fairly simple life, I don&#39;t believe<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; deprives my kids of anything. You may have a point about the<br/>
&gt; studies...obviously there are a lot of factors that aren&#39;t taken in to<br/>
&gt; account. My feeling is that sometimes the kids they study have<br/>
&gt; neglectful<br/>
&gt; parents that are absent or out of it and the kids just sit in front of<br/>
&gt; the tv<br/>
&gt; most of the day, every day. I personally don&#39;t see any benefit from<br/>
&gt; sitting<br/>
&gt; in front of it every day but that&#39;s an individuals choice. My only<br/>
&gt; point<br/>
&gt; before was not that parents should limit their childrens time doing<br/>
&gt; these<br/>
&gt; things, but that if they choose to I personally do not see a problem<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; that. Unschooling means I allow my children to self-educate--and yes,<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; may mean vegging at times. But I do not hand complete control of that<br/>
&gt; area<br/>
&gt; over to them and that is a good thing for us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By renallyn6 on Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - 05:42 pm:<br/>
&gt; The topic started with a question on whether a mom should limit the<br/>
&gt; time her<br/>
&gt; son spent on an electronic game and some of us responded that yes, we<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; (which evolved into the tv debate) and others said No, they would no<br/>
&gt; worry<br/>
&gt; about it. Topics often evolve into other discussions which are very<br/>
&gt; valuable<br/>
&gt; even if not totally linked with the first question, yk? I agree with<br/>
&gt; some of<br/>
&gt; you, I have a son that is a bit addictive with it ( any electronic<br/>
&gt; games, tv<br/>
&gt; you name it) and I set a very good example as far as being active. I am<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; mother of four that kickboxes, plays tennis, runs, bikes, takes yoga,<br/>
&gt; paints,<br/>
&gt; teaches art classes etc... almost every week I do all of the above!!<br/>
&gt; And yet,<br/>
&gt; if I don&#39;t limit the electronic entertainment, my son will choose it<br/>
&gt; every<br/>
&gt; time. Its funny, I brought up this discussion with him and mentioned<br/>
&gt; that I<br/>
&gt; would like his input again on this topic. He said that he wants it<br/>
&gt; limited<br/>
&gt; because he finds that his day goes better but asked me if I would be<br/>
&gt; willing<br/>
&gt; to up his gameboy time by 15 minutes. I was fine with that. My example<br/>
&gt; does<br/>
&gt; rub off but not enough to keep him from doing nothing but tv almost all<br/>
&gt; day<br/>
&gt; every day. I am all for limits imposed by parents. It sounds like a lot<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; you have not had to impose the limits and it&#39;s worked out really well.<br/>
&gt; But<br/>
&gt; their are different kids with different personalities and each of us<br/>
&gt; has to<br/>
&gt; find what works and what we are comfortable with YK? And my son is<br/>
&gt; equally<br/>
&gt; affected by the games, tv and computer. Anything passive he finds very<br/>
&gt; addictive and it makes him MEAN if he gets too much...it&#39;s very<br/>
&gt; obvious.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By renallyn6 on Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - 11:48 pm:<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not willing to go through the months and months it may take to let<br/>
&gt; him<br/>
&gt; get to that point, nor am I willing to let him turn into the mean guy<br/>
&gt; in the<br/>
&gt; house to acheive that end. I have let it go for several days in a row<br/>
&gt; with no<br/>
&gt; control and it makes the day very unhappy for all involved. Not all<br/>
&gt; kids are<br/>
&gt; like that, but he is. And I don&#39;t think scarcity is the problem as he<br/>
&gt; has had<br/>
&gt; long binges and gets to play it every day if he wants--just AFTER he<br/>
&gt; completes chores and whatever else he has planned. We set a limit on<br/>
&gt; time and<br/>
&gt; make sure the household goals for the day are met. At that point he is<br/>
&gt; free<br/>
&gt; to choose his gameboy up to the amount of time he has preset with us. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; see that letting a child use tv, electronic games, etc... as much as<br/>
&gt; and as<br/>
&gt; often as they want always has the effect you are talking about. For<br/>
&gt; most kids<br/>
&gt; maybe, but everyone is different that way. He has spent entire days<br/>
&gt; playing<br/>
&gt; Nintendo (at a friends house, we will not buy one) and done nothing but<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; mean to his brother and end the day with quite an attitude problem. He<br/>
&gt; is not<br/>
&gt; usually like this. Anyway, I understand your point about withholding<br/>
&gt; things<br/>
&gt; and it becomes the &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; but I don&#39;t think that healthy (in<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; mind) regulation is a bad thing in every case. I could live without any<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; it, so the fact that we own gameboys and tv is a sign of my willingness<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; let them choose. And I do not prescribe a certain time as &quot;outdoor<br/>
&gt; time&quot; but<br/>
&gt; I do kick them out if they start acting like they have cabin<br/>
&gt; fever...LOL.<br/>
&gt; Usually they go down to the creek and forget about electricity all<br/>
&gt; together...mud is wonderful for that! And yes, I spend a lot of time<br/>
&gt; down<br/>
&gt; there with them, getting eaten by the large and hungry Florida<br/>
&gt; mosquitoes!!<br/>

&gt; I appreciate your thoughts on this topic. And as usual they make me<br/>
&gt; think. I<br/>
&gt; am personally not willing to spend money on a gaming system of any<br/>
&gt; kind, we<br/>
&gt; are very simple with anything materialistic and prefer to spend our<br/>
&gt; money on<br/>
&gt; travel. Now if my son were to save his own money and want to purchas it<br/>
&gt; himself that would be a different matter. He has saved $30.00 to buy<br/>
&gt; the new<br/>
&gt; Zelda game for his gameboy. Now on the issue of me keeping him from<br/>
&gt; it...that<br/>
&gt; is definitely not where the anger comes from. This is a child that<br/>
&gt; tends to<br/>
&gt; get grumpy if he does anything passive for too long (even reading) and<br/>
&gt; needs<br/>
&gt; to move physically a lot. Doesn&#39;t like to sit still and fidgets a lot,<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; his way. My younger son doesn&#39;t get the mean streak from gaming and tv<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; could care less about it if you mention doing something else. They are<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; different souls. He has asked me to limit his time as he feels better<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s not on it too much. There isn&#39;t any anger directed at me for<br/>
&gt; limiting<br/>
&gt; it, but then, he is part of the process of choosing how much time is<br/>
&gt; appropriate. And I&#39;m a lot more relaxed about it all when the house is<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; order and we are done with that part of our responsibilities. This is<br/>
&gt; an<br/>
&gt; ongoing process though, as he is getting close to being a teen.<br/>
&gt; Obviously he<br/>
&gt; knows my hesitations over the health of excess tv and games but he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; taught<br/>
&gt; me a lot on that topic himself. He&#39;s been obsessed with this Zelda game<br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; wants to buy and talks about it constantly. I realized I was getting<br/>
&gt; irritated about his obsession with it and when he picked up on that we<br/>
&gt; had a<br/>
&gt; little converstion. He pointed out that I was not trusting him enough<br/>
&gt; and I<br/>
&gt; agreed and let it go. I realized I was labeling the game (because I<br/>
&gt; know how<br/>
&gt; obsessed he&#39;ll get for a while after buying it) as noneducational. A<br/>
&gt; not so<br/>
&gt; good trap to get into. Anyway, I do listen to him and he taught me<br/>
&gt; something<br/>
&gt; that day. But I still won&#39;t be buying a Nintendo system..my dh and I<br/>
&gt; agree<br/>
&gt; that we&#39;d rather spend our money in other ways. That will be up to my<br/>
&gt; son.<br/>
&gt; And we limit the tv time for all of us, not just my son...so maybe<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s why<br/>
&gt; he doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s a big deal. I hate households where the adults<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; different rules for the kids than they do for themselves....that&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m trying to do here.<br/>

&gt; I think it&#39;s ok to agree to disagree also...YK? Just because different<br/>
&gt; unschooling parents do things differently in each home does not make<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; &quot;less&quot; or &quot;more&quot; unschool. Yes, there are those that do not understand<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; concept and are calling what they do unschool but the majority are<br/>
&gt; indeed<br/>
&gt; unschooling, with differing views on tv, teeth brushing etc... I<br/>
&gt; understand<br/>
&gt; what you are saying about making your point well defined to encourage<br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; and teach each other but I think sometimes you will come up against<br/>
&gt; well-informed, intelligent people that just plain disagree with you.<br/>
&gt; But I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t feel the need to make everyone do things my way, just explaining<br/>
&gt; why I<br/>
&gt; do it the way I do. My kids actually have a lot of freedom with most of<br/>
&gt; this...I just expect certain things done before we do other<br/>
&gt; activities--helps<br/>
&gt; me be calm when the house is straightened-this might not bother another<br/>
&gt; person but it does me. And maybe I&#39;ll think exactly like all of you at<br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; point but then again, maybe I will always feel this way? I&#39;m leaving it<br/>
&gt; open.<br/>
&gt; There are no black and whites on this issue to me...just different<br/>
&gt; people,<br/>
&gt; with different methods. And the way we do it works so right now I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; messing with it...LOL.<br/>

&gt; I too, decided to relax and &quot;see&quot; what would happen...obviously this<br/>
&gt; hasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; been long enough for self regulation to kick in but I hate the sound of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; D___ thing all day. My dh also gets cranky with constant noise. I have<br/>
&gt; found<br/>
&gt; that my kids are fine if I say &quot;can we go do something else now?&quot; they<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; need a little prompt (not a demand) They have found a couple shows they<br/>
&gt; really want to watch every day, other than that they don&#39;t mind leaving<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; alone. This discussion has prompted a lot of thought on my part about<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; views and where the negative thoughts about certain things come from. I<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; actually asking my son how to play Pokemon on the game boy and he<br/>
&gt; showed me a<br/>
&gt; bunch of tricks to it. So yes, I still regulate the tv....but I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; questioning<br/>
&gt; my motives more often. My kids act relieved when I suggest another<br/>
&gt; activity,<br/>
&gt; like they can&#39;t unglue by themselves...maybe it just takes more time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By renallyn6 on Tuesday, July 3, 2001 - 03:28 pm:<br/>
&gt; well I&#39;m definitely a freak, so I guess I shouldn&#39;t expect my kids to<br/>
&gt; be any<br/>
&gt; different..lol. I too, have relaxed and had some major ups and downs<br/>
&gt; over it.<br/>
&gt; I have decided to give them more control but still insist they help out<br/>
&gt; first. Actually, I have not had to insist...they are very willing and<br/>
&gt; ready<br/>
&gt; to help out. Probably because they can hardly beleive their luck on<br/>
&gt; very<br/>
&gt; little control over tv and gameboy. I have to say though, my oldest has<br/>
&gt; spent<br/>
&gt; three full days on his gameboy since he bought the new Zelda game for<br/>
&gt; it. How<br/>
&gt; long do you let it go before you worry about their health? I do not<br/>
&gt; agree<br/>
&gt; with sitting on your tushy all day...not healthy. But I&#39;m hearing your<br/>
&gt; words<br/>
&gt; (Sandra, Anne and others) and letting him have time to figure it out<br/>
&gt; before I<br/>
&gt; intervene too heavily. He&#39;s been relatively pleasant--he thinks some<br/>
&gt; games<br/>
&gt; put him in a rotten mood because you have to go up one level at a time<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s frustrating, where in the Zelda game you can go around anywhere<br/>
&gt; you want<br/>
&gt; and work out different puzzles (kind of unschoolish eh? hmmmmmm). So<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; learning and adjusting and in the mean time I am sick of hearing the tv<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; also.<br/>

&gt; Yeah, the earplugs hurt after a while. I think a large part of the<br/>
&gt; problem is<br/>
&gt; living in a tiny house (1250 sf) with six people that really value<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; private spaces. When I can&#39;t hear the tv all the time it does not bug<br/>
&gt; me so<br/>
&gt; much. And I&#39;m really proud that he could analyze himself so well and<br/>
&gt; figure<br/>
&gt; out what made him grumpy about certain games...this thread had a lot to<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; with our conversations over it, I was really impressed with his<br/>
&gt; insights on<br/>
&gt; the issue. I&#39;ve heard a couple of &quot;damn&quot;s coming from the bedroom but<br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t emerge in this rotten, be rude to everyone mode. A pleasant<br/>
&gt; change<br/>
&gt; for sure. And he spends his own money on the games so it was a big deal<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; way he went about it. He ended up trading in some old games and hardly<br/>
&gt; spending any money to buy it so he had some money for the game guide<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; whatever else he wants. So he practiced his own budgeting<br/>
&gt; again....something<br/>
&gt; I sure wish I had learned at a young age.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think that I have a hard time with letting them sit around because dh<br/>
&gt; and I<br/>
&gt; are very active. I work out almost every day and we&#39;re training for a<br/>
&gt; triathlon right now. But then I have to stop and remember, the kid<br/>
&gt; LOVES swim<br/>
&gt; team and goes to practice every day of the week with very few<br/>
&gt; exceptions...so<br/>
&gt; relax right? Not so easy to do. I perceive his excess time on it as a<br/>
&gt; waste<br/>
&gt; of time (not so easy to rid yourself of that one) and I&#39;m still not<br/>
&gt; sure how<br/>
&gt; comfortable I am with this idea of self-regulation ( ok, ok, I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; comfortable at all...but work with me here). But I have noticed a<br/>
&gt; considerable change in their attitude when I ask them to help me with<br/>
&gt; household stuff or other things...maybe the control over this is<br/>
&gt; helping them<br/>
&gt; feel less controlled (even though I did not feel I was very controlling<br/>
&gt; over<br/>
&gt; all...just on that issue). Well, one day at a time...not making any<br/>
&gt; promises<br/>
&gt; here. Just trying to find the balance.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m probably one of the only other people here that does believe it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; ok to<br/>
&gt; limit tv when necessary. I find my one son getting very lazy and not<br/>
&gt; interested in other activities for DAYS on end if I don&#39;t say anything.<br/>
&gt; If I<br/>
&gt; say &quot;ok, enough tv for today&quot; and suggest that we do something, he is<br/>
&gt; usually<br/>
&gt; glad for it. If he&#39;s in the middle of something he really wants to<br/>
&gt; watch I<br/>
&gt; just say &quot;ok, when that&#39;s over do you think we could go do something?&quot;<br/>
&gt; and he<br/>
&gt; always is fine with that. I have relaxed a lot over the whole issue but<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; think there are some kids that are more addictive and affected by it<br/>
&gt; than<br/>
&gt; others. I just disagree with total self regulation on that<br/>
&gt; topic....sorry. I<br/>
&gt; do believe it is best to be relaxed over it and I&#39;m glad that self<br/>
&gt; regulation<br/>
&gt; works for all of you.<br/>

&gt; Ok, I know this is a little OT....I noticed my kids will eat oodles of<br/>
&gt; veggies and healthy stuff if I make it as readily available as the<br/>
&gt; junk. The<br/>
&gt; key to junk food is that you open a package and it&#39;s ready to eat...if<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; have healthy stuff as easy to get to, they will eat it just as much as<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; junk. At least, this is an observance I&#39;ve made with my own and my<br/>
&gt; neices/nephews.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think tv could be like that too....the more options available, the<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; they will balance it all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; The first thing I thought when I read your post Tam is &quot;they haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; had<br/>
&gt; enough time to deschool&quot;....<br/>
&gt; It took mine over a year, and we were very relaxed homeschoolers prior<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; that. Around 1 1/2 years later I started seeing some &quot;sparks&quot; of<br/>
&gt; inventiveness I hadn&#39;t before.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s not to say they suddenly developed a yearning for math lessons<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; writing. My 8 y.o. doesn&#39;t read. My 11 1/2 y.o. couldn&#39;t tell us 10<br/>
&gt; times 5<br/>
&gt; last night! I KNOW I taught him the 10X tables at least twice!! But you<br/>
&gt; know<br/>
&gt; what? It has to be meaningful for them or it won&#39;t stick anyway. Being<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; touch with oneself is so much more important than when they learn to<br/>
&gt; write or<br/>
&gt; do math equations.<br/>
&gt; Keep trusting them, keep trusting yourself. It really does work.<br/>
&gt; I totally understand your apprehension about not &quot;strewing their paths&quot;<br/>
&gt; enough. I have felt guilt over that lately too...going back to work and<br/>
&gt; a new<br/>
&gt; baby are eating up my time. But when I stand back and look at it in an<br/>
&gt; unschooling perspective, it is rosy! The boys have battled their Dad<br/>
&gt; nightly<br/>
&gt; in Pokemon (the card game) which is massive amounts of strategical<br/>
&gt; thinking,<br/>
&gt; reading, math etc... We&#39;ve done relay races in the driveway, bike rides<br/>
&gt; etc... we had a birthday party for their stuffed animals yesterday<br/>
&gt; (complete<br/>
&gt; with decorated cake and candles) So NO, it doesn&#39;t look like school in<br/>
&gt; any<br/>
&gt; way. But we are living life, as a family, complete with cleaning house,<br/>
&gt; watching tv and just hanging out too.<br/>
&gt; Your girls are learning what an appraisal is. How many kids have ever<br/>
&gt; even<br/>
&gt; seen an appraiser? I bet most of them are in school when important<br/>
&gt; things<br/>
&gt; about their lives are going on. Don&#39;t take for granted the flow of<br/>
&gt; daily<br/>
&gt; living and what that teaches. It&#39;s REAL life...YOUR life. And they are<br/>
&gt; absorbing all of that.<br/>

&gt; Having formerly been a little controling, and now pretty much letting<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; choose I can relate to both sides of this issue.<br/>
&gt; I have found that my kids often would love to do something else, but I<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; to come up with an idea or just ask them if they&#39;d like to go somewhere<br/>
&gt; today. I have also noticed they tend to watch more tv (or play gameboy)<br/>
&gt; after<br/>
&gt; being very social. Like down time for them.<br/>
&gt; I have noticed my kids being much less obsessive about the tv now that<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; more relaxed. I think Sandra, Anne and others are right about that<br/>
&gt; &quot;forbidden<br/>
&gt; fruit&quot; thing!<br/>
&gt; There is nothing wrong with waiting until a fave show is over and<br/>
&gt; saying<br/>
&gt; &quot;hey, lets&#39; go outside and play tag&quot; or whatever.<br/>

&gt; I had no TV for a while, I also had negative associations with tv.<br/>
&gt; I got my feathers ruffled a little bit when bringing up my viewpoints<br/>
&gt; in this<br/>
&gt; very forum not too long ago.<br/>
&gt; That annoyed feeling made me think though.<br/>
&gt; It made me ponder and question if maybe the people here were right!!<br/>
&gt; COULD I be causing addictive behavior in my children with my control?<br/>
&gt; Was I hindering their world in some way?<br/>
&gt; I finally had to admit that MY views on tv were just that.....MINE.<br/>
&gt; My children have a right to choose their own life.<br/>
&gt; And they have now.<br/>
&gt; Trevor had many years of control so he is still acting fairly obsessive<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; the new cable we had installed.<br/>
&gt; Better now, with the safety and guidance of his parents than later on<br/>
&gt; his own<br/>
&gt; imo.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not fair for one persons prejudices to decide the entire<br/>
&gt; household.<br/>
&gt; Now that I see tv for what it is, just another tool, we have really<br/>
&gt; enjoyed<br/>
&gt; some wonderful moments as a family.<br/>
&gt; My kids have learned a TON from it.<br/>
&gt; I just can&#39;t fathom an unschooler not having a tv and shunning all the<br/>
&gt; learning opportunities just because of their own prejudices against it.<br/>
&gt; To me, unschooling means using all of the tools at our disposal, to<br/>
&gt; shun one<br/>
&gt; tool means losing out on a host of opportunities that any other tool<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; offer.<br/>
&gt; All of those benefits to not owning one, that were listed above?<br/>
&gt; Can you believe that we have that AND a telly?<br/>
&gt; Hmmm....<br/>
&gt; The television is not evil. It&#39;s just a tool.<br/>
&gt; You can use it or not use it as you choose.....It doesn&#39;t take over<br/>
&gt; your life<br/>
&gt; unless you want it to.<br/>
&gt; Some of these responses make me wonder if people think television is<br/>
&gt; akin to<br/>
&gt; smoking and causes addiction.<br/>
&gt; Why would you think that tv owners are less likely to really listen to<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; spouses or listen to them 100%?<br/>
&gt; Do you think we all sit in front of the tv every time we have a<br/>
&gt; conversation?<br/>
&gt; I find that remark insulting, as though we tv owners can&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; effective<br/>
&gt; communication or healthy marriages!!! Sheesh.<br/>
&gt; And insulting Sandra was really lame after you asked for her opinion.<br/>

&gt; . &quot;I will experiment with candy and get back to you&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then it won&#39;t work.<br/>
&gt; You can&#39;t expect an experiment to reap the benefits we are talking<br/>
&gt; about.<br/>
&gt; Only total, long term trust will bring the results being discussed in<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; forum.<br/>
&gt; You will try the &quot;experiment&quot;, see the children gorging themselves sick<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; candy and junk most likely (because they haven&#39;t learned self control<br/>
&gt; yet)<br/>
&gt; and you will say &quot;this does NOT work, what is wrong with those people?&quot;<br/>
&gt; It only reaps the benefits when the trust and non-control are always<br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;It&#39;s ok with me at this point to let my children miss the learning<br/>
&gt; that is<br/>
&gt; available through television because of what I view as the negative<br/>
&gt; aspects<br/>
&gt; of it - to me this over-rides what is positive. Some of these negative<br/>
&gt; aspects are: lack of attention and less independant creative play (I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; seen<br/>
&gt; this repeatedly as a pre-school teacher) and the desire to be<br/>
&gt; entertained &quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What you&#39;re suggesting is that because there are unhealthy/negative<br/>
&gt; things on<br/>
&gt; television, you will shut down the positive aspects of it?<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s like burning down the library because there are books that are<br/>
&gt; negative.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;lack of attention and less independant creative play&quot;<br/>
&gt; ???<br/>
&gt; Really? Well, that is not true in my house.<br/>
&gt; My 8 y.o. ds loves spending time by himself. He is highly creative,<br/>
&gt; prefers<br/>
&gt; to daydream alone much of the time, putter in the woods or draw.<br/>
&gt; He has unlimited access to tv, food, books etc... and yet I see his<br/>
&gt; creativity abound.<br/>
&gt; He is very good at entertaining himself. All of my kids are. But I have<br/>
&gt; a 12<br/>
&gt; y.o. that is still obsessing with the tv because we didn&#39;t have one for<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; while.......<br/>
&gt; I suggest you are inferring things from a limited point of view.<br/>
&gt; Kids in school can&#39;t even be compared to unschoolers in that area.<br/>
&gt; Everything in their lives seems to be controlled, forced and limited.<br/>
&gt; Of course their creativity is stifled.<br/>
&gt; And independant play is not necessarily a good thing.<br/>
&gt; Some people need more person to person interaction, others are more<br/>
&gt; introverted.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think that independant play is a goal for unschoolers with<br/>
&gt; preschoolers.<br/>
&gt; Independance is overrated.<br/>
&gt; Interdependance is much healthier.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Also I tend to think that unschoolers here and homeschoolers generally<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; watch that much. &quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unschoolers here? Well that is going to vary a lot from person to<br/>
&gt; person.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve read of some that do watch a lot, I don&#39;t. But just because I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t mean I will dictate my childrens viewing any longer.<br/>
&gt; Homeschoolers in general probably villianize tv to a large degree.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s been my experience, because many homeschoolers still carry a lot<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; school ideas into their lives.<br/>
&gt; I suggest that we&#39;ve all been duped, and letting children choose is the<br/>
&gt; better way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515702271">&quot;I was wondering what ever happened<br/>
to the adverse behavior you were sure your oldest son had and would <br/>
have to<br/>
unrestricted tv? Was it something you just thought he was doing <br/>
because of your<br/>
feelings about it all or was it real and he just got over it or <br/>
what??? Just<br/>
wondering because you seemed so convincing of how he behaved and then <br/>
it just<br/>
seemed to be alright. Was it hard to transition for him or you?&quot;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Well......without all the in between posts it&#39;s hard to see the <br/>
transisition, but I was also less vocal during the transistion so it <br/>
needs some added information anyway.<br/>
I was quite sure I was right, so posting that I MIGHT be wrong didn&#39;t <br/>
happen. I just slowly quit saying &quot;No&quot; and quit trying to make my <br/>
kids feel bad for watching a lot.<br/>
I never said &quot;ok, all restrictions off&quot; or anything. I actually think <br/>
that can be a bad idea.<br/>
It depends.<br/>
Anyway, yes, the transition was a little hard. I dont&#39; like <br/>
electronic noise all the time, I find it invasive and draining. Like <br/>
many here, I prefer being outdoors a lot or at least have soothing <br/>
music playing part of the day, NOT tv and video games all the time.<br/>
So the transition was harder on me than them of course!<br/>
Most of the behavior &quot;problems&quot; were reactions to control.<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize it at the time, but it was true, because most all of <br/>
the behavior disappeared not long after lifting the restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor can still cop quite an attitude over video games sometimes, <br/>
get really crabby and not pleasant.<br/>
But Mary Gold brought up something last year that helped me see it <br/>
differently.<br/>
She mentioned that he may be getting the anger due to trying to solve <br/>
a puzzle he can&#39;t solve and that is frustrating him.<br/>
The video games have a lot of puzzles to solve sometimes...heck, I <br/>
get frustrated very quickly on them, so it made sense. I started <br/>
paying attention. I asked him about it and he said that only certain <br/>
games caused the frustration. And sure enough, it was the ones like <br/>
Zelda in which you have to solve a lot of puzzles to get where you <br/>
need to go.<br/>
So the frustration was causing the grumpy behavior and once we both <br/>
recognized it as that, he was more able to keep things in perspective.<br/>
I will suggest a break if I see him getting very intense.<br/>
Sometimes he&#39;ll just say that he&#39;s really close to solving the puzzle <br/>
and he needs to stay on it. OK.<br/>
So he proceeds to solve it and he&#39;s alright after that, he feels <br/>
really good that he was able to finish it.<br/>
Sometimes he gets so absorbed that he can&#39;t seem to get away from the <br/>
game, in spite of everyone else happily playing. But it just doesn&#39;t <br/>
stress me out the way it used to.<br/>
<br/>
I had a lot of burps and fits along the way...heck, I still get <br/>
frustrated once in a while and ask them to PLEASE turn that &quot;thing&quot; <br/>
off!!! They know it overwhelms me after a while, but they are just <br/>
starting to be a little more sensitive about it.<br/>
AFter all, I wasn&#39;t very sensitive to their needs/desires so it takes <br/>
a while to undo all of that.<br/>
<br/>
A warning to Julie and others that are trying to &quot;deprogram&quot;....<br/>
Don&#39;t expect anything quickly.<br/>
My kids are still VERY absorbed in their video games for long <br/>
stretches of time (maybe they always will be) but tv is no longer <br/>
that big of a deal.<br/>
They have certain shows they watch and they no longer sit and just <br/>
watch anything that&#39;s on just to be watching....though we went <br/>
through that too.<br/>
Don&#39;t just sit back and wait for them to self regulate. Watch WITH <br/>
them, offer other options, be part of their world. That made the <br/>
biggest difference in our lives.<br/>
For a while I just kept holding my breath, waiting for the novelty to <br/>
wear off. It did to some degree, but they were still watching SO much.<br/>
Finally, the advice here about getting into their interests clicked <br/>
with me.<br/>
Their interests included a LOT of tv and video games. I was not <br/>
entering into that particular interest!! How could I have been so <br/>
blind?<br/>
I started watching a lot of the Japanese anime with them, it was <br/>
actually really cool! I started looking stuff up on the internet and <br/>
forwarding it to Trevor.<br/>
Now we have some common ground. It changed everything. I am no longer <br/>
the &quot;enemy&quot; trying to keep them from what they want. I just never had <br/>
been able to bridge my unschooling philosophies over the certain <br/>
areas of our lives. But once I did (ok, I still say some stupid <br/>
things) it changed our entire family dynamics, changed our <br/>
interactions and the trust level.<br/>
<br/>
So when people say it just won&#39;t work for their families, of course I <br/>
am very stubborn. I KNOW it will  work if the parents want it to.<br/>
I KNOW it will lead to better relationships, more learning <br/>
opportunities and such.<br/>
If I know these things, it is my responsibility to share them with <br/>
you.<br/>
Just like other people here shared with me.<br/>
<br/>
A home where the parents are controlling ANY information or interests <br/>
is not as happy, bubbly and joyful as a home where that isn&#39;t <br/>
happening. I KNOW this.<br/>
And the learning isn&#39;t happening as fully, nor is the world being <br/>
explored as completely.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have learned SO much they would not have if I&#39;d stubbornly <br/>
clung to my  old views. Let&#39;s see, Alexander the Great was the latest <br/>
history we learned about, from an ANIMATED cartoon!!! Thank you very <br/>
much. :)<br/>
My 9.5 y.o. non-reading ds loves the game Phantasy Star Online (which <br/>
we just bought a couple days ago). I was amazed by how much reading  <br/>
you have to do to play the game, I was baffled at how he was getting <br/>
through it.<br/>
So I asked him how he could play without reading. It turns out he has <br/>
memorized literally HUNDREDS of little, teeny, tiny symbols!!<br/>
Can you imagine the brain power that takes? I thought it would be <br/>
easierr to memorize 26 symbols and their sounds, but apparently he <br/>
prefers memorizing the game symbols.<br/>
He&#39;s only asked me what something said three times.<br/>
And he&#39;s starting to look at the words and sound them out.<br/>
<br/>
Shutting off an avenue of exploration, shutting off an interest of my <br/>
childs is unacceptable to me these days.<br/>
And I&#39;m SO glad because they&#39;ve taught me a lot.</div>

When Marty was little, he used to play Treasure Mountain really well and <br/>
quickly and intently.  I had made him a 3x5 card with words and then a <br/>
picture of what the item or number looked like in the game, but he didn&#39;t <br/>
like to use it.  Instead of working math problems to get clues (word clues) <br/>
to figure out what number, shape and item he would advance by choosing, he <br/>
totally skipped the elves with their math and clues, and he just clicked.  <br/>
<br/>
You might think that was inefficient, but it wasn&#39;t.   He was just playing a <br/>
higher level math game than the rest of us (who followed direction) were <br/>
playing.<br/>
<br/>
We would run around catching elves in nets we had to buy by solving puzzles <br/>
and earning coins, then get a clue like &quot;two&quot; and another like &quot;square&quot; and <br/>
then &quot;trees.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile Marty has dashed on by the elves, clicked on three round pinecones, <br/>
gotten the indication that there is NO match, gone to two round trees: NEAR <br/>
match... etc.  <br/>
<br/>
He played it like Master Mind, making a guess, getting feedback, and making <br/>
another guess.  In his head, he was eliminating wrong guesses.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s way better pattern-thinking than telling an elf what 7+5 is.<br/>
He was faster at the game than we were too.  <br/>
<br/>
Nowhere on the box did it say the game taught deductive reasoning.  <br/>
Good think Marty couldn&#39;t read the box, then!<br/>

Grade, but it also has another name). His brothers want him to capture the <br/>
orange fish and answer the questions, or at least let them answer the <br/>
questions for him, but he just clicks until he finds what he needs and <br/>
deducts the rest from that. He knows it is easy to get more air and light.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh!  Marty was that way!   <br/>
I would pass by and say in a mom voice, &quot;Marty, do you want me to play a <br/>
while to earn you some nets?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t need nets, mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He played it totally without money, and said that if you play broke, the <br/>
elves leave money on the ground for you.  People with any money at all never <br/>
find money on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I didn&#39;t know, since I had &quot;played right.&quot;<br/>
