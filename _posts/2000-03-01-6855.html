<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713804045">we have been homeschooling since my 10yr old arrived at birth.  her sibs are <br/>
an almost 8yr sister, and two brothers almost 4 and 20mos.  we are expecting <br/>
our 5th child to arrive in july.  the way homeschooling has worked for us is <br/>
collaborative learning...  for eg. if i see that10yodd needs some more <br/>
&quot;substance,&quot; i encourage something and she either agrees or not, and we go <br/>
from there.  it has worked beautifully as she has not lost a love for <br/>
learning and is very self motivated, taking on self-created projects often.  <br/>
my question involves history.  i hated (who didnt?) the boring historical <br/>
facts presented in school and therefore remember little of what i parroted <br/>
back short term to do well.  dd reads voraciously and has read plenty of <br/>
historical fiction choices, which i assume she will continue to do.  i am not <br/>
sure about presentation of history.  this sonlight curriculum list offers <br/>
interesting options for a reading list.  and their idea seems to be that one <br/>
can learn history by: a) read the books, and b) plug them into a timeline.  i <br/>
am wondering about other ways that your children have acquired a knowledge of <br/>
history, besides randomly, which might work just as well!  especially parents <br/>
of older kids, do you end up having them &quot;do&quot; a course in highschool to <br/>
satisfy pre-college credit?<br/>
