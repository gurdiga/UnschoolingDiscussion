<div id="ygrps-yiv-152517215">My husband was not circumcised.<br/>
Tonight I was talking about the conversation on the topic on this list with<br/>
him.  I then asked him, &quot;did you feel weird and out of place growing up<br/>
because you were different?&quot; (he is 26 by the way, if anyone wanted to know,<br/>
grew up in Oregon)<br/>
He said, &quot;I didn&#39;t know I was any different growing up&quot;<br/>
I asked, &quot;but what about the locker rooms and stuff?&quot;<br/>
He said, &quot;why would I be looking at another guy&#39;s penis?&quot;<br/>
I asked, &quot;what about your dad?&quot;<br/>
He said, &quot;I haven&#39;t a clue if he&#39;s circumcised or not, I never noticed&quot;<br/>
I asked, &quot;well, what about when you got older and started looking at pornos<br/>
and stuff?&quot;<br/>
He answered, &quot;I still didn&#39;t know I was any different, I couldn&#39;t tell if<br/>
the guys were circumcised or not&quot;<br/>
Turns out he didn&#39;t know that a large percentage of guys his age are<br/>
circumcised, he found that very odd.  He didn&#39;t know until I had told him<br/>
when I was pregnant with our son.<br/>
He then said, &quot;You women are so weird sometimes, worrying about stuff as if<br/>
it actually matters.  Most of this stuff about guys caring how big they are<br/>
or what they look like I think just comes from what women think guys are<br/>
like.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He had one older brother, but he is 10 years older, and he doesn&#39;t know if<br/>
he is circumcised or not because he never noticed or asked.  His mother<br/>
never told him he was different, so he never thought he was different.  He<br/>
admits he may have noticed something when he was very young if he saw<br/>
someone else naked who was circumcised, but he doesn&#39;t remember that ever<br/>
happening so it must not have been a big deal if it did happen.<br/>
<br/>
Brightest Blessings!<br/>
