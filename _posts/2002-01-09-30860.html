That site is pretty disturbing! I was going to get the book but it&#39;s on the<br/>
high side :( Are you familiar with the Bush track record on education in Tx?<br/>
(TAAS). Here&#39;s a link if you&#39;re interested... old but good information<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-161059928">+ That site is pretty disturbing! I was going to get the book but<br/>
+ it&#39;s on the high side<br/>
<br/>
I thought Gatto&#39;s book on the subject was high, too, but I&#39;m really glad I<br/>
bought it.  I haven&#39;t finished it, though, so don&#39;t plan on getting this one<br/>
yet.  His writing style is difficult for me to get through (and even his<br/>
speaking style is hard for me to follow), but I&#39;m determined to get through<br/>
it eventually.  I had to make an unexpected trip out of town this weekend<br/>
and grabbed 3 conference tapes I had of Gatto (conference was in Tacoma,<br/>
WA).  I had *no* other distractions, so was able to follow OK.  His speech<br/>
patterns are &quot;different&quot;....not exactly monotone, but his tone doesn&#39;t go up<br/>
and down in the appropriate times or something.  At least not what I&#39;m used<br/>
to in the midwest...  I&#39;ve seen him speak on 3 occasions (at least one of<br/>
them was a 4-day conference where he spoke several times) and he *READS* his<br/>
speeches; doesn&#39;t give them off the top of his head.  I think that&#39;s the<br/>
problem.  One session I went to of his he asked not to be taped and in this<br/>
session he was interesting to listen to....it *was* off the top of his head<br/>
and he told lots of stories--he&#39;s at his best when he tells stories; when he<br/>
gets &quot;sidetracked&quot; from what he wants to say.  :-)<br/>

I just opened that page up and will read through it this afternoon--thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-694220677">I had a history teacher in college that did that and I had to drop the<br/>
class.  The first tape of Gatto&#39;s I *tried* to listen to immediately put me<br/>
to sleep (seriously!) and I was just glad I hadn&#39;t been listening to it in<br/>
the car &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t bought the books either because they are REALLY pricey!  maybe we<br/>
should all start a book go round and collectively buy some of these books or<br/>
start a lending library of sorts.  Then we could read all these books and we<br/>
all wouldn&#39;t have to go out and rob a bank!<br/>
