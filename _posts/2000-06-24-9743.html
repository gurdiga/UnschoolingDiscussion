<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962308240">We screen all calls, mainly because we have teenagers and the girls were<br/>
driving us crazy.  Bought eldest kidlet a beeper and told him he could call<br/>
them but they had to beep him.  Hubby also put a message on the machine<br/>
that made them pause and quite a few stopped called, &quot;Hello . . . . . . . .<br/>
HELLO . . . . . . . . . . Fine, if you don&#39;t want to talk to me then talk<br/>
to the machine&quot; and then he goes on to tell them that he is *1 and his<br/>
better half is *2 and the tax deductions are *3.  Only folks we know manage<br/>
to get far enough to send a message to the correct number.  Solicitors<br/>
rarely get past the second hello.  It is really a hoot when they start<br/>
talking to the hello&#39;s and the later part of their conversation is the part<br/>
recorded as they talk to another telemarketer in the same room, &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
know, the guy said hello but he&#39;s not answering me.&quot;<br/>
