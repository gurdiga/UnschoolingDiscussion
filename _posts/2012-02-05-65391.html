<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815522789">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for ideas to through a cool party for my 8 year old boy<br/>
and his 11 year old friend.<br/>
<br/>
I feel they would love to g for a laserquest, but we don&#39;t really have<br/>
a budget to invite all their friends to a laserquest. Any idea how we<br/>
could organise something fun for a limited budget?<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking maybe we can try and find a network playroom for a mini<br/>
counter strike tournament...<br/>
<br/>
There should be about 6 to 8 boys and ideally we want something fun to<br/>
do for the little sisters...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very cold here theses days, so outdoors doesn&#39;t sound like a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
Possibly a Treasure hunt, but I am worried some older kids might thing<br/>
it&#39;s too childish...<br/>
<br/>
They like video games, first person shooters, some strategic games...<br/>
<br/>
Ideas anyone? What kind of parties have you thrown for your preteen boys?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Claire</div>

 </span></blockquote>Try not to think that way. My experience has been that older kids actually<br/>
LOVED the excuse to do &quot;younger kid&quot; activities.<br/>
<br/>
We took Rosie and her friends to a little-kiddie amusement park for several<br/>
of her birthdays...she and her friends were eventually significantly older<br/>
than the intended age for the park (8 to 11ish at a place intended more for<br/>
2 to 5ish) , but all the rides were built so that parents and little kids<br/>
could both ride, when meant that our big kids fit the rides just fine. They<br/>
loved it and had a really good time.<br/>
<br/>
One of the people running the place told me, as we were leaving, &quot;I was so<br/>
worried when I saw all those big kids because I thought they&#39;d be bored and<br/>
not behave well, but your kids were delightful and so full of happy energy<br/>
and imagination, it was a pleasure to watch them having such a good time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These were all unschooled kids. If you are inviting kids who might act like<br/>
they are too old and not be cool with young-kid activities, your mileage<br/>
may vary.<br/>

You can make it a bit harder by writing clues / enigmas...<br/>
We used to play it all around the village (I know it is cold, maybe you could do it outside for a while and come back inside ?)<br/>
Using rebus (mmm... not sure of the english word !), enigmas, and maybe a neighbour who could give clues ?<br/>
The little ones can have a role in the game, being part of a team...<br/>
<br/>
Have fun !!<br/>
