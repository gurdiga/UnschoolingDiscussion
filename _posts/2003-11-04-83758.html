<div id="ygrps-yiv-165021212">I&#39;ve never liked TV news.  I watch occasionally late at night and am always<br/>
dissapointed in the &quot;journalism&quot;.  Dh and I have always been newspaper<br/>
readers, NPR fans and now, we often google a news subject that catches our<br/>
attention.<br/>
<br/>
My kids haven&#39;t seen much news, they typically ask to change the channel or<br/>
turn it off if it comes on.  Once my dd then 7yo saw some coverage of a<br/>
kidnapping while she was sleeping over atr afriends house.  She had<br/>
nightmares and wouldn&#39;t go into her bedroom alone for weeks.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>
believe my friend let them watch it.  When I asked what she was thinking she<br/>
said &quot;oh it was just on.&quot; I was so mad.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I stopped watching most TV news when my first child was a toddler, because<br/>
&gt;I didn&#39;t want her to be exposed to it.  Although she now (age 10) has free<br/>
&gt;reign of the remote control, she doesn&#39;t choose to watch the news.<br/>
