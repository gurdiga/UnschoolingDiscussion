<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485135954">Instead of the word &quot;sacrifice&quot;, what if we used the word &quot;compromise&quot;, when it comes to parenting? Like many parents I try to negotiate outcomes with my children and that usually means give and take from all parties. This way I avoid feeling that I have sacrificed myself in any way. <br/>
<br/>
wishing you peace and prosperity, <br/>
