My job is to point, admire, offer, support, listen, encourage, hug, <br/>
understand, laugh, embrace, shore up, help and learn alongside.<br/>

I&#39;m less concerned with how they should be. I&#39;m more interested in who <br/>
they really are. (That means I am less worried about preventing them <br/>
from becoming a danger to themselves or having wrong ideas or thoughts <br/>
or attitudes and more interested in what they actually think, believe, <br/>
infer, do or judge right now.)&quot;<br/>

I thought this was great Julie. Nice description of mindful parenting vs. traditional. I totally agree, and remember the days when I felt I had to &quot;get&quot; them to be, do, say etc....what a load of stress that we&#39;re all happier for having left behind.<br/>
