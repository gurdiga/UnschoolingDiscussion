Her bio-mom assaulted me last Monday evening-in front of Brianna. It sure opened our eyes.  Brianna & I figure that it we&#39;re going to relocate, we may as well go to where we truly feel safe. I don&#39;t know if the USA qualifies anymore.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857687416">Thanks,<br/>

I wanted to have her charged - but my son (who obviously forgets what a nightmare she is) and my 91 y.o. aunt ( who feels that no matter what - you never, ever have family arrested) The deciding factor is that this would have been with the Providence Police. They aren&#39;t exactly, well, when Channa (my daughter & Brianna&#39;s bio-mom) was taking almost everything out of my home, they simply didn&#39;t believe that I would testify against her - so no reports were made. She was &quot;confused&quot;. Then when she took up with a black man - they washed their hands of her - she was &quot;too far gone - forget her&quot;<br/>
When Brianna & I lived in Providence, we were robbed approximately 60 times one year. She took the rugs off my floors. Brianna&#39;s earliest memory (of her bio-mom) is her bio-mom taking her snowsuit off her - in the night and giving the snowsuit and her Ernie doll to a women.<br/>
I feel so sad when parents start dealing w/ drugs and they feel &quot;I have to really love this kid, I have to shelter this kid, I have to hold this kid.&quot; Really, all you can do is tuff love - cause believe me, love doesn&#39;t cure addiction....the whole entire family will go. You have no idea how many friends I lost because she robbed them. You have no idea how many family members simply put us aside - this has been going on for 16 years - after she robbed a few aunts - we stopped being invited or even updated about family things.<br/>
It&#39;s been hard - but Brianna & I are fine now.<br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t mean to go on so long.....<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay if we can&#39;t emigrate there. We&#39;ll visit Canada and have a wonderful time!<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, I seldom get disappointed in things like this.<br/>
I&#39;ll just keep on keepin&#39; on!<br/>
