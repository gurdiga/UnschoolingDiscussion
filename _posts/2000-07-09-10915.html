Hi Michelle:<br/>
<br/>
I do have this every now and again about my husband... I met my husband in <br/>
England while I was on vacation (a British person, now American on vacation <br/>
in England)!!  I went there to be with my best friend.  I&#39;d been there the <br/>
year before to be in her wedding.  5 months after she was married Jeremy (her <br/>
husband) was killed in an accident.  As I wasn&#39;t married at the time and <br/>
didn&#39;t have any kids I quit my job, gave up my apartment, stored all my <br/>
belongings and took off to England for 3 months to be with her.  3 weeks <br/>
after I was there I met Steve (now hubbie) at an airforce base my mother met <br/>
my step-father at 19 years before.  Steve and I married 4 months after we met <br/>
and from the moment we met until it was exactly 5 months to the day that Roz <br/>
would have been married to Jeremy I was petrified that Steve would die.  On <br/>
the day that was exactly from the time Roz and Jeremy were married to the <br/>
time of his death Steve was going to another base for the day.  It was <br/>
pouring with rain (usual for England) and I was so scared that he was going <br/>
to be killed on that day in an accident that I begged him not to go.  I got <br/>
physically sick and ended up taking the day off work and spend it with Steve. <br/>
 I still have those feelings quite a lot, probably because of my experience <br/>
with Roz and her husband.  I wonder if they ever go away when you are married <br/>
to the love of your life.<br/>
<br/>
Zak has asked a few questions about death... usually related to dead birds in <br/>
the garden as he doesn&#39;t know of a person that&#39;s died yet.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105956852">I do get scared if I don&#39;t hear from Rob, he travels a lot some <br/>
days, he can be out from 9am and not be home &#39;til 10pm, but I| <br/>
don&#39;t make a point of letting him know, except to have a cuddle <br/>
when he gets home.  When we got together, we had a very bad <br/>
experience that made him nervous if he didn&#39;t know exactly <br/>
where I was, and it got quite claustrophobic in a way, though I did <br/>
realise that it was out of love.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I could never bring myself to promise my child that he would be a man before <br/>
I die...you never know.  I&#39;m concerned that he would then feel I had lied to <br/>
him and betrayed his trust.  It may be a little thing...but, I tell them I <br/>
don&#39;t expect to die soon, that I will probably be old and he will have <br/>
children before that happens.  But, ultimately, it&#39;s not in my hands.<br/>
<br/>
I admit I may be a bit more sensitive to the subject.  I held the mother of a <br/>
young child as she (the mother) passed away from cancer.  I know it can <br/>
happen.  For that matter, that means my child knows it can happen also (the <br/>
child was his best friend).<br/>
<br/>
I really like the additional thoughts of always watching over him, even if he <br/>
can&#39;t see me!  I really believe we are given that opportunity after our death.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not to criticize your response, but it reminded me of something.<br/>
<br/>
My best friends sister died suddenly of a brain anurism recently. She was <br/>
44, got out of bed on a Sunday morning and fell over dead. Her kids were at <br/>
thier Dads for the weekend, and my friend had to go tell them that Cindy was <br/>
gone. One of the boys screamed out &quot;but she said she would never leave me&quot;. <br/>
We figure she must have said that during the divorce. It makes me cry all <br/>
over again to think of it.<br/>
