question is ignored, everyone assumes some more knowledgeble person will be<br/>
along to answer it.<br/>

You might try the message boards at Unschooling.com in the Across the<br/>
Continent folder.<br/>
<br/>
You can also try the National Home Education Network (http://www.nhen.org)<br/>
website. They have listings of state and local support groups. Hopefully<br/>
your state group has a webpage or email list.<br/>
