I would too. However, I hope you think it would be much better if it didn&#39;t<br/>
become illegal. You seem to send the message that it would be no big deal<br/>
either way. When you say &quot;anyway,&quot; you&#39;re saying you are willing to break<br/>
the law. I&#39;ll ride in the sheriff&#39;s car with you, gladly.<br/>

Some of my recent posts have had the purpose of telling homeschoolers that<br/>
if we are not vigilant, and willing to guard/keep our rights, then they will<br/>
be taken away. That would be a terrible thing, and not just for<br/>
homeschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
About 25 years ago, homeschooling was illegal in several states. There were<br/>
sheriffs at many homeschoolers&#39; doors demanding that children be sent to the<br/>
local public schools, and many children were actually forcibly taken away<br/>
from their homes and put in foster homes for various terms, and parents were<br/>
&quot;detained&quot; too. Many homeschoolers lived in fear of the pedagogical police.<br/>
<br/>
Things have changed on the surface, but we&#39;re far from safe. A legislator in<br/>
CT has told her constituents (including homeschoolers to their faces) that<br/>
she intends to do everything she can to eliminate parents rights to educate<br/>
their kids. I&#39;m sure that there are many like her in the land.<br/>
<br/>
Kids are hard to hide.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
<br/>

anyway.&quot; I mean if homeschooling were illegal, I would do it anyway. Not that <br/>
it would be no big deal, just that I believe in what I do and would do it <br/>
anyway, or inspite of, not I&#39;ll ride in the sheriff&#39;s car, gladly. Not <br/>
gladly, anyway. Don&#39;t put words in my mouth. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have an uncle who has this mentality. He has guns, lots of guns. He enjoys <br/>
hunting, which I think is fine. The problem with his guns isn&#39;t his guns, the <br/>
problem is he is always spouting off about how if he isn&#39;t vigilant, *they* <br/>
are going to take away his rights. He has a real problem with these people he <br/>
refers to as *they* and *them* He has to watch out for them, they are going <br/>
to take his rights away. His favorite saying is &quot;*They* can have my gun when <br/>
*they* pry it from my cold, dead hand!&quot; If my uncle wasn&#39;t so gung ho about <br/>
his rights, and always shouting about the ever-present *they* and *them* <br/>
taking away his rights, then the *they* and *them* probably wouldn&#39;t care so <br/>
much about him. What he doesn&#39;t realize is that *they-them* aren&#39;t after his <br/>
hunting rifle locked in his safe. For every action there is a reaction. My <br/>
uncle is part of that equation, he doesn&#39;t have to be. <br/>
I think that keeping an eye on the law is a good thing. What I don&#39;t think is <br/>
a good thing is getting on my horse and riding around proclaiming that my <br/>
homeschooling rights are about to be violated. There is an old saying. Don&#39;t <br/>
rock the boat. I have it good here, I am thankful. I wish it were the same <br/>
for all, but I know it isn&#39;t. (I am sure some in states that don&#39;t have it as <br/>
easy as I do might think that I am being selfish. And maybe I am.) I am not <br/>
willing to run around screaming about something that *might* happen, calling <br/>
attention to what I do legally, just asking for some hot head to hear me and <br/>
say that they DON&#39;T like what I do, and make it harder or even illegal for me <br/>
to do what I do. I am thankful for those who have gone before me on this <br/>
road. I am grateful for the battles they fought and won. They made it <br/>
possible for me to enjoy the freedom I have to raise my kids the way I feel <br/>
is best. I am not going to stand up and shout about a system they helped <br/>
create, risking loosing what I do have. Is that wrong? Maybe. Is it an <br/>
ungrateful attitude toward those who went before me? No. So when I say if <br/>
homeschooling were to become illegal, I would do it anyway. I guess I mean <br/>
that, like those who did this before me, I would do it anyway, but thanks to <br/>
them, I don&#39;t need to draw attention to myself, and in deference to them, I <br/>
won&#39;t. <br/>
