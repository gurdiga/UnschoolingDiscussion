<div id="ygrps-yiv-539476757">I just joined this group and I guess I&#39;m still &quot;nervous&quot;, for lack of <br/>
a better word, about my son and his homeschooling (he wants <br/>
unschooling).  We just started homeschooling again after giving the <br/>
public high school &quot;another chance&quot; after Christmas this year.  What a <br/>
disaster.<br/>
 <br/>
He is a *very* smart boy - if he wants to learn it, he&#39;ll do it.  The <br/>
problem is those things he doesn&#39;t &quot;want&quot; to learn (Algebra, World <br/>
History, etc).  Computers and guitar - he&#39;s all for it!  I guess I <br/>
worry that he won&#39;t be able to pass the state-mandated yearly tests he <br/>
has to take if he doesn&#39;t have *some* kind of formal education at <br/>
home.  Of course, I gave him a practice PSAT and he passed with flying <br/>
colors.  Maybe *I* am the one who needs &quot;deschooling&quot;.  ; )  <br/>
 <br/>
Another concern - he is utterly fascinated with pyrotechnics, <br/>
explosives, etc..  And of course, thinks he&#39;s invincible.  Has anyone <br/>
dealt with this with teenage boys (or girls)??  How do you get them <br/>
over this &quot;phase&quot;!?!?  Lately he wants to mix different things <br/>
together to &quot;see what it&#39;ll do&quot;.  I can hear some of you now &quot;Oooo, <br/>
chemisty!!!&quot; - which is fine WHEN I&#39;M THERE!  The problem is - I work <br/>
full time and he&#39;s home alone during the day quite a bit.  The other <br/>
day at Walmart he asked for Liquid Plumber for pete&#39;s sake!  : /<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m thinking a nice field trip to a burn unit at the hospital would do <br/>
the trick.  Any advice?  Also, any advice about the testing and <br/>
unschooling would be great.  Thanks!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-763825741">About the testing, what state are you in and how high do the scores <br/>
have to be?  Here in Ohio, they have to score in the twenty fifth <br/>
percentile, which I believe you could do by answering C for every <br/>
question.  In some states you have to score in the thirteenth <br/>
percentile.  Really.  Look up your local district on one of those <br/>
websites that compares schools to each other (anyone have a link?).  <br/>
Our district is not the best and our local school has absolutely <br/>
pathetic scores.  You might be shocked by the test scores at your <br/>
local school.  <br/>
<br/>
The thing about standardized tests is that it&#39;s not a matter of how <br/>
many correct answers you get, it&#39;s a matter of how many correct <br/>
answers the average kid gets and how you score comparatively.  The <br/>
average public schooled kid is bored, stressed-out, and resentful.  <br/>
It&#39;s not hard for a self-motivated child who loves learning to score <br/>
better than that.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, my brother went through that.  And he didn&#39;t get out of the <br/>
phase, he joined the Marines.  &lt;g&gt;  My mom let him have fireworks, <br/>
but only in the driveway, not the lawn or his bedroom.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
let a child randomly mix household cleaners with anything -- the <br/>
results could be way too ugly.  I&#39;d buy him a book of chemistry <br/>
experiments and let him do them in a safe environment (basement?  <br/>
kitchen?  garage that doesn&#39;t have a car parked in it?).  Even <br/>
scientists don&#39;t randomly pour liquids together and hope to survive.  <br/>
And maybe it would help your peace of mind to purchase a fire <br/>
extinguisher.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-690565520">i have a boy 13 thats likes to play with fire and knives,,yes scarey to me but fun to him,,lol,,i have gave him my opion and the safety of these things and let him be,,he got burned,,not bad playing with a lighter when it blow up on him and he has not picked up one since,,thank god,,and the knives well he collects them same with his other brothers do,,but i have not saw them put them self or others in danger with them when they go to show off their collection so i think its they have respect for them and that makes me feel better.i no i am not much help but all i can advise is to them him your opion on the danger side of things and hope he understands to have respect for things that can hurt him,,but t6o make him stop well i just do not see that it can be done with force,its a choice he will have to make  or not make in his own time,,he may tell you has and being hiding it from you but he has to be the one to stop.i know its scarey to hold your breath and hope for the best some times,,i do it all the time with my boys also,,good luck...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-333476097">My dh doesnt know a darn thing about world history or algebra (except politics and things that really peek his interest) he spent most of his days locked away in his bedroom learning the guitar by himself. He know supports our entire family with this gift by teaching and playing publically. He is a great example of unschooling success:) Kelli<br/>
