<div id="ygrps-yiv-46523857">Ok, here&#39;s one for you all:<br/>
<br/>
Am I doing my children a disservice by not getting them &quot;school&quot; desks? <br/>
I&#39;ve been pondering this issue for a couple of years now.  My girls are<br/>
little (almost 6 and almost 2), so using the kitchen table for a lot of<br/>
things is not very ergonomic for them.  We sit at a low &quot;coffee&quot; table a<br/>
lot, but things can&#39;t easily stay out there for too long.  I&#39;ve looked<br/>
at lots of different desks and they seem like they have the potential of<br/>
being nice places to do things (arts/crafts, computer games on the<br/>
laptop, etc.).  Should I get a really good quality easel instead?<br/>
<br/>
What do you all use for little ones?  How about big ones?  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428239815">Ok, I&#39;m a newbie to unschooling, so I may not have the best advice.<br/>
<br/>
When we were electic hs, we had desks.  But they were never used. <br/>
Kids felt too confined.  Like they had to sit there.  So I put them <br/>
in a garage sale.<br/>
<br/>
What I find that works, but def. doesn&#39;t fit the Better Homes and <br/>
Gardens pictorial layout----- is a card table, permanently set up.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever we don&#39;t want to have to move we start there.  Other <br/>
activities that can be moved are done on the kitchen table.<br/>
<br/>
Right now ours holds: a barely started puzzle, a lamp, a microscope, <br/>
some leftover candy wrappers, a lego machine built by ds, and a towel.<br/>
<br/>
Why a towel?  To keep our puzzle covered at night b/c our cat likes <br/>
to bat around the pieces of puzzles unless it&#39;s covered up.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea is:  picnic table.  We playdoh, do messes outside on it, <br/>
weather permitting.<br/>
<br/>
Just some suggestions<br/>

Hang a roll of paper over the door to they&#39;re room (Like paper towel style)<br/>
pulling it down so they cvan draw or paint.<br/>
Desks are yucky unless you have a room so large they can face the center of<br/>
the room. I hate facing the wall myself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have inlaws who spoil my children rotten...so even though my oldest is stil <br/>
only 2 I can answer what has worked for our family very well.  <br/>
<br/>
We have a toddler size table (made out of wood to be attractive.)  Andrew can <br/>
do whatever activity he wants there, play with puzzles, draw, eat, play with <br/>
trains (the all time favorite at the moment) and so on.  However, the one we <br/>
bought came with stools which ended up not being very sturdy so I&#39;m going to <br/>
get some regular chairs.  He also has an inexpensive easel that he uses when <br/>
he wants to paint.<br/>
<br/>
My next purchase, hopefully from a yardsale, will be a four legged wooden <br/>
table that I can cut the legs off of and make to their height...that will be <br/>
larger than what we have now...<br/>
<br/>
And I just realized that I haven&#39;t posted an intro to this group and why I <br/>
joined now when I have a 28 month old and a 9 month old...so I will do that <br/>
next.<br/>

your child likes drawing with chalk...it can be done in any color...we are <br/>
going to have the boys share a room in our new house so they can have a <br/>
&quot;playroom&quot; and we are going to paint the bottom half of 2 walls with the <br/>
chalk board paint so they can draw to their hearts content.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-191737524">My 7 yo dd begged for a school desk for a long time. I found several in the $10-$20 range. We finally came across one for free. It has an attached desk with a place under the chair for books. She loves playing &quot;school&quot; with the desk, but it is really just a game. The town I live in has an Ugly Chair Auction to raise money for the arts. Dd has decided she would like to decorate the chair and donate it to the auction in the spring.  She has figured out that she doesn&#39;t need a desk in order to learn. I am glad I got her the desk so that she could come to that conclusion herself. I am also glad I did not go out and purchase an expensive desk because I am sure she would have come to the same conclusion not matter what the price.  <br/>

paint so that magnets will stick to whatever surface you paint with<br/>
it. It used to be sold by magneticpoetry.com, but now can be found at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fridgedoor.com/magneticpaint.html">http://www.fridgedoor.com/magneticpaint.html</a><br/>
<br/>
The site describes it as &quot;a child-safe, acrylic latex water-based<br/>
light gray primer that turns any porous interior surface into a<br/>
magnetic receptive surface.&quot; You could make their walls not only a<br/>
chalkboard, but also able to hold magnets! I&#39;m getting such great<br/>
ideas for the next time we paint . . . :)  <br/>
