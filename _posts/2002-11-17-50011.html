<div id="ygrps-yiv-51560365">for the reply. You are right on the $$ as to helping the kids if,or  <br/>
when asked.<br/>
That&#39;s pretty much what I&#39;ve been doing lately,(really, all of their <br/>
lives) just couldn&#39;t see past everyones opinions, and definitions. <br/>
What&#39;s clicked for me is this, learning is all the time, not to be <br/>
put on some sort of a &quot;school&quot; calendar. <br/>
Guess I&#39;ve always known it to be true, just took me a while.<br/>
Gee, a light bulb moment indeed!!! LOL<br/>

I love when that happens!!<br/>
I like seeing the light come on in my kids, and in ME!<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re surely welcome for any time I contributed raw materials for you to use <br/>
to get one of those moments yourself!<br/>
