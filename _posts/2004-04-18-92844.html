<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200505614">After seeing Mary B&#39;s post, it did occur to me the quote at issue is <br/>
similar to what James Dean (I think) once was quoted as saying:<br/>
<br/>
       &quot;Live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse.&quot;<br/>

============<br/>
<br/>
There was a rock-a-billy song in the late 50&#39;s (I think) and the lyrics of <br/>
the chorus were <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m gonna live fast, love free, die young<br/>
And leave a beautiful memory.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(I think those are the words.)<br/>
