<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359738714">Good morning all. After nearly a year of love, sweat and fear, I finally took the ultimate leap of faith yesterday by pulling my son from public school. He was a fifth grader at one of our local schools. I have been lurking on this list, among others, for over a year, absorbing inspiration, hope and knowledge while riding out a very tumultuous year. Whilst we continue to heal from the ravages of years of domestic violence, followed by the loss of my job due to the current economy, to being bound to the social contracts of life (eg a rental lease)I have been struggling to create a peaceful and joyful life ~ a new beginning for my son and I ~ that an unschooling lifestyle appears to provide. Amid the past several years of conflict, I have witnessed a steady developmental process in the way my son views his world and absorbs wisdom and knowledge. He &quot;gets&quot; it the first time, thus preferring not to replicate, duplicate, practice, practice, practice as the &quot;teachers&quot; have demanded. He is not perfect, none of us are, his math skills are minimal, but his reading and processing skills are above and beyond, &quot;advanced&quot; as the IEP testing revealed and what I already knew. So, without further rambling, I welcome the change. I give thanks and praise to all of your voices and look forward to exchanges as Eli and I navigate our way towards peaceful attached parenting filling our hearts with joy long overdue!</div>

<br/>
It&#39;s hard to unthink something or to unknow, but if you can let these  <br/>
things float back down into the background and not think about them,  <br/>
it will give unschooling more room to flow into:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;his math skills are minimal, but his reading and processing skills  <br/>
are above and beyond, &quot;advanced&quot; as the IEP testing revealed and what  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s just one person now, no assembly line, no comparisons.   Let the  <br/>
school stuff go as soon and as well as you can.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511368083">You have a great attitude, Marcie, for unschooling!! Be sure to allow <br/>
for deschooling to take place - reading more about deschooling, focusing <br/>
on that, will be useful for you right now, most likely. And - have FUN. <br/>
Remember - this IS life, not preparation for life.<br/>
