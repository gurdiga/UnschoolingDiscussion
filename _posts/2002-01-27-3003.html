<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311196370">WOW Tia... I can&#39;t believe that conversation is still going on over there<br/>
(LOL).... I&#39;m glad I signed off that list several months ago.  Then at my<br/>
homeschooling meeting one day I was told about this list and happily have<br/>
joined.<br/>

I&#39;ve got no problem with that. I just have a problem with calling it<br/>
<br/>
unschooling. &lt;G&gt; And *that&#39;s* what they don&#39;t seem to get. No one is<br/>
<br/>
saying they shouldn&#39;t do what&#39;s best for their family, even if it isn&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
really unschooling. We&#39;re just trying to get across that it isn&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
unschooling just because you want to call it that. (my thoughts exactly<br/>
