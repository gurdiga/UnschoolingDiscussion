&gt;I wonder how many issues are brought to the unschooling list by<br/>
&gt;parents thinking it&#39;s a problem with their child when it&#39;s really a<br/>
&gt;problem of their own?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am paranoid about fatness as it is a killer and also for other<br/>
&gt;reasons I&#39;ll list below. It is guaranteed to shorten life,<br/>
&gt;especially in our family. I also have personal hangups about fatness<br/>
&gt;which I think are clouding this issue. This issue has given me the<br/>
&gt;chance to think about it all more deeply.<br/>

one of the books and this part is interesting:<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
I recently read Glenn Gaesser’s book, Big Fat Lies - The Truth about Your <br/>
Weight and Your Health. I love the humor incorporated into the book. Here’s a <br/>
couple of examples:<br/>
 J Dr. Gaesser documents more than 20 studies over the last 20 years that <br/>
show weight loss (either intentional or unintentional) actually increases the <br/>
risk of premature death. Of the few studies finding longer life with weight loss, <br/>
one documents an 11-hour increase in longevity per pound of weight lost. <br/>
Gaesser observes that results from this study suggest a person would have to lose <br/>
796 pounds to gain an additional year of life.-=-<br/>
