<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615787627">Howdy again Kelly!:)<br/>
You roused up a rabble lover, so now here I am checking into <br/>
unschoolingdiscussion again and find an interesting thread.<br/>
<br/>
And interestingly enough, this was also being discussed over at <br/>
unschooling.com this week (see, I&#39;m not really missing anything)<br/>
<br/>
&quot; that Judas wasn&#39;t really hanged (seeing<br/>
him<br/>
step back on the bus was reassuring &lt;g&gt;),&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You could tell him that it&#39;s questionable as to whether the <br/>
historical Judas was hanged also!  The gospels have two different <br/>
versions (one has him being hanged and the money being thrown down in <br/>
the temple, the other has him burying the money and his bowels <br/>
gushing out) another connection that might interest him.<br/>

<br/>
yeah, yeah----we got into that too. Also the &quot;Mary issue&quot;. Simon Zealot and <br/>
what zealots are/were (I&#39;m an unschooling zealot, he said! &lt;g&gt;). Pilate vs <br/>
Herod vs Ciaphas and the priests. The combining of old & new (the setting & <br/>
costumes)----and Ben & I watched Anthony Hopkins in Titus last night----same deal, <br/>
old w/ new. What betrayal is and how Judas must have felt. What a messiah is. <br/>
How long ago 2000 years is (hard to fathom when you&#39;re only eight! &lt;g&gt;). Who <br/>
Buddha was----and that Lisa Simpson is buddhist! Tons of other things!<br/>
