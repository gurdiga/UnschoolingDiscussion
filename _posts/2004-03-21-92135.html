<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>21 Mar 2004, at  1:09pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-826444121">I just have to write and say how proud I am of myself!!!!  And I am having a GRAND time of it too!<br/>
<br/>
I am remodeling my daughter&#39;s bedroom for her birthday this week.  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve got to understand where I started.  My dh has all the construction skills...but I have picked up a few along the way &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
We started with paneling and cheap drywall that had holes in it.  (Part of our house is a 30 year old mobile home).  <br/>
<br/>
WELL, over the years I&#39;ve gotten little tidbits of information about what I could do.  My husband helped me hang lawan (Sp?) plywood over the walls that needed fixed.  Then I primed everything and hung wallpaper liner (what GREAT STUFF!!!).  I just finished priming the liner today, and priming the ceiling.  <br/>
<br/>
I spackled some trouble spots, and have to go back and get some air bubbles out (which has an easy fix I didn&#39;t know about!!).  <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully tomorrow, we can start painting the colored paint on.  She wants dark blue with baby blue sponge painted, and stars/moons on the ceiling in glow in the dark paint.  Then we&#39;ll finish it off with moulding and trim.<br/>
<br/>
This is going to be SOOOOO cool!!!!  And all for less than $200.  We have to get a new carpet for her room, so that will be more, but I&#39;m hoping to find a remnant.<br/>
<br/>
This is the first total project I&#39;ve done by myself, and I am soooooo pleased!  <br/>
I just had to share!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681587057">I kind of thought that was the case.  We have had the stickons and they do a really nice job...except they pull some of the ceiling material off when we take them down.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll see what my daughter says.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just started painting the walls.  We bought 5 qts of paint before we finally settled on the right one!<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t want to sponge paint the walls anymore, but I think I&#39;d like to sponge paint *glaze* over the solid blue wall.  Has anyone done that?  How does it look?<br/>

My daughter did her room like this a couple years ago.  We did the glow in <br/>
the dark paint, which work somewhat.  What really set the ceiling apart was <br/>
taking &quot;net&quot; lighting, white twinkle lights that you put on shrubbery at Christmas <br/>
time and stapled them to the ceiling.  They are flat and then she used sheer <br/>
curtain panels stapled to be billowy and it looks really nice.  <br/>
<br/>
She ended up painting yellow stars on the walls then putting the glow in the <br/>
dark paint on top of the yellow.  They glowed for a while but I think you <br/>
could probably reactivate them with a flashlight or a lamp held closely for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
The dark paint did take a LOT of paint, she has a small room and I think we <br/>
used more than two gallons to get it nice and dark. Hers is like a night sky <br/>
dark purplish.<br/>
