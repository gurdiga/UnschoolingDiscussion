<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152836564">I LOVE it!  I think I&#39;ll buy a copy of it with some of my birthday money!  A special treat for Mom, but really...for ALL of us! <br/>
   <br/>
  When my family started on this radical unschooling journey some time ago, one of the first things I read was an article on saying YES, or some form of yes.  I&#39;m not sure now who wrote it...I *am* pretty sure I read it on Sandra&#39;s site.  Anyway, it *really* stuck with me.  I kinda turned it into my own little mantra...<br/>
   <br/>
  So, thanks for sending it Mary Ellen!<br/>
