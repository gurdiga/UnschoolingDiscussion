<br/>
I wasn&#39;t aware of the situation in the States (having never visited), so I<br/>
do apologise.<br/>
<br/>
I always wear shoes when I go out- I don&#39;t think our insurance comapny<br/>
will pay out if you have an accident while driving without shoes (or in<br/>
jandals, for that matter).  I simply don&#39;t require it of my children.<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, there are some shops where it wouldn&#39;t be approriate to be<br/>
bare-foot- but I have found that if I say where we are going, Josh<br/>
instinctively realises it will be a place he should wear shoes.  I don&#39;t<br/>
have to make a scene about it.  There are natural boundaries around, I<br/>
just try not to create new ones for my children to follow.<br/>

 Honestly...what is the issue with not wearing shoes?<br/>
<br/>
In the United States, there are signs on many many stores that say, &quot;No<br/>
Shirt, No Shoes, No Service&quot;.  If you go into a store (and are walking,<br/>
not in a stroller or wheelchair, etc.), then you need to be wearing<br/>
shoes or you will most likely be kicked out of the store.  It isn&#39;t a<br/>
parent rule, but rather a store rule and general society custom.  Same<br/>
goes with shirts.  I&#39;ve actually seen this happen, so it isn&#39;t just a<br/>
myth.  Small babies are exempt.<br/>
