<div id="ygrps-yiv-407517523">At OSU, every student in certain majors had to take an English<br/>
proficiency exam.  If the score was too low, you had to take self-paced<br/>
remedial sessions.  My score was so high, that they asked me to be one of<br/>
the student tutors in the writing lab and help with the remedial<br/>
sessions.  I had to relearn all the parts of speech, etc. as I was<br/>
helping the students, as I couldn&#39;t remember much beyond basic nouns,<br/>
verbs, etc.  I&#39;m not sure if I could diagram a sentence then or now, but<br/>
I can recognize and write sentences correctly and know where to look if<br/>
I&#39;m not sure whether something is correct.<br/>
<br/>
Reminds me of the old &quot;when will I ever use algebra&quot;.  In fact, I use<br/>
algebra regularly in comparison shopping, altering recipes, and so on. <br/>
But it never looks like the stuff in the textbooks did.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is that the ability to USE a skill in daily life matters<br/>
far more than the ability to work problems on a piece of paper.<br/>

that&#39;s something I know I can learn quickly when I -do- need it. And if <br/>
college is the only reason I don&#39;t really see the big deal.<br/>
