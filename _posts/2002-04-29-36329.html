[Asked for explanation of what TCS is]<br/>
<br/>
The website is www.tcs.ac<br/>
<br/>
From there you can find articles, an email discussion list, a web-based<br/>
forum, an IRC chatroom, and an FAQ.<br/>
<br/>
The main premise, IMHO, is that parents must act morally.  I feel<br/>
everything else follows from this.  For example one part of acting morally<br/>
is not initiating force (or coercion, I think they are synonymous) against<br/>
*anyone*.  This would include one&#39;s own children most of all, parents<br/>
should be treating them BEST.  Another part of acting morally is to obey<br/>
obligations (breaking contract is force).  Creating rational, concious<br/>
entities entails certain obligations, so parents must respect these.  etc<br/>
etc<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I wrote:<br/>
<br/>
TCS<br/>
<br/>
Says you can raise your children without doing anything to them against<br/>
their will.<br/>
<br/>
Is non-coercive.  Rejects initiation of force, ever.<br/>
<br/>
Rejects compromises in favor of common preferences.<br/>
<br/>
Rejects all forms of authority which are really induction in disguise.<br/>
<br/>
Rejects self-sacrifice as a failure.<br/>
<br/>
Parents only self-sacrifice when there is a FAILURE. It&#39;s the parents not<br/>
the kids b/c the situation where the failure in common preference finding<br/>
occured was created by the free choices of the parents, not the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Kids are not &quot;allowed&quot; to do things because parents have no right to allow<br/>
or not allow things in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Parents are trusted advisors.<br/>
<br/>
Rejects &quot;natural&quot; consequences.<br/>
<br/>
Recognizes that preferences are mutable.<br/>
<br/>
Recognizes that all people, including, especially, parents are fallible.<br/>
<br/>
Realizes that parents have a lot of bad, entrenched theories and seeks to<br/>
minimize the transfer of these bad theories to the next generation.<br/>
<br/>
Is firmly based in Critical Rationalism, with a lot of credit to Karl<br/>
Popper. Knowledge growth comes through Conjecture and Refutation. Coercing<br/>
people is harmful and disrupts their knowledge growth.<br/>
<br/>
Does not treat parents and children as fundamentally different, except that<br/>
<br/>
parents do have some obligations to their children, and children tend to<br/>
lack knowledge so parents give lots of advice.</div>

Good luck on that one.<br/>
It&#39;s like defying gravity.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Recognizes that all people, including, especially, parents are fallible.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Parents are fallible, but there comes with parenting (IF people don&#39;t reject <br/>
it as unnatural, or care more about the neighbors than their own instincts) a <br/>
very strong instinctive care-package.  When parents have really nurtured <br/>
their awareness of their children&#39;s needs, they are NOT &quot;especially <br/>
fallible,&quot; but are tuned into their children in a way they will never be <br/>
tuned into another person again.  It is possible to ignore any instinct--our <br/>
culture is largely based on the repeated lie that human instinct has been <br/>
extinguished.  But for those who go first with their hearts and LATER consult <br/>
a rules chart, there is a bond between parent and child.  And to find <br/>
&quot;morality&quot; on a website instead of inside seems to me to be the last resort <br/>
of someone who went shopping for a philosophy.<br/>

Did the founders have really shitty childhoods?  Or is that also secret, <br/>
privileged, or allegedly irrelevant?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh please. I consider many of the things I&#39;ve heard from TCS people to be <br/>
immoral. One example. I have spoken to TCS followers who have said: &quot;We <br/>
offered our best theories&quot; on tooth decay to our little 2 yo Benjie and our <br/>
little Benjie listened and decided never to brush his teeth. So he hasn&#39;t <br/>
brushed for the last 5 years and now his teeth are in very bad shape and <br/>
really hurting and rotting and so we have offered our best theories about the <br/>
benefits of a visit to the dentist but little Benjie has decided not to go to <br/>
the dentist so we&#39;re letting him make that decision.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is NOT hypothetical - I&#39;ve seen similar situations posted umpteen times <br/>
on the TCS list.<br/>
<br/>
Two, three, and four year olds are NOT capable of projecting such current <br/>
decisions into the future repercussions of those decisions. To let them make <br/>
such decisions is immoral, imo. <br/>
<br/>
One thing I resent about TCS is that parents who are REALLY doing a great job <br/>
- parents who have bucked the trend of trying to manipulate their kids by <br/>
reward and punishment, parents who do NOT spank or shame or even punish their <br/>
kids, parents who are incredibly respectful and thoughtful and considerate <br/>
and who work WITH their kids and do NOT have an adversarial relationship with <br/>
them - it accuses these parents of all kinds of nasty-sounding things like <br/>
engaging in force, induction in disguise, failure, etc.<br/>
<br/>

Some of what is said here may challenge you, shock you, disturb you, or seem <br/>
harsh. But remember that people are offering it to be helpful and what feels <br/>
uncomfortable to you might be just what someone else needed to hear.<br/>

<br/>
Except for the &quot;incredibly&quot; part, our family is kind of a model of a good <br/>
unschooling family.  I&#39;ve had impatient days, but I apologize well.  All the <br/>
kids have had really grumpy days, and guess what?  They apologize sincerely <br/>
and on their own.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s true, I have seen other families scorned and insulted on AOL and <br/>
other homeschooling discussion places, and when families tell what they have <br/>
actually done with their own children that turned out well, or things they <br/>
did that they would like to have done differently, there&#39;s never been a <br/>
&quot;you&#39;re getting warm,&quot; only full-on &quot;That is coercion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And when the put-down comes from someone who only wants to vaguely say &quot;WE do <br/>
it better, and we do it the only right way,&quot; but won&#39;t tell who they or their <br/>
kids are, where they are, how long they&#39;ve been doing it, what they did <br/>
before, why they&#39;ve come to this, whether there are any long-term <br/>
practitioners or kids who can speak to their responses to it, the answer is <br/>
another round of scorn.<br/>
<br/>
If someone were saying &quot;Pecans cure cancer, ignore all you&#39;ve seen or <br/>
experienced about cancer treatment, all those treatments are criminal <br/>
violence, just use pecans the way we tell you to,&quot; but all who wrote the same <br/>
thing in almost the same words refused to tell whether THEY had had cancer, <br/>
whether they knew anyone who was in remission and maintenance because of <br/>
pecans, etc., *why* would anyone want to read more?<br/>
<br/>
The rhetoric of TCS is cold and sometimes seems nonsensical.  Their <br/>
rhetorical stance and tone remind me of Atlas Shrugged, in which capitalists <br/>
are sexy and glorious, while socialists (or democrats who raise money for <br/>
social causes) are portrayed as weak-minded dupes.   If the author refused to <br/>
be known and refused to share WHY she felt that way, and whether there was <br/>
anything beyond fantasy to her theories, it would be worth less than it is.   <br/>
<br/>
So here is another strongly-presented set of characterizations where the <br/>
&quot;audience&quot; is given no peek at examples, no background on the leaders and <br/>
authors, and insulted if they question.  Not only is coercion defined in a <br/>
particular and narrow way, other words and terms shift too.   And that <br/>
&quot;morality&quot; business is spotlighted a bit.   Here are a few quotes: <br/>
[all notes, punctuation, italics, ellipses, etc. are intact from the original]<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
Why do my critics never say of TCS people, “don&#39;t pass judgement on them”? <br/>
Why do they not say of the children being beaten, “don&#39;t pass judgement on <br/>
them”?! (N. B. in this context, “pass judgement upon” is a euphemism for <br/>
“use violence against”)-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-Let me elaborate on that. I&#39;m not saying we are obliged to set right all <br/>
evil in the world. We are merely obliged not to collaborate in it. If you see <br/>
the neighbours beating their children, there is, on the whole, no moral <br/>
obligation upon you to do anything about that-=-<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Do you (and others) think you should speak out each and every time you <br/>
witness the “beating” (coercive behavior)?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Who would our kids play with – or who could we ourselves associate with – <br/>
if we alienate conventional parents with our strong beliefs in morality? Not <br/>
that I think that we could not hold these beliefs even if we didn&#39;t want <br/>
to.... not like one can just get tired of believing that coercion is harmful <br/>
and immoral behavior wrong, and simply decide to believe differently.... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(four quotes above from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/Articles/SLTolerance.html">http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/Articles/SLTolerance.html</a> <br/>
)<br/>
--------------------<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Beating&quot; and &quot;coercion&quot; are used interchangeably, it seems.  So (it seems, <br/>
perhaps) that if a family can become calm about another family cajoling <br/>
(beating) they can remain *morally* aloof from a neighbor child screaming for <br/>
help from being struck by an adult with a belt or stick.  No difference, I <br/>
think the response would be (judging from some past conversations).  <br/>
