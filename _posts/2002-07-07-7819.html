<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129528586"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;My ds Jack (5) has long hair.  <br/>
&gt;.......I&#39;m just now getting to the point that I am<br/>
&gt;really comfortable with it, and actually like it!<br/>
&gt;If he ever does decide to go short again I will so<br/>
&gt;much miss the kid who is so cool as to go against the<br/>
&gt;norm.  .........It is really a statement of freedom<br/>
&gt;to me.  Freedom for children.  Anyway....this is just<br/>
&gt;another one of my break free from the masses <br/>
&gt;moment.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>............<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and realize I&#39;m a total freak to almost everyone I<br/>
&gt;know.<br/>
&gt;Joanna<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My younger son, who turned 4 in March, has long hair. <br/>
He has this wonderful wavy hair that falls in waves<br/>
and curls in the back.  When he was a baby he had<br/>
these big Gerberesque ringlets in the back.  I got a<br/>
lot of flak from people like my mother, who nagged<br/>
about getting his hair cut, and I worried that my love<br/>
of his ringlets was going to cause him embarrasing or<br/>
humiliating moments.  When he was 2, my husband (who<br/>
keeps his hair very short but has nothing against long<br/>
hair) took him to get his first haircut and almost<br/>
buzz cut him.  I cried.  Who was this little boy, and<br/>
where was my baby with the plump cheeks and the soft<br/>
ringlets?<br/>
<br/>
About 10 months ago I was trimming his older brother&#39;s<br/>
hair, who likes it in sort of a dutch boy, but up and<br/>
over the ears and above the collar in back, and when<br/>
it was Alex&#39;s turn he clapped his hands over his head<br/>
and said &quot;NO!  NO HAIRCUT!&quot;  I blinked at him. <br/>
&quot;What?&quot;  I said.  &quot;No HAIRCUT!&quot; he asserted, while<br/>
guarding his precious locks.  I was amused, but<br/>
figured he just didn&#39;t want a haircut right then,<br/>
maybe later.  Wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
You have to understand about this kid.  He has ever<br/>
been subject to the whims and machinations of his<br/>
overbearing elder brother who has a passionate,<br/>
artistic temperment and thinks he is King of the<br/>
House.  Alex, by nature is a very sweet, gregarious,<br/>
friendly kid.  EVERYONE likes him, no, loves him.  He<br/>
gets along easily with anyone, and at 4 is not shy<br/>
about striking up a conversation with anyone,<br/>
anywhere.  He&#39;ll also take a walk with anyone or go in<br/>
anyone&#39;s car, which scares me.  But since he is never<br/>
away from me, the fear is generally a passing thought.<br/>
 Alex has a great sense of humor, an easy laugh, and a<br/>
quiet self assurance.  He is easily affectionate, with<br/>
a hug for anyone who needs one and a hand for anyone<br/>
to hold.  He still likes to be &quot;hold like a baby&quot;<br/>
despite the fact that he is bigger than his older<br/>
brother in height and weight.  <br/>
<br/>
What he has never been is assertive, until now.  His<br/>
hair was the first thing he ever really put his foot<br/>
down about.  I didn&#39;t really understand at first that<br/>
he was saying NO HAIRCUTS ANYMORE.  He will allow that<br/>
I occassionally trim his bangs, but he is vigalent to<br/>
prevent any overtrimming.  He gets comments from<br/>
people, but not too many negative ones, living on the<br/>
Olympic Peninsula like we do.  I have a friend who<br/>
says it&#39;s &quot;takes her right back&quot; because he looks like<br/>
David Cassidy.  <br/>
<br/>
I think his hair issue was his first attempt at real<br/>
autonomy, after being under the thumb of his brother<br/>
all his young life.  It met with such success that he<br/>
is asserting himself in other areas, and has started<br/>
fighting back against his brother&#39;s pushiness.  His<br/>
latest crusade is a naked one.  He prefers not to wear<br/>
clothes, even underwear.  He goes naked much of every<br/>
day, putting on maybe a sweatshirt when he gets cold,<br/>
and getting dressed if we go out.  We don&#39;t let him<br/>
run around outside naked, because we have weird<br/>
neighbors, but we are moving in a week to our new 16<br/>
acres and he will be free from the prying eyes of<br/>
strange neighbors.  I am sure he will like that, since<br/>
just yesterday I had to pull him from his spot on the<br/>
porch in a very nice sunbeam outside.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128802774">My son heard comments from everyone regarding his long hair, by far the<br/>
worst was an older woman we didn&#39;t know who said,  - when are you going<br/>
to get your hair cut and look like a REAL boy? -  <br/>
<br/>
He was told more times than I can remember he was in the wrong rest room.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Some people didn&#39;t believe him when he said he was a boy, and didn&#39;t<br/>
believe me either when I confirmed it, as if we wouldn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
It was interesting.<br/>
<br/>
He cut it for his own reasons not having to do with mouthy old ladies,<br/>
but he already says he&#39;s going to let it grow again.  <br/>
<br/>
I like it long and in a few more years it will be like a flash back to<br/>
his dads long hair days.   He was 13 when I met him and that long blond<br/>
hair, well, you know the rest of the story.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-712078978">I&#39;ll vouch for that!  We used to be about 1/2 a mile<br/>
from the nearest neighbor, and it didn&#39;t occur to me<br/>
NOT to nude sunbathe, until the neighbor man started<br/>
stalking me and telling about WHAT EXACTLY he was<br/>
enjoying seeing with his binoculars!  UGH!<br/>

toxic.  &lt;g&gt;  Only one of our roosters is barred rock, and yes, he&#39;s <br/>
penned.  Except when he gets out.  But for those times we have our attack <br/>

putting the run on a deer.<br/>

straight hair, you have to use a dread wax product.  I have curly <br/>
hair and I just put my hair in small braids and left them in until it <br/>
dreaded naturally. <br/>
Try searching for &#39;how to get dreadlocks&#39; on Google.  There&#39;s <br/>
some good sites with lots of info about dreads and step by step <br/>
instructions on how to make them.<br/>
