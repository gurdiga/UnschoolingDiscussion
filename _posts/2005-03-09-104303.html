<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849539337">One of my children, at 18 months could carry on an intelligent conversation<br/>
with adults and was completely understandable.  He did develop a stuttering<br/>
problem at age 3 which went away without therapy by the time he was 4.  The<br/>
doctor said his brain moved faster than his mouth could which caused him to<br/>
not stutter like d-d-d- but to hold the first syllable longer than he should<br/>
and that he would grow out of it, and he did.  He is now 13 and he&#39;s still<br/>
talking up a storm.<br/>
<br/>
My second child was uneventful and had no therapy.<br/>
<br/>
My third child had 1 word at age 2.  2 months from being 3 I took him to his<br/>
pediatrician who did not suggest speech therapy, rather that he was just a<br/>
late bloomer.  My cousin&#39;s wife suggested Keep Pace who did implement Speech<br/>
Therapy and offered a diagnosis.  I contacted a developmental pediatrician<br/>
on my own and was soon given a diagnosis the same as Keep Pace&#39;s.....autism.<br/>
He is now 4 and attends private therapy 4 times a week, 2 speech 2<br/>
occupational.  He also has been enrolled in public school since the day<br/>
after he turned 3 in the Special Education Early Childhood program (PPCD)<br/>
where he gets more speech and occupational therapy.  Without early<br/>
intervention and massive doses of therapy in my 3rd child&#39;s case he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be making the progress he is now.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is important for parents to address their concerns about their<br/>
children without being overly paranoid.  Not every child needs to be put in<br/>
speech therapy, but some do.  Have faith in your pediatrician, but if you<br/>
still feel that something just isn&#39;t right then take it a step further and<br/>
do a little investigating of your own.  If the child truly has a speech<br/>
problem, then yes definitely get the therapy necessary to help that child<br/>
but give the child a chance first!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-887016355">My first daughter was an early talker with clear speech practically from the beginning and complete sentences by age two.<br/>
<br/>
My second daughter was not.  At age 5, I sometimes had to ask her to repeat something 2 or 3 times before I could figure out what she was saying because of her pronounciation of some sounds.  At 6 and 7, it was better, but still off - still hard to understand at times.<br/>
<br/>
I wondered if I should look into speech therapy or at least have her evaluated by &quot;an expert&quot;, but never did.<br/>
<br/>
This morning, at age 9 1/2 years, she recited a *commercial* that she, her sister, and dh have come up with to advertise a make believe golf aid.  I noticed that her speech was as clear as could be.<br/>
<br/>
I am mentioning this because the argument in the schooled world is so often that earlier is better for intervention when children have &quot;speech problems&quot;.  So I wanted to share my story of a child whose speech has improved without formal intervention.<br/>
