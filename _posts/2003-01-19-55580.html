<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<time>18 Jan 2003, at 10:21pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713605488">My 10 year old daughter is very interested in designing clothing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know where I can get more info on this, or software, or ideas for her?<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to look into the &quot;buyer&quot; aspect of it.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any info on this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My 10 year old daughter is very interested in designing clothing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Get her Barbies and lots of little cloth and there&#39;s a Barbie computer <br/>
program, I think, that has a clothes designing aspect.<br/>
<br/>
Help her learn to sew, and she can design clothes for herself, maybe fantasy <br/>
costumes, maybe just get an easy pattern with different sleeve and neckline <br/>
options, and she can make the same basic garment only long, short, <br/>
long-sleeved, fancy cloth, plain cloth, sheer sleeves...<br/>
<br/>
Even designers start with something basic and change details.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at costuming sites on the web would be way fun for her too, I bet.  <br/>
And People magazine, after anything like the Golden Globes (which is this <br/>
weekend, Sunday night) or Oscars will run an article on the dresses.  <br/>
<br/>
Going to the mall and looking at what&#39;s in store displays, and what&#39;s similar <br/>
and what&#39;s different would be informative.  Especially size 10 girls&#39; clothes <br/>
(Holly&#39;s very size) have a sameness and a monotony to them because people are <br/>
afraid to risk.<br/>
<br/>
Thrift stores will have things from ten and twenty years ago.  Sometimes <br/>
older, but not often the nicest stuff.  Older nice stuff goes to retro <br/>
stores.  And THERE is a cool thing to look at--stores that sell things from <br/>
the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s.  Just to LOOK at some of the 40&#39;s stuff, with trapunto and <br/>
piping and pleats...  <br/>
<br/>
Holly and I just saw and fully sequined dress at a thrift store the other <br/>
day.  That was a lot of work for somebody, and probably cost a few hundred <br/>
dollars new, in the 60&#39;s or whenever it was new.<br/>
<br/>
Looking comes first.  A range of awareness and appreciation for what&#39;s <br/>
already been done.  Books, websites, real clothes...<br/>

<br/>
Used book stores will have books on sewing and on costumes.<br/>
<br/>
Costumes will be the place to start, because &quot;designed&quot; clothing is <br/>
modern-day or slightly futuristic costume, or else it&#39;s just copying.  Things <br/>
roll along, and designers are the front edge (if they&#39;re lucky!).<br/>
<br/>
After learning to sew with patterns, I moved to diagrams and copying garments <br/>
(either measuring or taking them apart, variously).  Then I&#39;ve made things <br/>
without costumes.  Often medieval stuff from drawings or paintings, but I&#39;ve <br/>
done regular clothes for me which were &quot;designed&quot; one of a kind.  I did a <br/>
maternity skirt that was adjustable for the different stages, and the stomach <br/>
just stuck out, between wrap-around ties.  There was a matching top, but it <br/>
didn&#39;t cover over the whole belly.  Every detail was based on something I had <br/>
seen or done before, but as a whole it was unique.  It was bouncy and flouncy <br/>
and stripey and brave. &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;ve done more dressy stuff, but not lately. <br/>
<br/>
 Keith was showing me a pair of pants I made him years ago to wear over <br/>
armor.  They&#39;re getting worn out and he needs another pair.  I was surprised. <br/>
 I had forgotten how much detail went into those.  There were pleats and they <br/>
were designed to tie like karate pants, a string all the way around, through <br/>
big belt carriers, and there was a facing.  It was artsy.  And they&#39;ve lasted <br/>
ten years or so.   I guess I used to really LIKE Keith! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

season. this is like ART exhibiting for clothing designers so you get to see <br/>
the real creativity AND they usually have interviews with the designers who <br/>
talk about their inspirations, where they get the fabrics. Really cool.<br/>
