<div id="ygrps-yiv-431770018">My name is Christina.  I live in Granite Falls, WA.  I am married and have <br/>
three kids.  Kayleigh 11, Dylan 7, & Brenna 4.  We have been homeschooling <br/>
for 2 years and LOVE IT!  We started off very structured, then went straight <br/>
to unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
The only structure around here is my 7 year old asking &quot;when are we gonna do <br/>
school&quot;.  (I try to tell him we have been doing it all day long. &lt;g&gt;).  So, I <br/>
usually sit down and do math and reading with him.  The rest of his learning <br/>
comes under the heading of ONE BIG ADVENTURE.<br/>
<br/>
In the beginning, I did struggle with &quot;are they really learning&quot;.  But see <br/>
evidence of it all the time.  Our first year, we had many hardships (an <br/>
illness in family, a death).  So my very structured style went right out the <br/>
window.  I considered what we wre doing deschooling (for some term to tell <br/>
the relatives).  Then when I looked back, I was amazed at really how much my <br/>
kids did progress through the year.  So here we are.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong....I still do have the doubts sometimes.  MOSTLY wiht the <br/>
7year old since he isn&#39;t reading yet.  I think once he masters that, all the <br/>
doors will open and I can relax.  Silly huh?<br/>
<br/>
Glad to have found this list and look forward to meeting everyone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m in WA - we are able to test at home using Family Learning Organization&#39;s <br/>
testing services.  We don&#39;t have to turn in test results to anyone, we just <br/>
have to take them every year and have them available in case we decide at <br/>
some point, to send our children back to school.  We don&#39;t have to show <br/>
anyone &quot;progress&quot; at all.  We file our intent, make sure we are &quot;qualified&quot; <br/>
(there are four different ways to be &quot;qualified&quot; - we need to meet one of the <br/>
four) and file an &quot;Intent to Homeschool&quot; form every year.  Compulsory <br/>
attendance age is 8 years old, so we don&#39;t need to do ANYTHING until the <br/>
child is 8. (My dd turned 8 last July, this year is her first year to be <br/>
tested, registered, etc.)  When my youngest 2 turn 8, it will be after the <br/>
&quot;Deadline&quot; for entry into school, so we will wait an extra year to register <br/>
them...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502153532">I just realized that I have not really introduced myself. <br/>
<br/>
Hi! I&#39;m Rebecca sahm to 2 boys Jaiden and Avery and wife to Jason. We have been together for almost 8 yrs, and married for 1 1/2. I just turned 25. We live in San Diego Ca. We decided to hs in March of this year (after the constant nagging of my parents as to why Jaiden wasn&#39;t in preschool) I began researching hsing and all of the different options that I had, have to admit I looked into the whole school at home thing, I was very interested in Waldorf and Mason for a while, until one day I just watched my kids and BOOM I got it, this was their journey not mine, this was their path and their life to live not mine (and just becase something interested me did not mean that it would interest them.) I began to look at it as my privilege not my right to be able to share the journey with them and I will follow as long as they let me, I will help when they ask but I will (try really really hard) not lead. That realization was really a big one for me. I am also blessed with a dh that belives not only in hs but in unschooling, and is active in thr boys life. We do have are problems and things that we still need to work on and I do have to admit that everyday I read something on this list that gets me thinking and looking at my parenting and everyday I think i become a better parent and a better me. and I want to say thank you to all of you. You guys put so much heart into what you are saying and it touches me in very profound ways.  And also let me say that because of the opinions on this list there are 2 less kids being spanked, and 2 parents learning that there IS a better way<br/>
<br/>
Thank You All So Very Very Much<br/>

Your family sounds Great!  You&#39;re lucky to have a husband who&#39;s with you on <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe once a year I&#39;ve been involved in an online debate about <br/>
spanking.  It always goes like this:<br/>
<br/>
Someone says offhandedly that spanking&#39;s not so bad if done lovingly.<br/>
<br/>
People snark about that sarcastically, the Bible gets quoted back and forth <br/>
some (this discussion was light on the Bible part &lt;g&gt;), horror stories are <br/>
told, reinforcements are brought in from other lists, alternatives are <br/>
discussed, and sometimes then and sometimes months later, at least one <br/>
person, sometimes two or three, will say &quot;I quit spanking after that <br/>
discussion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s rarely the principal defender of the spanking whose mind is changed.  <br/>
That&#39;s fine, though.  There will be people who come through and read this <br/>
discussion later who aren&#39;t even here right now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096351649">Hi, I recently subscribed to this list. My name is Melissa and I&#39;m a single mother who is starting homeschooling my 5 yo. He technically doesn&#39;t &quot;start K&quot; til  fall, but he&#39;s ready and interested in things so I&#39;ve started teaching him numbers and addition. He loves science, and is very intesting in doing &#39;real expirements&#39; so we&#39;ve done some kitchen chemistry and discussed atoms and molecules and chemical bonds....<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading about unschooling and it sounds very interesting to me, so I thought I&#39;d check out this list to see how others do things. I think it may be a good fit for him, as he is stubborn about learning things unless he wants to...I&#39;ve tried to teach him to read and what&#39;s funnny is he knows the sounds of letter, how to blend the sounds, but is blocking anything beyond that. If I did not have an ex-h to deal with in matters reagrding my ds and his education this would not stress me but he has grudgingly agreed to homeschool...but...we have time...<br/>
My son is a high energy &#39;spirited&#39; and sensitive kid...I fear what school would do to him! <br/>

Yes, it&#39;s funny although his stubborness drives me nuts sometimes it is a quality I appreciate.

This Week&#39;s Experiment - #330 Water in a Glass<br/>
<br/>
This week I go back on the road, heading to East Tennessee.   I will be doing <br/>
<br/>
a show for the 4-H Electricity Camp at the University of Tennessee, some <br/>
science consulting and public shows at the American Museum of Science and <br/>
Energy <br/>
in Oak Ridge, TN on Saturday.   I will be doing shows on lightning and The <br/>
Science of Fireworks.   You can contact the museum for show times and <br/>
admission.<br/>
<br/>
This week&#39;s experiment has its roots in a phone conversation I had with my <br/>
friend Mik Jacobs (The Fire Guy, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://members.aol.com/findmik/)">http://members.aol.com/findmik/)</a>.   He is on <br/>
a <br/>
whirlwind tour, including Hong Kong, California and South Carolina.   We were <br/>
<br/>
discussing different ways to explain simple science experiments.   Later as I <br/>
<br/>
was doing the dishes, I followed up some of the ideas and would up with this <br/>
one.   You will need:<br/>
<br/>
a drinking glass<br/>
a sink or bathtub<br/>
water<br/>
a paper plate or piece of cardboard<br/>
<br/>
We will begin with a common, simple experiment.   Fill the glass to the top <br/>
with water.   Place the paper plate firmly over the top of the glass.   <br/>
Holding <br/>
it over the sink (in case it doesn&#39;t work), hold the plate firmly in place <br/>
and turn the glass upside down.   Then release the plate.   It should stay in <br/>
<br/>
place, and the water should stay in the glass.<br/>
<br/>
Why?   It is tempting to think that the plate is holding the water in, but it <br/>
<br/>
is not.   The plate is keeping the air out.   The air pressure outside the <br/>
glass is holding the water in.   How can we show that?  Well, first, we can <br/>
let <br/>
some air in to take the place of the water.   Keeping the glass over the <br/>
sink, <br/>
pull down on one side of the plate, just enough to let a little air get in.   <br/>
<br/>
What happens?   The water gushes out.   But wait.   Doesn&#39;t that also fit <br/>
with the theory that the plate was holding the water in?   <br/>
<br/>
To check that, we need to get rid of the plate.   Fill the sink most of the <br/>
way with water.   Holding the glass sideways, place it in the water.   Once <br/>
it <br/>
is totally filled with water, turn it upside down, keeping it under the <br/>
surface.   Lift it slowly upwards.   Though most of the glass is above the <br/>
surface, <br/>
the water stays inside the glass.   As long as the mouth of the glass is <br/>
under <br/>
water, no air can get into the glass, and the water can&#39;t come out.   The <br/>
external air pressure holds the water in, even without the plate.   As soon <br/>
as <br/>
the edge of the glass is lifted above the surface, air rushes in, and the <br/>
water <br/>
rushes out.   <br/>
<br/>
How can something as light as air hold up that much water?   The air around <br/>
you is pressing on everything with quite a bit of pressure.   At sea level, <br/>
it <br/>
presses with 14.7 pounds on each square inch of surface.   If you draw a grid <br/>
<br/>
of one inch squares on a piece of paper, you can place the mouth of the glass <br/>
<br/>
on the paper and see about how many square inches it covers.   Multiply that <br/>
my 14.7 pounds and you can see that you have quite a bit of pressure pushing <br/>
upwards.   When the glass if full of air at the same pressure, you have the <br/>
same <br/>
amount of push downwards as upwards.   They balance each other.   With the <br/>
glass full of water, when the water starts to move downwards, there is <br/>
nothing <br/>
to take its place.   This produces an area of extremely low pressure.   The <br/>
higher pressure on the outside is then plenty strong enough to keep the plate <br/>
in <br/>
place.   <br/>
<br/>
Have a marvelous week.<br/>

&gt; Yes, it&#39;s funny although his stubborness drives me nuts sometimes it is a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>quality I appreciate. He can also really argue his mind, which I&#39;ve had some<br/>
people tell me I need to &quot;fix&quot; that about him...I just say...hey maybe some<br/>
day he can be a lawyer...:) I figure between knowing and arguing his mind<br/>
he&#39;ll be less prone to negative peer pressure when he&#39;s older...<br/>
<br/>
I found with my youngest that it really helped me to call it persistance<br/>
rather than stubbornness.<br/>
