<div id="ygrps-yiv-152598945">I think schools would do best to let kids learn at their own speed, but not <br/>
even homeschoolers manage to do that much of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Many, most or all of us were ahead in school and had our minds numbed by <br/>
repetition, by being forbidden to read a book or draw or write DURING that <br/>
repetition, and we learned from that to get away with as little as possible.  <br/>
How small an effort will get me an A?  Why do one jot more?  (And why NOT to <br/>
do more is:  the other kids will shame you if you&#39;re a girl, and hit you if <br/>
you&#39;re a boy.)<br/>
<br/>
Some of the best teachers I had I consider best simply because they DID let <br/>
me read books when I wasn&#39;t &quot;doing my work&quot; (&quot;work&quot; meaning answering <br/>
questions at the ends of chapters in history and science books).  They <br/>
weren&#39;t always great teachers, they were just benevolent jailers.<br/>
<br/>
The same sort of damage sometimes done at schools can be done at home, too.  <br/>
If kids are required to sit absolutely still and quietly while mom reads, it <br/>
will be sooner that they don&#39;t want mom to read so much.  If kids are <br/>
required to &quot;do their work&quot; by the clock and calendar instead of by their <br/>
interest, soon they&#39;ll learn that great &quot;how little do I have to do&quot; trick <br/>
which can contribute to making such bad spouses and bad employees in the long <br/>
run.  If kids&#39; questions will only be answered during school hours, they&#39;ll <br/>
learn not to wonder and think during those off times, or they&#39;ll find someone <br/>
somewhere else who will answer their questions.<br/>
<br/>
I used to teach Jr. High, kids who were 12 to 15.  I did then and still do <br/>
have vivid memories of myself at that time--of whole conversations, <br/>
incidents, the very food at lunch and who I sat with lots of days--and I used <br/>
to say to the other teachers sometimes, &quot;Don&#39;t you remember what it felt <br/>
like!?&quot; and they would almost invariably look at me and in all seriousness <br/>
say, &quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have friends my age with maybe one or two traumatic memories of that age <br/>
period (or younger even), with maybe a vague memory of a summer camp or <br/>
something, but no details, no dialog, no names and birthdays.  Trauma will do <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
I also used to talk to my friends, just as I do with my friends now.  I&#39;d ask <br/>
them why they did and thought what they did.  I&#39;d ask them about their <br/>
parents and what they liked most about their parents and what they were <br/>
afraid of.  I was out unschooling sociology and psychology, I guess, in <br/>
retrospect.  <br/>
<br/>
So now sometimes I deal with homeschoolers who don&#39;t have vivid memories of <br/>
their own childhoods, nor of school, and some of whom were never analytical <br/>
about what teachers did and why, they just simply decided &quot;I hate it&quot; and <br/>
thought no more deeply about it.<br/>
<br/>
It helps when people have beliefs and theories and ideas to work from instead <br/>
of patterns.   Some people have criticized me on the grounds of their own <br/>
belief that I want to tell people how to homeschool.  I want people to show <br/>
me they&#39;re thinking about why they&#39;re doing what they do.  When someone asks <br/>
me for ideas or advice and they reject those without thought (it often seems, <br/>
and sometimes is confessed) just because the ideas and advice don&#39;t match <br/>
what they were already planning to do, I do get grumpy.  It&#39;s not because the <br/>
person won&#39;t do what I say--not at all.  It&#39;s because the person wasted my <br/>
time.  I thought they wanted new input.  What they really wanted was <br/>
validation.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot validate what people do unthinkingly.   It is hard to impossible to <br/>
unschool unthinkingly.  <br/>
<br/>
I have said sometimes that some people just cannot unschool; it won&#39;t work.  <br/>
I&#39;ve gotten criticism for that too.  I believe it, though.  Unless a parent <br/>
believes and practices learning for fun, that parent won&#39;t trust that <br/>
children can learn.  Unless a parent thoughtfully observes all the learning <br/>
that&#39;s going on around him--in his friends&#39; hobbies, in clubs, in playing, in <br/>
talking--he won&#39;t know where to look for learning in his children&#39;s everyday <br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
Someone wrote once &quot;You can&#39;t make me think.&quot;<br/>
Y&#39;think?!!?<br/>
Anyone who has read this far was thinkin&#39; up a storm.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-130133542">Doesn&#39;t the question of how hard you have to think about unschooling have<br/>
something to do with how thoroughly one is deschooled? Or how invested one<br/>
was in school&#39;s ways to begin with?<br/>
<br/>
For me, someone whose chief identity for many years was all wrapped up in<br/>
school, in being a great student, in being &quot;smart&quot; as school defines that,<br/>
if I&#39;m not thinking, I&#39;ll be reacting like that great student I once was:<br/>
worrying about whether my kids measure up to school standards, drooling over<br/>
curriculum catalogs, etc. So if I want to live out what I believe in my head<br/>
about how people, including children, learn and grow and thrive, I have to<br/>
think about it, analyze my reactions, poke and prod my gut-level feelings<br/>
and examine it all in the light of my intellectual beliefs.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m SOOO jealous.  Only a day or two later?  Not MY family.  More<br/>
like months or years....<br/>
<br/>
But, levity aside, I think you make an important point here.  We<br/>
can&#39;t know how someone else takes our words - or actions - based<br/>
on the immediate reaction.  We have to take it on faith that what<br/>
we say and do have impact somewhere, sometime.  That&#39;s both my<br/>
hope for the future and reason to try to be aware and careful<br/>
about what I say and do.   It&#39;s also what keeps me willing to<br/>
answer my support group&#39;s &quot;can you home school teens?&quot; calls.<br/>
It&#39;s also something that my teens sometimes have trouble<br/>
grasping.<br/>
<br/>
And, since I never posted an intro here, I&#39;m been living and<br/>
learning in three states with my family since 1988.  Kids are 16<br/>
and 19.  And no, I don&#39;t count the preschool years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-547114104">En garde, Sandra dear, I&#39;m about to disagree with you again. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Guilty as charged. I never thought much about why I disliked - okay, hated<br/>
- school. I just did. It was a gnarly place to be before I ever even heard<br/>
the word gnarly. I can&#39;t even imagine trying to be analytical about what<br/>
happened in school, what those teachers did or why they always acted so<br/>
weird - that was years ago, water under the bridge, who cares now? I yam<br/>
what I yam and that&#39;s cool.<br/>
<br/>

Sometimes it&#39;s a gut-level &quot;this feels right&quot; type of thing. If I had to<br/>
analyze what I do enough to explain it to someone else it would drive me<br/>
nuts. I do what I do and that&#39;s cool.<br/>

I&#39;m not Sandra, and I don&#39;t play her on TV.  I don&#39;t even dress up as her on <br/>
Halloween.  &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In the past, I&#39;ve seen people who didn&#39;t like Sandra&#39;s advice, metaphorically <br/>
take the advice, hurl it to ground, stomp it to bits, AND then whine about it <br/>
in an aggrieved tone.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s advice is strong enough to hold up under a little kicking -- but the <br/>
whining doesn&#39;t do anyone a bit of good.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s why she doesn&#39;t relish having her advice rejected?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, I believe it does. As I&#39;m deschooling myself I see changes in my kids<br/>
unschooling. It is a process that takes time. It&#39;s those moments when I see<br/>
myself being &quot;schoolish&quot; that I stop myself to actually think about why I<br/>
think it has to be done that way. At first I was worried that I might be<br/>
damaging my kids, but now I think that it is good that they see me<br/>
questioning that box I lived in. As I experience freedom of learning for<br/>
myself the more I can comprehend it for my kids.<br/>
Oh, btw, I&#39;m Tonia and joined a week or two ago. My DH and I have three kids<br/>
(10ys, 8yd, 5ys) that have always been unschooled (yes, even with my school<br/>
hang ups that I&#39;m trying to get over I consider them to be unschooled, thank<br/>
goodness for laziness-lol- I couldn&#39;t keep to a curriculum if I tried). I&#39;m<br/>
enjoying the discussions on this loop and look forward to many more.<br/>
