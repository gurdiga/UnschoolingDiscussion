COSI is in downtown Toledo, maybe 15-20 minutes from me on the highway. You <br/>
gotta check out our art museum and zoo too.<br/>

A very cool hands-on science center for the whole family.  There is a <br/>
section that is just for little kids that is just too cool.  We really <br/>
love going there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906206548">ok, thanks. looks to be like our city&#39;s science central.  that would <br/>
be neat to try as we had an annual pass to ours and got a little <br/>
burned out from going so much, or i should say i did.<br/>
