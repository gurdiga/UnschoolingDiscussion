<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610353436">&lt;&lt;and the guilt will go away...&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now Dawn  You are a Mom.  You know guilt is part of the package  :)<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s think about what Zach did today.  He watched an educational video for<br/>
about an hour and half (Magic Schoolbus x 3) during which he saw different<br/>
types of dinosaurs and how they lived.  He was also reinforced  in the idea<br/>
that it is OK to ask questions, to make mistakes, to make connections (gotta<br/>
love Ms. Frizzle).  Zach did some related Dinosaur activities (can we say<br/>
unit study, if that makes you feel better).  He spent time in loving<br/>
attachment with his parents and sibling.  He spent time enjoying the world<br/>
God/Goddess/Great &quot;I Am&quot;/Zeus gave him.  He physically exercised his body.<br/>
He went on a field trip to the store, saw wondrous things like pineapple<br/>
that he might never see otherwise in a natural state, smelled fantastic<br/>
smells like fresh bread.  He saw numbers in action (prices, measures) and<br/>
later spent 20 minutes utilizing math skills with Dad.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a busy day to me.  What I have discovered along the way is that<br/>
it isn&#39;t so much what we do, but how we approach it.  I&#39;m sure the grocers<br/>
hate to see us coming.  Me and my 5 kids---we smell everything, touch<br/>
everything, weigh everything, talking the entire time about whatever comes<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
It really gets easier Dawn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-384223158">I had one who learned that way - me trailing as I read.  Two who didn&#39;t. <br/>
As long as I wasn&#39;t covering up the pictures, none of them objected to me<br/>
doing it.  BUT and this is important - they all thought I was doing it to<br/>
keep my place.  I didn&#39;t tell them that, they made the assumption and I<br/>
just never said anything about it one way or the other - and in some ways<br/>
they were right.  If I was doing something else (or thinking about<br/>
something else) while I read, I sometimes was using it to keep my place. <br/>
I can&#39;t even say how often I did or didn&#39;t trail the finger.  <br/>
I didn&#39;t say anyone had to do it though.  I just said it was worth a try<br/>
since one of mine did learn from it.<br/>

Here is how I mistook it for a list directed at me:  The post began with <br/>
&quot; on 9/17/01 5:27 PM, Bridget E Coffman &lt;rumpleteasermom@j...&gt; wrote:&quot; <br/>
and a few lines in: &quot;I pulled the quotes from your original message that<br/>
were being objected to.&quot; and ended with a bunch of quotes of things I had<br/>
said previously.<br/>
And the discussion came about because I was talking about Rachel wanting<br/>
to go to college and needing to get used to what will be expected there.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to say it was not meant for me fine.  But I think the post<br/>
speaks for itself in that regard.<br/>

I wish my son had a day like yours!!  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
As far as questioning.  My advice is to hold out on discussing it <br/>
with others while your still in the process of figuring it all out <br/>
yourself.<br/>
I remember coming away from conversations, when we first started <br/>
unschooling, feeling very frustrated.  I couldn&#39;t get across in <br/>
words, what I knew in my heart.<br/>
Well, after 2 years of unschooling and 4 years of reading about it <br/>
and discussing it on message boards, I had 2 separate conversations <br/>
this summer about my ideas and philosophies.   I couldn&#39;t believe how <br/>
adept I have become at discussing it all.  <br/>
I walked away from both conversations feeling very good about how I <br/>
had related to these people.  <br/>
So, just give it time and don&#39;t worry about trying to convince <br/>
others.  Just work on finding your own way.<br/>
My best advice. :-)<br/>

&gt; (can <br/>
&gt; &gt; we say<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unit study, if that makes you feel better).  He spent time in <br/>
&gt; loving<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; attachment with his parents and sibling.  He spent time <br/>
enjoying <br/>
&gt; &gt; the world<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; God/Goddess/Great &quot;I Am&quot;/Zeus gave him.  He physically <br/>
exercised <br/>
&gt; &gt; his body.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; He went on a field trip to the store, saw wondrous things like <br/>
&gt; &gt; pineapple<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that he might never see otherwise in a natural state, smelled <br/>
&gt; &gt; fantastic<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; smells like fresh bread.  He saw numbers in action (prices, <br/>
&gt; &gt; measures) and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; later spent 20 minutes utilizing math skills with Dad.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds like a busy day to me.  What I have discovered along the <br/>
&gt; way <br/>
&gt; &gt; is that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it isn&#39;t so much what we do, but how we approach it.  I&#39;m sure <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; grocers<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hate to see us coming.  Me and my 5 kids---we smell everything, <br/>
&gt; &gt; touch<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; everything, weigh everything, talking the entire time about <br/>
&gt; &gt; whatever comes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; up.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It really gets easier Dawn.<br/>
