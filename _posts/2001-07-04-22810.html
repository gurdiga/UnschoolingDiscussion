&gt; FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AS YOU CELEBRATE INDEPENDENCE DAY.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Declaration of Educational Independence<br/>
&gt; by Linda Dobson<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    WHEN in the Course of human Events, it becomes<br/>
&gt; necessary for Families to dissolve the Educational Bands which have<br/>
&gt; connected them to a faltering Society, and to assume among the Powers of<br/>
&gt; the Earth, the separate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature<br/>
&gt; and of Nature&#39;s God entitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of<br/>
&gt; Mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to<br/>
&gt; the Separation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    WE hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men<br/>
&gt; are created equal,<br/>
&gt; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,<br/>
&gt; that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness-That to<br/>
&gt; secure these Rights, Education is instituted among Men, deriving its<br/>
&gt; just Powers from the Consent of the Educated, that whenever any Form of<br/>
&gt; Education becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the<br/>
&gt; People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Education, laying<br/>
&gt; its Foundation on such<br/>
&gt; Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall<br/>
&gt; seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Prudence, indeed, will dictate that a Public Education System long<br/>
&gt; established should not be changed for light and transient Causes; and<br/>
&gt; accordingly all Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to<br/>
&gt; suffer, while Evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by<br/>
&gt; Abolishing the Public Education System to which they are accustomed.<br/>
&gt; But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the<br/>
&gt; same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Government<br/>
&gt; Control, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Public<br/>
&gt; Education System, and to provide new Guards for their future Security.<br/>
&gt; Such has been the patient Sufferance of these Families; and such is now<br/>
&gt; the Necessity which constrains them to alter their former Educational<br/>
&gt; System.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The History of the Government-Controlled, Public Education System is a<br/>
&gt; History of repeated<br/>
&gt; Injuries and Usurpations, all having in direct Object the Establishment<br/>
&gt; of an absolute Control<br/>
&gt; over these Families.  To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid<br/>
&gt; World.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    THE GOVERNMENT has refused its Assent to Freedom in<br/>
&gt; Education, the most wholesome and necessary for the public Good.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IT has forbidden its Children Freedom of immediate<br/>
&gt; and pressing Importance...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IT has refused Freedom for the Accommodation of large<br/>
&gt; Numbers of Families, unless those Families would register with the<br/>
&gt; State, a violation of freedom and privacy to them, and formidable to<br/>
&gt; Absolute Control only.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IT has called together the Nation&#39;s Children at<br/>
&gt; Places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the warmth and<br/>
&gt; nurturance of their Parents, for the sole Purpose of fatiguing them into<br/>
&gt; Compliance with its Measures.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IT has dissolved Alternatives repeatedly with its<br/>
&gt; unceasing bureaucratic requirements, for opposing with manly Firmness<br/>
&gt; its Invasions on the Rights of the People.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IT has refused for a long Time, after such<br/>
&gt; dissolutions, to cause other Alternatives to be carried out; whereby the<br/>
&gt; Educational Powers, incapable of Improvement, have returned to the<br/>
&gt; failing System at large for their exercise; the Family remaining in the<br/>
&gt; mean time exposed to all the Dangers of Invasion from without, and<br/>
&gt; Convulsions within.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IT has endeavored to prevent the True Education of<br/>
&gt; the Population of these States; for that Purpose obstructing the Natural<br/>
&gt; Process of Learning; refusing to pass others to encourage their<br/>
&gt; Individual Efforts...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IT has obstructed the Administration of True<br/>
&gt; Education, by refusing to recognize the Sovereignty of Family.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IT has made Public School Employees dependent on its<br/>
&gt; Will alone, for the Tenure of their Offices, and the Amount and Payment<br/>
&gt; of their Salaries.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IT has erected a Multitude of new Laws, and sent<br/>
&gt; hither Swarms of Its Employees to harrass our People, and eat out their<br/>
&gt; Substance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IT has kept among us, often against the People&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Will, Standing Armies of Social Workers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IT has affected to render the Education Establishment<br/>
&gt; independent of and superior to the Civil Power.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IT has...subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign to our<br/>
&gt; Constitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws; giving its Assent<br/>
&gt; to...Acts of...Legislation:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    FOR quartering large Bodies of Compelling Troops<br/>
&gt; among us:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    FOR protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment<br/>
&gt; for any usurpation of Family Sovereignty which they should commit on the<br/>
&gt; Inhabitants of these States:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    FOR cutting off our Connection with True Education:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    FOR imposing Taxes on us used to Oppress us:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    FOR depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of<br/>
&gt; Family Time;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    FOR transporting our Children for large blocks of<br/>
&gt; their time;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    FOR taking away our Family Autonomy, abolishing our<br/>
&gt; most valuable Family Connections, and altering fundamentally the Forms<br/>
&gt; of our Families:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    FOR suspending our Parental Authority, and declaring<br/>
&gt; itself invested with Power to control for us in all cases whatsoever.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IT has abdicated Control here, by failing us its<br/>
&gt; Protection and waging Educational War against us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IT has plundered our Pocketbooks, ravaged our Family<br/>
&gt; Lives, burnt our Trust, and destroyed the Lives of our People.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IT is, at this time, forging new Laws to compleat the<br/>
&gt; Works of Despair, Desolation, and Tyranny, already begun with<br/>
&gt; circumstances of Cruelty and Perfidy, scarcely<br/>
&gt; paralleled in the most barbarous Ages, and totally unworthy the<br/>
&gt; Government School System of a civilized Nation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IT has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive<br/>
&gt; in our Nation&#39;s Classrooms, to become the Competitors of their Friends<br/>
&gt; and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IT has excited domestic Insurrections amongst us, and<br/>
&gt; has endeavored to bring on the Inhabitants of our Nation, the merciless<br/>
&gt; Conditioning, whose known Rule of Warfare, is an undistinguished<br/>
&gt; Destruction, of all Ages, Sexes and Conditions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    IN every stage of these Oppressions we have<br/>
&gt; Petitioned for Redress in the most humble Terms:  Our repeated Petitions<br/>
&gt; have been answered only by repeated Injury.  A Public Education System,<br/>
&gt; whose Character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant,<br/>
&gt; is unfit to be the Educational Controller of a free People.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    NOR have we been wanting in Attentions to our<br/>
&gt; Legislators. We have warned them from time to time of Attempts by their<br/>
&gt; very Government to extend an unwarrantable Educational Jurisdiction over<br/>
&gt; us.  We have reminded them of the Circumstances that brought us to this<br/>
&gt; point.  We have appealed to their native Justice and Magnanimity, and we<br/>
&gt; have conjured them by the Ties of our common Kindred to disavow these<br/>
&gt; Usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our Connections and<br/>
&gt; Correspondence.  They too have been deaf to the Voice of Justice and of<br/>
&gt; Consanguinity.  We must, therefore, acquiesce in the Necessity, which<br/>
&gt; denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of Mankind,<br/>
&gt; Enemies in War, in Peace, Friends.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;                    WE, therefore, the Families of the UNITED STATES OF<br/>
&gt; AMERICA, in GENERAL AGREEMENT, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge<br/>
&gt; of the World for the Rectitude of our Intentions, do, in the Name, and<br/>
&gt; by Authority of Sound, Sane Parental Consciousness, solemnly Publish and<br/>
&gt; Declare, That these United People are, and of Right ought to be, FREE<br/>
&gt; AND INDEPENDENT FAMILIES, they have full Power to levy Choice in Family<br/>
&gt; Education, consider the Family&#39;s Values and Time Needs to choose the<br/>
&gt; extent of participation in and support of the Public Education System,<br/>
&gt; contract Alliances, establish Family Priorities and Values, and to do<br/>
&gt; all other Acts and Things which INDEPENDENT FAMILIES may of right do.<br/>
&gt; And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm Reliance on the<br/>
&gt; Protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our<br/>
&gt; Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor. </span></blockquote></div>
