<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<time>14 Dec 2002, at 10:47pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-858176755">What other kinds of things do you think are an expression &quot;after the fact&quot; of natural things in the universe?<br/>
<br/>
Which ones do they still cram down children&#39;s throats in school.<br/>
<br/>
I know grammar and arithmetic are two.  Are there others that I&#39;m not thinking of?<br/>
<br/>
What about the writing process?  Is that the same, or is it just an easier way to learn how to express thoughts coherently?<br/>

Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

writing the mechanics of putting grammatical sentences on paper?<br/>
<br/>

about society&#39;s treatment of African Americans leading to how our history of<br/>
slavery still affects us today is real. But since we can&#39;t teach or test<br/>
thinking, since we can&#39;t create an atmosphere that would guarantee that<br/>
children would ask the &quot;right&quot; questions, memorizing the dates of the Civil<br/>
War and the 10 main causes is a substitute for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-689811024">You know, you are right.  I started thinking about it more after I posted.<br/>
<br/>
Really understanding that makes it so much easier to let go of preconceived ideas of what kids &quot;should&quot; know at any certain point in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
I like that.<br/>
