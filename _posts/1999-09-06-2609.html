<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982207727"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Unschooling at our house happens on days when I simply cannot sit with the<br/>
&gt; children for one reason or another.  Then they do what they want (other<br/>
&gt; than watch TV).  It&#39;s beginning to sound like I don&#39;t unschool at all<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Laraine,<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;ll decide unschooling isn&#39;t for your family and that&#39;s okay.<br/>
We&#39;re just letting you know how it works for us.   Foundations can be <br/>
important,  but what I have discovered is that if the foundation is <br/>
missing,  my son can go back and pick it up very quickly because he <br/>
needs it and he wants it.  Last year he was really enjoying physics.  <br/>
Then it got to the point where he realized he needed to back up a <br/>
little bit,  and work on some math to move on.  He even came to me <br/>
and asked me to refresh his memory about dividing decimals because he <br/>
needed it.  He had been &quot;taught&quot;  that earlier, but didn&#39;t remember <br/>
it because he wasn&#39;t using it.  When I was &quot;teaching&quot; him math,  I <br/>
always had to go over the lesson first, because even though we were <br/>
only doing 6th grade level math,  I had forgotten most of it - how to <br/>
multiply and divide fractions, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now,  he&#39;s starting to talk about going to college and future career <br/>
possibilities.  We absolutely discuss what foundation will be <br/>
necessary for those goals.  In the end though,  it will be his choice <br/>
what he does.  We talk about things like foreign language - how it <br/>
can be easier to learn the younger you are and how some colleges <br/>
require it.  We talk about how even though he dislikes writing,  <br/>
there&#39;s not a college I know of where he won&#39;t be expected to write <br/>
competently and even take some composition type classes.  My point is <br/>
that we make the case for foundation and encourage him to pursue his <br/>
goals.  We just don&#39;t force it.  He owns it.  It&#39;s his life and his <br/>
education.   Lastly,  we try to instill the sense that it&#39;s never too <br/>
late.  How many adults think that they can&#39;t learn an instrument or <br/>
go back to college - It&#39;s too late.  It&#39;s never to late to change and <br/>
learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786120329"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think it&#39;s hard for me, because of the way I was taught in public school and<br/>
&gt; at home, to watch my son learn in a non-linear way because it seems so<br/>
&gt; haphazard...that he&#39;s not going to learn everything about a subject (but does<br/>
&gt; he need to?). That&#39;s more my problem than his. Of course, I suppose it&#39;s hard<br/>
&gt; to know what a person is learning because you can&#39;t actually see knowledge.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t that the truth?  I think it&#39;s hard for all of us who were <br/>
raised in ps to observe &quot;learning in disarray,&quot;  so to speak.  We <br/>
want it to be neat and orderly.  Even though we know that it didn&#39;t <br/>
work for some of us,  it&#39;s so hard to let go of.   And, if it did <br/>
work for us,  it&#39;s even harder to let it go.  I had to accept early <br/>
on in our homeschooling adventure that my son&#39;s learning style is <br/>
completely different from mine.  When dh was working on his masters, <br/>
he took a course in learning styles,  and was able to help here.  <br/>
That&#39;s why unschooling was such a good option for us.  I&#39;m the <br/>
primary homeschooling parent and yet my learning style is a polar <br/>
opposite.   Trying to &quot;teach&quot; him was never going to work because I <br/>
couldn&#39;t even approach the subject in the manner that made the most <br/>
sense for him.  Imagine how exaggerated this becomes in a ps class of <br/>
25.<br/>

&gt; 1 less than 10). It seems less efficient, but it works better for some<br/>

this is how he multiplies,  I couldn&#39;t believe it.  As a die-hard <br/>
memorizer of multiplication tables,  it seemed crazy.  Now,  I see <br/>
how much it help as you go further up the scale.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-64915067">Dear Laraine,<br/>
<br/>
My ds is 15.  He has always struggled with math, until I let go and let him<br/>
choose what he wanted to do and how long her wanted to do it.  His<br/>
understanding of concepts and foundations began to improve tremendously.<br/>
Last year, his friends were starting algebra in school and he was anxious to<br/>
do algebra also.  I told him I thought he would have a difficult time with<br/>
algebra unless he really nailed down working with fractions, decimals and<br/>
percents, and offered to work with him.  Unfortunately, my sit-down school<br/>
time is very limited these days, and right away we both saw he was going to<br/>
need a more structured program in order to work on his own.  I ordered a set<br/>
of self-teaching workbooks, he flew through them, and is very excited about<br/>
beginning algebra now.<br/>
<br/>
My own algebra story is also enlightening.  I struggled bitterly with<br/>
algebra (and most math) in high school, and avoided it like the plague in<br/>
college.  When I was 40, I decided to go to nursing school, and had to take<br/>
entrance exams.  I borrowed a Saxon Algebra book from one of my<br/>
homeschooling friends, and spent about 6 weeks reviewing.  And ya know what?<br/>
It was kinda fun!  Not lots of fun, but it was like doing crossword puzzles.<br/>
But who (except my mother) spends several hours a day, five days a week,<br/>
nine months of the year, doing crossword puzzles?  (By the way, I did<br/>
extremely well on those entrance exams, way better than a math idiot like<br/>
myself could be expected to do).<br/>
<br/>
But Laraine, these are anecdotes, and I think you want more research-based<br/>
global answers.  I don&#39;t know that there are any, and homeschooling is one<br/>
area where every family has to find out what works comfortably for them.  If<br/>
unschooling worries you, makes you feel insecure about giving your children<br/>
the best you can, then it is not working for you.  But I am sure that you<br/>
are an insightful enough mother to see what is working best for your<br/>
children and change your approaches when you need to.  Don&#39;t base your<br/>
homeschooling or unschooling decisions on what works for others, only on<br/>
what works best for your family.<br/>
<br/>
Now here is some advice, that I have just advised you to ignore ;-D.  Don&#39;t<br/>
worry about time frames.  Don&#39;t fall into the trap of thinking, &quot;Oh, my<br/>
gosh, this child is 10 and doesn&#39;t know how to multiply!&quot;  Or &quot;We have been<br/>
using this book, and the children don&#39;t seem to know any more about<br/>
fractions than they did 3 months ago.&quot;  Change the approach or the program,<br/>
but don&#39;t agonize over the wasted time.<br/>
<br/>
Now a word about foundations.  It seems to me, and forgive me if I am<br/>
misreading you, that you are concerned about the foundations for math much<br/>
more than for English, science or history.  Is this because you yourself<br/>
find math more difficult?  You seem to think that the immersion method of<br/>
learning will work for the others, but not for math.  But I believe that<br/>
research in education methodology has shown that immersion in ANY subject<br/>
area works well.  (Too bad most educational institutions ignore this).<br/>
Perhaps it would be a good idea to think about whether it is your own<br/>
discomfort with math that is driving you to mistrust an unschooling<br/>
approach.<br/>

school math.  They can do trig, calculus, etc.  Then he asks them to <br/>
find the volume of a circular bin and they&#39;re lost.  They want to <br/>
know what the formula is.  He asks them where they think they can <br/>
find the formula.  He gets blank stares.  They are so used to <br/>
plugging given numbers into formulas that they can&#39;t make any <br/>
practical connection.  Hopefully that&#39;s something that they finally <br/>
get in his class,  but it&#39;s very frustrating for many of them.<br/>

started unschooling too late to take advantage of them,  but we have <br/>
found some other things we enjoy.  First off - logic puzzles - and I <br/>
won&#39;t even confess that I didn&#39;t know these were math when we started <br/>
unschooling.  Second, there&#39;s a book called Family Math and now two <br/>
new ones - one geared to younger kids and one to older.  These <br/>
involve all kinds of math games and experiments that the whole <br/>
family can do.  For more advanced math,  we are enjoying the Harold <br/>
Jacobs, Algebra, Geometry and Mathematics, A Human Endeavor books.<br/>
Some unschoolers really like the Key To Series because they are <br/>
workbooks that are very self-directed.  There are many other fun type <br/>
math books out there - Marilyn Burns writes some like, Math for <br/>
Smarty Pants.  We like the reader&#39;s digest - How Math Works........<br/>

days.  And, you are right.  I failed math and chemistry in high school, but, <br/>
when I needed it, and saw the need for it in my nursing, I could apply myself <br/>
and buckle down and study and learn, cause I saw the connection to something <br/>
I wanted to do.  It wasn&#39;t algebra, or trig, but nursing math, where you <br/>
learn the formula for dosage, and, even Thu I haven&#39;t practiced in 12 years, <br/>
I can still do the math!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999333750">Well, Teresa, med math *is* algebra.  Pretty basic, beginning algebra, but<br/>
algebra nevertheless.  Pediatric dosages and IVs are less basic.  All those<br/>
drops per minute (shudder).  You may memorize the formula, but you need to<br/>
know how to apply it.  So there we are with a great example of Real Math.<br/>
<br/>
If you sit down and really examine the math textbooks, you will see that<br/>
after children have learned the basic operations and how to work with<br/>
decimals and fractions (usually by the end of fourth grade), the next few<br/>
years are review, review review, with bigger numbers every year, and a few<br/>
frills, like probability and pre-algebra thrown in.  My opinion is, once<br/>
again, that what a fifth grader may spend a week working on, an eighth<br/>
grader will grasp in an afternoon.  So why sweat your fifth grader and<br/>
yourself through the misery?<br/>
<br/>
Relax, put on some good music, and play one of those math games!  Or double<br/>
a recipe, or measure the living room to see if you can fit a new couch in.<br/>

Funny you said it this way.  Over the weekend I&#39;ve given it a lot of<br/>
thought and oddly enough I really enjoy math - love it in fact.  Never got<br/>
into the higher maths much but did well at any that I attempted.  But my<br/>
dear Dad was such a pusher on math that to him that was all there was that<br/>
was needed in life!  While I disagree with him, I know that math is what<br/>
made all the difference in his life.  So he PUSHED it HARD with me as I was<br/>
growing up.  I&#39;m starting to look at this and attempting to decide if it<br/>
has anything to do with my attitudes about math.  Also, dh is a structure<br/>
freak!  He&#39;d probably lose it if he really knew how flexible I am with the<br/>
girls.  Math is why I consider myself eclectic in approach.  I can let go<br/>
of just about anything else but math....hmmmm a little of my Dad in me<br/>
perhaps.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks all for your comments, I&#39;ve learned a lot - much of which I had<br/>
actually not thought of before.  DD is an interesting kid.  On one hand she<br/>
seems to want to flit through subjects (no depth - I drag her through the<br/>
park) and yet she will complain that she didn&#39;t feel like we had<br/>
&quot;completed&quot; any specific subject (thus I feel like I didn&#39;t drag her<br/>
through the park enough!)  :o)  I think both she and I are going to need<br/>
some more deschooling to overcome a lot of this stuff.  I can really see<br/>
how my youngest dd could unschool without a hitch - but the older one wants<br/>
direction while bulking at it.  Sigh.  Don&#39;t give up on me - I&#39;m still<br/>
learning myself - this is only year 2 for us as hsers!<br/>

I personally think it&#39;s wonderful - the amount of thought you&#39;re <br/>
giving this - the willingness you have to learn.  Assuming your <br/>
daughters have inherited that willingness - you&#39;ll be fine!  I had to <br/>
laugh at what you said about your dh and structure.  I think it was <br/>
easier for my dh to accept unschooling than it was for me for one <br/>
simple reason - control!!  I&#39;m definitely more of a controlling <br/>
person.  I think that&#39;s why with unschooling,  I have to go all the <br/>
way.  I have to completely relinqish my control over my kids <br/>
education.  Otherwise,  I&#39;m in their face.  It&#39;s been really hard for <br/>
me,  but I&#39;ve grown a lot because of it.<br/>
