<div id="ygrps-yiv-270458956">I may be late in this post but I am still working on catching up with my <br/>
mail...:)<br/>
<br/>
I have two boys...birthdays...10/27/90 and 7/31/92...<br/>
<br/>
My oldest being born on the even month gets to have control of the TV remote <br/>
and control of the nintendo on even days...but he is also assigned some of <br/>
the more unpleasent and intensive chores on the even days as well...On Odd <br/>
days...he gets unlimited to limited access to the computer depending on if I <br/>
am using it...or if we need to go out and about...<br/>
<br/>
My younger son being born during the odd month gets the TV and nintendo on <br/>
odd days as well as the chores that the oldest has on even days and gets the <br/>
computer on Even days...<br/>
<br/>
So far that is working out to a degree...the rules are that if they choose <br/>
not to be on the computer, the tv, or the nintendo on their given days then <br/>
the other child gets to use it...but the other child has to give way when the <br/>
primary user wants thier time back...does that make sense...?<br/>
<br/>
That was the easiest way for me cuz I could never remember who used what <br/>
last....lol...I can see this mite work for more children if one thinks about <br/>
days divisible by three and four and five...<br/>
