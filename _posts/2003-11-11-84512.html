Shyrley, I will miss you very much and hope you have a safe and uneventful <br/>
trip back across the pond. I look forward to seeing you back here in December. <br/>
Take care and come back to us soon!<br/>
<br/>
On the same topic, I will be going no mail tomorrow evening also. I will be <br/>
having surgery on Friday morning and will be in the hospital about four days <br/>
and recouping at home after, with no idea when I will be back on. Soon, <br/>
hopefully!<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck and safe travels Shyrley and family!<br/>
