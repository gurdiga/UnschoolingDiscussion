<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286070806">&quot;Again, ladies, thank<br/>
you for the acknowledgement that it is different depending on where<br/>
one lives. krista&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well...yes and no.<br/>
There is an undercurrent of rudeness towards children everywhere. <br/>
I&#39;ve seen some amazingly mean behavior in just about every one of <br/>
the 26 states I&#39;ve visited.<br/>
There is a different feel in the South, yes. It&#39;s definitely more <br/>
title and class oriented, but treating children as &quot;lesser beings&quot; <br/>
seems rampant in our country.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve managed to surround ourselves with people that really like <br/>
kids and treat them with respect, so it&#39;s just not part of our daily <br/>
lives. We hear and see stuff when we&#39;re in public of course, but <br/>
we&#39;ve been fortunate to build a wonderful community of respectful <br/>
people around us.<br/>
Even in the classes they&#39;ve chosen, we&#39;ve lucked out for the most <br/>
part (though Jared&#39;s Karate instructor was BIG into the &quot;sir&quot; thing).<br/>
Hang in there. A lot of Southerners are progressive, it just takes a <br/>
while to find them!<br/>
