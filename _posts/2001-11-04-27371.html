<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123637591">I love it when I hear parents that do not gender-label toys or colors!<br/>
That&#39;s awesome! but here&#39;s a question for all. If one&#39;s son were a &quot;fairy&quot;<br/>
would that change your feeling or acceptance? Words can be very powerful<br/>
things and  can be hurtful even if not intended to be. I don&#39;t &quot;worry &quot; that<br/>
my son or daughter would be gay or lesbian. I worry that they won&#39;t be a<br/>
content, happy confident, caring individual.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;hello i rarely say much around here.. but i very much enjoy reading<br/>
 </span></blockquote>everyones ideas and life stories!! but today i want to say something.. we<br/>
had friends over who had a little boy and he wanted to play with the doll<br/>
house they would not let him.. kept telling him it was a girl thing.. the<br/>
child was upset way too much.. we personally would have let him.. we believe<br/>
a boy can learn much playing with a doll house..  anyways on to my middle<br/>
boy.. when he was small he loved to dance like a ballarina.. and his<br/>
favorite color was pink... pink toys.. bottles blankies.. i swear i had<br/>
nothing to do with it .. i have kept his pink elephant and pink teddy bear<br/>
for years now though.. believe me he is not a fairy.. he is all boy just<br/>
very very artistic, acting.. he makes videos and impersonates people all the<br/>
time.. i need not worry that he loved pink and danced like a ballarina when<br/>
he ws 2.. i have also seen my boys take dolls and hang them from the<br/>
stairs.. etc... sometimes it is too funny.. i personally do not think we<br/>
have to worry!! just my 2 cents..<br/>
