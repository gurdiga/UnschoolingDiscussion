<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096263926">I was just reading one of Sandra&#39;s articles on unschooling called Tiny <br/>
Monsters. I don&#39;t know why, but it made me cry. It struck some deep chord <br/>
deep inside me. Was it just one of those moments women have when they break <br/>
down crying? Probably. Am I just being silly, a moment of insanity? Probably. <br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter, I must have needed to cry, some deep seeded depression, or <br/>
some tiny monster bugging me and I didn&#39;t even know it was there. So thanks <br/>
Sandra, thanks for the good cry. <br/>

&lt;&lt; Sandra, thanks for the good cry.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

I really want to say &quot;I&#39;m really sorry it made you cry.&quot;  I went back and <br/>
read it, though, and realized it made ME cry one time.   <br/>
<br/>
The other night Holly was expressing some hurt and sorrow she has about a <br/>
relationship with one of her friends, and I said as sweetly as I could, <br/>
&quot;Holly, sometimes I wish you had never been born.&quot;  She didn&#39;t take it <br/>
horribly.  We just hugged each other, and I said that probably sounds <br/>
TERRIBLE, but if I hadn&#39;t had her, [that person]  couldn&#39;t hurt her.<br/>
<br/>
And her incident wasn&#39;t even among the greatest horrors a little girl can <br/>
suffer, but I didn&#39;t tell her that.  Because hurting is hurting, and saying <br/>
&quot;Oh, buck up--it&#39;s not like you&#39;ve been molested or someone has died&quot; would <br/>
be cruelty on top of pain.  I remember cruelty on top of pain sometimes from <br/>
my own childhood, and I try hard to avoid doing that even accidentally.<br/>
<br/>
So I sat with her in her moment of sadness and felt how good and <br/>
tender-hearted she is, and hoped and wished that my decision to have a third <br/>
child would bring more joy to her and others than pain.  And I&#39;m crying just <br/>
writing that, so that makes two good cries, Nancy, so I&#39;m going to go and do <br/>
something physical.  The house is quiet so I need to find a corner and do <br/>
something where I won&#39;t wake anyone up.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t anyone be mean to your kids today, please.  There will be enough hurt <br/>
without us adding to it.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know why, but the end of your post reminded me of someone we saw at <br/>
the post office the other day.  Liam and I were leaving the post office on <br/>
a hot, sunny, dry day just after we had finished a session of <br/>
pottery.  Liam was holding a toy and walking and singing and talking to <br/>
himself, as he usually does, and an elderly woman, observing Liam, said, <br/>
&quot;She&#39;s so happy.&quot;  (Liam&#39;s hair is really long and lots of folks think he&#39;s <br/>
a girl, even though he&#39;s 7-1/2.) I said, &quot;Yeah; it&#39;s a beautiful summer <br/>
day; kids should definitely be happy during the summertime.&quot;  This wise <br/>
woman replied, &quot;Kids should be happy all year long.&quot;  She is absolutely <br/>
right.  That&#39;s why (at least in part) I took him out of school!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all on this list for the beautiful reminders.<br/>

  now i&#39;m crying too! my daughter just left with her father and it breaks my <br/>
heart, i went to his house and picked her up last night but he wanted her to <br/>
come back today. he&#39;s rather cold and blunt like you were referrring to, he <br/>
loves her and i don&#39;t think he even sees himself as being mean. i was an <br/>
abused and abandoned child and can&#39;t bear the thought of my dee going threw a <br/>
second of what i did. i think we should all try to go out of ourway to say <br/>
positive things to our children everyday!!! i know sometimes there&#39;s so much <br/>
going on bad it&#39;s hard to find the good but when you do you can almost see  a <br/>
child light up from the inside out. <br/>
