<br/>
Why don&#39;t you try the 4-H for a month? I&#39;m sure her spot at the center <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be lost if she left for a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re looking for a reason to change: tell her that different trainers <br/>
have unique things to offer. Years ago when I owned a tack shop, I took a <br/>
class every weekday morning (before opening at 10:00) from a different <br/>
trainer---I can&#39;t tell you how much I learned in a few months&#39; time. This vs <br/>
classes from the same trainer all the time. She would probably be surprised <br/>
at the HUGE improvement in a short amount of time by changing for a while (or <br/>
permanently).<br/>
<br/>
Plus the more you&#39;re &quot;on&quot; and around the horses and the more (different) <br/>
horses you&#39;re with, the more they (the horses) put you on the spot to <br/>
perform---and improve. <br/>
<br/>
As for expenses---has she not looked into working for time on? Mucking <br/>
stalls? Pulling manes? Feeding in the mornings (since school kids don&#39;t have <br/>
this opportunity)? Or evenings? If it&#39;s a ritzy equestrian center, she might <br/>
find someone with $$ but not a lot of time who would like her to ride or <br/>
groom or clean tack. Or even hand-walk/bathe a sick horse.  <br/>
<br/>
I used to make a TON of money as a teen because I could clean tack like <br/>
noone&#39;s business. I could also clip the horses and pull & braid manes. I&#39;d <br/>
take folks&#39; tack home with me Thursday nights and clean it all, then be at <br/>
the barn by 4:00 to braid manes and tails before the shows. I charged by the <br/>
braid! I can make &#39;em REALLY tiny and neat!! &lt;G&gt; With colored yarn, extra! I <br/>
put checkerboards on their rumps for extra. I was the only one at one barn <br/>
who knew how to put bandages on---this back when they were quilts and wraps <br/>
and not velcro! &lt;G&gt;  I usually MADE money on foxhunt/event/show weekends even <br/>
WITH entry fees, trailer fees, and food.<br/>
<br/>
It depends on the barns. I started at a &quot;poor&quot; barn where everyone did her <br/>
own work---and learned A LOT!!! But the high-rent barns are a GREAT place for <br/>
making $$$ doing stuff other folks don&#39;t WANT to do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be happy to talk with her about stuff! She can IM me anytime!<br/>
