<br/>
My husband and I were both spanked.  It taught me to resent my parents who were hypocrites at the time.<br/>
<br/>
My husband says he learned to respect his mother (and he *did* respect her) bec. of the spankings.  But then she was no hypocrite either.<br/>
<br/>
He thinks I&#39;m not making the kids work hard enough for what I give them.  I tell him what I give them is part of their education.  He says he didn&#39;t have those things.  I say he had those opportunities in school.<br/>
<br/>
So, I don&#39;t have any answers.  <br/>

over them.  When I was spanked as a child I was never told that it OK for my <br/>
mother to spank me but not any other adult.  I was led to believe that all <br/>
adults had authority over me.  My grandmother could spank me, the neighbors <br/>
if I were doing something considered inappropriate, etc.  I always want my <br/>
boys to question authority.<br/>

being spanked he learned to respect his mother, but as a child did he respect <br/>
or fear her?<br/>
I feared my mother.  My heart would pound if I heard her footsteps on the <br/>
stairs etc.  <br/>
<br/>
At my dad&#39;s funeral we flew home from Germany, my mother had passed the year <br/>
before, we slept in my old room.  And my brother and his family slept across <br/>
the hall in his old room.  Everytime I heard one of them coming up the stairs <br/>
my heart would pound like I was a child again.  Pavlov all over.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess I learned to respect my mother despite how she spanked me.  I believe <br/>
she was doing the best she could at the time with the information she had.  <br/>
Had she know a different way I believe she would have chosen it.  She had so <br/>
many other great qualities about her.  <br/>

Pam, that is so sad.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;re able to heal from that, in part, by how you treat and feel <br/>
about your children.<br/>

Thanks for sharing that even the sounds of others on those stairs brought <br/>
back the feeling.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do feel that people don&#39;t realize the effect spanking has on a child long <br/>
term.  <br/>
<br/>
I also have discussed this with my boys.  How I was raised, why I think my <br/>
Mom did the things she did, why I choose not to.  How that made me feel <br/>
etc,etc.  I think in that way we grow as individuals.  Even though my Mom was <br/>
not around to know my boys I tell them all about her, good and not so good.  <br/>
I guess I want them to know that parenting is a choice like a lot of other <br/>
things in life.  I wear a pin that says &quot;parenting by choice.&quot;  You can make <br/>
changes and choices for yourself.  You don&#39;t have to do things because that <br/>
is the way you were raised or because society says you should etc.  And with <br/>
unschooling you are choosing something great that not many other people have <br/>
discovered.  I am making a choice to do better than my parents.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway too long <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Physical force for detainment is completely different than physical<br/>
force of beating and hitting.  There are many police officers who _DO_<br/>
go too far!  That is NOT fine.  We, as citizens, should help enforce<br/>
that when a cop hurts a person that the cop is accountable for their<br/>
actions.  Of course, they should be able to defend themselves when<br/>
needed.  We ALL should, and I&#39;ve taken lots of training to ensure that<br/>
*I* could if I needed to.<br/>
<br/>
I have physically restrained my children.  I don&#39;t like it.  However,<br/>
when we are in a crowded parking lot with cars going way too fast<br/>
everywhere and my little child wants to run around, I pick them up and<br/>
hold them.  I don&#39;t do this harshly or in a mean manner and I usually<br/>
say something along the lines of, &quot;There are cars everywhere and you are<br/>
too little for them to see you, I need to hold you.&quot;  Sometimes that has<br/>
been fine, sometimes they&#39;ve screamed, &quot;No!&quot;  Either way, I remain calm<br/>
and talk (sometimes whisper) to them about how this situation is no fun,<br/>
so let&#39;s hurry and get out of it.  And, the biggest solution for not<br/>
ever doing this type of physical restraint ever is to avoid these<br/>
situations with toddlers that don&#39;t quite get it yet.  :)  I do a lot of<br/>
internet shopping.  <br/>
<br/>
Just now, my 2.5 yo showed me another way in which I have been and will<br/>
continue to be physical with her:  She was yanking on her older sister&#39;s<br/>
neck hurting her and not realizing it, but nevertheless trapping here<br/>
sister and causing pain.  I swooped in, picked her up, exclaimed that we<br/>
don&#39;t hurt Zoe, then took her to sit with me instead (she is now<br/>
breastfeeding while I type one handed).  That was very much an authority<br/>
coming in and doing a physical action.  This is fine, actually good.  If<br/>
I hadn&#39;t stepped in, she would have learned that she could hurt her<br/>
sister and her sister would have learned that I wouldn&#39;t be there to<br/>
stop it.<br/>
<br/>
THIS IS NOT ON THE SAME LEVEL AS SPANKING!  Police interaction shouldn&#39;t<br/>
be, either.<br/>
