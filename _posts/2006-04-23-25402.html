I&#39;ve lately taken a job doing legal-assistant tasks on a contract  <br/>
basis.  The lawyer I&#39;m working for is amazed at how quickly I pick  <br/>
things up.  She&#39;s dazzled, and I like that.  It won&#39;t last forever,  <br/>
though.  There are only so many easy new concepts to pick up quickly  <br/>
and then she&#39;ll be expecting me to learn quickly, and I&#39;ll probably  <br/>
be bored instead of stimulated by newness.**<br/>
<br/>
I was watching a newish Barbara Sher inspirational life-coaching type program on PBS last night.  Her new book and program are titled Refuse to Choose, and seem to be all about people who like to try lots of new things and not settle down.  She describes people like this as &quot;scanners&quot; and talks about types of jobs that this style is good for.  I dozed off after half and hour, but think I will look for her book at the library.  &quot;Scanner&quot; sounds somewhat cooler than dilettante.  <br/>

  Hmmm,, I wonder if that&#39;s the book she was writing when she had people write to her about letting their kids quit activities-- sounds possible anyway.    I remember Kathryn Baptista asking different discussion lists for stories from families.    I think I submitted one.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  Anyone else remember this?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665588998">Eh, don&#39;t remind me. My kids just decided to quit tae kwon do. When  <br/>
my parents found out they had a total freakout, because OBVIOUSLY it  <br/>
was the only normal thing they were doing. Josh is still in scouts,  <br/>
but no one WANTS to do anything. Primarily because the classes always  <br/>
pop up when we are doing something fun. I had no problem with them  <br/>
quitting, but boy, they sure did.<br/>
Is it typical for kids to not want to do outside activities? Is that  <br/>
something that changes with time, weather, etc? I worry that maybe  <br/>
I&#39;m not strewing enough. KWIM?<br/>

Instead of &quot;quit&quot; tae kwon do, if you say &quot;They&#39;re going to take some  <br/>
time off,&quot; or they&#39;re not going to do it for a while, or the might  <br/>
start up again in the fall or some such.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worked with all kinds of things like reading and spinach and  <br/>
different kinds of music, and shoes, and showers...<br/>

Ooo, thanks Betsy.  You made my night.  I&#39;ve been struggling with labeling <br/>
myself a  dilettante lately!  I think I need to look at this book too.  I&#39;d <br/>
like to be positive about my flitting interests.  I just hope I can stick <br/>
with the massive gardening plan I&#39;m working on.<br/>
