<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206981217">Two great books for very cool children&#39;s gardens are Roots, shoots, <br/>
buckets & boots : gardening together with children / Sharon <br/>
Lovejoy.   and Sunflower Houses : Inspiration From The Garden : A <br/>
Book For Children And Their Grown-Ups / by Sharon Lovejoy.  One of <br/>
my favorite things is her suggestion to listen to the plants and <br/>
trees with a stethoscope.  This year we have a stethoscope and I <br/>
can&#39;t wait to do it. <br/>
<br/>
Also Square foot gardening / by Mel Bartholomew is fabulous.  One of <br/>
his most freeing (to me) gardening points is that all vining plants <br/>
can be grown vertically, except perhaps with the exception of giants <br/>
like giant pumpkins and hubbard squash.  But with a strip of grass <br/>
you could dig it and erect a 60ft tall structure with jack o <br/>
lanterns, pumpkins, various vining beans and flowers, etc.  Or make <br/>
a pole tent and grow these things.  Birdhouse gourds or yard-long <br/>
runner beans might be fun to grow in a tipi, and the gourds would <br/>
prolong into winter fun.  <br/>
