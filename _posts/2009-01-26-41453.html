<div id="ygrps-yiv-374421383">Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently in a discussion with this guy about unschooling and do<br/>
not want to give erroneous information. He has asked a couple<br/>
questions that I don&#39;t want to answer my usual dry way of answering so<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if you guys would tell me how you would answer him so I<br/>
can attempt to formulate a decent answer. Here is his question:<br/>
<br/>
/begin paste<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If I&#39;m understanding this correctly, &quot;unschooling&quot; is about<br/>
encouraging and motivating a student/child to learn about what really<br/>
interests him or her rather than forcing upon the student/child the<br/>
exact same curriculum as everyone else. The idea behind this is that<br/>
this will produce students who are happier and much more motivated to<br/>
be part of the educational process, which will in turn produce more<br/>
productive doctors, engineers, chemists, etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
If I have all that correct, then I would have to follow-up with:<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the process for uncovering what the student really wants to<br/>
learn about? Wouldn&#39;t we need to expose the student to multiple areas<br/>
of study or could we use something like a series of aptitude tests?<br/>
<br/>
How would we institute &quot;unschooling? &quot; Would it be through a<br/>
combination of parental responsibility and public schooling?<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t there have to be a minimum set skills that all students would<br/>
need to learn? For example, I can&#39;t think of any area of study that<br/>
does not require the ability to read. Wouldn&#39;t this facilitate the<br/>
need for a basic educational program?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-792092540">Brad quoted someone saying this:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Wouldn&#39;t there have to be a minimum set skills that all students would<br/>
&gt; need to learn? For example, I can&#39;t think of any area of study that<br/>
&gt; does not require the ability to read. Wouldn&#39;t this facilitate the<br/>
&gt; need for a basic educational program?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, if that were true then no one would learn ANYTHING until they<br/>
could read... which is nonsense. Maybe it would help him understand<br/>
unschooling better if you could encourage him to take a step back and<br/>
look at what people learn and ways of learning more broadly.  If he<br/>
can really see the learning and discovery in what kids do before they<br/>
are taught to read, he might be able to understand unschooling better.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that reading is amazingly useful as well as being fun, but<br/>
I don&#39;t think that my kids must be reading in order to have any other<br/>
learning happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132276738">The process of uncovering what the student really wants to study is exploration. I don&#39;t rest on my laurels waiting for Simon and Linnaea to approach me with what they want from the world, I offer stuff forward. I strew ideas, people, places, things. Our lives are filled with things I think will amuse. Sometimes they work, sometimes I get it so right that it fills them up for ages. Sometimes not so good. But that&#39;s just as much information as the successes are, even if less value for money. <br/>
<br/>
Reading is a tool, it isn&#39;t a prerequisite. Curiousity is a prerequisite. I can squash their curiousity by pushing things upon them that they aren&#39;t interested in. If, as Simon has said, they want to be marine biologists, I can talk about all the hurdles that I think they&#39;ll have to jump to make that happen. I can get a bunch of texts on marine biology, look into the pre-reqs of comparitive anatomy, make a day at the beach a study in shells and dead crab dissection. Or I can strew magazines and episodes on Discovery channel. I can get an aquarium and help them set it up with fish to watch and maybe breed. I can help keep them curious and interested, and allow that interest to wane without any dissapointment on my part that they won&#39;t be a marine biologist one day. They were the day we got an aquarium (we don&#39;t have one, that&#39;s supposition and hopefulness on my part). They were the day we snuggled up watching sharks kill seals on Animal Channel. They were<br/>
 when we found razor shells on the beach. <br/>
<br/>
Life is huge and knowledge is almost equally vast. How we experience marine biology can be with our shoes off, paddling about in the water, watching the jellyfish in the tide pool, trying to figure out how they move and sense, or it can be from books and lectures, or in so many other ways. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-58167985">This guy is still talking about Education, not learning and not living a <br/>
full life. Maybe if he stopped thinking of people as &quot;students&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
He is seeing learning as in service to education. I see learning as an <br/>
automatic and unavoidable function of the human brain.<br/>
<br/>
He is seeing learning as the first step towards doing, rather than a totally <br/>
intertwined process of the doing.<br/>
<br/>
He is seeing education as end product oriented. I think of unschooling as <br/>
truly vocational because Jayn&#39;s life is all about *doing* her stuff, right <br/>
now and today. Even what might look like learning for it&#39;s own sake - Jayn <br/>
spending time on the internet looking at vintage Barbie dolls for example - <br/>
it isn&#39;t about wanting to learn or know about Barbies for her. That <br/>
knowledge and learning is a side effect of her *appreciating* the beauty of <br/>
the things.<br/>
<br/>
He thinks people need to be motivated to learn. My daughter doesn&#39;t, but if <br/>
someone wanted her to demonstrate her learning in a schooly way, that might <br/>
take some tough motivating.<br/>
<br/>
I never worry about Jayn&#39;s learning, because it is automatic. I don&#39;t expect <br/>
her to be a happy end product. I try to find ways to allow her joy to flower <br/>
today.<br/>
<br/>
I never consider discovering Jayn&#39;s interests as an unsolved mystery because <br/>
her interests are right out there in her daily conversation and life and <br/>
activities. Plus as Schuyler mentioned we do a lot of strewing. Perhaps if <br/>
Jayn were trapped in a school room, even a kitchen table school room, her <br/>
interests would not be visible and obvious, but drowned in a sea of <br/>
irrelevant school static, and would need ferretting out.<br/>
<br/>
Does this person have any kids? If he is genuinely interested in <br/>
unschooling, why not save yourself a world of fuss and just direct him to <br/>
Sandra&#39;s site?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-242774501">One way to look at things differently is to imagine the world existing and<br/>
functioning outside the existence of books.  Once upon a time, that was the<br/>
case.  And it&#39;s doubtful that it was a sorry sad place to inhabit due to the<br/>
lack of books, though some may believe that it was.<br/>
<br/>
Those who are readers may feel that not only do books exist but also are a<br/>
marvel in themselves and can create worlds of imagination to immerse in as<br/>
well as describe the world we live in and the things in it, how they look,<br/>
how they work and so on.  But books, and other print materials, don&#39;t make<br/>
the world to exist or operate.  They are a part of the world, and can show<br/>
us all manner of things about the world.<br/>
<br/>
Primarily though, the world itself helps us learn about it, many times in<br/>
important very different ways than learning from books.  Imagine a doctor<br/>
whose means for learning about surgery were *only* from books *without*<br/>
experiencing surgery in the real world.  I prefer the doctor who has learned<br/>
from many avenues of experience, including books, and I&#39;m thinking that a<br/>
great many of us do too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How would we institute &quot;unschooling? &quot; Would it be through a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>combination of parental responsibility and public schooling? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Instituting &quot;unschooling&quot; would be superfluous since it&#39;s already the<br/>
natural way for anybody to learn, for instance when babies learn to talk and<br/>
walk.  It has been instituted already by nature.  It would not be through<br/>
parental responsibility or public schooling, both of which exist already<br/>
also, and for other purposes.  True, parents can enrich a child&#39;s<br/>
educational possibilities through choosing options that widen the range of<br/>
learning opportunities or ruin a child&#39;s educational possibilities by<br/>
limiting such options.  In unschooling, parents are the facilitators of<br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
It would seem that someone is ruining a child&#39;s education by not enforcing<br/>
early learning of how to read but see the above.  Children are learning<br/>
already by observing the way the world works.  Reading adds to learning in<br/>
many ways.  For children, those ways are not their ways but someone else&#39;s<br/>
ways.  That&#39;s an automatic problem with reading.  Someone else has the<br/>
conclusion and once the child reads it, that conclusion is, at least in the<br/>
early days of reading, supposed to then belong to the child.<br/>
<br/>
Contrast reading to simple observation, which enables children to learn in<br/>
their own ways and to create knowledge for themselves through experience.<br/>
For instance, Karl noticed something after licking the lid of a yogurt<br/>
containers and said &quot;All things become new ... (big pause) ... when you<br/>
clean &#39;em.&quot;  I didn&#39;t seize the learning moment and say, as I could have,<br/>
that yes we recycle things by cleaning them and getting them ready for<br/>
reuse.  To me, the important thing about that learning moment is that Karl<br/>
knows he can create knowledge from experience just like he knows how to<br/>
breathe, and he does it without thinking about how to learn.  Learning just<br/>
happens.  The kid who goes to school and is sat in front of the printed word<br/>
day after day as a matter of course may not ever come to know learning like<br/>
that, even though it &quot;just happens&quot; for that kid too.  A great many kids<br/>
don&#39;t have the same confidence as Karl has in his own ability to learn and<br/>
to think what he thinks.  Many children who are made to read first before<br/>
they can tackle real learning are convinced instead that they must be shown<br/>
how and what to learn.<br/>

<br/>
I like Bertrand Russell on this point: education, he said, required<br/>
opportunity, inclination, and leisure. In the USA, we&#39;ve got a lot<br/>
of #1, little of #2, and we deny the validity of #3.<br/>
<br/>
There are reliable studies that compare the results of forced<br/>
schooling and less-forced?<br/>
<br/>
Serendipitously, yes. Japan&#39;s public schools are highly regimented.<br/>
The method of lecture-recitation, which generally has been discarded<br/>
and derided in the USA, is Japan&#39;s norm. Teachers in Japan are given<br/>
only four hours in-class daily so that they may devote more time to<br/>
preparation and grading. Japanese students have longer school days<br/>
and school years, and parents often supplement the public education<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491526623">The main difference between the KIPP curriculum and so-called <br/>
KIPP-style learning is that KIPP removes a lot of the pressures of <br/>
memorizing by using mnemonics. It comes down to rote-learning and <br/>
does this really serve a child later in life? I&#39;d much rather have my <br/>
children using good research methods than to remember how many <br/>
Chinese dynasties there are. If you know how to look up information, <br/>
you&#39;ll never be without answers.<br/>
<br/>
As for the last paragraph, I wholeheartedly agree with it. It&#39;s <br/>
always the &quot;less educated&quot; that get appointed in the lower grade..as <br/>
though children at that age don&#39;t deserve the best.<br/>

<br/>
Why is that?  That seems to say that people can do their own learning once<br/>
they reach a certain age but not when they&#39;re young.  And yet brain capacity<br/>
to absorb new information is traditionally thought to be much less once a<br/>
person gets past the really young ages.<br/>
<br/>
The question of origin might look a lot like this &quot;which comes first... the<br/>
egg or the chicken?&quot;  Does the knowledge come before the learner or the<br/>
other way around?  Trick question the second time around: they&#39;re existence<br/>
depends on one another and both appear at the same time.  The synchronistic<br/>
nature of learning and the learner is a key point of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth looking more closely at studies to consider why and how they come<br/>
up with the results they do.  Some studies are so much more biased than<br/>
others, and with reason: most hypotheses are biased to some degree to begin<br/>
with or they&#39;re based on a premise that is biased.<br/>

<br/>
I just clicked on their latest publication <br/>
Overschooled but Undereducated: Society&#39;s Failure to Understand Adolescence by<br/>
John Abbott with Heather MacTaggart : Pre-production edition June 2008  (presently in draft) and came across this quote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;By misunderstanding teenagers&#39; instinctive need to do things for themselves, isn&#39;t society in danger of creating a system of schooling that so goes against the natural grain of the adolescent brain that formal education ends up trivialising the very young people it claims to be supporting?&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-584179269">When we lived in Kyoto we were near a school. Every morning you&#39;d see kids in little white uniforms, with short trousers, and baseball caps walking to the school. It was essential that they weren&#39;t alone. A child alone was a child who was targeted. I stepped in once when a kid at a park we used to go to was harrassing a younger boy for his Pokemon cards. The bigger was pushing him and taking the cards out of his bike basket. David went to high school in Tokyo. He went to an international school there. Many of the other students were Japanese but couldn&#39;t get by in the Japanese schools because of bullying, often because they were second generation Korean of some other non-Japanese descent. Difference is really discouraged in Japan. <br/>
<br/>
Whatever Japan advertises about the success of it&#39;s school system, there is a lot of damage being done within those walls. David organised a conference while he was working in Japan, it was on what we can find out about mating patterns in prehistoric populations. One of the people he invited to speak is a professor at St. Andrews, he&#39;s the head of the Perception Lab there, oh, you can see his picture at : <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://psy.st-andrews.ac.uk/people/lect/dp.shtml,">http://psy.st-andrews.ac.uk/people/lect/dp.shtml,</a> which is relevant. He has multi-coloured hair. He told me that he used to just dye it one colour but he&#39;d run through all the colours so he was moving through 2 colours to see how long he could go without duplication. He figured he&#39;d be on three at some point in the nearish future. I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s at 3 yet. Anyhow, his appearance really pissed off the Japanese at the conference. They wouldn&#39;t listen to him. He couldn&#39;t possibly have anything valuable to offer if he had such a radically different<br/>
 appearance. David walked with him in downtown Kyoto one night and he turned heads everywhere he went. Difference is not something to aspire to, or to even just be. If you are different in any remarkable way life is not going to be easy for you in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
One last point about Japan. We lived in these lovely apartments on the campus of the Nichibunken (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/info/facility/house_e.html)">http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/info/facility/house_e.html)</a> where all the foreign faculty were housed. I can remember taking a cab with one of our neighbors and listening to him criticize the intractibility of the Japanese. One of his examples, which has stayed with me, was that 99% of people accused of a crime are convicted of that crime in Japan. A quick search with google shows that in Toronto 76% of those accused of homicide were convicted of their crimes. <br/>

My favorite was a man dressed as a blue and white Geisha, he had tourists lining up to take their picture with him. Linnaea was 1 and toddling about and all the teen girls lined up to coo at her and flirt. Within the park was an area where homeless people lived in tents, or tarps staked out.

You are absolutely right about their bravery. There was a guy we always called tissue Punk, he had a mohawk and he passed out tissues (pocket-tissue packs are a big advertising venue because toilets often don&#39;t have toilet paper, so carrying tissues is important) on a main street corner in downtown Kyoto, who was so friendly and so smiley and so completely on the fringe. He thought it was hysterically funny, but worked really hard to look cool, when David took his picture. <br/>

Yes.  My dad calls it weeding out.  :/<br/>

&gt; I mentioned to David that you wrote this and he said &quot;Harajuku isn&#39;t the<br/>
&gt; same as it was, the government closed it down.&quot; We looked at wikipedia and<br/>
&gt; noticed that they opened the streets up to traffic in the 90s, effectively<br/>
&gt; closing down the area to teenagers displaying their oh-so-fantastic clothes.<br/>
