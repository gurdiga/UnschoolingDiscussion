<div id="ygrps-yiv-218400564">My 14yos was watching the Burns PBS show on the Civil War and made <br/>
this comment.  &quot;I know war is bad but this is so cool.&quot; You could <br/>
hear the conflict within himself.<br/>
  He loves swords. He loves D & D weapons, He came back from the <br/>
Starwars II and gave a complete play by play of the different sword <br/>
fights.  The Yoda fight took up the whole living room. Oh yeah he <br/>
does sound effects too.  He would love to take a class (&quot;real&quot; swords <br/>
not fencing) but is not ready to commit to the whole martial arts <br/>
classes which likely procede this.  He and siblings and the neighbor <br/>
kids had an elaborate wooden/plastic sword fight game meshed with D & <br/>
D going last night. It is way cool but beyond me.  He &quot;kills&quot; plenty <br/>
of people and is at heart very, very sensitive. <br/>

Oh yeah, we tried to avoid guns here at some point...<br/>
We still ended up with plenty of Water guns and the kids are getting <br/>
more Nerf ones for Xmas.</div>
