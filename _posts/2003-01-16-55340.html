<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Teeth that are straightened in childhood tend to stay aligned. Adult<br/>
&gt; bone has hardened, so braces are a longer process and more expensive,<br/>
&gt; and may not &quot;take.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had them twice, once as a child and once as an adult.  The bottom ones<br/>
didn&#39;t stay aligned either time.  And it was different orthodontists, so I<br/>
think it&#39;s likely just my teeth, not them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m bothered by seeing so many kids having braces so early.  I&#39;m not sure if<br/>
we&#39;ve learned that early intervention is so much better, or that the issue<br/>
can be forced on little kids whereas teens (like was done when we were kids)<br/>
are most self-consious and therefore harder to acquire as patients.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking out loud, I guess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656410771">I&#39;ve read that this is because if they start early, they can have braces <br/>
for many more years, thus making it much more profitable. Of course, <br/>
this was from an anti-early-braces dentist, so of course it&#39;s biased.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know, I kinda wondered if it might be related to that.  This is what<br/>
they want for my son.  I&#39;m against it.  But if there ever was a reason to do<br/>
it now, the army&#39;s deal is, if you start while you&#39;re in Europe or someplace<br/>
else where you go to an army dentist, not a civillian dentist, they pay for<br/>
the whole thing.  So it&#39;s slightly tempting financially.<br/>
<br/>
I hated my braces, both times I had them, though, so I&#39;m pretty much in<br/>
favor of putting it off for Tim until we absolutely have to (if ever!).<br/>
