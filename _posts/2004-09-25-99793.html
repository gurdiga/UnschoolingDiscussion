<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260910478">A couple of weeks ago, in a discussion about rules and manners I made the<br/>
following statement: <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Firstly, we don&#39;t have rules, at least we don&#39;t ever express our requests<br/>
to Jayn in those terms. I guess we have a few &quot;habitual behaviors&quot; that we<br/>
pretty much always ask of Jayn, such as to wait for one of us to go down to<br/>
the pool with her, even if there is someone already swimming. Speaking to<br/>
other visitors to our home in terms of &quot;our house rules&quot; would feel<br/>
hypocritical to me, even though I am sure that other kids have a greater<br/>
understanding of what the word means than Jayn does. I usually say more like<br/>
&quot;I prefer you to....&quot; or &quot;That could be dangerous/disturbing to someone...&quot;<br/>
or &quot;Those things are not available today&quot; (for some toy that is put up).&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is where I am now, in September. However I had a feeling that this<br/>
issue had been discussed before and I started searching my own archives.<br/>
Sure enough I found a post from March of this year, where I made the<br/>
following statement:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am not above using the fact that other children are rule-bound and<br/>
brainwashed by saying something along the lines of &quot;respecting the house<br/>
rules&quot; - even though we don&#39;t actually have any! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A whole different state of mind, and way of communicating with others.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It is amazing to me that just six months of rigorous discussion and debate,<br/>
and the fine example of others before me, can make such a difference to my<br/>
attitude about an issue � and my courage in openly living Unschooling<br/>
principles. Finding courage in the face of the overwhelming disapproval from<br/>
others, even strangers, is a crucial journey for me. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hope I always keep moving in the direction of more integrity, more<br/>
self-knowledge, and greater self-awareness in the peeling the onion kind of<br/>
way. I feel like my current attitude is modeling honesty for Jayn, rather<br/>
than expediency or manipulation. Once again the importance of changing our<br/>
words to change our thinking is reinforced.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Robyn, I totally agree with this.  Unschooling and these lists have <br/>
helped me immensely to become a better parent.  <br/>
<br/>
The other night we watched that Dr Phil family show that was on at <br/>
night.  Now, I never liked Dr Phil, but we watched it because I <br/>
wanted to hear what he was going to say about different issues in <br/>
the family.  I was on the polar opposite side of most of the things <br/>
he had to say, so that made great discussion for me and the kids.  <br/>
For example, there was a woman with a 4-yo daughter.  The woman <br/>
bought her daughter everything she saw and the daughter would throw <br/>
temper tantrums and even bite her if she didn&#39;t buy it.  Dr Phil <br/>
told her to take 99% of the toys away from the little girl and throw <br/>
them away or give them away and let her know the other 1% could go <br/>
to if she didn&#39;t behave.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids and I discussed how that could make the little girl feel <br/>
scared and unsure about her life and how we thought the mom could <br/>
help the girl in a nicer way.  Millions of people watched that show <br/>
and are thinking that if Dr Phil said it, then it must be true.  My <br/>
15-yo son said to me, &quot;Mom, you&#39;re so much better than him at <br/>
this.&quot;  So I told him, that&#39;s what I do when I go to my message <br/>
boards every day.  We discuss stuff like that and what to do about <br/>
it.  That&#39;s how we come up with better ideas than Dr Phil.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-815725195">These two posts from Robyn and Crystal got me thinking about what I get <br/>
from reading the unschooling list and boards. I&#39;m not getting courage <br/>
from the rigorous discussion and debate and fine example - I somehow <br/>
was born with that (I mean, that KIND of courage, to openly live how I <br/>
want - I don&#39;t seem to care too much about approval of others).<br/>
<br/>
BUT - I get something else - several something else&#39;s. I get ideas, <br/>
mostly. Ideas I&#39;d have never come up with on my own in a lifetime.  And <br/>
I get challenged in my thinking, I get pushed and prodded to seriously <br/>
consider ideas that, at first, I tend to dismiss. Can&#39;t do that here. <br/>
Those ideas I dismiss are the ones that keep coming back up here and <br/>
banging me on the head - think about me, think about me &lt;G&gt;. And I get <br/>
encouragement - a LOT of that - by knowing that there are so many moms <br/>
(mostly) out there willing and really eager to think hard about <br/>
alternative ways of raising our kids, peaceful ways - it encourages me <br/>
to think that the world might not be going to hell in a handbasket, <br/>
after all. And, I get energized to make changes in my own life - I am <br/>
very very much a person who needs a group to &quot;do things with,&quot; I don&#39;t <br/>
do well in doing anything at all on my own, without interaction. The <br/>
interaction here is immensely important to me, to feel part of this <br/>
&quot;group&quot; of thinking, brave, peace-loving parents is a big part of my <br/>
identity -- if you read Frank Smith, it is his idea of identity that <br/>
I&#39;m talking about. Being part of this group has a big influence on my <br/>
own ability to learn - just like Frank Smith talks about kids <br/>
identifying with being a &quot;math learner&quot; or &quot;reader,&quot; etc. (If you <br/>
haven&#39;t read Frank Smith&#39;s &quot;The Book of Learning and Forgetting,&quot; I <br/>
highly recommend it.)<br/>
<br/>
Another thing this list is for me is a gift from all of you - I simply <br/>
ENJOY hearing about your lives with your children. Call me a voyeur, <br/>
but I find it endlessly fascinating - FAR more interesting than any <br/>
sitcom or drama show on TV.<br/>

I agree wholeheartedly!  The last couple of years have been full of personal<br/>
thought and growth for me.  I am always discussing and debating posts and<br/>
formulating replies in my head ... while in the shower, doing the vacuuming,<br/>
the dishes and so on ... even when I don&#39;t get a chance to post them.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago I even had the courage to send one of my articles to my SIL!<br/>
Of course I had to snail mail it, since she hates computers (and all the<br/>
time her husband and son spend on them), but I included my website address<br/>
just in case she found some courage and wanted to read some more.  :-)<br/>
Haven&#39;t heard from her yet ....  LOL!<br/>

<br/>
I do.  I get courage in a round about way.<br/>
<br/>
In a conversation in Peabody last month, I told someone if everyone I knew <br/>
changed their minds and stopped unschooling I would still keep doing what I&#39;m <br/>
doing.   But the courage I get is to be more openly radical and to *know* that <br/>
it is possible to help another family move closer to a really productive <br/>
unschooling life if they want the input.   <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I look at this page (which is too full for more additions, and I <br/>
hate to split it up) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/list">http://sandradodd.com/list</a><br/>
and I remember the days I first read some of those, and I remember the times <br/>
I&#39;ve met some of those moms and seen their kids.   It&#39;s fairly well <br/>
indescribable.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Productive&quot; in &quot;productive unschooling life&quot; I think means (as I used it <br/>
above, anyway, as I was thinking it) that it produces confidence, a feeling of <br/>
togetherness, learning on top of learning, and it begins to sustain itself on <br/>
past successes.  Once unschooling really gets going in a family, it&#39;s like a <br/>
siphon and the family no longer needs as much outside input as they might have <br/>
needed at first.   It proves itself once it&#39;s flowing.  The &quot;How will I know <br/>
that. . .&quot; and &quot;How can I tell if. . .&quot; questions start to fade away.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>YES. And, imagination plays a part in this, too. There are those people <br/>
who can imagine what unschooling could possibly be like and their <br/>
confidence comes from inside themselves, even before they&#39;ve see the <br/>
&quot;proof&quot; in their own or others&#39; kids. But, even then, I&#39;m sure, it <br/>
takes a bit of courage to go for something that only they can really <br/>
imagine &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
For me, I came to believe that unschooling was the way for us to go <br/>
because the people promoting it were the people I admired and respected <br/>
and wanted to be more like. So, for me, it was largely about the <br/>
unschooling parents, themselves, at the beginning - and then, as I met <br/>
them in person, it was about the kids and the families and the whole <br/>
atmosphere of focus and energy and trust and joy that they carried with <br/>
them everywhere they went. I just always figured that they looked like <br/>
they were making the most out of life - and that&#39;s what I wanted.<br/>

===============<br/>
<br/>
My Sam (4) has a very similar reaction to HFCS, CS, dextrose--pretty much any form. While we were doing the elimination diet trying to figure all this out, we talked a lot about allergies and paying attention to our body and the signals it sends us. <br/>
<br/>
At home, I&#39;ve pretty much just eliminated all foods that contain CS. For the past several months, we&#39;ve been sampling and finding substitute foods that taste good and satisfy. We&#39;ve found really good brands of most everything we eat: cheddar crackers, crackers, graham crackers, popscicles, sorbet, yogurt, ice cream cones, etc. I just buy Breyer&#39;s Ice Cream instead of other brands, ghirardelli chocolate, organic vanilla extract (yup, it&#39;s in that too!), that kind of thing. We make lots of chocolate chip cookies, chocolate chip pancakes. For us, it&#39;s a matter of having all the same kid kind of things in the house that don&#39;t have CS. Sam never misses anything while he&#39;s at home and has free choice of foods in much the same way that other unschooled kids do--his choices just don&#39;t have CS in them.<br/>
<br/>
The hard part is when we&#39;re out because absolutely everything has CS in it. Pretty much we just deal with it. If we&#39;re going someplace where I can bring food, we do--like the park or someplace where everyone&#39;s picnicing. When we visit my in-laws, I&#39;ll bring stuff with us, which at least cuts down some on the amount of CS he ingests. But, when we&#39;re on vacation and eating out a lot, there&#39;s very little we can do. The up side of that is that it reinforces for Sam how crappy it makes him feel. <br/>
<br/>
So, I don&#39;t limit, per se, it&#39;s more of an even exchange. When we&#39;re out he&#39;s free to make the decision for himself in the same way that I&#39;ll decide I&#39;m going to eat that hot chili sauce despite the gastro-intestinal response and insomnia that inevitably follow.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

===========<br/>
<br/>
The advice is more against not making arbitrary rules than about providing <br/>
them all the food on the planet.<br/>
<br/>
There are problems with forcing food and with limiting it.<br/>
There are problems with &quot;paying&quot; kids to eat (bu giving them more and happier <br/>
food after they eat vegetables and meat).<br/>
<br/>
The ultimate extension of the idea that kids should decide whether they&#39;re <br/>
still hungry and eat when they&#39;re hungry is that ideally they can have free <br/>
choice and make good choices.<br/>
<br/>
When this grows out of on-demand breastfeeding, and giving solids when a <br/>
child reaches for them, basically, it&#39;s easy to get there gradually.  I know it&#39;s <br/>
hard for people to move from a more controlling and scheduled food-life to <br/>
something involving choices, and it&#39;s not a necessary part of unschooling either.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid&#39;s allergic to something though, that just not going to be one of the <br/>
choices he has, right?  And some people grow out of allergies, so in some <br/>
cases it&#39;s worth checking sometimes to see if it&#39;s still a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something about the parenting considerations:<br/>

Thanks for the response.  And it seems like I am already doing most <br/>
of the stuff suggested. It&#39;s just sometimes I feel like a food cop <br/>
with the high fructose corn syrup. It&#39;s in so  many things and we <br/>
have to read all the labels. We try to find alternatives that the <br/>
kids enjoy for the things they can&#39;t have. (things that are kosher <br/>
for passover don&#39;t have the HFCS, and neither does anything that is <br/>
organic, or stuff that we make ourselves.) I grew up with huge <br/>
control issues, and of course food was part of that. I don&#39;t want to <br/>
do that with my kids. But because of the sensativities, we have to be <br/>
really careful. I&#39;m honest with the kids, they know why we avoid the <br/>
stuff. At the store, they are each allowed to pick out one thing that <br/>
they want to get. the only restrictions on that item is, it can&#39;t <br/>
have HFCS or straight dairy in it.   They surprise me with the <br/>
choices they make. Some days it&#39;s stuff I&#39;d expect, cookies or junk, <br/>
but others it&#39;s bananas or strawberries or a new kind of bread or <br/>
something else that actually would be something that I&#39;d encourage <br/>
them to eat more of. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-657554958">** It&#39;s just sometimes I feel like a food cop<br/>
with the high fructose corn syrup. It&#39;s in so  many things and we<br/>
have to read all the labels. We try to find alternatives that the<br/>
kids enjoy for the things they can&#39;t have. (things that are kosher<br/>
for passover don&#39;t have the HFCS, and neither does anything that is<br/>
organic, or stuff that we make ourselves.)**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
According to the latest issue of Utne Reader, regulations in labeling <br/>
organic food have been relaxed recently to the point that there IS such <br/>
a thing as &quot;organic high-fructose corn syrup&quot;, even though high-fructose <br/>
corn syrup is artificially created.  Now, well known health food <br/>
manufacturers are probably not going to start putting it in their <br/>
products, but I don&#39;t think you can reliably rely on the word &quot;organic&quot; <br/>
to mean that a product does not contain the high fructose syrup.  Sorry.<br/>

<br/>
PS  I&#39;ve read some stuff in my local newspaper theorizing that high <br/>
fructose corn syrup may be the major contributing factor to rising rates <br/>
of diabetes in populations that eat the &quot;American&quot; diet.  So avoiding it <br/>
as much as you can may have double the health benefits that you <br/>
expect.   Anyway, I love paranoid theories, and this one makes a lot of <br/>
sense to me even though it hasn&#39;t been empirically proved.</div>

Don&#39;t you pretty much have to avoid the entire center section of the  grocery <br/>
store?  :)<br/>

When my husband was on the Atkins Diet (lost 50 pounds last year and it&#39;s  <br/>
still off), my weekly shopping consisted of the produce, dairy and meat  <br/>
sections, and that was it.  I began to realize that I could live without  ever going <br/>
into the center sections of the store, just shopping the walls.<br/>
 <br/>
Light bulb moment, there.  ;)<br/>

*rofl* Yeah, at the regular store. That whole wall of cereal is off limits. CS is in everything, and I mean everything. <br/>
<br/>
Whole Foods has tons of stuff without it, though, which is great. The first couple of months were incredibly painful because I had to read *every* label. We&#39;ve found lots of bad substitutes and, after a lot of trial, a couple really good substitutes. Now, we can have everything in the house we used to have but without the CS and without all the major meltdowns, which makes for a much more peaceful and joyful home for everyone because we&#39;re not all walking on eggshells waiting for something to set him off.<br/>

What brand of graham crackers?? I&#39;ve been looking everywhere.... and <br/>
I use mexican vanilla. It doesn&#39;t have it in it. I&#39;ve learned that <br/>
things made outside the US are less likely to have the CS and HFCS in <br/>
them than the foods made in the US. In Europe it&#39;s not considered fit <br/>
for human consumption.<br/>
