<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064030684">Valerie, and any others?<br/>
<br/>
I am sometimes in Gig Harbor visiting my mom.  Is there any kind of<br/>
organized unschooling group in Tacoma?  I&#39;d love to join you sometime if<br/>
there is!<br/>
<br/>
And while I&#39;m asking, is anyone on this list in the Tri-Cities?  I&#39;m<br/>
really feeling the need lately for some one on one time with other<br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

***&quot;Organized unschooling group&quot;? &lt;gales of laughter&gt; Mary Ellen, I&#39;m afraid<br/>
*this* is the only kind of unschooling group I have...here on line. It would<br/>
be fun to get together, though. Perhaps you and I could offer (on-line) to<br/>
host an unschooling picnic sometime?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m driving through Gig Harbor tomorrow, as a matter of fact. :)<br/>
