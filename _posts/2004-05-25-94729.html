<div id="ygrps-yiv-90673995">Here&#39;s a cheap flooring idea I read about.<br/>
Cut some brown paper bags open flat. Glue them to the floor. Spread polyurethane over top. Might need two coats. Supposedly looks really cool. I&#39;d try it on scrap wood first to see if I like it.<br/>

I did that with my walls in two of my bathrooms. I crumpled the bags up <br/>
first, then pasted them on with wallpaper paste. Then painted; no polyurethane. <br/>
It&#39;s an interesting look!<br/>

My head is spinning with all these cool floor ideas!  We built our house and <br/>
recently added on, then ran out of money before the floor got finished.  Hubby <br/>
and I have really been re-evaluating &quot;things&quot; and needs for nice stuff (we <br/>
ran out of money before we got cupboards  and more counters in the kitchen too) <br/>
and have decided we&#39;d rather make due with what we have and not stress.  I <br/>
have tons of scrap material, so I think we&#39;ll take the scrap wood and build <br/>
shelves and hang curtains over them instead of cupboards.  Any ideas for counters?<br/>
