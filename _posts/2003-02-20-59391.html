<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741998666">I unsubscribed under my other email account <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:megamom08@...">megamom08@...</a> and subbed <br/>
under this one. I am Ang and used to post on here frequently at one time. <br/>
Trying to get more involved and keep up again &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, the metal pans from our easy bake oven disappeared. It would take 6 <br/>
weeks to get replacement ones, or to find ours LOL<br/>
<br/>
Anything I can use instead? Will pie tins (pot-pie size) work? Yesterday I <br/>
just let 10yo Megan use the toaster oven instead to bake her little cookies. <br/>
It was nice to see my girls (3 and 10) work together and not <br/>
quarrel......this cabin fever in SNO-hio has been getting to us..... <br/>

I can&#39;t think of any reason why not.  It&#39;s just a light bulb, after all<br/>
:0).  I would think anything that won&#39;t melt, can fit in the slot, and<br/>
is easy to push in and get out would be fine. ~Rue<br/>

Here in Sn&#39;Ohio, and Sn&#39;Ice-hio, too.  Took Dh three hours to get out <br/>
of our driveway today due to sheer black ice.  When Dd was younger I <br/>
used to find nice little glass or metal baking pans at a favorite <br/>
thrift store or at yard sales for Dd&#39;s oven.  Specialty type kitchen <br/>
shops have nice little fluted glass, porcelain or metal baking <br/>
dishes, too, for individual size baking.  Call around and see what <br/>
you can find, or scout the thrift stores in your area.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675287133">Just a thought, what if you used a canning jar lid lined<br/>
with aluminum foil?<br/>
I would use try to use a tad bit of kitchen spray.<br/>
And I would oversee the project with your child.<br/>
