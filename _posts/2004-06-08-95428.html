<br/>
I was going to post about this, so thanks for the lovely segue Kelly! ;)<br/>
<br/>
After the recent thread here on 4-H, I explored it more and have just<br/>
finished the leader application process. (I had looked into Scouts several<br/>
months ago, and ended up letting that drop because it seemed so rigid.) Now,<br/>
I&#39;m in the process of putting together a homeschool 4-H club that will meet<br/>
just a few times a year and will, hopefully, spin off several smaller<br/>
project clubs.<br/>
<br/>
My question to all you 4-Hers out there is how do you keep the meetings<br/>
unschooling friendly? My concerns are maintaining an atmosphere that&#39;s light<br/>
and relatively non-competative (yes, I know 4-H promotes competition),<br/>
keeping it age-inclusive and keeping it flexibible enough to work for the<br/>
kids but structured enough to hold together. Have people had success with<br/>
these kinds of things?  4-H is pushing their Clover (ages 5-7) curriculum on<br/>
me (which I will smile and take then put in some dark place until I return<br/>
it with gratitude) because my kids are 6, 5 and 4 and I will be including a<br/>
Clover group in our Community Club. I want to incorporate the Clovers in the<br/>
project clubs themselves, and I&#39;m hoping to minimize the age categories as<br/>
much as possible. Are these realistic goals, and how have the unschooling<br/>
4-Hers approached these issues in their own clubs?<br/>
<br/>
Just fyi: as of now, we&#39;ll be offering an Heirloom Poultry club, a Rock<br/>
Hounds climbing club and a Gardening for Life club.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-625650247">Our club is more 4-H friendly in that I am adamant that the kids run the<br/>
club.  To be a 4-H club, they do need to follow certain guidelines, like<br/>
number of meetings per year, taking attendance, doing a community service<br/>
project, etc..<br/>
<br/>
But the kids decide what project they want to do, get it organized, then<br/>
fill me in on the details (I&#39;m the leader).  No one is required to do much<br/>
of anything but there are certain requirements that are expected to be met<br/>
for certain activities.  Example:  To be an officer, you are expected to<br/>
attend a leadership camp and complete a record book.  Doesn&#39;t mean you get<br/>
kicked off for not doing it, just that it is expected.<br/>
<br/>
The trouble we had with the very younger kids and the older kids mixed<br/>
together is that the younger kids would get bored and want to do something<br/>
else before the big kids were or that the big kids wanted to do things at a<br/>
deeper level than the younger kids.<br/>
<br/>
Our clover kids has no curriculum.  Any younger kid that doesn&#39;t want to do<br/>
the main meeting can go in the gym with alternating moms and do some sort of<br/>
activity...or just play.<br/>

Okay, see, here&#39;s where it&#39;s all confusing to me. Would those not be<br/>
&quot;Project Clubs&quot; then? They don&#39;t need to be that formal, is that it? Do the<br/>
project leaders need to be 4-H project leaders, or do the moms/dads just<br/>
informally step up within the umbrella of the Orange Villa Buckeroo Club?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be so dense--these are the logistics that I&#39;m trying to figure out,<br/>
and the folks here don&#39;t seem to be that clear on it themselves. In 4-H<br/>
lingo, there are Community Clubs, Project Clubs, School Clubs. So, I&#39;m<br/>
figuring if we have a Community Club that offers several Projects within it<br/>
that would offer lots of opportunities for the homeschooling community. It<br/>
sounds like you&#39;re saying I can do that without creating a special &quot;Project<br/>
Club&quot; for each project, correct? That would certainly be much easier!<br/>

<br/>
Ignore &quot;School Clubs&quot; - that&#39;s their new thing of running after-school <br/>
4H program - it is doing 4H stuff, but in a daycare situation.<br/>
<br/>
Normal situation --<br/>
Community Club is started - it has bylaws, officers.<br/>
People/parents offer to lead projects - these are projects of that <br/>
Community Club. Photography, sheep, quilting, whatever.....<br/>
<br/>
The Community Club does SOME things as a whole club - some community <br/>
service, usually. They normally have a business meeting once a month. <br/>
Kids run it with help from adult club advisor. It may or may not <br/>
involve more than just club business - might have a speaker or play <br/>
some games or do some community service project or practice demos.<br/>
<br/>
You might have ALL club kids involved in one project and only a couple <br/>
of club kids involved in another project. Some kids might be in ALL <br/>
projects, some might be only in one project.<br/>
<br/>
Projects are not normally called &quot;Project Clubs&quot; - they&#39;re usually <br/>
called, &quot;the Horse Project&quot; or &quot;the Arts and Crafts project.&quot; But it <br/>
does happen that the terminology gets used - especially if there are a <br/>
lot of kids in a project, some people will call it the &quot;horse club.&quot; I <br/>
don&#39;t think that it is ever, technically, a &quot;club&quot; unless you split off <br/>
from the original club and have your own separate name and bylaws and <br/>
officers.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t be in more than one &quot;club,&quot; but you can be in as many <br/>
projects as you want.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the county offers projects that aren&#39;t under any club.<br/>
You can join projects offered by clubs other than your own club, if <br/>
they have room for you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-595078028">&lt;&lt;&lt; Would those not be<br/>
&quot;Project Clubs&quot; then?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, a project club is usually a project that has gotten so big that they<br/>
need more organization.<br/>
<br/>
A community club is made up of people who live close to each other (usually)<br/>
and may have many, many projects associated with it. Projects are very<br/>
loosely organized (usually) with simply a parent, teen or other adult<br/>
stepping up to say they are interested in leading a project about something<br/>
that interests them or their child.<br/>
<br/>
A project club functions like a community club but everyone in the club does<br/>
the same project.<br/>
<br/>
Our county has 15 4-H clubs.  Many of them are community clubs.  My kids are<br/>
in a community club because most of the members are friends of theirs and<br/>
they feel very confident taking leadership roles.  They usually do a couple<br/>
of projects associated with that club, like sewing or ballistics.<br/>
<br/>
Zach is also in a project club for shooting skeet and Adriane is in a<br/>
project club for raising goats.  This is where they get very in-depth,<br/>
intensive learning about the project they are passionate about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102854861"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Community Club is started - it has bylaws, officers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was in 4-H (Ohio) for 10+ years. Our &quot;community&quot; club was called <br/>
the Ridge Kids.  Everyone was a member of this club (until now I <br/>
never heard the term community before, hence the italics).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; People/parents offer to lead projects - these are projects of that <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Community Club. Photography, sheep, quilting, whatever.....<br/>
<br/>
Ditto.  If there were a large number of kids taking certain projects, <br/>
parents would volunteer as &quot;project leaders&quot; and sometimes have <br/>
separate &quot;project meetings&quot; from the regular club meeting to <br/>
concentrate on just that project.  In our case, it was goats, and <br/>
then dogs.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The Community Club does SOME things as a whole club - some <br/>
 </span></blockquote>community service, usually. They normally have a business meeting <br/>
once a month.<br/>
<br/>
We (the kids) chose one project that everyone took as a group every <br/>
year, usually service related.  We worked on this group project at <br/>
business meetings, which were usually held twice a month in the <br/>
summer.  Less often in the fal/winter/spring.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kids run it with help from adult club advisor. It may or may not <br/>
 </span></blockquote>involve more than just club business - might have a speaker or play <br/>
some games or do some community service project or practice demos.<br/>
<br/>
Same here.  We would have  aspeaker or an activity of some sort at <br/>
business meetings, as well as the group project work (time to work on <br/>
books and get questions answered/help from leaders). <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You might have ALL club kids involved in one project and only a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>couple of club kids involved in another project. Some kids might be <br/>
in ALL projects, some might be only in one project.<br/>
<br/>
We had one group project that everyone took, then were free to decide <br/>
what others we wanted to take.  I usually took 3-5 projects a year, <br/>
including the group project.<br/>

officers, by-laws, etc..  It is just like a community club except <br/>
that it is organized around one project, like Rabbits or horses.<br/>
<br/>
I think that is the way it worked for our county too.  We were not <br/>
prohibited from joining more than one club.  There were many clubs <br/>
like mine, where kids took a variety of projects, and there were <br/>
also &quot;project&quot; clubs that specialized in only one project such as <br/>
dogs or rabbits (until now never heard the term &quot;project club&quot; <br/>
before -- we just said the rabbit club or the dog club.  These <br/>
specialized clubs were usually very large, and were made up of the <br/>
kids really focused on just one thing, and maybe didn&#39;t want to take <br/>
other projects (didn&#39;t have a need for &quot;community&quot; club).  <br/>
<br/>
Like I said, when we had quite a few kids (5+) taking one project with<br/>
(perhaps once a month)in our &quot;community club&quot; we had <br/>
separate &quot;project meetings&quot; from our regular business meetings.<br/>
<br/>
One year, after I had been a member of the Ridge Kids (&quot;community&quot; <br/>
club)for a long time, and had taken many different projects, I <br/>
decided I wanted to get really focused on horses.  There were not <br/>
many parents in my regular club that knew about horses, so I also <br/>
joined the Trailblazers Horse Club (&quot;project&quot; club).  I remained in <br/>
the Ridge Kids and took a few projects, including our group service <br/>
project, but went to the Trailblazers meetings for only horse <br/>
projects.  <br/>
<br/>
That year was not as fun...the Horse Club was too intense and <br/>
competitive for my liking. <br/>

<br/>
Thank you. This has been clarified to me now--first from the list, then,<br/>
finally last night at my local leader&#39;s meeting.<br/>
<br/>
I have one final question: the parents who step up to lead the projects<br/>
within the Community Club, are they official 4-H volunteers? Have they gone<br/>
through the volunteer application process, or do they just informally lead a<br/>
project that interests them? And if they aren&#39;t official volunteers, does an<br/>
official volunteer have to be present? My county 4-H person was saying that<br/>
anyone who works one-on-one with the kids needs to be an official 4-H<br/>
volunteer.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh but these are clubs.  They have officers, they have fundraisers, they<br/>
have business meetings.  They work exactly like a community club except that<br/>
it focuses on just one project.<br/>
<br/>
Around here, project clubs usually start as a project that is part of a<br/>
community club.  Claybusters club started out 4 years ago with 7 kids and a<br/>
few dads that wanted to compete with trap and skeet.  2 years ago, they had<br/>
about 20 kids and broke off from the community club, getting chartered by<br/>
4-H, electing officers etc..  Now they have over 45 kids shooting.  They are<br/>
a 4-H club that only does shooting sports.<br/>
<br/>
In our county, we also have the Rabbit club, Saddleslappers and the Caprine<br/>
club.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of kids who are in community clubs also do projects on rabbits, horses,<br/>
and goats but those clubs ONLY do those topics.<br/>

they will need a background check.  If you had to fill out a medical<br/>
history, they will have to fill out a medical history.  They are on the same<br/>

necessary here for volunteers to be &quot;official&quot; - which in our case <br/>
means spending a morning in a training program.<br/>
