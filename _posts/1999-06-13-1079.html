 </span></blockquote>I feel alot the same. This list has helped me tremendously. I have not<br/>
necesarily gotten support but i have gotten to hear differeing views and i<br/>
use those to push me and make myself think. Unschooling at the finest for<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
I have been watching what isaac does naturally and what he asks and i have<br/>
been amazed to see him ask to do division, cus he neeeded it for a game. we<br/>
have had discussions on philosophy and G-d and on the space time continuum.<br/>
That is along with checking how rafts float in a pool , how far he can leap<br/>
and how much of a wave he can make by doing a cannon ball.<br/>
<br/>
I think I was mind controlled by the school system. I didnt think it was<br/>
that bad, but it must have been. i think I am coming out of a fog.<br/>
<br/>
I am still scared adn unsure. does this feeling ever go away.would i feel<br/>
better if i used a log book so i could see what he is learning. and why the<br/>
hell do i have to see it to be comfortable.<br/>
