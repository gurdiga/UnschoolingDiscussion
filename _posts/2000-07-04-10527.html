<br/>
One thing that I have trouble with is apologies. When one of the kids has done<br/>
something that has hurt another, I talk to them about it, but don&#39;t &#39;make&#39;<br/>
them apologise. But so many others, dh included, demand apologies be made. My<br/>
way is to talk to the kid about what has happenned, listen to his story, and<br/>
if he *is* sorry for what he has done, encourage him to apologise - and<br/>
sometimes that means me going along too to hold a hand - apologising is not<br/>
easy. I don&#39;t &#39;make&#39; the other accept the apology either.<br/>
<br/>
I feel it is bad enough that some one has been hurt, without dishonest, false<br/>
apologies rubbing salt into the wound. And if someone is feeling so hurt they<br/>
can&#39;t accept the apology, then that is part of the consequences of one&#39;s<br/>
actions too.<br/>
<br/>
This attitude has not been popular with others though - esp. other  who demand<br/>
apologies, however insincere the apology might be! Personally, I think such<br/>
demands spring more from a wish to humiliate the &#39;hurter&#39;, rather than a wish<br/>
to mollify the &#39;hurtee&#39;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-792285389">I completely 100% agree with the posting below. My son is three years <br/>
old, has never been &quot;made&quot; to apologise or say &quot;please&quot; or &quot;thank <br/>
you&quot; for that matter either. And yet he spontaneously <br/>
says &quot;sorry&quot;, &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; and it feels soooo wonderful <br/>
to hear it when it comes out so spontaneously and sincerely. It gives <br/>
me goosebumps almost every time.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who haven&#39;t heard of Aletha Solter and her <br/>
books &quot;The Aware Baby&quot;, &quot;Helping Young Children Flourish&quot; and &quot;Tears <br/>
and Tantrums&quot;, I would highly recommend those. They can be found at <br/>
www.awareparenting.com as well as on amazon.com.<br/>

my step-daughter; I met her when she was five.)<br/>

This is so familiar, Carol.  I think there&#39;s a bit of <br/>
both humiliate and mollify, neither of which is <br/>
particularly beneficial to either party, IMO.  Simple <br/>
acceptance of feelings comes hard to so many people (me <br/>
included, except on my better days :-) )  There was an <br/>
article in the paper last week about sleep training <br/>
(Daily Telegraph, www.telegraph.co.uk , you have to <br/>
register to read files, but that&#39;s fairly painless) and <br/>
even though it was decrying the &#39;cry it out&#39; technique, <br/>
the &#39;method&#39; though it didn&#39;t say what age it was <br/>
talking about, didn&#39;t seem to respect either the baby&#39;s <br/>
need to be with his/her mother or the feelings of the <br/>
child, in not recognising that they don&#39;t want to sleep <br/>
alone or at such-and-such a time.  I ought to write a <br/>
rebuttal, don&#39;t you think? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;something that has hurt another, I talk to them about it, but don&#39;t &#39;make&#39;<br/>
&gt;them apologise. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We worked on apologies big time a few years back, and since then really<br/>
think about what we mean... the casual &#39;I&#39;m sorry&#39; is fairly meaningless in<br/>
society nowadays - more akin to &#39;it&#39;s not my fault&#39; more than anything else<br/>
- or &#39;I didn&#39;t mean it&#39; - which is definitely NOT an apology!<br/>
<br/>
I encourage empathy rather than &#39;sorry&#39; - &#39;how would you feel if that<br/>
happened to you&#39;. I talk about how I feel when it happens to me. This seems<br/>
to work. I especially work on my partner - I&#39;m very demanding on him to<br/>
examine this aspect of &#39;sorry&#39;. I think if I can get him to understand it<br/>
will be so much better for the children (learning by example, consistency<br/>
in parenting and all that stuff).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;easy. I don&#39;t &#39;make&#39; the other accept the apology either.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s real important. I don&#39;t ask for forgiveness, nor do I give it. Not<br/>
because I have to, or should. Just ackowledging that some harm has been<br/>
done and that there is regret is often the best start along that road.<br/>
Often we need time to move us away from the emotional storm before we can<br/>
start to heal.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;apologies, however insincere the apology might be! Personally, I think such<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, and it does make social situations very difficult. I think we have<br/>
tended to become isolationists with our children, so that we can instil in<br/>
them the values we need without a lot of interference from needing to<br/>
conform to group social pressures from well meaning friends and family.<br/>
This way when we do socialise the impact isn&#39;t so great to act differently<br/>
from our values. <br/>
