<div id="ygrps-yiv-664167234">I have two boys who are close in age and at various times fight a lot and<br/>
other times less.  The thing that helped me most when they were young is<br/>
difficult to achieve in a homeschooling environment.  What helped was having<br/>
one on one time with each child.  At that stage I had my children in<br/>
preschool so I put them in on a different day.  Made such a difference.  I<br/>
have tried to have one child go on a play date and the other stay with me<br/>
but being close in age that is difficult.  If you can work out a way to<br/>
accomplish this I would recommend it.<br/>
In the short term - I find separating them works well.  If they fight they<br/>
go to different areas of the house and when they are ready to play together<br/>
cooperatively they can be together.<br/>
In general, I find the more I can stay out of the disputes the better.<br/>
I have also found it helpful to try to step in before they fight but when I<br/>
see the play becoming boring or changing.  Its been good to start some floor<br/>
play - playful wrestling, tickling at this time and it seems to give them<br/>
positive attention and helps with transitions.  This isn&#39;t easy to do but<br/>
works very well.  It also reduces the interruptions to my activities.  I can<br/>
spend a few minutes pro-actively or be irritated with them later.<br/>
When I intervene successfully in a dispute it has been because I haven&#39;t<br/>
taken sides.  I haven&#39;t done this in a while but it worked well - I would<br/>
intervene and just hold each of the boys - one arm each and be quiet until<br/>
they settled.  Harder to get them to sit now they are older - often one<br/>
removes themselves.  When/If they quiet and each give their version they<br/>
usually work it out themselves.  I often tell them that I will take the toy<br/>
or game away from them if they can&#39;t work it out - it puts them on the same<br/>
side against me.  They nearly always figure a way out.<br/>
The rest of the time I take heart in the research that shows that siblings<br/>
learn a lot about getting along with people and working out who they are<br/>
based on their interactions with children.<br/>
I also like the book, &quot;Siblings without rivalry&quot;.  Good luck.<br/>
