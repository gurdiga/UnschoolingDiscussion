Library as School<br/>
by Ned Vare<br/>
<br/>
Years ago, John Holt talked about the difference between libraries and<br/>
public schools -- both government-run. He described the difference as<br/>
largely centered on the attitude of the employees. In libraries, the<br/>
attitude is ALWAYS, &quot;How can I help you?&quot; There is an understanding that the<br/>
patron is seeking information, and the purpose of the employee is to help<br/>
the patron find it. No questions asked. No mention of the patron being too<br/>
young or not being dressed properly; no discussion about the appropriateness<br/>
of the information or the &quot;readiness&quot; of the patron to learn it; no mention<br/>
of testing or judging, no timetables, no hall passes, no arbitrary rules, no<br/>
need to ask permission to go pee. The library attitude is benevolence and<br/>
service.<br/>
<br/>
Public schools, of course, do all those impertinent things, and worse. Their<br/>
attitude is, &quot;Sit down and shut up, What can you do that I can judge? How<br/>
can I impose my will on you? How can I control your life? How can you fit<br/>
into OUR plan?Â² This may not be the attitude of every employee, but it is<br/>
definitely the attitude of the institution and its unions, and that&#39;s what<br/>
matters.<br/>
<br/>
For a public school to be more like a library would mean big changes, such<br/>
as: eliminate curriculula; eliminate groupings based on age, eliminate<br/>
grading, scoring, testing, sorting of patrons; eliminate most rules,<br/>
schedules, timetables; eliminate certification of teachers (let anyone who<br/>
can, teach -- it&#39;s the learner&#39;s choice) and keep only teachers whose<br/>
services are in demand by patrons; eliminate most administrators and other<br/>
non-teaching personnel such as psychologists, &quot;deans,&quot; coordinators,<br/>
lunchroom monitors, police guards, and therapists. Let sports be handled by<br/>
another organization, and paid for by its patrons.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, whether they&#39;re homeschooling or not, children are welcome at<br/>
public libraries, where they learn how to use the catalog, the<br/>
computers, the restroom, the services of the friendly respectful<br/>
courteous employees and, smiling happily, go about their learning in their<br/>
own ways. What would turn such a facility into a &quot;school&quot; would simply be to<br/>
have teacher/guides available to offer the public of all ages their services<br/>
as facilitators in whatever areas of interest the patrons choose. END<br/>
<br/>
So, let&#39;s start. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500644604">Good article. :)  <br/>
<br/>
Of course I have to mention that not all librarians are friendly.  We <br/>
go to two libraries regularly.  One has very friendly staff but not <br/>
very many up to date books. And even though they are friendly and <br/>
have recently got computers, the staff is very clear that they aren&#39;t <br/>
computer teachers.  In other words, they have no idea how to use <br/>
those new-fangled contraptions. ;) <br/>
<br/>
The other library has a better selection of books but VERY rude <br/>
staff.  I think they don&#39;t like children. Or questions.  They don&#39;t <br/>
smile.  They constantly say &quot;Shhhhhhh...&quot;   You have to be in first <br/>
grade (whatever that is!) to have a library card. You have to be an <br/>
adult to get 8 books on your card.  Kids can get 6 books.  No more <br/>
than 3 of the same topic.  That means when I go to the library with <br/>
my 3 kids, 2 of whom are preschoolers, two of us can get 3 books at a <br/>
time and two of us can get 4 books at a time.  And if any of us are <br/>
interested in the same topic, we&#39;re in real trouble. Ugh.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your ideas are grand, but in my experience, not close to reality.<br/>
Many people, whether they work in the school system, the library or <br/>
the grocery store have prejudices against children.<br/>
Have you ever walked into a library with 4 or more kids?  75% of the <br/>
library employees aren&#39;t what I would call, courteous and respectful <br/>
to us.  Some of the ladies are down right scary! Libraries are places <br/>
to BE QUIET!  I even witnessed one librarian(the one in charge of the <br/>
childrens programs for some odd reason) severely shushing and shaming <br/>
kids at a program where there was a magician.  He was encouraging the <br/>
kids to answer his questions and participate with him.<br/>
This lady was a watch dog waiting for these kids to actually enjoy <br/>
themselves.  She made a spectacle of herself, all the while thinking <br/>
she was doing a good job controlling these kids.<br/>
I went to a library near my parents and was thrilled when I found the <br/>
kids section downstairs away form all those noise fearing adults.  We <br/>
had a great time, and the librarian was friendly and obviously liked <br/>
kids.  We stayed for hours watching vidoes on a big screen tv, <br/>
playing computer games and ofcoarse, reading books.  We came back a <br/>
few days later because the experience was so much nicer than the ones <br/>
we get from our libraries in our area.  Unfortuately, there was a <br/>
different librarian on duty and it was the same old feelings of <br/>
walking on ice and getting out of there quickly and quietly. <br/>
My kids know library etiquette, and are usually in good form when we <br/>
go, but we can&#39;t stay long and we rarely feel welcome.<br/>

books we can carry and there is no age restriction on library cards.<br/>
