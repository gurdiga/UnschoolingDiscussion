<div id="ygrps-yiv-158691776">Julie,  here are the daily requirements for protein .  This came from The <br/>
Diabetic/Hypoglycemic Cope Book:  As a woman over 19 yrs of age, who is <br/>
nursing a baby, you will need  65g of protein a day.  It  says, further, in  <br/>
figuring your amounts, that if you eat  vegetable protein sources, to  <br/>
multiply by 0.73 before adding them to the protein total.  Ex:  tofu- 3 1/2 <br/>
oz= 8g x 0.73= 5.8g protein.                                                    <br/>
                                Sources of protein:                             <br/>
                                                        Dairy: cottage <br/>
cheese- 3.5 oz= 17g    Milk solids- 1 oz=10g   milk- 1c= 9g  parmesan <br/>
cheese-1 oz= 10g    plain yogurt- 1c= 8g   cheddar cheese- 1 oz=7g   swiss <br/>
cheese-1 oz= 8g              Meats: (3.5 oz serving sz)...    turkey- 31g   <br/>
pork- 29g   lean steak-25g   hamburger-25g   chicken-23g   lamb-20g   1 egg- <br/>
6g                  Grains, 1/3 cup, raw:   wheat-8g   barley-6g    millet-6g <br/>
  oatmeal-4g   rice-5g   1 slice, whole wheat bread- 2.4g         Legumes, 1 <br/>
cup cooked:  soy- 17g   peas- 12g   limas-10g   tofu- 8g   soymilk-9g   * <br/>
Having LBS will present some restrictions, initially, on your being able to <br/>
successfully consume some carbohydrates.  When first trying to stabilize <br/>
blood sugar, it is advisable to eat a high protein diet ( Ed Krimmel, The Low <br/>
Blood Sugar Handbook).  It takes at least 3 mos of diet modification to <br/>
stabilize blood sugars.  In this period, you will go through withdrawal- like <br/>
symptoms.  You may have days where you feel worse, or even constantly hungry. <br/>
 These will pass.  As a nursing mother, you must take care to nourish your <br/>
body.  The baby will get what he needs from you, but being that it is a <br/>
direct physical drain on your system, it WILL have a direct  impact on your <br/>
dietary needs.  This , in conjunction with LBS, means you do have special <br/>
needs at this time.  Over time, your need for higher protein will likely <br/>
change, and you will need less, but at this time-- as a nursing mother, AND a <br/>
hypoglycemic  that is trying to get blood sugar levels in check, you do need <br/>
a higher protein  amount daily.  Listen to your body.  Eat something every <br/>
2hrs--sooner if you need to.                                                    <br/>
                                        Calcium requirements:  As a woman <br/>
over 18 yrs that is nursing a baby, you need 2000mg a day.  This also came <br/>
from the book mentioned above.  I do not recall the exact amts of the foods <br/>
that equal the mgs that correspond.  I am thinking it may be about  1 c, <br/>
unless otherwise stated:     soymilk- 55mg   broccoli- cooked- 136mg    <br/>
cooked carrots- 51 mg   shrimp- 63mg   raw peanuts- (1 oz )- 13 mg   1/4 lb <br/>
lean ground beef- 14 mg   1/4 chicken -7 mg   1 egg- 27 mg     cheddar <br/>
cheese- 200 mg   mozzarella cheese- 163 mg   parmesan cheese- 329 mg   <br/>
ricotta cheese- 1 c - 291mg   yogurt - 1 c- 274mg                               <br/>
                                                            There are some <br/>
fruits and vegetables that you should avoid as a hypoglycemic.  That is <br/>
because they have natural sugar levels that will cause the pancreas to <br/>
release too much insulin, and cause hypoglycemic symptoms.   At this time, I <br/>
cannot eat corn, potatoes and rice (even brown rice), because they are too <br/>
high glycemic.  I can eat very little bread, even though they are whole <br/>
wheat, oat, etc.  I can have some bread items now, but I have to watch the <br/>
amts.  I make oat pancakes sometimes, which are wonderful, but I have to <br/>
watch the total amt of carbs throughout the day, or I will feel it for <br/>
sometimes up to 3 days later.  Instead regular breads, I use whole flour soft <br/>
burrito shells.  They can be used in many ways, and give you the satisfaction <br/>
of bread, and yet, it is low glycemic.  Do not eat the corn flour shells, <br/>
though, until you are stabilized.    Basically, when it comes to eating <br/>
carbs, you will need to know which are &quot;ok&quot; and which are not.  Some you can <br/>
eat w/o limitation, and some you will need to avoid completely.  But until <br/>
you reach a  more stabilized blood sugar level, you should NOT eat a ton of <br/>
carbs just yet.  But, again, like I said before, your needs will not always <br/>
be like this.  I will be happy to share with you the list of carbs by % amts <br/>
as to what is recommended  for you at this time in your dietary needs.  In no <br/>
way do I mean to drone on and on, but I, too, am a nursing mom, who is <br/>
hypoglycemic, and I absolutely know where you are coming from regarding the <br/>
mood swings, and other physical symptoms.  Gotta go now... time for a snack!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-392775860">Karen,<br/>
Thanks for the great information!   I looked for the book you were talking <br/>
about and they did not have it in the public library.<br/>
<br/>
 I would love to hear more.  Shall we talk about this off the list?  I don&#39;t <br/>
want to &quot;follow you home&quot; and I am not sure how many others are interest in <br/>
this discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I have been really watching my sugar intact and many of the syptoms seem to <br/>
be easing.  But sugar is in everything.  It soooo frustrating....what to eat, <br/>
hmmmmmm?????<br/>
<br/>
It is nice to know that I am not just a witch of a mother, (unless I o.d. on <br/>
sugar)<br/>
<br/>
Julie<br/>
BTW, I printed out the information you sent.  Thanks again.</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely-- I was just going to suggest the same thing.  I will send you <br/>
carb % info soon.  Write me if you have any questions that you think I could <br/>
help you with, or if we could share recipe ideas, too!  Talk to you soon.  <br/>
