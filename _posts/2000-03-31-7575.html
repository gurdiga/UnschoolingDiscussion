<div id="ygrps-yiv-652240239">I am still not through all my messages... but I thought i would share my day<br/>
today as it was a fairly typical day- in  that not too much in the way of<br/>
structured activities happened.<br/>
<br/>
This morning... Kids woke up as usual around 7:00, and joined us in bed for<br/>
about half an hour... Jordan(8) got dressed first and started playing lego.<br/>
Daylon(almost 6) had a shower fist with my wife, and then with me.  (he<br/>
would have stayed in longer too...)  Jordan made his own bed, and i helped<br/>
daylon. We were relaxing in the kitchen with a cup of strong coffee and<br/>
Jordan came in and began chatting about our frends who have three birthdays<br/>
in a row (in their family)coming up.... he was worried about how he could<br/>
afford to purchase them all a gift.  We ended up telling him that adults<br/>
often like thigs that are hand-made better... He ended up getting us all<br/>
inspired and drawing pictures that remind us of our friends.  My<br/>
partner(selina) didnt have to rush off to work, so we all ate porrage<br/>
together, and then the boys did their morning chores...<br/>
<br/>
Next, I think they went out and played in the yard (there were lots of kids<br/>
around today as spring break has been extened by a teacher strike)  Daylon<br/>
came in soon to play inside with 2 friends.  They played an elaborate<br/>
imagination game utilizing every plastic toy animal we have.<br/>
Lunch (we invited their uncle(18) who lives in our basement suite to eat<br/>
with us... )<br/>
Selina popped in to grab a bite to eat... )<br/>
More chores...<br/>
I did many loads of laundry...<br/>
I drove Selina back to work while Uncle watched the boys<br/>
Made a sawhorse with Jordan with the tools he got for his birthday<br/>
Intervened in back yard play that was getting too out of control<br/>
Established that from now on neighbourhood kids have to knock on our door<br/>
first before playing in our yard...<br/>
Uncle took the the boys to see a Stewart Little downtown<br/>
I went grocery shopping<br/>
Jordan played &quot;Sonic school house&quot; on CD-Rom<br/>
Daylon played some more outside<br/>
I got dinner in the oven...<br/>
jordan phoned a friend up and invited him over...<br/>
Daylon came in and joined in as they dumped all the lego&#39;s on a blanket in<br/>
the middle of the living room.<br/>
Selina called needing a ride home... packed all three boys in the car  to go<br/>
pick her up.<br/>
let the boys play for a few minutes untel dinner was ready... (7:15 today)<br/>
<br/>
After dinner the boys put away all their laundry that I folded, and got<br/>
ready for bed.<br/>
I read stores for half an hour...<br/>
and then come on here to check my mail for the first time all week.<br/>
<br/>
Many days we do more constructive things... but there are just as many days<br/>
like this...   Partly I feel we are still de-schooling after half a year in<br/>
Waldorf school... Jordan is just taking off with his reading... and so he<br/>
was reading things througout the day...<br/>
Tommorow my only planned activity for the kids is for Jordan to do thankyou<br/>
notices for his birthday party... Daylon has a &quot;nature club&quot; he is working<br/>
on and I want to help him &quot;work&quot; on it some more.  Also, there is swimming<br/>
lessons.<br/>
<br/>
You really can not have a typical day unschooling... you never know what<br/>
will hapen... you might find you get a clearer picture from a &quot;typical week&quot;<br/>
though, as that would include all regularly scheduled activities, as well as<br/>
exceptional things like a &quot;field trip&quot; or outings.<br/>
<br/>
blessings<br/>
