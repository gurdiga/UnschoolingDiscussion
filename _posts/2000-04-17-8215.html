<div id="ygrps-yiv-569023295"><blockquote><span title="qreply">&gt; This was written from the woman who appeared on the Oprah segment on<br/>
&gt; homeschooling.<br/>
&gt; ***********************************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i know this sounds pretty lame, but this is the first time i could write back<br/>
&gt; to you...it seems that my phone lines are just FLOODED with calls after my<br/>
&gt; star-studded appearance on oprah....not really, but it&#39;s surprising how many<br/>
&gt; people still DO watch and were surprised to see us all there in living color<br/>
&gt; (and a few pounds heavier...see, it&#39;s true!).  i had no idea until that<br/>
&gt; morning when we arrived (via limo) that we were really going to talk on the<br/>
&gt; show, as they whisked me into the green room with the family you say and that<br/>
&gt; blonde chick that thought she was a homeschooler.  they wanted me to talk<br/>
&gt; about the transition into college and said that this is a talk show, you<br/>
&gt; know, and oprah doesn&#39;t know anything about homeschooling, so talk or she&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; move along.  then they almost gave me a script, did all our hair and make-up<br/>
&gt; and i felt like i was being used!  so, to make a long story short, fear<br/>
&gt; gripped as time got closer and i thought i&#39;d faint from hyper-ventilation,<br/>
&gt; but when the time came, i thought that if this were my only chance, i&#39;d<br/>
&gt; better get in as much as i possibly could (the whole segment was a mere 12<br/>
&gt; minutes).  so, well, you heard it...i didn&#39;t even know it was going to be<br/>
&gt; live until we got there, so i couldn&#39;t get all the phone calls in, but lots<br/>
&gt; of people saw it or taped it at 11.  by the way, there was lots more<br/>
&gt; conversation during the commercials and i told her that she really needs to<br/>
&gt; so a couple shows on the subject...no one was more compassionate about any of<br/>
&gt; the other topics that day except ours, and the overwhelming majority of the<br/>
&gt; comments were positive.  my kids talked to gobs of people from the audience<br/>
&gt; afterwords, including lots of young people their ages who have gone throught<br/>
&gt; the whole thing themselves!!!!  and after, in the green room, i told oprah<br/>
&gt; that she REALLY could do another whole show on the subject, to which she<br/>
&gt; snuffed, &quot;ha! i got 200 other shows to do!&quot;  and she was less than polite<br/>
&gt; about even chaking my hand...oh well, just another lost soul....we all were<br/>
&gt; less than impressed with her and her whole operation, and for all my trouble,<br/>
&gt; i got an oprah mug!!!!  time to turn the page in my life.....thanks for your<br/>
&gt; vote of confidence, but you know, once i get talking about homeschooling,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s hard to shut up, and then they want to condense it into a few short<br/>
&gt; minutes???????     karen<br/>
