<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328324304">Hello all..<br/>
<br/>
I am very new to unschooling and I have a few questions. I realize so <br/>
far (correct me if I am wrong) that we/I should not argue over such <br/>
things as TV and video game time and also that bedtime should be left <br/>
to the child.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my dilemma.. My ds is 13 1/2 and although I haven&#39;t been <br/>
setting a &quot;bedtime&quot; I do ask that he is quiet while others are <br/>
sleeping, being that Michael has to get up and go to work and there <br/>
are 2 other teens who have to get up in the mornings for school. (DS <br/>
is the only one at home at this time). This isn&#39;t working out very <br/>
well for others in the house. It is as late, or early however you <br/>
look at it, as 5am, and he has still been up. Not good for everyone <br/>
else here.<br/>
<br/>
Also, he has had a friend over for the past couple of nights, and I <br/>
noticed this morning when I got up that I had 1/2 a bottle of wine <br/>
missing. I am not happy about this! <br/>
<br/>
Please anyone who could help me handle these things as a &quot;cool&quot; <br/>
unschooling Mom, I am patiently awaiting your responses...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for all the wonderful words of wisdom that I <br/>
know will come from this board!<br/>
<br/>
Have a Great Day All!!<br/>
Hopefully I will have some advice before he wakes up so that I don&#39;t <br/>
mess things up worse!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-397312008">Hi Cindy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello all..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>so <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; far (correct me if I am wrong) that we/I should not argue over such <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to the child.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s right. Okay, we don&#39;t have an &quot;off&quot; button on the computer <br/>
games or TV anymore, but we do still have a general lights out, <br/>
around 10:00- 10:30, which is when they&#39;re all getting tired anyway. <br/>
WE don&#39;t have a wake-up time, but I might be changing that, since <br/>
straggling up means the kitchen is never clean: someone is always <br/>
making food in there...but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a hill worth <br/>
fighting on. <br/>
<br/>
Now, with this &quot;lights out&quot; we also have (occasional) &quot;Stay Up Alone&quot; <br/>
nights, where everyone else goes to bed and, as long as he or she is <br/>
quiet, the kid stays up until tired. We&#39;ve had as late/early as 4 <br/>
a.m. and as &quot;early&quot; as 1:00 a.m. And the kids love it. It isn&#39;t every <br/>
night though, not in our house.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Talk to your boy about it. I&#39;m not a veteran unschooler, though. <br/>
Others probably have some good advice about the missing wine. I&#39;d <br/>
talk to him. Ask him about it. Tell him, you&#39;re working on developing <br/>
trust between the two of you, and that is why you&#39;ve allowed him to <br/>
choose his own pastimes and bedtime. And that trust is fragile, so he <br/>
must respect it....I dunno. something like that?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Is he waking them up?  If he can stay up that late and nobody knows without <br/>
getting up at 5:00 and seeing him, why is it a problem?  If he&#39;s making noise, <br/>
I would say &quot;no more,&quot; or &quot;stay in your room and read&quot; or something, but if <br/>
he&#39;s really quiet...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also, he has had a friend over for the past couple of nights, and I <br/>
<br/>
noticed this morning when I got up that I had 1/2 a bottle of wine <br/>
<br/>
missing. I am not happy about this! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would say without eye contact, when they were both in the room, &quot;Leave the <br/>
wine alone.  I don&#39;t want to get in trouble and I don&#39;t want you doing things <br/>
you shouldn&#39;t be doing.&quot;   Or if the extra kid was likely to scoff at that, I <br/>
would tell my kid that I knew it had happened, and that if the other kid was <br/>
going to be a bad influence he needed to go home.  I&#39;d remind my kid he had a <br/>
responsibility to be a good host and not betray his parents&#39; trust BOTH, and <br/>
here were ways to do that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Hopefully I will have some advice before he wakes up so that I don&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
mess things up worse!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s always the &quot;What would you do if you were me?&quot; question, but really <br/>
give him time to think about it and answer it carefully.  Often kids&#39; proposals <br/>
are much harsher than their parents really wanted to do, so when you DO <br/>
respond it seems light to him.   (That&#39;s a teacher trick.  Ask kids what the <br/>
punishment should be for something they they go straight to F&#39;s and expulsions, and <br/>
if the teacher says &quot;I thought I&#39;d just make him sit closer to the front,&quot; or <br/>
&quot;He can just take the test again after school,&quot; the kids seem surprised that <br/>
there are peaceful, non-punitive solutions for situations.<br/>
<br/>
And another tool/trick is to say that you&#39;re not comfortable with that kid <br/>
making your kid be sneaky, but when he&#39;s grown and has his OWN place, he could <br/>
invite that kid over to spend the night and they could drink all night.  But <br/>
that doing it in your house was a slight toward you and his dad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t do ALL that stuff, just one or two.  Saying too much never helps.  <br/>
Next time the kid&#39;s over you could just watch to see if it&#39;s better.  I bet <br/>
it will be!  If he wants to visit your house, he&#39;ll want to do what it takes to <br/>
be welcome back.<br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t had the drinking problem, but we&#39;ve had some instances of a <br/>
visitor wanting my kids to do something sneaky.<br/>

The best way to keep a clean kitchen is probably never to have children!<br/>
<br/>
Having had them, it seems that kitchens are primarily for storing and <br/>
preparing food, and not for keeping clean.  Should the kitchen serve the people, or <br/>
should the people serve the kitchen?<br/>
<br/>
One of those priorities considerations.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had this happen and handled it different ways at different times.  The <br/>
most effective way was just making a general announcement with all kids present <br/>
that I KNEW wine/beer/liquor was missing and that I didn&#39;t expect it would <br/>
happen again.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t until kids were much older teens and different kids were around.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I occasionally buy wine coolers for myself, maybe a 4 pk in a month.  Dh <br/>
drinks about a 6 pack of beer in 2 weeks. .   Sometimes one of the wine coolers is <br/>
gone or one is opened and half empty.  My response is, &quot;HEY, who drank my <br/>
wine cooler??  *pout.    I always get someone giggling or snickering and <br/>
sheepishly admitting &quot;it was me&quot;.    My reply,  &quot;Darn!, I was really looking forward <br/>
to that wine cooler.!&quot;   They never get into their Dad&#39;s beer.  They have all <br/>
tasted it and YUCK!, they are not interested in drinking any.   But those wine <br/>
coolers look too inviting, too much like fruit juice or kool-aid.  Landon is <br/>
the only one who likes any of the flavors  well enough to drink a whole one.  <br/>
The other kids are the culprits in opening them just to get a taste.<br/>
<br/>
   It&#39;s pretty much the same way with any particular grocery item that <br/>
someone picks out themselves.  Anna&#39;s favorite ice cream.  Landon&#39;s favorite cookie. <br/>
 A special treat that JP picks out.  Ethans beloved french fries.  They do <br/>
not belong to that one person in particular, they are for the whole family to <br/>
share.  But when they are all gone.. DARN IT!.  somebody ate my so and so!.  <br/>
