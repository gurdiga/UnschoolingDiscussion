<div id="ygrps-yiv-385825344">Got into a physical confrontation tonight at her play.  I am guessing <br/>
that it happened like this, based on various reports.  Lexie had her <br/>
autograph book and gave it to another child to sign.  The child <br/>
accidently brought it upstairs to the stage right before a scene and <br/>
gave it to Lexie just as the curtains were opening.  Lexie was mad <br/>
because she thought the scene was ruined and stuffed the book under the <br/>
bed.  Later as the girls were going back downstairs Lexie confronted the <br/>
girl and somehow became mad and lost her temper and pushed the girl hard <br/>
against the wall.  The girl pushed Lexie back and two older girls <br/>
stepped in and pulled Lexie away.  Lexie accused them of &quot;acting like my <br/>
mother&quot; and &quot;being mean&quot; but the girls said they were afraid Lexie was <br/>
going to hurt the other child.  I think the older girls were quick to <br/>
put an end to the situation and were not overly mean--lexie is very <br/>
sensitive to others telling her what to do. At first Lexie tried to tell <br/>
me she was &quot;playing around&quot; and it got rough but later she admitted that <br/>
she had lost her temper and had deliberately pushed the child.  I really <br/>
didn&#39;t know how to handle it.  On one hand, I didn&#39;t want to be the mom <br/>
who feels her child never does anything wrong and therefore blame the <br/>
incident on the other child(ren).  On the other hand, I did want to be <br/>
fair to everyone.  Lexie is the same age as the other child but the <br/>
other child is a bit smaller so... Lexie did apologize and she felt very <br/>
bad about it later, but it really brought to my attention that Lexie has <br/>
a temper!  We all had a nice chat and agreed that it was settled.  The <br/>
older girls apologized to Lexie for scaring her, reiterating that they <br/>
didn&#39;t mean to act like her mother but were stopping something quick.  I <br/>
still feel they did a fine job of dealing with the situation and I will <br/>
be sure to tell them that next week.  It was my daughter who was the <br/>
instigator and I feel a bit funny about that.  I understood when she was <br/>
two and got into it with another child, but when she&#39;s 8? She should <br/>
know better, right?  <br/>
<br/>
Later I found out the child is the daughter of an email friend.  We&#39;ve <br/>
met a few times but I didn&#39;t put it together at the moment.  I had <br/>
already told Lexie she needed to apologize to the mom of the girl, and <br/>
when I realized the mom was this friend, I felt relieved.  I knew Diana <br/>
would handle the situation well, and she did.  Lexie admitted to Diana <br/>
that she had lost her temper and shoved her daughter and apologized and <br/>
Diana said she thought more of Lexie because Lexie was able to go to <br/>
Diana and tell her.  So it&#39;s all over, but I&#39;m still a bit upset over <br/>
this... I have the old thought in my head that I wish I would stop <br/>
thinking--what did I do wrong to create a child who would shove another <br/>
child.  :-(  <br/>
<br/>
Comfort me please, and tell me I handled this appropriately.  <br/>
<br/>
Basically I was raised a pacifist. My parents never even talked about <br/>
defending myself, I was simply never to get into a fight or be physical <br/>
with anyone.  I did not want to do that to my own child.  I feel that <br/>
self defense is necessary sometimes, rarely.  As a teen I was in a few <br/>
situation where I should have been free to defend myself but could not, <br/>
or I tried and looked like a fool.  I&#39;m trying to find the middle <br/>
ground, raising a non-violent child who realizes that violence doesn&#39;t <br/>
solve anything but at the same time letting her know that self defense <br/>
is OK.  Also, we obviously need to work on her temper--or should I just <br/>
chalk this up to a stressful weekend, she&#39;s in her first play, not <br/>
enough sleep, she has a cold, etc.  <br/>

Highly stressful.  I&#39;ve seen adults freak out over little things.<br/>

I think you&#39;ve probably already done all the important stuff!  Fact finding, <br/>
reassurance, discussion of what could have gone differently and how she might <br/>
handle it next time, apologies...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could tell her that what is forgiven in little kids could be <br/>
assault and have to involve police in older kids or adults, and that the worst <br/>
problem with responding in fury is that she might accidently put that kid&#39;s eye out <br/>
(partly a euphemism for do permanent damage or accidental death).<br/>
<br/>
Words are way more legal (outside of death threats) in such situations, and <br/>
going away and breathing (which I&#39;m sure you recommended) is good too.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe to make her feel better about the bigger girls pulling her off you <br/>
could make up a different scenario (not use that same one) and say that you hope <br/>
if she ever sees someone younger lose his or her temper and sees that they&#39;re <br/>
in danger of hurting someone that you hope she&#39;ll be quick-thinking and brave <br/>
enough to help them stop.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we were at a dance recital and there was the jailhouse piece from <br/>
Chicago.  One of the dancers backed into her jail-door-on-wheels and it fell <br/>
over.  It wasn&#39;t loud, just down.  <br/>
<br/>
She went to the next unoccupied one and finished the dance part, and when the <br/>
last one to come back got there, she just casually and gracefully picked that <br/>
fallen one up in rhythm with the music and kept on going.  It was an elegant <br/>
save.  Maybe talk to her about that too, about how sometimes in a performance <br/>
someone WILL end up with or without a prop (or wrong or extra thing) in hand, <br/>
and if they can, in persona, just set it down, or say &quot;Where is my umbrella?&quot; <br/>
in the character&#39;s voice and get it, the play goes on more smoothly.  It can <br/>
be more fun for the audience members who know the play if they KNOW the <br/>
character was supposed to be holding a letter, or a glass, or whatever, and they get <br/>
to see how the actor will recover.<br/>
<br/>
Stress is always a danger, and if you tell her that too, that when she&#39;s <br/>
stressed and tired and getting sick (which happens to every human no matter how <br/>
organized or healthy they might be), that she needs to be EXTRA careful to be <br/>
patient and sweet.   <br/>
<br/>
I bet having had this incident she&#39;ll be better aware of her range and will <br/>
be more contained in future incidents.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d chalk it up to a stressful weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Before this deployment, we had many (too many!) briefings on stress,<br/>
seperation, etc., and one thing that I was reminded of was that many<br/>
children just have not learned how to cope with pressure.  So little things<br/>
(like an autograph book, maybe) can bring about a problem when really they<br/>
aren&#39;t the problem in the first place.  If you think that under different<br/>
circumstances, Lexie could have handled the situation better, then it&#39;s<br/>
likely that she needs some help with the bigger issues.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe just dealing with the stress of the weekend and considering how to<br/>
deal with stress in general will help your daughter feel more in control of<br/>
her anger.  Really, though, it sounds to me like it was handled quite well,<br/>
and definitely compliment the older girls on stepping in quickly to help<br/>
your daughter stop when she needed the help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We saw a production of Peter Pan recently where Captain Hook&#39;s wig fell<br/>
off during the final duel with Pan. The girl playing Pan said something<br/>
just perfect without missing a beat - I think it was, &quot;Now you&#39;ve really<br/>
flipped your wig!&quot; It was a kid&#39;s show, even, the girl was 16, I<br/>
think....<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, we saw a production of Follies last weekend in Stockton, and one of<br/>
the women forgot the words in her solo &quot;But I&#39;m Here&quot;, and her voice got<br/>
very soft and she mumbled along and it looked pretty bad, which was too<br/>
bad because it was a marvelous show otherwise. An actress we know forgot<br/>
the words a few years ago doing the same part, same song (it&#39;s a long<br/>
song and there really aren&#39;t any reference points for the lyrics, unless<br/>
you build them into the choreography) and she just smild big and sang,<br/>
&quot;La la la&quot; to the tune, and no one who didn&#39;t know the show knew anything<br/>
was wrong... <br/>
<br/>
We went to a restaurant/piano bar Friday night, a friend of ours is the<br/>
pianist, and he got Rain up there to sing &quot;All That Jazz&quot;, which is one<br/>
of her usual audition pieces. So she knows it pretty well, but she messed<br/>
up the lyrics at one point... and recovered! She was so nervous, she said<br/>
singing like that was really different from doing shows or even<br/>
auditions. The audiene was mostly senior citizens, and they were very<br/>
positive, so it ended up being a good expereince...<br/>
<br/>
I agree with what everyone said about Lexie, and would and that actresses<br/>
who are difficult in shows don&#39;t generally get cast again, and kids who<br/>
are known as easy to get along with but maybe aren&#39;t quite as talented<br/>
usually end up with roles, IME. And we&#39;ve seen plenty of adult actresses<br/>
lose it backstage, although not to the physical point (thank goodness!).<br/>
It is stressful... <br/>
<br/>
And I really want to hear about the play!<br/>
