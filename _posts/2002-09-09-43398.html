How do you all balance the needs of different kids?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>it might be helpful to remember that 3 and a half can be a really difficult <br/>
age.  The half years always are for us, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
This is an issue I struggle with a lot as well, but for different reasons.  <br/>
Mine are just 1 year apart, so we tend to do everything as a threesome and <br/>
they get very little individual time.  They love the &quot;just you and me&quot; times. <br/>
 I try to make sure they get at least some of that every day, but it probably <br/>
turns out to be more like once or twice a week.  <br/>

<br/>
I have seven kids and I don&#39;t think I am able to balance all the kids needs at once...its a compromise thing. Sometimes one child seems to need more attention than another. Sometimes, I have to ask one to wait awhile. Sometimes an older  child will  do something with another - there is a kind of synergy involved in a large family, where ideas and activities are often shared..Sometimes, I listen to everyone&#39;s wants ( eg  wanting to listen to a book, wanting to play a game now) and I try to find a compromise - writing down their wants/needs is a help.  Little kids really seem to feel reassured that mum is writing down what they want , what they want to do, even if they can&#39;t have it now. I have had mine post this paper on the fridge - they feel it is important...They feel I am listening ( I am!)  and  that I am taking them seriously, even if I can&#39;t stop reading to one at the moment, in order to play a game with another. They know its written down and we&#39;ll get to it...Its not ideal but its give and  take and discussion, and gets easier as they get older... two books already mentioned on this list  that I have found helpful are Siblings Without Rivalry and How To Talk So Kids Can Listen and Listen So Kids can Talk. Both by Faber and Mazlish....Leonie W. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-949751823">Hi Pam<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if I have anything useful to contribute on this, although I<br/>
feel a connection because my sons are five years apart - 9yo & 4 yo<br/>
(soon to be 10 & 5).  I&#39;m not sure I can relate to the needs of either<br/>
taking me from the other - except that I can&#39;t conduct two verbal<br/>
conversations at once.  I have a vague recollection of explaining to a<br/>
5-6yo son the needs of the baby and talking a lot to him about how he<br/>
might need to remind me occasionally if I put something for him off<br/>
because when he was a baby I would forget things easily and might do<br/>
with this one too.  <br/>
<br/>
I began reading then about TCS (taking children seriously) and becoming<br/>
a consensus driven creative thinking family so I would talk with the<br/>
oldest a lot about all of our needs/wishes and how we might together<br/>
come up with solutions for everyone to have what we need.  Mostly the<br/>
outcome was good, a rare very creative solution, many times just<br/>
understanding and accepting of later, sometimes practical help to have<br/>
later come sooner.  I have to admit I fell out of the habit over time as<br/>
I became busy with my own interests, and I became more autocratic.<br/>
Being uncomfortable with that I have made sure this year to cut back on<br/>
the volunteer work and re-invest the time in the boys.  I still don&#39;t<br/>
find much conflict - we talk about all the requests (if none are able to<br/>
be handled briefly) and work out solutions together.<br/>
<br/>
I vaguely remember someone suggesting I arrange a particular time each<br/>
week (?or each day) for my oldest son to get my full attention during<br/>
the period when his brother as a baby often had to have his needs tended<br/>
first.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck working something out.<br/>
<br/>
