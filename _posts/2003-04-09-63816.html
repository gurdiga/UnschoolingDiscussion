<div id="ygrps-yiv-653277587">I&#39;m sorry about this, but I&#39;m home alone with the kids, Jason is out <br/>
helping my stepdad, and I just got a hour long reeming from my mom <br/>
about how schools are different then I remember and how I&#39;m damaging <br/>
my kids by keeping them from school and peer interaction and that <br/>
Jaiden obviously has aspeech problem and if I knew what was good for <br/>
him I&#39;d put him in school so he could get free speech therapy. I told <br/>
her that we were commited to homeschooling (I haven&#39;t even tried to <br/>
explain unschooling to her) and that no we don&#39;t sit down and do <br/>
school every day. She told me that I was teaching my kids to be <br/>
unable to function in the real world if I don&#39;t force them to eat <br/>
when I say it&#39;s time and send them off to bed when I think it&#39;s time <br/>
and all the other crap that I&#39;m sure you all have heard a million <br/>
times from people in your life. I knew it would happen sooner or <br/>
later, I just thought it would happen when Jaiden and Avery were old <br/>
enough to actually GO to school. I feel, hell I don&#39;t know how I <br/>
feel. I&#39;m angry and hurt and saddend by it all. I am a little scared <br/>
of what she might do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry about all of this I just didn&#39;t know where eles to turn. <br/>
Thank you all for being here.<br/>
<br/>
Rebecca<br/>
<br/>
p.s on a happier note, I just started a local unschooling group, it&#39;s <br/>
still in the early stages but as of yesterday(day 2 of the group) we <br/>
were up to 25 members, I&#39;m so excited to think that ther are <br/>
unschoolers in my area!<br/>

Here&#39;s the link in case anyone is interested. :-)<br/>

Rebecca, sorry to hear you had such a crappy day. And it was all crap. I&#39;m<br/>
sure you know that, I guess just coming from your mom makes it not so<br/>
passable. I&#39;ve had some stuff not so harsh and from in laws, being that I<br/>
never listen to what they say anyway, can&#39;t say it really bothered. I would<br/>
say to just tell her these are your kids and you&#39;ll be the one to decide how<br/>
they are parented. Seems though as if you are worried about what she may do.<br/>
I guess you are also thinking she is capable of calling someone. How about<br/>
an education in homeschooling?? Would she read a book or even something you<br/>
print out for her? Maybe try gently to bring her over to the dark side!!!!<br/>
Only you know whether you can do this or not. Might help though.<br/>
<br/>
On a last note, good for you for finding a support group of unschoolers. I<br/>
have yet to find one other family in my area that homeschool. Found out<br/>
yesterday that there is a group of unschoolers in Miami. That&#39;s just way too<br/>
far for me. I&#39;m happy for you. I would love to find just one family locally.<br/>

<br/>
I laughed.  I&#39;m sorry, but this was really, truly funny.<br/>
<br/>
I think you should do this:   <br/>
<br/>
Fein wide-eyed consideration of what she said.  Say &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about <br/>
what you said.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That will shut her up for a few months.  You don&#39;t have to add &quot;I think you <br/>
know diddly and you&#39;re mean,&quot; just &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then instead of saying &quot;They will never set foot on school grounds,&quot; say <br/>
&quot;We&#39;re going to try homeschooling for the first year and see how it goes, and <br/>
if it&#39;s not working out, we&#39;ll send her to school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If it&#39;s not working out&quot; means different things to you and your mom, but it <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter.  She won&#39;t be the judge of whether or not it&#39;s working out.<br/>
<br/>
I seriously think you should put off any oaths of homeschooling in <br/>
perpetuity.  Buy yourself flexibility and give her some hope.<br/>
<br/>
Time will prove you right.  You can start reporting to her the cool things <br/>
you find and see in and about your kids and other homeschoolers, gradually, <br/>
as time goes on.<br/>

<br/>
Yes. Give her books.  The Homeschool Book of Answers, at least.<br/>
And tell her TOTALLY without any waffling that when she has finished that <br/>
book, you&#39;d be glad to discuss it with her.<br/>
<br/>
No more, and no less.<br/>
<br/>
That means that UNTIL she has read that book, she needs to shush.<br/>
And UNLESS she reads that book, you don&#39;t have to defend yourself one smidgen.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you, I do know that it&#39;s crap, but it IS my mom and we have always been really close. She&#39;s close to Jaiden and Avery, we live about 1.5 miles from her, we are in each others life, or had been until Jason and I decided to homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve had some stuff not so harsh and from in laws, being that I never listen to what they say anyway, can&#39;t say it really bothered.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do try not to listen, it&#39;s hard though, until recently we were more like best friends, and it&#39;s difficult to seperate from all that. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I would say to just tell her these are your kids and you&#39;ll be the one to decide how they are parented.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did tell her that today, and at many other times, she dosen&#39;t listen really well. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Seems though as if you are worried about what she may do. I guess you are also thinking she is capable of calling someone.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I would have said no way, she&#39;d never do that. Today, I&#39;m not sp sure, she was really harsh today, very adament about the fact I was doing harm to my kids. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;How about an education in homeschooling?? Would she read a book or even something you print out for her? Maybe try gently to bring her over to the dark side!!!!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago, I think she would have been open to the idea. But 2 years ago she went to work for the school district, and in her mind they can do NO wrong.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;On a last note, good for you for finding a support group of unschoolers. I have yet to find one other family in my area that homeschool. Found out<br/>
yesterday that there is a group of unschoolers in Miami. That&#39;s just way too<br/>

<br/>
&lt;G&gt; I couldn&#39;t find one, so I just went ahead and started one :-). Most of the families seem to be more &quot;relaxed&quot; than unschooling, but it will be nice to not have to wade through circulium and school desks for sale posts just to get to anything interesting. <br/>
<br/>
I am excited though Nancy Wooten is in San Diego and she joined, so I know I&#39;m not alone!<br/>

You sound just like Jason &lt;g&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
When I told him what happened today, he said pretty much the same thing, although not nearly as polite. <br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t think she&#39;d read the book, and she&#39;s very passive agressinve and where as she my keep her mouth shut to ME she&#39;d find a way to keep it going.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Well they certainly didn&#39;t come out of Florida woodwork!!!! I have tried for<br/>
about 4 years now. I even just tried getting homeschoolers together in my<br/>
town and nothing. My homeschoolers locally number the same 3 families after<br/>
about 2 times getting together. Myself included. We&#39;ve become friends but<br/>
they are still school at homers. There are tons of homeschoolers here, and<br/>
quite a few in my town, just none that are interested in getting together.<br/>
Not even once a month for a park day. I&#39;m starting to think it&#39;s me.<br/>
<br/>
 I would really like to connect with someone personally here that unschools.<br/>

Maybe if you still want to talk to her about it, you could ask her to point<br/>
out the *specific* ways that they are being harmed.  Ask her to really look<br/>
at the kids and tell you how they are different from any other kids their<br/>
age.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;d actually be more inclined to just answer *every* time she brings it<br/>
up something like, &quot;I&#39;m the parent now, and I&#39;ll raise my children.<br/>
Homeschooling is legal.&quot;  Then if she wants to talk more about it, &quot;Oops,<br/>
there&#39;s someone at the door.  Bye.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And as for calling someone, it sounds like they aren&#39;t even school aged, so<br/>
who in the world would she call?<br/>

son has a slight speech problem and she took him to the school system for <br/>
speech therapy.  She said it was terrible.  The workers really didn&#39;t care <br/>
and they put her son in with a group of other students with totally different <br/>

and fighting the insurance battle to get him private lessons through the <br/>

 Not to you or to your children.  My Mom and I did that about a couple of <br/>
topics when I was younger and knew everything.  Instead of getting into <br/>
heated debates we would just not talk about that topic.  Homeschooling is <br/>
legal and you will raise your children the way you think is best.  She isn&#39;t <br/>
going to change your mind and you may not be able to change hers so just <br/>
avoid the topic.<br/>
That might work.  You still have a Mom and the children still have a <br/>
grandmother.<br/>

put school at homers but that sounded too &quot;Simpson&quot; like, LOL)  they have <br/>
things to do and places to be (school work and home).  LOL.  It was nice to <br/>

talked, and not about school work or grades or curriculum. LOL<br/>

at the park - my husband came after work. The kids played on the <br/>

We usually do that every Wednesday all summer long - but this warm <br/>

This is what I&#39;ve done with my dad and stepmom, but they live in Mich. so when they see the kids they can see the things they are learning and are willing to let it go. My mom has decided that if Jaiden&#39;s not reading from one week to the next there&#39;s a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Jason thinks we should only see her 3-4 times a year like we do my dad, then mabey she&#39;d lighten up. I&#39;ts a thought.<br/>

Well, you could go online and find the law for your state and show it to<br/>
her.  Or you could suggest that she brush up her research skills by finding<br/>
where in your state&#39;s law it says that homeschooling is illegal.  (She won&#39;t<br/>

she should get it on record with the state ASAP. (got all this from my<br/>
brother).<br/>
<br/>
Well, you could go online and find the law for your state and show it to<br/>
her.  Or you could suggest that she brush up her research skills by finding<br/>
where in your state&#39;s law it says that homeschooling is illegal.  (She won&#39;t<br/>
find it.  Homeschooling is legal in every state.)<br/>

Well, as of yesterday we have agreed to disagree. I&#39;m not sure how long it&#39;ll last, but for now it&#39;s okay. I joined a state homeschooling list/group last night and I am printing up copies of the law to give her.<br/>
