<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi All......Vote takes it....No on the 
moderator..now on to other stuff.........We have 3 dogs, 2 cats 2 birds, and 2 
fish(one really big one)...Zain waters , and feeds the dogs about 3 x a 
week..the doggy that lives outside, everyday.&nbsp; He feeds the fish in his 
room as well.&nbsp; I for one would like to have more animals, but not just as 
pets, but farm animals, for food , eventually, and goat for milk..chickens for 
eggs....we&#39;re not quite ready for a set up of this sort..but I traded work at a 
croft for herb classes , and the teachers kids were homeschooled......they 
participated in the business, helped with the animals, and various other 
things...what I thought was interesting is one day the son had a friend from the 
neighborhood over, this 10 year old was so enthused by the responsibility that 
he had he came in to ask...can I milk the goat early today, so I can show my 
friend, he&#39;s never seen that before...he included him in doing all the chores 
that day, and with a great attitude..he was so proud he was able to share, and 
do things that alot of people don&#39;t usually experience, regardless of the fact 
that it was a chore....he loved it, and wanted to show off his 
responsibilites..I thought that was pretty cool.&nbsp; Every year they have baby 
goats, and all spring they walk the goats for an hour in the woods behind their 
house...I went out with Emily one day, as she was showing me how it&#39;s done, 
because I was to care for them while their family went to Mexico for a ffew 
weeks.....the joy of a little girl , and three little goats..truly not everyone 
has these kinds of experiences(others I&#39;m sure)....but she picked flowers, sang 
songs, talked and played with them, and showed me what they were eating, and not 
eating and why...the children were actually very good teachers, and so 
deliteful.....I thought it a very healthy, and imaginitive world for children to 
grow up in...I &#39;m sure their are day when the rabbit cages just don&#39;t seem so 
appealing, but everything there seemed to be changing at a pace in harmony with 
the season, so just as one thing became alittle old....new things came up to 
do.....and everyone rotated the responsibilites, and chores, so no -one was 
alwya doing the same thing....it was cool....everyone was responsible for 
picking, and cleaning up after themselves...dishes etc.&nbsp; SO no-one was left 
to clean up after some-one else, really(people that is)&nbsp; .&nbsp; It was the 
neatest thing to see.&nbsp; Now if only I could get the &quot;JOy of work&quot; into my 
house, I&#39;ve almost reached it in the garden.........It was a learning 
experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still pondering alot of what I learned 
there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle*</font></div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550605157">Michelle this sounds wonderful.  but it helps, i suppose when the <br/>
&#39;work&#39; that&#39;s done is the kind of work that everyone can participate <br/>
in.  there isn&#39;t much the kids can do to help me sort out my lll stuff <br/>
or the other stuff I&#39;m doing, or daddy&#39;s accountancy.  the garden <br/>
and the house are the things we do that can be classed as &#39;work&#39; <br/>
that can be done all together and i think there&#39;s too much negativity <br/>
about the house from both dh and my family background.  This <br/>
makes it hard, susan, for me to find &#39;fun&#39; in housework, never mind <br/>
show the kids the &#39;fun.&#39;  Comes partly of not liking the place you <br/>
live, either i think.  but that&#39;s definitely my problem.   btw I was <br/>
walking home with the kids tonight, in front of my house were 2 <br/>
sets of neighbours having a good old chin-wag.  they barely <br/>
acknowledged me.  Both send their kids to the nearby nursery that <br/>
has a dangerous trampoline outside.  hmmm...  Sometimes i relly <br/>
dislike living here :-(<br/>
