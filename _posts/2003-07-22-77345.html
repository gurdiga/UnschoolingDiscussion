<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272050741">A bird flew into our widow and broke her neck.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan ran to her, picked her up carefully, held her in his little hands<br/>
until she died.<br/>
<br/>
He knew her.  She was a House Sparrow hatched and fledged in June and a<br/>
regular at our feeder.  She used to try to sip from the humming bird<br/>
feeder and we delighted in her.   Her parents live in the far end of our<br/>
clothesline pole and are raising a new brood of nestlings. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan&#39;s friends played in the sprinkler and bounced on the trampoline in<br/>
the sunshine while he held this little bird and stroked her soft wings.  <br/>
<br/>
Last Tuesday his friend found an injured Kildeer.  The bird had become<br/>
entangled in a roll of forgotten barbed wire and in her struggles to get<br/>
free the skin was torn from her left leg.   Dylan&#39;s friend didn&#39;t know<br/>
where to take her so she brought her to us.   It was late, we couldn&#39;t<br/>
find a vet, we couldn&#39;t get the biologist, we couldn&#39;t get the woman at<br/>
Wildlife rehab.   We did the best we could, without suture needles, using<br/>
dental floss and antibiotic powder we carefully sewed her leg back<br/>
together.   Later the biologist told us not to do anything because we&#39;d<br/>
send her into shock and kill her.  She said Killdeer never survive in<br/>
captivity and she would either die from her wounds or shock or<br/>
starvation/dehydration.  <br/>
<br/>
We let her go Sunday where she was found.  She seemed happy to have her<br/>
stitches out and to be a free bird again.  She didn&#39;t know she was<br/>
supposed to die, I guess.   <br/>
<br/>
Dylan&#39;s painting a rock to mark the spot where we buried the little House<br/>
Sparrow. <br/>
