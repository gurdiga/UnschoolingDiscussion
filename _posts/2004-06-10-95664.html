<br/>
From:   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:folkypoet@...">folkypoet@...</a> (shana ronayne)<br/>
<br/>
Hi there -<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an unschooling mother who has just begun putting together a <br/>
<br/>
magazine in the tradition of Growing Without Schooling.  I&#39;ve often <br/>
<br/>
felt that there has been something missing in the <br/>
<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling community for the past few years, and I <br/>
<br/>
wanted to do my part to put things right.  This is a project I&#39;ve <br/>
<br/>
been considering for some time now and have just embarked on with a <br/>
<br/>
passion.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The magazine, Live Free: Learn Free, is a forum for unschoolers and <br/>
<br/>
relaxed homeschoolers in which to share ideas, stories, and <br/>
<br/>
experiences in a safe environment.  All the material (save for the <br/>
<br/>
introduction to each issue) will be written by those who home <br/>
<br/>
educate - both parents (or other relatives) and children.  It will <br/>
<br/>
be an inclusive magazine, not only for and by experienced <br/>
<br/>
unschoolers, but also for and by those just starting down the path.  <br/>
<br/>
It will embrace those who are radical in their unschooling methods <br/>
<br/>
and those who are less so.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The magazine will be small in the beginning - put together with <br/>
<br/>
little money and modestly printed.  I think that home educating <br/>
<br/>
families will be more interested in the content than in the look of <br/>
<br/>
the magazine.  My hope is that this notice finds a life of its own <br/>
<br/>
by being forwarded by interested homeschoolers from list to list.  <br/>
<br/>
This seems like the way to reach the most people and to enable the <br/>
<br/>
magazine to become a wonderful resource.  Really, the more people <br/>
<br/>
who write for it, the more helpful it will become.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That said, in my search for unschooling lists, I found you.  I <br/>
<br/>
believe that a magazine written by real homeschoolers at different <br/>
<br/>
points in their journeys could be a very valuable resource for those <br/>
<br/>
just starting out.  I was not a member of this group until today, <br/>
<br/>
and I don&#39;t want to be seen as a spammer.  My motivation is to <br/>
<br/>
create something useful for the unschooling community, but I can&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
do it alone.  I don&#39;t have the contacts on my own.  Not even close, <br/>
<br/>
really.  I&#39;m a lurker, generally, posting only very rarely.  I&#39;ve <br/>
<br/>
been a member of the Uschooling-List for several years now and of <br/>
<br/>
the RUL for about a year or so.  I also belong to several smaller <br/>
<br/>
unschooling lists.  I prefer, usually, to read other&#39;s posts and <br/>
<br/>
glean from them useful information that meets my needs at the time.  <br/>
<br/>
And, I guess that&#39;s one of the reasons behind my creating of Live <br/>
<br/>
Free: Learn Free: it&#39;s a magazine that allows readers to get a <br/>
<br/>
glimpse of how others live and learn.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you would be willing to post this notice, I&#39;d be very grateful.  <br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t feel it meets the needs of your list members, just let <br/>
<br/>
me know.  Also, if you have any questions or would like anything <br/>
<br/>
clarified, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

LIVE FREE: LEARN FREE<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LIVE FREE: LEARN FREE is a new, soon-to-be-launched magazine.  In <br/>
<br/>
the tradition of John Holt&#39;s GROWING WITHOUT SCHOOLING (for <br/>
<br/>
information on this amazing magazine, please visit Fun Books (a site <br/>
<br/>
owned by a homeschooling family with whom LIVE FREE: LEARN FREE is <br/>
<br/>
not affiliated) at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fun-books.com/gws.htm)">http://www.fun-books.com/gws.htm)</a>, LIVE FREE: <br/>
<br/>
LEARN FREE strives to bring home educating families together by <br/>
<br/>
publishing articles, stories, and letters written by <br/>
<br/>
home/unschooling parents and children.  All content (except the <br/>
<br/>
introduction to each issue) will be written by readers and will <br/>
<br/>
focus on one or more themes.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LIVE FREE: LEARN FREE is looking for parents and children involved <br/>
<br/>
in home education, particularly unschooling or relaxed/eclectic <br/>
<br/>
homeschooling, to contribute to the first issue.  We&#39;ve decided to <br/>
<br/>
just dive right in and start with the &quot;Big S&quot;: Socialization.  It&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
usually the first concern relatives or well-meaning strangers voice, <br/>
<br/>
and it is often a deciding factor in a family&#39;s decision to educate <br/>
<br/>
their children at home.  It&#39;s a scary question, but does it have to <br/>
<br/>
be?  Send us stories of your own experiences, your thoughts on the <br/>
<br/>
importance or unimportance of socialization, what socialization has <br/>
<br/>
come to mean for you and your family, etc.  Anything goes.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, we&#39;d like to receive, on an ongoing basis, articles or <br/>
<br/>
letters about what works (or doesn&#39;t work) for you as home <br/>
<br/>
educators: lifestyle choices (such as bedtimes, chores, etc.), <br/>
<br/>
curriculum/non-curriculum choices, resources, etc., as well as <br/>
<br/>
glimpses into the days and ways of an unschooling family.  This will <br/>
<br/>
be a recurring section of the magazine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if there are changes occurring in your state&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
homeschooling laws, we want to hear about it.  You can use LIVE <br/>
<br/>
FREE: LEARN FREE as another forum to reach as many home educators in <br/>
<br/>
your state as possible.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is no monetary payment for contributors; however, each <br/>
<br/>
contributing writer will receive a free copy of the magazine.  <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, authors who request it will receive a frame-able <br/>
<br/>
certificate thanking them for their contribution to LIVE FREE: LEARN <br/>
<br/>
FREE (a great incentive for kids of all ages).  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please send all articles, stories, letters, etc. in the body of an <br/>
<br/>
email or in an attached Word document.  Hard copies of contributions <br/>
<br/>
may also be sent to our physical address for those without Internet <br/>
<br/>
access.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Though we strive to print as much as possible, unfortunately not <br/>
<br/>
every contribution will make it into LIVE FREE: LEARN FREE.  Whether <br/>
<br/>
we use your article or not, you will receive a response from the <br/>
<br/>
editors.  We hope to have enough material to print a stellar first <br/>
<br/>
issue within about a month; however, we have not set a firm <br/>
<br/>
deadline, as we don&#39;t know the amount of interest this notice will <br/>
<br/>
generate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are also looking for advertisers.  LIVE FREE: LEARN FREE is a <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
