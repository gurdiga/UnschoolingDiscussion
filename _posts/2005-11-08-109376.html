<div id="ygrps-yiv-296999376">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just subscribed to this list, although I have lurked on the list in<br/>
the past. I will say upfront that I am not an unschooler although I do<br/>
somewhat agree with the philosophy of unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I have been struggling with homeschooling my 8yob. I recently posted<br/>
about it on some traditional homeschooling discussion boards and I did<br/>
not recieve much help. Many of them struggle with similar issues but<br/>
no one has much in the way of solutions for the problems. I have come<br/>
to the conclusion that many homeschoolers &quot;live their lives in quiet<br/>
desperation&quot;. Anyhow, I would like to know how unschoolers would relpy<br/>
to the following post: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m about at my wits end with my son. He is 8 and a half and can<br/>
barely read at a 1st grade level. Schooling him is very difficult<br/>
because he has no desire to learn how to read. His sister is 18 months<br/>
younger and they are both doing Rod and Staff first grade but her<br/>
reading ability is at least 2nd grade level because she reads books on<br/>
her own initiative and comes to me to ask what a word is so she is<br/>
learning on her own. My son will not pick up a book and read it on his<br/>
own and he complains about the reading that I make him do.<br/>
<br/>
I have eight children (he&#39;s the only boy) and I have taught five of<br/>
them how to read. Some learned faster than others but they all had a<br/>
desire to learn. I simply do not know how to teach a child who doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to learn and frankly, the struggles with my son are ruining<br/>
homeschooling.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341468541">&lt;&lt;&quot;I&#39;m about at my wits end with my son. He is 8 and a half and can<br/>

<br/>
What if your husband wanted you to learn about auto mechanics and you had no<br/>
interest in it.  What if he made you sit down every day to try to teach you<br/>
about auto mechanics.  He might think that evryone drives cars and should<br/>
know the basics on how to care for them. How would you feel about him if he<br/>
forced you to sit for his auto mechanic lessons?  Had you even a tiny bit of<br/>
interests in one aspect of auto mechanics do you think his forcing you to<br/>
sit for lesson about it might drive that interest out of you?  Would you<br/>
willingly pick up books/vidoes on auto mechanics in your spare time after<br/>
your auto mechanic lessons?<br/>
<br/>
What it really boils down to is respecting where your son is now and what<br/>
his interests are.  Some children are truly not ready to learn to read at<br/>
8.5. (esp. boys) If he wasn&#39;t ready to walk yet at 12 months, would you make<br/>
him take walking lessons, or would you wait until he was ready and showed an<br/>
interest in walking and then support him?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;His sister is 18 months<br/>
younger and they are both doing Rod and Staff first grade but her<br/>
reading ability is at least 2nd grade level because she reads books on<br/>
her own initiative and comes to me to ask what a word is so she is<br/>
learning on her own.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really important to NOT compare your children.  Your son may end up<br/>
feeling resentment toward your dd because he cant&#39; keep up with her and your<br/>
dd may resent it as well.  Please don&#39;t compare them.  Even in school, in<br/>
the same class, there are children who can read and children who cannot read<br/>
at the same level or not at all.  The children who can&#39;t keep up with the<br/>
average get sent to remedial reading and often end up feeling stupid and<br/>
incapable of learning to read.  It can be traumatic.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; My son will not pick up a book and read it on his<br/>
own and he complains about the reading that I make him do.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids are now 9 and 10 and neither one of them reads books regularly.  It<br/>
is amazing to me how they have taught themselves to read however and how<br/>
they have continued to get better at it without ever reading a book.  They<br/>
read on the computer, and in stores, on boxes, and catalogs, email, etc.  My<br/>
9 yo has read one chapter book in her life and my 10 yo has not read any.<br/>
They are both good spellers and writers even though they don&#39;t enjoy reading<br/>
very much.  They still love to have me read to them.  They love books on<br/>
tape.  They have amazing vocabularies.  I am not writing this so you can<br/>
compare your child and think he isn&#39;t measuring up.  I am writing it to let<br/>
you know that reading will happen for him in time if you support his<br/>
interests; keep him surrounded with print and make reading a joyous thing.<br/>
Read to him often.  Help him write emails to his grandmas on his own email<br/>
account if he&#39;d like it.  Play games with him and help him when he needs<br/>
help reading for them.  Buy him magazine that are about his interests.  Read<br/>
them TO him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have eight children (he&#39;s the only boy) and I have taught five of<br/>
them how to read.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have two children that I helped to learn to read by answering their<br/>
questions and helping them when they wanted the help.  I take no credit for<br/>
teaching them.  They just learned and it was amazing to me.  They did it<br/>
when they were interested and at their own speed.  They are fine.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;Some learned faster than others but they all had a<br/>
desire to learn. I simply do not know how to teach a child who doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to learn and frankly, the struggles with my son are ruining<br/>
homeschooling.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you can teach someone anything that they aren&#39;t interested in.<br/>
It just doesn&#39;t work that way.  You can force them to memorize something for<br/>
the test, but it isn&#39;t real learning.  I say give him time and space.  And<br/>
he may need more time now after trying to force him before he was interested<br/>
and ready.  Good luck.<br/>

Unschoolers do not live their lives in quiet desperation.<br/>
If you&#39;re determined to be a homeschooler and to make yourself and your <br/>

yourself.<br/>

Frankly, discussing children in such terms as being a child who &quot;doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to learn&quot; will ruin the tone of this list.<br/>
<br/>
We CAN help you, if you want to change, but if you insist that your child is <br/>
just lazy and uncooperative, you will be doing him harm that this list should <br/>
not and cannot support or encourage.<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s NOT your writing, it&#39;s not good to have brought it here in a <br/>
confusing way.<br/>
If that IS your writing, why the quotation marks?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is exactly the problem schools have. When there is a  <br/>
requirement that children must read by a certain age, then it is a  <br/>
problem if they aren&#39;t reading by then.<br/>
<br/>
The following is going to be hard for you. It is going to turn all  <br/>
that you think you know about what kids need in order to learn upside  <br/>
down.<br/>
<br/>
If you remove the artificial requirement that he be reading now, then  <br/>
there is no problem. If you remove the necessity to learn only (or  <br/>
primarily) through reading, then there is no problem.<br/>
<br/>
Reading is not the be all and end all of learning. Other ways of  <br/>
learning are not distant seconds to reading.<br/>
<br/>
What reading is to learning is an efficient way for one teacher to  <br/>
get information into a room full of kids. Schools depend on kids  <br/>
reading *not* because it&#39;s best learning method but because it makes  <br/>
schools run efficiently. (Even teachers will say the best way to  <br/>
learn is by doing. And unschoolers would add doing what they love and  <br/>
are curious about. But can you imagine one teacher being able to  <br/>
manage a room full of kids learning by doing when she needs to  <br/>
demonstrate they learned x, y, and z by the end of the school year?)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no reason to try to recreate school at home when the methods  <br/>
schools use are meant primarily to make schools run and secondarily  <br/>
to show that learning is happening (happening long enough to be  <br/>
regurgitated for a test).<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers do not depend on reading for their kids to learn. *And  <br/>
unschooled kids learn just fine.* The learning that unschoolers do  <br/>
looks *different*. It looks like play. But it is not only just as  <br/>
effective, it&#39;s *more* because kids are absorbing what fascinates  <br/>
them in ways that are natural to their personalities.<br/>
<br/>
When kids are allowed to read when they want to, when they find it  <br/>
meaningful for them, when their brains are developmentally ready,  <br/>
when they have pleasant associations with reading then kids do learn  <br/>
to read. It happens usually between 6 and 8 but can be earlier and  <br/>
can be later. Thirteen is not an unusual age to learn to read. (Kids  <br/>
who learn at 13 are not 7 years behind in skills. They quickly are  <br/>
reading at age level.)<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time they are learning *just fine* in other ways:  <br/>
listening to people, talking, watching TV, listening to music, doing  <br/>
things hands on, *analyzing*, *making connections* and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My son will not pick up a book and read it on his<br/>
&gt; own and he complains about the reading that I make him do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you continue to make him read, continue to make the experience  <br/>
with books unpleasant for him, you will have the exact same problem  <br/>
schools do: he will either decide there&#39;s something wrong with him  <br/>
and he can&#39;t read, or he will decide that reading is dumb and he  <br/>
never wants to read.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have eight children (he&#39;s the only boy) and I have taught five of<br/>
&gt; them how to read.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what schools think they do too. But unschoolers don&#39;t teach  <br/>
their kids to read and their kids learn to read anyway. So there&#39;s  <br/>
something else going on.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s going on is that learning to read is no more difficult than  <br/>
learning to speak. (I suspect it&#39;s quite a bit easier!) Learning to  <br/>
read happens when reading is a natural, useful (to *them*) and  <br/>
unstressful part of their environment: signs, video games and gaming  <br/>
guides, stories, movies based on books, books on tape and so on and  <br/>
so on.<br/>
<br/>
This is just a guess but it seems to fit what unschoolers see with  <br/>
children. There seem to be a number of brain areas involved in  <br/>
reading. Not all of them mature at the same rate and those brain  <br/>
areas are also used for things other than reading. When a child isn&#39;t  <br/>
reading by 12 what makes sense is that one of those brain area is not  <br/>
ready. They&#39;ve been using the other brain areas involved in reading  <br/>
for other things so they&#39;re all up and running. And when that last  <br/>
brain area is mature then wham the kid&#39;s reading. It doesn&#39;t always  <br/>
happen that way, but it does for a fair number. For others it&#39;s more  <br/>
gradual but once they&#39;re brains are ready (and their experiences with  <br/>
reading have been positive) they go from not reading to reading at  <br/>
age level within a few months.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some learned faster than others but they all had a<br/>
&gt; desire to learn.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Girls tend to be more verbally oriented. They do on the whole tend to  <br/>
learn to read earlier than boys.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers would say look at who he is rather than who is is not and  <br/>
rather than holding him against the yardstick of who you want him to  <br/>
become. If you can look at him as being perfect at being 8 rather  <br/>
than an imperfect adult you will help both of you and your  <br/>
relationship and his learning tremendously. If you see that each day  <br/>
he is learning how to be 8 years + 1 day and then 8 years + 2 days  <br/>
until he&#39;s 9 and he will be a perfect 9 year old, then you won&#39;t be  <br/>
struggling against who he is right now.<br/>
<br/>
If you treat him as doing the best he can -- after a period of  <br/>
transition since he&#39;s been absorbing the message that he&#39;s not as  <br/>
good as you want him to be for a long time -- he will do the best he  <br/>
can. He will still make mistakes but they will be honest mistakes of  <br/>
a growing person who is trying to figure out the world.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I simply do not know how to teach a child who doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want to learn<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You and every teacher in school! They haven&#39;t solved it yet after  <br/>
hundreds? thousands? of years.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and frankly, the struggles with my son are ruining<br/>
&gt; homeschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not surprising. Lots of unschooler came to unschooling because they  <br/>
reached the point where they realized that making a child learn is  <br/>
not only impossible but turns mother and child into adversaries. If  <br/>
you wish to hold on to the necessity of teaching a child it would be  <br/>
better to send him to school so at least he could have a haven to  <br/>
come home to.<br/>

board.  You will be tempted to greet many posts with &quot;Yeah, but...&quot;, <br/>
which might be useful down the road *if you keep thinking about it*, but <br/>
won&#39;t be of much consolation now, unless you let them.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing I would recommend is for you to read the description of <br/>
the group on the website.  If you still find you only agree somewhat, <br/>
any advice you receive here will only be &quot;somewhat&quot; useful.  Nobody here <br/>
will be able to help you &quot;make&quot; your son read.  They can offer advice <br/>
for ways for you to relax that demand ... they can reassure you that he <br/>
will read as soon as he finds it necessary and important to what he is <br/>
doing ... they can counsel you that reading doesn&#39;t have to look like <br/>
decoding certain books on demand and doing grammar exercises.  They <br/>
won&#39;t help you &quot;school&quot; him -- buit they can help you UNschool yourself <br/>
-- and your son.  Is that the kind of help you are looking for?<br/>
<br/>

desperation.  Those who live in an unschooling way (and make no mistake <br/>
-- it becomes a LIFESTYLE if you do it properly) live in discovery and <br/>
happiness.<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER, the transition between the two can often be far more vexing <br/>
than school at home was in the first place, as you struggle with <br/>
everything you have ever been told, your children still do not <br/>
&quot;perform&quot;, and your husband wonders what the heck happened.  Once you <br/>
have fully made the jump, you can find a richness of existence, but it <br/>
usually does not come overnight.  SO be prepared! <br/>
<br/>
There will be rewards, but they won&#39;t look like your son begging to do <br/>
extra units in Rod and Staff.  They come in increased peace; a relaxing <br/>
of your fears; stronger, more healthy relationships;  less yelling; <br/>
excitement at finding connections between interests  -- that kind of thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, many homeschoolers *have* replied to similar posts.  If you <br/>
search the archives, you will find a wealth of advice, ranging from <br/>
Sandra&#39;s essays to others who chime in.  It has been written about quite <br/>
frequently.  This is a fairly common problem, and likely one of the top <br/>
reasons people look to unschooling.  So you are not alone!<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you want an answer you can start with right away.  I <br/>
don&#39;t have the post numbers at my fingertips, but just put &quot;read&quot; or <br/>
&quot;can&#39;t read&quot; or whatever in the search feature at the website, and you <br/>
will be given many helpful approaches.  Once you read them, you will be <br/>
able to ask specific questions.  Anybody have the link to Sandra&#39;s and <br/>
Joyce&#39;s pages about reading?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Schooling ANYONE is very difficult.  If you are &quot;lucky&quot;, you get a <br/>
compliant child who will &quot;go along&quot; with what you have been offering, <br/>
but if you are truly *blessed*, you get a child who questions, who <br/>
teaches YOU how to re-evaluate everything *you* have &quot;gone along&quot; with <br/>
... who challenges you to find a more meaningful way of learning, of <br/>

or I start getting edgy and reading cereal boxes, if that is all that is <br/>
handy (happened on our last camping trip when I forgot my book bag).  I <br/>
definitely need input on a frequent basis, but I would complain about <br/>
any reading anyone MADE me do.  I like to be able to choose what, when, <br/>
and how I read -- in frantic gulps, or leisurely sips.  Fiction or non.  <br/>
In the tub, while making dinner, or in the middle of the night because I <br/>
can&#39;t sleep.<br/>

and they *chose* to learn how to read.  Either they were ready and <br/>
really wanted it, or else they had nothing better to do.  Either your <br/>
son is *not* ready, or *doesn&#39;t* want it, or he *does* have something <br/>
better to do. <br/>
<br/>
Whatever his reason for resisting, you can&#39;t make him learn to read.  <br/>
Instead, you can find out what he *is* interested in, what he *is* ready <br/>
for, what he wishes he were doing instead.  Then you can see if there&#39;s <br/>
some way he would like you to be involved in that (providing materials, <br/>
playing with him, reading to him, whatever).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Some learned faster than others but they all had a<br/>
&gt;desire to learn. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your son also has a desire to learn.  It is your job to sit back, and <br/>
lovingly figure out WHAT he wants to learn if you want to be part of his <br/>
journey, or to at least get out of his way so he can accomplish what he <br/>
is after if you don&#39;t want to quash his own determination out of him.  <br/>
Love of learning is very difficult to restore.  Trust in a relationship <br/>
is fairly difficult to mend.  Backing off and seeing his direction and <br/>
fitting yourself in is WAY easier, and much more fulfilling in the long <br/>
run -- to both of you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I simply do not know how to teach a child who doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;want to learn <br/>

and certain compliant kids will allow it, or everyone can end up <br/>
frustrated and miserable and adversarial.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and frankly, the struggles with my son are ruining<br/>
&gt;homeschooling.&quot;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>

around.... the struggles with homeschooling are really ruining the <br/>
relationship with my son?!<br/>

 <br/>
This is a common problem among homeschoolers but it is not a problem for<br/>
unschoolers.  What I mean by this is that an unschooler would not be<br/>
pushing their 8 year old to read before he is ready, many homeschoolers<br/>
do.  I highly suggest that you give your son space and freedom and stop<br/>
pushing him to learn to read.  If you continue to push, it will probably<br/>
backfire.  Your son may eventually learn to read but he will not enjoy<br/>
it, thus will probably choose not to read as he gets older.  It will be<br/>
a constant battle for you until you can let go.  I know this first hand<br/>
because I let go and I promise you that it benefited everyone.  <br/>
 <br/>
Instead of pushing him to read, help him to appreciate reading!  You can<br/>
do this in several ways but make sure it is not contrived or coerced.<br/>
Your son will catch on if you do this with an agenda in mind and again<br/>
it will backfire.  I highly recommend that you read to him. Maybe he<br/>
loves Harry Potter or Star Wars.  Find a nice comfortable place to sit<br/>
and snuggle while you both escape into a fun and exciting world.  Also,<br/>
show him how enjoyable reading can be by reading yourself.  Do you read?<br/>
Do you get excited about a new book coming out?  Do you go to the<br/>
library and come home with a bag full of books?  Do you ever go to the<br/>
book store and buy your kids books?  Do you belong to a book group?   <br/>
 <br/>
I love to read and I admit that I have worked hard to instill a love of<br/>
reading in my kids.  I have never pushed them to &quot;learn to read&quot; instead<br/>
I have shown them how wonderful reading can be.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I simply do not know how to teach a child who doesn&#39;t<br/>
 </span></blockquote>want to learn and frankly, the struggles with my son are ruining<br/>
homeschooling.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Stop teaching your son.  Children are natural learners.  You may want to<br/>
read my favorite book by Frank Smith, &quot;The Book of Learning and<br/>
Forgetting&quot;.  He talks about how children learn to read.  You may find<br/>
it very helpful.<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck and try to relax a bit.  You should not be struggling with<br/>
your son.  Having your kids home with you should be enjoyable, if it is<br/>
not then something is not right. You may want to embrace more<br/>
unschooling philosophy into your lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002940480">**I&#39;m about at my wits end with my son. He is 8 and a half and can<br/>
barely read at a 1st grade level. Schooling him is very difficult<br/>
because he has no desire to learn how to read. His sister is 18 months<br/>
younger and they are both doing Rod and Staff first grade but her<br/>
reading ability is at least 2nd grade level because she reads books on<br/>
her own initiative and comes to me to ask what a word is so she is<br/>
learning on her own. My son will not pick up a book and read it on his<br/>
own and he complains about the reading that I make him do.<br/>
<br/>
I have eight children (he&#39;s the only boy)**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Susan --<br/>
<br/>
Shakespeare said &quot;comparisons are odious&quot;, but sometimes I can&#39;t resist <br/>
comparing my only child (a boy) with my friends&#39; children.  My son&#39;s <br/>
11.  At that age I read a lot, and I read big enormous adult books.  My <br/>
son isn&#39;t like me.  He reads a lot less than I do, and less complex <br/>
stuff than many of his peers.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, I had an encouraging conversation with some of my eclectic <br/>
homeschooling friends at the park.  Among my close circle of friends <br/>
(not a big enough sample to prove anything) it seems to be common for <br/>
girls to devour lots of books and for the boys (7 years - 11.5 ) to seem <br/>
to read only *comic books*.  My son is enthusiastic about reading <br/>
Garfield, Foxtrot, Calvin and Hobbes, Tintin, Asterix, and Star Wars <br/>
graphic novels.  The important part of that sentence to me is &quot;my son is <br/>
enthusiastic about reading&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It is absolutely normal for children to vary widely in when they start <br/>
reading.  (The way schools are designed does not acknowledge that <br/>
fact.)  I believe that pushing reading can badly confuse a child that <br/>
isn&#39;t ready.  Readiness depends on brain development.  (Also on eye <br/>
development -- I do have a friend whose 11 year old just learned to read <br/>
after having &quot;vision therapy&quot;.)  Brain and eyes and heart all have to be <br/>
ready for great reading skills to develop.<br/>
<br/>
My son really likes having me read to him (when he&#39;s not busy playing), <br/>
and listening to books on tape.  He finds that reading the text himself <br/>
interferes with his ability to visualize it.<br/>
<br/>
To encourage interest in reading without pushing, I&#39;d have really fun <br/>
books in the house (yes, comic strip books), and appealing magazines <br/>
that encourage browsing and looking at the pictures.  Some people have <br/>
found that sheet music (or printed lyrics) of a memorized song can help <br/>
support a developing reader.  But readiness is everything.  Kids who <br/>
aren&#39;t ready to read at the age reading lessons start in school can <br/>
really suffer and feel ashamed and miserable.  Please don&#39;t do that to <br/>
your son.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-420791133">Unfortunately you aren&#39;t unschooling. If you were unschooling you<br/>
could relax and enjoy your son doing activities that were fun to him<br/>
instead of needing him to achieve a certain level of reading<br/>
competence in order to do those activities a schooled life requires. <br/>
If you were unschooling your son (and your other 7 children) you<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be judging him based on a timetable that your other children<br/>
may or may not have adhered to.  If you were unschooling you wouldn&#39;t<br/>
spend hours trying to get him to love reading by forcing him to do<br/>
reading assignments, instead you could cuddle up with him and read<br/>
books, or read information to him from the internet that you thought<br/>
would interest him or that he&#39;d asked about. <br/>
<br/>
I can imagine how frustrating it must be for him to have his mother<br/>
telling him that he must read. I am sure he knows that his sister who<br/>
is 18 months younger is reading.  I imagine that makes him feel dumb.<br/>
 I am sure he knows that his not reading is frustrating to you.  Maybe<br/>
what you see as a lack of desire is less a lack of desire, and more a<br/>
passive rebellion.  When I have pushed Simon to do something he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to, he doesn&#39;t yell or freak out, he just shuts down: he<br/>
takes on what I would describe as a bored face, and crosses his arms<br/>
and looks away. And in that minute of gentle, absolute refusal my<br/>
first response is anger and frustration and then I laugh at myself and<br/>
I apologize for pushing him. But that took a while to get to. However,<br/>
it was never a lack of desire on his part, no matter how it felt in my<br/>
moments of frustration.  It was an unwillingness to continue mixed<br/>
with a feeling of powerlessness.  He couldn&#39;t stop my insistence, but<br/>
he could keep from being part of his own subjugation.  So, now, when I<br/>
find myself pushing him and I see him retreat into himself I back off<br/>
and I apologize and I change the subject.<br/>
<br/>
For whatever reason you&#39;ve decided not to unschool your children.  <br/>
However, I would suggest that you look at your son and look at all he<br/>
is capable of, including his reading.  Don&#39;t look at him in<br/>
comparison, don&#39;t look at him with a curriculum in mind, just look at<br/>
him as the person he is and find everything in him that you love.  And<br/>
next time he isn&#39;t all that you need him to be as you sit down to do<br/>
your Rod and Staff curriculum think about all that he is that is good<br/>
and that is wonderful. And maybe wonder if the Rod and Staff<br/>
curriculum isn&#39;t all you need it to be.<br/>

the lyrics, but they could see the format of the verses and see the first words <br/>
or last words.   It&#39;s a part of starting to read, and they were words they <br/>
really knew and liked.   They   understood clearly the purpose of having those <br/>
words.<br/>
<br/>
I would find the words to a cartoon show theme song (Ninja Turtles, I <br/>
remember doing) and would put them in large text and print them out.   When Disney <br/>
movies came out I would get the lyrics of the favorite song of the moment (Under <br/>
the Sea and A Whole New World I remember) and put them out on the counter in <br/>
the kitchen or something, and *I* would check those lyrics when we were trying <br/>
to sing them, so we could learn the words.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great when the parents do the reading, when the kids see parents reading <br/>
for fun and for practical purposes too.   In some families reading is a thing <br/>
kids are made to do, that parents don&#39;t do.    Kids don&#39;t want to do &quot;kid <br/>
things&quot; or forced things.   They want to do what adults do.<br/>
<br/>
The subject line of &quot;a child who doesn&#39;t want to learn&quot; bothers me deeply.<br/>
All children want to learn until and unless that desire is extinguished.<br/>
If a mother can show me a child who really &quot;doesn&#39;t want to learn&quot; I&#39;m pretty <br/>
sure I&#39;ll be able to point at the school or schooling that created that <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
Not wanting to have someone shame him with continuing things he doesn&#39;t <br/>
understand isn&#39;t the same as not wanting to learn.   Being sad because his mother <br/>
considers him someone who doesn&#39;t want to learn isn&#39;t the same as not wanting <br/>
to learn--not at first, anyway.   It can become that, and it will not be the <br/>
fault of the child.<br/>

and they *chose* to learn how to read.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think this is very important.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the problem with &quot;the child who doesn&#39;t want to learn&quot; (POOR BOY!! <br/>
This is repeated now thousands of times, in public) is that the mom believe she <br/>
has taught five children to read already.<br/>
What the mom has is five children who have LEARNED how to read.   Luckily for <br/>
them, and for her, they didn&#39;t ruin homeschooling, but happened to be ready <br/>
to learn to read while the mom was interested in feeling like it was something <br/>
they could not have learned without her.<br/>
<br/>
Now the effect on the son is that he is branded bad an wrong because of the <br/>
comparison.<br/>
<br/>
The effect on the mother is that she didn&#39;t see learning when it was there; <br/>
she saw teaching.<br/>
The effect on the five daughters is that they were made to believe that their <br/>
mother taught them to read.   Then they needed for her to teach them other <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
The effect on my own children of learning to read was that they *KNEW* if <br/>
they could figure reading out, nothing was going to be beyond their powers of <br/>
comprehension and discovery.<br/>

&gt;  want to learn and frankly, the struggles with my son are ruining<br/>
&gt;  homeschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would ask myself whether getting my son to read RIGHT NOW is worth <br/>
ruining homeschooing, introducing stress into the home, and damaging <br/>
our relationship. I recently read a book that I think was mentioned on <br/>
this list, Hold On To Your Kids by Gordon Neufeld. One thing I took <br/>
away from that book was that the relationship between parent and child <br/>
is more important than &quot;discipline.&quot; Neufeld recommends that if a <br/>
parent is having problems with a child&#39;s behavior, that the parent set <br/>
aside ideas of discipline and instead make an effort to connect more <br/>
fully with the child. He bases it on the idea that kids will learn <br/>
behavior from the people they identify with, and as parents, we want <br/>
that to be us. So strengthening the connection should be the goal, not <br/>
achieving certain kinds of compliance from a kid.<br/>
<br/>
It would be very hard for me to have a child of 8 or older who didn&#39;t <br/>
read (mine are still younger than that). I would worry, I&#39;m sure, that <br/>
he would never learn, that certain pleasures wouldn&#39;t be available to <br/>
him. I&#39;d worry about what others would think. I&#39;d be on this list, and <br/>
others, all the time, begging parents of kids who started reading when <br/>
they were 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 to tell me the stories again...&quot;one more <br/>
time, your kid is doing OK? Everybody, help me see how great he&#39;s <br/>
doing!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I would also try to avoid labeling him as a kid who &quot;didn&#39;t want to <br/>
learn.&quot; Is your son interested in other things, just not in learning to <br/>
read? Kids are learning all the time; what learning can you see <br/>
happening for him now? What is positive about your relationship? What <br/>
might happen if you set aside teaching him to read for six months, just <br/>
decided not to worry about it until X date, and watched how relaxing <br/>
that pressure on you and him affected your home life and relationship?<br/>
<br/>
I was worrying--foolishly, I knew at the time--a few months ago because <br/>
my 4 yo didn&#39;t seem as skilled at counting as other kids his age I <br/>
know. I had to discipline myself not to push the issue. And suddenly, <br/>
just lately, I&#39;m not even sure when or how, he started counting past <br/>
10, experimenting with addition, subtraction, and multiplication (&quot;if <br/>
each doll has two legs, how many legs do four dolls have?&quot; is a <br/>
question he spent some time working out last night). Kids&#39; progress in <br/>
assimilating skills is so often not linear; my son didn&#39;t go from being <br/>
able to count 2 things to being able to count 3 to being able to count <br/>
4. He went from being able to count 3 things to being able to count 12, <br/>
overnight. What connections might your son make in a relaxed atmosphere <br/>
of loving support? Could you give yourself and him a little time to <br/>
find out?<br/>
<br/>
If the struggles are ruining homeschooling, can you let the struggle <br/>
go, just for now?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s it! Learning how to read is very hard for him so he doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to do it and it is not at all enjoyable for him. He wants to<br/>
learn how to read but he doesn&#39;t want to work. <br/>
<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t have a problem with using a curriculum and giving my<br/>
children assignments (which is why I&#39;m not an unschooler) but I do<br/>
have a problem with making them do something that they don&#39;t at all<br/>
enjoy or otherwise get no benefit from. So, I also, don&#39;t think that<br/>
learning should be work, or at least not drudgery.<br/>
<br/>
But I want my son to learn how to read. I&#39;m afraid that if I just stop<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; him, that when other people find out he can&#39;t read they<br/>
will make a big deal about it. I&#39;m afraid that this will make him feel<br/>
dumb and damage his self-esteem. When he was younger it wasn&#39;t a<br/>
problem but now that he is older he is involved in outside activities<br/>
and they often require some ability to read (kids choir). <br/>
<br/>
At home, it is not a big deal. I have always emphasized that everybody<br/>
has things they are good at and things that are harder for them. He<br/>
doesn&#39;t have any problem with the fact that his younger sister can<br/>
read better than he can because HE knows how to invent things and<br/>
build things. Something she can&#39;t (or doesn&#39;t want) to do. To him this<br/>
is a more valuable skill than reading.<br/>
<br/>
I want him to learn how to read because it will allow him to do more<br/>
of the things he wants to do: learn about science and do science<br/>
experiments, play games on the computer that have instructions that<br/>
you have to read, read books that he is interested in. <br/>
<br/>
So how can I help him learn how to read? How can he learn how without<br/>
it being work?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121783809">** So how can I help him learn how to read? How can he learn how without<br/>
it being work?**<br/>
<br/>
 From all the learning that I have done about learning, I have come to <br/>
believe that humans have a powerful built-in ability to learn.  <br/>
Forced-drill learning, like a lot of us have experienced in schools, is <br/>
a very poor way to learn. It has a high forgetting rate, and many nasty <br/>
side-effects.<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling approach to reading is about waiting for interest and <br/>
readiness to develop, and then supporting and facilitating the child in <br/>
whatever way he asks for.  (Reading to him, answering if he wants to <br/>
know how to spell something, sounding out XPRZNT if he spells that with <br/>
fridge magnets...)<br/>
<br/>
When he&#39;s ready, a child can *learn* to read with books and generally <br/>
with assistance (from parent or sibling), but it isn&#39;t *teaching* that <br/>
causes learning.  We can&#39;t rub knowledge onto the outsides of our <br/>
children and have it sink in.  The process of learning takes place <br/>
inside their minds, and they control how it works.  (Both consciously <br/>
and unconsciously.)<br/>

<br/>
Contradictions aside, if he isn&#39;t ready to learn to read it doesn&#39;t matter <br/>
whether he wants to or doesn&#39;t want to. Reading doesn&#39;t come from desire.   It <br/>
will come naturally when all other factors are in place.<br/>
<br/>
That might sound wrong to you; teachers assure people that reading is NOT <br/>
natural, because they like to feel like experts, and like to feel that without <br/>
teachers, the entire world would be illiterate.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re wrong.<br/>
<br/>
As to choir needs, he can sing without knowing how to read, and he can learn <br/>
lyrics without knowing how to read, because YOU can read.    How do <br/>
&quot;pre-schoolers&quot; learn to sing?   They sing.    <br/>
<br/>
Holly was in an acting class and was assured by her teacher (who was wrong) <br/>
that if she couldn&#39;t read, she couldn&#39;t act.   Holly knew there were actors who <br/>
couldn&#39;t read.   She knew about babies and toddlers, but what she didn&#39;t know <br/>
was that even some adult actors are so dyslexic and so school-damaged that <br/>
they get help with their scripts.)<br/>
<br/>
From an article called Three Readers that was in Live Free Learn Free <br/>
magazine, about Holly, quoting myself until this line comes again<br/>
-----------------------<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s a girl, and girls are verbal, and girls read earlier, I thought.   By <br/>
eight, when Kirby had been reading, Holly wasn&#39;t even nearly so.   By nine, <br/>
when Marty had read, nothing. I wasn&#39;t as worried as I would&#39;ve been had she <br/>
been my first, and that was good for her.   At ten, though, Holly started to <br/>
worry because other homeschoolers she knew were reading and she wasn&#39;t.   Younger <br/>
kids were reading.   One family was using her as a bad example (&quot;You need to <br/>
do these lessons so you won&#39;t turn out like Holly, who can&#39;t even read&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
A couple of incidents greatly expanded what I had known before, though, and <br/>
have changed my entire view of late readers.   Holly was in a summer dance and <br/>
theatre &quot;camp,&quot; a five day all-day set of sessions.   I told the teachers she <br/>
wasn&#39;t a reader and requested they not ask her to read aloud.   They were <br/>
using the book Barn Dance for the production, so we bought a copy a couple of days <br/>
before, and I read it to her several times. By the performance, some kids <br/>
hadn&#39;t memorized their assigned verse, but Holly had memorized hers and everyone <br/>
else&#39;s too.   (The same thing happened in a play later.   She couldn&#39;t be <br/>
dependent on a script she couldn&#39;t read, and ended up memorizing the whole thing.)<br/>
<br/>
Later that year, she joined girl scouts, and I told the leaders she wasn&#39;t <br/>
reading.   A schooled friend of hers offered to help her, but the &quot;help&quot; <br/>
consisted mostly of reminding the other girls and Holly that she, the friend, had to <br/>
help Holly read.    Because that was the first time in their lives the friend <br/>
had been a step ahead of her, Holly let it slide. .   There was a presentation <br/>
for parents one night.   While the other kids were reading off paper, <br/>
mispronouncing “Juliet Lowe,” mumbling and covering their faces, Holly&#39;s portion of <br/>
the program was clear, involved eye contact and her own words<br/>
<br/>
When she was eleven, I wrote this: <br/>
Holly wasn&#39;t reading at ten. She wasn&#39;t happy about it, either. She is at the <br/>
point now where she is reading words without meaning to. For fun she tries to <br/>
walk around the house without recognizing any words. At eleven, she&#39;s still <br/>
not reading chapter books. But if you met her and talked to her you wouldn&#39;t <br/>
think for a second, &quot;I bet this kid doesn&#39;t even read,&quot; because there&#39;s not much <br/>
she can&#39;t talk about, and if she knows nothing about it but it sounds <br/>
interesting, she&#39;ll ask intelligent questions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Though Holly wasn&#39;t reading, her vocabulary was sophisticated and she was <br/>
fascinated by the history of and connectedness of words.   When she did start to <br/>
read, she had no reason to use easy books.   She was still eleven when she did <br/>
her first real reading, a Judy Blume novel.    She read two of those, and <br/>
moved on to Steven King&#39;s novelette The Body.   <br/>
<br/>
When she had only been reading a couple of months, we were sitting down to <br/>
watch &quot;TheTwilight Zone,&quot; Holly reached over to move the Tank Girl comic books <br/>
she had been reading.   One was called &quot;The Odyssey.&quot;   Then the DVD menu came <br/>
up, and one of the episodes was &quot;The Odyssey of Flight 33.&quot;   She commented on <br/>
it, and I said &quot;You saw the word &#39;odyssey&#39; twice in an hour?   Cool!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;I saw the word &#39;odyssey&#39; twice in one MINUTE!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------<br/>
<br/>
Holly is fourteen now (fourteen now (as of last Wednesday) and you would <br/>
never, ever know she &quot;read late&quot; if you met her, talked with her, or she discussed <br/>
what she was reading or had cause to read something aloud.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than press your son to do what he&#39;s not ready to do, you could ask <br/>
that he bring the sheetmusic home, and go through it with him so he will know his <br/>
lines.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003592399">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt; One way to rethink that phrase (in my mind) is to say that he&#39;s &quot;a<br/>
child <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; who doesn&#39;t think learning should be work&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s it! Learning how to read is very hard for him so he doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to do it and it is not at all enjoyable for him. He wants to<br/>
learn how to read but he doesn&#39;t want to work. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you missed the point of the rephrase which is that learning should<br/>
NOT be work - certainly not made into work by imposed teachings. It should<br/>
be joyful and seamless and effortless when the learner is truly ready.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; he doesn&#39;t want to do it..... He wants to learn how to read&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well he either does or he doesn&#39;t...I still think it is YOU wanting him to<br/>
read now. Then you will be freed from having to read the interesting stuff<br/>
that fulfills his desires to him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; But I want my son to learn how to read. I&#39;m afraid that if I just stop<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; him, that when other people find out he can&#39;t read they<br/>
will make a big deal about it. I&#39;m afraid that this will make him feel<br/>
dumb and damage his self-esteem. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Really? HIS self esteem - or yours? Your parenting being judged by the<br/>
others in your school-at-home community...might that not be the real<br/>
underlying issue? <br/>
<br/>
Many of us have been there btw, especially from people who don&#39;t get<br/>
Unschooling. My answer has been to cleave more to the much smaller community<br/>
of real Unschoolers around me, and step away from the negative judgmental<br/>
folk.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; make him feel dumb and damage his self-esteem&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As compared to being basically judged as lazy &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; but he doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
work&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by the most important person in his life - his mother.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; I want him to learn how to read because it will allow him to do more<br/>
of the things he wants to do: learn about science and do science<br/>
experiments, play games on the computer that have instructions that<br/>
you have to read, read books that he is interested in. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Those computer games are paths to reading that many parents have observed<br/>
their children joyfully taking - without the lessons.<br/>
<br/>
Why aren&#39;t you reading to him from these sources? He doesn&#39;t NEED to read<br/>
right now to get all the learning and interests and fun that he wants, IF<br/>
you (or one of his sisters) would be willing to read TO him (ie on his<br/>
behalf) for the time being. Are you expecting him to be reading some &quot;learn<br/>
to read&quot; boring garbage from your curriculum before being permitted to use<br/>
the other interesting TO HIM materials?<br/>
<br/>
Imagine if you needed reading glasses, and accidentally broke them. Until a<br/>
new pair could be purchased, wouldn&#39;t the loving family members want to help<br/>
by reading for you? People would not be judging you for not being able,<br/>
physically, to read - and they would know it was temporary.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; So how can I help him learn how to read? How can he learn how without<br/>
it being work? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By you backing off, reading anything HE wants to know the content of for<br/>
him, allowing him all the time he wants to play on the computer.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll jump in and save Sandra Dodd the trouble of posting a link! Her <br/>
website has a great story about her daughter Holly doing well--in some <br/>
ways better than kids who were reading--in a setting that &quot;required <br/>
some ability to read.&quot; This story has really stayed with me since I <br/>
first read it some time ago: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/r/hollydodd">http://sandradodd.com/r/hollydodd</a><br/>
<br/>
A local barbershop group has members who can&#39;t read music. They <br/>
practice their parts at home from tapes the director makes for them. <br/>
Unless your son is in a choir that regularly sight-reads words and <br/>
music, I can&#39;t see how reading would be necessary. Perhaps a little <br/>
planning and support will be needed. You might need to work with the <br/>
choir director. Perhaps reading along in the music to words he has <br/>
already memorized will be one tool he uses as he learns to read.<br/>
<br/>
Your son won&#39;t feel ashamed of not reading yet unless someone teaches <br/>
him to be ashamed. Be careful that someone isn&#39;t you.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t let people make a big deal out of it (you are already making a <br/>
big deal out of it, and may get exactly the outcome you don&#39;t want). I <br/>
think it is also in Sandra Dodd&#39;s reading section that a mom talks <br/>
about how she matter-of-factly deflected pressure from others for her <br/>
son who was not yet reading, and how people were willing to follow her <br/>
lead in treating it as a perfectly OK thing. People sometimes want to <br/>
make a big deal out of my four-year-old sucking his thumb; it they <br/>
start to talk about it in front of him, I just put my hand on his <br/>
shoulder and say firmly, &quot;Eric&#39;s thumb-sucking is between him and his <br/>
thumb.&quot; If they persist (&quot;aren&#39;t you worried about his teeth? about it <br/>
destroying the bones of his face?&quot; or whatever), I say, &quot;excuse us,&quot; <br/>
and lead Eric away. I won&#39;t let him be shamed.<br/>
<br/>
If you really can&#39;t let go of the idea of teaching reading, you might <br/>
want to read &quot;Read Right: Coaching Your Child to Excellence in Reading&quot; <br/>
by Dee Tadlock. It&#39;s a very flawed book from an unschooling <br/>
perspective, but it approaches the teaching of reading from the <br/>
standpoint of how kids who learn to read without instruction do it. I <br/>
found the first half of the book, laying out research on how fluent <br/>
readers read and how self-learners do it, very helpful. The second <br/>
half, that creates a teaching method based on how people who learn to <br/>
read without teachers do it, was not so helpful to me, though I do love <br/>
a good irony (smile). But it might give you some ideas about creating <br/>
an environment of rich opportunity for your son to continue learning to <br/>
read (because I&#39;m sure he is already somewhere on the reading <br/>
continuum) without formal lessons, more enjoyably and less pressured <br/>
for both of you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-296784916">There has been a lot of responses on this already but I don&#39;t think <br/>
it has been mentioned that there are a lot of unschooled children <br/>
who didn&#39;t learn to read until 10, 11, 12, or even later that are <br/>
whole, healthy, happy kids (and adults).  My son is 10 and doesn&#39;t <br/>
know how to read, he is slowly getting the hang of it though.  I am <br/>
summoned SEVERAL times a day to read things for him and I do so <br/>
without any put downs or frustration and by doing that he is slowly <br/>
picking it up.  Every once in a while he will bring me a beginner <br/>
reader book and he will want to try and read a couple of pages so I <br/>
know eventually he WILL learn how to read but what difference does <br/>
it make whether he learns how to read at 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or <br/>
13!!???  My son learns the things that are important to him without <br/>
knowing how to read because he has people around him that love and <br/>
care about him and help him with the necessary resources.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is, and it has already been mentioned several times, you <br/>
CAN&#39;T teach something to somebody who doesn&#39;t want to learn it.  It <br/>
is IMPOSSIBLE, all you will do is destroy your relationship with <br/>
him!!!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t quote me on this, but I read that Denmark doesn&#39;t send their <br/>
children to compulsory school until age 8, so they are basically <br/>
getting no &quot;academics&quot; until age 8, and they have virtually no <br/>
illiteracy in their country.  Maybe, just maybe we are trying to <br/>
shove academics down our children a little too early, and I am <br/>
speaking in terms of public school, obviously, not unschooling.<br/>

***I am 32 years old and I don&#39;t like to do things that are not at all enjoyable for me. Can&#39;t you just wait until he wants to learn to read? Let him play his video games, he will catch on to the reading thing fairly quick. Mine did. Buy comic books, graphic novels and the like. My son, Jack is 9.5 he loves to read Shonen Jump. It has episodes of all different Japanese anime in each issue. But if I had a curriculum with set books to read at set times and ages, I know Jack wouldn&#39;t read at all. It wouldn&#39;t be what he is interested in or what he cares about. Do you read things that don&#39;t interest you or that you don&#39;t care about? My husband and daughter love science fiction, I don&#39;t touch most of it. Give me a good detective or medical novel and I&#39;m happy, combine the two and I&#39;m in heaven. True stories, historical fiction, I&#39;m all over it. Anime and manga, don&#39;t care for it or understand much of it, but I see the art in it, I see the time and creativity. Just because it is or isn&#39;t in<br/>
 a curriculum doesn&#39;t mean it is or isn&#39;t worth reading. And just because someone isn&#39;t reading at 8, doesn&#39;t mean he won&#39;t be reading at 9 or 10 or 13 or even two weeks from now. Maybe the curriculum doesn&#39;t interest him? Why don&#39;t you just put it away and wait until he finds something that he is captured by and then he will learn to read because he is ready.***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t have a problem with using a curriculum and giving my<br/>
children assignments (which is why I&#39;m not an unschooler) but I do<br/>
have a problem with making them do something that they don&#39;t  at all<br/>
enjoy or otherwise get no benefit from.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
***I guess on an unschooling list this statement won&#39;t get you too far, because all I can see, advice wise coming from this list, is throw the curriculum away. If he isn&#39;t enjoying it, isn&#39;t benefiting from it, why keep at it?***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I want my son to learn how to read. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*** He will, on his own, in his own time, when he is ready.***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I want him to learn how to read because it will allow him to do more<br/>
of the things he wants to do: learn about science and do science<br/>
experiments, play games on the computer that have instructions that<br/>
you have to read, read books that he is interested in. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
***When he really wants to do those things, and sees that he needs to be able to read to accomplish some of the more intricate games, and experiments then he will learn to read. In the mean time can&#39;t you just read to him?***<br/>
<br/>
So how can I help him learn how to read? How can he learn how without it being work?<br/>

***You can&#39;t, and it won&#39;t not be work. You can help him to be ready to read by making all of his opportunities  meaningful to him. And sometime in the next few weeks or months or years he will read. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053197245">&lt;&lt;I want him to learn how to read because it will allow him to do more<br/>
of the things he wants to do: learn about science and do science<br/>
experiments, play games on the computer that have instructions that<br/>
you have to read, read books that he is interested in. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He can learn about science by watching the Science channel, working with<br/>
animals, playing games, playing in a pond, etc.  With you at his side<br/>
answering his questions and reading for him, there is nothing he can&#39;t learn<br/>
even though he can&#39;t read.  He&#39;s only 8.  My kids learned a lot of words<br/>
while playing games on the computer.  After they asked enough times, they<br/>
just knew them.  The Sims, Zoo Tycoon, and Roller coaster Tycoon were their<br/>
favorite games that involved a lot of reading.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So how can I help him learn how to read? How can he learn how without<br/>
it being work?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By helping him to read the things he WANTS to read, like computer games and<br/>
magazines, comics, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
There is so much to think about that has been suggested on this list, it can<br/>
be overwhelming.  I really hope you can relax and take it all in without<br/>
feeling defensive. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-446919658">Angela is absolutely correct.    It is not AT ALL  unusual for children to<br/>
be 9 or 10 years old before they  learn to read or have an interest in<br/>
putting effort into the task.     But if they have developed an aversion or<br/>
internalized really confusing &quot;stuff&quot;  because they were forced before they<br/>
were developmentally ready,   then they may well be older before starting<br/>
and will also take longer to develop competency.     Of course, even some<br/>
who are not forced will not focus on it until older than 10 anyway. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It has been my strongly held belief for decades that we cause a lot of our<br/>
&quot;reading disabilities&quot;   or  &quot;permanently behind grade level&quot;  readers by<br/>
the recent obsession of &quot;teaching&quot;   reading starting in kindergarten (or<br/>
even younger).      <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That said,  yes I do understand that it can be scary in a book oriented home<br/>
to have a child not finding pleasure or competence in reading.  When my<br/>
older son went from non reading at age 9 to high school level by age 10,<br/>
it seems I &quot;should&quot;  have learned something.   But when his brother was also<br/>
a &quot;late&quot; (by SOME  folks standards)  reader,   I still worried.     Worrying<br/>
may be just the nature of mommies,  but it really is in our children&#39;s best<br/>
interests to not let that worrying push us into pushing them!. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Since your son already has a reading aversion and probably considers himself<br/>
not quite smart .....your task is to assure him that the time will come and<br/>
he will be able to read even better than his current age peers.  And that in<br/>
the meantime you are available to help him with ways to &quot;compensate&quot;  for<br/>
him not having that particular skill yet.     For example,  reading to him<br/>
or answering questions or getting audio tapes.    Don&#39;t mistake  forcing<br/>
teaching sessions on him as &quot;helping&quot;.   He is a child who wants to<br/>
learn.....but learning to read may not be what he needs at present.     How<br/>
unfortunate to place that as a barrier preventing him access to <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Vicki<br/>
<br/>
P.S.:  You could utilize the time that is  freed up for both him and<br/>
yourself by doing away with   reading &quot;lessons&quot;  for him  by instead having<br/>
lots of reading sessions for yourself (if that IS  a means that YOU  learn<br/>
by)   in order to come to an understanding and, more importantly,  an<br/>
internalized belief,   that what is needed for your son to learn is for you<br/>
to stop putting obstacles in his path.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
P.P.S.:  That sounded harsher than I really meant.  It IS  hard,<br/>
particularly if your own experience was reading early and enjoying reading,<br/>
But to label as a child as &quot;doesn&#39;t want to learn&quot;   is extremely harsh. <br/>

<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t have a problem with using a curriculum and giving my<br/>
children assignments (which is why I&#39;m not an unschooler)<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Clue #1----NOT an unschooler and doesn&#39;t WANT to be.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
But I want my son to learn how to read. I&#39;m afraid that if I just stop<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; him, that when other people find out he can&#39;t read they<br/>
will make a big deal about it. I&#39;m afraid that this will make him feel<br/>
dumb and damage his self-esteem.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Clue #2---it&#39;s about mom, NOT the child. I think his self-esteem is damaged already. He already feels dumb---<br/>
at least dumber than his sister.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
At home, it is not a big deal. I have always emphasized that everybody<br/>
has things they are good at and things that are harder for them. He<br/>
doesn&#39;t have any problem with the fact that his younger sister can<br/>
read better than he can because HE knows how to invent things and<br/>
build things. Something she can&#39;t (or doesn&#39;t want) to do.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Clue #3. Do you make HER invent and build things? &#39;Cause THAT&#39;s a pretty important skill to have!<br/>
Comparison&#39;s OK. Contrasting&#39;s NOT?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
I want him to learn how to read because it will allow him to do more<br/>
of the things he wants to do: learn about science and do science<br/>
experiments, play games on the computer that have instructions that<br/>
you have to read, read books that he is interested in. <br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
Clue #4. It&#39;s not about the LEARNING. It&#39;s about the READING.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So how can I help him learn how to read? How can he learn how without<br/>
it being work?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Clue #5. Learning is play. AND learning IS work. But the work is worth it if you want it enough. In fact, <br/>
that hard work is pleasurable!<br/>
 <br/>
You use Rod and Staff, so I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re Christian. <br/>
You&#39;ll listen to others more than you listen to your own children.  <br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone else is understanding where you&#39;re coming from. You DON&#39;T want to become an unschooler.<br/>
You want to know how to get him to read.<br/>
OK. My suggestion will probably work in your situation.<br/>
 <br/>
Ban reading. Forbid it.<br/>
 <br/>
His trust in you is broken already. If you forbid it---don&#39;t allow it in any way, shape or form, I&#39;m <br/>
pretty sure he&#39;ll jump right on it as most kids who have such restrictions do.<br/>
 <br/>
No more reading. Until he&#39;s 16. THEN he&#39;ll be allowed to read what *you* pick out for him.<br/>

I say she doesn&#39;t have to ban all the kids. Since she has 7 girls and only one boy, and since she compares all the girls to her only boy all the time (evident even in her email address *mommyof7+1* or what ever it is), then by baning only him from reading will be *terribly* effective. IMHO<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-631043709">This is exactly why my now 14 year old son didn&#39;t read until he was 12.<br/>
What he wanted to learn couldn&#39;t be done with books for beginner readers.<br/>
Even at 7 and 8, his interests were way beyond beginner reader books. He<br/>
quite literally didn&#39;t want to read, and didn&#39;t see a need to read at that<br/>
point. In fact, he hated those beginner reader books.  We would get the<br/>
books he wanted from the library and he would pore over illustrations and I<br/>
would read them to him. He could understand them, just not read them. It was<br/>
too hard to try to read at that level. We also did LOTS of books on tape<br/>
(still do) and used our cable tv, videos, local museums, and whatever else<br/>
seemed appropriate. This boy learned massive amounts of stuff he was<br/>
interested without reading a single word. Then he discovered Pokemon and all<br/>
their related guide books. Now that was a reason to read!!  He reads with no<br/>
problem. He is not particularly interested in reading fiction, he would<br/>
rather do fiction in audio form. But if he needs information, he can read<br/>
anything he wants now.<br/>
