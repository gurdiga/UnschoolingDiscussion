  Tales and legends of the many American Indian tribes have long fascinated<br/>
  children. Their stories are an integral part of the nation&#39;s history, as is<br/>
  the inhumane treatment by settlers headed west and the U.S. government.<br/>
  Several new books for children explore the traditions, ways of life and<br/>
  legends of these tribes. <br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Navajo Long Walk: The Tragic Story of a Proud People&#39;s Forced March From<br/>
  Their Homeland,&quot; by Joseph Bruchac (National Geographic Books, $18.95),<br/>
  explains how the government forced the Navajo in the 1860s from their land,<br/>
  Dinetah, in northern Arizona to an isolated reservation. <br/>
<br/>
  Author Bruchac recalls the history of the Navajo people and tells what led to<br/>
  Kit Carson&#39;s Army raid of the canyon, which destroyed homes, crops and the<br/>
  harmony that is the guiding force of the Navajo people. <br/>
<br/>
  Shonto Begay, a Navajo, created striking illustrations for the book that<br/>
  reveal the hardships of his people during this little-known time. In 1863,<br/>
  1864 and 1866, groups of Navajo, numbering in the thousands, were forced by<br/>
  Army troops to walk 470 miles from Fort Defiance in eastern Arizona to Fort<br/>
  Sumner west of Albuquerque, N.M. Those too sick or weak to keep up were left<br/>
  behind to die. Once at Fort Sumner, food was scarce and other bands of Indians<br/>
  raided their livestock. <br/>
<br/>
  Following the Civil War, public opposition to the terrible conditions at the<br/>
  Navajo reservation forced the government to allow the people to return to<br/>
  their homeland, Bruchac explains. <br/>
<br/>
  Two traditional tales of the Lakota people are recounted by Paul Goble in &quot;The<br/>
  Return of the Buffaloes&quot; and &quot;The Legend of the White Buffalo Woman&quot; (National<br/>
  Geographic, $7.95 each). <br/>
<br/>
  In &quot;The Return,&quot; Goble explains that for the nomadic peoples of the High<br/>
  Plains, &quot;the buffalo was a gift from the Great Spirit, and supplied almost<br/>
  everything material which they needed.&quot; When the herds wandered far away,<br/>
  famine resulted. <br/>
<br/>
  Goble has adapted the Lakota myth of the mysterious woman who brings back the<br/>
  buffalo. &quot;She is one of the Buffalo People sent . . . to tell humankind of<br/>
  their great love and the gift of themselves so that people can live.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
  &quot;The Blue Roses&quot; by Linda Boyden, a Cherokee, is a contemporary native<br/>
  American story about the special relationship between a young girl, Rosalie,<br/>
  and her grandfather, who plants a rosebush the day she is born. As she grows,<br/>
  he teaches her about gardening and comforts her when seeds she sows die.<br/>
  &quot;Everything has its time to die. New or old, it doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Rosalie&#39;s<br/>
  grandfather explains. <br/>
<br/>
  When the old man dies, Rosalie dreams of a garden with a trellis of beautiful<br/>
  blue roses, a vision that shows her how to keep her grandfather in her heart<br/>
  forever. The book is beautifully illustrated by Amy Cordova, with the Indian<br/>
  characters and settings in bold primary colors (Lee and Low Books, $16.95). <br/>
