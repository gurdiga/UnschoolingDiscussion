<div id="ygrps-yiv-593844426">First it was to the store to pick out some treats to enjoy with some <br/>
new uschooling friends that were coming over for a visit.  Dd (7) <br/>
decided strawberries with cream would be nice. My children had not <br/>
yet met these 2 children that were coming over, they were very <br/>
excited.<br/>
<br/>
Dropped oldest dd (15) at the libary, she came home with more books <br/>
then she could comfortably carry.  My sons (12 & 9) were playing <br/>
a card game all morning.<br/>
<br/>
Our new friends arrived, and it took about uhmmmm....2 seconds for <br/>
the children to feel comfortable with each other.  They were off and <br/>
playing, and the mother and I sat and had a cup of tea while the two <br/>
young girls happily cut out snow flakes and played barbie, and turned <br/>
cart-wheels while listening to N&#39;Sync.  My boys showed their new <br/>
friend a card game he did not know.  They had fun. <br/>
<br/>
After our guest went home, my boys played some of their Monkey Island <br/>
game, it is full of problems and puzzles.  One son asked me what <br/>
ipecac is.  I told him, he understood.  He said it helped him figure <br/>
out one of the puzzles, and he now knows how to spell it. Bonus!( <br/>
I had to look it up.)<br/>
<br/>
Cut more snowflakes with dd, and then dinner.  After dinner, ds&#39;s <br/>
wanted to look up on the internet, some of the cards they are <br/>
currently  collecting.  We wondered why some are so different after <br/>
they are translated from Japanese to English, or more correctly <br/>
American. That was a fun conversation.  From looking up those cards <br/>
together we ended up on many tangents, from greek mythology to celtic <br/>
history.  It was very cool. More dots for us to make connections <br/>
with.  I think what they learned will be with them a long time, and <br/>
no boring text book lesson was needed. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Later that night, because we had so much paper out for the <br/>
snowflakes, one son started folding it and the other son said *hey <br/>
don&#39;t we have a origami book around here....Yeah here it is.*  So <br/>
they made a boat, bug, T-rex, turtles and something else.  Then they <br/>
got into minitures, cutting the paper so small I really have no idea <br/>
how they were able to fold it. My youngest son, who never tried <br/>
origami before really enjoyed it and he started out with some of the <br/>
harder folds. I did not know he could do that.  I can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest son (12) has asked me twice if we could look into a <br/>
computer program that helps you learn Japanese.  You never know where <br/>
thing can lead.....<br/>
<br/>
Over all it was a really great day full of living and learning.  I <br/>
could not have planned it any better, if I tried.  All I had to do <br/>
was be there and interested in them.  That is easy, I love them and <br/>
do not have to pretend to be interested ....ok.... sometimes I do <br/>
have to pretend, like when barbie or N&#39;Sync are the topic, but today <br/>
she had a friend over who was really interested in that stuff.<br/>
