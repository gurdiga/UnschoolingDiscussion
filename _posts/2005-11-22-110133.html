<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<time>22 Nov 2005, at 11:00am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-645430211">Hey all....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading the unschooling blogs from other unschoolers and I&#39;m really enjoying it.  I though I&#39;d start my own so others can read &quot;typical days&quot; and such.<br/>
<br/>
You can find ours at:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://learningbitsandpieces.blogspot.com/">http://learningbitsandpieces.blogspot.com/</a>  Ours isn&#39;t part of the unschooling webring yet because you have to have one for awhile before you can join, but I hope to join later.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you guys want to start your own too!  I like journaling anyway.  Its fun to look back and see what you&#39;ve been up to.  And its very affirming too.<br/>
<br/>
