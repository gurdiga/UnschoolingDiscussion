&lt;&lt; Does anyone have any miracle remedies for me?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I take massive doses of Garlic and an echinacea supplement that has Reisi <br/>
mushroom and Astragulus with it. Take triple what the bottle says on the <br/>
first day, then double for a few days.<br/>
I&#39;m usually better within a day or two.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
