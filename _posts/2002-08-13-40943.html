Diane answered:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There is a pre-unschooling list on Yahoo, but it&#39;s all full of<br/>
&gt; curricula, plans and schedules. I&#39;m planning to unsub, but haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; gotten around to it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; :-) Diane<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks Diane. Exactly my point. Nancy&#39;s problems seemed to have little<br/>
connection to this list (even though we keep hearing that anything goes, and<br/>
yet I&#39;ve been criticized for being off topic)  so I&#39;m still trying to<br/>
discover what the real topic is, if any.<br/>
<br/>
For me, Unschooling is not an activity, but a decision not to school our<br/>
children -- not to do to them what schools do to them. Now I&#39;ll admit that<br/>
that is either an incredibly broad topic that includes all forms of<br/>
childcare (in which case I understand why there are mostly women on board)<br/>
or it is a narrower topic, the one that concentrates on how parents need to<br/>
unlearn their belief in the necessity for schooling. ( I was once one of<br/>
those people)<br/>
<br/>
Luz and I, long ago, went to support group meetings for homeschooling. At<br/>
the meetings the discussion was mostly about which curriculum they used.<br/>
Nothing wrong with that, but it didn&#39;t help us unschoolers, and most of the<br/>
members couldn&#39;t imagine taking John Holt at his word, and not using school<br/>
books and schedules and a notice of intent, and the rest. Luz and I wanted<br/>
the least possible connection to schools and/or formal schooling.<br/>
<br/>
So, we finally stopped going to the meetings, and while the people remained<br/>
our friends, they perceived us as weird for unschooling, even though they<br/>
were pariahs in their neighborhoods for not sending their kids to the zombie<br/>
jamboree down at the corner.<br/>
<br/>
And Diane now tells us that there&#39;s a list that takes the irony a step<br/>
further by calling itself pre-unschooling (!) and then entertains talk about<br/>
pre-schooling -- the exact opposite --  with the same ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Some of you see my quandary, I&#39;m sure. I&#39;ve read in recent years that our<br/>
language has been stolen, highjacked, by our &quot;soft&quot; culture, to the extent<br/>
that many words now mean the opposite of what they seem.<br/>
<br/>
I can see how &quot;homeschooling&quot; now means schooling at home. But now, even<br/>
Unschooling is perceived by many as being the same thing. Not even to<br/>
consider the meaning of &quot;de-schooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Are we to simply assume that they all mean the same thing to most people,<br/>
even to those who are doing them?<br/>
<br/>
Tell me, does Unschooling now mean &quot;doing school&quot;  or does it still mean, as<br/>
I use it, finding ways to live and raise children without the methods of<br/>
schools? For the integrity of the list, it might help to make the<br/>
distinction, so that people who stumble in here with the idea that the name<br/>
actually means unschooling will not be confused, as I have been.<br/>
<br/>
There is the other reason which is that, as Diane describes the<br/>
pre-unschooling list, lots of people might get the idea that the Holt<br/>
variety of unschooling really does not exist, so they&#39;d better get with some<br/>
sort of schooling program after all.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe there is a definition of unschooling, as it pertains to this list, <br/>
contained on the intro to the list. I thought it was going out when new <br/>
members signed on, so you should have received it then. If not, it&#39;s also <br/>
available for viewing at the Yahoo site.<br/>
<br/>
This has been discussed here many, many times. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find <br/>
that any regular posters are suggesting school-at-home.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In some places unschooling means what I would describe as eclectic: focusing<br/>
on fun educational activities.<br/>
<br/>
In some places unschooling means free time after lessons. I don&#39;t know if<br/>
they mean do-anything-you-want free, or<br/>
learn-anything-as-long-as-it-looks-like-learning free. Probably can be<br/>
either depending who you ask.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s it gets discussed as John Holt discussed it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For the integrity of the list, it might help to make the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s what&#39;s on the front screen at Yahoo and gets sent out to everyone who<br/>
joins. I understand that you were confused about it not being the politics<br/>
of unschooling but what about the unschooling as discussed here confused<br/>
you?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn what they<br/>
&gt; need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling parent is a<br/>
&gt; facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with curiosity and<br/>
&gt; enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what, when, where and<br/>
&gt; how of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to Spongebob<br/>
&gt; Squarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or you&#39;d like to find out more<br/>
&gt; about how video games and life in general are filled with learning, come join<br/>
&gt; us!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling is<br/>
&gt; *not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed<br/>
&gt; learning, nor is it done on a part-time basis. Everyone with an interest in<br/>
&gt; unschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you keep in<br/>
&gt; mind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in ways<br/>
&gt; designed to help each other become unschoolers or become better at<br/>
&gt; unschooling. We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a<br/>
&gt; &quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members, since many listmembers love a lively<br/>
&gt; debate and questioning beliefs to their foundations. If you have questions<br/>
&gt; about this list please feel free to contact list moderator Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
&gt; (fetteroll@...)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This list and the Unschooling.com site were created and are still supported by<br/>
&gt; Home Education Magazine: (http://www.home-ed-magazine.com); Helen Hegener<br/>
&gt; (HEM-Editor@...) is the list owner.<br/>
