<br/>
Sandra&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because it&#39;s hard being a minority amoung minorities.  Even with my <br/>
secular groups, they are all control freaks with their kids (food, tv, <br/>
video games, hold school work over their heads like a punishment) and <br/>
have no understanding whatsoever of unschooling.  Even with all of the <br/>
complements I get with my teen, people keep asking me if I&#39;m &quot;keeping <br/>
him home again this year&quot;  My oldest son on his own is very bright and <br/>
doing high level math on his own (self-taught 100%).  He has surpased <br/>
me and I don&#39;t know how to help him if he does ask for help with his <br/>
math.  I am on a very limited budget and now everyone is telling me <br/>
not to put him in community college early because it will ruin his <br/>
chances for college scholarships which we really need.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to join a group like that but I feel like I *must* be the <br/>
one with a problem since they get a lot of support in this area.  <br/>
There are conservative christian groups that say they are open to all <br/>
but you do have to listen to their religous/political speeches/prayers.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t, but 1/ they wouldn&#39;t want me, and 2/ I live in a big city with lots<br/>
of groups, so I am not stuck with few choices as you seem to be.<br/>
<br/>
Conservative groups are unlikely to be supportive of Unschooling in general<br/>
either.<br/>

<br/>
I would suggest helping your teen find the activities he is interested in<br/>
that are populated by people, rather than only &quot;homeschooled teens&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
The idea that I was getting at was that peers does not have to mean &quot;age<br/>
peers&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
When I wrote &quot;people&quot; I was trying to get at the notion that there are<br/>
interest based societies or groups or places that are open to a range of<br/>
ages including adults. <br/>
<br/>
Now I am more convinced that hanging out with a bunch of controlled and<br/>
restricted teens - the surest way to extend adolescent attitudes - will not<br/>
be very helpful to him or you.<br/>
<br/>
Does he *want* to go to teen night? I&#39;m concerned about the phrase &quot;putting<br/>
him in&quot; the teen night.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little confused about why Community College courses would be a problem<br/>
for getting scholarships. It sounds illogical. What does Wes Beach have to<br/>
say on this? <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that is future focused thinking. If your son is interested in some<br/>
Comm. College courses now, he should be able to take them. He may not want<br/>
to go to a degree program if the CC fulfils his needs.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re going to go to college?<br/>
Or by &quot;we&quot; did you mean that your son can only afford to attend &quot;real&quot; <br/>
college with a scholarship, and community college will ruin his chances.... how <br/>
exactly?<br/>
<br/>
Does that mean college is your target goal and &quot;just learning&quot; (or taking <br/>
classes because he thinks it would be fun or useful) is not on track?<br/>

<br/>
Well sure.   Their church is open to all too, all who will behave as they <br/>
behave and live as they live (or at least fake it), dress as they dress, speak as <br/>
they speak, control their kids as they control their kids.<br/>

Can he join teams for sports he likes (city leagues or whatever) or go to <br/>
gyms?<br/>
Can he join computer user groups or volunteer with groups that help people <br/>
with computer problems?<br/>
Can he organize beginners&#39; chess tournaments somewhere or teach younger kids?<br/>

None of that needs him to be or not be homeschooled, or be or not be older, <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am finding that this works much better.  We actually<br/>
live on the Tennessee/Virginia border, so I fully<br/>
understand about living around the baptist<br/>
Christian/conservative/left wing homeschoolers.  Most<br/>
of the homeschool groups here have descriptions like<br/>
&quot;you must be a church attendee&quot; or you have to agree<br/>
to a &quot;statement of faith&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I did start my own local unschooling group, and while<br/>
I think it is a fine group, it is a lot of families<br/>
with  very young kids and many who don&#39;t unschool as<br/>
(radically) as we do.  I don&#39;t really feel like we<br/>
&quot;fit in&quot; with much of our neighbors or even within the<br/>
group -- we are (GASP!) a non-religious, free<br/>
thinking, family who enjoys shows from everything like<br/>
Penn & Teller&#39;s Bullshit to the Family Guy, who watch<br/>
R rated movies, who eats fast food, and who fights for<br/>
gay rights.  We are in the minority here, but I am<br/>
finally okay with that.<br/>
<br/>
So, I am finding that, those that my oldest two (ages<br/>
15 and 13) are connecting better with are just other<br/>
people with similiar interests -- and they are not<br/>
necessarily homeschoolers or unschoolers.  My 15 year<br/>
old has been meeting lots of people lately that she<br/>
thinks are cool and fun -- but they attend public<br/>
school.  <br/>
<br/>
So, while I know many of us love the idea of finding<br/>
other homeschool/unschool families, I think it is even<br/>
more important to help our kids (if they want help)<br/>
find those that they might share interests with --<br/>
regardless of how they are schooled (or not schooled).<br/>

<br/>
Of course I went to college in the dark ages, which was really the early  <br/>
1980&#39;s but I started at community college and transferred to a four year school  <br/>
and got a full scholarship.  I had excellent grades and had declared a  major <br/>
and was a &quot;proven&quot; student that met their qualifications for  scholarship.<br/>
 <br/>
I also know other kids that start at community college and I&#39;ve not heard  <br/>
any of them say they are now not eligible for scholarships at four year  <br/>
schools.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d look into that further, it doesn&#39;t seem exactly  right.<br/>

<br/>
If when he applies, you say the community college classes were part of your <br/>
homeschooling, and he doesn&#39;t apply as a transfer student, and you have a cover <br/>
letter explaining that because of homeschooling informally he&#39;s a special <br/>
case, and if you&#39;re applying for the scholarship based on test scores or need, it <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem it would matter.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t apply based on high school grades or special achievement in sports, <br/>
right?<br/>
<br/>
There CAN be exceptions, and your son isn&#39;t a typical high school student.   <br/>
What applies to high school students can&#39;t apply to him straight across.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are tons of different kinds of scholarships, so no one thing will apply <br/>
to all of them.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a state lottery scholarship in New Mexico.   Any state resident <br/>
graduating from high school (even homeschoolers) can get it for one semester, I <br/>
think, BUT:    Kirby didn&#39;t qualify because he didn&#39;t go straight into full-time <br/>
college.  That&#39;s fine with me.   He took a few community college courses when <br/>
he was of an age to go to college and that disqualified him.   I knew it <br/>
would.   That&#39;s fine.   It wouldn&#39;t make any sense for me to follow 13 years of <br/>
happy laid-back freedom with a sudden mandatory full-time freshman college <br/>
semester just to get some tuition money.   And anyway, the classes he took at the <br/>

<br/>
Maybe this is a stupid question, but how could a homeschooled kid <br/>
without a GPA qualify for a scholarship anyway?  (Unless you are talking <br/>
about eligibility for a sports scholarship.  That can be strict, I think.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Be careful of taking advice from &quot;everyone&quot; &lt;G&gt;. There is so MUCH  <br/>
misinformation passed around about community colleges!!<br/>
<br/>
There are some college scholarships that are not available to  <br/>
transfer students - that is true.<br/>
There are other college scholarships specifically FOR transfer students.<br/>
<br/>
If he goes to community college, then the credits he earns there are  <br/>
college credits that you don&#39;t have to pay for later - that&#39;s a GREAT  <br/>
deal if the community college is inexpensive.<br/>
<br/>
It is also often easier to get INTO more selective colleges when a  <br/>
student is transferring from a community college than directly from  <br/>
high school/homeschooling.<br/>

&lt;&lt;But still, it would be organized by parents.<br/>
And all the  kids might have in common is that they&#39;re homeschooled.     <br/>
<br/>
At school, all the kids have in common is that they go to the same  school.   <br/>
Why duplicate that if there are other  options?<br/>

In a class situation it probably would... I don&#39;t know if we would choose a  <br/>
homeschool class it&#39;s just too traditional and proper.<br/>
 <br/>
That said we have not participated in any classes yet....<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We never just invite homeschoolers especially when we go to the movies. On  <br/>
the other hand we don&#39;t selectivly invite those *we know* don&#39;t like us and  <br/>
think our son has too much freedom. We generally know who&#39;s *allowed* to  go.<br/>
In the end they are a group of kids having fun and so far there is no ps/hs  <br/>
signs over their heads that I can see other than the attempt to shock their  <br/>
parents but lately not so shocking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181736586">Im sure its different in each state. My daughter took community college<br/>
classes during high school. Now she is a full-time student at a local<br/>
college. She has tons of financial aid.  The college works with her in<br/>
filling our the appropriate forms and what isnt covered with financial aid,<br/>
she gets student loans. (unfortunately, our only option at this time).  But<br/>
I would say ¾ of the cost is covered with financial aid grants. <br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a state lottery scholarship in New Mexico.   Any state resident <br/>
graduating from high school (even homeschoolers) can get it for one<br/>
semester, I <br/>
think, BUT:    Kirby didn&#39;t qualify because he didn&#39;t go straight into<br/>
full-time <br/>
college.  That&#39;s fine with me.   He took a few community college courses<br/>
when <br/>
he was of an age to go to college and that disqualified him.   I knew it <br/>
would.   That&#39;s fine.   It wouldn&#39;t make any sense for me to follow 13 years<br/>
of <br/>
happy laid-back freedom with a sudden mandatory full-time freshman college <br/>
semester just to get some tuition money.   And anyway, the classes he took<br/>
at the <br/>
community college were free not counting the legal stick-up called &quot;student<br/>
book <br/>
store.&quot;<br/>
