<div id="ygrps-yiv-900958546">Hi Wini,<br/>
My 3 year old, Emma, has recently shown an interest in ballet.  Her favorite<br/>
books are the Angelina books (Angelina Ballerina, Angelina Ice Skates, etc).<br/>
She loves dancing with her daddy, &quot;twirling&quot; and trying to stand on her<br/>
toes.  I have told her not to stand on her toes as ballerinas have special<br/>
shoes & training before they do.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my question. Is she too young to begin lessons?  How do I find a<br/>
good teacher?  We are in a very rural area but can get to Winston Salem in a<br/>
little over an hour...what do I look for in a good teacher/school?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Wini!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-561156915">Cindy: The things to look for in a dance teacher are kind of the same for<br/>
other areas: you want a kind person who&#39;s not too military with the kids.<br/>
As for a studio and approach, etc., 3 years old is really way too young<br/>
for ballet classes.  Ballet is very, very structured and demanding and any<br/>
school that claims to be teaching ballet to 3 year olds is probably not.<br/>
Although, if they call it ballet and they let the kids run around a lot<br/>
and are allowed to do more &quot;creative movement&quot; types of things, that&#39;s<br/>
fine.  Many dance studios have lots of rules about when and where parents<br/>
can watch class and/or be with their child during class.  (I&#39;m embarassed<br/>
to admit that when I first started teaching creative movement, long before<br/>
I was a mother, I was a bit of general about &quot;NO parents allowed in the<br/>
dance room!&quot;)  If your daughter is separation sensitive, a dance class<br/>
might not work for her.  Generally speaking, a studio that is more modern<br/>
dance based is more likely to offer age appropriate creative movement<br/>
where the kids can move in their own way to teacher suggestions.  Many<br/>
ballet studios offer creative movement, also.  I&#39;d suggest watching a<br/>
class first or letting your daughter take a trial class and see how she<br/>
likes it.  When she turns 8 or 10, and still wants to study dance<br/>
that&#39;s when you can search out a professional ballet/dance studio.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  Wini<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-793314446">Hey Wini!<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if you knew of any boy Ballet students who may wish to<br/>
correspond with a Canadian 10 year old boy who enjoys Ballet?  My son<br/>
loved his classes and really shone on stage but felt alienated as the<br/>
only boy at his school, and I have to say alot of the other students&#39;<br/>
mothers did nothing to help the situation.  Before he becomes totally<br/>
disenchanted I&#39;m hoping he can have contact with someone who could help<br/>
encourage him.  I have always firmly believed the world would be a<br/>
better place if ALL boys took Ballet lessons!  The fact that his father<br/>
was a dancer is of only minor consolation.  Can anyone help?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Sonia<br/>
