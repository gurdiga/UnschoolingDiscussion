them right now.  Ethan has a very bad protrusion ( buck teeth, which JP <br/>
calles &quot;butt teeth.. just another grammatical error.. lol)  They inherited <br/>
thier mouths from thier Dad, he had braces too.   I am sure that the thumb <br/>
sucking is making it a lot worse..but, I figure the less of a deal I make <br/>
about it, the easier it will be for him to quit in his own... But, then I do <br/>
worry about the habit factor..  When should you start to intervene and help a <br/>
child break a habit?     Same with the shirt chewing.. . Although, like I <br/>
said, he has improved with that since we started home schooling..<br/>

There are lots of tales about teeth, and most seem total nonsense.   <br/>
IF playing trumpet would make your teeth protrude, then people would be able <br/>
to pick trumpet players out of crowds.  But it doesn&#39;t, and they don&#39;t.  Yet <br/>
mothers will tell daughters they can&#39;t play brass instruments because their <br/>
teeth will protrude.  (I guess they don&#39;t care if boys have protruding teeth.)<br/>
<br/>
AND... if anything like playing an instrument or thumb-sucking COULD change <br/>
teeth, why on EARTH would there be braces for teeth?  Surely orthodontists <br/>
could just give them something to put in their mouths to suck against or away <br/>
from or to hold here, or there, about as much time as one would suck a thumb <br/>
or play trumpet, and TaDAA!!  It would be fixed.<br/>
<br/>
There are traditional lies told for so long that people believe them because <br/>
their mothers were told by their grandmothers (or dentists, or neighbors) <br/>
like:<br/>
<br/>
chocolate will stunt your growth<br/>
coffee is very bad for children<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(chocolate and coffee are both expensive, and so sharing them with children <br/>
would be bad; plus once the tradition starts that ONLY adults can have them, <br/>
it makes kids have to wait, and adults wait for that privilege, and then <br/>
guard it jealously)<br/>
<br/>
nursing babies will make your breasts sag when you&#39;re older<br/>
<br/>
(some girls wear bras their whole lives thinking, mistakenly, that it will <br/>
keep their breasts from sagging in later years, because their moms told them <br/>
so--bras are not even an old article of clothing, so why would they think so? <br/>
 Because before bras were invented, older women&#39;s breasts sagged.  Huh!)<br/>

I hope you all know that nothing will cause hair to grow on the palms of your <br/>

So all of it&#39;s goofy.  Anyone biting a clarinet is playing it wrong anyway.<br/>
<br/>
And again, HOW long have people played clarinets?  150 years?   Brass <br/>
instruments somewhat longer, but no evidence of tooth deformation I&#39;ve ever <br/>
seen.  Just the concerns of mothers in the 1960&#39;s and thereabout.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra, you may be right.  I do know that if you ask a mechanic if your car <br/>
needs a tune-up, . you betcha it does.. And if you ask a chiropractic if you <br/>
need an adjustment, Of course you do.  And, if you ask an orthodontist if <br/>
your kid needs braces. By all means, they need them...  I guess for me, <br/>
whether or not his thumb sucking makes his teeth worse is a moot point.  <br/>
Because, physically, my children have small mouths and not enough room for <br/>
thier teeth ( thanks to the genes of thier father.. lol)   . You know I have <br/>
a BIG mouth ( EG)    Anyway,  whether he sucked his thumb or not, he will <br/>
most likely have to have braces.   Ethan has the worse protusion of all of my <br/>
children and he never sucked his thumb and only had a pacifier til he was <br/>
about a year old.   ( and he doesnt play the trumpet either.. lol)   <br/>

Kirby had cavities.  The dentist said it was because of nursing.<br/>
I told him I didn&#39;t think it was.<br/>
<br/>
Marty didn&#39;t have cavities.  His teeth look like Keith&#39;s family&#39;s teeth.<br/>
<br/>
Holly had cavities.  Her teeth look like my family&#39;s teeth.  Poor thing for <br/>
getting genetics that way...<br/>
<br/>
I had asked Kirby&#39;s dentist if he had read the Canadian study on cavities <br/>
being a bacterial contagion passed from mother to child from sharing food, <br/>
and he said never heard of it (in that *special* tone of voice that means &quot;if <br/>
I haven&#39;t heard of it it doesn&#39;t exist&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
I figure ten or twenty years from now that will be &quot;common knowledge&quot; <br/>
(whatever they decide or discover about it), but now it&#39;s official <br/>
non-information.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing much to be done about guessing what will kill us.  Wood smoke?  <br/>
Electricity?  Computer monitors?   Tea with sugar?   Auto emissions?   <br/>
Rock&#39;n&#39;roll?   They&#39;ll have to elbow each other out of the way and race to <br/>
kill me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure that worrying about death or about the ill effects of various <br/>
band instruments  are quicker roads to stress and unhappiness than happily <br/>
drinking tea and watching the comment track of Good Will Hunting with an <br/>
electric heater warming up my feet.  At least I hope so! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

I&#39;ll tell you one way my mother ensured that I grew up alive:<br/>
<br/>
She said some people were deathly allergic to fish and milk together, so <br/>
whenever we had fish we NEVER had milk.<br/>
<br/>
About a year into eating my favorite and habitual out&#39;n&#39;about meal in high <br/>
school I realized I WAS RISKING MY LIFE.  It  had not occurred to me ONCE <br/>
that Tastee Freez&#39;s fish sandwich and a milk shake constituted the <br/>
potentially deadly combination.<br/>
<br/>
I lived!!<br/>

<br/>
I agree too.  I have an overjet.  My bite is exactly the same as my dad&#39;s and my grandfather&#39;s.  Everytime I hear a dentist say something to me about thumbsucking, I have to explain all of that.  What a bunch of hooey.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and the other one is &quot;TMJ&quot;.  I know TMJ exists.  But they cite every reason under the sun to push orthodontics &quot;to prevent TMJ&quot;.  Well guess what, except for my overjet, my bite is totally normal.  And I have TMJ.<br/>
<br/>
And my daughter who sucked her thumb until age 9, has an overjet as well, but not nearly like mine.  Not the same shape..her bottom teeth are unaffected.  And STILL the dentist has not sent her to the orthodontist for a consult (she WANTS braces).  <br/>
<br/>
I figure, I&#39;ve got some time between my son, and her.  I&#39;m getting MY teeth fixed now!!<br/>

<br/>
&gt;There are lots of tales about teeth, and most seem total nonsense.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I never hear the stuff about teeth and instrument playing. I&#39;m just not <br/>
so sure that sucking doesn&#39;t make problems in some later on. I know of <br/>
people who have children that used pacifiers or thumbs or what have you and <br/>
have great teeth. Some kids never sucked a thing and need braces. I&#39;m just <br/>
wondering if my kids could have problems anyway, why make it worse?<br/>
<br/>
I do believe that constant sucking can change the shape of the mouth and <br/>
teeth just like tongue thrust can too. It stands to reason something with <br/>
that much force that often would do that. I&#39;m talking out loud here. Like I <br/>
said, I&#39;m still on the fence. Still wondering about this thumb sucking stuff <br/>
you paint on too. I was the one that brought it up but my daughter was the <br/>
one that told me to get her some. Then again, that&#39;s probably coming from me <br/>
too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-476945694">Just wanted to come out of the closet & say that I was a thumb <br/>
sucker!!! <br/>
I sucked my thumb until I was 16. I did so every night to put myself <br/>
to sleep. I  also would suck my thumb while  relaxing & watching tv <br/>
or reading a book. But I did so in the privacy of my own home for I <br/>
soon learnt that thumb sucking beyond a certain age was not socailly <br/>
acceptable. That I was considered & called &quot;a baby&quot; by &quot;outsiders&quot;. <br/>
My family were accepting of my thumb sucking.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the reason I sucked my thumb was for comfort. And I really <br/>
did feel relaxed when I was sucking. I was not breast fed so I often <br/>
wondered had I been would I not have sucked my thumb. But I don&#39;t <br/>
think so. Babies suck their thumb in the womb so I don&#39;t think it has <br/>
to do with being breast fed or not. <br/>
<br/>
I also had to have braces when I was 16 which is what initiated my <br/>
stopping thumb sucking. From the day my braces went on I went cold <br/>
turkey. Sometimes without thinking my thumb would automatically go in <br/>
but once I had made my mind up not to suck I could go thumb free. <br/>
<br/>
The problem with my protruding & criss crossed teeth was not because <br/>
of my thumb sucking at all. It was that my mouth was too small to <br/>
hold all my teeth. With having no room in my mouth my teeth protruded <br/>
for somewhere to go. (I also did not play a wind instrument of any <br/>
sort :) ) <br/>
<br/>
I still miss it though & I&#39;m almost 40!. I miss that truly peaceful & <br/>
content feeling I had while I was thumb sucking. I guess I could <br/>
always comfort & soothe myself with it. Now I have to find other ways <br/>
or other people to do so .<br/>

<br/>
Im not sure, but I think my comment about Ethan playing the trumpet was <br/>
misunderstood.  I was making a joke, that Ethan has protruding teeth, and its <br/>
not because he plays the trumpet.  Not that I dont allow him to play the <br/>
trumpet because it will make  his teeth protrude.   Maybe that last paragraph <br/>
was just a general statement, but I wanted to clarify that I am not &quot;one of <br/>
those people&quot; that it pertains to.   This is one area where we do agree...a <br/>
lot of advice and warnings that folks ( esp   &quot;professionals&quot;) offer is not <br/>
really valid or based on any truths.    <br/>

&lt;&lt; From what I remember about playing the clarinet, there&#39;s on the teeth by <br/>
the<br/>
clarinet, from the way it&#39;s held.  But it&#39;s been a long time. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I didn&#39;t bite *MINE.* <br/>
I know some people hole it that way, but it&#39;s not necessary.  I&#39;ve seen <br/>
clarinets with teethmarks on the mouthpiece, and many more without.<br/>
<br/>
But now I play recorder and those hardly get touched.  After salivating to <br/>
play clarinet for years it was hard at first to remember &quot;swallow!&quot;  I was <br/>
all Pavolviated, as soon as a mouthpiece was coming toward my mouth, I&#39;d <br/>
juice up, and had to unlearn that.   The drier the better with recorders, and <br/>
you tongue softly to the alveolar ridge (top of the mouth, behind the top <br/>
front teeth), and NOT onto the recorder.  And you nearly just breathe, <br/>
instead of totally BLOWing.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to play a clarinet a couple of years ago.  Even went and got a soft <br/>
reed to make it easier, and couldn&#39;t do a thing.  I remembered fingerings, <br/>
but couldn&#39;t &quot;vocalize,&quot; as they say.<br/>
<br/>
Recorder playing leaves your teeth just as crooked or as straight as they <br/>
ever would have been.  I&#39;m pretty sure trumpets and all else do the same.<br/>

but it showed that breastfeeding actually helped in the reduction of <br/>
cavities.  In talking with my dentist about my teeth and my sons he believes <br/>
that genetics plays a large role.  The way your teeth are formed is genetic.  <br/>
I have two sons one has no cavities (8yo) one had 2-none since he was about 2 <br/>
yo (5 1/2 yo)  my oldest weaned from breastfeeding the day before he turned 5 <br/>
and the other is still breastfeeding.  That also ties in with the need to <br/>
suck, my youngest nurses to go to sleep.  Seems to need that to fall asleep.<br/>

swimming and mom didn&#39;t hang around as much as mom&#39;s hang around now or even<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Also the sucking mechanism for breastfeeding is so different from the bottle <br/>
and many dentists just lump the two together. If formula feeding at night can <br/>
lead to cavities then breastfeeling must also. And with breastfeeding I have <br/>
found with many healthcare professional, if you don&#39;t understand it just <br/>
blame it.  Mom has a fever &quot;oh my, we must stop the breastfeeding&quot;.  Instead <br/>
of learning more about it they tend to want to stop it and change to <br/>
something they can control and see like formula feeding. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-204409824">Oh....well, my son had a large overbite.  Othewise his teeth are straight.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason I went to the orthodontist was that I wanted to correct his bite, an orthopedic problem that would require jaw surgery later if he decided he wanted it fixed.<br/>
<br/>
My son wasn&#39;t too keen on orthodontics but tolerated it.<br/>
<br/>
Then they wanted to move into &quot;phase 2&quot; with braces and such. (Phase 2 for him would mean closing the spaces in the back so that the teeth don&#39;t shift back into their original position).<br/>
<br/>
 Well Ant doesn&#39;t take good enough care of his teeth to slap braces on there.  Braces will mark up your teeth if you don&#39;t take care of them.  PLUS it makes it harder to floss.  <br/>
<br/>
My alternative?  Put a retainer in there until Ant decides he is ready to pursue &quot;phase2&quot; on his own.  By that time, he can use invisalign.  No marks, and easy to care for the teeth.<br/>
<br/>
That is what I&quot;m doing.  I get my aligners end of January.  And the only reason *I&#39;m* fixing my teeth is because the bottom ones are hitting the backs of the top ones and causing them to protrude even more than before.  <br/>
<br/>
I told the orthodontist from the beginning in both our cases that I don&#39;t care about cosmetics, I care about functionality<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-689674662">Well, Yahoo! has something like that with Geocities. Lycos has <br/>
Tripod. The question is, what is he using it for? If he wants to <br/>
create a blog, he may want to just head to http:www.blogger.com. The <br/>
difference between using a blogging services as opposed to one of <br/>
those evil free sites offered by Yahoo! or Lycos is that, well, they <br/>
are evil.<br/>
<br/>
Tripod is notorious for their unending slamming of advertisements <br/>
with pop-up windows. Yahoo! does not give you too much space on a web <br/>
page with all those banner ads so you will need more than one page. <br/>
They also have those nasty pop-ups. Blogger, on the other hand, only <br/>
adds a link to their site. That is the height of their ad flurry.<br/>
<br/>
Oh! I forgot, if you are a Mac user, you may want to check what they <br/>
have at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com">http://www.apple.com</a> They do have fabulous templates.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
