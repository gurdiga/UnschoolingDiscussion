 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;The other question is, are you not concerned with limitless hours of TV <br/>
viewing for a child. Again I find it hard to ignore the research on hours <br/>
spent watching TV. I accept that you don&#39;t pay much notice to the research, <br/>
but it does make me nervous.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think what these &quot;experts&quot; view as limitless TV watching is from school <br/>
kids and most school kids do not have unlimited TV watching rules. They have <br/>
school to go to so they are gone, have to go to bed early and have to cram <br/>
family stuff in on weekends. They have TV restrictions even though some <br/>
parents don&#39;t actually say &quot;no more TV.&quot; So to do studies on limitless <br/>
watching that would be more accurate, you would have to actually let <br/>
children be able to watch TV all day long for a long period of time. <br/>
Something unschoolers have a chance to do. But just like with limiting snack <br/>
foods, kids who don&#39;t have the restriction, don&#39;t feel the need to cram it <br/>
all in. Whether it be food or TV watching.<br/>
<br/>
Although we pay attention to what the kids are watching, I have never <br/>
limited their TV at all.. My kitchen opens into the playroom where most of <br/>
the toys are and also the TV. I see pretty much on a constant basis what the <br/>
kids are doing and watching. I watch them with the TV and most of the time, <br/>
they&#39;re eating, drawing, building and even acting out with their people what <br/>
they have just watched. They aren&#39;t for the most part, &quot;just sitting&quot; and <br/>
watching TV. I never have a fear that they are watching too much.<br/>
<br/>
My MIL asks every week if our 2 year old doesn&#39;t like Barney or something. <br/>
Her great grandchild was propped in front of Barney since she was 3 months <br/>
old. She&#39;s also been in daycare that long too. THAT, I have a problem with. <br/>
My little one could care less about any TV. It&#39;s on all the time here in one <br/>
room or another. (Well, not exactly all the time but a lot. The kids just <br/>
forget to turn it off.) I don&#39;t worry about her lack of interest any more <br/>
than I worry about the others watching too much.<br/>
