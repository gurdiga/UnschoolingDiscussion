&gt; Hi Sonia,<br/>
&gt; Where are you at in Saskatoon?  My father-in-law is from Saskatoon, in fact<br/>
&gt; he is going back there this month for a family reunion of sorts.  Wish that<br/>
&gt; we could go to, but it is cost prohibitive for my family.  He always talks<br/>
&gt; about Saskatoon berries and his brother sends him jelly that he makes with<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>

When we made a road trip west many years ago he dug up a few Saskatoon<br/>
bushes and brought them home to Ontario. They survived and have given<br/>
hundreds of quarts of berries. They are HUGE! 15 foot tall.<br/>
<br/>
We now have some farmers in our end of Ontario who are starting to grow<br/>
them commercially. <br/>
I made a Saskatoon pie the other day. First time I&#39;ve ever made one. Not<br/>
that my dad gave me any of his berries I had to use fruit stand ones.<br/>
Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m not his favourite so I never am given enough to so<br/>
much as make a pie.<br/>
My pie did turn out better than my mothers though BBEG.<br/>
<br/>
Service berries are a close cousin and taste almost exactly the same so<br/>
if you find some and want to try them they&#39;re a good substitute for<br/>
Saskatoons.<br/>
Just cook them in a little water for 5-10 min to soften them for a pie.<br/>
Drain them and let cool. Use them in a standard fruit pie recipe using 1<br/>
cup sugar mixed with 2 TBS flour stirred through the berries, put in the<br/>
shell, dot with butter and top with crust.<br/>
Bake at 350 for about 45 min.<br/>
