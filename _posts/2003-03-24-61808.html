&quot;A &#39;Defender&#39; of Homeschooling, Properly Regulated&quot;<br/>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
Ann:  Every now and then, today&#39;s news demands a hard look at past <br/>
conversations and re-evaluation of our thinking.  Today is one of <br/>
those days.<br/>
<br/>
First, the past conversation for those who missed it.  About a year <br/>
ago, Stanford University professor of political science Dr. Rob Reich <br/>
joined the NHEN-leg list to discuss his views about homeschooling. <br/>
That discussion lasted nearly two months, the script of which is some <br/>
eighty-five pages long.  Read that discussion here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NHENLegClearinghouse/files/ReichPart1.doc">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NHENLegClearinghouse/files/ReichPart1.doc</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NHENLegClearinghouse/files/ReichPart2.doc">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NHENLegClearinghouse/files/ReichPart2.doc</a><br/>
<br/>
Two quotes from Reich&#39;s opening remarks in the discussion are telling:<br/>
&quot;I consider myself a defender of homeschooling, properly regulated.&quot;<br/>
And<br/>
&quot;The real issue is the legitimacy of state authority over children. <br/>
And here, I presume, is where we disagree.  I believe that, so far as <br/>
education is concerned, parents must share authority with the state. <br/>
The state is concerned with the education of children for two <br/>
reasons.  First, the state has a legitimate interest in cultivating <br/>
able citizenship.  Second, the state has a role in promoting the <br/>
independent interests of children, which include, on my <br/>
understanding, the right to live a life other than the one their <br/>
parents lead.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ann: Despite these outrageous statements which, incidentally, <br/>
survived intact during that long discussion at NHEN-Leg, many - <br/>
including me - dismissed Reich as a &quot;flash-in-the-pan&quot; academic. <br/>
However, recent news suggests otherwise, that Reich at the very least <br/>
has the ear of the media. Today&#39;s news: Reich&#39;s material is being <br/>
read and referenced, just last week, in the article below.  And <br/>
despite the article&#39;s overall positive look at homeschooling <br/>
evaluation in Florida, Reich&#39;s opinion held sway in the negative <br/>
headline.<br/>
<br/>

Headline: Home-schoolers tough to test<br/>
Subhead: Parents adopt many student evaluations<br/>
Reich citations in the article:<br/>
&quot;If we can&#39;t even know how many kids are being home-schooled, it&#39;s <br/>
impossible to carry out a study on how they&#39;re doing on average,&#39; <br/>
said Stanford University political scientist Rob Reich.&quot;<br/>
And:<br/>
&quot;Studies on the academic skills of home-educated students are <br/>
unreliable because there&#39;s no way to tell if the sample represents <br/>
the overall field, Reich said.&quot;[..]&quot;States could require <br/>
home-schooled children to take annual standardized tests like the <br/>
FCAT, an idea Reich supports. If a child repeatedly fails to make <br/>
academic progress, Reich suggested the state should step in and force <br/>
children to attend public schools.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ann: Quite a few people have speculated about what Reich would do <br/>
when public schooled students fail to make academic progress - would <br/>
he step in and force children to homeschool? Fat chance!<br/>

Ann:  Reich an academic?  Oh yes.  Political theorist?  Most <br/>
certainly.  A defender of homeschooling?  Spare me.<br/>

Headline: Home schoolers want a shot at sports<br/>
&quot;We think that home schoolers are being discriminated against by not <br/>
allowing them access to resources which our taxes pay for.&quot;<br/>
&quot;A bill in the state Senate [..]-- called the &quot;access bill&quot; by <br/>
supporters -- would include extracurricular activities from football <br/>
and baseball to ROTC; chess club to concert band. If the bill passes, <br/>
a home school student would be allowed to participate in the <br/>
extracurricular activities at the public school the child would have <br/>
attended. The parents would be responsible for the same expenses as <br/>
any other team member&#39;s parents and would agree to transport their <br/>
child to and from school for the activity.&quot;<br/>

ILLINOIS - two stories<br/>

Headline: Who is making sure children are schooled?<br/>
Ann: To summarize here, Illinois&#39; problems, problems that raged last <br/>
fall when Regional Superintendent Bruce Dennison authorized truancy <br/>
officers to investigate home schooling families, are cooling off <br/>
some. Since that time, proposals for voluntary registration have been <br/>
dropped &quot;because of a lack of support among home-school groups.&quot; <br/>
Dennison showed his willingness to discriminate against some families <br/>
when he told homeschooling parents that if they belonged to HSLDA <br/>
they would not be investigated.  A lengthy discussion regarding this <br/>
and other important issues can be read at NHEN Forums:<br/>

Headline: Senate votes for charter schools<br/>
&quot;OLYMPIA -- The Republican-controlled Senate voted Thursday to allow <br/>
charter schools in Washington for the first time...But lawmakers <br/>
voted 26-23 for Senate Bill 5012, sponsored by Senate Education <br/>
Chairman Steve Johnson. The bill would allow 70 charter schools over <br/>
the next six years, but only five new schools in each of the first <br/>
two years.&quot; Read the discussion here:<br/>

and District-sponsored Home Study Programs<br/>

<br/>
Ann:  No homeschooling discussion is as contentious these days as the <br/>
heated arguments about publicly funded programs offered to <br/>
homeschoolers.  Are the programs thinly disguised homeschooler <br/>
retrieval programs, bent on gathering homeschoolers back into the <br/>
public education fold, trampling independent homeschooling freedoms <br/>
in the process?  Or, are the programs adding sorely needed <br/>
educational variety and choice to the options available to all <br/>
children everywhere and worthy of every parent&#39;s support?  Both? <br/>
Neither?<br/>
<br/>
Complicating matters further is a point often lost. In most cases, <br/>
students who enroll in public school homeschool programs become, <br/>
&quot;legally&quot; speaking, public school students. The repercussions of that <br/>
fact add grist to the arguments about the definition of <br/>
homeschooling, as mentioned in the March 16 update&#39;s &quot;A homeschooler <br/>
is a homeschooler is...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To help me sort it out - and I don&#39;t have these issues clear in my <br/>
mind yet - I seek the type of wisdom that Laura, a parent who uses a <br/>
charter school program, expressed in a recent post to <br/>
HEM-PoliticalAction.  Laura said, &quot;I realize that we are in our great <br/>
school situation today because of the independent homeschoolers that <br/>
have gone before us as well as all of you today that work so hard to <br/>
promote and protect homeschooling. I think that the best way to <br/>
preserve the choices we have in education is to protect independent <br/>
homeschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do our homeschooling freedoms lie in the hands of folks like Laura <br/>
who truly understand and support the roots of educational options? <br/>

Headline: School district takes look at home schooling<br/>
&quot;...Fraisse said that the home-school program would not only be <br/>
cost-neutral, but might even be cost-positive for the district. Such <br/>
apportioned funds could be put to use in a dual-use facility such as <br/>
a computer lab, which would set aside about five computers for <br/>
&quot;drop-ins&quot; such as home schoolers and supply approximately 30 <br/>
computers for other students, instead of sending home a computer with <br/>
every child who decides to home school.&quot;<br/>

emergence of partnerships between public schools and home educators. <br/>
Mary Lou Carothers, Education Program Director, Office of Family <br/>
Involvement, Florida Department of Education, stated, &quot;the only thing <br/>
the district is required by law to provide for home schoolers is <br/>
extracurricular activities.  However, the district is within its <br/>
legal rights to provide academic courses.  Also, the district will <br/>
collect FTE for that attendance.&quot;  Mrs. Carothers went on to say she <br/>
encourages the district to work with home educators. &quot;<br/>

homeschooling issues being represented accurately in the media and in <br/>
advertising?  Are there threats to homeschooling freedoms that <br/>
deserve a wider audience?  Is something happening today that will <br/>
help assure that we - and our children and grandchildren - can <br/>
homeschool with the greatest freedom possible? Please share so the <br/>
rest of us can learn!<br/>
