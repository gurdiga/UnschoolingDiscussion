<div id="ygrps-yiv-588502788">Yep - I&#39;ve lived through it.  Deschooling can be very stressful.  <br/>
It&#39;s kind of like three steps forward - 2 steps back.  I&#39;d totally <br/>
unschool,  then add some math because I panicked - then totally <br/>
unschool.  My kids were probably more confused than anything.  We <br/>
were finally able to let it all go,  let the tv and video games play <br/>
themselves out,  and let it work.  It still goes in spurts.  Just <br/>
last night my 13 year old said that he didn&#39;t feel like he was doing <br/>
enough.  Today he has read physics,  American history, Scientific <br/>
American,  played the <br/>
guitar,  and designed a desk he wants to build.   In his words just <br/>
now as he was reading over my shoulder,  &quot;You shouldn&#39;t even mention <br/>
that they should be doing something, because then they force <br/>
themselves,  and the whole process of deschooling and returning to a <br/>
love of learning takes longer.&quot;  How&#39;s that?  I do think I slowed him <br/>
down in the beginning with my own concerns.<br/>
<br/>
My two best recommendation are - <br/>
<br/>
1.  Get busy learning yourself and let them see you following your own <br/>
interests.<br/>
2.  READ, READ, READ about unschooling, deschooling, learning styles, <br/>
etc.  There are a lot of resources on the net.  Besides that I like <br/>
to read Home Ed Mag, Growing without Schooling Mag, _The Unschooling <br/>
Handbook_by Mary Griffith, and _The Teenage Liberation Handbook_by <br/>
Grace LLewellyn.  Also,  anything by John Holt.<br/>

&gt;     Hi everyone! This seems to be a good point for me to jump in. I have been<br/>
&gt; lurking around for a couple of days and would now like to throw in a question.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     First I will introduce myself. I&#39;m Laura the mom of 6 boys, grandma to 1<br/>
&gt; boy and another due any day. My oldest 3 are all out of school. I have a<br/>
&gt; sophomore still in ps. I am hsing my 2 youngest, 8 & 11 yro. for the first<br/>
&gt; time. (I did hs the 11 yro. for 2nd grade then he repeated 2nd grade in ps)<br/>
&gt; I like and believe in the unschool philosophy but am having a hard time<br/>
&gt; translating it into everyday life.<br/>
&gt;     My main problem at the moment is dh has not even begun to understand it,<br/>
&gt; therefore in order to continue hsing I find I have to do some type of paper<br/>
&gt; work to show him. I find the biggest obstacle to be me and the boys.<br/>
&gt; I realized that I am having a hard time getting past my own yrs of ps and the<br/>
&gt; 20+ yrs I have spent as the mother of ps children. Boy was I indoctrinated.<br/>
&gt;     My other big issue is how to deal with becoming unchooled. Are there any<br/>
&gt; moms or dads out there who have lived through this difficult time period. Any<br/>
&gt; advice would be appreciated. I am finding the boys very difficult on and off.<br/>
&gt; They criticize me for to little work and balk at work at other times. If I<br/>
&gt; just let them go they would watch TV all day which hubby would not like and<br/>
&gt; later they would tell folks I teach them nothing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, don&#39;t want to go on and on I&#39;m sure if you have been there you<br/>
&gt; understand. I am determined to keep going but some days I have to just sit<br/>
&gt; down and cry.<br/>

    Thanks so much for your reply. For me the problem has been that I read <br/>
everything I could get my hands on. I liken it to Lamaze classes. You can <br/>
learn to breathe but it still hurts. I thought knowing so much we would whiz <br/>
through. Reality <br/>
is sooo... different, with real live thinking people. Books don&#39;t talk back.<br/>
<br/>
    I did start playing around with things. I realized I needed to do more <br/>
things with them than at them. Instead of helping them make a scrapbook I <br/>
needed to sit down and make my own. Then I found  they wanted to do their <br/>
own.  Slowly.....Oh so slowly the lightbulbs are going on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679449440">Laura,<br/>
hugs and welcomes.  I am sure you are going to get so much encouragement from <br/>
this list.  I hate to think of anyone being so overwhelmed that they need to <br/>
cry.  Homeschooling, in whatever form, should be a joy for both you and your <br/>
children.<br/>
I had to start my homeschooling journey by schooling at home, I mean with <br/>
strict curriculum, ect.  That was to satisfy me, and my dh.  Also, that was <br/>
my first experience with any style of homeschooling, and I thought that was <br/>
what you were supposed to do.  WRONG!!! lol.  That lasted about six weeks, <br/>
then I started picking my own curriculum.  That lasted about a year and I was <br/>
ready to put the boys in school.  A friend told me about a Relaxed Homescool <br/>
seminar goin on in some town I don&#39;t remember now, but we took the weekend <br/>
off and went.  It was wonderful, and since then, this is our sixth year, I do <br/>
what works for our family and am constantly evolving my hs style.  I tell DH <br/>
what I want him to know, in little increments, as he sees their progression.  <br/>
Then I explain a little more.  I say all this just to say, don&#39;t despair, I <br/>
can send you so many sites on the web, that will give the kids something <br/>
tangible to do, they can even pick what they want, like the How Stuff Works <br/>
site, or the Surfing the net with kids site.  We get involved lots of days, <br/>
just by the &quot;Cool fact of the day.  Let me know if you want any sites, I will <br/>
be happy to email<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024777514">Hello... My name is Laura and I too am just starting to &quot;unschool&quot; my <br/>
children.  I hs them in the curriculum way for a year and then I put them <br/>
back into ps.  I just pulled them out again, because my husband and I feel it <br/>
is best for our family.... But I am wanting to do unschooling because I think <br/>
it is a more natural and logical way to learn.<br/>
<br/>
    I read an email that you sent to another person and you had mentioned <br/>
some web sites... I would be happy if you would send them to us...  Thank you.<br/>

<br/>
   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hsc.org">http://www.hsc.org</a><br/>
<br/>
and find a wonderful selection of educational links.  Just ONE of them, the <br/>
one for the San Francisco museum called the Exploratorium, has many many cool <br/>
science and history sites.  And they emphasize and add new sites every month.<br/>
<br/>
I strongly believe in unschooling.  I like how the book titled _The Book of <br/>
Learning and Forgetting_, by Frank Smith explains that a traditional school&#39;s <br/>
approach to teaching is based on scientific research about the best way to <br/>
teach *nonsense*.  If we aren&#39;t asking our kids to memorize meaningless, <br/>
unrelated information, there is no reason for them to learn that way.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a webpage with a detailed summary of this book, but I&#39;m sorry to say <br/>
I can&#39;t find it in my notes.  Maybe someone else on the list has it.  (If no <br/>
one comes up with it in a few days, you can email me privately and I&#39;ll write <br/>
you a 2 paragraph description of the research.)<br/>
