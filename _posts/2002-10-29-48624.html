<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552968204">&lt;&lt;find out everything about his birth and his birthmother that you can<br/>
before you adopt him.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She already has adopted him.  I have adopted 3 children whose parental<br/>
backgrounds would make your hair stand on end.  While we were fostering but<br/>
planning to adopt Danny we knew he had Hepatitis C but we found out that the<br/>
dr. was concerned he might also have HIV.  Scared me to death.  We cried and<br/>
cried.  I will never forget the social worker asking if we were still<br/>
interested in adopting him.  It blew my mind.  We were committed to Danny no<br/>
matter what, didn&#39;t matter if some judge had signed a paper or not.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m trying to say is that a lot of people see families through adoption<br/>
as almost some kind of insurance.  They screen birth parents much more<br/>
thoroughly than they screen spouses or anyone else they might have children<br/>
with.  You can give birth to a perfectly normal child, have done all the<br/>
right things, attachment parented, LLL, everything and the kid can still<br/>
suffer a head injury and you have that 18yo with the problems.  Or you can<br/>
adopt Marsie whose parents were both retarded, 2 sisters are retarded, 1<br/>
brother and mom are psychotic and she can grow into one of the smartest,<br/>
most self-assured little 5yo on the planet.<br/>
