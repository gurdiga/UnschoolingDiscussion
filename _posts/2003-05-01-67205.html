<div id="ygrps-yiv-655213942">Hello dear listmates-<br/>
<br/>
As always, I have a difficult time keeping up with reading all the<br/>
wonderful posts on this active list! Thanks for all the consistent input.<br/>
<br/>
One thing caught my eye today - I believe it was Shyrley who mentioned that<br/>
she had a daughter who was interested in all things Celtic, Gaelic, etc.<br/>
Well, my son, Sky 19 years old, has a passion of the same kind. I was<br/>
wondering how old your daughter is (perhaps irrelevant) and if she would<br/>
like to have an email penpal with similar interests. Or, if someone else on<br/>
the list has a child/friend/etc who might be so inclined.<br/>
<br/>
Email me off list, if you like.<br/>
<br/>
In aloha, Lee<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry. Not me. I speak Welsh but don&#39;t consider that &#39;celtic&#39;. In fact, I can be found on various pagan lists ranting about the mis-use of the word &#39;celtic and scaring new-agers who think a swirly peice<br/>
of knot-work makes one &#39;celtic&#39;. None who have ever read any reputable ancient history or archealogical papers. See, I&#39;m ranting already ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Shyrley, who isn&#39;t scary in real life unless you mention ley-lines or somesuch.....<br/>
