I looked up your problem in my herding training books.  Says it is important<br/>
to nip it in the bud.  Suggests using a retractable leash and having a<br/>
chicken get close enough for dog to chase it.  Give a command such as &quot;Leave<br/>
it!&quot; right before the dog hits the end of the 30&#39; leash.  After a few times<br/>
and dog is no longer running full out, shorten leash and take him in with<br/>
chickens.  Use leash and some type of stick or boogeybag (stick with noisy<br/>
plastic bag tied on end) to keep dog off of chickens.  Have chickens between<br/>
you and dog, reaching over chickens with stick (hit the ground, not the<br/>
dog).<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-164673561">Tia, I did talk to my sister about her dog.   She said they put a muzzle<br/>
on him.   He still tried to chase them, but wasn&#39;t able to grab them.   <br/>
She thought he spent one summer wearing the muzzle when he was going to<br/>
be outside and maybe up to a year of mostly off the muzzle, when they<br/>
would be with him, but in the muzzle if they couldn&#39;t be around.    They<br/>
never had a problem with him after that.   He was pretty young though,<br/>
about three years old when they got him.   I don&#39;t know if that will make<br/>
a difference.   She also said he was good about the muzzle, but that if<br/>
he&#39;d hated it, it probably would have been too hard to make him wear it. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know how you feel about that.   = /<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m definitely thinking about it.  I want to thank everyone who responded to<br/>
this.  Rod and I are talking over how we want to handle it.  We don&#39;t need<br/>
training that would allow him to be out around the chickens when we weren&#39;t<br/>
there.  He isn&#39;t ever allowed out unless we&#39;re with him.  (Our road is<br/>
terrible for speeders even if there wasn&#39;t a leash law.)  Until we get this<br/>
sorted out, we just have to only have him out with us when we&#39;re really<br/>
paying attention to him.<br/>

The two things I would recommend are 1) a shock collar. Fast, effective, but <br/>
harsh. Or 2) weeks of training with treats (if he&#39;s a chow hound) and a <br/>
willing, brave chicken. Time-consuming but gentler.<br/>
<br/>
The shock collar can be purchased (and sometimes rented) from a trainer. He <br/>
must wear the collar ALWAYS, and you must be willing to zap him whenever he <br/>
even thinks about chasing a bird. The first time is HORRIBLE.<br/>
<br/>
The gentler training would start in an enclosed area, on lead. I&#39;d start with <br/>
a chicken wing on a long string. Pull the string and make the wing move. If <br/>
he goes for it, snap the lead. If he doesn&#39;t, &quot;good boy&quot; and a treat. <br/>
Gradually, as he becomes trust-worthy with the wing, add a calm chicken. Then <br/>
wilder and wilder chickens. After he&#39;s trustworthy in the pen, move to an <br/>
open area---and start over with the wing (maybe a new wing by now (but you <br/>
CAN freeze it)) and move on to the calm and wild chickens. He&#39;s ALWAYS on <br/>
lead. Then go back to the pen without a lead, If he&#39;s trustworthy there, go <br/>
to the open. If you&#39;ve done your job, he should be fine. <br/>
<br/>
If he EVER stumbles, go back two or three steps and try again. He&#39;s a dog. <br/>
That&#39;s the hardest thing for people to remember. He has instincts, and the <br/>
&quot;hunt and chase&quot; one is HUGE. As someone said earlier, that&#39;s what we&#39;ve used <br/>
to OUR benefit to  produce dogs that fox hunt, bird hunt, herd, drive,----so <br/>
many things we&#39;ve manipulated this instinct for.<br/>
<br/>
To do something as simple as to train him to lie down immediately on command <br/>
(WITHOUT FAIL, every time you say it) could stop the drive (override it) to <br/>
chase and kill chickens. It wouldn&#39;t stop the desire, but stop the motion. In <br/>
order to TRUST him, you need to stop the desire.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
