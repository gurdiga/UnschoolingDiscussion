<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;some H$LDA paranoia/fear encouraging garbage.  Am I ever grateful that<br/>
NHEN is now here and will be making REAL information available to the<br/>
public and homeschoolers alike so that this continue misinformation that<br/>
is self-serving from H$LDA will be<br/>
seen for what it is!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	This is closely related to a topic I&#39;ve been investigating--the fear<br/>
inducing element of HSLDA. Last month I attended their Support Group<br/>
Seminar, and was struck by several things, including the information and<br/>
discussion about the threat to homescholers by Social Services. One of<br/>
the presentations was titled &quot;What Parents Should Know About Child<br/>
Welfare Agencies.&quot;   <br/>
	Scott Woodruff regaled us with tales of CPS folks and assorted law<br/>
officers forcing their way into peoples&#39; homes, and claiming they were<br/>
admitted voluntarily.  He told a horror story of a family whose children<br/>
were clued in, by CPS questioners, to the possibilities of child sexual<br/>
abuse. He gave plenty of advice on how to handle such situations, and,<br/>
when asked, said that the number of homeschoolers falsely accused of<br/>
child abuse/neglect was a &quot;chronic, steady&quot; number, with occasional<br/>
&quot;rashes,&quot; such as an increase in the number of &quot;kids left in the car&quot;<br/>
complaints.<br/>
	 Evonne Bunn, HEAV Exec. Director, interrupted Woodruff, to say that her<br/>
organization &quot;will most often refer parents to HSLDA, and recommend you<br/>
join because you can&#39;t forsee problems.&quot; Woodruff replied with a<br/>
recommendation on the HEAV homeschool manual, and especially its legal<br/>
section.<br/>
	Accompanying all this frightening talk was the 16 page &quot;Dealing With<br/>
Social Services Contacts&quot; section of the seminar workbook. The first page<br/>
of that section begins with this: &quot;More and more frequently, home<br/>
schoolers are turned in on child abuse hotlines to social services<br/>
agencies. Families who do not like homeschoolers can make an anonymous<br/>
phone call to the child abuse hotline and fabricate abuse stories about<br/>
home schoolers. The social worker then has the obligation to investigate.<br/>
Each state has a different policy for social workers, but generally they<br/>
want to come into the family&#39;s home and speak with the children<br/>
separately. To allow either of these to occur involves great risk to the<br/>
family.&quot; The last 10 pages of this section include &quot;How to Handle Visits<br/>
From Social Service Agencies,&quot; which uses two fear-inducing scenarios to<br/>
illustrate how to and now not to handle social workers.<br/>
	The seminar workbook also includes a 5 page publication titled &quot;What Is<br/>
HSLDA?&quot; which starts with, &quot;A truant officer is at the door. He pushes<br/>
his way in. He will not leave until he can take your children to the<br/>
public school. What can you do?<br/>
	&quot;A police officer is at your door with an arrest warrant to take your<br/>
six year-old child. Who can you call?<br/>
	&quot;The local public school official insists that your home school<br/>
arrangement is not legal and threatens you with criminal charges. Where<br/>
can you get help *fast?*<br/>
	&quot;The Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) is the answer...&quot;<br/>
	The irony was revealed when, during Woodruff&#39;s talk, another HSLDA<br/>
attorney, David Gordon, piped up from the back of the room. He said, &quot;Out<br/>
of the 60,000 members, if I got 1 call a day [about CPS problems]--about<br/>
200 per year-- which I don&#39;t, that would equal only 1/3 of 1% of members.<br/>
Nobody here should be afraid. Most [CPS] reports come through public<br/>
schools. Nine out of ten end up unfounded or unsubstantiated.&quot;<br/>
	Of course, this brief statement did little to alleviate the fears<br/>
promoted by the talk and materials. Furthermore, I had the distinct<br/>
impression this comment was not a usual part of the presentation, but was<br/>
added because of my presence--as was Woodruff&#39;s disclaimer, after the<br/>
first break, stating that &quot;HSLDA speaks only for it&#39;s members, and we try<br/>
to make that clear.&quot;<br/>
	Interestingly, during the panel discussion at day&#39;s end, someone asked a<br/>
question like, &quot;How can homeschoolers make ourselves less of a target for<br/>
CPS?&quot; The HSLDA response (Woodruff, I believe, but I didn&#39;t write it in<br/>
my notes) was, &quot;Don&#39;t physically punish your children in public.&quot; That<br/>
was *the* answer.<br/>
	Also during the panel discussion, someone asked about daytime curfews.<br/>
The panel speakers used scary phrases like the &quot;police take your child to<br/>
the closest public school or curfew center.&quot;  I forget exactly who was<br/>
speaking, but I got the impression that the speakers implied that daytime<br/>
curfews are a continuing possibility, especially when someone said, &quot;let<br/>
HSLDA know that your area is considering a daytime curfew.&quot; None of the<br/>
panel mentioned that, here in VA, the law was amended last year to<br/>
specifically prohibit daytime curfews; any locality that institutes one<br/>
is in violation of state law. Not exactly a small omission. The speaker<br/>
also urged support group leaders to contact HSLDA if a daytime curfew<br/>
were in the works in their area--not to simply point out to legislators<br/>
that such acts are illegal.<br/>

    &quot;The Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) is the answer...&quot; <br/>
*snip*<br/>
<br/>
This is a hot spot of sorts for me. In the state of Michigan 1, I repeat 1 <br/>
homeschooling family (to my knowledge) has been truly involved in Social <br/>
Services. They were abusive. end of that story. <br/>
    I agree with what you are saying. I called HSLDA and asked them questions <br/>
like the what if scenarios. They told me that if I was not already a member, <br/>
they would not take my case. Soooo, If the police come here, take my child, <br/>
and tell me that I have to put him in PS, I grab my trusty telephone, dial up <br/>
HSLDA, finally get a human, I am told sorry, we cannot help you. The state of <br/>
Michigan (to my humble knowledge) does not even have a HSLDA representative. <br/>
    I can say that Michigan Social Services can be truly deceiving in the <br/>
ways they approach their &quot;victims&quot;. My dh is the head of security for their <br/>
office here, and I have witnessed some devious tactics. BUT when they heard I <br/>
was homeschooling, they never said a bad word about it. I have even loaned <br/>
out some of my books to caseworkers (for their children). Since my decision <br/>
(June 99) I have not had one CPS (children&#39;s protective services) worker at <br/>
my door. (Other than a friend who incidentally works there, we attend the <br/>
same church, LOL)<br/>
    my personal insight of HSLDA is NOT to go through them. If you feel you <br/>
need a backbone through the law, hire an attorney. Tell him your fears, and <br/>
he will snuff them directly. So for the cost of  the initial visit (usually <br/>
free to $50) you have the same  backing, but with half the money. IF you ever <br/>
need something for the state, you can call your lawyer (and speak to him WOW) <br/>
and find out if it is something small or if you need to actually do <br/>
something! <br/>
     I have an attorney here in Michigan. I call and normally speak directly <br/>
with him. Even better yet, I call him by the same nickname his wife uses. He <br/>
is helping me through protecting one of my children from his father. I can <br/>
normally call him at any time, and I have his HOME NUMBER on my card!!!! I <br/>
have asked him homeschool-related questions before. He writes them down, <br/>
finds out and gets back with me. he hasn&#39;t added them to the bill (yet, lol) <br/>
    IMHO, I would rather see a law firm that I know is in the best interest <br/>
of me. One that I can stop by and get answers, and that I will see the same <br/>
lawyer every time that I need one. I would rather pay to have the same person <br/>
(who is knowledgeable of the case) than one of 100, who were pushed into it <br/>
for today... <br/>
    You could pay $100 every year and not need them until your child is in <br/>
the 8th grade ($800) or call a private attorney and have him do it for $200. <br/>
I cannot afford to pay an entity $100 a year, even if it is for the cover <br/>
net. I take the chance, heck, by homeschooling I am taking a chance. the <br/>
chance of a better education, future, and life. Just by homeschooling, I am <br/>
different -- strange -- not in the norm -- why conform to money hungry people <br/>
now?<br/>
    I have seriously considered going into the law practice. Just for the <br/>
homeschooling families. HSLDA makes me want to even more. <br/>
    Okay, I give the soapbox up, ever so unwillingly......for now!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095025165">That is H$LDA in a nut shell.  What amazes is they seem to be a magnat for<br/>
folks such as Scott who is less crediable at practicing law than the<br/>
average legal secretary!  I&#39;ve seen some of the messes he has made of<br/>
things and the forms he has put together so that folks will be within<br/>
existing laws and they stunk!  I mean, I really would like a lawyer to put<br/>
together a form for me that starts out by me admitting that I knew I was<br/>
breaking the law.<br/>
<br/>
And all this nonsense about CPS is just that.  By using their advise of<br/>
calling H$LDA before you answer the door, blocking the door, sending your<br/>
kids to hide in another room, you justify investigating a report.<br/>
<br/>
And some of the horror stories they come up with really make me wonder! <br/>
Like the store clerks threatening to turn you in because you swat a kid for<br/>
misbehaving.  Most store clerks couldn&#39;t get out of their own way or be<br/>
bothered to even provide the minimum of service let alone take time to make<br/>
a complaint.  What do these folks do, walk around using the Ezzo sticks in<br/>
public??<br/>
<br/>
My ex-MIL from h*ll turned me in and I have CPS on my doorstep when I got<br/>
back from the store (kidlets were out back with the dogs playing) which was<br/>
on the same block as our house.  The guy explained why he was there and I<br/>
laughed.  I told him to go talk to MIL and then call me.  Well, she took<br/>
care of the call, alright!  The guy called me back and told me that he had<br/>
flagged my file and put a synopsis of his visit with MIL in there.  He<br/>
ended the call by asking how I had managed to stay married as long as I had<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you treat the vast majority of these folks like people instead of with<br/>
paranoia, you get treated the same.  But then, who would join H$LDA??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-475124297">Speaking of no lawyer in your state, that is another area that they<br/>
conveniently gloss over.  They have 7 attorneys who are licensed at last<br/>
count to practice in 11 states.  So, even if you were lucky enough to get<br/>
one in the office (I mean, after all, politics are their priority so they<br/>
are usually out making a bigger mess of politics), your chance of getting<br/>
one that even knows the laws in your particlur state are very slim.  Not<br/>
only that, half of what they have up on their website as hsing laws for<br/>
particular states is not accurate or is their own personal idea of what a<br/>
state law means and quite frequently way out in left field.  I know they<br/>
had a real mess proclaiming to be the laws here in CA.  Haven&#39;t looked<br/>
lately to see if they had corrected it.<br/>

&gt; That is H$LDA in a nut shell.  What amazes is they seem to be a magnat for<br/>
&gt; folks such as Scott who is less crediable at practicing law than the<br/>
&gt; average legal secretary!  I&#39;ve seen some of the messes he has made of<br/>
&gt; things and the forms he has put together so that folks will be within<br/>
&gt; existing laws and they stunk!  I mean, I really would like a lawyer to put<br/>
&gt; together a form for me that starts out by me admitting that I knew I was<br/>
&gt; breaking the law.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And all this nonsense about CPS is just that.  By using their advise of<br/>
&gt; calling H$LDA before you answer the door, blocking the door, sending your<br/>
&gt; kids to hide in another room, you justify investigating a report.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And some of the horror stories they come up with really make me wonder!<br/>
&gt; Like the store clerks threatening to turn you in because you swat a kid<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; misbehaving.  Most store clerks couldn&#39;t get out of their own way or be<br/>

make<br/>
&gt; a complaint.  What do these folks do, walk around using the Ezzo sticks in<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; My ex-MIL from h*ll turned me in and I have CPS on my doorstep when I got<br/>
&gt; back from the store (kidlets were out back with the dogs playing) which<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; on the same block as our house.  The guy explained why he was there and I<br/>
&gt; laughed.  I told him to go talk to MIL and then call me.  Well, she took<br/>
&gt; care of the call, alright!  The guy called me back and told me that he had<br/>
&gt; flagged my file and put a synopsis of his visit with MIL in there.  He<br/>
&gt; ended the call by asking how I had managed to stay married as long as I<br/>
had<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Something of interest...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;some H$LDA paranoia/fear encouraging garbage.  Am I ever grateful<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; NHEN is now here and will be making REAL information available to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; public and homeschoolers alike so that this continue misinformation that<br/>
&gt; &gt; is self-serving from H$LDA will be<br/>
&gt; &gt; seen for what it is!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This is closely related to a topic I&#39;ve been investigating--the fear<br/>
&gt; &gt; inducing element of HSLDA. Last month I attended their Support Group<br/>
&gt; &gt; Seminar, and was struck by several things, including the information and<br/>
&gt; &gt; discussion about the threat to homescholers by Social Services. One of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the presentations was titled &quot;What Parents Should Know About Child<br/>
&gt; &gt; Welfare Agencies.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Scott Woodruff regaled us with tales of CPS folks and assorted law<br/>
&gt; &gt; officers forcing their way into peoples&#39; homes, and claiming they were<br/>
&gt; &gt; admitted voluntarily.  He told a horror story of a family whose children<br/>
&gt; &gt; were clued in, by CPS questioners, to the possibilities of child sexual<br/>
&gt; &gt; abuse. He gave plenty of advice on how to handle such situations, and,<br/>
&gt; &gt; when asked, said that the number of homeschoolers falsely accused of<br/>
&gt; &gt; child abuse/neglect was a &quot;chronic, steady&quot; number, with occasional<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;rashes,&quot; such as an increase in the number of &quot;kids left in the car&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; complaints.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Evonne Bunn, HEAV Exec. Director, interrupted Woodruff, to say that her<br/>
&gt; &gt; organization &quot;will most often refer parents to HSLDA, and recommend you<br/>
&gt; &gt; join because you can&#39;t forsee problems.&quot; Woodruff replied with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; recommendation on the HEAV homeschool manual, and especially its legal<br/>
&gt; &gt; section.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Accompanying all this frightening talk was the 16 page &quot;Dealing With<br/>
&gt; &gt; Social Services Contacts&quot; section of the seminar workbook. The first<br/>
page<br/>
&gt; &gt; of that section begins with this: &quot;More and more frequently, home<br/>
&gt; &gt; schoolers are turned in on child abuse hotlines to social services<br/>
&gt; &gt; agencies. Families who do not like homeschoolers can make an anonymous<br/>
&gt; &gt; phone call to the child abuse hotline and fabricate abuse stories about<br/>
&gt; &gt; home schoolers. The social worker then has the obligation to<br/>
investigate.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Each state has a different policy for social workers, but generally they<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to come into the family&#39;s home and speak with the children<br/>
&gt; &gt; separately. To allow either of these to occur involves great risk to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; family.&quot; The last 10 pages of this section include &quot;How to Handle Visits<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;From Social Service Agencies,&quot; which uses two fear-inducing scenarios<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; illustrate how to and now not to handle social workers.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The seminar workbook also includes a 5 page publication titled &quot;What Is<br/>
&gt; &gt; HSLDA?&quot; which starts with, &quot;A truant officer is at the door. He pushes<br/>
&gt; &gt; his way in. He will not leave until he can take your children to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; public school. What can you do?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;A police officer is at your door with an arrest warrant to take your<br/>
&gt; &gt; six year-old child. Who can you call?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;The local public school official insists that your home school<br/>
&gt; &gt; arrangement is not legal and threatens you with criminal charges. Where<br/>
&gt; &gt; can you get help *fast?*<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;The Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) is the answer...&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The irony was revealed when, during Woodruff&#39;s talk, another HSLDA<br/>
&gt; &gt; attorney, David Gordon, piped up from the back of the room. He said,<br/>
&quot;Out<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the 60,000 members, if I got 1 call a day [about CPS problems]--about<br/>
&gt; &gt; 200 per year-- which I don&#39;t, that would equal only 1/3 of 1% of<br/>
members.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nobody here should be afraid. Most [CPS] reports come through public<br/>
&gt; &gt; schools. Nine out of ten end up unfounded or unsubstantiated.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course, this brief statement did little to alleviate the fears<br/>
&gt; &gt; promoted by the talk and materials. Furthermore, I had the distinct<br/>
&gt; &gt; impression this comment was not a usual part of the presentation, but<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt; added because of my presence--as was Woodruff&#39;s disclaimer, after the<br/>
&gt; &gt; first break, stating that &quot;HSLDA speaks only for it&#39;s members, and we<br/>
try<br/>
&gt; &gt; to make that clear.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Interestingly, during the panel discussion at day&#39;s end, someone asked a<br/>
&gt; &gt; question like, &quot;How can homeschoolers make ourselves less of a target<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; CPS?&quot; The HSLDA response (Woodruff, I believe, but I didn&#39;t write it in<br/>
&gt; &gt; my notes) was, &quot;Don&#39;t physically punish your children in public.&quot; That<br/>
&gt; &gt; was *the* answer.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also during the panel discussion, someone asked about daytime curfews.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The panel speakers used scary phrases like the &quot;police take your child<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the closest public school or curfew center.&quot;  I forget exactly who was<br/>
&gt; &gt; speaking, but I got the impression that the speakers implied that<br/>
daytime<br/>
&gt; &gt; curfews are a continuing possibility, especially when someone said, &quot;let<br/>
&gt; &gt; HSLDA know that your area is considering a daytime curfew.&quot; None of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; panel mentioned that, here in VA, the law was amended last year to<br/>
&gt; &gt; specifically prohibit daytime curfews; any locality that institutes one<br/>
&gt; &gt; is in violation of state law. Not exactly a small omission. The speaker<br/>
&gt; &gt; also urged support group leaders to contact HSLDA if a daytime curfew<br/>
&gt; &gt; were in the works in their area--not to simply point out to legislators<br/>
&gt; &gt; that such acts are illegal.<br/>

&gt;     &quot;A police officer is at your door with an arrest warrant to take your<br/>

&gt;     &quot;The Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) is the answer...&quot;<br/>
&gt; *snip*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is a hot spot of sorts for me. In the state of Michigan 1, I repeat 1<br/>
&gt; homeschooling family (to my knowledge) has been truly involved in Social<br/>
&gt; Services. They were abusive. end of that story.<br/>
&gt;     I agree with what you are saying. I called HSLDA and asked them<br/>
questions<br/>
&gt; like the what if scenarios. They told me that if I was not already a<br/>
member,<br/>
&gt; they would not take my case. Soooo, If the police come here, take my<br/>
child,<br/>
&gt; and tell me that I have to put him in PS, I grab my trusty telephone, dial<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; HSLDA, finally get a human, I am told sorry, we cannot help you. The state<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; Michigan (to my humble knowledge) does not even have a HSLDA<br/>
representative.<br/>
&gt;     I can say that Michigan Social Services can be truly deceiving in the<br/>
&gt; ways they approach their &quot;victims&quot;. My dh is the head of security for<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; office here, and I have witnessed some devious tactics. BUT when they<br/>
heard I<br/>
&gt; was homeschooling, they never said a bad word about it. I have even loaned<br/>
&gt; out some of my books to caseworkers (for their children). Since my<br/>
decision<br/>
&gt; (June 99) I have not had one CPS (children&#39;s protective services) worker<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; my door. (Other than a friend who incidentally works there, we attend the<br/>
&gt; same church, LOL)<br/>
&gt;     my personal insight of HSLDA is NOT to go through them. If you feel<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; need a backbone through the law, hire an attorney. Tell him your fears,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; he will snuff them directly. So for the cost of  the initial visit<br/>
(usually<br/>
&gt; free to $50) you have the same  backing, but with half the money. IF you<br/>
ever<br/>
&gt; need something for the state, you can call your lawyer (and speak to him<br/>
WOW)<br/>
&gt; and find out if it is something small or if you need to actually do<br/>
&gt; something!<br/>
&gt;      I have an attorney here in Michigan. I call and normally speak<br/>
directly<br/>
&gt; with him. Even better yet, I call him by the same nickname his wife uses.<br/>
He<br/>
&gt; is helping me through protecting one of my children from his father. I can<br/>
&gt; normally call him at any time, and I have his HOME NUMBER on my card!!!! I<br/>
&gt; have asked him homeschool-related questions before. He writes them down,<br/>
&gt; finds out and gets back with me. he hasn&#39;t added them to the bill (yet,<br/>
lol)<br/>
&gt;     IMHO, I would rather see a law firm that I know is in the best<br/>
interest<br/>
&gt; of me. One that I can stop by and get answers, and that I will see the<br/>
same<br/>
&gt; lawyer every time that I need one. I would rather pay to have the same<br/>
person<br/>
&gt; (who is knowledgeable of the case) than one of 100, who were pushed into<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; for today...<br/>
&gt;     You could pay $100 every year and not need them until your child is in<br/>
&gt; the 8th grade ($800) or call a private attorney and have him do it for<br/>
$200.<br/>
&gt; I cannot afford to pay an entity $100 a year, even if it is for the cover<br/>
&gt; net. I take the chance, heck, by homeschooling I am taking a chance. the<br/>
&gt; chance of a better education, future, and life. Just by homeschooling, I<br/>
am<br/>
&gt; different -- strange -- not in the norm -- why conform to money hungry<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;some H$LDA paranoia/fear encouraging garbage.  Am I ever grateful<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; NHEN is now here and will be making REAL information available to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; public and homeschoolers alike so that this continue misinformation<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; is self-serving from H$LDA will be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; seen for what it is!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is closely related to a topic I&#39;ve been investigating--the fear<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; inducing element of HSLDA. Last month I attended their Support Group<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Seminar, and was struck by several things, including the information<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion about the threat to homescholers by Social Services. One<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; the presentations was titled &quot;What Parents Should Know About Child<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Welfare Agencies.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Scott Woodruff regaled us with tales of CPS folks and assorted law<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; officers forcing their way into peoples&#39; homes, and claiming they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>were<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; admitted voluntarily.  He told a horror story of a family whose<br/>
 </span></blockquote>children<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; were clued in, by CPS questioners, to the possibilities of child<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sexual<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; abuse. He gave plenty of advice on how to handle such situations,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; when asked, said that the number of homeschoolers falsely accused of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; child abuse/neglect was a &quot;chronic, steady&quot; number, with occasional<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;rashes,&quot; such as an increase in the number of &quot;kids left in the car&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; complaints.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Evonne Bunn, HEAV Exec. Director, interrupted Woodruff, to say that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>her<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; organization &quot;will most often refer parents to HSLDA, and recommend<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; join because you can&#39;t forsee problems.&quot; Woodruff replied with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; recommendation on the HEAV homeschool manual, and especially its<br/>
 </span></blockquote>legal<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; section.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Accompanying all this frightening talk was the 16 page &quot;Dealing With<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Social Services Contacts&quot; section of the seminar workbook. The first<br/>
&gt; page<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of that section begins with this: &quot;More and more frequently, home<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; schoolers are turned in on child abuse hotlines to social services<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; agencies. Families who do not like homeschoolers can make an<br/>
 </span></blockquote>anonymous<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; phone call to the child abuse hotline and fabricate abuse stories<br/>
 </span></blockquote>about<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; home schoolers. The social worker then has the obligation to<br/>
&gt; investigate.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Each state has a different policy for social workers, but generally<br/>
 </span></blockquote>they<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; want to come into the family&#39;s home and speak with the children<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; separately. To allow either of these to occur involves great risk to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; family.&quot; The last 10 pages of this section include &quot;How to Handle<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Visits<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From Social Service Agencies,&quot; which uses two fear-inducing<br/>
 </span></blockquote>scenarios<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; illustrate how to and now not to handle social workers.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The seminar workbook also includes a 5 page publication titled &quot;What<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; HSLDA?&quot; which starts with, &quot;A truant officer is at the door. He<br/>
 </span></blockquote>pushes<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; his way in. He will not leave until he can take your children to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; public school. What can you do?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;A police officer is at your door with an arrest warrant to take your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; six year-old child. Who can you call?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The local public school official insists that your home school<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; arrangement is not legal and threatens you with criminal charges.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; can you get help *fast?*<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) is the answer...&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The irony was revealed when, during Woodruff&#39;s talk, another HSLDA<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; attorney, David Gordon, piped up from the back of the room. He said,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the 60,000 members, if I got 1 call a day [about CPS<br/>
 </span></blockquote>problems]--about<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; 200 per year-- which I don&#39;t, that would equal only 1/3 of 1% of<br/>
&gt; members.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nobody here should be afraid. Most [CPS] reports come through public<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; schools. Nine out of ten end up unfounded or unsubstantiated.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, this brief statement did little to alleviate the fears<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; promoted by the talk and materials. Furthermore, I had the distinct<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; impression this comment was not a usual part of the presentation, but<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; added because of my presence--as was Woodruff&#39;s disclaimer, after the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; first break, stating that &quot;HSLDA speaks only for it&#39;s members, and we<br/>
&gt; try<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to make that clear.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, during the panel discussion at day&#39;s end, someone<br/>
 </span></blockquote>asked a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; question like, &quot;How can homeschoolers make ourselves less of a target<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; CPS?&quot; The HSLDA response (Woodruff, I believe, but I didn&#39;t write it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; my notes) was, &quot;Don&#39;t physically punish your children in public.&quot;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; was *the* answer.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also during the panel discussion, someone asked about daytime<br/>
 </span></blockquote>curfews.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; The panel speakers used scary phrases like the &quot;police take your<br/>
 </span></blockquote>child<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the closest public school or curfew center.&quot;  I forget exactly who<br/>
 </span></blockquote>was<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; speaking, but I got the impression that the speakers implied that<br/>
&gt; daytime<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; curfews are a continuing possibility, especially when someone said,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;let<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; HSLDA know that your area is considering a daytime curfew.&quot; None of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; panel mentioned that, here in VA, the law was amended last year to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; specifically prohibit daytime curfews; any locality that institutes<br/>
 </span></blockquote>one<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; is in violation of state law. Not exactly a small omission. The<br/>
 </span></blockquote>speaker<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; also urged support group leaders to contact HSLDA if a daytime curfew<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; were in the works in their area--not to simply point out to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>legislators<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; that such acts are illegal.<br/>
