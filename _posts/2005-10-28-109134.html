<div id="ygrps-yiv-248552302">Just an observation from our move from Florida to New Mexico in  August.  <br/>
Lots of changes...unfamiliar house,  new family and friends  to get to know, more <br/>
cable channels, complete change of our routines and  surroundings.<br/>
 <br/>
Many things have been similar to our early deschooling days.  Logan  has gone <br/>
back to long days and nights of TV watching, playing video  games, not eating <br/>
unless I put the food out or my asking if he was  hungry.  He&#39;s happily gone <br/>
with us on some outings but often has just  wanted to stay home.  Mostly he&#39;s <br/>
watched things like Braniac and  Mythbusters but also gone back and played <br/>
many of his old PS2 and Gamecube  games. Many days he has just stayed in his <br/>
pajamas and watched TV all day  long.<br/>
 <br/>
This week I&#39;ve seen a complete change.  First, hours of just  staring into <br/>
space thinking and then nonstop talking about all the plans he  has for building <br/>
things.  All of a sudden he has all these plans to  build rockets and cars <br/>
and robots. We were at Home Depot for over an hour last  night and he stood in <br/>
the PVC aisle the entire time thinking.  He was  so excited about all the <br/>
possibilities.  When I went to bed last night he  had gathered supplies and is <br/>
completely immersed in building a rocket car that  he plans to shoot off when Broc <br/>
gets home from work.<br/>
 <br/>
I think the TV watching helped him to handle the move away from his friends  <br/>
and cousins in Florida and he&#39;s now re-energized and feeling creative  again.  <br/>
Wondering if some of you have experienced anything similar with a  move?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571906815">We&#39;ve been going through alot of the same things too.<br/>
We moved back tio San Diego from Michigan in March, and even though it was a coming home of sorts, things didn&#39;t work out as smoothly as we had hoped. We got stranded in Kansas after our car blew up, once we got to San Diego we ended up homeless for a few months. Teh kids were great, they took everything in stride and really helped to hold us all together.<br/>
We are now in our own place and doing well, but Jaiden kinda pulled a 180 on us, he asked to join a charter school this year and has been busy making scheduals for himself. I&#39;m guessing after everything he&#39;s been through he feels the need for some structure. <br/>

Yes, in our lives moving plus more TV channels plus more social anxiety <br/>
equaled son wanting to stay home a lot more.<br/>
<br/>
I have an only child, and we moved to a place with very little going on <br/>
in terms of homeschooling groups.  A difference in either of these <br/>
factors probably would have changed the behavior a lot.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We did a move, family blend, vacation, and brand-new fall <br/>
schedule/responsibilities! <br/>
The co-family situation is just what it is: I live with a very <br/>
school-centric family, who&#39;s children are with me in my atmosphere with <br/>
my lifestyle anytime they choose(after school, before mom gets home + <br/>
evenings, mostly), it&#39;s pretty cool.  Some of the weird clique-y things <br/>
are not so cool (Are you playing with *her*? she&#39;s only 7!), but I&#39;ve <br/>
been really impressed with how Hannah, 9, is handling herself in the <br/>
presence of a pretty strong, opinionated 10 year old (I&#39;ve known her <br/>
most of my life! she replied and returned to play).  She doesn&#39;t try to <br/>
compete with the stories of school and recess, she listens to her friend <br/>
and they mostly do *girl* things, not *school* things. Sometimes I <br/>
worry, but not in the end-of-the-world kind of way, but more like the &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t wanna deal with this&quot; kinda way; Hannah does complain when feeling <br/>
overwhelmed and isn&#39;t afraid to call time out and demand space to <br/>
herself or just us.  Hayden, 7, had struggled with the twin brother, <br/>
mostly over the boy&#39;s obsession with playing Hayden&#39;s PS2.  I&#39;ve had <br/>
some talks with both boys, encouraging empathy and patience with one <br/>
another, but allowing Hayden to maintain control over something so <br/>
precious while his life was filled with Chaos.  It took about 6 weeks,  <br/>
just last week Hayden approached him and offered Lego Star Wars.  <br/>
Hayden&#39;s made very clear boundaries and I&#39;ve no doubt they&#39;ll be <br/>
honored.  Things are being unpacked and finding homes, it doesn&#39;t feel <br/>
so much like *someone else&#39;s house* anymore and that makes a huge <br/>
difference.  Though they spent many weeks having no opinion on what goes <br/>
where and why, suddenly, they&#39;re suggesting furniture arrangements.  The <br/>
kids spent lots of time sleeping, grazing, watching lots of TV -- just <br/>
as you described, they&#39;re excited (the conference definitely helped!) <br/>
and energized.  Tonight we&#39;re off to Hannah&#39;s concert with the Sioux <br/>
Falls Girls Chorale (doesn&#39;t that sound fancy!), she&#39;s very excited!  <br/>
They both begin &#39;Y&#39; basketball on Saturday.   Our life isn&#39;t as much <br/>
&quot;hanging out &#39;round the house&quot; as it was this summer, and it&#39;s a tough <br/>
adjustment, but we&#39;re adapting and it&#39;s peaceful and fun :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458699714">Tonight I logged on to read this list after a long move-related<br/>
absence, and I get to read just the posts that I really needed!<br/>
<br/>
We moved from Minnesota to Virginia in late August, but we haven&#39;t yet<br/>
been able to make it feel at all like a home. We&#39;re staying with<br/>
relatives for at least a couple more months, so we have been trying to<br/>
fit our stuff into two (quite small) bedrooms. Then to complicate<br/>
matters, when we had been here for three weeks, my mother-in-law had a<br/>
stroke, and we all went to Bolivia for almost a month. <br/>
<br/>
Gabriel (9) has been incredibly understanding, but its been really<br/>
hard for him. We moved out of a housing situation in which he had two<br/>
parks, a field, and about 12 friends literally out the back door.<br/>
Arlington is quite a culture shock, and he misses his friends, and we<br/>
don&#39;t get out nearly enough to expend some of that energy. We&#39;d gone<br/>
to a couple park days of a local unschooling group, but then we missed<br/>
four or five, and when we went the other week, Gabriel was feeling<br/>
very shy (unusual for him), and just sat next to me, even though the<br/>
other kids eventually came over and asked him to play.<br/>
<br/>
I had been worrying (silently) about Gabriel&#39;s staying up so late. His<br/>
most recent schedule includes playing video games (Fantastic 4) or<br/>
watching tv (mostly cartoons) until like 3 or 4 in the morning, and<br/>
sleeping until 2 in the afternoon. I will try to worry a little less,<br/>
and see if it doesn&#39;t change once we actually start to settle in. For<br/>
my sake, I hope these late nights don&#39;t last, because I&#39;ll be working<br/>
a late shift starting next week, and if he gets up at 2pm, I&#39;ll only<br/>
get to hang out with him for 2 hours, tops. I suppose I could be with<br/>
him when I get home, but I also have a 1-year-old, who&#39;s not gonna let<br/>
me sleep late to make up for it.<br/>
<br/>
so glad to have this list,<br/>
<br/>
Gwen</div>
