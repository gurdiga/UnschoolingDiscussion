My Jalen (2 in Feb.) mostly  points at things and says &quot;tttthhhhhh&quot; sounds <br/>
kinda like &quot;ttttssss&quot; like a &quot;t&quot; and then &quot;th&quot; sound linked.<br/>
It&#39;s something none of the other kids did. He says it when he is excited <br/>
about something, wants you to look at or do something, uses it ALL the time.<br/>
He says several words, but not often and never, ever two words strung <br/>
together.<br/>
Let&#39;s see...he says stop, mine, Ma, Da, koo-koo (cookie), NaNa (for nursing),<br/>
Daredare (for Jared), yes, no and  a few other simple words.<br/>
People comment now because he doesn&#39;t really talk.<br/>
When he&#39;s got something to say, he communicates very well, just not with <br/>
words yet.<br/>
<br/>
The words will come when he&#39;s good and ready. He says a new one almost every <br/>
day now...my little mimic.<br/>

Caeleb&#39;s big thing is uh-huh-uh-huh.  It&#39;s very sing-song and he uses that <br/>
for EVERYTHING, too.  I will be SO sad when he stops doing that.  I bet <br/>
you&#39;ll miss Jalen&#39;s ttthhhhh when it&#39;s gone. :(<br/>
<br/>
The girls just love trying to get Caeleb to mimic them.  Of course, little <br/>
stinkers, their favorite things to get him to say are poo-poo, tee-tee, <br/>
anything for a huge giggle.  And don&#39;t you just know that he picks those up <br/>
right away! LOL  He thinks he is SO funny because they all just erupt into <br/>
mountains of laughter when he says those things.  He is quite proud of <br/>
himself.  I told them this morning they need to act like drink is the most <br/>
hilarious word in the world, so he will start using it.  For some reason, <br/>
they don&#39;t think THAT is very fun!  Hmmm, go figure...lol.<br/>

think that is the title. It talks about a woman who can communicate with all <br/>

No, I haven&#39;t, but it sounds interesting. I&#39;ll have to check it out next time <br/>
I&#39;m at the bookstore or library.<br/>
Tell your neighbor to say &quot;tsssss&quot; a lot and nod sympathetically. :)<br/>
