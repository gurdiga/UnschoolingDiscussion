I admit I laughed with delight when I read this!  You&#39;re right, it sounds as though I wouldn&#39;t &quot;allow&quot; vomiting, etc., but in fact that has happened and I didn&#39;t give it a second thought.  Somehow it seems different, but I see your point!  Thanks for the refreshing viewpoint! :)<br/>
