<div id="ygrps-yiv-44418248">WOW! I never expected all that disagreement about violent cartoons!  <br/>
Every family, every child, is different, but I really thought that <br/>
watching too many &quot;Wham, Thwack&quot; cartoons pretty universally led to <br/>
more &quot;wham, thwack&quot; behavior.  My kids do love Lord of the Rings and <br/>
play sword fight, I&#39;m not completely suppressive of their warlike <br/>
instincts!  In fact, they had made swords several times out of <br/>
cardboard that eventually fell apart, so for Christmas they got LotR <br/>
swords.  I have three boys and my sister has two, grandma got all of <br/>
them a sword and they all &quot;play fought&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
However, in my opinion, play sword fighting (with cardboard or <br/>
plastic) lacks the element of danger that hand to hand combat <br/>
presents.  In a way, the swords do the fighting, not the boys <br/>
themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, my main point was that it&#39;s probably not the best idea for a <br/>
parent to instigate the &quot;fight&quot;.  The cartoon comment was only meant <br/>
as an aside!<br/>
<br/>
i also want to respond to Rachel herself about her child&#39;s need for <br/>
extra physical contact.  Although i have no direct experience with <br/>
this, my husband is a teacher of children with special needs, and <br/>
spent two years in an autism unit.  (For those of you who are <br/>
saying, &quot;wait, they unschool and he&#39;s a TEACHER?&quot;, yes.  It may seem <br/>
odd, but there are more teachers than you think who know the system <br/>
is completely broken and choose to pull their own children out of it)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, i asked him about the &quot;proprioceptive input&quot;.  We discussed <br/>
possible options to play fighting, and we thought maybe learning deep <br/>
tissue massage might be helpful for you with your son.  he also said <br/>
that wrapping a child tightly in a heavy blanket sometimes feels good <br/>
to them.  <br/>
<br/>
Again, I&#39;m not walking in your shoes and I&#39;m not trying to tell you <br/>
how to treat your own child, just trying to answer your call for help!</div>

Once something is laid on the table it is fair game, we lose control over <br/>
where it goes, LOL. <br/>
<br/>
I have been on several lists where the original poster became upset over the <br/>
course of discussion their post took.  I always hope that the author of the <br/>
original post realizes that not every comment is meant for them as I sometimes <br/>
get the impression that they begin to feel like that.  Often by the time a <br/>
thread dies no one even remembers who started it and the many twists and turns <br/>
some threads take do not even resemble the original post.<br/>

That&#39;s what &quot;they&quot; say.<br/>
<br/>
They also say school is necessary, kids can&#39;t learn to read, that if you <br/>
don&#39;t prevent it, kids will do nothing all day except watch tv or play video games.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out they&#39;re wrong!<br/>
<br/>
It takes courage to just turn and go where others have said is &quot;DANGER <br/>
DANGER&quot; but unschooling seems to be one layer after another of discovering that the <br/>
warnings are put there to justify limiting and controlling children, and to <br/>
keep families conforming to telling kids bedtime is 8:00, no you can&#39;t watch <br/>
that, nobody your age can, etc.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Swords kill, people don&#39;t kill?&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids have played with all manner of toy swords, and you can get hurt being <br/>
 hit with any piece of hard plastic no matter what its shape.  Pointy hard <br/>
plastic?  You could put your eye out (or at least black it pretty well).<br/>
<br/>
I had a kid watch me do calligraphy for a while one day and then snort as he <br/>
left, &quot;The PEN does it.&quot;  Yes, I needed a particular kind of nib, but I was <br/>
doing the writing with that pen, and people with weapons are using the weappons.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  Lots of us were or are teachers.  We know.<br/>
<br/>
This inspired me to check the date you joined the list.  It has just been two <br/>
or three days.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please read a while longer, maybe read in the archives, maybe read at <br/>
www.unschooling.com  (the message boards there).  With such a large list, moderators <br/>
sometimes don&#39;t catch all the too-new posters.<br/>

<br/>
YES.  And putting someone&#39;s name (like mine&lt;g&gt;) on a response isn&#39;t helpful, <br/>
because we&#39;re writing to the hundreds of people getting individual e-mails, <br/>
and the thousand+ reading it at the site or in digest, and those who will join <br/>
in a month and read the old posts.<br/>
<br/>
So sometimes we end up being kind of direct and personal, but general and <br/>
philosophical is preferable to pointed and individual.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I needed this today, so thank you, Sandra.  We are one of those <br/>
families that switched almost overnight (just over 2 months ago) -- <br/>
from my 6-yr-old attending a &quot;back to basics&quot; school to unschooling, <br/>
from restricted TV, computer and video games to no restrictions, from <br/>
an 8:00 bedtime to &quot;it&#39;s time to go to your room because *I&#39;m* <br/>
tired,&quot; from insisting he try &quot;just one bite&quot; at dinner to letting <br/>
him eat when and what he wants.  I love where we are, and I&#39;m <br/>
completely sold on the whole thing -- but those outside DANGER <br/>
messages have been there an awfully long time.  I have my moments <br/>
when I&#39;m near tears because I&#39;m just sure I&#39;ve &quot;ruined everything.&quot;  <br/>
And then I breathe, and my husband says something sensible like &quot;No <br/>
way in hell would I put him back in school.&quot; &lt;g&gt;  Then I look at how <br/>
my son is jumping around, happy and carefree and watching TV, and <br/>
what great conversations we&#39;re having, and I keep sifting through my <br/>
own memories of not being respected and compare it to how we try to <br/>
respect my son.<br/>
<br/>
This is better.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
