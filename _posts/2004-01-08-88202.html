In fact I just washed some candy from halloween in a pillowcase LOL.  they<br/>
didn&#39;t finish it.  I had to rewash the whole load because it smelled like<br/>
candy, but at least it didn&#39;t get in the dryer!  Stepheny<br/>

Glad it missed the dryer!  YIKES!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really amazing ... my oldest is not a big candy eater. We would throw<br/>
away candy received at various holidays because it would be left uneaten. My<br/>
dh will eat anything that is in his reach ... even if the kids say, &quot;Please<br/>
don&#39;t eat this&quot; (like with the giant candy bars our neighbor gives our kids<br/>
each Halloween).  My other two kids are like this as well ... will eat candy<br/>
until they get sick, almost.  I think Michael did that the Christmas he was<br/>
2.  And, RJ was the one who was limited the most and had the best diet as a<br/>
toddler ... the &quot;first child&quot; syndrome and all that. LOL<br/>
<br/>
He is still my &quot;healthiest&quot; eater ... ate broccoli in the grocery store one<br/>
time, even.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843368102">Ok...I have to wonder something here...is this unschooling just a way to<br/>
say &quot;Do whatever you want&quot;?? I am very new to this theory and I just<br/>
need it clarified I guess. I am not even sure at this point this is how<br/>
I want to raise my kids. I read post after post about how you let your<br/>
kids choose what they want, when they want...I try to go with a very AP<br/>
minded philosophy. I feel it is very child led and gentle, but we<br/>
certainly have limits and boundaries and controls if you will on food<br/>
and media usage. Its just not healthy to eat junk food or candy. Its<br/>
just not healthy to sit and watch TV all the time. Its just not healthy<br/>
to let your kids do all this stuff, so why?? I am under the impression<br/>
that the child will eventually balance out and choose the &quot;right&quot; thing,<br/>
but how do they know what is right or wrong when they have been<br/>
submitted to all the commercialism on TV and all the junk in their<br/>
diets? As I stated in another post, I am pretty liberal about food<br/>
because I just cant limit my husband as much as I wish!! LOL But, I just<br/>
don&#39;t understand how this is helping and not hurting our kids in the<br/>
long run. It just seems to me that everyone should need to learn limits<br/>
and boundaries and who else will teach them? Please explain it to me as<br/>
if I was a kid! It would help me a lot. <br/>

I&#39;ve never tried to explain it to a kid.  I think it can only be explained to <br/>
someone who has lived some life and thought quite a bit about their own <br/>
backgrounds, those around them, and who has been somewhat analytical of what <br/>
they&#39;ve seen others attempt to do.<br/>

<br/>
You don&#39;t learn to make decisions from having other people make your <br/>
decisions. That just teaches you to learn to obey without really understanding.  When <br/>
people grow up that way, some of them quickly join the military, or find <br/>
friends who will tell them what to do, or marry someone controlling because they <br/>
haven&#39;t learned how to make their own decisions comfortably.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If there&#39;s only one &quot;right&quot; thing for you, you&#39;ll need to tell your children <br/>
what to do.<br/>
If you can relax to the point that you accept that perhaps there is a range <br/>
of healthy options, you and your children will probably be healthier and <br/>
happier.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

certainly have limits and boundaries and controls if you will on food<br/>

<br/>
My children don&#39;t sit and watch TV all the time.<br/>
They could, but they choose not to.<br/>
<br/>
Your children cannot choose not to if you don&#39;t let them choose.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s just not healthy to eat junk food or candy&quot;  requires some examination <br/>
of &quot;just&quot; and &quot;junk&quot; before we could discuss it clearly.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably healthier for a happy person to eat food of less nutritional <br/>
value than for an uptight person to eat the most ideal meal ever, ift hey eat it <br/>
with fear or resentment in their system.  It&#39;s hard to digest with negativity <br/>
pumping through the veins.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily those aren&#39;t the only two choices!  There&#39;s a whole spectrum of <br/>
reality.<br/>
<br/>
Please read my small collection on eating if you get time.   I hope someday <br/>
it will be too long for people to read all at one sitting, but now it&#39;s really <br/>
short.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to borrow this sentence and redo the ending.<br/>
<br/>
It just seems to me that everyone should need to learn limits and boundaries<br/>
and who else would know what&#39;s best for their bodies than the person<br/>
themselves? One can&#39;t choose what is best for another person. That&#39;s just<br/>
telling them what to do and that can build up resentments and lead to that<br/>
person just never being able to know for themselves. So they grow up looking<br/>
for others to help them out by telling them what to do. Or else go totally<br/>
the other way and create havoc in their lives by doing what they never were<br/>
&quot;allowed&quot; to do. And those people sometimes never see all that&#39;s in between.<br/>
I was one of those people who went crazy with freedom, couldn&#39;t find me and<br/>
ended up in a crappy &quot;here&#39;s what I want you to do&quot; marriage and inflicted<br/>
the same on one of my children. *That* isn&#39;t healthy. It took me until I was<br/>
well into my 30&#39;s and living with someone who wanted me to have a mind of my<br/>
own before I got it.<br/>
<br/>
And I had no horrible childhood. I had loving parents, just ones that told<br/>
me always what was acceptable and best and right and wrong. And that<br/>
followed me through life for a long time. That&#39;s not what I want for my<br/>
kids. I want them to know what&#39;s best for them. It isn&#39;t always going to be<br/>
what I would choose, but that&#39;s a good thing. I&#39;m not parenting little me&#39;s,<br/>
I&#39;m parenting individual beings.<br/>

love to play outside, go to play groups, play games, cook, read or be read <br/>

I have no research from unschooling families here to prove anything, just my <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s certainly not true in our life either.  My DD dosen&#39;t even like <br/>
candy and refuses when someone tries to give it to her.  She does <br/>
love popcicles but, we make our own and that&#39;s just frozen juice <br/>
so....is it really &quot;bad&quot; for her anyway?  She does, however, love <br/>
chips, any kind of chips.  There are lots of chips in our house but, <br/>
more often than not, she choses a banana or grapes rather than chips <br/>
to snack on.  Especially when she sees me make a smoothie for <br/>
breakfast in the morning.....that&#39;s what got her started on the <br/>
bananas and strawberries, she wanted to try what I was eating.    <br/>
<br/>
As for the tv, she likes to watch cartoons in the mornings but, she <br/>
does this while running around and playing with her toys so it&#39;s not <br/>
her just sitting in front of the tv.  In the afternoons she would <br/>
much rather be outside playing with her dog or riding on her &quot;car&quot; <br/>
than cooped up watching tv.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that, for the most part, when people say that their <br/>
kid would sit around eating candy and watching tv all day (if they <br/>
gave them the choice to do that) they haven&#39;t tried it and are just <br/>
assuming that is what would happen.  And, in the beginning, that <br/>
might be exactly what would happen but, in my experience, that only <br/>
happens in the beginning because they are testing to see how <br/>
resolved mom or dad really is to letting them make their own <br/>
decisions.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; It seems you are assuming that, given choices, children will choose to eat <br/>

<br/>
Yes, and the other side of that assumption is the assumption that the <br/>
children WOULD do all bad things all the time if it weren&#39;t for the virtue and hard <br/>
work of the mother.<br/>
<br/>
That can&#39;t help but be a growing wedge between parent and child.   If the <br/>
child is &quot;good&quot; by doing what the mother thinks went against the child&#39;s <br/>
instinct, that&#39;s a negative in the unschooling column (assumption that kids have wild, <br/>
unhealthy instincts).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve encountered mothers online who believe they taught their children to <br/>
walk and talk, and so they can easily teach their children to read and write, and <br/>
MUST, or else the child will grow up illiterate, not knowing which end of a <br/>
pencil does what.<br/>
<br/>
The easiest thing to do is such instances is to point out to them that <br/>
children learn to walk on their own just from having things to pull up on and a safe <br/>
space to try it (and kids will learn to walk even in the most dangerous of <br/>
places, truly), and they learn to talk because they WANT TO, and speech is all <br/>
around them, and they&#39;re smart enough to figure it out, including grammar and <br/>
levels of formality, if people just make sure they hear lots of people using <br/>
the language. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am not saying they never eat candy, but it sits there <br/>

<br/>
The only kids I&#39;ve ever seen finish ALL their candy are those whose parents <br/>

Reading them all in one place, it&#39;s fun to try to figure out WHY people would <br/>
say that about their own children.  It seems they&#39;re not looking directly at <br/>
their children in any way, but are looking out to the opinions of a million <br/>
unknown people.  For unschooling, it helps to turn around and look at and into <br/>
your child, directly, without filters.<br/>

My kids don&#39;t sit in front of the tv all day. They have days where tv is<br/>
enjoyable for them and days when it isn&#39;t turned on. My girls enjoy sweets<br/>
and my son does not. I never worry about them getting too much because they<br/>
eat what they want and put the rest away. We too still have major Halloween<br/>
candy left. I know from experience it will still be here at Easter. Although<br/>
they enjoy cake, candy and cookies, they also have certain tastes where they<br/>
like only certain things. They don&#39;t gobble up anything with sugar just<br/>
because.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I too could say it isn&#39;t healthy to sit in front of the tv all day<br/>
eating candy. But when I don&#39;t see that happening, it&#39;s not an issue. I&#39;m<br/>

of half watching and half reading email &lt;G&gt;) and Rosie just ate a bowl <br/>
of oatmeal and is now eating a little chunk of cheddar cheese and <br/>
sunflower seeds while drinking a glass of water. Rox isn&#39;t eating. I <br/>
had oatmeal and coffee. There are home-made caramel apples in the <br/>
kitchen as well as a box of chocolate candy that has been sitting there <br/>
since before Christmas and I think I&#39;m the only one who has eaten them. <br/>
There is a also a plate of baklava that was from before Christmas - my <br/>
husband had one last night. There are chocolate mint cookies someone <br/>
gave us before Christmas - in a bowl with a few little mini-banana <br/>
muffins. There is a bag of Jelly Bellies. With all the sweets sitting <br/>
around - they&#39;re going bad before we get around to eating them. Last <br/>
night we ate popcorn - no sweets except one piece of baklava that my dh <br/>
ate with his tea.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago Rosie got an urge for potato chips - she wanted a big <br/>
bag of them almost every day for about 2 weeks. So I got them - she ate <br/>
them - now she seems to have had her fill and hasn&#39;t asked again for <br/>
the past few weeks.<br/>

Nope. Vanilla cake, white frosting.<br/>

I know what you mean. We just had Joseph&#39;s birthday and my mom was going to<br/>
bake a cake but my oven isn&#39;t working right so we had to buy one instead.<br/>
Joseph always wants chocolate cake. He didn&#39;t even finish his piece. It was<br/>
a small cake so we had some left. My mom took a piece to her place and we<br/>
had leftover here. Tara had a piece and I ended up giving my mom more. I<br/>
still have that leftover cake in the fridge. We also still have leftover<br/>
birthday cookie from his party with his friends. Just sitting on the<br/>
counter. I actually end up throwing away more sweets than we eat. We buy<br/>
because it looks good and the first piece is great and then everyone has had<br/>
enough.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun ladies, I&#39;m off to see Elvis!!!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-886999525">I have a question I&#39;ve been wanting to ask for a while.<br/>
<br/>
We do not have restrictions on food. We had some until a couple of years <br/>
ago but really, I was careful to be easy-going about food becuase of the <br/>
food craziness I have had most of my life.<br/>
<br/>
I think I only know one family in real life who are &quot;unfooding&quot; i.e. don&#39;t <br/>
have restrictions on food. I know a large group of relaxed homeschoolers or <br/>
unschoolers but they all seem to have food issues. Since we usually get <br/>
several chances to chat during the week, what can I say to get them to <br/>
consider unfooding? I am so sick of hearing them say &quot;My daughter eats <br/>
sugar right out of the bowl and she would do it all day if I let her,&quot; or <br/>
&quot;I have to watch Daisy like a hawk to make sure she doesn&#39;t eat all the <br/>
chocolate chips.&quot; And it bothers me to see the &quot;treats&quot; inhaled at communal <br/>
eating times because the kids know they better eat as much as possible <br/>
while they can. Now, I realize I mostly have to accept this, it will not <br/>
change, but I might get some to relax about it.<br/>
<br/>
I have often talked about what we do and how well it works, and I have even <br/>
started to talk about how wonderfully it has worked for me, but I feel so <br/>
strongly about this I would like help with stronger (or just better :-) <br/>
arguments that may sway them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828256268"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Please explain it to me as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>if I was a kid! It would help me a lot. <br/>
 <br/>
**We were at a holiday party last Sunday.  It was a brunch, with bagels<br/>
and latkes and applesauce (among other things), as well as chocolate<br/>
chip cookies and chocolate gelt.  Dagny and Rowan, who have always been<br/>
able to eat what, where, and whenever they choose, ate bagels with cream<br/>
cheese and latkes.  They played dreidel for the gelt, and when they were<br/>
done they just left it in a pile where they had found it without eating<br/>
any.  Dagny had two cookies, and Rowan didn&#39;t want any.  <br/>
 <br/>
Their cousin (who is four), on the other hand, only gets candy at home<br/>
if he unloads the silverware caddy in the dishwasher.   His sugar intake<br/>
is closely monitored.  They keep only &#39;healthy&#39; food in their house<br/>
(with the exception of the &#39;chore candy&#39;).  He cannot have certain foods<br/>
at certain times of day, and there are foods he&#39;s not allowed to have at<br/>
all.  They lift these restrictions at parties.  He did not eat any of<br/>
the brunch food.  He ate EVERY piece of gelt (maybe 25), chasing Rowan<br/>
through the house to get the last piece when she wanted to save it to<br/>
use for the dreidel.  Every 15 minutes his father would say, &quot;Are you<br/>
eating another cookie?  How many cookies have you eaten today?&quot; with an<br/>
uncomfortable little laugh.  I&#39;d guess he had 12-15 cookies in the three<br/>
hours we were there.<br/>
 <br/>
They&#39;re giving food a power in his life that it does not have for my<br/>
kids.  <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Its<br/>
 </span></blockquote>just not healthy to sit and watch TV all the time.<br/>
 <br/>
**There&#39;s an assumption here that given the freedom to choose how they<br/>
spend their time, children will choose to watch TV all day while gorging<br/>
themselves on sweets. This doesn&#39;t seem to me a very kind (or accurate)<br/>
way to view our children.  We have never limited content or quantity of<br/>
TV, and it&#39;s just one fun thing to do in a house (and world) full of fun<br/>
things to do.  <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I am under the impression<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that the child will eventually balance out and choose the &quot;right&quot; thing,<br/>
 <br/>
**Never having been limited or controlled, my kids have always chosen<br/>
what&#39;s right for them.  Who would know better than they what that is?<br/>

&lt;&lt; He is still my &quot;healthiest&quot; eater ... ate broccoli in the grocery store one<br/>
<br/>
time, even. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was a toddler my mom and I went to the store with him.  I thought <br/>
he was with her, she thought he was with me.   I stood still and listened; <br/>
heard nothing.  And I thought...   Produce.   He can reach food there.<br/>
<br/>
He was reaching up and getting one grape at a time with each hand and eating <br/>
one, and then reaching up for another, very daintily. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t know he was lost, so it was only scary for me.   I was able to act <br/>
cool when I got there so he didn&#39;t know anything scary had happened at all.<br/>

<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/eating/chocolate">http://sandradodd.com/eating/chocolate</a><br/>
<br/>
MAYBE you could write a little article and send them the link to that  or to<br/>
sandradodd.com/eating<br/>
and invite discussion on that list?<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s no place to write something to them, maybe just pointing out that <br/>
your kids aren&#39;t cookie-hogs because they have cookies at home IF someone says <br/>
anything about it.<br/>
<br/>
I know, sometimes the opportunity doesn&#39;t present itself.  Then sometimes it <br/>
DOES.  The receptionist at the orthodontist&#39;s the other day said, while Holly <br/>
was still out away from the desk said &quot;She has the greatest little <br/>
personality!  She&#39;s so outgoing.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I said thanks.<br/>
<br/>
She asked when Holly got out of school, and I said she&#39;s homeschooled (in way <br/>
of indicating morning appointments were fine) and she started in about her <br/>
own daughter whom she homeschooled with a curriculum one year, and who is having <br/>
a hard time in high school and is really unhappy.  She asked what curriculum <br/>
we used.  I pulled up a business card to give her, told her we didn&#39;t use one, <br/>
that her daughter didn&#39;t need to go to school, that maybe she could just take <br/>
some classes at TVI (the local technical school, which gives college credit <br/>
for lots of classes, and certificates for lots more), and recover at home, read <br/>
and hang out.   <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the opportunity jumps out there!<br/>

When he&#39;s grown, just think how much candy he&#39;ll feel justified in eating if <br/>
he repairs a dishwasher, or puts away ALL the dishes and washes all the pans, <br/>
or what if he were to pour concrete in the yard or plant trees!?  He would <br/>
earn POUNDS of candy.<br/>

(I say this because I have that mentality, deep down, that if I&#39;m good I can <br/>

*********************************************<br/>
<br/>
I had posted a while back that our local &quot;school-at-home Daddy-knows-best&quot;<br/>
support group asked me to speak about unschooling on a panel of various<br/>
types of homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I was a little concerned.  Normally, I would have just stood up and spoken<br/>
without any forethought....but this time I even made an outline.  I was<br/>
concerned about talking about why I don&#39;t use curriculum without offending<br/>
people who do, yet also keeping the door open.<br/>
<br/>
At question and answer time, no one asked me a question at all.  After the<br/>
meeting, 2 people met me in the hall.  I felt like the French Resistance but<br/>
it was nice to know that some people at least heard what I was trying to<br/>
say.<br/>

It&#39;s interesting, sometimes, that a presentation can seem to fall flat, but <br/>

Oh yes.  Lots of questions (mainly about the terrible TV addiction that<br/>
appears to be epidemic among these people&#39;s children &lt;grin&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Several people emailed me today to thank me for the talk, saying they<br/>
enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
When I got to the meeting, I heard someone behind me whispering &quot;Oh look,<br/>
she&#39;s the unschooler.&quot;  I turned around and it was a teenaged boy who was in<br/>
the unschooled Shakespeare production me and some kids did last year.  I<br/>
laughed, he laughed (He would love to unschool but his mom just can&#39;t get<br/>
there)...He assured me I was going to have my head handed to me....but it<br/>
was all quite nice actually.<br/>

Why not use the words of the &quot;experts&quot;?  I have a unschooling info <br/>
distribution list of some local friends that I periodically e-mail <br/>
the really good stuff to from this list, AlwaysLearning and <br/>
unschooling.com message boards. When I get the chance to chat with <br/>
someone who I think would be open to a more enlightened &lt;g&gt; way, I <br/>
ask if they would like me to add them to my list.  <br/>
<br/>
This happened just last Friday. A mom and I were talking about math <br/>
stuff and I asked if she wanted to hear more. I sent her this from <br/>
Sandra:<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The difference between a child figuring out math, odd statistics,  <br/>
and patterns on their own as opposed to someone droning on about them <br/>
is the difference between a live butterfly in and out of flowers in <br/>
your yard, going on to who knows where, doing exactly what he was <br/>
born to do, and a dead butterfly pinned on a piece of cardboard. <br/>
Don&#39;t kill math to capture it. You end up capturing boredom and <br/>
frustration and aversion.<br/>
