<div id="ygrps-yiv-681946779">I know this sounds dumb but im going to ask anyway...<br/>
Does anyone have vanity plates on their cars?<br/>
I will be reregistering my car at the end of this month and I want a good <br/>
plate.<br/>
I can use 7 letters or numbers (6 if I go with a vet plate).<br/>
 <br/>
Anyone have any &quot;Unschooling&quot; plate suggestions? I don&#39;t want to put HMSL3kiz <br/>
or anything that says just Homeschooling I want a cool unschooling plate. <br/>
Unlike my email that I need to change cuz it too School-at-Home sounding<br/>
 <br/>
I know this may sound totally stupid but I am choosing to do this over a <br/>
sticker I think.... Who knows I may find the right sticker and slap it on. I <br/>
scream from the roof tops when I can but this I think would be pretty cool to have <br/>
on there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have UNSKULN   but next time I&#39;ll probably get  UNSKOOL.  I use a blue <br/>
marker to make a long mark over the U---so they know we&#39;re not into boats! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But then I have all the stickers too. &lt;G&gt; There&#39;s not a day in a week that <br/>
we&#39;re out and about that someone doesn&#39;t ask me about it. We were parked at a <br/>
movie last month and found a business card on the windshield that said &quot;John <br/>
Holt rocks! Please call so we can discuss unschooling! WOW!&quot;. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re coming to the conference! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Wow , thats awesome! <br/>
I try to show people there is another way,so get it some dont.<br/>
I ahve a friend who is going to Homeschool I ahve promoted Unschooling when I <br/>
could . She called me today and told me she bought the abeka curicculam for <br/>
next year. That way if it doesnt work out her kids can go back to private <br/>
school and wont be behind the following year. UGH!!!!  I wanted to say well you <br/>
probally will cuz it isnt going to work! RRRRRR I didnt.....I want to make sure <br/>
she knows mine says Unschooling!<br/>
 <br/>
Hubby tells me if I want the new Lobster plate or Vet it has to be six so <br/>
somehow I have to make this plate sound like it says. That&#39;s all I can think of <br/>
is Unscol,Unskol but I don&#39;t want to promote that can&#39;t spell comment I keep <br/>
hearing about the JC Penny shirts.<br/>

That&#39;s so cool!  I&#39;m thinking maybe you also need a *sash* (like Miss<br/>
America) that says &quot;Ask me about the unschooling conference.&quot; &lt;bweg&gt;  It<br/>
sure would be attention getting.<br/>

I think I must have &quot;seen&quot; it, at least subliminally. &lt;g&gt;  Nothing else<br/>
would explain the sash notion. <br/>
