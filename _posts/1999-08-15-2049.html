<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135043141"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; LOL, Peter!!!  Are you new to this list?  I&#39;m kinda new so maybe I just <br/>
&gt; missed you....have you always been home or unschooled?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    I&#39;m new to the list as of about a month ago. I only reply every now and<br/>
then. Sometimes I don&#39;t even find the time to read the list, so my<br/>
interaction is spotty.<br/>
<br/>
I unschooled until college. Three Years later, I&#39;m back to unschooling<br/>
(through college, that is).<br/>
