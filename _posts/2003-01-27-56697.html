&gt; Ah ha! Finally someone who, like me, eats in front of the computer, often<br/>
&gt; while reading here!<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been known to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner while reading at the<br/>
&gt; computer depending on if I&#39;m eating alone and if my dh is home, in which<br/>
&gt; case I defnitely eat with him.<br/>
&gt; Anyone else do this?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I always eat breakfast while reading emails, sometimes lunch too. Which is why my keyboard is so icky. I figure that the kids don&#39;t bug me while I&#39;m eating so instead of neglecting them after meals<br/>
while I read email and can neglect them doubly by eating and reading emails.<br/>
Right now is snack time. I&#39;ve just done 10 miles on the exercise bike so I&#39;m snacking on bread sticks n humus. Gotta make up them calories I just lost!!!<br/>

thru meals if I&#39;m going to be available to Liam other times.  So, here I <br/>
sit scarfing down my meals.  I&#39;m glad that other folks do it too.<br/>
