SO, what  was the dumbest thing you think you had to learn in school? <br/>
For me, I  think it was the whole how to diagram all of the parts of <br/>
speech in a  sentence. I was really good at it, but I still don&#39;t know <br/>
what purpose it  served to be able to put things on a weird little <br/>
line.  LOL&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve never diagramed a sentence. My brother (two years behind me) did. I  <br/>
guess they called that the &quot;New English&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
