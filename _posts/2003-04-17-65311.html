<br/>
Anyone have experience with a kid wanting to change their name? I can <br/>
remember wanting to be Angie at about age 12, which bugged the crud out of my <br/>
mom, but Angie I was until I graduated. Every once in a awhile I still here <br/>
her refer to me to someone else as Angie, it sounds so bizarre. I don&#39;t like <br/>
Angie so much, and I don&#39;t dislike Angela as much as I used to.<br/>
<br/>
My almost 11yo has had a few times where she wanted to be something other <br/>
than Megan. Her name is Megan Elizabeth. For awhile she kidded that we could <br/>
called her Emmy like her initials, M-E. It was brought up again that she <br/>
likes the name Joyce, which is my sisters legal name, but always went by her <br/>
middle name.  Now she says most seriously, that she hates Megan, and when she <br/>
grows up she will be known as Lizzie or Liz. I said why not now?  She totally <br/>
blew me off LOL. She loves Lizzie McGuire so that probably has something to <br/>
do with it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-845833677">I don&#39;t know that I have much to offer here, but my daughter Haleigh has <br/>
been complaining about her name lately.  She wants to be Erin.  I like that, <br/>
too!  I have read several places that pre-teens often go through a name <br/>
hating period.  It is actually quite healthy as they are exerting their <br/>
independance and finding their &#39;selves&#39;.  I&#39;ve also heard this goes away <br/>
once they establish within themselves who they are.  I can already see <br/>
Haleigh&#39;s interest, or lack there of &gt;g&lt;, in her name fading.  The rebellion <br/>
stage is fading out more and more everyday and the more confident she is, <br/>
the less I hear about it.  Kids just need to establish boundries and their <br/>
names are an easy target, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
I say call your kids SpongeBob if that&#39;s what they want.  Why not??  I&#39;ve <br/>
always hated my name, although I&#39;m pretty sure of who I am. :)  It would <br/>
help a LOT if there weren&#39;t 5 million Jennifer&#39;s everywhere I went.  I never <br/>
ONCE had a class where I was the only one.  No kidding!  And that&#39;s a LOT of <br/>
classes!!!<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer, who happliy now goes by Momma, Mom, Mommy and occasionaly, GO TELL <br/>
YOUR MOTHER!?!  I have lots of choices!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297096291">I changed my name.  I never felt that Ruth was me.  I not only didn&#39;t<br/>
like it, it just didn&#39;t seem to suit me.  When I was about 9 my cousin<br/>
started calling me Ruru, and it quickly got shortened to Rue.  Soon<br/>
everyone but my parents called me Rue.   I had it legally changed as an<br/>
adult.  My parents were not thrilled, but do make an effort to remember<br/>
to call me Rue.  It doesn&#39;t bother me when they call me Ruthie, but I<br/>
can&#39;t stand if anyone else does.  If someone calls out &quot;Hey, Ruth&quot; I<br/>
don&#39;t hear it any more than I would if someone said, &quot;Hey, Heather&quot;.  <br/>
 <br/>
I say help her find a name that feels right, and call her whatever she<br/>
wants to be called.  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-148581034">My daughter&#39;s full name is Sarah Irene Jeanette. With<br/>
Sarah being a common name, she asks every now and<br/>
again to be called &quot;Jeannie&quot; but she&#39;s not very<br/>
forceful about it (at 7). <br/>
<br/>
I remember wanting to change my name for SO long, I<br/>
never liked being called Beth. Hated Elizabeth, which<br/>
is my given name. I felt it was too old fashioned and<br/>
boring and just NOT me. <br/>
<br/>
When I went to boot camp, I was simply known by my<br/>
last name; when I met my husband at my first unit I<br/>
introduced myself as Elizabeth and that&#39;s all he&#39;s<br/>
ever called me. It seems to fit now. It seems weird<br/>
when my family calls me Beth. <br/>
<br/>
Although...when we nearly got divorced three years<br/>
ago, I started putting everything into my middle name<br/>
of Lynne because I just couldn&#39;t bear to hear myself<br/>
called Elizabeth anymore..it being my husband&#39;s name<br/>
for me and Beth my childhood name. But we stayed<br/>
together thankfully, so I&#39;m still Elizabeth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131992356">Well, I&#39;m back LOL!! <br/>
<br/>
Had some health concerns but thankfully I&#39;m alright<br/>
now although I&#39;m expecting to end up on bedrest later<br/>
on during the pregnancy because while the placenta is<br/>
no longer previa, it is still anterior and extremely<br/>
low, and they think it&#39;s stuck on scar tissue from<br/>
previous Csections. The thyroid cancer is thankfully<br/>
benign and they&#39;ll just put me on meds after Baby is<br/>
born.<br/>
<br/>
ANYWAY...because of these health concerns I&#39;ve not<br/>
been able to do ANYTHING but let Sarah handle things<br/>
on her own educationally and it hasn&#39;t been too bad.<br/>
She&#39;s still wanting to be read to from the Sonlight<br/>
books, but hey, she&#39;s choosing it. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ll<br/>
ever completely feel comfortable with not saying<br/>
&quot;let&#39;s do some math today&quot; or whatever, but it&#39;s<br/>
getting easier to see where she is doing something<br/>
educational within her day and I&#39;m keeping a Blog to<br/>
help keep track as well. Sarah&#39;s even reading aloud<br/>
more to me now that I&#39;m not saying anything about it.<br/>
She&#39;ll pick up and book and say &quot;Let me read this to<br/>
you!&quot; rather than &quot;Do I HAVE to read today?!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;ve been gone, Sarah&#39;s taught Logan to sing his<br/>
ABCs and identify the letters of his name. He says<br/>
they are &quot;Lellow-gee-in&quot; instead of L-o-g-a-n. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve decided to not continue Sarah&#39;s IEP next year<br/>
since she&#39;s not really getting the help she needs<br/>
anyway. <br/>

My Mother out foxed me on this one when I went through that<br/>
phase. For lack of anyone named my mothers first choice, I won&#39;t<br/>
mention it here.<br/>
Along with the many versions of Mom, I also supposed to come<br/>
or answer to a certain whistle when my son is searching for me.<br/>
For awhile I was supposed to answer to &quot;DUDE&quot;.<br/>
That didn&#39;t work for my ps teenage son.<br/>
Have you ever been in a store and heard a child call &quot;MOM&quot;<br/>
and lots of women turn towards the child? LOL its embeded in<br/>
our brains! Linda is nice to hear now, as little as I get to hear it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-208601608">Hi,<br/>
My son changed his name when he turned 18.<br/>
That was 11 years ago. I call him by his chosen name.<br/>
<br/>
He also changed his last name. His bio-dad (my ex-husband) had to be dragged into court and almost jailed to pay child support ( his business was worth millions and it was in his mothers name) He paid very little, his second wife didn&#39;t like my kids, so my ex saw my kids very infrequently ( 3 times in ten years).<br/>
My moms family name is very, very old. It goes back to the 12th century. There were no more  men to carry on the name.  ( None of my grandmothers - VaVau- sons married) My son changed his name from Joseph Bogle.<br/>
He became Jean-Luc Calouro.<br/>
<br/>
I love it.<br/>
Janis who is known as Jana by many, many people<br/>
also coyote or coyote woman<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This discussion prompted me to ask my children how they felt about their <br/>
names.  They are all pretty common names and while they weren&#39;t chosen <br/>
because they were popular at the time, they were and there are usually more <br/>
than one of them in each class.<br/>
<br/>
One year they assigned rec softball by alphabetical order by some computer <br/>
fluke and Sarah&#39;s team had six Sarah&#39;s, so everyone got called by first and <br/>
middle or first and last initial.  Was funny but confusing.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it&#39;s a consensus around here, they all love their names and wouldn&#39;t <br/>
change them.  Sarah says she thinks it&#39;s because of the wonderful stories <br/>
that I always told them about what their names mean and how we put such care <br/>
into choosing them, her name seemed like a special gift to her.  Well, wonder <br/>
if she would have felt the same way if we had named her something like, <br/>
Myrtle or Gertrude, which are fine names but not very common these days?<br/>
<br/>
So guess we are keeping Sarah Melissa, Matthew Wayne, John Woodrow Ellis, <br/>
Caitlin Elizabeth, and Jackson Thomas or variations of those names anyway.<br/>
<br/>
As with any good southern child they know that if their full name is being <br/>
used, then it&#39;s probably not something good!  (they liked to remind me of <br/>

<br/>
My kids answer to first, middle, or a combination of their names.  Cait was <br/>
Caity Beth for years and years, then just Caity and now she wants to be <br/>
called CAIT.  I guess she thinks it&#39;s more grown up.<br/>
<br/>
I think I am the only one in Matthew&#39;s life that calls him Matthew, to <br/>
everyone else it&#39;s Matt.<br/>
<br/>
John is John except I&#39;ve always called him Wood, so he answers to that from <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Sarah is Sarah or Melissa, almost evenly divided.  Got confusing when she had <br/>
a roommate named Melissa.  Her roommate would say &quot;your Mom called but I&#39;m <br/>
not sure which one of us the message is for&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Jackson is just Jack and always will be.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to whoever started this thread, it was a fun discussion with my <br/>
children about their names and what they like and even what they might name <br/>
their own children!<br/>

Janis who is known as Jana by many, many people<br/>
also coyote or coyote woman&gt;&gt;I think this is the fun part that may take some of the rebellion stage of the name game &lt;g&gt; a lot of kids so. They have each picked out a magickal name for themselves.My husband and I {Jonathan and Tracy } heard our names so much, we knew we wanted to have pretty unique names for our kids. But if they ever decide to change it for another name. That&#39;s cool too.For now my oldest two say they like their names.Tracy<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;Anyone have experience with a kid wanting to change their name?&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Actually, yes!  We called ds *Will* (from William) since birth, but after <br/>
quitting school in the 8th grade, he popped up and informed us that he wanted <br/>
to be called *Liam*, a Gaelic nickname for William.  What a cool name, we <br/>
thought, and what a great independence moment for him.  I don&#39;t think that it <br/>
was a coincidence that he came up with the idea right after leaving school <br/>
and embarking on the unschooling path.  It all felt like whole cloth to me.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t difficult, really, for us to get used to, mainly because it was <br/>
important to him and we respected his wishes enormously.  Also, years before, <br/>
dh had changed what we called him -- from *Don* to *Gib*, so I had a little <br/>
experience with the idea.<br/>
<br/>
I remember wanting to be called *Leigh* when I was in high school.  I thought <br/>
that Laura was a pretty boring name.  My middle name was Lee, and I wanted to <br/>
do an unusual variation on it, but no one would listen to me or respect my <br/>
wishes.  I was completely discounted and treated as if my idea was silly.  It <br/>
made me feel pretty small and insignificant.  I certainly didn&#39;t want to make <br/>
my ds feel the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Self-identification, -awareness, and -esteem are all so tightly interwoven.  <br/>
I think that *owning* one&#39;s own name fully might be a pretty important thing <br/>
to do.<br/>

always will call him Jack.  I always say Jackson because to me Jack sounds <br/>
juvenile.  And that is how I have always known him.  But to his family it is <br/>
Jack and Uncle Jack.  LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-26624851">My kids have both gone in and out of phases where they either pretend to be<br/>
someone else, or change their name. My daughter has been &quot;Carmen&quot; for a week<br/>
or two. She went through a fairly long period of time where she would only<br/>
be called &quot;Frodo Baggins&quot; and she wore a ring on a chain around her neck,<br/>
LOL! My son went through a similar thing where for several months he would<br/>
only be called &quot;Casey Jones&quot; and only wore engineer overalls, cap, and red<br/>
bandana. I think this falls more into imaginative play at that age though.<br/>
Recently, my son asked if he could change his name and I explained about<br/>
legally changing it and that since it&#39;s a fairly complicated process, it<br/>
would be worthwhile to try out any name that he wanted to use for awhile<br/>
first before discussing changing it legally. He thought about it for awhile<br/>
and tried out a couple of names, but ultimately liked his own name better.<br/>
Since DH goes by his middle name and not his first name, he knows that you<br/>
can be called one thing by some people and one by another. There was a<br/>
period of several years through high school and college where I went by a<br/>
different name as well, though I didn&#39;t legally change my name. In the area<br/>
where we live, it&#39;s fairly common for people to legally change their names.<br/>
We know people named &quot;Tree&quot;, &quot;Raven&quot;, and &quot;Sequoia&quot; who most likely chose<br/>
these names in adulthood (though I haven&#39;t asked them). There are kids in<br/>
our homeschooling group who go by other names that they&#39;ve chosen.<br/>
As far as what my kids call me, they sometimes use my first name, which is<br/>
fine by me. I don&#39;t stand on formality though it can freak the grandparents<br/>
out who are a bit more traditional. The kids usually call me &quot;mom&quot; or<br/>
&quot;momma&quot; though. Last week they thought it was hysterical to refer to me as<br/>
&quot;Mrs. M-O-M&quot;. I don&#39;t know where they got that one!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-214378002">I changed my name.  I hated my given name and when I went to college simply<br/>
stopped using it.  I FINALLY got around to legally changing it about 1.5<br/>
years ago.<br/>
<br/>
I purposly have chosen fairly simple, common names for my sons.  Names with<br/>
common nicknames that I can stand.  James Nicolas and Benjamin Ian.  Oh, and<br/>
little no name boy due in August.  I figure there is some variant of those<br/>
names they will like at any given time.  If not, well, I&#39;ve been there, done<br/>
that, I&#39;ll call &#39;em whatever they want.<br/>
