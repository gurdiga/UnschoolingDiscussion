<div id="ygrps-yiv-16237001">Sorry for any blank posts that come through.  I really need a new mouse, my <br/>
mouse has TIAs that will develop into a stroke at any minute.<br/>
<br/>
I had a question about what my children can say when people ask this question <br/>
&quot;what grade are you in?&quot;.  It has never been a problem until now.  This past <br/>
week they have been asked at least 4 times by well meaning adults.  My oldest <br/>
(8yo) says I don&#39;t know... we homeschool.  But this last time I think he was <br/>
getting a little frustrated, he said &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; then turned to me and <br/>
asked &quot;what grade am I in Mom&quot; I said &quot;oh probably around 3rd or 4th <br/>
somewhere.&quot;  Took me off guard a little.  What is a good response for him to <br/>
use?  I am comfortable sitting with them talking to them about grades, PS, <br/>
adult expectations etc etc.  But what can they say?<br/>
<br/>
My boys are pretty good about standing up for themselves, that isn&#39;t a <br/>
problem.  They both have long blond hair and are often mistaken for girls.  <br/>
They just say &quot;we are boys&quot; and if someone actually questions it they say &quot;I <br/>
think we know if we are boys or not.&quot;  Maybe we should talk more about the <br/>
concept of unschooling, information can be the best ammunition sometimes.  I <br/>
guess it is just a way of life and we have never sat down and talked about <br/>
the ideas behind unschooling.<br/>

 Sometimes they look at me like we are nuts but oh well.  <br/>
<br/>
They could just tell the adult well if I was in public school I would be in <br/>
3rd grade, but I have the freedom to learn all kinds of things and I&#39;m not <br/>
restricted by grade. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I usually answer &quot;We don&#39;t do grades&quot; if someone asks me. If they push it, <br/>
I usually just say &quot;Well, he&#39;s 5 so I guess he&#39;d be in K if he went to ps.&quot;<br/>
  I&#39;d like to discuss ways to get more distance from making comparisons to <br/>
what the public schools are doing. This year, all my son&#39;s little buddies <br/>
went off to K and I hear from their moms about what the kids are doing at <br/>
school. I know that we have much more freedom and fun, but I&#39;d like help in <br/>
getting rid of the mental checklist where I&#39;m thinking, &quot;Yep, he does that, <br/>
and that, but not that....&quot; Will this possibly come with time?<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t discourage the &quot;We don&#39;t go to schoo&quot; answer, because it won&#39;t <br/>
hurt those who are inquiring to CONSIDER that if a child isn&#39;t in school he&#39;s <br/>
not &quot;in a grade.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So many homeschoolers who do a curriculum, though, and if their kids are <br/>
&quot;ahead&quot; they brag it up.  So we can&#39;t say &quot;homeschoolers don&#39;t do grades,&quot; <br/>
but we can say (my kids do) &quot;We don&#39;t do grades.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
My kids state their age, if a person asks what grade.  They say &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
thirteen, but I don&#39;t go to school.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-224534209">Technically she is listed as 3 or 4th grade...don&#39;t  really know which..<br/>
but I tell her when she asks or when someone is really curious, that she<br/>
does work at the level of 1-6th grade....<br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t get it.<br/>
We had a schooled child here playing...met her via penpalling actually! And<br/>
she came up to my daughter and asked her: What is 7x5? Esther doesn&#39;t know<br/>
tables, addition, multiplication..she knows some facts but hasn&#39;t anything<br/>
memorized.  I told the child twice, that isn&#39;t how we do math here, and I<br/>
think I had her flummoxed.  How else does one do math? I could hear her<br/>
thinking....<br/>
