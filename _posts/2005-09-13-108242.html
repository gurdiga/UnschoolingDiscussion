<div id="ygrps-yiv-281003453">He got up!  And had quite a bit to say on the subject, as you can see below.<br/>
I transcribed what he was saying, so any errors are my own etc.<br/>

Good to see some new people getting into the game.  DnD is an interesting<br/>
game and can certainly broaden your understanding of a variety of subjects,<br/>
but it can also be difficult to get into.<br/>
<br/>
DnD basic game is a good way to get started.  You&#39;ll need at least three<br/>
people, preferably five, to play a successful game.  This is because you<br/>
need at least one dungeon master to run the world and if you only have one<br/>
additional player this can cause problems with game balance and enjoyment.<br/>
As for what books to get hold of, I would recommend sticking with the basic<br/>
game until you&#39;ve run at least two successful sessions with at least three<br/>
people.  Once you&#39;ve done that, you should start branching off into the<br/>
three core rule books of the the 3.5 edition.<br/>
<br/>
The Players Handbook provides you with all the info you need to create new<br/>
chars level them all the way up to 20.  It also has all of the combat rules<br/>
and spells.  What it lacks is any info on DMing and creating encounters and<br/>
treasure for your players, if you are the DM.<br/>
<br/>
The Monsters Manual contains 100&#39;s of monsters as well as rules for creating<br/>
your own monsters and a glossary of their special abilities.  Very handy<br/>
when running encounters, but useless by itself when creating a campaign.<br/>
<br/>
The Dungeon Masters Guide contains dozens of pages of advice on how to run a<br/>
successful campaign as well as all of the rules to creating balanced<br/>
encounters.  Magic items, balanced treasure and info on how to create your<br/>
own campaign world.<br/>
<br/>
In short, if you&#39;re really serious about getting into DnD, you&#39;ll need at<br/>
least these three books.  The non-book accessories you&#39;ll need include<br/>
pencils (I find mechanical pencils are best), as well as plenty of scratch<br/>
paper and character sheets, which you can download from the Wizards of the<br/>
Coast site, or photocopy from the players handbook.<br/>
<br/>
From there you have three options for resolving combat, you can use graph<br/>
paper, maps and miniatures or your imagination.  Graph paper is a cheap and<br/>
flexible solution but leaves something to be desired as far aesthetics goes.<br/>
Miniatures and maps provide clarity where the rules are concerned are<br/>
pleasing visually, but are highly expensive and somewhat limited.  Finally,<br/>
your imagination is perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing  and is<br/>
definitely the cheapest, but can result in confusion while resolving combat.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also worth mentioning that there is a line of role playing books using<br/>
the d20 system, created specifically for Warcraft.  I haven&#39;t used them<br/>
myself, but they seem to be of high quality.  Keep in mind that they were<br/>
created before the WoW online game, so there are some discrepancies there.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
