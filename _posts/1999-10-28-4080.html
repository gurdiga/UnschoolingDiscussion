<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970155368">Mattie,<br/>
     Just wanted to let you know that I received your &quot;gift&quot;.  I wanted to <br/>
e-mail you privately, but I have lost your e-mail addy.  My husband and I <br/>
couldn&#39;t believe that you sent payment and a gift!  It didn&#39;t cost much at <br/>
all to send you those game instructions, so payment was unnecessary.  We were <br/>
glad to do it!!  <br/>
      Your thanks was already enough to warm my heart, so I cannot tell you <br/>
how much your gift meant to me.  I am sometimes overwhelmed by the loving <br/>
gestures of people in this world (that is usually so uncaring and sometimes <br/>
cruel.)  You have made me realise that there are still alot of wonderful <br/>
people out there.  Thank you so much for taking the extra time, effort and <br/>
money to send your token of appreciation to me.  It is now my turn to show <br/>
you some appreciation, so I just wanted to say a very deep and heartfelt Thank<br/>
 you!<br/>
