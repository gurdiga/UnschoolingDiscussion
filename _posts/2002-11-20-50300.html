<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313237915">&lt;&lt;but actually lack of effective strewing and communication&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just using your quote as a jumping off point, Patti.  I would not expect any<br/>
unschooler to jump into school and be &quot;on grade level&quot;.  They will be above<br/>
in some things and behind in others.  It is normal development.  It is<br/>
abnormal to expect people to be on the same level in many areas.  And it is<br/>
important to remember that the school is only measuring things that kids are<br/>
&quot;supposed&quot; to learn at that level, not all areas of knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
My ds is 9.  He loves math concepts but would be way, way &quot;behind&quot; if he<br/>
went into a 4th grade classroom.  Zach likes to play around in his head with<br/>
numeric patterns but if you asked him to do a multiplication problem, it<br/>
would blow his mind.  Now he solves &quot;multiplication problems&quot; everyday (he<br/>
likes to use counting by 2&#39;s, or 5&#39;s or whatever to do it) but I don&#39;t think<br/>
he would even recognize a multiplication problem written out.  Mainly<br/>
because you usually don&#39;t see multiplication problems written out in real<br/>
life unless you write it out yourself while trying to solve a problem.<br/>
Zach&#39;s world doesn&#39;t yet involve such large numbers that he can&#39;t solve it<br/>
in his head.  However, if they wanted to talk physics to Zach he would blow<br/>
them out of the water,.....but 4th graders aren&#39;t allowed to learn that yet<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Zach doesn&#39;t read very well, in fact hardly at all.  I have strewn about as<br/>
much as I can strew along those lines.  I read to him as often as he would<br/>
like.  I have read every Harry Potter and Hank the Cowdog outloud until my<br/>
throat hurt.  We have magnetic letters on the fridge that various kids play<br/>
with and we fiddle with it as we want.  We play Scrabble Jr., etc..  Zach<br/>
likes the weather so I showed him how to find the weather in the newspaper.<br/>
He still doesn&#39;t read very well.  It doesn&#39;t particularly interest him yet<br/>
and he simply isn&#39;t ready.  If he went to school, he would be labeled an<br/>
&quot;unschooling failure&quot; because he would be way behind.  But ask Zach about<br/>
genetics, animal husbandry, sex, etc. and he would be a &quot;prodigy&quot; but 4th<br/>
graders aren&#39;t supposed to learn that yet.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Schools only have round holes and the measure of success is how well you fit<br/>
into that hole.  Unschoolers come in all shapes and sizes and have a<br/>
tendency to carve out their own holes that fit just right.<br/>
