<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405386052"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Yay! that&#39;s just what I&#39;m looking for!<br/>
&gt; And having been on this list now for less than 24 hours (wow, there&#39;s a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lot of mail!!), I have to say I feel really excited and confident that being<br/>
here will help meet my needs for companionship, support, challenge, growth,<br/>
humour, and acceptance.<br/>
<br/>
As others have said, it&#39;s not usually this busy.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you do intros here? Here&#39;s mine: I&#39;m ingrid (40), live with my French<br/>
 </span></blockquote>partner (44) and three children (ds 17yo, ds 5.5yo and dd 17 months) on an<br/>
island in British Columbia, Canada. WE are a trilingual/multicultural family<br/>
(French, German, English). My younger son was just offically registered this<br/>
year for the first time as a &quot;homeschooler&quot; --i&#39;m grateful for the freedom<br/>
in this province which means no testing, evalutions or interference<br/>
whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
So welcome Ingrid (on Saltspring still?) from Tia in Sooke.  &lt;g&gt;  I think we<br/>
spoke on the phone once when I was still the subscription person for the<br/>
Victoria newsletter.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Though I find myself having less and less to write these days too,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>language and writing are my medium. I work at home as a freelance writer and<br/>
have written and self-published a book on Natural Infant Hygiene (or<br/>
Elimination Communication--both phrases I coined to refer to an age-old<br/>
concept) about tuning in to and meeting an infant&#39;s elimination needs<br/>
without relying on diapers. (I have a website at www.natural-wisdom.com )<br/>
<br/>
Hey!  My daughter is doing this with her youngest.  She isn&#39;t catching all<br/>
of them, but she&#39;s keeping him much drier with fewer diapers than the<br/>
others.  She&#39;s starting to recognize his signals.<br/>

Oh yeah? Hasn&#39;t slowed down yet! :-)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;So welcome Ingrid (on Saltspring still?) from Tia in Sooke.  &lt;g&gt;  I think we<br/>

<br/>
Yes we did :-). I&#39;ve been thinking about checking in with the victoria crowd some day again. I edit the Saltspring homelearners newsletter now...<br/>

Wow, that is so cool! I love just &quot;bumping&quot; into people who are practicing natural infant hygiene. And i&#39;m amazed at the quick grass-roots way it is growing. Did she learn about it from my book?<br/>
<br/>
Are you still involved in victoria? still have children at home?<br/>

<br/>
I just took over as editor of the Victoria newsletter.  &lt;g&gt;  We don&#39;t do<br/>
many activities as my son decided somewhere along the way that homeschoolers<br/>
are &quot;dumb&quot;.  There are none his age out here (at least that he can relate to<br/>
at all) and most of his friends are his sports buddies.  He *is* taking a<br/>
film course for homelearners.  There&#39;s a boy from Mayne Island in his class.<br/>
Do you know Adam Iredale Gray?<br/>

I&#39;m not sure where she learned about it, probably on one of her unassisted<br/>
birth lists, but she&#39;s using your book.  She&#39;s also on a list that I think<br/>
she said you were on.  Her name is Heather and has Skye, Kaelin, and Sasha.<br/>

Cheers,<br/>
