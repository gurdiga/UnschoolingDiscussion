I had to respond to this one... what a delightful answer!! And one <br/>
that will go into the arsenal ;-&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Intro:<br/>
I&#39;ve been on the list for a bit now, but mostly unable to read the <br/>
postings (been busy). I&#39;ve been hsing since 1995, but have been <br/>
unschooling my children since birth. My dh is supportive, but <br/>
constantly worries me about what they know, and college, etc. I&#39;ve <br/>
explained to him my position: It is more important to me that my <br/>
children be HUMAN, ie be able to empathize with others, treat others <br/>
with respect and dignity, and generally deal with others in a <br/>
positive, uplifting fashion, than it is for them to know the times <br/>
tables, or the atomic weight of plutonium, or the exact date that the <br/>
Constitution was ratified. In my opinion, these things can all be <br/>
looked up (unless you&#39;re answering the questions as a contestant on <br/>
Jeopardy &lt;g&gt;); and anyway, how many people do we know of who remembers <br/>
most of that stuff that we were force fed as children *anyway*?!?<br/>
<br/>
I digress. We live in a small town, and everyone knows me as the &#39;lady <br/>
who homeschools her kids&#39;, so my children are constantly scrutinized, <br/>
it seems. But people generally comment that they are very smart, what <br/>
am I doing to make them that way? &lt;lol&gt; *I* didn&#39;t *make* them smart, <br/>
they *are* smart!! <br/>
<br/>
It is so great to be around other people who actually think about why <br/>
they are doing things, and if something is not working, to ditch it. <br/>
Most people that I know of won&#39;t do that, even if it causes them pain. <br/>
My hats off to you! <br/>
