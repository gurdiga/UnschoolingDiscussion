<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130235292">Hello!<br/>
    I&#39;m new to the list and have been enjoying the information you all<br/>
have been sharing. Thanks!<br/>
I have 3 sons - 10 and  7 years old  and 18 months. I was wondering if<br/>
anyone had suggestions of books they found that their sons enjoyed. My<br/>
boys are really into adventure stories, and anything that makes them<br/>
laugh. I&#39;m looking for read together books and &quot;read by themselves&quot;<br/>
books (2nd grade level). Also my oldest son is really interested in wars<br/>
and battles. In fact this leads to another question- does the war thing<br/>
ever cease or should I be getting prepared for the day he&#39;ll tell me he<br/>
is enlisting? He tells me he is not interested in being in the army , he<br/>
just wants to produce a movie about a war. Which brings me to my last<br/>
question- does anyone have any ideas of how I can expose him to movie<br/>
productions and such. I plan to do home videos of his &quot;movies&quot; but I<br/>
don&#39;t know how to expose him to professional settings. Anyway, I<br/>
appreciate any thoughts on the above questions.<br/>

  <div><tt><font face="Pooh" size="4">I don&#39;t know about boys much as I have 
  daughters. However I do know this...they would enjoy the Hardy Boys mystery 
  books. I still do and I&#39;m a female! I also enjoyed the Bobbsey Twins mysteries 
  and am enjoying the Boxcar children series. As to Wars, let him read stories 
  on old wars such as the crimean wars, civil wars and even the most recent 
  ones. He will get an idea of what war really is like and how devastating it 
  can be. As to producing a movie, Have him do a pictorial panel and make a home 
  movie out of that with a camcorder...maybe do a skit or a home theatre type 
  thing.</font></tt></div>

<br/>
My daughter enjoys the Zack Files series and they seem to be a boy&#39;s kind of <br/>
book as well.  The combine humor, silliness and a bit of history, science, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416931016">my 8 yo loves the hardy boys books.  He is devouring them.  He has no<br/>
interest in reading the most modernized ones and prefers the ones from the<br/>
50s and 60s, but he was finally prompted to learn how to use the library<br/>
catalog to search out some of the original ones form the 30&#39;s.  We found<br/>
on elibrary with circulating holdings of a few of the originals.  He plans<br/>
to read the &quot;updated&quot; version first (from the 60&#39;s) and then read the<br/>
original.  He also has a list of books to look for at garage sales and<br/>
flea markets.  Hardy Boys really sparked his desire to read and research.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In this house, &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; has gone over bigger than I would&#39;ve<br/>
imagined.  My kids get a real kick out of the slang language of the day,<br/>
especially when read with an appropriate accent! <br/>
Also, the Laura Ingalls Wilder book &quot;Farmer Boy&quot;, about her husband&#39;s<br/>
pioneer childhood made an unbelievable impression.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess the best bet might be to try contacting a local production house<br/>
(look in the yellow pages) and introducing yourself as a homeschooler<br/>
looking for a stimulating field trip or learning opportunity.  If you<br/>
can&#39;t find one or don&#39;t know how to look try contacting your local TV<br/>
broadcast station.  They may be willing to help in a similar way, even<br/>
if it&#39;s just shooting advertising for local businesses, it&#39;s a start. <br/>
The library or newspaper or local technical school/college that offers<br/>
arts programs could be a good contact.<br/>
One last thought might be to join a talent agency, even as a &quot;movie<br/>
extra&quot;.  That will get you onto a set if nothing else does!  Good luck!</div>

&gt;   ever cease or should I be getting prepared for the<br/>

&gt;   just wants to produce a movie about a war. Which<br/>
&gt; brings me to my last<br/>
&gt;   question- does anyone have any ideas of how I can<br/>
&gt; expose him to movie<br/>
&gt;   productions and such. I plan to do home videos of<br/>
&gt; his &quot;movies&quot; but I<br/>
&gt;   don&#39;t know how to expose him to professional<br/>
&gt; settings. Anyway, I<br/>
&gt;   appreciate any thoughts on the above questions.<br/>

&gt;   Karen,<br/>
&gt;   I don&#39;t know about boys much as I have daughters.<br/>
&gt; However I do know this...they would enjoy the Hardy<br/>
&gt; Boys mystery books. I still do and I&#39;m a female! I<br/>
&gt; also enjoyed the Bobbsey Twins mysteries and am<br/>
&gt; enjoying the Boxcar children series. As to Wars, let<br/>
&gt; him read stories on old wars such as the crimean<br/>
&gt; wars, civil wars and even the most recent ones. He<br/>
&gt; will get an idea of what war really is like and how<br/>
&gt; devastating it can be. As to producing a movie, Have<br/>
&gt; him do a pictorial panel and make a home movie out<br/>
&gt; of that with a camcorder...maybe do a skit or a home<br/>
&gt; theatre type thing.<br/>
