<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531632662"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Think of unschooling as letting your child&#39;s own life begin, in which the <br/>
&gt;&gt;child begins to take the reins and control his/her own learning.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love this little gem held within the concept of unschooling. Our children <br/>
are living their lives right now. They&#39;re not busy spending 12 years <br/>
preparing for their lives at 18 or 21. They get to be participating in the <br/>
real world RIGHT NOW. I believe that&#39;s very different from what society as a <br/>
whole believes about children.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Unschooling parents accept the truth that learning is happening all day, <br/>
&gt;&gt;every day. We accept that we cannot be aware, nor can even our children, <br/>
&gt;&gt;of what is entering their minds as &quot;learning&quot; and what is being filtered <br/>
&gt;&gt;away.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The same really holds true for schoolchildren as well. It&#39;s just that by <br/>
testing and tracking, the illusion of a &quot;guarantee of learning&quot; is <br/>
maintained for jittery parents.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;What we must do is trust that if we have provided them with tools and <br/>
&gt;&gt;access and the freedom to choose what interests them, we are doing the <br/>
&gt;&gt;best we can.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And maybe also the help and guidance to use some of those tools, when asked <br/>
for of course. ;-)<br/>
