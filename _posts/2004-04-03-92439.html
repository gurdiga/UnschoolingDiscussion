   We have three adopted children.  One was adopted at birth in an open, private adoption.  It is an amazing story because we bonded with my son&#39;s birth family and I spent 6 weeks with them in California before &quot;our&quot; baby was born.  It was expensive and complicated because we adopted across state lines, and very emotional because of all the stress they were under before the birth.  We have kept in contact with them over the years.  Our other kids were adopted through foster care. virtually without cost, but with a very high emotional price because of all the drama involved in foster care.  If you think I can help you by telling more of our story, I&#39;d be happy to.  On or off list would be fine with me.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

<br/>
It depends on the route you want to go.  There are many options....overseas,<br/>
private agency, open, with a mediator, directly with the birthparents, out<br/>
of the foster system, fostering to adopt....<br/>
<br/>
We have adopted with a private agency and through the foster system.  Some<br/>
cost many thousands, some were quite reasonable, one was free.  Email me if<br/>
you would like to chat.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-511951974">I suggest you do what I did, when I first started the adoption journey; go to the library, and get some books.  (I didn&#39;t have a home computer then) Next, type in adoption sources on a search engine in your computer.  You&#39;ll probably get a ton of web sites and advice.  As someone else said, private adoption is expensive; adoption through foster doesn&#39;t cost so much in money, but there is other &#39;stuff&#39; you have to deal with.  After you&#39;ve done a little searching, & reading about laws, which vary from state to state, you can begin to find adoption groups, and seek out folks who&#39;ve been through adoption.  Listen to everyone elses story, then tell them yours.  You will get an idea about what it&#39;s like to go through it, a general idea of cost, emotional and otherwise.<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; were they able to homeschool right away or did they have to go to<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it would depend on the situation and the social worker.  If the<br/>
child has already been in your home and adjusted to you, I would think the<br/>
social worker would usually agree to homeschooling when the adoption papers<br/>
were signed, prior to going before the judge to finalize the adoption.<br/>
<br/>
If the child was new to your home and everyone having to wait to see how the<br/>
adjustment was going, the social worker might want to delay homeschooling.<br/>
Her thinking being that if the placement falls through the child would<br/>
already be in school and easier to transfer.  Also, she could check with<br/>
teachers who would be additional eyes and ears on the child&#39;s adjustment.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; age sometime soon,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know the age of your son but I would think long and hard on this<br/>
one.  Every older child I have known adopted out of the foster care system,<br/>
particularly those active and slightly defiant ones you mentioned, take a<br/>
tremendous amount of patience and tolerance from the entire family.  Close<br/>
age placements tends to exaggerate the normal jealousies involved.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

  *********************************<br/>
<br/>
  My son was nine when he came to us as a foster son, and we adopted him six months later.  When he came to live with us, he really wanted to be homeschooled.  We talked to the social worker about it and she was enthusiastic.  However, it had to go through the courts before we were allowed to keep him home.  I had to write a letter stating what we wanted to do, and how his educational needs would be accomplished.  I held my breath a bit because &quot;school&quot; in this house would be unconventional, to say the least.  However, I must have had a judge who thought outside the box because our wishes were granted and we were able to keep our son home and unschool him.  I think these decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, and it might have helped us that we already had an older son who had been &quot;schooled&quot; at home since the beginning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-356135295">My husband and I are currently going through the foster care system <br/>
here in Florida to adopt a child.  We have been told that until the <br/>
adoption is finalized the child does have to go to school.  Once the <br/>
adoption is completed we can then homeschool.  Now where we are the <br/>
need is so great that th whole process from start to finish in about <br/>
3 to 5 months.  So you may want to check with your area to see what <br/>
the length of time is.<br/>
