<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012816409">FREE PANCAKES! NO STRINGS ATTACHED! www.ihop.com <br/>
<br/>
Check for  local participation.<br/>
<br/>
On February 28, 2006 from 7 AM  to 2 PM IHOPs across the country <br/>
will celebrate National Pancake Day (also  known as Shrove Tuesday) <br/>
by offering our guests a free short stack of  pancakes*. This is <br/>
going to be our biggest one day celebration in our  history. <br/>
<br/>
National Pancake Day has a rich history that stretches back  <br/>
centuries and has always been a time of celebration. National <br/>
Pancake  Day always falls on Fat Tuesday and this year it will be a <br/>
celebration at  IHOP. <br/>
<br/>
So gather your friends, family and neighbors and come to your  local <br/>
IHOP and enjoy a short stack of pancakes on us. All we ask is that  <br/>
you consider making a donation to a great charity like First Book or  <br/>
other local, worthy cause. Where else would you celebrate National  <br/>
Pancake Day than IHOP? See you there. <br/>
<br/>
* Limit one free short stack  per guest. Valid for dine-in only, no <br/>
to go orders. Not valid with any other  offer, special, coupon, or <br/>
discount. Valid at participating restaurants  only, while supplies <br/>
last.<br/>
