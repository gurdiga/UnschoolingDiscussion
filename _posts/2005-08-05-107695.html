And if Piaget&#39;s stages are useful at all, it&#39;s to show that there&#39;s a <br/>
spectrum of developmental needs people pass through, and that none of the states will <br/>
last a lifetime.<br/>

Marty is currently big into peers.   Kirby is coming out of that phase.   He <br/>
still has a lot of friends, but he&#39;s quite unlikely to change the way he <br/>
dresses or sits to please them.    <br/>
<br/>
The difference between them and kids who went to school or who weren&#39;t <br/>
parented in so &quot;attachment&quot; a way (nursing, family bed, no pressure to leave) is <br/>
that they haven&#39;t had their family replaced with a pseudo family based on age and <br/>
geography, or private-school-of-choice.<br/>
<br/>
Humans have the normal primate need to belong to a group.   Families can <br/>
satisfy that need, or families can totally trigger the search for a group <br/>
elsewhere in the same way enemy interaction or danger could.   If our children don&#39;t <br/>
feel safe with us, they will find someone who makes them feel safe.<br/>
<br/>
When schools break the bonds between children and parents, it&#39;s replaced by <br/>
groups of same-age kids, and maybe with a few teachers the kid likes.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t look long enough to find a summary that wasn&#39;t school-related <br/>
(sorry), but if you want to look more put in &quot;piaget stages of development&quot; and <br/>
you&#39;ll get lots of summaries and sites.    The peer attachment here is only <br/>
indicated by the lessening and re-appearance of &quot;egocentric thought&quot; <br/>
(self-centeredness).<br/>

Stages of Cognitive Development. <br/>
Piaget identified four stages in cognitive development:<br/>
<br/>
     1.      Sensorimotor stage (Infancy). In this period (which has 6 <br/>
stages), intelligence is demonstrated through motor activity without the use of <br/>
symbols. Knowledge of the world is limited (but developing) because its based on <br/>
physical interactions / experiences. Children acquire object permanence at <br/>
about 7 months of age (memory). Physical development (mobility) allows the child <br/>
to begin developing new intellectual abilities. Some symbollic (language) <br/>
abilities are developed at the end of this stage.<br/>
<br/>
     2.      Pre-operational stage (Toddler and Early Childhood). In this <br/>
period (which has two substages), intelligence is demonstrated through the use of <br/>
symbols, language use matures, and memory and imagination are developed, but <br/>
thinking is done in a nonlogical, nonreversable manner. Egocentric thinking <br/>
predominates<br/>
<br/>
     3.      Concrete operational stage (Elementary and early adolescence). <br/>
In this stage (characterized by 7 types of conservation: number, length, <br/>
liquid, mass, weight, area, volume), intelligence is demonstarted through logical <br/>
and systematic manipulation of symbols related to concrete objects. Operational <br/>
thinking develops (mental actions that are reversible). Egocentric thought <br/>
diminishes.<br/>
<br/>
     4.      Formal operational stage (Adolescence and adulthood). In this <br/>
stage, intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related <br/>
to abstract concepts. Early in the period there is a return to egocentric <br/>
thought. Only 35% of high school graduates in industrialized countries obtain <br/>
formal operations; many people do not think formally during adulthood.<br/>
