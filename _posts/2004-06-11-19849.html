&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2nd Annual Nevada Homeschool Network Convention<br/>
&gt; June 18 and 19, 2004<br/>
&gt; Calvary Community, 2900 N. Torrey Pines Dr.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not an unschooling conference, a variety show of homeschooling topics.  The <br/>
&gt; way it&#39;s set up (seems to be) is that each particular homeschooling group <br/>
&gt; there <br/>
&gt; is sponsoring a speaker.   I&#39;m sponsored by Las Vegas Life Learners, a new <br/>
&gt; unschooling group there.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LVLifelearners/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LVLifelearners/</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Other people I know to be on the unschooling side of life are Connie Colten;<br/>
&gt; and Elissa Wahl who&#39;s one of the authors of Christian unschooling; and <br/>
&gt; Steve and Kimberly Patrow who used to live in Albuquerque and were active in <br/>
&gt; The Goof Group, a weekly unschooling group we used to have here when Kirby <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; Marty were younger.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m so excited that I&#39;ll get to meet you in person, Sandra!  Trevor and I <br/>
will be driving over to the conference.  I&#39;m unaware of the gathering on Sunday.  <br/>
T and I plan to drive over to take a look at the G. Canyon, so don&#39;t know <br/>
what time we&#39;ll need to leave on Sunday to get where we need to be ---<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing you --- and being at the conference.<br/>

Turns out now it will be Monday, because of Father&#39;s Day.  If it turns out <br/>
you&#39;ll still be in the area, or passing back through...  well you can talk to <br/>
some of them when we&#39;re there, becausethe plan&#39;s not firmly set.<br/>
