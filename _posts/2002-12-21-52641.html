<div id="ygrps-yiv-817674168">I found the Teen Lib Handbook at B and N for $19.00. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not an expert, but that seems like a good price for an out of print book.<br/>
<br/>
just wanted to pass that along in case anyone else wanted to buy a copy.<br/>

<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>
