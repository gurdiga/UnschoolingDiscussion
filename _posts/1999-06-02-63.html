<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462478867">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Well... I figure I&#39;ll throw my intro in, since everyone is reading intros<br/>
today :)  I&#39;m 27, single mother of two boys, ages 5 1/2 and 3 1/2, I work at<br/>
home as a web designer and resell host provider.  I am informally<br/>
homeschooling my boys right now, though I&#39;ll need to start some form of<br/>
formal schooling at home for my oldest soon.  I live in Southern California,<br/>
and here we can fill out an R-4 form, to homeschool.  I still have to find<br/>
out more about that, but I have until october to register.  I&#39;d like to get<br/>
involved with other homeschoolers, especially like the group that Summer is<br/>
involved with.  That sounds wonderful!!  I&#39;m in the middle of a divorce, so<br/>
things are a little tight here, but I hope to soon have my boys involved in<br/>
some local classes (dance, acting, singing, martial arts, etc.).  Right now,<br/>
I use a lot of books, computer programs the internet to homeschool my sons,<br/>
which has been working out really well for us, so far.  Anyway.. I think<br/>
that&#39;s it for now.  I look forward to hearing more about eveyrone else!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625642187">Hi, Christine.  Go to Homefires.com - this wonderful magazine has a list of many<br/>
of the homeschool support groups in CA and also will give you some tips on R-4<br/>
(however they do not give legal advice).   Before I started homeschooling I went<br/>
to my local library and read the State Education Codes pertaining to educational<br/>
requirements in CA.   Homefires used to have a nice synopsis of the various ways<br/>
to homeschool in CA and it listed the numbers of these Ed. Codes.  They are very<br/>
boring to read, but they gave me the info I needed to know my rights.   I also<br/>
read every homeschooling book I could get  my hands on.  My most valuable info<br/>
came from other homeschoolers I met at a local park day.   Hope you enjoy<br/>
homeschooling - have fun!  ~ Shannon - 4th yr homeschooling mom to 12dd and 9ds<br/>
