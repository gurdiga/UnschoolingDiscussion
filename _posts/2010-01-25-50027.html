<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102410626">Hi Mandy, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always looking for cool stuff for my daughter to watch (it&#39;s far more easier for me to find things for my boy : just find something I like/would have liked as a boy :)) <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Nickeoldeon called &quot;iCarly&quot;. I fell in love with it. Now my kids are <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter will be five in May, but looking at the iCarly wikipedia article, I would have thought it was for preteen. I don&#39;t mean that it seems shocking or too mature, just that I don&#39;t think my (Strawberry Shortcake / Dora / Disney Princesses)- addicted girl would like this kind of show. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I love that your kids are now doing webcast, and I like the idea of suggesting to her something a bit more &quot;realistic&quot;... <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, .. I&#39;m not sure what is my question in fact, since you already told your daughter loves it. I&#39;m just going to try it :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-742396350">We are big iCarly fans here. Megan is 8 and Zoe is 3. <br/>
<br/>
There are several shows on right now in this genre, but iCarly is the only one the kids like. <br/>
<br/>
I never would have guessed Megan would like this show (she prefers animals or better yet - animals that talk) or that Zoe would like it too!  <br/>
<br/>
I like it too. Really. It is goofy in ways that make me giggle. <br/>
<br/>
The iCarly website has some fun games that Zoe likes to play (with help). <br/>

It will help enormously if you drop the idea of your child being addicted to something she loves.  I love sushi, but I&#39;m not addicted to it.  I love coffee and I&#39;m not addicted to that either, although I wouldn&#39;t relish the headache I&#39;d get if I decided to stop drinking it!<br/>

If it&#39;s not even on her radar and so very different from what she DOES love, why put it out there?  I wouldn&#39;t say iCarly is very realistic though.  It&#39;s a cute show that appeals to both of my girls, which is nice because very little appeals to both of them at their age differences.<br/>

If your daughter really likes shows with strong female characters and you&#39;d like to expand THAT idea, I&#39;d suggest Hayao Miyazaki movies.  The newest one is Ponyo, but he has so many really wonderful ones, like Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service and Totoro. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557278063">I suppose &quot;iCarly&quot; is marketed to preteens but I happen to love it and I&#39;m<br/>
32.  My daughter is really into hitting, screaming, eating, and performing.<br/>
So the Sam character on &quot;iCarly&quot; really appeals to her.  I was blown away<br/>
the first time I watched the show and saw how much that character is like my<br/>
daughter.  She also likes &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Family Ties&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, and the<br/>
sitcoms on Disney like &quot;Wizards&quot; but &quot;iCarly&quot; is clearly her favorite.  I<br/>
have always liked sitcoms very much.  And I am not sure it&#39;s very realistic<br/>
either.  If you mean &quot;live action&quot; then it is that.  You could just sit down<br/>
and watch it and invite her to see it with you.  Maybe she&#39;ll like it.<br/>
Maybe she won&#39;t.<br/>

2) I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s on our tv <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3) yes, she&#39;s not watching live action (what I meant by &quot;realistic&quot; :) ) right now . But that&#39;s because of 1 (above), not because she does not like &quot;live action&quot; (in fact, I don&#39;t know if she likes it or not, I&#39;ve never shown her) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137343895">&quot;Places in the Heart&quot; is a wonderful bookend to &quot;The Cat Returns&quot; - there<br/>
are cats in that one too. That and Kiki are probably the most unschooly.<br/>
(IMO) There&#39;s a dog in &quot;Howl&#39;s Moving Castle&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry that your wife &quot;hates Anime&quot;. It&#39;s a bit like &quot;hating books&quot;.<br/>
There are all kinds of different stories and styles of anime. Jayn used to<br/>
adore Sailor Moon. There are talking cats in SM.<br/>
<br/>
However, anime is so very likely to have stories and character that will<br/>
fascinate a child, that the hate and distrust of it emanating from a loved<br/>
adult could become a problem.<br/>
<br/>
We generally advise people to watch with their kids, and try to find what it<br/>
is that their kids like about the tv or game or activity as a path to<br/>
finding something to like about it themselves. However if a parent is so<br/>
full of negativity, as in &quot;hate&quot;, then I think it&#39;s worth that parent<br/>
staying right away until they can find a way to be at least tolerant, rather<br/>
than destroy their child&#39;s enjoyment and, more importantly, their child&#39;s<br/>
trust in the parent&#39;s judgement. Meanwhile it&#39;s great that there is one<br/>
parent who does share the enjoyment.<br/>
When Jayn is watching something I don&#39;t enjoy - usually because I have seen<br/>
it 25 times already - I find something else to do, sometimes with my<br/>
earplugs in. She will call me to watch those little special moments of humor<br/>
that have become some of our family in jokes. Dh has different moments,<br/>
different interests. I don&#39;t think we have the expectation that he will<br/>
watch all the same things, do all the same games, with Jayn as I do. That&#39;s<br/>
one reason why it&#39;s great to have two parents around - or more than one<br/>
trusted adult around.<br/>
<br/>
I have never been in a situation where I have &quot;hated&quot; something Jayn loves.<br/>
Sighed with boredom, not liked much, a minor amount of discomfort - but<br/>
never the kind of emotional investment of &quot;hate&quot;. Jayn has never challenged<br/>
me with a passion for something that opposes my core belief system though. I<br/>
hope if she ever does I will find my way to applying unschooling principles<br/>
to the situation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420179756">My daughter Ashlin (turning 5 in a few weeks) currently enjoys the following shows:<br/>
<br/>
nature documentaries<br/>
dinosaur &#39;documentaries&#39; (eg. Walking with Dinosaurs)<br/>
Lord of the Rings (we skip through the scary parts)<br/>
Howl&#39;s Moving Castle (a particular family favourite)<br/>
Kung Fu Panda<br/>
Peter Pan<br/>
Charlie and Lola (not very unschooly I&#39;m afraid)<br/>
Captain Mack<br/>
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon<br/>
Little Princess (narrated by Julian Clary)<br/>
<br/>
I have learned an enormous amount watching these shows with her, and have seen her learning expand exponentially. I really like seeing how she incorporates various elements of things she has seen on tv into her own play - we have many games involving Mummy and Daddy Predator going out to hunt for food for their babies, or hobbits trekking through the forest, etc.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
My point is that iCarly is very different from her already current interests.  Not that bringing new and interesting things to a kid is a bad idea, but for a little girl who&#39;s interests seem to be more along the lines of cute and girly, I&#39;d go that direction to add new and interesting things.<br/>
<br/>
That is what I meant by meaningful and not so hugely different from what she DOES like.  That&#39;s what I&#39;ve done with my kids, add to what they like already and keep adding and keep adding, and soon they add things themselves and it just naturally flows from one thing to the next thing.  It really depends on WHY a child likes a certain thing.  If a parent knows why, then they can add to it better, and the adding to need not be other tv shows, it could be games or costumes or action figures, or big screen movies.  <br/>
<br/>
If one of my kids was really into romantic comedy, I&#39;d look for more of that, not a sci-fi, that I&#39;d heard was good and may just be really good, but not a romantic comedy by any means.  iCarly is a really cute show, though, and your daughter may love it!  <br/>
<br/>
***As for Miyazaki, it&#39;s on my list. We already watched The cat returns (not by Miyazaki), and she loved it (but it&#39;s with cats, which she just loves).

<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve encountered anime ignorance many times over the years... the one that blew me away the most was a middle school teacher that had no idea what it was.  Anime is just a different kind of animation.  It&#39;s not Warner Brothers.  It would be worth finding out what your wife hates about it.  It would be a bit like dismissing all mystery novels because you didn&#39;t like sherlock holmes.  Anime has been so huge in our lives in really wonderful ways.  What I find really enjoyable about much of anime, whether or not the story or actual animation is thrilling for me, the plot lines and behind the scenes part of it is soooo detailed and that would be true for all anime.  The characters are created with history already existing and so, it can play a part in the story.  It&#39;s fascinating from a social/cultural context.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve seen almost all of the the Studio Ghibli movies whether they were made my Miyazaki or not, even Grave of the Fireflies, which I wouldn&#39;t recommend at all to young kids.  I&#39;ve watched hundreds of hours of Pokemon, Inuyasha, and Naruto, as well as Bleach, Death Note, and Full Metal Alchemist, and plenty of other ones, the bloodier the better in my older daughter&#39;s view.  When it all started with Pokemon, I had no idea that I&#39;d log that many hours into anime.  I didn&#39;t even know much about it at all, but I&#39;ve come to appreciate it deeply, the music, the art, the stories, it has opened up so many worlds and connections.<br/>
<br/>
Hating anything that your children like, closes doors to learning and growing  It&#39;s really that simple.  It doesn&#39;t mean you have to love everything they love, it just means you need to be open to the possibility of loving it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-941044832">For what it&#39;s worth, my daughter (the 4 year old &quot;iCarly&quot; fan) also likes My<br/>
Little Pony, Littlest Pet Shop, Tinkerbell, Strawberry Shortcake...  at<br/>
least she plays with the toys.  She&#39;s not been exposed too much to those<br/>
things on television.  I think showing her an episode of &quot;iCarly&quot; is so easy<br/>
and simple and not a big deal.  If she likes it, great.  If not, no harm<br/>
done.  The iCarly website is a lot of fun too.  You could let her check that<br/>
out with you and see if she might enjoy an episode:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.icarly.com/.">http://www.icarly.com/.</a><br/>

to *check* for problems such as unconsciously steering a child toward  <br/>
something a parent might find more acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
After several decades living with the message that kids don&#39;t know  <br/>
what they need and parents know what&#39;s best for them, that attitude  <br/>
can creep into our choices without us realizing it. So it&#39;s a good  <br/>
idea to examine what your motives are for showing her something  <br/>
that&#39;s very different than what she&#39;s picking on her own.<br/>

When Jayn was very young we watched a LOT of &quot;Max & Ruby&quot;, but now at 10 she<br/>
likes a lot of different shows, unpredicted by me, and our movie collection<br/>

<br/>
***But how can you be sure that your (hypothetical romantic-lover) kid would not love too the sci-fi thing ? ***<br/>
<br/>
I never said it was a problem.  Without going back and rereading, I think I asked why you would do that.  When I read what you wrote, and it could be misinterpreted because of french to english translation, it sounded like you were wanting to steer her away from something.<br/>
<br/>
Introducing kids to new things is great.  It&#39;s really good to know WHY your kids like certain things, so that you can add to it.  If what your daughter likes about shows is the girl friendship aspect, iCarly might just work great.  I can think of some little girls that I&#39;ve known that were super into really cutesy girly things, that wouldn&#39;t have appreciated iCarly or various other shows similar because they really really liked the cutesy girly things better, and while they wouldn&#39;t have hated or completely dismissed the other shows, they just wouldn&#39;t have been into them at all.<br/>
<br/>
Same with the hypothetical romance lover potentially liking sci-fi, that kid could find that she likes sci-fi.  However, if I&#39;m wanting to steer her away from romance movies to get her interested in sci-fi, that might not go over so well.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more about motive and intent.  Since you had used the word &quot;addicted&quot;, it seemed like perhaps you wanted to offer things that weren&#39;t so addicting.  Again that could be a language usage difference here.  Generally, addictions aren&#39;t considered healthy or good.<br/>
<br/>
***She told me it&#39;s the drawing style. (she has no problem with watching &quot;western&quot; animated movies with kids, on the contrary)***<br/>
<br/>
There are some good &quot;western&quot; animated movies and shows for sure.  There are some anime things that I don&#39;t really care for.  It really depends on the art, the story, and the music.  I have a friend who&#39;s family loves anime and she can take it or leave it, but she does really really like a show called Hell Girl.  She loves the art and story in that particular show.  What has really appealed to me, as an artist, is the way backgrounds are put into anime, and the details in clothing and surroundings and the way the scenes mesh together.  It is one reason Hayao Miyazaki stands out, his work is brilliant in that regard!<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter, the anime lover, is really particular about anime art.  She pays attention to how the facial features are done and how an artist has portrayed hair and clothing, and even more importantly how blood is portrayed, or not.   There have been very few &quot;western&quot; animated things that have that level of detail that she loves.  The Nightmare Before Christmas, is one.  Shrek is another.  When she was younger, her 2 favorites were the Lion King and Aladdin, both, really detailed and dramatic.<br/>

and some of the applications of the ideas in people&#39;s real lives, and <br/>
most of us slowly integrate those big ideas into our thinking so that <br/>
all the things we do in our daily lives come out of the context of those <br/>
bigger ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Sort of like this....a &quot;big idea&quot; for me is to be as honest as possible. <br/>
When my child asks me a question that is uncomfortable, I am guided by <br/>
that big idea - I answer as honestly as possible.<br/>

questions -  do you trust yourself not to mess them up by schooling <br/>
them? Do you trust someone else not to mess them up if you send them off <br/>

Someone came here once asking whether or not she should let her kids  <br/>
watch some particular show (or play some game, or whatever it was).   <br/>
She wanted a consensus on Yes or No.  When there was discussion and  <br/>
people were talking about principles, she got totally ticked off and  <br/>

there are definitely choices that move toward and choices that move<br/>
away from the goal. We can talk about why something moves closer, how<br/>
it makes a child feel and why they react as they do to it. That&#39;s one<br/>

Here!  Chamille did!  She was operating the remote control and vhs player at the age of 2.  I don&#39;t know how she figured it out, she just did.

It might help for you to not see it as an accusation.  Since I was the one who asked &quot;why?&quot; about the iCarly show, it was based on the words that you used in regards to navigating tv shows with a young child.  I don&#39;t think anybody has said, &quot;don&#39;t watch iCarly, don&#39;t pick shows out for your daughter.&quot;  Kids don&#39;t need to be able to read to pick out shows on tv and use a remote control.  If they know which basic buttons to use, they&#39;ll use them, if they stumble onto something that interests them, they&#39;ll stop and watch.  I&#39;m finding it hard to imagine a 4 yr old that doesn&#39;t have a clue as to what they want to watch, so much so, that they are completely reliant on their parents to figure it out for them.  <br/>
<br/>
There are literally thousands of movies and shows geared towards 4 yr olds.  Out of those thousands, there will be some that appeal and some that won&#39;t.  Go towards what you think will appeal based on who that 4 yr old is and what she likes.  My oldest loved Pokemon at that age, my youngest never seemed interested, in fact hardly watched much tv at all at that age.  If someone had said to me, &quot;oh my 4 yr old daughter loves Pokemon, your&#39;s might to.&quot;, I would&#39;ve thought, &quot;maybe, but I doubt it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***o, I think this is a not a good list for me (no bad feeling). I need help and advice with my kids, not high level ideas.*** <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a high level of idea to think about looking directly at your kids and seeing what they like and dislike and go from there, offering more as you go along, letting them grab onto some things and let go of others.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was the way in which you were presenting tv watching that caused the confusion, at least for me.  It really did sound like you were trying to steer your child away from all the cutesy girly shows that she was addicted to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think Mathilde was also doing it, but for me, that&#39;s not a &quot;real/free choice&quot;, she was only playing on the games I installed, she was not picking games on her own. <br/>
<br/>
Like, Mathieu likes playing Star Wars Battlegrounds a lot, but I selected it for him. <br/>
<br/>
For me, to pick some thing &quot;on your own&quot;, you need to be able to discover the thing by yourself. When you choose things in a restricted selection made by someone else, you&#39;re not picking on your own. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-631275055">Hi Jenny, <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Desktop shortcuts. My husband did that on lots of various computers we&#39;ve had so the kids could get they wanted with a simple double click of the mouse. To me, that sounds like an overwhelming task, to him, it&#39;s easy peasy and he just does it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thumbnails view are good too. But, they&#39;re still not really picking their own choice : they&#39;re choosing among the things I pre-selected for them. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;know which basic buttons to use, they&#39;ll use them, if they stumble onto something that interests them, they&#39;ll stop and watch. I&#39;m finding it hard to imagine a 4 yr old that doesn&#39;t have a clue as to &gt;what they want to watch, so much so, that they are completely reliant on their parents to figure it out for them. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe our setup it too complicated, or too computer based, but they don&#39;t surf on the tv. Also, we&#39;re much more (we the parents) of the &quot;watch something recorded&quot; kind rather than &quot;watch what&#39;s on&quot; , so that must not help. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If someone had said to me, &quot;oh my 4 yr old daughter loves Pokemon, your&#39;s might to.&quot;, I would&#39;ve thought, &quot;maybe, but I doubt it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe, but you can be wrong, and by not trying, missing something. (in fact, I a bit doubtful about iCarly (that&#39;s why I replied to the original poster), but.. I&#39;m not sure) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(maybe it&#39;s also because I&#39;m a man, and finding stuff my boy would like is easy, whereas I believe (maybe i&#39;m wrong) that it&#39;s much harder with my daughter) <br/>
<br/>
For example, I don&#39;t understand why she did not like Hilltop Hospital, which is quite cute, and which is about sick animals... <br/>
<br/>
As already said, she likes Futuruma. Is it cute ? Is is geared towards 4yo girl ? I don&#39;t think so. Why then ? She knows I&#39;ll watch it with her, but I also take great pleasure in watching things more &quot;appropriate&quot;, like Phineas & Ferb, or Avatar, so it&#39;s not only for me. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a high level of idea to think about looking directly at your kids and seeing what they like and dislike and go from there, offering more as you go along, letting them grab onto some things and let go of others. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I&#39;m doing. I just don&#39;t think I should offer only things they like -now- (more exactly : things based on what -I- believe they like and dislike), because I can be wrong. Mathieu LOVES GI.Joe, and a few days ago, watched three strawberry shortcakes in one sitting. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think it was the way in which you were presenting tv watching that caused the confusion, at least for me. It really did sound like you were trying to steer your child away from all the cutesy girly shows that she was addicted to. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, my wording was clumsy. That&#39;s totally not my goal. My goal is just finding stuff she&#39;d like. I also liked the idea that she could after watching iCarly wants to do her own webcast (like the original poster&#39;s kids) , but that&#39;s the worst I can find about my goals :) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway I have some iCarly shows available, I&#39;m going to try soon. <br/>

&gt; your own.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve lost sight of the goal ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The goal isn&#39;t to provide every choice in the world. Even adults  <br/>
don&#39;t have that. Until the internet, my choices were limited by what  <br/>
store buyers within a range I was willing to drive would choose to  <br/>
stock. That&#39;s hardly every choice in the world and it&#39;s limited by  <br/>
other&#39;s decisions.<br/>
<br/>
The goal *for unschooling* is to help your child find what she likes  <br/>
and avoid the things she doesn&#39;t like. If your goal is unschooling,  <br/>
the choices you give her access to are what you believe she might  <br/>
like based on what she&#39;s shown she likes. Basically you&#39;re using your  <br/>
greater powers of filtering to filter the world the way *she* would  <br/>
choose to if she could or wanted to. (At 18 my daughter enjoys  <br/>
exploring music as widely as technology and record stores allow her  <br/>
to do, but, though she loves going to plays with us, she&#39;s not  <br/>
scouring the listings. She appreciates us showing her a few options  <br/>
we think we all might enjoy together.)<br/>
<br/>
No child wants all the choices in the world. I doubt most adults do  <br/>
either. Many people have their favorite stores to shop in because the  <br/>
store buyers have tastes that match their own. They don&#39;t want to  <br/>
choose from 10,000 different styles of pants. They just want a few  <br/>
dozen.<br/>
<br/>
Where this line of discussion got derailed is this from your original  <br/>
post:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think my (Strawberry Shortcake / Dora / Disney Princesses)-  <br/>
&gt; addicted girl would like this kind of show.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I love that your kids are now doing webcast, and I like the  <br/>
&gt; idea of suggesting to her something a bit more &quot;realistic&quot;...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, .. I&#39;m not sure what is my question in fact, since you already  <br/>
&gt; told your daughter loves it. I&#39;m just going to try it :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, in English, to help people move toward unschooling, addicted  <br/>
is a negative word to refer to children&#39;s passions. Yes, I know you  <br/>
later said you didn&#39;t mean it negatively. But in posts we only have  <br/>
words not the intended meaning. So to be clear in writing and in  <br/>
thinking, it good to keep in mind the meaning others will generally  <br/>
read into words.<br/>
<br/>
So the words in the first line suggest there are negative feelings  <br/>
about your daughter&#39;s choices. (Again, we&#39;re talking about the idea  <br/>
suggested by the words. Whether or not the idea is in your home, it&#39;s  <br/>
now on the list and in people&#39;s heads. Not about you, but as a  <br/>
concept to discuss. *Other* people will have thought &quot;addicted&quot; about  <br/>
their children&#39;s passions in a negative way so it&#39;s a good  <br/>
opportunity to discuss it.)<br/>
<br/>
Second, you like that someone&#39;s children are doing webcasts because  <br/>
they watch the show. This kind of thinking -- while natural and  <br/>
common -- will lead someone away from unschooling. It&#39;s the &quot;If I  <br/>
expose my child to x, then maybe my child will do the y that I think  <br/>
is cool.&quot; For unschooling purposes, it&#39;s good to face the child  <br/>
rather than some direction you&#39;d like them to go. It&#39;s good to focus  <br/>
on the enjoyment and not a direction you think an interest will lead.  <br/>
If a parent wants disappointment and frustration and negative  <br/>
attitudes toward a child, then it&#39;s a good path. ;-) (Not a path that  <br/>
guarantees that destination, but a path that leads that direction.)<br/>
<br/>
I suspect you&#39;d be okay if she never did a webcam after watching the  <br/>
show, but to entertain a cool direction an interest could go is not  <br/>
healthy for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a real life example: My daughter loves running and is a  <br/>
natural long distance runner. She joined the cross country team as a  <br/>
&quot;freshman&quot; (in my town homeschoolers can compete on school sports  <br/>
teams) and immediately made varsity (top 10 runners on the team). My  <br/>
husband was on the same team 35 years ago and wanted to help her do  <br/>
what he did. She was enthusiastic at first. It took a year or so for  <br/>
her to realize she loved running but didn&#39;t like competition. It took  <br/>
my husband much longer for him to fully grasp what she was saying. It  <br/>
didn&#39;t make sense to him! ;-) He&#39;s not a rabid competitor but he  <br/>
likes the personal challenges. It didn&#39;t make sense to him that  <br/>
someone could run well and not care whether they were improving or  <br/>
not. And because he was facing the goal instead of her, there was a  <br/>
lot of strain between them before they both finally figure it out and  <br/>
he accepted it.<br/>
<br/>
Third, you&#39;re liking the idea of suggesting something more realistic,  <br/>
implying -- again, we only have words not intent -- there&#39;s something  <br/>
lacking in her current choices.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s another good idea to pull out and discuss for people trying to  <br/>
get unschooling. It&#39;s good for unschooling to provide a variety of  <br/>
choices and opportunities, even stretching beyond what a child has  <br/>
shown she likes. We can&#39;t know whether they like dinosaurs if they&#39;ve  <br/>
never been exposed to them.<br/>
<br/>
*But* if a parent is judging a child&#39;s choices as not as good as  <br/>
activities the parent thinks are more worthwhile, that&#39;s a line of  <br/>
thinking that isn&#39;t good for unschooling. To help a parent stop  <br/>
unconsciously pressuring a child in the direction the parent wants  <br/>
them to go, it would be better for the parent to *first* fully  <br/>
embrace the child&#39;s passions and help the child explore those in the  <br/>
way the *child* enjoys before the parent strews other ideas. The  <br/>
parent needs to let go of the idea of pulling a child away from  <br/>
something and embrace the idea of a range of choices the child enjoys  <br/>
and being cool with what the child chooses.<br/>
<br/>
Again, we&#39;re not talking about you. We&#39;re talking about the ideas the  <br/>
words have suggested.<br/>
<br/>
If you do want your ideas discussed, being as clear as you can be in  <br/>
your wording helps. But once the discussion of an idea begins, that  <br/>
idea doesn&#39;t belong to you anymore. It belongs to the list. You can  <br/>
bring in new ideas that are closer to what might be troubling you,  <br/>
but once the ideas reach the list, they&#39;re not yours anymore.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-686550120">&lt;&lt;&lt; For me, to pick some thing &quot;on your own&quot;, you need to be able to<br/>
discover the thing by yourself. When you choose things in a restricted<br/>
selection made by someone else, you&#39;re not picking on your own. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Children being and doing things &quot;on their own&quot; isn&#39;t an unschooling goal.<br/>
It&#39;s more like a life skill that will come with maturity (for most people -<br/>
certain medical conditions excepted).<br/>
<br/>
My daughter had wanted to do things on her own, meaning without my help, in<br/>
piece meal manner. It hasn&#39;t been a linear thing either - she will return to<br/>
wanting help after appearing to master something. For example, for a long<br/>
time she would ask me to do the difficult parts of her computer games, that<br/>
she can now do for herself. However she will still ask me to do what she<br/>
considers to be the boring parts.Then in her personal needs she has long<br/>
moved from needing a lot of physical help, to only asking me to help her<br/>
rarely. This is natural.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that Guillaume is talking about something more mental - the idea<br/>
of making choices freely. But again there is a difference, one of the most<br/>
wiggly concepts to work into, between a child being free to make their own<br/>
choices, and a child being left to make their own choices.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of times there has been a kind of impatience expressed for the<br/>
child to learn to read, as if that will be the magic talisman that will<br/>
release the parents from responsibility for helping or supporting the choice<br/>
making process. I think it&#39;s a problematic idea, and perhaps not what<br/>
Guillame intended to express.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to offer your child choices based on visual cues. When I took<br/>
infant/toddler Jayn clothes shopping I would hold up two garments and buy<br/>
the one she reached for. Soon we could peruse the DVD aisles and she would<br/>
look at pictures of fun characters. It&#39;s about being out in the world and<br/>
watching and listening.<br/>
<br/>
Children read at different times, unrelated to parental desire. Impatience,<br/>
even well intentioned impatience, won&#39;t speed and may hinder the process.<br/>
Also just because a child can read, does not mean that parents shouldn&#39;t<br/>
still read to them and with them and be intimately involved in the choices.<br/>
My daughter wants me to advise her - on her own terms by which I mean when<br/>
she asks me for advice. I would say that as she matures she is asking for my<br/>
opinion more often and with more willingness to hear it, rather than less.<br/>
<br/>
The range of new offerings need not be done in a vacuum. Guillame seems<br/>
laudably concerned that he is limiting his children&#39;s choices to his own<br/>
interests, but seems equally worried because apparently because they like<br/>
what he has offered them! That is the place to start with the next offering<br/>
- games that are similar, other ways into the same world.<br/>
<br/>
For example - starting with Star Wars Battleground - other games that are<br/>
similar in a variety of ways, other sci-fi games, other battle games; the<br/>
Star Wars movies; Star Wars Clone Wars animated series; picture books about<br/>
Star Wars and the making of the movies; some of the numerous (really<br/>
numerous) novels set in the Star Wars universe; toys and figures - then of<br/>
course the other games might be pathways to other activities too.<br/>
<br/>
There is no predicting the path of a single interest. The way to offer might<br/>
be as simple as reading the tv guide and saying, &quot;Oh look what&#39;s on<br/>
tomorrow&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is that time, living in the world, and avoiding the<br/>
creation of artificial barriers to such interests as they will express, as<br/>
you will observe them expressing, will take care of your fears that their<br/>
choices are not real. They will find other influences and other sources of<br/>
inspiration. The other side of that is, of course there is another side,<br/>
just because they have plenty of new information coming in from the outside<br/>
world, does not then mean that parents are released from actively<br/>
unschooling, or that the kids are abandoned to make choices &quot;on their own&quot;.<br/>

So, he did not pick it &quot;on his own&quot;... Your sister recorded the tape  <br/>
for him. He was stuck with her selection. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Did you look at my strewing page when I posted it?  When I post a link  <br/>
like this, and when people ignore them, it&#39;s frustrating.<br/>
<br/>

He was not ever for one moment STUCK with the gift my sister gave  <br/>
him.  We had many other videos, too.  That was an example.  Every  <br/>
single time he asked for it, he was making a choice.<br/>
<br/>
-=-For me, to pick some thing &quot;on your own&quot;, you need to be able to  <br/>
discover the thing by yourself. When you choose things in a restricted  <br/>
selection made by someone else, you&#39;re not picking on your own. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Please try not to be stuck on that phrase.  If your children have the  <br/>
right to refuse an offer of a game or video, if you&#39;ll turn it off  <br/>
when they don&#39;t like it, they are making choices.  We could argue this  <br/>
into the ground, but a much better use of this discussion would be to  <br/>
talk about things that can help people understand unschooling better.<br/>
<br/>
This really would help, I think:<br/>

&gt; Maybe our setup it too complicated, or too computer based, but they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; surf on the tv. Also, we&#39;re much more (we the parents) of the &quot;watch<br/>
&gt; something recorded&quot; kind rather than &quot;watch what&#39;s on&quot; , so that must not<br/>
&gt; help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have a very computer based setup, too; we record things onto our  Media<br/>
Center and very rarely watch TV &#39;live&#39;, but it doesn&#39;t really restrict the<br/>
children at all. They watch the trailers and the two or three minutes of<br/>
stuff at the beginning and end of programmes and if any of it interests them<br/>
we&#39;ll record that. They play games on the CBeebies website and if the<br/>
characters take their fancy they may ask us to record the relevant show.<br/>
They ask us to find or record programmes they see advertised in magazines or<br/>
in shops. They watch BBC iPlayer and sometimes ask us to record things they<br/>
watch on there. And of course they aren&#39;t restricted to things we&#39;ve<br/>
recorded for them; it wouldn&#39;t have occurred to either me or James that our<br/>
eldest would enjoy watching &#39;Rough Science&#39; as a four-year-old. We recorded<br/>
it for ourselves, but she watched and loved it so we recorded the next four<br/>
series for her.<br/>
<br/>
I realise writing this that the majority of what my children watch is still<br/>
restricted to the BBC (they do watch a handful of shows on other channels<br/>
but not many) but I&#39;d say two thirds of what they watch is stuff I didn&#39;t<br/>
choose to record for them. And some of those were found and chosen by my<br/>
non-reading nearly four-year-old, too.<br/>
