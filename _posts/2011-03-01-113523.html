<div id="ygrps-yiv-70383789">Hi Sandra and Group,<br/>
<br/>
Where and how can I access the google groups unschooling discussion page?<br/>
<br/>
Holy Cow - What I have to walk through to keep recommitting to unschooling.  It is so hard.  I have had a monkey mind this past week.  I am freaking out because I don&#39;t like piercings, sexy pictures of a 12 year old, tattoos, or anything that glorifies or is suggestive of drugs or a druggy life.  That life almost killed me.  For some, it works, but NOT for me.  Plus, I have triggers that are NOT about any of you readers out there.<br/>
<br/>
These are triggers from my life.  I have friends with tattoos and piercings whom I adore.  I have friends who smoke pot.  I don&#39;t let them drive my daughter around.  I love them, though.  I have sober friends with tats and piercings who do not glorify drugs.  I know it is not about the outsides, but I am a mess because of the outside stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
For example, I hate where my best friend lives.  I am NOT judging her.  I am not even discerning whether her location is safe for me.  I feel safe in her home.  I hate it because it reminds me when I lived in an area like that and was molested alot by the neighborhood kids.  Intellectually, I know that the place did not matter because, when we did have money and live in a different place, it happened again.  My parents were not attentive like I am, and like my friends are, so my reaction is from within me.  THE CAUSE IS WITHIN, THE EFFECT IS WITHOUT!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Here is my problem:  There is a small voice, probably based in ego, that is saying to me: you should send her to Waldorf where there are nice wholesome children.  There is stimulation there.  She could be directed and influenced in a different way.  Perhaps this way is wrong, and I am screwing up my kid.  I am afraid. <br/>
<br/>
The facts are these:  My BFF and her daughter are attached.  My daughter loves her daughter, and they play like they own restaurants, do modeling where I take some of those sexy pictures (I don&#39;t feel afraid when we are doing it), etc...  I love this little girl and do not feel worried when I am in their presence.  The sexy pictures are not associated with actual sexual behaviors. And if my daughter&#39;s bff learns something about life that I don&#39;t want my daughter to know about, she is great not to tell her.  My daughter is 10 and her bff is 12.  The pictures are posted in a safe zone with safe friends and family who know her.  Those are the facts.  <br/>
<br/>
I am just saying, my brain is trying to get me to think that my daughter is bored as an unschooler, and will go a path of least resistance to drugs.  It will be my fault for not stimulating her, or getting her around Waldorf children.<br/>
<br/>
The Waldorf idea is crazy for me to think, also.  Because Hannah wanted to try Waldorf.  She tried it for 2 weeks, and we were out of there.  They are a bit bizarre also.  Little kids were forced to sit outside of their kindergarten class because they didn&#39;t want to eat their porridge.  <br/>
<br/>
I use this unschooling discussion list for support when I need it.  I need it today.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-399742728">Basically, the way that I am reading this, is that you are being triggered by <br/>
photography play that suggests sexy and that it terrifies you.<br/>
<br/>
You think that your daughter might be bored and doing these photo shoots because <br/>
of boredom.  You think that if she does these photo shoots, it will lead to <br/>
something else down the road that is unhealthy.  Just because you fear that one <br/>
will lead to the other, even if you&#39;ve known people where this is the case, it <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that it will be true for your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
The facts that you shared are that she is playing.  She is enjoying dressing up <br/>
and pretending to be something other than who she is and capturing the moment <br/>
with pictures as part of the play.  I don&#39;t see anything wrong with that.  Does <br/>
she have any magazine subscriptions?  Have you ever taken her to any fashion <br/>
runway shows?  Sometimes the local malls will do them.  Does she enjoy fashion? <br/>
 How about designing clothing?<br/>
<br/>
If she is bored, feed her interest.  She&#39;s 10, it&#39;s a pretty big transitional <br/>
age for a lot of girls, and it lasts a couple of years.  All those seemingly <br/>
little things that she is interested in right now, the play restaurant, the <br/>
pretend modeling, all of it exists in real life.  She&#39;s trying on various <br/>
lifestyles and ideas.  Encourage that.  She&#39;s going to keep trying things on and <br/>
eventually she will find a niche that fits.  <br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s bored, it doesn&#39;t mean she is going to seek drugs to satisfy her <br/>
boredom.  Sure lots of people do that.  There are even unschooled kids that have <br/>
experimented.  The difference, that I&#39;ve seen, is the underlying reasons for <br/>
doing it.  I&#39;ve yet to meet an unschooler that has experimented in drug usage as <br/>
a means of escapism.  I&#39;ve met a LOT of public schooled kids that do.<br/>
<br/>
Make your daughter&#39;s life so happy that she has nothing to escape from. <br/>
 Encourage happy play.  Encourage safe pretend play.  Add to it, make it more <br/>
fun.  Create that safe haven that learning flourishes in.  All that play and <br/>
pretending is learning, it IS how children learn.  <br/>
<br/>
Find fancy dinner table decorations, cool waitress attire, interesting menu <br/>
options, find interesting fashion clothing, do up hair and makeup, try on shoes, <br/>
add accessories, do interesting things with lighting and backgrounds and camera <br/>
angles.  Inspire more fun and creativity in the play they already do.<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
If you feel helpless, you are.<br/>
If you feel powerless, you are.<br/>
<br/>
Make conscious choices, in little ways, in ways that make your family warmer and more comfortable.  Not a few big decisions, but a hundred of little decisions in the next 20 hours.  Tone of voice.  Smile/no-smile.  Patience/rush.  Gentle/jerky.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Try not to hate anything more than you &quot;have to,&quot; and once you get to thinking more positively, you might find there&#39;s is nothing you have to hate.<br/>

Anytime an unschooling mother thinks she&#39;s not doing enough, the simple solution is for her to do more.   Here are some ideas:<br/>
