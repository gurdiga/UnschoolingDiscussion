Hi Julie! Can you tell me more about these Klingon books? My almost 13 year old is very interested in Klingon - and we haven&#39;t seen these books here in Australia! Titles? Thanks...Leonie<br/>

I&#39;ve heard some ardent missionary-type has translated the Bible into Klingon!<br/>
That should keep Michael Dorn from going to hell.<br/>

Wait a minute....)<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone here TNG fan enough to tell me the season and episode name (or <br/>
number, or however they do it) of the episode when Data was temporarily in <br/>
command, there was a battle situation, Warf snorted kind of derisively about some <br/>
command Data had given, and they ended up in the ready room having a serious <br/>
exchange?  I was trying to tell Keith which episode I was thinking about one time <br/>
and wasn&#39;t coming up with enough to identify it for him.<br/>
<br/>
For people who are just really interested in languages, it used to be that <br/>
one of the coolest resources was Asterix and Obelix comics, which are in LOTS of <br/>
languages, and Latin.  But nowadays there are online webthings that <br/>
translate, and that&#39;s pretty glorious.  And DVDs with other audio tracks, and subtitles.<br/>

Hi Leonie.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure he got them through Amazon.com. And he has seen the Klingon Bible too. <br/>
He met some Klingon speakers online and went to a Klingon get-together that was about <br/>
20 miles from us. There he was exposed to even more Klingon books than he knew <br/>
existed. The other day he found &quot;Who&#39;s on First&quot; in Klingon on audio online. Here&#39;s the link <br/>
for that:<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll ask him for some other links.<br/>
<br/>
He is really getting into constructed languages now and loves Klingon especially even <br/>
though he isn&#39;t a Trekkie at all.<br/>
