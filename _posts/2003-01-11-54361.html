<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847439400">Hello<br/>
<br/>
My name is Heidi, mother of four, homeschooling three (oldest is <br/>
grown up and lives in another state). Idaho is our home, out in the <br/>
country. <br/>
<br/>
I just surfed in, in a manner of speaking, when searching for info on <br/>
unschooling. As near as I can ascertain, my style of homeschooling is <br/>
closer to &quot;unschooling&quot; than anything else. <br/>
<br/>
We never have used just one curriculum, ranging from Principle <br/>
Approach to KONOS to Robinson Method, utilizing Saxon Math, the <br/>
Writing Road to Reading, and the PUBLIC LIBRARY extensively, <br/>
developing a great home library and raising chickens all along the <br/>
way. <br/>
<br/>
so, is there an official &quot;introduce yourself&quot; place, or is this it?<br/>
<br/>
hoping to interact quite a bit as I make some decisions about our <br/>
education options...<br/>
<br/>
blessings, Heidi</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-473794469">Hi Joyce,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the greeting.<br/>
<br/>
This looks like ONE BUSY BOARD!<br/>
<br/>
Relaxed, eh? Yeah, that&#39;d be me! L So how does unschooling differ <br/>
from the kind of thing I describe: picking and choosing what looks <br/>
good, letting my kids get their knowledge from reading very good <br/>
books and some good Natural Science TV programs, and letting <br/>
especially the &quot;littles&quot; play more than any other thing? (MATH EVERY <br/>
DAY has been just about the only rule)...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll see if the library has Holt&#39;s books and read up on his theories. <br/>
<br/>
and I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be lots of questions for the board.<br/>
<br/>
thanks again<br/>
<br/>
Heidi<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; nervous about not seeing progress that resembles school and then <br/>
 </span></blockquote>make them <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; do things so we can see the results of learning.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>After 7 years of &quot;relaxed&quot; homeschooling, using methods that don&#39;t <br/>
resemble school in the slightest, and having results that please me <br/>
overall, I&#39;m definitely not nervous about trying to look like school <br/>
or have results that look like school. I am pondering this deeply, <br/>
rattling it out in my computer journal, thinking about it, praying <br/>
about, discussing it with my hubby. And what I think makes me nervous <br/>
is...illiteracy, I guess. <br/>
<br/>
How do unschooled children learn long division? What do they do to <br/>
practice it? What about algebra and other higher mathematics? I&#39;m <br/>
reading a lot about the practical uses of what we learn, and I agree <br/>
wholeheartedly BUT...the brain work that goes into learning and <br/>
knowing how to do abstract number exercises like algebra, increases <br/>
the ability of the brain to think about ANY subject. It&#39;s GOOD for <br/>
the brain to &quot;workout&quot; by doing abstract stuff. And so, how would an <br/>
unschooling family get algebra across to the kids? Or long division, <br/>
for that matter? LOL <br/>
<br/>
I &quot;make&quot; my kids do their math...lying in a puddle of sunshine on the <br/>
front room floor, wrap-ups in the recliner, Math Minute drills, etc. <br/>
Right now, the two younger ones are playing dominos...MATH! but would <br/>
unschooling REALLY say not to give them seat work to practice their <br/>
basic number skills, and on a consistent basis? If I waited for them <br/>
to come to me asking how to divide...well, I sure wouldn&#39;t hold my <br/>
breath!<br/>
<br/>
truly, just wanting to figure it out.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Seat work&quot; is schoolwork.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I waited for them to come to me asking how to divide...well, I sure <br/>
wouldn&#39;t hold my <br/>
breath!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mine all know how to divide.  They might not know how to set it up to look <br/>
like traditional school divisor-format long division, but they divide things <br/>
in their heads I can&#39;t (I have to get the pencil and paper) and having <br/>
developed their own methods for figuring stuff out, they understand <br/>
mathematical thinking whereas most schoolkids only know how to do the <br/>
calcuations on a &quot;problem&quot; which is actually the solution to an unnamed <br/>
problem, without the calculations having been done.  <br/>
<br/>
Ten minutes ago, before I came in here, Holly and I were figuring out how <br/>
long a video tape was which included two 112 minute shows.  It took <br/>
multiplication and division by 60 and she was right there and double checked <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to explain all at once how they&#39;ve learned to do what they can do. <br/>
I wish I had collected all my reports of specific instances.  Did anyone keep <br/>
or remember where I might find the one about Kirby teaching an adult to <br/>
multiply by 18?<br/>
<br/>
The problem with &quot;consistent&quot; math lessons as I see it is that it separates <br/>
math from the rest of the world.  And math exists throughout all other <br/>
things.  <br/>
<br/>
If math is treated as a discreet subject (or if anything else is), then if <br/>
the child decides he doesn&#39;t like math (or whatever it might be), he rejects <br/>
or avoids anything related to that.  If he finds it difficult, he might tell <br/>
himself he&#39;s not good at math.  But if there IS no &quot;math&quot; separate from other <br/>
things, he won&#39;t be able to avoid the world or think he&#39;s not good at <br/>
understanding the world.<br/>
<br/>
Holly knows she&#39;s mathematically minded.  But nobody makes a big deal about <br/>
it.  She enjoys the kinds of puzzles and games that involve patterns and <br/>
numbers.  She enjoys the math in music and in art.  She enjoys the patterns <br/>
in words.  <br/>

And I&#39;m not criticizing it. It&#39;s just a different goal than what unschoolers<br/>
have. If you have different goals than unschoolers, then it won&#39;t make sense<br/>
that we&#39;re giving up that sense of progress and the semi-guarantees of more<br/>
academic styles of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My (new found! ;-) goal is to live today joyfully. If my daughter can<br/>
explore what she enjoys, that will prepare her for doing what she enjoys.<br/>
Just as using English as a 2 yo is the foundation of a 3yos English. But a<br/>
2yo doesn&#39;t need to prepare or practice to speak as a 3yo or a 6yo or 20yo.<br/>
They learn what they need as they need it ... because they need it. :-) Even<br/>
though a 2yo will one day become someone who might need to ask a librarian<br/>
for help finding a book, they don&#39;t need to practice for it. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Life rarely throws us a curve where we need to go from knowing nothing to<br/>
knowing everything tomorrow. *If* kids are allowed to pursue what interests<br/>
them, then they acquire the skills and knowledge they need for those<br/>
interests as they need them.<br/>
<br/>
If, on the other hand, kids are being prepared for tomorrow by getting the<br/>
knowledge they might need one day, it&#39;s much more difficult and takes much<br/>
longer. They end up having spent time on things they never needed.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re certain that it&#39;s in the best interests of kids to acquire a<br/>
particular body of general knowledge because that&#39;s pretty much the only<br/>
thing we know. (It&#39;s what schools do.) But schools were originally set up to<br/>
provide general knowledge *not* because kids need that body of knowledge<br/>
(though most teachers are convinced that they do) but because it&#39;s an<br/>
efficient way to raise the population&#39;s average level of education. It&#39;s a<br/>
factory process concerned not with any one item on the production line but<br/>
on the output as a whole. There will be some tremendous successes. There<br/>
will be some scrap. But what&#39;s important is how it all averages out.<br/>
<br/>
*If* schools were concerned with each individual child, they would provide<br/>
each child with an individualized education focused on that child&#39;s<br/>
strengths and desires and interests.<br/>
<br/>
But they don&#39;t. They can&#39;t. It would be too expensive.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And what I think makes me nervous is...illiteracy, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooled kids learn to read when they are ready and when they need to.<br/>
Usually it&#39;s around the same age as schooled kids 6-8. Sometimes earlier.<br/>
Sometimes later. But by 18 those unschooled kids who learned to read later<br/>
are indistinguishable from those who learned to read earlier. (In school<br/>
naturally-later readers would have been shamed and humiliated -- just by<br/>
having &quot;specialists&quot; focus even kindly on something that they couldn&#39;t do --<br/>
and convinced that they couldn&#39;t read or that reading was dumb.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do unschooled children learn long division? What do they do to<br/>
&gt; practice it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I recognize that the world is full of numbers and opportunities to<br/>
manipulate those numbers. My daughter is figuring out how numbers work<br/>
because she wants the information manipulating the numbers will give her.<br/>
<br/>
By using math in real life she understands the context and can see why she<br/>
needs to do something. On a math paper 34-17 doesn&#39;t mean anything. It<br/>
doesn&#39;t have any affect on her life if she gets it right or wrong. (Which is<br/>
why schools need to impose artificial consequences on getting things right<br/>
and wrong.) But in real life, her purpose might be to figure out if she has<br/>
enough for 2 toys. So she might subtract the price of one toy from what she<br/>
has or she might add the prices of the two toys together. She *wants* the<br/>
information and has a stake in extracting what she needs from it. How she<br/>
goes about it isn&#39;t important. What&#39;s important is gaining enough<br/>
understanding of why she&#39;s doing what she&#39;s doing. And the understanding is<br/>
pretty much built in to the problem because it&#39;s a problem in real life. She<br/>
won&#39;t make the mistake of subtracting the price of one toy from the other.<br/>
She won&#39;t add the price of one toy to how much she has. It wouldn&#39;t make<br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
But in school style math where the numbers are taken out of context, there<br/>
isn&#39;t that feedback that the process you&#39;re using doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>
Sometimes you add. Sometimes you subtract. The only difference is in what<br/>
you&#39;re told to do.<br/>
<br/>
School-style learning (in math programs) focuses on the mechanics of<br/>
manipulating numbers. The designers hope that by doing enough kids will<br/>
understand, but the goal is on getting them to be able to perform the<br/>
operations. If they do happen to understand why they&#39;d doing something<br/>
that&#39;s a potential side effect not the goal.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *really* hard to explain! It *does* work. But the process doesn&#39;t look<br/>
at all like school-style math learning.<br/>
<br/>
Learning math from life is the way your children learned English. It was a<br/>
useful tool to get what they needed so they got better at it as a side<br/>
effect. And that worked pretty well!<br/>
<br/>
Learning math school style is the way children learn (or don&#39;t learn!) a<br/>
foreign language in school. It&#39;s memorization without needing something.<br/>
It&#39;s needing something for a right now purpose that provides the opportunity<br/>
to understand. And that&#39;s what&#39;s lacking in school style learning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What about algebra and other higher mathematics? I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; reading a lot about the practical uses of what we learn, and I agree<br/>
&gt; wholeheartedly BUT...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; the brain work that goes into learning and<br/>
&gt; knowing how to do abstract number exercises like algebra, increases<br/>
&gt; the ability of the brain to think about ANY subject. It&#39;s GOOD for<br/>
&gt; the brain to &quot;workout&quot; by doing abstract stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But is it the algebra that is a good workout or are people who are naturally<br/>
good at algebraic thinking able to *get* a good work out from it?<br/>
<br/>
Running is a good exercise. But is it the running that&#39;s good or having the<br/>
capacity (or potential capacity) to use you legs and lungs in that way to<br/>
get the benefit from running that&#39;s good. Someone on crutches can&#39;t get much<br/>
out of running.<br/>
<br/>
Algebra is good if a child *wants* that type of brain exercise or enjoys<br/>
that type of accomplishment (even if they find it difficult). It exercises<br/>
something the child finds natural to exercise.<br/>
<br/>
But if it isn&#39;t natural, it&#39;s like trying to exercise a body part that<br/>
doesn&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a word for that type of study but I&#39;ve forgotten what it is.<br/>
Researchers will look for a positive result and then try to find the factors<br/>
that are different between that and the negative result. Like why does this<br/>
group of people have unclogged arteries and this group of people have<br/>
clogged arteries.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a useful process but it does have it&#39;s flaws. It tends to focus on what<br/>
the factors are rather than why that those factors might be common to that<br/>
group. Are Mediterraneans healthier because they use a lot of olive oil or<br/>
because their bodies process fat differently?<br/>
<br/>
So is it algebra that is the benefit or is it having the ability to use<br/>
algebra *and* having access to algebra that is the benefit?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And so, how would an<br/>
&gt; unschooling family get algebra across to the kids?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is algebraic thinking in life. The *thinking* part is the most<br/>
important in understanding. It&#39;s using algebra and understanding why you&#39;re<br/>
doing what you&#39;re doing. And when a problem is in context, the what and why<br/>
are pretty obvious.<br/>
<br/>
When we were flying from Boston to LA we stopped in Pittsburgh. It took us<br/>
an hour by plane. It takes us 11 hours by car. We had 5 more hours to get to<br/>
California. Kathryn, who was 10 at the time, said &quot;Do you know how long it<br/>
would take to drive to California? It would take 66 hours.&quot; *That&#39;s*<br/>
algebraic thinking. (Which someone neatly described as using what you know<br/>
to figure out what you don&#39;t know.) The context of the problem supplied the<br/>
sense of how the numbers needed to be manipulated. Her curiosity supplied<br/>
the desire to manipulate them.<br/>
<br/>
Once there&#39;s understanding, doing it more formally is a loads easier if the<br/>
need is there. Trying to do it formally without understanding it is very<br/>
very difficult. Which is why it take *years* for schools to teach kids math.<br/>
(And schools often fail!)<br/>
<br/>
There are unschooled kids who have needed formal math for college who have<br/>
learned high school math in 6-9 months. The need was there. The background<br/>
of having used math in context was there. That made the formal part much<br/>
easier.<br/>
<br/>
When kids know that whether they know something is their choice, then<br/>
acquiring it is a lot easier. It&#39;s also easier if they don&#39;t have years of<br/>
experience with learning it being difficult. It&#39;s just something they want<br/>
to learn, or are required to learn to get to something they want to learn,<br/>
so they learn it. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I &quot;make&quot; my kids do their math...lying in a puddle of sunshine on the<br/>
&gt; front room floor, wrap-ups in the recliner, Math Minute drills, etc.<br/>
&gt; Right now, the two younger ones are playing dominos...MATH! but would<br/>
&gt; unschooling REALLY say not to give them seat work to practice their<br/>
&gt; basic number skills, and on a consistent basis? If I waited for them<br/>
&gt; to come to me asking how to divide...well, I sure wouldn&#39;t hold my<br/>
&gt; breath!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I assume by putting quotes around &quot;make&quot; you mean you don&#39;t need to hold<br/>
them down and force them. But ultimately they don&#39;t have a choice not to do<br/>
math in some way.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a pretty picture you paint. It might be similar to if your husband<br/>
loved to watch you snuggling with a baby in a rocker in the sunshine and<br/>
decided *that* was a good reason to have another baby: so he could delight<br/>
in the image that brought him joy. And the cost to you wouldn&#39;t be part of<br/>
his equation.<br/>
<br/>
If you didn¹t make them would they be doing it on their own? Even if it<br/>
looks peacefully satisfying, if the kids don&#39;t have a choice, then the<br/>
outward look isn&#39;t nearly as pretty on the inside. They&#39;re just making do<br/>
with what they are permitted to have.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying you need to change. I&#39;m just describing the difference. If<br/>
what you&#39;re doing works fine, there&#39;s no impetus to try out something that<br/>
will probably not feel very satisfying to get to what we feel is a better<br/>
place. You need to want to get to that place we feel is better in order for<br/>
for the changes you&#39;ll need to make to feel worth it.<br/>

Thanks for the reply. In fact, your story about Kirby teaching how to <br/>
multiply by 18 was one of the things my hubby and I talked about last <br/>
night. I think it&#39;s on the Unschooling.com page.<br/>
<br/>
YOu know what I&#39;m thinking about? My own son, Robby, when he was <br/>
three, and we were traveling down the road together, and he said from <br/>
his car seat &quot;If Jason was here, there would be six in the car. And <br/>
if Daddy got out, then there would be five again.&quot; and we had math <br/>
right then and there. He had never so much as written a number on <br/>
paper, but he knew. <br/>
<br/>
He still does this kind of thing, as in your example of the length of <br/>
videos...L &quot;There&#39;s 104 minutes on the tape. How many hours is it?&quot; <br/>
(This is Robby, not me, initiating) and I&#39;ll sit there pondering and <br/>
trying to do the division...and he comes up with the answer. &quot;An hour <br/>
and 44 minutes&quot; and I&#39;m all &quot;It&#39;s a little less than two hours&quot; LOL<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, he does it in his schoolwork division, too and makes me nuts, <br/>
leaving out steps left and right, because he&#39;s coming up with the <br/>
answers in his head.<br/>
<br/>
wow. Has this ever given me pause. <br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;If I waited for them to come to me asking how to divide...well, I <br/>
sure <br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t hold my <br/>
&gt; breath!&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mine all know how to divide.  They might not know how to set it up <br/>
to look <br/>
&gt; like traditional school divisor-format long division, but they <br/>
divide things <br/>
&gt; in their heads I can&#39;t (I have to get the pencil and paper) and <br/>
having <br/>
&gt; developed their own methods for figuring stuff out, they understand <br/>
&gt; mathematical thinking whereas most schoolkids only know how to do <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; calcuations on a &quot;problem&quot; which is actually the solution to an <br/>
unnamed <br/>
&gt; problem, without the calculations having been done.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ten minutes ago, before I came in here, Holly and I were figuring <br/>
out how <br/>
&gt; long a video tape was which included two 112 minute shows.  It took <br/>
&gt; multiplication and division by 60 and she was right there and <br/>
double checked <br/>
&gt; me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s hard to explain all at once how they&#39;ve learned to do what <br/>
they can do. <br/>
&gt; I wish I had collected all my reports of specific instances.  Did <br/>
anyone keep <br/>
&gt; or remember where I might find the one about Kirby teaching an <br/>
adult to <br/>
&gt; multiply by 18?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The problem with &quot;consistent&quot; math lessons as I see it is that it <br/>
separates <br/>
&gt; math from the rest of the world.  And math exists throughout all <br/>
other <br/>
&gt; things.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If math is treated as a discreet subject (or if anything else is), <br/>
then if <br/>
&gt; the child decides he doesn&#39;t like math (or whatever it might be), <br/>
he rejects <br/>
&gt; or avoids anything related to that.  If he finds it difficult, he <br/>
might tell <br/>
&gt; himself he&#39;s not good at math.  But if there IS no &quot;math&quot; separate <br/>
from other <br/>
&gt; things, he won&#39;t be able to avoid the world or think he&#39;s not good <br/>
at <br/>
&gt; understanding the world.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Holly knows she&#39;s mathematically minded.  But nobody makes a big <br/>
deal about <br/>
&gt; it.  She enjoys the kinds of puzzles and games that involve <br/>
patterns and <br/>
&gt; numbers.  She enjoys the math in music and in art.  She enjoys the <br/>
patterns <br/>
&gt; in words.  <br/>

thanks. Good reply. I appreciate it.<br/>

<br/>
I understand that you don&#39;t mean to criticize, and I understand <br/>
better what was meant by &quot;looking like school&quot;... kids flopping on <br/>
the floor to do their math might not look like school, but it&#39;s <br/>
getting school results. But it still isn&#39;t something I would say I&#39;m <br/>
nervous about. I&#39;ve had to defend our decision not to start Katie <br/>
until she was eight, many times. It matters not one whit to me that <br/>
she&#39;s &quot;behind grade level.&quot; She wasn&#39;t ready for formal <br/>
learning...but now this unschooling thing is telling me formal <br/>
learning isn&#39;t the way kids learn best, anyway. sheesh. see how ya <br/>
are? ;)<br/>
<br/>
*If* kids are allowed to pursue what interests<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; them, then they acquire the skills and knowledge they need for those<br/>
&gt; interests as they need them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah! and herein lies the rub! *If* Robby pursues only what interests <br/>
him, he will be going from video to computer game, and back again to <br/>
the TV. Maybe I&#39;m not getting it, but surely an hour doing division <br/>
at the kitchen table is stretching his brain better than shooting <br/>
down asteroids on the computer for an hour? <br/>
<br/>
Now that I&#39;ve said that, I&#39;m thinking about my 15 year old daughter. <br/>
She is a voracious and very good reader. Better at reading than I am, <br/>
and I&#39;m a GOOD reader. Because I am a Tolkien fan, I introduced The <br/>
Hobbit to her when she was seven. She ate it up. At age 10, she read <br/>
Lord of the Rings. She read it again. She immersed herself in Middle <br/>
Earth, checking out books of artwork by various artists, writing <br/>
about the strengths and weaknesses in the different characters of the <br/>
book, and of course, spent lots of time online chatting with other <br/>
Tolkien people, and looking forward mightily to the release of the <br/>
movie. I let her &quot;pursue her interest&quot;...and she followed it into <br/>
Medieval Europe, and British History. She knows who William the <br/>
Conqueror was, who was King in Britain when he landed. She knows what <br/>
the people were called who lived in England before the Saxons came. <br/>
She knows all about Arthur and Gueneviere and Camelot. She has read <br/>
all of Shakespeare&#39;s comedies, and is right now reading through <br/>
Canterbury Tales...again. She walks around speaking in different <br/>
English accents: Scottish, Irish, Australian, Cockney, Liverpool. A <br/>
true Anglophile, and it started at age 7, with The Hobbit.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Does that description sound like unschooling? I didn&#39;t <br/>
interfere with this in any way, besides once in awhile reading a book <br/>
she brought home, so we could discuss it.<br/>
<br/>
We started her in an official correspondence high school (Christian <br/>
Liberty Academy) because at the end of last year she informed us she <br/>
wanted more structure and more official assignments to tackle. And <br/>
she does get the assignments done, but she curls up comfy and just <br/>
reads for pleasure...her history book! <br/>
<br/>
The difference in this house is, Abbie is verbal. She loves reading <br/>
and writing (and talking!) and this pursuit of Middle Earth, and <br/>
things English is verbally founded. My younger ones aren&#39;t proving to <br/>
be so verbally oriented. They do love their &quot;screen time&quot; though! <br/>
Movies, computer games, movies again. Seems mindless to me. I&#39;d have <br/>
a really tough time just letting them go, the way I did Abbie, <br/>
because I don&#39;t think that they would follow pursuits that teach them <br/>
anything. <br/>
<br/>
*whimper*<br/>
<br/>
This has turned out way long. Sorry. I&#39;m more thinking aloud than <br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;*If* schools were concerned with each individual child, they would <br/>
&gt;provide each child with an individualized education focused on that <br/>
&gt;child&#39;s strengths and desires and interests.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Provide each child with individualized education...okay, I must be <br/>
completely misunderstanding. Isn&#39;t unschooling about NOT &quot;providing <br/>
an education&quot; but simply allowing kids their head, letting them go <br/>
where they will? Where does guidance and provision come into play?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; And what I think makes me nervous is...illiteracy, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I meant by illiteracy is an overall inability to do basic skills <br/>
needed to have a life. Robby&#39;s not telling time, for instance. I <br/>
really want him to know analog time...and he gets the general idea of <br/>
it, but has to rely on digital clocks to know what time it is. I hate <br/>
that. As for reading, Abbie was reading at age 5, after one official <br/>
lesson. Robby had about a week of phonics, and then took off reading <br/>
at age 7. Katie isn&#39;t there yet, though we have been doing phonics <br/>
this year, and she&#39;s 8 and a half. I&#39;m confident it will come in <br/>
time, but it really is like holding my breath, like the one article <br/>
where a son didn&#39;t read until age 14! ack!  And I thank God every <br/>
day, when we&#39;re looking at books, and she&#39;s sounding out words and <br/>
stuff, that she&#39;s at home. The damage the schools would have done, <br/>
putting her in special classes...ugh. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooled kids learn to read when they are ready and when they <br/>

and I did too, in 4th and 5th grade. As an adult, I know all the <br/>
times tables through 12, no problem. The goal for my teachers in <br/>
fourth and fifth grades was to have students who knew their times <br/>
tables. I never did get it beyond 4&#39;s...and now I know them all, <br/>
having gotten back into it for teaching my kids math. Is it because <br/>
my brain wasn&#39;t ready at age 10, but it was at age 35? Hmmm.<br/>

But you are concerned about Robbie not being able to use an analog clock.<br/>

What if it goes on? At what point would you step in and say you&#39;ve *got* to<br/>

<br/>
Of course it&#39;s not that unschoolers don&#39;t worry about the same things! No<br/>
matter how confident you are, when later learning hits home, you *worry*!<br/>
Saying not to worry was good in theory, but when it&#39;s you&#39;re own kid! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And lots of list time is dealing with those doubts. But then people will<br/>
tell how their kids couldn&#39;t read analog clocks until they got a job and had<br/>
to know what time to get ready for lunch ;-) when they had a *reason* for<br/>
knowing! (My daughter can sometimes figure it out and she&#39;s 11.) Or, as you<br/>
found at Sandra&#39;s site but better, real live people who are right here will<br/>
tell you about their son not reading until 13 and so on.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, that *is* unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
But the true test is being able to trust that process when it doesn&#39;t look<br/>
like it&#39;s leading to something that kids might learn in school.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s being able to trust that video games and TV also have value. (It helps<br/>
to play the games with them. Games *are* math. The strategy necessary is a<br/>
much higher order of mathematical thinking than school or math program can<br/>
provide. It&#39;s on the order of chess. And we all &quot;know&quot; how good chess is for<br/>
thinking :-)<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has a great section on her website about video games:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
It *is* uncomfortable to watch my daughter watch TV. But I&#39;ve come to<br/>
recognize that it comes when she&#39;s in between ideas for her drawings and<br/>
writings. It might be down time as the brain runs in the back ground for<br/>
inspiration or waiting for someting that does inspire her. Or both. Or<br/>
something else. I&#39;ve just gain confidence that she there are things she<br/>
loves doing besides watching TV.<br/>
<br/>
And if there weren&#39;t, I think I remember Steven Spielberg mentioning how<br/>
much he *loved* TV as a kid! There&#39;s a reason kids are drawn to what they&#39;re<br/>
drawn to.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: Hi...testing the waters...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; How do unschooled children learn long division? What do they do to<br/>
&gt; practice it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do unschooled children need &quot;long division&quot; for?  And could someone<br/>
please explain to me what long division actually is, and is there such a<br/>
thing as short division?<br/>
<br/>
I know how to divide. Do I use &quot;long division&quot;?  Beats me.  Quite possibly<br/>
not, since my elementary school experience was at a &quot;free school&quot; where we<br/>
didn&#39;t have the usual types of &quot;subjects&quot; that most elementary schols have.<br/>
I didn&#39;t take a math class until I was 10 and decided to listen in on a<br/>
group of kids learning algebra.  (Which I immediately LOVED, and have ever<br/>
since!)<br/>
<br/>
My point is that it&#39;s important to understand the concept of division, but<br/>
HOW you do that is not so important.  There are several different ways.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to say the next bit in all-caps not because I&#39;m yelling at you,<br/>
but because I really, really mean it and I think it&#39;s critically important<br/>
and most people have no idea.<br/>
<br/>
I HATE THE WAY SCHOOLS TEACH MATH BECAUSE IT TAKES ALL THE MEANING, JOY AND<br/>
BEAUTY OUT OF IT!!!<br/>
<br/>
People do NOT need to learn math the way it is taught in schools.  In fact,<br/>
they don&#39;t need to &quot;learn math&quot; at all.  Math is INSEPERABLE from most<br/>
everything else in life, and if you live a full life, you&#39;ll learn all the<br/>
math you need because you need it.  It&#39;s there.  It&#39;s part of everything.<br/>
You couldn&#39;t escape it if you tried really hard.<br/>
<br/>
SOME people will love it and get interested and want to pursue things to a<br/>
deeper level and learn more advanced math and do all sorts of cool things<br/>
with it.  MOST won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
If you try to force school math on kids early on, and turn them off the<br/>
subject- a VERY common thing that happens because most adults are so<br/>
terrified of math because of their own awful school math experiences- they<br/>
will likely develop an aversion, and at any rate, they are extremely<br/>
unlikely to remember what they&#39;ve &quot;learned&quot; anyway.<br/>
<br/>
How much of the algebra you were taught in school do you remember and use?<br/>
I&#39;m serious.  What do you still use?  What turned out to be irrelevant?<br/>
What could you easily look up and re-learn if you needed to?  How likely<br/>
are you to need to do that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What about algebra and other higher mathematics?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, I don&#39;t think algebra is &quot;higher math&quot; but I&#39;ll let that go.  I<br/>
think it&#39;s mind-candy.<br/>
<br/>
But what about higher math?<br/>
<br/>
Who needs it?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a real question.  What kind of people use higher math?  What do they<br/>
use it for?  When and how did they learn it?  You might want to find some<br/>
and ask them.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve found is this:  most people who use higher math learned some in<br/>
school, because that&#39;s where they were.  But MOSTLY, they learned it<br/>
through using it as they needed it.  Like on-the-job training.  They took<br/>
it further than school does because it actually interested them.  They had<br/>
a use for it.<br/>
<br/>
I remember the day I realized that calculus had a purpose.  I was stunned!<br/>
Why didn&#39;t they ever tell us this in high school?  I had a rocky<br/>
relationship with calculus in high school (along with a rocky relationship<br/>
with just about everything, as most teens have!) but once I settled on a<br/>
career path where I NEEDED it, it was suddenly easy and made sense and I<br/>
relearned it all in a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
If I had not had that career path, I never would have looked at calculus again.<br/>
<br/>
I no longer have that career, and calculus is unlikely to be part of my<br/>
everyday life (although you never know) so I no longer use it and have<br/>
forgotten most of it.  Big deal.  (Now, I use a lot more geometry.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m reading a lot about the practical uses of what we learn, and I agree<br/>
&gt; wholeheartedly BUT...the brain work that goes into learning and<br/>
&gt; knowing how to do abstract number exercises like algebra, increases<br/>
&gt; the ability of the brain to think about ANY subject.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YES!!!  It does!<br/>
<br/>
But it works the other way around, too.  Learning abstract thinking any<br/>
other way will make it easier to learn algebra, should you need to do so.<br/>
Algebra isn&#39;t the only way to learn it.  Just a fun one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s GOOD for<br/>
&gt; the brain to &quot;workout&quot; by doing abstract stuff. And so, how would an<br/>
&gt; unschooling family get algebra across to the kids? Or long division,<br/>
&gt; for that matter? LOL<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, to start with, we don&#39;t do &quot;math&quot; at all here.  It isn&#39;t a separate<br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
But we use it all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Like this:<br/>
<br/>
Suppose your Dad is coming in the morning to pick you up at 10:00am.<br/>
You need about an hour in the morning to get up and shower and eat<br/>
breakfast, to be ready to go.<br/>
You need about 8 or 9 hours of sleep.<br/>
What time do you need to get to bed by?<br/>
<br/>
(The cool thing about that particular need is that it includes using<br/>
base-12 math as well as base-10)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My current favorite real-life mathematical figuring here:<br/>
<br/>
We have a mini-van.<br/>
With all the seats in, it holds 7 people, and has a cargo space for two<br/>
bags of fencing equipment.<br/>
We have 4 people, and need cargo space for about three times what fits in<br/>
the back.  Without the space, we had to shift bags of equipment in and out<br/>
of the car on a daily- or even twice daily- basis, to have what we needed<br/>
when and where we needed it.<br/>
<br/>
I never made the shift from being 5 people to being 4 people, at least not<br/>
in a practical way.<br/>
One of my kids did.<br/>
He suggested one day that instead of shifting gear around and having to<br/>
move it in and out of the car all the time, why not take the back seat out,<br/>
have seating for 4, and then keep all the gear in the car permanently.  Not<br/>
only that, but it could be organized so we wouldn&#39;t even have to shift it<br/>
around for any particular class, each thing could be reached individually.<br/>
<br/>
He redesigned the layout of everything in the car.<br/>
<br/>
We changed it.<br/>
<br/>
A simple change that required a large conceptual leap-which he made, but<br/>
the rest of us had not- and now, life is much simpler.<br/>
<br/>
To really understand this and the effect it had, you should know that I<br/>
teach fencing, 6 classes per week, plus I give individual lessons.  Four<br/>
different locations for the classes.  Several different locations for the<br/>
lessons.  Different groups of people at each class, with different<br/>
equipment needs.  And all three kids fence, but they don&#39;t attend the same<br/>
classes.  I have equipment in the car for about 30 people, plus a variety<br/>
of training equipment and record keeping stuff.  We were really having an<br/>
issue with having the right gear in the car.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Algebra is the art of taking the information you have, the things you know,<br/>
and using that to figure out the information you don&#39;t have, that you need<br/>
to know.  It&#39;s a puzzle.  That&#39;s all.  You &quot;expose&quot; kids to it by doing it,<br/>
by playing with it freely and uninhibitedly.  By finding things fascinating<br/>
and wanting to figure out what you don&#39;t know.  By experimenting.  By<br/>
needing it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I &quot;make&quot; my kids do their math...lying in a puddle of sunshine on the<br/>
&gt; front room floor, wrap-ups in the recliner, Math Minute drills, etc.<br/>
&gt; Right now, the two younger ones are playing dominos...MATH!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s playing dominoes.  Why not let it be that?<br/>
<br/>
Why separate math out of everything all the time?  Why do people do that?<br/>
<br/>
The way to learn math naturally is to let it be a natural part of<br/>
everything, like it is, and not make such a point of it all the time.<br/>
<br/>
For example, what if, in writing and speaking, you had to stop and make a<br/>
point of every time you used the letter &quot;e&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Look, I&#39;m writing an e-mail...  USING THE LETTER E!<br/>
<br/>
How ridiculous is that?<br/>
<br/>
Yet people do it to math all the time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  but would<br/>
&gt; unschooling REALLY say not to give them seat work to practice their<br/>
&gt; basic number skills, and on a consistent basis?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say it, but I also would NEVER do it.  SEATWORK?!???<br/>
What on earth for?!?<br/>
<br/>
And who came up with a term like that anyway?  I find the very concept<br/>
nauseating, I really do.  Sit here and do this.  Whether you like it or<br/>
not.  Whether you have any use for it or not.  Stay in your seat, do your<br/>
seatwork.  YUCK.<br/>
<br/>
This does not mean that we don&#39;t have a zillion math books around here,<br/>
including workbooks and such. We do. I probably have more math books than<br/>
most schools do.  But it&#39;s because I enjoy them.  I NEVER make or even ask<br/>
my kids to have anything to do with them.  It&#39;s my special interest, not<br/>
theirs.  Once in a while, they&#39;ll pick one up, look through it, put it back<br/>
down.  Sometimes, they&#39;ll use computer software that has math games on it-<br/>
more so when they were very young, not so much now.  But I have never and<br/>
will never require it.<br/>
<br/>
I will, however, discuss with them when I&#39;m working on trigonometry for<br/>
fun.  It&#39;s interesting to me, and they might also think it is. So far, mild<br/>
interest, no real excitement.  That&#39;s fine.  They know it&#39;s here.  And they<br/>
know something about what it&#39;s for. They can ask if they need to.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The best thing for my kids having to do with math is that I love it, and<br/>
they know it.  No math anxiety here. (Except for when my daughter had an<br/>
issue with girls in her scout troop telling her she&#39;s not learning anything<br/>
because she&#39;s homeschooled, and she came home wanting to &quot;do math&quot; and we<br/>
had a little talk about that.)<br/>
<br/>
People learn best by having resources available, and interesting things to do.<br/>
<br/>
Learning is interest-driven.  Joy-driven.  Need-driven.<br/>
<br/>
But please don&#39;t make it a command performance.  ESPECIALLY with math,<br/>
which is already handicapped by a national phobia about it.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing you can do for your kids with math is to learn to love it<br/>
yourself.  Play with it.  REALLY learn it.  Not just how to calculate, but<br/>
why it works that way.  Why does borrowing work?  Why does carrying work?<br/>
What is the real meaning of &quot;place value&quot; and why?  Why do we use base-10<br/>
math.  Learn some other system.  Learn to multiply in binary.  Play with<br/>
numbers. Play with shapes.  Why are &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot; called that? Is it<br/>
important?  How many math words do you know? How many math words do you use<br/>
every day? (Count them!  Make a list!)  How much math is there in your life<br/>
that you are so comfortable with you&#39;re not aware of it?<br/>
<br/>
And my very favorite math question:<br/>
<br/>
How, exactly, do you know when it&#39;s safe to cross the street?<br/>
<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Play with patterns.  Play with sets.  Go outside and throw rocks and pay<br/>
attention to the paths they travel.  Drop stones into a pond and watch the<br/>
ripples.  Figure out why buildings don&#39;t fall down- or why they do.  Ponder<br/>
why the wind off Lake Michigan travels through the city of Chicago the way<br/>
it does.  And Oklahoma, where the wind comes sweeping down the plains...<br/>
what&#39;s different in very windy places?  How do you need to change things to<br/>
accomodate that?  Or other weather?  Why are most of the roofs in places<br/>
that get a lot of snow not flat?<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on and on and on.  You can, too.<br/>
<br/>
Question everything.  Figure some of it out.  Don&#39;t worry about whether you<br/>
are learning math or not. You are.  It&#39;s there. It&#39;s ALWAYS there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I waited for them<br/>
&gt; to come to me asking how to divide...well, I sure wouldn&#39;t hold my<br/>
&gt; breath!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would they not ask you?<br/>
<br/>
If they needed to divide and couldn&#39;t figure it out, they woudn&#39;t ask for help?<br/>
<br/>
Or is it that you believe they&#39;d never need to?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, we buy a box of popsicles.  In our family, treats like that are<br/>
portioned out by shares, so each kid gets a fair share.  They&#39;re into this.<br/>
But the youngest used to have to ask me how to figure out what her share<br/>
was.  She very specifically DID come to me and ask me to help her figure it<br/>
out- to learn how to divide.<br/>
<br/>
Then she thought it was cool, and figured out shares of practically<br/>
everything in the house.<br/>
<br/>
But NONE of my kids, as far as I know, can do division on paper, using the<br/>
method taught in schools.  They&#39;ve never needed to.  They do it in their<br/>
heads.  They estimate, when that&#39;s good enough for what they need.  They<br/>
use calculators.<br/>
<br/>
And honestly, that&#39;s what almost everyone does in real life when they need<br/>
to divide big numbers anyway, because few people trust their own figuring<br/>
enough to use it without checking.  I used to freak people out when I ran a<br/>
food buying club and did all the invoicing and such by hand, no calculator.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
I *almost* mentioned your name in conjunction with the tidy description of<br/>
algebra that you provided years ago and I just repeated. But my sentences<br/>
tend to be unwieldy at times ;-) and it seemed directed at too few who might<br/>
remember.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295327328">&lt;&lt;&lt;When we were flying from Boston to LA we stopped in Pittsburgh. It took us<br/>
an hour by plane. It takes us 11 hours by car. We had 5 more hours to get to<br/>
California. Kathryn, who was 10 at the time, said &quot;Do you know how long it<br/>
would take to drive to California? It would take 66 hours.&quot; *That&#39;s*<br/>
algebraic thinking. (Which someone neatly described as using what you know<br/>
to figure out what you don&#39;t know.) The context of the problem supplied the<br/>
sense of how the numbers needed to be manipulated. Her curiosity supplied<br/>
the desire to manipulate them.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a real life example of math in our home recently.<br/>
<br/>
My ds9 has decided to start collecting baseball and football cards.  He spent some of his Christmas money he received on a huge box of them and now relatives are starting to give him their old collections of cards.  He probably now has over 600-700 cards.  Some were in a long slender box and he wanted to count them all.  He had counted to about 100 or so and realized that this way would take FOREVER.  The cards were in a small box and I suggested that he measure one small part of the box, count how many were in that section, and then multiply it by how many total sections there were altogether.  He &#39;got it&#39; right away and was very thankful for the tip.  He was trying to figure out how many card protector sheets he would need........one sheet hold 9 cards, one large package of card protectors had 75 sheets ($9.95) vs. a smaller package that had only 10 sheets in it ($1.95), so......this was a very practical (for him) type of multiplication problem.   He also had to budget his remaining money so we had to find the best bargain for his money.   <br/>
<br/>
What I found a little surprising about this situation was that instead of initially using a calculator (which he plays around with a lot) he wanted to figure it in his head, then check it on paper, then check it with the calculator.   He seems to love the problem solving aspect of things and I think using that calculator makes it just too easy for him...............<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;I &quot;make&quot; my kids do their math...lying in a puddle of sunshine on the<br/>
front room floor, wrap-ups in the recliner, Math Minute drills, etc.<br/>
Right now, the two younger ones are playing dominos...MATH! but would<br/>
unschooling REALLY say not to give them seat work to practice their<br/>
basic number skills, and on a consistent basis? If I waited for them<br/>
to come to me asking how to divide...well, I sure wouldn&#39;t hold my<br/>
breath!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well you obviously know that there is math all around us and kids can <br/>
actually do math every day with out being made to. Heck it started with my <br/>
kids and fractions when they were 2 and I would cut their toast. What we <br/>
have to do is trust that they will learn what they need to and want to when <br/>
it&#39;s important for them, and get this, if at all. What makes you think that <br/>
all your kids will want and need to learn algebra to have a great life? I do <br/>
agree that just thinking and learning stimulates the mind, but why does it <br/>
have to be something you think is important when you think it needs to be <br/>
learned? Don&#39;t get this in a snappish way, I&#39;m just asking. I&#39;m not quite as <br/>
knowledgable on how to write gently like Joyce!!<br/>
<br/>
But really, if your child is into frogs and how many kinds there are, the <br/>
whole life cycle, etc. doesn&#39;t that stimulate him just as much if not more <br/>
because he&#39;s learning on his own and really loving it?<br/>
<br/>
I would love for my kids to be into algebra and enjoy it. I loved math in <br/>
high school. I hated history though so would I be disappointed if they <br/>
decided to concentrate on that instead of algebra? Not at all. I can&#39;t say <br/>
what my kids will want to do when they get older. I do know I can&#39;t make <br/>
that call now and neither can my kids. But I do know that whatever their <br/>
interests are, it will lead them further into finding their way and what <br/>
they love and really want to do. That&#39;s for them to decide. And if my <br/>
children are 17 and find that they need higher math for college, I also have <br/>
no doubt that they will go out on their own and do what it takes to get what <br/>
they want. I&#39;ve seen it done with quite a few other unschoolers and I&#39;m <br/>
comfortable in believing my children can do the same.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Joyce<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you read the book, Joyce?  I think you would find it not to be a <br/>
great unschooling book.  It is a good book to get strict school-at-<br/>
homers to relax and not feel guilty about doing fun stuff with their <br/>
kids instead of always doing text books. However, I think it would be <br/>
easy for someone to come away from reading that book thinking that <br/>
what they do is unschooling as long as they *only* make their kids do <br/>
math and language arts every day. A lot of the ideas in the book are <br/>
closer to  relaxed or ecclectic than unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
For example, in the &quot;What is Unschooling&quot; chapter, they have people <br/>
quoted who say what unschooling means to them.  One person said, <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have a definite set of goals in mind for my kids to know/learn <br/>
during their homeschooling.  THey need to be able to read well, write <br/>
well and do math.  Everything else can be pursued to their heart&#39;s <br/>
content.  THey spend days obsessed with a project.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter, there is no hurry...&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
And then the author says, &quot;The common theme is allowing your children <br/>
the freedom to choose, in most cases, what they will learn.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Here are some other interesting quotes from people sharing their <br/>
ideas on unschooling different subjects. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;My favorite language arts idea is having my son dictate a story or <br/>
book to me...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For history, we made a timeline with continuous computer paper (so <br/>
it folds neatly back into a box), with each horizontal page <br/>
representing a century.  As my children read books about different <br/>
time periods or people, they mark an interesting event or date from <br/>
the book onto the timeline in it&#39;s proper place&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then they have essays contributed by Christian &quot;unschoolers&quot;.  In <br/>
introduction, they say, &quot;Another point of contention is the purity of <br/>
unschooling that these families may or may not represent.  Most <br/>
unschoolers have, at one point or another, used a workbook or part of <br/>
a curriculum.  Some occasionally still do.  Sometimes this is because <br/>
of insecurities or doubts that occasionally best us all (even many of <br/>
those who use a curriculum all the time have doubts about their <br/>
choice to homeschool) and sometimes it is because there is something <br/>
very important to us, that we as parents, wanted our children to <br/>
know...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some of the essays were really good but some of them sound like <br/>
they&#39;re describing Charlotte Mason.  Some of them make it sound ok to <br/>
make their kids write.  <br/>
<br/>
Overall, I was disappointed in the book. When I first read it, I was <br/>
just beginning to embrace radical unschooling.  I had already gone <br/>
through the relaxed but you still have to do math stage.  I was <br/>
trying to get past that, and this book didn&#39;t help.  I&#39;m not saying <br/>
that there weren&#39;t some good thingsn about it, but it makes it seem <br/>
like it is really ok to keep making them do math and writing if that <br/>
is how you want to define unschooling.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But you are concerned about Robbie not being able to use an analog clock.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is what we did and the result is a conversation piece in our home.  <br/>
<br/>
Without mentioning a thing to Will about learning to tell time, we made a new <br/>
clock.  I bought 3 cheapo clocks at the discount store (red, white and blue, <br/>
which I knew he&#39;d like).  I took them apart and removed a different hand from <br/>
each of the clocks, leaving an hour hand on one, a minute hand on the next, <br/>
and second hand on the last one.  I then took the face off of one of them and <br/>
scanned it into my computer.  (You don&#39;t have to do that, you could draw it <br/>
on paper.)  In a paint program I eliminated the hours, filled in ticks for <br/>
the minutes/seconds and labelled them (by 5s).  Then I labelled each clock <br/>
face with hours, minutes, seconds.  I basically made 3 new clock faces.  I <br/>
printed them out, cut them out, and then put them in the appropriate clock.<br/>
<br/>
We hung them on the wall where another clock used to be, in the kitchen.  We <br/>
weren&#39;t secretive about it.  Just hung them up there.  When he asked about <br/>
them, we told him what they were.  He ignored them for quite some time.  <br/>
<br/>
We have lots of clocks in our house.  Probably one of every kind in each <br/>
room.  He was always able to read digital clocks and he understood all about <br/>
time.  But I could tell regular clocks confused him.  He understood about <br/>
minutes, but he couldn&#39;t understand why they weren&#39;t labelled on the clocks?  <br/>
The couple of times I tried to explain it to him, it wasn&#39;t easy enough.  (He <br/>
was 6.)  He expressed frustration when I did try and so I backed off.  I knew <br/>
he would figure it out, eventually, but it was frustrating to him, so I <br/>
wanted to help without being pointed about it.<br/>
<br/>
So we hung up the 3-in-1 clock and he ignored them.  But eventually he <br/>
noticed them and looked at them and asked about them.  I never ever explained <br/>
to him how they worked, except to minimally say there are hours, minutes and <br/>
seconds there, just like the clock in the other room.  Then one day he looked <br/>
at it and said, &quot;It&#39;s 11......40!&quot;  Yep.  That&#39;s right.<br/>
<br/>
Those clocks are still in over the table in the new house.  New people come <br/>
in and try to figure out what they are, and look at them and then figure it <br/>
out and ask why.  I use them to tell time now a lot in the kitchen.  I&#39;ll <br/>
look there before I look at the oven, for instance.  I takes some geting used <br/>
to.  Sometimes I get to talk about unschooling because of the clocks and <br/>
sometimes people think we&#39;re clever or just weird.  But I like them.  <br/>
