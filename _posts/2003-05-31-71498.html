All three of my kids have been and I have to say they hardly ever get sick.<br/>
My 11 yr. old has had 1 ear infection. <br/>
My 3 yr. old got sick once at 4 months (right after healthy visit at doc <br/>
office) she had picked up a virus in the office. Since then nothing.<br/>
My youngest is 1 and so far nothing. <br/>
The closest we get is a sniffle and eczema. I know breast feeding made a <br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
My sister who never breastfed her kids has had two with tubes and non stop <br/>
ear infections. He son now has speech issues because he had so many. Her older <br/>
son gets horrible migraines and he oldest daughter has allergies. Hmmm<br/>
<br/>
I had the greatest lactation consultant when I had the last. She would come <br/>
in and assist if you could.  She called after we came home to check on us. The <br/>
support was great. My last two took longer to get the latch (well me too).<br/>
<br/>
My lactation consultant even suggested a foot massage to relax me in the <br/>
hospital.(I had an ileus spelling no clue?) Anyway put right to sleep it was <br/>
great! Awkward at fist but great!<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention the time one gets with baby so close.<br/>

I have to second what Mary said here.  My daughter was bottle fed from<br/>
the hosptial for several reasons, the most important one being that I<br/>
produced almost no milk.  We, of course, didn&#39;t know this right away<br/>
and tried to figure out why she was screaming all the time.  Once she<br/>
was given a bottle, she stopped screaming and went right to sleep. <br/>
Poor thing was getting almost nothing to eat for several days.  :(  I<br/>
(and my husband) was so traumatized by those first few days that I<br/>
wanted to see exactly how much she was eating.<br/>
<br/>
But, back on topic, she is almost never sick.  I think I&#39;ve only taken<br/>
her to the doctor once because she was actually sick (she&#39;s 2).    I&#39;m<br/>
also of the opinion that putting kids in day care increases the<br/>
chances of them getting sick all the time.  My niece (who was breast<br/>
fed) is in day care for 9 to 11 hours a day and she is ALWAYS sick. <br/>
I&#39;ve never seen her without at least a runny nose.  My former SIL<br/>
takes her to the doctor for something or other probably 2 to 3 times a<br/>
month.  Amazing I know but true.  I realize that breast feeding helps<br/>
to keep kids healthy but, there are several other environmental reason<br/>
for why kids are healthy or not.  <br/>
<br/>
Just adding my two cents,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah you may be right. The surroundings may too contribute to the healthiness <br/>
of the child.<br/>
My kids (minus the oldest for a few months) have never been in daycare.<br/>
The worst place we go that almost always sets in the sniffles is CHUCK E. <br/>
CHEESE.  The kids love it but I know when we go someone always gets the sniffles.<br/>
<br/>
I also had forgotten about a friend who has four children. She nursed most of <br/>
them and they are always sick. One has pneumonia right now. They all have <br/>
allergies.  <br/>
Maybe it is just luck.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> I agree that bottle or nursed they would have inherited their Moms allergies <br/>
and immune system issues. That was probably there before they where born. <br/>
<br/>
As far as milk supply (another post) I too had a rough go the first few days <br/>
with my last two. Cassidy was 10 lb. 12 oz and Nicholas was 9 lb. 11 oz. I <br/>
almost gave up. I was worried I was starving them and I had major stomach pains <br/>
(C-section landed me with an ileus sp both times) and ended up having my stay <br/>
extended by 3 days with each of them.  That stay helped so much with the <br/>
nursing.  Cassidy lost a few pounds but they said she prob. contained lots of <br/>
fluids. She is now 75% percentile has been all along. Nicholas lost maybe a pound <br/>
and is also around the 70%.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to nurse, so before I choose a doctor I also looked in to the <br/>
hospital that I thought would support that and that also had lactation consultants <br/>
on staff.<br/>
<br/>
It is a personal choice and some may not be able to or want to nurse.  My <br/>
family didn&#39;t think I would ever have kids let alone NURSE too.  Totally made <br/>
them uncomfortable. They saw me always being a tomboy and couldn&#39;t get past it.<br/>

At the same time, I want to say that it&#39;s not the only reason one should<br/>
consider breastfeeding. There are so many benefits that go along with it<br/>
aside from genetics and luck with the kids getting sick. My first was hardly<br/>
breastfed, the next 2 just a bit more and the last one I was willing to go<br/>
as long as she wanted. My last experience was the best as far as what it did<br/>
for us both. I was very sad when she decided to wean herself. If it&#39;s one<br/>
thing I could take back, it would be to not have given up when things got<br/>
tough with nursing my other 3. I wish I would have known better then.<br/>

<br/>
Mine are really never sick either, but about one cold per year. 8, 5, & 2, <br/>
not one ear infection, or anything else kids seem to get a lot. Just, at the <br/>
most, one cold per year. (Like this just past winter, nobody really got sick. <br/>
There was once or twice, where *we* -someone in the family- woke up feeling a <br/>
little sick, then it went away before taking hold on anyone.) I don&#39;t attribute <br/>
the breastfeeding of all of them necessarily to not catching colds, we all take <br/>
a multi-vitamin everyday, and that probably helps things too. No ear <br/>
infections, no allergies of any kind, etc, is what I think is directly related to the <br/>
breastfeeding. I was breastfeed until I weaned myself, very healthy kid and <br/>
adult, and still not ever allergic to a thing. My husband was adopted (therefore <br/>
not breastfed), and though he grew like a weed (he&#39;s 6&#39; 5&#39;&#39;), he&#39;s allergic <br/>
to many things, including allergies bad, and has been his whole life. He has <br/>
some pitiful child stories! His sister (also adopted, no blood relation) is <br/>
allergic to even more things then dh. She&#39;s allergic to most meds, even the ones <br/>
people take who are allergic to other meds. When she gets sick, which is often, <br/>
and always has been, the Drs. get nervous! (Now, I certainly don&#39;t mean there <br/>
are not breastfeeding=healthy exceptions, going either way, obviously there <br/>
are! AND the duration of breastfeeding plays a huge part too, as do other life <br/>
style factors!) Anyway, breastfeeding does make you healthier and I mean a <br/>
****life-long**** healthier - not just babies/kids.  They&#39;ve proven it, and <br/>
besides that, it really only makes perfect sense anyway.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not to mention that if you do end up with a kid who is sick more often or<br/>
has allergies, breastmilk can often be a lifesaver. My son went through a<br/>
terrible time with allergies when he was 4. I will always be grateful that<br/>
he was still nursing because there were times when there were so few foods<br/>
he could eat that we knew were safe, at least I knew he was getting great<br/>
nutrition through the breastmilk (and since I also had a younger nursling,<br/>
it was still plentiful at that age). Of course, it also meant that I had to<br/>
go on the same food-avoidance diet that he was on until we got his allergies<br/>
figured out, but that&#39;s a small sacrifice for some great peace of mind.<br/>
I also have to wonder if his allergies, which sent us to the ER a couple of<br/>
times, would&#39;ve been more severe, and thus even more life-threatening, if he<br/>
didn&#39;t have several years of nursing beneath his belt.<br/>
One reason I hope my 3 y.o. doesn&#39;t wean any time soon is that there&#39;s some<br/>
pretty scary illnesses out there in the world. With something like West Nile<br/>
virus or SARS that have the potential to be deadly, maybe the fact that a<br/>
child was still nursing could make the difference between life and death.<br/>
I&#39;ll never forget a woman on an email list whose child got E.Coli. She<br/>
nursed him all the way through it, and it made a huge impact on how he made<br/>
it through the course of the disease, esp. as that&#39;s another one that can<br/>
easily kill small kids and toddlers.<br/>
You just can&#39;t go wrong with breastmilk, IMHO. Great stuff, and if you run<br/>
out of creamer for your coffee, you&#39;ve always got a source handy  ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep. My first child was breastfeed a few short weeks, had enough ear <br/>
infections that we ended up doing tubes....I started smoking again <br/>
when I weaned her. <br/>
<br/>
My second, seven long years later, was going to be different! <br/>
Breastmilk is the white gold, miracle substance! She was full-term, <br/>
healthy birthweight, exclusively breastfed, never in daycare, and <br/>
when she gets sick, she gets it bad. She was in the hospital for two <br/>
days at six months old with a lung infection (from RSV that is <br/>
supposed to be risky for preemies and small birthweight babies) on <br/>
breathing treatments, and had her on breathing treatments at home for <br/>
a week. She had another trip a few months later, a simple virus <br/>
caused her breathing trouble. <br/>
<br/>
Just last year she was taken via ambulance after frantic 911 calls <br/>
after she had febrile seizures, on two separate occasions. The first <br/>
time I didn&#39;t know what it was, and thought she was dying, she turned <br/>
stiff and blue and unresponsive. Another seizure brought on by sudden <br/>
fever less than two months later.<br/>
<br/>
This past winter she had pneumonia. It makes me cry just typing about <br/>
it, how fragile she seems. She was breastfed until almost three, <br/>
child led weaned. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ang, catching up on old posts and she is stuck at the puter with a <br/>
bad twisted ankle</div>

  &gt; I also had forgotten about a friend who has four children. She <br/>
  nursed most of <br/>
  &gt; them and they are always sick. One has pneumonia right now. They <br/>
  all have <br/>
  &gt; allergies.  <br/>
  &gt; Maybe it is just luck.<br/>

  Yep. My first child was breastfeed a few short weeks, had enough ear <br/>
  infections that we ended up doing tubes....I started smoking again <br/>
  when I weaned her. <br/>
<br/>
  My second, seven long years later, was going to be different! <br/>
  Breastmilk is the white gold, miracle substance! She was full-term, <br/>
  healthy birthweight, exclusively breastfed, never in daycare, and <br/>
  when she gets sick, she gets it bad. She was in the hospital for two <br/>
  days at six months old with a lung infection (from RSV that is <br/>
  supposed to be risky for preemies and small birthweight babies) on <br/>
  breathing treatments, and had her on breathing treatments at home for <br/>
  a week. She had another trip a few months later, a simple virus <br/>
  caused her breathing trouble. <br/>
<br/>
  Just last year she was taken via ambulance after frantic 911 calls <br/>
  after she had febrile seizures, on two separate occasions. The first <br/>
  time I didn&#39;t know what it was, and thought she was dying, she turned <br/>
  stiff and blue and unresponsive. Another seizure brought on by sudden <br/>
  fever less than two months later.<br/>
<br/>
  This past winter she had pneumonia. It makes me cry just typing about <br/>
  it, how fragile she seems. She was breastfed until almost three, <br/>
  child led weaned. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Ang, catching up on old posts and she is stuck at the puter with a <br/>
  bad twisted ankle <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, that would be great! It&#39;s not swollen or bruised at all, but <br/>
is stiff and numb and intermittenly throbs. I keep icing it down, and <br/>
taking ibuprofen. I seriously can&#39;t put any weight on it. Even <br/>
lifting my leg to adjust the pillow that I am propping up on sends <br/>
pains shooting up my leg. I was finishing up shampooing the family <br/>
room when I heard screams near the basement stairs, my almost 2yo <br/>
dropped his train and I thought it was him thumping down to the <br/>
cement floor. I ran and hit a puddle on the linoleum and slide crash <br/>
boom, foot buckled under me. I was doing so well this weekend and <br/>
this week! STaying off the puter and getting stuff done for a busy <br/>
weekend of going to kentucky kingdom and having a 2yo birthday party. <br/>
Now I may have to cancel the trip. I can&#39;t walk around an amusement <br/>
park like this!<br/>
<br/>
Now here I am, rolling around in my computer chair and catching up on <br/>
the list, and finishing my overdue Teach Your Own.<br/>
