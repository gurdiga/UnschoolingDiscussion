<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505352967">No, this discussion started with a whole different person.  I have not<br/>
brought up the weeks in early September (with one exception) and as far<br/>
as know no one else has either.  My one exception was that when someone<br/>
said, - I never say something like that. - I asked her to go look at a<br/>
specific message where she did say something just like that.<br/>
<br/>
You know, the funny thing is, I wondered when I got involved in this<br/>
conversation, how long it would be before someone tried to pin it all on<br/>
the earlier conversation.  It is after all very similar to that one even<br/>
if it was started by others who felt attacked.<br/>

&gt; However, I do notice that  once<br/>
&gt; again, (as we do on a very regular basis) we have returned to the <br/>
&gt; discussion of Bridgets&#39;s perceived bashing.<br/>

pre- and post- Bridget.  Going back to lurking (for, I think, the 3rd time) <br/>
-- someone put up a subject line when the subject changes to something <br/>
worthwhile.<br/>
