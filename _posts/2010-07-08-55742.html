######################################################<br/>
Once a much younger Kirby wanted to walk to the corner store for a Dr Pepper. he asked what he could do to earn money. I whipped up a blank table with 1-9 across and 1-9 down, showed him what the multiplicatory deal was, and said I&#39;d give him a penny a square.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How much money will that be?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Same as the answer in this square,&quot; and I indicated the 9x9 square.<br/>
<br/>
Marty was only four or five, but he wanted in on this money-making puzzle, so I made him one too.<br/>
######################################################<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re still very new to unschooling... what unschooling actually is changes a little bit in my mind each week. <br/>
<br/>
The situation above seems like a very bad idea for new unschoolers. At what point, and in what situations, are learning prompts like the above a good idea? To be clear, I&#39;m *not* looking for reasons to &quot;prompt learning&quot;, I&#39;m just trying to better understand unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I just wanted to share that, 5 months into unschooling, my 10 year old, who has had a strong negative reaction in the past towards anything that has to do with reading and writing, wrote a short story yesterday about a picture she drew and posted on Google Buzz (similar to Facebook). There wasn&#39;t a single capitalized letter or punctuation mark in the story, but I couldn&#39;t help but feel joy that those negative feelings she has about reading/writing are starting to fade! :) I didn&#39;t make a big deal out of it, but did &quot;Like it&quot; (clicked the little &quot;thumbs up&quot; image below the post).<br/>

what point, and in what situations, are learning prompts like the  <br/>

<br/>
It wasn&#39;t &quot;a learning prompt.&quot;  It was something &quot;to earn money.&quot;  I  <br/>
didn&#39;t want to pay them to do housework, that was for sure.<br/>
<br/>
My kids hadn&#39;t been to school and so had no negative associations with  <br/>
math, writing or reading.<br/>
<br/>
It was just the goof of a moment, but it turned into a repeated game  <br/>
and the boys LIKED it.  Marty loved that he was quicker at it than  <br/>
Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
It might be &quot;a very bad idea.&quot;  I&#39;ve had thousands of ideas, and some  <br/>
have to be better than others.<br/>
<br/>
Very good ideas for new unschoolers are here:<br/>

<br/>
Should I not be truthful about how my kids learned things?  I&#39;m not  <br/>
whitewashing my life, but I AM experienced with unschooling, and  <br/>
didn&#39;t waver from that path from the very beginning.  I&#39;ve been asked  <br/>
by many interviewers and other unschoolers what I did before I was  <br/>
unschooling.  Before that was La Leche League and their 1980&#39;s version  <br/>
of attachment parenting (much simpler and more direct than what  <br/>
attachment parenting has become as a separate &quot;movement&quot; since then).<br/>
<br/>
Just this morning I cringed at a line from an essay I wrote when Holly  <br/>
was nine.  Not at the whole thing, just at one word:   &quot;When I’ve  <br/>
taught people about the history of English...&quot;   Taught.<br/>
<br/>
But you know what?  Since 2001 when that was written I&#39;ve kept on  <br/>
talking to people about the history of English, but I wasn&#39;t &quot;their  <br/>
teacher.&quot;  Before 2001 there had been quite a few years when I DID  <br/>
teach--with intention and for money--people about the history of  <br/>
English.  So I had to think back to &quot;the facts&quot; of that situation, in  <br/>
retrospect.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t use the word &quot;taught&quot; anymore unless I&#39;m talking about having  <br/>
been a professional teacher (or in other rare situations), so it  <br/>
struck me today.  But at the time I wrote it, that&#39;s what I meant.<br/>

<br/>
The situation that was called &quot;a very bad idea&quot; wasn&#39;t instructional.   <br/>
It wasn&#39;t &quot;everyone do this.&quot;  It was a true account of the first time  <br/>
my kids ever saw anything faintly resembling school-style  <br/>
multiplication, and their enthusiasm and ease with it.<br/>

<br/>
This is an example of truthfulness that is much appreciated! It takes less pressure off of being &quot;perfect&quot;. I do like the fact that you encourage people to think carefully about what they say. This is something I often struggle with... speaking without thinking... I have a tendency to unintentionally offend when I&#39;m trying to understand other people&#39;s positions, motives, thought processes, etc.. Reading your posts have really helped me to think about ways to question others in a non-offensive manner. I&#39;m not great at it yet, but at least I&#39;m thinking about it/more aware of it now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the links :)<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re paying them for things you would have paid others to do.    <br/>
They&#39;re teens.  That&#39;s different.<br/>
<br/>
Some people give their kids money to pick up their own laundry or to  <br/>
bring their dishes to the sink or whatever.  (And yes, there are some  <br/>
families who pay people to do that too... I&#39;m talking about average-to- <br/>
poor families, though.)<br/>
<br/>
I would worry that if I gave a child a dollar to get in the car, that  <br/>
I would be training him not to get into the car unless someone was  <br/>
holding out a dollar.   (Whether that&#39;s a sensible worry or not, I&#39;m  <br/>
not in the mood to wonder.)<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t worried that giving Kirby 99¢ or whatever it was that day  <br/>
that he would never mess with numbers again unless someone paid him.   <br/>
And if he hadn&#39;t been interested in that weird grid with the numbers,  <br/>
I would&#39;ve probably just given him money for a soda anyway.  It was  <br/>
done playfully as most things were at our house. (still are)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Its a good picture of how some kids who have never been schooled react to things that look a lot like &quot;school math&quot; - its an interesting puzzle, or an intriguing game. My 8yo has never been schooled or homeschooled, but finds &quot;math&quot; fun. That won&#39;t be true of *all* always-unschooled kids, Mo also loves things like logic puzzles, crosswords and puns (she gets that from George, I take no responsibility!). That can be problematic for parents who want &quot;unschooling math&quot; to look like children choosing to play with multiplication! Sometimes unschooling math doesn&#39;t look anything like school math at all.<br/>
<br/>
If you have kids who are deschooling, they&#39;ll probably run screaming if you pull out anything like a multiplication table. If You&#39;re still deschooling, you&#39;ll probably have a hard time seeing playing with multiplication as something honestly fun, rather than a &quot;learning experience&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
My 16yo, who still has a bit of a negative view of &quot;math&quot; from his years of homeschool and school, can do a whole lot of very real math in his head. He&#39;s been working part-time for a local cabinet shop, for instance, and at the end of his first full job, including installation, he had this to say: &quot;I was worried about the math, but there wasn&#39;t any, it was all just measuring.&quot; Something he struggled with in school, adding and subtracting fractions, he learned in one day on the job as an application of something he already knew: how to read a tape measure.<br/>

Oh, true!<br/>
<br/>
And I didn&#39;t say to Kirby that day (or to Marty, who practically took  <br/>
the page away from him to do it himself) &quot;this is what kids are  <br/>
talking about when they say &#39;times tables.&#39;&quot;  I just presented it as a  <br/>

to better understand unschooling.***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When a kid grows up in the absence of school, they won&#39;t see something like that <br/>
as schoolish, they&#39;ll see it as a puzzle.  If they&#39;ve been forced to do all <br/>
kinds of math puzzles and worksheets and irrelevant to them, numbers and problem <br/>
solving, they&#39;ll likely see something like that as just another one.  This is <br/>
why the deschooling process is so important.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s often the parent who needs more of it than the kids.  Kids are, by nature, <br/>
curious about the world and find things fascinating.  They tend to regain their <br/>
curiosity much quicker than an adult who&#39;s been to school for 12+ yrs and lived <br/>
in schoolish thought for longer than that.  Right now, to you, that puzzle still <br/>
feels like school.  It might not at all feel schoolish to one of your kids who <br/>
finds puzzles and numbers interesting to play with.<br/>
<br/>
Math is a tool, a way of thinking, a way to categorize the world and define it&#39;s <br/>
parameters.  If the subject of math never came into being a school subject, <br/>
people would STILL use it because it&#39;s everywhere all around us.  <br/>
<br/>
A puzzle is not and should not be a learning prompt.  That notion is a school <br/>
one.  If learning happens all the time, there&#39;s no need for prompting it.  In <br/>
school, that sort of vocabulary is used because kids, while learning all the <br/>
time, don&#39;t necessarily want to sit at a desk and do meaningless, to them, <br/>
puzzles, and must be prompted to do so, given incentives to &quot;learn&quot; it.  And by <br/>
&quot;learn&quot; it, they mean complete the worksheet with as little mistakes as <br/>
possible, not actually learning it, even though it is equated to actually <br/>
learning it.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve avoided doing that because I want living together to be about living <br/>
together and maintaining our living area because we live here.  The kids that I <br/>
know, who are forced to do chores whether or not they get paid for it, do the <br/>
bare minimum they can get away with and take as little time as possible to get <br/>
it over with.  That&#39;s not the kind of relationship that I want to foster for my <br/>
kids and household maintenance.  Doing dishes and laundry and picking up and <br/>
sweeping and vacuuming and all that stuff, I do as a gift of service for my <br/>
family.  I do it when I want to, I do it when I feel happy about doing it.  <br/>
<br/>
Doing books and cleaning a pool are extra things.  If you would normally hire <br/>
someone else to do those things, I don&#39;t see why that would be different than <br/>
hiring your kids.  Although, that same argument could be used if a family pays <br/>
for a house cleaner.  What we&#39;ve always done is to give our kids money when we <br/>
have it, no strings attached.  They don&#39;t have to do anything but exist as our <br/>
kids to get it.  Sometimes our form of giving them money comes about by paying <br/>
for something that they really want or want to do and sometimes it&#39;s just cash.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-340711804">This is a recent account of what happened a few weeks ago at the water park.<br/>
<br/>
I went online to see about the park hours and what not, and what the fee was.  <br/>
My son, 11, always unschooled, asked me how much.  I said, $35 each.  Oh, he <br/>
said.  That&#39;s expensive.  And wandered off.<br/>
<br/>
When we got to the water park, on the way to the gate, same son said, so, with 3 <br/>
people that&#39;s $105.  That&#39;s a lot of money!  My daughter said, what is?  (she&#39;s <br/>
lost in thought a lot of the time or has iPod earbuds in her ears).  So my son <br/>
told her, it&#39;s $35 per person to get in, so it&#39;s $105.<br/>
<br/>
Later, as we left the park my son was remarking on the cost again.  Then my <br/>
daughter asked how long we had been there, so I said we got here at 1, and now <br/>
it&#39;s 6.  So 5 hours, my son said.  So then I asked, so how many dollars per hour <br/>
did we spend? (keeping with the train of thought my son was having.  So he <br/>
thought a minute then said, $20.  And thought a minute more and said $21.<br/>
<br/>
That wasn&#39;t meant to be a quiz when I asked my son the question, just tossing <br/>
out another variable.  He could have said, I don&#39;t know, how many?  And I would <br/>
have answered.<br/>
<br/>
This is one way math looks at our house.<br/>

I love this. All five of us do it. Jeff (hubby) will ask me, I&#39;ll ask him and/or the kids or the kids will ask us or each other. Sometimes it&#39;s just an effort by the questioner to get the answer more quickly.  <br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m asking the question I&#39;m likely figuring out the answer as I&#39;m asking the question. Often times one of the kids (or Jeff) will have it figured out before me. Then I and/or Jeff do the calculations in our heads to and compare answers. <br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of how I used to do my math homework as a kid. I had a best friend (that didn&#39;t like math, I LOVED it). We would sit on the phone for an hour/s doing our homework. We do a problem and then say, &quot;what did you get?&quot; if the answers didn&#39;t agree we&#39;d try and figure out why and/or explain how we got to the answer we got. <br/>
<br/>
When I stopped being friends with this girl. I stopped doing my homework.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294923970">We were at a restaurant the other day and Zac (16) mentioned he&#39;d need to learn math better before he could eat out without us so he could figure tips.  I mentioned that 10% is really very easy and started with things like 10 % of 100,  10% of 10, etc.  Then we started throwing out numbers to each other and saying the amount the tip would be.  We&#39;ve done this in the past when he has asked how to figure a tip but he did not remember.<br/>
<br/>
When I mentioned that 15% was easy too because it is just another half of 10 % added to 10% his eyes started to glaze over so I dropped it.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I remember when Ed and I got married (26 years ago) he asked me how I could figure percentages so easily in my head - I gave him a simple explanation of how if you can do 10% in your head you can pretty much do any amount based on 10%.  If it is an odd percentage vs. an even one you can at least get close very quickly.  Things like this were explained to me as a child by my dad - just a farmer living life ;) - not school.  BUT then again I love math and love to play with numbers!  Even though I&#39;m the &quot;work out of the home person&quot; in this family: I pay the bills, make budgets, balance the check book, keep track of finances, do the taxes, etc.<br/>

They make little cards with a table of dollar amounts and 15% of each - I think office supply stores carry them. A girlfriend of mine is a CPA and does almost no math in her head. She uses a table, or calculator, even counts on her fingers. Now and then someone will comment and she says &quot;I&#39;d rather be right than proud.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
My dad, who&#39;s an engineer, just reminded me that engineers use a different tape measure than carpenters - they use one that breaks inches down into tenths instead of sixteenths, so they can punch the numbers into a calculator. Its interesting to me that the guys with the most math education on a construction site don&#39;t do math in their heads. My dad says the same as my girlfriend: &quot;I&#39;d rather be right.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Probably one of the worst things school does is tell kids that its bad to use tools in order to get the &quot;right&quot; answer - its backwards from real life. <br/>
