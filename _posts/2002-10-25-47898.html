<div id="ygrps-yiv-434940442">** Are there moms here that have never spanked and had great results? And<br/>
moms that started out spanking and stopped by  learning better ways?**<br/>
<br/>
My kids are really spread out in age. 6 1/2 years between the first and <br/>
second, then another 7 1/2 years before the third and fourth were born (of <br/>
course, those two are only 13 minutes apart so I guess that evens things out. <br/>
&lt;gg&gt; ) I had a lot of time to learn from my mistakes, time to breathe and <br/>
think before another child hit the same stage/age/behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest was spanked. Designated punishments, restrictions, groundings, <br/>
&quot;logical consequences&quot;, probably the whole basketful of standard american <br/>
parenting practices. The second was spanked once. She&#39;ll never forget it, <br/>
though both she and I can no longer remember what it was for. The 10yos have <br/>
never been spanked. My youngest son was horrified when he recently learned <br/>
what spanking is - I guess he&#39;s been kind of sheltered.  <br/>
<br/>
Great results? That second child, who had one regretted spanking, is 17 now. <br/>
I don&#39;t often brag about her online because it embarasses her when she finds <br/>
out, but... I&#39;ve had moms tell me that they&#39;re hoping their daughters grow up <br/>
to be like her. She&#39;s kind, courteous, dependable, friendly, responsible, and <br/>
a genuinely nice person. What more could I ask for? <br/>

If this is too personal, I understand. I was wondering how the first born is <br/>
doing now? Do you see any major differences because of how that child was <br/>
raised as far as the spankings and restrictions and all?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710429837">What is your definition of unschooling?<br/>
What is your definition of violence towards children?<br/>
<br/>
Oh nevermind. This post gave me cold chills and I don&#39;t want to read <br/>
anything else you have to say. You are obviously raising your <br/>
children with fear tactics. It&#39;s easy to get someone to be obedient <br/>
when you are larger and you&#39;ll hit them if they don&#39;t. Your son <br/>
doesn&#39;t respect you any more than you respect him. He fears you and <br/>
your unfair wrath. I find your parenting style offensive and one of <br/>
the main causes of overcrowded prisons. I&#39;m so baffled as to how you <br/>
think hitting a child shows him love, respect or anything to do with <br/>
trust. <br/>
<br/>
Does your husband also hit you? Is all hitting in your home in the <br/>
name of God? Bet that pisses God off.. oops.. makes Him angry. <br/>
<br/>
Why are you on an unschooling list? Or were you planted here to <br/>
start a fight? <br/>
<br/>
I keep getting a picture of your children in chains and you and your <br/>
husband holding whips. Figuratively...it&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>

Well you said it yourself in a contradiction. Your son that gets spanked <br/>
hasn&#39;t learned to respect you, he&#39;s learned that if he doesn&#39;t listen, he <br/>
gets hurt. And yes it does hurt. Have you not read anything of what we who <br/>
have been spanked and had spanked and saw what happens to our kids as a <br/>
result have said???<br/>
<br/>
When do your poor kids get to have any kind of mind of their own? What are <br/>
you running, a platoon or a family? You are in charge?? In charge of making <br/>
kids be submissive to your ways?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really to sick to say anymore.<br/>

You can&#39;t keep him any longer than he&#39;s willing to be there.  Two of my <br/>

their overbearing parents.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; anything else you have to say<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s very sad that you would be so rude to a newcomer on the <br/>
list.  I think it&#39;s sad that you would be intolerant of other <br/>
people&#39;s parenting practices.  Even if it does give you cold chills, <br/>
there are much nicer ways to talk to people you disagree with.  You <br/>
catch more flies with honey...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily true that one can&#39;t be an unschooler <br/>
AND choose to spank.  I would think that totally unschooling would <br/>
usually lead to a non-spanking position, but that&#39;s just my guess.  <br/>
Not everyone gets there at the same time.  <br/>
<br/>
If a spanker would say to a non-spanker, &quot;I don&#39;t want to read <br/>
anything else you have to say&quot;, they would get slammed big time.  <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve had two people tell me that my posts repulsed them, just <br/>
because I support parental rights.  If I told someone who doesn&#39;t <br/>
believe in parental rights that their posts repulsed me, I would get <br/>
slammed big time.  <br/>
<br/>
Is it ok to be verbally mean to people because they have a different <br/>
point of view?  That&#39;s not good discussion and it&#39;s not good <br/>
debating.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as who is disrupting the list, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the people <br/>
who are brave enough to stick up for their right to discipline their <br/>
children according to their own consciences, I think it&#39;s the handful <br/>
of people who reply with cold meanness. <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily true that one can&#39;t be an unschooler <br/>

<br/>
Possibly so. <br/>
It&#39;s not worth us encouraging people to be half-assed unschoolers, though.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Not everyone gets there at the same time.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have no reason to believe that the writer of the totally pro-spanking post <br/>
is an unschooler, or is even interested in unschooling.  Unless I missed <br/>
reading something interesting, there was nothing before the advertisement for <br/>
spanking.  I suspect, from experience, that she was invited here by someone <br/>
who is pro spanking, she came and did her duty, and she&#39;ll be gone when the <br/>
spanking debate is gone.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t hurt my feelings if I&#39;m wrong.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If a spanker would say to a non-spanker, &quot;I don&#39;t want to read <br/>
anything else you have to say&quot;, they would get slammed big time.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
On this list?  There are entire churches, homeschooling conferences, <br/>
homeschooling support groups, umbrella groups and such which are TOTALLY <br/>
based on not wanting to read anything that doesn&#39;t match the narrow set of <br/>
beliefs they have chosen to call &quot;THE WHOLE TRUTH.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Any homeschooling group with a statement of faith does not want to read what <br/>
anyone else has to say.  <br/>
<br/>
Any conference that starts with a prayer and the main speaker&#39;s point is that <br/>
husbands MUST take back control of their families and work with other <br/>
Christians to restore America to her Christian roots does NOT want their <br/>
attendees reading anything non-spankers have to say.<br/>
<br/>
Two homeschooling speakers I know have been censured and walked out on for <br/>
saying what they always say, but they were INVITED to Christian conferences, <br/>
and then mistreated.  When the GWS booth was being set up (I think it was in <br/>
North Carolina) a few years back. organizers went through the books and <br/>
forbade the display or sale of three titles.  Books which promoted the rights <br/>
of children were NOT allowed to be on display.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If a spanker would say to a non-spanker, &quot;I don&#39;t want to read <br/>
anything else you have to say&quot;, they would get slammed big time.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll say this again:  Most of the people who were Christian by birth and were <br/>
spanked AND who now have chosen not to spank already KNOW the lame arguments <br/>
for spanking.  WE KNOW THAT.  We have lived in that.  Now we have chosen a <br/>
different way, with our eyes and hearts wide open.<br/>
<br/>
Those who have never considered NOT spanking only know one way.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers could easily say we don&#39;t want to read any more of the pro-school <br/>
shaming threats of teachers and teachers&#39; unions about homeschooling.  WE <br/>
KNOW about school.  We also know about homeschooling.  In a head to head <br/>
debate, those who have homeschooled know more about homeschooling than those <br/>
who wouldn&#39;t even consider it at all, whether teachers or parents.<br/>
<br/>
So here we have people who know about spanking AND know about other ways.<br/>
We don&#39;t need to be preached to by people who do NOT know about both ways.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And I&#39;ve had two people tell me that my posts repulsed them, just <br/>
because I support parental rights.  If I told someone who doesn&#39;t <br/>
believe in parental rights that their posts repulsed me, I would get <br/>
slammed big time.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are places to go for people who want to be part of a parental rights <br/>
and powers and duties and dedication rally.  Lots of them.<br/>
<br/>
If some of us went to a Christian discipline and obedience discussion list or <br/>
forum and said &quot;You people are blind to the violence you&#39;re teaching,&quot; they <br/>
would throw us out.  Plain and simple.  OUT.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is it ok to be verbally mean to people because they have a different <br/>
point of view?  That&#39;s not good discussion and it&#39;s not good <br/>
debating.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If someone came here just to defend spanking, that&#39;s disruption.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;As far as who is disrupting the list, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the people <br/>
who are brave enough to stick up for their right to discipline their <br/>
children according to their own consciences, I think it&#39;s the handful <br/>
of people who reply with cold meanness. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s mean to tell people their children are being harmed by <br/>
their discipline, or that the parents should try to learn better ways to <br/>
interact with children they purport to lovel.<br/>
<br/>
Abram Maslow&#39;s heirarchy of needs, which I&#39;ve never heard disputed by anyone <br/>
in any field, says before children can learn they need to feel safe.  The <br/>
fear of a whippin&#39; is not safety.<br/>
<br/>
It would be a huge kindness to the children of spanking parents if ANYONE <br/>
could persuade the parents to consider another course of action.<br/>
<br/>
It would be cold meanness if we knew a better way and didn&#39;t say so.<br/>
<br/>
It would be list destruction if we just let all kinds of anti-unschooling <br/>
suggestions sit there without pointing out the disadvantages of them where <br/>
unschooling is concerned.<br/>

series of questions seeking to sort out non-human replicants from humans. One<br/>
of the questions is about a leather purse, &quot;What do you do if someone gives<br/>
you one?&quot; The correct answer, for the test, is to turn it down and report the<br/>
person to the authorities, for in the future mostly all animals except human<br/>
are extinct. In other words, leather is abhorrent and the word has a different<br/>
frame of reference.  <br/>
<br/>
When parental rights translates down to those who choose to physically harm<br/>
their children, and many here have been harmed and damaged by those &quot;rights&quot;,<br/>
nice words don&#39;t seem as important as not hiding ugliness behind pretty words.<br/>
They didn&#39;t say *you* repulsed them, but that your words did. Those words<br/>
might mean things to them that you can&#39;t even imagine. Why not try? Why not<br/>
put yourself in the shoes of those who live every day of their life aware of<br/>
the pain that shaped them into what they are now? Perhaps repulse won&#39;t like<br/>
seem such an awful word then, it might even seem barely adequate.<br/>

What a shame someone would feel the right to treat someone else that <br/>
way.  <br/>
The poster claimed to want him to grow to obey God, from having to <br/>
obey his parents unquestioningly all his life.  Is that really <br/>
logical??<br/>
Are the parents ego so great that they would play the role of God in <br/>
their childs life!?  Are they infallible (as God is suppose to be)?<br/>
How can anyone justify taking on that role?<br/>
Why would anyone want to raise a non thinking, dependant on others <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-989271575">First of all I find it difficult to believe that the spanker is <br/>
actually an unschooler. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s possible, but unlikely. If so, <br/>
she has much to learn about what constitutes unschooling. I&#39;m not <br/>
trying to catch flies. I not only disagree with her, I feel that she <br/>
is abusing her children. She&#39;s teaching her children that if they <br/>
don&#39;t do as she says, she will hit them. That&#39;s prison mentality.<br/>
<br/>
I would hope that the reactions of people here on this list would <br/>
make her realize how much harm she is doing to her children by her <br/>
behavior. If we just sat nicely with our hands in our laps and <br/>
said, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s up to you if you want to abuse your children... we <br/>
will just turn our heads and support you,&quot; then she would not get <br/>
the message that she is making a huge mistake. <br/>
<br/>
A different point of view will draw no anger from me. Telling me <br/>
that you hit your child will totally baffle me and yes... cause me <br/>
to say &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear anything else you have to say.&quot;  If it <br/>
takes &quot;cold meanness&quot; to help her see the err of her ways, then I&#39;m <br/>
here to help. I&#39;ve physically stopped parents from hitting their <br/>
children in the mall and other public places, and I&#39;ll continue <br/>
doing so. Some have resented the interference and others have calmed <br/>
down and listened to reason, thanking me later. I&#39;d also attempt to <br/>
stop them from hitting another adult.<br/>

placed kids with their parents, so they had the right to raise them as<br/>
they &quot;saw fit&quot;, even if you didn&#39;t agree with their methods of<br/>
punishment. Because you give God the responsibility for placing kids with<br/>
evil, messed-up people that all of us mortals can see have no business<br/>
being parents - but God apparently can&#39;t tell that people who injure<br/>
small animals and the kids they already have will most likely do evil<br/>
things to another baby, so he keeps providing them. God must be<br/>
incredibly stupid, then...<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, this belief conveniently absolves you of responsibility<br/>
for not doing anything to help these kids, you can sit and watch and tell<br/>
yourself that God chose those parents so you shouldn&#39;t interfere.<br/>
<br/>
You said later that you didn&#39;t advocate &quot;abuse&quot;, wherever you draw that<br/>
line. But why not? If the same God chose those parenst for those kids,<br/>
why do you now question his judgement? You&#39;re a true believer up to<br/>
spankings with wooden spoons, but electrical cords are no longer God&#39;s<br/>
will? <br/>

is <br/>

doing now? Do you see any major differences because of how that child was <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not possible to say, because that isn&#39;t the only difference in how they <br/>
were raised.<br/>
<br/>
The oldest went to school for 6 years, the second never, and the youngest <br/>
have always lived in an unschooling home. That alone has caused HUGE <br/>
differences in how they perceive the world and interact with it, how they <br/>
think of themselves, their interactions with other people, everything. In <br/>
addition, the oldest carries a different genetic load than the others, and <br/>
lived in a more unpredictable and unstable environment for many of his early <br/>
years. There are also huge differences in basic personality, from infancy <br/>
onward. <br/>
<br/>
I can say that spanking was generally ineffective for us in changing <br/>
behaviour. <br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, in the context of this conversation, I decided we were <br/>
going to give up spankings and school at pretty much the same time. I didn&#39;t <br/>
consider the decisions to be related to each other until much later, though.<br/>

Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Spanking/not spanking<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I have a 5 yr. old son who gets spanked when he is disobedient.  As a<br/>
  Christian, I firmly believe in spanking and it truly works for us.  He is<br/>
not<br/>
  allowed to test us...we don&#39;t do the &quot;1,2,3&quot; thing.  We believe that if he<br/>
is<br/>
  allowed to get away with something even once...like with &quot;come here<br/>
please.<br/>
  I said, come here please.  If you don&#39;t come here you will get a time<br/>
out.&quot;<br/>
  We don&#39;t repeat ourselves...and if we have to...then he gets a spanking.<br/>
  People can&#39;t believe it when I ask him to do something and he just says<br/>
&quot;ok<br/>
  Mom&quot;.  He has just learned and respects that we are his parents and that<br/>
in<br/>
  some cases if he doesn&#39;t listen the FIRST time...it could lead to harm.<br/>
  (getting hit by a car, for example).  Reb Bradley has a book out called,<br/>
  &quot;Child Training Tips&quot;.  That is great and there is also a parenting video<br/>
  series that deal with the &quot;point of disobedience&quot; type of discipline.<br/>
  And...you may spank a few times at the beginning..as they adjust...then<br/>
you<br/>
  find it&#39;s rare.<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s how we discipline and it works great.  I just believe that he...and<br/>
  our 1 1/2 yr. old and 3 mth. old...need to be raised to know we are in<br/>
  charge...and they need to be able to obey us...so that as adults...it is<br/>
  easier for them to obey God&#39;s word.<br/>
<br/>
  As far as swearing....we also don&#39;t swear...and it would abslolutely NOT<br/>
be<br/>
  tolerated...but of course...just handled the same way.  If he is aware<br/>
that<br/>
  he is not supposed to do it...he&#39;d get a spanking.  Of course...we don&#39;t<br/>
  spank if he just plain did not know he wasn&#39;t supposed to do<br/>
something...but<br/>
  with the obvious...we do.<br/>
<br/>

is damaging, spirit breaking, controlling, hateful, abhorrent. The spanker <br/>
does not treat the spankee gently. Why oh why should we treat her with kid <br/>
gloves? <br/>
<br/>
If I came in here and posted that we were having a horrible day at our house. <br/>
Moly is pouting and being generally nasty. She is using a loud voice, bossing <br/>
her brother, snatching toys and books from him. Jack is whining and fussing <br/>
and every time Moly comes near him he shrieks. He chased the dog so much and <br/>
teased her with her treats that now she is hiding, shaking under my bed. Moly <br/>
just slammed the front door and didn&#39;t tell me she was going anywhere. And <br/>
Jack just spilled orange juice all over the floor and I mopped just last <br/>
night. Then I saw LEGOs all over the living room floor and my folks will be <br/>
here in three hours and... I got so mad I spanked them both and sent them to <br/>
their rooms.<br/>

Do you think Sandra or Ren or Dar or Pam or anyone is going to say *That&#39;s <br/>
okay* and give me a cyber pat on the back? Hardly. Sandra is going to ask why <br/>
I thought there was only one choice. Why had I limited myself to one choice <br/>
when there are so many more? Sandra is going to get right to the point. Ren <br/>
and Dar and Pam and others are going to chime in with advice on how I should <br/>
have separated the kids sooner, or shut the blinds and made a nest on the <br/>
couch and turned on a quiet calm movie for us to cuddle up to. Or, Or, Or... <br/>
Someone else is going to ask if they had eaten something today that didn&#39;t <br/>
agree with them. Someone else is going to ask what the heck I am doing on the <br/>

better. <br/>

one who shook my had after church?&quot; &quot;Were you the one who smiled at me when I <br/>
rode by your house?&quot; &quot;Were you the one who got that book for me?&quot; and then <br/>
one kid says &quot;Or, were you the one who looked away?&quot; Well, in online land, we <br/>
can&#39;t look at the kid, we can&#39;t shake his hand or smile at her. We can&#39;t show <br/>
a child that we care online. But if we can make a difference in a parents <br/>
thinking, then we helped improve a child&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
The poster you are referring too hasn&#39;t responded (yet that I know of) the <br/>
poster was the one who was inflammatory. <br/>

I love that point.<br/>
<br/>
And in improving a child&#39;s life, the parents&#39; lives are improved.  Then the <br/>
family is improved.  Then other families they meet want to know why they&#39;re <br/>
getting along so well.<br/>
<br/>
Or else we can all put our kids back in school and spank them if they cry <br/>
about it.<br/>

Seriously, it&#39;s been about a week (say 10/19/02), a month after the <br/>
date mentioned.  However, last night I found a series of posts on <br/>
spanking from 6/2000, two years ago.  So you have been talking about <br/>
it for at least that long.<br/>

if you are an unschooler, you are LOOKING to get there, not spamming <br/>
the list <br/>

 </span></blockquote>And there is where our differences lie. I believe that one CAN be an <br/>
unschooler and still be a spanker.   The poster probably didn&#39;t mean <br/>
to be inflammatory, because she didn&#39;t know that many unschoolers <br/>
don&#39;t spank.  She might be an unschooler, or might be one of those <br/>
who &quot;kind of unschool, but still uses a curriculum for some <br/>
subjects&quot;.  (That was me at one time.) I highly doubt she considered <br/>
herself to be spamming. (I didn&#39;t consider her to be spamming.)  <br/>

Unschooling doesn&#39;t necessarily mean not spanking. <br/>

No, not that I&#39;m aware of. It&#39;s just that she *knew* how some people felt <br/>
about it, and chose to pour even more fuel on the fire :(<br/>

I think sometimes we get people hollering &quot;I don&#39;t want to be improved! <br/>

At least, that&#39;s what I hear, if I listen closely.  And, heck, sometimes<br/>

something?<br/>
My kids are free to learn naturally, from their mistakes and <br/>
accomplishments.  There is no fear of pain if they &quot;take the wrong <br/>
path&quot; in a decision.  There is guiding help and a listening ear.<br/>
