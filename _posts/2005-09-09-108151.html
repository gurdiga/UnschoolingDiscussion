<br/>
Lycoris radiata (Dwarf Surprise Lily)<br/>
Sun to Light ShadeZone: 6-10, at least 15&quot; tall Origin: China<br/>
This Southern heirloom bulb is one of the most popular plants in old Southern <br/>
gardens. The small, narrow strap-like blue-green leaves die away in early <br/>
spring. Then seemingly out of nowhere in August, the 15&quot; tall spikes emerge from <br/>
underground, topped with a deciduous azalea-like flower of bright red. After <br/>
the flowers fade, the leaves emerge again and persist until spring, producing <br/>
food for next year&#39;s flowering. L. radiata doesn&#39;t always flower every <br/>
year...we feel the flowering is probably controlled by aliens who like to torment <br/>
Earth-bound gardeners.<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE that, because Holly said maybe the aliens sent it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
My neighbor, when I asked him, didn&#39;t know but said &quot;Maybe those lights on <br/>
the crest the other night caused it&quot; (people reported strange lights one night; <br/>
it was a mountaintop photo shoot with bright lighting at night, we heard)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m definitely going to dig it up and move it to a safer place.   Maybe it <br/>
would have bloomed other years but Keith mows the lawn.   The bulbs we planted <br/>
there were planted seven or eight years ago, and after that we&#39;ve moved every <br/>
one we saw come up to better places.   <br/>
