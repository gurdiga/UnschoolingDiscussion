<div id="ygrps-yiv-733988755">&lt;&lt;we have a law about infringing on other people&#39;s rights to have their<br/>
freedom&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We are working on this.  We try hard to consider the fact that people might<br/>
be having an off day or whatever, but occasionally someone has to bear the<br/>
brunt of their own actions.  It makes me sad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-919157004">&lt;&lt;setting stuff out the night before&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have tried this kind of stuff.  Problem with Zach is if you are wanting<br/>
him to do something, like get his stuff out for tomorrow, what he is doing<br/>
right now is much more interesting.  If you are really into what is going on<br/>
right now, he can&#39;t wait to see what is going to happen next.<br/>
<br/>
He is making strides though.  Last year, if I were to ask him if he<br/>
remembered to brush his teeth because his breath smelled, he would flop on<br/>
the floor and whine.  He simply didn&#39;t want to brush his teeth and he didn&#39;t<br/>
want dragon breath either (or at least, he didn&#39;t want people to be bothered<br/>
by his smelly breath).  This year, if I ask, he jumps up and goes to brush.<br/>
<br/>
He wants so much to be in control of his life that how the world works<br/>
(sometimes A has to happen before B can happen) makes him nuts.  Luckily he<br/>
is a very lovable nut  :)<br/>
