&gt; The difference is that on that &quot;other list&quot;<br/>
&gt; people do NOT play tag team nor do they wait for the next opportunity to<br/>
&gt; disect something said by the party they are bent out of shape at.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If there&#39;s a tag team, I wasn&#39;t invited to join. I know quite a few of the<br/>
people on this list and have for a long time, including Lisa Bugg, whose<br/>
post you quoted with the accusations above. If there were an organized group<br/>
doing this, I&#39;m not bragging to say I&#39;d be on Lisa&#39;s short list of people to<br/>
talk to about it. The fact is, Lisa is not that kind of person, so it&#39;s<br/>
moot.<br/>
<br/>
When many people all disagree with someone&#39;s views, it isn&#39;t necessary to<br/>
choreograph. Honest reactions and opinions work just fine.<br/>
