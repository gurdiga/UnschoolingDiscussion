<div id="ygrps-yiv-813745254">AH.. neopets.. my son is an avid neo pet kid.. i am happy to hear he will be working with more numbers there as he goes.. yesterday he asked me how to do html.. i was so happy to be able to tell his father these things.. (that and the lizard guts thing from the other day) as his dad is the one i have fought the most on this homeschool thing.. i try not to even use the term UNschool with his dad.. i&#39;m sure it makes him nervous.. lol... <br/>
<br/>
so i told my son how to put an image on his neopet page in the html.. and he said.. &quot;yeah, but how do you do html?&quot;.. hahha.. &quot;you just DID some html&quot;.. he was amazed.. i am so so happy to see him sucking information off the internet the way he has been this summer.. and watching his confidence grow and see him relaxing as he realizes he does NOT have to go back to school.. <br/>
<br/>
and, pam, your kids sound like such fabulous little entrepreneurs.. (well not all that little....) .. what better way to learn about numbers.... i had told my son to start a business to learn about numbers. but the more i see what he is doing at places like neopets.. i see he is already doing a lot of that stuff.. are your kids still hanging out at neopets? if so i will tell my son.. from what i can tell i think my son is  &quot;one_of_a_kind135&quot;  there.<br/>
<br/>
(eeks.. i hear in the other room i&#39;m missing something on today&#39;s tour de france stage.. must go see what&#39;s happening.. .. lots of vicarious thrills thru france watching the race.. )<br/>

  &gt; Also, we do the checkbook in front of the<br/>
  &gt; kids- how can a kid see this without asking what in the world you are<br/>
  &gt; doing<br/>
<br/>
  We use banks, but checkbooks are mostly a thing of the past for us. I have <br/>
  one, but I&#39;ve lost it for months at a time and not noticed &lt;G&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
  My kids have their own accounts with ATM cards. Roya works a lot and makes <br/>
  good money and it gets direct-deposited into her account- she is 17. Roxana <br/>
  is 14 and gets $14 per month from us and also makes some extra by creating <br/>
  flyers and announcements and website stuff for friends and family once in a <br/>
  while. Rosie is 11 and gets $11 per month from us and somehow manages to earn <br/>
  other money doing odd jobs for people. They always have a bit of money saved <br/>
  up - occasionally get $20 for a gift from a relative, for example. They don&#39;t <br/>
  seem to have any trouble saving it or spending it on what they want. <br/>
<br/>
  Oh - and they know ALL about compound interest -- they learned that because <br/>
  the points earned playing NeoPets games online are compounded.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-698736231">From my 16 yo who was on Neopets from the day it started - was part of <br/>
focus groups for it, in fact.<br/>
<br/>
****************<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s FUN. So... what&#39;s the problem with playing games? The pets are <br/>
cute,<br/>
you can get way into the world cos it&#39;s very detailed and the animals <br/>
are<br/>
very unique. It&#39;s very very VERY well organized and laid out. It&#39;s FUN.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, playing games is a waste of a kid&#39;s time? That&#39;s sad.<br/>
<br/>
Okay - there are lots of games on the site that are really blatantly <br/>
mathematics, how&#39;s that for starters? There&#39;s one called, I think, Math <br/>
Nightmare, where you have to do increasingly difficult arithmetic sums <br/>
in very short time limits to win.<br/>
<br/>
Also other games that are like mind benders and things, so there&#39;s <br/>
logic and puzzle... puzzling skills.<br/>
<br/>
It could teach someone responsibility - if you don&#39;t care for your <br/>
pets, while they don&#39;t actually die, they get very sad..<br/>
<br/>
You earn points and they are compounded.<br/>
That&#39;s how I learned what compound interest is.<br/>
<br/>
Also there&#39;s a stock market which, as far as I can tell, works just as <br/>
the real one does, only with Neopets companies.<br/>
<br/>
There is much more.<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
<br/>
Plushie Tycoon is a game that takes place over one month, where you <br/>
operate a business, and have to try to be profitable - you have to rent <br/>
warehouse space, hire workers, buy supplies, market them, etc.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few spelling games which are, like the math ones, blatantly <br/>
educational.<br/>
<br/>
They hold poetry and story-writing competitions.<br/>
<br/>
Enough???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-879711438">I think his opinion of it stems mostly from having had best friend&#39;s oldest child here...she is very lazy and irresponsible and doing her best (at 13) to flunk completely out of school...she doesn&#39;t play any of the &quot;academic&quot; games at all...He&#39;s had to tell her she can NOT be on the computer when she&#39;s here because of her attitudes and unwillingness to share time on it. <br/>
 <br/>
Nor do I think he&#39;s REALLY checked it out for himself...<br/>
 <br/>
I played Math Nightmare last night. I thought it would be SOOO easy, I mean it&#39;s targeted towards children, right? Add, subtract, multiply or divide...but it actually ended up showing me how little math I can do in my head. Especially subtraction with borrowing! ACK! <br/>
 <br/>
SO I plan to go there and play quite a bit and practice doing math in my head...<br/>
