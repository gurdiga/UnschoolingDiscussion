<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863188630">My parents never censored our television or our reading.  I have seen every<br/>
bloody &quot;spaghetti-western&quot; ever made I think.  I read raunchy &quot;romance&quot;<br/>
novels by 12.<br/>
<br/>
When I was about 8 my family went to see &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy<br/>
Bean&quot; with Paul Newman.  The prostitutes in the show were kind of dumb and<br/>
silly so when the characters used the word &quot;whore&quot; to describe them, I<br/>
figured the word meant stupid.  At the end of the movie we were kind of<br/>
watching the credits roll by as the theater emptied.  I hollered out in my<br/>
best 8yo way &quot;Look Mama, it says whore up there!!!&quot;  Took me the longest to<br/>
figure out why my mom was embarrassed.<br/>
