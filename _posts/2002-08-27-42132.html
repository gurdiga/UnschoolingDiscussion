As you might expect, your post was most welcome for me. I agree that a lot<br/>
of what gets posted here seems like therapy (&quot;joy&quot; -- feel good about<br/>
yourself) when what seems important to me gets dissed and shouted down.<br/>
While I have just been called &quot;schoolish,&quot; for asking a question, we have a<br/>
few schoolmarms always on our tails here, as you&#39;ve noticed. Some of them<br/>
seem content to complain about me instead of contribute something of their<br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
 I like the saying, &quot;If you stand for nothing, you&#39;ll fall for anything,&quot; so<br/>
when I talk about the public schools, it is to tell people the thousand ways<br/>
that those places are damaging for children and a fraud perpetrated upon all<br/>
citizens. I also like to talk about the wonders of letting kids educate<br/>
themselves. The battle comes because we keep having to beg for permission to<br/>
let them do that. I am, as you can tell, outraged by that.<br/>
<br/>
Often when people sing the praises of homeschooling, we hear from school<br/>
supporters that the schools are trying to do the same things... &quot;for the<br/>
children.&quot; It is one of my purposes to expose that as a lie. It might be<br/>
true if the schools were run by the parents and the teachers (as private<br/>
schools are), but they&#39;re not, they&#39;re run by the state depts of ed. and<br/>
they get their orders from politicians and the teachers&#39; unions. Public<br/>
schools, as you know, have agendas for children that are entirely different<br/>
from those of parents.<br/>
<br/>
My recent posts here have had the purpose of trying to find out whether the<br/>
list is supposed to offer merely pablum to timid newbies or real food for<br/>
more experienced people. I agree with you that there is room for both, and<br/>
that lately a great deal of space has been devoted to eliminating the real<br/>
food in favor of leaving the thin gruel. I believe it is mostly an insult to<br/>
the intelligence of this list.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to know you&#39;re here. Just like getting phone calls and letters<br/>
after TV programs...it&#39;s surprising how a little encouragement can make a<br/>
day.<br/>

newbies&quot; and those of us shoveling out the apparent pablum.<br/>
<br/>
Moving from a schooled mindset to unschooling is hard brave work. It&#39;s what<br/>
this list *does* and it has done for 42,000 posts. You obviously have no<br/>
respect for the hours any of us have been putting in helping others, nor<br/>
respect for the people who are trying to cut the ties to school.<br/>

and searching for answers thin gruel.<br/>
<br/>
There is room for a wide range of discussion, even about school and the harm<br/>
it does. There *isn&#39;t* room to go into *detail* about the politics of<br/>
schooling or government control. (We can point people to better forums for<br/>
that.) There *isn&#39;t* room for one person to seize control and turn it into a<br/>
soapbox for his personal agenda.<br/>

your out-of-place diatribes are the very ones who have contributed the most <br/>
useful information to this list since I&#39;ve been on it.<br/>
<br/>

to the choir here, and a good portion of the choir is damned sick of <br/>
listening to your sermons.  Why don&#39;t you take them where they might <br/>
actually do some good?<br/>

a bunch of others . . .and occasionally from Ned when he takes his own <br/>
advice and lives his life as if there were no schools.<br/>

This is a big, fat overgeneralizing lie.  I demand that you take it back.<br/>
<br/>
There are many long time posters on this list who do a great deal of<br/>
good.  The fact that they don&#39;t admire you is neither here nor there.<br/>
<br/>
Get over yourself!  Your behavior on this list has been despicable.<br/>
