&gt; yes, this definitely looks like a way to exert more control over your<br/>
&gt; children.  Isn&#39;t home -unschooling all about giving the kids the<br/>
&gt; control?<br/>

<br/>
  I hope not, but I do want my kids to take responsibility for their own educations.  It&#39;s my job to guide and help them to take charge of their own lives, figure out who they are and find their place in this world.<br/>
<br/>
  I do agree with you that I don&#39;t want any group or organization exerting control over my kids (or me) and telling them what they should do or who they should be.  I want my kids to have the freedom to discover themselves - that&#39;s what I think unschooling is supposed to be about.  Children still have to abide by the standards that individual families uphold and parents have to maintain that delicate balance until thekids are mature enough to do it on their own.  Easier said than done - huh? - especially for an unstructured, impulsive person like me! LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770577534">IMHO, it means being there like a safety net and allowing them to &quot;own&quot;<br/>
their own decisions.  It means being a helping hand and a guiding light<br/>
when needed.  It means growing a child that is responsible because they<br/>
have been responsible for their own education and goals since they were wee<br/>
ones even if they didn&#39;t realise that is what it was they were doing.<br/>
<br/>
In our house part of that responsibility means if mom paid for it because<br/>
you just had to have it, you finish it &lt;g&gt; which comes under the category<br/>
of &quot;boundaries,&quot; I would think.<br/>
