<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972549892">By the way my cat just sent mail to this list by walking across my keepboard. <br/>
 :)<br/>
<br/>
I have a soon to be 8 year old who is not reading.  It doesn&#39;t bother me <br/>
because I know he will want to learn when he is ready.  My oldest didn&#39;t learn <br/>
until he was 9 and learned very quickly at that time.  This is my youngest child <br/>
and he has been the youngest in many ways.  He has been slower to develope all <br/>
skills, has an explosive temperament, and usually he just needs time to make <br/>
up his own mind.  <br/>
My problem is this.  Other neighborhood children.  Unfortunately we live in a <br/>
neighborhood with many children.  My youngest is also very social.  They rib <br/>
him about his inability to read.  He turns it inward and decides he is stupid. <br/>
 I said I will help him anytime he wants me to and we have done stuff that he <br/>
wants as long as he wants.  He loves animals and that is the direction we go. <br/>
 Ranger Rick, National Geo, Crocodile hunter, whatever.  This is what he <br/>
loves and this is what we do.  He is very inquisitive and asks many profound <br/>
questions.  <br/>
My other problem is we live in NY state with all their stupid requirements.  <br/>
I manage to keep them happy, but sometimes I am afraid that some &quot;well <br/>
meaning&quot; person will decide that this is a case of educational neglect.  <br/>
I know of no other unschooler in my area,  I haven&#39;t funds to travel far and <br/>
while I am a Christian I find most of the Christians that are homeschoolers to <br/>
be very legalistic and very school at home type people. I am definitely not <br/>
of the Bob Jones, Abeka, or Bill Gothard persuasion which is predominant here. <br/>
Especially in this state.  I also find them very afraid to challenge the <br/>
status quo.  There are people who want to challenge the control of this state but <br/>
too many are afraid that they would lose freedom instead of gain it and many <br/>
believe that it is necessary to have control.  <br/>
I feel alone in this state and wish it was possible to go somewhere else at <br/>
times.  I used to live in Wash State years ago and our group consisted of all <br/>
types of homeschoolers.  We even had John Holt as a speaker one year.  I miss <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
So if you have responses to teach my son when other children make fun of him. <br/>
 Or any other advice I would appreciate it.  And if any of you live in <br/>
upstate NY, I would like to know.<br/>

Without mentioning it to your son, what about showing him repeating a <br/>
grade on whatever paperwork you file with the state?<br/>
<br/>
It seems that it would be harder for anyone to pressure you to show your <br/>
son is performing at &quot;third grade level&quot; if you list him as being in the <br/>
second grade.  (Apologies if I have calculated this wrong.)<br/>
<br/>
If other parents hassle me about my son&#39;s weaker areas I toss around <br/>
phrases like &quot;uneven development&quot; and &quot;customized learning&quot; and change <br/>
the subject to areas in which he excells.<br/>

you filing your IHIPs?<br/>
Always have a paper trail handy. Not too explicit but with just what <br/>
you need to prove<br/>
compliance.<br/>

Not just legally but culturally.<br/>

But unschoolers are hard to find, even in a place like NYC.<br/>

kids are very good at memorization,<br/>
not necessarily comprehension --and this goes well into college, may I <br/>
add. There are also many different<br/>
kinds of reading --signs, expressions, colors, actions. You can talk <br/>
about all the different kinds of reading<br/>
and different levels.<br/>

<br/>
I did that with my kids, and also told them stories of other people who had <br/>
learned something or other really well and early, but in the longrun weren&#39;t <br/>
particularly good at it.<br/>
<br/>
And I always told them about my friend Karen, the tallest girl I had ever <br/>
known, taller than the teacher, taller than all the boys in 4th grade.   We grew <br/>
up, I stopped comparing heights, boys got taller, I got taller, and I saw her <br/>
when I was in college and hadn&#39;t seen her for several years.  She was 5&#39;2&quot;.  <br/>
She might have been 5&#39;2&quot; in 4th grade, but she certainly stayed (overall) very <br/>
short.  They know kids themselves who are tall or short and then everything <br/>
changes.<br/>
<br/>
At this very moment, Holly is halfway through a Judy Blume novel, and is <br/>
wishing it wasn&#39;t so exciting, so she could sleep.   Her friend who is required to <br/>
read a chapter a day doesn&#39;t succeed in doing so.  Holly&#39;s started the third <br/>
chapter in half an hour.  But a year or so ago, Holly couldn&#39;t read a page of <br/>
print like that, with no pictures and no clues.<br/>
<br/>
Growth isn&#39;t scheduled and curves aren&#39;t smooth.  <br/>
Kids grow in fits and starts, spurts and rests.<br/>
