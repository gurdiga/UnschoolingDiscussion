<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681959434">Hi everyone!  My name is Robin and I began<br/>
homeschooling my 9yr. old son in early November.  He<br/>
had a very difficult time learning anything in public<br/>
school; at least it seemed that way to his father and<br/>
I.  His school days all became about his &quot;lack of<br/>
performance&quot; and his &quot;unsatisfactory behavior issues&quot;<br/>
due to his diagnosis of ADHD.  All of his teachers<br/>
have always said that he is a &quot;very intelligent child<br/>
who just seems to refuse to learn!&quot;  Urggghhh!  We<br/>
were spending so much time at night helping him learn<br/>
what he didnt in school and he excelled at home in the<br/>
very areas the school said he was far behind in that I<br/>
began to feel I could do a way better job than the<br/>
school had done thusfar.  And I would enjoy it too. :)<br/>
<br/>
 Anyway, after having read book after book on the<br/>
subject of homseschooling I finally decided that we<br/>
would probably end up taking an eclectic approach to<br/>
homeschooling, leaning more predominantly towards<br/>
unschooling.  Since I have joined this unschooling<br/>
discussion list however, I find that I really knew<br/>
very little about what unschooling really is; what it<br/>
really looks like.  I am still trying to find my way<br/>
and decide if unschooling, as I see it here portrayed,<br/>
is going to be the way to go for us.  I still have<br/>
much to learn.  Right now my son has an aversion to<br/>
anything that might come close to &quot;education&quot;,<br/>
&quot;school&quot;, and &quot;learning&quot;.  I have tried to just relax<br/>
with him and get him relaxed.  I am trying to help him<br/>
appreciate that he learns all the time everyday.  Im<br/>
not sure how long a time the deschooling process takes<br/>
and wonder about that too. (I know it probably differs<br/>
from child to child) I have been taking him on field<br/>
trips, reading alot with him which he loves and<br/>
letting him just be.  He prefers to sleep in until<br/>
11am or so, play video games, read and complain alot<br/>
about how bored he is. :)  <br/>
<br/>
 My question is this:  The state of Washington has a<br/>
relatively lenient policy on homeschooling, however<br/>
they do require an annual non-test assessment or<br/>
standardized test.  Since these tests are, im<br/>
assuming, going to be covering the 11 subject area<br/>
requirements Wa. insists you cover each year, how does<br/>
your child ever pass, for lack of a better word, if he<br/>
is being unschooled?  If your child refuses to learn<br/>
math, history, science, etc. and those are the things<br/>
the test covers how will he fare?  Is he going to feel<br/>
like a failure because he knew very little to nothing<br/>
covered in the test?  Tests were about the hardest<br/>
thing for my son; he always came home feeling hopeless<br/>
and stupid because he would freeze up and either not<br/>
finish in time or feel he had done very poorly.  Do<br/>
unschoolers see these tests as useless, meaningless<br/>
and just a formality to go through in order to keep<br/>
the government happy but promptly ignore them once<br/>
they are over?  I am asking these things because I<br/>
sincerely want to know, want to understand, and want<br/>
the best for my son, like all of us here.   <br/>
<br/>
 Through the parent qualifying course I had to take<br/>
and all of my reading it has always been stressed that<br/>
there is no one right way to homeschool; you just have<br/>
to find the one that most comfortably fits your family<br/>
style and beliefs.  So I am trying to determine if<br/>
unschooling is the way for my family to go.  Like I<br/>
said, I have so much to learn. While I like most of<br/>
what I have heard about unschooling, the issue of the<br/>
yearly test just stumps me.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you very much for any responses and help.<br/>
<br/>
 Sincerely, Robin<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
Maybe he would appreciate it better if you said &quot;Just take the rest of the  <br/>
year off, and we&#39;ll discuss again in August what we want to do.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
While he thinks it&#39;s just time off, you could work on seeing how natural  <br/>
learning can work.<br/>
I would advise keeping him out of it.  He doesn&#39;t need to know how  <br/>
unschooling works right now.  He needs to veg out, play games, do art,  build Lego, <br/>
play with the dog, or your local equivalent of all that.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
Since before I was ever unschooling at all, people&#39;ve said one month for  <br/>
every year of school.   Problem is, that goes for moms too.  So  while a kid <br/>
might be all recovered in a few months, the mom is likely to keep  NOT getting it, <br/>
unless she puts some concerted effort into moving toward it all  the time.<br/>
 <br/>
For instance &quot;field trips&quot;--field as opposed to what?<br/>
Field trip is a school-term, for a once-a-year foray into the real  world.   <br/>
There can&#39;t really be a &quot;field trip&quot; from real life.<br/>
 <br/>

Here&#39;s an article on boredom.  It&#39;s short and (I think)  painless:<br/>

 <br/>
Standardized tests will never cover 11 subject areas.  They cover  reading <br/>
and math and maybe grammar.  IF they have a science or history  section, that <br/>
too will be reading (read this passage and answer some multiple  choice <br/>
questions, or read each question and pick the least ridiculous  answer).<br/>
 <br/>
But non-test assessment might mean saying &quot;Reads better, visited twelve  <br/>
interesting places and six museums, built a castle out of gingerbread. . .   <br/>
whatever all.  Might be less than that.  Might involve hiring someone  to meet with <br/>
him a while and note that he seems fine for his age.  Ask  unschoolers where <br/>
you are, though, instead of assuming what tests are  like.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- If your child refuses to learn<br/>
math, history, science, etc. and  those are the things<br/>

 <br/>
&quot;Refuses to learn&quot; can&#39;t happen with unschooling.<br/>
When learning is fun and natural, kids learn without thinking about  it.<br/>
 <br/>
If parents refuse to learn how unschooling works, though, homeschooling can  <br/>
be so frustrating for the whole family that a child ends up back in  school.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling can be really, really wonderful, but it does involve a change  of <br/>
attitude and awareness for the parents.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Is he going to feel<br/>
like a failure because he knew very little to  nothing<br/>
covered in the test?-=-<br/>
 <br/>
My kids never took a test.  When Kirby took accuplacer tests at 18, he  did <br/>
pretty well.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
You don&#39;t want to give him other opportunity to feel hopeless and stupid  and <br/>
freeze up and do poorly, do you?  If testing is an option, don&#39;t take  that <br/>
option.  If testing at home is an option, read this:<br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tests_">http://sandradodd.com/tests_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tests)">http://sandradodd.com/tests)</a> <br/>

unschoolers see these tests as useless, meaningless<br/>
and just a  formality to go through in order to keep<br/>
the government happy but promptly  ignore them once<br/>
they are over? -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Everyone sees them that way, not just unschoolers.<br/>
How else can they be seen?  <br/>
Well, they can be seen as cutthroat competition, or as an exercise totally  <br/>
separate from evidence that the knowledge dwells in the test subjects in any  <br/>
useful form.  Some people &quot;test well&quot; whether they know the material at  all.  <br/>
Some people don&#39;t test well under any circumstances.  <br/>
 <br/>
They are meaningless formalities, pretty much.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I am asking these things because I<br/>
sincerely want to know, want to  understand, and want<br/>

 <br/>
We don&#39;t all want the same things.  For some people, &quot;best&quot; means  learning <br/>
obedience and fitting in with the other kids at soccer.  For some,  it means <br/>
being advanced academically, to impress the grandparents and to flip  off the <br/>
aunts and uncles.  For some people &quot;best&quot; means most at  peace.<br/>

<br/>
Have you read the law?  Children are not required to pass anything.  The test/assessment is for the parent to judge progress (as if we need a test for that, but that is what the law says).  I&#39;ve never asked my children to take standardized tests.  I use the assessment option through familylearning.org.  (Just one way to do it.  There are other ways, but I find FLO non-intrusive and reasonably affordable.)  <br/>

take place all the time, in a variety of different<br/>
ways.  I havent shared with him the ins and outs of<br/>
unschooling vs any other kind of homeschooling.  He is<br/>
just being relaxed right now.  I realize learning<br/>

and likes that term.  It is one of the few school<br/>
terms if you will that he loves and so in the name of<br/>
his comfort level I too refer and will continue to<br/>
refer to them as field trips. :)  And in the sense of<br/>
leaving home and traveling afield so to speak it is<br/>
actually not a misnomer at all.  Yes, I realize you<br/>
can go no farther than your own backyard to have<br/>
wonderful times as well.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote> Short or long, it makes no difference to me; Im an<br/>
avid reader.  Thanks very much for the article.  I<br/>
look forward to reading it.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Standardized tests will never cover 11 subject<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> I based my assumption on a few different responses<br/>
from other homeschoolers, ex-unschoolers and a couple<br/>
of teachers in my area.  I guess in the sense that<br/>
they read a passage that may pertain to social studies<br/>
or science, etc. it is in fact touching on most of the<br/>
11 subjects.  But given the climate of fear there is<br/>
in my area regarding unschooling my question I thought<br/>
was a valid, intelligent one and who better to ask<br/>
than actual unschoolers who Im sure only want to<br/>
welcome prospective unschoolers and allay their fears.<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But non-test assessment might mean saying &quot;Reads<br/>

 </span></blockquote> It might mean all of those things...that is why I was<br/>
hoping to hear from someone who had taken the various<br/>
types of mandatory tests so I could know what to<br/>
expect beforehand, not after.  And again, I based my<br/>
assumptions on the info I had already been given.  And<br/>
then lest I was steered wrong, I inquired further on<br/>
this friendly list. :) <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=- If your child refuses to learn<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Well again, that is why I am availing myself of this<br/>
wonderful list, so that I might learn more about it<br/>
beyond what I have heard shared with me and the books<br/>
read on the subject.  I dont see anyone refusing to<br/>
learn.<br/>

appears to be an entire way of life as opposed to a<br/>
style of teaching.  Do unschoolers feel that it is the<br/>
only way to homeschool successfully?  Or that it is<br/>
the best, right way to go about it?  Or like<br/>
everything I have heard thusfar, there are many ways<br/>
to go about homeschooling and unschooling is just one<br/>
of them?  No one right way, just what works for each<br/>
individual family? <br/>

all.  So I guess you are going to have to amend your<br/>
earlier assertion that everyone sees them that way and<br/>
that that is the only way they can be seen.<br/>

pretty much everything I have written even though I<br/>

understanding?<br/>
 I think I stand by my earlier statement, we all want<br/>
what is best for our children.  I didnt say for me or<br/>
his father or his grandparents...I simply said for my<br/>
son.  Is it not fair to say that you too want what is<br/>

that the &quot;test results&quot;, for that is how it is worded,<br/>
are only given to the parent and not passed on to<br/>
anyone else.  But by virtue of calling them test<br/>
results it implies that there will be some form of<br/>
measuring your childs progress or lack thereof.  The<br/>
law also reads that if your child appears to be<br/>
lacking in any area then that area will be pointed out<br/>
so that the parent can make a concerted effort to<br/>
rectify the situation and bring the child up to speed<br/>
in that area or areas.  I too will go with the<br/>
non-assessment test as I have heard it is less<br/>
stressful, etc.  But even with that it still is a<br/>
measuring yardstick of your child and your progress in<br/>
homeschooling.  At least that is what a teacher who<br/>
gives the assessment has said.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but I have yet to find a way<br/>
&gt; to have him &quot;learn&quot; math in a fun way he will go for.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rather than looking at math and trying to figure out how to get it into him,<br/>
look and him and notice how he reaches out and uses math.<br/>
<br/>
Math is one tool we use to get what we want: to figure out if we have enough<br/>
money, how long until Dad gets home, how long until we can save up for<br/>
something, which item is a better deal, how many more battles until we can<br/>
move up a level in a video game.<br/>
<br/>
Math is probably the hardest &quot;subject&quot; to let go of because learning math<br/>
naturally by living -- basically figuring out how numbers work -- looks so<br/>
totally different -- and inadequate! -- compared to school math. But once<br/>
you see a child manipulating numbers in his head because he understands how<br/>
numbers can be morphed to make the answer he wants come out, then you can<br/>
start to understand what &quot;unschooling math&quot; really is.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do unschoolers feel that it is the<br/>
&gt; only way to homeschool successfully?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on your meaning of success.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent&#39;s goal is to get their child into Harvard, is unschooling the<br/>
only (or best) way? No. In fact unschooling would be a poor way to meet that<br/>
goal.<br/>
<br/>
(Though unschooled kids do get into Harvard. The difference is that it&#39;s the<br/>
child&#39;s goal to go, not the parent&#39;s. The child reachs out and prepares<br/>
himself because that&#39;s what he wants rather than the parent pushing what she<br/>
thinks is necessary into the child.)<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers generally have different goals than most people. Unschoolers<br/>
aren&#39;t trying to shape their kids into being the best they can be (or<br/>
however a parent words it). Unschoolers are trying to help their kids be who<br/>
they already are.<br/>
<br/>
So neither curriculum or unit studies or eclectic homeschooling or any of<br/>
the other homeschooling methods are going to move an unschooling parent<br/>
towards that goal.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or like<br/>
&gt; everything I have heard thusfar, there are many ways<br/>
&gt; to go about homeschooling and unschooling is just one<br/>
&gt; of them?  No one right way, just what works for each<br/>
&gt; individual family?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on your goals. Depends on your priorities.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is very relationship oriented. It&#39;s about being a child&#39;s<br/>
partner in the child&#39;s exploration of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Other methods are more oriented towards helping a parent get what a parent<br/>
wants into a child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think I stand by my earlier statement, we all want<br/>
&gt; what is best for our children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think Sandra&#39;s point in pulling this out is to help you see that while<br/>
wanting what&#39;s best for our children may be true of all &quot;good&quot; parents on<br/>
the surface, not all parents define best the same way. So if we assume we<br/>
all want &quot;what&#39;s best&quot; and go about talking about &quot;what&#39;s best&quot;, people will<br/>
think they&#39;re all talking about the same thing but some may be defining best<br/>
as obedience to God, getting a child into Harvard, helping a child be happy,<br/>
turning the child into a well rounded person, helping a child be kind and so<br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t one way to get to all those definitions of &quot;best&quot;! In fact some<br/>
ways will be incompatible with some definitions.<br/>
<br/>
So it will help you help yourself better if you think about what you mean by<br/>
&quot;best for your child&quot;. What do you want to give him or help him get? (And an<br/>
unschooler will ask, what does your son want? And how can you help him get<br/>
that? :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sorry, I dont perceive all tests as cutthroat<br/>
&gt; competion or as useless.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually your original question wasn&#39;t about all tests but &quot;these tests&quot;,<br/>
the state required tests.<br/>
<br/>
So in answer to your question:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do<br/>
&gt; unschoolers see these tests as useless, meaningless<br/>
&gt; and just a  formality to go through in order to keep<br/>
&gt; the government happy but promptly  ignore them once<br/>
&gt; they are over?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s kind of a sticky, tricky question! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unschooler&quot; is a self applied label rather than a title given to those who<br/>
fully get unschooling. So people who call themselves unschoolers can still<br/>
have all sorts of school-think baggage that they&#39;re working on getting rid<br/>
of. So it&#39;s hard to answer questions in terms of &quot;Do unschoolers think ...?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more helpful to think in terms of what ideas help people unschool and<br/>
what ideas don&#39;t help.<br/>
<br/>
People who really &quot;get&quot; unschooling understand the meaninglessness of the<br/>
state mandated tests.<br/>
<br/>
Getting to and really understanding why the tests are meaningless will help<br/>
someone get unschooling.<br/>

was a valid, intelligent one and who better to ask<br/>
than actual unschoolers who Im sure only want to<br/>
welcome prospective unschoolers and allay their fears.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Is there a valid reason that there is a climate of fear surrounding<br/>
unschooling in your area?<br/>
<br/>
Has someone you know been prosecuted for failing to meet the requirements?<br/>
If they have, do you <br/>
<br/>
Know the details or is it hearsay?  I am wondering if there was a case and<br/>
if the case was justified.  <br/>
<br/>
Was there really educational neglect?  Was there abuse?  Do you really need<br/>
to worry about the government <br/>
<br/>
Coming a knocking on your door?  What things in your life are similar to<br/>
theirs?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It might mean all of those things...that is why I was<br/>

types of mandatory tests so I could know what to<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you need to find a different teacher/reviewer because the<br/>
laws of your state sound similar to mine and it&#39;s very easy to meet the<br/>
requirements depending on who you have for a teacher.  If they expect a<br/>
curriculum to be done cover to cover, then they aren&#39;t the evaluator for me.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think Sandra was trying to be helpful. To help you see things from the<br/>
perspective of a person who has been unschooling for a long time,<br/>
successfully.  Maybe you could try to re-read what she wrote and picture her<br/>
writing it with a joyful tone in her voice, someone honestly trying to help<br/>
you get it.<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well give me time..remember I am new at this as we<br/>
all were once upon a time but I have yet to find a way<br/>
to have him &quot;learn&quot; math in a fun way he will go for.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So do you not want people to point out how they can help you get to<br/>
unschooling quicker?  Would you rather not have input?   If you do want<br/>
input, continue asking questions and reading here.  Sometimes it isn&#39;t very<br/>
comfortable to have people respond to you when they are suggesting different<br/>
ways to do things or different ways to think about something.   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Math is in life all around us.  It just doesn&#39;t look like school math.  You<br/>
don&#39;t need to find a way for him to learn math in a fun way, you just need<br/>
to see how he uses math already in real life. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

beyond what I have heard shared with me and the books<br/>
read on the subject.  I dont see anyone refusing to<br/>
learn.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Some people come here and ask lots of questions and get great responses and<br/>
then spend hours of their time justifying what they already do.  They aren&#39;t<br/>
looking to really get it or they just can&#39;t seem to get past what 13+ years<br/>
of schooling has caused them believe about learning.  (That it&#39;s difficult<br/>
and unpleasant and something you have to make humans do.) It&#39;s too<br/>
uncomfortable for some people to have the level of trust in the learning<br/>
process that it takes to unschool.<br/>

appears to be an entire way of life as opposed to a<br/>
style of teaching. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Absolutely.  It is a way of life.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Do unschoolers feel that it is the<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That depends on your definition of success.  My goal is to have happy,<br/>
healthy, confident children that believe in their abilities and that know<br/>
that the world is theirs for the discovering.  I am here to help them get<br/>
what they want.  I think the best way to reach that goal is through<br/>
unschooling. If I didn&#39;t think unschooling was the best way to reach that<br/>
goal, I wouldn&#39;t be doing it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

of them?  No one right way, just what works for each<br/>
individual family? &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Unschoooling is the only respectful way to homeschool in my opinion.  When<br/>
you sit a child/person down and tell them what they have to do to be<br/>
successful and then grade them on it, it isn&#39;t very respectful of them.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;Well, Im happy for you and Kirby.  Unfortunately, my<br/>

&gt;standardized test or non-test assessment.  It isnt<br/>

can keep a log book of what he has done.  No testing required.  <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If my kids had to take tests, that is exactly how I would see them.  But we<br/>
have a portfolio option similar to yours.  I can bring a log of what they<br/>
have done or even just talk about what they have done and still have the<br/>
paperwork signed.  It really depends on the attitude of the teacher.  Keep<br/>
looking until you find one you like.  Other unschoolers in your state can<br/>
help you with this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We don&#39;t all want the same things.  For some people,<br/>

&gt; soccer.  For some,  it means <br/>

pretty much everything I have written even though I<br/>
have written my queries out of a sincere desire to<br/>

understanding?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>

had read here for a while before you posted, you would have seen Sandra&#39;s<br/>
writing style and maybe not been so offended by what she wrote.  This isn&#39;t<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you feel that something that is written here doesn&#39;t pertain to you, then<br/>

I didn&#39;t know that any states required you to have college under your belt<br/>

I can to help them find out things, or do things that interest them.  It&#39;s a <br/>
whirlwind at times.  Sometimes interests fly by at break-neck speed, others <br/>
linger for long periods of time.  I help them with resources.  I don&#39;t know what <br/>
it is like to unschool an older, and maybe more independent child.  Right now <br/>
we are very close because I am their door-opener, researcher, etc.  But in all <br/>
of that, they are learning so much and finding ways to open doors and <br/>
research on their own.<br/>
<br/>
I still have &quot;schoolie&quot; stuff floating about my head and wonder if I&#39;ll ever <br/>
be rid of it.   But it&#39;s easy most of the time because I make it all about <br/>
them and not about me.  I&#39;d love to see them become successful, happy, secure <br/>
adults.  But that could be anything to THEM.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling, to me, is a huge concept.  It means many, many things.  I think <br/>
I have a lot of it and yet there is still so much to do and learn.<br/>

slogan to any other lifestyle. ALL others think of learning as <br/>
something that happens when teaching is going on and that there are <br/>
times to learn and times of not learning. Unschoolers do not think of <br/>

takes an intensity and focus on living life with a great deal of gusto <br/>
and that a lot of people don&#39;t have that. I also think that the parents <br/>
have to have a certain level of sensitivity to their children to know <br/>
what to offer, when to support, when to back off, how busy they want to <br/>
be, how much solitude they need, when to nudge them a bit with <br/>
encouragement, when to get more involved, etc. AND parents need to be <br/>
able to always have their kids and their interests in the back of their <br/>
minds, thinking always about what would interest them and bringing the <br/>
world to them and them to the world in ways that &quot;click&quot; for that <br/>
particular child. It takes willingness to have important midnight <br/>
conversations and to scoop worms out of the ground and keep them on <br/>
your kitchen counter and to trust as your child takes her first train <br/>
ride alone and on and on. I don&#39;t think it is right for everybody and I <br/>
think there are kids better off with other kinds of homeschooling <br/>
because their PARENTS aren&#39;t able or willing to put the energy into <br/>
unschooling that I think it needs.<br/>

of teaching experience and I know, deep down inside, that any coercion <br/>
in learning creates either active resistance, passivity, or apathy and <br/>
I don&#39;t want to create any of those in my children. Learning feels good <br/>
- it might be hard, but it is also pleasurable. Coercion feels bad and <br/>
trying to learn under coercion is not pleasurable. Children who have <br/>
only experienced the pleasure of unforced learning have an entirely <br/>
different approach to life - they have not developed resistance, <br/>
passivity, or apathy and it shows in their incredible creativity, <br/>
confidence, intensity, focus, persistence, self-knowledge, and personal <br/>
responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Not all parents WANT their children to grow up strong-willed and truly <br/>
independent-minded. Many parents mostly want their children to respect <br/>
them and to adopt their beliefs and goals. Many parents have a <br/>
definition of &quot;success&quot; already in their own heads and what they want <br/>
is for their children to achieve success as they define it. Many want <br/>
their children to offer living proof that they were good parents - <br/>
they&#39;re especially interested in outcomes that will impress friends, <br/>
relatives, and acquaintances.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers have different goals that impact our day-to-day <br/>
interactions with our kids. We want our children to discover their <br/>
life&#39;s passions and to jump into them with both feet, with confidence <br/>
and trust in life and themselves. We want our children to know, deep <br/>
inside themselves, that they are strong and capable and can make their <br/>
own individual choices. We want them to be willing to buck the <br/>
mainstream culture AND buck the counterculture and think for themselves <br/>
and do what they think is right and good and worthy and valuable.<br/>
<br/>
I think, most of all, we want them to love being alive - now and in <br/>
their future.</div>

&lt;&lt; Unschoolers generally have different goals than most people. Unschoolers<br/>
aren&#39;t trying to shape their kids into being the best they can be (or<br/>
however a parent words it). Unschoolers are trying to help their kids be who<br/>
they already are.<br/>

or the best in-his-parents&#39;-image he could be, but those compromises can come <br/>
with longterm longing for what was lost.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote> Well, Im happy for you and Kirby.  Unfortunately, my<br/>
laws say that my child has to have either an annual<br/>
standardized test or non-test assessment.  It isnt<br/>
optional.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
An assessment isn&#39;t a test.  You do have options.<br/>
State law in New Mexico required tests in 3rd, 5th and 8th, when Kirby was <br/>
little.  They changed it to 4th, 6th and 8th grades.  Still, Kirby never took a <br/>
test.<br/>
Many New Mexico homeschoolers found options and their children weren&#39;t tested.<br/>
Others bought a test to administer at home and didn&#39;t administer it so close <br/>
to the directions that it could change their relationship with their child <br/>
into one involving numbers and measurements.<br/>
<br/>
We live in a cul-de-sac and since the 1970&#39;s cars park nose in to the curb <br/>
here (we&#39;ve only been here seven years, but others let us in on the deal).  The <br/>
law says parallel to the curb.   That would allow the or four cars t<br/>
Zo park.  Nose in allows ten or so.  <br/>
<br/>
We could accept that &quot;we have no option,&quot; but the option has been that if no <br/>
one in this small set of houses complains, we&#39;re all better off doing it this <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
When my friend visited in his police car, he had to park parallel, but when <br/>
he comes in his own car he parks nose in.<br/>
<br/>
Some people prefer rules and measures to flexibility and creativity, and for <br/>
them unschooling might be too stressful.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I think I stand by my earlier statement, we all want<br/>
what is best for our children.  I didnt say for me or<br/>
his father or his grandparents...I simply said for my<br/>
son.  Is it not fair to say that you too want what is<br/>
best for your children?  Im sure it is. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re defending your original statements without wanting to think <br/>
about other input.<br/>
<br/>
Did your grandparents know what was best for your mom?  Your dad?<br/>
<br/>
Did your parents know what was best for you?<br/>
<br/>
Do I know what&#39;s best for Kirby? Marty?  Holly?<br/>
<br/>
For some reasons (we don&#39;t need to know, and you already know) you&#39;ve moved <br/>
toward homeschooling.  For some reasons you&#39;re interested in finding out more <br/>
about unschooling.  For some reasons, you&#39;re resistent to input.   That&#39;s okay, <br/>
and you don&#39;t need to defend yourself or argue about it, but it would <br/>
probably help the future of the learning project you&#39;re embarking on for you to try <br/>
to think about why you&#39;re defensive.  You don&#39;t have to tell us a bit of it.<br/>
<br/>
Howard Gardner has a book called Frames of Mind, about multiple <br/>
intelligences.  I think it would be a great read for you, and you don&#39;t have to read every <br/>
word, but you can jump and skim.  Others have taken those ideas and taken them <br/>
toward education, therapy, and personnel/business management, so if you go to <br/>
google and put in <br/>
        multiple intelligence theory gardner <br/>
you&#39;ll probably get lots of sites that would give you the idea without even <br/>
needing to get the book.<br/>
<br/>
It will help you as you&#39;re thinking about what you believe about standardized <br/>
tests, too, as it&#39;s immediately applicable to that.<br/>
<br/>
But two of his intelligences are described as interpersonal and <br/>
intrapersonal.   Some people have a natural talent for interpersonal awareness, for reading <br/>
other people and seeing what they might need or fear or enjoy.   Some people <br/>
have a similar talent (but Gardner considers it a separate intelligence) for <br/>
self-reflective thought and self awareness.   <br/>
<br/>
Both of those are benefits to unschooling situations.<br/>
<br/>
As an avid reader, you could soak that all up in just a few days and it could <br/>
make a difference in the rest of your life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-241110832"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But by virtue of calling them test results it implies that there will be some form of measuring your child&#39;s progress or lack thereof.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, tests *claim* to measure the child, but the measuring device is a school one, and invalid and ineffective at that.  My children don&#39;t go to school and don&#39;t need to measure up in that world.  What child does not progress from one year to the next?  It&#39;s an absurd premise.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;The law also reads that if your child appears to be lacking in any area then that area will be pointed out so that the parent can make a concerted effort to rectify the situation and bring the child up to speed in that area or areas&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where are you reading the law?  It says, &quot;The state board of education shall not require these children to meet the student learning goals, master the essential academic learning requirements,...&quot;     &quot;If, as a result of the annual test or assessment, it is determined that the child is not making reasonable progress consistent with his or her age or stage of development, the parent shall make a good faith effort to remedy any deficiency.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a stickler for being precise in what our law says vs. how people interpret it.  We don&#39;t even have legal homeschooling in WA.  We have children who are &quot;receiving home-based instruction&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I too will go with the non-assessment test as I have heard it is less stressful, etc.  But even with that it still is a measuring yardstick of your child and your progress in homeschooling.  At least that is what a teacher who gives the assessment has said.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know any teachers IRL who understand unschooling well enough to do an assessment.  This is one reason I do my assessments through FLO.  They do not read anything into the law&#39;s stated purpose of doing the assessment.  They do what the law requires and no more.  *I* do the assessment.  My children do not even need to be aware of it.  It does not measure them in any way.<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I based my assumption on a few different responses from other homeschoolers, ex-unschoolers and a couple of teachers in my area.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are asking the wrong people.  Would you ask someone who roller-skates for advice on snowboarding?  Would you ask someone who quit breastfeeding after a month or two for breastfeeding advice?  Teachers study school, not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But given the climate of fear there is in my area regarding unschooling&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

&gt;  Unlike any other homeschooling method unschooling<br/>
&gt; appears to be an entire way of life as opposed to a<br/>
&gt; style of teaching.<br/>
<br/>
True. Life is learning, learning is life - you really can&#39;t apply that <br/>
slogan to any other lifestyle. ALL others think of learning as <br/>
something that happens when teaching is going on and that there are <br/>
times to learn and times of not learning. Unschoolers do not think of <br/>
life and learning as two separate things. &quot;I live therefore I learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Do unschoolers feel that it is the<br/>
&gt; only way to homeschool successfully?<br/>
<br/>
No. In fact, I don&#39;t think it is a good way for everybody. I think it <br/>
takes an intensity and focus on living life with a great deal of gusto <br/>
and that a lot of people don&#39;t have that. I also think that the parents <br/>
have to have a certain level of sensitivity to their children to know <br/>
what to offer, when to support, when to back off, how busy they want to <br/>
be, how much solitude they need, when to nudge them a bit with <br/>
encouragement, when to get more involved, etc. AND parents need to be <br/>
able to always have their kids and their interests in the back of their <br/>
minds, thinking always about what would interest them and bringing the <br/>
world to them and them to the world in ways that &quot;click&quot; for that <br/>
particular child. It takes willingness to have important midnight <br/>
conversations and to scoop worms out of the ground and keep them on <br/>
your kitchen counter and to trust as your child takes her first train <br/>
ride alone and on and on. I don&#39;t think it is right for everybody and I <br/>
think there are kids better off with other kinds of homeschooling <br/>
because their PARENTS aren&#39;t able or willing to put the energy into <br/>
unschooling that I think it needs.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Or that it is the best, right way to go about it?  Or like<br/>
&gt; everything I have heard thusfar, there are many ways<br/>
&gt; to go about homeschooling and unschooling is just one<br/>
&gt; of them?  No one right way, just what works for each<br/>
&gt; individual family?<br/>
<br/>
We could do the curriculum - I could insist on a few hours of day of <br/>
&quot;school work,&quot; insisting that my children do it. But I&#39;ve read <br/>
everything I could get my hands on about learning and I&#39;ve had 30 years <br/>

In Tennessee, in order to homeschool a child of high school age, you <br/>
must have a Bachelor&#39;s degree. The only legal way around it is to use a <br/>
satellite school, then you are technically a private school student. <br/>
right now the law is also very unfair to non Christian homeschoolers <br/>
because most Satellite schools operate under the Jeter Memorandum which <br/>

<br/>
I hope that too. I hope that people will simply get tired of throwing money into a bottomless pit that produces nothing but pain and apathy. I hope that our passionate, fascinating, exciting children&#39;s childhoods will be seen as worthwhile---and that they will be seen as pioneers in *real* education.<br/>

 <br/>
It has been looked into.  You have to have a physical church that is  willing <br/>
to do it, AND the entity has to be accredited by certain accrediting  <br/>
agencies that are either too strict (South Central Association of Schools and  <br/>
Colleges), or are closed certain-kind-of-Christian associations set up  specifically <br/>
to provide accrediting for these &quot;church-related&quot; schools.<br/>
 <br/>
So far, no one with enough money has worked to fight it or change it or  open <br/>
a church school.  And there are umbrella schools where you can &quot;get  around&quot; <br/>
not being a Christian, if you know the right words to say.  So,  it&#39;s just not <br/>
an issue, yet.  I think eventually it will be, though.   I don&#39;t believe <br/>
virtual charter schools have arrived in Tennessee, yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-476874625">I think all people should have the legal right to homeschool their <br/>
children if they choose to do so. The problem with the Tennessee law is <br/>
the way it is stated the school has to be accredited by certain <br/>
organizations in order to be recognized. The following link gives a bit <br/>
more info. I guess the thing that bothers me the most is I feel like I <br/>
am taking advantage of a legal loophole that is restricted to someone <br/>
who does not choose Christianity.<br/>
