<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170218792">So my neighbor...who used to homeschool in a very school-at-home way,  was<br/>
telling me about her son.  He&#39;s in 9th grade....and flunking miserably -<br/>
academically and socially.  (they sent him to school because he *needs* to<br/>
be exposed to other teens for *socialization* IMHO,  they&#39;ve fed him to the<br/>
wolves)<br/>
<br/>
She was telling me he somehow managed to get a perfect score on a math test.<br/>
This is decicedly his most challenging subject.  His *reward*????<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t have to do his math homework that week!!!<br/>
<br/>
His mother was a bit taken aback at my response......gee,  that&#39;ll really<br/>
reinforce that working math problems is a torture one must try to get out of<br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
What are these people/schools/parents thinking??<br/>
<br/>
Susan,  so grateful to be outside of that box</div>
