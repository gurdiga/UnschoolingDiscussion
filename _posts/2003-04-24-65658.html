<div id="ygrps-yiv-442732256">wasn&#39;t it Einstein who didn&#39;t talk until 4 or something? My 2 1/2 year old seemed to me to not be talking nearly as much as the other kids her age. However around 19-20 months she had a real verbal growth spurt and started saying lots of things. My doctor (who I really like and trust, and I hope you like yours) told me to relax a little and that made me feel better. Maybe you could talk to your doctor? Good luck, Kelli  mommy to Molly 10, Sadie 2 and Nora 5 months. <br/>

My brother didn&#39;t talk at all until he was 3, and didn&#39;t talk clearly enough to be understood by anyone outside the family until he was 5. My mother worried about it endlessly, but he just didn&#39;t do it until he was ready.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059688547">My first son wasn&#39;t talking when he was 21 months.  Or two years.  Or<br/>
two and a half years.  And when I&#39;d ask about it online, people would<br/>
tell me about genius children who never talked and then spoke full<br/>
sentences.  <br/>
<br/>
Little kids at the park, much smaller than my son, spoke in full<br/>
sentences.  (It did *not* help that he&#39;s very tall for his age -- he&#39;s<br/>
not quite five now and taller than many eight and nine year olds).  The<br/>
whole thing made me want to stay home and cry.  <br/>
<br/>
Actually, I cried a lot.  And I was scared.  And I didn&#39;t want to take<br/>
him to a government-sponsored speech therapy program because he&#39;s such a<br/>
sensitive person that I knew he wouldn&#39;t survive public school, and I<br/>
was afraid that if he got a diagnosis I wouldn&#39;t be allowed to<br/>
homeschool.  I couldn&#39;t afford private speech therapy.  <br/>
<br/>
I felt like a failure as a parent.  I mean, I put so much effort into<br/>
parenting, and he couldn&#39;t talk!  There are people who put absolutely no<br/>
effort into parenting and ignore their kids all day while they watch<br/>
talk shows, and their kids learn how to talk.  <br/>
<br/>
What happened was not a miracle.  He didn&#39;t just wake up one morning<br/>
quoting Shakespeare.  His first clear word was &quot;apple&quot;, at the age of<br/>
three.  Then he started saying &quot;kee ka&quot;, which turned out to be &quot;kitty<br/>
cat&quot;.  It was a long, hard struggle for him to talk and to get his point<br/>
across clearly.  He didn&#39;t speak clearly enough for outsiders to<br/>
completely understand him under he was four, maybe a little older.  But<br/>
he was making progress everyday, so I knew it would be ok.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s about to turn five at the end of May, and he speaks clearly and<br/>
intelligently.  His vocabulary keeps impressing people, and he&#39;s lately<br/>
begun correcting his own grammar.<br/>
<br/>
I never thought I&#39;d say this, but sometimes I wish he&#39;d stop talking for<br/>
just a minute.  From the minute he wakes up, until long after the rest<br/>
of the family is asleep, he never stops.  And most of that is a barrage<br/>
of questions.  One night he came into the bedroom after I&#39;d been asleep<br/>
and started asking, &quot;Where do the Care Bears live?&quot;  &quot;Care-a-lot.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Isn&#39;t that in the clouds?&quot;  &quot;Yes.&quot;  &quot;Don&#39;t airplanes fly in the<br/>
clouds?&quot;  &quot;Mm-hmm.&quot;  &quot;Do you need a ticket to go on an airplane?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Mm-hmm.&quot;  &quot;Ok, mom, you go back to sleep.  I&#39;m going to go out the<br/>
front door and walk to the airport and buy a ticket so I can fly up to<br/>
Care-a-lot.&quot;  &quot;WHAT???!!&quot;  This is what I mean about wishing he&#39;d stop<br/>
talking for a minute now and then.  Late at night, I don&#39;t listen as<br/>
carefully as I should because I&#39;m trying to fall back to sleep, and you<br/>
have to listen carefully to someone like him, because he&#39;s always making<br/>
plans. <br/>
<br/>
If I knew then how well he&#39;d be speaking now, I would have saved myself<br/>
a ton of stress.  I don&#39;t know anyone who spoke as late as my son (all<br/>
the other late stories seemed to end with, &quot;and then when he was three<br/>
he said, &quot;Mother, what are your feelings about this presidential<br/>
administration?&quot;  Or some other genius thing.  My son was a late speaker<br/>
who started at the beginning and took a long time to catch up). <br/>
<br/>
 If I&#39;d known some of the intelligent things he&#39;d say, I wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
secretly wondered if he was, well, not smart (he also had &quot;issues&quot; where<br/>
he didn&#39;t play with toys the &quot;right&quot; way -- his mind works differently<br/>
than other kids.  For example, he never figured out the shape sorter and<br/>
I finally threw it away in frustration).  His mind still works<br/>
differently than most people&#39;s, but now I realize that it&#39;s his greatest<br/>
gift, and he may never be a genius, but the way his mind works humbles<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also glad every day that I didn&#39;t take him to a specialist because I<br/>
know with his temperament and unusual way of thinking, combined with the<br/>
speech delay, there would have been a diagnosis.  And I&#39;m glad I can<br/>
think of him as &quot;my wonderful, unique son&quot; instead of &quot;my son, who has<br/>
A.B.C.D.E.F.G.&quot;<br/>

remember it was on the late side.  At seven his I can&#39;t get him to <br/>
shut up!  -big grin-  But I do remember the difficulties we had at <br/>
the time with figuring out what he wanted.  Baby signs are the <br/>
BEST!!  If you can tell there are areas he&#39;s getting frustrated it, <br/>
maybe figure out a couple signs for him and really work to use them?<br/>
<br/>
Number Two Son is 22.5 months and just this week, literally, started <br/>
adding words to his vocabulary daily.  I&#39;ve been joking that by the <br/>
end of summer he&#39;ll be &quot;talking.&quot;  It will make life easier, sure, <br/>
but I&#39;ll be happier when he figures out &quot;next to&quot; and &quot;behind.&quot;  <br/>
Telling him where his ball went without them is so tough!  -snicker-<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Liam (Carol&#39;s kid) didn&#39;t speak plainly until he was five or six.  Some of <br/>
the other kids could understand him.  But when he was three or so even his <br/>
twin sister often just shook her head and said &quot;I have no idea.&quot;   But I <br/>
discovered one day he was listening more and better than the rest of us when <br/>
I had my kids and Carol&#39;s at the zoo. I think Liam was five.  There was an <br/>
announcement on the PA system, all squawky and I couldn&#39;t understand it.  I <br/>
just said in general to that group of five to seven kids (I don&#39;t remember <br/>
the birth status of Holly and Julie at that point; maybe just five kids &lt;g&gt; <br/>
&quot;What did she say?&quot;<br/>
<br/>

what the announcement had been.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621966096"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;It will make life easier, sure,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but I&#39;ll be happier when he figures out &quot;next to&quot; and &quot;behind.&quot;<br/>
Telling him where his ball went without them is so tough!  -snicker-&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
See, this is what I keep trying to tell my husband.  Caeleb understands <br/>
EVERYTHING!  I can tell him to go in his room and get his shoes and socks <br/>
and jacket and he&#39;ll walk out with all three!  He easily takes 3, 4, even 5 <br/>
step directions without fail.  He can identify every body part, and even <br/>
some shapes and colors.  I know he&#39;s bright, but I can&#39;t seem to get that <br/>
through to my husband, or others for that matter.  I think most of it is <br/>
just wanting him to talk to please everyone else.  That sounds terrible, but <br/>
it&#39;s really hard to deal with everyone ELSE when you KNOW everything is <br/>
okay, you know?<br/>
<br/>
I imagine, like everything else, this will all be a fleeting memory which I <br/>
will miss terribly.  His little grunts and pointing are so sweet....I &#39;m in <br/>
no true rush for him to grow up.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Caeleb is very big for his age, so I think that has a lot to do with <br/>
other people&#39;s need for him to be talking already.<br/>

boy, who desperately wanted to talk at 1 but just couldn&#39;t so he screamed, I <br/>
sat down and gave him signs.  My former profession as an interpreter <br/>
certainly helped, as he was exposed to lots of signing and lots of native <br/>
signers, but hardly a requirement for signing at home.  His signs outnumbered <br/>
his spoken word until well after his second birthday.  I&#39;m proud both kids <br/>
can sign, but mostly I&#39;m proud of myself for handling the *need to <br/>
communicate* in a way that worked for my kid :-D<br/>

because he was into the question stage, and I couldn&#39;t understand the<br/>
questions.  It was getting very frustrating for both of us.  Aside from<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-835152005">Hello Jennifer, I&#39;m a newbie here and was laying low for a while to read up and get the feel of the group but I could not resist to answer your mail.My youngest daughter Eliora is turning 2 in juni, she hardly speaks apart from mama (dutch for mom).The other 3 children were much more verbal at a young age, there is a huge age gap between them, 19, 17 and 14 and now Eliora.I found this neat program to teach myself and her baby sign-lenguage. That works great. Since all of us start with the ability to understand body lenguage, that seems to be the first real way in which we communicate. So why not give him some tools that he can work with.I started with learning some of the signs and introducing her with these when apropriate, words for drinking, dog, food, more and such. she picked it up realy fast and even comes up with her own, whiping of hands when she played with sand is now her word for sandbox. Offcourse I speak all the words as well as signing them. It made her less frustrated about not being able to express herself.You can read about this system at www.mybabyfingers.com.It even makes your kid smarter because it learns to use both hemisperes of the brain at the same time, neat.I think she will speak before she is 18 LOL Hope to have been of help.Greetings,  Myrrha<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893694944">I can relate to many of the things Sorcha has mentioned.  Especially the<br/>
&quot;sometimes I wish he&#39;d stop talking.&quot;  My dd didn&#39;t say much at all for<br/>
quite a while (up until 2 yo, I think.)  She developed her own signs for<br/>
things like &quot;drink&quot; - took me awhile to figure it out, with some frustration<br/>
on both parts, but they worked.  Her first word was &quot;No&quot; I think!  She was 3<br/>
before sentences really began.  Now they don&#39;t stop.<br/>
<br/>
In my anxiety, I made lists of the words my daughter could say or said her<br/>
own way, to ease my fear that she&#39;d never talk.  Now, every once in a while,<br/>
she and I read it together to have a good chuckle.  There are some good ones<br/>
like &quot;ogre-hogger&quot; for &quot;motorcycle&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
So, I worried, yes.  But I found parents and a wonderful LLL Leader who<br/>
reassured me, especially since they could see it wasn&#39;t because she<br/>
*couldn&#39;t* speak or hear.  I also found a great book (would your husband<br/>
read it, I wonder?) called &quot;Late Talking Children&quot; by Thomas Sowell.  He had<br/>
a late talking boy (it seems to be more prevalent in boys than girls) and<br/>
decided to research it.  He talks about that different &quot;wiring&quot; and even<br/>
relates it to a facility with numbers, science & engineering.  Fascinating<br/>
reading, and calming and compassionate, too.<br/>

&gt; was afraid that if he got a diagnosis I wouldn&#39;t be allowed to<br/>
&gt; homeschool.  I couldn&#39;t afford private speech therapy. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve just captured in a nutshell what my feelings were the whole time we <br/>
were dealing with my son&#39;s speach delay, as they labeled it.  Except I did <br/>
take him to Early Intervention.  And then refused to get him tested at the <br/>
school for the older than three year old program.  He had already tested out <br/>
at that time.<br/>
<br/>
I do remember that the therapist didn&#39;t believe me when I related his first <br/>
complex sentence to her.  He had gone upstairs to get a train and I was on <br/>
the couch downstairs.  I watched him going up and he said &quot;No cry, Mommy, I <br/>
be right back.&quot;  So, of course I cried.  But our next session I asked Nathan <br/>
to describe his trip to the zoo the day before and he said, rather <br/>
indignantly &quot;Dolphin no jump up hit ball nose!&quot;  Quizzed him in front of the <br/>
therapist - how awful of me, I now realize!  <br/>
<br/>
So, Nathan&#39;s progress wasn&#39;t miraculous either.  It was slow, but steady.  <br/>
He&#39;s almost five now and speaks more and better all the time.  He wakes up <br/>
and tells me his dreams.  He&#39;s happy and self confident.  <br/>

I saw this book at the bookstore but I hesitated to buy it.  Looked like it <br/>
was geared more towards much older kids.  Say, 5 and up.  I may have to <br/>
check it out though.  If nothing else, for an interesting read!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our next door neighbor child, she four now, she never uttered one sound <br/>
before he second birthday.  Not ma, not ba, not dada, no bye bye, NOTHING.  <br/>
Not a sound of any sort.  Her parents were resigned to the fact she &quot;might&quot; <br/>
have a problem.  I was fairly sure of it.<br/>
<br/>
She and her brother are here more waking hours than home, it seemed peculiar <br/>
that she had NO sound available to her at all.  She seemed in a world all her <br/>
own for the most part.  Her mother was distant with her for sure.  Often <br/>
saying she &quot;didn&#39;t want to get too attached to her, since she had to go back <br/>
to work at six weeks&quot;.  I nurtured her and held her and cuddled her.  Didn&#39;t <br/>
make any difference.<br/>
<br/>
The day after her second birthday she was over and we were all sitting <br/>
around, we heard someone in a very strange voice say &quot;whose ball is that?&quot;  <br/>
it was a voice no one recognized.  It was coming from near the front window <br/>
where Courtney was standing but it was IMPOSSIBLE for her to have said a <br/>
complete sentence, she made NO sounds.<br/>
<br/>
I tentatively said &quot;what?&quot;  clear as day, she repeats &quot;whose ball is that?&quot;.  <br/>
She hasn&#39;t been quiet barely a second since.  I know that isn&#39;t really LATE <br/>
talking but it&#39;s odd and it&#39;s late to not be offering ANY sounds or attempts <br/>
at communication.<br/>
<br/>
It was simply amazing to me, she still refused to speak for her family for <br/>
probably close to a year longer.  Not a word to them, she just allowed <br/>
herself to be &quot;there&quot; and  not really a part of anything.  They would come <br/>
over here to hear her speak.  Her grandparents were appalled that their <br/>
granddaughter would talk for someone other than her family.<br/>
<br/>
I still have no explanation for it, it&#39;s probably the oddest thing regarding <br/>
speech and children I&#39;ve ever encountered.  My youngest brother didn&#39;t really <br/>
use language until he was four but he had a house full of people sitting at <br/>
the eager to meet his every anticipated whim, so he didn&#39;t really have to <br/>
speak.<br/>
