interests. I feel a little unparent-y sometimes. Every opening I get to

tell me something, or need something), but I am having trouble finding 
ways to connect meaningfully. </p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-500773109">I don&#39;t always *get* the virtual worlds my kids are into, but what I do know is that my kids are into them, interested in the world wide web and all it has to offer, and I seek to join in with them in pursuing their interests--even if those interests are not my own.

Sometimes I start things on my own, like puzzles, and the kids will join in with me, coming and going. Lots of times I offer to play card games because my kids love cards. Perhaps think of an activity you know they&#39;ll like and try to plan a day to do it...the zoo, the mall, coffee, paint balling, etc. If they don&#39;t want you sitting with them at the computer, look for somewhere else to sit with them...or run with them :).</span></font></div><div><font size="2"><span style=""><br></span></font></div><div><font size="2"><span style="">-=-</span></font><span style="font-size:small;">“The more honest and authentic we become, the harder it is for people to deal with.”  Matt Kahn via </span><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/julianna.dean.3?fref=nf" style="">Julianna Dean</a><span style="font-size:small;">, fromThe True divine nature community, FB grp-=-</span></div><div><span style="font-size:small;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:small;">This quote really grates on my nerves.

I have mine at another desk close by, in the same room.&nbsp; Whether I&#39;m playing on a game with him or not, I&#39;m usually close by.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been playing video games since my early twenties, so it&#39;s something I enjoy, and a fun and easy place for us to connect.&nbsp;

I&#39;ve watched many with him, but most of the time these days he likes to watch a variety of shows by himself.&nbsp; I&#39;m still there, and can see what he&#39;s enjoying.&nbsp; Sometimes he&#39;ll call me over to show me the funny parts or the highlights, but he seems to enjoy relaxing and watching on his own and usually wears his headphones. &nbsp;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px;">We also have a television in the room with the computers.&nbsp;

which is about escaping prison, while the state trooper show played in the background.&nbsp; He said he thought that was humourous.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t played that particular game, but I know a little about it from watching him play and listening to him talk about it.&nbsp; I don&#39;t have a desire to play it, although I would try it out if he asked me to, just like I would give a look to a show a friend thought I might like, or taste a brand of crackers someone I cared about recommended. &nbsp;

But, in my opinion, this works well for our lives today, and there will be lots of time (hopefully) to have people over in a more traditional way later on if that is what we want.&nbsp; We do invite people over to game with us and generally play in our space.&nbsp;

You could deliver food and drinks.  If they&#39;re sitting in uncomfortable chairs, consider cushions, or an office chair replacement, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
-=-and they tell me to go away, it seems respectful to do so-=-<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re SAYing &quot;go away,&quot; is &quot;respectful&quot; the next consideration?  Maybe the disrespect came before they needed to ask someone to &quot;go away,&quot; and I hope they didn&#39;t word it that way.   If the relationship is bad enough that they will say &quot;go away&quot; to an adult and then that adult thinks it&#39;s respectful to follow that order, the problems are different than described.    So I hope it&#39;s not the case.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when you&#39;re not at home, and it&#39;s just you and one kid, maybe these ideas would help:<br/>

They were there. The end of the paragraph was your words, not Kelly&#39;s, and my eyes are getting old. :-) &gt;&gt;</span><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><br></div><span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;">Nah. &nbsp;Your eyes are still young. &nbsp;;-) &nbsp;I should have spaced them better and added the link. &nbsp;I&#39;m still learning how to write well.</span><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;">On a side note that I do believe meanders back to (or close to) the concept of confidence, I&#39;ve learned more about writing here on this list than I did in my years studying English literature in university. &nbsp;There, I would get my papers back, sometimes marked up in various places, and I didn&#39;t feel invested enough to find out what the marks were for or how I might improve. &nbsp;Here, I want to learn to be clear, because if I can write clearly, I can think more clearly. &nbsp;If I can think clearly, I can be a better partner to my son and my husband and my friends, and maybe help a couple people here too. &nbsp;Win win win win! &nbsp;;-)&nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;">Working to understand unschooling really well has given me confidence in learning, and a better understanding that learning happens best when we are truly invested in what we&#39;re doing and thinking about. &nbsp;That has given me a new-found confidence in myself, which is really beautiful. &nbsp;I&#39;m very grateful for it all, Sandra. &nbsp;So thank you for this opportunity. &nbsp;:-)<br><br>Karen</div></div>
