<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962310805">For my responses, look for the ** :)<br/>
<br/>
 That doesn&#39;t surprise me at all.  People seem to have a &quot;place&quot; for<br/>
children in their minds and have decided that that is where they should<br/>
stay!<br/>
**and normally it is in a school, where they cannot think freely**<br/>
<br/>
Our son has always been interested in things &quot;above&quot; his age and we have<br/>
never followed the age guidelines on products (books, games, etc..)<br/>
**Our children are all like that. But they all like different things, one is<br/>
intrigued by books and reading anything between two covers, from RL Stien to<br/>
Dean Koontz to Laura Ingalls Wilder and everything inbetween. Our oldest dd<br/>
is into gardens, the whole shabang- planting, harvesting, growing, watering,<br/>
sun; then our youngest is into turtles. Everything about them:) We just let<br/>
them go, and no one is going to tell me that my children are not old enough<br/>
to do ANYTHING!**<br/>
<br/>
People are so surprised at how &quot;smart&quot; my kids are and what &quot;incredible&quot;<br/>
vocabularies they have...<br/>
**I firmly believe that if you raise a child to be self confidient and<br/>
responsible for themselves, the child will be &quot;smart&quot;, &quot;challenging&quot;, and<br/>
&quot;above standards&quot;. And above all, loved!**<br/>
 I know that each of my children were getting labels - ds#1 ADD, dd#1<br/>
borderline ADHD, dd#2 slow learner (she has selective mutism). My youngest<br/>
would not talk to her classmates/teachers for months. They said that she was<br/>
unresponsive, stubborn, slow, I can go on and on. Since I started hsing, she<br/>
has opened enormously! She is right on target and learns all the time! My<br/>
oldest was told that he couldn&#39;t read from certain sections of the school<br/>
library, even though some of the books we had at home! I had to talk to the<br/>
principal and everything to get him some books on HIS level! All of my<br/>
children are doing worlds better, and learning volumes more than they were<br/>
in school. I will never send them back!<br/>
