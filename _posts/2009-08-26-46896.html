 </span></blockquote>The worst part about homeschooling is the name ;-) It suggests being at home all day but nothing could be further from the truth. Once you&#39;re away from school thinking, it becomes clearer that the kids in school are the ones in an unnatural social environment. When else in life are you trapped with 30 people of the same age for 6 hours a day with no way to escape? In the real world, we get to choose friends based on interest. And that&#39;s what unschoolers get to do. There are classes and park days and online friends and people of all ages that homeschoolers interact with.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that it&#39;s easy for all homeschooled kids to find friends. It can be hard. But I think adults idealize school and think being with all those kids solves all their social needs when for too many kids the friendships formed are more for convenience than because the kids actually like each other. Too often kids have to change who they are to fit in. My friends in school were more based on similar temperaments than because we had anything else in common. Being a girl into science fiction and engineering, there just weren&#39;t any others with similar interests.<br/>
<br/>
For introverted kids being forced to be social all day with people you share nothing with other than age is a huge stressor. In real life we get to choose the type of work we do and the company we work for so that it better matches our needs. And if we find there are insolvable problems we always know we can search for a new job. Not so kids in school. They&#39;re stuck.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has had the freedom to blossom at her own pace, find friends she really clicked with, has gotten to know her social needs and listen to what she needs not warp herself into socialization imposed on her. She&#39;s very comfortable in her own skin and has friends all over the world she&#39;s met through her interests in music and art. (And liking to draw &#39;80s hair metal bands is way more esoteric than science fiction but she&#39;s found a lot more friends than I had surrounded by kids in school. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996612570">Hi Kate and everyone else!<br/>
I&#39;m new here too. My son is 7.5 months and I&#39;m in the same boat. Well, I should say that my husband is very resistant to homeschooling, but I haven&#39;t even broached the topic of unschooling yet. My MIL knows we&#39;re considering it and seems positive (she saw some books about it lying around the house). My own mother and sister are academics and teachers and would be horrified, so they&#39;re not going to know about this for a few years!<br/>
I&#39;m excited to follow this list for the next few years before we get to the preschool question.<br/>
I&#39;m just north of NYC. Where are you Kate?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190855640">Thanks for that new page. I have passed it on to another home educating mum<br/>
who has had some doubts creeping in if she is providing enough social<br/>
contact for her nearly 5 year old daughters and that school might provide<br/>
that more perhaps and we just had a chat about it today. And it also serves<br/>
as a good reminder for me and my dh too. Not that I really think that school<br/>
is an option but &#39;arranging&#39; social contact for a 4 year old who<br/>
still really just wants to watch and watch and watch other people<br/>
interacting/doing things without having the pressure to interact herself is<br/>
sometimes quite difficult.<br/>

<br/>
I have a suggestion.<br/>
Don&#39;t forget that all English speaking countries have compulsory  <br/>
school attendance laws.  We don&#39;t have &quot;the right&quot; to keep our kids  <br/>
out of school.  Just about everywhere has created some sort of  <br/>
alternative to government or private schooling, and that is often  <br/>
called home schooling or home education.<br/>
<br/>
Just live with it.  That&#39;s my suggestion.  It&#39;s not a word we own or  <br/>
can change.<br/>
<br/>
We talk about radical unschooling here, but it&#39;s not a good idea to  <br/>
tell the state or province that you&#39;re a radical unschooler.  Your  <br/>
choice is probably homeschool or put them in school.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, I know. As far as the school (or my parents, for that matter) is concerned, we homeschool. It just really bothers me to tell *other* people that we homeschool when, in fact, what we do looks NOTHING like school. Not that it simply *isn&#39;t* school, but that it has absolutely nothing to do with our lives in any way, shape, or form. <br/>
<br/>
I think of word choice as a way to slowly change that horrid stereotype of homeschoolers sitting around the dining room table, books open, on a Wednesday morning. When the general public hears the term &quot;homeschooler,&quot; that&#39;s what they envision: school, but at home. And that&#39;s so completely not it that I feel like the whole term needs to change.<br/>
<br/>
As you said in another post, word choice matters. I just haven&#39;t found the right words yet.<br/>

The term has no needs.  It&#39;s been in use since before you had  <br/>
children.  It&#39;s just what it is.  The energy you might spent toward  <br/>
getting hundreds of thousands of people (and government entities) to  <br/>
change what they call home education would be much better spent with  <br/>
your kids.<br/>
<br/>
-=-As you said in another post, word choice matters. I just haven&#39;t  <br/>

<br/>
When you&#39;re describing what you do at your house (which is optional;  <br/>
no one has to post) then choose your words carefully, and proofread  <br/>
your post before you send it, and decide whether those words really  <br/>
describe what you do and say.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not the same as saying it&#39;s a good idea to try to change  <br/>
decades-old terminology.<br/>
