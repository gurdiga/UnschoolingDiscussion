<div id="ygrps-yiv-819683070">&lt;&lt;  &gt;   i just wondered what other parents did or thought about children <br/>
 playing with <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;   guns. not real guns, but toy guns. we had a no gun rule then my <br/>
 </span></blockquote> son turned <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;   everything into a gun and so it turned into a don&#39;t point it at <br/>
 </span></blockquote> anyone rule. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We ended up with a &quot;don&#39;t involve anyone who isn&#39;t in the game&quot; policy.  It <br/>
meant that that the weapons-toters (faux guns, swords, light sabers, etc.) <br/>
could only use them on/with people who had already agreed to play whatever <br/>
game they were doing, and that they couldn&#39;t run among a group of people who <br/>
were otherwise engaged (usually the parents at park day, LOL).  It kept <br/>
littler kids from getting scared and/or hurt, and kept dry those people who <br/>
wished to stay dry!  YMMV.<br/>
