<div id="ygrps-yiv-742830901">On Halloween night my dd met up with one of her friends from <br/>
school.  At first it was kind of awkward.  This girl started <br/>
bragging about all the &quot;cool&quot; stuff in junior high.  At first I was <br/>
thinking (OMG), my dd will want to return to school, (she&#39;s been <br/>
gone for 3yrs now).  My dd turned to her friend and said that was <br/>
nice and smiled.  <br/>
<br/>
Then in the car on the way home from the party she told me she is so <br/>
happy that she is home.  &quot;They just don&#39;t know how good I have it.&quot;  <br/>
Apparently through out the night this girl wouldn&#39;t stop going on <br/>
and on how great school is.  My dd said &quot;she was trying to make me <br/>
jealous because I&#39;m homeschooled.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was impressed with my dd(11 yo) and how she handled the whole <br/>
thing.  If it were me I would have gone on and on about how great I <br/>
had it at home and how what a waste school is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744764476">That sure did take alot of confidence for your dd to say that to you about<br/>
how good she has it at home, considering the peer presure and all that<br/>
ugly stuff that goes with it. Myself, I try sometimes to avoid confrontation<br/>
when explaining my homeschooling, everyone that is against homeschool<br/>
in general, just wants you to think, act,look, just like them.It is a mute<br/>
point for me at times, because they are not going to convince me otherwise<br/>
so why waste my time,energy on such hopeless people.<br/>
Maybe your dd felt the same deep down. She knows and that&#39;s all that<br/>
matters to her. It takes a bigger person sometimes to just walk away with a<br/>
confident smile<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762961443">My son, 17 months old, went trick-or-treating for the first time this <br/>
year (I made him a costume as a black cat).  We did a total of like <br/>
seven houses.  After the first three, he got the idea and started <br/>
knocking on the doors with me.  :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41886307">You have a future of discovering MANY times how much you&#39;ll be  <br/>
impressed with your lovely daughter, Kay. These kids are truly  <br/>
amazing - those of us who spend MOST of our time with unschooled kids  <br/>
can tend to forget how wonderful they really are, start taking it for  <br/>
granted, so thanks for the reminder.<br/>
