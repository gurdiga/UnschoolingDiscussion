Honor Your Child�s Need for Solitude<br/>
By Fred Rogers<br/>
Fred Rogers, one of the most courageous supporters of childhood, better <br/>
known as television&#39;s &quot;Mister Rogers,&quot; a cultural icon and kindly neighbor <br/>
to generations of American children, died Thursday, February 27, at the age <br/>
of 74.   Here is one of his many great essays.<br/>
<br/>
	It isn�t only famous movie stars who want to be alone, and whenever I hear <br/>
a celebrity speak of the value of times of solitude and privacy, I find <br/>
myself thinking once again how real and deep the need for such times is for <br/>
all human beings�at all ages.<br/>
	Even for babies?  Solitude? Yes, in some ways, especially for babies-and <br/>
certainly that need is real as babies grow into toddlers and preschoolers.<br/>
	In one family we know, the parents bombarded their baby daughter with toys <br/>
that rattled and tinkles and jiggled and spun, toys of all shapes and colors <br/>
and textures.  It seemed as thought that baby hardly had a waking moment <br/>
without intense outside stimulation of one kind or another.<br/>
	Her parents were well meaning; they wanted to encourage her to develop and <br/>
learn in any way they could.  But that baby, like most babies, needed time <br/>
to get used to all the new things she was finding in her new world.<br/>
	Even without the parents� efforts to stimulate her, the world is <br/>
stimulating enough!  She needed times that were quiet, times of solitude, <br/>
and she let her parents know it: when they still insisted she pay attention, <br/>
she�d close her eyes and go to sleep.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-553643490">My daughter and I were just talking about Mr. Rogers yesterday. Her <br/>
sun school teacher asked &quot;Is Jesus more like Mr. Rogers or <br/>
Braveheart?&quot; and they came to the conclusion that He is like both. <br/>
But the question was about this stereotype we have of what Mr. Rogers <br/>
is like.<br/>
<br/>
My memory of him is that he never talked down to his audience. Just <br/>
spoke directly to them, in a friendly and direct manner. He had some <br/>
routines that he did every time, and a simple way of make-believing. <br/>
And there was always some interesting grown-up in his neighborhood, <br/>
to learn something from. My mom remembers me as a toddler, sitting <br/>
still and watching intently with Mr. Rogers, but other TV programs <br/>
not keeping my attention at all.<br/>
<br/>
I like his style. He seems to have been a person who respected <br/>
children.<br/>
