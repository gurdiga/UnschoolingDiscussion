<div id="ygrps-yiv-114731984">I had removed the kitchen cabinet doors to repaint.  After painting them, I <br/>
realized they really looked gross and decided a curtain would look better.  The <br/>
doors were put in storage.  Today, the doors were headed to the junk pile for <br/>
reuse.  Thomas, age 11y, saw the doors and got all excited.  He wanted those <br/>
doors.  He took them to his room and was busy for about 30 minutes.  He came <br/>
back out and said &quot;Dad, I need just a little bit of help.  The side of my table <br/>
won&#39;t stay up.  I can&#39;t figure out how to stop the gravity.&quot;  Hubby went to <br/>
check it out.  Sure enough, Thomas assembled the doors at 2 different angles to <br/>
make a &quot;fold-up&quot; writing table.  He explained the problem and showed Dad what <br/>
he was making.  About 15 minutes later, after using the drill, the table was <br/>
complete.  The original design of the table unchanged, however, with the use <br/>
of some screws or some little thingy, the sides stayed up.  When its&#39; not in <br/>
use, it can be stored flat under the bed or whereever.  Hubby returned to the <br/>
living room, &quot;He designed it all on his own, thought it out, just couldn&#39;t stop <br/>
gravity! Nice portable table.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Neat story. It reminds me of a conversation I had with my son&#39;s <br/>
girlfriend&#39;s mother yesterday. We were talking about how Lars sometimes <br/>
feels stupid because of what his schooled friends (including the <br/>
school-successful girlfriend) &quot;know&quot;. She said they are constantly amazed <br/>
at how smart he is, how he can just look at things and figure out how to <br/>
fix them, etc. She understands completely that there are different kinds of <br/>
intelligence and that his kind just doesn&#39;t fit the school model.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This intelligence is sure alot more exciting to learn with!!!  Today, he&#39;s <br/>
exploring this large oversized book with massive pictures of bugs.  He wants to <br/>
be able to identify the bugs I usually want to immediately destroy.  I can see <br/>
it now, I will gladly listen to his &quot;case&quot; over the bug before it gets <br/>
destroyed.<br/>
