<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840689877">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a story in yesterday&#39;s Mainichi, a national daily paper in Japan, <br/>
about spying in a Japanese schoolroom.<br/>
<br/>
Could this kind of thing actually be happening, in this day and age, in <br/>
Japan -- a country long considered the educational envy of the world? You <br/>
bet it&#39;s happening.<br/>
<br/>
And they say 1984 is a year in our distant past....<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>

SCHOOL APOLOGIZES FOR HIDDEN CAMERA<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mainichi Shimbun                                     <br/>

KAGOSHIMA -- A public junior high school here apologized to students late <br/>
last month after they found that a homeroom teacher had been filming the <br/>
students with a hidden camera, it was learned Monday.<br/>
<br/>
The 45-year-old male teacher who set up the video camera admitted his <br/>
action and offered an apology to the students on Sept. 27, saying, &quot;All I <br/>
wanted was to protect a bullying victim, but I took the wrong action.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The teacher hid a camera inside the speaker of a television set in his <br/>
classroom during the summer holidays to find out who was carrying out a <br/>
hate campaign against a female student, Kagoshima Municipal Board of <br/>
Education members said. It remains unclear who organized the hate <br/>
campaign against the girl.                                             <br/>
<br/>
Identities of the people involved and the school are being withheld for <br/>
reasons of privacy.<br/>
<br/>
Officials at the Ministry of Education expressed their regret over the <br/>
incident.                               <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Trust between students and teachers is fundamental to education. <br/>
However, the fact that the teacher had installed a hidden camera shows <br/>
that the trust had already been lost,&quot; a ministry official said. &quot;The <br/>
filming was over the top. There must have been some other method.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The students discovered the camera on Sept. 27 after one of them turned <br/>
on the television in a room adjoining theirs and realized that the images <br/>
came from their classroom.<br/>
<br/>
The school organized a meeting of the students on the same day to <br/>
apologize over the matter.<br/>
