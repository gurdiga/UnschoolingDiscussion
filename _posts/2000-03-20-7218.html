&gt;                                              Posted: March 20, 2000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                        My husband and I have been talking a lot about<br/>
&gt; the census. The prospect of<br/>
&gt;                        answering those personal questions is for us that<br/>
&gt; line in the sand. But<br/>
&gt;                        in my lawyers obsession with seeking a legal<br/>
&gt; justification, a means to<br/>
&gt;                        fight injustice, I looked at the cases involving<br/>
&gt; others resisting the census<br/>
&gt;                        in the past.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                        There are a handful of cases involving the<br/>
&gt; census, and they date back to the<br/>
&gt;                        early days of this nation. In 1901, the<br/>
&gt; constitutionality of the government&#39;s<br/>
&gt;                        asking of questions beyond mere numbers was<br/>
&gt; challenged and upheld.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                        Respecting the suggestion that the power of<br/>
&gt; congress is limited to a census<br/>
&gt;                        of the population, it should be noticed that at<br/>
&gt; stated periods congress is<br/>
&gt;                        directed to make an apportionment, and to take a<br/>
&gt; census to furnish the<br/>
&gt;                        necessary information therefor, and that certain<br/>
&gt; representation and taxation<br/>
&gt;                        shall be related to that census. This does not<br/>
&gt; prohibit the gathering of<br/>
&gt;                        other statistics, if &quot;necessary and proper,&quot; for<br/>
&gt; the intelligent exercise of<br/>
&gt;                        other powers enumerated in the constitution, and<br/>
&gt; in such case there could be<br/>
&gt;                        no objection to acquiring this information<br/>
&gt; through the same machinery by<br/>
&gt;                        which the population is enumerated, especially as<br/>
&gt; such course would favor<br/>
&gt;                        economy as well as the convenience of the<br/>
&gt; government and the citizens.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                        U.S. v. Moriarity 106 F. 886, 891 (Cir. Court,<br/>
&gt; S.C. N.Y. 1901) [Emphasis<br/>
&gt;                        added].<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                        And from there it goes on. Most of the cases<br/>
&gt; involve challenges to losing<br/>
&gt;                        group rights, i.e. representation, and on that<br/>
&gt; grounds have been successful.<br/>
&gt;                        In fact, the planned use of statistical sampling<br/>
&gt; in the 2000 census was<br/>
&gt;                        successfully challenged on that ground. Clinton<br/>
&gt; et.al., vs. Glavin,<br/>
&gt;                        et.al., 525 U.S. 316 (S.C.t 1999).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                        There has been one successful challenge to a<br/>
&gt; conviction for the refusal to<br/>
&gt;                        complete the form, but not based on the Fifth<br/>
&gt; Amendment, which the 9th<br/>
&gt;                        Circuit did not reach, or the Fourth<br/>
&gt; (unreasonable search). It was a<br/>
&gt;                        selective prosecution argument. The petitioner<br/>
&gt; successfully showed that the<br/>
&gt;                        only persons prosecuted were those who had<br/>
&gt; vocally urged others not to<br/>
&gt;                        complete the form. U.S. v. Steele 461 F.2d 1148<br/>
&gt; (9th Cir. 1972). The<br/>
&gt;                        enforcement discriminated against those<br/>
&gt; exercising their first amendment<br/>
&gt;                        rights and the conviction was reversed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                        But when the same argument was made in a case of<br/>
&gt; resisting draft<br/>
&gt;                        registration, the governments passive<br/>
&gt; enforcement policy was upheld.<br/>
&gt;                        This was a policy of prosecuting only those would<br/>
&gt; be registrants who reported<br/>
&gt;                        themselves (or were reported by others) and then<br/>
&gt; were begged by the<br/>
&gt;                        government to register without success. (Tax<br/>
&gt; resisters look out!) This was<br/>
&gt;                        upheld as not being specifically targeted against<br/>
&gt; those who exercised their rights.<br/>
&gt;                        No matter how strong their protest, registration<br/>
&gt; immunized them from prosecution.<br/>
&gt;                        Strictly speaking, then, the passive enforcement<br/>
&gt; system penalized continued violation<br/>
&gt;                        of the Military Selective Service Act, not<br/>
&gt; speech.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                        Wayte v. U.S. 470 U.S. 598, 611 (S.Ct. 1985).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                        The bottom line here is that the lawful means of<br/>
&gt; resisting this<br/>
&gt;                        unconscionable invasion of privacy are:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                        ____________________________<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                        I am afraid that this law must be defied. It has<br/>
&gt; happened before. When<br/>
&gt;                        the civil rights protesters staged their sit-ins,<br/>
&gt; they violated the law at<br/>
&gt;                        that time. When sympathetic non-slaves sheltered<br/>
&gt; &quot;fugitive&quot; slaves, they violated the<br/>
&gt;                        law. And, horribly, when the Jews in Germany got<br/>
&gt; on the trains to the<br/>
&gt;                        concentration camps, to do otherwise would have<br/>
&gt; violated Germanys laws of<br/>
&gt;                        the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                        If this form is delivered to this household, I<br/>
&gt; will not complete it. I<br/>
&gt;                        make no suggestion as to what others should do,<br/>
&gt; but I can only hope that<br/>
&gt;                        enough people share my outrage that it will be<br/>
&gt; impossible to prosecute us<br/>
&gt;                        all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                        But I must advise against sending any letters,<br/>
&gt; notices, partially<br/>
&gt;                        completed forms or other correspondence back to<br/>
&gt; the Census Bureau. J.J. is<br/>
&gt;                        right ? you are safer to toss it in the garbage<br/>
&gt; than to send some sort of<br/>
&gt;                        protest or explanation. (Ive always suspected<br/>
&gt; the same goes with the<br/>
&gt;                        1040). The case of U.S. v. Wayte plainly allows<br/>
&gt; them to target those<br/>
&gt;                        persons who choose to engage them in debate, and<br/>
&gt; U.S. v. Steele provides an<br/>
&gt;                        argument for anyone selected on the basis of his<br/>
&gt; public protest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                        Luckily, the fine is only $100, and the<br/>
&gt; incarceration clause was deleted in<br/>
&gt;                        1976.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                        We refused to take those cards at the grocery<br/>
&gt; store. I would rather pay a<br/>
&gt;                        few extra bucks than create a database on what<br/>
&gt; foods we eat in our home.<br/>
&gt;                        So the hundred bucks, unjust as it is, is by far<br/>
&gt; the lesser of evils.<br/>
