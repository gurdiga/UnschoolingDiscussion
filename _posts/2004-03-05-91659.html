<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068412582">Merry Meet,<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading a great deal from this list over the past week or so. I <br/>
have thoughts that might be of some help and I think they go along with what <br/>
a few others have said.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to see the movie so many are loving and hating because I wanted to <br/>
understand a little more about the bible, about the times that are writen <br/>
about. I have a hunger for learning. Over the past week though I have <br/>
desided that for now it has no place in my life, or my childs.<br/>
<br/>
Everything we read and watch influence us and change us, even if we do not <br/>
want them to or think they do. Do I need to see all the blood, the pain, the <br/>
hate? No. I am having a hard enough time in my own life with my health. <br/>
Someday, I may feel ready to see this movie but for now I do not need it&#39;s <br/>
influence in my life, in my mind. My child is just that, a child, and I <br/>
believe that it is my job to put happy growth into her life for her to grow <br/>
from and form a stable base on. She has enough things to deal with. I want <br/>
her to see the positive sides of faith for as long as possible. I am not <br/>
going to lie to her, as I do not lie to myself, bad things happen. But I <br/>
choose what effects my life and I do not need all that negativity in it <br/>
right now.<br/>
<br/>
As for Religon, it has killed more people in the world then anything else I <br/>
can think of. Not even going to think about what ones have done more harm <br/>
then others. I just pray that one of these days people will be happy enough <br/>
in their own faith that they will stop forcing it on others. All of us here <br/>
unschool, it is a way of life, what we believe in doing, how would we feal <br/>
if someone tried to take it from us? I am proud to be an american, and an <br/>
Army wife, because we can stand up for our freedoms to believe and live and <br/>
love as we chose as long as we cause no harm. My husband and I are willing <br/>
to fight and gives our lives for freedom. Freedom of religion is one them, <br/>
and so I am free to not see that movie, and I am happy about it! Someday I <br/>
am sure I will see it. For now, I have enough to think about and feel.<br/>
<br/>
   Just my thoughts.<br/>
   Blessings,<br/>
   Kimberly<br/>
