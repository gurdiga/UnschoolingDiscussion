Game Maker<br/>
Did you always want to design computer games? But you<br/>
don&#39;t want to spend a lot of time learning how to<br/>
become a programmer? Then you came to the right place.<br/>
Game Maker is a program that allows you to make<br/>
exciting computer games without the need to write a<br/>
single line of code. Using easy to learn drag-and-drop<br/>
actions you can make professional looking games in<br/>
little time. Games with backgrounds, animated<br/>
graphics, music and sound effects. And once you get<br/>
more experienced there is a built-in programming<br/>
language that gives you full flexibility. What is<br/>
best, Game Maker can be used free of charge. <br/>
<br/>
enjoy!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-481581415">I&#39;m so glad this came up! My son and I have tried for two days to find<br/>
something, ran across Gamemaker, and still couldn&#39;t figure it out. After<br/>
downloading it, it said  to pick the file you want to open this file.  What<br/>
the heck does that mean?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-527614707">from my dh...<br/>
<br/>
What Q and I did, was go to this web page:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/markov/gmaker/tutorial.html">http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/markov/gmaker/tutorial.html</a><br/>
<br/>
And downloaded the &quot;Your first game&quot; tutorial. We both<br/>
sat down and I read the tutorial to him, and let him<br/>
&quot;program the game&quot;. It&#39;s the simplest &quot;game&quot; you can<br/>
create ... two bouncing balls. no controls.<br/>
<br/>
we then we added stuff to that game, like trying to<br/>
click the balls with the mouse, making the balls<br/>
bigger, adding barriers, etc.<br/>
