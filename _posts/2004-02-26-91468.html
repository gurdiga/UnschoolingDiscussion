<div id="ygrps-yiv-226966946">The board has two sets of pegs, one on each end, numbered one to ten. Each player takes turns rolling a set of dice. The numbers that come up can be added, subtracted, multiplied or divided in order to get an answer between one and ten. The corresponding peg is flipped, and the first person to flip all ten win. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The nice thing about the game is that everyone can play to their own <br/>
abilities. My older daughter can manage all four operations easily. My <br/>
middle daughters (nearly 9 and nearly 7) were quick to always add... but by <br/>
playing, they&#39;ve now realized the advantage in being able to spot <br/>
subtractions, multiplication, and division problems.<br/>
<br/>
Even my nearly 4 year old plays... at first, just counting the dots and <br/>
turning that peg (addition). Now she can sometimes see the subtraction <br/>
problems. And there are certain rolls that mean you or your opponent flip <br/>
all the pegs, so winning is never clear cut or easy!<br/>
<br/>
Really great for them to play together.<br/>

Target... $15, although it&#39;s not on their website. The Target game looks <br/>
exactly like the one shown here. As they mention, Countdown is a version of <br/>
Shut The Box, which is a classic old game.<br/>
