Unschooling Against God&#39;s Will?<br/>
<br/>
Elissa Wahl, co-author of the book _Christian_Unschooling_ explains <br/>
it as being similar to how one relates to a toddler: playing, <br/>
challenging, exploring, explaining. *RELATING*  :-)  That&#39;s exactly <br/>
the point of Jesus: the personal relationship.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t unschool my sons, actually they unschooled me.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
follow a theory to freedom, I followed my freedom to eventually find <br/>
that the life I had contrived had a name and a theory and literature, <br/>
and people on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
I loved my kids too much to continue to abuse them for the sake <br/>
of &quot;learning&quot;.  I had so many things going on at once!  But I stepped <br/>
back and re-evaluated my faith from a logical perspective.  I <br/>
figured &quot;those guys&quot; following Jesus were at the bare minimum, <br/>
reporters and where they agreed on what HE said, heck -- I could rely <br/>
on that in the midst of all the other confusion and pressure.  <br/>
<br/>
It totally helped to view my God as alive and relating to and <br/>
actively parenting me.  In my trust of myself as a good mom, I found <br/>
an analogy I could grab ahold of:  my Heavenly father picking me up <br/>
gently and giving me a hug when I&#39;d fall from trying to run when I <br/>
had not yet learned to walk!   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like legalism, either, and it troubles me sometimes when <br/>
other people (frequently on the internet, sadly :-(  ) seem to be <br/>
making &quot;unschooling&quot; into another set of rules or a club that I may <br/>
or may not belong to.  To me, the lifestyle came first, and the name <br/>
is only a way to try to reach out to others to give and receive <br/>
support.  It&#39;s a research lifstyle to me, just as is my belief that <br/>
even tho there is one &quot;set of truth&quot; in mathematical terms, I am <br/>
certainly not the one to say that any other person&#39;s personal <br/>
equation can&#39;t be solved within the set of what is real and good and <br/>
true.<br/>

<br/>
But what do you do with the idea of original sin.  As I said in another<br/>
post, for me that&#39;s the sticking point.  I don&#39;t believe in it and I don&#39;t<br/>
see it making for a good parent child relationship, to follow your analogy.<br/>
And one I use often, as well.<br/>

go to Hell?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s another problem I have with Christianity.  If this God gave me free<br/>
will and set me on a path and I ultimately chose not to follow him, well,<br/>
then....<br/>

I have not read her book about Matthew (it&#39;s new) but now that I see  <br/>
it, I will (isn&#39;t it his the arresting version of the flight from Egypt  <br/>
or is that Luke?, can&#39;t remember now).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-757449356">Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
I think this topic is really fun.  I have practiced my faith (I hate <br/>
the word religion too)in Christ for almost 20 years.<br/>
<br/>
The deal is this with those of us that are &quot;christian unschoolers&quot; <br/>
and it&#39;s like Kit said, we were living this lifestyle and found out <br/>
later that someone had given it a name, attachment <br/>
parenting/unschooling.  Now, for the &quot;other than christian&quot; <br/>
unschoolers out there, I don&#39;t think it is fair for you to say that <br/>
because we christians may have christian moral absolutes we live by <br/>
that we can&#39;t be unschoolers.  Are we actually going to get into who <br/>
can and can&#39;t be an unschooler?<br/>
Also, as a person with a passion for christian theology/history, <br/>
there many things that christians in mainstream north american <br/>
society do that are more cultural, than say,biblical.  There wasn&#39;t <br/>
compulsory schooling in biblical times, I am not saying there were <br/>
not modes of formal learning, but that is different than what we have <br/>
now.  Actually, in Deutoronomy (Old Testament book) there is a verse <br/>
that goes something like &quot;you will teach your child when he wakes in <br/>
the morning, while working in the field and walking in the road...&quot;  <br/>
I always loved that for unschooling because I thought that is how <br/>
unschooling parents teach&quot; if you will,just by living day to day with <br/>
our kids, in the typical moments of a given day. <br/>
<br/>
I joke with more traditional homeschool type christian friends that <br/>
there isn&#39;t anything in the Bible that says, &quot;Thou shalt sitteth thy <br/>
children down and makest them do school work from 9 to 3pm.&quot;  C&#39;mon!<br/>
Most of all Jesus,himself, was unschooled, and that is more than good <br/>
enough for me. :-)And like John Taylor Gatto said( in a great lecture <br/>
on how Christ made disciples) paraphrasing here: Christ didn&#39;t coerce <br/>
people to follow him.  He asked everyone to follow him, but not <br/>
everyone did or has. He gave everyone a choice, theirs free to make.<br/>
Those that wanted to follow him and hear his teachings stayed.  Same <br/>
thing with my kids.  I don&#39;t coerce,at least not with Ben and Autumn, <br/>
and thankfully not with Andrew right now (I got my husband to see the <br/>
light another post another time)if they want to know something I help <br/>
them, if they want to figure it out themselves fine.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I will say, that because my husband and I are catholic, we are <br/>
raising our children in the faith tradition.  It does not mean that <br/>
our kids can&#39;t question it. It also does not mean that they may not <br/>
leave it someday. However, whether people here agree or not (and hey <br/>
they are my kids not yours)as their parents we want to give our kids <br/>
a faith to cling to as kids. They enjoy going to Mass, enjoy CCD once <br/>
a week (and all the fun social outings there too). As a family we <br/>
enjoy being in a wonderful faith community.  No matter what one <br/>
believes those are nice things to give a child. However, I understand <br/>
and respect those who let their kids choose whatever they want. I <br/>
just would hope that people like me got the same respect in return.<br/>
<br/>
Peace out,this is the coolest list ever. I think everyone here is <br/>
just great!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not in a pronouncement way.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s very useful to discuss the types of ideas and principles that can<br/>
hold people back from unschooling. Control is one of those ideas. &quot;There is<br/>
only one right way&quot; is another one of those ideas. Limiting chld to the rich<br/>
choices is anther one.<br/>
<br/>
No one needs to be Christian to have those ideas. But fundamentalist<br/>
Christianity contains many ideas that make unschooling more difficult.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; as their parents we want to give our kids<br/>
&gt; a faith to cling to as kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re not a fundamentalist Christian, though! And that&#39;s where this thread<br/>
began. The choice for them isn&#39;t Christian or not. They *know* the choice is<br/>
ever lasting life or ever lasting hell. That knowledge makes it pretty hard<br/>
not to limit a child&#39;s path to the only right path.<br/>
