<div id="ygrps-yiv-322612353">Holly shared this with me, from Rosie Sorooshian&#39;s myspace page:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yesterday, while I was at Alex&#39;s, I got a call saying that my garage  <br/>
was on fire. It&#39;s out now, everyone is fine, but we had to stay at my  <br/>
aunts house last night, and probably will be staying in a hotel for a  <br/>
while, dunno how long.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wondered why Pam hadn&#39;t responded to any of today&#39;s messages, but I  <br/>
figured she was just busy.  I realize this is off topic, but as Pam&#39;s  <br/>
a list owner, and some of you saw her last week at Legoland, and  <br/>
Marty stayed at their house half of last week, I thought it worth  <br/>
mentioning.<br/>
<br/>
The garage is attached, with rooms on one side and to the back.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you were expecting e-mail from Pam... this could explain  <br/>
the wait.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  I can topicize it.  Isn&#39;t it good that they didn&#39;t to ask  <br/>
permission to miss school today?  A couple of the girls do have  <br/>
Monday classes, I think, but it&#39;s still not the same pressure as if  <br/>
they had to spend the whole day in class and get in trouble if they  <br/>
didn&#39;t have their homework and all that.  I remember kids coming to  <br/>
school after all kinds of trauma, and just being there, distracted  <br/>
and wounded and afraid.  It&#39;s SO much better for kids to get to be  <br/>
with their parents when there are problems.<br/>
