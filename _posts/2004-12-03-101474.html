<div id="ygrps-yiv-928502835">Hello,<br/>
I have a ds, 12, and a dd, 8.  We&#39;ve been homeschooling for about a <br/>
year and a half now.  We started out with a k12 virtual academy and <br/>
did the whole school at home thing. Whew! By the time the year was <br/>
over, we were so burnt out!  We took the summer off and started <br/>
doing school again in Sept.  I bought a bunch of curriculum for this <br/>
year, but once I got it and looked at the whole pile, I thought it <br/>
was way too much so I sent it all back.  So I ended up getting some <br/>
Spectrum workbooks just so they&#39;d have &quot;something&quot; to work on while <br/>
I continued my search for the best curriculum. Well, here it is <br/>
several months later and I still haven&#39;t found the perfect <br/>
curriculum and have come to the conclusion I probably won&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
The other day I happened to click on an unschooling link and started <br/>
reading.  It sounds exactly like what I&#39;ve been looking for!  I am <br/>
really considering unschooling but it&#39;s just that leap into it that <br/>
scares me.  I guess I shouldn&#39;t say it scares me because it sounds <br/>
so exciting and fun, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s so different.  I am <br/>
wondering if any of you have good advise on getting started. My son <br/>
had some very bad ps experiences, so just the word &quot;school&quot; makes <br/>
him cringe.  I am hoping to take &quot;school&quot; out of our day so that he <br/>
will enjoy learning again.  Right now he doesn&#39;t hate doing school <br/>
the way we&#39;ve been doing it just because it&#39;s a lot better than ps.  <br/>
But he just does it because I tell him to and I can tell he&#39;s not <br/>
really into it. <br/>
<br/>
So if you have any advise, I&#39;d appreciate it.  <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Shelly</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-7653611">The best way to start would be to stop requiring him to do those work books.<br/>
:0)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Help him explore the things he loves.  Play games with him.  Watch TV with<br/>
him.  Talk with him. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779376557">Hi Shelly~<br/>
<br/>
Welcome!<br/>
I am also new member. I read a great book recently called &quot; Christian<br/>
Unschooling&quot; By Teri Brown. I really liked it.<br/>
Also you can visit many web sites that have  alot of unschooling info<br/>
.Just go to Google & look up unschooling and start to browse the sites<br/>
& articles. I hope that this helps, I heard that a few authors also<br/>
are good to check out thier books: John Holt & Grace Llewellyn .<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Shelley - It hasn&#39;t been very long since I went through the same thing--knowing that unschooling is where I wanted to head, but hesitant because it was so different.  The thing that gave me the biggest boost in confidence was going to the Live and Learn Conference.  It&#39;s in a different city every year, but the time I went it was in Columbia, SC, and I got me and the kids there even though I was very nervous about traveling without hubby along.  There were so many other people and speakers who really understood how I wanted to raise my kids--not fix them, not make them stuff their brains with boring text book info, just be here and do what they feel they need to grow and be in this world.  I finally gave myself permission to stop worrying about what I should approve of and disapprove of!  Instead, I started talking to my kids about what they were interested in, and I was fascinated by them!  And I found out that while they are &quot;playing&quot; they are actually developing the very skills that &quot;professional educators&quot; would love to see in schooled kids.  Things like being able to read some directions and follow them, do research to find the answer to a problem, that sort of stuff.  The difference is that my kids were doing it over their Yu-Gi-Oh game or video games.  Now my kids are playing Runescape, (www.runescape.com) and I am enjoying talking to them about it, or watching some as they play, if they want.  <br/>
     I&#39;m rambling, so let me just add one other thing.  I have found that when I start to get nervous about wether or not my kids will hever have a certain skill or attitude, I immediately start focusing on developing it in *myself*.  I am convinced that my kids learn more by watching me and my husband than any thing else, but I also think it&#39;s a great way to refocus my attention and sorta &quot;row my own boat,&quot; instead of feeling like I need to be teaching.  <br/>
