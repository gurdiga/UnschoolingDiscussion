<div id="ygrps-yiv-816842554">Valerie,<br/>
I&#39;m 6 months into unschooling & LOVE it! My daughter is 8. I&#39;m <br/>
curious how your daughter went from no math (Other than &quot;life&quot; math) <br/>
to senior level statistics courses? I&#39;m led to believe that she <br/>
would first need algebra, trig, calc, etc. before that. Also, (I know <br/>
this is premature) did your daughter get a &quot;diploma&quot; or complete her <br/>
GED before going onto college? <br/>
<br/>
My daughter is asking to do math out of books, she wants to keep up <br/>
with her school-age friends.  (We previously were doing &quot;school at <br/>
home&quot; homeschooling, and battling every day.  <br/>
<br/>
I know it will be a few years before I have to worry about &quot;high <br/>
school&quot; unschooling, but how do you handle the record keeping, or <br/>
transcript?  I like to look ahead, and not be too surprised.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
