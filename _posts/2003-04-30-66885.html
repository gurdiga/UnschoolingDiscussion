&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve heard this suggested quite a few times though. Paying a child to do<br/>
 something no one else wants to do. Or paying a child to do something they<br/>
 really don&#39;t want to do but you want them to. So if it&#39;s isn&#39;t a good tool,<br/>
 why suggest it?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard anybody here suggest paying a child to do something they <br/>
don&#39;t want to, just to get them to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard many people mention paying a child to do something you&#39;d <br/>
willingly pay someone to do anyway!! Why NOT pay your own child for a job <br/>
you&#39;re willing to pay for?<br/>
That&#39;s hiring someone. Not bribing.<br/>
It&#39;s still their choice to accept the job or not. If they don&#39;t agree with <br/>
your level of pay, they can refuse it.<br/>
<br/>
My dh is coming up with a list of yard chores he&#39;s more than willing to pay <br/>
someone to do. The kids will be able to look at it and take on a job or two <br/>
if they wish.<br/>
He&#39;d be willing to hire a perfect stranger to do some of the work, why not <br/>
our kids?<br/>
It&#39;s not bribery at all.<br/>

Someone complained about their child not showering and someone else made a<br/>
statement of paying him to do so. Whatever it took to have him smell nice.<br/>
<br/>
I also remember someone mentioning to pay the child to clean their room.<br/>
That&#39;s not something that I would figure most people would be able to have<br/>
someone else come and do. Most.<br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t have a problem with it, I was just asking why mentioning<br/>
to pay someone to do something they don&#39;t want to do is okay and then say<br/>
bribery doesn&#39;t have a place.<br/>

<br/>
Ah, but instead of the parent trying to assert their authority over a child <br/>
that has different priorities, they are offereing pay for something that <br/>
would help them function better.<br/>
It&#39;s recognizing that the shower does NOT matter to the child, but it is <br/>
important to the parent.<br/>
It was offered as one alternative to being forceful and domineering.<br/>
<br/>
So bribery depends, just like a lot of things, on the situation.<br/>
It&#39;s not the best way to get someone to learn something....doesn&#39;t work very <br/>
well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1046062964">I know personally that money is a low level motivator.  Worse, if it&#39;s a &quot;reward&quot; for doing something I don&#39;t want to do I despise the person offering it because they are disguising their controlling me.  What am I a rat you can manipulate with a morsel!!?  Little people are in touch with this feeling too. They do the action, but hate it and you.  So you have to up the ante over and over.  One gold star, two, three, a book, a bike, a car, a sports car.  On and on.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if we unschool, we open the world to what they want to do naturally.  Intrinsic motivation.  It works in business too and in management.  A friend (and unschooler) has transformed a bank branch in a small town into Western Canada&#39;s top producer with intrinsic motivation - let them do what comes naturally and all HQ-Toronto manipulative &quot;contests&quot; and bribes never make it into his branch.  The staff was relieved!!!!  We can focus on what we do well and give customers service they deserve and no unnatural pushy behaviour to get the gold star.  I&#39;ve met these people.  Wow! They rock!  Still, HQ wants it to stop.  Dangerous!<br/>
<br/>
So, no, a job is not a bribe.  But a gold star is a bribe and a manipulation.  It can be subtle, but to the victim, it&#39;s as clear as crystal!<br/>
<br/>
My thots, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248390369">I offered to pay my 7 yod to move her clothes from her big sister&#39;s room<br/>
into her own room.  (The pay wasn&#39;t to do the job, it was to let me do it.)<br/>
She got really excited and suggested $12 a week.  I told her I had a one<br/>
time payment in mind.  She said no.<br/>
<br/>
I am still trying to figure out how to accomplish this.  Big sis would love<br/>
to not have little sis&#39;s clothes strewn all over her room.  I do help pick<br/>
them up, but it&#39;s hard to keep up with someone who changes multiple times<br/>
throughout the day.<br/>
<br/>
I was discussing it with my mom and she suggested not allowing her to change<br/>
clothes.  Get dressed for the day and that&#39;s it.  I would rather have the<br/>
strewn clothes.<br/>
