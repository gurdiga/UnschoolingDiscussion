<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099157503">Hi everyone!  I&#39;m VERY new to all of this, but have been researching on the internet and am very interested in unschooling, but I confess I am so SCARED!  What would you recommend to help someone who has come from an extremely controlling family background to begin to shift mentally into unschooling?  This is our fourth year homeschooling and we have done mostly a Charlotte Mason Method.  Over the years I have unlearned a lot and shed a lot of the mindsets I was raised with, but there is so much more shedding to be done.  My older children are 9 and 11 and then I have a 2 yo and one on the way.  With my 2 year old, I have done things very differently.  I learned while I was pregnant with her of Attachment Parenting and fell in love with that philosophy of parenting so it has been a very different experience since we haven&#39;t had a focus on the conditioning we did with my other children whom I had at a very different time in my life.  With my older two I feel more inept and confused as to how to transition from rules to principles...from external to internal motivation.  I have so many fears and really want to learn how to confront those fears and move past them.  <br/>

Thank you for reading,<br/>
