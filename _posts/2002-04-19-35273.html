Thanks for the kind words Sharon. Actually though, this isn&#39;t his first <br/>
time...or his second. It&#39;s a way of life for him at this point. I have lost a <br/>
lot of my  sympathy. But not hope....there&#39;s always hope. <br/>
The part that hurts is that as my mother lay dieing in February, he was 4,000 <br/>
miles away in a prison cell. The only child in our family that wasn&#39;t by her <br/>
side.<br/>
It really upset and hurt him that he couldn&#39;t be there for one last <br/>
goodbye...maybe this will be the experience that sets forth some positive <br/>
change. I&#39;d like to believe that.<br/>
