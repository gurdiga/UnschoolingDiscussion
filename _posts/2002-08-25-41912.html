If you&#39;re military, you follow the laws of the state you&#39;re residing in. <br/>
There are exeptions for FOREIGN bases/posts: unschooling is illegal in <br/>
Germany, but US military may homeschool there (as well as go to DoD schools). <br/>
Americans living in Germany (NOT military) are subject to German law and may <br/>
not homeschool.<br/>
