<div id="ygrps-yiv-119877229"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;How did she start cursive writing? That one is a real &#39;struggle&quot; for us. <br/>
&gt;&gt;Any tips?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, it wasn&#39;t something I decided it was time to learn. Casey decided when <br/>
she was 4 years old that she wanted to write in cursive. :-/ I showed her <br/>
how to write her first name and she did her own version of it. That <br/>
satisfied her for about a year. When she asked for more, I gave her more.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years we&#39;ve played with it a lot. She&#39;s traced my letters, done <br/>
cursive workbooks, tried to write in cursive to a penpal. She really likes <br/>
to write, so there are many, many opportunities for her to do a cursive word <br/>
or phrase here and there. I remember that playing fairies tended to need <br/>
cursive writing. I guess fairies wouldn&#39;t write in plain old block letters. <br/>
;-) Oh, and her signature got really good when she was practicing her <br/>
autograph for if she&#39;s ever famous. LOL!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a typically Casey story, actually. And I should point out right up <br/>
front that Conor does not write in cursive, and that&#39;s okay too. :o) No <br/>
struggles.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who is cursive important to?<br/>
<br/>
Its not a necessary function of getting on with one&#39;s life. Printing <br/>
is fine, and a typewriter is great.<br/>
<br/>
Was it John Taylor Gatto&#39;s book that listed the reason cursive was <br/>
brought into schools? I can&#39;t remember offhand. I&#39;d look it up but I <br/>
decided to stay longer on my trip and don&#39;t have access to things I <br/>
need right now.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, if a child really WANTS to learn it, practice, practice, <br/>
practice.<br/>
<br/>
Just think about who&#39;s agenda it is as to why it&#39;s a &#39;struggle&#39;, yah <br/>
know?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473385898"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Do you remember how this came about? I find my daughter has a hard time <br/>
&gt;&gt;writing, She is 7, and seems to not want to write anything because she is <br/>
&gt;&gt;such a perfectionist that if it not perfect, she gets really mad at <br/>
&gt;&gt;herself.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As I posted before, Casey LOVES to write just for the fun of it. Always has. <br/>
It&#39;s just a part of who she is. A big part. I sometimes say she was born <br/>
with a pencil in her hand. (Although I&#39;m certain that would have hurt. :-o) <br/>
So I was moving from that point of joy and interest in her. It was not <br/>
something I was trying to get her to learn. And even still, all of her <br/>
cursive is not &quot;beautiful&quot;. But her sig is gorgeous. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Casey is also a big time perfectionist. She&#39;s ripped up more pages than I <br/>
can count. I try to help her through, pointing out the obvious &quot;it doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to be perfect&quot; stuff. At the same time I try to honor her need for a <br/>
what she considers a &quot;perfect&quot; product. I like to tell her that if I ever <br/>
needed brain surgery, I&#39;d hope my surgeon was as precise as she is. :o)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Her writing at this point is far from perfect - as is her spelling-&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When Casey is writing for need or meaning, her writing is fast and furious. <br/>
Her spelling is also inventive, but getting better all the time. How? She <br/>
asks me, I tell her, she writes it down. It may take 100 tries per word, but <br/>
she&#39;s getting there joyfully and with no pressure.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I have used Math curriculum in the past and she is great with math - She <br/>
&gt;&gt;reads really well, but I have never used a phonics, spelling, writing <br/>
&gt;&gt;curriculum and was wondering if there was a connection there?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Casey&#39;s never used a structured curriculum of any kind. At times she&#39;s <br/>
played around in workbooks, or the Phonics Game (her request :-P~~~) or <br/>
whatever, but always in a light, take it or leave it kind of way. I don&#39;t <br/>
think kids need a structured approach to learn to spell. Casey is making her <br/>
connections with words and their spellings all the time. She writes because <br/>
it&#39;s fun. If it wasn&#39;t fun, I wouldn&#39;t MAKE her for the sake of some <br/>
suggestion or schedule in some book. (Not saying anyone is doing that BTW. <br/>
:o))<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Do you have any suggestions on what helps writing, and spelling develop?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Writing for the joy and usefulness it brings. Reading for the joy and <br/>
usefulness it brings. Seeing words used in the real world. Having a mom (or <br/>
dad) around to answer questions, provide spellings and maybe point out a <br/>
phonics rule in a light, matter of fact way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I have also read that sometimes motor skills develop at different levels <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, of course they do. :o) Kids don&#39;t all learn to walk or talk or ride <br/>
bikes at the same age, right?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;- I notice she really presses hard with her pens/pencils - she says her <br/>
&gt;&gt;hand hurts - maybe she just isn&#39;t ready?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe. I would certainly not force any writing on a child with complaints <br/>
like that. Practice won&#39;t help, it&#39;ll just make her hand hurt more and <br/>
possibly build up a hatred for writing. And it makes it hard to separate the <br/>
idea of writing (Hey, I have a story I&#39;d like to tell!) and writing (Gee, <br/>
how do people get their leters so neat?).<br/>
<br/>
Conor had those same complaints too. He&#39;s more drawn to keyboards these <br/>
days. His dad tries to handwrite as little as possible, too. Conor finds <br/>
that pencil grips, fatter pencils, and squeezy hand relaxing toys help when <br/>
he does have to handwrite. He&#39;s almost 13 and right now most of his <br/>
handwriting involves cheat codes for computer games.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I really try not to worry about it - but it&#39;s hard ... I think<br/>
 </span></blockquote>being able to write(not necessarily beautiful) and clearly express yourself <br/>
is important.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are so many different ways to express ourselves. I don&#39;t think <br/>
writing,or even words are the only way. Try to relax and let your still very <br/>
young daughter ease into it at her own speed. If you focus too much on <br/>
writing skills, you may miss her passion or talent in another area of <br/>
expression.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
When using a dip pen (&quot;real&quot; pen and ink), there are advantages to not <br/>
picking the pen up, and so cursive is a way to write while the ink&#39;s still <br/>
flowing.  <br/>
<br/>
Non-digital clocks are called analog clocks.   They&#39;re not &quot;necessary,&quot; but <br/>
there are umpty million of them in the world, some a few hundred years old.  <br/>
Some are incredible marvels of engineering.    And mathematically, a digital <br/>
clock don&#39;t furnish the same amount of information an analog clock does.<br/>
<br/>
Now that we have cars, horses aren&#39;t really necessary.<br/>
Now that we have plastic shoes, leather shoes aren&#39;t really necessary.<br/>
Now that we have grocery stores, growing our own food isn&#39;t really necessary.<br/>
Now that we have recorded music, singing at home isn&#39;t necessary.<br/>
<br/>
All technically true, but...<br/>
Some things are beautiful arts on their on, without regard for the options or <br/>

&gt; Wow.  Another days-old post.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But reading it to see what I said the other day made me remember that I<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; taught calligraphy for money a couple of times (once a workshop at an art<br/>
&gt; school, and once a series through community education).<br/>

about how you see things.  If you look at that clock and you see ten <br/>
till two, but you know it is evening . . . you then have to look <br/>
closely at what the numbers say.<br/>
<br/>
My problem now is that while I was recouping from surgery I spent most <br/>
of my time in that room so now I have to look closely at my watch <br/>
because my eye reads as if I&#39;m looking at that clock.<br/>

<br/>
I have written for money too.  We were talking about teaching writing, prior <br/>
to that.    I still write but I don&#39;t still teach.  I was talking about past <br/>
situations now gone.   <br/>
<br/>
It is my opinion that your writing skills would be more beneficial to others <br/>
if you would write about unschooling on the unschooling list instead of <br/>
writing about your personal frustrations and irritations.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest two are writing nearly every day in online role playing games which <br/>
ONLY exist in writing.  I think it&#39;s so cool that they&#39;re involved in <br/>
real-time writing--type and send, without revision.  And the immediate result <br/>
is a response from another role player, and an effect on the game.   Our only <br/>
similarity as kids would have been notes passed in class (BIG sin in school). <br/>
 Letters through the mail took days or weeks, but this takes seconds, and <br/>
they&#39;ll do it for hours.<br/>
<br/>
People with kids on AOL might want to recommend this to them.  It&#39;s called <br/>
&quot;Alliance of Nations,&quot; and is played on a bulletin board and in chatrooms.  <br/>
Kids register a character and stay in persona.  There are dice rolls <br/>
sometimes (with the online dice), and there are scores to report.<br/>

I so agree.  I&#39;m just saying this, because my 7 year old daughter does<br/>
not see the sense in using our round clock in the kitchen when it<br/>
requires so much more work than the bedroom digital clock.  After I<br/>
thought about it, I could understand her logic.  I guess I&#39;ll have to<br/>
wait until she sees the fun in it.<br/>
