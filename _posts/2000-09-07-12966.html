<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105206833">that&#39;s what I do, too ... I just say we&#39;re *eclectic* ... goodness, it&#39;s<br/>
just NOT worth the energy to *splain* myself to people who really don&#39;t get<br/>
it ... why waste the extra energy ... course, IF THEY DO want to know,<br/>
that&#39;s a whole other story, I&#39;ll be GLAD to talk their arm off ...<br/>

&gt;  glad to know i am not the only one.  i guess it is natural to be wary in<br/>
a<br/>
&gt;  society that is so school oriented, etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, I never actually tell people we are UNschooling.  They just wouldn&#39;t<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; it.  Not in the time I have to spend explaining, anyway.  Most people seem<br/>
&gt; content with &quot;no, we don&#39;t really use a set curriculum (that&#39;s ALWAYS<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; first question), we do a combination of things.&quot;<br/>
