I think defining a child as lazy, insisting to a big list of unschoolers that <br/>

A Jewish folktale, set in nineteenth century Eastern Europe, tells of a man <br/>
who went through a small community slandering the rabbi. One day, feeling <br/>
suddenly remorseful, he begged the rabbi for forgiveness and offered to <br/>
undergo any form of penance to make amends. The rabbi told him to take a <br/>
feather pillow from his home, cut it open, scatter the feathers to the wind. <br/>
The man did as he was told and returned to the rabbi. He asked, &quot;Am I now <br/>
forgiven?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Almost,&quot; came the response. &quot;You just have to perform one last task: Go and <br/>
gather all the feathers.<br/>

<br/>
We all have negative echoes of the past, the unkind words said and the <br/>
insults hurled  when we were small and defenseless. Those elements stored in <br/>
our psyche give their consent to someone putting us down. Abusers know it too <br/>
well. They try to make the abuse-victims believe that they are worthless and <br/>
deserve the treatment meted out to them. When victims buy that, they are <br/>
virtually trapped. They stop even trying to get out of the abuse situation.  <br/>
<br/>
If somebody says, &quot;You are no good, or you are a worthless human being, &quot; and <br/>
you say to yourself , &quot;That&#39;s right! I am no good, I am worthless, &quot; you have <br/>
bit the hook. When you endorse a negative label emotional upset, anger, <br/>
sadness, and hurt, are bound to follow.  <br/>

<br/>
To help pinpoint possible contributors to your feelings about your <br/>
self-worth, ask yourself these questions:<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone in your life right now who is feeding you negative, <br/>
inappropriate messages about yourself?<br/>
<br/>
How do these messages make you feel?<br/>
What are you going to do about it?<br/>
What circumstances of your life have lowered your self-esteem and <br/>
self-confidence?<br/>
How valid were these circumstances as determinants of your worth?<br/>
<br/>
No one has the right to offer information or opinions that might have lo<br/>
ng-term negative impacts on another’s self-esteem. Children, however, <br/>
don’t have the ability (or the power) to question the validity of negative, <br/>
inappropriate messages that they receive about themselves. They tend to <br/>
believe anything that is said to them, especially by their families and peers.<br/>
<br/>
Raising self-esteem takes a long time and is often a very difficult process. <br/>
Negative thoughts about ourselves, especially those that originated in <br/>
childhood and were reinforced by others during adolescence, are deeply <br/>
ingrained, and hard to dislodge. Nevertheless, the end result is worth any <br/>
amount of hard work.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937685253">OK, I&#39;ll bite, since this is turning into such a big thing. Why is the word &quot;lazy&quot; a negative word to you? Is it not possible for you to think that it may not be a negative, but a positive or even just an indifferent, word to others? If not, why not? What about other words? Don&#39;t you think there are words out there that mean totally different things to different people? Why shouldn&#39;t people have the freedom to look at words any way they want to? <br/>
<br/>
I find it really odd that in a group of unschoolers, that it is not understandable that people may think of different words and phrases differently. It&#39;s ok for kids but not adults? Or it shouldn&#39;t be done at all? Other languages have different pronunciations to lend different tones to words, but we don&#39;t.

No.  Not positive in ANY way, and not &#39;indifferent&#39; (by which I think you <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;If not, why not?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

any of that have I ever heard &quot;lazy&quot; in any good connotation except &quot;lazy <br/>
river&quot; or &quot;lazy day,&quot; and uses of lazy rivers and lazy days go against much <br/>

<br/>
Words are for communication, and you communicate real things when you write, <br/>
when you speak, and when you address or refer to people.<br/>
<br/>
If I decide to call my couch a dog and ask people if they want to sit on my <br/>
dog, I won&#39;t be communicating well at all.  Even if I tell them all that I <br/>
really think dog and couch are the same thing, they won&#39;t want to go along <br/>

<br/>
That was nonsense.  And by &quot;nonsense,&quot; I mean it wasn&#39;t sensible <br/>
communication. It was noise made to cover over a disregard for and lack of <br/>
knowledge about language.<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to say LA LA LA LA LA I AM NOT LISTENING<br/>
about people&#39;s suggestions about not calling your child lazy, then just <br/>
ignore it quietly, okay?<br/>
<br/>
You will not write enough words to get people here to say &quot;OH!!!!!  THAT&#39;s <br/>
what you meant!!  Then we agree that it will not harm your child in any way <br/>
for his mother to tell him and others that he is lacking in energy, <br/>
curiosity, and the natural desire to do and learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t win this one.<br/>
Even if you were to go far away and never think of this again (which isn&#39;t <br/>

If your child ends up harmed in the last way by your labelling him lazy, <br/>
there will have been a wrong done.  By holding fast to your position, you <br/>
might end up hoping he is unharmed just so you will have been proven right, <br/>
instead of caring SO much about his future happiness that you don&#39;t use a <br/>
derogatory nickname.<br/>

  else to relax.<br/>
<br/>
  **Exactly! That&#39;s my son! He&#39;d rather sit somewhere he&#39;s uncomfortable that get up and move somewhere else, just for the sake of getting more comfortable. There would have to be some other reason for him to move. <br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;I wasn&#39;t aware this was a battle to be won. There is no across-the-board <br/>
  right or wrong. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  If your child ends up harmed in the last way by your labelling him lazy, <br/>
  there will have been a wrong done.  By holding fast to your position, you <br/>
  might end up hoping he is unharmed just so you will have been proven right, <br/>
  instead of caring SO much about his future happiness that you don&#39;t use a <br/>
  derogatory nickname.<br/>
<br/>
  **Well, I may be wrong, but I&#39;m not going to explain to my son that we&#39;re not going to be using one of his beloved nicknames any longer because he might, at some point in the future, decide he doesn&#39;t like it. Whenever he decides he doesn&#39;t like it, then we&#39;ll quit using it. He decided at age 3 he didn&#39;t like his &quot;baby&quot; nickname of Ty-bug, so we quit using that one. No harm done. Bug was not a label, it was a description - from the time he could crawl, he would follow patches of sunlight around the room, just like many bugs are drawn to light. <br/>

I&#39;m just wondering if you can see that even if you feel warm fuzzies when you say or hear lazy, your son might not.  Even if he laughs or looks happy,  <br/>
You say that you havn&#39;t called him lazy, but yet you&#39;ve said lazy-bones.  Have you asked him if he likes those names?  I don&#39;t know, just maybe get his take on it.<br/>
I&#39;m just trying to help because my brother, who is 47, is just now coming to my mother with things that bothered him.  He never realized how much her little comments affected him.  And she never out in out insulted him or anything but just the way she and my dad treated us growing up.  The whole shame thing.  <br/>
Its just amazing what children can absorb even if we don&#39;t say it.<br/>

  &lt;&lt; OK, I&#39;ll bite, since this is turning into such a big thing. Why is the <br/>
  word &quot;lazy&quot; a negative word to you? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  It always has been.<br/>
  **OK. I&#39;m sorry. It brings such a warm-happy-relaxed feeling to me. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;Is it not possible for you to think that it may not be a negative, but a <br/>
  positive or even just an indifferent, word to others? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  No.  Not positive in ANY way, and not &#39;indifferent&#39; (by which I think you <br/>
  mean neutral).<br/>
<br/>
  **Fair enough. <br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;If not, why not?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Because I&#39;ve spoken English 49 years, had a great interest in child <br/>
  development and education since I was six, and played with dictionaries A LOT <br/>
  since I bought my first one with my own money when I was nine.   Nowhere in <br/>
  any of that have I ever heard &quot;lazy&quot; in any good connotation except &quot;lazy <br/>
  river&quot; or &quot;lazy day,&quot; and uses of lazy rivers and lazy days go against much <br/>
  of what is prized in our culture, which is hard work and diligence.<br/>
<br/>
  ** Laziness (or vacation time or relaxation or other words like that) should be prized as well.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;Don&#39;t you think there are words out there that mean totally different <br/>
  things to different people? Why shouldn&#39;t people have the freedom to look at <br/>
  words any way they want to? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Words are for communication, and you communicate real things when you write, <br/>
  when you speak, and when you address or refer to people.<br/>
<br/>
  If I decide to call my couch a dog and ask people if they want to sit on my <br/>
  dog, I won&#39;t be communicating well at all.  Even if I tell them all that I <br/>
  really think dog and couch are the same thing, they won&#39;t want to go along <br/>
  with me about it.<br/>
<br/>
  ** Hmmm. My kids love to make up names for things and call them by it. I encourage. We watch a box (tv), feed the furballs (cats), watch the sky cry (rain), etc. <br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;I find it really odd that in a group of unschoolers, that it is not <br/>
  understandable that people may think of different words and phrases <br/>
  differently. It&#39;s ok for kids but not adults? Or it shouldn&#39;t be done at all? <br/>
  Other languages have different pronunciations to lend different tones to <br/>
  words, but we don&#39;t. In the absence of that, it should make perfect sense <br/>
  that the words hold different meanings for different people. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  That was nonsense.  And by &quot;nonsense,&quot; I mean it wasn&#39;t sensible <br/>
  communication. It was noise made to cover over a disregard for and lack of <br/>
  knowledge about language.<br/>
  ** Not hardly. I wouldn&#39;t waste my time or other&#39;s time. I look at words as things to play with, tools. Not the absolute, be all and end all to everything. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  If you really want to say LA LA LA LA LA I AM NOT LISTENING<br/>
  about people&#39;s suggestions about not calling your child lazy, then just <br/>
  ignore it quietly, okay?<br/>
<br/>
  ** Do not doubt that I would, if that is what I really wanted to say. <br/>
<br/>
  You will not write enough words to get people here to say &quot;OH!!!!!  THAT&#39;s <br/>
  what you meant!!  Then we agree that it will not harm your child in any way <br/>
  for his mother to tell him and others that he is lacking in energy, <br/>
  curiosity, and the natural desire to do and learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  You won&#39;t win this one.<br/>
  Even if you were to go far away and never think of this again (which isn&#39;t <br/>
  likely to happen), name-calling is still harmful.<br/>
<br/>
  ** I wasn&#39;t aware this was a battle to be won. There is no across-the-board right or wrong. It&#39;s our choice as a family (not just my choice) and that&#39;s as it should be. And, yes, name-calling is harmful, and I would never do that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-196527239">Hi Kelli,<br/>
Yes, of course, I have asked him. I wouldn&#39;t call anyone anything without first making sure it was ok with them. It was his idea for it to be his nickname (among a few others), and he will not hesitate to remind us to call him that if we haven&#39;t used it in a few days or a week. Like I said, we all love our nicknames and we all use them regularly. <br/>
<br/>
I have a lot of problems with things my mom said and did when I was growing up, too. The biggest was that no matter who she saw, she would think of some way to put them down, make a rude comment about them, etc. It&#39;s made me always look for something good to say/think about everyone. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-592545332">Really? I thought it&#39;d be more of a parenting thing than an unschooling thing. But then again, I guess you could say we&#39;ve been unschooling since our first son was born over 7 years ago, and the line between the two gets blurry after a time! LOL<br/>
