&gt; e&#39;d love to come but would have to make it earlier in the day. DD and I <br/>
&gt; have a play on the 13th plus she has basketball practice on the 18th. We&#39;d <br/>

This is a great list...inclusive, mostly eclectic and unschoolers (several of us here!).<br/>
They also have a fun off-topic list which is pretty interesting (many political discussions)<br/>
as well as an off topic religion list which actually manages to be pretty civil (right<br/>
Shyrley?).<br/>
<br/>
Great info for hsing in Virginia.<br/>
