<div id="ygrps-yiv-854161303">Anyone reading the notmilk site needs to wear hipboots and do their own<br/>
research.  This guy makes money supposedly finding negatives about milk.  He<br/>
puts in just enough true and facts to make it believable but most of them<br/>
are conveniently twisted.  Take FloJo&#39;s death.  He neglects to mention that<br/>
any meal containing meat (ie. the sausage and pepperoni on the pizza) takes<br/>
twice as long to digest than a vegetarian meal.  And that is just one of his<br/>
misinformation &quot;factoids.&quot;  He states that he personally contacted the ME&#39;s<br/>
office leaving, of course, the assumption that the ME spoke to him.  Doesn&#39;t<br/>
happen that way.<br/>
<br/>
I can go through his site piece by piece but it would take up several way to<br/>
long e-mails.  His assumption is that folks will not double check what he<br/>
says and just accept it all at face value.<br/>

<br/>
If you would like to read some more on the effects of cow&#39;s milk products on<br/>
the human body, there are many books, websites, and organizations that have<br/>
much information for you. I understand you have your opinion on the contents<br/>
of this and any other website. As far as &quot;conveniently twisting&quot; facts...I<br/>
hope that you would also say the same about the beef industry, the dairy<br/>
industry (that has completely infiltrated the school system), as well as the<br/>
pork and poultry industries.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than sit here and debunk your email, I would only suggest that people<br/>
find out for themselves. A very good book to read regarding factory farming<br/>
and nutritional fact is Diet for a New America, by John Robbins (of the<br/>
Baskin-Robbins family but turned his back on the family fortune due to his<br/>
strong convictions). One CERTAINLY does not need to look very hard to find<br/>
negatives about cow&#39;s milk. They are all over the place, and I would suggest<br/>
further research on the topic in order to make educated statements about<br/>
positives or negatives regarding cow&#39;s milk.<br/>
<br/>
You are accusing this person of assuming that people will not double check<br/>
his statements and just accept it at face value. How many people accept<br/>
cow&#39;s milk at face value? Not knowing that there is a LEGALLY ACCEPTABLE<br/>
level of blood, puss, and urine in cow&#39;s milk, they just accept it at face<br/>
value. After all, it does a body good, right? I&#39;m not going to waste my time<br/>
going through the meat and dairy council&#39;s websites piece by piece. I don&#39;t<br/>
accept what they say at face value, and I don&#39;t expect anyone to believe<br/>
things at face value and if they feel it necessary, they should do the<br/>
research. This is what I would suggest to you. There are books out there by<br/>
John Robbins, Neal Barnard, plenty of information from PETA, PCRM(Physicians<br/>
Committee for Responsible Medicine)etc. If you would really like to know<br/>
more about effects of dairy on the system, the information is there. This is<br/>
a great bit of information :  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.vegsoc.org/info/cattle.html">http://www.vegsoc.org/info/cattle.html</a>  and<br/>
here is some more wonderful information, full of FACTS  :<br/>

Take care,<br/>
