that&#39;s a good thing, keep your innocence.<br/>
<br/>
good advise!<br/>
<br/>
to me innocence is an extremely fascinating concept.  so i&#39;m going to<br/>
pass on another excerpt.  sorry, it&#39;s a bit long.    i tried to cut it<br/>
down and still have it be coherent.<br/>

nurturing the value of innocence<br/>
Innocence is a quality we associate with babies and small children, not<br/>
adults.  although the carefree heart and innocent trust of a young child<br/>
strongly appeals to us, we discount that they belong in a mature<br/>
personality.   calling a grown-up innocent usually implies naivety, lack<br/>
of experience, even simple mindedness.   we consider it more desirable<br/>
to be experienced and astute.   yet within everyone is hidden a deep<br/>
regret that one can no longer be child-like.   the regret expresses<br/>
itself in our fantasy of unspoiled islands whose inhabitants still live<br/>
as natures children.   the desire to become a father or mother is also<br/>
deeply rooted in an urge to bring back ones own childhood and usually to<br/>
re-write it, letting our children enjoy the unblemished happiness we<br/>
know we never had.  yet this dream never comes true.   the unresolved<br/>
problems of parents continue to be passed to their off-spring.<br/>
generation after generation, innocence keeps being killed.   since<br/>
innocence has not survived in our world, we need to ask what can be done<br/>
about it.   perhaps we can redefine what we mean by innocence.   bring<br/>
it more in-line with the spiritual growth that is taking place inside us<br/>
everyday.   no one can become a baby again, but that does not mean that<br/>
the simple, open, trusting life is impossible - far from it.<br/>
<br/>
the main reason people do not try to nurture innocence within themselves<br/>
is that the whole enterprise seems unrealistic.   for innocence means a<br/>
condition unscared by pain and suffering and everyone has suffered -<br/>
that is simply a reality.   therefore to ignore your own suffering, to<br/>
pretend that it very existed, or to paper it over with &#39;positivity&#39;, are<br/>
little more than escape mechanisms.   banished from this world of harsh<br/>
realities, innocence has been relegated to the realm of fantasy - peter<br/>
pan&#39;s never-never land, where children can remain children forever.<br/>
but in doing that we have also banished the wonder of children - the<br/>
ever present freshness of life and a fearless curiosity about the<br/>
unknown.   these are realities too, but of a different kind than pain.<br/>
so by depriving existence of wonder and freshness, we&#39;ve been looking at<br/>
life extremely unrealistically.   people do not really know what<br/>
innocence is.   they simply accept certain beliefs about it.<br/>
<br/>
...innocence has a practical value.   it&#39;s not just nicer to be<br/>
innocent, if you can regain the level of your intelligence that knows<br/>
how to handle life automatically, without the burden of false belief<br/>
systems, you have achieved innocence.   a new way of seeing will open<br/>
up.  at present our way of seeing is fixated on problems.<br/>
...<br/>
what happens on the other hand if fear and denial are taken away - then<br/>
a new truths dawn.   solving problems should be a joy, a welcome<br/>
challenge to our creativity.   this truth is just as valid as the<br/>
assumption that all problems are headaches.   cleaning up a river does<br/>
not have to be a headache.   the headache comes from not wanting to<br/>
solve the problem.   preferring to see it as hopelessly complex rather<br/>
than as a welcome challenge.   ... only creativity can see past problems<br/>
to find solutions and this holds true for every area of life.  the most<br/>
overwhelming disaster is an opportunity if viewed from a different<br/>
angle.<br/>
...<br/>
for whomever we understand we love.   ...because we feel what the other<br/>
person is experiencing, we naturally want to help.   to relieve his<br/>
discomfort is to relieve our own, to give him a gift is to give our self<br/>
a gift... love is the only solution to problems.  it takes love to<br/>
dissolve separation, to bring people together, to join all life into one<br/>
harmonious whole.<br/>
<br/>
... love is a way of being, not something you give.  ... it expresses<br/>
itself as rock solid comfort and self acceptance.   children are born<br/>
having this love.    unless we take it out of them, it is part of their<br/>
innocence.   mothers also contain this same unshakable love, unless they<br/>
have lost it along the way growing up.<br/>
<br/>
... the possibility of living without that boundary had to precede it&#39;s<br/>
physical removal.  anytime a boundary crumbles an act of healing has<br/>
taken place and innocence has been partially restored.  .innocence is<br/>
the normal state of life because it is the one closest to our being.<br/>
... success in live is not determined by what you do but who you are.<br/>
<br/>
innocence radiates love without boundaries.   and this is not the same<br/>
as indiscriminately gushing to everyone you meet.   ... instead of<br/>
feeling weak and isolated your sense of being &#39;i am&#39; will be strong<br/>
enough to build the world on because you will share the same &#39;i am&#39; that<br/>
life itself feels.   on that basis you won&#39;t need to change things one<br/>
way or the other.   everything will deserve its place under the sun.<br/>
such a state of innocence cannot be imposed.   there is nothing you can<br/>
do to get closer to it and yet as you grow in being, innocence flowers<br/>
on its own.   the love that accepts everything is one day found in your<br/>
own heart.<br/>
