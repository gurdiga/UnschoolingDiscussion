<div id="ygrps-yiv-581750983">Dear Unschoolers:  We saw an incredible anti war movie that is<br/>
appropriate for kids.  It is called &quot;The Grave of the Fireflies&quot;  about<br/>
two orphans in Japan in WWII.  It is Japanese animation which is amazing<br/>
in itself.  If you have the chance rent it.  It is worth it.  Lisa of MT<br/>

I second the opinion here! Taht is an EXCELLENT movie, but not for all <br/>
children as it is very, very heart wrenching. It&#39;s a top rated Japanese <br/>
anime, but it will upset sensitive people too much as it is brutally honest <br/>
about the atrocities of war.<br/>
Not graphic necessarily, but SO sad.<br/>
