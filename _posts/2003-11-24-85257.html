  Well, Paul is in the military so he isn&#39;t even home much. It makes it rather difficult sometimes because I do things so differently when he isn&#39;t home that sometimes...dare I say it...I think it would be easier to be a single parent!<br/>

    &gt;I could use some help figuring out how to do more academics to keep him happy, but as &gt;little as possible to keep us happy. Sarah does like workbooks and she&#39;ll do them in bits &gt;and spurts. I have to show a portfolio at the end of the year but I&#39;m not really worried &gt;about pulling that together.<br/>

    Husbands. Hmmph. My husband occasionally wants our daughter to do more schooly stuff but it&#39;s then that I remind him that he flat out refused to read some of the unschooling books I&#39;ve brought home saying, &quot;I trust you.&quot; You don&#39;t need to appease him if the cost is sabotaging your unschooling, you need to insist he educate himself. In my opinion anyway. :) his attitudes could undermine what you&#39;re attempting to unschool so why cater to them? Granted he has his say but if he&#39;s not bothering to educate himself as much as you are, does it carry the same weight? I&#39;m assuming he hasn&#39;t so my apologies if he has. <br/>
        As for your daughter, if she wants more structure, why not? you&#39;re still following her lead and wishes. It may be something she needs. Structure doesn&#39;t have to mean buying a curriculum but maybe more worksheets or a set time to sit down and do things?<br/>
