the &quot;miracle of Birth&quot; with their kitty or dog at home, some time volunteering <br/>
at the local animal shelter is a good thing to do, to witness the vast numbers <br/>
of animals that are in need of loving homes. Not jumping on anyone here, at <br/>
all. Just wanted to join you on this one.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just so you know, none of our dogs have ever had puppies, and the dogs we <br/>
have now (and have had) we *did* get from an animal shelter.  We had gotten a dog <br/>
that was not fixed yet, and a neighbor&#39;s dog &quot;got&quot; her 2 weeks after we <br/>
brought her home.  We took her and got her fixed that week (telling the vet she may <br/>
have just gotten pregnant.)  <br/>
<br/>
We have had a cat have kittens (she was a stray who was very pregnant when we <br/>
found her...the previous renters left her at our old place).  She had kittens <br/>
and we found homes for all but 2 which we kept.  Unfortunately we weren&#39;t <br/>
aware of how soon they are &quot;adult&quot; and can have reproduce, so we ended up with <br/>
another litter.  We found most of those homes, kept the rest and have since had <br/>
ALL of them fixed (we have a great country vet that does it CHEAP...30.00 for <br/>
a boy, 40.00 for a girl.)  <br/>
<br/>
So glad to have them all fixed...mostly because I DON&#39;T want to bring anymore <br/>
unwanted kittens into the world, but also so if we find one that NEEDS a <br/>
home, we will have room for it...(we have 6 right now...friend of mine adopted 2 <br/>
of them yesterday!)<br/>

are being cared for. (Must go with the name)<br/>

until the babies are of adoptable age.<br/>

birth.  I didn&#39;t see the initial post about the miracle of birth though.  I <br/>
must have lost a couple of posts on this thread.  I didn&#39;t read that someone had <br/>
bread a dog or cat so their children would have an anatomy lesson.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Absolutely true, no mention was made of it till the soapbox was brought out. <br/>
Bob Barker does it, and I do also. Not pointing fingers or criticizing, just <br/>
sounding off about a passion. Sorry if it was inappropriate.<br/>
