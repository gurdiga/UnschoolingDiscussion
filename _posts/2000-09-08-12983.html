&gt;  Well, you know, I try my best.  Anyway, anything I can do to get the rain <br/>
&gt; out <br/>
&gt;  of here for a day or to.  Yesterday was beautiful.  It was cool, but when <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt;  sun came out it was so nice and warm.  The little ones and I had a pinic <br/>
&gt;  lunch in our yard.  The ground was actually dry!!<br/>

June 30th.  That&#39;s something like 70 days.  I really want to go tubing in the <br/>
Hill Country, but I don&#39;t think they have any rivers left down there.  (Hey, <br/>
Pris -- you&#39;re in San Antonio, aren&#39;t you?  Isn&#39;t there someone else on the <br/>
list who&#39;s down round there in the Hill Country?)  Anything you&#39;d like to <br/>
ship down would be greatly appreciated.  Either that or a recipe for a rain <br/>
dance.<br/>
