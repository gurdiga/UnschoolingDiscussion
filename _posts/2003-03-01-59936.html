<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070343933">I just wanted to share my unschooling &quot;example of the day&quot; :)  Sage, age <br/>
4.5, has been going about her life as usual.  about 1 year or so ago, I <br/>
tried to teach her how tie her shoes- she got a new pair of sneakers with <br/>
laces and really wanted to learn how.  She couldn&#39;t coordinate her hands to <br/>
make it work. We went back to velcro shoes.  Last week, she was given a NEW <br/>
pair of sneakers with laces.  We went to our local homeschool support group <br/>
and I thought nothing of the fact that she was wearing her sneakers.  She <br/>
took off her shoes while she was there.  Before we left, I reminded her to <br/>
put her shoes on... I turn around to zip up my younger daughter&#39;s jacket and <br/>
turned back- HER SNEAKERS WERE TIED!  I said, &quot;who tied your shoes?&quot;  She <br/>
said &quot;I did, mommy!  I learned how to myself!!!&quot;  I said, stunned, &quot;did you <br/>
know she could do that?&quot; (more to myself to anyone) and Noa, my 2 year old <br/>
said &quot;Yesh, mommy, Sag-ie tie shoes!&quot;  Huh. Who knows what she will learn <br/>
tomorrow?<br/>

That&#39;s great! Joseph didn&#39;t have the coordination or inclination until he <br/>
was almost 7. Sierra, at 7 now still doesn&#39;t find the need. Isn&#39;t velcro <br/>
wonderful?!!<br/>
