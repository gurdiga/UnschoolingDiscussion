<div id="ygrps-yiv-678233407">Have I got the dog for you!  A Border Collie.  If you thought you might be<br/>
interested, email me off list.  I will even transport her out to you.<br/>
<br/>
We call her Nana.  She is about a year old and showed up on our front porch<br/>
about 4 months ago and simply never left.  I guilted dh into letting her<br/>
stay and I took her to the vet to get her fixed.  Of course, she was already<br/>
pregnant and we now have a couple of really cute puppies, bringing our total<br/>
to 5 medium to large dogs.  Nana is actually the dog I have always wanted.<br/>
She stays in the front yard or in the house (One of our psycho dalmations is<br/>
very aggressive to her so she can&#39;t be in the back) and never leaves.  She<br/>
doesn&#39;t chase cars or people, isn&#39;t a barker, is extremely affectionate with<br/>
me and the kids, avoids dh entirely.  She has probably been beaten in the<br/>
past because she is initially very, very submissive.  She is housebroken and<br/>
very trainable.  We have lots of animals (cats, rabbits and goats) and other<br/>
than herding the cat is no problem whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
I am only willing to part with her because I love her so much and I don&#39;t<br/>
think living on the front porch of a home is the best for her.  Her pups are<br/>
being trained to hopefully enter a service dog program in a few months.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it.<br/>
