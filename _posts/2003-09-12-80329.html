His program is titled &quot;Heroes and Villains: Comic Books<br/>
as Bibliotherapy.&quot; He&#39;s presented this before at conferences, and the gist<br/>
of it is that Cory takes the attributes that certain comic book characters<br/>
have and uses that as a jumping off point with kids to discuss what choices<br/>
they can make when confronted with certain situations - usually involving<br/>
anger. <br/>
Has he ever tossed around the notion of writing some CB&#39;s with these themes? <br/>
I&#39;venoticed there is a need for these types of CBs, the ones that are <br/>
currently out there (like McGruff and stupid DARE ones) are so patronizing and dumbed <br/>
down with very boring characters that basically give a speech in CB form. <br/>
BBOOOOOOORRIINNGG!!!<br/>
He could write about SuperTherapist with the incredible Shrinking ability!!! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL! That&#39;s an excellent idea :) I&#39;ll have to ask him if writing a<br/>
children&#39;s book has ever crossed his mind. He is a writer - has a finished<br/>
novel and two partially completed ones just waiting for him to finish and to<br/>
find a publisher.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that there are way too many books out there for children that are<br/>
just too dumbed down and patronizing. I&#39;m sure there are some good ones out<br/>
there, but my mind is a little fuzzy right now since Cory left me with a<br/>
sick boy to go to an out of town meeting. Hmm, now if I were Storm from<br/>
X-Men I could use my powers to create a huge blizzard to keep him at home.<br/>
But I should probably learn to use my powers for unselfish reasons...<br/>
