books and gotten very excited about the philosophy -- found out there weren&#39;t <br/>
any by me, and started thinking about opening one.  It seemed to fall into <br/>
place with other possible needs -- dh is even thinking of skipping grad school and <br/>
joining me in running it because it&#39;s an idea that resonates with both of us. <br/>
 We&#39;re going to visit some of the schools and keep considering it, but it&#39;s a <br/>
separate process than that of unschooling Fisher.<br/>
