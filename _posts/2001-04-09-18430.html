<div id="ygrps-yiv-531806288">Can anyone explain to me the purpose of a moderator?<br/>
<br/>
I was going to write to the moderator and ask why the messages with *personal* attacks were not controlled, but then I realized that this is an unschooling list and controls are not permitted and people have freedom.  This list has brought me so far in learning about unschooling.  Every single message has helped me a long the way but now this bickering is taking away my energy, the energy that was carrying me so far on my journey.  I need to stop and rest but I was so close.  I&#39;m very sad!  I&#39;m not leaving, I just need to rest.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616314571">&lt;&lt;&gt; Can anyone explain to me the purpose of a moderator?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to know this in the context of how/what guidelines or rules the moderators of this list follow. I&#39;ve been told by Lovemary that she&#39;s been tempted to bounce some of my posts lately yet I see a lot worse coming over the lines. <br/>
What*is* the guideline? Could you please post them on line so we all know what they are? I don&#39;t think it would be clogging up the list to know what you allow and what you don&#39;t. <br/>
