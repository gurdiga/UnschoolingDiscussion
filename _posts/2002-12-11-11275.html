<div id="ygrps-yiv-323676837">Ann Coulter, the Glam Gal darling of the conservative bully pulpit<br/>
has recently published a book titled &quot;I know you are But What am I&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Blurbs From Salon.Com<br/>
per the author....<br/>
&quot;Children have been led to believe that you can just wave your magic wand or<br/>
find a honey tree, and all your wants are met. Clearly, this is part of the<br/>
Democratic agenda, which wants to keep children helpless and dependent on<br/>
the party&#39;s largesse, instead of encouraging them to get jobs and support<br/>
themselves. I think it&#39;s time we cut off this parental &#39;welfare system&#39; ..&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Coulter&#39;s book faces competition not just from celebrities, but also from<br/>
bestselling adult authors, including Michael Chabon, Carl Hiaasen and Toni<br/>
Morrison, who are joining the children&#39;s book industry. But &quot;I Know You Are<br/>
but What Am I?&quot; has something the others don&#39;t -- a photo of the author<br/>
wearing a low-cut, black vinyl minidress. Coulter denies that this photo<br/>
might be inappropriate for a children&#39;s book.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
That is hilarious.  (You know a parody when you see one, right?  Amazon and<br/>
BN.com don&#39;t list &quot;I Know You Are But What Am I&quot; among Ann Coulter&#39;s titles<br/>
&lt;g&gt;  I checked.)<br/>

&quot;Look what I found. <br/>
I found a note. <br/>
My note says, &#39;I killed Vince Foster. Signed, Bill Clinton.&#39;&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;That is a good note to find,&quot; said Susan. &quot;Let&#39;s take it to the attorney <br/>
general!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Tom. <br/>
&quot;We will take it to John Ashcroft. <br/>
Then the internment camps for liberals can begin!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Goodie!&quot; said Betty. <br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s run to the White House and start the purges!&quot; <br/>
