<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131055893">nancy, that was the best explanation i&#39;ve heard. my 13 yo old dh decided she wants<br/>

treat they have a party at the community center instead. she may go with friends<br/>

&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t think it really matters when Christ was born, it is the one specific<br/>
&gt; &gt;time that the world can come to a something close to peace.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree.  One basic tenet in Paganism is to respect the beliefs and<br/>
&gt; religious practices of other religions.  There are as many ways to be Pagan<br/>
&gt; as there are Pagans (much with Christianity in many ways) and there are<br/>
&gt; lots of other beliefs, traditions, etc which can be appreciated, and or<br/>
&gt; incorporated, into a Pagan way of life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I love Santa, it<br/>
&gt; &gt;is fun, but hey, I was raised in a time when we had a haunted house in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;basement of our church.  Halloween was a time of fun and joy for the kids,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and people weren&#39;t lecturing us that it was the celebration of Satan,  maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt;in other countries it was, but it was never that intent here and as a child<br/>
&gt; &gt;we had such fun, dressing up and getting free candy, and roaming for hours<br/>
&gt; &gt;outside, at night! by ourselves!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is always interesting to me (in an exhasperating way) how people insist<br/>
&gt; on associating Halloween (Samhain to me) with &quot;Satan&quot; or the &quot;Devil.&quot;<br/>
&gt; There is NO country in the world where Halloween is a &quot;celebration of<br/>
&gt; Satan.&quot;  This is a Christian church propoganda from the middle ages.  The<br/>
&gt; entire idea of Satan is Christian in origin, and not taken from other<br/>
&gt; religions.  &quot;Satan worship&quot; only (ONLY) exists AFTER the advent of<br/>
&gt; Christianity and was mainly practiced by sick (Gasp!) cast out priest and<br/>
&gt; their followers.  It was, and still is, a backlash and stubborn rebellion<br/>
&gt; against the Christian church.  I think THAT is pretty obvious by the fact<br/>
&gt; that Satanist do everthing exactly backwards of Christians, and others as<br/>
&gt; well (ie: Black Masses, inverted crosses, inverted pentacles, speaking<br/>
&gt; bible verses and prayers backwards, etc.)  Satan&#39;s similar &quot;appearance&quot; to<br/>
&gt; many Pagan male gods (goat footed Pan, the horned God of the hunt, etc) is<br/>
&gt; no accident, but propoganda perpetuated by a very politically minded church<br/>
&gt; establishment.  This propoganda was designed to Deify Christian Saints and<br/>
&gt; the Christian God, while discrediting the Pagan deities as evil in nature.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Halloween is the Eve that Winter begins in the old Celtic calendar.  As<br/>
&gt; such, some of the traditions and rituals associated with it can be<br/>
&gt; construed as &quot;Dark&quot; in nature, although they are not in intent.  It is<br/>
&gt; paying respect to the turning of the Wheel of the year into the Season of<br/>
&gt; &quot;Death&quot; or hibernation.  Also because it is the Celtic new year, that<br/>
&gt; evening was seen as belonging neither to Past, nor present, the old dying<br/>
&gt; and the new on the verge of birth.  So it was/is viewed to be a very<br/>
&gt; psychicly charged time when the &quot;Veil&quot; between the world of man and the<br/>
&gt; world of the spirit is very thin.  It is believed to be a time when the<br/>
&gt; spirits of the dearly departed may be invited (NOT summoned) to feast and<br/>
&gt; keep company with those still living.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; October 31st was also the time of year when the last of the fall crops must<br/>
&gt; be gathered in and (for the old pastorals who could not feed herds through<br/>
&gt; the long Northern winters) for culling their stock of all but the best of<br/>
&gt; the breeding stock for the spring, and preserving the meat.  This must be<br/>
&gt; done very critically...(Am I leaving enough stock, too many, too few?  Are<br/>
&gt; these truly the best and strongest?  Do we have enough feed to keep them<br/>
&gt; through the winter and ourselves as well? etc...)  It was a time of<br/>
&gt; divination, communion with the dead (which I think can best be equated to<br/>
&gt; the Asian practice of Ancestor worship,) and feasting and celebrating in<br/>
&gt; the face of the coming lean times ahead.  These also are part of the<br/>
&gt; reasons that the Winter Solstice (Yule, Christmas) was/is so important and<br/>
&gt; meaningful as the beginning of the imminent return of the Sun and warmth,<br/>
&gt; the growing seasons and the times of plenty.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These holidays based solely on Natural cycles, and particularly Halloween<br/>
&gt; with it&#39;s other-worldly qualities were particularly rankling to the<br/>
&gt; Christian church.  They, in an effort to quash them, demonized their<br/>
&gt; practices, twisted meanings and persecuted their praticioners.  I hope I do<br/>
&gt; not offend any of you Christian list members, but this is all History, and<br/>
&gt; not revisionist at that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Heck, my boys were born, Dec 3 and Dec 24.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We too have a joint birthday party the second week of Dec. here.  My DH&#39;s<br/>
&gt; birthday is the 16th and my eldest son&#39;s is the 22nd.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sorry, seems I am replying to everybody&#39;s posts on holidays and bday parties!<br/>

LOL!  That is a very tactful response to my long-windedness!<br/>
<br/>
What you said about the different holidays is very interesting, I have always <br/>
found those ancient customs so interesting.  But, like I said, it is  to me a <br/>
time to have fun and dress up period!  no behind the scenes, hidden words <br/>
written backward, just fun and fun for my kids.<br/>

I think it is interesting to look at many customs and theire common roots--we <br/>
have much more common ground than we think :-)    <br/>

Can you recommend any reading on this?  Are there one or two books that<br/>
make a nice introduction?  (for adults, unless you know of any great ones<br/>
for kids too)<br/>
