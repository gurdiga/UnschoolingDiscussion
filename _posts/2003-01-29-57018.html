I know my total unschooled kids are only 8 at the most, but, and I will say <br/>
so far, I&#39;ve never had the stress of worrying if what we are doing is right <br/>
or will work. Any doubts I have usually has to do with behavior and if what <br/>
my husband and I are doing is the best way to handle it. As far as the <br/>
education part, hell no. They are kids and will be kids for such a long time <br/>
yet and then again not long at all. Why make them grow up fast or worry <br/>
about what they will be doing when they are 25??<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have many school kids my childrens age to go by. One I often look at <br/>
is my oldest&#39;s cousin who is the same age as my Joseph. Joseph can be <br/>
downright goofy when he&#39;s out playing around. He&#39;s a happy kid who doesn&#39;t <br/>
care what people think. Today he was dancing in the aisles at the grocery <br/>
store with not a care in the world until a lady commented on his new dance <br/>
style. He only stopped long enough to hug me and then kept right on dancing. <br/>
I&#39;ve formed conga lines in that same store with my 3 youngest and could care <br/>
less what people probably think. Fortunately most laugh. Haven&#39;t had any <br/>
join in yet.<br/>
<br/>
But I digress. Point is when I see him around school kids his age, he tends <br/>
to seem somewhat more juvenile than most. But you know what? He&#39;s only 8 <br/>
years old. That&#39;s exactly what I could hope for from him. Being a silly kid <br/>
doing things kids should be doing. The previous cousin I was speaking of is <br/>
nothing at all like Joseph or Sierra. She is only a few months older than <br/>
Joseph and when she has been here on occasion, she doesn&#39;t really play with <br/>
my kids. She starts to but doesn&#39;t seem to be interested. She wants to go in <br/>
with Tara (who&#39;s 17) and dance and sing and look at her clothes and makeup. <br/>
She&#39;s a little Britanny Spears wannabe who is obsessed by what she wears and <br/>
how she looks. She&#39;s also overweight and every other week on a diet with her <br/>
mom. She barely spends any time on the computer compared to my 2 who do a <br/>
lot and also on TV and gameboy and playstation. I wouldn&#39;t trade that for <br/>
anything in the world.<br/>
<br/>
See my point? If not, I&#39;ll just chalk it up to my rambling!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139955796">Hi Mary<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the excellent reply. My experience with kids under the <br/>
gov&#39;t system has been about the same, and I know many more government <br/>
schooled kids than homeschooled kids. They don&#39;t know how to play! A <br/>
boy up the street, Robby&#39;s age, always wants to sit in front of the <br/>
TV or computer when he&#39;s here, and when Robby goes up to his house, <br/>
they watch TV the whole time, unless the kid&#39;s mom says &quot;Outside!&quot; My <br/>
kids have always &quot;acted their ages&quot; i.e....like KIDS! When I see <br/>
young kids emulating Brittney...ugh. Makes me sick, actually.<br/>
<br/>
And I was wrong about Robby wanting back on the computer today. After <br/>
I got done, he wanted lunch, and then we worked on his solar system. <br/>
We&#39;re making a big solar system in the whole house: 7ft. sun at one <br/>
end, and we&#39;ve *tried* to make it to scale ROFLOL LOL LMBO ain&#39;t <br/>
happening. Jupiter is HUMONGOUS!!! L So, we were busy with that for a <br/>
long time, and now he&#39;s out riding his bike again. He hasn&#39;t been <br/>
back to the computer since before breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;what do you think his <br/>
&gt; computer time will lead to that is so bad?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, your imagery of some loser type, having no life but his online <br/>
games and chat rooms...that isn&#39;t far off the mark, I guess. I know <br/>
some young men who pretty much play computer games. I&#39;m not talking <br/>
about teens, either. Early 20&#39;s and still slouching along quite <br/>
irresponsibly. But these guys weren&#39;t unschooled, either. They are <br/>
high school grads. <br/>
<br/>
anyway, thanks again. I&#39;m most definitely coming outside my own box <br/>
here. I&#39;ve had more fun with my kids in the past two weeks, than in <br/>
the whole of the &quot;school year&quot; before that, since mid-October.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
Heidi is off and running with a life of her own (from Googlisms)<br/>

You will find that if you just try to relax and ease up on the regular <br/>
worries of parents of schooled children, you will see clearly that all will <br/>
be well. And the worries can be many as the &quot;school&quot; mentality can reach so <br/>
much more than just education. And also sometimes you will literally have to <br/>
force yourself to be patient. It will all come together.<br/>
