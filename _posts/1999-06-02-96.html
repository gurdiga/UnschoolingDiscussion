<div id="ygrps-yiv-995667537">Actually, that book is called &quot;Never Too Late&quot; (about playing the cello).  &quot;Learning All the Time&quot; is the one that was published posthumously and is all about how younger kids learn.  I recommend them both.  If you become interested in his life, &quot;A Life Worth Living&quot; is fascinating too.  John Holt&#39;s books are eloquent and I just couldn&#39;t stop at one. <br/>

I have kind of the same opinion of HEM that Ann expressed.  My<br/>
kids are 19 and 16 and I stopped subscribing to HEM a couple of<br/>
years ago (around the time I got on line and discovered e-mail)<br/>
because it didn&#39;t seem to speak to where we were in our lives<br/>
anymore.  It seemed to be mostly for parents with younger kids.<br/>
Of course, that&#39;s where most of the homeschooling families are,<br/>

certainly true of my support group as well.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s an accurate assessment. GWS seemed to &quot;grow up&quot; with the core<br/>
group readership that supported it over the first 10-15 years. As those<br/>
people who regularly contributed articles, essays, interviews, etc. saw<br/>
their children growing into teenagers, they wrote about teens; and when<br/>
editor Susannah Sheffer decided to involve more kids in the writing (she<br/>
wrote a book about helping kids learn to write), the core group of kids she<br/>
contacted for articles remained much the same over the years, and as those<br/>
kids grew up, so did the content of GWS, so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
Our own kids are 13-25 now, so the same might have happened with HEM easily<br/>
enough, but as you say, the bulk of the families looking for support and<br/>
encouragement have younger children. So we worked at selecting articles for<br/>
that audience in particular, including hiring columnists and editors with<br/>
younger kids while still working to maintain our position as the premier<br/>
magazine for homeschooling activists. I like to think we achieved some kind<br/>
of balance, with enough content for the experienced parents to stay<br/>
interested while serving that larger segment of our readership with younger<br/>
kids, but it&#39;s always a balancing act, and it&#39;s pretty hard to please all<br/>
of the people all of the time. We just give it our best shot and smile real<br/>
big when people tell us they love HEM. &lt;s&gt;<br/>
