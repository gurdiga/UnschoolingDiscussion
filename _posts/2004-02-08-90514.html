<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820776280">Being in front of a screen IS  time together for us. Granted my kids are younger but some of the best moments are when we&#39;re curled up with each other, talking about the movie we&#39;re watching or laughing at a show.<br/>
    Dawn (in NS)<br/>
  ======================================================================<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely! We had the best night on Friday. A really great night of family bonding in front of the TV, watching a cartoon DVD. <br/>
<br/>
Dh made pizza (long story, but an elimination diet turns this into a major treat), and everyone was so excited. My 5 yo had been perched atop the kitchen table (looking a lot like Gollum) working on legos for a couple of hours before dh got home. She&#39;d also worked a couple of puzzles, so the table was not looking promising for dinner. It had been a while since we&#39;d picnic-ed in our bedroom to watch a DVD, so I suggested that. Dh was all for it, and so were the kids. <br/>
<br/>
We watched Batman Beyond, which is *very* dark and really cool. Totally different than the Batman dh and I grew up with. Dh was really into it, and the kids were so incredibly happy. It was just one of those perfect moments. I couldn&#39;t help thinking about the conversations here recommending actually *watching* the shows your kids like. We&#39;ve been watching stuff together like this, playing computer games together a lot lately. It&#39;s been lots of fun, and I haven&#39;t seen it pulling us apart in any way. Just the opposite, it&#39;s giving us common ground and shared experience--just like people here keep saying it will.<br/>

I saw this while flipping through the other day and, before I knew <br/>
it I had watched for an hour!  I was surprised how much I actually <br/>
enjoyed watching it.  :)<br/>

I sit with my DD in the morning while she watches cartoons.  It&#39;s <br/>
great, she climbs up on my lap with her blanket and we snuggle (I <br/>
love it).  It&#39;s great snuggle time together before she gets drawn <br/>
away by her toys, books, dog, ect.  And, surprisingly enough, I like <br/>
the cartoons that she watches!  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001347297">I knew there was a difference between the proportion of tv watching when comparing unschooled and traditional schooled kids.  For traditional schooled kids it takes up a larger percentage of their free time.<br/>
<br/>
But I had never thought about the difference in the role tv plays.  I knew that my kids learned from tv, but I hadn&#39;t thought about it too deeply.   <br/>
<br/>
My kids, when we had cable watched it all the time.  It made me uncomfortable.  And we couldn&#39;t afford cable anymore, so we got rid of it.  My kids do more stuff, but they still watch tv on the channels we can get.<br/>
<br/>
They complain though about their public school friend who can&#39;t even carry on a conversation on the phone because she is so sucked into the tv.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a question though.  What about the studies that discuss brain function during tv viewing?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think there would be a difference there too?<br/>

<br/>
If you want to &quot;bring&quot; that specific study here (give us a link), we might be <br/>
able to break it down for you. Or show you a different way to interpret it <br/>
from an unschooling POV.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  For traditional schooled kids it takes up a larger percentage of their <br/>
free time. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Free time&quot; is a funny term, though.   In school terms, it means time left <br/>
over after school and school-assigned homework.   To use the word &quot;free&quot; for the <br/>
reward/personal time after school takes its big bite is sad.  But there&#39;s <br/>
truth to it.<br/>
<br/>
An unschooled child is &quot;free&quot; all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby closed the gaming store late last night, and I was a little worried <br/>
that he would be there alone, but a man had stayed to help him clean.   Turns out <br/>
he&#39;s a homeschooling dad but didn&#39;t know Kirby was homeschooled and when <br/>
Kirby got home he told me all about a conversation they had.   The dad was feeling <br/>
bad that mostly his kids&#39; group plays.  It&#39;s quite a mixed group of kids, six <br/>
to 17 or so, and Kirby told him he thought that was the very best thing for <br/>
all of them.   <br/>
<br/>
Kirby is &quot;free&quot; even when he&#39;s at work.  He&#39;s free not to be there, free to <br/>
be there whether he&#39;s working or not.   He freely accepted that job and freely <br/>
continues to go.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things he reported from the conversation was he had been asked why <br/>
he&#39;d been homeschooled, for religious reasons or what.  Kirby said he told <br/>
him, &quot;I&#39;ve always had the option to go to school, but chose to stay home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In such a case, all his life has been free time, but some of the best <br/>
learning has happened while he was watching TV.<br/>
<br/>
We bought the DVD of The Complete Works of Shakespeare: Abridged, by the <br/>
Reduced Shakespeare Company.   After watching it a few times here, in various <br/>
combos of people, we loaned it to another homeschooling family.  One of them was <br/>
here last night and they were talking and laughing about their shared <br/>
experience with that.  I asked the other kid if he had seen Rosencrantz and <br/>
Guildenstern are Dead; he hadn&#39;t.  They went and watched the question game scene, and <br/>
then they went ice skating.<br/>
<br/>
Choices, free choices, and lots of learning.<br/>

<br/>
I suppose you mean the studies about the wave pattern being similar to when<br/>
you are asleep, etc..  So what?  The assumption is that those brain wave<br/>
patterns are somehow bad or evil or passive.  Those are also the patterns<br/>
people get when they meditate, do yoga, daydream.....states that have lots<br/>
of &quot;aha&quot; moments even with little to no external stimuli.<br/>
<br/>
Think of your dreams.  Even asleep, your mind is constantly working, making<br/>
connections (ok, perhaps weird ones), etc..<br/>
<br/>
The studies have faulty assumptions built in.<br/>
