<div id="ygrps-yiv-954328561">First off, I&#39;m new to the list and to unschooling (less than a year).<br/>
Since I&#39;ve relaxed and let learning happen naturally -- my children (and<br/>
husband and I) have been much happier.  I&#39;ve also loosened up with our<br/>
&#39;house rules&#39; and found that my kids (3, 7, and 10 yrs) are reasonable,<br/>
responsible, and willing to help me most times (when I ask -- and sometimes<br/>
when I don&#39;t). Especially the 3 yr old.<br/>
<br/>
But we just can&#39;t all seem to get out of the house together in a timely<br/>
manner.  And some things have to be done by a certain time.<br/>
<br/>
I always give the kids a heads up if something is planned, and remind them<br/>
a half hour before the time to leave. (bathroom breaks, shoes on, get stuff<br/>
together if they need to bring something).  <br/>
<br/>
At the very last second someone who seemed ready gets to our car but has<br/>
forgotten shoes, or important toy, prescription glasses,(even underwear)...<br/>
And then makes us all late, because they honestly cannot find the important<br/>
item they had a moment ago.  (We even have a basket near the front door<br/>
where we place items to take and the shoes are in the front closet<br/>
(ideally)).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a pretty patient person, but I find myself getting uptight.  And what&#39;s<br/>
worse -- I&#39;ve lost my sunglasses quite a few times lately, too! (but not<br/>
underwear!)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve relaxed our schedule, but we&#39;re scattered (only with leaving the house<br/>
-- the rest of the time the kids and I are organized).  These are not<br/>
usually forced outings (except grocery shopping or the like), even so, the<br/>
kids enjoy even the usual outings.  Once we&#39;ve actually LEFT the house,<br/>
they&#39;re fine -- it&#39;s the leaving that seems hard for the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Is this typical? <br/>
We have outings that we&#39;ve planned for the summer and I&#39;m dreading the<br/>
getting out of the house routine.<br/>

&gt;but has forgotten shoes, or important toy, prescription glasses,&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(even underwear)...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And then makes us all late, because they honestly cannot find the <br/>
&gt;important item they had a moment ago.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Boy do I have this problem, too!  Here are some things which have <br/>
made my life easier when trying to get out the door..<br/>
<br/>
Plan ahead!  Have clothes ready the night before or a few hours <br/>
before and put them in a central place.  My closet is big enough for <br/>
us all to fit into so that&#39;s a good place in my house.<br/>
<br/>
Have a go-bag for everyone.  I have little hooks by the garage <br/>
door.  Everyone has a little bag to hang on it.  At least a couple <br/>
of hours before we need to leave, I gather everything each person <br/>
will need and toss it in their bags. I also have a small dry-erase <br/>
magnetic board above the hooks and keep a list of what each person <br/>
always needs when we leave. (This would be good for listing such <br/>
things as glasses, inhalers, diaper bag supplies, small book or toy <br/>
for everyone, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
We have had the shoe problem more times than I can count.  We tried <br/>
the shoe basket, then the shoe closet but everytime I was ready to <br/>
walk out the door, someone was missing a shoe.  The only solution <br/>
that worked for us was to put the shoes up high on a closet shelf <br/>
and make that the last thing we do before we walk out the door.  I <br/>
make sure I schedule time to do it and as soon as we get home I put <br/>
the shoes back.  Our problem is the babies like to wear everyone&#39;s <br/>
shoes and end up hiding them in places we never think to look just <br/>
as we&#39;re heading out the door.  If the kids that can&#39;t reach them <br/>
yet need them, they just ask and then I&#39;m alerted to remember to ask <br/>
about them later so I can put them away again.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve actually left the house and noticed one of the girls didn&#39;t <br/>
have underwear on.  It took about three times of that happening and <br/>
now  do panty-checks on the little girls before we head out the <br/>
door.  <br/>
<br/>
I think most of the problems are resolved with mom being prepared <br/>
and organized. Of course, once the kids get older and you have <br/>
everyone in the habit, it gets easier and they begin to naturally <br/>
pick up those tricks and use them for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>

for my daughter (who has been known to wear dresses and forget it) <br/>
and spare sunglasses for me, since I can&#39;t exist without them. I also <br/>
have spare snacks, hats, coats, mittens, a gallon of water, and other <br/>
stuff. Yes, I could probably outfit a small country from the back of <br/>
my minivan, but it does make leaving the house less stressful.  When <br/>
we go on the bike, it&#39;s a bit trickier and they definitely need to <br/>
have shoes on before we start pedaling :-) but I still have spare <br/>
underwear, snacks, water, and sunglasses in my backpack.<br/>
<br/>
I also get them moving toward the door about 10 minutes before we <br/>
actually need to leave the house. If they&#39;ve left something like a <br/>
toy they were planning to bring, that way they have some time to <br/>
locate it without us being late.<br/>

time it will take to get me ready. But, oh, yeah, I have to get Kat ready<br/>
too. (She&#39;s only been around for 12 years. ;-) And I don&#39;t want to stop<br/>

<br/>
Anger does *not* help. It just makes everyone grumpy and fills the<br/>
atmosphere with negative feelings.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t control other people. And your frustration is coming from wanting<br/>
something that isn&#39;t in your power to control.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it will help to look at it from the point of view of what situation<br/>
would make you behave as they are. What if every time you were in the middle<br/>
of a great movie that you just couldn&#39;t stop watching your husband wanted<br/>
you to stop right now so you could accompany him to a sports bar to watch<br/>
(some sport you detest) on the big screen for the next 3 hours for reasons<br/>
that weren&#39;t making much sense to you but you didn&#39;t have a choice. How<br/>
quickly would you be getting ready each time he told you to get ready?<br/>
<br/>
You can ask them to get ready but you can&#39;t make them. Ask but assume you&#39;ll<br/>
have to do it for them. (And you&#39;ll be surprised and pleasantly thankful<br/>
when they do get ready instead of being irritated when they don&#39;t :-) Tell<br/>
them it&#39;s important to you and thank them when they help out. Ask one of the<br/>
older ones to help a younger one? Talk to them about how to get out and work<br/>
out a plan. Analyze the plan to see how it&#39;s working. Tweak it or revise it.<br/>

doesn&#39;t seem *right* or *fair* that it takes so long, yadda yadda <br/>
yadda. <br/>
<br/>
It takes a long time. Flylady recommends starting the night before. <br/>
Whatever tools you use, it helps to accept what a big job it is and <br/>
go from there.<br/>

I actually build in time for a last minute poopy diaper. Hey, it <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We make it our goal to leave at a time earlier than we really have to <br/>
leave.  <br/>
<br/>
If we have a dentist appointment at 3:00 and it takes 1/2 an hour to <br/>
get there, we don&#39;t plan on leaving at 2:30, we plan on leaving at <br/>
2.  When my kids were littler (nursing and in diapers) I often <br/>
planned on leaving an entire hour earlier than I had to.<br/>
<br/>
We got places early a lot of times but there were also times that we <br/>
got there just in time and I was grateful that I had allowed extra <br/>
time.  <br/>
<br/>
If I plan on leaving the house at 2, I plan on starting to get ready <br/>
an hour ahead of time.  That way if you need to spend 15 minutes <br/>
finding someone&#39;s shoe, you can.  I don&#39;t usually need the whole hour <br/>
anymore because the kids are getting themselves dressed and ready <br/>
most of the time.  But still sometimes I need to remind Alisha to get <br/>
something to do in the car, I sometimes need to print out mapquest <br/>
directions or make sure I have my phone with me, make sure I have <br/>
lunch packed and money in my wallet or whatever I need.  Check <br/>
people&#39;s hair and make sure no one really needs to jump in the shower <br/>
before we go.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t say, &quot;We have to leave in an hour&quot;.  I say, &quot;We have to start <br/>
getting ready to leave in an hour&quot;. <br/>

I LOVED this idea - my younger child does this already with an old bag from<br/>
Great Grandma, but it&#39;s a good idea for the older kids.  I guess their hands<br/>
are so busy that they quickly misplace what they&#39;ve been holding.  I like<br/>
the idea of them being responsible for their own toys and things in their<br/>
own bags - definitely will put less pressure on me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the note about missing underwear - maybe it&#39;s not that unusual!<br/>
Thank goodness that time my Grandmother wasn&#39;t with us - she would have been<br/>
shocked!  Ha-ha!<br/>

      I know what you mean, sometimes I feel like we live from the car!  I&#39;m<br/>
also stocked-up, but it doesn&#39;t seem to help much.  Water, snacks, pull-ups<br/>
for the 3 year old. that&#39;s my mind set.  The kids&#39; agenda is more into the<br/>
perfect traveling companion - Magnetic Spiderman, a stuffed doggie, the foot<br/>
high Lego creation.<br/>
<br/>
      Actually, putting shoes in the car and just leaving them there is a<br/>
wonderful idea.  We never wear shoes in the house or in the backyard.  At<br/>
least we&#39;d know where they are!<br/>
<br/>
      And the 7 year old (the missing underwear guy) - found out he was<br/>
against underwear while on a shopping trip to buy him new clothes<br/>
(Surprise!)- well, he&#39;s a typical beach- bum Californian type (We live in<br/>
California but we&#39;re a ways from the beach, chaparral, mostly) and he ONLY<br/>
wears flip-flops and shorts (I can actually SEE my much more conservatively<br/>
dressed husband literally bite his tongue when he sees how his son is<br/>
dressed).  It would be easy to stash a couple of pairs of thong shoes into<br/>
the trunk.<br/>
<br/>
      My 7 year old is so funny, I knew he was against socks - but<br/>
underwear?!!<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
I do try to be respectful about interrupting them when we need to go out.<br/>
Sometimes they really do NOT want to, and if all possible, I accommodate.<br/>
Organization and time management are our key problems, I think.  Their sense<br/>
of time passage isn&#39;t too clear yet.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Joyce:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Anger does *not* help. It just makes everyone grumpy and fills the<br/>
<br/>
atmosphere with negative feelings.  We can&#39;t control other people. And your<br/>
frustration is coming from wanting something that isn&#39;t in your power to<br/>
control.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When I say, &quot;We&#39;re getting late and I need some help here,&quot; one person does<br/>
help (my 10 year old daughter), but as soon as she&#39;s done putting on the one<br/>
brother&#39;s shoes, we loose the other brother, then we find him but the little<br/>
one has taken off his shoes, then.  And it IS comedic.  And it IS<br/>
frustrating.  I usually use my &quot;Stern Mommy&quot; voice, but I don&#39;t get really<br/>
angry or yell (My daughter hates yelling - if I raise my voice she takes it<br/>
so personally, even if I&#39;m not yelling at her.  Then we have one shoeless 3<br/>
yr old, one hyper-jumping running upstairs again 7 yr old and an emotionally<br/>
crumpled 10 year old.<br/>
<br/>
No, I&#39;ve learned THAT is not the way to actually leave the house!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Maybe it will help to look at it from the point of view of what situation<br/>
<br/>
would make you behave as they are.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, they&#39;re kids, and grocery shopping, doctor appointments, etc. aren&#39;t<br/>
fun.  I used to use incentives (bribes), but I stopped when the incentives<br/>
they demanded were impossible, like going to Disneyland after grocery<br/>
shopping.  My ideas were modest.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I need to tape up some funny cartoon on the inside of the front door.<br/>
Something to remind me that this too shall pass, and to keep my sense of<br/>
humor!  At least they&#39;re wearing clothes - mostly!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;       And the 7 year old (the missing underwear guy) - found out he was<br/>
&gt; against underwear while on a shopping trip to buy him new clothes<br/>
&gt; (Surprise!)- well, he&#39;s a typical beach- bum Californian type (We live in<br/>
&gt; California but we&#39;re a ways from the beach, chaparral, mostly) and he ONLY<br/>
&gt; wears flip-flops and shorts (I can actually SEE my much more conservatively<br/>
&gt; dressed husband literally bite his tongue when he sees how his son is<br/>
&gt; dressed).  It would be easy to stash a couple of pairs of thong shoes into<br/>
&gt; the trunk.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;       My 7 year old is so funny, I knew he was against socks - but<br/>
&gt; underwear?!! </span></blockquote></div>
