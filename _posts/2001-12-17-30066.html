&gt;I think it&#39;s important to admit that not hitting our kids is a struggle for<br/>
&gt;some of us. If we had all been raised in families in which children were<br/>
&gt;never hit, maybe we would not be vulnerable to taking it personally when a<br/>
&gt;child is, through no fault of his own, temporarily harder to deal with. We&#39;d<br/>
&gt;react calmly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Elsa, I can definately identify with what you are saying. We as children, <br/>
were severly abused. Not just emotionally from a hard-working and <br/>
over-taxed mom, but from a dad (his childhood history is enough to make <br/>
you cry).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the fact that his beating were sadistic and sometimes rendered us <br/>
unconscious was a blessing in disguise. Somehow, out of 5 children, not <br/>
one of us hits our children or even has to fight it.<br/>
<br/>
Abuse, be it emotional, physical or spiritual DOES tend to find itself <br/>
repeating from one generation to another.<br/>
<br/>
Elsa, your choice in attachment parenting as opposed to mimic your <br/>
parents is one that I&#39;m sure was not easy. Good luck and lots of <br/>
blessings in your endeavors.<br/>
<br/>
