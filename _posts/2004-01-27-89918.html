<div id="ygrps-yiv-522737847">I&#39;m going no mail for a few months. I&#39;m finding the computer a bit of a<br/>
distraction at the moment and it&#39;s getting in the way of me spending time<br/>
with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
My head is also feeling &#39;swirly&#39;, particularly after the recent discussion<br/>
about faith and unschooling, so I am going to take some time  to think about<br/>
this some more.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, I&#39;ll be back!<br/>
<br/>
The new school year begins next week and it&#39;s a great feeling NOT to be<br/>
preparing for it and to know that my kids haven&#39;t been aware that it is that<br/>
time of the year.<br/>
Here&#39;s to freedom!!<br/>
