<div id="ygrps-yiv-380271514">Emma, who just turned 3 has already learned the sounds of the letters<br/>
(actually started picking them up right around 2 years of age).   She&#39;s<br/>
done this pretty much on her own....she started by asking &#39;what sound<br/>
does that letter make, mom?&#39;, etc.....Now at 3, she is sounding out<br/>
every printed word she sees, practically.  I&#39;m doing little but<br/>
interjecting things here and there when we read, like letting her know<br/>
that when a &#39;y&#39; is on the end of  word, it usually makes the &#39;ee&#39;<br/>
sound....and letting her know what some of the blending consonants sound<br/>
like (sh, ch, ck, etc.).  She is extremely interested in it all and it<br/>
ALWAYS asking me what a certain word says or means.<br/>
<br/>
However, I do not think this is the &#39;norm&#39;....She was talking in 3 and 4<br/>
(very clear) word sentences at 18 months, and even now at 3 has an<br/>
incredible vocabulary which people can&#39;t believe!<br/>
<br/>
This is also one of the reasons I wanted to &#39;unschool&#39;....so that Em<br/>
&#39;is&#39; just as free to learn things at an earlier age as she is a later<br/>
age.....whatever and whenever she&#39;s interested....<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>

My kids did that.  Kirby was naming letters before he knew the answer to &quot;how <br/>
old are you?&quot;   And in school, that would have netted him profit in grades <br/>
and &quot;credit&quot; and praise.  But at home it was fun, and cool, but no better <br/>
than naming the Ninja Turtles or knowing musical instrument sounds apart.  <br/>
And he came to reading in his own time, and from letters and the sounds they <br/>
make to fluent reading was seven years.<br/>
<br/>
But what&#39;s the rush?  Parents are netted profit in &quot;ooh&quot; and &quot;Well YOU sure <br/>
know how to teach your kids&quot; if kids read early, and some kids do break that <br/>
code really early on, but very many don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Marty (13) gave Julie (14?) four novels which I helped him buy used <br/>
from Amazon.  A series.  He bought them with his own money for her birthday <br/>
and then kept missing her so gave them to her on my birthday. &lt;g&gt;  She was <br/>
THRILLED.  Two years ago she couldn&#39;t have read them and now she&#39;s up to a <br/>
novel a day, but mostly uses the library in a small town.   We played <br/>
&quot;Picture Picture,&quot; a kind of board game (we ignored the board) where you all <br/>
look at a picture with lots of detail and name things.  We weren&#39;t counting <br/>
spelling, so Holly was playing too.  It was her idea, because she&#39;s watched <br/>
people play it for years and finally wanted to play.  Renee and Julie are two <br/>
of the late-reading kids from the article on the front page of the library at <br/>
www.unschooling.com.<br/>
<br/>
The first round, I won.  We didn&#39;t really count and announce scores very hard <br/>
through any of it But once they saw how I was doing it, naming things others <br/>
weren&#39;t bothering to name, they picked up and I came in third of six several <br/>
other times.  The night&#39;s big winner was Renee, who was never &quot;taught&quot; <br/>
reading or writing or &quot;vocabulary&quot; but has always been observant and creative <br/>
and thoughtful and there it was.  And in one round Holly won, even though she <br/>
writes slowly and with invented spelling.  It was because she was looking and <br/>
thinking and not feeling she had no chance because the rest were older or in <br/>
&quot;higher grades.&quot;  There was none of that.  It was wonderful.<br/>
