My memory is that you are in Australia, is that right? When we were in Brisbane this spring I asked about WoW at a game shop and they said that there is supposed to be a new Oceania site for the Antipodean folk soon, which would make it more difficult to hook up. From the UK I&#39;ve had to use my mom&#39;s address to get a U.S. account so that Simon could play. We&#39;ve let that one slide though in favor of a second UK account so that Linnaea and Simon and friends who live a ways a way can play together. Anyhow, Pat needs to be playing on U.S. realms and not the Oceania realms. The Horde of Unschoolers is on The Venture Co. realm . And I can&#39;t at this moment remember who you need to look for to be let into the guild. Here you go:  look for Takulah, Aeolos, Bloodelvion, Thios, Bedwyr, Debraj, Dargon, Talukah, or Zeb and they should be able to help. <br/>

<br/>
Yes, I am in Australia.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for that information. It&#39;s greatly appreciated. I&#39;ll pass <br/>
it on to Pat.<br/>
<br/>
I see from your blog you&#39;re a cat person. Me too. We have three, <br/>
including a long haired ginger cat who was the spitting image of that <br/>
little ginger kitten of yours when we first met him.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your help!<br/>

<br/>
I mentioned your post to my sons, and they&#39;ve asked if you would let your<br/>
son (and with this email I guess we&#39;re letting all Always Learning<br/>
unschoolers) know that they play Alliance characters on<br/>
Malygos server<br/>
as Dartril, Delantard, or Regorenn<br/>
and the other as: Arenamaster or Shortiye<br/>

We are unschooling in Victoria, Australia.<br/>

<br/>
I was the one playing on the U.S. account, which isn&#39;t a bad thing. And I also felt left out of all the friday night get togethers...sigh...all that time difference and my needing sleep kind of thing. Oh, and my computer bit the dust, which means that I am only on the internet through Simon&#39;s and Linnaea&#39;s generousity with theirs. <br/>
<br/>
I can always rejoin at some future point. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682691276">Hi, Shonna<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, WoW is not my kind of game (nor was Runescape), so I&#39;ve <br/>
struggled to pay attention when my son has tried to explain the ins <br/>
and outs of it to me (the same as he has when I&#39;ve enthused about <br/>
FIFA Football!). Fortunately, he&#39;s willing to let me off the hook and <br/>
plays happily by himself without needing me to be intimately <br/>
involved. Although he still likes to share something occasionally. I <br/>
do recall a recent conversation about some kind of problem with the <br/>
guilds, but whatever it was he seems to have sorted it out himself.<br/>
