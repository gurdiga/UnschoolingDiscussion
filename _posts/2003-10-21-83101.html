       Thanks to Lee sharing, maybe the Chomsky article will even show up <br/>
there at some point. :)  JJ<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have just finished reading a very thought-provoking interview with Noam<br/>
&gt; Chomsky in the October issue of The Sun and wanted to pass along the<br/>
&gt; following quote of Chomsky&#39;s from that article:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     &quot;You have to be critical of whatever is presented to you in any media. <br/>
&gt; Of<br/>
&gt; course, the whole media system and the educational system are designed to<br/>
&gt; drive critical thoughts from your mind. You&#39;re taught to be a passive,<br/>
&gt; obedient follower. And unless you can break out of those habits, you&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt; a victim of propoganda. But it&#39;s not that hard to break out.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And, congratulations to each of you for breaking out - and for raising<br/>
&gt; critical thinkers!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Aloha, Lee<br/>
