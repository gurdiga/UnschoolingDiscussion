<div id="ygrps-yiv-598626340">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Many years ago, a friend&#39;s daughter, while in school, refused to say the <br/>
pledge (she was in the second grade, I think).  When the teacher asked her <br/>
why, she said she was a citizen of the world, not just this country, and so <br/>
she couldn&#39;t say the pledge.<br/>
<br/>
Of course she went on to become a homeschooler, until lately when she is <br/>
attending college. <br/>
<br/>
I thought she was wonderfully clever to realize her allegiances so early in <br/>
life.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My kids ain&#39;t pledging allegience to a country that only just <br/>
 tolerates my prescence here.<br/>

 I think it&#39;s strange that we pledge allegiance to a FLAG. Seems that we&#39;re <br/>
just pledging our loyalty to a piece of cloth that stands for the <br/>
country...ok, it does say &quot; AND to the republic for which it <br/>
stands.&quot;......still weird.  I don&#39;t see how people think it&#39;s fine and dandy <br/>
to have young children pledging  loyalty to something they don&#39;t even <br/>
understand. Sounds very Third Reich&#39;ish to me.<br/>
It did increase flag sales for the guy though!!  <br/>
