On July 30, 2001, my husband received a call from a man who stated he was a<br/>
student at New York University (NYU) and was doing a thesis on education. He<br/>
identified himself as Aaron Devonshire. He claimed he had read an article I<br/>
had written for the July/August 2001 issue of Home Education Magazine. At the<br/>
time, I was not home, but my husband spoke with him very briefly. My husband<br/>
suggested he speak with me.<br/>
<br/>
Later that evening, he called again. This time, I spoke with him for<br/>
approximately 20 minutes. He explained that he was a student at NYU, working<br/>
on a thesis. He said part of the project involved doing a survey of parents<br/>
regarding education. He went on to say the survey was studying both<br/>
traditional schooling and homeschooling. He asked some very generic<br/>
questions: How long have you been homeschooling? Why did you start<br/>
homeschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I did ask if he had REALLY read my article because these questions were<br/>
answered in that article. He claimed he did but wanted to verify.<br/>
<br/>
He then asked my opinion on whether I thought my kids were learning better or<br/>
the same in homeschooling. He asked if we used traditional materials or if I<br/>
put together my own curriculum.  Then, the conversation turned very strange.<br/>
He asked what kind of discipline I use in my homeschool. Did I use corporal<br/>
punishment? No, I told him I did not. He persisted, asking if I was sure I<br/>
never spanked the kids. I told him no, and I did not see what this had to do<br/>
with education.<br/>
<br/>
He went on to tell me that accorinding to his results, 82% of homeschoolers<br/>
use corporal punishment. He said that of those 82%, 62% use the &quot;traditional<br/>
method&quot;, spanking the child on the rear while the child lays across the<br/>
parents lap. He also told me that most of these parents use a paddle or some<br/>
other device to spank.<br/>
<br/>
I told him that our conversation was over, that I did not think corporal<br/>
punishment was relevant to a study on education. He then asked if he could<br/>
speak to my son. I told him my son was not interested. At this point, he<br/>
became upset, telling me I was a &quot;permissive parent&quot; for not making my son<br/>
speak to an adult. I told him that I would not make my son speak with anyone.<br/>
I then hung up the phone.<br/>
<br/>
The very next day, I decided to contact NYU. I was able to speak to a<br/>
gentleman in the admissions office by the name of Craig Griffin. He took all<br/>
of the information, including the phone numbers that showed up on my<br/>
Caller-ID, and told me he would see what he could come up with. Within an<br/>
hour, he called back to let me know that there is no such student registered<br/>
at the university. The phone numbers did not match any in their database,<br/>
either. He also said that a student doing a project would never ask to speak<br/>
to a child.<br/>
<br/>
I did receive one more call from the &quot;student&quot; on July 31. He asked for me,<br/>
and told me had some other questions. I told him I had questions, too, and<br/>
had called the university to inquire about him. I told him I knew he was a<br/>
fraud. He hung up on me immediately.<br/>
<br/>
The phone numbers used all came up on my Caller-ID as Connecticut phone<br/>
numbers. They all appear to be pay phone numbers.  The numbers are:<br/>
<br/>
203-255-8116<br/>
203-222-9987<br/>
203-261-9844<br/>
<br/>
The security at NYU is currently looking into this situation. As more<br/>
information becomes available, I will pass it on. In the meantime, all<br/>
homeschoolers should be aware of this man. He is a fraud.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134356650">The spanking-man sounds exactly like one who used to come into the AOL <br/>
chatroom and IM people and ask them about spanking.  Same, same stuff.  <br/>
