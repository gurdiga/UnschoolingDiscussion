<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619328301">&lt;&lt;But he thinks it should come to him as an epiphany and when it doesn&#39;t, he<br/>
thinks he is too stupid to learn it&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Speaking as a former math phobe, I&#39;d say he is both right and wrong here.  I<br/>
never &quot;got&quot; math.  I could perform the calculations but I never understood<br/>
what I was doing.  I simply memorized what went where and as soon as the<br/>
class was over, promptly forgot the equations.  I thought I was stupid in<br/>
math, regardless of the fact that I had a Bachelor of Science degree (heavy<br/>
on the math).<br/>
<br/>
Then when I was about 34, I truly did have an epiphany.  I wasn&#39;t &quot;trying&quot;<br/>
to learn something.  I was watching Bill Nye with my kids.  He was talking<br/>
about physics, again something I thought was just over my head for some<br/>
reason, figured I just didn&#39;t think that way.  Watching this video, the<br/>
light came on.  I already KNOW this stuff.  It is just putting labels on<br/>
things I already know.  Suddenly, I understood math.  The equations just<br/>
describe what I already know.  I can now remember the fractions stuff<br/>
because I know what I&#39;m doing with it.  I understand why the denominators<br/>
have to match to add and subtract.  I GOT IT!!!!<br/>
<br/>
So, I think your son is right in that math may well come to him as an<br/>
epiphany and wrong in that he isn&#39;t stupid, just not ready.<br/>
