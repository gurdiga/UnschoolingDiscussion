and I still enjoy hearing him and his simple but powerful wisdom.<br/>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
We tried so hard to make things better<br/>
for our kids that we made them<br/>
worse. For my grandchildren,<br/>
I&#39;d like better.<br/>
I&#39;d really like for them to know about hand-me-down clothes,<br/>
homemade ice-cream and meat loaf<br/>
sandwiches. I really would.<br/>
<br/>
My cherished grandson,<br/>
I hope you learn<br/>
humility by being humiliated, and that you learn<br/>
honesty by being cheated.<br/>
I hope you learn to make your bed and mow the lawn<br/>
and wash the car. And I<br/>
really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when<br/>
you are sixteen. I hope<br/>
you have a job by then.<br/>
<br/>
It will be good if at least one time you can see a<br/>
baby calf born and your<br/>
old dog put to sleep. I hope you get a black eye<br/>
fighting for something you<br/>
believe in. I hope you have to share a bedroom with<br/>
your younger brother.<br/>
And it&#39;s all right if you have to draw a line down<br/>
the middle of the room,<br/>
but when he wants to crawl under the covers with you<br/>
because he&#39;s scared, I<br/>
hope you let him. When you want to see a Disney<br/>
movie and your little<br/>
brother wants to tag along, I hope you&#39;ll let him. I<br/>
hope you have to walk<br/>
uphill to school with your friends and that you live<br/>
in a town where you can<br/>
do it safely.<br/>
<br/>
On rainy days when you have to catch a ride I hope<br/>
your driver doesn&#39;t have<br/>
to drop you two blocks away so you won&#39;t be seen<br/>
riding with someone as<br/>
uncool as your mom. If you want a slingshot, I hope<br/>
your dad teaches you to<br/>
make one instead of buying one. I hope you learn to<br/>
dig in the dirt and read<br/>
books. When you learn to use those newfangled<br/>
computers, I hope you also<br/>
learn to add and subtract in your head. I hope you<br/>
get razzed by your<br/>
friends when you have your first crush on a girl,<br/>
and when you talk back to<br/>
your mother that you learn what Ivory soap taste<br/>
like.<br/>
<br/>
May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn<br/>
your hand on a stove and<br/>
stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole. I hope you<br/>
get sick when someone<br/>
blows cigar smoke in your face. I don&#39;t care if you<br/>
try beer once, but I<br/>
hope you don&#39;t like it. And if a friend offers you<br/>
dope or a joint, I hope<br/>
you realize he&#39;s not your friend. I sure hope you<br/>
make time to sit on a<br/>
porch with your grandpa and go fishing with your<br/>
uncle.<br/>
<br/>
May you feel sorrow at a funeral and the joy of<br/>
holidays. I hope your mother<br/>
punishes you when you throw a baseball through the<br/>
neighbors window and<br/>
that she hugs you at Christmas time when you give<br/>
her a plaster of Paris<br/>
mold of your hand.<br/>
<br/>
These things I wish for you - tough times and<br/>
disappointment, hard work and<br/>
happiness.<br/>
<br/>
Written with a pen.<br/>
