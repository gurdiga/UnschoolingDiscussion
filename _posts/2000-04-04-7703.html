<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728794583">I&#39;m in the SW Michigan area.  During election years, I poll the <br/>
candidates in Kalamazoo, VB, St. Jo, and Calhoun, on homeschooling <br/>
issues.<br/>
<br/>
For example, this year I am definitely going to ask them about sports <br/>
participation and homeschoolers having to register to avoid truancy <br/>
prosecution.  Two bills which have been brought up recently.<br/>
<br/>
I also ask fringe-related parenting questions. One I asked before<br/>
was, <br/>
&quot;we&#39;ve heard a lot about government-funded daycare for low income <br/>
families.  What about tax benefits for parents to care for their own <br/>
children?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one I&#39;m considering this time around: should people whose <br/>
welfare benefits have run out and are now working, have the right to <br/>
parent their children at least a minimum amount of time (of the Flint <br/>
school shooting, the mom says she was working two jobs, taking two <br/>
buses, as she was kicked off welfare, was unable to provide <br/>
supervision, the government says daycare is available and they could <br/>
have kept her from being evicted, but I&#39;m wondering if parents <br/>
providing money is a higher priority than their being present to <br/>
provide moral guidance?)<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of sides to each question I ask, so I try to ask <br/>
without any slant, so the candidates will speak their minds. The <br/>
results are very enlightening.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions for questionnaire items would</div>
