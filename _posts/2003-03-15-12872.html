<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Have any of your seen articles in the main stream press about unschooling?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>There was a homeschooling in Stars and Stripes a few weeks ago that talked<br/>
about unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
They got it from the Chicago Tribune, which had it in on January 19th.<br/>
Author was Grant Pick and I found it in the archives, but you have to pay<br/>
for it.  I&#39;ve emailed Stars and Strips about getting it on their web site,<br/>
but haven&#39;t heard back yet.<br/>
