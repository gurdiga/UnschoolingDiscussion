<div id="ygrps-yiv-796872784">Hey<br/>
<br/>
My kids are all night owls, we have discovered. The other night, <br/>
Katie stayed up playing computer quietly. They are so noisy when <br/>
they&#39;re up together, but alone, each kid can be very quiet, and so <br/>
while the other two went downstairs, she stayed up. We shut the door <br/>
to our bedroom and went to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
at 3:15, Katie paged the cordless phone. She was hitting the hay, and <br/>
wanted to hang it up. (I did tell her not to call anyone! L) The <br/>
phone was in my room, because I had been talking to my grown boy <br/>
before I went to sleep. Brought the phone out, Katie hung it up, and <br/>
I said &quot;You winding down?&quot; and she said &quot;yes&quot;...nestling herself into <br/>
a blanket on the couch with an electronic language game in her hand.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how long it took her, but the next day (yesterday) she <br/>
showed me a big piece of paper with over 100 words written on it. It <br/>
was the list of words one can get when playing Word Mine (anagrams) <br/>
with the name jrrtolkien. 125 words, three letters and above. She is <br/>
very proud of this accomplishment, and I don&#39;t blame her. <br/>
<br/>
The list was in order...i.e., all the words starting with ro were in <br/>
the same spot on the list...and she was ticking off words as she <br/>
noticed their patterns. Still...ARGH...wasn&#39;t reading them, but it is <br/>
fascinating to watch this literacy burgeoning in my &quot;Late Starting <br/>
Reader Who Stays Up VERY Late&quot; <br/>

This is cool to read.  In real life, we have no friends that allow <br/>
their children to stay up so....again, nice to read.<br/>
<br/>
 We also have night owls here and I am always amazed at what <br/>
transpires in the wee hours of the night.  They seem to get so <br/>
philosophical at these times,  its like their minds just open up. <br/>
This is also the time that they seem to be so curious and <br/>
inquisitive. <br/>
<br/>
My challenge is to try and get my eyelids to stay open so I can also <br/>
be part of this time.   Not only to answer questions from them but <br/>
also just to enjoy their company-- to hang out with them.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose some people would say the day hours could be my time with <br/>
them.  Evening hours could be their time together.   <br/>
<br/>
But there is a different dynamics going on at night.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
what, but they are all lit up.   I guess it does seem to balance <br/>
out.  Some days we spend time together during the day and less in <br/>
the evening.  But if we&#39;ve been busy doing our own things during the <br/>
day, we can reconnect in the night.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I guess maybe I&#39;m selfish for their time.  I  want it all!  All the <br/>
experiences! &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Its just fun being with them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That happens here too, not just to my kids but to me as well!  I&#39;m <br/>
much more creative and philisophical in the wee hours of the night <br/>
than during the rest of the day.   I wonder what it is about those <br/>
wee hours that brings that out in (some of) us? <br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s the knowledge that people aren&#39;t going to change your plan, the <br/>
phone is not going to ring, salesmen and missionaries are home asleep, and the <br/>
house is REALLY ours.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have to wonder if my kids would rather be somewhere else instead of <br/>
with me, because we&#39;re in for the night.   And one can bail and go to bed <br/>
without making the rest of them &quot;go home&quot; because we&#39;re already home.   There&#39;s a <br/>
really comfortable wind-down, and the one left up last doesn&#39;t feel abandoned, <br/>
but rather has the electronics to himself, the last of the food is really all <br/>
his without negotiation if he wants it, and he&#39;s free to go to bed or not <br/>
without discussion with others.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s cool through all phases of it.<br/>

I have an essay up about latenight learning and I added a couple of the <br/>
accounts above to the commentary page.   There was already one thing there.<br/>
