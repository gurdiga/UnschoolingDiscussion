<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026343293">Another article in a college newspaper.  This one&#39;s from University <br/>
of California Santa Cruz.  I thought it was pretty positive.  And <br/>
both education professors interviewed were positive about unschooling.<br/>

One of my quotes got a little mangled though.  She wrote:  &#39;<br/>
&quot;Every once in awhile I get a bug in my head saying, &#39;Gosh, I don&#39;t <br/>
think I know that this is out there in the world,&#39;&quot; Tellew said. &quot;I <br/>
started telling them about math and they didn&#39;t really care. Pushing <br/>
that kind of stuff is what gives people that resistance.&quot; She would <br/>
rather her children follow something that excites them. &#39;<br/>
<br/>
What I said was, &quot;Every once in a while, I get a little bug in my <br/>
head saying, &#39;Gosh, I don&#39;t think they (my kids) know that this is <br/>
out there in the world.&#39;  Then I told her about how I&#39;d recently been <br/>
on a little math jag of my own, learning about Fibonacci numbers for <br/>
the first time, and when I showed my kids they weren&#39;t interested at <br/>
the time, so I dropped it.  My son thought the way it was written <br/>
made them sound anti math, which they aren&#39;t, just busy with <br/>
something else they cared more about at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and it wasn&#39;t exactly an unschooling camp-out where she <br/>
interviewed people but there were lots of unschoolers there.<br/>
<br/>
But overall, a pretty good article.  I loved that she quoted so many kids.<br/>
