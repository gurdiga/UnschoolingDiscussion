<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021645868">A couple days ago, my oldest, Noelle age 14, asked if she could dye her hair black.  Her natural color is a light brown.  I will be honest...this was hard for me...I&#39;m not totally sure why.    Well, I kind of know why...I had this silly thinking about her hair and how it has been the color it has been since she was a baby.  And that now she isn&#39;t may baby anymore.  Silly.  I mean, hair is just that -- hair.  So what if she changes her color?  If she isn&#39;t happy, it grows back.   But I told her she could, but we talked about things -- explained to her that permanent is permanent, but that yes, her real color would grow back in.  We also talked about how it can damage your hair.  I told her that she had to pay for it.<br/>
<br/>
So today she got it done and she loves it...I do think it looks pretty good...different, but good.  While this isn&#39;t about me, I do have to say that I feel rather proud that I let her make the decision on this.  A big step for me. <br/>

And you wonder what all the fuss was about.  ;)  Next time she might <br/>
want to try black henna.  That actually nourishes your hair and scalp <br/>
and it really inexpensive.  Also, I wouldn&#39;t make her pay for it, but <br/>
that&#39;s just me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This made me laugh with you because when I first started reading the<br/>
posts on this board, I was inspired to let go in a lot of situations<br/>
and shortly after I felt like I had my footing in the &quot;letting go&quot;<br/>
area, my 5 yo twin daughters asked for pink and blue hair. I went<br/>
online and found out how to dye it with Kool-Aid and I let them pick<br/>
out the little packets.  They picked out several colors and we<br/>
stockpiled a bunch for &quot;next time.&quot;  I have to say it was extremely<br/>
freeing for me and I think it was a big step in changing my thinking<br/>
to &quot;what&#39;s the big deal?&quot; about things, so congratulations to you. :)<br/>
BTW, they both ended up with pink, but they had plans to use orange<br/>
and green next time. It took about 2 1/2 weeks to wash out and I guess<br/>
they lost interest.  I was kind of disappointed that they didn&#39;t want<br/>
to go for another color right away.  Go figure.  <br/>

 <br/>
That&#39;s one of the surest ways to get a kid to lose interest in  something.  <br/>
Give it to them.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s better than being hounded for weeks while you think up reasons to  say <br/>
no and figure out a way not to be humiliated by your kid having green  hair.  <br/>
Just don&#39;t be humiliated by it.  Be empowered by empowering  your child.<br/>

It&#39;s hard, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
 <br/>
Holly paid to have hers done bright green last fall, and it involved  bleach.<br/>
Nowadays, she has brown roots over an inch long and yellowish-bleached  other <br/>
hair, and it&#39;s shoulder length.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too good looking  at this <br/>
point at all, but Holly just loves it!  And honestly, anyone who  rejects her <br/>
as a possible friend because of this is a &quot;good riddance&quot; case in my  <br/>
opinion.   AND she&#39;s willing to have her whole head shaved or cut  really short <br/>
if/when she gets tired of what it looks like, so it was never much  risk.  <br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve been talking about home-job streaks of new colors, with  home-bleach.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m very much NOT a girlie type and have never messed with bleach or perms,  <br/>
but there are websites galore and good directions on packages, so we might, or <br/>
 might not.<br/>
 <br/>
New learning for me.<br/>

  Lisa, 12, recently asked to dye the ends of her long, blond hair to black. <br/>
  ************************************<br/>
<br/>
  My daughter, 7,  has wanted to do this since June, but making the tips purple.  However, every time I ask her if she&#39;d &quot;like to do it today,&quot; she&#39;s always says she&#39;s busy.  I guess we&#39;ll do it when she brings it up.  Same with pierced ears.  My parents made me wait until I was in seventh grade.  I told Margaux that it might hurt, but won&#39;t hurt for very long, and that she can get her ears pierced whenever she feels ready.  She told me a few weeks ago that she&#39;s going to wait until she&#39;s 18.  lol  I don&#39;t know why.  Some of her friends have pierced ears.  Oh well.  It&#39;s fine with me either way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826019189">Rain (almost 12) did her hair black maybe a month ago. It&#39;s actually<br/>
blue-black, and in the sun it&#39;s more blue. Garnier 210 Blue-Black. She<br/>
also cut it. This is the first time in 2 1/2 years that she hasn&#39;t been<br/>
in a show, so she&#39;s trying out  some things. We did the bleach and dye<br/>
thing when she was 7 and 8 - Special Effects rocks, she did blue, green,<br/>
and then pink, I think - but the black didn&#39;t require bleach.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-757531206">Seamus just recently got his beautiful long red hair cut (the hair <br/>
stylist almost gave him a girly bob style, thinking he was a girl!! <br/>
eek), and the first couple of days i thought it looked really cool. <br/>
I gelled it into a kind of quasi mohawk thing and he looked rather <br/>
like a little rock star, even got comments from strangers &quot;cool hair <br/>
man!&quot; He was happy people finally knew he is a boy when we&#39;re out.<br/>
<br/>
Then he took the scissors to it so the front is realllly short and <br/>
uneven and it makes me cringe. He says he likes it that way. I have <br/>
to keep repeating my mantra to myself &quot;it&#39;ll grow it&#39;ll grow it&#39;ll <br/>
grow&quot;. So far he doesnt want to dye it, but i&#39;d happily do it if he <br/>
wants. <br/>
