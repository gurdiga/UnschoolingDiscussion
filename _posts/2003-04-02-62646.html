<div id="ygrps-yiv-760394317">Dear Nancy,<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your 7 year old.<br/>
I have a six year old son followed by 2 daughters,<br/>
ages 4 1/2 and 2 1/2.<br/>
<br/>
I think our children will take all we have to give them,<br/>
essentially,<br/>
even up to the wee hours of the evening,<br/>
regardless,<br/>
if we have it in us to keep giving.<br/>
<br/>
Being new to this site, I find myself keep referring<br/>
to &quot;the Balance&quot; of it all.<br/>
<br/>
Giving to ourself, our partner, and being unschoolers,<br/>
giving, giving, giving to our children.<br/>
<br/>
On a Buddhist Bent,<br/>
and as a dear friend reminded me today,<br/>
Being in the Moment, Being Present is truly all<br/>
we have to offer.<br/>
<br/>
But for bedtime advice,<br/>
I have acquired a series of audiotapes that my son<br/>
gladly listens to in bed before sleep for 2 flip sides on end.<br/>
<br/>
From the library, we have listened to a lot of the Beverly Cleary titles,<br/>
and from the book store, we are collecting the Magic Tree House Series.<br/>
Harry Potter on tape made  his head hurt (interesting) and we are finding in<br/>
time, what author&#39;s we like, the voiceovers are of interest;<br/>
We both thoroughly enjoyed Trumpet of the Swan by E.B. White.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think it all comes down to not feeling worthy of<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything. Common but devastating.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think you nailed it right there, and that feeling paralizes me<br/>
sometimes.<br/>
&gt; The food thing comes and goes, I have worked to de-food myself, and to try<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; adopt healthy habits instead of dropping bad ones. It is working somewhat.<br/>
&gt; My son is 7 and very much always wanting to interact with me. I think he<br/>
&gt; feels me pull away and pushes harder for his own survival. i am going to<br/>
&gt; attack the bedtime issue tonight. wish me luck<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
&gt; Nancy<br/>

Funny what you discover when you step back and look at a situation. I am <br/>
exhausted. no wonder I have little left to give at night. Yet, I would not <br/>
trade this job or way of doing things for all the gold(or donuts) in the <br/>
world!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow. How does she get the cat to go in the water with her? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Funny what you discover when you step back and look at a situation.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So true. It works with our own thoughts and emotions too. Just step back and <br/>
look at them instead of being overwhelmed by them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932326267">ugh, can I relate to the relentless two year old! I have one of my own. She is on the other side of two though (she will be three in a couple months) but she is constantly on the go and I am constantly trying to be with her there to avoid her killing herself! Good luck!
