punched in the face) by her parents but she doesn&#39;t have the courage to report them? <br/>

would call the police or social services right away.  That way they can <br/>

she doesn&#39;t have the visible signs and still won&#39;t admit it, it could <br/>
make the abuse that much worse.  But, if you know for sure and can be <br/>
witness to it, especially when the police are there, it may help her to <br/>
feel safer and open up about the abuse.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t not do something.  Especially if the abuse got so bad she <br/>
was hospitalized or died from it. I would personally feel horrible if I <br/>
didn&#39;t speak up about it.   This is an innocent child who deserves some <br/>
protection and is obviously not getting it at home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-833591864">You should report them.  I&#39;m a manditory reporter, which means that I <br/>
have to report if I suspect abuse.  It takes away the decision, which is <br/>
sometimes good and sometimes bad.  But I would call on this one, regardless.<br/>

hate the thought of doing nothing. Do you think giving a time frame - like if we see any <br/>
evidence, we&#39;ll call for you to protect you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty worried about her. She&#39;s acting out in lots of dangerous ways... :( So sad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845141022">Part of the issue is that she may believe that she only <br/>
was &quot;punished&quot; for things that she shouldn&#39;t have done, <br/>
i.e. &quot;deserved it&quot;. When I discussed parents hitting/spanking <br/>
children with a 16 y/o, she BELIEVED that it only happens when her <br/>
siblings don&#39;t do what they are supposed to/behave right. <br/>
<br/>
This belief is the problem. It is part of the abuse.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps someone can replace this belief that no one deserves to be <br/>
hit.  Maybe some family that she has known for years but who never <br/>
KNEW this was happenening, could be a source to displace this <br/>
ingrained thinking. Strangers are going to be harder to &quot;trust&quot; when <br/>
you haven&#39;t learned trust in one&#39;s own family.<br/>
<br/>
The issue also may be fear for the younger children. What would <br/>
happen to them? When one can not protect themself, it is harder to <br/>
conceive of being able to protect others. How to stay together? <br/>
<br/>
I know that having experienced abuse, although not to this degree, I <br/>
know trusting others is a difficult obsticle to changing one&#39;s <br/>
beliefs. <br/>
<br/>
I found the internet was an authoritative source of information about <br/>
abuse. When I read that what I had experienced in childhood included <br/>
the whole syndrome of identifing with the aggressor and internalizing <br/>
their feelings as &quot;my fault&quot; it helped me to quit believing the &quot;I <br/>
have no choice&quot; thinking/fears. Counseling has helped me too. Is any <br/>
sort of counseling available from someone who as also experienced <br/>
this type of abuse?<br/>
<br/>
The internet is easier to &quot;trust&quot; than people who might end up <br/>
hurting you. Perhaps you could find some useful sites for her to read <br/>
according to her age.<br/>
<br/>
Once she KNOWS she doesn&#39;t deserve to be treated this way, she can <br/>
choose to change the situation. It may get worse before it gets <br/>
better, because if she is not psychologically able to speak up for <br/>
herself, she can not protect her siblings and that is a great threat <br/>
in itself. <br/>
<br/>
She needs people she can trust. The longer she knows someone the more <br/>
she will be able to identify with their healthier beliefs. There <br/>
isn&#39;t an easy way to learn to trust. I am still learning at 42 y/o.<br/>

healthier skills/tools to deal with their own problems. Perhaps <br/>
suggesting counseling sources to the parents. I am sure DSS has <br/>
resources for parents. Perhaps a social worker could help the family <br/>
utilize the resources that are available financially, psychologically <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650939557">** We did a three-way call with her and social services last night (she <br/>
remained anonymous)<br/>
so tha she could at least hear the voice and procedures and know what <br/>
they will do for<br/>
her. It still wasn&#39;t enough to get her over that hump.**<br/>
<br/>
Do you think her biggest concern is getting tossed into foster care?  Or <br/>
is she more worried that the parental violence will escalate if she <br/>
makes a report?<br/>
I don&#39;t know what her situation is and if their are other family members <br/>
she can live with.<br/>
<br/>
Are her parents sober when they hit her?  Or are there substance abuse <br/>
issues making this ugly situation worse.  (It seems like there might be <br/>
extra tips and extra resources if this is a drinking or drugging problem.)<br/>
<br/>
**She&#39;s acting out in lots of dangerous ways... :( So sad.**<br/>
<br/>
Can she find additional counseling, on top of what she&#39;s getting from <br/>
you, from a peer counselor who was a wild teen, or from counselors at <br/>
school?  (OK, the school counselors are mandatory reporters, so that may <br/>
not be what she wants to do.  I was just thinking that she needs some <br/>
good advice and may need it to be more than &quot;confidential&quot;, she may need <br/>
it to be &quot;invisible&quot; to her parents.<br/>

are fantastic.....some are criminal.  The teen sees reporting the abuse as<br/>

homes (until the cycle starts again).  The child (and adult victims as well)<br/>
focus on that and don&#39;t want to lose the little bit of &quot;good family&quot; they<br/>

There is a difference between eye witnessing an assault and talking to<br/>
parents after the fact, basically saying &quot;your child told on you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My dad is a peace officer, my dh rides the ambulance, we listen to the<br/>
police scanner.  Police get called to families over and over again on abuse.<br/>
Letting the family know that you know it is going on doesn&#39;t stop it,<br/>
doesn&#39;t make them go to counseling.  It might make you feel better but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t solve the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Asking a child to have the courage and power of will that most adults don&#39;t<br/>
have is asking too much.  Most abused women stay exactly where they are even<br/>
though they have much more resources and control over their lives than a<br/>
teen.<br/>

sometimes parents do horrible things to kids after they are shown to be &quot;bad&quot; parents in <br/>
public.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a difference between eye witnessing an assault and talking to<br/>
&gt; parents after the fact, basically saying &quot;your child told on you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Agreed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My dad is a peace officer, my dh rides the ambulance, we listen to the<br/>
&gt; police scanner.  Police get called to families over and over again on abuse.<br/>
&gt; Letting the family know that you know it is going on doesn&#39;t stop it,<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t make them go to counseling.  It might make you feel better but it<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t solve the problem.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the conclusion we came to today. I called.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, she was hit again today. Boyfriend called the cops. So we are finally getting <br/>
somewhere, even though I&#39;m sure she&#39;s scared to death. :(<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Asking a child to have the courage and power of will that most adults don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have is asking too much.  Most abused women stay exactly where they are even<br/>
&gt; though they have much more resources and control over their lives than a<br/>
&gt; teen.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what pushed me to call. We (dh and I) realized that it was worth it to allow this girl <br/>
the chance/dignity to report herself, but since she can&#39;t bring herself to do it, we felt we <br/>
must.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone for your help. It was enormously supportive.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141050542">&lt;&lt;&lt;I doubt ALL the experts have ever agreed on any one thing.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right. It is not ALL, as you say.<br/>
<br/>
I had been browsing online about child abuse a few weeks ago, and found a<br/>
number of websites, I guess coming primarily from medical and legal<br/>
standpoints. Those were the people who were saying that speaking to the<br/>
parents was not the best option.<br/>
<br/>
They also had lengthy legal definitions as to what constitutes child abuse.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I know an adult and I talk to the adult, no expert or social worker has<br/>
<br/>
the right to tell me not to.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They seem to think it doesn&#39;t work to protect the child as well as telling<br/>
social workers does. This is not in the same league as reporting someone<br/>
because their kids are in the yard in the morning - which of course is a<br/>
hotbutton on a homeschooling list. This life threatening abuse is the real<br/>
reason social services exist.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;That&#39;s the same kind of advice followed when the woman at<br/>
whichever/wherever <br/>
Walmart was spanking/beating/throwing her daughter, and people were so proud<br/>
<br/>
that eight or some peole had called the police.  But someone (experts be <br/>
damned) should have said &quot;STOP IT.&quot;  Or made her stop.   And the other seven<br/>
could <br/>
call the police or whatever chickenshit thing they wanted to do.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the parents are pushing their daughter down the stairs in<br/>
front of Julie. They are waiting until they can hurt her in private. It is<br/>
not either/or. In a case of abuse isn&#39;t it saying &quot;stop it&quot; *if you can do<br/>
so safely* AND calling the authorities. <br/>
<br/>
Also in a situation where a person is being abused, it is not like dealing<br/>
with some ordinary problem of having a disagreement or difference of<br/>
opinion. Being abused changes the way you think about yourself, your self<br/>
esteem, that issue of feeling like it is your fault as someone mentioned,<br/>
and that you (the victim) could have done something to prevent it by being<br/>
&quot;better&quot;. The abused person is not necessarily thinking logically. Abused<br/>
children feel bad about making their father or mother disappointed in them<br/>
by reporting. <br/>
<br/>
Nor does it usually start with the full blown push down the stairs, or<br/>
bloody nose. Nor does it end there.<br/>
<br/>
What if Julie became aware that her neighbor&#39;s husband was beating her, but<br/>
in conversations the woman came up with all the browbeaten usual stuff to<br/>
prevent Julie from calling anyone. What if another night Julie heard a<br/>
scream, should she go over and say &quot;Stop it&quot;, incidentally risking getting<br/>
beaten herself, or should she call the police? Why is it different when it<br/>
is a teen, and the scream is metaphorical?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway this is all somewhat moot. Julie has already posted about the<br/>
conference call they made.<br/>
<br/>
If fear of being called a &quot;chickenshit&quot; is going to stop someone from<br/>
calling the police next time, I think it is a shame. It seems likely they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be brave enough to go up and stay &quot;Stop it&quot; in the parking lot<br/>
anyway. <br/>
<br/>
In Julie&#39;s situation I would have called the 800 number and reported it,<br/>
because frankly if I didn&#39;t my dh would. The only problem with offering her<br/>
a place to stay is that the parents would then know where to find her. A<br/>
women&#39;s shelter, where the addresses are confidential might be a better<br/>
place. <br/>
<br/>
These are some of the sites I was looking at before. Maybe there is some<br/>
helpful information there.<br/>

<br/>
I caused a dad to stop.<br/>
Parents were separated.    I knew them both.  I had a long talk with the dad <br/>
and threatened his future in the SCA first, and his visitation second, and he <br/>
was a nicer dad from then on.<br/>
<br/>
The mom was nicer too, as a secondary thing.  Before that, it was a cinch for <br/>
her to be nicer than the dad, because he was being a turd, but when he <br/>
started competing, she had to be nicer too.<br/>

<br/>
In our old neighborhood I went to my neighbors one morning early (6:40 a.m. <br/>
or so) when they were yelling loud enough to hear from my house and my knock on <br/>
the door pushed the door open.  There I was in the living room.  I realized I <br/>
was holding baby Holly.  I was really angry.  They had had police come a <br/>
couple of times already.  What I had heard from my house was &quot;You WANT me to hit <br/>
you don&#39;t you?  You want me to hit you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They had a little boy who played with Kirby and Marty.  We used to keep him <br/>
sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;Shut the fuck up.  Just stop it.&quot;    I told them I could hear them <br/>
from my house, and it was early and he started in on me about me probably being <br/>
the one who had called the police on them, and I said no, I hadn&#39;t, but I was <br/>
going to be the next one.  He said get out of his house.  I said I was leaving <br/>
but he&#39;d better cool it and if I heard anything else I WAS calling the police.<br/>
<br/>
I went home and called Keith, who came home and talked to him for a long time.<br/>
Things got better.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s because they knew they were wrong and didn&#39;t want to be arrested <br/>
again.  Maybe it&#39;s because Keith and I werethere, and they knew we weren&#39;t <br/>
afraid of them.<br/>
<br/>
The police had been called twice before (that I knew of).  That hadn&#39;t made <br/>
much difference.  Our going over there seemed to have more impact.<br/>
<br/>
-=If fear of being called a &quot;chickenshit&quot; is going to stop someone from<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think calling the police and hoping it does some good is as brave or <br/>
immediately useful as stopping the problem before it gets worse.  I do think <br/>
it&#39;s much better than doing nothing  But in that parking lot story, had it been <br/>
a man striking a woman, lots of men would have tried to stop it.  Because it <br/>
was a child, people were afraid to interfere.<br/>

Not all social workers are stupid, and not all foster homes are bad.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You were very brave and strong. You did good for some other people. <br/>
<br/>
However, your bravery and Keith going to talk to them may have meant nothing<br/>
without the threat of the police to be called to back you up. Just as you<br/>
had a certain power over the other man because of your position in or<br/>
connection to SCA.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned access to counseling. That could be very good for Julie&#39;s<br/>
young friend.<br/>
<br/>
What power did Julie hold over that other family, of two adults who were NOT<br/>
separated and may stand together in adversity, other than the threat of the<br/>
police/CPS? Maybe she had none. Now it has moved to another level.<br/>
<br/>
In California there is a three stikes law. The threat of a third phone call<br/>
*could* be a very powerful deterrent in some situations. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes professionals are useful and can help us. I&#39;d rather have a<br/>
professional lawyer, and a professional surgeon, and a professional dentist,<br/>
if I need those services, even if I think a professional schoolteacher is<br/>
not necessary for my daughter. <br/>

victim of domestic violence.  That&#39;s almost 1 in 3.  I happen to be one of the 31%.  I <br/>
also experienced being the witness of domestic abuse as a child as well as being <br/>
attacked a few times myself.  Because of my experiences, which were terrifying and <br/>
painful, I don&#39;t think I could make the same choice you did, however, I would not <br/>
hesitate for a moment to call the police!  <br/>
<br/>
As far as the Walmart thing, I agree, that if it were a woman, someone would have <br/>
stopped it, even I would have tried, being that it was in a public place.  I agree that <br/>
these people did not intervene themselves because of that &quot;don&#39;t want to interfere&quot; <br/>
thing with a child and parent.  However, at least these people didn&#39;t chuck it up to <br/>
&quot;discipline&quot; and do nothing.  I don&#39;t think they were chickenshit, conversely, I think <br/>
that hindsight is 20/20 and that they probably wish they had intervined themselves <br/>
after all was said and done.  Confidence in ones self is something that a lot of people <br/>
are lacking, myself included, and that tends to paralyse people for a moment or a <br/>
lifetime.<br/>

is stop the violence NOW and many times that can prevent hospitalization, emergency <br/>
room visits or worse.<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s visit probably worked well because it was after the fact.  You can&#39;t reason with <br/>
these people in the middle of their rages.  However, you could call the police to stop <br/>
it and then choose to visit at a time of peace, and have a heart to heart.   <br/>

brave would be to step in themselves.  Calling the police IS immediately useful, <br/>
especially if you fear for your own safety.  What it is not, I will state again, it is not a <br/>
solution.  If they are lucky enough to have a neighbor like you then maybe, just <br/>
maybe, they will see the error in their ways with some talking to.  However, my <br/>
experience has been that most of the time, they won&#39;t change.<br/>

<br/>
I have been thinking further about this, and it occurs to me that there is a<br/>
particular reason that I consider what Sandra did to be extraordinarily<br/>
brave. I would absolutely be too afraid to confront a loudly violent<br/>
neighbor directly. <br/>
<br/>
I live in Los Angeles, mecca of gangs. It is more than merely possible that<br/>
the violent neighbor might have a gun and/or be a gang member. It is<br/>
actually pretty likely. Too likely to risk for me. We call the local station<br/>
(not 911) for loud shouting at night, gunfire or scary odd lurkers in the<br/>
alley. We have done it four or five times in the last seven years that we<br/>
have lived here. <br/>
<br/>
Admittedly the gang and drug activity in my *immediate* neighborhood is<br/>
fairly low. However the signs, such as graffiti, are increasing, and the<br/>
heart of it is within just a few miles. No shoes on the power lines yet, at<br/>
least. A woman in my local group had a drive-by shooting directly outside<br/>
her front gate last year, in an area considered &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;family<br/>
friendly&quot;. The shrine was there for months.<br/>
<br/>
The drug dealers down the street seemed to have moved, possibly after a few<br/>
of the locals (including dh) complained - to the police in patrolling squad<br/>
cars - about the endless stream of vehicles parking illegally in the alley<br/>
at all hours.<br/>
<br/>
I think part of the reason there is a strongish<br/>
police presence in our area is the Airport - we get LAPD *and* Airport<br/>
Police, and occasionally Bomb Squad, driving by. That and an ongoing attempt<br/>
to deter the street racers who love the Parkway. Huge increases in this<br/>
after that movie and its sequel came out. Only one small floral shrine that<br/>
has been kept up and renewed for years.<br/>
<br/>
Unlucky criminal story: A man tried to mug at gunpoint another guy at the<br/>
end of our street, by the high school, last year sometime as I recall.<br/>
Unfortunately for the mugger he chose an off duty FBI agent, and ended up<br/>
shot dead for his trouble. No shrine in this case. <br/>
<br/>
Before we were dating, James and I were on our way to meet up with some<br/>
colleagues after work. It was in Hollywood, not a spectacularly safe city,<br/>
but we had parked to walk only one block to the main road. We were mugged at<br/>
gunpoint by two well-spoken polite young men. One had a revolver and the<br/>
other some kind of automatic pistol. When they told us to walk away, I<br/>
thought I was going to die, but fortunately they just ran off in the other<br/>
direction with my bag and his wallet. <br/>
<br/>
An early morning jogger found my bag the next day, and called me. They had<br/>
left my credit cards, but taken my cash, the nasty sweaty shorts I had been<br/>
wearing at work earlier (creepy), and pager. For several months, when I had<br/>
replaced the pager, I received a lot of odd pages from people confused by me<br/>
returning their page. I passed each of these numbers on to the detective in<br/>
charge of this case. Evidently they were drug customers looking for their<br/>
dealer. This was before the universality of cel phones.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-114974147">Someone mentioned earlier about the girl being worried about the <br/>
younger children.  I&#39;ll add from experience that when I was being <br/>
abused, I understood also my mother&#39;s codependence w/my stepfather.  <br/>
I rationalized that while I only had to live with it a few more <br/>
years, my mother couldn&#39;t live without a man, and had often chosen <br/>
standing up to him to standing up to me, like when I told her he was <br/>
being sexually inappropriate w/me and she replied that he would <br/>
never do that.  I was not willing to &quot;wreck our home,&quot; knowing that <br/>
he didn&#39;t seem to abuse my brothers and that my mother did not want <br/>
to be without him.  So I stuck it out.  When I finally tried to <br/>
commit suicide, my stepfather didn&#39;twant me in counselling.  So I <br/>
didn&#39;t go.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I really wish one of my friends had talked to their <br/>
parents about what was happening and that an adult had stepped in.  <br/>
Sometimes I&#39;m glad noone stepped in.  <br/>
<br/>
I also feared being in an unknown situation.  Sometimes the evil you <br/>
know is easier than the evil you don&#39;t.  Furthermore, most abuse is <br/>
about power.  When someone holds power over you it is hard to look <br/>
past that.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t give you advice, Julie.  But I can tell you: I survived ... <br/>
I survived being beaten, I survived a suicide attempt, I survived <br/>
sexual inappropriateness and even found the strength to say &quot;no&quot; <br/>
when it began to evolve into something far worse.  In many ways I&#39;m <br/>
a stronger person and a better mom because of it.  In some ways <br/>
not.  Lots of people are abused in far worse ways than I was.  Lots <br/>
of them survive, too.  Some don&#39;t.  Or some survive and go on to be <br/>
self-destructive.  I was fortunate when I was 19 to have a friend <br/>
recognize that I was suicidal and help me get counselling.  That <br/>
helped me take back the power I&#39;d lost and break out of a cycle of <br/>
being involved in abuseive relationships.  I feel fortunate I had a <br/>
friend who saw it and got it; sometimes I wonder what would have <br/>
happened if she hadn&#39;t intervened.  <br/>
<br/>
I called CPS once because of a large buildup of neglect with a child <br/>
I cared for.  Sometimes I&#39;m sorry I called, as they looked in, <br/>
nothing happened, and things did not get at all better and probably <br/>
were a bit worse for a while.  Our child protective system does not <br/>
really seem to be based on rules or laws, and that makes it <br/>
difficult.  <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re afraid to call CPS, if the girl is in school maybe start <br/>
by talking to her guidance counsellor.  I agree that talking to her <br/>
parents might not be the way to go; someone once spoke to my <br/>
stepfather about what he was doing to me.  He was angry and <br/>
embarrased and beat the hell out of me to get his rage out.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365518026">I, too, would have called the 800 number and reported the abuse.  My problem with talking to the parents is that it would only enrage them, risking a really nasty beating for the child as a result.  <br/>
 <br/>
Yes, offering any victim of abuse a place to stay means putting yourself, and your own family, at risk.  The most dangerous time in an abused woman&#39;s life is when she leaves her abuser, I have to think the same would be true for a child trying to escape.  Invite her into your home and you&#39;ve invited in the same danger.  <br/>
 <br/>
Personally, I think everyone should feel an obligation to be a mandatory reporter.  The real problem is that, in some states (New Mexico, for example) parents can do abusive things to their child in the name of discipline, and even social services thinks it&#39;s okay.  As long as it&#39;s legal for parents to hit a child in any way, there will be levels of interpretation -- some workers and agencies won&#39;t have a problem with paddles, belts, etc.  <br/>

I&#39;m glad you called social services, Julie, and it&#39;s good to hear her boyfriend called the police.  No matter how this plays out, she needs counseling -- and real life models of good relationship skills --  because it&#39;s not uncommon for abused children to become abused wives (been there, lived that) or abusers themselves.  <br/>

The only problem with offering her a place to stay is that the parents would then know where to find her. A women&#39;s shelter, where the addresses are confidential might be a better place. <br/>

&gt; They seem to think it doesn&#39;t work to protect the child as well as telling<br/>

&gt; ===========<br/>
&gt; Professional teachers are sure what we do doesn&#39;t serve achild as well as<br/>
&gt; sending them to professionals does.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Professionals will professionally assure people they&#39;re the only chance<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-This life threatening abuse is the real<br/>
&gt; reason social services exist.<br/>
&gt;  -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think they exist to make sure people have food and utilities first.<br/>
&gt; Welfare.<br/>
&gt; And medical services.  Social workers often ensure people&#39;s access to<br/>
medical<br/>
&gt; services or counselling or rehab.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=- In a case of abuse isn&#39;t it saying &quot;stop it&quot; *if you can do<br/>
&gt; so safely* AND calling the authorities.<br/>
&gt; -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not all social workers are bright and not all foster homes are good.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-What if another night Julie heard a<br/>
&gt; scream, should she go over and say &quot;Stop it&quot;, incidentally risking getting<br/>
&gt; beaten herself, or should she call the police?-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In our old neighborhood I went to my neighbors one morning early (6:40<br/>
a.m.<br/>
&gt; or so) when they were yelling loud enough to hear from my house and my<br/>
knock on<br/>
&gt; the door pushed the door open.  There I was in the living room.  I<br/>
realized I<br/>
&gt; was holding baby Holly.  I was really angry.  They had had police come a<br/>
&gt; couple of times already.  What I had heard from my house was &quot;You WANT me<br/>
to hit<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t you?  You want me to hit you?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They had a little boy who played with Kirby and Marty.  We used to keep<br/>
him<br/>
&gt; sometimes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I said &quot;Shut the fuck up.  Just stop it.&quot;    I told them I could hear them<br/>
&gt; from my house, and it was early and he started in on me about me probably<br/>
being<br/>
&gt; the one who had called the police on them, and I said no, I hadn&#39;t, but I<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; going to be the next one.  He said get out of his house.  I said I was<br/>
leaving<br/>
&gt; but he&#39;d better cool it and if I heard anything else I WAS calling the<br/>
police.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I went home and called Keith, who came home and talked to him for a long<br/>
time.<br/>
&gt; Things got better.<br/>
&gt; Maybe it&#39;s because they knew they were wrong and didn&#39;t want to be<br/>
arrested<br/>
&gt; again.  Maybe it&#39;s because Keith and I werethere, and they knew we weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; afraid of them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The police had been called twice before (that I knew of).  That hadn&#39;t<br/>
made<br/>
&gt; much difference.  Our going over there seemed to have more impact.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=If fear of being called a &quot;chickenshit&quot; is going to stop someone from<br/>
&gt; calling the police next time, I think it is a shame. It seems likely they<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be brave enough to go up and stay &quot;Stop it&quot; in the parking lot<br/>
&gt; anyway.<br/>
&gt; -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think calling the police and hoping it does some good is as brave<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; immediately useful as stopping the problem before it gets worse.  I do<br/>
think<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s much better than doing nothing  But in that parking lot story, had it<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; a man striking a woman, lots of men would have tried to stop it.  Because<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; was a child, people were afraid to interfere.<br/>

Keith&#39;s visit probably worked well because it was after the fact.  You can&#39;t <br/>
reason with <br/>
these people in the middle of their rages. <br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t trying to reason with them.<br/>
I was threatening them.<br/>
<br/>
And Keith only talked to the husband, literally leaning on the truck out in <br/>
front of both our houses, and got him calm and tried to reason with him.  And <br/>
it all had an underlying threat and a kind of &quot;I can&#39;t keep my wife from <br/>
calling if this happens again,&quot; and a big dose of &quot;If you&#39;re stronger you have a <br/>
duty to control yourself&quot; (generic martial arts/chivalry kind of principles).<br/>
<br/>
=&#92;= However, you could call the police to stop <br/>
it and then choose to visit at a time of peace, and have a heart to heart.   <br/>
=&#92;=<br/>
<br/>
Quite as with drunks and druggies, sometimes when people aren&#39;t in the midst <br/>
of their rage, they&#39;re different people and hardly even remember the mindset.  <br/>
It doesn&#39;t help much to talk to a sober person about how bad the alcoholism <br/>
is. Their whole being, including memory, is compartmentalized. Sometimes it <br/>
helps more to scare them in the alcoholic state.  It&#39;s more conditioning than <br/>
reason.  My mom&#39;s alcoholic self had a whole different set of principles and <br/>
awarenesses than her sober self.   The two halves of her didn&#39;t communicate much <br/>
at all.<br/>
<br/>
If the enraged neighbor remembered I was a danger to him, and that others <br/>
might have the courage to look him in the eye and say stop, it might not totally <br/>
change him, but it will slow him down.<br/>
<br/>
If the police are the threat, that&#39;s like teachers on the playground.  If <br/>
they&#39;re not watching, if the police aren&#39;t there, you can do what you want.   But <br/>
when I did call the police on another situation once, it took nearly ten <br/>
minutes for them to get there, and the guy had left.  It only took me thirty <br/>
seconds to get over there myself.<br/>

I have been thinking further about this, and it occurs to me that there is a<br/>
particular reason that I consider what Sandra did to be extraordinarily<br/>
brave. I would absolutely be too afraid to confront a loudly violent<br/>
neighbor directly. <br/>
<br/>
I live in Los Angeles, mecca of gangs. It is more than merely possible that<br/>
the violent neighbor might have a gun and/or be a gang member. It is<br/>
actually pretty likely. Too likely to risk for me. <br/>
==========================<br/>
<br/>
When I spoke softly to my behind-my-house neighbor ( in the vacant lot of his <br/>
side yard, our back yard==and then it turned to yelling) last year, I was <br/>
afraid, but not shaky-afraid.  I was apprehensive that he might do something <br/>
later.   <br/>
<br/>
It does help that I have a big scary husband.  I never have sicced him on <br/>
anyone, but in terms of bullying males, if they see a bigger male with a brave <br/>
wife, it&#39;s a deterrent.  But my husband wasn&#39;t home.   The guy didn&#39;t know that. <br/>
 But I was tired of hearing him and the mom yell at those kids all the time <br/>
for nothing, and hateful things.  Their kids were bullying Holly verbally.   So <br/>
I was doing something for Holly, indirectly.<br/>
<br/>
Twice afterwards that I know of, the police were looking for that guy.  Once <br/>
they had the police helicopter over the neighborhood.  They didn&#39;t find him <br/>
either time.  But there&#39;s been no yelling, no young boys, for many months, so <br/>
something happened. There&#39;s a girl there with a baby sometimes.  Late teens, <br/>
early 20&#39;s.  I did feel bad for the kids.<br/>
<br/>
If I thought he had a gun while he was out trying to fly a kite with his kids <br/>
(and calling them idiot and stupid because the kite wasn&#39;t going up), I <br/>
might&#39;ve acted differently.  <br/>
<br/>
But there can be another downside to reporting something.  My friend Cathyn <br/>
and I were in a Village Inn on Central/66 one night and a very drunk couple <br/>
were the only  others in the big section, and he hit her (not very effectively, <br/>
they were SO drunk) and I saw it, and the two of us bailed out of our booth and <br/>
Cathyn saw him drag her out of the booth and gently got him away from  her.  <br/>
<br/>
The manager called the police.   He should&#39;ve done something sooner. They had <br/>
already decided to ignore the couple, but they hadn&#39;t asked them to leave.  <br/>
So they were totally disturbing OUR visit.    <br/>
<br/>
I advised the couple to go on home (they lived walking distance) but they <br/>
said no, they were going to eat.  The restaurant people said they weren&#39;t going <br/>
to serve them.  I said if the police came they would have to deal with that, <br/>
but they should go home and sleep it off.<br/>
<br/>
The guy was scrawny and weak.  The woman was not even going to remember, she <br/>
was so drunk.  But they stayed.  The police took him in.<br/>
<br/>
Cathyn and I were subpoenaed to court as witnesses.  He had to miss half a <br/>
day of work.  I had to arrange for the kids (not too bad, as Holly was eight or <br/>
nine by then).   The guy didn&#39;t show up, so they issued an arrest warrant and <br/>
we were subpoenaed again.  Cathyn had to miss another half day of work.  <br/>
Because I could identify the guy in the courtroom before court started, they let us <br/>
go home without testifying.<br/>
<br/>
My cost was time, inconvenience and paying to park downtown.   I&#39;m just glad <br/>
I didn&#39;t live far out of town, or have to take off from work myself.<br/>
<br/>
-=-However the signs, such as graffiti, are increasing, and the<br/>
heart of it is within just a few miles. No shoes on the power lines yet, at<br/>
least.-=-<br/>
<br/>
What are shoes on the power lines meaning where you are?<br/>
<br/>
Here it just means school bullies snatched shoes from smaller kids and threw <br/>
them where they couldn&#39;t get them.<br/>

I know in some areas, shoes from the utility line indicates a place to buy <br/>
