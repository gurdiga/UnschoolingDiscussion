<div id="ygrps-yiv-725034508">Wow!<br/>
I was very surprised to check my e-mail and find this rather<br/>
fiery discussion going on. I received that same e-mail<br/>
message on my private e-mail today also. I guess I just <br/>
want to ackowledge that I am a Christian unschooler(a bit<br/>
of an anomaly in my neck of the woods) and I have benefited<br/>
so much form the richness on this list. I realized early on<br/>
that my religious beliefs, although completely integral to<br/>
my daily life, were not necessarily shared by all the folks<br/>
on the list, nor did I expect them to be. Still, my educational<br/>
philosophies and passions for my children to grow and learn<br/>
in natural ways were echoed daily in the posts of the<br/>
unschooling parents. This is a huge encouragement to me.<br/>
I feel very &quot;other&quot; in my homeschooling community. In the<br/>
strongly Christian groups, the policy is &quot;school-at-home&quot;<br/>
so I don&#39;t fit perfectly there. In the diverse, freedom<br/>
oriented groups, my faith might be one of many, so I dont <br/>
totally fit in there. SO WHAT? If my goal is to only hang<br/>
with those who are exactly like me in every possible way, <br/>
what am I teaching my children? That the ultimate goal is<br/>
to find friends that are exactly like you, so you can be<br/>
comfortable at all times? ACK!! I am unapologetic about <br/>
my Christian faith, but I consider it completely in keeping<br/>
with that faith to be completely respectful of other people&#39;s<br/>
differing faiths and beliefs. I guess this hit a nerve for<br/>
me, huh? I&#39;ve been pretty quiet, soaking up the good stuff.<br/>
I would hate to lose it, I suppose.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-569509156"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Supposed to have a lot of snow.  We are in the winter storm advisory<br/>
 </span></blockquote>area.  Yippee!!  As long as I don&#39;t have to drive, I don&#39;t care.  Just want<br/>
spring to get here soon, so the kids and I can play outdoors more.  How much<br/>
snow do you have?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Hey Stephanie and Gayle,<br/>
<br/>
I am in Eastpointe, and have family in Marysville and Midland.  Perhaps<br/>
during one of the weekends with the inlaws we could meet somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of snow....it is piling down here.  My hubby works for the City Of<br/>
Troy Streets Dept, I doubt we will see him until monday, then he will be<br/>
exhausted, and won&#39;t be fit to live with until wednesday.  He will be<br/>
salting and plowing.  Poor guy, sometimes after he is in the truck 16hrs, he<br/>
comes home and still hears the salt spreader in his head.  Not complaining<br/>
tho, it is the snow and his overtime that makes it possible for me not to<br/>
work - and I say.....bring it on!!<br/>
<br/>
Hope all drive safely,<br/>

What a great idea (still same heading too! LOL) I am in Your area quite<br/>
often... Swap children at the Detroit Zoo. That looks like I am swapping<br/>
children with the zoo, huh? That is where I meet with a friend to pick<br/>
up/drop off. Did you know I head a Michigan list, and that we do things<br/>
together? We have been quiet for a while, but with the time of year, well I<br/>
am sure you know... Wow, I am in Marysville all the time! It is a Small<br/>
world! I can feel for your husband, I only shovel the sidewalk and can hear<br/>
the noise all afternoon! Let me know how much snow you have, we have about 4<br/>
and it is still coming!<br/>
