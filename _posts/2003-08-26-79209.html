<div id="ygrps-yiv-243612987">Hello,<br/>
I am new to &quot;Homeschooling&quot; and &quot;Unschooling&quot; but look forward to <br/>
learning as much as possible. The current system in which I am <br/>
employed in is broken to say the least. I would NEVER consider <br/>
subjecting my children to the abuses of public schools. I am <br/>
convinced that the &quot;top dogs&quot; are the ones that have hurt the already <br/>
unstable system. Most teachers really do care about whats best for <br/>
the students BUT they have been spoon fed half truths all their life. <br/>
Unschooling is the ONLY way that I would raise a child. <br/>
I work in special education and now realize that unschooling would <br/>
help in great lengths to ANY special ed student. I would like to ask <br/>
any and all of you to contact me through here or my personal email <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mattbau43@...">mattbau43@...</a>). I would like to learn in the next year how <br/>
one can become a unschooler director?. I would LOVE to, and feel the <br/>
need to, educate the ones that fall through the cracks of the public <br/>
school system. I am a dedicated educator and the wool is NOT pulled <br/>
over my eyes. The public school system is broken. I would like to fix <br/>
education for the few students who could seriously benefit.<br/>
Thank you for listening to my ranting. I hope to hear from all of you <br/>
soon.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome Matt..I took my children out of a charter school last <br/>
December, my oldest daughter was in the 7th grade, I had a 5th and <br/>
2nd grader also.    I believe you really hit the nail on the head in <br/>
describing ps.  And, I also believe that most teachers are just like <br/>
you.  We had a couple of loonies.. lol. but most of them were caring, <br/>
loving, nurturing individuals who just had thier hands tied and had <br/>
to answer to a &quot;higer power&quot;    I am so glad that you have seen the <br/>
light and you are exploring unschooling.  You are certainly correct <br/>
that unschooling is a tremendous benefit to &quot;special ed&quot; kids.  The <br/>
great thing is, in unschooling, ALL kids are special, and special is <br/>
not a derogatory term.   Happy unschooling!<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible to be an unschooling &quot;director&quot; as I believe <br/>
most unschooling is child directed...doing what interests the child.  But I know <br/>
that in many states, it&#39;s much easier on parents and families if they can be <br/>
part of an &quot;umbrella school&quot;....a group &quot;run&quot; by a licensed educator, that <br/>
keeps records for the families, maybe helps with portfolio evaluations to satisfy <br/>
the legal requirements in some states.  Someone that newbies can ask for <br/>
help??  <br/>
<br/>
We live in a state that requires a portfolio evaluation or testing.  As far <br/>
as I know, there are no &quot;umbrella&quot; schools for unschoolers, or for <br/>
homeschoolers for that matter, in our state.  I know many parents who would LOVE to be <br/>
able to sign up each year under such a &quot;school&quot; and be able to kiss the public <br/>
school system (and evaluations) goodbye.  We were under such a school in CA and <br/>
NEVER had to deal with the state because we were part of a PRIVATE SCHOOL!  <br/>
The lady who ran it was wonderful...was able to issue high school diplomas too.  <br/>
She took a huge load off of our shoulders, planned field trips (which were <br/>
optional), did all the paperwork,...she earned her money big time.  We all paid <br/>
her 300 per year (per family) which we were able to pay quarterly.  Since <br/>
there were about 50 families in the group, she obviously didn&#39;t get rich (her <br/>
husband worked also) and I know she spent a lot of money on stuff for the families <br/>
(she threw a mother&#39;s day tea one year that was soooo sweet.)  The best thing <br/>
about the group was that it was very informal, almost no requirements, you <br/>
could homeschool in any style,  and we met frequently (which my children now <br/>
miss.)<br/>
<br/>
I have a son I just started unschooling this year who is classified as a <br/>
special ed child.  i KNOW it will be the best thing for him.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re here to help parents unschool their own kids. Perhaps you&#39;ll be able<br/>
to take what we say and translate that into an unschoolish school. But we<br/>
can&#39;t help you with that because the needs of a school often conflict with<br/>
what&#39;s needed for unschooling to work. One of the biggest roadblocks to<br/>
unschooling will be the children&#39;s lack of choice of whether to be there or<br/>
not. If there is no freedom of choice then unschooling can&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
The best place to start is John Holt. I assume as an educator you&#39;ve read<br/>
some? Here they are in the order he wrote them.<br/>
<br/>
1964 - How Children Fail, by John Holt (Pitman Publishing)<br/>
<br/>
1967 - How Children Learn, by John Holt (Dell)<br/>
<br/>
1969 - The Underachieving School, by John Holt (Dell)<br/>
<br/>
1970 - What Do I Do Monday?, by John Holt (Dell)<br/>
<br/>
1974 - Escape from Childhood, by John Holt (Dell)<br/>
<br/>
1976 - Instead of Education, by John Holt (E.P. Dutton)<br/>
<br/>
1981 - Teach Your Own, by John Holt (Delacorte Press) (This was just<br/>
reprinted by F.U.N. Books. The new edition is probably available through<br/>
bookstores but definintely through their website http://www.unschooling.org)<br/>
<br/>
1989 - Learning All the Time, by John Holt (Addison-Wesley)<br/>
<br/>
1990 - A Life Worth Living: The Selected Letters of John Holt, edited<br/>
by Susannah Sheffer (Ohio State Univ. Press)<br/>
<br/>
1997 - Growing Without Schooling: A Record of a Grassroots Movement<br/>
(Holt/GWS)<br/>
<br/>
Holt began with the intent of school reform but over the years he discovered<br/>
why that wouldn&#39;t work and turned to homeschooling (which he called<br/>
unschooling) and finally unschooling (as the word is used today.)<br/>
<br/>
The next place would be investigating Sudbury Valley schools. Go to<br/>
http://www.sudburyvalley.org The original one is in Framingham, MA but<br/>
others have sprung up around the country based on their model.<br/>
<br/>
There are some books, publications and videos listed at:<br/>
http://www.sudburyvalley.org/books.html to help people start up Sudbury<br/>
Valley model schools. There&#39;s also a list at the website of other Sudbury<br/>
Valley model schools that you might be able to visit if you don&#39;t live close<br/>
to the original. (Not all of them are as unschoolish as the original,<br/>
though.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I work in special education and now realize that unschooling would<br/>
&gt; help in great lengths to ANY special ed student.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a great folder, Unschooling and Special Needs, on the message boards<br/>
at Unschooling.com (http://www.unschooling.com) for parents of special<br/>
needs. It might be worth a peek at to see what the concerns are and how<br/>
unschoolers approach them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Most teachers really do care about whats best for<br/>
&gt; the students BUT they have been spoon fed half truths all their life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But I don&#39;t know that the ones feeding them the half truths realize it<br/>
either. Anyone who is convinced that school is the best place for children<br/>
to learn what they need is going to believe that whatever is best for<br/>
schools is best for children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-771278669">Another place would be Clonlara.  They work with families that <br/>
choose to unschool.  I&#39;m sure they keep their eyes open for good <br/>

<h4>Nora or Devereaux Cannon</h4>
<time>27 Aug 2003, at  6:59pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056626142">We did a treasure hunt for a 4 year old&#39;s party - one thing I am<br/>
glad we did was put pictures on the clues.  No matter how well<br/>
one child reads, others don&#39;t - and even more to the point few<br/>
of them do when excited.<br/>
<br/>
We drew a VERY rough sketch of the identifying feature over the<br/>
word label and made copies for each child.  At each stop along<br/>
the way there was a copy of the clue for each kid - and they<br/>
compared their thoughts about what the words were as well as the<br/>
picture of the next stop.  A couple of the clues were<br/>
accidentally too tough, but in the general conversation it was<br/>
easy for an adult to help focus on possibilities in the yard.<br/>
It also helped that the clues for the next stop were attached to<br/>
the stop with a pretty bright bit of gold ribbon, so the kids<br/>
weren&#39;t beating all the way around the apple tree to find the<br/>
next batch of clues.<br/>
<br/>
Our treasure was a bag for each child of 10 coins from the &quot;bad<br/>
condition&quot; bin at a coin dealers and 1o jewels from the polished<br/>
rock barrel at a museum - it was the perfect treasure for 4s, if<br/>
you haven&#39;t already decided what to bury. - and do bury it if<br/>
you can, a shovel is a great arm of the X that marks the spot.<br/>
Now, 3 years later, some of the kids who came to the most recent<br/>
birthday party took  newer friends around to see where they had<br/>
dug up buried treasure and to talk about each stop.<br/>

| Okay, this is wayyyy OT but I&#39;m stuck and need a little help.<br/>
|<br/>
| Jaiden is haveing a huge pirate b-day party this weekend, and<br/>
we are having<br/>
| a treasure hunt.<br/>
|<br/>
| He&#39;s turning 5 and most of the kiddos that will be there are<br/>
around the same<br/>
| age. We have turned my moms backyard into a island, and have<br/>
set up &#39;areas&#39;<br/>
| that will be named something(this is where I need the help) in<br/>
pirate lingo,<br/>
| with the name put on a sign so that they can find there way<br/>
through the<br/>
| treasure hunt.<br/>
|<br/>
| I&#39;m completly suck, total block, where it comes to nameing<br/>
these things.<br/>
| Help please, I don&#39;t have to many creative bones, and this has<br/>
been driving<br/>
| me nuts, my family and friends have been helping us pull this<br/>
off and they<br/>
| seem to be stuck too, that or they all enjoy watching me wrack<br/>
my brain<br/>
| trying to figure it out ;^P<br/>
|<br/>
| So, if anyone has any ideas, this is what I have:<br/>
|<br/>
| a wading pool<br/>
| a pond<br/>
| a bar<br/>
| tents<br/>
| tunnels<br/>
|<br/>
| I hope this made sense, Jason started working this week and<br/>
I&#39;m not used to<br/>
| being up before dawn and my brain isn&#39;t working yet :-)<br/>
|<br/>
| Thanx<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-314709910">Not boring at all - one of the great joys of unschooling a kid<br/>
is the time to go stuff like really get involved in parties and<br/>
the joy of hospitality.  If I weren&#39;t so far behind, I would<br/>
probably launch into an explanation of the joys of an<br/>
unschooler&#39;s Barbie slumber party for 10 7 y.o&#39;s - which we had<br/>
over the weekend.  I defy any curriculum to be as effective or<br/>
precise as a 7 with a mission, a budget, and the time to price<br/>
compare at a half a dozen well known bargain sources.<br/>

coins in there!<br/>
<br/>
What fun!<br/>

We had a treasure chest ON a cake.  We made an island/hill of chocolate cake <br/>
baked in a small mixing bowl, and frosted it green.   The flat part of the <br/>
cake (made in a roasting pan, so it was home-made sheet cake, but with rounder <br/>
corners) was white cake with green food coloring, frosted blue for the ocean.   <br/>
The treasure chest was made of graham crackers, and half-filled with the gold <br/>
sprinkles (sugarballs) they say not to eat.  And smaller sprinkles too, for <br/>
jewels.  One section of Graham cracker for the top.  Lego palm trees on the <br/>
island.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558903398">Hi! I&#39;m returning to this list, I think. LOL! I&#39;ve been on too many lists. I may have posted a few times a while back but mainly lurked. After 2 days back on I see this is an active list! Which I like. <br/>
<br/>
  I have two sons. They are 14 and soon to be 12. My husband and I do remodeling and are puppeteers. We&#39;ve been unschooling for the past 7 years. <br/>
<br/>
  I lead a support group that is part of www.kclearn.org in Kansas City. We are called the Free Range Learners. We have 48 families - all unschooling in various degrees. <br/>
<br/>
  I just wanted to say a quick hi and to let you know I&#39;m enjoying it here so far. <br/>
  :) Jane <br/>

Tell us about your puppeteering, will you?<br/>
