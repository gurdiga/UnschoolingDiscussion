<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940130434">While doing the search on snowfalkes I found this<br/>
project using borax and thought someone might think it<br/>
was fun.<br/>
<br/>
Borax Crystal Snowflake<br/>
Grow a snowflake in a jar!<br/>
  You will need: <br/>
* string<br/>
* wide mouth pint jar<br/>
* white pipe cleaners<br/>
* blue food coloring (optional)<br/>
* boiling water (with adult help)<br/>
* borax (available at grocery stores in the laundry<br/>
soap section,<br/>
  as 20 Mule Team Borax Laundry Booster - NOT Boraxo<br/>
soap)<br/>
* pencil <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Directions: <br/>
With a little kitchen science you can create long<br/>
lasting snowflakes as sparkly as the real ones. Cut a<br/>
white pipe cleaner into 3 equal sections. Twist the<br/>
sections together in the center so that you have a<br/>
&quot;six-sided&quot; star shape.  <br/>
Pipe cleaners and string form a snowflake base for the<br/>
crystals to grow on.  <br/>
If your points are not even, trim the pipe-cleaner<br/>
sections to the same length. Now attach string along<br/>
the outer edges to form a snowflake pattern. Attach a<br/>
piece of string to the top of one of the pipe cleaners<br/>
and tie the other end to a pencil (this is to hang it<br/>
from). Fill a widemouth jar with boiling water. Mix<br/>
borax into the water one tablespoon at a time. Use 3<br/>
tablespoons of borax per cup of water. Stir until<br/>
dissolved, (don&#39;t worry if there is powder settling on<br/>
the bottom of the jar). If you want you can add a<br/>
little blue food coloring now to give the snowflake a<br/>
bluish hue. Insert your pipe cleaner snowflake into<br/>
the jar so that the pencil is resting on the lip of<br/>
the jar and the snowflake is freely suspended in the<br/>
borax solution. Wait overnight and by morning the<br/>
snowflake will be covered with shiny crystals. Hang in<br/>
a window as a sun-catcher or use as a winter time<br/>
decoration. <br/>
<br/>
Have Fun!<br/>
