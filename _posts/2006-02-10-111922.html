<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011826117">&quot;I don&#39;t speak in front<br/>
of, or TO my children any differently than I do another human...THAT<br/>
would be baby talk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I should clarify that. I DO find myself wanting to use a slightly<br/>
higher pitch with wee babsies....and of course we sing silly songs and<br/>
such.But I don&#39;t pay attention to using only certain words, or<br/>
simplifying my sentences. I just talk to them.<br/>
I told them things I might not tell an adult, like &quot;ok, I&#39;m going to<br/>
the bathroom now, then we&#39;re going to get into the van&quot; blah, blah, blah.<br/>
<br/>
I talked to them and explained things as we went about our day. I<br/>
didn&#39;t  assume they could or couldn&#39;t understand. I just explained<br/>
anyway. I don&#39;t use a different voice with little people, but I did<br/>
find myself talking to my babies in a higher pitch occasionally like<br/>
Robyn.<br/>
NOT that sweet, syrupy voice I find SO appalling. Major yuck.<br/>
<br/>
I had people talk to my kids that way and it really bothered them.<br/>
