<div id="ygrps-yiv-332765726">Hi Betsy, Samantha, Ashley and anyone else that&#39;s into permaculture / serious<br/>
gardening etc.<br/>
<br/>
As a relative newcomer to such things - we moved to our land last March, are<br/>
living in a garage while we build our house, and so this summer (your winter,<br/>
I&#39;m in New Zealand) is my first time at serious gardening. We are also aiming<br/>
towards a permaculture type of environment for our small block of land.<br/>
<br/>
Today, because it was raining,  I spent some time trying to work out what and<br/>
how many activities we could manage, money- and time-wise this year (our school<br/>
year goes from February to December, and so, of course, do many of the kids&#39;<br/>
activities such as music lessons, gym etc.)<br/>
<br/>
The rain stopped, so I raced out to the garden to do some weeding,  plant out<br/>
some more seedlings, and sow some more seeds. Then, having ignored me all day,<br/>
suddenly people needed me :-(  This is not the first time.<br/>
<br/>
So, if unschooling is about allowing kids to learn what, when and how they want,<br/>
and our job is that of a facilitator, how do you all cope with the needs of the<br/>
garden to be dealt with at the right time - I can&#39;t control the weather - and<br/>
the kids needs? At the moment I feel like sending them to the great baby sitting<br/>
service next year so I can get on with developing our land. I am feeling very<br/>
frustrated. I have tried to get them involved, and 2 out of 3 showed a little<br/>
interest, which has since waned.<br/>
<br/>
I have other interests - book making and writing - that I can fit around the<br/>
kids, but it seems this growing business is less amenable to &#39;fitting&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
So, how do you all deal with this? Help!!!! Any suggestions? Or sympathy even<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Read Nicki and David Colfaxes book about their<br/>
homesteading experience. They couldn&#39;t have done it if<br/>
the kids didn&#39;t help in some way.  So depending on how<br/>
old your kids are (mine are still quite young) find<br/>
out what they would like to do to help.  Some things<br/>
that come to mind for me is:  read about<br/>
permaculture/natural gardening as a family, ask the<br/>
kids for help, make a list of the things to do in a<br/>
garden then everyone helps do what they would most<br/>
enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Look for permaculture groups  in your area or start<br/>
one and let them come over to your place and get lots<br/>
of hands on experience.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>
Samantha<br/>
