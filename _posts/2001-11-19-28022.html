cute I had to write back.<br/>
I love this &quot;table the subject&quot; idea. I&#39;m at the point now<br/>
where when people ask me <br/>
why I homeschool  I usually just say Cuz I went to<br/>
conventional schools and I remember.<br/>
But family.  Wow. Boy do they have a way of really getting<br/>
under your skin. When  the <br/>
inlaws say something like How can you do this to her or<br/>
whatever I just shrug and say<br/>
Homeschooling works for us and smile.  But then I seethe<br/>
for the rest of the day.<br/>
I like your way better. :)<br/>
