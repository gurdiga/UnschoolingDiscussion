for saying I would feel defrauded by someone who tried to sell me <br/>
something for their &quot;school fundraiser&quot; when it was really for their <br/>
&quot;home school&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
These folks were talking about using their home school&#39;s name (which in <br/>
some states is a real thing) and not telling anyone that the money was <br/>
going directly into the family budget.  <br/>
<br/>
I think they were out of line, and should be more up-front about where <br/>
the money was going.  We have lemonade stands and sell bird houses, <br/>
etc., but we never made any bones about what it was going to be used for <br/>
(drum sets, bicycles, etc.).  I was shocked that I was the lone minority <br/>
opinion on a board populated by people who claimed to be &quot;homeschooling <br/>
for religious reasons&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
Yes I like the craft kit idea too. They have bead kits with beads and cord. <br/>
They also have God&#39;s Eye kits. Those include 2 popsicle sticks, yarn and <br/>
directions I printed off the internet. So easy and yet maybe it&#39;ll inspire <br/>
some other kid who buys it to get creative.<br/>

Kate says:<br/>
I actually don&#39;t tell the kids it&#39;s dangerous, that&#39;s just how I feel<br/>
about it.  I wouldn&#39;t let my children do it, other parents can, it&#39;s<br/>
their choice.<br/>
I disagree with buying the stuff because I don&#39;t like that, even with<br/>
all the money the schools get from our taxes, they send the kids out to<br/>
raise more.  It&#39;s the sending of the kids out I don&#39;t like.  They can&#39;t<br/>
hold a fundraising event, run by adults, once or twice a year?  They<br/>
need to put this on the backs of the children (and their parents who<br/>
seem to end up doing quite a bit of the selling)?<br/>
That&#39;s my beef.<br/>
This came up because I was trying to explain to my 8 year old why we<br/>
aren&#39;t buying the stuff from our neighbor.  I&#39;m pretty sure he got it.<br/>
