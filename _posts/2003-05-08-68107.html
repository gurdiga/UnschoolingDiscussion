Laura, I&#39;m writing without reading any other responses.  I see you have four <br/>
others.  I hope I duplicate what someone has already said.<br/>
<br/>
I want to remind you of some things you already know, in way of mental and <br/>
emotional massage.<br/>
<br/>
Step away from the school.  How big must a giant whale seem from the <br/>
INSIDE!!!  360 degrees?  No, every direction, up down, squeezing in.  I can&#39;t <br/>
see a school from my house.  If I stand on TOP of my house I can&#39;t see a <br/>
school.  You went and climbed inside one.  Even from the parking lot, a <br/>
school is really big.  And you&#39;re looking back on 12 or 13 years of it, so it <br/>
seems OLD and ancient and 3/4 of your daughter&#39;s life.  Breathe, turn your <br/>
back, and look how much MORE of her life will be lived away and apart from <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
Early yesterday morning I was going through some boxes of my old stuff to <br/>
consolidate and put away deeper.  Old letters from friends, college and high <br/>
school stuff.  I found a 45 rpm record, still in its mailer, which Matthew <br/>
Chacon made, and sent me.  He was the older brother of one of my boyfriends.  <br/>
He was in the same rock&#39;n&#39;roll band as another boyfriend.  He was the oldest <br/>
of five children of a state representative and the most prominent lawyer in <br/>
town.  Matthew was the student body president.  Matthew made a speech at <br/>
graduation (not valedictorian, but president-thing).  Matthew was seen as <br/>
having huge potential.    He became a lawyer.  He married someone smart, and <br/>
pretty.<br/>
<br/>
Matthew&#39;s dead.  But first, he ruined one marriage, everyone was on HER side, <br/>
and he married someone else, and everyone was on HER side, and he used too <br/>
many drugs, and he got involved in unscrupulous legal practices, and none of <br/>
our other friends who became lawyers could say &quot;Matthew Chacon&quot; without <br/>
shaking their heads in embarrassment.<br/>
<br/>
I liked him, but my sister reminds me it was because I hadn&#39;t seen him for <br/>
several years.<br/>
<br/>
So Matthew made a RECORD!  A song he wrote and recorded.  I still have a <br/>
copy.  I&#39;d give it to one of his kids, but he didn&#39;t have any.<br/>
<br/>
Was Matthew a success in life?<br/>
<br/>
Not hardly.<br/>
<br/>
Todd Petty was a total dweeb in school.  He did model rockets in the back <br/>
field, he licked his lip and was awkward and never comfortable and had a dumb <br/>
name (Tom Petty did okay, but &quot;Todd Petty&quot; didn&#39;t impress us.)  BUT, I never <br/>
saw poor Todd lose his temper in the face of lesser beings taunting him and <br/>
telling him he was an electronics-loving dork.   I never saw him say a mean <br/>
word to anyone, nor did I ever see him cry or get emotional.  He was a calm, <br/>
thoughtful, Spartan geek. When I asked, friends said he had become a military <br/>
officer (air force or navy, I forget) and was an electronics specialist, had <br/>
grown up strong and buff and ended up making over $80,000 a year before he <br/>
was 30 or so.<br/>
<br/>
I was popular in school.  I got lots of awards in Jr. High.  I got fewer in <br/>
high school because I was blackballed by one teacher or more (but it only <br/>
took one) from honor society for smoking dope (I heard from one of the <br/>
teachers who liked me).  I graduated early and graduated from college at 20.  <br/>
  Now, from the point of view of success-counting, I&#39;m nothing.  My kids are <br/>
still relatively little while others I went to school with have grown kids <br/>
with cool careers they can take credit for (fair or not, they do).  I don&#39;t <br/>
have a job.  With all my potential I never even finished a master&#39;s degree, <br/>
dropped out three times.  So I&#39;m an unemployed dropout without ANY cool job <br/>
to show, and I got fat.  And I live in Albuquerque (a kind of shame all in <br/>
itself, in New Mexico &lt;bwg&gt;).  I wear jeans and I apparently can&#39;t afford to <br/>
go to a beauty parlor to have my hair done.  (I went to a class reunion year <br/>
before last, and scoped the really nice clothes and hairdos on people who <br/>
were non-descript kids in school, while I was all sparkly and <br/>
attention-getting.  I went wearing a sweatshirt and jeans, and was one of the <br/>
nominations for the person most changed.  Maybe I won.  I don&#39;t remember.  <br/>
Probably not.  <br/>
<br/>
And is it all over now?  <br/>
<br/>
No.  There will be other comparisons later on.  Maybe I&#39;ll be a published <br/>
author with kids who did something impressive next time there&#39;s a reunion, <br/>
and some of those who were at the top of the wheel of fortune will be <br/>
bankrupt or have suffered strokes or wrecked their nice cars.  <br/>
<br/>
Things aren&#39;t stable.  The moment of high school graduation is a significant <br/>
moment for someone who has been promised that release for their whole <br/>
remembered lives.  But in retrospect it&#39;s just a moment. The next moment is <br/>
more real.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get attached to how she is now.  Don&#39;t get attached to how she is on <br/>
August 3 of this year.  She might sleep all day and have the flu, and watch a <br/>
movie you think is stupid.  Don&#39;t get attached to how she is on her wedding <br/>
day.  Don&#39;t get attached to the vision of her on the day you see her the most <br/>
happy she has ever been.<br/>
<br/>
None of those moments is permanent and they are all just a passing glimpse of <br/>
who she is.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of those poor kids who got awards are just moving in to the phase where <br/>
they will be pressured to do more of the same, get college awards, become <br/>
professional basketball players (or whatever), coach winning teams.  What?  <br/>
You didn&#39;t?  You failure.  You wasted your potential.<br/>
<br/>
Some high school success is just the future-failure switch being screwed in <br/>
place for life.<br/>

it last night, and it overwhelmed me.  I DO know that she is so much more <br/>
than whatever momentary achievements she might have gained in high school.  <br/>
And you&#39;re right when you say  this, too:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; None of those moments is permanent and they are all just a passing glimpse <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; who she is.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The fact is, I don&#39;t beleive in the values imparted by that system.  It&#39;s <br/>
humbling to realize that, despite my commitment to unschooling values, I can <br/>
still get sucked into judging success based on those warped standards.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s even more humbling is the realization that what I experienced last <br/>
night was really more about me than it was about her.  I was jealous of those <br/>
parents whose kids took home all the honors.<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling way of looking at things -- that it&#39;s all about being present <br/>
to your child exactly where they&#39;re at at any given moment, and not where you <br/>
imagine they *should* be -- is an amazing paradigm shift for me.  Part of <br/>
what I think I experienced last night was a letting go of those expectations <br/>
for my son -- since we&#39;re committed to the unschooling path for him.  And <br/>
there was some grief there, even if it isn&#39;t rational.    What I hadn&#39;t <br/>
realized, though, was that there are aspects of the schooled way of looking <br/>
at life that I was still having a terribly hard time letting go of.<br/>
<br/>
It was uncomfortable, but good for me, I think -- both in terms of the way I <br/>
continue to support my dd in the future and in the unschooling of my ds.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your sharing.<br/>

Not so... you do have a cool job, probably the coolest!  Just look what your<br/>
doing for us and our kids as well as your own.  The difference between you<br/>

He was in the same rock&#39;n&#39;roll band as another boyfriend. He was the oldest <br/>
of five children of a state representative and the most prominent lawyer in <br/>

saw poor Todd lose his temper in the face of lesser beings taunting him and <br/>
telling him he was an electronics-loving dork. I never saw him say a mean <br/>
word to anyone, nor did I ever see him cry or get emotional. He was a calm, <br/>
thoughtful, Spartan geek. When I asked, friends said he had become a<br/>
military <br/>
officer (air force or navy, I forget) and was an electronics specialist, had<br/>
<br/>
grown up strong and buff and ended up making over $80,000 a year before he <br/>
was 30 or so.<br/>
 <br/>
I was popular in school. I got lots of awards in Jr. High. I got fewer in <br/>
high school because I was blackballed by one teacher or more (but it only <br/>
took one) from honor society for smoking dope (I heard from one of the <br/>
teachers who liked me). I graduated early and graduated from college at 20. <br/>
Now, from the point of view of success-counting, I&#39;m nothing. My kids are <br/>
still relatively little while others I went to school with have grown kids <br/>
with cool careers they can take credit for (fair or not, they do). I don&#39;t <br/>
have a job. With all my potential I never even finished a master&#39;s degree, <br/>
dropped out three times. So I&#39;m an unemployed dropout without ANY cool job <br/>
to show, and I got fat. And I live in Albuquerque (a kind of shame all in <br/>
itself, in New Mexico &lt;bwg&gt;). I wear jeans and I apparently can&#39;t afford to <br/>
go to a beauty parlor to have my hair done. (I went to a class reunion year <br/>
before last, and scoped the really nice clothes and hairdos on people who <br/>
were non-descript kids in school, while I was all sparkly and <br/>
attention-getting. I went wearing a sweatshirt and jeans, and was one of the<br/>
<br/>
nominations for the person most changed. Maybe I won. I don&#39;t remember. <br/>
Probably not. <br/>
 <br/>
And is it all over now? <br/>
 <br/>
No. There will be other comparisons later on. Maybe I&#39;ll be a published <br/>
author with kids who did something impressive next time there&#39;s a reunion, <br/>
and some of those who were at the top of the wheel of fortune will be <br/>
bankrupt or have suffered strokes or wrecked their nice cars. <br/>
 <br/>
Things aren&#39;t stable. The moment of high school graduation is a significant <br/>
moment for someone who has been promised that release for their whole <br/>
remembered lives. But in retrospect it&#39;s just a moment. The next moment is <br/>
more real.<br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t get attached to how she is now. Don&#39;t get attached to how she is on <br/>
August 3 of this year. She might sleep all day and have the flu, and watch a<br/>
<br/>
movie you think is stupid. Don&#39;t get attached to how she is on her wedding <br/>
day. Don&#39;t get attached to the vision of her on the day you see her the most<br/>
<br/>
happy she has ever been.<br/>
 <br/>
None of those moments is permanent and they are all just a passing glimpse<br/>
of <br/>
who she is. <br/>
 <br/>
Some of those poor kids who got awards are just moving in to the phase where<br/>
<br/>
they will be pressured to do more of the same, get college awards, become <br/>
professional basketball players (or whatever), coach winning teams. What? <br/>
You didn&#39;t? You failure. You wasted your potential.<br/>
 <br/>
Some high school success is just the future-failure switch being screwed in <br/>
place for life.<br/>

It&#39;s great being on the fringe with you guys. <br/>
I used to cringe when I was called weird {all my life - LOL} trying <br/>
to make up some defense or excuse for my reality. Forget it my <br/>
husband told me, they will never understand. As soon as we start <br/>
talking they pretty much stop listning. {unless they have some switch <br/>
that fllicks on, or some life changing experiance in their own <br/>
reality where they begin to relate} I just embrace being &#39;weird&#39; now. <br/>
It&#39;s a lot easier, and like the ease of unschooling, much more <br/>
satisfying.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488012380">Wow,<br/>
This was an incredible response from Sandra.<br/>
 I sat here and read the entire letter in tears to my husband im still not <br/>
sure why? Thing is I know im not a failure I have just herd it too many <br/>
times. <br/>
<br/>
 I have a little sister that this has happened to. She was Athlete, semi <br/>
popular and pumped to go to college by my Mom. Way too pumped.<br/>
Well, she graduated after being handed anything and everything Mom couldn&#39;t <br/>
wouldn&#39;t give us. <br/>
She got engaged, ended up being kicked out moved in with me. I asked her to <br/>
leave she had thousands but would not even buy her own food. She went back <br/>
home, almost died from alcohol poising, wedding never happened and boom a <br/>
year later same month she is back with me.  <br/>
In a financial mess and her with some 5hour a week (lived her 2 1/2 months <br/>
before she landed a job at Victoria Sec) We told her too look for a new <br/>
place. That night 100 MPH car crash (she wasn&#39;t driving). I being sister/Mom <br/>
again sat at the hospital all night while she is in traction. <br/>
Back to my house looses her job. Leaves here to live with my Aunt in Rhode <br/>
Island and left there on a bad note. Five months later no job and lives in an <br/>
apartment her and her BF can barley afford. <br/>
Now she is getting a free family trip from his parents, a cosign on a loan <br/>
and a car and well it may not get paid....<br/>
I called her tonight and read Sandra&#39;s response she said hey that&#39;s me i said <br/>
know that&#39;s why i called, it does sound like the past two years of your life.&lt;<br/>
sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Being the Top Jock is not worth all the hype in the end.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;I would never, in a gazillion years, breathe a word of this to either of <br/>
&gt; my <br/>
&gt; children, but it&#39;s there like a cancer, inside me.  I wanted a child like <br/>
&gt; that.  I wanted my offspring to be a credit to me.  I wanted the applause <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; her accomplishments...for me!  And I knew, as I sat there, with an awful <br/>
&gt; feeling of despair, that I&#39;ll never get that from either of my children <br/>
&gt; now.  <br/>
&gt; She&#39;s done, and her brother&#39;s at home -- never to even have a shot at that <br/>
&gt; sort of acclaim.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Laura, I&#39;m writing without reading any other responses.  I see you have <br/>
&gt; four <br/>
&gt; others.  I hope I duplicate what someone has already said.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I want to remind you of some things you already know, in way of mental and <br/>
&gt; emotional massage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Step away from the school.  How big must a giant whale seem from the <br/>
&gt; INSIDE!!!  360 degrees?  No, every direction, up down, squeezing in.  I <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t <br/>
&gt; see a school from my house.  If I stand on TOP of my house I can&#39;t see a <br/>
&gt; school.  You went and climbed inside one.  Even from the parking lot, a <br/>
&gt; school is really big.  And you&#39;re looking back on 12 or 13 years of it, so <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; seems OLD and ancient and 3/4 of your daughter&#39;s life.  Breathe, turn your <br/>
&gt; back, and look how much MORE of her life will be lived away and apart from <br/>
&gt; school.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Early yesterday morning I was going through some boxes of my old stuff to <br/>
&gt; consolidate and put away deeper.  Old letters from friends, college and <br/>
&gt; high <br/>
&gt; school stuff.  I found a 45 rpm record, still in its mailer, which Matthew <br/>
&gt; Chacon made, and sent me.  He was the older brother of one of my <br/>
&gt; boyfriends.  <br/>
&gt; He was in the same rock&#39;n&#39;roll band as another boyfriend.  He was the <br/>
&gt; oldest <br/>
&gt; of five children of a state representative and the most prominent lawyer in <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; town.  Matthew was the student body president.  Matthew made a speech at <br/>
&gt; graduation (not valedictorian, but president-thing).  Matthew was seen as <br/>
&gt; having huge potential.   He became a lawyer.  He married someone smart, and <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; pretty.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Matthew&#39;s dead.  But first, he ruined one marriage, everyone was on HER <br/>
&gt; side, <br/>
&gt; and he married someone else, and everyone was on HER side, and he used too <br/>
&gt; many drugs, and he got involved in unscrupulous legal practices, and none <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; our other friends who became lawyers could say &quot;Matthew Chacon&quot; without <br/>
&gt; shaking their heads in embarrassment.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I liked him, but my sister reminds me it was because I hadn&#39;t seen him for <br/>
&gt; several years.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So Matthew made a RECORD!  A song he wrote and recorded.  I still have a <br/>
&gt; copy.  I&#39;d give it to one of his kids, but he didn&#39;t have any.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Was Matthew a success in life?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not hardly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Todd Petty was a total dweeb in school.  He did model rockets in the back <br/>
&gt; field, he licked his lip and was awkward and never comfortable and had a <br/>
&gt; dumb <br/>
&gt; name (Tom Petty did okay, but &quot;Todd Petty&quot; didn&#39;t impress us.)  BUT, I <br/>
&gt; never <br/>
&gt; saw poor Todd lose his temper in the face of lesser beings taunting him and <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; telling him he was an electronics-loving dork.   I never saw him say a mean <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; word to anyone, nor did I ever see him cry or get emotional.  He was a <br/>
&gt; calm, <br/>
&gt; thoughtful, Spartan geek. When I asked, friends said he had become a <br/>
&gt; military <br/>
&gt; officer (air force or navy, I forget) and was an electronics specialist, <br/>
&gt; had <br/>
&gt; grown up strong and buff and ended up making over $80,000 a year before he <br/>
&gt; was 30 or so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was popular in school.  I got lots of awards in Jr. High.  I got fewer in <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; high school because I was blackballed by one teacher or more (but it only <br/>
&gt; took one) from honor society for smoking dope (I heard from one of the <br/>
&gt; teachers who liked me).  I graduated early and graduated from college at <br/>
&gt; 20.  <br/>
&gt;  Now, from the point of view of success-counting, I&#39;m nothing.  My kids are <br/>

&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; to show, and I got fat.  And I live in Albuquerque (a kind of shame all in <br/>
&gt; itself, in New Mexico &lt;bwg&gt;).  I wear jeans and I apparently can&#39;t afford <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; go to a beauty parlor to have my hair done.  (I went to a class reunion <br/>
&gt; year <br/>
&gt; before last, and scoped the really nice clothes and hairdos on people who <br/>
&gt; were non-descript kids in school, while I was all sparkly and <br/>
&gt; attention-getting.  I went wearing a sweatshirt and jeans, and was one of <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; nominations for the person most changed.  Maybe I won.  I don&#39;t remember.  <br/>
&gt; Probably not.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; No.  There will be other comparisons later on.  Maybe I&#39;ll be a published <br/>

&gt; Don&#39;t get attached to how she is now.  Don&#39;t get attached to how she is on <br/>

&gt; None of those moments is permanent and they are all just a passing glimpse <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some of those poor kids who got awards are just moving in to the phase <br/>
&gt; where <br/>
&gt; they will be pressured to do more of the same, get college awards, become <br/>

 </span></blockquote>At my 20th high school reunion (from the church school) they had asked me to <br/>
come and speak to the graduating class (I was Valedictorian 20 years <br/>
previously what could I possibly say?).<br/>
<br/>
I get a big intro, valedictorian, college, nursing degree, masters degree, <br/>
delivered lots of babies...  It was embarrassing and done only for them to <br/>
take pride in how THEIR student turned out.  I was none of those things <br/>
BECAUSE of their school.<br/>
<br/>
So I stood up, asked my children to come up to the stage with me and I <br/>
introduced them and said THESE are the jewels in my crown, not some degree, <br/>
THIS is what I do, I mother these precious children.  I told them nothing <br/>
else really mattered in life if I didn&#39;t get the mothering thing right.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how many children I might help bring into this world, if my own are <br/>
not loved and respected then what&#39;s the point?<br/>
<br/>
Being &quot;just a mother&quot; is a very honorable thing.  Sometimes people don&#39;t <br/>
understand giving up a job that one works years at achieving to &quot;just be a <br/>
mother.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Later while chatting, one of the other graduates was talking about her life <br/>
and all that she had become and said she really never got around to having <br/>
children and it just seemed to time consuming and of course there is always <br/>
the &quot;getting fat&quot; part.<br/>
<br/>
I just looked at her and said &quot;I really feel so sorry for you&quot; and explained <br/>
to her that my children are my greatest joy and I&#39;m so glad that I &quot;found&quot; <br/>
the time to have children.  She went on and on and was fairly demeaning about <br/>
being &quot;just a mom&quot; (she was JUST a secretary who has wrecked at least three <br/>
homes by sleeping with her bosses).<br/>
<br/>
I finally said to her that her life must be so very empty and again told her <br/>
how sorry I was that she didn&#39;t know the joy of being a mother and walked <br/>
away from her.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything more important than being the very best mother you can <br/>
possibly be?  I think not.  Children are very special gifts and deserve to be <br/>
treated like it.  We are touching the future every day and I don&#39;t understand <br/>
why some people in society don&#39;t see the value in this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682903106">I agree it is a job to be a mom, especially striving to be a GREAT <br/>
MOM. That is part of my identity, striving to be the best mom I can. <br/>
BUT {there&#39;s always that but aint there &lt;g&gt;}<br/>
This was just on &quot;another list&quot; about how some people can look down <br/>
upon people because they choose not to procreate. So I had to add in <br/>
that perspective.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s their choice.  {and I&#39;m not beating you down about this} I <br/>
just wanted to say that some people REALLY shouldn&#39;t have kids. Some <br/>
may in the pinch be good parents even if they didn&#39;t want kids, but <br/>
if it really isn&#39;t in their heart to do so, I&#39;d rather say cool, to <br/>
each their own.<br/>
If someone&#39;s identity isn&#39;t having kids and especially if they don&#39;t <br/>

I agree that some people shouldn&#39;t have children. Not just because they<br/>
might make crappy parents but because they just don&#39;t want children. Not<br/>
everyone is able to deal with what it takes to have a family. I certainly<br/>
would never &quot;feel sorry&quot; for someone that didn&#39;t want children. Maybe<br/>
feeling bad for people who want them and can&#39;t, but not people who make that<br/>

uggg, I think I&#39;m on that list too. Unless this subject is going around a bunch right now. I stayed out of the conversation, I did feel like if I spoke up about my kiddos and my love for them I would be shot down, so I kept my mouth shut.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-497275361">This took me a long time to understand.  My first son was an angel, <br/>
the most easy going child I have ever met.  I could NOT understand <br/>
how people did not want kids, espcially since at that time we wanted <br/>
6 kids.  But then I had number two and the work increased and he is <br/>
much fiestier, but also more full of life.  I also saw my sister, who <br/>
was never sure if she wanted kids have a daughter.  Her husband was <br/>
not interested in her and my sister as hard as she tried just does <br/>
not have the passion I have.  It is heart breaking to see her <br/>
daughter because although she is loved, she will always come after my <br/>
sister.  In a way, she is an after thought.  I think if my sister <br/>
could go back and not have her she would, she may never admit it and <br/>
I know she loves her now, but still...<br/>
<br/>
Also, I personally love kids.  However, life would certainly be <br/>
*easier* without them.  Especially if you are caught up in <br/>
the &quot;American Dream&quot; of having more.  Another possiblity, my <br/>
girlfriend has been waiting patiently for grandkids for years and <br/>
finally her daughther (who is a school teacher and loves kids) told <br/>
her she was afraid.  Her and her dh were getting along so well, and <br/>
everything was at such peace she thought it may ruin it.  I cannot <br/>
imagine it but I can understand it.<br/>

never feel sorry for someone that chose not to have children.  I would feel <br/>
horrible if someone said they felt bad for me for having children I would <br/>
think she would feel bad and maybe a little defensive as well.  I think we <br/>
all need to be respected for our choices.  Maybe she gave the decision a lot <br/>
of thought and decided that it just wasn&#39;t for her.  That has to be OK.  I <br/>
would respect my boys if they decided they did not want to be fathers, it is <br/>
their choice.  <br/>
Just my thoughts on this.<br/>

I meant there isn&#39;t anything more important than being &quot;the very best mother<br/>
you can possibly be&quot; *if* you have children.<br/>
<br/>
But *becoming* a mother isn&#39;t the most important thing a woman can do.<br/>
That&#39;s a personal choice.<br/>
<br/>
Though it sounds like the secretary has made some choices that haven&#39;t<br/>
brought her happiness, if she had chosen motherhood, especially thinking it<br/>
was too much trouble, I suspect she would have not only made herself<br/>
miserable but her children too.<br/>

&gt; horrible if someone said they felt bad for me for having children I would <br/>
&gt; think she would feel bad and maybe a little defensive as well.  I think we <br/>
&gt; all need to be respected for our choices.  Maybe she gave the decision a <br/>
&gt; lot <br/>
&gt; of thought and decided that it just wasn&#39;t for her.  That has to be OK.  I <br/>
&gt; would respect my boys if they decided they did not want to be fathers, it <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; their choice.  <br/>
&gt; Just my thoughts on this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it was more her attitude towards &quot;mothers&quot; that made me say that  at <br/>
that particular moment.  Like it really wasn&#39;t anything worthwhile at all, <br/>
that any unskilled, ignorant person could sit at home with children all day <br/>
and she was just too busy to find time to do that.  She never said she CHOSE <br/>
not to have children, just never got around to it, like raking the fall <br/>
leaves or something.<br/>
<br/>
Being a mother should be a choice, I totally agree and there are definitely <br/>
some women who should never be mothers.<br/>
<br/>
I NEVER wanted to be a mother, didn&#39;t interest me at all, I was afraid I&#39;d be <br/>
like my mother who constantly told me it wasn&#39;t her fault she couldn&#39;t love <br/>
me, so I didn&#39;t want to do that to a child.<br/>
<br/>
I was miserable the nine months of my first pregnancy worrying if I <br/>
would/could love this baby which seemed very foreign to me.  Wondering and <br/>
worrying if I could be a mom worthy of a child.<br/>
<br/>
No one could have told me the bond and the love that come from holding your <br/>
child in your arms and looking into the face of one so fresh from God.  I <br/>
KNEW that would be my life&#39;s mission, being a mommy to my precious children.<br/>
<br/>
You know what?  Not every mother dedicates herself fully to raising her <br/>
children or makes them her primary interest and somehow a large portion turn <br/>
out OK.  So maybe you don&#39;t HAVE to be the very best mother that you can <br/>
possibly be.  But for ME, that is my choice, to be the very best parent I can <br/>
possibly be.<br/>

Glena, didn&#39;t you get huffy when people made comments to the effect that you<br/>

<br/>
I totally agree but this seemed to bring her great pride to tell about each <br/>
one and it was as if these were &quot;her&quot; crowning moments in life.  That seemed <br/>
sad to me.  To have to wonder if a husband would leave his wife and children <br/>
for me and then if he rejected the idea after a while she would reveal his <br/>
indiscretions to his wife or children or whoever she could reach.<br/>
<br/>
One did divorce his wife for her, he got sick, terminally sick, she didn&#39;t <br/>
want to take care of him, not what she &quot;bought&quot;, his ex eventually took him <br/>
in until he died.  I and others were sitting there in shock as she relayed <br/>
all this and then she shrugged and said if he hadn&#39;t died, she would have <br/>
divorced him anyway.<br/>
<br/>
It did seem like a very sad and lonely life to me.  It wasn&#39;t a decision NOT <br/>
to have kids that made me see/say that.  It was more of a matter of fact, <br/>
&quot;never got around to that&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I can totally respect anyone&#39;s decision NOT to have children, for some people <br/>
it&#39;s the right thing to do.  For others that don&#39;t have children it&#39;s <br/>
heartbreaking, that&#39;s why I was an egg donor several years ago, so others who <br/>
desperately wanted to be parents could have that chance.<br/>
<br/>
I would never tell anyone who said they decided motherhood was not right for <br/>
them that I felt sorry for them, but deep down in my heart I probably would <br/>
feel sorry that they would never experience the joys I&#39;ve known as a mother.  <br/>
 Maybe I would feel badly because I was so very determined to never have <br/>
children myself, and now I know the things I would have missed. <br/>
<br/>
I know others fill their lives with many things other than children and have <br/>
many things that make their lives perfectly fulfilled and honorable.  I can <br/>
respect that decision.  I was on that same road myself.<br/>
<br/>
I just think if you choose to be a mother why not be the best at it that you <br/>
can be?  Children are such precious gifts and it&#39;s such a joy to watch them <br/>
grow and learn, yep, being a mother is a gift...<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wasn&#39;t me but I am perfectly able to accept someone&#39;s decision not to have <br/>
children.  <br/>
<br/>
My DH Uncle died a couple months ago, his wife nine months before that.  They <br/>
had no children, by choice.  They had a dog that was like a child to them, <br/>
well actually a couple in their lifetimes.  I thought they were perfectly <br/>
content with just each other.  When Uncle Steve was sick, he told me he <br/>
wished he had seen his wife as a mother and their had been children, but he <br/>
never knew he really wanted them until it was too late.<br/>
<br/>
So sometimes people might regret the decisions they make early in life, but <br/>
sometimes I sure they don&#39;t at all.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, my mother probably regrets ever having children at all and she had <br/>
four.<br/>
