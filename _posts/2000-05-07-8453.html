<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Q: How many homeschoolers does it take to screw in 
a light bulb? <br><br><br>A: Gasp! Is it legal to change your own? Shouldn&#39;t you 
let a trained professional do it? Won&#39;t your little lamp be brighter if someone 
who studied for four years (after barely being able to turn on their own lamp) 
changes your light bulb? What if you screw it in wrong? What if you leave 
something out? Don&#39;t you think you should give your little nursery lamp a chance 
to be part of a huge, glowing marquee or chandelier? Bulbs do need to hang in 
groups, you know. <br><br>Besides, why do you think light bulbs come in multi 
packs? You don&#39;t just go out and get a single light bulb! If one light bulb 
needs fixing, then you know the others are ready for it, too. Give your 
professional a 12 pack and let him/her change them all at once. It&#39;s much more 
efficient and gets you on a schedule with all your light fixtures. And yes, I 
know you will end up sending some perfectly good light bulbs to the trash that 
way, but on the whole it&#39;s best. Don&#39;t regret the ones that are lost to the 
dump. They were probably pretty dim anyway. <br><br>Look, I sent my lamps to the 
shop for light-bulb changing and my lamps work okay, don&#39;t they? Oh, well, 
except for that three-way lamp in the living room which got a stupid 40 watt, 
low-lumens bulb put in when it should have gotten a three way bulb with up to 
200 watts. I was a little peeved at that at first, but I just put the lamp over 
in the corner where I never sit to read, so it&#39;s okay. <br><br><br>Copyright
