&lt;&lt; She was <br/>
 probably even more startled as we were talking about patterns because the <br/>
 reason for our visit was to choose ds first sewing project. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well my son (and daughter) just &quot;helped&quot; me make some curtains for their <br/>
rooms.  They are young (7 and 5 1/2) so the help is of questionable value.  <br/>
But they love operating the sewing machine and picking their own fabrics, etc.<br/>
<br/>
What did you son choose to sew??<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know what they are actually called, but it&#39;s a blanket with arms and <br/>
feet...a blanket robe?  He&#39;s going to make it out of polar fleece.  We didn&#39;t <br/>
have time to make final selections today, so tomorrow will have another <br/>
chance to shock the neighborhood.  LOL  It&#39;s a good project; the fabric is <br/>
easy to handle, but there are lots of details...knit cuffs, zipper, facings, <br/>
nap fabric, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Older ds learned to sew when he was 10, so I&#39;m kinda behind on this ds (age <br/>
12).  What can I say?  He&#39;s the &#39;baby&#39;.  &lt;bg&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have had the nerve to let my kidlets use an electric <br/>
machine before they were 8 or so.  You&#39;re gutsier than I!  I learned to sew <br/>
&#39;real&#39; clothes at 8 yrs old using a treadle machine.  My mom picked out the <br/>
project.  I hated that dress!  But, she did a good job of picking something <br/>
that had lots of different techniques on it...darts, gathers, facings, hems, <br/>
etc.  The only thing she didn&#39;t have the patience to teach me was a zipper.  <br/>
I suppose I can&#39;t blame her there, I know I had to take out EVERY seam on <br/>
that dress before I got it right!  (my mother is a perfectionist)  After that <br/>
project she allowed me to use the electric sewing machine and never gave me <br/>
another sewing lesson.  I was on my own.  It worked.  I can sew anything I <br/>
want to now.  (That means I don&#39;t know everything, but can learn what I need <br/>
when I need it...see I&#39;m an unschooler to the core.  LOL)<br/>
<br/>
I drove my mother nuts for about 3 years before that.  I was really into <br/>
designing Barbie clothes.  But, my mother wouldn&#39;t let me use a <br/>
needle/thread.  So, I was always looking for ways to create clothing.  Snip <br/>
the fabric here, tuck it there, tie it on somewhere else.  The most creative <br/>
I got was to use Kleenex as my fabric.  That was great!  Plentiful supply and <br/>
easy material to handle.  I could tear a hole for head/arms, tear strips for <br/>
belts and the &#39;fabric&#39; came in a very convenient Barbie size, too.  The best <br/>
part, if I didn&#39;t get a successful garment out of that piece of &#39;fabric&#39;, <br/>
another was readily available.  I went through an entire box of Kleenex.  (I <br/>
got into soooo much trouble for that.  My mom&#39;s not as creative as I am.  <br/>
Scarred me for life.  I vowed that if my kids needed a box of Kleenex to play <br/>
with, I&#39;d give it to them!  LOL)<br/>

My children needed a pair of swim trunks for Ken and so they fashioned him<br/>
a pair from paper and staples &lt;gg&gt;.  I will have to show them the kleenex <br/>
box the next time (although I must admit, the paper has lasted a rather long<br/>
time!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-289193134">I was surprised to find I wasn&#39;t the only kid in the world that made Barbie<br/>
clothes from Kleenex.  My mom let me start sewing with her electric machine<br/>
when I was 6 but very simple pieces.  My cousin & I made lots of Barbie<br/>
clothes.  Once when we were sewing, at her house, one moving the fabric the<br/>
other pumping the treadle.  She got her finger under the needle & screamed.<br/>
I stopped the treadle & joined her screams as we stood there looking at the<br/>
needle going through her fingernail.  Parents came in & rescued the nail.<br/>
It took us awhile to touch any machine again.  As for me my dd 7 only helps<br/>
me move the fabric through at this point but she wants to sew.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466059847">We went to story time at the library yesterday.  My ds who is 5 was the <br/>
oldest kid there, but no one seemed to think it was an issue.  Maybe they <br/>
assumed he was in afternoon kindergarten as this was 10:30.  The storytime is <br/>
for kids 3 to 6 so go figure!  I have not had an issue so far like in stores <br/>
or anything and I always wonder how I will respond to any questions.  We are <br/>
very new to unschooling - this is our first year.<br/>
<br/>
Eiraul, I sew too.  I am very new to sewing &quot;for real&quot;.  I always did stuff <br/>
out of my head with no patterns, etc., but I took a sewing class last winter <br/>
and I love it.  My kids are not ready for their first project, but they help <br/>
me and they love picking out patterns and materials for stuff they want.<br/>

<br/>
I managed to put off the needle in the finger experience until I was a <br/>
teenager.  I got lucky.  I was sewing fast enough that the needle came back <br/>
up on it&#39;s own and didn&#39;t get stuck in my finger.  I&#39;ve heard from others <br/>
that weren&#39;t so lucky.  Took 3 or 4 stitches for me to realize it had <br/>
happened, though.  It still hurt plenty for almost 2 weeks and I had to take <br/>
the rest of that day off before I could stop shaking enough to go back to the <br/>
machine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629068289">I had another experience when I was about 10-12.  Mom&#39;s machine was a<br/>
portable which meant you had to set it up on the dinning table everytime you<br/>
used it, cord across open space walk area to plug.  The cord hadn&#39;t been<br/>
wrapped inside the case carefully each time, learned later.  Anyway Mom said<br/>
the cord was stretched to tightly & I needed to move the machine closer to<br/>
the plug.  So I grabbed the cord so it didn&#39;t get caught under the machine<br/>
to slide it.  The cord had a raw spot which I grabbed, barefoot & standing<br/>
on tarazzo.  Got a real shock.  The doctor said I was lucky when I jumped I<br/>
unplugged the machine so I didn&#39;t get hurt too much.  Again it took awhile<br/>
for me to get close to a machine.  I did turn out some nice clothes over the<br/>
years so it didn&#39;t kill my interest.</div>

Glad it didn&#39;t kill you or your interest.<br/>

Somewhere in this house is a whole box full of glass horses with taped up <br/>
