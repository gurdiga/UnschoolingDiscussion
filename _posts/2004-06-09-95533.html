<div id="ygrps-yiv-6393963">I was thinking about the PBS shows my kids watch (we don&#39;t have cable).  <br/>
Sandra, you are so right- Barney is one big school propaganda show!   The <br/>
youngest likes the music though.  It&#39;s funny for me who has been a preschool and <br/>
kindergarten teacher to see their huge classroom with great supplies and <br/>
beautiful playground plus a clubhouse for fun afterschool stuff, with only 4 or 5 <br/>
students rather than 20 to 30 - it never occurred to me that my son might think <br/>
schools are really like that!  Duh, we might have to talk about that one <br/>
sometime (me and the kids, that is).<br/>
But I was also thinking, my son likes Liberty&#39;s Kids about the children who <br/>
are reporters during the Revolutionary War, they don&#39;t go to school and seem to <br/>
learn an awful lot.  Also, Cyberchase- the kids on that show talk to the <br/>
&quot;motherboard&quot; to save the universe from &quot;Hacker&quot;, they don&#39;t go to school either <br/>
and learn how to estimate, add, subtract, etc.<br/>
Yes though, for the most part, kids shows seem to be about school or at least <br/>
set in school.<br/>

And never a teacher!  Just happy music and playing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Ah, true!  Holly loves Cyberchase, and she used to watch Liberty&#39;s Kids but <br/>
either it&#39;s not on here these days or it&#39;s a time she&#39;s not watching TV.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-675621668">Liberty&#39;s Kids has a companion CD-ROM game.  My kids love it and <br/>
they range in age from 6 to a &quot;very mature :)&quot; 11.  The object is to <br/>
report on history by investigating and interviewing historical <br/>
figures/events and putting together a &quot;front page&quot; editorial (no <br/>
writing involved, you choose from a bunch of prepared quotes and all <br/>
the choices have voice over, can be played by a not-yet-reading <br/>
child).  The journalism aspect of the game really promotes the <br/>
concept of journalism as unbiased reporting of facts (ha).  Then you <br/>
can print the page for keepsake.   My kids set up the whole dining <br/>
room as Ben Franklins print shop and play out the characters while <br/>
they are doing this and we&#39;ve had some pretty funny spontaneous <br/>
reenactments around here (involving teabags).<br/>
<br/>
Funny, the darn thing gathered dust when we were using it during our <br/>
school at home phase...hmmm.<br/>
