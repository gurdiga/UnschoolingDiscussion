<div id="ygrps-yiv-273641016"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;My son (I&#39;ll call him &quot;Ben&quot;) would just LOVE if I just *advised* him that <br/>
&gt;&gt;he ought not scream and yell just because I won&#39;t let him eat ice cream <br/>
&gt;&gt;for breakfast.  (Well, at least, not every day.)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What would happen if he *did* choose to eat ice cream for breakfast <br/>
everyday? If he was allowed that option? Do you think that would be all he&#39;d <br/>
eat for the rest of the day? For the rest of his life? Would he not look for <br/>
some variety at some point? Would you not be able to offer some pretty <br/>
attractive alternatives later in the day, say fruit or yogurt or toast and <br/>
jam?<br/>

&gt;&gt;breakfast. When I DO say &quot;no&quot; he eats something other than ice cream.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe he always chooses the ice cream on the &quot;yes&quot; days because he knows <br/>
that the answer next time will be &quot;no&quot;. That&#39;s kind of the psycholgical <br/>
theory used in Vegas. People are willing to take 50 losses because there&#39;s <br/>
the chance of that one win. Random reinforcement produces more of the <br/>
behavior in question.<br/>
<br/>
So, maybe if a child gets to *really* choose for himself, his choice will be <br/>
based on whether or not he wants ice cream, not whether or not he can get <br/>
mom to say yes to something that seemingly bugs her.<br/>
<br/>
When I stopped considering those disgustingly sweet cereals as desert food, <br/>
and allowed my kids free choice of when and where and if to have them, their <br/>
consumption went waaaay down. They seem to eat them once in a great while <br/>
now.<br/>

that doesn&#39;t mean I haven&#39;t found some value in thinking outside the box on <br/>
some of my formerlly held parenting beliefs. :o)<br/>

a time when I did that.  I read, I researched, I though, I sifted, I analyzed <br/>
. . . and THEN I rejected the concept.  No offense.  I am as open-minded as <br/>
the most open-minded &quot;next person&quot; . . . given a new thought or idea, I will <br/>
test it, to see if it is right for me.  And, if it is not right for me, I <br/>
reject it.  For me.  Inasmuch as TCS has to do with a parent&#39;s choice of <br/>
parenting styles, this decision is one that I, as a parent must make.  I <br/>
choose against TCS.  And, if I were 3, I am sure that the TCS people would <br/>
applaud me for that decision.  However, carrying the baggage of 31 years, <br/>
plus 3, I understand that I may be criticized roundly and soundly for my <br/>
decision to reject the TCS induction (for lack of a better word), and to <br/>
choose my own unique and, so far as I know, unlabelled parenting style of <br/>
&quot;Roll with the punches, and learn as ya&#39; go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That works for me.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you might be open-minded enough to consider it for yourself?  And, <br/>
then, maybe later on down the road, we can all coin a new parenting induction <br/>
(for lack of a better word) called RWTPALAYG.<br/>
<br/>
Deal?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, jumping from ice cream for breakfast to killing puppies was a &quot;pretty <br/>
extreme move.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was my point.  We were not talking about ice cream.  We were talking <br/>
about Ben and Sue, and Ben was hitting Sue with a baseball bat.  And, we <br/>
were, if were &quot;the TCS people,&quot; supposed to think that that was &quot;okay&quot; (so <br/>
long as we had not agreed to be &#39;responsible&#39; for Sue), and that we could <br/>
properly address the matter by calmly &quot;explaining&quot; to Ben that Sue might <br/>
rightly have deserved to be beaten with a baseball bat, but that . . . . .<br/>
<br/>
Oh, hmmn.  I guess I don&#39;t think we were, if we are &quot;the TCS people,&quot; <br/>
supposed to suggest alternative behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
And no, I don&#39;t think it a jump from beating Sue with a baseball bat to <br/>
killing puppies.  <br/>
<br/>
And THAT -- not ice cream -- was what we were talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you sincerely.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay:<br/>
<br/>
1.  The term &quot;power of choice&quot; was lifted from someone else&#39;s post.  Hence, <br/>
my use of quotes.  I wanted to point out the term, &quot;power of choice&quot; as <br/>
somewhat &quot;fluffy.&quot;  Your calling &quot;me&quot; on that choice of words was, although <br/>
misplaced, quite appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
2.  I have no doubt whatsoever that your children make wonderful choices.  <br/>
<br/>
3.  I am not being sarcastic.  Nor do I appreciate sarcasm.  Usually.<br/>
<br/>
4.  I did not reject any ideas outright.  Nor did I question the &quot;veracity&quot; <br/>
of any families.  At least, not that I am aware of, and not intentionally.  <br/>
If, in fact, I do so without my knowledge or intention, then, I must ask:  <br/>
how?  What did I say?  What did I do?<br/>
<br/>
5.  I am not talking about hypotheticals either (at least, not about the ice <br/>
cream scenarios).  (DISCLAIMER:  To the extent that the entire ice cream <br/>
&quot;discussion&quot; was based upon the grossly gross hypothetical of Ben beating Sue <br/>
with a baseball bat and being not-chastised for same, then I am, in fact, <br/>
speaking of hypotheticals, for which I, again, apologize (hypothetically <br/>
speaking)(of course)).<br/>

In general, I think kids SHOULD choose their own foods, within the <br/>
boundaries of the family.  If you are a family where mom cooks <br/>
everynight and everyone sits down to dinner, I think the kids should <br/>
at least try the foods offered.  Now that mine are older, if I serve <br/>
something they don&#39;t like, they make something else and it&#39;s no big <br/>
deal.  I&#39;ve never restricted ice cream, candy, pastry, etc.  All three <br/>
of mine have pretty good eating habits now.  They all eat salad.  <br/>
Rachel is the only one who does not like vegetables but even she eats <br/>
a few of them.  None of them gorge on bad foods with one exception.<br/>
<br/>
That exception has to do with allergies/sensitivities.  Our old <br/>
allergist, when I first went to him before we had any idea the kids <br/>
had allergies (actually before two of them even existed) - - he told <br/>
me that often one will crave that which one is allergic to in the way <br/>
an alcoholic craves alcohol.  He was absolutely right in my case.  I <br/>
was craving corn in a BIG way.  Once I got it out of my diet, and it <br/>
was very difficult to do so, I stopped craving it.<br/>
<br/>
So when Jenni at three was drinking a gallon of milk a day by herself, <br/>
and having lots of allergy symptoms, milk was the first elimination <br/>
and challenge we tried and that was her problem.  And I recently <br/>
explained what we had to dfo with Rachel regarding her allergies.  <br/>
While I think kids should have control over their diets, I&#39;m not sure <br/>
I can say it is an absolute.  I think there are times when a parent <br/>
needs to step in to help with a problem.  BUT - the parent should do <br/>
so withthe this thought in mind - the goal is not to control the <br/>
allergy for the child.  The goal is to help the child learn to control <br/>
it by himself.  There are as many ways to get to that point as there <br/>
are children.  In Jenni&#39;s case, just eliminating milk for a week and <br/>
then doing the challenge and explaining the problem to her was enough <br/>
at 3 and she has not needed my help since.  With Rachel, it rocked <br/>
back and forth several times and it looks like Wyndham will be more <br/>
like Rachel than Jenni.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect there are others who have different examples of when a <br/>
parent should maybe do a little more about diet than most.<br/>
