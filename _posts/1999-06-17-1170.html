&lt;&lt; Hey Lisa - A child that likes spinach??!! I find this concept <br/>
overwhelmingly<br/>
 unbelievable. Are you sure your child wasn&#39;t swapped at birth for an alien?<br/>
 &lt;vbg&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m *sure* my kids are aliens!  They ask for artichokes when we&#39;re at the <br/>
grocery store!  They LOVE veggies - from carrots to asparagus to zucchini to <br/>
well, anything!  Brussels Sprouts are another big favorite!  Don&#39;t know why, <br/>
they&#39;re just possessed or something!  lol<br/>
<br/>
Btw - I&#39;m new here, so I guess I should introduce myself.  I&#39;m Mary C, mom of <br/>
2 handsome boys (7 & 5) and a beautiful daughter (16 months).  I had no idea <br/>
I was &quot;unschooling&quot; until I saw it described on the Internet!  But here I am, <br/>
and they&#39;re learning in spite of me.<br/>

My kids love veggies too. But, we have always had a policy of eat whatever, <br/>
whenever - as long as you leave dad some ice cream for after dinner.  We <br/>
discovered that with this rule - they tend to choose both healthy things and <br/>
junk food.  We ALWAYS have a veggie with dinner, and they always eat it.  The <br/>
only veggie we have had to back off from is Brussel Sprouts.  Oldest dd had <br/>
an unfortunate accident when we served them one time...ruined ALL of our <br/>
dinners &lt;g&gt;<br/>
