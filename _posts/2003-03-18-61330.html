&gt; JEEZUS, Tia---to carry on the family name and to do chores! REALLY, the <br/>

This guy always hated doing chores when he was a kid. He couldn&#39;t wait until <br/>
he was grown up and didn&#39;t have to do chores anymore.<br/>
<br/>
When he finally grew up, it was great. He didn&#39;t have to do chores, could eat <br/>
junk food whenever he wanted...really fabulous.<br/>
<br/>
One day he looked around and realized the place was a dump. He said, &quot;Man, I <br/>
gotta have some kids!&quot;<br/>
