<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt; What is the difference between wriggle and wiggle anyway? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think maybe wriggling is intranstive.  Worms do it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wiggling is transitive.  You do it to something else.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe it&#39;s my tape of my Mom complaining about how much I wiggled as a kid,<br/>
but I always thought of wiggling as motion that didn&#39;t get you anywhere, and<br/>
wriggling as the same motion, but with an intentional destination (as a worm<br/>
has).<br/>

You wiggle *in* your sleeping bag.<br/>
You wriggle *out* of your sleeping bag.<br/>
