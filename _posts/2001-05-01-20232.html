<div id="ygrps-yiv-787215026">Sorry, I didn&#39;t realize that I should have introduced myself, this is <br/>
my first experience in a chat room.  I have three children, two sons <br/>
in their twenties and out of the house and a daughter age 8 (second <br/>
hubby, second family).  I quit working three days before she was born <br/>
and took up bookkeeping from home thereafter.  We&#39;ve unschooled from <br/>
the day of birth (probably before if you count buying &quot;stuff&quot;.)  Close <br/>
family is very supportive, but I get a lot of flack from a friend who <br/>
is French.  Seems his father was tutored at home ($$$) and had a <br/>
terrible, lonely childhood.  I keep assuring him that Kate has many <br/>
friends and isn&#39;t trapped indoors at a desk all day.  His next step is <br/>
to &quot;test&quot; her.  Since she didn&#39;t learn how to read until last summer <br/>
(Thank you Harry Potter!), and she has no need to tell time (although <br/>
she reads digital very well) and she&#39;s not interested in mathematics, <br/>
the friend has a field day declaring that we are failing.  As you all <br/>
know, she does excel in many areas that her schooled peers will never <br/>
even know about, so I am not worried, but he does shake me up whenever <br/>
he gets on his bandwagon.  It was after one of his visits that I <br/>
tracked this group down, as I needed a security &quot;fix!&quot;     Thanks, by <br/>
the way...</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-450606668">Hi and welcome! I recommend a book by Valerie Fitzenreiter that has <br/>
no set title yet and isn&#39;t published yet. :-)  My first thoughts are <br/>
to tell your &#39;friend&#39; where to go.. but...since I am a meek and mild <br/>
mommy... <br/>
<br/>
Stand your ground and KNOW in your heart that you are doing the right <br/>
thing. Tell him about Laurie, tell him I will kick his... ooops... <br/>
nope... Does he have kids?  If someone tried to &quot;test&quot; Laurie, I&#39;d <br/>
have to say something. This is not for him to decide. He may be <br/>
a &#39;friend&#39; but he&#39;s not acting like one. <br/>
<br/>
Laurie detested clocks that weren&#39;t digital and refused to learn to <br/>
tell time on them. She hated math and excels at it now. You are not <br/>
failing, but your friend is.<br/>
<br/>
Valerie<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I just hate it when people are so uppity as your friend...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125299005">Valerie - Thanks for your support.  I noticed that a lot of us have <br/>
&quot;Am I doing the right thing?&quot; lurking at the back of our minds and I <br/>
think that attitude is what makes us good parents.  We&#39;re always <br/>
evaluating and reassessing, weighing outside opinions (and tossing <br/>
most!), keeping an open mind and our finger on the pulse.<br/>
<br/>
Notice also that parents of the kids that go berserk never saw it <br/>
coming...<br/>
<br/>
When I was a single mother, we were deperately poor, but I always <br/>
tried to pull some fun out of my hat and would ask my boys regularly: <br/>
&quot;We&#39;re doing okay, aren&#39;t we?&quot;  Feedback is the key!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974246204">You&#39;re welcome for the support. It&#39;s everyone here that is giving me <br/>
the support that I didn&#39;t even realize I needed.<br/>
<br/>
For some reason the &quot;Am I doing the right thing?&quot; never lurked in my <br/>
mind. I now wonder if I was totally oblivious to the outside world. <br/>
lol     I just KNEW it was the only way to raise Laurie.<br/>
