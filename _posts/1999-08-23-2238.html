<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215680946">Hi Candace...and others,<br/>
<br/>
I am homeschooling my niece...my brothers child.  I began watching her<br/>
everyday this past November....and it just feels &#39;right&#39; to homeschool her<br/>
along with my own three boys (actually, it makes my little group an &#39;even&#39;<br/>
number...which always seems to work out best for us!!  *S*)<br/>
<br/>
My brother and my dh and I began discussing how to &#39;school&#39; my niece back in<br/>
May....we all decided to let her stay with the family she feels safe<br/>
with...US!!  (My brother is in the midst of a nasty divorce....his daughter<br/>
has been kidnapped by the mom in the past and is still very skittish about<br/>
being away from family for too long.)<br/>

&gt; parents are responsible and loving and the schools can help children in<br/>

&gt;children (Don&#39;t even get me started on the undertow of co-dependent tides<br/>
&gt;which nearly carried us all out to sea!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For me, school was my constant.  School was where I felt loved, special,<br/>
&gt;important.  I could be anyone and do anything.  But, I must also admit,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>

&gt;blocked out over the years!  I had teachers whom I knew I could go to with<br/>
&gt;anything -- even if it had nothing to do with school.  They were mentors.<br/>
&gt;They were friends.  In many instances, they were parents.  I do not feel<br/>
