<div id="ygrps-yiv-286888205">Does anyone have any suggestions for mediaval fantasy television shows?  Xander finished watching Merlin and really enjoyed it.  Netflix has a feature that offers similar suggestions for previously watched shows but so far it hasn&#39;t offered anything that is medieval or fantasy enough...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-877863875">The Traaseths were way interested in a Robin Hood series a few years  <br/>
back.  Maybe not &quot;fantasy&quot; enough if he wants magic.<br/>
  There haven&#39;t been many tv series that were medieval stories.  Black  <br/>
Adder, but the medieval series is the worst of them (the only one that  <br/>
isn&#39;t really, really great).  Still, it&#39;s possible a kid who likes  <br/>
medieval stuff could appreciate at least seeing all the actors in it.<br/>
<br/>
But the second Black Adder series, set in Elizabethan days, is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-679508992">not a tv show, but a movie that was originally a book - &quot;timeline&quot; (michael chrichton)- is good.    it&#39;s a time travel sci fi movie, of which a large part of the story takes place in medieval france....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-783068733">I have some movies in mind, but some may contain graphic scenes.<br/>
Excalibur<br/>
The Mists of Avalon<br/>
Legend<br/>
Dark Crystal<br/>
The Labyrinth<br/>
Princess Bride<br/>
Many Hobin Hood  and Round table movies.<br/>
There are many movies like this in the 80&#39;s!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380226194">I would suggest Beastmaster (the television series, not the movie)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not medieval exactly, but the main character can telepathically communicate with animals and there&#39;s plenty of magic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-464296633">I&#39;ll ditto the Legend of the Seeker and add Xena Warrior Princess, and even <br/>
Hercules.  They were all produced by the same people.  They are doing a soft <br/>
porn Greek series now.  I couldn&#39;t really watch it, it was a bit too much for <br/>
me.  The movie Willow is really cool and so is Stardust, actually I really love <br/>
Stardust a lot, I loved the book too.<br/>
