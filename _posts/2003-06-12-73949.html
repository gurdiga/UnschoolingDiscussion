<br/>
If they don&#39;t have to be cowgirl boots, but can be other kinds of boots, <br/>
check here:<br/>

That&#39;s one of my husband&#39;s former squires, and he plays cello with us once a <br/>
week or so. He lives in our old house (rents/fixes the house we lived in for <br/>
20 years, until five or six years ago).<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re NOT $1000 (more like $250 to $300)  and I know he can get purple <br/>
leather at The Leather Factory here in town, and the extra would be based on the <br/>
extra cost, I suppose.  You could also learn to make your own boots, but by the <br/>
time you get the tools and you practice on a few pairs...  better to buy some.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could just get a really good photo of you, adobe-photoshop some GREAT <br/>
purple boots with gold threads and silver fittings, and have it blown up, <br/>
framed, and put on the wall.  Cheaper. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
