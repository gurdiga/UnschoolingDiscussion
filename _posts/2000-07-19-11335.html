<div id="ygrps-yiv-971938772">We have two guinea pigs and they&#39;ve made nice pets for our kids, 7 and 3. <br/>
&quot;Firewood&quot; and &quot;Early&quot; (don&#39;t ask :-) ) live in a big cage in the kitchen, <br/>
where they are easy to feed and tend to, and won&#39;t get ignored. They are <br/>
very tame and docile and will sit in a child&#39;s lap contentedly while he <br/>
watches TV or is read to. We always leave the cage door open and haven&#39;t had <br/>
any problems with escapes. They have a reputation for not biting... so far, <br/>
ours don&#39;t. They make cute squeaking noises and I think they&#39;re cute <br/>
critters. I found the chips sometimes used to line the cages to be <br/>
expensive, messy and smelly so I line the bottom of the cage with newspaper, <br/>
which I roll up and change every day or two. I do the cleaning, and I remind <br/>
my 7yo to feed and play with his pets. But of course the responsibility is <br/>
ultimately mine.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you could take care of a friend&#39;s pet while they&#39;re on vacation <br/>
for a week or two it would give you a very good idea of how much work they <br/>
are and how long your child&#39;s interest would last.<br/>
<br/>
We also have a goldfish and a cat, and at the moment, a caterpillar on its <br/>
way to being a butterfly.<br/>

&gt;just keep them in one place, like the bathroom? See those are stupid<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I&#39;ve had baby goats indoors, it&#39;s only because they are newborns and<br/>
very weak, so they weren&#39;t doing much running around. They spend about 24-48<br/>
hrs in a box in the kitchen and then are ready to be sent back to the barn.<br/>
I don&#39;t think goats could be &#39;house-trained&#39;.. the ones I&#39;ve had are<br/>
constantly dribbling goat &#39;berries&#39; everywhere. One of my does always waited<br/>
until she was on the milk stand.. if I didn&#39;t milk fast her fast enough..<br/>
look out!<br/>
<br/>
I was keeping 11 baby chicks in my living room for 3 weeks.. but they stayed<br/>
in a box too!  But on one of my chicken lists, a lady has a bantam rooster<br/>
that lives inside.. roosts on the back of her couch and watches tv with her.<br/>
(They put newspaper on the floor under him, can you believe it!)<br/>
