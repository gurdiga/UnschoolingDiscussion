<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277253642">So then, this list might be a good place for such a parent to maybe <br/>
get some helpful input from other folks who not only *unschool* but <br/>
unschool a special-needs kid. And let&#39;s give that over-taxed mom of <br/>
the special kid a break when maybe her fingers fly a little too fast <br/>
in defensive-mode on the keyboard when someone suggests that her kids <br/>
tantrums are her fault. You see, she&#39;s heard it so many times before.<br/>
