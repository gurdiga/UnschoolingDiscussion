  ** Ok, substitute another word then. I&#39;m not picky, whatever word works for <br/>
you, doesn&#39;t bother me a bit. Usually is my choice because it&#39;s much more <br/>
often than it occurs anywhere else, and it&#39;s much too often, IMO.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

I don&#39;t think there IS a word which means once a week AND usually AND once <br/>
every two  months.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t think your children go to your parents&#39; house, since you assured <br/>
us they are DEFINITELY always right with you.<br/>
