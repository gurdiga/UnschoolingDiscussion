<div id="ygrps-yiv-292072812">&quot;How come if you&#39;re at home watching TV, people think you&#39;re fat, but  <br/>
if you&#39;re at home reading a book, they think you&#39;re intelligent?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly asked me that question just now.  I asked if she knew where her  <br/>
dad was (because he left while I was off visiting friends) and she  <br/>
said she had just gotten up not long ago and didn&#39;t know--she had  <br/>
woken up, read a book, eaten some chocolate and then come out of her  <br/>
room.<br/>
<br/>
She said nobody says, if you say &quot;I was reading a book,&quot; &quot;Fatty!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a legitimate question, with a simple answer involving  <br/>
prejudice and magical thinking. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

P.S.  Here&#39;s a photo of Holly her friend Sierra took and photoshopped  <br/>
(cropped and put the name on, maybe the stripe, not sure) which  <br/>
Iifted from MySpace.  It makes her look kinda scary. &lt;g&gt;</div>
