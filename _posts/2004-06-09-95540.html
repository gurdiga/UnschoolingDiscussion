<br/>
I&#39;m jumping off on another tangent again...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been wondering the past day or so whether kids &quot;like&quot; these kinds of<br/>
activities generally/ developmentally or whether they like them because it&#39;s<br/>
better than the other stuff they have to do in a controlled environment.<br/>
<br/>
In my 4-H post, I was saying how 4-H was pushing a Clover Curriculum on me,<br/>
which I got at the leader&#39;s meeting last night. These are mini-lessons with<br/>
several different activities like Robyn describes, complete with cheezy<br/>
crafts and circle songs, that are supposed to be for kids 5-7 years old.<br/>
These activities seem so incredibly lame to me--something far more geared<br/>
towards preschool 2 and 3 year olds. I can&#39;t imagine trying to get the<br/>
unschooled kids I know to sit down and do these things, nor would I try. My<br/>
idea of developmentally ready learning is that kids will take what they find<br/>
interesting from life, without an artificial separation of age-specific<br/>
topics, and run with it, leaving what&#39;s not interesting or too advanced<br/>
behind to maybe come back to later.<br/>
<br/>
Emily (6) *loves* PBS historical documentaries. I can&#39;t imagine saying to<br/>
her, &quot;Oh, honey, you don&#39;t want to watch this boring, advanced documentary<br/>
on Abraham Lincoln. Why don&#39;t you sit in the corner and learn about doggies<br/>
and make some doggie ears out of these styrofoam cups.&quot; These contrived<br/>
activities are turning the kind of learning, creating and imagining that<br/>
young kids do spontaneously all throughout their day into a curriculum.<br/>
Curriculum has to build this kind of learning into kids&#39; days precisely<br/>
because the act of controlling children and their time strips kids of the<br/>
opportunity to do the same learning on their own in a far more meaningful<br/>
way. I realize I&#39;m probably stating the obvious, but it&#39;s been brought home<br/>
to me again as I bumped, unwillingly, into the curriculum world. It&#39;s just<br/>
amazing to me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I remember doing these activities as a child -- at Vacation Bible <br/>
School and my neighbor&#39;s church, and at Brownies (that lasted half a <br/>
year).  I hated them, always.  I did them because I was there (often <br/>
with a friend -- I wanted to see the friend, not do the stupid <br/>
craft) and there wasn&#39;t anything else to do.  I did them sloppily <br/>
because I didn&#39;t care, BUT then I felt bad that mine weren&#39;t as neat <br/>
and pretty as some of the other kids&#39;.  Double whammy.<br/>
<br/>
The other day Fisher (almost 7) wanted to get out the finger paints. <br/>
His preschool did a lot of fingerpainting.  But I think this was the <br/>
first time he had real fun doing it.  We built up slowly, then ended <br/>
up gooshing together all the colors and covering the whole paper, <br/>
and he was laughing his head off.  We discovered a lot of things <br/>
about color and feel and texture -- we ended up creating the actual <br/>
pictures by scraping them into the backdrop of paint, instead of <br/>
drawing them with the paint itself. <br/>
<br/>
And no one said he was too old or that he needed to do a certain <br/>
technique or that art time was over.  We did it until we were done.<br/>
<br/>
I really like unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

**Dagny loves to do this.  She uses all sorts of things as scrapers - toy<br/>
car wheels, combs, etc. - and makes really neat designs.  ~Rue<br/>
