&gt; room that neither Jon nor I can break through. She&#39;s moaning and flailing <br/>
&gt; like she&#39;s possessed. I&#39;ve tried all my loving, caring and understanding <br/>
&gt; ways. I&#39;ve tried hugging and distracting and reasoning and breathing <br/>
&gt; suggestions. I&#39;ve tried moving her and letting her be. It&#39;s not working. <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a pain in her soul right now that I cannot seem to reach. As a <br/>
&gt; mother, this is very hard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But it&#39;s not the unschooling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess we&#39;re all just going to ride this one out till she&#39;s exhausted. So <br/>
&gt; hard. After it&#39;s over I&#39;ll try again to connect with her.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, yes, I understand extremes. I just try VERY hard to not let her <br/>

hold them because they are flailing, kicking and resisting so much. <br/>
<br/>
   You know, my boys have been &quot;like this&quot; since they were born. .NOT just <br/>
since we started unschooling.    I sometimes find it confusing figuring out <br/>
how unschooling &quot;works&quot; or fits into our lives with kids who have special <br/>
needs.  I dont know how the idea got planted that I blame unschooling for my <br/>
kids behavior.. Or that I dont think it can work for my kids. Or that I am <br/>
against unschooling or that I dont practice it.   It DOES work for them, but <br/>
sometimes I have to figure out how to implement it.  Because I have questions <br/>
and concerns about how to unschool my special needs kids, because what works <br/>
for others may not always work for us, does not mean I am not unschooling or <br/>
that I don&#39;t condone the approach.   Something has been misread in this <br/>
interpretation.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Teresa,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t try to make &quot;unschooling&quot; work for Kevin (my six year old son <br/>
with disabilities); he makes it work for himself.  I guess that <br/>
sounds flippant, but it&#39;s really the only way I can explain it.<br/>
<br/>
I provide him with lots of textured materials, because he&#39;s a tactile <br/>
learner (he&#39;s vision impaired); I give him a safe place with lots of <br/>
things to explore...poke his fingers into, push over, taste, hear, <br/>
smell, etc.  I am with him, talking to him, telling him what he&#39;s <br/>
feeling, what he&#39;s seeing, what he&#39;s hearing...keeping him safe; <br/>
helping him crawl up onto the couch so he can touch the cold <br/>
windowpane, and I tell him about winter, pointing out the clingy <br/>
snowflakes I had put there another day that he can peel off; he <br/>
crawls over to the piano and pats the leg - his sign for me to lift <br/>
him up so he can *play* the piano...and I talk about what beautiful <br/>
music he makes.<br/>
<br/>
I make books for him because book publishers don&#39;t cater to the small <br/>
market of kids with vision impairment; but he loves books and he <br/>
deserves to have books to enjoy.  If he wants to spend an entire day <br/>
going through his &quot;books&quot;, then that&#39;s what we do; if he wants to <br/>
spend the day in his specially-designed swing listening to his &quot;Best <br/>
of Sesame Street&quot; CD, then that&#39;s what we do.  My job is to provide <br/>
an environment that supports learning; he does the learning himself.<br/>
<br/>
I am there with him, giving him whatever help or information he needs <br/>
to make sense of his world, and along the way he learns that he&#39;s <br/>
valued as a human being, he&#39;s loved, he&#39;s respected.<br/>
<br/>
So, for Kevin, unschooling doesn&#39;t fit into his life...it IS his life.<br/>
<br/>
My understanding of this gradually changed the way my other children <br/>
homeschool.  Unschooling Kevin came so naturally to me, because my <br/>
only expectation for him was to be happy.  It hasn&#39;t been so easy for <br/>
me to let go of expectations for my other kids...but we&#39;re getting <br/>
there...thanks to Kevin.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps you understand unschooling in a family loving a <br/>
child with severe multiple disabilities...who also has a gorgeous <br/>
smile, an infectious belly-laugh, and the heart of a hero in a frail <br/>
body.<br/>
