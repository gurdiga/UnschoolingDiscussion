<div id="ygrps-yiv-296646359">You have to be joking, right?  If there was a pet over population problem<br/>
they would be used for human food.<br/>
<br/>
Pet over population is not a myth but if it makes your live easier to live<br/>
in, well believe away to your heart&#39;s content.<br/>
<br/>
And, btw, there are folks that believe in your method of pet population<br/>
control.  The next time you are in the grocery store and pass by the pet<br/>
food section, check the ingredients listed on the labels of pet foods.<br/>
ANIMAL DIGEST is exactly what you say would be around if there were a<br/>
problem:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Many pet foods use condemned parts, carcasses rejected for human<br/>
consumption (rancid, moldy), and the so-called &quot;4D&quot; animals- diseased,<br/>
dying, disabled or dead because they are obviously much cheaper. These meats<br/>
are &quot;denatured&quot;, that is, sprayed with chemicals like kerosene to prevent<br/>
them from being sold as human grade. The pet foods are cooked at extremely<br/>
high temperatures to &quot;sterilize&quot; these meats. Dogs and cats, euthanized<br/>
using sodium pentobarbital (which survives the rendering process and will<br/>
still be present in the food), as well as roadkill turn up under the generic<br/>
names of &quot;meat&quot;, &quot;meat meal&quot;. What is skimmed off in the cooking becomes<br/>
&quot;animal fat&quot;. Always be cautious if the manufacturer is unwilling to<br/>
specifically name the protein or fat source. Look for human-grade protein<br/>
sources to insure that your pet is not being fed cancerous tissue or meat<br/>
from a sick animal riddled with drugs.&quot;<br/>
