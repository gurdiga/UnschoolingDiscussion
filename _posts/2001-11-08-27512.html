<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314888068">I have a MAGIC MILL DLX 9000.  It is four years old. I bought it when I had <br/>
9 children all at home. Well, most of them are gone now and I&#39;m too busy to <br/>
bake bread. I&#39;d like to sell this one and buy something different.<br/>
<br/>
I paid $429 for this. I still have the instructions.  It will hold 8 quarts <br/>
in the stainless steel bowl.  You can knead of to 23 cups of flour or 7 lbs <br/>
of flour. Up to 15 lbs of dough, all at one time.  You can buy optional <br/>
attachments.  This one comes with the standard beater, the dough hook and a <br/>
handy scraper to get all the dough from the bottom of the bowl.  I used to <br/>
make 6 - 2 lb loaves of 110% whole wheat bread at one time.<br/>
<br/>
You add your ingredients, let the mixer knead it.  Put your dough in a bowl <br/>
to rise or directly into bread pans to rise and then bake. The mess stays <br/>
in the mixer bowl and is easy to clean up.<br/>
<br/>
You can see pictures of my machine at <br/>

  The unit similar to the one in this picture  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.magicmillusa.com/">http://www.magicmillusa.com/</a> <br/>
and you can see all the parts that are available such as grinders, blenders <br/>
and such.<br/>
<br/>
I want $250 for this machine plus $16 for shipping.  Contact me at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pat@...">pat@...</a> if you are interested.  I would love to take <br/>
payments but I just can&#39;t.  I need the lump sum to buy a bread machine does <br/>
the baking too. Now that I don&#39;t need to bake nearly as much.  It is in <br/>
excellent shape.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Pat<br/>
