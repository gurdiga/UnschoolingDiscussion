<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi all, </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">My name is Amy Worthen. Some of you know me 
personally, some via email lists, etc., and some of you I&#39;ve never met. However, 
my plea is the same for all of you. As some of you may know, I am on an email 
list for Unitarian Universalist homeschoolers. Although I&#39;ve never met most of 
the people on this list personally, I feel like I know them all very well. One 
of the woman on the list with me has just suffered a terrible loss and needs the 
love and support of many people. This woman recently (fri. 6/30) gave birth to a 
beautiful baby boy. However due to shoulder dystoica the baby&#39;s cord got pinned 
between his shoulder and&nbsp; the mother&#39;s pelvic bone, cutting off all supply 
to him. He was born not breathing and was taken to the neonatal intensive care 
unit at a local hospital. A brain scan showed now brain function at all. After 
deliberating with doctors during the day on Friday it was decided that the baby 
should be removed from life support. This was to happen on Sat. Another person 
on the list alerted us to an organization called Lily&#39;s bears that purchases 
bears for families leaving the hospital with empty cradles and broken hearts. 
Please give any monetary donation you feel is possible at this time. All 
remaining funds will be used for sibling scholarships, etc. Even $1.00 can help. 
Thank you all, in advance for your concideration to this matter.</font></div>
