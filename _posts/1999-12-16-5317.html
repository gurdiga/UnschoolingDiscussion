&gt; <br/>
&gt; If this isn&#39;t the craziest thing I have heard. Sorry but I just came across<br/>
&gt; so missed the origional post.<br/>
&gt; I have to ask this? in your district does your school provide ritilan?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>On this subject, I don&#39;t understand why when children seem to have a lot of <br/>
energy that someone says they need ritalin.  Ritalin is a STIMULANT how in <br/>
the world would that help a child that already is racing around and not being <br/>
able to sit still?<br/>
<br/>
My sons both took ritalin but not because they couldn&#39;t sit still in class or <br/>
had too much energy.  One son finally said to me he couldn&#39;t learn in class <br/>
because it sounded like the teacher was saying wa wa wa wa wa wa.  We had his <br/>
hearing checked, we had vision tested, we did lots of testing.  After two <br/>
years I agreed to a trial of ritalin only because the child was begging for <br/>
something to help.  It was like night and day for him.  His grades <br/>
dramatically improved.  He was able to concentrate on what he needed to get <br/>
done.  I didn&#39;t see any changes in his play behaviours.  The main changes <br/>
were that he was much happier with himself and that it took less than half <br/>
the time to get his school work done and he could play video games without <br/>
getting frustrated.  The sad part is when he asked me why I didn&#39;t give him <br/>
the medication sooner (he was in middle school).<br/>
<br/>
If I had the courage to just homeschool THEN, I guess the ritalin still would <br/>
have been helpful to him to help him have clearer thoughts and I guess in a <br/>
way more control over his thoughts and actions.  If he wanted to concentrate <br/>
on his video games for an hour or more, he now could.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand the part of giving it for kids who have more energy at <br/>
all.  <br/>

said the difference was like without it the world was black and white and <br/>
gray, boring and in slow motion.  With the ritalin, he was seeing things in <br/>
color, he could see all the tiny details and it made much more sense to be a <br/>
part of it.<br/>
<br/>
I think he was probably 12 or 13 when he started taking it.  He&#39;s 18 he still <br/>
takes it when he wants to really focus things he&#39;s doing.  If it&#39;s a lazy <br/>
laid back day, he doesn&#39;t sometimes take it.<br/>

taking ritalin and a fairly high dose for five or six years now.  We haven&#39;t <br/>
seen any long term affects but then again maybe we didn&#39;t know we should be <br/>
looking for any either.<br/>
<br/>
My doctor said it&#39;s a wonder drug for those who really need it.  He told me <br/>
point blank that it would not solve behaviour problems, that it does NOT calm <br/>
kids down but that it does help them focus on whatever task they have to <br/>
accomplish.  It took a long time before I would allow a trial for my son.  I <br/>
feel bad I didn&#39;t do it sooner.  It has made a huge difference in his life, <br/>
he is the one that tells me this.  I don&#39;t see any outward change in him, <br/>
maybe less frustration about some things.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for bringing to my attention that there could possibly be some long <br/>
term affects I am not familiar with.  I look forward to hearing about these.<br/>

They&#39;re giving it to adults.  Same deal, she believed.  If the adult responds <br/>

My understanding of the theory is that the parts of the brain that influence impulse control are understimulated and the &quot;hyperactive&quot; behaviour is the person&#39;s attempt to actually arouse them.  The stimulant medication arouses this area (by increasing the levels of neurotransmitters) and the person no longer needs to actively seek outside stimulation, and as a result can &quot;sit still and concentrate&quot; for longer periods of time.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s the thing, my so is diagnosed ADD and I believe them because the <br/>
medication was wonderful for my child.  But he wasn&#39;t EVER hyper at all.  He <br/>
was totally calm and laid back, hence some teachers and our thinking that he <br/>
was just lazily daydreaming his way through life.<br/>
<br/>
He calmly explained he sat expressionless because he had NO idea what was <br/>
being said.  OK, further questioning came with the wa wa wa wa wa story.  <br/>
Took a while to convince me.  The other two children in the neighborhood that <br/>
were on ritalin climbed on my roof, up in trees, couldn&#39;t sit still for a <br/>
minute and were not very well behaved neighbors.  John just sat around, he <br/>
played baseball, got frustrated if he couldn&#39;t concentrate on hitting the <br/>
ball when he KNEW he should be able to.  Got frustrated sitting in class and <br/>
not understanding, got frustrated when he couldn&#39;t concentrate on the video <br/>
games like his brother.  His being frustrated manifested itself in feelings <br/>
of low self esteem and just giving up on things he really wanted to do.<br/>
<br/>
I know there is such a thing as ADHD with the hyper activity part added in <br/>
but I think they give them another medication in addition to the ritalin.  My <br/>
child only took the ritalin.<br/>
<br/>
The doctor explained it to me like this.  If your child were diabetic would <br/>
you hesitate to give him medication?  Of course not if he needed it, then he <br/>
asked me to at least TRY the ritalin so I guess sometimes it&#39;s a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
From outward appearances and behaviours we see no difference when my son <br/>
takes his medication and when he doesn&#39;t.  It&#39;s his world that is clearer and <br/>
less frustrating for him.  I see the difference in grades and smiles and a <br/>
better batting average.<br/>

seen any long term affects but then again maybe we didn&#39;t know we should be <br/>
looking for any either.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve never heard of possible long term health effects from taking ritalin?? How about ongoing side effects?<br/>
<br/>
It might be time to google again ...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-52083267">It is thought that Ritalin &quot;stimulates&quot; the area of the brain that encourages inhibition, which allows them to be able to inhibit their own behavior.<br/>
<br/>
And it is not different in adults, contrary to what was once believed.<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER...my son also told me that when he used to be on Ritalin it made him*feel* VERY DEPRESSED and he hated it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad he&#39;s not taking it anymore.<br/>

We had some side effects to Ritalin initially....anger became a real problem.  And as I wrote before, my son said he became very depressed on it (which I did not know until 3 years after he was off of meds).<br/>
<br/>
We also had tried some other stimulants (bec. of the side effects) and one was Dexedrine:  BIG MISTAKE.  He went into a manic episode and had to be on Lithium for a year after that...and then he reacted to the Lithium too.<br/>
<br/>
If your son has been using ritalin for a few years, and it makes a significant difference to HIM and HE does not have the adverse effects, then by all means...I think its fine.  Each person should be evaluated individuallly.  And it sounds like that is what happened in your case.<br/>

  We haven&#39;t seen any adverse affects in the five years or so that my son has <br/>
  been taking ritalin.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m sure there are tons of stories I could find by googling, but I&#39;d rather <br/>
  hear what someone who&#39;s experienced it first hand can tell me about their own <br/>
  experiences with long term affects.  I of course have read the horror <br/>
  stories, that&#39;s why it took me so long to actually consent to the use of the <br/>
  medication for me son.  But there are those who it works for and works well <br/>
  and makes a huge difference in their lives for the better.  I was thinking <br/>
  they were speaking about something that shows up much later after long term <br/>
  use, some organ failure or something dreadful.<br/>
<br/>
  Our doctor said if ritalin was the right drug, my son would know it right <br/>
  away, he says it made a great difference for the better for him.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe he&#39;s just one of the kids that it works the way it&#39;s supposed to for.<br/>

<br/>
There *are* doctors that still use the &quot;Ritalin test&quot; but the truth is it will cause *anyone* to be able to &quot;focus&quot; better.  Thats why they now also give it to adults.<br/>
<br/>
A doctor who uses ritalin as a test for ADD is not practicing good medicine.<br/>

  My doctor said whatever it is that ADD is causes a person to be slowed <br/>

  becoming calmer, then the doctors say &quot;Ah, then this child does not have ADD. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  They&#39;re giving it to adults.  Same deal, she believed.  If the adult responds <br/>
  to a stimulant as it&#39;s a  stimulating thing, not ADD.  If a stimulant relaxes <br/>
  them, ADD.<br/>

Well, this is anecdotal...but my brother was on it long term and became a <br/>
major drug addict and has been in and out of prison for all of his adult life.<br/>
There are other factors at play for this child.<br/>
If you don&#39;t even know about the long term side effects, why on earth are you <br/>
allowing your child to take this drug?<br/>
It has been linked to a lot of problems during pubescent years. I would know <br/>
ALL potential side effects of any drug I gave my child.<br/>
AND, it would be a last resort, after trying alternative methods and such.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-907795058">Ritalin is only a &quot;stimulant&quot; to those who do not have ADD. After I grad. from high school I found out about ritalin. I was very upset, because school was so difficult for me. I can certainly relate to hearing your teacher ...wa.wa..wa..wa.. I was also angry, if only I had had ritalin then, who knows... I remember feeling very frustrated and also made to think I was not as smart. I knew that was not the case. It was very frustrating and at the same time a big relief, finially there were answers to my questions as to why I was like that. The only way I can explain it is that when you have ADD some of your &quot;wires&quot; are crossed so to speak and ritalin has the opposite effect on us as it would some one else. My sister stole some and gave them to her friends. They went off the wall. It was basically like speed for them. Ritalin helped me retain focus and calmness when my head was running a million miles a minute. I often wish I could take it again, however my insurance stopped covering it years ago. I could no longer afford it and started working on learning other ways to cope. It doesn&#39;t always work as well but I am doing much better now that I know what the source is.I try to steer away from medicating until I know that other options do not work. You need to find out what works best, everyone is different. **If your child is on it and they are slow, drained and sluggish you need to have the dosage checked and lowered. It took over 2 years to get the levels right for me. Most people don&#39;t realize that it takes 30 days to really see a real change and tell if it&#39;s working. I have known people to send their kids back to the doctors and doctors uping the dosage because they were not changing &quot;fast enough&quot;. End result- too quick to dispense &quot;standard&quot; dosage for all kids, this leads to overmedicating most kids. Ritalin can be a wonderful thing when dispensed right. These days school systems and doctors as well as parents are looking for a quick fix and the kids pay the price for not fitting into their square box ...(round peg in a ...).~Annie~~You may laugh at me because I am different.

had problems and they had to drug him.<br/>
I don&#39;t see how ritalin would EVER be necessary for an unschooled child.<br/>

&lt;&lt; A doctor who uses ritalin as a test for ADD is not practicing good <br/>
medicine. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, they used psychologists recommendations but right at the end if the meds <br/>
didn&#39;t help, she said they said the psychologist had been wrong.<br/>
<br/>
It was the last test.  The others were pretty much behavioral observation.<br/>
<br/>
Are there others?  Isn&#39;t it ALL behavioral?<br/>

&gt;&gt;Ritalin is only a &quot;stimulant&quot; to those who do not have ADD. After I grad.<br/>
from high school I found out about ritalin. I was very upset, because school<br/>
was so difficult for me. I can certainly relate to hearing your teacher<br/>
...wa.wa..wa..wa.. I was also angry, if only I had had ritalin then, who<br/>
knows... I remember feeling very frustrated and also made to think I was not<br/>
as smart. I knew that was not the case. It was very frustrating and at the<br/>
same time a big relief, finially there were answers to my questions as to<br/>
why I was like that. The only way I can explain it is that when you have ADD<br/>
some of your &quot;wires&quot; are crossed so to speak and ritalin has the opposite<br/>
effect on us as it would some one else. My sister stole some and gave them<br/>
to her friends. They went off the wall. It was basically like speed for<br/>
them. Ritalin helped me retain focus and calmness when my head was running a<br/>
million miles a minute. I often wish I could take it again, however my<br/>
insurance stopped covering it years ago. I could no l &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-824717618">Anne, your statement that ritalin is only a &quot;stimulant&quot; for those who have add is simply not true.<br/>
<br/>
Many people have had the same effects you describe without having add.<br/>
<br/>
And many people have had ritalin NOT work for them who DO have add.<br/>
