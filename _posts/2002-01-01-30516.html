<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know, if the entire modeling was via culture, then I would tend to <br/>
agree here.<br/>
<br/>
The differences I see is that the two sisters were only responsible for <br/>
the cleanliness of their room as he was also.<br/>
<br/>
Sister #1 married a darling Croatian man (8 years her younger - he 21 her <br/>
29) and they worked together to keep the house clean. He *does* things <br/>
around the house and genuinely wants a nice home.<br/>
<br/>
Sister #2 is pushing 30 and is a career woman (pharmacist) and is revered <br/>
by the dad for <br/>
*likeing* money so much. No need or push for her to settle down and be <br/>
*controlled*.<br/>
<br/>
My guy *hates* anything that is considered manly duties, like garbage, <br/>
recycling, fixing things. He is incapable of fixing things, most of the <br/>
time I do the fixing.<br/>
<br/>
He also was home with the kid in the beginning while I worked. Even <br/>
during pregnacy he was home a lot putzing around the kitchen cooking <br/>
while I worked right up until 3 days before birthing.<br/>
<br/>
I used to come home for lunch to nurse and go back to work.<br/>
<br/>
He also likes to cook - and is so damn messy at it, that I dont&#39; find the <br/>
*nice* meal worth it. He can&#39;t understand why. I guess we both have our <br/>
issues as to what role food should play in one&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
If he were true to his culture, then me being the breadwinner would of <br/>
been an issue.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody was given chores around the house when they were young (sisters <br/>
included) because the mother did everything and grandmother too when she <br/>
was able.. mostly she was there to watch the kids.<br/>
<br/>
As the sisters got older, they would help around the house because the <br/>
mother was working (as a cleaning woman) and they didn&#39;t like SEEING <br/>
their own mess.<br/>
<br/>
As far as my son goes.. technically he would *see* his father cooking and <br/>
washing dishes as a toddler.. because I was working.. so there was <br/>
modeling (and toddlers don&#39;t see half-ass attempts at cleaning - they <br/>
just see the attempt).<br/>
<br/>
I truly think this is beyond culture.. like a *messy gene* or something.. <br/>
because *he* doesn&#39;t mind if the house is filthy or not.. he doesn&#39;t mind <br/>
if I clean or not.. and he cannot relate as to how a messy house throws <br/>
my entire emotional grid offline..<br/>
<br/>
His mother is another story - she used to tell people that she couldn&#39;t <br/>
understand how I kept the house so messy - neglecting to tell them that I <br/>
was working and her son wasn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Although, I&#39;m still semi-tempted to ask the mother if he had chores when <br/>
young - but I don&#39;t know if I wanted to be jumped on for started troubled <br/>
again *smirk*.<br/>
<br/>

ps. mimi, I am very familiar with the Greek culture. I dated one for 5 <br/>
years way back when and I worked in the restaurant business for 18 years.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Well Kolleen maybe your guy was just looking for someone like his mother that would do everything for him.  I guess you weren&#39;t looking for someone to mother :-).  When my husband and I were first married, we both worked full time yet I made his breakfast, packed his lunch, made lots of homecooked dinners and just was this super woman, I guess I did this because I liked nurturing and he liked being nurtured.  When the kids were born I had enough to nurture so he was put into a different role.  He has slowly adjusted and come a long way in being an equal partner but it has been difficult.  I still put out the garbage, cut the lawn and do all the day to day jobs around the house.  It works out better for us if I make suggestions for a to-do list of household maintenance chores.  He is very handy - just doesn&#39;t like regular mundane stuff.  I often wonder if his mother had not done as much for him if things would have been different.  What can we learn from this for our own children?  I do agree with what most were saying about people&#39;s nature but to me it just means that certain life skills do not come easily to some.  It doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t ever have to learn to do them.  Some people are not organized but most people still need to learn some organizational skills to accomplish the things they want to accomplish.<br/>
