<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219278051">On p. 16 of the current October/November issue of Mother Earth News <br/>
there is a box that says &quot;Home Schooling&quot; and then below that it says <br/>
&quot;If you have experience home schooling your children, please send us a <br/>
summary, 500 words or less, of the pros and cons of this schooling <br/>
choice, your favorite curricula and any advice you would like to offer <br/>
readers.  We&#39;ll use your reports in a story planned for next year.  <br/>
Send your reports to: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:letters@...">letters@...</a> .&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to pass that on in case anyone would like to contribute.  :)<br/>
