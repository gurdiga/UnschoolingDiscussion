<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756869276">what would the *school authorites* say, <br/>
hm I dont really know - it just doesn&#39;t seem right?!?!<br/>
<br/>
Marianne - who spent to many years involved with ps.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I spent too many years in ps, too, both as student and<br/>
teacher, and what I learned is if the *school<br/>
authorities* would object, it&#39;s probably a good thing.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do all your kids say when people ask what grade<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re in? Do they just say 3rd if they&#39;re 8, or do<br/>
&gt; they start explaining about being homeschooled?<br/>
&gt; Because usually people who ask that are just making<br/>
&gt; small talk. Is it our responsibility to demystify<br/>
&gt; homeschooling by telling everyone we meet we do it? Or<br/>
&gt; is it ok to just say 3rd grade? </span></blockquote></div>

<font SIZE="2">Boy we sure thought we found out some &quot; &#39;spicious&quot; stuff! This lady was always &#39;disappearing&#39; into her house &#39;quickly&#39; from her car with &#39;mysterious&#39; packages, and always seemed sad. Turns out (I found out way later as an adult, that she was sad cuz she&#39;d given a child for adoption and later regretted that choice... (although the story did finally end happily in a tearful reunion - her son found her!)) but at the time she was just sad and mysterious.<br>
<br>
Funny... we used to think that cars were following us home from school and we would pretend we lived in other people&#39;s houses and go through their front gates to confuse the alleged &quot;pursuer&quot;. What fun! <br>
<br>
Yes, my son and I saw Harriet together and did enjoy it.. although not as much as the book.. never as much as the book. For this reason I&#39;m nervous about the new Harry Potter movie, although the trailers look inviting...<br>
