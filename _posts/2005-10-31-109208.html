<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659745831">We may be going to another fire station tomorrow night for Halloween.  Maybe <br/>
I&#39;ll get another chance to see the top of a hook and ladder truck   ;-)<br/>
<br/>
To truly understand my interest, you have to realize that I am terrified of <br/>
heights.  Several years ago, we went to Disneyland to the Treehouse (I think <br/>
it is the Jungle Book now).  I hardly got up far at all and I started <br/>
shaking.  By the time I reached the top, I was shaking uncontrollably and <br/>
had to hold the handrail with a deathgrip so I didn&#39;t fall down the stairs.<br/>
