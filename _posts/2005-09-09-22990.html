<div id="ygrps-yiv-766620761">I just wanted to thank everybody who helped us out with the &quot;Stubborn <br/>
ain&#39;t the half of it&quot; conversation.  As expected, we got a lot of wise <br/>
and wonderful information...great stuff for pondering over, and some <br/>
absolutely hilarious stuff on the crickets!  We have been embracing the <br/>
whole TV thing, and you&#39;re right!....have had a lot of fun the last few <br/>
days hanging out and watching and discussing all those silly cartoons.  <br/>
Much better than being uptight about it all.  It seems that it is <br/>
simply a mind shift that has to take place. (Our shift needed a shove <br/>
from you all). The movie ratings info. all makes perfect sense and was <br/>
very helpful. A friend is taking the fire belly toad, the turtles are <br/>
getting too big and heading to their pond of origin, and the crickets <br/>
are staying in our dd&#39;s closet now.  (I have to add, our 1000 crickets <br/>
were delivered yesterday, and sitting in their box in the house till I <br/>
got home with the kids to put them in their bin, when I got a panic <br/>
call from my dh that there was a hole in the box and they were pouring <br/>
out into the house!  There must be something Karmic here!?  The vacuum <br/>
got a lot of use!) One other big lesson we learned is....don&#39;t ever <br/>
post when you are blowing fresh steam of frustration from your <br/>
ears!!! :-)  Jeff and Judi</div>
