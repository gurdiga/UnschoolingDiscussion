There are two background guests.  One, I will tell  you, is Seth  <br/>

<br/>
You know, I don&#39;t have much experience with MySpace yet, but this is  <br/>
the second time in two days that I&#39;ve been linked to a webpage for a  <br/>
musical artist there, and not total local unknowns.  It seems like  <br/>
what I&#39;ve heard about MySpace previously has been about the chat-type  <br/>
service for teens, but here it seems like it&#39;s becoming a legitimate  <br/>
part of commercial release strategies, interesting.<br/>
<br/>
When I was working full-time, my company did a lot of work for &quot;dot- <br/>
coms&quot;, and it was in that exciting dot-com bubble period (late 90&#39;s,  <br/>
early 2001).  At that point, though, so many of them ran out of money  <br/>
before they could prove their market viability.  It is so exciting to  <br/>
see these companies doing things that are just changing the world of  <br/>
commerce now, like Craigslist, iTunes, etc, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I also found it interesting that there is already a Wikipedia page  <br/>
for the video!<br/>

It&#39;s a great method to network and stay in touch with a lot of friends<br/>

The kids and I set up MySpace pages at the end of last year... I can&#39;t <br/>
even remember who sparked it, but it has been a great time, figuring out <br/>
how to decorate, etc...<br/>
I came home to an article in US News and Weekly Report on MySpace.  It <br/>
was filled with the usual Internet paranoia, but if you can look past <br/>
that ::g:: MySpace was originally intended for musical artists to <br/>
self-promote, it has grown unexpectedly in popularity with the  *regular <br/>
folk* (I almost typed *teens* but then looking at my 69 friends on <br/>
MySpace,  more than half are parents! - and MOST are unschoolers).  I <br/>
find it a great way to  express myself (music and backgrounds and <br/>
surveys and glittery doo-dads) AND blog AND stay in touch with many <br/>
geographically scattered friends.  It&#39;s like one stop shopping! <br/>
The coolest thing I&#39;ve found among unschoolers with MySpace is that the <br/>
grownups in their lives aren&#39;t *spying on them*, they&#39;re actually <br/>
invited and welcomed to *share* this part of their lives.  My friend <br/>
list has EXPLODED since the recent conference and I&#39;m really excited to <br/>
see the moms who went home and created a space!<br/>
Oh, and I&#39;m learning waaaaaaay more about html than I ever, ever, ever <br/>
thought I would! <br/>

<br/>
Right!<br/>
<br/>
Just this morning I was corresponding with someone about webpage  <br/>
hosting and wrote all the below-the-line below.<br/>
I&#39;ve learned some good tricks from Holly, even though I&#39;ve had  <br/>
webpages for years and she just started on myspace a year or so ago.   <br/>
The kids are fearless.  I have myspace so I can get into and admire  <br/>
Holly&#39;s photos, for which she has learned lots about Adobe Photoshop  <br/>
(we have a cheap home version, because our old computer had a came- <br/>
with-it big home version and I got dependent on it &lt;g&gt;).  But being  <br/>
in just to admire Holly has turned to lots and LOTS of other exposure  <br/>
to their friends&#39; art and ideas and favorite songs and...<br/>
<br/>
======================================================================== <br/>
======<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I first learned the pages by lifting pages from another hosting place<br/>
(not thinking of the name) and plugging in the whole code.  Gradually<br/>
I learned what I could change and add.   It&#39;s like word processing<br/>
from the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s, if you ever did any of that.  If you have<br/>
kids using myspace, they can help you.  Lots of the same kinds of<br/>
codes and things myspace uses can be used there too.<br/>
<br/>
When you want to mess with webpages (and you can use geocities free,<br/>
so you could experiment and then lift the code and save it for<br/>
otherwhere later), go to a page you like and right click or control-<br/>
click, and click &quot;view source.&quot;  You can start to figure out what<br/>
does what.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The boxes I use on pages like<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/life">http://sandradodd.com/life</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/food">http://sandradodd.com/food</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/reading">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a><br/>
I lifted from a site for recovering Mormons.  I got there just<br/>
surfing some recovering fundamentalist stuff I got to from a<br/>
homeschooler&#39;s site, Kathy Ward&#39;s.  I was so excited about that box<br/>
of links that I lifted the code and very painstakingly replaced with<br/>
my own.  That was years ago.  Just recently I discovered I could<br/>
actually read that code and wasn&#39;t limited anymore to making my boxes<br/>
just like theirs!  But the reason they look so much the same and some<br/>
like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chores">http://sandradodd.com/chores</a> aren&#39;t filled in is... I used their<br/>
exact box. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

And it seems like some people on forums don&#39;t like the guy dancing,  <br/>
but I think his moves are pretty good! (I used to watch him on tv  <br/>
when I was young - actually I remember trying to get home from trick- <br/>
or-treating in time to watch the show, loved it!).  Couldn&#39;t place  <br/>
him without help, though.<br/>
