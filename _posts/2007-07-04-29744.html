<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300825859">Hey all, We went to the beach today,the water was rough and for the<br/>
first time i didn&#39;t hold my son&#39;s hand while walking near the water.He<br/>
was walking in the surf and damn it, he got knocked down.<br/>
  I saw it happen,i was right there and went to grab him...it was that<br/>
darn slow motion type thing,ya know? I got him up and he was okay but<br/>
i have always had this fear of him getting knocked down and dragged<br/>
out and under. Scary for me. If there are no rip tides can it happen?<br/>
Will he be pushed to shore if he falls and be okay? How are your kids<br/>
at the beach? Do you carefully watch them. Do you let them go in the<br/>
surf? I want to keep holding his hand. I always did until today.I<br/>
don&#39;t know if i should let him explore but i very protective of him.<br/>
thanks, Heather mom of Lukas who will be 6 in Oct.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-367623256">Maybe our beaches are really different. So - take this with a grain  <br/>
of salt (get it? &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
By six years old my kids were playing happily in the ocean, including  <br/>
playing in the smaller waves closer to shore.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t hold their hands at the beach, ever. I stayed close by, but  <br/>
let them play on their own even when they were babies. I have  <br/>
wonderful video of my 9 month old at the beach - someone sets her  <br/>
down and she gets up on her hands and knees and makes a beeline for  <br/>
the water - crawling at super-fast speed. She heads straight into the  <br/>
water, head first, gets knocked down, sits up and is laughing with  <br/>
all her might. She&#39;s been crazy for the ocean all her life. She&#39;s  <br/>
gone ocean kayaking, swum with sea lions, and dived from high cliffs  <br/>
into the ocean. My other kids were more careful, not as crazy about  <br/>
the ocean as my oldest, but, still, by six, yes, they were splashing  <br/>
about in the water, up to waist high or so, on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
You have to know your own child, but my experience is that kids will  <br/>
usually do what is safe and comfortable for them IF they&#39;ve always  <br/>
had the freedom to try things. The most unsafe kids have always been  <br/>
those who were so &quot;protected&quot; that they didn&#39;t learn to judge risk or  <br/>
judge their own competencies for themselves.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I guess it depends on where you live.  We live in OR and there <br/>
are sneaker waves and they kill people by swiping them out to sea very <br/>
fast and far.  It happens almost every year.  I saw it happen to a kid <br/>
I had been playing with at the beach when I was a kid.  It was <br/>
terrifying, but he was lucky and resurfaced where someone could see him.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes I watch my kids, as well as myself ALL the time at the beach.  <br/>
I try to never turn my back on the ocean, but generally we relax and <br/>
have fun and try not to worry too much about it.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Depends on the beach. We&#39;ve been to New England and Great Lakes <br/>
beaches - and between the two we&#39;ve seen quite a range of different <br/>
conditions. Some places I&#39;m happy lounging while Mo runs in and out of <br/>
the water, others either I or George are right there with her, <br/>
sometime both of us, one holding each hand and a life-jacket on her! <br/>
So its pretty situational - depends on the beach, the size of the kid <br/>
*and* off-shore weather conditions. <br/>
<br/>
Ray&#39;s nearly six feet tall, and loves rough anything, so we split the <br/>
kids up for beach fun and enlist friends and relatives to help with <br/>
that.<br/>

And the tide and wind conditions that day.  Our beaches on the  northeast <br/>
coast of Florida can have severe riptides. The kids are now 14 and 17  and just <br/>
like they fasten their seat belts automatically, they put on sunscreen  and go <br/>
into the water near a lifeguard post.  They are both excellent  swimmers and <br/>
know that if they get caught in a riptide to swim parallel to the  coastline.  <br/>
 <br/>
When we first moved here, they were 4 and 7 and I did hold their hands if  we <br/>
were in waves big enough to knock them over.  Some of that was my  confidence <br/>
level, however, because I grew up in New Mexico and playing  in water for me <br/>
was usually some rain water in a ditch a few times a year.<br/>
 <br/>
 Even now, when we all go to the beach, one of the adults is either in  the <br/>
water or right at the shoreline. <br/>
When they go with friends, I do remind them about checking the  conditions <br/>
and swimming near a lifeguard.<br/>
And I usually add....watch out for sharks and drink lots of water...That  <br/>
usually causes laughter and a comment from my daughter like...&quot;let&#39;s  discuss <br/>
risk factors here, mom..&quot;   I recommend drinking  water for most any problem that <br/>
comes up.  Not ocean water,  though..&lt;g&gt; <br/>

<br/>
Will you explain these conditions to Holly and Marty if such a thing  <br/>
is necessary?  Their idea of water play is rain water in a gutter a  <br/>
few times a year, or those huge expanses of water:  swimming pools in  <br/>
people&#39;s back yards.  Those things are HUGE!  You could float a  <br/>
inflatable ring in them.<br/>
<br/>
Sharp shells and broken glass scare me, and beach tar grossed me out.<br/>
<br/>
Holly brought a shell back from Rhode Island, that she found  <br/>
herself.  She&#39;s going to give it to a friend&#39;s mom for an ashtray.   <br/>
This is quite exotic for New Mexico.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520462944">Hi~ It does depend where you live. We live near Charleston, SC and I <br/>
lived on Hilton Head Islalnd since I was 15 years old. This part of the <br/>
Atlantic Ocean is really safe off the coast of SC and I don&#39;t worry <br/>
much about my kids and the water. Rip tides are rear event and the <br/>
local authorities post signs about it. In that case my kids would not <br/>
want to go out due to their own fears. My son pretty much hates the <br/>
beach...whole other story :-) If there is a hurricane and the beach <br/>
is &quot;closed&quot; you will find my hubby out surfing...he is a bit wacked &lt;g&gt;!<br/>
So, not knowing where you live and what your coast is like it&#39;s <br/>
challenging to give &quot;advice&quot;. I always try to check my fears, examine <br/>
them, question them and pass valid information on to my kids. I would <br/>
always follow my gut...if it feels unsafe...be careful. Also the same <br/>
goes for my children...I would ask them what they think, how they feel <br/>
about it because I want them to listen to their guts also. Take care <br/>
and Happy 4th! Tracy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789415713">The reason i always held his hand was because of the strong pulls,<br/>
severe rip tides and the shelfs...walk 3 feet out and there&#39;s a big<br/>
drop off! Over my head. I&#39;ve had a hard time coming out of the water a<br/>
few times. I am on the space coast of Florida, we went to Playalinda<br/>
beach. I grew up on long island and was always in the water, when it<br/>
was 95 degrees out the water would be 50degrees and my lips would turn<br/>
blue..but i stayed in and loved it! We had a big &quot;walk out&quot; where you<br/>
could start from the surf and walk and walk and the water would<br/>
gradually get deeper..very slowly. My mother would encourage to swim<br/>
way out over my head and she&#39;d want to keep going! We had life guards<br/>
that would actually blow their wistles if you went to far! I learned<br/>
to get knocked down and the water would roll me while i was under and<br/>
i just hung on until i could surface,lol...we had big waves i learned<br/>
to dive in when they were coming at me.--- In<br/>
