&lt;&lt; King of the Hill is based on Beavis and Butthead? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From here down is a series of quotes from various easily found web info.  <br/>
Mide Judge went to Highland High in Albuquerque.   Beavis and Butthead go to <br/>
Highland High.  <br/>
<br/>
I  just told someone the story of Captain Billy getting shot at the TV studio <br/>
last month!  And I find this guy remembering it the same way.  Captain Billy <br/>
was involved with raising money for the Heart association.   The woman in <br/>
charge of that got too friendly.  Her husband came to the studio where <br/>
Captain Billy worked and shot him, before the show one day.  I didn&#39;t see the <br/>
show that day, but heard about it the next day.  I don&#39;t remember hearing how <br/>
they station handled that first day.  I&#39;m guessing they just ran half an hour <br/>
of solid cartoons.  [Anyone else here remember Captain Billy&#39;s show on <br/>
KGGM/13?  Sponsored by Toys by Roy, in Winrock Mall.]<br/>
<br/>
Same guy who created and does all the crazy voices for King of the Hill wrote <br/>
and did voices for Beavis and Butt-Head.  I haven&#39;t watched tons of that, but <br/>
I&#39;ve seen the movie and a few episodes, and we own a Halloween episode with <br/>
the immortal line &quot;You cannot run from your own bunghole.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(and finally now the quotes start)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Creator Mike Judge has said he decided to wind down the show to concentrate <br/>
on King of the Hill, his Fox TV animated series about Hank Hill and family in <br/>
the fictional suburb of Arlen, Texas. &quot;<br/>

phenomena Beavis and Butthead. His current creation is the Fox series King of <br/>
the Hill, where he provides the voice for main character, Hank. He’s also the <br/>
writer, director and producer of the cult movie Office Space. A self-taught <br/>
animator with a physics degree, Kraft talks about animation and comedy. King <br/>
of the Hill is an Emmy nominated series nearing its 100th episode next week.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;When I was in high school, I used to draw these pictures of somebody <br/>
screaming and running towards the camera. I got picked on a lot when I was at <br/>
school. They ussed to mek ssport of me,&quot; Judge cackles in perfect Billy-Bob <br/>
Thornton, Southern in-breed. He&#39;s superb at voices; he does almost all the <br/>
male characters in the show. For a while, you find yourself amazed at his <br/>
facility for imitating them, until you remember that he invented them.<br/>
<br/>
I was kind of a skinny little kid. I used to draw pictures of what ended up <br/>
being Butt-head swinging the bat at Beavis&#39;s head.<br/>
<br/>
  Mike Judge now works out of a neat mini-studio in Austin Texas, from which <br/>
he supervises the New York production team and records the show&#39;s dialogue. <br/>
He is 34, balding, amiable and slyly amusing company. He has spent most of <br/>
his life in the kind of Southern suburbs portrayed with such flat accuracy in <br/>
Beavis and Butt-head&#39;s home town of Highland.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico and lived in Dallas. I always think of <br/>
Highland as West Texas or East New Mexico. I&#39;ve always had that fascination <br/>
with suburbia. It&#39;s not like I just like to make fun of it from my ivory <br/>
tower. I actually like suburban areas. Even when I was a kid - jeez, from the <br/>
first time I can remember writing something for school. It was about this guy <br/>
who did these really horrible commercials on local TV, this fat guy with this <br/>
slew of fences behind him - &#39;I&#39;m George Martinez for thee Albuquerque Fence <br/>
Qompanee. For strong doorable fenceeng please call four-five-seex <br/>
nine-seex-three-seex.&#39; I wrote about what George&#39;s life was like, and I was <br/>
really proud of it. The teacher never gave it back. I don&#39;t think he read <br/>
those things or anything, just threw them away.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With this kind of encouragement, it&#39;s no wonder young Mike went on to become <br/>
an electrical engineer.<br/>
<br/>

BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD creator Mike Judge remembers watching Looney Toons as a <br/>
kid. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;There was a show in Albuquerque called Captain Billy,&quot; Judge recalls. &quot;He <br/>
was a local guy and he&#39;d show cartoons and you&#39;d go there for your birthday <br/>
and he got shot because he was fooling around with someone else&#39;s wife. I <br/>
remember my mom trying to explain it to me. I was asking her, &#39;Why did he get <br/>
shot?&#39; And she goes, &#39;Maybe he was just hugging her to say, &quot;good job,&quot; and <br/>
someone walked in and saw it and shot him.&#39; &quot; <br/>
