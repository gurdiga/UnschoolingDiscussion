<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230946454">One time my very beloved Aunt told me that I needed to discipline my kids more. They were not misbehaving so I am not sure why she said that. I told her &quot;Oh Auntie every morning I give them a spankin for anything they may do during the day.&quot; Then she said &quot;oh no don&#39;t do that.&quot; She raised two amazing boys. Her son told me later that day that what she said was funny because she never &quot;disciplined&quot; them. Now my two sons are wonderful teens who I love to be around so I feel like I am doing something right. <br/>
<br/>
I had another &quot;Aunt&quot; who was really my moms best friend who loved to tell me all I was doing wrong with my kids. She spanked. punished and constantly pushed her kids. One was killed as a teen in a drug deal gone bad and I was a mean drunk. There was no way I would take parenting advice from her. <br/>

<br/>
Did you mean to write that one was a mean drunk?  I&#39;m thinking yes...<br/>
<br/>
Many stories on my mom&#39;s side of the family involve death and prison  <br/>
and guns and jumping freight trains and all manner of  yuckiness.   <br/>
Except one brother of hers who was not like that at all, never was,  <br/>
his kids turned out great, his wife is still with him after 60 years  <br/>
or so, and he stayed in contact with the others, too, but he was never  <br/>
an alcoholic lunatic.    It was easy for me to look at that and think  <br/>
to be more like Uncle Junior and Aunt Mona than like the Joe Paul and  <br/>
Billy Jack and Doris Mae subsets of that family.  Eeeeek...  My mom  <br/>
was Mary Lou.  For sure they had those kinds of names.  Uncle Joe  <br/>
Paul&#39;s oldest was named Paula Jo.  I have no idea what became of her.   <br/>
Her parents divorced when we were still really little.<br/>
<br/>
My parents moved away from relatives when I was six, and that made my  <br/>
life MUCH better.  My dad was never a drinker, nor his family either.   <br/>
He met my mom from being Junior&#39;s best friend.  Junior and my dad  <br/>
drank when they were &quot;kids&quot; (21, 22 or however old when they were  <br/>
hanging out), and when they got married they were responsible,  <br/>
hardworking dads.  My mom stayed away from alcohol unless she was  <br/>
visiting her family or had drinking guests, when I was younger.  It  <br/>
started creeping back upon her and she let it flow, and so it got  <br/>
worse during my &quot;tweens&quot; and by the time I was in mid teens she was a  <br/>
loathesome drunk.  Bad drunk.<br/>
<br/>
The decisions I made with my babies were in response to seeing the  <br/>
effects of that ignorance and alcohol and irresponsibility.<br/>
I knew how I didn&#39;t want to be.<br/>

OMG Yes her other son was a mean drunk not me. LOL <br/>
<br/>
I am sorry your mom succumbed to alcoholism I have lots of alcoholics in my family. My parents also moved away from my extended family when I was a child. Including my older brothers who were drug addicts. One of my brothers committed suicide when I was 6 due to a really bad trip on LSD. I have stayed far away from drugs and alcohol. I hope my children do too. <br/>
