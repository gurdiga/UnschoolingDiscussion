<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601974091">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Well, here&#39;s my intro - such as it is :)  I&#39;m Linda, from SW FL, and we&#39;re <br/>
unschooling with our 10yo son (sometimes we wonder who&#39;s learning more!)  We <br/>
began last summer, after his 3rd-grade year, and not much has changed in our <br/>
lives other than the fact that we have way more time to do all the things we <br/>
want to do! <br/>
<br/>
We also have 18 and 20yo sons, and I&#39;ve wanted to homeschool since the oldest <br/>
was ready for Kindergarten.....it was always in my heart, but we just <br/>
couldn&#39;t get things in a row until now, I guess, but I&#39;m so thankful we <br/>
finally did!  Our 18yo did ps through 10th grade, and hsed his final high <br/>
school credits (so, technically, we can say we&#39;ve been &quot;official&quot; for 2 years <br/>
LOL).<br/>
<br/>
We pretty much started out unschooling...when I began to research, I <br/>
discovered the term and was so thrilled - there was a name for how I felt!  I <br/>
have a major passion for books, so our house looks a bit like a library (a <br/>
very unorganized one :), and we talk incessantly!  My husband is a behavior <br/>
therapist at a school for autistic children, which is a blessing in so many <br/>
ways; his schedule is very flexible, so the three of us spend a great deal of <br/>
time together (the older boys aren&#39;t living at home, so it&#39;s kind of like <br/>
having an only child - a totally different stage :)  Our 10yo goes to work <br/>
with my husband one (and sometimes more) day a week as a &quot;peer&quot; or &quot;model&quot;, <br/>
and works with the kids; he loves it, and they all love him - therapists and <br/>
kids alike!  I think it&#39;s such an incredible experience for him, and how <br/>
fortunate are we to be able to do things like that!<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean for this to be so long (should have posted it under the <br/>
&quot;rambling&quot; thread LOL)  I&#39;m on a ton of homeschool email lists, and I&#39;ve <br/>
waited for this one for a month or so - I was so excited when I found it <br/>
yesterday!  I just signed on late last night, and when I came online tonight <br/>
and saw so many messages I was thrilled - I&#39;ve caught myself up now (with <br/>
this list, anyway - my son was in a computer-mood today, so I had a rare day <br/>
offline and my mailbox is overflowing!) <br/>
<br/>
Anyone else from Florida?  I&#39;d love to meet another homeschooler, something <br/>
we&#39;ve never done!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m done.....for now :)<br/>
<br/>
Linda in FL :)</div>

great benefits of homeschooling:-)<br/>

getting this tremendous feeling of relief...like I had found myself, and it could<br/>
really happen.<br/>
What a great feeling.  It was like the feeling I get when I drive by the local<br/>
public school, and realize I don&#39;t have to send my children there all day!!  What<br/>
tremendous relief!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225319209">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m brand new to the list and thought I&#39;d do my intro now.<br/>
I&#39;ve only been reading posts for two days but already I really love what<br/>
I see. So many words of wisdom from new and old homeschoolers alike.<br/>
Seems very helpful and friendly here and I like that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Mary from S. Florida who along with my husband Joe, homeschool our<br/>
to younger children. Our son is 4 and our daughter is 3. We have a<br/>
daughter who is 13 and attends a private school. What we see going on<br/>
there is the reason why we decided to homeschool. I would love to pull<br/>
her out of the system, but her father will not allow it.<br/>
My husband I and have belonged to a support group since our son was 2.<br/>
We are pretty fanatical unschoolers. My mom who is an ex-teacher<br/>
supports us as well. We take plenty of flack from my husbands family but<br/>
it doesn&#39;t bother us in the least. They have finally realized that we<br/>
are serious about this &quot;homeschooling thing.&quot; They have no comprehension<br/>
of unschooling and I have no reason to try an explain it to them.<br/>
My husband and I tend to balk at anything to schoolish which runs the<br/>
gamut from workbooks to meetings. We are a very laid back family and I&#39;m<br/>
sure most would think we just play all day. Which we actually do. We are<br/>
very confident in ourselves as parents and more importantly in our<br/>
children. We have never had any doubts that this is what is best for us<br/>
as a family. We are fortunate to be surrounded by other unschooling<br/>
families with older children and also have encountered some wonderful<br/>
young adults who have been homeschooled. It strengthens our position<br/>
that this is the only way to go.<br/>

<br/>
Really though -- we are in the tiny town of Hobe Sound (4 stops lights) in <br/>
Martin County -- which is just north of Palm Beach County.<br/>

I forgot where you were again. It will take me awhile to get you all<br/>
straight!<br/>
I live in Hollywood and my homeschooling support group has a focus group<br/>
exclusive to unschoolers. We have a get together at a park once a month.<br/>
It&#39;s very small and informal. My kids are only 3 and 4 and my 13yog goes<br/>
to school. One member comes from NMB and has a son that is about 10 or<br/>
11. She&#39;s always looking for someone for him to hook up with.<br/>
