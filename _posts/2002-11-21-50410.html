<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429443902">Maybe someone has already brought these things here; if not, sorry for <br/>
redundancy.  I have over 100 e-mails to go (and I don&#39;t guess people have <br/>
stopped writing this morning, waiting for me to catch up!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The parent forum of this list is www.unschooling.com<br/>
At that site, there is a file of unschooling definitions.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.unschooling.com/library/faq/definitions.shtml<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And here is the intro material at the main yahoogroups page for his list:<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn what they <br/>
need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling parent is a <br/>
facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with curiosity and <br/>
enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what, when, where and <br/>
how of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to Spongebob <br/>
Squarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or you&#39;d like to find out more <br/>
about how video games and life in general are filled with learning, come join <br/>
us!<br/>
<br/>
As discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling is <br/>
*not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed <br/>
learning, nor is it done on a part-time basis. Everyone with an interest in <br/>
unschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you keep in <br/>
mind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in ways <br/>
designed to help each other become unschoolers or become better at <br/>
unschooling. We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a <br/>
&quot;feel&quot; for ths. If you have questions about this list please feel free to <br/>
contact list moderator Joyce Fetteroll (fetteroll@...)<br/>
<br/>
This list and the Unschooling.com site were created and are still supported <br/>
by Home Education Magazine: (http://www.home-ed-magazine.com); Helen Hegener (<br/>
HEM-Editor@...) is the list owner</div>

Are you going to update us?  Did you get your walking cast?  It&#39;s selfish of <br/>
me to ask, but you are my window to the future in some ways...<br/>
