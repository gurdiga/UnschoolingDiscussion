<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017758767">First I have to say, I love coloring books!  One of my first unschooling breakthroughs was getting over the fact that my son just isn&#39;t into coloring, or art in general, it is my passion.  <br/>
<br/>
My mom though, works as a child care surveyor.  In other words, she is the one who inspects childcare centers and homes to make sure that they are safe (and educational &lt;g&gt;).  She says that there are so many of them who criticize the children for going outside the lines of coloring books that she is on a campaign to get them to let them just draw and color, no coloring books.  I know, it is an extreme reaction, but she has tried getting them to be less critical of the children&#39;s artwork, and it hasn&#39;t worked.  One of my memories of school is from the first grade.  We were coloring a picture of a witch (must have been Halloween).  I have always considered myself an artist, so anyway I was coloring a large area of her dress and the teacher (Miss Norton, she is dead now) said very loudly &quot;I hear somebody SCRIBBLING!!!&quot;    I was mortified!!!!!  I have never forgotten that.  <br/>
<br/>
So, as with many other things that my mom runs across, I wouldn&#39;t agree with that rule in my home, but for the daycare kids I think it is better to let them just create.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-276674911">When Ellis began SI therapy, the therapist insisted<br/>
that he color with crayons to help build his muscle<br/>
tone.  He HATED it!  I was caught between knowing that<br/>
my baby needed to be left alone and hearing the<br/>
authoritarian white coat saying, &quot;He&#39;s being<br/>
non-compliant!  He has to be compliant!&quot;  It almost<br/>
killed me and after six months and seeing that the<br/>
rest of the therapy had done all it was going to do<br/>
for his development, we finally quit.<br/>
<br/>
It took him almost four years to recover.  He only<br/>
began using crayons about six months ago, but he would<br/>
use markers, paint, pens and pencils without any<br/>
hesitation.<br/>

Will never liked crayons, but he LOVED oil pastels.  <br/>
 <br/>
They do stain the carpet, though!<br/>

In second grade, my teacher was Mrs. Waltman.  It was easter, and we were<br/>
coloring a picture of a bunny and flowers.  We were instructed to use the<br/>
�push-pull� technique.  I preferred the �round and round� method, so she<br/>
grabbed my picture, crumpled it and threw it in the trash.  I still love to<br/>
color in coloring books, but I�m not too fond of bunny pictures.<br/>

Tami, who remembers the crayola ad where the kids spent the afternoon<br/>
coloring inside a big box, but prefers nice white paper or coloring books<br/>
with not so detailed pictures.<br/>

==============<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes in years past (a.k.a. in unschooling eras, &quot;the AOL days&quot;)  when <br/>
people said they really wanted their kids to not watch TV, I would say  &quot;Then <br/>
force them to watch it.  MAKE them watch it, do not let them get  up.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
It was sarcasm but not.  And the other side of the coin is that if  they <br/>
don&#39;t want kids to eat candy, forbidding it is the WORST thing to  do. <br/>
 <br/>
I should go back to that recommendation.  If people say &quot;my kid  would eat <br/>
candy until he threw up if I didn&#39;t stop him.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Hmmm....  How many times would he throw up?  How about MAKE  him eat candy <br/>
until he throws up?&quot;  (That&#39;s if their goal is to create an  aversion.  School <br/>
certainly creates aversions left and right.)<br/>
 <br/>
(Personally I think the &quot;ate X until he threw up&quot; is a boogey man, and  <br/>
throwing up is more likely from stress, fear or parental rant & shame  than from <br/>
physically eating.)<br/>
