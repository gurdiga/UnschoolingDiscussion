<div><font face="Arial" size="2">For music lessons, we made it clear to the kids 
that music lessons were a privilege, not a right, and practicing was expected 
and up to them.&nbsp; If they did not progress due to a lack of practice, then 
the lessons would be stopped.&nbsp; I did not require them to practice every day 
at a certain time, that was up to them how much they practiced.&nbsp; One 
teacher they had was great, allowed my son to jump around to some degree, 
answered questions readily, and never told ME to make sure he practiced.&nbsp; 
When we moved we had another teacher who was okay.&nbsp; She taught by the book, 
a page at a time, and expected me to crack the whip over the kids and have 
regular practice times.&nbsp; She has since quit teaching and we haven&#39;t looked 
for another teacher.&nbsp; Probably will someday.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Reading?&nbsp; Just read to her, and answer her 
questions.&nbsp; Six is so young still!</font></div>
