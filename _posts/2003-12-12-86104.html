<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372203872">Gosh, all you heterosexuals want to talk about is sex!<br/>
<br/>
Well, here is a rather un-unschooling announcement. My 14 year old son, <br/>
taking a course called Evolution in Society (that is HARD!) at Harvard University <br/>
Extension, just got his second paper back. This is really the second paper he&#39;s <br/>
written in his life, as he&#39;s never been an enthusiastic writer. <br/>
<br/>
He got a B+!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s REALLY happy.<br/>
<br/>
So, for all those newbies who find themselves having to defend the success of <br/>
totally unschooled kids, this is far better than bringing up those stupid <br/>
standardized test scores. Julian&#39;s been able to function in this class of all <br/>
adults very well and happily.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;ll go sit down and shut up now. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492472052">That is wonderful Kathryn!! A group of us was just talking about such things<br/>
the other day. About how unschoolers learn to function with schooly things<br/>
when they never had them before. Julian will be a story for me to remember<br/>
and use as an example. I would imagine he&#39;ll want residuals?? &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853799407">Actually, I was just thinking about this the other day. Sarah wanted to write me a book report on a book she was reading. I told her go ahead, I&#39;d be glad to read it for her; but then I was thinking about reports and essays, etc. in schools and how the curriculum coordinator said Sarah wasn&#39;t writing enough last year...the thing is, outside of specific type of reports for some occupations such as lawyers and doctors...when in the world is she going to need to write essays and such? I spent quite a bit of time thinking out my objections to such writings in case it is brought up again at the end of the year...<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll keep it, and put it into the folder we have for our portfolio review at the end of the year, but I&#39;m not going to obsess about her writing. I&#39;d rather Sarah be writing for real..letters, emails, a journal...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Much of the writing done here and at www.unschooling.com is essay-style.  <br/>
Someone wants to tell something they&#39;ve seen or that they&#39;re coming to believe.  <br/>
They introduce it, they explain what happened to get them to that thought, or <br/>
point, and then they close with a summary that&#39;s funny or inspiring or invites <br/>
the reader to think further and maybe respond.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;d rather Sarah be writing for real..letters, emails, a journal...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think essays can be more real than journal writing, myself.  Those articles <br/>
I write for Home Education Magazine are essays.<br/>
<br/>
Two former columnists for Home Education Magazine who wrote some GREAT essays <br/>
were Earl Gary Stevens and Kathleen Creech.  I used to turn straight to their <br/>
stuff.  I wish it were all online somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
I like the reviews people write for Amazon.   That&#39;s some real writing, and <br/>
truly useful.<br/>
If you just look up any book or movie you like you can see what others have <br/>
said and add your own.<br/>
