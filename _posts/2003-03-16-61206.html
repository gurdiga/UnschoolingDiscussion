<div id="ygrps-yiv-652499578">I&#39;m asking for advice for a friend who&#39;s unschooling and is contemplating<br/>
a divorce.  Does anyone have any pointers to information about child<br/>
custody for homeschoolers? <br/>

Thank you!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Gather as much proof as you can that the husband has supported<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling before the separation.<br/>
In general, judges are loathe to change the schooling situation when a<br/>
family splits up.<br/>
If someone is already divorced and wants to homeschool it tends to be harder<br/>
to get approval in court.<br/>
