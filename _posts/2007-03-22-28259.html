<div id="ygrps-yiv-600471339">I need help with my 5yo. son. Whenever he doesn&#39;t hear the answer he<br/>
wants or a situation happens that is beyond my or my husbands control,<br/>
he screams and runs off. I want to help him and our family because it<br/>
is very stressful to all of us. I make as much as i can userfriendly. <br/>
 I will write some examples;Kuas is riding his 4x4 and gets stuck in<br/>
sand, as soon as that happens he cries out: Oooh,it&#39;s stuck! and runs<br/>
off screaming and crying. It happens too fast for me to help him. I<br/>
tell him that i am here for him, maybe instead of running off<br/>
screaming he could ask for my him to unstick it.<br/>
He asks for cheese puffs(he has them most of the time) when we run<br/>
out, Daddy says he will buy them whem he goes to the store or we tell<br/>
him we don&#39;t have the money today but will get them as soon as we can.<br/>
This answer sets him off again and he screams : NO! I want them NOW! I<br/>
tell him i understand he wants them and i&#39;m sorry but he has to<br/>
wait.He screams and runs off crying. He will come back and ask;How<br/>
about in a minute? I repeat the above and he screams more. Then my<br/>

him&quot;<br/>

When we try to eat, Lukas wants a book read or he wants to watch<br/>
cartoons when dh is watching a show and dh will put them on just to<br/>
&quot;shut him up&quot; Stop him from throwing a fit.<br/>
We meet his wants and needs as much as we can. <br/>
We buy and have what he likes in the house but sometimes he will have<br/>
a want,suddendly for something that&#39;s not here(chesepuffs) and we<br/>
didn&#39;t know he wanted. I try to look ahead and plan.<br/>
What do i do better to stop the screaming? thanks!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143987631">I really sympathize with what you are going through, because I have had similar issues with my 4 year old daughter.  Maybe I&#39;m too harsh, but I don&#39;t allow my children to impose their will over other members of the family.  We all have to learn to live together, and of course sometimes nerves get frayed, but part of the learning and growing experience includes respect for other people.  It could be that your son is frustrated because he needs to be engaged in an activity that stimulates his curiosity, or he may be frustrated because he needs more boundaries.  You might say something like &quot;we don&#39;t have any of that right now, but we do have this&quot; and offer an alternative and then suggest some fun activity that you could do together.  If that doesn&#39;t work you might try sending him to his room until he stops screaming with the understanding that he is free to come and join you at any time as long as the screaming stops.  When your husband wants to watch T.V. let him know that<br/>
 this is Daddy&#39;s time to watch T.V. and take him out of the room if he screams.  He needs to understand that there are many hours during the day for him to watch what he wants, but Dad needs time also and this is showing respect for others.<br/>
   <br/>
  I hope that helps, but I understand that many different approaches could be tried until the right one does the trick.  Another idea that came to me is to keep a record of what he eats and see if you notice a change in behavior when certain foods are consumed.  I don&#39;t know much about food allergies or if that might play a role in his behavior, but it&#39;s worth investigation.<br/>
   <br/>
  Hang in there!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-937747628">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt; What do i do better to stop the screaming? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that has helped me be more compassionate, kinder and more <br/>
able to help Jayn is to let go of having this as a goal. He might be hearing <br/>
you telling him that he has to &quot;stop screaming&quot; as the the same as, &quot;you <br/>
have to stop feeling angry&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If you can think of it in terms of facilitating your son&#39;s need to express <br/>
and release safely, instead of looking at that as something that has to be <br/>
stopped it might help you.<br/>
<br/>
The question that I prefer to ask myself is &quot;How can I show Jayn my love <br/>
even when she is being hard to cope with?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
By wanting to stop the screaming what you are really telling your son is <br/>
that his feelings are not valid, that he is not loveable when he is upset or <br/>
angry, that his priorities and frustrations are not real or important. <br/>
Children&#39;s feelings and priorities are equally as important to them as <br/>
adults&#39; feelings are to them.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that you empathize with his feelings more and do less to <br/>
shut them off. Something to look at is the idea that frustrations continue <br/>
to build - without the &quot;safety valve&quot; of letting off steam by crying over <br/>
the small things, they can build up so that the next small frustration <br/>
becomes a trigger for an explosion. It seems to the parents like an <br/>
over-reaction, but what it really it is the accumulation of many small <br/>
moments of being quashed coming out.<br/>
<br/>
What safe place can you take your son to, safe for son and less intrusive <br/>
for the other family members, and stay with him rather than banish him, <br/>
while he releases his tension through crying and screaming? What words can <br/>
you use to empathize and validate his feelings?<br/>
<br/>
Some useful sources of information are &quot;Raising Our Children, Raising <br/>
Ourselves&quot; by Naomi Aldort, &quot;The Explosive Child&quot; by Ross Greene(?) and some <br/>
of Aletha Solther&#39;s writings.<br/>
<br/>
It may help you to think of it as if his cup is so full of frustration that <br/>
the least little drop causes it to overflow. He may need some good, long, <br/>
supported crying and screaming sessions to release the stress to let the cup <br/>
empty, before he is ready to hear about his own behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Just because we adults don&#39;t see the events in our children&#39;s lives as <br/>
stressful, doesn&#39;t mean the child may not be feeling stressed about things. <br/>
What you may consider appropriate boundaries may be being felt by him as <br/>
intolerably restrictive and counter to his way of being.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This comes at the behavior from the angle that it is wrong and needs<br/>
&quot;solutions&quot;. As Robin stated, beautifully so, sometimes children just need<br/>
to &quot;explode&quot; with emotions, and some children are wired to do it more than<br/>
others, and some children have more stresses in their lives, whether because<br/>
they have more negative things going on or because their bodies have<br/>
stronger reactions to typical life, and in either case, they NEED to let<br/>
that emotion out. Figuring out how to stop it is NOT what they need. Feeling<br/>
calm, loving support around them when they are feeling their worst IS what<br/>
they need. If you were exploding with frustration or anger, would you want<br/>
the people around you scurrying (in thought or in action)to figure out how<br/>
to stop you from feeling it? Or would you like loving people around you who<br/>
knew that you were a whole and capable person just struggling in the moment?<br/>
<br/>
While it is important to eventually some day notice the needs of others<br/>
around us, children get this over time and at different ages. I think it is<br/>
unfair to expect kids in emotional turmoil to also look at what is best for<br/>
everyone around them. Heck, that is hard for adults, and near impossible for<br/>
young ones. The parent needs to take care of this for the child. While<br/>
deeply respecting the need of the child (staying calm and supportive)the<br/>
parent needs to figure out what space works. Maybe that means physically<br/>
moving, maybe it means asking for others to move, maybe it means leaving a<br/>
restaurant or grocery store.<br/>
<br/>
In my home when my kids were little, ds had higher needs this way than the<br/>
other three. Surprisingly (or not), when ds had the intense feelings, his<br/>
siblings actually asked me to go take care of him, giving up their time with<br/>
me for a while. They instinctively knew that ds needed my support. They knew<br/>
if they were struggling like ds was, they would want mom&#39;s loving support.<br/>
And they also knew that my taking care of him in his time of need meant that<br/>
he would be a better sibling after. And he always was. It is a healing<br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
None of my kids tantrum or act out today. You do not have to worry that<br/>
these intense feelings that come out as screams and tantrums will continue<br/>
as they get older if you support them through it now.<br/>
<br/>

and then with a &quot;I&#39;m here if you need me.&quot; through the bathroom door. It is<br/>
important that he not think you are trying to persuade him to do or be<br/>
anything different from what he is. Whatever he is doing, appreciate HIM,<br/>
not necessarily the behavior or feelings, but the boy who is underneath it<br/>
all, struggling to get rid of the junk so that he can shine again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-194884127">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;I have just finished Ross greene&#39;s book but the situations didn&#39;t seem<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to apply to how/why Lukas explodes and i felt the book didn&#39;t offer<br/>
&gt; enough solutions. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I always feel like the practices in that book are where Unschoolers start <br/>
with all their children, particularly the idea of letting go of the need to <br/>
control every little thing (the baskets concept). It always amazes me now <br/>
when I read more conventional parenting books the kind of issues that <br/>
parents are getting tied in knots about, like haircuts or wearing pajamas <br/>
or...well all the stuff Unschooling has shown me how to just let go of <br/>
trying or even wanting to control.<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking for solutions to &quot;stop the screaming&quot;, I don&#39;t think that <br/>
book is about that. I think it is about responding lovingly to the needs <br/>
that kids have, and about making life more peaceful overall, creating the <br/>
environment where the stressors are reduced so that there are fewer <br/>
outbursts over time as the child matures. YMMV.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I really do validate Lukas&#39; feelings, I say things<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; like: your upset because the 4x4 is stuck or Your sad.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm. If you are making an assumption that the immediate apparent problem is <br/>
what is causing the upset but the real stress is more nebulous those words <br/>
wouldn&#39;t help. Also screaming is probably not &quot;sad&quot;. Some of those &quot;this is <br/>
how to validate&quot; ideas come from the notion that children need to be taught <br/>
the right words to identify their own feelings.  :/<br/>
<br/>
For me validating and empathizing with Jayn is less wordy. It is about <br/>
allowing my internal conviction that Jayn has the right to feel and express <br/>
her feelings show on my face and in my body. Sometimes it is more like <br/>
saying, &quot;What a shame&quot; if the root of the problem really is right in the <br/>
moment. Sometimes it is just nodding and saying, &quot;I know&quot;. Sometimes it is <br/>
just holding out my arms.<br/>
<br/>
My clue usually is if I fix it (to use your example, pull the truck out of <br/>
the sand) but she stays upset or cranky then that clearly wasn&#39;t the real <br/>
cause. I&#39;m very lucky with Jayn because she is a child that usually wants to <br/>
be hugged when there is a problem, and certainly wants to interact <br/>
physically when she is stressed - so it is a lot easier for me to help her. <br/>
However sometimes I just get it wrong too, and the outburst escalates.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  I like your<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; idea about taking him somewhere when he *explodes* I don&#39;t know how i<br/>
&gt; can though because it&#39;s so sudden and we live in a small house(619<br/>
&gt; square feet) So, everything is heard. Plus, when he gets that upset,<br/>
&gt; he runsinto the bathroom and doesn&#39;t want anyone to bother him.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry to be chuckling but, um, you don&#39;t know how you can, but he <br/>
already does! It&#39;s not my idea, it&#39;s the idea of other people who have <br/>
shared it over the years, AND it apparently is his idea too. So the bathroom <br/>
is his haven. I bet he enjoys in a visceral kind of way the echoey reverb <br/>
that bathrooms often have. Can he run water over his hands while in there?<br/>
<br/>
I love the suggestion to just be available on the other side of the door. I <br/>
would add that on no account give him a lecture about not screaming when he <br/>
emerges.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that much later, after dinner, when Jayn and I are snuggling <br/>
quietly on the sofa or bed is the best time to ask a few questions about her <br/>
feelings earlier. BTW she has found screaming into a pillow to be really <br/>
effective. There have been times when one really good scream is all she has <br/>
needed to let out the frustration. Or pouring out some water. Sometimes our <br/>
best conversations about feelings have happened during a physical activity. <br/>
(Do I seem to be saying this over and over on every list I am on? Probably <br/>
to remind myself of it.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14989861">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; How about when we tell him<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he can&#39;t have something right now and he insists&quot;in a minute?&quot; should<br/>
&gt; we pacify him with: yes, in a minute or be truthful...tomorrow we will<br/>
&gt; get it for you! and let him pitch his fit? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you really not know the answer to this? Is your heart really telling you <br/>
to lie to your son? Worse, to do it habitually?<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t help feeling that it wouldn&#39;t be long before he stopped trusting <br/>
anything you said.<br/>
<br/>
Only say tomorrow if that is the truth. Pacifying him is only postponing <br/>
expressing his grief.<br/>
<br/>
However, people have reported success with pursuing a magical fantasy with <br/>
their upset child along the lines of &quot;Gee wouldn&#39;t it be great if we could <br/>
just wave a magic wand and have all the cheese puffs we want any time. What <br/>
if I could wave my wand over that tree and it would just grow cheese puffs <br/>
as if they were oranges. Or maybe we could have a magic cow that gave cheese <br/>
puffs instead of milk. I wish we could have that.&quot; It shows that you are <br/>
sympathetic to the seriousness of his desire.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea is to stop saying &quot;but&quot;. Stop before the &quot;but&quot;. The &quot;but&quot; is <br/>
part of what is negating the feelings that are real and strong right now. <br/>
You reported that you have said things like, &quot;I&#39;m sorry that we don&#39;t have <br/>
any puffs, but we&#39;ll get more tomorrow.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You are thinking logically and sensibly, BUT he isn&#39;t able to do that yet <br/>
developmentally. He is probably hearing everything after the &quot;but&quot; as <br/>
minimizing. You might have more success if you stick with just the empathy <br/>
portion of the statement (&quot;I&#39;m so sorry we&#39;re out of puffs&quot;) and let him <br/>
mourn that loss for a while until he is ready to hear the solution portion.<br/>
<br/>
As for you and your dh coping with your nerves, the best suggestion I have <br/>
is to try to breathe through it. Notice your feelings but don&#39;t follow them <br/>
or dive into them, if that makes sense. Deep breaths. Vocalize that you are <br/>
taking some deep breaths to help you stay calm.<br/>
<br/>
When Jayn was a baby, from about 12 weeks old for about 4 weeks Jayn would <br/>
cry for about 20-30 minutes every evening. This is something that is <br/>
perfectly normal for some percentage of babies (See Brazelton &quot;Touchpoints&quot; <br/>
for more information). It was not colic, and it was not because Jayn had any <br/>
need other than to cry. I supported her need to cry - the infant version of <br/>
talking out her busy day - by taking her to a private place and holding her, <br/>
looking into her eyes and every now and then murmuring something positive <br/>
like &quot;Yes, what a hard time.&quot; Eventually she would give a little sigh and <br/>
latch on to my always available nipple. It took a concious choice not to get <br/>
caught up in the noise of her crying, but to focus actually on her. One <br/>
thing that helped me was the mantra &quot;This too shall pass&quot;. If I focussed on <br/>
how hard the crying was to listen to, it felt like it lasted for hours (even <br/>
though it didn&#39;t).<br/>
<br/>
Danielle Conger has a great deal of stuff about meditation and strategies <br/>
that help her support her son&#39;s rages. Her writing is linked from <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/danielleconger">http://sandradodd.com/danielleconger</a>  She also owns the Always Unschooled <br/>
list for the parents of younger children (also linked from the same page).<br/>
<br/>
There is a kind of rigor in committing to honesty with one&#39;s children. There <br/>
have been moments when I was tempted to utilize a &quot;little white lie&quot; such as <br/>
&quot;the store was out&quot; instead of admitting I just forgot. But I remind myself <br/>
to be scrupulously honest with Jayn, so that now I feel strong tension when <br/>
I am skirting towards leaving something out. The one time that I was living <br/>
a lie with her, without intending to be so, damaged the trust we had built. <br/>
(It was that I wasn&#39;t expressing my true opinion about one of her friends.)<br/>
<br/>
Truth has become so much a part of our life that I get a kind of shock when <br/>
I hear other parents just using lies for their convenience. Just the other <br/>
day I heard a Mom saying, &quot;The museum is closing now&quot; because she was ready <br/>
to leave, instead of being honest about it being her choice. It is a way of <br/>
abrogating responsibility for choosing to be the authority. And it appears <br/>
in the short term to be the easiest choice, the pacifying action, but kids <br/>
aren&#39;t stupid. The child in question with the &quot;closing&quot; museum incident was <br/>
entirely dubious and pointed out several people actually entering. So then <br/>
the lie had to change to &quot;They are *getting ready* to close.&quot; Yeah in 2 1/2 <br/>
hours time! The kid knew. He knew he couldn&#39;t trust his Mom to tell him the <br/>
truth if it was at all inconvenient for her.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s the difference between recitation and conversation, though.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it can be tone of voice.  There is a bad, bad baby-talking  <br/>
way to do things.  And there&#39;s a real, human-voice way.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was really furious at someone we know for condescending to  <br/>
her.  I helped her figure out why she was angry by asking her  <br/>
questions, and saying &quot;Maybe you feel like he thinks...&quot; kinds of  <br/>
things.  She rejected some and accepted others, in a &quot;getting warm&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;getting cold&quot; kind of way and by the time she was calmed down  <br/>
she also had a better idea of what was up.   As furious as she was,  <br/>
though, had I baby-talked her and *told* her what she was angry about  <br/>
(in the opinion of mine that might have been wrong), she would&#39;ve  <br/>
been furious with me too.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when something goes wrong for me I&#39;m not angry about that.   <br/>
If my 4x4 was stuck I might throw a fit NOT because it was stuck, but  <br/>
because I hadn&#39;t wanted to ride it then anyway, or hadn&#39;t wanted to  <br/>
ride it in that place but had been given no other options, or because  <br/>
someone said &quot;Don&#39;t get it stuck&quot; and that was an infuriating thing  <br/>
and now that it&#39;s stuck I&#39;ll have to hear &quot;I told you not to get it  <br/>
stuck.&quot;  There could be lots of things that started way before that  <br/>
were worse than it being stuck.<br/>

I would distract him with something altogether different.  If you  <br/>

a fish-mold, for a bathtub fish--we did that a lot), and offer him a  <br/>
long, fun bath.  Put a CD player in there and put on some music he  <br/>

<br/>
If someone wants cheese puffs and there aren&#39;t any, maybe the worst  <br/>
thing to do is discuss cheese puffs.<br/>

Without knowing what all has lead up to this and what leads up to it  <br/>
in the moment, I can&#39;t really say.  Do you have friends who know you  <br/>
and him well enough to advise you on what might be happening?  They  <br/>
might see something you don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Are you treating your son more like a kid than like a person?  Are  <br/>
you treating him more like a theoretical kid who &quot;should&quot; be doing  <br/>
this or that, instead of seeing him clearly for what he can do and  <br/>
what he does like?<br/>
<br/>
Do you know what his favorite foods are and can you just plan ahead  <br/>
to the point that you never run out?  We have lots of such things  <br/>
here.  Milk.  We have run out of milk twice in the past ten years.   <br/>
We just make sure there&#39;s milk here the same way we make sure there&#39;s  <br/>
toilet paper.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, I know people who can run out of toilet paper.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes kids are frustrated because parents don&#39;t plan ahead  <br/>
better. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

gave me such an &quot;ah ha&quot; moment I couldn&#39;t resist.  I too have read  <br/>
the How to Talk books, and I have to say that in many cases the  <br/>
suggestions did work, but not always.  What ALWAYS works is real,  <br/>
honest, respectful, genuine connecting with my children.  That&#39;s what  <br/>
they respond to.  When my girls were 5 they responded well to the re- <br/>
stating their feelings.  But now if I try that they tell me to shut  <br/>
up.  Yeah... I&#39;d say the same thing to someone who tried to talk to  <br/>
me like that.  Kids can always tell if your &quot;there&quot; or if your just  <br/>
whipping out tactics to try and &quot;fix&quot; a situation.  One is genuine,  <br/>
the other is phony.<br/>

&gt; If you were upset and crying and your husband said &quot;You can cry, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; okay, I love you&quot; would that help? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. Completely! Especially if it is accompanied by open arms. (Not if it <br/>
were dismissive.)<br/>
<br/>
Especially if it used to be some version of &quot;Go away and cry somewhere I <br/>
can&#39;t hear you. You can come back when you are happy again.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jayn has often been helped by, &quot;It&#39;s OK to cry. I love you&quot; and open arms. <br/>
As an aside there are times when she has been helped by &quot;It&#39;s OK to throw <br/>
up&quot; when she was holding back.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a huge fan of Dr. Phil, but one phrase he has that I do like is the <br/>
idea that your spouse is your &quot;soft place to fall&quot;. I want to be that for <br/>
Jayn also.<br/>
<br/>
Too many people, children and adults, spend their lives only feeling loved <br/>
when they are happy and pleasant. Helping our children know they are still <br/>
loved even when they are angry is really important.<br/>
<br/>
Distraction in the moment might be very kind and help a child learn how to <br/>
wait patiently, but it might also just postpone the expression of anger, if <br/>
getting the stress out is the true need. Getting to the heart of the need <br/>
seems to be the important process.<br/>

That&#39;s different.  I had taken the original to mean &quot;Go ahead and  <br/>
cry&quot; as if crying all by itself would be a cure.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people fixate on a problem and it blots out the entire  <br/>
horizon for them, and they forget anything else in the world existed  <br/>
or ever will except That One PROBLEM.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not good.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes people leave another person to cry.  It&#39;s different to  <br/>
offer to hold a person while she&#39;s crying.  That&#39;s a whole different  <br/>
thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Active listening is really helpful when children need to vent and be heard free of judgment, advice, suggestions etc. I too read PET and Faber and Mazlish and although I still like those books I&#39;ve now found something much more authentic - Naomi Aldort&#39;s Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves and this type of unschooling group list. Stopping the medicating of emotions is so important. Allowing our children to feel and be angry or sad or whatever it is without trying to fix it (if it&#39;s not a possibility) for them just to simply stop them crying. It is hard sometimes to listen to crying/raging/screaming and remain calm and kind a nd nurturing but such a wonderful gift we can give to our children.<br/>

  -Looking at it that way would make me angry too. Thank s Sandra. I was<br/>
