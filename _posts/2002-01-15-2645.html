<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518627836">People used to believe the world was flat.... but we learn new things about<br/>
life everyday.  Personally I don&#39;t need to prove it to anyone.  I wonder<br/>
where that idea came from that something is only &quot;real&quot; if you can prove<br/>
it... Probably scientists.... As I said before... &quot;Science is nothing more<br/>
than a modern superstition&quot;.... That works for me and Science cannot prove<br/>
it is anything more than a modern superstition... So I guess that&#39;s Check<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s more about evidence. What evidence is there that the 6th sense<br/>
<br/>
exists? You yourself admitted that all those events you predicted could<br/>
<br/>
have been coincidence. You may not think they were coincidence, but you<br/>
<br/>
can&#39;t prove they weren&#39;t. And it&#39;s no good saying that I can&#39;t prove<br/>
<br/>
that they *were* coincidence either. If you want to establish something<br/>
<br/>
as a fact, the burden of proof lies on showing that the extraordinary<br/>
<br/>
*does* exist and *not* on proving that it can&#39;t exist.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t really care about how far away stars are or all that, but there are <br/>
simpler things people can discover on their own without trusting a book to <br/>
teach them.  And something lots of people can discover independently has more <br/>
validity to me than things one person says and lots of other glom onto out of <br/>
faith or trust when they can&#39;t actually reproduce the result in their own <br/>
lives, or when their own lives actually seem to negate it, but the ignore <br/>
their own senses in favor of what someone else says which seems alluring <br/>
because that &quot;truth&quot; is more attractive than their own truth.  <br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;re taught here NOT to trust our non-existent instincts, too.<br/>
<br/>
I do believe that some people&#39;s premonitions are superior to some other <br/>
people&#39;s direct perceptions.   I think there are things that can be <br/>
communicated across miles which few to none can control, like people <br/>
&quot;knowing&quot; (fearing, and the fear becoming true) that a parent, child, or <br/>
close someone has died.    That doesn&#39;t mean I believe in seances with <br/>
knocking and table-lifting.  Some people can&#39;t tell the baby from the <br/>
bathwater, and they either accept ALL reports of sixth sense no matter how <br/>
bogus, or they reject every bit of it because in the Wizard of Oz the fortune <br/>
teller/wizard peeked in Dorothy&#39;s basket.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are VERY good at reading other people&#39;s subtle clues.  Some have <br/>
not one jot of that ability and so don&#39;t think anyone else does either.  <br/>
They&#39;ll sit there emanating all KINDS of messages in direct conflict with <br/>
their words and then demand that others believe what they&#39;re saying.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the idea that we choose our birth-body/family is wrong and dangerous. <br/>
 That doesn&#39;t have to mean I negate the possibility of reincarnation.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-576850289">Well, not really.  Scientist believe in the existence<br/>
of things that they cannot prove....like black holes<br/>
for instance.  Different branches of science also<br/>
disagree on whether some things are real or not and on<br/>
whether the evidence is factual proof.  Theories,<br/>
which make up much of what science is, are not proven.<br/>
 If they were, they would not be theories.  I find it<br/>
quite unfortunate and misleading that so many theories<br/>
are taught as fact.<br/>
<br/>
Science is just as much a &#39;religion&#39; based on<br/>
unprovable beliefs as other religions.  How science<br/>
got to be the decider of what is &#39;real&#39; is beyond me. <br/>
Reality is quite subjective depending upon one&#39;s<br/>
beliefs and we cannot prove OR disprove the<br/>
reliability of things such as astrology, gods, the<br/>
size of the universe, how it began, etc.  Which means,<br/>
simply, that we do not know.  <br/>

was called a &#39;law&#39; is in more recent times referred to as a &#39;theory&#39;. <br/>
Thus, we have the laws of physics and the laws of thermodynamics, but<br/>
the theories of evolution and of relativity.  This is simply a<br/>
convention, and an unfortunate one in my opinion.  It should not be<br/>
mistaken to mean that scientists hold relativity on any shakier ground<br/>
than gravity.<br/>
<br/>

&#39;decide&#39; anything.  People are free to decide if they agree with a<br/>
scientific conclusion, as you yourself demonstrate.  <br/>

However, you seem to have picked a pretty narrow pool of items that<br/>
science can&#39;t answer.  <br/>

know why something feels right. It just does. But I think there are subtle<br/>
physical clues they drew from.<br/>
<br/>
Which I think accounts for &quot;women&#39;s intuition&quot;. Women tend to be more<br/>
subconsciously aware of body language, inflection, word choice and all the<br/>
ways people communicate which gives some women a feel for things that aren&#39;t<br/>

exclude all men either.)<br/>

many feelings throughout our lives that something has happened and then<br/>
nothing happens so we we pass it off as normal worry. It&#39;s those rare<br/>
occasions when the feeling something has happened and something actually<br/>
happening purely by happenstance that we remember that we felt a<br/>
&quot;premonition&quot; and feel there must be a connection.<br/>

I hope I&#39;m wrong because that&#39;s not nearly as interesting ;-)<br/>

<br/>
What I&#39;ve read (and seen, yay Discovery channel) suggests women&#39;s intuition <br/>
is the result of additional pathways between the two brain hemispheres -- <br/>
that women have more processing power for picking up cues.  Testosterone <br/>
dissolves a noticeable percentage of those pathways as the fetus obtains its <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which I think is an unfortunate consequence of how science is taught in<br/>
school as a bunch of truths to be memorized. Perhaps it&#39;s also a consequence<br/>
of Western culture and religion where we are conditioned to believe there is<br/>
one right answer to each question. We aren&#39;t comfortable with shades of gray<br/>
and fuzziness. (Seems to me the Japanese were a lot more comfortable<br/>
embracing and exploring chaos theory when it was first described.)<br/>
<br/>
Science isn&#39;t about declaring something a truth. (Though I think what makes<br/>
scientists jump out of bed in the morning is the quest for ultimate truth!)<br/>
It&#39;s about identifying things that posess certain qualities. It&#39;s about<br/>
investigating things that behave in ways that can be predicted. (Atoms<br/>
behave in predictable ways. Light behaves in predictable ways. Anything that<br/>
we can say &quot;When we do this, then this (almost always!) happens.) And then<br/>
seeking to explain (theorize) why they behave that way. And then testing<br/>
those theories. And using those as building block to create more generalized<br/>
theories.<br/>
<br/>
If something can&#39;t be controlled or repeated then it isn&#39;t something that<br/>
can be scientifically investigated. To choose something more tangible than<br/>
the existence of souls or the sixth sense: we probably don&#39;t know nearly as<br/>
much about love as we do about the workings of quarks even though love is<br/>
pretty much universally accepted as existing and lots have people haven&#39;t<br/>
even heard of quarks. ;-) We can&#39;t reproduce love or scientifically control<br/>
it -- though undoubtedly some scientists have tried! -- so science can&#39;t<br/>
really say that much scientific about why we fall in love with who we do<br/>
other than it&#39;s chemistry!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a big difference between we don&#39;t know because we don&#39;t yet know<br/>
enough and we don&#39;t know because we can&#39;t investigate it. Scientists can<br/>
investigate the size of the universe, the weight of the atom, the chemistry<br/>
of the sun. A scientific theory must fit into the larger jigsaw puzzle of<br/>
what we understand. It can&#39;t just fit the part the scientist is<br/>
investigating (the size of the universe for example) and not fit in with<br/>
other theories and other data. For example, the explanation for the size of<br/>
the universe or existence of black holes can&#39;t violate the speed of light or<br/>
the weight of an electron or other things that are well known. If it does,<br/>
then the theory needs to expand to explain how those theories are<br/>
inadequate.<br/>
<br/>
Scientists can&#39;t investigate the sixth sense or gods or souls because they<br/>
can&#39;t be tested in the lab. That doesn&#39;t immediately make them untrue. But<br/>
it puts them in the category of belief rather than science. It doesn&#39;t make<br/>
the ideas inferior (except as parts of explainable, reproducible reality!).<br/>
It just makes them a different species of ideas.<br/>
