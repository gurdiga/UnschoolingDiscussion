<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904721894">I thought this was very cool. It&#39;s a map of recipe searches done at  <br/>
Thanksgiving and what states they&#39;re the most popular in:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/ykerqw4">http://tinyurl.com/ykerqw4</a><br/>
<br/>
(It&#39;s in the New York Times and you might have to register to see it.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s odd that cranberries sauce and relish recipes were more searched  <br/>
for outside of in New England where they&#39;re grown. (*I* looked a  <br/>
recipe up!) Though maybe we have cranberries for more months and  <br/>
they&#39;re only sold at Thanksgiving elsewhere? Not so odd is that sweet  <br/>
potato pie is pretty solidly in the South. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever  <br/>
had one.  And I would *hope* that people from Idaho were not  <br/>
searching for mashed potato recipes since I assume they must have  <br/>
picked up a zillion recipes for potatoes by osmosis! Peanut butter  <br/>
pie is very surprising, with a big swath horizontally across the US  <br/>
and up into Maine. Maine? Another pie I&#39;ve never had.<br/>
<br/>
We had 2 graduate students from Taiwan join us and there was much  <br/>
delight and joy from them ;-) even with my many short cuts, turkey  <br/>
breast, cranberry-orange relish, mashed potatoes (with the skins, I  <br/>
do *not* peal potatoes ;-), Pepperidge Farm stuffing, Heinz gravy and  <br/>
mixed berry pie with frozen berries and crust (geez, the crusts are  <br/>
practically indistinguishable from homemade now, though I did used to  <br/>
make whole wheat crusts which I saw as an ultimate challenge ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The biggest hit was that survivor from 50&#39;s: The Infamous Green Bean  <br/>
Casserole (with the mushroom soup and French&#39;s fried onions on  <br/>
top) ;-) They said it was very Chinese.<br/>

Casserole yesterday that made me chuckle, I do like GBC myself, sadly we <br/>
didn&#39;t have any with our feast yesterday.<br/>
