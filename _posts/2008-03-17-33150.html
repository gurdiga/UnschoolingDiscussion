We watched a movie a few weeks ago about Queen Elizabeth and Zachariah was dumbfounded as to why she was so limited in her choices - after all she was the queen and should be able to do anything she wanted!   We had a long discussion about how royalty and peers of the realm were very much limited in their lives.  - how few actually married for love, arranged marriages for dowries, property, politics and alliances, etc.<br/>

Presidents and prime ministers and governors, pretty much the same  <br/>
deal (though they do get vacations and ends of terms).<br/>
<br/>
Parents, too.  We get old enough to do whatever we want to do, and  <br/>
all things considered most of us decide we want to make dinner and do  <br/>
laundry!  What&#39;s up with that!? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
