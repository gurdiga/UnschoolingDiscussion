Actually, she knows that we could do it with adults involved. That&#39;s not <br/>
what she wants. In true Casey fashion, she wants to do the Trading Spaces <br/>

Trading Spaces would have their hands full if they did let Casey on. There <br/>
is NO way she would let some designer run the show. ;-) LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-75563548">Psssst, Casey.  Why don&#39;t you write the show and explain everything to them<br/>
AND then tell them that your parents would be happy to sign a release and<br/>
waiver &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The short Dixie Chick did that and now she will be on the show sometime this<br/>
month!<br/>

moving soon, hopefully, and I don&#39;t think it could be accomplished before we <br/>
go. And besides, what would be the point? Besides, I&#39;m still working on <br/>
helping her develop her neighborhood library system for the kids on the <br/>
block (complete with story time). And oh yeah, she figured out something <br/>
else to do instead. She wants to trade lives with one of her friends for a <br/>
day, a la &quot;A Walk In Your Shoes&quot; on Noggin.<br/>
