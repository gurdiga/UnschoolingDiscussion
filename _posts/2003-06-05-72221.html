<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t catch the beginning of this discussion, but I think I&#39;m<br/>
understanding what it&#39;s about.  I plan on picking up the book, but I just<br/>
want to say that I have two grown daughters whom I lavished praise on<br/>
when they were kids, but I was careful to not go to extremes since I<br/>
didn&#39;t want to raise megalomaniacs.  I think it&#39;s tough to go to<br/>
extremes, however, without some &quot;caution&quot; flag popping up in our heads.<br/>
By that I mean that, to me, extreme would be something like, &quot;You&#39;re<br/>
better than everyone else...prettier...smarter...&quot;, etc.; fill in the<br/>
superlative.  And I think praise should be treated like candy -- dole out<br/>
bits at a time and it&#39;s not so bad for you.  As with everything else in<br/>
life, I suppose, moderation seems to be the key.  I do believe that a<br/>
strong sense of self, of pride in one&#39;s accomplishments, should be<br/>
intrinsically motivated.  I think it&#39;s OK to say to a child, &quot;You can be<br/>
proud of yourself.&quot;  Even if we slip &lt;OMG!&gt; and say, &quot;I&#39;m proud of you,&quot;<br/>
in the long-run it&#39;s less harmful than, oh, let&#39;s say, &quot;You can&#39;t do<br/>
anything right!&quot; or, &quot;I wish you were never born.!&quot;  Children are<br/>
resilient; they overcome the most dreadful things.  The majority are<br/>
smart enough when they reach adulthood to realize that, no matter how<br/>
&quot;good&quot; they are, the world is not at their beckoned call.  They sort it<br/>
all out.<br/>
<br/>
I listened to some advice I picked up somewhere when the kids were small<br/>
which resulted in my saying things such as, &quot;I think I&#39;ll put that<br/>
picture on the fridge&quot;, rather than, &quot;What a great picture you drew.&quot; <br/>
It&#39;s not that there&#39;s really anything wrong with the latter statement;<br/>
it&#39;s just that, with the first, the child can deduce for him/herself<br/>
that, &quot;Hey, she likes what I drew.&quot;  This way, the child is &quot;rewarded&quot;<br/>
intrinsically although the praise was generated extrinsically.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line:  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any danger from this group to our<br/>
children&#39;s well-being.  We love them; they forgive us...<br/>

<br/>
This is interesting.  I&#39;ve never worried about reward or praise, whether I <br/>
was giving him too much or too little.  <br/>
<br/>
About art, for example,  I would tell him, *I* really like that because...and <br/>
then he would tell me what he did or didn&#39;t like about it, and that would <br/>
lead to good convos about composition, color, whatever. I think that really <br/>
helped him develop his own style, and realizing that there was stuff in there that <br/>
he didn&#39;t like, and sometimes I found value in it, that he didn&#39;t see. He&#39;d <br/>
still not like it and do something else next time that gave him satisfaction, <br/>
but still understand that there was nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with it, just not quite <br/>
right to him.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I never thought that there would be intrinisic value to something <br/>
because I, the Mom, liked it.  I really don&#39;t think that&#39;s an issue, am I being <br/>
naive? I really don&#39;t think that he&#39;s under the impression that my opinion is <br/>
more important than his, especially if it&#39;s his artwork! <br/>

You&#39;re new to this list, aren&#39;t you? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you dole it out bits at a time, it&#39;s not so good for you. <br/>
If you let the child decide how much she wants or needs (of candy, attention, <br/>
time, praise) you will probably find they choose a much smaller amount than <br/>
dire predictions would have named.<br/>
<br/>
Moderation isn&#39;t as useful a key as respect and freedom are, and <br/>
compassionate honesty and parental mindfulness go faster and farther than rules and <br/>
moderation ever could.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This post made me smile. Growing up I was an only child until I was nearly 9. <br/>
My father nicknamed me &quot;Best&quot; so long ago, I don&#39;t recall not having the <br/>
name. It&#39;s one of those parent-child nicknames you really don&#39;t want outsiders to <br/>
know about, because I was always questioned as to what exactly it was that I <br/>
was the &quot;Best&quot; at. I always answered the same thing every time. &quot;I am the best <br/>
at trying to do the best I can in everything I do.&quot; I remember asking my daddy <br/>
why he called me that and he said, &quot;you are the Bestest in the West and never <br/>
let anyone make you think less of yourself.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
At this point in my life I have severed my relationship with my father for <br/>
way too many reasons than any of you want to hear about, but I have to admit <br/>
that reading that post brought tears to my eyes. It reminded me of a simpler time <br/>
when my father was just daddy, not the pathetic human he became over the last <br/>
33 years. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think him nicknaming me that had any negative reprecussions, in fact <br/>
I think it instilled in me at an early age to think of myself as being able to <br/>
try my best without regard for failure or achievement. For it would never <br/>
matter whether the rest of the world thought I was the &quot;Best&quot;, but my parents <br/>
did.<br/>

there are children in the world (I know from counseling families of<br/>
abused/neglected children) who are not fortunate enough to &quot;avoid the<br/>

I suppose I can see saying &quot;they did the very best they could do&quot;  if I were looking back at parents years ago.

<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t see that as being an &quot;ouch&quot;.  The purpose of THIS group is to <br/>
&gt; discuss unschooling.... not &quot;well this works<br/>
&gt; for me&quot;.    :)   That&#39;s not conducive to the list and it&#39;s very <br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally understand and respect that this list is for unschooling, but the <br/>
response above was written to a woman who was discussing her own relationship <br/>
with her own child.  I am one who will say to my children, &quot;I&#39;m proud of you&quot; <br/>
when I am proud of them.  Unschooling is child-directed learning.  It is not a <br/>
&quot;method&quot; of parenting.  I would never consider overriding a &quot;heart&quot; response <br/>
to my child with something that I *should* say in order to somehow keep them <br/>
from becoming a manipulator.  Who would the manipulator be then?  I wrote &quot;ouch&quot; <br/>
because the woman&#39;s parenting was being called into question by someone who I <br/>
am most sure doesn&#39;t personally know the family.  That&#39;s all.   ~Kris<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265970350">I guess what I was trying to call into question was whether or not it is OK to say &quot;I&#39;m doing the best I can do&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
In regards to my children, I don&#39;t want to say that.  I know when I make mistakes with my children, I don&#39;t want have that in my mind because I want to improve on it.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess there are &quot;heart&quot; responses that I do want to suppress,  like laying guilt or shame on my kids.  These are easy things to say because it was the way I was raised.  I am now learning not to do that.  But I don&#39;t think that change would have come about if I had just said, &quot;I&#39;m doing the best I can do&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We might be talking about totally different things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I started unschooling, some parenting practices didn&#39;t quite jive in *my* mind.    I needed to change my thinking and the way I related to my kids.   As I did that, unschooling really started to make sense to me.<br/>

OK, Obviously all I&#39;ve been saying needs clarification, since I didn&#39;t<br/>
expect such hostility.  Yes, I am new to homeschooling, even newer to<br/>
unschooling, but I&#39;m not new to parenting.  My two grown daughters, who<br/>
were schooled in public schools, were classic underachievers, yet I feel<br/>
I did the &quot;very best&quot; I could for them given what I knew and had to work<br/>
with at the time.  While they are still struggling with career choices,<br/>
all in all, they are well-adjusted, confident young women who are also<br/>
parents.  They are also single parents.  If I say that they are doing the<br/>
&quot;very best they can,&quot; I mean that, given the enormity of their<br/>
responsibilities, it can&#39;t be &quot;better&quot; at the moment even though &quot;better&quot;<br/>
is the ideal for my grandkids and for all kids.<br/>
<br/>
When I mention not worrying about every move we make, I am talking about<br/>
extreme positions and I&#39;m speaking literally, such as it&#39;s impossible to<br/>
monitor everything that comes out of our mouths, and how can we expect<br/>
&quot;perfection&quot; in an imperfect world?  When I initially responded to<br/>
someone&#39;s mentioning the book about punishing kids through rewards, I<br/>
never said I agreed that we in fact do punish our kids everytime we<br/>
reward them.  I&#39;ve said, &quot;I&#39;m proud of you&quot; to my kids countless times. <br/>
It&#39;s just that every so often I tell them they can be proud of<br/>
themselves.  What&#39;s the problem here?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m guilty of having old-fashioned notions about parenting, but I<br/>
think that the number one priority should be to show our kids love and to<br/>
model loving relationships with our partners, families, etc.  Is this all<br/>
I think we have to do and let the pieces fall where they may?  Absolutely<br/>
not.  I think we have to have a plan, think before we speak when<br/>
possible, model the behaviors we want to instill in our kids.  My point<br/>
in all of this is only to say that we will make mistakes, but even that<br/>
teaches our children, in my opinion, lessons about fallibility and human<br/>
vulnerabilites and says, &quot;Hey, it&#39;s okay to screw up sometimes!&quot;  What is<br/>
it we model for our kids when we react to others&#39; points of view -- not<br/>
with tolerance -- but with such blatant hostility??<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It really is an unschooling discussion, and that makes some pretty profound <br/>
differences.<br/>
Reading at www.unschooling.com would be a good idea for a more rounded <br/>
picture.  The topics stay there, whereas these flow and change and get silly.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You used &quot;hostility&quot; twice in that post, but it&#39;s not hostile to defend a <br/>
belief.   <br/>
<br/>
My children aren&#39;t on this list.   We&#39;re discussing unschooling here with <br/>
people who are here of their own free will and can choose whether to post or not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You&#39;re new to this list, aren&#39;t you? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Yes, and I&#39;m hopeful that this list (as is the case with others I belong<br/>
to) will in part serve as a forum for the expression of opinions,<br/>
thoughts and ideas and that, whether or not anyone agrees, there is<br/>
agreement about welcoming and respecting others&#39; points of view.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Did you read the intro at yahoogroups, and did you get an <br/>
introductory/welcome letter?<br/>
<br/>
Probably most of us belong to other lists.  They all have their own purposes <br/>
and flavors, tones and rules.   If you posted without reading for very long, <br/>
and your post was recommending wht could be potentially a step back for new <br/>
unschoolers, it wasn&#39;t in keeping with the purpose of the list.  That&#39;s no big <br/>
deal.  But it&#39;s not hostility that people said the advice was too mainstream or <br/>
lacked an awareness of the respect for kids&#39; choices and sensitivities that <br/>
unschoolers so often come to care about.<br/>

What Sandra and I and whomever else wrote wasn&#39;t meant to be hostile.  It <br/>
was frank, sure.  It was calling societally-traditional thought patterns on <br/>
their lack of effectiveness, absolutely.  It was challenging what seem to <br/>
be your assumptions, definitely.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re really new here and that&#39;s okay, but it has it&#39;s pitfalls, one of <br/>
which is discovering that there&#39;s still something to learn about <br/>
unschooling and its effect on other areas of parenting and &#39;control&#39; <br/>
issues.  What I&#39;d recommend for a while is settling back to read so you get <br/>
the tenor of the place, maybe hit the archives for subjects that interest <br/>
you and wait to post until you won&#39;t get offended by someone challenging <br/>
what you think.  This is also not said in a hostile manner.  ...think of us <br/>
as kindly, perhaps crotchety aunties who&#39;re not afraid to speak up.<br/>

as though I&#39;m in shark-infested waters.  I never thought unschooling<br/>
meant blatant permissiveness.  Kids are growing up to face a world that<br/>
isnt&#39; always going to treat them with the same &quot;kindness&quot; as their<br/>
parents.  How are they supposed to learn to deal if they&#39;ve grown up to<br/>
expect the same fairness their loving parents extended to them, the same<br/>
degree of freedom, etc.  We don&#39;t live in a Utopian society.  Employers<br/>
are not going to be as gentle to our kids as we&#39;ve been to them.  Reality<br/>
is reality.  Idealism is another thing.<br/>

rewards/praise that really punishes them.<br/>
<br/>
Genuine praise and congratulations and acknowledgment of achievement or <br/>
hard work - the same kind of response we&#39;d have to a friend or a <br/>
husband, is different.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter went to kindergarten. I worked in the classroom. <br/>
During the first few days of school I was handed a roll of stickers - <br/>
little red dots - and told to wander around the room and stick on dot <br/>
on the child&#39;s nametag (a name card that was taped to their desk) <br/>
whenever I noticed a child was &quot;on task.&quot; At the end of the day the kid <br/>
with the most dots would get a prize.<br/>
<br/>
It is THIS kind of manipulation that is clearly counterproductive.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Well, I guess I took a wrong turn when I subscribed to this list.  I feel<br/>
as though I&#39;m in shark-infested waters.  I never thought unschooling<br/>
meant blatant permissiveness.  Kids are growing up to face a world that<br/>
isnt&#39; always going to treat them with the same &quot;kindness&quot; as their<br/>
parents.  How are they supposed to learn to deal if they&#39;ve grown up to<br/>
expect the same fairness their loving parents extended to them, the same<br/>
degree of freedom, etc.  We don&#39;t live in a Utopian society.  Employers<br/>
are not going to be as gentle to our kids as we&#39;ve been to them.  Reality<br/>
is reality.  Idealism is another thing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wow. So what are you saying? That we should be tough restrictive parents<br/>
just so our kids will &quot;learn a lesson&quot; for the real world?? Not to be kind<br/>
and respectful to our children because they will eventually run into others<br/>
that won&#39;t?<br/>
Do you honestly think that our children at a young age will be equipped the<br/>
same in their ability to handle things when they have to be out working? At<br/>
what age should we start to toughen them up? Sounds like that&#39;s what you<br/>
think. Say it isn&#39;t so!<br/>

homepage and welcome letter said:<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a &quot;feel&quot; <br/>
for the list and its members, since many listmembers love a lively <br/>
debate and questioning beliefs to their foundations.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>

this is a group of people with strong beliefs and convictions.  That <br/>

examples of the respectful parenting we talk about, not just a quick <br/>
judgement on your part as to what unschooling is.  I struggle often <br/>
with the parenting side of unschooling.  I can easily let go of <br/>
academics and trust my daughter.  It is much harder to let go of <br/>
other parenting issues that I had been clinging to because I had <br/>
never heard of a better way.  My whole vision of the type of <br/>
parenting supported here was kids running wild and walking all over <br/>
their parents.  (Since that is all I have ever seen in families where <br/>
they don&#39;t spank, breastfeed until child weaning, etc.)  I had never <br/>
seen examples of it done out of true respect for the child in an <br/>
EQUALS situation.  It is not about lifting the child on a pedestal.  <br/>
But it is also not about lording over a child.  It is about living <br/>
life side by side with your child.  (At least that is what I am <br/>
figuring out.)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t about blatant permissiveness though I can see how you would take it that way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on here a few months and I&#39;ve found that after awhile (a good while), I see bits and pieces of information that make me understand that the parents on this list are anything BUT permissive.  We are intricately involved with their kids to such a degree that permissiveness vs rules/consequences is not even really an issue.<br/>
<br/>
They *do* provide guidance, advice, and a safety net for their kids.  <br/>
<br/>
The reason you are not seeing that right now is because you are new. <br/>
And there are others who are new too, that may not have posted.<br/>
<br/>
If there is *anything* in your post that might be misunderstood by another new person here, it will get challenged.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for that is to help people unschool, and by default, come to understand what &quot;mindful parenting&quot; is.<br/>

Thats how *I* was raised, and you know what?  It took until I am almost 40 to realize that I don&#39;t *have* to put up with that garbage! <br/>
<br/>
It is so liberating to be free of that and know that you *don&#39;t* have to put up with it from *anyone*.<br/>

When we all *expect* the best for ourselves, we will also treat others with the same respect.  When that happens, the world will be a MUCH better place!<br/>

&gt; OMG, it for sure isn&#39;t so!  OK, I believe we should be kind and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>respectful to our kids.  Condescension toward anyone, young or old, is<br/>
wrong.  For some reason here, I&#39;m unable to get through to this group. <br/>
I&#39;m agreeing with 99.9% of everything you&#39;ve said.  It&#39;s not about<br/>
&quot;toughening them up&quot; so much as it is preparing them.  But come on,<br/>
surviving requires some degree of  &quot;toughening up.&quot;  But I define &quot;tough&quot;<br/>
more as being able to deal (or learning to deal) with some of the<br/>
not-so-gentle things life sometimes hands us.  What is the harm in a<br/>
child learning that others won&#39;t always treat him/her with the same<br/>
respect and kindness his/her parents did.  Huh?  I mean, I can look at my<br/>
girls and see products of the kindness, respect, love that was given<br/>
them, but I can also see that they have the *hutzpah* to deal with the<br/>
crap.  I&#39;ll repeat:  I&#39;m on your side; that&#39;s why I&#39;m exploring new ideas<br/>
in homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
OK, I&#39;ll try to sit back and &quot;listen&quot; for awhile, but damn!  It&#39;s hard<br/>
for me to not put my two cents in.  And I&#39;ll admit that it&#39;s gotten me in<br/>
trouble in the past.  My intention certainly is not to insult anyone nor<br/>
to dismiss the nature of unschooling.  I&#39;m here to learn...<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;Well, I guess I took a wrong turn when I subscribed to this list.  I feel<br/>
&gt; as though I&#39;m in shark-infested waters. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No wonder I like it here!! My totem is the dolphin so no wonder I feel <br/>
perfectly safe in these shark infested waters.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I never thought unschooling &gt; meant blatant permissiveness.<br/>
<br/>
Common misconception, but exactly that, a misconception.<br/>
<br/>
  Kids are growing up to face a world that isnt&#39; always going to treat them <br/>
with the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; same &quot;kindness&quot; as their parents. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How sad is that? I would never teach my children to be unkind because that is <br/>
the way of the world. Then again we live by the Universal Law = what you put <br/>
out, you get back.<br/>
<br/>
 How are they supposed to learn to deal if they&#39;ve grown up to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; expect the same fairness their loving parents extended to them, the same<br/>
&gt; degree of freedom, etc.  We don&#39;t live in a Utopian society.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe if everyone unschooled, we could live in Utopia. That would be <br/>
wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
  Employers &gt; are not going to be as gentle to our kids as we&#39;ve been to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; them.  Reality<br/>
&gt; is reality.  Idealism is another thing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Idealy my children will respect themselves so much that to tolerate <br/>
 </span></blockquote>disrespect by any fellow human, would go against every cell of their being. And should <br/>
they be unfortunate enough to not be able to find a respectful employer, I <br/>
have no doubt that they will work for themselves, doing whatever it is they love <br/>
to do, because they want to be happy and enjoy this life, this time around.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who hopes to be a dolphin in her next life if and only if she has to <br/>
come back here. (Don&#39;t I just floor you with weirdness sometimes?)<br/>
