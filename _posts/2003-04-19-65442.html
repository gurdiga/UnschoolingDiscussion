I think The Dance of Anger by Harriet Lerner might really help. It&#39;s been a while since I read it but has some situations similar to yours- how to stay strong but avoid burning bridges. How to say what you need to say, realizing you can&#39;t control the other person&#39;s reaction. And of course setting limits, so simple yet so dificult. <br/>
Am behind in reading but hope this still makes sense. Good luck.<br/>
