&lt;&lt; I had a <br/>
huge &quot;ah-ha!&quot; moment, and took the leap of faith.  The difference <br/>
from then to now is so immense, that I now understand why unschoolers <br/>
want to make it clear, just what unschooling is.  Everytime you &quot;slip <br/>
back&quot; and require learning from you children, you destroy the trust <br/>
that was building up in them.  The trust that you believe in them.  <br/>
The trust that they are smart enough to figure it out on their own.  <br/>
The trust that you belive that their interests and ideas are whats <br/>
right for them.  When I relized that simple truth, I decided never <br/>
to &quot;slip&quot; again, no matter how fearful I became.  I haven&#39;t.  I now <br/>
see the tremendous difference it has made in all our lives.  What the <br/>
trust really does for my children.  It&#39;s a lot of work, this letting <br/>
go of old mentalities.  I&#39;m still working.  <br/>
I&#39;m writing this to try to help explain the difference in attitude, <br/>
and why so many say, &quot;that&#39;s not unschooling&quot;.  I hope I made a <br/>
little sense. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Joanna, I&#39;m so glad you wrote this.  I&#39;ve been around dozens of other <br/>
people&#39;s AH HA moments and they are So valuable to their families and to <br/>
those reading their experiences that I can&#39;t let go of the knowledge that <br/>
continuing discussions like these changes people&#39;s lives.  <br/>
<br/>
Over the years some of the others on this list and I have seen people change <br/>
their minds about spanking, and about TV, and about using math worksheets, <br/>
and other particular things which were causing unhappiness in their families <br/>
or stress between them and their kids.  How did we know?  They told us.  They <br/>
came and said &quot;Things are stressful at our house and unschooling isn&#39;t <br/>
working as well as we&#39;d like it to...&quot; and they laid out their factors.  Or <br/>
they came to argue against a discussion and stayed to be converted.<br/>
<br/>
But if none of us stay to help newcomers or to help untangle situations in <br/>
which one parent is about to say, &quot;ENOUGH, School!&quot; unless things change <br/>
profoundly and quickly, then there isn&#39;t a centrally-located easily found <br/>
resource for unschooling information.<br/>
<br/>
And if the information here is diluted or polluted by non-unschooling advice <br/>
in sufficient measure, then people will still not see unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Again, Joyce was able to make a great, clear analogy:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If people want to be *pure unschoolers* -- not just be more relaxed<br/>
homeschoolers -- then they need to see real unadulterated unschooling in<br/>
action. It&#39;s *scary* to get away from the well traveled shore. We&#39;re trying<br/>
to show how people do navigate successfully without relying on the shoreline<br/>
at all. &gt;&gt;<br/>
