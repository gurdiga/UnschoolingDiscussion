&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wish you would send it so it could be put on a website even if HEM<br/>
&gt;publishes it.   Dan Vilter is thinking about doing a webpage with notes and<br/>
&gt;links, and if he ends up deciding against that I&#39;ll do it myself!<br/>

we&#39;ll want to run a sidebar on relevant resources!<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone done anything along these lines for unschooling and <br/>
movies? Our kids swear they were &quot;movieschooled&quot; as much as <br/>
unschooled... &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I had an edited chat in the library at AOL about movies once, I think.  Or <br/>
maybe it was chats on particular movies.  Maybe that was it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to write about movies but if someone else does it first that&#39;s fine.<br/>
