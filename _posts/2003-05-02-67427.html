&lt;&lt; Oh I have the same thoughts about Easter Egg Hunts.  I always HATED when <br/>
we went to community egg hunts.  so we started having our own and we set it <br/>
up so each kid would be a winner. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Since the kids were little we had one tradition which stuck, no matter what <br/>
else.  This is the first year we didn&#39;t do eggs (my leg was hurting and kids <br/>
were older and had company coming over).  But last year, even though the <br/>
youngest was ten, they reminded me.<br/>
<br/>
We put out plastic eggs with coins in them, either exclusively or with other <br/>
things.  But SOME eggs had a paper dollar.  Instead of having it be a <br/>
scramble, of those we made as many as there were kids, and hid them all in <br/>
the same place.  Often in a basket or nest-like thing (or one year, an old <br/>
bird&#39;s nest that had blown down).  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone came to where there was more than one egg in one place, they only <br/>
took one.  The kid who found that last might not know that was &quot;the prize <br/>
egg&quot; but at that point it didn&#39;t matter, they&#39;d only get one.<br/>
