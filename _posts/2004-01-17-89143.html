<div id="ygrps-yiv-76646958">We did math at the Dr.&#39;s office.  (please bare with me as I am not a full<br/>
time unschooler yet)  <br/>
<br/>
We were on the fifth floor and my son looks down.  He asks how high we are. <br/>
I tell him 5 stories. He ask me how many feet. I tell him about 10 feet per<br/>
floor would make it around 50 feet.  THAN he asked how many inches that<br/>
would be. I tell him there are 12 inches in a foot, and we are 50 feet up.<br/>
What could we do?<br/>
<br/>
I just a moment he said 12 x 50 !!<br/>
<br/>
Now he didn&#39;t figure out the answer until we got home and I put it on paper<br/>
for him, but HE did figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
I was so proud :D.<br/>
<br/>
We have not learned the multiplication table but he wants to learn to<br/>
multiply (since first grade) and totally understands the concept and can do<br/>
simple multiplication. Although I have not &#39;drilled&#39; multiplying. <br/>
<br/>
Ok.. sorry I had to brag about our &#39;unschool moment&#39; today..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>12 times 50 is just 10 times 50 plus 2 times 50. That&#39;s easy to do in <br/>
your head. 10 times 50 is 500. 2 X 50 is another 100 so the total is <br/>
600.<br/>
<br/>
You might help him think of it this way so he doesn&#39;t have to wait to <br/>
find paper and pencil next time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-656511571">Kirby came looking for a calculator, or help, with the new Final Fantasy <br/>
game.  He said &quot;What is 640 times 99?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said it&#39;s 100 times 640,  minus 640, one for each of the hundreds.   He <br/>
understood that, but I pulled up the calculator on the mac and gave him the <br/>
answer before he did that calculation, which is fine.   He needed it to figure out <br/>
how rich he was going to be figuring out that he could sell some stuff back to <br/>
the same guy he&#39;d bought it from, or something.   He asked if there was a <br/>
loose calculator he could take back in there, and there was one here Holly had <br/>
been using.  I kept hearing him hoot happily and was going in to see what was <br/>
going on.  He was on a ship, buying stuff on one side and selling it back for <br/>
more on the other.  And all the things he had bought for 99 whatevers each, he&#39;d <br/>
found a place buying them for 125.  I asked him if he NEEDED money in the <br/>
game.  He didn&#39;t know, he was just having fun racking up those units of whatever <br/>
and laughing about it.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s had a long week, and this was the first time he&#39;s been without company <br/>
or a deadline or someone expecting him to pick them up or do something for <br/>
several days.  It&#39;s nice to see him  ...  I started to say &quot;relaxing&quot; but he&#39;s not <br/>
relaxing.  He&#39;s engrossed in something that&#39;s just fun.<br/>
<br/>
Now Marty&#39;s in there talking to him.   They&#39;re finally quieting down.<br/>
<br/>
Holly went to sleep about 1:00 a.m. (it&#39;s 1:49 and I should&#39;ve gone to bed, <br/>
but I cleaned up the kitchen instead) with her new baby rat in its cage on the <br/>
bed next to her (she has our old queensize so it&#39;s not as crowded as it might <br/>
sound).  She&#39;s afraid the baby&#39;s missing its mom, and it could be true.  We&#39;ve <br/>
been letting it suck milk off soaked bread crusts several times a day.    On <br/>
the Simpsons once there was rat&#39;s milk, but we only have cow&#39;s milk.   We put <br/>
some rice in one of Holly&#39;s socks, tied it off and heated it up to put on top <br/>
of the rat&#39;s kleenex box sleeping cave, but she came up and lay down on top of <br/>
the warm rice and looked VERY comfortable.   <br/>
<br/>
That wasn&#39;t about math.  That was just a peaceful thing happening upstairs <br/>
from where Kirby and Marty are discussing various games&#39; money and points and <br/>
other imaginary economic issues.<br/>

I&#39;m going to go and read some more irritating Jane Austen and fall asleep <br/>

irritates you? LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Those books drive me crazy too, and my daughter too. <br/>
We yell at the PBS shows&#39; characters as well, telling<br/>
them to just TALK to each other honestly.  <br/>
<br/>
One of Sarah&#39;s favorite &quot;insults&quot; to hurl at someone<br/>
is to call them &quot;a Mr. Darcy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
And yet we still watch them.  I think it has to be<br/>
that we enjoy the verbal sparring that goes on, as<br/>
people in our family are quite quick-witted and enjoy<br/>
playing on each other&#39;s words.  <br/>
<br/>
Not in the mean-spirited way it can be done in<br/>
Austen&#39;s works, though.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Just curious, Sandra...why do you read it if it<br/>
irritates you? LOL! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because I watched all the commentary tracks on Emma Thompson&#39;s movie version <br/>
of Sense and Sensibility, and I want to read the book so I&#39;ll understand some <br/>
of the things they talked about.   <br/>
<br/>
The sentence structure is a little like (for me) hearing someone clip their <br/>
nails.  Painful sometimes.  So I don&#39;t read too much at a stretch. &lt;g&gt;  But <br/>
being halfway through, I&#39;d like to finish it. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And yet we still watch them.  I think it has to be<br/>
that we enjoy the verbal sparring that goes on, as<br/>
people in our family are quite quick-witted and enjoy<br/>
playing on each other&#39;s words.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to see how they decided what lines to leave in whole and <br/>
which long speeches to cut short.  People can do a LOT with posture and a look <br/>
and a tone of voice (and now having seen some of the scenes in the book and then <br/>
acted, my respect for Alan Rickman has increased tenfold--he nailed that <br/>
character) so they don&#39;t need all that convoluted verbiage.   <br/>
<br/>
I was watching it in Spanish, and the voice actress who did &quot;Mrs. Dashwood&quot; <br/>
their sister in law is a hoot in Spanish.   REALLY mean but funnier than the <br/>
English vocals.<br/>
