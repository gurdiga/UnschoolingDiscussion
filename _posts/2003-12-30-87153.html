<div id="ygrps-yiv-891497528">I took my kids to museums after we started to deschool and just as <br/>
you said I went into teacher mode they went into shut down mode.. <br/>
Our first real experience as unschooling folks came several weeks <br/>
ago. We rescued a puppy who was full of mange. We took her to the <br/>
vet on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. The kids were asking <br/>
questions like crazy. Then the vets assistant took us in the back to <br/>
show us all the animals that had been rescued. Like the mini horse <br/>
who had its ears chewed off by dogs.. YIKES we saw the stitch marks <br/>
and everything. THen there was a cat that someone had dropped <br/>
something heavy on its head.. It looked like a cartoon cat with its <br/>
eyes bulging, but way not funny. We left with a mange free pup and a <br/>
rat.. We like rats.. Then we were only 15 miles till the Blackfeet <br/>
Museum. I suggested we go on. Everyone agreed and we arrived in <br/>
bitter wind at exactly the time it was due to open. But it didn&#39;t. <br/>
There is a thing called indian time. Not meant as a racial slur it <br/>
is just culturally looser. We sat for about a half an hour.. Only <br/>
van in the lot.. I finally called and the lady was very appoligetic. <br/>
She forgot to open the door. I first time ever did not direct. I <br/>
looked. We were the only ones in the museum and everyone I think was <br/>
a bit gun shy of teacher mom.. However we looked.. I got to look at <br/>
stuff I was interested in. We watched the slide show and 40 minutes <br/>
later we were back on our way home.. Rat, Dog and six kids.. having <br/>
experienced whatever we wanted to in the adventure..It was a good <br/>
day!<br/>

tried to read all the explanations to them. Of course they weren&#39;t <br/>
interested. With Lars, I finally realized that all that hands-on stuff was <br/>
just going to stay somewhere in his head until he happened to run across <br/>

My kids LOVE the traveling exhibits.  There are things to mess with and move <br/>
and jump on.  And same way, I hardly ever tell them anything, unless I come <br/>
across something interesting I would also have dragged an adult friend over to <br/>
see.  Same way, same motivation, I want to say &quot;OOOH LOOK!&quot; about a baby <br/>
mastadon found in a tar pit, or whatever it is.<br/>
<br/>
I would never have been able to count the times that later they&#39;ve said, &quot;Oh <br/>
yeah!  Like that hockey armor thing,&quot; or &quot;Like at the museum, the &#39;jump like a <br/>
cat&#39; thing,&quot; and so forth.<br/>

It&#39;s not the museum per se, but when we were deschooling there&#39;s no way you could have gotten my boys to set foot inside a museum, or any other &#39;field trip&#39; type place.  Going there would mean they were supposed to LEARN, and LEARNING IS BORING!  That would be like GOING TO SCHOOL!  <br/>
<br/>
School can really do a number on a kid&#39;s mind.  It was quite a while before my  boys wanted to do anything like a museum.  Even the suggestion of something like that brought on a look of glassy-eyed despair.  <br/>
<br/>
Now going to a museum or a zoo or a play is a pretty cool thing to do!  <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Even though I&#39;m outside of DC where the museums are free and wonderful, I <br/>
really miss the Albuquerque zoo, Aquarium and Natural History Museum! <br/>
Albuquerque&#39;s museums are newer and so much more geared towards kids than <br/>
these stuffy, old Smithsonian museums. The newer exhibits here are getting <br/>
better. I also miss not fighting the crowds. We used to bring a bag lunch <br/>
and just sit at the final exhibit in the aquarium--the one with the <br/>
turtles. &lt;Sigh&gt; I miss that.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have grown up going to museums, libraries, lots of places. My <br/>
little ones think they&#39;re just as much fun as the zoo; nothing boring about <br/>
them. But, that&#39;s the advantage of never having them ruined by school. <br/>
(&quot;Them&quot;--the museums or the kids? Nah, kids could never be ruined.)<br/>

&lt;&lt;  We used to bring a bag lunch <br/>

<br/>
They have a butterfly pavillion now too.  Not as glorious as the one north of <br/>
Denver, but pretty glorious for Albuquerque.<br/>
<br/>
That is one fine aquarium, the one you&#39;re talking about.   Tiny, yet grand.<br/>
And though people on the gulf coast would probably see it as something that <br/>
should be at a salvage yard, we have a shrimp boat.  When the aquarium first <br/>
opened they planned to show the Rio Grande along its way, so there&#39;s a shrimp <br/>
boat from Texas.  It&#39;s floating in a little puddle (which they have to keep <br/>
filling all the time).   The first shrimp boat ever in Albuquerque. &lt;bwg&gt;  And <br/>
they got it about the time Forrest Gump came out so EVERYBODY knew what it was, <br/>
and had just seen one in operation.    Good tie-in for unschoolers (and <br/>
everybody else).<br/>
<br/>
The new children&#39;s museum has finally opened here.  After three or four d<br/>
ifferent temporary locations over the years, it&#39;s in its own building.  &quot;Explora.&quot; <br/>
  It&#39;s right across from the state science museum, which is right across from <br/>
the city&#39;s museum of history and art.  All just east of Rio Grande Blvd., on <br/>
Mountain Road, for people who might be passing through Albuquerque on I-40 and <br/>
need something to do with the kids for a bit.  And the city park right across <br/>
from any of those has brand new equipment, set up in a circle like a big <br/>
obstacle course, and you can get around without touching the ground if you&#39;re <br/>
short enough and you don&#39;t have to let go.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going Friday.<br/>

This reminded me of a trip I took with my sister to visit our dad in LA.  We <br/>
were entering southern California through the San Bernadino valley, and passed <br/>
a sign for Rancho Cucamonga.  What a great name.  We were giddy and a little <br/>
nervous about seeing Dad after so long, and got to giggling.  I&#39;d heard of it <br/>
before, but it really struck us as funny, and as we played with it, we <br/>
imagined a caveman coming home to his hairy honey after a long day at the La Brea tar <br/>
pits and grunting, *Ugh.  I huntamonga.  You Cucamonga.  Ugh.*  <br/>
<br/>
Ugh.<br/>

They sound more like Elven than Orcish, linguistically speaking.  <br/>
Maybe scatological, but not percussive.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a pretty-sounding Spanish-language name here.  There are two places <br/>
in New Mexico named &quot;Arroyo Seco.&quot;  Gosh it sounds musical, and poetic.<br/>
<br/>
Means &quot;Dry Gulch,&quot; but sounds MUCH better in Spanish.<br/>

It&#39;s fun to live in Albuquerque because people can&#39;t spell it, and I think <br/>
that&#39;s fun.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so easily amused sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  And some people can almost spell it but they think it&#39;s in Arizona, and <br/>
that might be because one year Rand McNally did a big official US map and <br/>
reversed the labels on Arizona and New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Ooops.  But anyone who learned their geography off that map is pretty sure <br/>
Phoenix is in New Mexico and Albuquerque is in Arizona, and that happens too <br/>
often.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-374906668">About 7 years the &quot;Jewels of the Romanovs&quot; exhibit came to our local <br/>
art museum.  The kids (then about 11, 8, 6 and 2 yo) and I stood in <br/>
line for three hours to get in.  <br/>
<br/>
When we finally got in to the exhibit, it was shoulder to shoulder.  <br/>
I tried so hard to read all the signs just to myself since I had <br/>
never known a lot of the information about the family that they had <br/>
posted.  I thought the kids would just look at the incredibly <br/>
beautiful stuff but they kept running off and I had to follow or they <br/>
would be swallowed by the crowd.  I only got to read two signs.  <br/>
<br/>
I learned that night that it&#39;s okay to go to the museum by myself <br/>
even for once in a lifetime exhibit.<br/>
