<div id="ygrps-yiv-686953924">Hi all, <br/>
<br/>
Ds is 16 and Certified PADI and I would love to hook him up with a diving family/individual on the East coast.<br/>
DH and I are also certified, but it is not something that we can up and do very often, especially with 2 younger siblings in the house.  I have considered the local shops and making contacts there, but wanted to try this resource first.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
