<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442991041">I am a die-hard unschooler.  But the day before public school started<br/>
in September 2002, my daughter decided she wanted to go. Just like<br/>
that, an announcement.  So as I always do, I said  &quot;fine&quot;.  I had no<br/>
idea that  she would still want to go in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
I do not care about &quot;homework&quot; or &quot;what teachers think&quot;.  I do not feel<br/>
any pressure from the school  because I do not to take this stuff<br/>
seriously. I do not see every mark on the paper, good or bad,as a<br/>
reflection on me or my child. .  My daughter does not got exited over<br/>
100%&#39;s  or getting things wrong.  She reports that to me in a matter of<br/>
factly or not at all.<br/>
<br/>
If she wants to quit, she knows she can. If she wanted to see how a<br/>
farm works, I would arrange for a farm stay, I don&#39;t see this as any<br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
We take days off to go skiing and such.  My homeschooling friends think<br/>
that is so amazing that the school &quot;allows&quot;  that to happen.  But I<br/>
would never think to ask permission.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, she was 7 yrs and 2 months  old when she started 1st grade<br/>
in September.  She could not read at all or add or count very high.  I<br/>
honestly believe that trying to learn something before it is time will<br/>
backfire.  She finds it all easy now and I&#39;m sure it is because we<br/>
didn&#39;t push and do not get excited one way or another.<br/>
<br/>
I &#39;m not comfortabe with the word unschooler. I&#39;m thinking  &quot;NO<br/>
schooler&quot;  although that doesn&#39;t satisfy me either.  I don&#39;t like my<br/>
identity to be any kind of schooler.  When I was little, my mother<br/>
didn&#39;t say &quot;we&#39;re schoolers&quot; or &quot;we&#39;re public-schoolers&quot; or &quot;we&#39;re<br/>
private-schoolers&quot;. Actually she never used the &quot;we&quot; the way people use<br/>
it now.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s interesting for the mom to identify as an unschooler and for the child <br/>
to have gone to school day 1 of first grade.  <br/>
<br/>
The analogy of visiting a farm is interesting, but she seems to have gone to <br/>
live at the farm.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What if a soccer mom wrote and said she was a serious soccer mom but her <br/>
children didn&#39;t play soccer?  <br/>
<br/>
I can understand the philosophical basis, but there really is a disconnect if <br/>
a person&#39;s kid is in school!  Aleksi, do you have other school age children <br/>
not in school?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;By the way, she was 7 yrs and 2 months  old when she started 1st grade<br/>
in September.&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
She had been homeschooled for a couple of years and wanted to try first grade?<br/>
Really interesting!<br/>
<br/>
I assumed my second kid, Marty, would have wanted to go to school.  He never <br/>
did go.<br/>
