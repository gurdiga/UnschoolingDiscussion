<div id="ygrps-yiv-250278724">Hi all!!!!<br/>
   I don&#39;t post often but just wanted to say how extemely grateful I <br/>
am for this group. It seems no sooner I have a thought or question to <br/>
ask, someone has beat me to the keyboard. <br/>
   I must admit I do have trouble keeping up with the large volume of <br/>
posts, however, I do admire and envy those who do and keep the list <br/>
VERY ALIVE!!!<br/>
   I just began looking into the South Carolina conference for this <br/>
year and sure enough there was my question and many answers!! As I <br/>
stated I am usually behind on this list so please forgive me if this <br/>
question has already been asked or answered. Have any of the children <br/>
who attended last year&#39;s conference written about it from a child&#39;s <br/>
point of view?? If so, could anyone direct to where I might find <br/>
these writings OR if not, maybe someone could ask their children if <br/>
they would be interested in doing so. We DO plan on attending this <br/>
year and my daughter who is 11 years old has asked for some input <br/>
from the unschooled CHILD not PARENT. She definitly wants to go, she <br/>
just likes to know what to expect. She has ALWAYS been one to <br/>
investigate things VERY THOROUGHLY!!! Our other children are just <br/>
glad to take a vacation no questions asked LOL!!!! I appreciate any <br/>
input.<br/>
   Have a WONDERFUL day,<br/>
         Kimberly</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064029924">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
New to this post.  I have seen reference to a conference in S.C.  Can someone <br/>
explain the details of this conference.  I feel like I picked up in the <br/>
middle of a conversation where everyone knows the story but me.  Thanks.<br/>

There was one testimonial on the website&#39;s &quot;Testaimonial Page&quot; by Jacob <br/>
Ohman.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be a few here who will ask their kids to respond. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to hear it too! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

It&#39;s a gathering of ONLY unschoolers: veterans, newbies, and wannabees. Last <br/>
year we had almost 200 from ALL over the country---from as far away as AZ, <br/>
MA, NY, UT, OH. This year, I&#39;m expecting Brenda to make it all the way from <br/>
Germany!!! <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a fun-filled, joyful weekend for the whole family. This year we have <br/>
master story-teller Jim Weiss (for a performance and funshops) and some other <br/>
really cool hands-on funshops that aren&#39;t yet confirmed, but that look GREAT! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our presenters this year are: Sandra Dodd (our keynote speaker) with Pam <br/>
Sorooshian, Anne Ohman, and Mary (Zenmomma) Life is Good Gold. <br/>
<br/>
There will be plenty of time to socialize (!) and (for husbands) to get to <br/>
see unschoolers in action. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
This is NOT a curriculum fair---although we will have some cool vendors. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a raffle to help fund the Sam Wilkinson Scholarship Program (thanks, <br/>
Joanna!), so that no one will be turned away for lack of funds. We had some <br/>
neat items last year, but THIS year should be spectacular!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;ll be able to join us, Joy! There&#39;s nothing else quite like it <br/>
anywhere!<br/>
