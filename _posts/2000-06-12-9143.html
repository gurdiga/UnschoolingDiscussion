<div id="ygrps-yiv-84524761">My question for the empty-head librarian is, do they allow ps teachers to<br/>
choose what they wish to use for curriculum enhancing books or would they<br/>
tell them that Kipling and the Redwall series are not appropriate also? <br/>
And, what about kids who have assignments to check out book x,y or z?  And<br/>
what about the child that is sent to the library or even volunteers to pick<br/>
up books for a teacher?  I&#39;ve seen this happen when &quot;Buddies&quot; go and choose<br/>
books to be read to smaller children?  Geez, this broad is out of control!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-800244794">Hi Lynda ...<br/>
<br/>
my h-s friend told me the head lib also told her that a teacher&#39;s aide<br/>
abused the 6 wk privilege by checking out HARLEQUIN romance type books ...<br/>
well, that&#39;s HER, not US!!!<br/>
<br/>
after this gets ironed out, I&#39;ve just resolved myself to the fact that I&#39;ll<br/>
use our downtown library (20 miles away in HEAVY traffic) instead of meeting<br/>
up w/ psycho~lib Lady and her cronies ... sheeze, it give me a headache just<br/>
thinking about going to *her* lib which is *ONLY* 5 miles away!!!  no<br/>
thanks, I&#39;d rather pay parking fees!!!<br/>
