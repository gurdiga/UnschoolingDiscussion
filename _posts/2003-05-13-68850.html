 </span></blockquote>We buy some of our groceries from Azure Standard, based in Dufur, OR. <br/>
Our wheat, grass fed beef, sometimes honey when we can&#39;t get it from <br/>
the local bee guy, milk powder, went through a period where we tried <br/>
out lots of their treats and some pre-made organic freezer foods (pot <br/>
pies, pizza pockets) but that stuff is expensive. A lot of our <br/>
medicinals we get from Azure. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to be buying more, but it can be expensive. When I spend <br/>
$100 for a 50# bag of wheat, a small box of miscellany, two roasts <br/>
and a dozen pounds of ground beef...I think &quot;I could get a whole <br/>
cartful for this money, at the local cheap grocery store&quot; or even at <br/>
the local less-cheap store! If I spent our whole grocery budget with <br/>
Azure, I&#39;d just get groceries once a month, but if I got enough to <br/>
get us THROUGH the month...ack...the delivery fee would be more <br/>
reasonable, if I were buying more. It&#39;s $11.00, whether I get $40 <br/>
worth or $300 worth...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-63080785">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the group.  I unschool my 4 kids ages 14g, 13b, 8b and 6g.  We<br/>
have been homeschooling for about 5 yrs with this being the first year<br/>
really unschooling.  We live in Ann Arbor, Michigan and belong to a great<br/>
unschooling group here that does weekly activities...only disadvantage is<br/>
the average age of the group is about 7 yrs old.<br/>
<br/>
I am finding with my high schoolers that they would prefer to play on the<br/>
computer and their ps2 all day then do anything else.  When we have<br/>
activities with the younger kids in our unschooling group I usually do make<br/>
them go along just so they get out of the house.  Any suggestions on how to<br/>
get their heads away from the screens?  I have suggested many things to my<br/>
13 yr old...his answer always is...&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;that doesn&#39;t interest<br/>
me&quot;.  If they do not start to show some interest in something else their dad<br/>
&quot;will&quot; make them start using school books so that he can see they are doing<br/>
something besides vegetating in from of their computers and video games.<br/>
<br/>
Also with us having 6 in our home, my kids are required to do chores...the<br/>
house will not maintain itself with just me doing it since I also do work<br/>
sometimes.  The kids however do not have an allowance at this time, so I<br/>
find it hard to make consequences for things that do not get done...such as<br/>
last night they are to make sure their chore in the kitchen is done and the<br/>
last one to bed is to be sure lights and TV are off.  I woke up this am to<br/>
lights and TV on and chores in the kitchen not done.  If I take away time on<br/>
the comp and ps2 they will sit around and do nothing...so does not seem like<br/>
it does much good.  any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
I have really enjoyed reading your list....have learned a lot<br/>
already...thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-361732414">&lt;&lt; I would let them do what they want to do. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is what I have done for the past several months...and it has consisted<br/>
of chatting on the computer and playing video games...nothing more.  I see<br/>
no educational value chatting to the same 2 people online and nothing more<br/>
for months on end.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt; Making them go along just so they get out of the house serves no<br/>
educational<br/>
purpose, no social advantage, and seems to me to be punitive. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When they do go they usually end up enjoying the time and or learning<br/>
something new...when they go it is to a field trip most times, I do not make<br/>
them go usually to the playground days unless we have an errand to run<br/>
before or after that they need to be there for..<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt; Then find something they&#39;re interested in.  Going to the park with seven<br/>
year<br/>
olds is not going to be the thing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have tried this to no avail....I am personally tired of trying to find<br/>
things that interest them...there is an excuse for every thing we suggest.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt; If it doesn&#39;t do any good, and if your rules about chores aren&#39;t working<br/>
anyway, consider doing something altogether different, maybe.  If you<br/>
ghere?)<br/>
it might make your whole family a nicer place to be! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Such as?  The kitchen will not clean itself and I am not able to clean our<br/>
whole house myself physically (I have some medical issues), nor should I<br/>
have too, these kids live here too and they should care about their home and<br/>
how it looks (this is a problem for our 14 yr old as well when it comes to<br/>
her room, which she shares with her lil sister...should her lil sister have<br/>
to deal with the pigsty??  nothing works in getting the older one to clean<br/>
up her crap, so the lil on some days can not even walk into their<br/>
room)....the kitchen is the only real chores these kids have other then<br/>
occasional things I ask them to do and their rooms.  I have zero problems<br/>
with my younger ones about chores or finding things to do. I am here 24/7<br/>
other then about 4 nights a month when I work the midnights shift...not<br/>
enough to make a difference in my opinion.  I do not feel I was put on this<br/>
earth to be these teenagers maid and that is what I feel like some<br/>
days...after cleaning all day I am physically exhausted and have no energy<br/>
to play/do things with the lil kids....so then they suffer because the older<br/>
kids would not help with keeping the house in a livable manner, even though<br/>
the lil kids did do their jobs.  So in the end 3 people suffer because 2 did<br/>
not do their part...that is my dilemma.<br/>

Sounds like EVERYONE&#39;s suffering because you have some rules and expectations <br/>
that aren&#39;t working out.<br/>
<br/>
And some of this suffering doesn&#39;t end at the end of the day.  Resentment can <br/>
last a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
-=-That is what I have done for the past several months...and it has consisted<br/>
of chatting on the computer and playing video games...nothing more.  I see<br/>
no educational value chatting to the same 2 people online and nothing more<br/>
for months on end.-=-<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re probably doing what is most interesting to them at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Have you played those video games yourself?<br/>
Maybe those two online people aren&#39;t saying &quot;pigstyey would really like, that <br/>
you could enjoy together?<br/>
<br/>
What about board games or card games for you to play with the older kids?  <br/>
What about jigsaw puzzles?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-148041789">From: &quot;becqui&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:becqui@...">becqui@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That is what I have done for the past several months...and it has<br/>
consisted<br/>
of chatting on the computer and playing video games...nothing more.  I see<br/>
no educational value chatting to the same 2 people online and nothing more<br/>
for months on end.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s the operative words, &quot;I see no educational value.&quot; For them, they<br/>
are getting something out of it. A need they have for themselves. We don&#39;t<br/>
always have to understand why the children choose what they do. But giving<br/>
them the freedom to do so is what is important. It won&#39;t last forever.<br/>
Really it won&#39;t. I have seen and heard the Wizard of Oz so much for the last<br/>
2 weeks I have munchkins in my dreams. I don&#39;t get the why of wanting it on<br/>
so much, but it makes Alyssa happy and there&#39;s something she&#39;s getting from<br/>
it. I don&#39;t expect her to be watching it twice a day when she&#39;s 18. She&#39;s<br/>
already moved on to Snoopy!!<br/>
Your kids just sound like they haven&#39;t had enough time to do everything they<br/>
want for as long as they want. Even if that&#39;s not &quot;enough&quot; for you. It<br/>
obviously is for them. And that&#39;s what unschooling is all about. Trusting<br/>
them to know what and how much they need.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;When they do go they usually end up enjoying the time and or learning<br/>
something new...when they go it is to a field trip most times, I do not make<br/>
them go usually to the playground days unless we have an errand to run<br/>
before or after that they need to be there for..&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are they responsible enough that you would feel comfortable leaving them<br/>
home alone? Even if you say they usually have fun and learn, maybe they are<br/>
just great kids who make the most our a situtaion they have no choice in.<br/>
But, maybe at their age, they would really like to be home alone if even for<br/>
an hour. They like it and a lot of kids need it. My 17  year old loves when<br/>
we all leave the house and she doesn&#39;t have anywhere to go. She doesn&#39;t<br/>
throw big parties or drink or smoke. She stays home alone with the stereo<br/>
blasting (something she doesn&#39;t do when people are here) and dances around<br/>
naked (another thing she doesn&#39;t get to do) and sings her guts out.<br/>
(something we have all been unfortunate enough to hear!!!) Those times when<br/>
she gets to play house all by herself and when she gets to play grown up<br/>
with her friends away on a trip are enough for her now. Her having the<br/>
freedom to do it makes her not in any hurry at all to leave home. And<br/>
remember, learning to our children doesn&#39;t always look like learning to us.<br/>
To unschool, you need to throw that &quot;learning&quot; attitude out the window. The<br/>
kids are learning in ways you don&#39;t realize.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have tried this to no avail....I am personally tired of trying to find<br/>
things that interest them...there is an excuse for every thing we suggest.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have you asked them what they would like to do or just suggest and set<br/>
things up? If they don&#39;t give you an answer, maybe it&#39;s because they just<br/>
don&#39;t know yet. They&#39;re not sure what would interest them aside form the<br/>
computer and games. For right now, it IS the computer and games. Let them do<br/>
that until their wants and needs take them elsewhere. And it may still be<br/>
computer and games but in a different way. You have to realize that now if<br/>
you really want to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Such as?  The kitchen will not clean itself and I am not able to clean our<br/>
whole house myself physically (I have some medical issues), nor should I<br/>
have too, these kids live here too and they should care about their home and<br/>
how it looks (this is a problem for our 14 yr old as well when it comes to<br/>
her room, which she shares with her lil sister...should her lil sister have<br/>
to deal with the pigsty??  nothing works in getting the older one to clean<br/>
up her crap, so the lil on some days can not even walk into their<br/>
room)....the kitchen is the only real chores these kids have other then<br/>
occasional things I ask them to do and their rooms.  I have zero problems<br/>
with my younger ones about chores or finding things to do. I am here 24/7<br/>
other then about 4 nights a month when I work the midnights shift...not<br/>
enough to make a difference in my opinion.  I do not feel I was put on this<br/>
earth to be these teenagers maid and that is what I feel like some<br/>
days...after cleaning all day I am physically exhausted and have no energy<br/>
to play/do things with the lil kids....so then they suffer because the older<br/>
kids would not help with keeping the house in a livable manner, even though<br/>
the lil kids did do their jobs.  So in the end 3 people suffer because 2 did<br/>
not do their part...that is my dilemma.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course your children live there too but they obviously don&#39;t have the<br/>
same wants when it comes to how YOU think the house should look. You need to<br/>
find another way to talk with them and let them know what&#39;s important to YOU<br/>
in how the house looks. Not them. If it&#39;s a matter of sharing a room, make a<br/>
deal with her so she can keep her side the way SHE wants it and ask if she<br/>
could please allow a path and some room for sister to play. There has to be<br/>
a way to divide the room and allow her the freedom to keep her stuff the way<br/>
SHE wants to.<br/>
<br/>
When you mentioned that you were not put here to be a maid to the teenagers,<br/>
I immediately thought that the teenagers probably feel that way too. They<br/>
didn&#39;t ask to be here and clean a house that they don&#39;t see as dirty and<br/>
messy. YOU see it that way. You should try and look at things in a different<br/>
way from what you are accustomed to. Maybe even loosen up on some things and<br/>
make compromises all around. Like let them have their room messy and maybe<br/>
another family room or something in the house where they hang out but ask if<br/>
they can help out keeping the &quot;whole family&quot; rooms a bit neater. At the same<br/>
time maybe you can ease up on what you think is necessary. You have to find<br/>
a way to talk to them so they listen and understand where YOU are coming<br/>
from. At the same time, you need to understand where they are coming from in<br/>
what&#39;s important to them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-976004608">This is an interesting discussion to me - especially about housekeeping and<br/>
such. <br/>
<br/>
I loved Sandra&#39;s suggestion about reading Leaning on a Truck. I rarely have<br/>
any issues with my children when I say &quot;Will you give me a hand with<br/>
folding this laundry?&quot; or &quot;I need someone to help with getting these<br/>
garbage cans to the street.&quot; or &quot;Let&#39;s get these dishes done quickly before<br/>
we head to the beach.&quot; even &quot;Do you need me to help you organize your<br/>
room?&quot; or &quot;Wanna slice these carrots and potatoes with me?&quot;  The most<br/>
appropriate and precious talks often follow, while we work side by side.<br/>
And, sometimes, I get the answer of &quot;No, mom, I&#39;m working on this drawing&quot;<br/>
or whatever. Or - &quot;Can you wait and when I&#39;m done I&#39;ll give you a hand,<br/>
mom.&quot; Seems reasonable to me. And, if I really reflect, it seems perfectly<br/>
appropriate that I do the bulk of the household work around here . . . I am<br/>
the one with the often insanely high standards. We have no assigned chores<br/>
and it all gets done and usually with good humor. I&#39;m a single mom with<br/>
three kids at home (19, 16 and 12) and three home businesses. I really like<br/>
to preserve our relationships - WAY MORE important to me than any power<br/>
struggles. I am deeply grateful that my kids want to be with me, talk with<br/>
me, work with me. Even though somedays it all seems to be too much. I<br/>
prefer that to the alternatives I see around me all the time . .  .parents<br/>
who can&#39;t wait for school to start again after the summer, or kids who<br/>
would rather be anywhere than with their parents. How lucky I feel to walk<br/>
out of a movie theater with a teen holding each hand, babbling about the<br/>
movie together - and how sad to see other teens slinking to the cars<br/>
outside, hoping no one will see their parents waiting. <br/>

Aloha, Lee&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This works for our family as well!  I am a married single parent &lt;bg&gt; and I <br/>
gave up chores and such a long tie ago.  I find my children are much more <br/>
willing to help and do things on their own, for their own personal pleasure <br/>
or the pleasure of being helpful.  Yesterday, Haleigh came in and asked me <br/>
if I would help HER clean up the kitchen and living room!  The floor was <br/>
sticky (not uncommon here) and she wanted to sit at the kitchen table and <br/>
draw and the living room was hiding behind a mountain of toys and pillows <br/>
and blankets from movie night the night before.  Of course, I was happy to <br/>
help.  While we were picking up, she told me she noticed how much better we <br/>
all feel when the house is clean and that she likes cleaning with me because <br/>
we always end up talking about cool stuff so it doesn&#39;t even seem like <br/>
cleaning.  I almost cried. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are days when I feel like my house is consuming me.  Seven kids make a <br/>
lot of messes and it is easy to feel like all I ever do is play human vacuum <br/>
races behind them.    What helped me regain control of the house while <br/>
maintaining my sanity was placing wicker laundry baskets around to store kid <br/>
stuff.  The little kids don&#39;t mind helping when they know they can just toss <br/>
everything into a basket and go on about their business.  In the evening, I <br/>
just collect baskets and return the contents to their proper homes.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t take long and it keeps the house manageable during the day without <br/>
all the wars we used to have.  Before, when I asked them to pick up, they <br/>
would carry a toy back to their room and get side-tracked so I was <br/>
constantly having to drag them back to task.  How joyous that those days are <br/>
long gone and we can finally breath again while keeping the messes contained <br/>
in the meantime.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-637977274">When I finally, totally, stopped limiting TV, it took about 10 months for my<br/>
kids to get their fill.  They were not strictly limited before that, but I<br/>
had been setting limits in ways I hadn&#39;t paid attention to.<br/>
<br/>
It is a normal reaction to go overboard on something that has been<br/>
restricted.  They really won&#39;t spend every moment of the rest of their lives<br/>
on the computer.  Or, if they do, they will get really good at it :-)<br/>
<br/>
If they sense that you think they are -----snip&gt; &gt; chatting on the computer<br/>
and playing video games...nothing more.  I see no educational value chatting<br/>
to the same 2 people online and nothing more for months on end.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
then you are still setting limits on that activity.  They may be trying to<br/>
get as much time in as possible before you change your mind and set limits<br/>
again.<br/>
