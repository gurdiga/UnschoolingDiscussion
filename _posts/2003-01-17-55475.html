money.  14K gold is good, 18K is really better.  Do tell Holly it&#39;s the way<br/>
to go if she&#39;s got sensitive ears.  I can&#39;t even wear silver; only gold and<br/>
white gold.  <br/>
<br/>
My favorite pair of earrings is 18K gold with cubic zirconias in them.  The<br/>
clerk thought I was nuts to spend the $$ on gold but not diamonds...like<br/>
anybody can actually tell!<br/>
<br/>
WalMart used to stock some decent 14K earings for pretty cheap, maybe they<br/>
still do.  Can she borrow some from you or another grown relative to try<br/>
before she spends her money?  (Cleaning them well first, of course.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-948651536">But, on the other hand, I cannot wear gold, but can wear white gold.  I can<br/>
also wear the earrings that they give  you when you first get your ears<br/>
pierced, but not ones that claim to be hypo-allergenic.  So, you never know.<br/>
<br/>
Since I had my ears pierced, I can no longer wear any other metal jewelry,<br/>
or watches with a metal watch band.  It was probably a mistake to have them<br/>
done.  I did it out of pure rebellion too.  My dad said I couldn&#39;t get them<br/>
pierced until I was sixteen.  My parents are divorced.  I went to my mom&#39;s<br/>
for the summer (at 14 years old) and promptly went out and got my ears<br/>
pierced, lol.<br/>
