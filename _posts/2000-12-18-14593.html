<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849155827">Ok, I know I just am always late in these replies but<br/>
hey, I&#39;m busy. :)<br/>
Anyhoo, this just literally sickens me. Going door to<br/>
door FORCING parents to give their children something<br/>
that very well may prove to be the cause of harm to<br/>
them?<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine the feeling of horror. I have enough<br/>
anxiety just trying to voluntarily take my children to<br/>
the doctor and explain that they will not have these<br/>
things put in their bodies. <br/>
<br/>
Ok, I&#39;m done, for now. Just had to put my two cents<br/>
in.<br/>
Hopeful thoughts for all the poor moms in the<br/>
Dominican Republic, and especially those whose<br/>
children were paralyzed by this vaccine mutation. :(<br/>
