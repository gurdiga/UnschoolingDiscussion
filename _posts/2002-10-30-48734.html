Has someone already suggested Alison McKee&#39;s book - Homeschooling Our Children, Unschooling Ourselves. Very thoughtful, personal story of their unschcooling, their journey, how it looked at their kids different ages, lots of discussion. I found it inspiring! ...Leonie W. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018062209">&lt;&lt;  The first unschooling book I ever read was Mary Griffith&#39;s The Unschooling <br/>
Handbook. IMO, it&#39;s a great introduction to unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any great book recommendations on unschooling for someone who&#39;s read a lot, but not recently? I don&#39;t need info or convincing as much as re-inspiration (big space between my children), affirmation and companionship. Stories of families would be great or other stuff.<br/>

There&#39;s not a book just about unschooling that&#39;s about current families.<br/>
<br/>
There are the Patchwork of Days and its follow-up but most of those families <br/>
were really structured.  (Our family is in there, but it&#39;s not worth getting <br/>
the book just for that.)<br/>

I bought the very new book by Ann Lahrson Fisher (?), Fundamentals of<br/>
Homeschooling.  I&#39;m about 3/4 of the way through it.  It&#39;s got high<br/>
quality information and lots of it.  I recommend it.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t a pure unschooling book and it doesn&#39;t have much &quot;typical day&quot;<br/>
stuff. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll bet we have several threads about typical unschooling days on<br/>
unschooling.com.  Do you know how to search those pages for a specific phrase?<br/>

Ann Lahrson Fisher&#39;s new book -- hot off the presses - is WONDERFUL and a <br/>
great read even for a seasoned unschooler who has read all the other <br/>
unschooling books. &quot;Fundamentals of Homeschooling: Notes on Successful <br/>
