Subject: TOURBUS - 15 May 01 - The End of Spam?<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
 Spam Filtering: It Works!<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
<br/>
In the last issue I mentioned BrightMail, a company offering a spam<br/>
filtering system that&#39;s being used by service providers such as<br/>
Earthlink/Mindspring, AT&T Worldnet, and others.<br/>
<br/>
I asked for feedback from people who use the Brightmail/Spaminator<br/>
service and I got lots of it.  The almost universal response was that<br/>
spam levels went down dramatically after switching on the filter, and<br/>
that instances of the filter catching non-spam emails was very rare.<br/>
Here is some of the feedback I received:<br/>
<br/>
 - I activated the spam filter and it immediately reduced the spam.<br/>
 - To say the level of SPAM went down with BrightMail is an<br/>
   understatement.  It almost disappeared.<br/>
 - Only the occasional spam gets through now.<br/>
 - I was afraid Spaminator would filter out mail from mailing lists<br/>
   I&#39;m on (such as this), but it recognized them as desired.<br/>
 - It even blocked the HaHa virus.<br/>
 - Now I don&#39;t worry about spam at all.<br/>
<br/>
If your ISP offers the Brightmail/Spaminator filter give it a try. It<br/>
seems to suppress almost ALL unwanted spam and viruses; and it gives<br/>
you the ability to review the filtered messages.  If your ISP DOESN&#39;T<br/>
offer the Brightmail service, tell them you want it or switch to one<br/>
that does.<br/>
<br/>
   &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.earthlink.net&quot;&gt;<br/>
   Earthlink - http://www.earthlink.net &lt;/A&gt;<br/>
<br/>
   &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.att.net&quot;&gt;<br/>
   AT&T WorldNet - http://www.att.net &lt;/A&gt;<br/>
<br/>
   &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.hiwaay.net&quot;&gt;<br/>
   Hiwaay - http://www.hiwaay.net &lt;/A&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The Beginning of the End?<br/>
<br/>
Now this is VERY encouraging news to me.  It seems that we have some<br/>
technology at hand that comes very close to solving the spam problem<br/>
entirely.  If a majority of ISP&#39;s adopted Brightmail or something<br/>
similar, it could signal the end of spam.<br/>
<br/>
It eliminates the spammers&#39; complaint that ISP&#39;s who filter are<br/>
violating their &quot;free speech&quot; rights, because users decide whether or<br/>
not to use the filter.  It also eliminates the need to track down and<br/>
punish spammers. What could be worse than being ignored?<br/>
<br/>
And it would make anti-spam laws completely unnecessary.  I have never<br/>
believed that involving lawyers and legislators in the process would<br/>
do anything to solve the spam problem.  Technology created the<br/>
problem, and technology seems to be solving it - hooray!<br/>
