&lt;&lt; P.S.  You probably have already, but have you read the books written by <br/>
 Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish?  They wrote How To Talk So Kids Will Listen <br/>
 & Listen So Kids Will Talk, which I would recommend for folks who don&#39;t <br/>
 have kids to read, and Siblings Without Rivalry, which I haven&#39;t read, but <br/>
 I&#39;ll bet there&#39;s some good stuff in there, too.<br/>

I think before you even consider sending your kids to school, it should be <br/>
required reading.<br/>
Assign yourself the Siblings without Rivalry for sure!!! And then make it a <br/>
point to find out what needs are not being met that is contributing to the <br/>
anger.<br/>
Just because you&#39;re a homebody, doesn&#39;t mean that they will be happiest that <br/>
way.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve tried to get to the root of this by finding out if <br/>
each of them is happy with the way things are set up, but I get the feeling <br/>
that getting away from the house more would be good for them.<br/>
You may have to call in assistance for this, since you need the at home time.<br/>
I&#39;ve found that when my kids are getting really cranky with each other, they <br/>
just need a break or a change of pace.<br/>

&lt;&lt; One thing I have heard is that sibling rivalry is really a way that kids <br/>
 compete for our attention. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Or for sibling attention.<br/>
My dd will do the most annoying things to the boys in order to get their <br/>
attention if they&#39;re ignoring her.<br/>
<br/>
I think time alone with each child can help, away from the house. We do <br/>
special &quot;date&quot; nights with the kids.<br/>
If one of them is purposely annoying another one, that is a BIG signal to me <br/>
that they need some one on one.<br/>
&quot;let&#39;s go bake some cookies&quot; (or whatever makes that child happy) is usually <br/>
all it takes. A pillow fight ends as soon as anyone is getting stressed out. <br/>
Being involved in the pillow fight with them could help too.<br/>
I think we are responsible to pick up on the cues they give us. If we don&#39;t, <br/>
and it erupts into something unhappy, who is really to blame? The more <br/>
experienced, aware parent? Or the child that depends on us?<br/>
I think most of the time it&#39;s me that sets the tone or needs to pick up on <br/>
cues sooner.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003268369">Another idea to add to the pot...<br/>
<br/>
I remember a friend who homeschooled, and was going through something of the <br/>
same experience with two boys constantly fighting both at home and out with <br/>
friends, deciding to take one year to do nothing else but unlearn their <br/>
current behavior. Everything else came second - from putting on their <br/>
clothes, to going grocery shopping, to hiking in the woods, to building a <br/>
fort, to sitting on the couch, to reading. Whatever they were doing, <br/>
wherever they were going, my friend&#39;s number one thought was &quot;we&#39;re going to <br/>
do this co-operatively&quot; and the moment an incident began to brew, she would <br/>
curtail whatever the activity was, and focus on the behavior and correct it <br/>
before it got out of hand. If she stuck with her plan I suspect it took a <br/>
lot less than a year for it to work, but unfortunately, we moved away, and I <br/>
don&#39;t know how it all worked out. But I thought it was a great idea to focus <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
My kids went through a battling each other stage, long enough for me to <br/>
recall thinking life would never change. After far too long a time of me <br/>
listening to them yelling and fighting and explanations of he hit me first, <br/>
she threw that, he did this, she did that and driving me up the wall, and me <br/>
trying many of the suggestions mentioned here on the list already, I tried <br/>
something different. I told them that whenever I heard what I thought was a <br/>
fight brewing, I would intervene and they would have to stop whatever it is <br/>
they were doing and would have to come and sit down with me and either 1) <br/>
re-enact the preceding scene frame by frame for me so I could get a clear <br/>
picture of what the problem was and how to resolve it, or 2) each in turn <br/>
would tell me his/her side of the story and I would sit as judge after <br/>
listening to both sides. I described to them that this was similar to what <br/>
happens when adults have fights they can&#39;t or won&#39;t fix on their own - they <br/>
go to court and someone sits in judgement; the judge might get it right, but <br/>
he might get it wrong. In both scenarios I would get the kids to pinpoint <br/>
exactly when things started to go wrong, what they could have done to make <br/>
it head in a better direction, what we could do to ensure it wouldn&#39;t go <br/>
wrong another time under the same circumstances, and I set it up for them to <br/>
watch for key triggers in the future, asking them that when either of them <br/>
noticed one of these triggers in the future, to come tell me. As time went <br/>
on, my daughter was better able to see the triggers as they were happening, <br/>
while my son generally didn&#39;t twig to them until after the fact with me <br/>
having to draw it out of him - but the point was, allowing them to take on <br/>
the responsibility for their personal well-being was a great experience for <br/>
all of us - taking this tack eliminated the me against them/them against <br/>
each other scenario. And one of the best things I thought, was that the <br/>
consequence of their actions was no longer anger, but talk, and I always <br/>
left it to them to settle the dispute and figure out how justice could best <br/>
be served. It dawns on me now that if it was attention from me they were <br/>
seeking, then they got their reward, because they got oodles of attention <br/>
from me as I listened to their stories of the battle just fought and I can <br/>
outtalk anyone any day of the week - something they learned from those <br/>
experiences. I&#39;m sure one of the greatest lessons they learned from all that <br/>
is that being subjected to another session with their long-winded mother was <br/>
simply not worth the battle - it was easier to stop fighting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-820567094">When my boys have lost it with one another (which happens less and less as <br/>
they get older, and partly because of what follows), I speak with them <br/>
separately.  I&#39;ll let Marty, the younger one, tell his whole story, and vent <br/>
about his brother, and tell me that Kirby is ALWAYS that way, and Marty&#39;s <br/>
adrenaline starts to dissipate, and Kirby can&#39;t interrupt.  I&#39;ll try to find <br/>
something actually needed and useful and soothing for Marty to do (even if <br/>
it&#39;s just watch TV with Holly or to go play with the dog, and if he&#39;s willing <br/>
then I know where he is and that he has something better to think about than <br/>
what just happened).  Then I go to Kirby and I summarize, calmly, what Marty <br/>
said.   I get Kirby&#39;s response, I read his eyes and body language, I argue <br/>
Marty&#39;s argument so that Kirby will see Marty&#39;s point of view without having <br/>
to interact with Marty while he&#39;s still angry.  I soothe Kirby and remind him <br/>
that it&#39;s hard for Marty to be so close in age, or whatever&#39;s appropriate for <br/>
the situation.  Maybe it&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s hard for Marty since you had company all <br/>
weekend and he didn&#39;t have anyone special to hang out with, and now he wants <br/>
to hang out with you.  I KNOW you&#39;re tired, but think of it from his point of <br/>
view.&quot;  Whatever it might be.<br/>
<br/>
Then I go back to Marty and tell him Kirby&#39;s side, and how Kirby seems to <br/>
feel about it, and could he just wait until afternoon maybe, until Kirby&#39;s <br/>
had some time alone.<br/>
<br/>
The benefits are that they get to argue with someone who loves them instead <br/>
of someone they&#39;ve just been furious with.  They still get to say their piece <br/>
and run it through their mental process, and each hears the other&#39;s point of <br/>
view, but filtered through a long-time witness, not directly and hurtfully.   <br/>
And my benefit is I know where their understandings are, what compassion <br/>
they&#39;re developing, what their patience level is becoming, etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Sandra! I am going to start trying this. We have always used the *come <br/>
here and sit down and both of you will get a chance to tell Mom/Dad what the <br/>
problem is* way to solve the really big knock down drag out fights (and the <br/>
little ones too) but in the past year this way hasn&#39;t worked as well as it <br/>
used to. Mainly because it just ends in a screaming match to see who goes <br/>
first to tell us the *REAL* story! (I almost want to run away laughing <br/>
because 6 and 8 year olds can come up with some very persuasive arguments as <br/>
to why it should be him/her who goes first!) Any way, separating the kids and <br/>
allowing them each time to tell their side, cool off and have Mom and Dad do <br/>
the argument for them sounds very positive. <br/>
Has there ever been a time when this didn&#39;t work? And is this the most <br/>
drastic measure you have ever taken?<br/>

There have been times when one of them stayed angry for a few hours, but that <br/>
was the worst.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And is this the most drastic measure you have ever taken? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I&#39;ve used yelling and shaming, directed toward Kirby.  Not more <br/>
effective, by any means.  More a release of my OWN frustration and <br/>
adrenaline, and it didn&#39;t set a very good example at all.  It let him know I <br/>
was really frustrated, but it wasn&#39;t positive.  <br/>
<br/>
There were times when they were younger that I would keep them apart for <br/>
hours, and finally they&#39;d need the partner or opponent for a game or <br/>
something and THEY would say that&#39;s long enough, we&#39;re fine now, can we play <br/>
together?<br/>
<br/>
Something I&#39;ve tried throughout to keep aware of is to watch when they&#39;re <br/>
good to another sibling and comment on it in private.  Like...<br/>
&quot;Marty, thanks for helping Holly with that puppet.  She was getting really <br/>
frustrated.&quot;  (She&#39;s making marionettes out of cardboard tubes and stuff)<br/>
&quot;Kirby, thanks for letting Marty go with you guys to play D&D.  I hope he <br/>
didn&#39;t bug you too much,&quot; and Kirby got to say, &quot;No, it was fine.  He was <br/>
cool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Stuff like that.  Again, it&#39;s not just feedback and positive reinforcement <br/>
for them, but it&#39;s information gathering for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894006672">&lt;&lt;Has anyone else gone through this with close in age boys?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My brother and I were just like your sons.  We were 2 years apart in age and<br/>
basically despised each other, and we went to school  :)<br/>
<br/>
We had lots of fistfights, scratches, very ugly arguments.  After I grew up,<br/>
my Mom told me that there were days when she fantasized about not coming<br/>
home from work, just driving straight out of town so she wouldn&#39;t have to<br/>
put up with the fighting.<br/>
<br/>
What I remember as having an effect was she simply kicked us out into the<br/>
yard and locked the door.  She said she couldn&#39;t control us, couldn&#39;t stop<br/>
it, but it made her crazy and she didn&#39;t feel like she should have to be<br/>
crazy because we wanted to pick at each other.<br/>
<br/>
It did calm us down.  Before I think we would get out of hand because we<br/>
knew my mom would step in and save us from serious injury.  We could be<br/>
jerks because mom wouldn&#39;t let anything bad happen.  Steve and I still don&#39;t<br/>
like each other much but I haven&#39;t stuck my tongue out at him in years<br/>

the ball in the kids&#39; court?  Can you call a family forum and state simply<br/>
that you understand the older kids have trouble getting along but that you<br/>
and the toddler are being negatively impacted and something has to give?<br/>
<br/>
If the scenario were different and the two older ones were playing music so<br/>
loud that the little guy couldn&#39;t sleep, how would you handle it?<br/>
<br/>
If the older guys were having fun with the burn pile but leaving matches<br/>
laying around that could damage the little guys, how would you handle it?<br/>
<br/>
I think Patti is probably right that the kids get a kick out of the<br/>
bickering but she and the little guy have the right to not have their home<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I was wondering about, keeping them apart for a good length of <br/>
time. That and grounding. Have you ever used that? <br/>
I don&#39;t mean to sound so nosy, I just like to pick brains. In our house I am <br/>
the laid back parent, but the *heavy* when it comes to punishments (if that&#39;s <br/>
a good word for it) and Darin is the more reserved parent but a pushover when <br/>
it comes down to making the kids see their fighting (or what ever) is wrong.<br/>
For example, I am the only mom on the block who will let my kids ride their <br/>
bikes all over. Everyone else keeps their kids restricted to this street. <br/>
Darin is the same way, he hates to have the kids out of eye sight. OTOH, the <br/>
kids know they have to give me a general idea of where they are going to be, <br/>
just in case I need to find them. (nine times out of ten, they do) Should <br/>
they just hop on their bikes, ride three blocks over to a friends house, go <br/>
inside to play and I have no idea where they are, then they would get into <br/>
trouble. (this would result in no bikes for a week, they would have to walk <br/>
if they wanted to go somewhere) Darin and one of my friends from down the <br/>
street say that *IF* I kept the kids restricted to our block then I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have that problem. I say it doesn&#39;t happen enough for me to put a stop to it. <br/>
Besides, if I didn&#39;t let them go, then Moly wouldn&#39;t have found a new friend <br/>
with a Mulberry tree and blackberry bramble in her back yard, and I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have been able to make a great cobbler! <br/>
So I wonder which is better? I let the kids go all over, riding their bikes, <br/>
unless someone forgets to give me a heads up. Then I take away the favorite <br/>
mode of transportation. I don&#39;t take their ability to go and have fun, just <br/>
the ride. Darin OTOH would rather keep them restricted to the block and then <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t have to bother with telling me where they are going, (risking <br/>
forgetting and loosing the bikes) because I would be able to look out and see <br/>
where they are. <br/>

failed to do so, I didn&#39;t punish them, but was honest with them about why I <br/>
wanted to know, and how scary it is for the mom, and asked WHY they didn&#39;t <br/>
let me know.  In each case they felt immediately sorry, and I&#39;m only thinking <br/>
to two Marty-instances and two Kirby-times.  Grounding them or taking <br/>
privileges away might make ME feel better (or like a better parent) but I <br/>
don&#39;t want them to learn to earn privileges, or to learn to behave to avoid <br/>
&quot;being arrested&quot; or whatever.  I want them to actually understand and accept <br/>
the reasoning.  If you withhold bicycles, when they&#39;re older that won&#39;t <br/>
transfer to telling their girlfriends where they&#39;re going.  If we use reasons <br/>
and purposes and feelings to persuade them, that will automatically transfer <br/>
to other situations.  They know that whoever is responsible for o good.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;So I wonder which is better? I let the kids go all over, riding their bikes, <br/>
unless someone forgets to give me a heads up. Then I take away the favorite <br/>
mode of transportation.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Those aren&#39;t the only two choices, though, to restrict movement or to <br/>
threaten with bike-removal.<br/>

penalized because of my (probably irrational) worries.<br/>
So, we compromise. When he&#39;s going to be a ways away<br/>
for quite a while, he takes one of those pocket-size<br/>

likes it, because if something comes up and he wants<br/>
to stay later than the agreed-on time, he doesn&#39;t have<br/>
to come all the way home, he can just call and let me<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, he gets a kick out of calling home and<br/>

 ~Nancy &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The way Sandra described is very similar to how I handle things now. <br/>
Although, most of the time I just don&#39;t have to separate them to achieve <br/>
peace.....mainly because the two usually in question are 8.5 and 12. With the <br/>
5 and 8.5 y.o. it&#39;s different, there&#39;s always a separation involved before I <br/>
can hear both sides.<br/>
Something else I do, after they are a bit more calm, is ask how they <br/>
themselves contributed to the problem. They are usually able to figure out <br/>
how it could have been handled differently on their own. Sometimes I have to <br/>
point out how it felt to the other person, but after practicing having them <br/>
self analyze, they are pretty good at it now. <br/>

cottoned on to the idea of working through their fighting like this. It&#39;s <br/>
seven years later now and the fighting is now history, but it did continue <br/>
on for a few years, but becoming more and more sporadic once we &quot;got with <br/>
the program.&quot; I think the evolution into less fighting was helped along by <br/>
their growing maturity and their ability to spend more time on their own and <br/>
less with each other; as well, as they grew older their vocabulary grew <br/>
larger and I suspect they found they could communicate more with words and <br/>
less with hands and feet.<br/>

each other and get along(though they wouldn&#39;t admit to that). <br/>
I have two different kinds of situations here in my family.  One <br/>
are &quot;real&quot; fights that need to be discussed and resolved the other is <br/>
when they get &quot;crazed&quot; and seem to thrive on antagonizing and being <br/>
overly silly and eventually too physical with each other and it gets <br/>
out of control.  They do it right in front of me and it is definitely <br/>
something they enjoy.  When I say, I step out of the game, I mean, we <br/>
all know where it leads when they start to get like that and if they <br/>
choose to take it that far they know the outcome.   When they know <br/>
I &quot;won&#39;t play&quot; they choose not to let it get that far.  I can hear <br/>
one or both of them pulling in the reigns and ending it before an <br/>
eruption happens.  Or when I hear one trying to stop and the other <br/>
not responding I usually try to use distraction to help the other <br/>
stop.<br/>
They have hit each other or pulled hair or pinched, but they have <br/>
never duked it out.  Maybe because they are a boy and girl or maybe <br/>
because that is something that would seem really wrong to them.  If <br/>
one starts crying, it all end.  Game over.<br/>
They even admit to it being a game of sorts.<br/>

I go with the one who&#39;s likely do the most damage (physical or psychic) in <br/>
the waiting period, if one of them is REALLY furious.  That sometimes means <br/>
&quot;grab the loser,&quot; which is a trick older teachers taught me when I was <br/>
teaching and I broke up some fights between boys.  Two of the male teachers <br/>
older than I was (everyone was older than I was, I started at 21), said if <br/>
you grab the guy who&#39;s winning, he might try to hurt you to get back to the <br/>
fight.  If you grab the loser, he wants to be rescued, he saves face (didn&#39;t <br/>
stay to truly lose) and the winner saves face (he was winning).<br/>
<br/>
So in the case of my boys, that near-loser is usually Marty.<br/>

Considering the problem of arguments/fights between kids...<br/>
<br/>
Luz and I recently heard a good idea. If it is possible for both combatants<br/>
to (stop for a moment and) tell their own sides of the argument, the idea is<br/>
that both parties should then be able to state the opponent&#39;s point of view,<br/>
with a parent present. Thus, each will at least listen to and understand,<br/>
and then reiterate the other&#39;s position.<br/>
<br/>
It is the function of a good interviewer (such as on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;) or a<br/>
reporter or judge to get the story straight. We think it might be helpful<br/>
for kids in their disagreements to understand each other and be able to say<br/>
in their own words what the other is saying, and pinpoint the problem,<br/>
because so often, arguments are the result of misunderstandings.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262212399">First I apologize for the late post--the subject&#39;s seemed to have died down. <br/>
I&#39;ve been out of town or a week. I&#39;m just catching up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;however now that we are all adults (well in age at least &lt;g&gt;) we are all<br/>
 </span></blockquote>very close - and those who have the closest relationships are those who were<br/>
the ones who are closest in age who fought the most in the childhood/teenage<br/>
years. Maybe along the line somewhere amongst all that fighting and arguing<br/>
we came to understand the other (all good and not so good qualities) more<br/>
and therefore worked out better ways to deal with each other providing a<br/>
stronger foundation of relationship handling between each other!!!&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess I wanted to share the other side: my brother (I&#39;m fifteen months <br/>
older) fought like crazy. As far as I can tell, it wasn&#39;t for attention (of a <br/>
parent or each other), for fun, out of boredom, or for anything other than we <br/>
just couldn&#39;t stand each other. <br/>
<br/>
It seems that a lot of people say they are closer to that &quot;other&quot; sibling now <br/>
that they are grown--I hear that all the time. Johnny and I STILL avoid each <br/>
other. We don&#39;t actively seek one another&#39;s company and actually try to be in <br/>
different rooms, if possible, when we are &quot;together&quot;--although there&#39;s no <br/>
outright physical danger any more! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He threw a phone at my head one time---one of those OLD phones---you know, <br/>
the dial kind? Blood everywhere. Our fighting was wicked. I can&#39;t remember <br/>
many times when we actually &quot;got along&quot;, although there MUST have been a few <br/>
peaceful hours in those many years.<br/>
<br/>
My parents tried everything. Mostly we got &quot;the belt&quot; or &quot;switched&quot;. So you <br/>
can imagine my feelings about corporal punishment! And I blamed it all on <br/>
John. I didn&#39;t ask for him to be a part of my life. But as a sibling, there <br/>
was nothing I could do about it--and my mother was no help--mostly whining <br/>
about how &quot;lucky&quot; I was to have a brother (or Johnny, a sister) and could we <br/>
pleeeeease stop---Go figure!<br/>
<br/>
Some personalities just don&#39;t FIT, and we have always been polar opposites. I <br/>
think many parents cheer/fool themselves by thinking that these &quot;wars&quot; will <br/>
result in close adult relationships, but it doesn&#39;t always work out that way.<br/>
<br/>
Things got &quot;better&quot; when we were in high school---different ones---and had <br/>
completely separate lives. I &quot;get&quot; to see him once or twice every other year. <br/>
Often enough.<br/>
<br/>
I think that, as a parent, the more pleasant you can make sibling life, the <br/>
better. They didn&#39;t ask to be thrown into this life-long situation, and <br/>
there&#39;s really no way out.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had a solution---just my story. But I think it&#39;s wise to know that <br/>
sometimes all you can do is make each as happy as you can---and keep them <br/>
separated.<br/>

<br/>
I agree with this.  <br/>
<br/>
I started to write that I&#39;m lucky that my kids get along as well as they do, <br/>
but it&#39;s not all luck.  Yet still, if one of them REALLY didn&#39;t like one of <br/>
the others longterm, I would do whatever it took to allow them to be separate <br/>
and still get to be with parents and the sibling they did like.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents see their job as the parent of a group, but I think each <br/>
individual child should be parented as well as the parents can.  Each should <br/>
be looked at as he might have been an only child, and not deprived entirely <br/>
of attention to him as an individual.<br/>
<br/>
The new age belief that each person chooses his situation for purposes of <br/>
soul-growth (kind of an American reincarnation theory) will likely be thrown <br/>
into this by someone in the readership.  Personally, I don&#39;t believe it and I <br/>
don&#39;t like it as a defense or a justification for human behavior.  Even if <br/>
reincarnation is the deal and we all get unlimited lifetimes to &quot;get it <br/>
right,&quot; the rightness comes from doing the best we can, and any parent who is <br/>
allowing a child to be abused or tormented isn&#39;t doing his or her best job as <br/>
a parent or as a compassionate human.<br/>

lot of things.  But I *don&#39;t* accept it as a defense or justification for <br/>
any kind of behavior.  I think people using it that way don&#39;t really <br/>

soul purpose, then they need all the help they can get from their parents <br/>
in learning how to deal with it.  That doesn&#39;t mean allowing them to be <br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s no way to know fully without several exact clones of each child <br/>
raised in different circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
I know I could have made things worse.<br/>
I know I could have failed to help them find peaceful solutions<br/>
I know I could have failed to be close enough to catch things when they <br/>
started.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how much worse it would have been without my input and advice <br/>
and supervision, and nobody else could do better than guess, either.  But I <br/>
see other families that practically encourage sibling disagreement by making <br/>
fun of it, characterizing their kids as the other&#39;s fan or enemy or other <br/>
kinds of irritating descriptions.    I don&#39;t know how much better it could be <br/>
if I had done more and better sooner with encouraging good relationships <br/>
between them.   <br/>
<br/>
I think there is a big element of luck in any personality matters.  Any peek <br/>
at DNA and inheritance of traits shows the gigantic gamble that &quot;nature&quot; is.  <br/>
And THEN comes the attention and tools and messages and modeling and all the <br/>
half-invisible and subconscious stuff that happens as &quot;nurture.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455752557">I have 2 boys  7 and 3.   There is alot of sibling<br/>
rivalry between them.   My youngest was just over 24<br/>
hours old  when I stepped out of the room and my then<br/>
not quite 4 year old tried to kill him.   It has been<br/>
a relationship where my oldest hates his brother and<br/>
my youngest worships the older one.   Lately I<br/>
realised part of it was timing.   I had a new baby<br/>
about the time my first born was doing the &quot;i want to<br/>
marry mommy&quot; thing  and although I tried my best to<br/>
spend time just with him and keep things as normal as<br/>
possible   It wasn&#39;t entirely possible for him to stay<br/>
in the limelight.    So I am certain part of it was<br/>
bad timing (not my choice of times)  I also think that<br/>
the personalities play a big part.   With my younger<br/>
sons personality  I think it would have been fine   he<br/>
is very laid back and takes things as they come <br/>
whereas my first is a everything has to be perfect for<br/>
him  personality.  As for parenting I have made some<br/>
mistakes but i try very hard to keep my boys as<br/>
separate people and very rarely do I force them to do<br/>
things together other than family outings because I<br/>
know that 7 and 3 are very different ages and enjoy<br/>
different things.   Above all I know I have to<br/>
intervene everytime there is a fight because my kids<br/>
probably would do serious harm to each other if i left<br/>
them to &quot;work it out&quot;  <br/>

quite sure I&#39;ve tried everything except shipping them off to boarding<br/>
school in different states. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Yet still, if one of them REALLY didn&#39;t like one of<br/>
&gt; the others longterm, I would do whatever it took to allow them to be<br/>
&gt; separate<br/>
&gt; and still get to be with parents and the sibling they did like.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For us it&#39;s not a matter of the kids not liking each other.  They do<br/>
*not* want to be separated- they seek each other out continually.  For<br/>
some reason they can&#39;t get enough of it.  It usually starts out silly<br/>
and giggly and ends up with tears and anger.<br/>
I think my situation is different from kids who just plain don&#39;t like<br/>
each other and prefer to be apart.  In some ways that would be a whole<br/>
lot easier to manage.<br/>
<br/>
Plus my kids at times *do* get along, and when they do everything&#39;s<br/>
great.  (I think I mentioned it&#39;s about 50/50).  So I imagine they will<br/>
grow up to be good friends- I just need to figure out how to live with<br/>
the bickering 50 percent for now.<br/>

understandings are, what compassion  they&#39;re developing, what their patience<br/>
level is becoming, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-961630996"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt;Has anyone else gone through this with close in age boys?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I have six brothers and three sisters and oh lordy the fights that<br/>
we would have - I found in our family that those closest in age would have<br/>
the most fights and also the most intensive fights - girls included -<br/>
however now that we are all adults (well in age at least &lt;g&gt;) we are all<br/>
very close - and those who have the closest relationships are those who were<br/>
the ones who are closest in age who fought the most in the childhood/teenage<br/>
years. Maybe along the line somewhere amongst all that fighting and arguing<br/>
we came to understand the other (all good and not so good qualities) more<br/>
and therefore worked out better ways to deal with each other providing a<br/>
stronger foundation of relationship handling between each other!!!<br/>
