<div id="ygrps-yiv-230304645">It seems to me that any discussion about learning math should also ask the<br/>
question &quot;why are so many people (who went through the school system) phobic<br/>
about math?&quot;  My guess is that many people would label themselves as math<br/>
phobic/ can&#39;t do math/don&#39;t get math.  It would be difficult to feel like<br/>
you could introduce math to your children if you feel that way - you won&#39;t<br/>
be able to answer their questions etc, etc.  From my personal experience it<br/>
would be impossible to hide math basics from your children.  They will<br/>
probably have their own building blocks however.  My children talk about<br/>
numbers a lot, sometimes they quiz each other.  They have their own ways of<br/>
figuring things out.  Recently my older son wanted to know how many families<br/>
he would have if he had 20 children who were twins.  We looked at it in a<br/>
few different ways and talked about dividing.  I am not sure how he does the<br/>
calculation or exactly what he got out of it but it is one more bit to add<br/>
to his foundation of knowledge.<br/>
I think all knowledge is accumulated in this way.  I think we remember<br/>
better when we can attach new information to something we already know.  So<br/>
there are building blocks which we attach new information to.  The important<br/>
thing is that the building blocks are not some set of facts we can all<br/>
learn.  They are unique and based on our personal experiences.  My children<br/>
may be exposed to exactly the same things (not true) but they perceive them<br/>
in different ways and different aspects are important to each of them so<br/>
their basic knowledge is different.<br/>
I think this is one of the reasons why unschooling makes sense.  Each<br/>
child/person can accumulate information in a way that makes sense and is<br/>
retrievable for them.  When we are forced to learn certain material on<br/>
someone else&#39;s (the teacher) schedule we totally disrupt this process.  No<br/>
wonder we can&#39;t remember what we learned in school.  This is also the reason<br/>
why there is not some standard set of information that we need to know at a<br/>
certain stage of our life.  This is also why testing for specific knowledge<br/>
gives misleading information about a person&#39;s knowledge.<br/>
Another way of thinking about unschooling is to think about how you learn.<br/>
Say, I tell you to go and learn how to play the piano or complete a course<br/>
in Algebra 1.  I am not going to give you any incentive - just do it because<br/>
I said to.  I know that you will need to know that stuff, I know better than<br/>
you.  What are you going to learn?  On the other hand think about the last<br/>
time you wanted to know or learn something.  How did you go about it?  Was<br/>
it fun?  Did you have trouble figuring out the interim steps to get to your<br/>
goal?  We often have to learn some basic technique or acquire a basic tool<br/>
before we can achieve our goal.  If we are motivated it isn&#39;t a stumbling<br/>
block.  The example of person who posted about wanting to become a nurse but<br/>
had to do the Algebra first.  Without the goal of becoming a nurse it is<br/>
unlikely she would have studied the algebra but she was very successful at<br/>
it.  Most adult learning is like that.  Why do we expect children to learn<br/>
in a different way?<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

<br/>
  when folks talk about math--i think they&#39;re usually talking about <br/>
calculation--which is a very small part of mathemathics.  We are surrounded <br/>
by mathematics--we all arrange furniture--that&#39;s design and proportion. We <br/>
cook. We figure out how much things cost at the store.  Some people play <br/>
pool, or golf (geometry). We garden (look at the center of flowers, notice <br/>
the pattern)  An on and on.  There is a book, Math Art. Which might be useful <br/>
for the calculation phobis among us...<br/>
