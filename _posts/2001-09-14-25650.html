 </span></blockquote>I believe in psychology this constant referring to what one knows another <br/>
person feels and believes and being intimately involved in conversations that <br/>
involve gossip of another person is called Triangulation.  Anyway that&#39;s what <br/>
I learned in my pschology classes. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read with both personal and professional interest some of the things you <br/>
have written about your family since joining this list.  For a family with so <br/>
much &quot;addiction&quot;, &quot;dysfunction&quot;, &quot;compulsive behaviors&quot; &quot;co-dependency <br/>
problems&quot;, &quot;insecurity issues&quot;, (all this gleaned from having an outside <br/>
perspective on the information provided by the source).  I, for one, would be <br/>
grateful to others who would share their thoughts and suggestions about how <br/>
my life could be enhanced by changing some of my own beliefs and behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
As in the past when someone has shared their opinion with the group about the <br/>
content of your writings I expect to have some backlash from you as to how <br/>
I&#39;m wrong, misunderstand you, don&#39;t know your family, don&#39;t understand your <br/>
situation etc etc.  My opinions are based on the information you have given <br/>
to this list over the past week.<br/>
<br/>
In the work I do, I meet with many seriously dysfunctional families that do <br/>
not realize there are many more underlying problems than the ones you have <br/>
touched on the surface.<br/>
<br/>
I personally am grateful to Sandra and Lynda for their thoughts and their <br/>
well written e-mails, as I am to Julie, Wendy, Brenda and others that have <br/>
posted information on the process of deschooling.  As I come to the end of my <br/>
first full week unschooling I&#39;m learning more and more from both these women <br/>
on how I can turn my life into an unschooling experience.  It doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
I&#39;ll do it all today, but I&#39;m open and willing to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Take what you want and leave the rest (as they say in the programs)<br/>
