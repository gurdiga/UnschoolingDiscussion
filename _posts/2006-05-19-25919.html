<div id="ygrps-yiv-113486816">Hi everyone I wanted to spread the word about a new local yahoo group<br/>
looking for like-minded members.  We are active with weekly park days and<br/>
some field trips.  read description below (from &#39;Home page&#39;) to see if this<br/>
would be a fit for you. feel free to pass on to other groups as well.<br/>
 <br/>

Description<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Earth Circle Homeskooling Group is a secular group <br/>
<br/>
by nature, but celebrate in the wonder of Mother Earth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For women to come together to support women who are <br/>
<br/>
thinkers, problem solvers, life guiders, love givers,<br/>
<br/>
and peace makers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This group is for women of <br/>
<br/>
Oklahoma<br/>
<br/>
     and<br/>
<br/>
   Texas<br/>
<br/>
to share their thoughts and get support on<br/>
<br/>
parenting: Child-bearing/raising, and home education. <br/>
<br/>
As well as, issues like natural child birthing, VBACs and <br/>
<br/>
HBACs after one or more c-sections, and parental education, <br/>
<br/>
so that the parents are the chooser of their family&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
path, not doctors, state, or public school board, <br/>
<br/>
well-intentioned family or friends. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                 ECHG is also about promoting a healthy life style <br/>
<br/>
                 through a balance of daily living, natural health care.<br/>
<br/>
                        recycling - reusing - reducing <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately this is an open forum of discussion. For women supporting women. <br/>
<br/>
I ask that this be a women&#39;s only group. <br/>
<br/>
We are here to listen and to learn from one another. We are not afraid to be<br/>
questioned, or deemed different. <br/>
<br/>
                            We are radicals!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
In Gratitude,<br/>
