I think criticise my child, now a pre-schooler, too much. When he <br/>
shows me a puzzle he did and a piece is wrong for instance, I tell <br/>
him. But I have been noticing he feels discouraged of trying things <br/>
by himself and always asks me for feedback. <br/>
================<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he asks because you ask.<br/>
<br/>
If you learn to comfort yourself instead of asking for outside approval, it <br/>
might help both you AND him.<br/>
<br/>
If he asks for feedback, maybe he really wants conversation.  There&#39;s a <br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
You have more choices than just saying &quot;wonderful&quot; or &quot;problems.&quot;  You could <br/>
say &quot;that looks fun!&quot; or &quot;I remember liking to do those when I was little&quot; or <br/>
&quot;Do you want to work it again and let me help too?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you spend more time with him it might help.  Talk with him along the way, <br/>
and have fun while something&#39;s happening (process focus instead of just <br/>
product focus), and whether it was wrong or right, good or bad, won&#39;t even matter.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something that might help:<br/>

That&#39;s about playing together, talking together while doing something else.<br/>
<br/>
This one&#39;s about balance:<br/>
