homeschool; everyone&#39;s situation is different, and they have to make (and<br/>
live with) their own choices.<br/>
<br/>
But the future, in my dreams and hopes, is that school itself could change.<br/>
That it could be more like unschooling, with more freedom, trust,<br/>
independence, creativity, flexability, etc.  It may not happen in my<br/>
lifetime, but the schools didn&#39;t become what they are in a few years, so<br/>
changing them will probably take a while, too.<br/>

That was in 1962.  I&#39;m still waiting.<br/>
