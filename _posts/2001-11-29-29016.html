Interesting....I would NOT threaten my children with having to go to school.<br/>
If our circumstances changed somehow,  and I was forced to put them into a<br/>
school situation;  I wouldn&#39;t want them to think it was punishment for<br/>
something they&#39;d done.  Then again,  I try not to use threats with my<br/>
children for anything - I don&#39;t find it to be a respectful way to treat a<br/>
person I love.<br/>

I know what you mean about avoiding debates.  I&#39;m feeling more and more sure<br/>
as I go along.....it&#39;s generally my way to be gentle,  but I&#39;m sometimes so<br/>
much so that I fail to get my point across.  I&#39;m better at it in writing,<br/>
but I really want to be able to challenge people - in a kind way- to look at<br/>
things with their children differently.<br/>
I recently re-united with an old college pal who just started hs-ing.  She<br/>
has set up a little &#39;school room&#39; in her house - I hope she&#39;ll outgrow it!<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be too forward about unschooling and scare her off,  yet I<br/>
adore her youngsters and hope she&#39;ll loosen up as she goes.<br/>
My other friend from childhood would be apalled at unschooling,  I think.<br/>
And what&#39;s interesting to me is that I was much more &#39;academically&#39;<br/>
intelligent than she.....I think there&#39;s some kind of fear there...<br/>
gotta go for now,<br/>
Susan,  often a &#39;closet unschooler&#39;  among hs groups!<br/>
<br/>
I only have homeschooling friends, no unschoolers yet, except here and<br/>
unschooling.com. (thankful for that)<br/>
I am still pretty quiet about my unschooling ways, I&#39;m still to new to get<br/>
into any debates about it :-)<br/>
But I know people who also seem to go way overboard with the school-at-home<br/>
thing.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-738488033">Well articulated, Joce {{applause}}  Thanks...I agree,  but wasn&#39;t able to<br/>
pull the words together this well!<br/>
<br/>
When I asked my neighbor what she did differently to &quot;teach&quot; her LD<br/>
son...she said nothing, you just go over and over it until they catch on<br/>
(her son finally read at age 10)  She took him out of school to *teach* him<br/>
at home -- looks like they *taught* the desire to read right out of the poor<br/>
guy.  Funny that her other son reads at a college level (since age 9).  She<br/>
never  had *time* to work with him on reading because she was so focused on<br/>
the LD labelled child!<br/>
Susan<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I see what you are saying but are you sure you see what I am saying?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, and I think it&#39;s the definition of unschooling that&#39;s the hang up.<br/>
<br/>
If we define unschooling as child led learning then we can say that<br/>
unschooling won&#39;t work for every child. The environment might be lacking.<br/>
The parent might not know how to interact with the child, for instance an<br/>
adult who was bookish might be less inclined to give her kinesthetic child<br/>
the freedom to use his body as much as he needs, not being able to perceive<br/>
that as learning. Child led is only a part of the picture.<br/>
<br/>
But if we define unschooling as how children *naturally* learn then we can&#39;t<br/>
say unschooling won&#39;t work because it&#39;s the same as saying children can&#39;t<br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the stumbling blocks with unschooling and learning<br/>
disabilities is that there isn&#39;t a large enough community of unschoolers of<br/>
LD kids. All the research is oriented towards kids who are expected to learn<br/>
what is taught in school, with the goal of hopefully getting them into<br/>
school. The research supports that being taught through particular methods<br/>
is what various LD kids need.<br/>
<br/>
But does that research apply to helping LD kids learn naturally? Helping<br/>
them become themselves rather than products to be fed to colleges or the<br/>
workforce?<br/>
<br/>
If we begin with the premise that kids don&#39;t need taught then the quest is<br/>
to find ways to help kids learn what they want to learn, not learn what we<br/>
think they should learn in the time we think they should learn it.<br/>
<br/>
For instance there are ways of helping dyslexic people read. But if those<br/>
ways involve coercion, regardless of how authoritative someone is, then<br/>
perhaps it&#39;s a good idea to look at the goals they are imposing on the<br/>
dyslexic.<br/>

Susan,<br/>
Ya know, I&#39;ve been thinking so much about this. It&#39;s not that I want a name<br/>
for dd&#39;s problem  (if I&#39;m accurate in assuming it *is* a problem) or a<br/>
label. I agree with your assessment of what a label can do to a kid.<br/>
I&#39;m just frozen in my boots thinking, on the one hand... maybe a<br/>
professional in that field could help my dd. On the other hand, maybe that<br/>
same professional would rake us over the coals for our unschooling<br/>
lifestyle, consider it harmful to my child and............ well it&#39;s at this<br/>
point that my imagination runs wild :(.<br/>
Sarah<br/>
  ____________________________<br/>
<br/>
Sarah:  LOL...love your &#39;frozen in boots&#39; description - I think I know how<br/>
you feel!   I&#39;ve debated and wondered whether any outsider (tutor,<br/>
&#39;professional&#39;,  friend)  may be able to offer my dd another approach.  I<br/>
still think I unintentionally pressure the poor girl to learn to read...I&#39;m<br/>
working on it!  I&#39;ve discussed it with dd.  Lately,  I&#39;ve been able to say<br/>
it in a detatched enough way (Ithink)  that she sees my input as &#39;just a<br/>
suggestion&#39;  that she can take or leave (&quot;you know, dd, if you&#39;re interested<br/>
in working on reading better,  but would rather talk to someones besides me<br/>
or your dad,  we can find someone.&quot;)  She declined and I&#39;ve let it go.<br/>
<br/>
As for wondering what a &quot;professional&quot; would think about unschooloing...that<br/>
reminds me of dh and I going to a child psychologist about one of our dd&#39;s<br/>
earlier this year.  She seemed good,  but her &#39;behavior modification&#39;<br/>
program seemed a bit too &quot;schoolish&quot;.  I wondered, too, what would she think<br/>
of our education &quot;program&quot;!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062986600">&lt;&lt;but if there is a physical problem such as dyslexia&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Exactly what is the physical problem of dyslexia?<br/>
<br/>
We are told &quot;Oh, he sees letters upside down&quot;.  If that is always the case,<br/>
then why doesn&#39;t he see triangles upside down, or music notes upside down.<br/>
Probably because there isn&#39;t a lot of pressure about triangles or music, but<br/>
a lot anxiety rests around letters.  And if the problem were because of<br/>
seeing letters flipped, then writing everything twice should fix it (Sees<br/>
&quot;A&quot; backwards so writes it backwards, then sees backwards &quot;A&quot; backwards &lt;now<br/>
back to original position&gt; and writes it correctly) but that doesn&#39;t fix the<br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
Please be very careful of buying into the terminology and pseudo-medical<br/>
practices of the educational establishment who get increased revenue based<br/>
on the number of &quot;disabled&quot; kids they have.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574318982">&lt;&lt;No in the doctor&#39;s case--he had a verified disability&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Could you explain this further?  Learning disability diagnosis is simply a<br/>
description of the fact that the person&#39;s reading level is quite a bit lower<br/>
than their IQ, it doesn&#39;t relate to &quot;cause&quot; at all.  You seem to be posting<br/>
that this disability could not be caused by stress or environmental factors<br/>
and I am very interested to know how that was established.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-608272716">&lt;&lt;Holt addresses LD&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Teach Your Own&quot; for one.  He basically says that LD could just as easily be<br/>
explained as a stress reaction, anxiety if you will, rather than as a<br/>
physical problem. I have to say I agree with him.<br/>
<br/>
Just like many people are very invested in there being a separate diagnosis<br/>
of Multiple Personality Disorder, but it can be just as easily explained by<br/>
hysteria.<br/>
<br/>
A diagnosis doesn&#39;t necessarily mean there is any physical problem, it is<br/>
just a short hand meant for doctors to communicate with each other.  A<br/>
diagnosis doesn&#39;t have a life of its own.<br/>

Nope.<br/>

Hysteria can&#39;t explain 99% of the stuff that goes on with multiple<br/>

BTW, and has been for years).<br/>

People who were goofing off in school actually may buy the idea that it&#39;s their<br/>
own fault they didn&#39;t learn anything.  They think if they had tried harder and<br/>
paid more attention they would know more today.  Not true!  The system itself<br/>
doesn&#39;t work well -- at least for me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve met a few people in their thirties that seemd to think if they had been<br/>
more mature (like a thrity year old!) when they were 14, then they would have<br/>
advanced more in their career and had more success and more goodies.  And they<br/>
are kicking themselves that they were childlike when they were children.<br/>
Hmmmm.<br/>
