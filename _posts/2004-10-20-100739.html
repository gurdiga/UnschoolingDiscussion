My ds hated to take liquids, so the dr. suggested that I go there and they could make it into a candy like a gummy.  It still tasted awful, so he just did the liquids.  Actually, it turned out he didn&#39;t need it after all, so we could stop the meds.  But, the pharmacy was so nice about trying different flavors.  They made gummy stars flavored with different types for him to try.  They all stood there watching him taste it.  They really worked on trying to get it to taste good.  It turned out to still taste so much like the medicine.  but, they can mix up any flavor for you.  I think the term is compounding pharmacy.  Some private ones do that, but not Walgreens or Eckerds.  There should be one somewhere near you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-903614971">The anti-epileptic that Celyn takes (Sabril) comes in<br/>
sachets of powder. You add 10 ml of water to each<br/>
sachet and draw up the dosage (3.5 ml in Celyn&#39;s case<br/>
twice a day).<br/>
I spoke to the doc today about using apple jiuce or<br/>
somesuch but there is a fear that if she tastes drugs<br/>
in food she may refuse all food. So far she isn&#39;t<br/>
eating any solids as she has oral aversion (because of<br/>
the drugs) and she has dropped 2 pounds in weight and<br/>
is still shrinking.<br/>
Its a real pain as should her seizures return she will<br/>
need other drugs added into her regime. She has<br/>
started to gag when she *sees* the syringe full of<br/>
meds and she now has a hyper-gag reflex that means she<br/>
vomits her milk at least once a day :-(<br/>
I also feel bad as this was the baby that was going to<br/>
be raised in a non-coercive manner from the beginning,<br/>
never see a doctor, never go to school etc etc<br/>
All my plans and dreams got a bit shattered plus it<br/>
affects the other 3, being dragged to hospital<br/>
appointments, having therapists and social workers in<br/>
our house and missing me every time Celyn is in<br/>
hospital - she was ina  total of 9 weeks over the<br/>
summer.<br/>
Well, that turned into a bit of a moan but having a<br/>
severely brain damaged baby is making me a bit moany<br/>
and upset over how things have changed.<br/>

Dear Shyrley, I&#39;m so sorry that you and your family are going through this<br/>

essential meds and her food. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you by any chance feeling her aversion when you give her her medicine?<br/>
Is she perhaps picking up your tension and guilt at having to force this on<br/>
her? So the more averse you feel, the more averse she feels, so you feel<br/>
even worse, creating an upward spiral. Maybe there are some holistic<br/>
practices or something that could help you break that cycle so you can<br/>
project calmness to her.<br/>
