<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889708110">At times people ask me about my methods of schooling. I give them <br/>
minimal information unless they want more. There&#39;s no reason to speak <br/>
of myself, it quetions their beliefs and sometimes they become <br/>
agressive. The ones that are interested will come and ask more.<br/>
<br/>
There are times when the person or people I have these discussions <br/>
with start talking about how they identify... and yes.. they think <br/>
learning should be made to be fun... (I just smile as I watch the <br/>
concept fly over their heads and hope that some of lands enough to <br/>
eventually pursue)<br/>
<br/>
Nobody has to MAKE learning fun. Nobody needs to SELL it. Or even to <br/>
find books or videos or games that have some hidden agenda of <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
The concept of sugar-coating something reminds me that something <br/>
needs sugar-coating. Like a painkiller of sorts.<br/>
<br/>
Learning IS fun when one is interested in the subject. It&#39;s a natural <br/>
part of one&#39;s life when they are not damaged by the philosophy of <br/>
sugar-coating.<br/>
