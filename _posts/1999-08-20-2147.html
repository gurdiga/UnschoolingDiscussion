 Child Will Listen And Listen So Your Child Will Talk  ? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, these are very helpful books.  Actually it&#39;s &quot;How to Talk So Kids<br/>
Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk&quot; by Adele Faber and Elaine<br/>
Mazlich, and a 20th anniversary edition will come out in Oct.  See an<br/>
interview with one of the authors in the Sep/Oct &#39;99 Growing Without<br/>
Schooling.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  told them not to involve me anymore.  If they chose to be rude and <br/>
 hurtful, not to bring it to me when it got out of control. They can <br/>
 come to me for help before it gets out of control, but if they have <br/>
 chosen to let it get to a point that they are hitting and name <br/>
 calling  and eventually crying, I don&#39;t want to hear about it.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Who DO they go to when they&#39;re out of control then?<br/>
I think that&#39;s not a good policy in general, a child desperately needs <br/>
parental assistance when they are hitting and name calling.<br/>
I don&#39;t want my kids to feel that they can&#39;t come to me at ANY time.<br/>
During a crisis especially.<br/>
