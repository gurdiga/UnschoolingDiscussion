<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but I am genuinely curious to know more about why <br/>
&gt; it appears (at least to me, for the moment) that there&#39;s a pro-gun <br/>
&gt; orientation <br/>
&gt; among experienced unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m not at all an old-timer, but I have thought for a long time <br/>
about attitudes towards guns.  One of the distinctions you might not be seeing <br/>
is the difference between rural/urban living.  My guess is that it&#39;s more of <br/>
the rural unschoolers that are finding a use for guns in their lives.  <br/>
<br/>
I grew up in a rural area (even though in many ways I&#39;m a city girl), and <br/>
guns and their counterpart, bows, were very much a part of life.  They were a <br/>
practical way to put meat on the table.  Hunting and target shooting provided <br/>
bonding for people, men especially.  My boyfriend at the time hunted and fished <br/>
nearly all seasons, often with his four adult brothers.  It gave a great excuse <br/>
to get up early and enjoy the sunrise in the woods.  And hunting and target <br/>
shooting were good practice for the boys who hoped to serve in the armed forces <br/>
or the police force.  <br/>
<br/>
Safety and respect were very important, and there was definitely a code of <br/>
honor -- city hunters were those who would take a wild shot at a deer that was <br/>
too far away or was already on the move, while good hunters were those who <br/>
worked year-round on their accuracy (and range, if they were bow hunters) and <br/>
knew, before they shot, exactly where their shot would go and how likely it would <br/>
be to bring the deer (or fox, or raccoon, etc.) down.  Good hunters knew they <br/>
had to track a bleeding animal and make sure the kill was finished.<br/>
<br/>
This is totally different from the setting for guns that gets more air play, <br/>
the urban setting.  A gun that is bought &quot;for protection&quot; is bought out of <br/>
fear, not with a purpose in mind, not with the intent of practicing and <br/>
increasing skill level, not with a real understanding of the safety issues involved -- <br/>
that kind of gun purchase is, in my mind, irresponsible.  According to <br/>
_Bowling for Columbine_, the guns that suburban dwellers buy &quot;for protection&quot; often <br/>
get sold cheaply (buy teen family members) to gang members, and that&#39;s where <br/>
some of the inner city trouble comes from.  <br/>
<br/>
For what it&#39;s worth . . .<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

&gt; play with a leather baseball glove or smear emu cream on our owies.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had more or less shared this point of view until I met an organic farmer <br/>
and herbalist who had *really* spent time among her plants, and she came to the <br/>
view that plants are just as alive as animals, even though they don&#39;t move.  <br/>
We kill something to eat, every time.  Even if we ate dirt, we&#39;d be taking it <br/>
from the plants who also need it to live.  The difference with us, though, is <br/>
that we don&#39;t know our own limits when it comes to population and what the <br/>
earth can handle as far as providing us with resources.  For a great discussion of <br/>
this, read _Ishmael_ by Daniel Quinn.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s right.  Even if we want clean drinking water we have to kill<br/>
something to get it.<br/>
It&#39;s the way things are and it&#39;s why I don&#39;t get excited about shooting<br/>
games or guns.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I agree with that. I grew up in rural Nova Scotia and guns were just another tool. Kids learned how to shoot and clean them and they weren&#39;t sexy, dark weapons. They were just what you used to put down the dog or bag a deer. That said, I&#39;m not pro gun, I don&#39;t get the NRA at all. To me a gun is a tool, not a horrible weapon (not a shotgun anyway) and not a sacred right. A matter of context? In the country they make sense, in the city, none at all. <br/>
