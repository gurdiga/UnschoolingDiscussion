<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614493017">&lt;&lt;Have you ever been bit or even chased by a dog intent on harming you?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have been chased and bitten both (not at the same time--chasers never bit). <br/>
 We lived where dogs were out, and they sometimes packed together and took <br/>
down a calf and dogs would be shot, or poisoned.   Kids bicycling would be <br/>
chased by dogs.  We learned to speed up and put our feet up toward the <br/>
handlebars until we passed the dog&#39;s property.  Dogs don&#39;t bite bicycles.  If <br/>
I saw my kids experiencing that now, I&#39;d be a nervous wreck.<br/>
<br/>
When someone suggests that someone shouldn&#39;t complain about their fear or <br/>
emotional hurt or physical pain because others have it worse I don&#39;t <br/>
associate that with mindful parenting and compassion.  If a child is unhappy <br/>
that children at school called her names, saying &quot;at least they didn&#39;t hit <br/>
you&quot; isn&#39;t sympathy.  If a child is hit by a parent with a belt, saying &quot;at <br/>
least it wasn&#39;t a razor strap&quot; is, in this day and age, in my opinion, goofy <br/>
and cruel.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are families that purposely thwart their children&#39;s peace and <br/>
happiness and compare their lives to worse lives to &quot;make them appreciate <br/>
what they have.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
A few times when I was little I said &quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot; to my mother, whose parents <br/>
had been itinerant cotton pickers and had lived through the depression, and <br/>
she said &quot;You&#39;re not hungry,&quot; or &quot;You&#39;ve never been hungry a day in your <br/>
life.&quot;  She said it with a hateful tone of voice, too.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, whatever.  I was asking for food and she was insulting me, and bragging <br/>
up her superior deprivation to shame me.  <br/>
<br/>
In a case of a dead father and an arrested mother, I don&#39;t care as much about <br/>
the finances of the value of the land as the fears and anguish of the <br/>
children.  Little kids don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s patootie how much their land is <br/>
worth.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I quit telling her I was hungry.  I didn&#39;t quit being hungry, I just quit <br/>
trusting her to care.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334343034">I&#39;ve been lurking for a bit but this thread has prompted me to speak up.  I <br/>
can&#39;t quite figure out where this post is going but I do know that chasing <br/>
dogs do bite as that is quite frequently their objective in chasing.  Were <br/>
that not so, then the statement that followed (&quot;took down a calf&quot;) would be <br/>
false.  In the interests of accuracy, chasing dogs do bite, they chase, they <br/>
bite, the calf goes down.<br/>
<br/>
But the balance is what really leaves me somewhat perplexed.  The basic web <br/>
of this fabric starts with an adult maybe, maybe not being bitten by a dog, <br/>
progresses to arguing the definitive value of the word &quot;severe,&quot; makes a <br/>
rather extravagant leap to questioning motherly concerns over an injured <br/>
child and now progresses to a valuation on parenting.  Hmmm, most <br/>
interesting, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Seems a bit convaluted, and while I am sorry that some people have <br/>
horrendous childhood memories which seem to have left deep scars, it really <br/>
has no significance on what the previous poster said.<br/>
<br/>
And now that you are all wishing I would shut up and go back to lurking, I <br/>
do have one other comment on this situation.  While it may be true that the <br/>
children &quot;don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s patootie&quot; what the land is worth, it is also <br/>
true that some of them are old enough to know and value the land and just <br/>
may, in fact, care about it and its value.  I would be inclined to think <br/>
that they do &quot;give a rat&#39;s patootie&quot; over the press and folks labeling their <br/>
mother as &quot;mentally ill&quot; and &quot;paranoid&quot; because she evidenced concern over <br/>
their home being stolen.  And, I think that is where the concern in some <br/>
posts came from, a defense of the mother&#39;s position.  Perhaps if some good <br/>
soul had taken the time to &quot;give a rat&#39;s patootie&quot; over this very issue <br/>
before it ended up in the hands of the media the children&#39;s suffering would <br/>
be limited to that felt over the loss of a parent and they would not be <br/>
suffering the added burdens of fear and anguish over loosing their home and <br/>
having their mother summarily and without due process taken from them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094242510">Dear Sandra........that is a very good point to bring out.  I have to monitor myself constantly in this area. My older boys father is multiply guilty.  Nobody has suffered like he did.  He had the biggest mosquitoes to bite him. The meanest Dad. The worst everything.  Thanks.  What a good term  &quot;superior deprivation&quot;.  May I use it? Your use of language is wonderful.<br/>
However, some dogs do bite bicycles, and cars and trucks!!  I have (1st person) seen a bulldog go round and round hanging onto the the front tire of moving car he bit! and wouldn&#39;t let go.  Dogs knocked into motorcycles causing crashes with my little brother...and they are aften big enough to jump up on the shoulders of a bicycle rider.  The ammonia in a squirt bottle that Lynda uses is a usefull idea.   We have done that since childhood.  Still, it isn&#39;t always enough re: the motocycle. And not all dogs will stop at a property line.  Especially ferral or semi-ferral  canines.  Dogs can be a realy danger!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Funny you should post this. I got hit by a dog on my bicycle last <br/>
week, he was trying to bite my front tire and took the whole bicycle <br/>
out from under me (unfortunately, I was cleated into the pedals). It <br/>
really messed me up for the whole week and my neck and hip are still <br/>
not the same. <br/>
I had a dog bite my wheel so hard once that he broke my spokes. As <br/>
someone who has spent tens of thousands of miles on bikes, I can <br/>
definitely affirm that dogs bite bicycles :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470805987">&lt;P&gt; Dear Indiana<br/>
Tami&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The<br/>
freezer for cold......works kinda of like the gel<br/>
packs for traumas.&nbsp; But I don&#39;t usually do that,<br/>
I use ice that I bang and crush inside a small towel,<br/>
or a bowl of ice water.&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 minutes on 10X<br/>
in microwave gives about 20 minutes of theraputic heat<br/>
to an arthritic or healing joint or some other achey<br/>
spot.&nbsp; My husbands back was broken in a train<br/>
derailment (the locomotive he was engineering became<br/>
airborne. It&nbsp; &quot;flew&quot; over a low-boy truck that<br/>
was stuck on a crossing, according to<br/>
witnessess.&nbsp; The angels were working<br/>
overtime.)&nbsp;a few years ago, and he uses his (the<br/>
cover has a fish appliqued on it) on the injured spot<br/>
after a day of playing with his sawmill.&nbsp;<br/>
However, that is too hot for children and babies to be<br/>
comfortable.&nbsp; It can heat the bed some before the<br/>
get in, though.&nbsp; I sometimes put a wrapped hot<br/>
water bottle in with Roy. Some folks use regular<br/>
convection ovens to heat their&#39;s......but it is less<br/>
exact as to what to expect.&nbsp; And<br/>
slower.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>
&lt;P&gt;Me too, about heating pads..........babies and<br/>
electricity are too&nbsp;too scary.&nbsp; Even BIG<br/>
babies....the tangly cords and all that ........makes<br/>
me shudder thinking about it. And the old-timey<br/>
wrapped bricks are SO hard.<br/>
&lt;P&gt;Do you put herbs in with the rice for the scent or<br/>
healing properties?&nbsp; I put bay and bergamont in<br/>
my husbands.....but left most others &quot;plain&quot;.&nbsp;<br/>
What would you recommend for different therapies? Just<br/>
the heat ones, cold wouldn&#39;t do much with scent,<br/>
though the same pillow can be used wither<br/>
way.&nbsp;(Sorry, I know you know that)<br/>

We also have &quot;the rice sock,&quot; an mateless tubesock we put instant rice in <br/>
(which also can&#39;t pop) and tied in an overhand knot.  It was a temporary one, <br/>
but it&#39;s two years old so it&#39;s not so temporary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-516792914">We have corn bags.  They&#39;re about 10&quot; square and when the corn&#39;s all <br/>
distributed it&#39;s about 1&quot; thick.  They have seed corn, all dried up and <br/>
mostly broken.  Don&#39;t use plain dried corn like popcorn for obvious reasons.  <br/>
<br/>
Microwaved for five minutes, one will stay hot for half an hour and warm for <br/>
another two or three.  They smell like Corn Pops. &lt;g&gt;  We have four of those, <br/>
all gifts made by a male friend who fights forest fires, whose parents were <br/>
hippies in Santa Fe, who is big and strong and makes his friends corn bags.<br/>

I like the corn bag idea. we have a rice sock. The hospital gave them out when I had my son in 97. we wore the first one out and have replaced it twice. I think it would be really funny to be a fly on the wall if someone used popcorn!<br/>
