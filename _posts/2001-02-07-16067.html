<br>Hi Georganne,
<br>I have a funny story about this back to school theme. Each year, right as 
<br>school is about to start, the children&#39;s shows on PBS are completely 
<br>saturated with messages about the desirability of going to school. The 
<br>children and I have been talking about advertising for a long time, and what 
<br>messages are being conveyed through the ads, so we jumped right on this one! &nbsp;
<br>&quot;Why would they be working so hard to tell the children that school is fun, 
<br>if it really was fun?&quot; &nbsp;&quot;They don&#39;t seem to have shows trying to convince us 
<br>that &#39;Parties are fun&#39; or &#39;Chocolate cake is fun&#39;.&quot; We had a great 
<br>discussion, and for weeks after that, they were chanting (in the tone of 
<br>someone trying to place a subliminal suggestion): &quot;School is fun. School is 
<br>fun.&quot;

<br/>
That is so profoundly true!<br/>
<br/>
Holly is nine, and with no schoolmates to forbid her to do it, she watches <br/>
Dragontales and really likes it.  She asked me to see if there was a CD of <br/>
the songs available, so I went to the PBS kids site, and read the <br/>
teached/parent/caretaker (I think they called it caretaker) page on it and <br/>
was surprised to see that it is designed to prepare kids for school.  I told <br/>
her that (not in a scary or &quot;don&#39;t watch it way&quot; but in a &quot;this surprises me&quot; <br/>
way).  She was surprised too, but we talked about it, and it does seem to be <br/>
heavy on emotional preparation for competition and losing, or gracious <br/>
winning, and making friends (and possibly failing).<br/>
<br/>
Sad...</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664131913">OK, true confession, I am a General Hospital junkie!!  Anyone who <br/>
knows me knows that this is my one THING on TV!  But I have to tell <br/>
you how funny I find the commercials.  The first commercial I <br/>
encounter is very big busted women showing off their Victoria&#39;s <br/>
Secret bras (lots of cleavage and things like feathers on their big, <br/>
seductive lips!) then I&#39;m treated to dancing tampons after that (I&#39;ve <br/>
never actually seen tampons make water-ballet formations, but it is <br/>
amuzing), then I&#39;m shown how I can be a better mom by getting my <br/>
clothes whiter & brighter or how wonderful I&#39;d be if I only chose the <br/>
right peanut butter!  Bloussant commercials do show me how to <br/>
increase my bustline but I&#39;ve already taken care of that through <br/>
pregnancy and nursing!!  And, based on these commercials, you&#39;d never <br/>
think that someone like me could attract a man wearing cotton Wal-<br/>
Mart underwear, using maxi-pads, or washing white underwear and blue <br/>
jeans in the same load!!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Hooked on Phonics, gotta love that!!  Not only do your children <br/>
get treated to hours and years of learning to read in school, but you <br/>
can spend hundreds of dollars on that product to make them even <br/>
better readers!!  Being of the John Holt unschooling mind, some of us <br/>
have children that have actually learned to read, spell, and <br/>
comprehend it all within minimal instruction and no fees!  Amazing!<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d share a laugh on-line!</div>

Hi, my kids too always comment on the Learn to Read type commercials and the <br/>
commercials usually mention school. Like &quot;now Johnny is getting better grades <br/>
in school&quot;. My daughter remarked how ironic it is that schools are not <br/>
teaching kids to read so parents have to go looking for a way to teach them <br/>
at home. At least that is what the commercials are really saying. <br/>
