<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581486025">I have this wonderful story to tell about my partner.<br/>
<br/>
Beth is a Director of a Regional Office of a Girl Scout Council, and part of <br/>
her job entails working with other community organizations that serve youth. <br/>
Last night she was meeting at a nearby library with a bunch of people from <br/>
the library, local schools, and other youth organizations to discuss <br/>
developing programs for youth who aren&#39;t using the current programs.<br/>
<br/>
The meeting started out badly for Beth, as one librarian was discussing how <br/>
wonderful it was that she could call a local principal to discuss a kid she <br/>
was having behavioral problems and that the principal was able to identify <br/>
the kid. Beth&#39;s thought was that all this meant was the principal was able to <br/>
list &quot;troublemakers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As they discussed program, Beth kept asking, &quot;Why aren&#39;t you asking these <br/>
youth what they want?&quot; Turned out they DO plan to ask some youth: They have <br/>
an event for feedback planned where they&#39;ll ask Student Council president, <br/>
Key Club president, etc....  In short, Mid- to upper-class white kids who are <br/>
already involved.<br/>
<br/>
The meeting continued like this, with one guy complaining about a group of <br/>
kids skateboarding outside the library rather than using the Skate Park.  <br/>
(&quot;Have there been any problems?&quot; No. &quot;Any complaints from library patrons?&quot; <br/>
No. &quot;Anyone asked them why they prefer to skate here?&quot; Nope.)<br/>
<br/>
Then they talked about how to &quot;authoritatively communicate with parents about <br/>
how to discipline and set parameters.&quot; At this point Beth (who is a very <br/>
mellow, sweet person) told them that the parents knew their kids better than <br/>
any of them do. Etc.<br/>
<br/>
She suspects she won&#39;t be invited back. :)<br/>
<br/>
She came home and said, &quot;I think unschooling has ruined me for that stuff.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Beth was totally on board with taking Julian out of school.  Over time she&#39;s <br/>
rid herself of her urges to make Julian do dioramas (she has a degree in <br/>
Education) and other &quot;educational activities.&quot; She&#39;s even stopped being <br/>
concerned entirely that he might not be learning.<br/>
<br/>
But I think last night she became an Unschooler. LOL<br/>

<br/>
Isn&#39;t it wonderful, watching the transformation!<br/>
<br/>
This is happening with my husband,  he&#39;ll call me from the road and make<br/>
some comments about main stream this or that.   I&#39;ll have to say,  &quot;honey,<br/>
you&#39;re sounding like me!&quot;    Reluctance steps aside to proof and reason!<br/>
