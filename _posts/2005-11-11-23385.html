If you  get divorced, it will all be over, and horrible.   Your child could  <br/>
end up with steparents who were against homeschooling.   Don&#39;t  go that way.  <br/>
  <br/>
Unschooling is not worth the loss of a family,  and honestly, with the loss <br/>
of <br/>
the family, unschooling is almost always  gone forever as well.<br/>

*********Speaking as a divorced unschooler, I can say that life offers you  a <br/>
big set of &quot;challenges&quot; when you decide to keep the children at home after a  <br/>
divorce.  Russ (former husband) didn&#39;t oppose the kids learning at home  (our <br/>
divorce came long after the kids were learning at home), but he also did  <br/>
everything in his power to make things hard for me financially, making my  <br/>
situation extremely difficult.  Let&#39;s just say he got the family home  (which is big <br/>
anywhere and HUGE here in So. CA), and I was paying child support  for a <br/>
while.  That never made sense, but it added to the burden.<br/>
 <br/>
When you have a supportive husband the situation can be different.  An  <br/>
acquaintance of mine is divorced and he totally financially supports his wife  and <br/>
two young children so that the kids can remain at home to learn.   Needless to <br/>
say I told him I loved him!!  :-)<br/>
 <br/>
Often husbands just need some time to get used to the idea.  Russ was  a <br/>
military man and didn&#39;t have the peer support that I did (thro LLLeague and my  <br/>
un/homeschooling park group).  Gradually he read things I left in the  bathroom, <br/>
or would listen to me when I would share things that I had read.   He saw how <br/>
happy we all were in our lifestyle.  Later he became my biggest  supporter.  <br/>
I gave him material to &quot;brag&quot; about.  Maybe it wasn&#39;t  traditional, but since <br/>
he wasn&#39;t with the kids nearly as much as I was, it was  difficult for him to <br/>
know what the kids were learning and doing.  I also  asked him to help with <br/>
some projects that the kids wanted to do that were fun -  and things he liked.<br/>
 <br/>
The divorce was difficult enough, if Russ had been forcing the school  issue, <br/>
I can&#39;t imagine the hell we would have to have lived through.  <br/>
 <br/>
Flexibility is a difficult trait to exhibit when you are passionate  about an <br/>
issue, but often if you can step back and approach with love and  peace in <br/>
your actions and heart, you won&#39;t need to make huge changes in your  ideas.  <br/>
When I was young everything was black or white.  Now  I live in many shades of <br/>
gray ----<br/>
 <br/>
I second Sandra&#39;s statement - the marriage is the first priority - <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-417820140">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
 Something we like to do is explore whatever my daughter is into with books, including fiction, and movies. We have never really done the whole unit study thing, we just do what she feels like. She finds writing very difficult so we usually don&#39;t do much along those lines. Sometimes I wish we were making something that could go into a portfolio, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work that way. I have two daughters who have unschooled all the way through and now are in college. They didn&#39;t have portfolios and didn&#39;t seem to need them, but sometimes I wish I had something as a memento of our years of learning. This isn&#39;t really a problem or even a question. I am just wondering what other families on the list do in this area.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, she is currently interested in the French Revolution. She heard some comments about Marie Antoinette after the recent statements made by Barbara Bush about the Katrina evacuees and that sparked her interest. (It&#39;s always amazing to me to see how things things get started!) We are going to read Tale of Two Cities by Dickens. Does anyone out there have any other suggestions? I looked for a DVD of it and I haven&#39;t found one in the local stores yet. We like to read a book and then see the movie, if there is one, and then talk about how they compare. My daughter is 13 and a very good reader, with these more challenging books we usually do a combination of reading aloud together and reading on our own. Most often I read at least the first chapter to her and then she reads more later when I am doing something else. Then I have to catch up and then we read the next bit aloud again. It seems to promote discussion to do it that way and it&#39;s so fun!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-993643619">If you want to do a Dickens novel and then the movie, I recommend Nicholas <br/>
Nickleby.   The movie that came out a few years back is really sweet, and the <br/>
book itself brought about some impressive social reforms in its day.   You can <br/>
find that info with google or get a newish copy of the book in which such <br/>
things might be discussed in intros or notes.<br/>

There&#39;s also a movie coming out soon (a new one, there are others) of Oliver <br/>
Twist, I believe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-98010001">Hi Sandra,<br/>
Thanks! We saw Oliver in the theatre and it&#39;s really good. It&#39;s pretty scary so it&#39;s probably not recommended for younger kids, but we loved it. I have read Nicholas Nickleby but my daughter hasn&#39;t. We&#39;ll try that after we&#39;ve exhausted this French Revolution interest. Thanks for suggesting the film, it&#39;s always good to get an endorsement from someone you trust!<br/>

Les Miserables is a wonderful book and musical.  I don&#39;t know how historically accurate it is.  I think it is supposed to take place shortly before the French Revolution?<br/>

This site has the book online with reviews and such:<br/>

What a great resource, I hadn&#39;t heard of this site before. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
I am familiar with IMDB, and you&#39;re sure right, it&#39;s very useful. We live in Seattle and we&#39;ve had a lot of fun finding movies that were made in this area and other places we have been. We went to London in September and we watched several &quot;filmed in London&quot; movies before we went.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280629250">We have Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe and Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson both illustrated by N.C.

My Mom got both for Jack and even though he isn&#39;t much of a reader (and I never thought he would touch books like these), he read both condensed editions and loved them both. He probably wouldn&#39;t have understood or liked the original versions at his age, but I think now he won&#39;t be as likely to pass them by later in life. And he probably won&#39;t be a put off by the language. Usually, I&#39;m not a fan of condensed versions of books. I don&#39;t like the &#39;cliff note&#39; take on any book, but that is just me.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-442847372">Do you know Welsh? Does anyone? Darin&#39;s Grandfather was Welsh, and we have been searching family names to see if any particular one jumps out at us for the baby. Problem is I can&#39;t pronounce half of them and don&#39;t like the ones I can. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
We want to give the baby family names. My Mom&#39;s middle name is Evelyn and my Dad&#39;s is White.

Gaelic spelling/pronunciation is pretty regular once you know <br/>
the &quot;rules&quot;. You needn&#39;t pronounce the names correctly to enjoy the <br/>
book, of course, but if you wanted to take a stab at more authentic <br/>
pronunciations you could check <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.daire.org/names/notes.html#scots">http://www.daire.org/names/notes.html#scots</a> (or similar) -- or email <br/>
me a list. I studied Gaelic for years and could give you pronunciation <br/>
hints.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-152988979">***Even if you can pronounce it, others need to be able to do so.   ***<br/>
<br/>
My brother named his second daughter Gwynydd (pronounced Gwyneth) and is<br/>
now very frustrated when people ask about little Gwinid.  &lt;g&gt;    <br/>
<br/>
They were kinder to their first daughter and named her Caitlyn.  Cait<br/>
(Kate) seems pretty easy.   My brother&#39;s name is Joe, by the way.  He&#39;s<br/>
the only one of us bothered to learn Welsh and now it seems his kids are<br/>
going to pay for it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
On my dad&#39;s side of the family there were Lloyds and Llewellyns and<br/>
Eulas.  One of my brother got Llewellyn as a middle name, poor bastard.  <br/>
Where does the insanity end?  Not with me, it turns out, I named my son<br/>
Dylan. &lt;g&gt;   I thought everyone would know the pronunciation because of<br/>
the poet Dylan Thomas or at least because of Bob Dylan.  Not so.  People<br/>
still say Dye linn.    I suggested Dylan be kinder to his children and<br/>
name them Bob and Sam and he said he was leaning toward Rasputin or<br/>
Methuselah. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-395618676">Thank you Joyce. The list helps me lots. I actually did find another online. I think my problem goes back to that ole evil phonics. &lt;g&gt; I *learned* to read at home, before I went to school. Then I started school a year early and not because I was necessarily extraordinarily smart, but because my Mom never went to Kindergarten and didn&#39;t know when I was supposed to start. And because we lived in Iran at the time. And because all of her friends who had kids around my age were going, so I went too. The school I went to was a company founded American school and was more like a co-op play group. (too bad they aren&#39;t all like that) When we got back to the states I was *ahead* so to speak in some ways of my peers but seriously lacking when it came to phonics. I couldn&#39;t wrap my mind around the phonics. It didn&#39;t make sense to me and I still don&#39;t get it. Most times I wait on judgment on a word/name until I hear someone say it. Even then I&#39;m hesitant since many people pronounce different<br/>
 words/names different ways.  <br/>
