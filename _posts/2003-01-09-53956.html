<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We just added a David Gutterson book to our arsenal of unschooling/natural<br/>
&gt; learning materials for our resource table at the weekly group get together.<br/>
&gt; What a voice!  The very first thing that caught my eye was how school is such<br/>
&gt; a driving force in our society...I&#39;ll have to read more later.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is that Family Matters: Why Homeschooling Makes Sense, or did he write<br/>
another one?  <br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s a nosy, probably none of my business whatsoever kind of question,<br/>
but I&#39;ve been wondering if he continued teaching high school English after<br/>
his wonderful book Snow Falling On Cedars did so well, or if he&#39;s gone to<br/>
full time writing and homeschooling these days?  Just curious.<br/>
