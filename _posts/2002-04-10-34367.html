<div id="ygrps-yiv-817596200">Did anyone watch &quot;Shackleton&quot; on A&E?<br/>
<br/>
I had read his book &quot;South&quot; so I was pumped.  My older kids (11 and 8) got<br/>
into it as well.  We ended up staying up late, eating popcorn, having out<br/>
the globe to follow the exploits.  (Our globe even has Shackleton&#39;s base<br/>
camp denoted which was cool).  I showed the kids some of the pictures in<br/>
&quot;South&quot; and we saw the scenes that matched the pictures exactly (like the<br/>
officers washing the galley floor).  It made it all seem very real.<br/>
<br/>
Dh taped the second night for us because we had karate and so now even the<br/>
little guys are watching the daring do over and over.  Everyone is running<br/>
around saying &quot;Bloody hell&quot; in our best English accents which sent us off<br/>
laughing over other English sayings we have heard friends from the UK use.<br/>
It has been fun.<br/>

information! Found lots at the PBS website.<br/>

If you have an IMAX theater near you, there&#39;s an IMAX movie out now called<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-8744982">We saw the Shackleton show on PBS and have glanced at a book about him (I <br/>
think it has Endurance in the title).  I read a book last year that was <br/>
similar to the Shackleton story except it took place in the Arctic and the <br/>
captain abandoned the crew.  It was a true story. I can&#39;t think of the name <br/>
of it right now.<br/>
