<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928675799">Hi Nanci,<br/>
<br/>
Glad you asked about Melaleuca.  Basically all I do is set up accounts<br/>
for the company and they pay me for that, they deliver the products,<br/>
they handle the money (I have no inventory, paperwork or money to keep<br/>
track of).  I look for a need, I often talk to parents.  Parents,<br/>
especially families of young children NEED this product, I joined when<br/>
my son was two.  I&#39;m so glad I did!  I&#39;ve been sharing it with folks who<br/>
are looking for these products and/or need extra money with a business<br/>
that make complete sense.   (feel free to e-mail me directly so I can<br/>
give you the benifit of hearing about this fully and properly)<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I&#39;m Pagan too.  I also attend a United Methodist Church with<br/>
a Pagan friendly Pastor (he knows I Pagan)<br/>
<br/>
See ya, I&#39;m helping a friend at a yard sale.<br/>
<br/>
