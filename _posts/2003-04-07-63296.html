<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That&#39;s the problem here. I haven&#39;t seen where anyone here has not been<br/>
&gt; treated with consideration and respect. What I&#39;ve seen as problems with a<br/>
&gt; few of you is that you want to be validated as loving parents and treated<br/>
&gt; with kids gloves until you are all &quot;ready to unschool.&quot; It&#39;s been explained<br/>
&gt; here that there really isn&#39;t the time or need of the majority for that kind<br/>
&gt; of list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, I don&#39;t think anyone is looking for their validation as a loving <br/>
parent on this list, nor are they asking to be treated with kids gloves.<br/>
<br/>
BUT when someone makes an introduction telling us about her children, where <br/>
they have come from educationally, where they are now in their learning style <br/>
and where they hope to be sooner than later that is not looking for <br/>
validation as a parent.  It is what is requested in an introduction.<br/>
<br/>
It is done not for validation but to introduce one&#39;s self to a list that is <br/>
posting and they are reading, so as to avoid that &quot;peeking tom&quot; syndrome of <br/>
sorts.<br/>
<br/>
What started this entire thread was a new person stating that they expected <br/>
criticism because they KNEW they weren&#39;t doing everything right yet and then <br/>
someone else added they don&#39;t feel this is a safe place to ask questions that <br/>
are VALID to them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of the exact same advice should to like well, if you don&#39;t like <br/>
the fact that a new family isn&#39;t completely doing the unschooling your way, <br/>
be quiet and READ, wait for them to post, WAIT for them to ASK a question, <br/>
get to know what they NEED from you as a part of the group, THEN offer your <br/>
advice on unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
An introduction is hardly the place for someone to be shot down with &quot;nope <br/>
you are NOT unschooling&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the whole thing started because others must have felt it was a harsh <br/>
response and I totally get the idea we are under NO obligation to be polite, <br/>
molly coddle or hand hold with anyone.  But to some who haven&#39;t been around <br/>
it does seem very harsh to someone just starting out on the journey to just <br/>
flat out tell them they aren&#39;t doing it right, in fact they aren&#39;t &quot;doing it&quot; <br/>
at all.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s sorta like shooting a dream I guess.  We all aspire to be good parents <br/>
and do the absolute best for our child, I think that is the bottom line.<br/>
<br/>
Now here&#39;s my point we are getting no where with this thread.  So we know <br/>
that some people can &quot;appear&quot; to be rough, short and hateful, doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
they really are.<br/>
<br/>
Some people can appear to be unschooling, doesn&#39;t really mean they are.<br/>
<br/>
Either we get thick skins and when someone appears to criticize from either <br/>
point of view we ignore it, delete it or walk away or we just accept that is <br/>
how some people are and we get on with the process of being the best <br/>
unschooling family we can possibly be.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing about this thread is going to change anything about anyone.  I&#39;ve <br/>
questioned and thought and pondered trying to come up with the exact dynamics <br/>
that will make this group work for me, and me work for this group, because <br/>
after all we do have to fit in our environment, even one we&#39;ve entered <br/>
willingly.  I have no answers. It&#39;s the same as it was last week, it&#39;s the <br/>
same as it as last month, it&#39;s the same as it will be next week and next <br/>
month and next year.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I&#39;ve figured out is forget it, don&#39;t talk about it, ask a <br/>
specific question take the answer or don&#39;t.  Don&#39;t expect it the answer to <br/>
sound kind and loving because no one is owed kindness or loving or maybe you <br/>
are just &quot;reading&quot; the words too hatefully your own self.<br/>
<br/>
Like it or leave it, this is it.  There are mothers here who know the deal, <br/>
they&#39;ve lived it, they&#39;ve proved it works their way and there is only one <br/>
true way to unschool and they can show you that way but only if you are <br/>
willing to do what they say and forget all your preconceived notions about <br/>
what unschooling might mean to you.  It doesn&#39;t work any other way.<br/>
<br/>
There are many brilliant ideas, many things I&#39;ve never even thought of, many <br/>
things I have that didn&#39;t have a name for now do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The list is what it is and I accept it for what it is, I was never trying to <br/>
&quot;change&quot; anything, just figure out how to adapt and adjust and I think I&#39;ve <br/>
learned the way.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all the useful info and I think this thread was helpful too. <br/>
 It helped explore the dynamics and gave a glimpse into human nature and how <br/>
it works.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s probably NOT true. It might not make any difference in YOUR world, but <br/>
the fact IS that it may have been JUST what someone else needed to hear. <br/>
THAT&#39;s why this list works. Maybe not for you and maybe not for the next guy, <br/>
but it might have reached a dozen or so folks that will come around in a week <br/>
or month---or tomorrow! And the light bulb is now LIT!<br/>
<br/>
Another thing it does is to help folks who &quot;get&quot; unschooling, but who haven&#39;t <br/>
quite been able to put it into words. This (although tiresome for those that <br/>
do it 7-8 times a year!) can be what helps those people be able to articulate <br/>
unschooling to friends and relatives---and husbands! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As we&#39;ve all learned with unschooling, often what we learn isn&#39;t what we <br/>
expected to learn! &lt;g&gt; <br/>

&lt;&lt;  It is what is requested in an introduction. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think a list with 1100 people even needs introductions.   <br/>
On some lists I&#39;ve been on, people have gotten huffy if they didn&#39;t get a <br/>
dozen &quot;Welcome to the list!&quot; messages, and when they leave they want to stay <br/>
on long enough for people to say nice things.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t that kind of a list.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, sure, people can announce their comings and goings, but it&#39;s not a <br/>
teaparty.  It&#39;s a huge impersonal sort of list.  <br/>
<br/>
If you go hear Billy Graham (bad example, but I&#39;ll leave it) you don&#39;t say <br/>
&quot;Hi!&quot; (from row 203) &quot;I&#39;m here!&quot; and wait for everyone to say &quot;Hi!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is a list where lurking is fine.  Nobody will go down the member list <br/>
and draw people out saying, &quot;Hi, and who are YOU?  Never saw an introduction <br/>
from you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is done not for validation but to introduce one&#39;s self to a list that is <br/>
posting and they are reading, so as to avoid that &quot;peeking tom&quot; syndrome of <br/>
sorts.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not applicable to a list this large.  I assume five or ten people come and go <br/>
each day, and if they all said hi and bye and got responses that would be ALL <br/>
the list was about.<br/>

<br/>
I have advice.  Proofread.<br/>
Take your time and think and proofread if you feel that this list just can&#39;t <br/>
survive without your continuing input.<br/>
<br/>
And my other advice is to get over the false idea that you know more about <br/>
how this list needs to be than those who have been involved for years.<br/>
<br/>

Joyce, could you please consider putting rubyprincess on moderated status?  <br/>
Please don&#39;t let any more of these time-wasting posts through for a while.<br/>

This group is not about you. <br/>
It&#39;s about unschooling.<br/>
If an unschooling group can&#39;t work for you, scoot.<br/>
