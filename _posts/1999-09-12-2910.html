<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082153253">Hi guys, <br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate if you change subjects (esp..drastically) that you<br/>
change the subject title. I just pulled up a note on &#39;typing&#39; and it was<br/>
all about little  kids wearing their underwear in expressive ways. Cute but<br/>
not about typing...<br/>
<br/>
I get soooooooo much mail and it helps me to get through it all in less<br/>
than ...hours. Thanks so much...greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
