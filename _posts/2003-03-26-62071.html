<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010723214">Hi,<br/>
It is me Maureen, the lurker in Prince George B.C. I have been having an interesting time lurking and it has been the difference between doubting myself and unschooling to now feeling much more confident about our life choice. I still want to continue reading emails but I was away for a day and a half and I came home to 477 emails most from the group. How do I still get to be  in touch but not have so much mail. Can someone help!!<br/>

I just was away for several days.  The last time, I came home to 879<br/>
messages!  It took me days to catch up.  This time I went to the website and<br/>
set my high-traffic lists to nomail.  When I came back, I read the threads<br/>
that interested me on the web.  What I found was that it&#39;s easier to skip<br/>
posts on the website because it&#39;s such a hassle to read there.  I was caught<br/>
up in a day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Boy, can I relate!  :-)  This is such a wonderful list, and I don&#39;t want to <br/>
miss anything, but sometimes I have to pick and choose.  I use the sort <br/>
feature on my server so that all of my messages are bunched together by their <br/>
subject line.  Then I simply delete those, wholesale, that don&#39;t appear to <br/>
hold much interest for me.  Most of the time I&#39;ll read the first message in a <br/>
thread to make sure that it really isn&#39;t something I want or need to follow.  <br/>
When I&#39;m really pressed for time, I have to get pretty ruthless with this, <br/>
knowing that I&#39;m still missing some interesting conversation, but I figure <br/>
it&#39;s like being at a really great party -- I can&#39;t be a part of every <br/>
fascinating conversation that&#39;s going on!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some people like the digest which puts 20 or so emails into one email.<br/>
They&#39;re easier to scan through to skip stuff but harder to reply to. You can<br/>
switch by sending an email to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-digest@yahoogroups.com">Unschooling-dotcom-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> If<br/>
want to switch back you send an email to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-normal@yahoogroups.com">Unschooling-dotcom-normal@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I like the thread/sort feature too. With Outlook Express it&#39;s under View.<br/>
