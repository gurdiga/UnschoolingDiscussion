<div id="ygrps-yiv-655781011">One of my best friends has 3 children -- one just turned seven and <br/>
is finishing first grade, another age 4 in preschool, and a 2-yr <br/>
old.  Although our 4-yr old girls are almost exactly the same age, <br/>
they have never really been friends and Morgaine plays better with <br/>
the older girl.  She was thrilled when the older girl invited her to <br/>
a campfire birthday party with all her school friends ... well when <br/>
we got there, Morgaine started playing with her new toys and the <br/>
older girl said, &quot;You can&#39;t play with those!  I took them out for me <br/>
and my friends to play!&quot;  Without thinking I jumped in as Morgaine&#39;s <br/>
face crumpled ... &quot;You invited Morgaine to your party Liv.  She is <br/>
your friend.&quot;  &quot;No, I invited her so my sister could have someone to <br/>
play with.&quot;  Morgaine was crushed and I was angry and sad, but I <br/>
backed off and let things alone.  I gave her the option to stay by <br/>
herself (as planned), for me to stay with her, or to come home.  <br/>
When she settled down she decided to stay by herself.  <br/>
<br/>
I was a little nervous when I picked her up -- it was her first drop-<br/>
off party and hadn&#39;t started well -- but she had a great time.  She <br/>
had made friends with one of the other girls and also gone into the <br/>
house with my friend&#39;s other daughter for a while.  She was filthy <br/>
and full and so proud of herself.  I had left her there in such <br/>
frustration, because as my friends&#39; children have gone off to public <br/>
school it&#39;s mostly the moms who create that &quot;ageism,&quot; and it has <br/>
hurt Morgaine time and again to be excluded by her older friends, <br/>
but she worked it out.  Next time I&#39;ll try to stay out of it <br/>
altogether.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, also when the other 4-yr old girl challenged her -- &quot;You still a <br/>
baaa-by.  I a big girl; I go to school,&quot;  Morgaine shot back, &quot;No, <br/>
that&#39;s because I go to homeschool and I get to learn all the time.&quot;  <br/>
It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve heard her not sound defensive about not <br/>
being in school.  Step by step we&#39;re getting there. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me share.  This was such a big event for us <br/>
both ... <br/>
