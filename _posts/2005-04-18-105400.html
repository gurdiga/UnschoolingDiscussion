<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048898165">I&#39;m looking for someone who has experience in running a Snitz Forum, to <br/>
help out on the technical end of maintaining the unschooling.info <br/>
message boards.<br/>
<br/>
If anybody might be able to lend a hand (it won&#39;t be much - the forum <br/>
is up and running and, so far, maintenance free - but I&#39;d like to make <br/>
a modification that I haven&#39;t been able to figure out on my own) - <br/>
please contact me OFFLIST!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
