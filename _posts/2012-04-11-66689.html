<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083169956">just a sort of wave out. I have been here for just about 14 years or so, on and off,  but had to take a break from groups as I was spending wayyyyy to much time reading through them.lol. Anyway I missed reading through them , so now I am back. I am a Sahm Wife and Unschooling Mama of five. Tyler , our oldest is 14 and decided to go to highschool this year and is doing GREAT mark wise, but is realizing that its a big old waste of his time and wants to come back home and &quot;get on with life already&quot; lol He was/is unschooled his entire life, but then went right into advanced level highschool and didnt even bat an eye. AND he talks to other people! &lt; insert eye roll here&gt; anyway, lol, Ashleigh is 12, Heather is 10 , Oliver is 6 and Emily-Rose is 19 months. I look forward to sharing and learning with you all.<br/>
Many Blessings<br/>

Where were you reading fourteen years ago?  <br/>
(This discussion is 10.5 years old, but came out of some others, some defunct.  Was it unschooling.com?)<br/>
<br/>
Too much reading can take away from time being with kids, but too little reading can be a problem, too.<br/>
