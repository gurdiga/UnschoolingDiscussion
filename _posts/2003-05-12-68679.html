**I was not going to say he could not play it but wanted to try to<br/>
 figure out how to explain to him what I did not like about it - it was one<br/>
of those<br/>
 games where you are behind the gun and go around shooting people who start<br/>
spurting<br/>
 blood). But before I could post, I realized that he had stopped playing<br/>
it.**<br/>
<br/>
Same thing happened to us.<br/>
<br/>
I was also feeling this way about Grand Theft Auto: Vice City<br/>
<br/>
My 10 ds,  wanted to rent it,  so we did.       I was watching him play it<br/>
and in part of it you kill people in different ways.   One was you could<br/>
beat them with a golf club,  the blood comes out onto the pavement.<br/>
Ewwww,,,it really bothered me.   You can keep beating this person.  Sent<br/>
chills down my spine.   The kids see it so differently though,  seeing it so<br/>
much as a game and such.<br/>
<br/>
Well,  I was sitting there with knots in my stomach,  trying to figure out<br/>
how to talk with them about how I was feeling.   They lost interest.   The<br/>
part they liked was driving vehicles around.  They played it maybe for 2<br/>
hours and then put in Spyro.  Alec said it really wasn&#39;t very exciting.<br/>
(Although I liked the music it played,  &lt;g&gt; all this 80&#39;s stuff from high<br/>
school).<br/>
<br/>
So he decided on his own that it wasn&#39;t worth his time.   I didn&#39;t get to<br/>
talk with him about it very much,  which I&#39;m wondering now if I should.<br/>
But now its gone.   I might bring it up sometime,  why it did bother me, but<br/>
I dodn&#39;t want him to feel guilty for playing it.<br/>
<br/>
I am so realizing that we are all sensitive to different things.   He wasn&#39;t<br/>
bothered by Vice City,  but then really had a hard time watching Robin Hood:<br/>
Prince of Thieves,  (I had mentioned this before on this list).<br/>
<br/>
It does show how much we can truly trust our children.    It blows me away<br/>
that I never knew this before we started unschooling.   Had never been<br/>
exposed to this kind-of thinking.  Its so radical for so many people.<br/>
Unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really wish more people knew this.  Some more shouting from the rooftops!<br/>
&quot;YOU CAN TRUST YOUR CHILDREN!&quot;   &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>

I have a 23 year old son, who was with me until he was 14, and then <br/>
went to live with his dad. (cutting a LOOONG, bitter story short) His <br/>
dad&#39;s family is poisonous, and I really didn&#39;t want him there. My mom <br/>
tried taking him for awhile, but he wanted his dad and his dad&#39;s <br/>
family. (more cutting) dad&#39;s sister introduced him to Meth :( and he <br/>
ended up in prison for three years, from age 17 to age 20. And WENT <br/>
TO LIVE WITH HIS DAD&#39;S FAMILY!!!!! and I was in anguish, but my wise <br/>
dad said &quot;He&#39;s an adult. His choice. His life. Let him choose and <br/>
leave him be. We don&#39;t have to agree, and we are allowed to tell him <br/>
so, but it&#39;s HIS life.&quot; And so I swallowed my tongue and developed an <br/>
ulcer, hating that he had gone to his paternal gramma&#39;s house...(six <br/>
more months passed)<br/>
<br/>
He was able to see, without my nagging him and fretting at him, with <br/>
his own two eyes, how chaotic and dysfunctional his dad&#39;s family is, <br/>
and he moved out of there ON HIS OWN. I didn&#39;t tell him to, I didn&#39;t <br/>
ask him to. He just DID IT. Still goes over and says hello, but will <br/>
never move in over there EVER again. And if I&#39;d had my way, he&#39;d <br/>
moved in with us, or with my mom and dad, and still been craving his <br/>
dad&#39;s family...<br/>
