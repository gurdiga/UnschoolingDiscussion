I haven&#39;t used the site myself and I heard about it from people who are not unschoolers so I&#39;m not sure how appropriate the recommendation is, but thought I would offer it in case you wanted to check it out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878332007">Hi, I&#39;m currently learning Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite things to do read/watch/play the Japanese versions of my favorite English books/manga/movies/computer games/etc. Youtube is a great resource for this. I have found things like the Japanese versions of Disney movies and Pirates of the Caribbean and other popular western movies as well as popular Japanese songs. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258396216">Here&#39;s something a friend sent me this morning!  I had played with  <br/>
setting it to different accents in English (and being a little miffed  <br/>
that &quot;UK&quot; and &quot;American&quot; aren&#39;t further differentiated into regions),  <br/>
but I went back and found it will do German, too!  With seven  <br/>
different voices.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s not conversation, but it can pronounce words.<br/>

<br/>
Pretty fun.  There are 26 languages there.<br/>
There are interesting &quot;misfires,&quot; and it&#39;s fun to wonder why.   It&#39;s  <br/>
just a toy, not the answer to all questions of pronunciation, but it&#39;s  <br/>
a cute toy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010163446">I used and liked Rosetta Stone online, free through our local library (but I could use it at home), when I wanted to brush up a little on German.  Now our library uses something else, which I&#39;ve not tried.  In any case, you could look there.  I don&#39;t think my German is good enought to chat with anyone. <br/>
<br/>
Also, about 13 years ago I saw a foreign-language &quot;newspaper&quot; that came in German and was purposely written at an intermediate level.  I think it was mostly marketed to schools and teachers, and I don&#39;t remember what it was called, but maybe you could search for that.<br/>

Key Words reading books in Arabic, and recently both my parents got a good<br/>
start in French by reading the Harry Potter books in French - book in one<br/>
hand, dictionary in the other. By the time my mother reached the end of the<br/>
second book she was hardly using the dictionary - and they both thoroughly<br/>
enjoyed reading the books as well.<br/>
<br/>
You can fairly easily build up a good vocabulary that way, and develop a<br/>
feeling for the patterns and grammar of the language.<br/>

<br/>
I think the American equivalent of Ladybird would be Usborne (their  <br/>
picture vocabulary books). It&#39;s possible to get Ladybird books through  <br/>
import, and nowadays the internet  makes it almost easy.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk">http://www.amazon.co.uk</a><br/>
<br/>
If you search ladybird and german, there are some stories and  <br/>
folktales in German, and will be fairly easy reading levels probably.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-110972444">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I am from Germany and I heard about Radical Unschooling by reading the german magazin &quot;Unerzogen&quot; (www.unerzogen-magazin.de). They are discussing about natural/free learning, peaceful parenting, radical unschooling etc. Maybe that would be interesting for her? There is also a Yahoogroup which is quite active and growing! (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://de.groups.yahoo.com/group/unerzogen/)">http://de.groups.yahoo.com/group/unerzogen/)</a> <br/>
<br/>
There are mostly adults, but they might have children who would be interested in chatting with an english-speaking young unschooler. The magazin has free articles, e.g. here. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unerzogen-magazin.de/aktuelle_ausgabe/?view=ad&aid=181.">http://www.unerzogen-magazin.de/aktuelle_ausgabe/?view=ad&aid=181.</a> <br/>
There is even a group for kids (Unerzogen for children), but it is not very active. However, they might be interested in chatting: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://de.groups.yahoo.com/group/unerzogen-graswurzel/">http://de.groups.yahoo.com/group/unerzogen-graswurzel/</a><br/>
<br/>
Unerzogen has special days for chatting as well, on Mondays and Thursdays at 8 pm CEST, see here www.unerzogen.de.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if she has more questions, please contact me directly. I would love to help by creating international friendships!<br/>
