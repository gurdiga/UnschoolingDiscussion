Long, but worth the read, this article examines homeschooling as a trend<br/>
toward free agency in education that parallels a similar trend in the<br/>
workforce. Both the article and the editor&#39;s note are overwhelmingly positive<br/>
regarding homeschooling, and take the view that schools are stagnant and<br/>
reactionary institutions that haven&#39;t adapted as our nation has developed.<br/>

provide at least 4 hours of instruction per day for 180 days, maintain a<br/>
written record in each subject area, keep portfolio of the child&#39;s work, and<br/>

The Pennsylvania Department of Education, as of a Sept. 7 letter, is<br/>
withholding approximately $23,000 monthly in state subsidies from the<br/>
district as a result of alleged non-payment of students&#39; fees for cyber<br/>
charter schools, said District Solicitor Jeffrey T. Sultanik. &quot;Most of these<br/>
students up to this time were home-schooled,&quot; Sultanik said. &quot;Therefore the d<br/>
istrict may have $325,000 in unanticipated tuition to spend and maybe more.&quot;<br/>
