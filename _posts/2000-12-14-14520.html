 </span></blockquote>While the Bear Sleeps Retold by Caitlin Matthews<br/>
Is a picture story book. Includes stories about<br/>
Christmas, Hanukka, Winters Soltice, Kwanza, Native<br/>
American etc. The book begins with a young girl<br/>
meeting a bear who takes her on a journey through<br/>
different times and cultures celbrating the winter<br/>
holidays.  Very, Very  lovely!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Samantha<br/>
<br/>
PS -The book describes history of Santa so if you do<br/>
the Santa thing it may let the mystery go so to speak<br/>
if she doesn&#39;t know already....<br/>

Seems to me there was one from Dorling Kindersley I read a few years ago.<br/>
Wish I could think of the title. (I only borrowed it.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971584012">Thanks, this sounds like the kind of book I want. I have found a listing <br/>
for it at a local library, so I&#39;ll stop by and take a look at it. No <br/>
problem about Santa. My son was already &quot;enlightened&quot; by one of his friends <br/>
and asked me about it. I told him the truth and he was not at all <br/>
disappointed. So much for magic...<br/>
