&gt;&gt;ancient times, and we liked the idea and decided to try cremating our dear <br/>

<br/>
We held a lovely cremation ceremony when Casey&#39;s first hamster died in the <br/>
middle of winter with its hard frozen ground. We placed him in an old <br/>
checkbook box, adorned him with beads and oil and created a funeral pyre in <br/>
the backyard at sundown.<br/>

In Korea they eat cats so it&#39;s all the same to them.<br/>

I don&#39;t know anyone who has one freezer for food and another for the cat.  <br/>
But I guess it could happen.   We have had friends who had various <br/>
interesting frozen things which they never intended to eat.<br/>

You&#39;re right.  After I sent that I thought &quot;every taxidermist in the country <br/>
and some of the artists.&quot;   My friend Frank used to paint somewhat-posed <br/>
roadkill.  (Not to make roadkill portraits, but to be able to really examine <br/>
feather patterns and fur and such for relistic paintings of live animals.)<br/>

I just thought this was too funny. My mom freaks out when I keep the dead<br/>
aquarium fish in the freezer not to mention various squid baits my husband<br/>
has had. Can&#39;t imagine what she would do finding a cat in there!! Thanks for<br/>
the laugh.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861552450">This cat in the freezer humour is funny. However I don&#39;t have a cat in the freezer only 2 gerbils awaiting burial. Oh and a few years back I had a placenta in the freezer as my son was born in December.<br/>
