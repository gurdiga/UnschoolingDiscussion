Pennsylvania requires standardized testing every other year as a condition of <br/>

administer the test (you can order the CAT test).<br/>
The place you order it from grades it and send you back the <br/>
scores. You then give the scores to the state.<br/>
Simple.<br/>
No-one watches to see who fills in the little circles......so you can <br/>
avoid testing your child (happy unschooler) and the state gets a <br/>
piece of paper with a grade on it (happy state).<br/>
It&#39;s not &#39;cheating&#39; cos the piece of paper is simply to make the <br/>
state happy. It is meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
All of the above is my opinion....<br/>

<br/>

&gt;&gt; grades 3, 5 and 8. The parent or guardian cannot administer this test.<br/>
&gt;&gt; However, the parent/guardian may purchase the test and allow a friend,<br/>
&gt;&gt; sibling, other family member (who is not the parent/guardian) or anyone else<br/>
&gt;&gt; to administer the test in the peace, comfort and privacy of the child&#39;s own<br/>

the PA thread in the Around the Continent folder on the message boards at<br/>
Unschooling.com There&#39;s at least the archives.<br/>
<br/>
The &#92;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.phen.org">http://www.phen.org</a> has information and a list of test suppliers.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:PA-Unschoolers@yahoogroups.com">PA-Unschoolers@yahoogroups.com</a> From what I&#39;ve heard, they<br/>
tend to be more eclectic but they should have some ideas for you.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s &quot;evaluation,&quot; not &quot;testing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not in Pennsylvania, but unschoolers there use an option involving <br/>
portfolios and a visit by an evaluating teacher.  And they know which people <br/>
understand and approve of unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-831178666">Hi Julie,<br/>
  I&#39;m in Pennsylvania, about an hour north of Harrisburg.  Where are <br/>
you?  I would love to meet another unschooler. :)<br/>
<br/>
In answer to your question, the law requires standardized testing in <br/>
grades 3, 5, and 8.  No way to get around that IF your child is in <br/>
grades 3, 5, and 8.  The IF is the loophole. ;)  Nowhere does the law <br/>
state that your child has to be in grades 3,5, or 8.  Nowhere does <br/>
the law say that you have to report your child&#39;s grade level to the <br/>
school district.  Just the age.  So you can use a &quot;K-8 ungraded <br/>
curriculum&quot;, never have your child in grades 3, 5, and 8 and never <br/>
have them tested.  You don&#39;t have to use the school district&#39;s <br/>
affidavit.  You can use your own, using the law as your guide or you <br/>
can download an affidavit from www.phen.org.  If the school asks you <br/>
for a grade level, politely tell them that you aren&#39;t required by law <br/>
to give them that information.  <br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that you will get away with it.  It depends on your <br/>
district.  I have a friend who tried it and the school automatically <br/>
labeled her 8 year old as a third grader, just because of age.  <br/>
Whether or not you eventually give in to a pita school district <br/>
depends on your comfort level with being fined with truancy and <br/>
taking the case to court.  <br/>
<br/>
And call your representative and senator and ask them to support <br/>
HB2560 so we don&#39;t have to go through this nonsense next year!!! <br/>
<br/>
You can get good info on complying with the law on the pa-hs list.  <br/>

grandparents, friends, or even siblings. ;)  <br/>

our children tested in grades 3, 5, and 8 AND hand in a book log of <br/>
what our kids read that year.  And if we&#39;re lucky enough to live in a <br/>
school district that interprets the law to say that a book log is a <br/>
daily list of educational activities and we don&#39;t feel like going to <br/>
court or paying truancy fines, we get to hand in a daily log of <br/>
activities.  AND we hand in an affidavit AND objectives.  AND <br/>
(depending on one&#39;s interpretation and one&#39;s school district&#39;s <br/>
interpretation of the law) an attendance record, proof of <br/>
immunizations and required medical tests or exemptions to them.  <br/>

Want to move to Pennsylvania?  ;)<br/>
