 </span></blockquote>Yes, unfortunately, the people I work with are rabid anti-homeschoolers. <br/>
First off, they associate homeschooling with Christian fundamentalism -- <br/>
narrow-minded, isolationist, Bible-thumper types.  Then, all of them were <br/>
highly successful in school (I remember a particularlly nauseating <br/>
discussion where they sat around for an hour or so talking about their <br/>
stratospheric SAT scores) so they simply can&#39;t imagine why school wouldn&#39;t <br/>
be a good thing for someone else, as long as you had &quot;good teachers&quot; and <br/>
&quot;applied yourself.&quot; Meanwhile, we live in a city where the school system is <br/>
a gigantic failure -- kids can&#39;t read, they beat each other up in the <br/>
hallways, the teachers vanish mid-semester, etc.<br/>
<br/>
My own kids are in school, because I do work fulltime. The newspaper here <br/>
did a big story on homeschooling recently, and my coworkers all said they <br/>
didn&#39;t even bother to read it because it was just such an idiotic notion. <br/>
They all declared they could never keep their kids home, and would I? I said <br/>
well, yes, I&#39;d thought about it, but that at this point in my life I am <br/>
working. They were *stunned*. It shut them up for a while though.<br/>
<br/>
I think they are reacting in self-defense. Someone else on the list pointed <br/>
this out. People always say, &quot;I did it, and I turned out fine.&quot; NOT.<br/>
