wrist guards and knee pads but don&#39;t insist.  My only insistence is a helmet.<br/>

the side of his hand one day, skating back from the grocery store on an <br/>
errand for me.  I felt bad.  It didn&#39;t need a doctor.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s the law here, so it&#39;s simple; can&#39;t do it if you don&#39;t wear it. If it&#39;s <br/>
not the law where you are (and you don&#39;t want to say it is), then it&#39;s one of <br/>
those things that you need to decide if it&#39;s enough of a safety issue to <br/>
decide for them or not. (Urban vs country, cul-de-sac vs busy street, etc.) <br/>
Whatever it is though, do lots&#39;a talking with your child about it! S/he may <br/>
just decide all on his/her own to wear them if they fully know what can <br/>
happen without the safety stuff. Maybe you could come up with a compromise, <br/>
like he wears the helmet, but doesn&#39;t have to wear the pads. (Head&#39;s now <br/>
protected, but skinning knee can show him he might rather have them on, but <br/>
still had his own power to make the decision.)    Lara........</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163943647">***Those who want to defend forcing kids to use safety equipment may<br/>

tell me what I&#39;ve already heard two dozen times now.***<br/>
<br/>
When my brother discovered we didn&#39;t require safety equipment for bikes<br/>
and skates he told us what we&#39;d already heard two dozen times.<br/>
<br/>
We told him, shockingly, Dylan eats peanuts and they can be deadly for<br/>
some.   People have choked to death on food but he still eats.   Lots of<br/>
people die in car accidents but he still rides in the car and lots of<br/>
people have died from tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, lightening, heat<br/>
stroke, drowning and exposure but he still lives on Earth.   AND he<br/>
sleeps on the top bunk without a safety net.  <br/>
<br/>
He has safety equipment if he wants to wear it.   He doesn&#39;t skate or<br/>
ride his bike much, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
When he was almost four he took a header into Grandma&#39;s marble top coffee<br/>
table.  It had been moved out of the thoroughfare but his little round<br/>
head still found the edge of it.  He had four stitches and now a scar.  <br/>
It may have been prevented if he&#39;d been in full safety gear inside her<br/>
house, I don&#39;t know. <br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t wear sparring gear at his dojo either, but he wears it at<br/>
other clubs where it&#39;s required and where he doesn&#39;t know if the kids<br/>
kick as hard as they can or just spar friendly like. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-373291946">We have a bike helmet law here too so again it makes it easy.  I know we would enforce it anyway though as we both  work/ed in emergency medicine and have seen first-hand the results of not using safety<br/>
gear.  Helmets are expensive but my kids head is well worth protecting.  My kids have no problems with wearing the helmets because everyone around here does for most sports that involve wheels or snow.<br/>
They think their helmets are &quot;cool&quot;.  I think it helps to decide where you are going to stand on the issue right when they start on a bike and then stick to it.  If you are wishy-washy then you will<br/>
loose the battle for sure.<br/>

We chose not to have a battle.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never been wishy washy about it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Helmets are expensive but my kids head is well worth protecting.&gt;&gt;<br/>

Mine aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
NOT REALLY.<br/>
But isn&#39;t that the implication when someone says &quot;my kids are worth it&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Like &quot;We would unschool, but we want our kids to go to college.&quot;<br/>
As though no unschooling parent ever thought about that, or they don&#39;t care <br/>
about college, or are just too lazy to do the work to tutor their kids <br/>
straight into college.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that we wouldn&#39;t buy them great helmets if they want them, and when <br/>
they were littler they always owned them, and if they visited where parents <br/>
insisted, they took their equipment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-574762808">I flat ignore (to discourage) most of it.  Unless you have a law<br/>
problem or an unusual activity planned, there is no reason to put<br/>
the impediment of fear between a kid and physical activity.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, I am not on a high accident type street or anything, but<br/>
really - what&#39;s the risk versus the benefit?  Ours likes the KEWL<br/>
helmets - and I make sure she always has the one she wants -<br/>
because there is SOME benefit, but if it became a hassle rather<br/>
than a hat we would drop it.<br/>
<br/>
I do insist that if we spelunk she wear a helmet and that when we<br/>
try a new or unfamiliar type thing she follow the safety rules to<br/>
the utmost until she knows the risks - but that&#39;s like training<br/>
wheels on a bike.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611667233">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the law here, but it is pushed heavily by the health<br/>
department.  There are frequent helmet fitting clinics and helmet<br/>
give-aways.  In our neighborhood, I see kids both with and without helmets.<br/>
<br/>
She has worn a helmet for biking, skating, and scootering since she began<br/>
those activities, so it&#39;s not something new that I&#39;m asking.  I wear a<br/>
helmet when I do them too.  The only reason I do is to set an example for<br/>
the kids.  I feel it is unfair to insist they do it if I&#39;m not willing to.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t like that it makes her head &quot;look big&quot;.  I said maybe she can<br/>
develop a helmet that protects, but is tiny like a hat.  She also doesn&#39;t<br/>
like that way it feels.  She is one of those kids who is sensitive to how<br/>
things feel.  We usually need to cut tags off clothes, etc.  Maybe there are<br/>
better helmets out there.  I have not ever worn one that didn&#39;t bother me<br/>
around my neck.  I know how to fit the helmets as I&#39;ve been to a couple of<br/>
the clinics and have really worked at adjusting the straps and padding<br/>
inside.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone found a brand of helmet that actually feels good?<br/>
<br/>
I had to chuckle when I read the post about kids wearing helmets all the<br/>
time to protect their heads.  Today the kids were playing on the swingset in<br/>
a wild way.  Lisa bumped her head onto the hanging bar.  I joked that maybe<br/>
she should wear a helmet while playing on the swingset :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210507813">I just needed to chime in here.<br/>
All of my kids who are older now,<br/>
all have stated to me that helmets<br/>
and safety gear aren&#39;t cool, and also<br/>
I had to hear nobody else wears them.<br/>
Last summer a boy came running to our<br/>
yard and told us our son had fallen<br/>
backwards on a pogo stick, hit his head<br/>
and was laying in the street and couldn&#39;t<br/>
get up.<br/>
Needless to say, it scared the hell out of him.<br/>
He had a huge bump, and was fine after a day.<br/>
I commented to him, it might have been better<br/>
to look a little uncool vs. a skull fracture.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302350290">I loved riding my bike when I was a kid, and when I turned twelve I got<br/>
the most awesome bike for my birthday.  I was so excited because it was<br/>
much nicer than the one I&#39;d had since I was eight.  Well, I&#39;m not sure<br/>
what happened one day that summer, except I was unconscious in the<br/>
middle of the road when a neighbor found me and took me home.  I was<br/>
&quot;fine&quot; a little while later (no concussion) and the only thing wrong was<br/>
some skin scraped off my left leg.  But I never got on a bike again.  I<br/>
just couldn&#39;t do it.  A few years later my parents sold it at a garage<br/>
sale, and when I went to college they asked if I wanted another one (a<br/>
lot of people rode bikes on my campus because the campus is so huge).  I<br/>
would rather walk. To this day, I would rather walk and I have no<br/>
intention of ever riding a bike again.<br/>
 <br/>
So my kids don&#39;t see me wearing safety gear, but then, they won&#39;t see me<br/>
riding either.  My son got a bike last spring when he turned 4 and he<br/>
didn&#39;t like the helmet because at that time he had a tumor on his neck<br/>
and the strap rubbed against it.  The tumor has since been removed and<br/>
he&#39;s been riding the bike on our porch and in our home with no helmet<br/>
(yes, I let him ride indoors).  <br/>
 <br/>
Now that it&#39;s spring again, I&#39;ll probably buy him another helmet because<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s the law.  Then again, I do see kids without<br/>
helmets, so if he still doesn&#39;t like wearing one, I will probably not<br/>
force the issue.  But when he&#39;s old enough to ride a bigger bike, and<br/>
without training wheels, I&#39;ll tell him about the accident I had as a kid<br/>
and let him make an informed decision whether he wants to risk injury or<br/>
wear the helmet.  I&#39;m not completely convinced that little piece of<br/>
plastic and foam would really make that much difference though.  Could<br/>
it possibly give kids false confidence?  Are there statistics somewhere<br/>
about head injuries before and after the helmet laws?  Maybe I&#39;ll look<br/>
that up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>to look a little uncool vs. a skull fracture.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So does he wear his helmet on the pogo stick now? Just curious.<br/>
<br/>
My kids always wore helmets when they were younger. When they first learned <br/>
to rollerblade they wore helmets, pads and wrist guards. As they got more <br/>
proficient the pads were dropped and they wore just helmets and wrist <br/>
guards. It was never a big deal, all the kids wore them. Now they wear <br/>
helmets if they&#39;re biking or blading on the street. There are lots of hills <br/>
here and it&#39;s easy to get going really fast. They don&#39;t wear them if they&#39;re <br/>
just fooling around or blading at a flat skating rink. They always like the <br/>
wrist guards when blading as they&#39;ve seen a couple friends with broken <br/>
wrists.<br/>
<br/>
Casey has never had an injury. Conor has had two concussions. One happened <br/>
when a neighbor pushed him off a little snow bank onto the driveway. The <br/>
other was while he was snowboarding with his helmet. We were all glad he had <br/>
the helmet on that day. It could have been much worse. I got that helmet at <br/>
a garage sale and he chose to wear it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s our story. I guess the answer is &quot;It depends.&quot;<br/>

I believe it&#39;s the law here, but regardless we do it ourselves and <br/>
our kids wear them too. Then again, we bicycle a lot, and use bikes <br/>
as a basic mode of transportation. That means we&#39;re often on roads <br/>
with cars and we put a lot of mileage on our bikes. It&#39;s never been <br/>
an issue as the kids see us wearing helmets as well and they just <br/>
buckle up. We did take them to the store and let them pick their own <br/>
helmets out - they see a lot of triathletes and others of my friends <br/>
who all use helmets as well, so they each chose racing-style helmets <br/>
which I guess look &quot;cool&quot; to them, and similar to all the athletes in <br/>
my triathlon magazines.<br/>
<br/>
I guess if it got to be an issue, I&#39;d discuss my own trial-and-error <br/>
approach to learning about safety gear and maybe hope they&#39;d learn <br/>
from that. I used to ride my motorcycle with no helmet and in jeans <br/>
and t-shirts and after a couple of accidents myself (one involving <br/>
3rd degree burns from my muffler) and a friend whose jaw and head <br/>
were shattered in a motorcycling accident (no helmet) I now wear a <br/>
full-face helmet and a full leather riding suit.<br/>
<br/>
I think it helps that my kids see me do a lot of &quot;high risk&quot; sports <br/>
(skydiving, motorcycling, bicycling, flying, scuba) and they see the <br/>
safety precautions I take. I talk with the kids about the things I <br/>
do, and the friends I&#39;ve seen be seriously injured and die, and the <br/>
risk vs. hassle evaluations I make for my own personal safety on each <br/>
piece of safety equipment. With a few concussions, a dozen broken <br/>
bones, and hundreds of stitches under my belt, I&#39;ve learned a few <br/>
lessons the hard way :-) I hope my kids don&#39;t have to do that, but I <br/>
know that mortality and possible injury seem like such remote <br/>
possibilities when you&#39;re young and bulletproof, so chances are that <br/>
they will :-)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter&#39;s the adventurous one, and she already endo&#39;d her bike <br/>
and landed on her head on a rock last year. She scraped her nose and <br/>
dented the helmet, but that was all. So she got to see that what <br/>
happened to the helmet would&#39;ve been her head. And yes, we bought a <br/>
new helmet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-784191372">I don&#39;t know. After watching my BIL last year recover from a bike<br/>
accident, I don&#39;t know if it is worth not wearing a helmet. He was<br/>
riding in the mountains with a bunch of Scouts. They got back to their<br/>
cars and were fooling around in the parking lot. They had taken helmets<br/>
and the rest off. My BIL is a big kid and a very very good biker. He was<br/>
on the Canadian National Bike Team and trained for the Olympics. Anyway,<br/>
he went over the front of his bike and landed on his face. He got a<br/>
concussion and had to have plastic surgery on his face to get everything<br/>
back in place. He was off work for almost 3 weeks because of it. He had<br/>
major damage to his teeth and mouth. <br/>
 <br/>
After that experience I&#39;m pretty committed to safety equipment -<br/>
especially on bikes and other things with wheels!<br/>

I flat ignore (to discourage) most of it.  Unless you have a law<br/>
problem or an unusual activity planned, there is no reason to put<br/>
the impediment of fear between a kid and physical activity.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, I am not on a high accident type street or anything, but<br/>
really - what&#39;s the risk versus the benefit?  Ours likes the KEWL<br/>
helmets - and I make sure she always has the one she wants -<br/>
because there is SOME benefit, but if it became a hassle rather<br/>
than a hat we would drop it.<br/>
<br/>
I do insist that if we spelunk she wear a helmet and that when we<br/>
try a new or unfamiliar type thing she follow the safety rules to<br/>
the utmost until she knows the risks - but that&#39;s like training<br/>
wheels on a bike.<br/>

for biking,<br/>

resistance to this.<br/>

  &lt;&lt;Actually, no, a big percent of kids don&#39;t wear helmets and I&#39;ve <br/>
  never heard of anyone getting fined over it.  Good point.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  How embarrassing!! The whole post I spelled helmets, helmits!!! Thought it looked weird. Kept wondering why I was thinking of crabs whenever I saw the word!!! (hermits)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are many arguments both for and against bike helmets. It sounds like a helmet wouldn&#39;t have protected your brother as they do not cover the mouth area.<br/>
Having trwaled through the arguments many times (I cycle 100 miles a week and don&#39;t wear one) I discovered a few interesting things. Firstly, in any country where helemts are made mandatory, cycling<br/>
goes down. Since Govt&#39;s are trying to encourage cycling before we all tunr into spherical couch potatoes choking on car pollution, this seems a bit silly. they do better to make drivers ed compuslsory.<br/>
many drivers do not realise that the law in all 50 states (and in the UK and Canada) says that bicycles are vehicles and have a right to the road. The DMV manual tells them to pass a cyclist at 3 feet.<br/>
So far I&#39;ve never encountered anyone doing this. This makes the road dangerous for me. Cycling isn&#39;t dangerous, its those morons who are.<br/>
With regards to helmets. A study on car accidents found that a driver involved in an accident was more likely to suffer head injuries than a cyclist in an accident - the most common cycling injusr (if<br/>
you are not squashed flat which no helemt is gonna save you from...) is broekn collar bone. Given that there are 40,000 motorist deaths in this country every year, and many many more non-fatal accidents<br/>
it seems to me than in order to cut down on head injuries, it is the motorist who should be wearing a helmet.<br/>
Can you imagine the fuss if a motorist was made to wear a helmet? Being surrounded by 2 tons of metal makes them feel safe and more likely to take risks and therefore results in more head injuries.<br/>
<br/>
Having said all that, I sometimes wear a helmet in the winter when I&#39;m cycling in the dark. I do this for two reasons. First, I&#39;m more likely to skid on ice and fall off and second, it gives me more<br/>
places to put my reflective stickers and hopefully be seen and not run over by some woman yapping on a cell phone rather than paying attention to the road. The rest of the year I don&#39;t wear one.<br/>

I believe they would say it restricts their vision.<br/>
And I think they would be right.<br/>
And I think bicyclists vision is restricted too.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good for racing, no doubt, when people need NOT to look back or look <br/>
around, and there&#39;s not likely to be a truck trying to make a right turn <br/>
where they&#39;re cycling.<br/>

<br/>
No, it doesn&#39;t restrict your vision at all.<br/>
And after almost being hit and dh actually getting hit once, we are VERY sure <br/>
to have helmets at all times.<br/>
An 11 year old neighbor boy was killed by a motorist when we lived in WA.<br/>
He would have survived if he&#39;d had a helmet on. Bicycles and cars are not a <br/>
good mix, helmets are important in my book.<br/>
