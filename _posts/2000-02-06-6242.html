Hercules, then Xena, now Bilbo Baggins! Locations are kept secret, rumours are<br/>

looking for the locations, but we are all looking forward to the movie.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-784898015">www.lordoftherings.net has some very pretty production pictures, but one of the movie magazine websites will probably be able to tell you more about it... www.empireonline.co.uk has some stuff, click on news and type lord of the rings in the search box (yes, really!!! :-) )  was looking for others, but Premiere doesn&#39;t have anything on it :-(  anyhow, this should start you off &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
