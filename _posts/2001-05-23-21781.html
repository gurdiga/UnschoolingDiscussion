<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462262889">Sandra said  **There are some very bad things school does.  One is make <br/>
reading a chore, a chance for failure, something you can do late, or wrong, <br/>
or badly.   If moms aren&#39;t careful, they can reproduce that result at home.  <br/>
Don&#39;t.**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to recommend a book for moms worrying about/at the late and/or <br/>
reluctant reader. Parents Who Love Reading, Kids Who Don&#39;t, Mary Leonhardt<br/>
<br/>
She goes into great detail about all the things that schools do to discourage <br/>
children from becoming avid readers. You&#39;ll know how not to do the same when <br/>
you&#39;re done reading the book.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another book I&#39;ve been reading off and on since it was published last <br/>
year about  children and learning and schools that I think some here might <br/>
enjoy reading. Coloring Outside the Lines, Roger Schank. He discusses how <br/>
schools destroy childrens minds and how parents can counteract that. He drops <br/>
the ball, in my opinion, by accepting schools as a mostly unavoidable <br/>
gatekeeper to real life and higher education - he only mentions alternatives <br/>
in a throwaway sentence &quot;I&#39;m not suggesting you homeschool, though that <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be a terrible thing.&quot;  Anyway...  he develops some interesting ideas <br/>
and themes on what education really is and how to relate to your child in <br/>
order to keep from damaging his creativity and intelect, how to raise a truly <br/>
educated child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113683899">Oh, I did write to him when I first started reading the book, telling <br/>
him that he could learn a lot from unschoolers, and offering <br/>
information. I got added to his mailing list,  :) and no other <br/>
response, and I&#39;m too lazy right now to take it further since I&#39;m <br/>
pretty sure he&#39;s much more interested in selling computer curriculum <br/>
to schools than in the adventures of those outside them.  :) It&#39;s <br/>
still a really good book for anyone who isn&#39;t yet positive (as I am) <br/>
that schools are unhealthy places for children. But I&#39;ll ponder on it <br/>
again...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728940918">Okay, I&#39;ve finally caught up with the posts to this list - just in <br/>
time to say I&#39;m going to have to put it back on digest again, or <br/>
maybe even web-only. I&#39;m leaving in a couple of days and won&#39;t be <br/>
able to follow the conversations here as closely as I have been, but <br/>
as list owner I do have a few things to say before I wander off into <br/>
the sunset.<br/>
<br/>
There is no moderator on this list. No listmommy, no nothing. It is, <br/>
rather, something of an experiment in getting along with each other <br/>
and seeing if differences of opinion and other hassles can be worked <br/>
out in a group setting without some authority figure from on high <br/>
either constantly reminding and admonishing people or just <br/>
expeditiously zapping someone off the list for misbehaving.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all adults here (at least I haven&#39;t seen any minors recently), <br/>
and if we can&#39;t collectively figure out how to get along with each <br/>
other, then should we be allowed to play with big powerful important <br/>
toys like the Internet?<br/>
<br/>
Bullies. To be honest, I probably wouldn&#39;t know a bully if one walked <br/>
up and kicked sand in my face. I&#39;d just figure he or she had some <br/>
&quot;issues&quot; to deal with and if that made it easier for him or her, <br/>
well, so be it. I&#39;m not a pacifist or anything, I can lose my temper <br/>
as quickly as the next person, but I can also come up with a hundred <br/>
different off-the-wall justifications for people being the way they <br/>
are or doing the things they do. Call it a curse or a blessing, it&#39;s <br/>
just the way I am. And exacerbating the problem is all the <br/>
distractions besides this list - I try to keep up here, but it gets <br/>
difficulter and difficulter as time goes on...<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t see any bullies here. Just a discussion that&#39;s gotten out <br/>
of hand. Way out of hand, if my offlist email is any indication. I&#39;d <br/>
like to enter my plea that the parties involved knock it off, call a <br/>
truce, or whatever. This is a terrific list, one of the best. Let&#39;s <br/>
keep it that way.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

I think it&#39;s worth reading and pondering, yes, or I wouldn&#39;t still be putzing <br/>
around with it after 6 months. :)  I keep borrowing it from my library, you <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526234797">I for one joined this list because I knew Sandra was on it. I figured it<br/>
would be interesting. :) I was right. I am enjoying this list very much. The<br/>
only problem I have is when people say the do not need to defend themselves<br/>
and yet continue to do so. But, hey, that is minor. I love the interesting<br/>
conversations with a diverse group of people. And I enjoy Sandra because she<br/>
gives it to me straight. I do not have to agree with anyone, but I<br/>
appreciate those who take the time to reply. I gleen knowledge and gain<br/>
comfort. Mostly, I love knowing I am not alone in my unschooling venture.<br/>

Thanks, too, to the several people who have made positive comments publicly <br/>
and privately this week about benefits they&#39;ve had from my writings and those <br/>
of others here.  I wrote to people privately, but when it was the most <br/>
dangerous here I was afraid to thank people publicly for fear they would be <br/>
insulted.<br/>
<br/>
Life shouldn&#39;t be that way, and public thanks should receive public <br/>
acknowledgement, and so I apologize for wimping out to the extent I did <br/>
(going private), and I hope those affected understand.<br/>
<br/>
I like this list *because* it is specifically for unschoolers and because <br/>
it&#39;s a part of the unschooling forum I am SO glad exists.<br/>
<br/>
For years, print media (GWS, HEM on paper) and John Holt books were the best <br/>
unschoolers could do for help.<br/>
<br/>
Then for many more years unschoolers participated in online lists and message <br/>
boards alongside structured homeschoolers who pretty regularly proclaimed we <br/>
were not only ruining our kids, but endangering homeschooling rights for <br/>
everybody (AND we weren&#39;t helping bring up test scores, which was the goal of <br/>
many of the most conservative--get those test scores up so nobody will look <br/>
at what they weren&#39;t even beginning to teach in social studies requirements). <br/>
 We had to endure *daily* suggestions that a curriculum would probably be <br/>
better than just &quot;trusting&quot; that we might find educational experiences.  We <br/>
had to endure serious suggestions that homeschoolers should stay quietly in <br/>
their homes during &quot;school hours&quot; for the good of all homeschoolers.  We had <br/>
to answer the Same Dumb Questions constantly and in public:  How will they <br/>
learn to read?  How will they learn times tables?  How will they learn to <br/>
study?  How will they learn discipline and obedience?  How will they learn <br/>
anything the mother doesn&#39;t know?<br/>
<br/>
Luckily for those who have only begun unschooling in the past three years or <br/>
so, those stories are now the quaint and distant past.  It is rare now that <br/>
someone comes in not knowing at all what unschooling is, or insisting that <br/>
requiring math lessons doesn&#39;t keep them from being unschoolers.  What was <br/>
constant for some of us is rare-to-never for newer participants, and so that <br/>
might be why some of the old timers are less patient than some newe <br/>
participants thought we would be.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of us remember times when there weren&#39;t separate forums.  Now there are. <br/>
 There are now &quot;safe&quot; places for fundamentalist Christian curriculum users <br/>
where they can pretend none of us exist (or revile us without response).  <br/>
There is a sweet, good place for Christian unschoolers to discuss unschooling <br/>
without non-Christian influences and suggestions.  There are still lots of <br/>
&quot;mixed&quot; group discussions and lists.  And then there are very few purely <br/>
unschooling places.  <br/>
<br/>
Someone claimed there were several others.  I think &quot;several&quot; is too large a <br/>
number.  If there are others people want to recommend (nobody listed them <br/>
when I asked the first time), I don&#39;t see how that could hurt anything.<br/>
<br/>
But because I&#39;ve come through too many years of having to defend unschooling <br/>
with so much energy we didn&#39;t have much left to discuss it, I am quick to <br/>
want to maintain the difference between unschooling and unit studies, from <br/>
those who teach writing and math but leave science, history and all else to <br/>
form up otherwise and separately (which I don&#39;t personally think will work <br/>
very well under those circumstances), and other &quot;loose&quot; but not unschooling <br/>
philosophies.<br/>

bit of a challenge at the moment. Cindy and I (as moderators) have tried to <br/>
mainly stand back and let things work themselves out. That being said, I <br/>
would also like to point out that because of the past problems with this <br/>
list, we have decided to make it one with some &quot;rules&quot; (arghhhhh!!!!!!!! that <br/>
word grates on me like a fingernail on a chalkboard). <br/>
<br/>
Please refrain from bringing up past grievances. No name calling. Refrain <br/>
from posts which are primarily argumentative, defensive . . .  you all get the<br/>
picture. Anyway, I know everyone really wants to keep things on a respectful <br/>
basis. There is a wide variety of viewpoints on many issues like television, <br/>
what unschooling is, controls, etc. If we can keep discsussing these issues <br/>
in a respectful way, even though we may totally disagree, I think things will <br/>
smooth out. Thanks to all of you for your support.<br/>

<br/>
I, for one,  am grateful for your honest opinion about your perception of<br/>
the way this list has changed.<br/>
I took a break to enable me to start with a fresh perspective....and wasn&#39;t<br/>
sure I wanted to be a part of this list anymore.  When the schism occurred,<br/>
I had made a committment (to myself) to stay here because the list is<br/>
connected with unschooling.com and HEM.....and I want to be a part of<br/>
supporting them for the *gifts* I&#39;ve enjoyed through them.<br/>
    I have been deschooling myself for the past several years and so have<br/>
grown in my approach and understanding of unschooling,  and what it means.<br/>
One benefit of the *turmoil* from last fall was that *I* personally had a<br/>
breakthrough in my understanding and growth as an unschooler.<br/>
    I agree with Ren....her posting of the quote by Marianne Williamson was<br/>
wonderful.  And I think she articulated her position on unschooling quite<br/>
well.<br/>
    (I hope this is not construed as bringing up past hurts!)....I have<br/>
refrained from saying much about some list members because through the<br/>
tumultuous times,  at least one person who posts frequently  basically lost<br/>
credibility with me.  I don&#39;t know how to move beyond these feelings<br/>
appropriately without stirring the pot.    I&#39;ve found my best general course<br/>
is to keep scrolling past some things.  It&#39;s a difficult place to be....I<br/>
want to be encouraging and helpful.  And I think some things need to be<br/>
challenged,  without personal attack.<br/>
    We try to stick to discussing ideas....challenging ourselves and others,<br/>
but we are all human beings (as far as I know-LOL!)...and our feelings about<br/>
our ideas will shine through.<br/>
Challenging each other is important....it enables growth.  There is a basic<br/>
minority of people who post prolifically...they color the tone of the list<br/>
greatly.  And the way I see it,  when the usually &quot;lurky&quot; folks get stirred<br/>
enough to jump in.....it&#39;s time to pay attention to what&#39;s being said.<br/>
On that note....I&#39;mouttahere for tonight!<br/>
Authentically,<br/>
Susan<br/>
Ugliness?  Accusations?<br/>

&lt;&lt;Is this &quot;lame&quot; or cool&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would think &quot;cool&quot;.  You talked with your kids and they are calling the<br/>
shots.  Of course, what happens if game time goes up and the kids get grumpy<br/>
again?  Do you gently point out that last time, the kids thought it was too<br/>
much game time, or do you march in and snatch the joystick out of their<br/>
hands?  That I think is the key.<br/>
<br/>
I finally came to my senses about TV about a year ago.  For months, the<br/>
oldest sat on her fanny and watched re-runs.  Drove me insane but I bit my<br/>
lip.  Then the fighting and arguing started.  We had a talk and oldest said<br/>
she feels better when she doesn&#39;t watch so much TV.  She monitors herself.<br/>
This morning, she and the 8yo spent Saturday morning cartoon time playing<br/>
chess in another room.  Still, sometimes she spends an entire day on the<br/>
couch, primarily when she is tired and needs to refresh herself.<br/>

I also have the feeling/impression that this list is less authoritarian<br/>

========================<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In response, I have to say that I find the list all &quot;newbie&quot; related<br/>
&gt; now.<br/>
&gt; Which is fine, but it seems to be functioning on a more &quot;remedial&quot;<br/>
&gt; unschooling level than before.<br/>
=====================<br/>
Yes, perhaps it is all &quot;newbie&quot; related now, but I don&#39;t see why we<br/>
can&#39;t have this list on multiple levels all at the same time.  We always<br/>
have different threads going, and all those threads can be at different<br/>
levels, can&#39;t they?<br/>
====================<br/>
&gt;  But if we water down the essential oils of<br/>
&gt; unschooling to where all is unschooling, we have done no favors to<br/>
&gt; anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Julie--who unbendingly and authoritatively defines this medium as e-mail<br/>
and<br/>
the portal to this room as a door<br/>

I am in no way being mean, rude, snooty, or whatever (just ignorant, I<br/>
guess) - but what do you mean by &quot;But if we water .......&quot;  I don&#39;t<br/>
understand what you mean.  Can you explain?  Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And along those same lines, when the new unschoolers decide to come out of lurkdom, it might be because they sense a feeling of acceptance... to the doubts and fears they are having. They feel they can come here and ask those nagging questions that most of us have experienced. Some of the responses will come from old pros who don&#39;t have any nagging questions any longer. Others who respond may still be at a place of doubt but sure feel good enough about their progress to step in and offer information.<br/>
To me, this is more of a forum where we can gather to discuss all aspects of unschooling... from the doubts to the confident, not a place where I am seeking advice from only the &#39;experts&#39;. I think Pat is such a good example of this. She came here with doubts, asked lots of questions, implemented some of the responses and disregarded what wasn&#39;t appealing to her and is moving right along. In the meantime, another new person came along with a few of the same type questions and Pat was able to contribute to that discussion (rather than sitting back and waiting for the &#39;experts&#39; to do their thing). <br/>
I like where the list was heading and hope it continues to do so. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194232497">The list posting policies go out to anybody who signs onto the list, <br/>
but we haven&#39;t been sending them to the list for people to reread. I&#39;m <br/>
not complaining - and this is not in response to any particular post or <br/>
thread or anything like that - but the reminders that people should <br/>
read a couple of weeks before posting reminded ME that we had intended <br/>
to send the list policies out at least once in a while to remind <br/>
everybody what they say.<br/>
<br/>
I think the list has, in general, been going very very well and I <br/>
really appreciate all the great ideas and advice and ESPECIALLY the <br/>
analysis and deep thinking about parents and children and learning.<br/>
<br/>
This list has 1,370+ members and that number is growing every day.<br/>
<br/>
For those who are new to unschooling and/or to this list, let me assure <br/>
you that there will be plenty of opportunity for you to get your <br/>
questions answered - topics come and go and come back again. Just make <br/>
sure you&#39;ve read the posting policies carefully and please only read <br/>
for at least a couple of weeks and get used to what this list is like <br/>
as it may be different than other homeschooling lists you&#39;ve been on.<br/>
<br/>
  For those who are not new to the list, please reread the posting <br/>
policies I&#39;ve provided below - it has been quite a while since we last <br/>
posted them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for being here. Thanks for sharing a part of your lives with us. <br/>
Thanks for caring so much about your kids!!!<br/>

UnschoolingDiscussion Posting Policies<br/>
<br/>
It is our sincere wish to provide a forum for those seeking to deepen <br/>
their<br/>
understanding of the unschooling philosophy. The primary purpose of this<br/>
list is to encourage the critical examination of ideas, beliefs and<br/>
viewpoints.<br/>
<br/>
Questioning of deeply-held ideas and beliefs can be very uncomfortable <br/>
and<br/>
sometimes responses to that process can stand in the way of people <br/>
getting<br/>
what they need out of the list.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, we offer the following guidelines to help our members get the<br/>
most from the list:<br/>
<br/>
1. Read for at least a couple of weeks before posting yourself. Spend <br/>
that<br/>
time getting a &quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members. This will help you<br/>
decide if this list is worth your time or whether some other list might <br/>
be<br/>
more useful to you in meeting your needs.<br/>
<br/>
2 Expect your beliefs to be challenged. Welcome this as an opportunity <br/>
to<br/>
critically examine your own ideas.<br/>
<br/>
3. When differences of opinion arise, stick to discussing ideas, not the<br/>
person with whom you are disagreeing.<br/>
<br/>
4. If you have a belief or practice that you don&#39;t want held up to <br/>
public<br/>
examination, don&#39;t post it to the list.<br/>
<br/>
5. Before you hit &quot;send,&quot; consider whether your post will contribute<br/>
positively to the unschooling discussion.<br/>
<br/>
6. Avoid using loaded terminology. For instance, &quot;If you have no TV<br/>
restrictions why don&#39;t your kids just watch TV all day?&quot; will get you <br/>
more<br/>
useful responses than, &quot;I don&#39;t see how your kids learn anything if all <br/>
they<br/>
ever do is sit around like zombies watching unlimited TV.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
7. It is not useful to inform the list that you believe someone else is<br/>
being rude or discourteous; please trust the rest of the list to <br/>
recognize<br/>
rudeness for themselves. Saying, &quot;Jane was rude to me,&quot; just bogs down <br/>
the<br/>
list. It is also a waste of everyone&#39;s time when participants attempt to<br/>
correct or improve other list members&#39; manners. It never works and <br/>
always<br/>
disrupts the list. Avoid<br/>
statements such as: &quot;Jane, here is my suggestion of how you could write <br/>
more<br/>
nicely so people wouldn&#39;t think you are being rude.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
8. Our brains automatically supply a &quot;tone&quot; to posts as we read. It can <br/>
be<br/>
helpful to imagine your best friend speaking the words you are reading, <br/>
in<br/>
the gentlest, most well-meaning tone you can imagine. It is <br/>
unacceptable to<br/>
attack the &quot;tone&quot; of the list or to make generalizations about it. &quot;I&#39;ve<br/>
been on many other lists and this one is the rudest I&#39;ve seen,&quot; would be<br/>
unacceptable. Instead, attempt to create a positive, helpful tone with <br/>
your<br/>
own posts by setting the example you hope others will follow.<br/>
<br/>
9. Envision every post and response as a dish at a potluck dinner. You <br/>
won&#39;t<br/>
love every dish at a potluck any more than you will love every poster&#39;s<br/>
style of help. But a dish/post may be exactly what someone else needs. <br/>
If<br/>
you don&#39;t like a certain list member&#39;s offerings, skip them and<br/>
leave them for others.<br/>
<br/>
10. Read and write as clearly as you can. In casual conversation we <br/>
often<br/>
don&#39;t realize how much we rely on others to fill in the gist of our<br/>
conversation based on what they expect us to say. But here, without body<br/>
language or inflection, all we have to go on are your words and they <br/>
should<br/>
say what you mean. If you say, for example, you &quot;never&quot; do something, it<br/>
should not mean &quot;almost never.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our goal is to make the list as useful as possible for those seeking to<br/>
deepen their understanding of the unschooling philosophy. To do that, <br/>
all<br/>
new list members are initially moderated to prevent spamming and catch <br/>
posts<br/>
that could disrupt the list. People will also be moderated if they <br/>
disrupt<br/>
the usefulness of the list. Potentially disruptive posts will be <br/>
returned<br/>
for revision.<br/>
