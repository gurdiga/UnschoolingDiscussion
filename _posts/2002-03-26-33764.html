<div id="ygrps-yiv-87287735">I don&#39;t remember any time that I actually noticed my son &#39;learning&#39; <br/>
anything in particular.<br/>
<br/>
He knew his ABCs and I don&#39;t know how. Nor did it matter. I trust <br/>
that he will know what he needs to get on with his life. Its my job <br/>
to allow the security for him to pursue it.<br/>
<br/>
When he had just turned 4, he asked me if the batteries in his toy <br/>
were working. I was busy in the shower and said I&#39;ll check it out <br/>
when I get out.<br/>
<br/>
The next thing I knew, the shower got dark, light, dark, light.. and <br/>
I heard him saying &#39;O-F-F&#39; and &#39;O-N&#39;. He was using this to determine <br/>
on his toy if the &#39;on&#39; button worked, hence he would know if its the <br/>
batteries or not.<br/>
<br/>
Seeking the answers shows me that I trust children. They <br/>
will &#39;necessity is the mother of invention&#39; to get their information. <br/>
To get what they need to move on. <br/>
<br/>
How wonderful they are when they aren&#39;t coerced, abused, manipulated <br/>
or fed guilt and fear. How sad it is when you see the ones that are.<br/>
