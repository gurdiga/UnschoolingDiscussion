<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078072683">I wanted to let you all know that things went well<br/>
with Aubrey today after the blanket thing yesterday.<br/>
We had a good talk, but I especially wanted to share<br/>
with you a great insight I had. <br/>
<br/>
You see, we volunteer at a nearby nature center, doing<br/>
nature crafts with kids. Today we did pointillism,<br/>
like Seurat if you&#39;re familiar with him, only we used<br/>
pussywillows for making the dots. <br/>
<br/>
It worked great, by the way; some of you might want to<br/>
try it with your kids. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, one kid discovered he could make dots with the<br/>
tips of his fingers, and soon everyone was<br/>
fingerpainting. Aubrey did two fingerpaintings, one<br/>
red and pink with graceful swirls and one green and<br/>
brown with aggressive slashes. I said, &quot;This first one<br/>
looks like one of your good moods and the green one<br/>
looks like one of your bad moods.&quot; This was ok to say<br/>
at the time, because we&#39;d talked about it a lot today.<br/>
She thought a minute, then said she thought they both<br/>
looked like good moods. <br/>
<br/>
Then I was helping some tiny tots wash up, and next<br/>
thing I knew, Aubrey brought me a picture she&#39;d made<br/>
of a BAD mood. Wow! What an eye opener! This picture<br/>
had MANY colors, MANY textures, all flung and<br/>
splattered and mingling and clashing.<br/>
<br/>
It was, basically, a painting of chaos. <br/>
<br/>
So a light bulb went off over my head. THIS is why she<br/>
NEEDS the blanket so much. In the bad moods, she&#39;s not<br/>
just angry. She&#39;s not just sad. She feels completely<br/>
out of control. The blanket is a stabilizer. It&#39;s<br/>
probably some sort of sacred, meditational talisman.<br/>
<br/>
And this was only a picture of what she remembers a<br/>
bad mood as feeling like. Next time a bad mood comes<br/>
on, I&#39;m bringing out the paints. I&#39;ve just got to see<br/>
what one looks like as it&#39;s happening.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Gosh! How marvelous that, even though she cant express in words how <br/>
she feels, she could express the frustration and anger so well in a <br/>
painting. And equally wonderful, that a light bulb flashed in your <br/>
mind, that gave you a new understanding of your child.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Many many years ago when I was about 8yrs old.  my aunty bought me a <br/>
new purse. I was there with her in the shop. I remember it well. I <br/>
didnt want THAT purse and I created such a scene. But the thing was I <br/>
didnt *not * want it.  My aunty, who was usually very good with me, <br/>
decided in the end I didnt deserve a purse.<br/>
My emotions during that episode were so mixed that even today, I dont <br/>
know why I was such a little brat or why I was.<br/>
<br/>
I still find it hard at times to distiguish which emotion I am <br/>
feeling, when i get upset about somthing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-243357338">What a wonderful insight for both of you. It is great that she could <br/>
express a mood in this way. You could definitely bring out the paints next <br/>
time she feels a change of mood coming on. Maybe that is how those great <br/>
artists fueled their inspiring paintings.<br/>
