We do have ice cream, always.  It gets gummy in the box.  Because it&#39;s no big <br/>
deal, the kids only get it out when they actually have a desire for ice <br/>
cream, or it&#39;s hot and they have company, or they want to make a milk shake.  <br/>

bread is.  If we run out of ice cream, nobody cares.  If we run out of bread, <br/>
it&#39;s worth a trip to the store.<br/>

You seem to be suggesting I&#39;m putting myself in legal danger by this.  I know <br/>
you&#39;re wrong.   The &quot;prudent&quot; thing is that I have for years provided them <br/>
with choices, and they have made some damned good ones.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, just so everyone here knows (not that anyone cares, but just to be <br/>
*open* about this):<br/>
<br/>
It is now 10:46 P.M. in the Davis household.  Julian has already had a bowl <br/>
of ice cream (as described in the booger-nose stick-pole post earlier, which <br/>
was, sadly, *not* hypothetical).<br/>
<br/>
He now wants aNOTHer bowl of ice cream.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so NOW I am talking about ice cream.<br/>
<br/>
It is 10:48.  (I say this to him, aloud, and he asks &quot;That&#39;s why you&#39;re gonna <br/>
get me some?&quot; and I say to him &quot;No.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m not.&quot;)  <br/>
<br/>
He is now sitting on my lap, ice-cream deprived, watching me type, watching <br/>
the words form on the screen, and sounding them out.<br/>
<br/>
I do not think that MY decision to refuse to get my son some ice cream at <br/>
10:51 at night is such a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
Am I wrong?  (Or am I just lazy?)  (Or tired?)<br/>

Of course you&#39;re comfortable with that decision. It was yours to make.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, children can feel a huge loss of control over their world <br/>

Some of us that also feel TCS is totally absurd, DO give our children free <br/>
choice over food (among other things).<br/>
And the more I step back and give them this free reign, the more I see what a <br/>
wonderful way it is to live. My children are aware of what their bodies need. <br/>
I&#39;ve had ice cream in the freezer for an entire week...which in previous <br/>
times was unheard of. It would have been eaten in a night, because I was <br/>
controlling it&#39;s use.<br/>
Take away the control and the forbidden object becomes common place, no need <br/>
to binge, it will always be available.<br/>
My children will choose carrots as quickly as ice cream now. So I know this <br/>
works, I know that I don&#39;t need to say &quot;no&quot; to ice cream anymore.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t have it in the house? We don&#39;t either. Some times it runs out. <br/>
Sometimes nobody wants any so I don&#39;t pick it up at the store. Or do you <br/>
mean you have it, but just don&#39;t eat it everyday? And as a policy, health <br/>
reasons/nutition/whatever, don&#39;t allow the kids access to it everyday <br/>
either?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Moreover, even if we did have ice cream every day, I don&#39;t, personally, <br/>
&gt;&gt;think it would be prudent to &quot;allow&quot; him to have it every day.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So it&#39;s not really about whether it&#39;s in the house? It&#39;s more about your <br/>
firmly held beliefs about nutrition and such then, right? This is not a <br/>
criticism, it&#39;s me trying to make sure I&#39;m hearing you right.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m wondering, then, is if you think the act of giving your son free <br/>
choice each and every morning will then absolutely lead to him making bad <br/>
nutrition choices. I ask because many of us here used to have those beliefs. <br/>
Someone asked us similar questions, which caused us to reexamine those <br/>
beliefs. Some of us even allowed very non-standard (by Parenting magazines) <br/>
choices in our young children. Much to our delight, our kids made good <br/>
choices even when they weren&#39;t forced on them.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re free to disregard this whole thread and think I&#39;m nuts BTW. I&#39;m not <br/>
criticizing you or your family or your choices. I&#39;m just asking some &quot;what <br/>
if...&quot; and &quot;what do you think would happen if..&quot; questions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;And I am comfortable with that decision.&gt;&gt;<br/>

from our discussion too. I&#39;d like to keep going :o)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;(No, wait, I can imagine what a judge would do, and I would counsel a <br/>
&gt;&gt;client to not give a child ice cream every day for breakfast, unless a <br/>
&gt;&gt;doctor said that same was necessary for health reasons.)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never said to *give* a child ice cream for breakfast every morning. I <br/>
merely questioned the need to deny it if asked for. I suggested the idea <br/>
that even very young children will tend to make healthy choices when given <br/>
the free choice and looked at over a period of time longer than one meal.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Also, no, I never said that he threw a tantrum as a result of being<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ice-cream-deprived.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You said:&gt;&gt; My son (I&#39;ll call him &quot;Ben&quot;) would just LOVE if I just *advised* <br/>
him that he ought not scream and yell just because I won&#39;t let him eat ice <br/>
cream for breakfast. (Well, at least, not every day.)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess I got it wrong then. I thought this meant that you won&#39;t let your <br/>
son choose to eat ice cream for breakfast except on those occassions where <br/>
you say  yes, have had this discussion with him in the past, and have seen <br/>
him yell and scream as a result.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;And, no, that is not what this thread was about.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I CHANGED the thread Kate. That&#39;s why it&#39;s now called ice cream for <br/>
breakfast. I&#39;m not interested in how a TCS person would handle ice cream. I <br/>
was just asking you about a comment you made.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Cool! :o) Then let&#39;s keep on with this part of the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay.  Cool!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I keep trying to. But you seem to think I&#39;m a crazed, malicious TCS advocate <br/>
and worthy of shushing. Or worse.:-(<br/>

<br/>
Maybe the servings are too small.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, I am always reminded of my friend, Linda, who was caught smoking when we <br/>
were 14, and whose father thought he would &quot;teach her a lesson&quot; and made her <br/>
smoke a whole carton of cigarettes without stopping.  She became a chain <br/>
smoker and died of lung cancer when she was 26.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the servings aren&#39;t too small.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, maybe ice cream isn&#39;t lethal.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;Nothing would be the problem with him having ice cream everyday, except <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;that we don&#39;t have ice cream every day.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t have it in the house? We don&#39;t either. Some times it runs out. <br/>
&gt; Sometimes nobody wants any so I don&#39;t pick it up at the store. Or do you <br/>
&gt; mean you have it, but just don&#39;t eat it everyday? And as a policy, health <br/>
&gt; reasons/nutition/whatever, don&#39;t allow the kids access to it everyday <br/>
&gt; either?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I meant that we do not, physically, always have it in the house.  <br/>
Unfortunately, we happened to have it in the house on this night, which, as <br/>
chance would have it, is an unschooling ice cream night, much to my chagrin.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;Moreover, even if we did have ice cream every day, I don&#39;t, personally, <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;think it would be prudent to &quot;allow&quot; him to have it every day.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So it&#39;s not really about whether it&#39;s in the house? It&#39;s more about your <br/>
&gt; firmly held beliefs about nutrition and such then, right? This is not a <br/>
&gt; criticism, it&#39;s me trying to make sure I&#39;m hearing you right.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s really about both.  Or so I thought.  We are now on bowl number five <br/>
(and the servings are getting larger with each bowlful).  He didn&#39;t want to <br/>
eat a &quot;real&quot; dinner, and so I didn&#39;t &quot;make&quot; him.  He is very happy right now, <br/>
eating his FIFTH BOWL OF ICE CREAM.  I, on the other hand, am not &quot;happy.&quot;  <br/>
Intrigued, yes.  Curious, certainly.  Happy?  Not on your life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What I&#39;m wondering, then, is if you think the act of giving your son free <br/>
&gt; choice each and every morning will then absolutely lead to him making bad <br/>
&gt; nutrition choices. I ask because many of us here used to have those <br/>
&gt; beliefs. <br/>
&gt; Someone asked us similar questions, which caused us to reexamine those <br/>
&gt; beliefs. Some of us even allowed very non-standard (by Parenting magazines) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; choices in our young children. Much to our delight, our kids made good <br/>
&gt; choices even when they weren&#39;t forced on them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, well, maybe tomorrow he&#39;ll want five bowls of spinach.  (That&#39;s a joke. <br/>
 I don&#39;t think spinach is a good thing in high doses -- too much vitamin K <br/>
for our family&#39;s blood condition.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You&#39;re free to disregard this whole thread and think I&#39;m nuts BTW. I&#39;m not <br/>
&gt; criticizing you or your family or your choices. I&#39;m just asking some &quot;what <br/>
&gt; if...&quot; and &quot;what do you think would happen if..&quot; questions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, now I know &quot;what would happen if . . . .&quot;  I would be sitting up at <br/>
11:33 p.m. describing to people who might or might not care, what it is like <br/>
to sit next to a 3 year old little boy eating his fifth bowl of ice cream . . <br/>
. . <br/>
<br/>
OH MY GOODNESS -- he just looked at me, burped, and said &quot;I don&#39;t want any <br/>
more ice cream.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now he wants a bath.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;And I am comfortable with that decision.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Comfortable talking about it too? Other people might be getting some <br/>
&gt; benefit <br/>
&gt; from our discussion too. I&#39;d like to keep going :o)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me too.  But Julian wants a bath.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;Also, no, I never said that he threw a tantrum as a result of being<br/>
&gt; ice-cream-deprived.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You said:&gt;&gt; My son (I&#39;ll call him &quot;Ben&quot;) would just LOVE if I just <br/>
&gt; *advised* <br/>
&gt; him that he ought not scream and yell just because I won&#39;t let him eat ice <br/>
&gt; cream for breakfast. (Well, at least, not every day.)&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess I got it wrong then. I thought this meant that you won&#39;t let your <br/>
&gt; son choose to eat ice cream for breakfast except on those occasions where <br/>
&gt; you say  yes, have had this discussion with him in the past, and have seen <br/>
&gt; him yell and scream as a result.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son just yells and screams.  He thinks it&#39;s fun.  And funny.  I have been <br/>
cursed with a child much like myself.  (And, no, I don&#39;t really think I&#39;ve <br/>
been &quot;cursed,&quot; and yes, I really very much love and appreciate my son, who is <br/>
wonderfully ice-cream scented right now.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;And, no, that is not what this thread was about.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I CHANGED the thread Kate. That&#39;s why it&#39;s now called ice cream for <br/>
&gt; breakfast. I&#39;m not interested in how a TCS person would handle ice cream. I <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; was just asking you about a comment you made.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Cool! :o) Then let&#39;s keep on with this part of the discussion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay.  Cool!&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I keep trying to. But you seem to think I&#39;m a crazed, malicious TCS <br/>
&gt; advocate <br/>
&gt; and worthy of shushing. Or worse.:-(<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that at all.  I think I&#39;m the crazed lunatic who&#39;s willing to <br/>
sit up reading threads on unschooling.com until all hours of the night and <br/>
allowing my child to eat five bowls of ice cream and DESCRIBING the <br/>
experience!  You?  Crazed?  Uh-uh.  Me?  Mebbe.<br/>

he thinks the limitations will be reinstated.<br/>
<br/>
When people loosen a longstanding TV limit, or video game limit, kids binge <br/>
BIGTIME because (from accounts from the parents and kids, and from general <br/>
knowledge of human behavior) they think it&#39;s a temporary lapse of the rules.  <br/>
It&#39;s a one-time special.  It&#39;s a festival.   They don&#39;t REALLY believe their <br/>
parents are not going to stick the restrictions right back on.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not until they honestly believe and trust and experience that they can <br/>
leave that ice cream there and it will still be there in a couple of days, or <br/>
a week, that they can calmly choose to leave it there.<br/>

that Kate is equating making ice cream freely available to eat for breakfast <br/>
every day and the kid CHOOSING to do so. If anybody asked my kids, what do <br/>
you eat for breakfast, they&#39;d say they eat all kinds of things - a very very <br/>
wide variety of foods. But, we also always have ice cream available. I don&#39;t <br/>
think my kids ever eat ice cream for breakfast and, yes, ice cream goes gummy <br/>
in the freezer because it isn&#39;t all consumed just because it can be. <br/>

So - induct away &lt;G&gt;. All that it proves is that it is possible, of course, <br/>

<br/>
You&#39;d be surprised at what can put you in legal danger of loosing your <br/>
kids.  About 5 years ago, someone turned us in to CPS.  The person <br/>
said I only let Wyndham eat lettuce - mind you, this was a kid in the <br/>
90th percentile for height and weight for his age.  I still had to <br/>
deal with pushy social workers who came out and frightened my kids.  <br/>
Of course, I dealt by not letting them in my house and then firing off <br/>
a letter to their boss explaining that if someone couldn&#39;t <br/>
differential between my son and our Iguana (who does only eat lettuce <br/>
for the most part) it shouldn&#39;t be my problem and maybe they should <br/>
not take anonymous reports from people who are apparently insane.  I <br/>
also intimated that I would consider further pursuit of the matter <br/>
harassment and would consider taking legal action.  I got a real nice <br/>
letter back saying sorry for the inconvenience.<br/>
Much later we found out who had turned us in and ironically her son <br/>
was taken away from her by CPS a year or so later.<br/>
<br/>
But if you think you can do things outside the norms of &#39;accepted <br/>
society&#39; and not be in danger of legal problems, think again.  As <br/>
irrational as it seems, CPS seems to consider different to be bad.  At <br/>
least that&#39;s how it can be around here.<br/>

Hi Kate,<br/>
another question.<br/>
What are you afraid this will do? The likelyhood of him continuing to eat<br/>
bowls and bowls of Ice Cream every day is small. From what I have seen and<br/>
heard, he may do that again to make sure you really aren&#39;t going to say no<br/>
next time and once he trusts that you don&#39;t think of Ice Cream as some thing<br/>
extra ordinary, something to be given out according to Mom&#39;s desires, he<br/>
won&#39;t NEED to eat so much ice cream.<br/>

 When people loosen a longstanding TV limit, or video game limit, kids binge <br/>
 BIGTIME because (from accounts from the parents and kids, and from general <br/>
 knowledge of human behavior) they think it&#39;s a temporary lapse of the rules. <br/>
 <br/>
 It&#39;s a one-time special.  It&#39;s a festival.   They don&#39;t REALLY believe their <br/>
 parents are not going to stick the restrictions right back on. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can attest to the truth of this statement!!<br/>
The food I&#39;m seeing a lot more self regulation with these days, and funny <br/>
thing, I see NO bingeing behavior in the 5y.o. that has never had much <br/>
control over her diet.<br/>
Her brothers have had the control lifted just over a year ago, and they&#39;re <br/>
slowly getting better.<br/>
We just got cable after not having it for years and years, and the oldest is <br/>
still bingeing after a week.<br/>
I think if we&#39;d had decent tv prior to this it wouldn&#39;t be such a big deal <br/>
for him, but...<br/>
we had NO tv for 6 months, then crappy reception for another year.<br/>
So with the cable there is suddenly this whole world of opportunity he didn&#39;t <br/>
have.<br/>
It&#39;s very hard to see him in there day after day. But I know it&#39;s going to <br/>
become just another option, just like food, just like the computer, just like <br/>
everything else in their lives.<br/>
