I agree with you, but wonder how you feel about<br/>
individual therapy as well, such as vision therapy or<br/>
speech therapy or physical therapy?<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

<br/>
I agree that school is the last place a child with special needs <br/>
needs to  be.   Parents may feel inept and overwhelmed at dealing <br/>
with a special needs child.  They may feel that someone &quot;better <br/>
qualified&quot; can do a better job.  BELIEVE ME, it&#39;s not true.  YOU, as <br/>
their parent have thier best interests at heart, you know them better <br/>
than anyone else.  School is a horrible place for children who do not <br/>
fit the social and academic norms.  As daunting as dealing with a <br/>
special needs child on a 24/7 basis may seem, if they go to school, <br/>
the time you spend with them outside of school is going to be <br/>
severely compromised.  The difficulties they have will only <br/>
intensify, not just magically disappear.   Also, think of the <br/>
challanges of dealing with one special needs child.  Special Ed <br/>
teachers have several students, it&#39;s very rarely a one on one <br/>
situation, and if it is, it is for only a breif part of the day.  <br/>
Imagine dealing with a roomful of children who all have differing, <br/>
intense needs.. not a good situation.    KEEP THEM HOME!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-804206816">Sorry..I should have explained a little further. Sarah&#39;s IEP with the school is NOT our choice, it is a compromise to keep DSS off our back in regards to her because of the school calling DSS when she was in kindergarten when we wanted her off the medications and they were saying she had Asperger&#39;s, ODD, and OCD and we said we didn&#39;t want to test/evaluate her for them. The school called DSS to force us to keep her on the meds, etc. claiming mental health and educational neglect.<br/>
 <br/>
We are working on options to get out from under the IEP and be on our own completely, but it just may not be possible while we are living here. Only 15 months (OR LESS!!!) til TRANSFER!!!<br/>
 <br/>
Now, this is NOT at all to say that someone shouldn&#39;t make a similar agreement with a school if that is what they and the child feel will be in their best interests. I&#39;m simply saying that we&#39;d rather not be but have been forced into it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363166909">I have three of my kids that would qualify under special needs at <br/>
the school. Rob was in almost fulltime. Levi was in  for lack of <br/>
emotional and impulse control. Ashton was getting evaluated for her <br/>
learning disabilities when I said enough. <br/>
I have only been unschooling since this fall. I did school at home, <br/>
with frustration for all. <br/>
Here is my perspective.. My kids are unique. They are all unique. I <br/>
want them to be the best at whatever they enjoy. RIGHT now the boys <br/>
are into Diablo. And clay. Ashton is into writing. Everyones <br/>
confidence is growing every day.. Ashton asks how to spell the as <br/>
she writes. But reads the guide on the tv fluently. ROB played <br/>
Cranium today. He wanted to read every card with me.. ALthough his <br/>
reading is very jumbled and dislexic. He played the game as well as <br/>
any of us. Levi was up until 1.30 am watching a movie and had a <br/>
small meltdown today.. He needed to snuggle for a bit on the couch <br/>
and have his back tickled. I am going with the full confidence that <br/>
as they get to not worry about what they do not possess they will <br/>
get what they need. <br/>
When I see my kids I see their birthparents many times. Birthparents <br/>
that if they had experience kindness would not be so hurt and <br/>
damaged. My kids are amazing people they do not need to be fluent <br/>
readers or math geniuses they need to be secure and they need to <br/>
have joy and live their lives.<br/>
I had a woman ask if Olivia my three year old was retarded.. Very <br/>
funny. Olivia is delayed about nine months. She is also the most <br/>
whole person I ever met. <br/>

<br/>
Unschooling will work for all KINDS of kids regardless of the perceived <br/>
needs, if the parents will just really calm down and look at their children <br/>
directly, not through the lenses of scores and diagnoses and labels.   Being with <br/>
children in a very close and direct way isn&#39;t what most people are used to or <br/>
expecting.  I think it&#39;s what gives attachment parenting families a head start, <br/>
if they can make the transition smoothly (and don&#39;t just end up putting their <br/>
kids in school).<br/>
