<div id="ygrps-yiv-228447135">Hi!!<br/>
I wanted to introduce myself and ask a question.  My name is Leslie <br/>
Bachner.  I have been married for 14 1/2 years and have 3 children.  <br/>
The oldest is 16 almost 17, middle is 13, and the youngest is 1.  My <br/>
children have always been homeschooled. My daughter (oldest) is a <br/>
book worm.  I taught her how to read using the Spalding phonograms <br/>
and she took off and never looked back.  She has been a breeze to <br/>
homeschool.  The only rule I have had is that for every fictional <br/>
book that she checked out from the library she had to check out 3 non-<br/>
fiction and a biography.  My son, on the other hand, struggled to <br/>
learn how to read.  He hit the magical &quot;time to learn how to read <br/>
age&quot; and so off we went.... right into a brick wall.  By the time he <br/>
would put one phonogram together he had forgotten what the previous <br/>
one was.  So, we quit.  He didn&#39;t read his first real &quot;book&quot; until <br/>
about 1 1/2 years ago.  He started with the Lord of the Rings <br/>
trilogy.  He loves reptiles and I have encouraged that (and the study <br/>
of anything else he wanted).  It took me a long time to &quot;come out of <br/>
the closet&quot;, the unschooling closet that is.  I struggled with <br/>
feeling bound to all those books, guilty that I couldn&#39;t accomplish <br/>
it.  All I wanted to do was hang out with my kids.  So, here comes my <br/>
question.  Because my son hasn&#39;t been the reader that my daughter is <br/>
he is sorely lacking in spelling and grammar skills.  Trying to get <br/>
Math done ( I can&#39;t figure out how to unschool that) is like pulling <br/>
teeth.  I am beginning to feel like I am failing at homeschooling him <br/>
and feel that I could use some advice and encouragement.  Well, sorry <br/>
this was so long........I look forward to participating with the <br/>
group.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980915496">Hi Leslie,<br/>
Welcome to the list!<br/>
I just realized that I may have been a little rough in my reply to you, but <br/>
you&#39;re making some assumptions about what you&#39;re doing that, <br/>
well...   Please.  I want to encourage you, but I really feel the need to <br/>
point some stuff out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;book worm.  I taught her how to read using the Spalding phonograms<br/>
&gt;and she took off and never looked back.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to mess with your linguistics a little because they really do <br/>
affect how you think, and ask, did you really *teach* her to read, or was <br/>
she just ready to learn it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;She has been a breeze to<br/>
&gt;homeschool.  The only rule I have had is that for every fictional<br/>
&gt;book that she checked out from the library she had to check out 3 non-<br/>
&gt;fiction and a biography.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, what a bummer.  I&#39;d hate it if someone tried to tell me I had to have <br/>
a ratio for the kind of books I was &#39;allowed&#39; to check out.  Why do you <br/>
want to make this rule for her?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My son, on the other hand, struggled to<br/>
&gt;learn how to read.  He hit the magical &quot;time to learn how to read<br/>
&gt;age&quot; and so off we went....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How did he show you that it was the &#39;magical time to learn how to read <br/>
age&#39;?  Is there only one of those ages?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;right into a brick wall.  By the time he<br/>
&gt;would put one phonogram together he had forgotten what the previous<br/>
&gt;one was.  So, we quit.  He didn&#39;t read his first real &quot;book&quot; until<br/>
&gt;about 1 1/2 years ago.  He started with the Lord of the Rings<br/>
&gt;trilogy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s quite a &#39;book&#39; to start with.  My 13 year old likes Garfield <br/>
comics.  My 16 year old likes teen-confession and poetry books.  We listen <br/>
to Lord of the Rings on CD during long car trips.  Even *I* don&#39;t like to <br/>
read LoR in paper.  Snooooooooze.  Good for him for liking it so much.<br/>
<br/>
You still read out loud to him, right?  To all your kids, right?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He loves reptiles and I have encouraged that (and the study<br/>
&gt;of anything else he wanted).  It took me a long time to &quot;come out of<br/>
&gt;the closet&quot;, the unschooling closet that is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Might you still be working your way out of that durned closet, <br/>
maybe?  You&#39;re demanding your daughter read certain types of books and <br/>
(later in the message) you can&#39;t seem to find the math in your life.  You <br/>
aren&#39;t trusting that your son will someday find it important to improve his <br/>
grammar/spelling.  It&#39;s great that you&#39;re started on the pathway to <br/>
unschooling, and I want to encourage you to continue to plow on through <br/>
until you reach it, but I&#39;m hoping you&#39;re open to seeing that, well, it&#39;s a <br/>
work in progress? (like many of us.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I struggled with<br/>
&gt;feeling bound to all those books<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, some folks just aren&#39;t into bondage... Good for you for recognizing <br/>
that you&#39;re one of those folks!  (grin)  Hey, without a sense of humor, <br/>
we&#39;d all be fried by now, eh?<br/>
Have you tried untying yourself?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;, guilty that I couldn&#39;t accomplish<br/>
&gt;it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, of course not!!  Their learning isn&#39;t up to you!  Their learning is <br/>
up to THEM.  You&#39;re just there to throw interesting things in their <br/>
pathways, play taxi and talk with them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;All I wanted to do was hang out with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then do it.  Shut off the &quot;but, but, but, but...&quot; tape in your head and <br/>
hang out with your kids!  Go to movies!  Go to the library and pick out <br/>
WHATEVER they want!  Hang upside down from the monkey bars!  Eat Ice Cream <br/>
with Lots of Toppings!  Learn from them.  Fer&#39;gosh&#39;sake.  Follow your <br/>
instincts, not that &#39;we-should-be-learning-x-y-z&#39; rubbish.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So, here comes my<br/>
&gt;question.  Because my son hasn&#39;t been the reader that my daughter is<br/>
&gt;he is sorely lacking in spelling and grammar skills.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know a child who *still* wasn&#39;t &#39;potty trained&#39; at 4 years old.  One day, <br/>
it became important to him.  he worked at it and what do you know, within a <br/>
day, he was fully potty &#39;trained&#39;.  No mistakes, no rushing here and there, <br/>
just, done.  When your son thinks spelling is important, he&#39;ll start paying <br/>
attention and spell correctly.  If I thought it was important for YOU to <br/>
learn Lithuanian, but you didn&#39;t think it was important, how much effort <br/>
would you put into learning Lithuanian?  Probably not a lot.  Until, of <br/>
course, *you decided* you wanted to go to Lithuania.  See what I <br/>
mean?  (note the emphasis on *you decided* as opposed to it being imposed <br/>
on you.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Trying to get<br/>
&gt;Math done ( I can&#39;t figure out how to unschool that) is like pulling<br/>
&gt;teeth.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, once you get those teeth out, I&#39;m sure you could graph them according <br/>
to the size of the attached root, whether they&#39;re incisors, molars... okay, <br/>
okay. I&#39;m sorry, kinda, but not a whole lot.  It&#39;s one of my pet peeves.<br/>
How can you NOT see the math in everyday life?  Don&#39;t your kids have to buy <br/>
things?  Figure out how many of a something will fit into another <br/>
something?  Cook?  Tally their money?  Know if they have enough money for a <br/>
movie AND popcorn?  Figure how many seconds you&#39;ve been on the phone while <br/>
they&#39;ve been waiting?  and what&#39;s that in nano-seconds?  There&#39;s math <br/>
EVERYWHERE.  Maybe you could stop trying to figure out how to unschool it, <br/>
and try to figure out how it&#39;s *already* being unschooled?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am beginning to feel like I am failing at homeschooling him<br/>
&gt;and feel that I could use some advice and encouragement.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First of all, you&#39;ve taken a step in the right direction.  Second of all, <br/>
you&#39;re sending your kids mixed messages. You&#39;re not really <br/>
unschooling.  Not really.  not yet.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read unschooling.com and sandradodd.com?  Go and read &#39;em.  Think <br/>
of it as your homework (grin)  Lay off the kids completely for a while (as <br/>
if they were &#39;decompressing&#39; from public school) do whatever it is they <br/>
might be interested in doing and (you) spend some time talking about this <br/>
and that with folks on the unschooling boards and this list.  Don&#39;t try to <br/>
do ANYTHING schoolish, and that includes math or that library thing you <br/>
make your daughter do.<br/>
<br/>
When you have read at least a thousand posts (maybe more) and have gotten <br/>
completely mad at three different people over how we don&#39;t know what the <br/>
heck we&#39;re talking about, then finish being mad &#39;cause you see what we <br/>
might have meant, THEN go back to the kids.  You&#39;ll probably still be <br/>
sending them mixed messages, but maybe they&#39;ll be a little less mixed and <br/>
you&#39;ll feel a little less &#39;failured&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well, sorry<br/>
&gt;this was so long.....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I thought it was a really interesting post.  I only hope I <br/>
haven&#39;t scared you off entirely.<br/>
Not everyone&#39;s as cranky as I am right now. (smile)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-715251494">Leslie,<br/>
I am certainly a newbie at the home schooling, but I do love math!  There are <br/>
many ways to implement math without the typical worksheets, which provide no <br/>
real life application.  You can cook and increase or decrease a recipe by a <br/>
fraction, doubling, etc.  You can take a shopping trip looking at items of <br/>
interest to your son and let him determine what the discount would be.  At <br/>
the grocery store, he can make an estimate of his favorite fruits and <br/>
vegetables that you purchase and then weigh them checking his estimate.  He <br/>
could set up a budget by researching some of the careers he is interested in <br/>
and working off of a budget from what he would earn.  He would also be able <br/>
to research the educational requirements for the job that he desires.  He can <br/>
continue by searching for a house that would be within his budget.  He could <br/>
play a stock market simulation-there are books out there or several Internet <br/>
sites that would be of assistance.  It is just an unending journey of fun!  <br/>
He could even use athletics when learning geometrical concepts.  There are <br/>
many games that provide ways to increase logic skills and higher order <br/>
thinking skills, such as, Othello, SET (a card game), mancala, and much more. <br/>
 I hope this helps and as far as unschooling, I am not sure if this <br/>
qualifies-I know too little about the topic.<br/>
<br/>
I have come to realize that my daughter has worked hard her whole life, <br/>
struggled in school, and has had her talents stifled!  She is an avid <br/>
reader-up to 8 hours at a crack, writes her own chapter books, but is <br/>
receiving a D in English!  It just doesn&#39;t make sense.  I am doing research <br/>
regarding the unschooling and hope to have a program in place for next year.  <br/>
I am a single parent raising 3 children, working full time and am trying to <br/>
determine how to do this to make this successful and give my daughter the <br/>
opportunity to feel success!  She is truly talented, but I feel that she is <br/>
being held back from reaching success.  My daughter is just about 14.  Any <br/>
suggestions?  I would love to hear them!  I am from the Tacoma area and if <br/>
there are any groups that meet (at night) I would love to experience it!<br/>
<br/>
The best to your son!  <br/>

Well all this stuff is wonderful if the child is really interested in doing <br/>
everything you gave examples for. If he could care less about a budget or <br/>
Othello, than I certainly wouldn&#39;t use those as math examples to &quot;teach&quot; <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who says she is an unschooler. She thinks her kids have to <br/>
pick something to learn. That they can&#39;t just learn without announcing a <br/>
subject. Just because she doesn&#39;t make them choose one doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s <br/>
unschooling. She also gives her kids busy work. While redoing her kitchen, <br/>
she gave the kids all the particulars about the floor and asked them to <br/>
figure out how many tiles or whatever they would need to finish the job. Now <br/>
that&#39;s great that they could do it, but I&#39;m wondering if they really gave a <br/>
rat&#39;s ass about finishing the floor and how many tiles it would take. It <br/>
wasn&#39;t their idea to do it.<br/>
<br/>
My son is great in math. He&#39;s 8 and has for a long time gotten the idea of <br/>
numbers and how they work. It amazes me how good he is. My daughter could <br/>
care less about the number stuff he likes doing. We don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; math. Joseph <br/>
liked worksheets about 2 years ago and then decided it was useless on paper <br/>
and does it all in his head now. &lt;bg&gt; Sierra never has done any math on <br/>
paper. I&#39;ve never really heard her add numbers either. They both tell time <br/>
and figure out how long a program is and what time it will be over. They <br/>
like measuring stuff with the tape measure. Sierra loves to bake. Joseph <br/>
just loves to add numbers and see how high he can go until I have to check <br/>
it on paper or with a calculator. They like Sorry and Yahtzee and Monopoly. <br/>
They have their own money and always know how their account is fairing. They <br/>
love Legos and marbles. They dish out food among the three of them. Nothing <br/>
anywhere near what my in laws would consider math. I tend to think they&#39;re <br/>
wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-976144152">Holly was having a math fest tonight.  She said she would show me a trick and <br/>
she folded a perfectly good blank 3x5 card of mine (I only had one in here at <br/>
the time) in half and tore it in two.<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;HEY, that was mine!  I have lots more if you need them.  But now you <br/>
made two... (and I hesitated, because I&#39;m slow) ... 3x2 and a half cards.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She laughed and folded and tore them too.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;HEY, now you made two-and-a- half-by-one-and-a-halfs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said &quot;Just wait.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So she wrote the numerals one through four, one on each, told me to draw two <br/>
and multipy them.<br/>
<br/>
I drew 1 and 4.  She said &quot;What&#39;s the answer?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;4&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;YOU WIN!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s even.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said it was a Shari Lewis trick, an apparent game of chance to use with <br/>
little kids who fell that they never win games.  She wrote out all the <br/>
combinations in order on a piece of paper and showed me that only 1x3 comes <br/>
out odd and the rest are even.  <br/>
<br/>
Only thing is she was using a minus sigh between the numbers.  I told her she <br/>
needed an x for times.  She said &quot;I&#39;m going to use a star.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Like a calculator?  Okay.  But Kurt Vonnegut used that mark as a butthole.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kurt Vonnegut said everyone has a butthole and drew one, like this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Who&#39;s he?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He wrote crazy novels.  With pictures.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Obviously!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I was looking over her shoulder and said very seriously, &quot;So 3 butthole 4 <br/>
is even too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then she wrote a 1 on the back of each of those four.  She gave me all four <br/>
and was saying &quot;Make 3,214&quot; and I would rearrange them as quickly as I could. <br/>
  &quot;Make 1,432.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then she said &quot;Make 24.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I tried adding and stacking some, but couldn&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
She put them in order, and multiplied each one in.<br/>
1x2<br/>
2x3<br/>
6x4<br/>
<br/>
24!<br/>
<br/>
OH!<br/>
<br/>
So she turned them over to where they were all 1&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Make 24 out of those.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t make 24 out of those.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I CAN!&quot; she said, and proceded to touch them in turn  and count<br/>
1, 2, 3, 4, <br/>
and started at the beginning of the row<br/>
5, 6, 7, 8,<br/>
9, 10, 11, 12...  to 24.  Really fast.  <br/>
<br/>
She thinks in patterns.<br/>

I&#39;m thinking anyone who can&#39;t handle considering whether or not someone gives <br/>
a rat&#39;s ass about something is going to have a hard time unschooling.  Maybe <br/>
not.  But probably so.<br/>
<br/>
In my own life, I was thinking of a statement of faith situation for the <br/>
future at some point.  I don&#39;t even want to hang around with people who can <br/>
see no value in The Simpsons.  Anyone who will say they don&#39;t want their kids <br/>
wasting time playing on the computer, or that video games are good for <br/>
eye-hand coordination (as though catching flies weren&#39;t a lot cheaper than a <br/>
Playstation II), I don&#39;t want them around my children at all.   If I&#39;m going <br/>
to go to all the trouble and loss of income to homeschooling my children <br/>
until I&#39;m too old to get a job (I&#39;m 49.  I guess I thought I&#39;d have kids at <br/>
33, raise them, to back to work when I was done, when I was a little older, <br/>
maybe 37...)....   I don&#39;t want to have invested all that into my children <br/>
only to have their faith shaken and their integrity questioned by people who <br/>
think there&#39;s no value in parody and humor.<br/>
<br/>
So I need some kind of Swami-Beyondananda sort of Statement of Faith.  Maybe <br/>
make people sign it to visit, or to take my kids anywhere without me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll work on that later.  I have to leave midday tomorrow and won&#39;t be back <br/>
until late Sunday night, and maybe not here until Monday.  (So anyone who <br/>
wants a chance to sway the whole list away from whatever it is you think I <br/>
believe, start at noon Thursday and go for it.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is not about preparing your child for college.  If your child<br/>
does want to go to college, unschooling will prepare him to know how to find<br/>
information he needs and it will give him the confidence in himself that he<br/>
can learn what he wants and needs to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling means accepting that your child WILL learn what they need to<br/>
know.  Your child may not ever need math beyond consumer mathematics.  Or,<br/>
your child may love all things math and can&#39;t get enough of it, but couldn&#39;t<br/>
care less about history or literature.  Or something in between.<br/>
<br/>
If your unschooled child needs certain math knowledge for college, he will<br/>
be able to get it.  There are plenty of ways for people to learn math -<br/>
correspondence courses, community college, private tutor, homeschool<br/>
curriculum companies such as key to or Saxon, software programs, real life<br/>
experiences such as building, etc..<br/>

<br/>
I do agree with you about the difference between throwing out specific ideas and expecting the kids to start learning and trusting that your child will come to the ideas on their own. I think that you have to have lots of things avalible to them so that they can discover and learn in their own way. I think it means more to them when it&#39;s their idea, their creation, their whatever...you know just theirs instead of something that a parent has handed them. And I think that no matter how much you pad it in &#39;unschooloing lingo&#39; if the parent is handing it to the child, it&#39;s the parents, not the childs.<br/>
<br/>
Does this make sense? I&#39;m only on my second cup of coffee and my brain is still on auto pilot. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
What did you major in?  I was good at high school but I didn&#39;t<br/>
understand the higher levels of math at all.  I opted to take embryology<br/>
and genetics instead of physics and I didn&#39;t take calculus.  I graduated<br/>
third in my class, which would *not* have happened if I&#39;d taken physics<br/>
and calculus.  When I got to college I thought of getting a Bachelor of<br/>
Science degree and I&#39;d need higher math.  I took college level algebra<br/>
and barely scraped by with a C+ (my lowest grade in my life).  I<br/>
enrolled in calculus and quickly dropped it because I realized I would<br/>
definitely fail the class.  To this day I don&#39;t understand higher math.<br/>
But I switched my major to one of the many Bachelor of Arts degrees,<br/>
which didn&#39;t require any more math.  I dabbled around in psychology,<br/>
English, and political science before finally majoring in<br/>
telecommunications (video production).  I have never needed any higher<br/>
math.  My eyes cross and I get a headache when I try to do &quot;hard&quot; math.<br/>
But I&#39;ve never considered myself unsuccessful or even unintelligent<br/>
because of it.  It&#39;s just not my area, and there&#39;s really no reason it<br/>
has to be everyone&#39;s area.  There are relatively few careers that<br/>
actually require calculus, and the people drawn to those careers are the<br/>
people who naturally understand the subject matter and are drawn to it.<br/>

I can&#39;t even tell you how many times a mom has just stared shocked at me and then shaken her head when they find out that Jaiden and Avery have a tv/vcr combo with cable in their room. They can watch tv all day if they want to, sometimes they do, but thats usually when kids that cant watch at home come over and make a huge deal over the fact that the tv is on in the kids room and they have control over it (the only thing we ask is that they keep the volume to a reasonable level, our neighbors just had a baby and they share a bedroom wall with the kids).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503918467">Schools probably are more disastrous for math learning than for <br/>
anything else. They are really completely failing in that area - by <br/>
their own standards, much less by the standards that we unschoolers <br/>
would impose (kids learning for the love of it, gaining deep <br/>
understanding of concepts that interest them, joyfully gaining <br/>
competencies and finding personal satisfaction in achieving a greater <br/>
understanding of how the world works, building tools to use in pursuing <br/>
their passionate interests, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
I worry about math among unschoolers only because the parents have <br/>
almost all been &quot;schooled&quot; and therefore so often have some pretty <br/>
major negative math issues. If parents have anxiety or phobias about <br/>
math - resulting in negative attitudes, avoidance, etc., then I really <br/>
think that a bit of very conscious thinking about unschooling and math <br/>
is in order.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents are SO helpful to their kids, so supportive, so &quot;in <br/>
tune&quot; with their possible interests and needs -- and the parents <br/>
themselves are interesting and interested in so many things  -- that is <br/>
what really makes unschooling so great. But, if a parent has a mental <br/>
block in one area - if a parent has spent years building up their OWN <br/>
avoidance mechanisms - if a parent feels anxious or negative about <br/>
something - I think the parents need to make a conscious and specific <br/>
effort to get over it and to be the great <br/>
facilitators/supporters/encouragers that they are in other areas, <br/>
especially in mathematics, because it is SO everywhere and so likely <br/>
that their kids will be interested in something that involves math.<br/>
<br/>
Math is everywhere. It isn&#39;t necessary to separate math and &quot;unschool <br/>
everything but math.&quot;  But if parents are uncomfortable with it, then <br/>
they might not &quot;engage&quot; their kids like they do with other things. And, <br/>
they might have spent so many years getting comfortable with their own <br/>
desire to avoid it, that they might automatically be avoiding it and, <br/>
for unschooling parents, that can mean that they are NOT noticing a <br/>
kids&#39; developing interest - not noticing those moments when some <br/>
interesting math could be examined and NOT noticing the math learning <br/>
that is going on and that they could support.<br/>
<br/>
It is NOT important for kids to learn school type math. It does seem <br/>
important, to me, for kids to be, as they follow their interests with <br/>
the support and attention and encouragement and input of their loving <br/>
parents, gaining an underlying understanding of a variety of really <br/>
important mathematical concepts. This will happen automatically, just <br/>
like other learning, in a stimulating, learning-supporting, <br/>
curiosity-encouraged thinking, examining, investigating, wondering <br/>
unschooling home. But, it won&#39;t necessarily happen if parents <br/>
themselves are math anxious and do nothing about it to help themselves <br/>
get over it.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of parents know this, intuitively, and, not knowing what else to <br/>
do about it - wanting to make sure their kids &quot;get math,&quot; they <br/>
&quot;unschool everything but math.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mostly that just means they end up passing along their own math anxiety <br/>
to their kids.<br/>
<br/>
The underlying concepts that are important - and the few math skills <br/>
that are important - CAN be picked up (WILL be picked up) in a <br/>
math-healthy unschooling family. But I just have my doubts that there <br/>
are that many parents out there who are all that math-healthy unless <br/>
they put some specific directed effort into overcoming their schooling <br/>
and all its negative consequences.<br/>
<br/>
(I don&#39;t mean parents have to get over it themselves so much as they <br/>
have to be aware of it and consciously not pass it on to their kids.)<br/>

&gt;  I so understand, most of the parents I have met (homeschooling and schooling) heavily restrict time and content in the t.v. they allow their kids to watch. I can&#39;t even tell you how many times a mom has just stared shocked at me and then shaken her head when they find out that Jaiden and Avery have a tv/vcr combo with cable in their room. They can watch tv all day if they want to, sometimes they do, but thats usually when kids that cant watch at home come over and make a huge deal over the fact that the tv is on in the kids room and they have control over it (the only thing we ask is that they keep the volume to a reasonable level, our neighbors just had a baby and they share a bedroom wall with the kids).<br/>

It&#39;s easier than answering their own children honestly or having to get into discussions about it. They also stop inviting us round cos &#39;liitle Freddy&#39; may have used up his hour allocation for that day but one of mine may ask to look at a new game on the computer.

No, the point is IF all math exists in the real world, then it can be learned <br/>
where it is by those who need it.<br/>
<br/>
When people think math doesn&#39;t exist in the real world, others tell them <br/>
(sometimes sarcastically) that if it&#39;s not in the real world there&#39;s no <br/>
reason to learn it.  It IS in the real world; most people have only seen in <br/>
textbooks.<br/>

calculus and MANY people who aren&#39;t naturally drawn to it have to &quot;get <br/>

Nearly all social science degrees. There are lots and lots of people <br/>

school math and the calculus class is very very often what keeps them <br/>
FROM pursuing the degree they are really interested in. MANY people <br/>
avoid going into careers because they are math phobic. I&#39;ve seen a <br/>
number of surveys in which elementary school teachers admit that they <br/>
chose that career in place of what REALLY interested them, because they <br/>
were afraid of the math requirements. (Great - that explains a lot- <br/>
math-phobic people gravitate toward teaching elementary school!!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Calculus concepts are interesting and fun to play with - for almost all <br/>
kids. Formal calculus, forced on people who have already suffered <br/>
through torturous algebra, geometry, and trigonometry classes -- is <br/>
very very confusing and painful.<br/>

I understand. My mom decided that for xmas she was going to get Jaiden a bunch of preschool workbooks, she finds it wrong that we haven&#39;t forced him to learn how to write letters and numders yet (he&#39;s 4). So, those books have sat on Jaidens shelf, he&#39;s fliped through them a few times and done a couple pages with his uncle (whose 9) when they play school. But he&#39;s been in no rush to learn to write. The other day we where walking home from the zoo and JAiden started adding and subtracting ones from all the address signs he saw, hell I didn&#39;t even know he &quot;knew&quot; the numbers yet, he had so much fun with it. Yesterday he was drawing superhero pictures and telling me the story as he was drawing, when he was done he showed it to me, it wes covered in letters. He had decided to write the story down.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad that I didn&#39;t make him do those workbooks. He enjoyed himself so much by doing it his own way, in his own time. And I love that I get to be with him and watch him grow into his own person.<br/>

I&#39;ve had people stop coming over too, they say it&#39;s because when their kids are over they watch to much tv and it&#39;s because my kids watch it all the time. Now I&#39;ll admit that the tv is almost always on, but Jaiden and Avery are almost always doing something eles. The only times they really sit and just watch is when the kidos that have come over are sitting there transfixed and mine are sure they are missing something great or when a fave show has a new eppisode or its a new movie that we just got. I&#39;ve metioned to other parents that kids will do something other than watch tv, but they don&#39;t belive me. Mostly because they only see what happens when their here and their kids are making a much bigger deal about the tv, so my kids do to.<br/>
<br/>
Did this make any sense? I had to stop about 12 times while trying to write this. :-)<br/>
