<div id="ygrps-yiv-870641294">Hi Kelly!<br/>
<br/>
You know, I&#39;d really love to, but I&#39;d be just another target I&#39;m <br/>
sure. It&#39;s obvious that instead of really reading posts, certain <br/>
people here are intent on finding fault. It&#39;s a no-win situation.<br/>
<br/>
So instead, I&#39;ve created a folder entitled &quot;Gentle Discipline&quot; and <br/>
have added a few things for you all to read at your leisure. I&#39;d love <br/>
for you all to join me in adding to this if you&#39;d like. I&#39;ll also <br/>
include a few of my own ideas about guiding children non-violently. <br/>
Please feel free to post your own there as well.<br/>
<br/>
Peace to all,<br/>
<br/>
Jeva<br/>
