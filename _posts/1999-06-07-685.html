<div id="ygrps-yiv-522150734">My two year old LOVES work books.  I hate them, and I hate the <br/>
repetition and how they teach him.  Yesterday in church, I handed him a <br/>
pencil and my notebook to try to get him to be quiet.  The whole time, <br/>
he was tracing the lines side to side - no creativity at all.  He seemed <br/>
to be enjoying this activity, but I fear I&#39;ve ruined his way of <br/>
thinking.  Are there any workbooks out there for a two year old (he <br/>
knows all his colors, numbers, shapes, and letters - upper and lower <br/>
case and what they sound like) that encourage creativity?  But even at <br/>
this age, he&#39;s coloring within the lines (though not neatly), and IMO is <br/>
too rigid.  Of course, that may be just his personality (like my dad) - <br/>
I&#39;m so laid back, I can&#39;t understand why he would rather spend half an <br/>
hour in front of a workbook than go play outside (though he loves soccer <br/>
and baseball and playing with the neighborhood kids when they get out of <br/>
school) or something fun.  So is there anything out there anybody would <br/>
recommend?<br/>
<br/>
Also, at about what age do kids (I know every child is different, <br/>
but...) enjoy stories without pictures?  No matter how complicated the <br/>
story is, Mook (ds) enjoys it if it has pictures, but when I read even a <br/>
simple story without a colorful picture on every page (I like Mrs. <br/>
Piggle-Wiggle stories and Winnie the Pooh), he gets bored.  Not that I <br/>
expect him to sit still for hours, but even a five minute story seems <br/>
boring to him.  But if it has pictures, he&#39;ll sit with me and we&#39;ll <br/>
read for over an hour - I get tired before he does, and I just have to <br/>
distract him with something else.  I just look forward to reading <br/>
something other than &quot;Big Bird&#39;s Day on the Farm.&quot;  It may be nice to <br/>
just teach him to read - sometimes he seems ready, sometimes he doesn&#39;t, <br/>
but I don&#39;t know how to do it.  Anybody have any ideas?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-199163334">&lt;&lt;Also, at about what age do kids (I know every child is different, <br/>
but...) enjoy stories without pictures?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (who seemed to have been born loving stories) could listen to the Little House books and Winnie the Pooh when she was 3.  She was also able to listen to story tapes such as Jim Weiss&#39; Fairy Tale Favorites in Story and Song very early on.  Among her friends who are the same age (6) about half are interested in listening to a story with no pictures, while the others insist on pictures every few pages at least.  She is just beginning to read the very early readers now with no reading lessons at all.  BTW, she has an excellent auditory memory which is really wonderful.  She has the Winnie the Pooh books on tape and last year she could recite from memory one of the stories with all the grammar and inflections in the appropriate places.  I think this is a distinct advantage to reading later rather than earlier.<br/>
<br/>
My son, on the other hand, who has a speech delay and is completely the opposite of his sister is 4 3/4 and can hardly look at a picture book with a plot.  His favorites are books with pictures of heavy machinery and we just talk about the pictures.   <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry too much about your son.  There are lots of wonderful picture books with lovely stories.  If your son is destined to be an early reader, there shouldn&#39;t be any need to teach him.  He&#39;ll probably learn it on his own.  Let him lead the way.  If you really hate the Big Bird type of books, maybe they could secretly disappear and be replaced with ones you will enjoy reading again and again.  Perhaps you could try a storytelling tape geared for 3 year olds and just have it play while he is playing with blocks or something.  He probably will absorb more than you think.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what to say about the workbooks.  I have the same bias against them that you do and have yet to see any that inspire creativity.  We just provide the kids with lots of paper, colored pencils, crayons and markers and let them do their thing.<br/>

Have you heard of the Anti-coloring book series? They do things like having<br/>
part of a picture you must complete before you can color it, or they give<br/>
you a description and ask you to try drawing it. They encourage creativity<br/>
rather than saying there is one &quot;right&quot; way to color the pictures.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-239698914">&lt;&lt; Yesterday in church, I handed him a <br/>
pencil and my notebook to try to get him to be quiet.  The whole time, <br/>
he was tracing the lines side to side - no creativity at all. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But you don&#39;t know what he might have been thinking.  And tracing isn&#39;t that <br/>
easy for a little guy.  and straight lines aren&#39;t that easy for little guys.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He seemed <br/>
to be enjoying this activity, but I fear I&#39;ve ruined his way of <br/>
thinking.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Would &quot;not ruined&quot; be doing what he seems to enjoy?<br/>
I&#39;d say let him go.<br/>
<br/>
You might show him that if he draws straight lines across the page he ends up <br/>
with lots of little boxes and he could make patterns by coloring (even with <br/>
the pencil or pen) patterns in the boxes.<br/>
<br/>
For older kids with a straight line fascination you might take the thread out <br/>
of the sewing machine and let them follow lines on notebook paper with the <br/>
perforations the needlewill make.<br/>
<br/>
Marty used to get the American Girls catalog and &quot;sew&quot; along the edges of the <br/>
big dolls on the heavy papere and then give the pages to Holly to punch <br/>
out/tear on the dotted lines.<br/>
<br/>
Kids can make tickets and &quot;sew&quot; down the middle so the ticket stub can be <br/>
torn off if they&#39;re playing movies or making a play or a show.   That&#39;s just <br/>
straight lines.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I can&#39;t understand why he would rather spend half an <br/>
hour in front of a workbook than go play outside (though he loves soccer <br/>
and baseball and playing with the neighborhood kids when they get out of <br/>
school) or something fun.  So is there anything out there anybody would <br/>
recommend?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Let him do what he wants even if it&#39;s workbooks.<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to say &quot;GET YOUR NOSE OUT OF THAT BOOK AND GO OUTSIDE IN THE <br/>
SUNSHINE.&quot;   To this day I think my mom was an idiot.   She was jealous that <br/>
I had  something fascinating that she was neither involved in nor understood. <br/>
  I had sunshine time galore on my way to get out of my house as often as I <br/>
could to friends&#39; houses or music practices or school (I went to summer <br/>
school with glee one year, and left for college a year early because of the <br/>
books and book-loving adults there.)<br/>
<br/>
There are good stories about my mom, but as books and intellectual <br/>
stimulation went...  no.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also, at about what age do kids (I know every child is different, <br/>
but...) enjoy stories without pictures? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depends on the kid.  Maybe never.    If you compare your children to anyone <br/>
else&#39;s it&#39;s cause for undue joy or undue concern.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if he traces straight lines while you read he can last longer.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I just look forward to reading <br/>
something other than &quot;Big Bird&#39;s Day on the Farm.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There were books I dreaded reading again, but it&#39;s worth reading them the <br/>
books they want.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had wondered the same thing because my 6 year old really loves books that<br/>
are funny and colorful. He hasn&#39;t been interested in books with just text,<br/>
even though he can read very well. I  think it is because he is very visual<br/>
and likes to see images while he hears a story. Just for grins I bought a<br/>
non-picture book last week while we were at the bookstore: &quot;The Mouse and<br/>
the Motorcycle&quot;. I chose it because it appealed to me and I thought he<br/>
might enjoy it also. One night, before bed, I asked if anyone (my husband<br/>
and son) would like to hear some of the book I just bought. I started<br/>
reading it out loud and was surprised that everyone was enjoying hearing<br/>
it. We read quite a few chapters. Of course we don&#39;t read it every night.<br/>
But some nights my son will ask me to read him a chapter; it&#39;s an on-going<br/>
project. If my son hadn&#39;t been interested in hearing it, I would have put<br/>
it away until he was ready, if ever. I guess I can&#39;t resist the temptation<br/>
to introduce new things, but I&#39;m learning to back off if the idea doesn&#39;t<br/>
fly. I&#39;d say if your son is enjoying books of any kind that it&#39;s a great<br/>
beginning! <br/>

You know, my oldest loves work books too, he is a very structured child, and <br/>
they make him feel comfortable.  He is the kind of kid that is a <br/>
perfectionist and if he doesn&#39;t know how to do something he will just not do <br/>
it rather then be laughed at.  My youngest, however,!  HATES anything with <br/>
