<br/>
There&#39;s a whole section on the unschooling.com message boards for parents of<br/>
special needs children, that you may find worthwhile.  The moms that post<br/>
there have a great breadth and depth of experience.  I recommend it to<br/>
anyone who is looking for more support from people who have walked in the<br/>
same shoes.<br/>
<br/>
In general, the message boards can have more focused conversations, and a<br/>
wealth of knowledge is stored there, in fairly accessible form.<br/>
