<div id="ygrps-yiv-694295576">The American Girl catalogue came in the mail yesterday. We grabbed <br/>
the mail on our way out the driveway, and Katie got the American Girl <br/>
catalogue. She is interested in getting a Kit doll, and was looking <br/>
at things, checking out prices, and so forth. Adding up prices as she <br/>
went, so she&#39;d know how much she&#39;ll have to save to afford it.<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, she seems to be absorbing math by osmosis :) &quot;28+40 <br/>
equals 68&quot; didn&#39;t even ask me if that was right. She knew it was. <br/>
Then she said &quot;Mom, does 16 plus 16 equal 22?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She was on the right track, but something was telling her it wasn&#39;t <br/>
quite right. So I said &quot;no, it&#39;s 32. See, 6 plus 6 is 12, and 12 is <br/>
one ten and two ones&quot; and she said &quot;Oh! yeah!&quot; and went back to her <br/>
mental math. wow. Amazing. 1) that she knew when she was right, and <br/>
didn&#39;t have to ask me 2) that she sensed when something wasn&#39;t quite <br/>
making it, but didn&#39;t know why and 3) that she GRASPED IT <br/>
immediately! man...<br/>
<br/>
Another evidence of her quite superior brilliance :)...her dad is <br/>
doing some stretching exercises with a rope and pulley over the <br/>
bathroom door. (Broke his arm, and is stretching the muscles near the <br/>
shoulder as part of physical therapy)<br/>
<br/>
Well, the pulley and chord were sitting on the table. She picked it <br/>
up and looked at it for a sec. &quot;This would be really good in the <br/>
treehouse&quot; LOL Sort of like the time when she was about three and <br/>
wanted someone to get up and come see something. Her language was <br/>
such that she was hard to understand, and we were kind of ignoring <br/>
her. She went and got a ruler, placed it under my bum, and tried to <br/>
lever me out of my seat! LOL<br/>
<br/>
my genius <br/>
<br/>
and! she&#39;s starting to read!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981749363">That&#39;s actually dd learned to add and subtract double digit numbers--<br/>
saving her money for an AG doll.  <br/>
<br/>
Last time she did math with an AG catalogue she used a calculator and <br/>
informed me that she would need over 3000 dollars if she bought <br/>
everything she wanted...<br/>
