<div id="ygrps-yiv-185065785">Wow Pam.  Your post was incredible.  I just finished filling out a form for a homeschooling discussion list.  It asked me &quot;Style of Schooling.&quot;  I didn&#39;t know what to put and I felt kind of awkward.  I wondered, &quot;Am I doing this right because I don&#39;t really fit in anywhere.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
So I decided to write: I haven&#39;t really thought about it.  Hmmm I guess we are just your average homeschooling family.  Semi-structured. <br/>
<br/>
My name is Crystal and I have 3 boys 16mos, 3, 11 and I&#39;m so excited because now I fit in...I think.  Your description describes our family to a T- right now anyway.  I guess I&#39;m sorry of flopping back and forth between structured and unstructured.  For us, each activity has an educational purpose but our children lead the way.  It&#39;s up to me to be aware of their learning style and immediate interests so I may provide them with the resources so they can enjoy and benefit from their next learning journey.<br/>
<br/>
I joined this group because I&#39;d like to understand where I fit in and offer my children some new resources.... sometimes I run out of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>
<br/>

  &gt; I know that unschooling is the right choice for my son, but I many doubts<br/>
  &gt; about myself - am I patient enough, organised enough, dedicated enough,<br/>
  &gt; selfless enough to do it.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I would really like to hear what other people do. What does an average day<br/>
  &gt; in your life look like.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Unschooling can&#39;t really be encapsulated in a &quot;looks like&quot;, because it can<br/>
  look like so many things, including unschooled kids happily rampaging<br/>
  through a geometry book they dug out of the recycling bin, perhaps to their<br/>
  unschoolish parent&#39;s horror. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  We don&#39;t have much of an average day... we wake up <br/>
