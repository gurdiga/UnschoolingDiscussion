<div id="ygrps-yiv-154534462">Being a sort of newbie I just had to share this tidbit for other<br/>
newbies out there.<br/>
DS 14 and 10 decided to make level 60 characters in D & D just for fun.<br/>
(This gives them practically god-like ablilies. Quite cool!) They<br/>
spent hours on this.  Then they decided to have a battle. What<br/>
followed was dice rolling then some mulitplication and then addition<br/>
of at least 20 2-digit numbers with subtraction at the 3 to 4 digit<br/>
level.  They did this mostly in their heads with the occasional<br/>
scribble (they could have grabbed a calculator at any time.)<br/>
<br/>
I know that we don&#39;t always recognize math in our unschooling lives<br/>
and this may not make it any easier but..they were having such fun I<br/>
had to share.  I could not keep up with the mental additon etc they we<br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
Can you imagine making kids sit at a desk and do this?!  Shudder!!!<br/>
<br/>
Note to Sandra&#39;s kids and any other D & D players who may understand<br/>
the situation...whoever went first techically killed the first<br/>
(something about criticals?) but they continued to add up damage<br/>
anyway and then they would start over with the others turn.  Too funny!<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah and prior, they were working on buying items and trying to <br/>
spend 1 million gold pieces!  They had not done it yet.  I wasn&#39;t<br/>
there to help :) <br/>
