<div id="ygrps-yiv-551899411">The past few days have included posts about breastfeeding, public nudity, <br/>
ethical issues concerning formula companies. and spiritual belief systems.  If <br/>
you follow the threads back closely, you will find that the origin of all of <br/>
these discussions stemmed from  a post about Shryley dealing with her children&#39;s <br/>
outbursts of rage and harsh language  and my subsequent response to her.  It <br/>
is fascinating to me to see how discussions merge and split and take on lives <br/>
of thier own totally seperate from the original thoughts.  <br/>
<br/>
   I often think in this fashion, in tangents.. Sometimes I will realize a <br/>
thought or  idea or memory, and I will begin to trace back in my mind how I came <br/>
to that particular &quot;conclusion&quot;   It is always a wild ride back through my <br/>
train of thought.  I have seriously considered writing a book called &quot;Tangents&quot;  <br/>
or.. &quot;Multi Tracked Mind&quot;  or  &quot;Origins of Totally Unrelated Thoughts&quot;  LOL.. <br/>
But, I haven&#39;t actually done it.. Mostly because when I am doing this mind <br/>
tracking, I am not in a postion to write the thoughts down, and I can&#39;t remember <br/>
them later.  <br/>
<br/>
Making these types of connections, to me, is the essence of unschooling.   <br/>
Sandra talked about &quot;connecting the dots&quot; at the conference.    The recent <br/>
discussions are evidence of how this works.    Cool, huh?<br/>
