<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654757300">I just wanted to sympathize with you Kerri.<br/>
I&#39;m a certified health nut....while my family is varying shades of <br/>
grey on this issue.<br/>
<br/>
The way I deal with some of my heebie jeebies over hydrogenated <br/>
oils, sugar/dye/preservative laden foods is to buy the healthy <br/>
alternatives that my kids like. It makes me feel better, although <br/>
I&#39;m not sure how much nutritional value there is when they also eat <br/>
Krispy Kreme donuts and the like!!!<br/>
<br/>
I truly believe that happiness and joy have far greater effects on <br/>
health than any other single factor (other than genetics maybe).<br/>
*I* feel much more energized, balanced and soullful when eating <br/>
organic, vegetarian food. I also realize it&#39;s MY choice, not <br/>
everyone elses.<br/>
Not much to say here...other than, I understand.:)<br/>
