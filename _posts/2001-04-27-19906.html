If the pain is in your hands, try Chinese &quot;meditation<br/>
Balls&quot; that you manipulate in your hand.  My dad had<br/>
very severe arthritis in his shoulders and elbows<br/>
(tennis) and began physical therapy that involved<br/>
daily stretching with what he calls his &quot;rubber hose&quot;<br/>
lol.  He has a number of exercises that he does, and<br/>
explains that these help &quot;break up&quot; the arthritis,<br/>
whatever that means.  All I know is that the man who<br/>
could not lift his arms higher than shoulder height<br/>
can now scratch his own back and toss a ball to the<br/>
grandkids.  He has absolute mobility and no pain.<br/>

Yes, Ultimate Living has a wonderful Arthritis Formula.  I have seen <br/>
it work wonders.  It&#39;s not cheap, but its very effective, with no side <br/>
effects as compared with Darvoset, whose side effects can be <br/>
vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, feelings of elation or <br/>
depression, hallucinations, headache, kidney problems,<br/>
light-headedness, liver problems, minor visual disturbances, skin <br/>
rashes, weakness, yellowed eyes and skin.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, it does work.  But the Ultimate Living product I was talking <br/>
about has glucosamine sulfate, but not chondroitin, because they <br/>
could not find a source for chondroitin that was not contaminated <br/>
with bacteria.  So they do not put chondroitin in their product.  <br/>
Instead, they use a different combination of herbs that do the same <br/>
thing as chondroitin, and they still include the glucosamine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-546370341">Studies have shown that G.C. not only effectively<br/>
relieves pain but also helps to actually rebuild<br/>
cartilage.  My mother, however, did find that it was<br/>
too hard on her digestive system.  It certainly is<br/>
worth a shot, though!<br/>
