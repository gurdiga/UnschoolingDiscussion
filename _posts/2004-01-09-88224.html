in society that obese or overweight people are somehow &quot;less than&quot; or weaker <br/>
or lazier than people without weight problems, simply because they can&#39;t be <br/>
bothered to stop eating, or don&#39;t make healthy choices. This is simply not the <br/>
case at all<br/>
I am obese, and I see this a direct result of having been controlled so much <br/>
around food as a child. I never learned to self-regulate because I wasn&#39;t <br/>
allowed to do so, and because I thought that I would rarely be allowed to eat <br/>
&quot;junk&quot; , when it was available I couldn&#39;t stop eating it  till it was gone. Now <br/>
that I have started to allow myself free access to whatever I want to eat, when <br/>
ever I want it  , that feeling is dissipating.(sp)<br/>
A shame that I had to wait until I was 40  to start to release myself from <br/>
the emotional hold all that control around food had on me.<br/>
A person who is anorexic would never be accused of not having any &quot;willpower&quot; <br/>
to solve the problem.<br/>
Children make great decisions for themselves, and  it seems that the less <br/>
they are controlled the more they blossom and learn about themselves and their <br/>
own needs, food included.<br/>

A family is visiting here that we only see occasionally.  The teenaged <br/>
daughter is a little pudgy.  That&#39;s not bad, because she was a fat baby.  The mom <br/>
was always, her whole life, fat, and had gastric bypass surgery (risked dying <br/>
while she had a child because our culture is so unforgiving of variations).<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve had two more children.  The boy is SKINNY like his dad.  If anyone <br/>
saw him in isolation of the family, they might think he never gets to eat.  He <br/>
eats.   The baby, first birthday Monday, is and has been since the day she was <br/>
born, round in all parts.  It&#39;s not because she has no willpower, or that <br/>
she&#39;s lazy.  She hardly ever sleeps and she&#39;s pulling up on everything and every <br/>
body.<br/>
<br/>
I have three children.  My husband was fat from birth; I&#39;ve seen the pictures.<br/>
Kirby is the heaviest.  He&#39;s a bit soft in the face, and wears X-Large where <br/>
Marty wears Large.  Kirby exercises more than anyone here, because he&#39;s <br/>
involved in karate.  He&#39;s not doing karate to lose weight, he does it because he <br/>
likes it.  He was there three hours yesterday, because he taught an extra class <br/>
and took two classes.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is in most ways like his dad, physically, but has rarely pudged out as <br/>
he&#39;s grown taller.  He weighed himself before getting on the new high-wire <br/>
bike at the children&#39;s museum, and he was a little over 200 lbs (204?).  He turns <br/>
15 Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
Holly weighed herself there too.  Riders were supposed to be 90 lbs.  We <br/>
filled her pockets up with all nearby carkeys and pens; 89 lbs.   She&#39;s nearly as <br/>
tall as I am.<br/>
<br/>
None of my kids eat for fun or comfort.  They&#39;re confident and comfortable, <br/>
rarely bored, and they just aren&#39;t huge eaters.  Kirby eats least of all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to limit their food or shame them because of statistics, and <br/>
often that&#39;s what it boils down to.  And I lost count years ago of the stories <br/>
of people whose mothers put them on diets when they were ten, and then they <br/>
would sneak food at home or other places, and when they were older and felt <br/>
bereft of their mother&#39;s affection and approval, ate themselves silly.<br/>
<br/>
Happiness is way more important than people give it credit for being.  Some <br/>
can&#39;t begin to imagine it because they&#39;ve confused happiness with money or <br/>
weight loss or how new their car smells.<br/>
