&gt; <br/>
&gt; July 28, 1999                  by:  Phyllis Schlafly<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A scandal in mandatory mass vaccinations of infants is beginning to<br/>
&gt; surface. Vaccine-caused injuries have just forced the Clinton<br/>
&gt; bureaucrats to make four sensational announcements that bugle<br/>
&gt; temporary retreat from their plans to force all American children to<br/>
&gt; submit to government-dictated medical treatment. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On July 15, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the<br/>
&gt; American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) halted the use of the oral<br/>
&gt; rotavirus vaccine, which is given to infants to prevent one of the major<br/>
&gt; causes of diarrhea, after reports that the vaccine caused a bowel<br/>
&gt; obstruction in some infants that required surgery to repair. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The bowel obstruction, called intussusception, results when one<br/>
&gt; portion of the bowel slides inward, like a telescope, into another part<br/>
&gt; of the bowel and causes blockage. A previously healthy infant<br/>
&gt; suddenly screams in paroxysms of pain. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In its initial trial, the rotavirus vaccine appeared to cause<br/>
&gt; intussusception at 30 times the average rate, but the government<br/>
&gt; pretended that those injuries were insignificant. Instead of testing<br/>
&gt; further, the CDC and the vaccine manufacturer subjected babies to<br/>
&gt; more than a million doses of this unnecessary, expensive, and<br/>
&gt; inadequately tested vaccine. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While the risk of intussusception may have been mentioned on the<br/>
&gt; package insert, it was not on the vaccine information statement given<br/>
&gt; to parents. The arbitrariness of government vaccine mandates is<br/>
&gt; shown by the fact that, for the previous year, CDC was demanding<br/>
&gt; that the vaccine be given to all infants, and now suddenly a CDC<br/>
&gt; spokesman is saying, &quot;No one should now be giving rotavirus vaccine<br/>
&gt; to anyone.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The second sensational vaccine announcement came on July 9,<br/>
&gt; when the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) and the AAP issued a<br/>
&gt; joint statement cancelling their previous recommendation to inject all<br/>
&gt; newborns while they are still in the hospital with the hepatitis B<br/>
&gt; vaccine. PHS and AAP now recommend that vaccination of newborns<br/>
&gt; be limited to those who are at risk of getting hepatitis B from their<br/>
&gt; infected mothers. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Their remarkable backtracking from the universal mandate for<br/>
&gt; newborns must have resulted from the widespread publicity given to<br/>
&gt; the many cases of vaccine damage causing lifetime injury or death<br/>
&gt; reported on ABC&#39;s 20/20 and at the May 18 hearing conducted by the<br/>
&gt; U.S. House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and<br/>
&gt; Human Resources. PHS and AAP continue to recommend the<br/>
&gt; hepatitis B vaccine for infants at 2 to 6 months of age, even though<br/>
&gt; few of them are at risk. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Meanwhile, 42 states require the hepatitis B vaccine for<br/>
&gt; schoolchildren, although teachers and health care workers are not<br/>
&gt; required to receive it. The legislator who sponsored the hepatitis B<br/>
&gt; mandate in Ohio admitted that he did so at the request of a vaccine<br/>
&gt; manufacturer lobbyist, while Governor Christine Whitman is trying to<br/>
&gt; impose a New Jersey requirement administratively without legislation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In another announcement the same day, PHS-AAP issued a joint<br/>
&gt; statement that revealed the risk to children of vaccines containing<br/>
&gt; mercury and called on the FDA to &quot;assess the risk of all<br/>
&gt; mercury-containing food and drugs.&quot; A mercury product called<br/>
&gt; thimerosal is used as a preservative in many vaccines, even though<br/>
&gt; the FDA last year banned its use in over-the-counter products for<br/>
&gt; safety reasons. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Under the current CDC schedule, most infants receive a total of 15<br/>
&gt; doses of mercury-containing vaccines by the time they are six<br/>
&gt; months old, many given simultaneously. The fact that the FDA has<br/>
&gt; prohibited the use of thimerosal for most products, but continues to<br/>
&gt; allow its use for vaccines, sounds like political corruption in the<br/>
&gt; vaccine approval process. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The National Vaccine Information Center has been criticizing the use<br/>
&gt; of mercury in vaccines for many years. Contact lens solution bottles<br/>
&gt; routinely advertise that they contain &quot;no thimerosal,&quot; yet any damage<br/>
&gt; to adults from contact lens solutions must be minuscule compared to<br/>
&gt; the same product ingested or injected into infants. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The fourth announcement came on June 17, when government<br/>
&gt; officials voted to withdraw their recommendation for the use of the live<br/>
&gt; poliovirus vaccine, and to recommend the &quot;exclusive&quot; use of the<br/>
&gt; inactivated poliovirus vaccine. Since 1979, the only polio cases in the<br/>
&gt; United States have been caused by the live vaccine because, taken<br/>
&gt; by mouth, it travels through the child&#39;s body and can cause polio in a<br/>
&gt; parent changing the diaper. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The unjustified delay in converting to the safer polio vaccine is due to<br/>
&gt; mandatory vaccination laws that require the public to use a certain<br/>
&gt; product. The government still demands that babies be given four<br/>
&gt; doses of polio vaccine, even though, according to Surgeon General<br/>
&gt; David Satcher, M.D., &quot;The Western Hemisphere was certified by the<br/>
&gt; World Health Organization (WHO) as polio free in 1994, and no case<br/>
&gt; of polio has been reported in this region since 1991.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are long overdue for a Congressional investigation into the validity<br/>
&gt; of research and licensing standards for vaccines, the results of<br/>
&gt; clinical trials (if any), the motivations of the vaccine policymakers,<br/>
&gt; and the lobbying activities of the cash-rich pharmaceutical<br/>
&gt; corporations whose profits depend on universal mandates rather than<br/>
&gt; on sales to those at risk for various diseases. <br/>
&gt;                                                    <br/>

Hepatitis B Vaccine: School Nurse Perspective By Patti White, RN<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rpwhitey@...">rpwhitey@...</a>&gt; <br/>
{Patti says that this statement has been sent to every member of the<br/>
Government Reform Committee who will oversee the hepatitis B vaccine<br/>
hearings. The statement is also supported by the Missouri Central<br/>
District School Nurse Association.} <br/>
On behalf of the Missouri Central District School Nurse Association<br/>
(CDSNA) I ask you to consider the following school nurse perspective<br/>
regarding the safety of the hepatitis B vaccine that is being mandated<br/>
for all newborns and school age children in America. We ask you to<br/>
please consider the following information and submit it into the<br/>
congressional testimony. <br/>
As school nurses we are continually seeing more and more damaged<br/>
children entering our schools and we are very concerned that a<br/>
significant portion of that damage may be due to the hepatitis B vaccine<br/>
assault on the newborn neurological and immune system. <br/>
I am a registered professional nurse and the district health services<br/>
coordinator for a multi-school district. I am writing on behalf of all<br/>
the school nurses in our district. We have very grave concerns about the<br/>
hepatitis B vaccine. For the past three or four years our school<br/>
districts have noted a significant increase in the number of children<br/>
entering school with developmental disorders, learning disabilities,<br/>
attention deficit disorders and/or serious chronic illness such as<br/>
diabetes, asthma and seizure disorders. Each of the past four years has<br/>
been worse than the year before. There is only one common thread we can<br/>
identify in these children: they are the children who received the first<br/>
trial hepatitis B injections as newborns in the early 1990s. As the<br/>
hepatitis B compliance rate in newborns has gone up in our community, so<br/>
has the percentage of damaged children. This is very alarming. <br/>
Because of having so many damaged children we have tried to find the<br/>
long term clinical trials that ruled this vaccine &quot;safe and effective&quot;.<br/>
We discovered through an exhaustive Medline search that the FDA based<br/>
its decision to approve hepatitis B vaccine for administration in the<br/>
first hours of a newborn baby&#39;s life upon clinical trials and upon <br/>
post-marketing <br/>
surveillance studies in which patients and their doctors were asked to<br/>
report any adverse effects they noticed within 4-5 days after each<br/>
injection [4 days for SmithKline and 5 days for Merck]. The problems<br/>
being reported in increasing numbers as occurring after hepatitis B<br/>
vaccination appear to be autoimmune and neurological in origin. Such<br/>
problems take weeks to months to produce noticeable symptoms, and cannot<br/>
be spotted in a 4-5 day observation period. These are the only clinical<br/>
studies that have been done by Merck or SmithKline. There is not one<br/>
long-term study that we could find. The CDC and FDA have only these 4<br/>
and 5 day studies to base their statement of hepatitis B vaccine safety<br/>
on. It is amazing to us that they would be willing to risk our<br/>
children&#39;s future lives and health on these 4-5 day studies. It seems<br/>
only prudent to do long term consequence studies on the developing<br/>
neurological and immune systems of the newborns and infants injected<br/>
with this vaccine. It appears the only concern is protecting the vaccine<br/>
and denying the connection between these damaged children and the<br/>
hepatitis B shot they received within a few hours of birth. The CDC even<br/>
admits the lack of clinical study and states they do not even know how<br/>
long the vaccine will be effective. We found this amazing since the<br/>
vaccine was developed for a population at risk for hepatitis B: IV drug<br/>
users, high risk medical professionals and those who are involved in<br/>
high risk sexual practices. <br/>
In 1950 (before mass immunizations began), the USA had the third lowest<br/>
infant mortality rate in the world. By 1986, the USA dropped to 17th<br/>
place. In 1995 the USA dropped to 23rd and now the USA has dropped to<br/>
the appalling position of 24th in the health of its children (but the<br/>
USA is now first in vaccine compliance through government mandates).<br/>
Does this make you nervous too? <br/>
The elementary grades are overwhelmed with children who have symptoms of<br/>
neurological and/or immune system damage: epilepsy, seizure disorders,<br/>
various kinds of palsies, autism, mental retardation, learning<br/>
disabilities, juvenile-onset diabetes, asthma, vision / hearing loss,<br/>
and a multitude of new conduct/behavior disorders. We have come to<br/>
believe the hepatitis B vaccine is an assault on a newborns developing<br/>
neurological and immune system. Vaccines are supposed to be making us<br/>
healthier, however, in twenty five years of nursing I have never seen so<br/>
many damaged, sick kids. Something very, very wrong is happening to our<br/>
children. The census of ill children seen in our health rooms each day<br/>
has increased by 300% in only four years. It had remained relatively<br/>
constant in all the years before. <br/>
In our last regional school nurse meeting we discussed whether the<br/>
combination of so many viruses at one time (hepatitis B vaccine at the<br/>
same time of the DPT, OPV and MMR) is causing the infants immune system<br/>
to be overwhelmed and unable to mount a sufficient defense response. We<br/>
are advocating clinical studies to determine: Is the combination of all<br/>
these viruses at one time an assault on an infant&#39;s immune and<br/>
neurological system that increases the chances for adverse reaction AND<br/>
what are the long-term neurological and immune system responses to these<br/>
vaccines. We are all continuing to research this issue and will be happy<br/>
to share the many resources we have found with you. I hope you will do<br/>
the same as you open up this issue. <br/>
We (nurses, principals and teachers) have talked many times about the<br/>
possible cause(s) of the continuing increase in pervasive developmental<br/>
disorders (PDD), such as autism. From the literature we have found, we<br/>
should expect a rate for PDD of about 2-5 in 10,000. In our community<br/>
the rate in Kindergarten, 1st and 2nd grade is more like 1 in 150. The<br/>
teaching staff is overwhelmed. <br/>
As school nurses, we have had many parents calling and asking how they<br/>
can exempt their children from the hepatitis B vaccination (HPB). Many<br/>
of them have spent long hours in study and research perplexed over this<br/>
issue. For the past six months we have been studying documents, books<br/>
and research articles published by internationally respected doctors and<br/>
scientists that cause us grave concern. You must understand that we<br/>
began this study to reassure our parents and show them the truth about<br/>
how safe vaccines are. Unfortunately, our sincere, honest, dedicated<br/>
study has caused a complete reversal of our once strongly held beliefs.<br/>
Instead of being able to reassure the parents, we have found ourselves<br/>
being drawn deeper and deeper into this unbelievable controversy over<br/>
vaccines that is raging among physicians, scientists, researchers,<br/>
parents, and the government. We pray you will have the courage to shine<br/>
the light on this controversy through these hepatitis B hearings. <br/>
My daughters own experience with the hepatitis B vaccine made me much<br/>
more open-minded to the information we have been receiving from parents,<br/>
teachers and other nurses in our community. I personally have had to<br/>
research this on my own to determine if I have been enforcing a policy<br/>
that is actually harming more children than it will ever help. I have<br/>
spent countless hours reading books, vaccine-hearing testimony, research<br/>
papers, medical journal articles and Internet web-sites from around the<br/>
world. I did not come to my decision easily or lightly, I assure you.<br/>
Twenty-five years of total belief in something does not shake that<br/>
easily. I have repeated the well-rehearsed refrain &quot;Be Wise, Immunize&quot;<br/>
thousands of times during those years and reassured countless parents<br/>
that they were doing the right thing by vaccinating their precious<br/>
children . . . even the ones who came to me with serious doubts and<br/>
reservations. I will now have to live with that. <br/>
We are all now faced with a moral dilemma: will we protect the &quot;sacred<br/>
cow of conventional vaccine philosophy&quot; or will we stand up and speak<br/>
out for the &quot;health and well being of innocent children&quot;? We choose<br/>
children. We wonder, which will our government choose? <br/>
Because the hepatitis B vaccine was developed for those at risk of<br/>
disease, including IV drug users and sexually promiscuous individuals,<br/>
efforts to require administration of the vaccine to most, if not all of<br/>
the U.S. population is very controversial. The increasing number of<br/>
adverse reaction reports connected with this vaccine exacerbates the<br/>
controversy. The controversy stems to a great extent from our lack of<br/>
understanding of the mechanisms of the immune response to the hepatitis<br/>
B surface antigen and lack of long term follow-up of individuals who<br/>
have received the vaccine. In a January 27, 1999 press release, the<br/>
National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) released figures which show<br/>
that the number of hepatitis B vaccine-associated serious adverse event<br/>
and death reports in American children under the age of 14 outnumber the<br/>
reported cases of hepatitis B disease. <br/>
During our research we discovered a copy of the grant proposal submitted<br/>
recently to the National Institute of Health by Dr. B. S. Dunbar, who<br/>
has worked in autoimmunity and vaccine development for over twenty years<br/>
and was honored two years ago by the National Institute of Health. Dr.<br/>
Dunbar is working with a team of veteran vaccine researchers from all<br/>
over the world. Their grant is requested for the purpose of studying the<br/>
hypothesis that: hepatitis B recombinant vaccine does cause adverse<br/>
autoimmune reactions in genetically susceptible individuals. This study<br/>
will also provide new insights into the predictability of determining<br/>
adverse side effects of the hepatitis B vaccine in individuals at risk<br/>
as related to their histocompatability subtypes. Their study of<br/>
auto-immune diseases/symptoms caused by the hepatitis B vaccine include:<br/>
lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, vascular disorders, Guillain<br/>
Barre syndrome, demyelinating disorders such as optic neuritis<br/>
(blindness), Bells palsy, demyelinating neuropathy (multiple<br/>
developmental disorders), multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus and<br/>
chronic fatigue syndrome to mention the most common. <br/>
This group of internationally respected vaccine researchers headed up by<br/>
Dr. Dunbar also point out that, &quot;The studies (for the approval of HPB)<br/>
were not designed to assess serious, rare adverse events; the total<br/>
number of recipients were too small; and the follow-up was too short to<br/>
detect rare or delayed, serious, adverse reactions.&quot; Finally they point<br/>
out that &quot;overall the number of examples of adverse neurologic outcomes<br/>
following receipt of hepatitis B vaccine are of concern, particularly<br/>
those resulting in demyelinating neurologic disease.&quot; <br/>
They continue, &quot;In view of these observations. . . it is medically<br/>
crucial to evaluate the nature of the autoimmune reactions (i.e. risks)<br/>
associated with the hepatitis B vaccine and to determine if individuals<br/>
who will have these adverse reactions can be identified in advance of<br/>
receiving the vaccine&quot;. There are critical questions that must be<br/>
addressed to establish <br/>
the risk/benefit of the current hepatitis B vaccines in the United<br/>
States. These questions are particularly important in view of recent<br/>
mandates to vaccinate all children including newborn infants.&quot; <br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://webpages.netlink.co.nz/~ias/dunbar.htm">http://webpages.netlink.co.nz/~ias/dunbar.htm</a> <br/>
Many groups have called for a moratorium on hepatitis B vaccination<br/>
until some of these questions can be answered adequately. The NVIC<br/>
reported &quot;Newborn babies are dying shortly after their shots and their<br/>
deaths are being written off as sudden infant death syndrome. Parents<br/>
should have the right to give their informed consent to vaccination and<br/>
Congress should give emergency, priority funding to independent<br/>
scientists, who can take an unbiased look at this vaccine, instead of<br/>
leaving the search for truth in the hands of government officials who<br/>
have already decided to force every child to get the vaccine&quot;. We agree<br/>
completely. The NVIC can be contacted at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.909shot.com">http://www.909shot.com</a> for<br/>
further information. <br/>
In Dr. Coulters book, &quot;Vaccination, Social Violence, and Criminality&quot;<br/>
the thesis is developed that the &quot;sociopathic personality&quot; which has<br/>
emerged on a mass scale in recent decades, and which is responsible for<br/>
a disproportionate amount of crime and violence, is causally linked to<br/>
the childhood vaccination program. Vaccination frequently causes<br/>
encephalitis and neuropathy that in turn leads to these<br/>
post-encephalitic states and conditions. In his book, Dr. Coulter<br/>
presents a time line of increase in developmental disability related to<br/>
vaccine introduction that is indeed frightening. Dr. Coulter believes<br/>
about 20% of our children are suffering from this neurological vaccine<br/>
damage. We believe some of these vaccine experts should be on the<br/>
President&#39;s Youth Violence task force. <br/>
Our own school district&#39;s confidential health statistics show at least<br/>
20% of our children (K-3) have significant neurological damage and/or<br/>
chronic illness. The last three years have shown an acceleration in the<br/>
numbers of children who are entering our schools with these<br/>
&quot;developmental disorders&quot;. (Could these be the same infants who received<br/>
the first trial doses of hepatitis B as only a few hour-old newborns?)<br/>
As school nurses, working with these damaged children on a daily basis,<br/>
we pray this is not true. If it is, the ramification to this generation<br/>
of children is unthinkable! <br/>
Should we not pause, call for a moratorium on these poorly tested,<br/>
rapidly approved vaccines, and allow independent American physicians and<br/>
researchers to study them before blindly injecting an experimental<br/>
vaccine into an entire generation? (We have found the only ones<br/>
declaring the vaccines safety are the ones who are making millions of<br/>
dollars from its sales, whose employment depends on it or the ones being<br/>
funded by the drug companies vast number of grants and fundings. The<br/>
independent researchers seem to be coming up with an entirely different<br/>
report.) Vaccine producers have nothing to lose since our U.S. Congress<br/>
has made them immune from responsibility or liability for injuries<br/>
caused from their vaccines. The push is on for them to create more and<br/>
more vaccines. There are huge amounts of money being made by these<br/>
people who no longer worry about the consequences of their inadequate<br/>
clinical trials. The United States government has had to pay out nearly<br/>
a billion dollars in damages to families who can prove their children<br/>
have been damaged or killed by vaccines, and there are thousands more<br/>
cases pending. I just read that there are so many vaccine damage claims<br/>
that Secretary Shalala changed the rules to try to limit adverse<br/>
reaction claims. Could this be true? If so, shame on our government. <br/>
We believe, as medical professionals, that we are doing a great<br/>
disservice to our country by forcing government mandated vaccines on all<br/>
children. Please research this and we pray you have the courage to speak<br/>
out and tell the nation what you find. <br/>

ADVOCACY GROUPS CALL FOR RESEARCH TO INVESTIGATE LINK BETWEEN AUTISM<br/>
INCREASE AND VACCINATION<br/>
<br/>
Responding to a new report released yesterday by the California Health and<br/>
Human Services Agency revealing a 273 percent increase in California<br/>
children diagnosed with autism during the past decade, the National Vaccine<br/>
Information Center and three other advocacy organizations representing<br/>
parents of autistic children are calling for independent scientific research<br/>
into whether increased vaccination in early childhood is a contributing<br/>
co-factor to the development of autism...<br/>

&gt;Hepatitis B Vaccine: School Nurse Perspective By Patti White, RN<br/>
&gt;&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rpwhitey@...">rpwhitey@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;{Patti says that this statement has been sent to every member of the<br/>
&gt;Government Reform Committee who will oversee the hepatitis B vaccine<br/>
&gt;hearings. The statement is also supported by the Missouri Central<br/>
&gt;District School Nurse Association.}<br/>
&gt;On behalf of the Missouri Central District School Nurse Association<br/>
&gt;(CDSNA) I ask you to consider the following school nurse perspective<br/>
&gt;regarding the safety of the hepatitis B vaccine that is being mandated<br/>
&gt;for all newborns and school age children in America. We ask you to<br/>
&gt;please consider the following information and submit it into the<br/>
&gt;congressional testimony.<br/>
&gt;As school nurses we are continually seeing more and more damaged<br/>
&gt;children entering our schools and we are very concerned that a<br/>
&gt;significant portion of that damage may be due to the hepatitis B vaccine<br/>
&gt;assault on the newborn neurological and immune system.<br/>
&gt;I am a registered professional nurse and the district health services<br/>
&gt;coordinator for a multi-school district. I am writing on behalf of all<br/>
&gt;the school nurses in our district. We have very grave concerns about the<br/>
&gt;hepatitis B vaccine. For the past three or four years our school<br/>
&gt;districts have noted a significant increase in the number of children<br/>
&gt;entering school with developmental disorders, learning disabilities,<br/>
&gt;attention deficit disorders and/or serious chronic illness such as<br/>
&gt;diabetes, asthma and seizure disorders. Each of the past four years has<br/>
&gt;been worse than the year before. There is only one common thread we can<br/>
&gt;identify in these children: they are the children who received the first<br/>
&gt;trial hepatitis B injections as newborns in the early 1990s. As the<br/>
&gt;hepatitis B compliance rate in newborns has gone up in our community, so<br/>
&gt;has the percentage of damaged children. This is very alarming.<br/>
&gt;Because of having so many damaged children we have tried to find the<br/>
&gt;long term clinical trials that ruled this vaccine &quot;safe and effective&quot;.<br/>
&gt;We discovered through an exhaustive Medline search that the FDA based<br/>
&gt;its decision to approve hepatitis B vaccine for administration in the<br/>
&gt;first hours of a newborn baby&#39;s life upon clinical trials and upon<br/>
&gt;post-marketing<br/>
&gt;surveillance studies in which patients and their doctors were asked to<br/>
&gt;report any adverse effects they noticed within 4-5 days after each<br/>
&gt;injection [4 days for SmithKline and 5 days for Merck]. The problems<br/>
&gt;being reported in increasing numbers as occurring after hepatitis B<br/>
&gt;vaccination appear to be autoimmune and neurological in origin. Such<br/>
&gt;problems take weeks to months to produce noticeable symptoms, and cannot<br/>
&gt;be spotted in a 4-5 day observation period. These are the only clinical<br/>
&gt;studies that have been done by Merck or SmithKline. There is not one<br/>
&gt;long-term study that we could find. The CDC and FDA have only these 4<br/>
&gt;and 5 day studies to base their statement of hepatitis B vaccine safety<br/>
&gt;on. It is amazing to us that they would be willing to risk our<br/>
&gt;children&#39;s future lives and health on these 4-5 day studies. It seems<br/>
&gt;only prudent to do long term consequence studies on the developing<br/>
&gt;neurological and immune systems of the newborns and infants injected<br/>
&gt;with this vaccine. It appears the only concern is protecting the vaccine<br/>
&gt;and denying the connection between these damaged children and the<br/>
&gt;hepatitis B shot they received within a few hours of birth. The CDC even<br/>
&gt;admits the lack of clinical study and states they do not even know how<br/>
&gt;long the vaccine will be effective. We found this amazing since the<br/>
&gt;vaccine was developed for a population at risk for hepatitis B: IV drug<br/>
&gt;users, high risk medical professionals and those who are involved in<br/>
&gt;high risk sexual practices.<br/>
&gt;In 1950 (before mass immunizations began), the USA had the third lowest<br/>
&gt;infant mortality rate in the world. By 1986, the USA dropped to 17th<br/>
&gt;place. In 1995 the USA dropped to 23rd and now the USA has dropped to<br/>
&gt;the appalling position of 24th in the health of its children (but the<br/>
&gt;USA is now first in vaccine compliance through government mandates).<br/>
&gt;Does this make you nervous too?<br/>
&gt;The elementary grades are overwhelmed with children who have symptoms of<br/>
&gt;neurological and/or immune system damage: epilepsy, seizure disorders,<br/>
&gt;various kinds of palsies, autism, mental retardation, learning<br/>
&gt;disabilities, juvenile-onset diabetes, asthma, vision / hearing loss,<br/>
&gt;and a multitude of new conduct/behavior disorders. We have come to<br/>
&gt;believe the hepatitis B vaccine is an assault on a newborns developing<br/>
&gt;neurological and immune system. Vaccines are supposed to be making us<br/>
&gt;healthier, however, in twenty five years of nursing I have never seen so<br/>
&gt;many damaged, sick kids. Something very, very wrong is happening to our<br/>
&gt;children. The census of ill children seen in our health rooms each day<br/>
&gt;has increased by 300% in only four years. It had remained relatively<br/>
&gt;constant in all the years before.<br/>
&gt;In our last regional school nurse meeting we discussed whether the<br/>
&gt;combination of so many viruses at one time (hepatitis B vaccine at the<br/>
&gt;same time of the DPT, OPV and MMR) is causing the infants immune system<br/>
&gt;to be overwhelmed and unable to mount a sufficient defense response. We<br/>
&gt;are advocating clinical studies to determine: Is the combination of all<br/>
&gt;these viruses at one time an assault on an infant&#39;s immune and<br/>
&gt;neurological system that increases the chances for adverse reaction AND<br/>
&gt;what are the long-term neurological and immune system responses to these<br/>
&gt;vaccines. We are all continuing to research this issue and will be happy<br/>
&gt;to share the many resources we have found with you. I hope you will do<br/>
&gt;the same as you open up this issue.<br/>
&gt;We (nurses, principals and teachers) have talked many times about the<br/>
&gt;possible cause(s) of the continuing increase in pervasive developmental<br/>
&gt;disorders (PDD), such as autism. From the literature we have found, we<br/>
&gt;should expect a rate for PDD of about 2-5 in 10,000. In our community<br/>
&gt;the rate in Kindergarten, 1st and 2nd grade is more like 1 in 150. The<br/>
&gt;teaching staff is overwhelmed.<br/>
&gt;As school nurses, we have had many parents calling and asking how they<br/>
&gt;can exempt their children from the hepatitis B vaccination (HPB). Many<br/>
&gt;of them have spent long hours in study and research perplexed over this<br/>
&gt;issue. For the past six months we have been studying documents, books<br/>
&gt;and research articles published by internationally respected doctors and<br/>
&gt;scientists that cause us grave concern. You must understand that we<br/>
&gt;began this study to reassure our parents and show them the truth about<br/>
&gt;how safe vaccines are. Unfortunately, our sincere, honest, dedicated<br/>
&gt;study has caused a complete reversal of our once strongly held beliefs.<br/>
&gt;Instead of being able to reassure the parents, we have found ourselves<br/>
&gt;being drawn deeper and deeper into this unbelievable controversy over<br/>
&gt;vaccines that is raging among physicians, scientists, researchers,<br/>
&gt;parents, and the government. We pray you will have the courage to shine<br/>
&gt;the light on this controversy through these hepatitis B hearings.<br/>
&gt;My daughters own experience with the hepatitis B vaccine made me much<br/>
&gt;more open-minded to the information we have been receiving from parents,<br/>
&gt;teachers and other nurses in our community. I personally have had to<br/>
&gt;research this on my own to determine if I have been enforcing a policy<br/>
&gt;that is actually harming more children than it will ever help. I have<br/>
&gt;spent countless hours reading books, vaccine-hearing testimony, research<br/>
&gt;papers, medical journal articles and Internet web-sites from around the<br/>
&gt;world. I did not come to my decision easily or lightly, I assure you.<br/>
&gt;Twenty-five years of total belief in something does not shake that<br/>
&gt;easily. I have repeated the well-rehearsed refrain &quot;Be Wise, Immunize&quot;<br/>
&gt;thousands of times during those years and reassured countless parents<br/>
&gt;that they were doing the right thing by vaccinating their precious<br/>
&gt;children . . . even the ones who came to me with serious doubts and<br/>
&gt;reservations. I will now have to live with that.<br/>
&gt;We are all now faced with a moral dilemma: will we protect the &quot;sacred<br/>
&gt;cow of conventional vaccine philosophy&quot; or will we stand up and speak<br/>
&gt;out for the &quot;health and well being of innocent children&quot;? We choose<br/>
&gt;children. We wonder, which will our government choose?<br/>
&gt;Because the hepatitis B vaccine was developed for those at risk of<br/>
&gt;disease, including IV drug users and sexually promiscuous individuals,<br/>
&gt;efforts to require administration of the vaccine to most, if not all of<br/>
&gt;the U.S. population is very controversial. The increasing number of<br/>
&gt;adverse reaction reports connected with this vaccine exacerbates the<br/>
&gt;controversy. The controversy stems to a great extent from our lack of<br/>
&gt;understanding of the mechanisms of the immune response to the hepatitis<br/>
&gt;B surface antigen and lack of long term follow-up of individuals who<br/>
&gt;have received the vaccine. In a January 27, 1999 press release, the<br/>
&gt;National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) released figures which show<br/>
&gt;that the number of hepatitis B vaccine-associated serious adverse event<br/>
&gt;and death reports in American children under the age of 14 outnumber the<br/>
&gt;reported cases of hepatitis B disease.<br/>
&gt;During our research we discovered a copy of the grant proposal submitted<br/>
&gt;recently to the National Institute of Health by Dr. B. S. Dunbar, who<br/>
&gt;has worked in autoimmunity and vaccine development for over twenty years<br/>
&gt;and was honored two years ago by the National Institute of Health. Dr.<br/>
&gt;Dunbar is working with a team of veteran vaccine researchers from all<br/>
&gt;over the world. Their grant is requested for the purpose of studying the<br/>
&gt;hypothesis that: hepatitis B recombinant vaccine does cause adverse<br/>
&gt;autoimmune reactions in genetically susceptible individuals. This study<br/>
&gt;will also provide new insights into the predictability of determining<br/>
&gt;adverse side effects of the hepatitis B vaccine in individuals at risk<br/>
&gt;as related to their histocompatability subtypes. Their study of<br/>
&gt;auto-immune diseases/symptoms caused by the hepatitis B vaccine include:<br/>
&gt;lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, vascular disorders, Guillain<br/>
&gt;Barre syndrome, demyelinating disorders such as optic neuritis<br/>
&gt;(blindness), Bells palsy, demyelinating neuropathy (multiple<br/>
&gt;developmental disorders), multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus and<br/>
&gt;chronic fatigue syndrome to mention the most common.<br/>
&gt;This group of internationally respected vaccine researchers headed up by<br/>
&gt;Dr. Dunbar also point out that, &quot;The studies (for the approval of HPB)<br/>
&gt;were not designed to assess serious, rare adverse events; the total<br/>
&gt;number of recipients were too small; and the follow-up was too short to<br/>
&gt;detect rare or delayed, serious, adverse reactions.&quot; Finally they point<br/>
&gt;out that &quot;overall the number of examples of adverse neurologic outcomes<br/>
&gt;following receipt of hepatitis B vaccine are of concern, particularly<br/>
&gt;those resulting in demyelinating neurologic disease.&quot;<br/>
&gt;They continue, &quot;In view of these observations. . . it is medically<br/>
&gt;crucial to evaluate the nature of the autoimmune reactions (i.e. risks)<br/>
&gt;associated with the hepatitis B vaccine and to determine if individuals<br/>
&gt;who will have these adverse reactions can be identified in advance of<br/>
&gt;receiving the vaccine&quot;. There are critical questions that must be<br/>
&gt;addressed to establish<br/>
&gt;the risk/benefit of the current hepatitis B vaccines in the United<br/>
&gt;States. These questions are particularly important in view of recent<br/>
&gt;mandates to vaccinate all children including newborn infants.&quot;<br/>

&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://webpages.netlink.co.nz/~ias/dunbar.htm">http://webpages.netlink.co.nz/~ias/dunbar.htm</a><br/>
&gt;Many groups have called for a moratorium on hepatitis B vaccination<br/>
&gt;until some of these questions can be answered adequately. The NVIC<br/>
&gt;reported &quot;Newborn babies are dying shortly after their shots and their<br/>
&gt;deaths are being written off as sudden infant death syndrome. Parents<br/>
&gt;should have the right to give their informed consent to vaccination and<br/>
&gt;Congress should give emergency, priority funding to independent<br/>
&gt;scientists, who can take an unbiased look at this vaccine, instead of<br/>
&gt;leaving the search for truth in the hands of government officials who<br/>
&gt;have already decided to force every child to get the vaccine&quot;. We agree<br/>
&gt;completely. The NVIC can be contacted at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.909shot.com">http://www.909shot.com</a> for<br/>
&gt;further information.<br/>
&gt;In Dr. Coulters book, &quot;Vaccination, Social Violence, and Criminality&quot;<br/>
&gt;the thesis is developed that the &quot;sociopathic personality&quot; which has<br/>
&gt;emerged on a mass scale in recent decades, and which is responsible for<br/>
&gt;a disproportionate amount of crime and violence, is causally linked to<br/>
&gt;the childhood vaccination program. Vaccination frequently causes<br/>
&gt;encephalitis and neuropathy that in turn leads to these<br/>
&gt;post-encephalitic states and conditions. In his book, Dr. Coulter<br/>
&gt;presents a time line of increase in developmental disability related to<br/>
&gt;vaccine introduction that is indeed frightening. Dr. Coulter believes<br/>
&gt;about 20% of our children are suffering from this neurological vaccine<br/>
&gt;damage. We believe some of these vaccine experts should be on the<br/>
&gt;President&#39;s Youth Violence task force.<br/>
&gt;Our own school district&#39;s confidential health statistics show at least<br/>
&gt;20% of our children (K-3) have significant neurological damage and/or<br/>
&gt;chronic illness. The last three years have shown an acceleration in the<br/>
&gt;numbers of children who are entering our schools with these<br/>
&gt;&quot;developmental disorders&quot;. (Could these be the same infants who received<br/>
&gt;the first trial doses of hepatitis B as only a few hour-old newborns?)<br/>
&gt;As school nurses, working with these damaged children on a daily basis,<br/>
&gt;we pray this is not true. If it is, the ramification to this generation<br/>
&gt;of children is unthinkable!<br/>
&gt;Should we not pause, call for a moratorium on these poorly tested,<br/>
&gt;rapidly approved vaccines, and allow independent American physicians and<br/>
&gt;researchers to study them before blindly injecting an experimental<br/>
&gt;vaccine into an entire generation? (We have found the only ones<br/>
&gt;declaring the vaccines safety are the ones who are making millions of<br/>
&gt;dollars from its sales, whose employment depends on it or the ones being<br/>
&gt;funded by the drug companies vast number of grants and fundings. The<br/>
&gt;independent researchers seem to be coming up with an entirely different<br/>
&gt;report.) Vaccine producers have nothing to lose since our U.S. Congress<br/>
&gt;has made them immune from responsibility or liability for injuries<br/>
&gt;caused from their vaccines. The push is on for them to create more and<br/>
&gt;more vaccines. There are huge amounts of money being made by these<br/>
&gt;people who no longer worry about the consequences of their inadequate<br/>
&gt;clinical trials. The United States government has had to pay out nearly<br/>
&gt;a billion dollars in damages to families who can prove their children<br/>
&gt;have been damaged or killed by vaccines, and there are thousands more<br/>
&gt;cases pending. I just read that there are so many vaccine damage claims<br/>
&gt;that Secretary Shalala changed the rules to try to limit adverse<br/>
&gt;reaction claims. Could this be true? If so, shame on our government.<br/>
&gt;We believe, as medical professionals, that we are doing a great<br/>
&gt;disservice to our country by forcing government mandated vaccines on all<br/>
&gt;children. Please research this and we pray you have the courage to speak<br/>
&gt;out and tell the nation what you find.<br/>

&quot;Protecting our society from debilitating and deadly diseases that can be<br/>
prevented through the administration of vaccines is a cornerstone for<br/>
ensuring the health and well-being of our citizens. Vaccines are highly<br/>

in health costs annually. We are working diligently to ensure that vaccines<br/>
licensed in the United States are as safe and effective as they can be. We<br/>
have a stringent regulatory process for licensing vaccines that serves as a<br/>
model for all countries.&quot;...<br/>
