&gt; &gt; I love it when I hear parents that do not gender-label toys or colors!<br/>

&gt; &gt; That&#39;s awesome! but here&#39;s a question for all. If one&#39;s son were a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;fairy&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; would that change your feeling or acceptance? Words can be very<br/>
&gt; &gt; powerful<br/>
&gt; &gt; things and  can be hurtful even if not intended to be. I don&#39;t &quot;worry<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; my son or daughter would be gay or lesbian. I worry that they won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; content, happy confident, caring individual.<br/>

&gt; My 6 year old son is firmly convinced he IS a fairy *g*. In fact, he had<br/>
&gt; a fairy costume for Halloween. It got some raised eyebrows, but HE loved<br/>
&gt; it. As far as sexual preferences, however, who knows? He IS only six. If<br/>
&gt; I had to guess, though, I&#39;d guess he&#39;s gonna turn out bisexual, like his<br/>
&gt; mother.<br/>
