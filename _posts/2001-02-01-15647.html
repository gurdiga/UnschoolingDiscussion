<div id="ygrps-yiv-678719138">I have my own business.  It&#39;s a catalog shopping company that I&#39;ve been<br/>
with for almost 5 years.  I don&#39;t stock, inventory or deliver any<br/>
products.  I just set up the accounts and get paid.  There&#39;s a 96%<br/>
re-order rate, the products make sense and are need based and unique to<br/>
this company which has been around for over 15 years.  It gives me the<br/>
flexibility and income out family needs and I can continue to build it<br/>
and give myself my own raise.  If this is the kind of business you&#39;re<br/>
looking for, feel free to e-mail me.  Good Luck on your search!<br/>
