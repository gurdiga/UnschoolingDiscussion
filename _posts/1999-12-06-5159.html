Thanks for the support! Unfortunately, the surfing culture has battled to<br/>
overcome the stigma of drugged out bums, and many people still have a<br/>
negative concept of the sport. Actually, professional surfers make quite<br/>
a good income, but I also want him to have a strong educational<br/>
background. Besides, how long can ANY professional sports career last? I<br/>
also want to portray homeschoolers in an academic light, as many people<br/>
have an ignorant view of hsers as drop outs, or losers who can&#39;t cope<br/>
with life. I hate that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, you know Diane, about the worst thing you can do is uncork a proud<br/>
Mommy! I will try to be brief! (Right!) Adam started competing in local<br/>
surfing contests at age 8, and was winning by age 10. He has traveled<br/>
solo to Costa Rica three times, and Hawaii once. While in Costa Rica, he<br/>
stayed at a Christian Surfing camp on the coast in Jaco. He has spent six<br/>
weeks in all training out there. He traveled to California last June with<br/>
his Dad, and won first place at NSSA Nationals for his division! This<br/>
really opened so many doors. Adam has been featured several times in<br/>
Surfing and Surfer magazines... pictures and small write ups. He has<br/>
surfboard, clothing, shoe, sunglass and deckpad sponsors who provide<br/>
everything (and more) that he could possibly need. They also pay him<br/>
travel allowance, as well as his entry fees and $$ bonuses for contest<br/>
wins. His surfboard/clothing sponsor, Rusty, sent him to Hawaii for two<br/>
weeks in October. He stayed with the Rusty team at a beautiful three<br/>
story home on the North shore. There were good aspects and bad aspects to<br/>
this trip, most of the negative centers around the influence of older<br/>
boys, and young men. We have worked hard to assist Adam in making &quot;right&quot;<br/>
choices. In an industry where injury can take it all away overnight, we<br/>
take things one day at a time. He has plans to go to Puerto Rico,<br/>
California, and Costa Rica this coming year. If perchance he burns out on<br/>
his sport, or does not have what it takes to make it, he would like to<br/>
attend chef school. (?) Possibly a harebrained scheme as he certainly is<br/>
never in MY kitchen! Ho ho. Anyhow... it has all been crazy, and it is a<br/>
lot for a little 11 year old. The responsibility has been good for him,<br/>
and he has matured greatly through his travel experiences. He is still my<br/>
sweet baby though, and I still tuck him in at night, and read to him.<br/>
Harry Potter is still his favorite book, and torturing his older sisters<br/>
is still his favorite pastime! So he really hasn&#39;t changed in a lot of<br/>
ways. As you can see, I love to talk about this. I&#39;m like one of those<br/>
senior citizens who love to discuss bowel problems. Ahem. Anyhow...<br/>
thanks for asking. The travel is most exciting for him, and I know one<br/>
day, when he&#39;s grown, he will look back at his amazing fortune and<br/>
hopefully know how lucky he was.<br/>

have been hard for you to let him start travelling alone.  Keep us <br/>
posted on his progress.  I don&#39;t think you have anything to worry <br/>
about unschooling-wise.  He&#39;s getting quite an education just <br/>

<br/>
I love what I&#39;ve been reading here, and have been trying to form some sort<br/>
of introduction for myself for the past week, so I can contribute.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot I want to tell, and I think some of you might be interested in<br/>
hearing about parts of my life, but then again, maybe not.  So I&#39;ve decided<br/>
to put it all on a web page for anyone who is interested in a grown-up,<br/>
highschool rise-out.<br/>
I&#39;ll send a link as soon as I have it up.<br/>
<br/>
For now, here&#39;s the basics:  female; married; age 30; 2 daughters, ages 7<br/>
and 11; live in the burbs of Battle Ground, WA.  We&#39;ve been homeschooling<br/>
since 1994.  My older daughter spent 2nd and 3rd grade in public school, the<br/>
younger one spent about 3 months in Kindergarten.  That was more than enough<br/>
for both of them, they assure me.<br/>
<br/>
I happened to stumble upon an interesting page at the Mensa institute<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mfgc.org.uk/mfgc/faq.html#highly_intelligent_behavioural_problems">http://www.mfgc.org.uk/mfgc/faq.html#highly_intelligent_behavioural_problems</a><br/>
(I&#39;m NOT a member, just looking for info) that lists some of the traits of<br/>
gifted kids.  It also gives advice on how to teach your gifted child, but<br/>
it&#39;s just basically what everyone here is already doing, I imagine.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I think this is long enough for an intro! :)  Take care.<br/>

: one who learns from life and love and great books and late morning<br/>
conversations and BIG PROJECTS and eccentric uncles and mountains and<br/>
mistakes and volunteering and starry nights--instead of from classrooms and<br/>
exceedingly dull textbooks and sedative lectures and interfering homework.<br/>
Synonyms: HOMESCHOOLER, SELF-SCHOOLER, AUTODIDACT, RISE-OUT.&quot;  On the back,<br/>
this quote from The Teenage Liberation Handbook:  &quot;The most overwhelming<br/>
reality of school is CONTROL.  School controls the way you spend your time<br/>
(what is life made of if not time?), how you behave, what you read, and to a<br/>
large extent what you think.  In school you can&#39;t control your own life.<br/>
Outside of school you can, at least to the extent that your parents trust<br/>
you to.&#39;Comparing me to those who are conventionally schooled,&#39; writes a<br/>
12-year-old unschooler, &quot;Is like comparing the freedoms of a wild stallion<br/>
to those of cattle in a feedlot.&#39;<br/>

 Your son sounds like he is having a wonderful life!  How hard it must be<br/>
for you to let him go, I know it sure would be for me.  I just wanted to add<br/>
that my dh does not read on his own unless its a motorcross magazine or the<br/>
instruction manual to my new camera and he is a very successful contractor. <br/>
I wonder if there is any correlation between those who are very hands on/<br/>
physical/engineering/fabricating kind of people who do not read much?  It <br/>
sure makes sense in our family.  I am not so hands on and I read voraciously. <br/>
