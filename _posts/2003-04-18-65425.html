are all on AOL. I seem to be getting all the messages.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing to do but wait for it to clear up. Or write and complain which has<br/>
the same effect.<br/>

missing messages, verified by checking the website for messages. I wonder if <br/>
they aren&#39;t skipped on digest, but who wants to wait a whole day for that &lt;<br/>
bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 I have been going  and reading at the web more. AOL&#39;s message boards were <br/>
down last night for a while, so hoping maybe they were fixing some <br/>
things......but there still aint much talking going on here, aside from that. <br/>
Holiday weekend and people are traveling? <br/>
<br/>
Well I gotta go boil a ton of eggs LOL <br/>

Happy Easter!<br/>

&lt;&lt; This may happen with any of the large ISPs or mail providers if they<br/>
experience temporary server problems and have to severely curtail their<br/>
incoming mail for a period of time until the servers are fixed and list mail<br/>
like Yahoogroups is always the first thing they restrict.   <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">      &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That makes sense.  Lists are the bulk mail of the internet.  First class mail <br/>
WILL be delivered, but flyers from the grocery store (or yahoogroups) might <br/>
end up on the floor of the mailman&#39;s truck.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll save that for next time someone wonders. I might not be able to find it, <br/>
but if some of you say &quot;Sandra, didn&#39;t you save that fine explanation of why  <br/>
mail bounces?&quot;  I&#39;ll look for it. <br/>
