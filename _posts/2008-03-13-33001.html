<div id="ygrps-yiv-765855063">My 7 1/2 year old (will be 8 in July), Marti, asked me two days ago if she<br/>
could have her own room so she could keep it clean and so she could make her<br/>
bed (uh, okay, right? &lt;G&gt;) So we have been reworking our house to suit her<br/>
desires.<br/>
<br/>
Last night was her first night in her &quot;new room&quot; which isn&#39;t completely<br/>
finished and still has some of my sewing stuff in it, but she doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
to mind. She was perfectly fine with it all, even though she has slept in<br/>
our room (on and off, usually in her own bed) since she was 6 months old.<br/>
<br/>
However, my youngest, Lilly, who is 4 years old (turned 4 in November) is<br/>
having a really hard time without her sister. Her and her sister have slept<br/>
together in the same queen sized bed for about 2-2 1/2 years. I doubt Lil<br/>
even remembers when she DIDN&#39;T sleep with Marti.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if I could get some ideas from you about how I can make Lil<br/>
more comfortable. Lil is still in our room, still in the queen bed which is<br/>
pushed right up next to mine and her &quot;spot&quot; is right next to mine.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it would help to mention that we have a tentative &quot;bedtime&quot;<br/>
and bedtime routine only because Lil chooses it to be that way. Lil is a<br/>
morning person (like me) and gets up early. She usually mentions getting<br/>
tired around 8-9pm and that is when we go upstairs. We brush teeth (or I do<br/>
and she watches a good portion of the time), get pjs on and head to bed for<br/>
a story. Sometimes Marti is in there for the story. Sometimes she isn&#39;t. She<br/>
was last night and Marti was even nice enough to lay with Lil last night<br/>
until she fell asleep.<br/>
<br/>
Any other ideas on how to help? Marti won&#39;t likely be willing to lay with<br/>
her every night.<br/>

My first thoughts are for you to talk to her in the dark, tell her  <br/>
stories, rub her back, give her extra-much attention.<br/>
Maybe tell stories about when she was a baby, and about before she  <br/>
was born.  Maybe talk to her a little sometimes about someday she  <br/>
might want her own room, or her own house, and you will come and  <br/>
visit her and see what she has on her shelves. My kids loved chit- <br/>
chat like that, about them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t try to put it all into one night, but make it all about her.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My sister&#39;s kids always slept together whent they were little and at <br/>
about the same ages as yours, the older one decided to sleep in her own <br/>
bed.  They got a bunkbed so that they could be in the same room <br/>
together.  <br/>
<br/>
For about 2 yrs, the littlest one climbed into bed with the younger one <br/>
in the middle of the night and no one seemed to mind.  They would start <br/>
off in their own beds and end up snuggled together.<br/>
<br/>
The older child had really wanted her own bed, but ended up sharing it <br/>
anyway.  She still had her own bed and I think that made most of the <br/>
difference, it was the idea of it being hers, and since it was hers, <br/>
she allowed her sister to use it too.</div>
