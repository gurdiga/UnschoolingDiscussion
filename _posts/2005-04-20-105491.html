<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872393082">After all this talk about neighborhood predators and such, I remembered <br/>
something that was posted on another list.  It was interesting to me and I had not <br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
If you google your phone number (I think it&#39;s just those who are listed) it <br/>
will pop up your name and click buttons to get map and driving directions right <br/>
to your house.  I&#39;m not terribly worried about it, as we are unlisted but it <br/>
is a little strange to know that your number and directions to your front door <br/>
are on the internet.  If you do show up, you can click on your number at the <br/>
top of the listing and it will take you to a page that you can opt out of this <br/>
feature and be taken off the list.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought it may be of interest as we were talking about street safety and <br/>
taking precautions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-766501749">HI-I thought I&#39;d played this game before, but just plugged in the <br/>
number acquired with the new place last year and it came up with a <br/>
name and address I&#39;ve never heard before (still here in our town, of <br/>
course) -- even from the occasional long-lost friend, incredulous <br/>
creditor, or repeat solicitor (despite the fact that our number is <br/>
on the DO NOT CALL list -- under our name, however.)  <br/>
<br/>
I use RandMcNally.com for directions more often than Google or the <br/>
others, anyway.  All you need is a name and city/state to get a <br/>
street address and away you go... my kids insist that the odds of <br/>
being preyed upon by someone online aren&#39;t much higher now than <br/>
offline now that the &#39;Net has gotten so popular.  I&#39;ve gotten much <br/>
looser about letting our real identities out after all these years <br/>
of surfing the Web.  Maybe that&#39;s a mistake I&#39;ll regret someday, but <br/>
I figured if I was someone like Sandra Dodd or other homeschoolers <br/>
in the limelight -- the family would be out in the public eye, <br/>
anyhow.  I can&#39;t live in fear of some wacko who may or may not be <br/>
watching online or off.<br/>
<br/>
One of my neighbors told the tale of a teen from her hometown who <br/>
met with ill fate after being seen in a local news article on <br/>
winning a surfing award.  The guy befriended the family and then <br/>
took the kid for a long ride, never to return.  We had been <br/>
discussing our family&#39;s pending interview for a running club feature <br/>
when this little item came up.  Our family members&#39; names and <br/>
hometown were already all over the World Wide Web in numerous <br/>
places, including road race results from family &quot;field trips&quot; that <br/>
take us to events near and far -- so if someone&#39;s out to get us, it <br/>
really wouldn&#39;t take much to find our humble home.  <br/>
<br/>
Guess the best we can do is keep the faith and hope and pray for <br/>
sanity in the world.  Take care, Amigos ~<br/>

 <br/>
We&#39;ve been listed in the phone book.  Before I was a public-eye  homeschooler <br/>
I was a public-eye SCA corporate and regional officer, and that  club has <br/>
nuts too.  I&#39;ve never had any trouble.<br/>

 <br/>
The newspapers are full of people every day.  So is the phone  book.<br/>
Before that kid won the surfing award, I figure he/she was out at the  beach <br/>
a LOT of hours without mom or dad right there.<br/>
 <br/>
People here are talking about kids never being out of their sight, but  <br/>
that&#39;s a luxury that only homeschoolers can hope to have.  If our kids went  to <br/>
school, they would have been out of our sight regularly from the age of five  or <br/>
so, every day, often walking to school and back or standing around at bus  <br/>
stops, sometimes very isolated bus stops out in the mountains or the  country.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833599852">Why is this an issue? Any one can find my address from dozens of<br/>
sources....then mapquest directions to my house. Anyone with my phone number<br/>
can look up my address in the phone book or call information for my address<br/>
then get directions.  Taking your name off a list like this isn&#39;t going to<br/>
keep anyone who wants to find you from finding you.  I&#39;m not trying to cause<br/>
trouble....I just don&#39;t see how this is going to keep my family any safer.<br/>

was merely info.  that may or may not be of any help to those who read it.<br/>
<br/>
It was just something that had never occured to me.  I found it interesting.  <br/>
If I make the choice to pay a fee to keep my number and info. unlisted, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want it showing up on the internet.  Same with those who don&#39;t mind it <br/>
being in the phone book, but they may not appreciate it being so easily <br/>
accessible to the world via the computer.<br/>
