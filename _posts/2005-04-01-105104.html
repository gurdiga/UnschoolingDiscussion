Yesterday was my 21st wedding anniversary.  It&#39;s easy to remember, March 31, <br/>
because when we were planning the wedding, Keith said he could wake up the <br/>
next morning and say &quot;APRIL FOOL&#39;S!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t believe everything you read on the internet today.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-524885009">Marty had already told me Homestar Runner had an April Fool&#39;s thing going,  <br/>
but PLEASE don&#39;t anyone miss seeing it.  Anyone who has ever liked Homestar  <br/>
Runner should look.<br/>
 <br/>
_http://www.homestarrunner.com_ (http://www.homestarrunner.com) <br/>
 <br/>
Click whatever it will let you click.  Don&#39;t miss the 7 second free  trial.<br/>
If you fill out the order form, it will tell you when your package will  <br/>
arrive.<br/>
And there&#39;s a sample cartoon.  Art humor.  <br/>
<br/>
It might all be gone tomorrow, to check it out!<br/>
 <br/>
If the rates were worrying you, wait until you see that it&#39;s $9.95 per  month <br/>
or $499.95 per week, annual savings.<br/>
 <br/>
Kids might even have more fun than moms, but I doubt it!<br/>
