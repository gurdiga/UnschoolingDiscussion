 </span></blockquote>Hello! and welcome to the &#39;club&#39; :-)<br/>
For me, I come to lists such as this one for like-minded support. <br/>
With the relatives, after trying to educate them about the wonderful <br/>
option of unschooling (and failing to do so), I don&#39;t bring it up and <br/>
we rarely talk about our kids&#39; education at family gatherings because <br/>
after years of hurt feelings and ruined holidays, we&#39;ve learned not <br/>
to talk :(. Sad, but true. <br/>
After a few solid attempts at trying to explain your choices to your <br/>
family, make a decision as to how you&#39;re going to deal with them and <br/>
then move on with or without their support. You will always have <br/>
other unschooling families on lists such as this that you can turn to <br/>
for support. Meanwhile, as your kids grow and blossom, with luck, the <br/>
relatives will one day change their minds...<br/>
Best of luck,<br/>
Sarah<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-228576001">I think that often people make their negative feedback based on incorrect<br/>
assumptions.  Perhaps you could either give them a book to read on<br/>
unschooling or write a statement about what it means to you and what you<br/>
want for your sons.  It is always easier to write something down and give it<br/>
to them to read than to publically defend your position to nay-sayers.<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-347795258">I know that can be rough.  We didn&#39;t have too much trouble with that <br/>
because my son had some special issues and it was clear to everyone <br/>
we knew that school was not the right environment.  But I have dealt <br/>
with this sort of thing with other issues in which I <br/>
am &quot;unconventional&quot; in some ways.  Some key things that help for me <br/>
are:<br/>
<br/>
1. finding support<br/>
2. don&#39;t bring it up if it&#39;s not necessary<br/>
3. be positive and confident<br/>
4. be clear that you made your choice based on what works best for <br/>
you--sometimes people are defensive because they feel judged by <br/>
homeschoolers, or they wish they could homeschool but feel they can&#39;t <br/>
for some reason<br/>
5. be matter-of-fact if people get pushy, something like &quot;Thank you <br/>
for being concerned, but we are happy with our decision&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-76779064">I have a 5 year old and 1 year old boy as well, and know just what you are<br/>
talking about.  My husband&#39;s family is horrified at the idea of our<br/>
homeschooling, much less unschooling.  They didn&#39;t like the idea of me<br/>
nursing past three months, letting the boys sleep with us as babies, and any<br/>
number of other parenting issues.  (This from a family whose 6 year old son<br/>
is in therapy twice a week.)  We politely listen to them and just let it go<br/>
as much as we can.  I get upset, but after all these years I am learning to<br/>
let it go for my own sanity.  My brother and his wife are vocal to mutual<br/>
acquaintances (not directly to us) that they think we are doing something<br/>
terribly wrong.  Friends who wouldn&#39;t dream of counseling us on other issues<br/>
feel completely free to tell us that they think homeschooling, particularly<br/>
unschooling of course, is a dangerous thing.  I&#39;ve been treated to stories of<br/>
children in their teens who cannot count, read or write and will never become<br/>
productive members of society.<br/>
<br/>
But you and I both know that we want what is best for our kids, and that if<br/>
they were truly falling behind, we would do something about it.  We also know<br/>
that our children will be happier, healthier and likely more capable after<br/>
their unschooling experience than the children of these people who feel<br/>
perfectly comfortable criticizing our very personal parenting decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there.  Today I feel like iron.  Tomorrow someone will cut me to the<br/>
quick.  Either way, I will unschool and see the special light in the eyes of<br/>
my boys as they spend 18 consecutive days drawing, catching, watching,<br/>
reading about, and constructing clay & wooden models of ladybugs for no<br/>
reason but that it interests them.  Deep cleansing breath!<br/>

out of what I wrote from my heart and pick at it.  But, ok, here&#39;s my<br/>
response.<br/>
<br/>
Surely a thinking person could allow that there might be a child or two out<br/>
there in the world who might not thrive as an unschooler, for one reason or<br/>
another.  As a parent, I would want to be watchful for that failure to<br/>
thrive, just as I would want to be watchful for signs of a physical problem<br/>
that might develop with my child regardless of the fact that I have no<br/>
expectations that one might develop.  Should I see a problem, I would adjust<br/>
our learning environment accordingly because my child&#39;s happiness and growth<br/>
is much more important to me than adherence to a teaching philosophy.  To not<br/>
allow for this potentiality would make me as rigid and fanatical at my<br/>
child&#39;s expense as so many accuse unschoolers of being.  If I did nothing, my<br/>
child might fall behind his potential and miss the joy of learning because I<br/>
insisted I must unschool at all costs.<br/>
<br/>
I did not mean that if my son falls behind some arbitrary standard that he<br/>
needs to read at age 5, add three digit numbers at age 7, etc., I&#39;d put him<br/>
on a curriculum immediately.  How sad that this is what you apparently read<br/>
into my post.  Congratulations.  I now feel as judged in a group I had hoped<br/>
from whom I might find some support as I do by those who criticize my<br/>
parenting decisions.<br/>

In unschooling there is no &quot;ahead or behind&quot;...that is the beauty of <br/>
it.<br/>
Kids can learn what they want WHEN they want....and when they&#39;re <br/>
ready.<br/>
If a child is perceived as &quot;behind&quot; because they don&#39;t read until age <br/>
11, that is meaningless in the unschool world. Because we trust that <br/>
our kids will learn what they need but also WHEN they&#39;re ready.<br/>

Yea, that&#39;s always hard, huh?  Email....far from a perfect form of<br/>

*should* be doing.  Once I spent 3 DAYS on a post--trying to express some<br/>
very delicate matters!  I&#39;m sorry you got your feelings hurt.  I don&#39;t<br/>
remember the exact question asked of you, but to give the benefit of the<br/>

<br/>
I really understand what you said here, Dawn.  In fact, I struggled with<br/>
just such a situation myself about this time last year.  In fact, I think<br/>
nearly the exact words came out of my mouth to homeschooling friends.<br/>
Ultimately, I found a way to understand my daughter and still hold true to<br/>
my philosophy, but it took a while.  And I was very much willing to<br/>
sacrifice my *ideals* for the reality of what I was experiencing if<br/>
necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, like I said, I got it figured out....and since have come to feel<br/>
that unschooling *will* work with every child (barring certain physical or<br/>
emotional problems).  But it just may look different from our expectations.<br/>
I did have to broaden my perspective quite a bit to be able to see this new<br/>
reality.<br/>
<br/>
As I explained in an earlier post, I had be more proactive in my daughter&#39;s<br/>
life/education because she really needed me to be--she asked for my<br/>
involvement.  Indirectly at first, but ultimately in a very direct plea.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I do believe that unschooling will work with every child<br/>
(exceptions previously noted).  But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s in contradiction<br/>
with your comments about adjusting your learning environment.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s going to depend how someone defines unschooling, I think! If someone<br/>
defines unschooling as parental hands off learning, then, yes, some kids<br/>
aren&#39;t going to thrive. But if we see it as *helping* our kids explore their<br/>
worlds, then we can be their resource for what they need.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has a great thirst for learning about things, but she has no<br/>
desire to wander the library or study the TV Guide so I bring stuff to her<br/>
so she can pick and choose. Most kids will want someone accompanying them on<br/>
their journey. How much running off and exploring on their own they want to<br/>
do is going to depend on the child. It&#39;s also going to depend on the home<br/>
environment. An athletic, need to learn from movement child in a sedentary,<br/>
need to learn from books family is going to feel frustrated. But is that a<br/>
failure of unschooling or a failure of the parents for not being aware<br/>
enough that there are ways to learn that are as valid as reading?<br/>
<br/>
And though children can learn perfectly fine from video games and<br/>
television, if they don&#39;t have a choice of other things that are equally<br/>
enticing, their learning is going to be limited. But that&#39;s not the fault of<br/>
unschooling either.<br/>

This was a great response and don&#39;t let the few who pick drive you <br/>
away.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I understand perfectly what you are saying.  I happen to HAVE <br/>
one of those rare beasts - a child who needs more.  More guidance, <br/>
more help overcoming his problems, just plain more.  I love him <br/>
dearly and I recognized that our unschooling lifestyle was going <br/>
sadly awry with him.  That&#39;s why I let my mom take him a few hours <br/>
everyday when she offered.  I can&#39;t be that consistent, it is not in <br/>
my nature but it was what he needed.  Thank gaia mom lives next <br/>
door!  <br/>
<br/>
One very important thing to remember though is that what works so <br/>
well for him would be a disaster with my other two.  They NEED to be <br/>
learning and living on their own terms at their own pace.  Pushing <br/>
Wyndham makes him go forward, pushing them makes them push back.  The <br/>
glory of unschooling is that the options are there.  I don&#39;t <br/>
particularly care if you don&#39;t want to call Wyndham an unschooler.  <br/>
He mostly isn&#39;t by the definition that was prevalent here.  But the <br/>
goal with him is to help him get to the point where he can be <br/>
independent.<br/>
<br/>
I think the most important thing is to find what works for YOU and do <br/>
it.  Don&#39;t let someone make you feel insecure because YOUR way is <br/>
different from THEIR way.  <br/>

What you have written makes total sense to me. :0)   I find it hard to stick to<br/>
one teaching philosophy for the reason that each person is so different. While<br/>
total unstructured time is wonderful. I have one child who needs some &quot;seat<br/>
work&quot; as I am hearing it called lately. She looks for it each morning and is<br/>
upset if she doesn&#39;t have it and can&#39;t break into her own free time without it.<br/>
I think it is like warm up for her brain or something. *L*<br/>
<br/>
My thing, is that  I have so much problems with labels.  I honestly don&#39;t fit<br/>
into one little nice neat box. I suppose if I did it would make my life easier<br/>
but well it just doesn&#39;t work that way. I think I would be bored being in one<br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
I am starting to see homeschooling/unschooling like feeding a baby. (I know<br/>
strange but stick with me for a minute here) We either breast fed totally,<br/>
bottle-fed totally  or did a little of both.  I am sure we have all seen heated<br/>
arguments about this online and maybe even in a play group. But  the most<br/>
important thing was to get the child fed right? Be it by bottle or breast. Well<br/>
I see it the same way. All I want is my children to be happy and and that hunger<br/>
to learn fed. Be it by a small amount of structure like my 9 year old needs or<br/>
total freedom like my 10  and 7 year olds thrive well in or a tad of both like<br/>
my 13 year old.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I am making sense that I understand you. *L*  Maybe I should have<br/>
written.. I get you (((hug)).<br/>

<br/>
Shelly,<br/>
<br/>
As a breastfeeding counselor for many years I&#39;m going to add to this<br/>
analogy.  Studies are very clear that breastfeeding is best for babies.  One<br/>
can make arguments about whether it is best for Mom or not, but there&#39;s no<br/>
disagreement--by anyone--that it is best for babies.  Studies have also<br/>
shown that when a baby is totally breastfed, the benefits are greatest.<br/>
When even a little formula is added, the benefits of the breastmilk they<br/>
*are* getting is reduced *greatly*.  The formula changes the intestinal<br/>
flora in the baby and makes it harder for the breast milk to be metabolized<br/>
in the same way.  It&#39;s still better for baby, but not nearly as good as<br/>
fully breastfeeding.<br/>
<br/>
Well....I think the same is true of unschooling.  If you add a &quot;little seat<br/>
work&quot;, it doesn&#39;t just change that part of the day, but it changes the whole<br/>
environment of the learning to change the way learning is processed for the<br/>
rest of the day.  It changes the relationship between mother and child and<br/>
between child and learning.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m not going to say it must be &quot;either-or&quot; to be &quot;best&quot; for any<br/>
particular family....but it does change the relationship so that it is<br/>
*different* than if you were totally unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also not saying that what you&#39;re doing is or isn&#39;t unschooling.  I am<br/>
not in your home, I don&#39;t know you or your children or see the bigger<br/>
picture of your relationship and don&#39;t want to define what you do anyway.<br/>
I&#39;m just adding to your analogy with one of my own--using the most common<br/>
definition of &quot;seat work&quot; that I know....which may or may not resemble what<br/>
you do.  I can see that something like you&#39;re describing could very well BE<br/>
unschooling in the way that I think of it....but the way I hear most<br/>
homeschoolers using the term wouldn&#39;t look much like unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
No judgements--just my .02<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118272520">On of my husband&#39;s friends earned his h.s diploma and I never knew for years<br/>
he couldnt read untill we moved and he helped us. He was putting boxes<br/>
clearly marked &quot;Kitchen&quot; in my bedroom. When asked he confessed and i felt<br/>
so bad.  My mother in law is now married to a 60 something year old man who<br/>
is smart as a whip but can&#39;t read even a label in a grocery store. She went<br/>
on vacation and came home to find the poor guy eating dog food as he thought<br/>
it was beef stew in a can. And this guy had is own consturction company.<br/>
That one has tossed me for a loop for years. Guess he had  (and still does)<br/>
lots of people to read for him.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want this for my kids I have to say but it amazes me  the<br/>
differences in people who do have h.s diploma and those who don&#39;t and the<br/>
things they have done with  their lives.  Keeps me thinking.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry posting your views to this list left you feeling a little picked on.  I look at wording that seems a little harsh or judgmental as just being someone else&#39;s way of expressing their own opinion.  In reality, we don&#39;t know each other personally so there can be no personal attacks.  Last week Leslie said one of my comments was &quot;lame&quot;.  Not the comment actually but the act of making excuses. Did I have a problem with that.  At first I read that and thought, &quot;ok then&quot;, but then I removed myself personally from the situation and tried to listen to what she was saying, as if she were responding to someone else&#39;s post and I agreed with her.  I come to this list to be with people of like minds and feel support and there is a lot of that.  I also am here to learn and bounce my ideas off of the listers.  I enjoyed your post and hope you will not stop posting.<br/>

You know, I was hoping that nobody would see fit to take one sentence or word<br/>
out of what I wrote from my heart and pick at it.  But, ok, here&#39;s my<br/>
response.<br/>
<br/>
Surely a thinking person could allow that there might be a child or two out<br/>
there in the world who might not thrive as an unschooler, for one reason or<br/>
another.  As a parent, I would want to be watchful for that failure to<br/>
thrive, just as I would want to be watchful for signs of a physical problem<br/>
that might develop with my child regardless of the fact that I have no<br/>
expectations that one might develop.  Should I see a problem, I would adjust<br/>
our learning environment accordingly because my child&#39;s happiness and growth<br/>
is much more important to me than adherence to a teaching philosophy.  To not<br/>
allow for this potentiality would make me as rigid and fanatical at my<br/>
child&#39;s expense as so many accuse unschoolers of being.  If I did nothing, my<br/>
child might fall behind his potential and miss the joy of learning because I<br/>
insisted I must unschool at all costs.<br/>
<br/>
I did not mean that if my son falls behind some arbitrary standard that he<br/>
needs to read at age 5, add three digit numbers at age 7, etc., I&#39;d put him<br/>
on a curriculum immediately.  How sad that this is what you apparently read<br/>
into my post.  Congratulations.  I now feel as judged in a group I had hoped<br/>
from whom I might find some support as I do by those who criticize my<br/>
parenting decisions.<br/>

&gt; it.  Don&#39;t let someone make you feel insecure because YOUR way is<br/>
&gt; different from THEIR way.<br/>

grief about that too!  LOL!<br/>

&gt; What you have written makes total sense to me. :0)   I find it hard to stick to<br/>
&gt; one teaching philosophy for the reason that each person is so different. While<br/>
&gt; total unstructured time is wonderful. I have one child who needs some &quot;seat<br/>
&gt; work&quot; as I am hearing it called lately. She looks for it each morning and is<br/>
&gt; upset if she doesn&#39;t have it and can&#39;t break into her own free time without it.<br/>
&gt; I think it is like warm up for her brain or something. *L*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My thing, is that  I have so much problems with labels.  I honestly don&#39;t fit<br/>
&gt; into one little nice neat box. I suppose if I did it would make my life easier<br/>
&gt; but well it just doesn&#39;t work that way. I think I would be bored being in one<br/>
&gt; box.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am starting to see homeschooling/unschooling like feeding a baby. (I know<br/>
&gt; strange but stick with me for a minute here) We either breast fed totally,<br/>
&gt; bottle-fed totally  or did a little of both.  I am sure we have all seen heated<br/>
&gt; arguments about this online and maybe even in a play group. But  the most<br/>
&gt; important thing was to get the child fed right? Be it by bottle or breast. Well<br/>
&gt; I see it the same way. All I want is my children to be happy and and that hunger<br/>
&gt; to learn fed. Be it by a small amount of structure like my 9 year old needs or<br/>
&gt; total freedom like my 10  and 7 year olds thrive well in or a tad of both like<br/>
&gt; my 13 year old.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope I am making sense that I understand you. *L*  Maybe I should have<br/>
&gt; written.. I get you (((hug)).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725934191">+ Last week Leslie said one of<br/>
+ my comments was &quot;lame&quot;.  Not the comment actually but the act of<br/>
+ making excuses. Did I have a problem with that.  At first I read<br/>
+ that and thought, &quot;ok then&quot;, but then I removed myself personally<br/>
+ from the situation and tried to listen to what she was saying, as<br/>

+ her.<br/>

And I&#39;m *so* glad you took it in that context!!!!  :-)  I think part of the<br/>
difference might be that you and I had built up at least a *little* rapport<br/>
prior to my brassy, sassy &quot;lame&quot; comment.  I felt that you would accept it<br/>
from me without taking it too personally.  But then worried and sent the<br/>
follow up about how you don&#39;t have to agree with me.  :-)  :-)  It is almost<br/>
impossible be able to infer another&#39;s tone via email.  I&#39;m glad you gave me<br/>
the benefit of the doubt, Pat.  Thanks.<br/>

Actually Leslie, I think it has more to do with personality differences and maybe the fact that I am very receptive to others ideas at this point because I am new to homeschooling/unschooling.  I may get to the point where I feel like I am more set in *my way* of unschooling and won&#39;t want your sassy brassy comments :-)  At that point, I&#39;ll just figure you are really voicing your views for the new people on the list so they see different perspectives.  It is always import to listen to what people have to say, even if we are thrown off by the way it is being said, at least I try to.  I&#39;m not talking about unsolicited advice.  I&#39;m talking about a situation like we have here where people are expressing their views. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142194924">A little while ago I wrote a post that hasn&#39;t shown up yet.  It was <br/>
about how far the list has come and how I am trying to get past the <br/>
things that were said to me here in the past six months.  There has <br/>
been great progress made here, but obviously I am not the only one <br/>
