<div id="ygrps-yiv-173332488">&lt;&lt;Do you doubt those groups exist?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In Julie&#39;s defense, I grew up and lived most of my 40 years as a Christian<br/>
and I doubted those groups existed.  I thought the atheists were just being<br/>
paranoid.  .....<br/>
<br/>
Then we started homeschooling and actually joined a group.  At first I<br/>
thought, &quot;Oh, what an odd individual&quot;, or &quot;Surely, they didn&#39;t mean that the<br/>
way it sounded&quot;.  .....<br/>
<br/>
I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt but after 3 years I could no<br/>
longer deny it.  These people insist they have an inclusive group because<br/>
you don&#39;t HAVE to sign the statement of faith unless you are on the board.<br/>
However, I had my religious beliefs dissed as superstition very publicly.<br/>
It was in front of this lady&#39;s children so I didn&#39;t make a scene.<br/>
<br/>
I no longer doubt.<br/>
