&lt;&lt; I&#39;ll bet any homeschooling parent could explain how homeschooling provides <br/>
both of these things! We don&#39;t live under a rock!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some do.<br/>

That article was lame and evil, but that doesn&#39;t mean everything he said was <br/>
wrong.  (I seriously doubt he&#39;s aware of what quotation marks mean, as I <br/>
seriously doubt those were the exact words of Pam Sorooshian, but he probably went <br/>
to public school so there.  My kids probably don&#39;t know either, but they <br/>
didn&#39;t have to suffer twelve years to not know.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t live under a rock, but lots of homeschooling families WANT to, and <br/>
intend to, and there&#39;s even a song to justify it:<br/>
<br/>
My hope is built on nothing less<br/>
Than Jesus&#39; blood and righteousness<br/>
I dare not trust the sweetest frame<br/>
But wholly lean on Jesus&#39; name<br/>
    On Christ the Solid Rock I stand<br/>
    All other ground is sinking sand<br/>
    All other ground is sinking sand<br/>

(From memory, I think it&#39;s around #96 in the Baptist Hymnal I grew up with.)<br/>
<br/>
If we say &quot;that&#39;s not true&quot; about something that&#39;s true, it&#39;s another point <br/>
of ignorance (not as bad as misquoting, I think, but still bad &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
-=-Anyway - homeschooling can create a free thinking group of constituents. <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you haven&#39;t read much of the Christian Homeschooling literature. <br/>
 They are not trying to create a free-thinking group of constituents.  They <br/>
are trying to create an army with one Christian mind.<br/>
<br/>
If you join HSLDA or even sign up to receive their e-mail alert messages, <br/>
you&#39;ll see an ugly, dark, sky-is-falling angle on the world.  They&#39;ll tell you <br/>
what to write where to make the world safe for your children.  They&#39;ll give you <br/>
the phones and e-mail addresses and even tell you what to say.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose they were behind ABC&#39;s apology for their Super-Bowl lead-in.  If <br/>
anyone knows for sure (and especially if you got a notice saying &quot;complain to <br/>
ABC&quot;), I&#39;d really like to forward the note to my husband, who wrote this upon <br/>
learning about the problem:<br/>
------------<br/>
<br/>
Apologized  for what?<br/>
<br/>
Nudity on primetime?<br/>
<br/>
NFL is something less than a wholesome kiddy show?<br/>
<br/>
Violence and smacktalking somehow attracts a better audience than sex? (Not<br/>
to mention testerone ridden truck commercials or bigger boobs to sell Dr.<br/>
Pepper)<br/>
<br/>
I think we can be sure that the &#39;mistakes&#39; will continue.<br/>
---------------<br/>
<br/>
I told him I was guessing it was an organized campaign of &quot;The Christian <br/>
Right&quot; that got that quick an apology.<br/>
