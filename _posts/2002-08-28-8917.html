I think it has to do with personality on how you see that.  I tend to see<br/>
the world as a pretty safe place, all told.  I tend to think more of all the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-740120168">I knew someone who was in the back of a truck, the truck was on a dirt <br/>
road, going maybe 10-15 miles  an hour.  They hit a bump and he went <br/>
flying out of the truck.  He hit wrong and his entire right arm/hand was <br/>
paralyzed.  <br/>
<br/>
My parents rode in vehicles without seat belts.  As I child I wasn&#39;t in <br/>
a car seat but my parents did install seat belts and as toddlers we were <br/>
in harnesses.  Both my parents and I are just fine, so does that mean I <br/>
shouldn&#39;t keep my kids in seat belts, or in car/booster seats? Of course <br/>
not.  The risk, however slight, is decreased by my children being <br/>
buckled in safely.  <br/>
I don&#39;t believe in sitting on a couch not living life for fear that we <br/>
will be injured.  But I do believe in reducing that risk by not <br/>
practicing risky behavior, wearing seat belts, not riding unbelted, not <br/>
riding in the back of a truck, making sure the restraint system on a <br/>
rollercoaster fits correctly, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t see the desire to ride in the back of the truck being more <br/>
important than the risk of doing so.  It&#39;s all about balancing risk vs <br/>
benefits.  <br/>
<br/>
So sorry, but Iwould never allow my children to ride in the back of a <br/>
truck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010363555">Or experience.  I worked for Nader back in the &#39;70s and had an intense<br/>
experience reading letters and talking to people about all the things<br/>
that could and did go wrong when driving.  It changed my mind/attitudes<br/>
forever.  Still, I have a pretty care free attitude about life, but I<br/>
just don&#39;t take certain chances.<br/>

dogs in the back of a pickup isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all playing the odds, I suppose. A friend and I rode in the back of<br/>
a pickup all the way from Tucson to Laughlin and back once, stoned off my<br/>
ass and working on my tan. I&#39;d ridden in the back of other pickups and<br/>
haven&#39;t been injured, although I know someone who was killed that way. I<br/>
just hate to use up all my good luck on unnecessary risks.<br/>

believed seat belt laws were stupid and unnecessary. In his view it&#39;s all<br/>
