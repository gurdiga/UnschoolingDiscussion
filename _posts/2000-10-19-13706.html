<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675762599">Dear Robin,<br/>
     I would just like to say it&#39;s great that you are nursing both of your <br/>
kids at once. I am a mother of four. My youngest is 3 months. All of my <br/>
children nursed until they were 3. I weaned them about half way through my <br/>
pregnancy. My two oldest boys had no problem with this but my third child <br/>
seems she may be having a problem. The last time she nursed was when I was <br/>
in labor with my now three month old. We tried to make her involved in every <br/>
aspect of the pregnancy and birth. We had an unassisted homebirth. She loves <br/>
her baby brother so much and is never mean or even crabby with him. But she <br/>
seems very angry with me. I understand that part of that is the adjustment <br/>
to not being the baby anymore. I wonder though if she isn&#39;t upset about not <br/>
nursing. We had a stop nursing party for her where she enjoyed telling us <br/>
how big she was. When we go to bed together at night she always wants to <br/>
cuddle and fondle my breasts. I ask her if she still wants to nurse and she <br/>
says sometimes. I often regret not continuing nursing her as well. I think I <br/>
took away her feeling of security she much needed with the birth of our son. <br/>
I have thought about asking her is she would like to nurse sometimes but I <br/>
don&#39;t know how she would handle it. I feel overwhelmed sometimes just with <br/>
my new son but it upsets me to see how angry she gets.She never acted out <br/>
like this before. Any advice?<br/>
    I am new to unschooling and am still having some trouble with it. My <br/>
children have never been in school but we homeschooled in a fairly <br/>
traditional way. Can anyone offer me some of their success stories? I could <br/>
really use some encouragement.<br/>

Funny, I was just thinking of you yesterday - while nursing in fact - about<br/>
some post you had made when you were tandem nursing about the different<br/>
rates of nursing driving you nuts. I&#39;m getting the same effect here, and<br/>
rarely nursing the two of them at the same time anymore.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, you might want to try asking her if she wants to try nursing. I know<br/>
several moms who have done so - most of the kids took up the offer once or<br/>
twice but stopped when they realized they no longer knew how to get milk<br/>
out. One mom I know did have a young child go back to nursing for awhile. If<br/>
you don&#39;t feel comfortable doing that, you might try to find other ways in<br/>
which you can &quot;baby&quot; her. I know Mackenzie still likes to play sometimes<br/>
that he&#39;s the baby. He&#39;ll say &quot;I&#39;m just a little bitty baby today&quot; and we&#39;ll<br/>
pretend that he&#39;s the baby, I&#39;ll hold him in my lap and he&#39;ll crawl around<br/>
on the floor. Also he likes me to read from the journals I&#39;ve kept, I read<br/>
him things he was doing when he was a baby. Often I&#39;ll read to him about<br/>
what he was like when he was Asa&#39;s age, the funny things he did. He likes<br/>
that I remember his own babyhood and can bring it back for him. Perhaps you<br/>
can set aside some time (I know how hard that is with a baby, but maybe<br/>
during naptime), just to hold her daughter in your lap and sing to her, or<br/>
carry her in a sling, or in some other way &quot;baby her&quot;. I think most kids at<br/>
this age feel this conflicting pull between big kid and baby. Although she<br/>
might enjoy telling you how big she is, there&#39;s another part of her that is<br/>
reaching back for what is left behind. Honoring that is probably the best<br/>
way to help her move past her anger and deal with the new family situation.<br/>
Also maybe just help her reflect her feelings - e.g. &quot;It can be hard not to<br/>
have mommy all to yourself anymore&quot;, &quot;It can be frustrating when the baby<br/>
takes up so much of mommy&#39;s time&quot;, &quot;Sometimes you wish you were still my<br/>
little baby again&quot;, and see what she says.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since my kids are younger, I don&#39;t really have any stories for you. But I&#39;d<br/>
really suggest a subscription to &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot; magazine, which<br/>
is specifically for this type of learning ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.holtgws.com/">http://www.holtgws.com/</a> ). It<br/>
has a lot of great ideas, inspiration, etc. and often articles written by<br/>
the kids themselves. I&#39;d also recommend reading Grace Llewellyn&#39;s books &quot;The<br/>
Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; and &quot;Real Lives&quot;. While they are not really<br/>
aimed at parents, I got a whole lot out of them regarding unschooling. John<br/>
Holt&#39;s books &quot;Learning All the Time&quot;, &quot;How Kids Learn&quot; and &quot;How Kids Fail&quot;<br/>
were also very inspirational and had good ideas about how kids learn<br/>
different subjects.<br/>
Grace Llewllyn talks about a phenomenon when people start unschooling - that<br/>
often they need to take some time to just do nothing. It&#39;s hard on parents<br/>
because often they think that unschooling is &quot;failing&quot; because their kid is<br/>
not interested in anything, but this downtime helps them re-organize the way<br/>
they approach learning. Mostly this is in reference to kids who come out of<br/>
school, but I have heard families say they experienced the same thing when<br/>
going from traditional structured homeschooling to unschooling.<br/>

somewhere between 22-23 lbs when we weighed him last.  Technicallly I&#39;m<br/>
still tandeming and have been now for over 5 years but it is so different<br/>
this time that I don&#39;t really consider it tandeming.  I mean, Aidan nurses<br/>
a lot less at 5 than Nathan did at2-4.  Plus, he has a big brother to play<br/>
with and has shown a lot less displacement than Nathan did.  It just makes<br/>
sense that a 2.5 yo baby would have a lot more problems with a sibling<br/>
than a 5 yo would, yk?  You can see some pics at<br/>
www.kjsl.com/~dawn/boyz.htm.  They aren&#39;t the most current pics and the<br/>
boyz finally got haircuts in August!  Way short haircuts.  Nahtan and I<br/>
are going shopping for hair color.  He wants to color chunk in green, pink<br/>
and purple. Let me know if you are interested in a list for older<br/>
nurslings.  I own one and it&#39;s private since we got scammed by a freaky<br/>
troll who gets off on breastfeeding:/<br/>
