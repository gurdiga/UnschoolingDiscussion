<div id="ygrps-yiv-527204947">&lt;&lt;Do I just let him get it and watch it?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think we all have areas we struggle with in trusting our children.<br/>
<br/>
In the Godzilla scenario, I think I would point out that I am concerned the<br/>
version he picked is scary and there is another version that isn&#39;t so scary<br/>
if he would like to see what he thought.  If he insisted on the adult<br/>
version, I think I would get it for him and watch it with him, assuring him<br/>
that he can stop watching whenever he wants if he decides he doesn&#39;t like<br/>
the movie.<br/>
<br/>
Even if he gets nightmares from a scary movie, he will learn so much more<br/>
about himself by finding his own limits.  Example:  10yo decides she wants<br/>
to save her allowance to get a bird.  I said fine and she asked to go to the<br/>
pet store to check out prices.  When she saw how much the bird costs, she<br/>
changed her mind.  Much different scenario than if I said I didn&#39;t think it<br/>
was a good idea.<br/>
