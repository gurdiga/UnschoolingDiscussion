&lt;&lt; This afternoon she gave me a card.  It said &quot;ai no mirumo de<br/>
 pon&quot;.  &quot;ai&quot; written in roman alphabet and the rest in &quot;hiragana&quot;<br/>
 (in the Japanese ps, they first teach this system of writing ).<br/>
 &quot;ai&quot; means love in Japanese.  &quot;mirumo the pon&quot; is one the newest<br/>
 comic book character dd is in love with.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wow, that is really cool!<br/>
I had a friend in HS whose folks were linguists with the University. They had <br/>
recordings of him while they were living in Africa (Collin was about 3 at the <br/>
time) speaking a pidgeon language he and the little African boys had <br/>
contrived out of English and whatever language was spoken in that village.<br/>
It was amazing.....kids are amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Also Noemi,<br/>
I have a question for you. I realize you are in Japan, not China but maybe <br/>
you can point me in the right direction. <br/>
I have a ds that is obsessed with China. Chinese dragons, the language, <br/>
everything.<br/>
He copies Japanese characters from his pokemon card but says that he really <br/>
wants to learn Chinese characters. As a person that has not a CLUE about <br/>
Asian languages, I don&#39;t even know where to start.<br/>
I thought about buying the Chinese power glide for him to play around with <br/>
when he wants, but that&#39;s a lot of money and he may just have a passing <br/>
interest.<br/>
I want to feed this interest, what do you think about resources?<br/>

<br/>
Art stores, libraries, bookstores, should have books on Chinese brush <br/>
calligraphy, and there will be characters, although maybe too fancy to follow <br/>
in some cases.<br/>
<br/>
We had a library book out for a while that showed the &#39;etymology&#39; of some <br/>
Chinese characters--what the literal meaning was, and what the character has <br/>
evolved to be.  It only had thirty characters or so--a kids&#39; version.  <br/>
<br/>
Internet??<br/>

When Dylan was very interested in Japanese culture I wrote to the<br/>
Japanese Consulate in Seattle, ( the nearest one ) and asked for &quot;stuff&quot;.<br/>
  They sent magazines in Japanese and English, posters, a flag,<br/>
newspapers, fliers, brochures, a computer game about Japan.   Best of all<br/>
was access to their lending library.  It&#39;s free, all you pay is postage,<br/>
and they have books, videos, cassettes, etc.<br/>
It&#39;s been a wonderful resource for us and all of it free.   Maybe if you<br/>
contact the Chinese Consulate, they&#39;d do the same for you.  <br/>
<br/>
You can also find printable pages on the Internet of Chinese characters,<br/>
for writing practice.<br/>
 <br/>
If you want to try Power Glide ( we have Japanese )  look for it on Ebay,<br/>
they are sometimes a better price there, or check some of the homeschool<br/>
swap boards.   We really like the Japanese Power Glide and Dylan listens<br/>
to it a few times a week. <br/>
<br/>
A university in your area might have a Chinese student club.  We found<br/>
one in a town near us and one of the Japanese students was even nice<br/>
enough to come to Dylan&#39;s Karate class and talk to all the kids.   The<br/>
university in Missoula, about eighty four miles away has a cultural food<br/>
festival every year and it&#39;s a great place to talk to the students from<br/>
other countries.  <br/>
<br/>
There are also Chinese restaurants, and grocery stores.  Is he old enough<br/>
to work a few hours a week?  That&#39;d be a fun way to gain exposure to a<br/>
new language.  <br/>

But, woops, my dictionary says they are called ideograms.  But *using<br/>
them* would be ideography.<br/>
<br/>
The keyboard characters that are sometimes used for cursing, !@#$%^&*,<br/>
are also considered ideograms.  (Don&#39;t ask me why!)<br/>
