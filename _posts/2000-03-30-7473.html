<div><font size="2">Hi All!&nbsp; I was just enjoying my time alone..reading all 
your posts..and thinking how nice it is to hear everyone&#39;s take on all these 
great topics.&nbsp; I often find myself going through these posts with great 
enthusiasm...so I guess I just wanted to send a big Thanks to all of you.&nbsp; 
Zain&#39;s(4 1/2 yr old )&nbsp; new enthusuasm is Alien&#39;s, and pretending is a big 
part of our schooling here..he decided we were taking off in this spaceship to 
the moon..where I lived and was the Alien...so we buckled up, sat back , and 
shook the bed for our take off and landing..then we proceded to step out of our 
spaceship, and explore the moon, and the moon home of an alien,me.&nbsp; Well 
this was quite an adventure...he learned all about the weird language that this 
alien has such as bveepmekhjdifhiseuyf.....it was wonderful to see how helpful 
my son was...explaining to me the names of various household items, and how they 
are used.&nbsp; He was an excellent teacher, actually, and described things very 
well.&nbsp; I was happy to see how polite he was when visiting the moon, and how 
kind he was to the alien...he was very respectful of my(the alien&#39;s) names for 
things, agknowledging , and repeating back in my own weird alien language.&nbsp; 
He asked questions, and we shared moon/earth experiences....It was alot of 
fun!&nbsp; I was thinking it would be fun to help him build a little spaceship 
out back to extend this creative strand......and we just Must create some sort 
of Moon goo..any suggestions?......Someone mentioned..being asked to homeschool 
someone else&#39;s kids..well there was alisting in the paper requesting trade for 
kidsitting...I responded to the add..hoping to&nbsp; extend our interaction 
horizons..it turns out this Mother has a 2 year old daughter, and a 4 year old 
son....her husband has been watching them, and wants to go back to work...she 
works during the days, and can&#39;t afford the high prices of care..I mentioned to 
her that I homeschooled , and she was very enthusiastic about that....I will be 
meeting with her next tuesday evening..to just aquaint ourselves with each 
other, and let the kids play...that would mean that I would be including her 
children&nbsp; from 8am-5pm&nbsp; T,W,Th...in our homeschooling activities..so 
in a sense i would be homeschooling someone else&#39;s kids...I am casual about our 
schooling, and not too pressed or anxious so I don&#39;t see any problem in 
this...if anything more children often means more ideas to keep them occupied 
flowing, so I see this as an advantage.&nbsp; This would probably not be long 
term..but I&#39;m interestred in the idea..so if anyone has any suggestions or 
comments..I welcome them....It seems in the past when I have cared for other 
people&#39;s kids , things seem to run a little smoother, as I am able to focus 
myself with just the kids , and activities for them,...this may even be helpful 
in our own home/unschooling..for my son. who can share the activities with 
someone else.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will see how it goes.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font size="2">&nbsp; And someone did ask about the ideas I had planned for 
our learning environment, as we had picked up a few helpful ideas from visiting 
another homeschooling home.&nbsp; One thing I noticed was the maps on the 
walls..so we have taken our Big Map book and proppped it up on his easle so he 
can see it during the day..and he has initiated more geographical questions 
since...my house isn&#39;t quite as big as hers..but I noticed a big table in the 
middle of their learning area....so I am setting the table back up in the dining 
room to accomodate more learning space(we have a very small dining room,and eat 
in the living room usually)&nbsp; I would like to get some more book shelves, 
and on the way to her house for the first time I saw a teaching supply store(I 
have been that way many times and never saw it before)&nbsp; I am going to go IN 
next week and see what they have...We are going to keep it simple....a bucket of 
beans for counting....the drum off the wall, and accessible...stuff like 
that.&nbsp; If you have any suggestions of cost effective if not free resources 
of fun filled learning tools..share them...we do enjoy our kitchen 
activities...Zain tends to be science oriented.This post is getting way too 
long. Michelle (Alien Mom)</font></div></html></div>
