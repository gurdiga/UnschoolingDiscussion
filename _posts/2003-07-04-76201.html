<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291094699">Hi Glena,<br/>
<br/>
It is not the being alone with my mom that I find offensive at all.<br/>
It is the attitude she has that having the kids or my husband around<br/>
somehow makes the experience less enjoyable for her, and her<br/>
assumption that I must feel the same way. That I must always be<br/>
longing for a break from those kids. There&#39;s also an implication<br/>
there that I am not paying enough attention to HER.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if your son and his girlfriend are coming by every night for<br/>
dinner, it sounds like you have a great relationship and you<br/>
shouldn&#39;t worry! The GF must feel very welcome! Given that, I&#39;m sure<br/>
your son is happy to spend time with you alone. In my case, I feel<br/>
like my DH and kids are NOT welcome. You probably have a friendship<br/>
with the GF, too. Unfortunately, my DH&#39;s parents are dead. But in<br/>
past relationships, I &#39;ve had great friendships with boyfriends&#39;<br/>
mothers. It really meant a lot to me.<br/>
<br/>
You said your MIL doesn&#39;t like your children. Sometimes I get the<br/>
feeling my mom doesn&#39;t like MY children!<br/>

&gt;&gt;She&#39;s the same way with my brother and sister... always acting all <br/>
&gt;&gt;flattered when we visit without the kids. She&#39;s also reluctant to be in my <br/>
&gt;&gt;house with the kids and DH, who works at home, around all the time.� She <br/>
&gt;&gt;wants me to herself. I feel a little offended<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Your post made me think... a lot... I don&#39;t have any grandchildren, yet.� I<br/>
&gt;do have a son who&#39;s been with the same girl for seven years in a committed<br/>
&gt;relationship, just not married.� They come almost every night for supper or<br/>
&gt;dessert.� They almost always go on every family trip or outing with us.� <br/>
&gt;BUT<br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;being said, I LOVE time alone with my son.� I am VERY flattered when he <br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt;call and invite me to lunch, just him and myself.� I love it when he will <br/>
&gt;ask me<br/>
&gt;if I want to go shopping with just him.� I don&#39;t try to orchestrate being<br/>
&gt;alone with him without Carrisa but it is a TREAT for me.� As much as we <br/>
&gt;love our<br/>
&gt;children now, we love them and cherish them equally when they are grown, I <br/>
&gt;do<br/>
&gt;anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know my MIL always tells me they are meant to grow up and out and on <br/>
&gt;their<br/>
&gt;own and see their parents on Sundays for an hour.� If my child chooses to <br/>
&gt;do<br/>
&gt;this, well that&#39;s fine but so far that doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s likely to <br/>
&gt;happen.<br/>
&gt;Her son, my DH sees her maybe once or twice a year, whenever I think I can<br/>
&gt;stand it (she doesn&#39;t like our children, I don&#39;t like people who don&#39;t like <br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt;children).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I will be very cautious about time alone with my children after reading <br/>
&gt;your<br/>
&gt;post.� It never occurred to me that a child would find it offensive to <br/>
&gt;spend<br/>
&gt;alone time with their parent.� I can see that if she never wants to welcome<br/>
&gt;your children or spouse into the mix it could be a serious problem, much <br/>
&gt;like<br/>
&gt;with my MIL.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you for making me think about something I&#39;ve never considered in my<br/>
&gt;family dynamics.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
