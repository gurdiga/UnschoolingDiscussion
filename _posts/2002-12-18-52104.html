the child, and school year. a column down the left witht he subject heading <br/>

Sign the bottom.<br/>
But FIRST, I would check the laws in your state, (which state?) making sure <br/>
that,<br/>
1, they can come to your house<br/>
2. What paperwork is required  by them.<br/>
3. Memorize this law, know it. Don&#39;t let them tell you the law, look in many <br/>
places. <br/>
