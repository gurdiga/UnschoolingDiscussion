<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667979901">Hi all.  Just wanted to pass along soem info regarding a radio station which<br/>
is playing an advert with some very anti-breastfeeding messages in it.  It<br/>
seems thst the ad has been compiled of a few callers talking about how<br/>
disgusting seeing mothers breastfeed their babies is.  Here is their website<br/>
addy:  www.nj1015.com   It would be helpful if we could know how many people<br/>
support this action, please email me off- or on-list.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening<br/>
Tracy</div>
