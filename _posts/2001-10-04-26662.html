by......somebody??.....I think it&#39;s Gregg Somebody,  though we took it back<br/>
to library so I can&#39;t look it up....??!?!<br/>
Anyhow,  we had lots of fun with it....it&#39;s problem solving with<br/>
numbers/counting....ways to count quantities quickly.  We ended up<br/>
discussing how we got our responses (the process of problem solving) and<br/>
Katy was thrilled to find how many ways one can find the way through a<br/>
&quot;math&quot; problem.<br/>
<br/>
Also,  since last week was &quot;Banned Book Week&quot; at our library...she picked<br/>
several from the &quot;banned selections,  including &quot;Blubber&quot; by Judy Blume.  In<br/>

From where were the banned books featured at your library banned?<br/>
What state are you in?  This sounds like a pretty progressive event; <br/>
I&#39;m going to see if our library might give it a go...<br/>
Thanks~<br/>
