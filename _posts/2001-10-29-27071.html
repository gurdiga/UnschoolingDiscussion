 </span></blockquote>Yes a thousand times! Thank you Lynda for this email and to all the others <br/>
who have voiced their suspicions or opinions that are contrary to the <br/>
&quot;popular&quot; belief. I was feeling like a very small minority before I started <br/>
to get back to reading my email groups and it would seem that a lot of people <br/>
are coming around to this exact train of thought. Those who don&#39;t learn from <br/>
history are destined to repeat it. I wish everyone would get their head out <br/>
of the mainstream media reports and into the history books....I know I could <br/>
use some history lessons myself. The beauty of homeschooling~I can make sure <br/>
my children learn it the correct way (lets not forget that history is written <br/>
by the winners) while learning it with them!!<br/>
IMHO only...our president is a very scary man (the word sociopath comes to <br/>
mind). Sure hope everyone in this country gets the heads up before its to <br/>
late.<br/>
Anyone have an recomendations for some good living books on WW2 that contains <br/>
information on hitlers politics? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517166568">ALL of the Holocaust survivor autobiographies are<br/>
excellent.   Ask living relatives or anybody old<br/>
enough. Take answers from the second source with a<br/>
grain of salt.<br/>
