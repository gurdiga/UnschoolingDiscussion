what you love isn&#39;t very hard and as long as you are good at what you do, <br/>
people will overlook the lack of a degree in the field, at least in the <br/>
computer field.  Dh does have a degree in electronics and he does use that <br/>
background, but most of it he learned himself.  We have a huge bookshelf <br/>
devoted to 5 inch thick computer books.  It doesn&#39;t interest me in the least.  <br/>
I am glad to be married to a computer geek though so he can keep me up and <br/>
running.  Sometimes though I would like to be married to a carpenter who builds <br/>
lovely furniture or a chiropractor or massage therapist.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887939117">My husband is also a self taught &quot;computer guy&quot;, he has built the three we <br/>
have and one for my mom and sister. He is a carpenter by trade. We run our <br/>
own home repair type business. He becomes a sponge when things interest him.<br/>
