<div id="ygrps-yiv-817615630">Hi all....<br/>
My oldest son&#39;s 8th B day party is coming up SOON.  (Next Thursday to be<br/>
exact) (Thursday works since most of his &quot;school&quot; friends go to the waldorf<br/>
school and they take thursday afternoons off.)<br/>
<br/>
In the past, my wife has taken on most of the actual planning and organizing<br/>
that goes into having a fun party.  I have gotten as far as making sure<br/>
everyone is invited and deciding there will be a treasure hunt...  BUT, I am<br/>
still looking for cool ideas that are party proven to work for 8-9 year old<br/>
boys....<br/>
Also, I am trying to think of an alternative to the standad &quot;goody bags&quot;<br/>
that have become standard fare around here.  Something like a little craft<br/>
project they can take home, or a simple game etc.<br/>
<br/>
Any input or hot www links would be appreciated<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
Joshua</div>
