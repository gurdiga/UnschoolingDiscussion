&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I thought you would like to read this article.  If there is any <br/>
&gt; reason why I homeschool, this may be it.<br/>

&gt; Silence required at elementary school<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; COLUMBIA, S.C. -- At Meadowfield Elementary School, silence isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; only golden, it&#39;s the rule. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A committee of teachers and parents came up with guideline for <br/>
&gt; silent hallways and lunchrooms, they say, to stem bad behavior and <br/>
&gt; curb inappropriate conversations by students. The rule began when <br/>
&gt; students returned from winter break last week. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The school&#39;s 600-or-so students who used to gab with friends now <br/>
&gt; read books while waiting for classes to start and listen to <br/>
&gt; classical music in hallways and the cafeteria. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lisa Curtis, the Meadowfield teacher who chaired the committee, said <br/>
&gt; students have shown less control of themselves the last few years. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Even parents were saying that it seems a little more chaotic in the <br/>
&gt; halls. You could tell the climate was changing and we needed to <br/>
&gt; change with it,&quot; she said. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some parents, though, say the zip-the-lips policy goes too far. <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a meeting to discuss the policy Monday. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;This is going overboard,&quot; said Billy Smith, a father of two <br/>
&gt; Meadowfield students. &quot;I grew up talking to my friends during lunch <br/>
&gt; and using those socialization skills. Kids need that.&quot; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;What about the ones that do their work and behave appropriately in <br/>
&gt; school?&quot; asked Lee Crabtree, mother of a Meadowfield fourth-<br/>
&gt; grader. &quot;They&#39;re being punished, too.&quot; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Officials say that if students do a good job keeping quiet, they&#39;ll <br/>
&gt; be allowed to whisper. And students will be taught what are <br/>
&gt; appropriate conversations for school. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Not everyone knows what it means to whisper,&quot; said Paula Stephens, <br/>
&gt; the school&#39;s principal. &quot;But everyone knows what silence is. We&#39;re <br/>
&gt; starting with that as our baseline.&quot; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Stephens says Meadowfield&#39;s lunch is only 20 minutes. She says most <br/>
&gt; schools don&#39;t allow talking in hallways. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Plans call for the Meadowfield to put up a traffic light in the <br/>
&gt; cafeteria. Green means students can talk. Yellow means things are <br/>
&gt; getting too loud. Red means silence. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Curtis said many teachers are happy with the change. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;It&#39;s amazing how well it&#39;s working,&quot; she said. &quot;The learning <br/>
&gt; environment is better. The students are being more polite. There&#39;s <br/>
&gt; no bickering. I&#39;m so proud of them.&quot; <br/>

Well, on the bright side then next time someone asks &quot;What about<br/>
socialization?&quot;  you can say &quot;Shhhh.  We can&#39;t talk about that.&quot;   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127722077">Priceless! And I am supposed to send mine to school so they can <br/>
socialize ;)<br/>
<br/>
I feel bad for all those poor children, they need some sort of outlet <br/>
throughout the day. I wonder that schools do not take lessons from <br/>
homeschoolers. Or maybe something like this, if they must be in <br/>
school:<br/>
<br/>
Morning: Class starts at 10:00 am.<br/>
Ancient History, tied in with math and science, at the very least. <br/>
Art as well, because hands on learning is the best. Also aple <br/>
opportunity for kids to act out what they are learning and play their <br/>
choice of three games based on the subject at hand. Of, course the <br/>
child may prefer to write a book about what they know for their <br/>
younger brothers birthday present, or even video tape a skit, or <br/>
record a song. Of course, there will be 1 teacher in each classroom <br/>
for every five children in attendence.<br/>
<br/>
12:00 pm: lunch, outside (during good weather) followed by a walk <br/>
through town so kids can talk and enjoy themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Afternoon: Class starts at 2:00pm.<br/>
Expiramentation, tied in with math and Language arts, at the very <br/>
least. Work may be done in groups or alone, depending on the needs of <br/>
the child. We will be outside whenever we possibly ca, for atleast <br/>
half of the class. They will each be provided with a notebook, <br/>
pencils and crayons for a nature journal. They can write info, draw, <br/>
write poetry or a story, whatever moves them at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Classes end at four, we encourage older siblings to pick children up <br/>
after school, or the parents if possible. There will be no bus <br/>
service, as we cannot guarentee a child&#39;s safety (talking bullies <br/>
here)<br/>
<br/>
We encourage children to bring their siblings and parents to class <br/>
with them whenever possible. Every day is fine.</div>

right off classical music while we&#39;re at it, by forcing them to listen when <br/>
they used to be allowed to talk with their friends. . . sigh.<br/>
