&gt; figuring ten percent.  He has always been really great with math and<br/>
&gt; loved the subject.  Math and Science, art photography and drame are<br/>
&gt; his favorite subjects.  He just seems to have lost ground.  <br/>

(I&#39;m pretty certain that&#39;s it - considering my college students&#39; retention of <br/>
anything they ever learned in school. VERY VERY little. I wish you all could <br/>
experience what I do, teaching high school graduates. You&#39;d worry a LOT less <br/>
about whether your kids were learning enough, believe me.)<br/>

Some of what is said here may challenge you, shock you, disturb you, or seem <br/>
harsh. But remember that people are offering it to be helpful and what feels <br/>
uncomfortable to you might be just what someone else needed to hear.<br/>
