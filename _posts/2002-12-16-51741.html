<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Maybe I am not journaling right. But that sounds like it shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt;&gt; possible kinda like asking a stupid question.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I liked Joyce&#39;s response on this, but my husband (who&#39;s been reading over my<br/>
shoulder today) tells me that I should let everyone know that there really<br/>
ARE stupid questions.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re the ones somebody just has to ask after the class or meeting has<br/>
gone on way, way, way too long, and the person in charge has finally (to<br/>
everyone&#39;s relief) said, &quot;Well, if there are no more questions, I guess we<br/>
can go.&quot;  Everything asked after that point is stupid.<br/>
<br/>
Do you get the impression that my husband spends too much time in meetings<br/>
and army classes and is getting just a teensy bit cynical?  &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
