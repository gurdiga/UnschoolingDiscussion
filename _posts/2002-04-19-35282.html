<div id="ygrps-yiv-244542848">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to thank everyone for their advice and encouragement.  I <br/>
really had nothing to worry about after all....<br/>
<br/>
I contacted his former teacher, whose &#39;tune&#39; had changed quite a bit, <br/>
since I was very direct, and asked for some specifics.  All she could <br/>
really say is &#39;you won&#39;t have any trouble teaching him, he&#39;s very <br/>
smart&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
It relieved me, yet made me angry at the same time, that she had made <br/>
it sound so ominous in the beginning.  Then she tops it off <br/>
with &#39;he&#39;s very smart&#39;....meaning of course (IMO) that he could learn <br/>
what he needed to know even if an ape was teaching him.  I have no <br/>
doubt that he will learn what HE needs or WANTS to know, but I don&#39;t <br/>
like it being insinuated that since I don&#39;t have &#39;credentials&#39;, I&#39;m <br/>
about as significant as a doorstop in his learning process.<br/>
<br/>
I hate it when people with an agenda attempt to manipulate others <br/>
with fear.<br/>
<br/>
I asked her for his weaknesses and strengths, and some other specific <br/>
questions.  Turns out, he IS very smart!  High scores on everything.<br/>
<br/>
So far, it looks like this is going to be a wonderful adventure for <br/>
all of us.  He is actually EAGER to do almost everything I&#39;ve <br/>
suggested to him, and I communicated to him that it was his decision <br/>
whether or not he did the things I suggested. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all your advice and encouragement!:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403894024">Ruby it sounds like you have gotten much of what I have gotten.  I have been<br/>
doing this for a few years now and feeling like a failure (even though I<br/>
know she is doing better than in ps) but only now am I starting to realize I<br/>
am doing fine.<br/>
<br/>
In ps I bet a child doesn&#39;t get a whole 7 minutes personal one on one from<br/>
the teacher a day.  I think we could spend an hour a day and be doing far<br/>
better than the schools.  So, since we are more than willing to spend more<br/>
than that.....how can we go wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and do not get discouraged.  He is just another kid to them and<br/>
whether or not he learns is not something they go home and think about after<br/>
work.  Bet it is on your mind all the time.  You will do great.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023355202">Thank you, Sharon<br/>
<br/>
With the first grandchild, I just didn&#39;t worry so much about things <br/>
because I never had any dealings with the ps around here, and we just <br/>
started learning things together, then just continued.  No problemo.<br/>
<br/>
I have friends who are teachers, and I NEVER talk to them about our <br/>
experiences, because I get the same ol&#39; crap all the time.  You know, <br/>
the &#39;S&#39; word, and all the things we&#39;re all so familiar with hearing <br/>
from those who don&#39;t understand and don&#39;t want to understand.  And I <br/>
avoid all questions from them.  I&#39;m getting really good at <br/>
it...avoiding questions, that is...LOL.<br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;re right, we&#39;re doing just fine. We&#39;re having fun, that&#39;s for <br/>
sure.  How can anyone learn without having fun???!!!<br/>
<br/>
How many grandchildren are you unschooling?  I was beginning to think <br/>
I was &#39;one of a kind&#39;....LOL.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I found this list!  I haven&#39;t had time to read much, but <br/>
from what I&#39;ve read, I know I can learn a lot here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501724388">Hi Ruby.  I am unschooling two grandchildren.  Ages 2 and 10.<br/>
<br/>
For a long time I thought I was one of a kind also, then a very nice lady on<br/>
this list put me in touch with another one in Northern California.<br/>
<br/>
It is not easy and I know you will understand.  WE don&#39;t have the strength<br/>
or the energy we used to, plus having another generation behind you adds<br/>
lots of responsibilities the young mothers don&#39;t yet have either.  All of<br/>
that left me questioning if I could do this justice,,,I am involved in so<br/>
many things and spread out so much.  Not that I don&#39;t consider it most<br/>
important, but grandmas still have to be &quot;on call&quot; for the rest of the<br/>
family and fulfill their responsibilities to them too.<br/>
<br/>
This group has helped me to learn that I don&#39;t need as much time as I<br/>
thought I did to accomplish unschooling.  For instance I don&#39;t make &quot;lesson<br/>
plans&quot; anymore!<br/>
<br/>
You are very welcome and thank you also for your post.<br/>
<br/>
Sharon<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582327325">I think that with all that is happen in our public schools today, it <br/>
is time we reclaim the &quot;S&quot; word for ourselves.  When someone questions <br/>
you about socialization, don&#39;t be defensive about it.  In fact mount <br/>
an offense, ask what kind of socialization skills are learned in the <br/>
schools.  Ask how public school kids learn to relate to people who are <br/>
not the same age as themselves.  Ask why it is that in the study <br/>
quoted in Time magazine last summer, the homeschooled kids were more <br/>
likely to actually talk to the others and make new friends while <br/>
the public schooled kids didn&#39;t.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s a really good point!<br/>
<br/>
And it applies to other aspects of unschooling too. It&#39;s so easy to get<br/>
defensive about homeschooling and unschooling as though we need to prove how<br/>
it&#39;s just as good as public schooling. But it&#39;s better!<br/>
<br/>
How will PS kids find the time to explore their interests and discover<br/>
what&#39;s important to them?<br/>
<br/>
How can they learn how the world works when they are shut away from it in an<br/>
environment that resembles prison or boot camp more than real life?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have any questions parents choosing PS should ask themselves?<br/>
