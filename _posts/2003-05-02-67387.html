<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217958376">Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Moms doing what they want<br/>
First of all, that is a stupid heading.  I don&#39;t know who wrote it, but it <br/>
didn&#39;t help anything.<br/>
Nobody was saying &quot;Moms should do what they want.&quot;<br/>

We weren&#39;t talking about two styles of parenting.  That&#39;s the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Under the assumption that unschooling parents are already paying LOTS of <br/>
attention to their children and being with them probably  more than any other <br/>
set of parents whose children are generally heathy and mobile, THEN we were <br/>
discussing mothers having their own interests.<br/>
<br/>
Mothers having their own interests was misinterpreted as &quot;doing what they <br/>
want&quot; and leaving their children for long stretches.<br/>
<br/>
Get over that.  It was false, and it is NOT a dichotomy.  There are not &quot;two <br/>
ways.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
However, I do think that there are still a few who seem to be saying <br/>

taking care of my family&#39;s physical/emotional/intellectual needs that <br/>
there isn&#39;t a whole lot of time leftover for me.  If I made more time <br/>
for me, I wouldn&#39;t be meeting all of their needs.  I don&#39;t hover and <br/>
offer more of me than they want.  They really do need me.  I also <br/>
consider reading and responding to this list a big part of my &quot;me&quot; <br/>
time. For example, I got up this morning, ran to the store to pick up <br/>
stuff to make food for today, did my 9 year old&#39;s hair so that it <br/>
looks &quot;just like Lizzie Mcguire&quot;, made barbecue (sloppy joes) for my <br/>
family and put it in the crock pot, got my boys some breakfast to <br/>
eat, and now I&#39;m about to go get dressed to take my daughter and her <br/>
friends to the Lizze Mcguire movie and some walk around the mall, <br/>
spray bath and body works stuff  time.  When I get home, we&#39;re going <br/>
to mcdonalds as a family and by then the boys will really need some <br/>
mommy time.  I expect to give them a few hours of play time and then <br/>
it will be time for bed!  Me time?  When?  My &quot;me&quot; time is right now <br/>
and is over in about 5 minutes!  I think that&#39;s ok.  I have two very <br/>
young kids and I also have a daughter  in the pre-teen age range.  <br/>
That combination is time consuming.  So I get that we should have <br/>
interests and find different things interesting, but I also think <br/>
that some don&#39;t get that some moms really don&#39;t have much time to <br/>
pursue those interests if they&#39;re also going to unschool.  <br/>

People are talking about INTERESTS, not actions.<br/>

<br/>
and is over in about 5 minutes!  I think that&#39;s ok.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mothers of toddlers can go a week without a shower sometimes, if there&#39;s not <br/>
another adult to spot them.  Been there.  But do you have any interests you <br/>
can discuss with your older child?  Have you ever learned anything outside of <br/>
school?  Are there historical periods or any places in the world you know or <br/>
care more about than others?  That you care about so much that you read about <br/>
them or can tell stories, or would change the channel to see something about? <br/>
 Greece?  Hawaii?  The Easter Islands?  Do you know enough about opera, maybe <br/>
to tell your kids a story?  Or skiing?  Or fire-breathing?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So I get that we should have <br/>
<br/>
interests and find different things interesting, but I also think <br/>
<br/>
that some don&#39;t get that some moms really don&#39;t have much time to <br/>
<br/>
pursue those interests if they&#39;re also going to unschool.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re going to unschool and they are NOT going to pursue any interests, <br/>
unschooling is going to be like no learning whatsoever pretty soon.<br/>
<br/>
The mom has to be involved and curious about things besides butt-wiping and <br/>
sandwich making, unless the kids are only going to be butt-wipers and <br/>
sandwich makers.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there are really people on this list without interests, so the <br/>
only way this conversation can continue is if someone wants to defend having <br/>
no interests, and no curiousity, and that&#39;s going to be the point at which I <br/>
would personally say &quot;Then put your kids in school, because some of the <br/>
teachers and other kids DO have interests and passions and hobbies and <br/>
collections and stories to tell.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Oh I don&#39;t thing you should apologize at all for a heading. It&#39;s not stupid.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So I get that we should have<br/>
interests and find different things interesting, but I also think<br/>
that some don&#39;t get that some moms really don&#39;t have much time to<br/>
pursue those interests if they&#39;re also going to unschool.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I get this, I really do. I have periods like this. Sometimes long periods of<br/>
it. From what you have said, it doesn&#39;t sound like you are hovering and<br/>
smothering. Just taking care of business. And your business is your family<br/>
now. I think the important thing is if you do it because your are in a<br/>
situation and feel like it&#39;s what you &quot;have&quot; to do, OR you really enjoy what<br/>
you are doing and see how much of a difference you are making for you<br/>
children in them growing up.<br/>
<br/>
For me, I do it because I really enjoy it. I love what I do. Every day I<br/>
love it. Sometimes it&#39;s trying, but I wouldn&#39;t want to be doing anything<br/>
else right now. I also know it sometimes gets easier for me to have &quot;me&quot;<br/>
time and sometimes harder. As the children get older, I do believe it gets<br/>
easier. I&#39;m sure you will see that too. I have general ideas of what I think<br/>
I would like to be doing in 5, 10 and even 20 years from now. As much as<br/>
they also involve my children, it also involves me doing some things I would<br/>
like to and also doing things with just Joe and I. I&#39;m in no hurry though. I<br/>
know before I know it, those times will be here. I just enjoy now!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, anytime I fill out any kind of application, for occupation I<br/>
always put Mom. Some may have a problem with that but right now, to me, it<br/>
says so much about my life. And yes I am more than just a mom, but it<br/>
happens to be something I take very seriously. I also get a lot of comments<br/>
on that when people read it over. I&#39;ve always had good responses.<br/>

And when you think about it, even so much more than that. I read a piece<br/>
somewhere about a stay at home mom, not sure if she homeschooled or not, but<br/>
it was about her getting upset when people mentioned that she didn&#39;t have a<br/>
job, she was JUST a mom or housewife. She finally made up an answer when<br/>
asked what her occupation was. It was research assistant in the field of<br/>
child development and human relations. She would then go on if someone asked<br/>
what that entailed giving details about what she did do, referring of course<br/>
to her children all the time without them knowing. It was a cute piece.<br/>
Unfortunately I never can remember that when the opportunity comes up!<br/>

  I hear you sheila. I really believe that it is possible to hold onto ourselves and  give to our kids in the way we do. <br/>
<br/>
  I think it is about that we choose.I recognise it is a balancing act but when I had kids that was what I wanted <br/>
<br/>
  and personally I get a lot of me time just by being involved with them. When my time comes with less demands <br/>
<br/>
  and needs of others I know that like everything else I will be able to fill it with something satisfying as well.But <br/>
<br/>
  right now my kids need me the majority of  the time in some way.I love it too.<br/>
