Well, that&#39;s not nearly enough information to go on. My first thought was <br/>
some type of Grosbeak, but I&#39;d need a lot more descriptive info. as what you <br/>
put could fit probably a hundred or so birds.<br/>
Where do you live?<br/>
Did you see it recently?<br/>
Birding can be a lot of fun, but frustrating too! I recommend that you buy a <br/>
Petersons guide and/or the audobon field guides for birds in your area.<br/>

&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>
What&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>
