<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789766489">Yes, how do we get this message to the wider world?  I know I do my bit on a<br/>
small scale, but are there better things we could/should be doing?  Or is it<br/>
basically something which we just figure out for ourselves and if others<br/>
around us become curious, then we share?<br/>

&gt; Well, Joel, I do believe it&#39;s time we start talking about how to send this<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; Yes, the emphasis is on early reading at the expense of many other<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I feel this is OK because he&#39;s only 8 but when I look at some of the<br/>
&gt; 2nd -3rd<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; grade workbooks I have I realize that there is much in them that he is<br/>

&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will really pay off. He is pretty good so far in basic math. He can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; add,subtract,carry, we haven&#39;t borrowed yet. He loves to mess with<br/>
&gt; stuff,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; especially water. I am amazed to watch him since he&#39;s been home<br/>

&gt; worry.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry to ramble.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Yes, how do we get this message to the wider world?  I know I do my bit on <br/>
a<br/>
 small scale, but are there better things we could/should be doing?  Or is it<br/>
 basically something which we just figure out for ourselves and if others<br/>
 around us become curious, then we share? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it isn&#39;t something people have to discover. Of course we can all <br/>
be great examples out there for folks to see. I remember when I was first <br/>
considering hsing many years ago. (though I;m just starting, again) I became <br/>
friends with a woman who I had known for years but since we had such <br/>
different lifestyles we never became close (we ps they hsd) She was the one I <br/>
called when I decided to hs. I now know she is a unschooler but when she <br/>
tried to explain it to me I really could not understand. I have had to live <br/>
it a bit and watch my kids to learn how they learn. I am constantly amazed <br/>
and I have to fight my own indoctrination daily.JMHO<br/>
