<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883117357"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&quot; Ren, if you get this far reading, do you remember that verse about <br/>
 </span></blockquote>works we <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; were talking about last week? It seemed pretty clearly to say <br/>
 </span></blockquote>works were <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; required. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know the Baptists love to quote by grace are ye saved, not by <br/>
 </span></blockquote>works. The <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; church Ren grew up in had a different favorite verse. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That was Sandra....NOW I&#39;m up to speed. I missed this because of <br/>
problems with Yahoo bouncing my emails, PLUS trying to get unpacked <br/>
after the long drive home from the conference.<br/>
So now I understand the question Mike was asking.<br/>
But, I had a very lengthy private discussion with Sandra about <br/>
religion, which included a LOT about the church I grew up in, and so <br/>
remembering a specific verse would be very taxing on this girls <br/>
memory.<br/>
Just to clarify, the church I grew up in believed in the &quot;saved by <br/>
grace&quot; part, but it seemed that the members were always talking about <br/>
those that &quot;lost out&quot; (if you quit going to meetings, started wearing <br/>
makeup and cutting your hair, blah, blah, blah) so the insinuation <br/>
was that if you didn&#39;t do certain things, you were definitely going <br/>
to screw up your salvation.<br/>
There was this perpetual fear of messing things up.<br/>
<br/>
Verses in the Bible about works?<br/>
There are so many.<br/>
And so many that clearly state that you can not have faith without <br/>
works.<br/>
There are many, many more verses that talk about the fact that a <br/>
person is not saved by works, but by grace, forgiveness....<br/>
<br/>
The church I was raised in claimed to believe this, but the feeling <br/>
was not one of being saved no matter what mess ups you had in life.<br/>
There was perpetual fear over Satan getting ahold of you, or those <br/>
horrid wordly influences creeping in.<br/>
I often wondered why the world/Satan seemed so pervasive, so strong <br/>
against the light of God.<br/>
I now know in my heart that a fear based religion is just plain wrong.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Excellent.  I think you and I are on the same wavelength.  These <br/>
verses say that a person is not &quot;saved&quot; by works, but the works do <br/>
give evidence of the faith of person.  So while Ephesians 2:10 <br/>
says, &quot;For we are God&#39;s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do <br/>
good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do&quot;, the verse <br/>
just before it says, &quot;(You are saved by faith)...not by works, so <br/>
that no one can boast.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
If a person tells us s/he has faith in God, but we see little or no <br/>
evidence of it (and no good works), we have a strong case to wonder <br/>
about her/his faith.  On the other hand, if a person does good works, <br/>
but shows no faith in God, we might wonder about her/his faith also.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Also agreed.  No church (members or minister) is perfect, and some <br/>
churches are farther away from teaching the Bible than others.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There was perpetual fear over Satan getting ahold of you, or those <br/>

<br/>
True.  The Bible indicates that God created us to enjoy him.  And it <br/>
is certainly clear that God loves each of us (John 3:16 and other <br/>
verses).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for providing that explanation.  I wouldn&#39;t have asked you on <br/>
this list, but Sandra &quot;asked you&quot; about the verse on works in two <br/>
separate posts, so I thought it was worth a try.<br/>
