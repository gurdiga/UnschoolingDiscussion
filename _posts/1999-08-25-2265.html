<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443280457">I just decided that I want to set up my homepage for people like my mom<br/>
who insist that homeschooling limits a child, and basically people who<br/>
have the idea that homeschooling is like it was portrayed in that<br/>
infamous comic strip.  So, I have come up with topics for essays, and<br/>
have written a few (working on more).  If anyone has any experiences<br/>
they&#39;d like to share, and wouldn&#39;t mind me putting them on my webpage<br/>
for everyone to see (change names if you&#39;d like), then please e-mail<br/>
them to me.  My topics are:<br/>
   How you made the decision to homeschool<br/>
   Socialization<br/>
   Learning to read<br/>
   Interest-led learning<br/>
   Homeschooling teenagers<br/>
   Deschooling<br/>
   Learning by doing &quot;nothing&quot;<br/>
   A closer family<br/>
   Anything else (I&#39;ll probably come up with more categories later)<br/>
<br/>
Also, if anyone knows of any good books or URL&#39;s that deal specifically<br/>
with these issues, please let me know.  I&#39;ll put links on my page, so<br/>
I&#39;m looking for stories that aren&#39;t already up all over the net.<br/>
<br/>
Big thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>
Love, Melanie in Japan</div>
