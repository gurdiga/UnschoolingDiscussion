<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599948782">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
After a major computer crash and then a change to DSL I have come off<br/>
no-mail. For some reason I have to post from the web as my dsl company<br/>
wont let me post to yahoo.<br/>
<br/>
A number of things I&#39;ll get into this email....<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, we are considering moving to Colorado Springs next year. I<br/>
read the HS laws and it seems easier than Virginia with testing every<br/>
two years instead of every year. Mind you, I wont be in any rush to<br/>
tell any official I am there ;-)<br/>
Any tips from any residents, especially for secular support groups.<br/>
Ones that would take brits with spiky pink hair and boys with long<br/>
hair :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m off camping in mid-June to upstate New York (adirondacks, Niagara)<br/>
and then to Colorado Springs in August so if there&#39;s anyone who&#39;d like<br/>
to meet me, let me camp in their yard, lend me a house with servants<br/>
and a swimming pool...let me know. It would be nice to meet other<br/>
unschoolers cos they are a rarity here in north Virginia. Rarer than<br/>
hen&#39;s teeth :-)<br/>
<br/>
At some point during all this I&#39;m also going by train to San Fransisco<br/>
(get that coffee ready Meghan...).<br/>
<br/>
I reckonn after all this we&#39;d have covered United States geography 101 :-)<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, and this is a tad off topic, any recommendations to keep ticks<br/>
at bay? My 8 yo comes in from the yard with a tick nearly every day.<br/>
This is surburban middle class Virgina!! Not deep forest!! It&#39;s<br/>
driving me nuts. I have a real phobia about them and my husband has to<br/>
remove them cos I can&#39;t bear to look :-(<br/>
<br/>
Take care<br/>
<br/>
Shyrley<br/>
<br/>
PS Sorry for the ramblings. I&#39;m so excited to have my computer<br/>
functioning again.</div>

headquarters of Focus on the Family is there.  He had a friend who went to <br/>
a dentist there.  This dentist waited until she was in the chair, then <br/>
asked if she was a born-again Christian.  When she said no, he told her <br/>
that he would treat her that time, but not again. . . sigh.<br/>

on the Academy so very near focus on the family as well (I had 2 great<br/>
bumper stickers that read &quot;Goddess Bless&quot; and something about &quot;It will be a<br/>
great day when the Air Force has to hold a bake sale to buy a  new bomber.&quot;<br/>
I sure got some nasty looks:)<br/>
I found it difficult to find a support group that was tolerant of our<br/>
family and so hung out with the military group -- just left whenever they<br/>
started to pray or get conservative. But I have seen adds in (?) HEM or<br/>
somewhere for secular groups now so perhaps it&#39;s better. <br/>
I did go to some great pagan celebrations at the UU church. My older boys<br/>
still remember the drumming sessions which were really intense. I met some<br/>
great people thru LLL and the UU church but it seemed to take almost the 2<br/>
years to really dig out the liberals or unschoolers. <br/>

England and Colorado.<br/>
Boy do I hate flying but until Amtrak realise that we don&#39;t want to <br/>
*buy* the actual train and charge reasonable fares there&#39;s no <br/>
choice. Mutter mutter mutter.<br/>
I need to buy a big map of the US and see where everything is.<br/>

have any idea of the cost.  If you contact a UK travel agent, they <br/>
should be able to give you the details.  You could probably buy <br/>
one online and have it sent to your mum.<br/>
