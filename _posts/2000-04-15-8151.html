baby number five! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
tanya, me too!  only i have the fortunate experience of being a part of a <br/>
very welcoming-toward-new-life family (and friends,) so i get mostly <br/>
encouragement.  two families close to us have even had vasectomy reversals, <br/>
realizing --they felt-- that they had said &quot;no&quot; to a GIFT quite <br/>
prematurely... thought i&#39;d pass some on to you-- go girl!<br/>

&lt;&lt;So then I decided that I was POD from invasion of the body snatchers<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
aliens)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Love this.  We have a similar joke.  When my husband&#39;s feet aren&#39;t cold (a <br/>
rare occurence), I demand &quot;What have you done with my real husband!  You may <br/>
look like him, but I know you are a POD person!  You don&#39;t fool me!&quot;<br/>
