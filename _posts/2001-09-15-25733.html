in the same vein you&#39;ve been in, being with her, answering her questions, <br/>
showing her things she hasn&#39;t seen, singing and being happy with her, she <br/>
will continue to learn full time.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not until people start separating life from &quot;learning&quot; (school style) <br/>
that learning goes from all the time to only when it HAS to happen, when it <br/>
is made to happen, and before long &quot;learning&quot; becomes something to be <br/>
avoided, to earn the right to quit doing.   <br/>
<br/>
The less &quot;school-style&quot; learning you introduce or look for, the more real <br/>
learning you&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
Not pushing is good.  <br/>
Her own eagerness should be the impetus, not outside calendars or lists or <br/>
charts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766510907">Hi, Jerry!<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest if your child hasn&#39;t learned anything yet, you should do<br/>
something differently right away! But if she&#39;s already learning and exploring<br/>
her world, putting together concepts and blocks then you&#39;re probably already<br/>
on the right track.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about the &quot;earlier is better&quot; idea. I know it took me years to<br/>
recover from the forced learning in school, and from the &quot;depressing lit&quot;<br/>
classes in high school. I still don&#39;t read any fiction, and that&#39;s largely<br/>
why. I dread it.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t push her. Let her pull you.<br/>
<br/>
:-) Diane<br/>

<br/>
3 is so young.  At 6 and 8, my kids spent a good part of the day with a <br/>
neighbor boy catching frogs in our swimming pool (that was supposed to be <br/>
drained but then we had this storm and . . . never mind . . . the <br/>
frogs/tadpoles love it!).  They had a ball.  They may have learned something. <br/>
 Don&#39;t you think your 3 yo would have enjoyed splashing around chasing frogs? <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Hope you don&#39;t think I am taking you seriously -- but 3 is sooo young -- they <br/>
still wear those cute little outfits . . . (she said wistfully -- my son&#39;s <br/>
sneakers are on the floor and they are my size -- really!)  <br/>

She&#39;s already on that path and you don&#39;t need to &quot;start&quot; her.  Let her<br/>
play!  Love her, keep her safe,  and you won&#39;t be able to STOP her from<br/>
learning!  You will know the things she really loves,  blocks, stories,<br/>
babies, bread dough, bugs, water, bed sheets -- and if you&#39;re there with<br/>
her, she will be finding out all kinds of things.  First of all that YOU<br/>
are fun!  Next, that it&#39;s safe to explore and find out things for<br/>
herself.  That&#39;s all she needs -- and someone to ask for help sometimes,<br/>
too.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479881950">I believe that the first 7 years of life are your mapping years and the most important ones in our learning years. 97% of our personality is developed by age 7,soooooooooooo, if we send our children to kindegarten and first grade then, alot of very disfunctional people from age 5-???, get to be the main influences on our childrens delicate years. It is really to sad for me to look at.<br/>
