I agree with you, but wonder how you feel about<br/>
individual therapy as well, such as vision therapy or<br/>
speech therapy or physical therapy?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I feel that in the unschooling situation, the parent should research the child&#39;s particular challenges to better understand how that child is thinking/feeling/absorbing information.<br/>
The parent can find ways to assist that child in dealing with the challenges far better than any expert MOST times, because the parent is truly, deeply concerned for that child&#39;s welfare.<br/>
I&#39;ve been in classes designed for children with mental and physical challenges. Most of the stuff they did could much more easily been accomplished at home in an environment where the child is getting more adult attention. Some of the equipment they used was really cool, right/left brain type stuff....but it is all available to anyone that wants to purchase it! And a creative parent could find more affordable alternatives.<br/>
I went to speech therapy in school..what a joke.<br/>
Parents are usually the best source of help for a child with special needs,especially in the unschooling environment.<br/>
Therapy, if needed, can be provided at home. Truly.<br/>
There are going to be rare cases where a parent needs to get some help. But it all depends. For the things I&#39;ve read about here, I think the parent could do a better job with less invasion of their lives.<br/>
