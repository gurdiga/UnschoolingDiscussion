<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525442758">I hope all of you are up to some more advice. I wrote before, I am new <br/>
this year. I am hsing 2 boys 8 & 11 yro.<br/>
    My boys were in ps until this year, as I&#39;ve said we are having a <br/>
stressful adjustment period. On top of that I have a dh that is going along <br/>
but not necessarily in favor of hsing. I believe this is really the best <br/>
thing for us at this time.<br/>
Have any of you had to live through this? How did you cope? Did dh come along <br/>
finally? How long did it take. <br/>
    Any and all advice would be helpful. Feeling a little insecure.<br/>

This is our second year, and we&#39;re still living through it.  I cope by <br/>
plodding along.  My dh is unsupportive and angry (at what, I&#39;m not sure).  He <br/>
is always using homeschooling against the kids.  He&#39;s a beast lately.  Oh <br/>
well, that wasn&#39;t very encouraging was it?  Sorry.<br/>

    Well, at least I know I&#39;m not alone. My dh is pretty much staying neutral <br/>
but every now and then he has to knock the wind out of my sails and let me <br/>
know where he stands. Like you I have to wonder why. it doesn&#39;t help either <br/>
one of us or advance any cause. I wonder if it just comes down to a perceived <br/>
power struggle and he feels like I&#39;ve won. I really don&#39;t want to win <br/>
anything I just want to live and educate my kids the way I see fit. We&#39;ve <br/>
seen what the schools can do as we have older boys and what we&#39;ve experience <br/>
hasn&#39;t been good.<br/>

stuff of they won&#39;t go to college, or they&#39;ll have gaps in their knowledge.<br/>
Those are easily discussed and are usually what they use to divert attention<br/>
from what&#39;s really bothering them.<br/>
<br/>
Stepping outside the box is an awesome thing when you stop to consider all<br/>
the ramifications.  Once you begin questioning whether any cultural norm is<br/>
necessary, you begin to question them all.  That can be overwhelming. He may<br/>
just be stuck in a rut in regards to reactions... if you can get him past<br/>
that, you might be able to fix it.<br/>

When he takes the wind out of your sails, what do you do?<br/>

bought the home we live in due to the school district!)  But by reading<br/>
books myself and sharing little paragraphs with him and examples of what<br/>
was going on with the kids we made it through.  I also encouraged him to<br/>
meet other hsing parents and ask questions.  He also met hsing teens - and<br/>
grilled the poor girl - but she took it in stride and really surprised him.<br/>
 Now, dh is on the bandwagon and knows it is the best thing for our kids at<br/>
least right now.  I suspect when high school rolls around we may have to do<br/>
some talking.  But by then (I have 5 more years) I think he will see the<br/>
overall benefit of what hsing is doing for our girls.  It&#39;s kind of like<br/>
unschooling, it takes a lot of trust in dh too!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Laura, how fast things move depends on so many variables, it&#39;s hard to give<br/>
you an accurate picture.  It depends on how badly your children were hurt by<br/>
being in the system, by how much they have to heal. It depends a bit on<br/>
their learning style.  A hands on doer is going to give you more to feel<br/>
comfortable with compared to a quiet, reflective thinker.<br/>
<br/>
Dh&#39;s usually come along, but it takes a while.  That too depends on his own<br/>
school experience, his own expectations and fears.  Dh&#39;s usually take the<br/>
longest to come around.<br/>
<br/>
The very best piece of advice is to just DO.  Start your own projects, go<br/>
places, go to the moves, see a play, keep yourself so busy with real life<br/>
that you do not sit and think about *school work*.  As time goes on  you<br/>
will see how the children are learning, even without anyone telling them<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Now, many times I&#39;ve heard people say, but they won&#39;t EVER do math if I<br/>
don&#39;t make them.  I finally figured out that that is probably true.  No<br/>
self-respecting 12 year boy is going wake up one morning and say, &quot;I want to<br/>
do every odd problem of chapter 6 of a math text&quot;.   (Okay, I have a friend<br/>
who has a son who chooses to do math problems, but Ricky&#39;s, well Ricky...;))<br/>
Anyway, another good thing for you to do is to sit down with a bunch of<br/>
text, look at how they try to bring real life into those text. The math<br/>
problems are about going to the store with $5 and needing to buy one of<br/>
these and 2 of those.  So, GO to the store and actually buy one of these and<br/>
two of those and count your change. You&#39;ve just done a math problem and<br/>
taken care of an errand.  This frees up time to sit and read a good book,<br/>
either to yourself or to the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Just wait until they ask for the car keys for the first time, this will seem<br/>
like a piece of cake. ;)<br/>

has met other homeschoolers and especially teen homeschoolers, he feels fine<br/>
about it.  In fact he was very impressed.<br/>

    I think this is why I&#39;m so hard on myself also. I already have 4 grown <br/>
boys, so I can&#39;t figure out why this all throws me so. I feel like a young <br/>

<br/>
I think one of the reasons that my husband is supportive of hsing is that I <br/>
told him (in nauseating detail) about the goings on at the ps during the <br/>
process of trying to get my son adequate instruction.   I think he was amazed <br/>
we lasted as long as we did at the ps after some of the frustrations we <br/>
experienced.  (i.e., we have been hsing since we pulled my son out last April <br/>
(mid K) and the school still has not finished the process of having him <br/>
tested to determine where they would place him were he in school -- not that <br/>
he&#39;s going back any time soon but I figured I&#39;d let them pay for the tests.)  <br/>
Ours is not anywhere near some of the horror stories one hears, but dealing <br/>
with the inanities and insanities of the admin has been thoroughly brought <br/>
home to my husband.  He is generally supportive anyway and (perhaps thanks to <br/>
working about 1 million hours a week and not having much of a choice) trusts <br/>
me to make decisions for the good of all.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>

Sometimes it helps to ask a reluctant husband to just give <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling a fair try for one year.  If he has doubts during <br/>
the year there may need to be a plan for him to discuss them with you <br/>
*privately*.  It would be wonderful if you could get him to agree to support <br/>
homeschooling (or at least stay NEUTRAL) in front of the kids for a full year.<br/>
<br/>
But if he never agreed to support HS and just got dragged into it (sorry, I <br/>
wasn&#39;t there -- I have to guess), then he&#39;s going to need to vent and debate <br/>
before he can possibly take a vow of silent support.<br/>

    No, I didn&#39;t drag him. The schools our kids have been in have beat us to <br/>
death for years. We were both really tired of dealing with them. I believe he <br/>
will remain mostly neutral. The 11yro now and then talks about going back and <br/>
I think that may help to get dh going again. I just felt so alone with this, <br/>

I recommend a book entitled &quot;I Don&#39;t Want to Talk About It&quot; by Terrence Real as a<br/>
means of understanding what the hell is wrong with many men (myself sadly<br/>
included) and also &quot;Real Boys&quot; by William Pollack is a must read for raising<br/>
sons.<br/>
Unfortunately alot of those &quot;guy things&quot; are maladaptive and excruciatingly<br/>
painful for everyone around them.  The socialization of men is distorted in so<br/>
many ways.  The fear of making boys &quot;mama&#39;s boys&quot; is a real confusion.<br/>

    Wow! I&#39;m thrilled to have a guy answer and so honestly. I have been <br/>
raising and living with all men (my dh and 6 sons) for over 20 yrs and still <br/>
have a hard time understanding them. I believe I do well though. I understand <br/>
so much more than I ever did. I know that my spending time with my boys is <br/>
not going to effect them the way my dh may think. For one thing I have some <br/>
of the most stubborn, very male kids that I have ever come across. I am the <br/>
minority here and boy do I know it! (pun not intended) <br/>
    I will read the books you suggested, thanks.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I do want to make it clear though that he has always been a great dad and <br/>
 husband. I have been able to stay home w/ all my kids. He has always been <br/>
 very involved in their care. I think maybe he worries I&#39;ll make them momma&#39;s <br/>
 boys or something. Maybe it&#39;s a guy thing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
Laura, <br/>
you hit the nail on the head.  My dh is exactly like this.  But from year <br/>
after year of hearing their evaluation reports, and finding no fault with <br/>
their communication skills, he gets more and more behind me! lol<br/>

<br/>
    I can&#39;t wait and do believe it will happen. I think it scares him more <br/>
than me because I&#39;m doing it, he&#39;s more removed and has to trust me. I think <br/>
the ear gets the better of him now and then.<br/>
    I really appreciate everyone&#39;s advice. Thanks, I fell so much better.<br/>

&lt;&lt; On top of that I have a dh that is going along <br/>
 but not necessarily in favor of hsing. I believe this is really the best <br/>
 thing for us at this time.<br/>
 Have any of you had to live through this? How did you cope? Did dh come <br/>
along <br/>
 finally? How long did it take.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Laura,<br/>
     When we started homeschooling a few years ago, my husband was not for it <br/>
at all!!  He knew how unbearably unhappy one of our children was, and we had <br/>
begged, cried, and pleaded for over a year.  Finally in February, he said <br/>
that I could give it a try for the rest of the year, but if he was unhappy <br/>
with how we did, they would go back to school the following year!  Egad!!!!!  <br/>
That just gave me 4 months!!!!!!!<br/>
     Well, now my husband is totally for homeschooling!!!   He never suggests <br/>
putting the kids back in school at all.  And although he doesn&#39;t really <br/>
understand unschooling (he still comes home and asks how school was <br/>
today----or asks to see some of the kids schoolpapers), he really loves the <br/>
difference it has made in our kids.  <br/>
     Let your husband see the difference this year makes to your kids, then <br/>
he will probably be behind homeschooling 100%.<br/>

Lucy, I am from Tehachapi, CA and I remember way back when I was in high <br/>
school (1989-90) hearing about how Lancaster&#39;s high schools had metal <br/>
detectors and on campus police! It seems they have always been lacking <br/>
something...Thanks for reminding us of some of the horrors we are avoiding by <br/>
keeping our kids at home! Blessings, Lori in TX</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051670376">This is one of those stories that could use a little international light on it.<br/>
You might consider a press release all ready in the event any draconian stupidity<br/>
occurs. The appeal should all be ready.    In addition one must always remember<br/>
the noble tradition of civil disobedience.  I would not allow my 13 year old to<br/>
be sent away for 120 days.  I would flee.  Sounds like a disturbed area.<br/>
<br/>
The more I think about it the more outrageous it becomes.  So this 13 year old<br/>
has long history of violent threats?  He has committed numerous acts of violence?<br/>
He is a danger to the community? Please publicize this school district and their<br/>
practices.<br/>

&gt;     My dh was just kind of blah about the whole hs thing for quite a while.<br/>
&gt; I wished he would read some of the books I had read and sometimes I did read<br/>
&gt; him excerpts but that was about it.  I think time has been the main thing<br/>
&gt; that has developed his personal convictions about hsing.  Over the years, we<br/>
&gt; have seen drastic differences in our kids and the children we know who are in<br/>
&gt; the school systems.  Some of them seem to do fine but the majority have had<br/>
&gt; some serious problems.  Also, my parents, who are retired, began working part<br/>
&gt; time during the school year as noon duty aids to supplement their income.<br/>
&gt; They work in a VERY affluent school district yet we are horrified by what we<br/>
&gt; hear from them.  Some of it concerns the way kids treat other kids (some of<br/>
&gt; the popular kids making fun of and trying to degrade some of the special ed<br/>
&gt; kids) and some of it concerns the way the school treats the kids (school<br/>
&gt; people who humiliate kids in attempts to control them).<br/>
&gt;      Recently we are involved in a very serious problem concerning my nephew.<br/>
&gt;  Last July, a teacher had him stay through lunch for a test and told him she<br/>
&gt; would give him a pass to get lunch afterward in the cafeteria.  When he went<br/>
&gt; to the cafeteria with the pass, the cafeteria worker told him it was too<br/>
&gt; late, that they were closed.  He argued with her and she responded angrily.<br/>
&gt; Then he made the very foolish mistake of gesturing with his finger across his<br/>
&gt; throat and said (according to her; his story varies), &quot;My mom&#39;s gonna get<br/>
&gt; you.&quot;  They called the police.  We helped his parents get him enrolled in an<br/>
&gt; independent study private school and he has stayed with us (we live 3 hrs<br/>
&gt; away) for part of the time since then.  The school still held a meeting,<br/>
&gt; expelled him, and now he is being charged with threatening a school official,<br/>
&gt; which is a felony.  He is 13 years old, has a speech impediment and a<br/>
&gt; weakness on the right side of his body from some complications when he was<br/>
&gt; born.  His public defender says to be prepared that the judge may give him<br/>
&gt; 120 days in a youth camp.  We, he, his parents, and his other family members<br/>
&gt; are really afraid for him.  I don&#39;t know how he will survive in there or<br/>
&gt; whether he will come out of it much worse.  This is a first offense for him.<br/>
&gt;      This town is much worse than others that I know of (it&#39;s Lancaster, CA)<br/>
&gt; and is doing many things that I feel are a violation of people&#39;s rights.  But<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t trust any school completely.  My husband now agrees with me<br/>
&gt; completely that we would never subject our children to the arbitrary<br/>
&gt; authority of people who work for the schools.  I&#39;m sorry this post has gotten<br/>
&gt; so long but this thing with my nephew is really on my mind right now.<br/>
&gt;     Anyway, to those who have reluctant dhs, just do what you know is right,<br/>
&gt; share all the info you can with them, and let time begin to show them how<br/>
&gt; much healthier and happier your children are hsing.  Best wishes...<br/>

I hope that your nephew&#39;s pediatrician would testify or write a statement <br/>
about this condition.  I think that would have some credibility with the <br/>

&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; The socialization of men is distorted in so<br/>

     Wow! I&#39;m thrilled to have a guy answer and so honestly. I have been <br/>
 raising and living with all men (my dh and 6 sons) for over 20 yrs and still <br/>
 have a hard time understanding them. I believe I do well though. I <br/>
understand <br/>
 so much more than I ever did. I know that my spending time with my boys is <br/>
 not going to effect them the way my dh may think. For one thing I have some <br/>
 of the most stubborn, very male kids that I have ever come across. I am the <br/>
 minority here and boy do I know it! (pun not intended) <br/>
     I will read the books you suggested, thanks.<br/>
