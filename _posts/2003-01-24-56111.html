 </span></blockquote>But they DON&#39;T. Often THEY were spanked, and although they didn&#39;t like it, <br/>
they turned out just fine, right? Everybody else is doing it---especially in <br/>
their church/community. Preacher&#39;s saying it&#39;s the RIGHT thing to do. God <br/>
commands them to &quot;spare the rod and spoil the child&quot;. They don&#39;t know how to <br/>
keep little Bobby from talking back to his mama---and the book touted in the <br/>
last adult Sunday school class says to use a paddle or a switch. If he does <br/>
it again, use it harder. Don&#39;t spank in anger---do it in cold blood, when <br/>
you&#39;re calm and calculating.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re being TOLD this, Deborah. A LOT. Sure, they are spineless and coerced <br/>
and allowing someone else to make decisions for them. But they&#39;re also, every <br/>
Sunday and Wednesday, being told that they are SHEEP. That God is their <br/>
shepherd and that the preacher is God&#39;s representative on earth and will LEAD <br/>
them the RIGHT way. They&#39;ve also all spent YEARS in school being told to <br/>
listen to and DO what others tell them to do. They are taught NOT to <br/>
question. What do you REALLY expect? What do THEY really expect?<br/>
<br/>
There are a few who will break away and make their own decisions and choices. <br/>
Most won&#39;t. They are Christians. And they will spank. God &quot;told&quot; them to.<br/>

Joyce wrote something recently about  being able to swim. let me look...<br/>
This was originally written about H$LDA, but it applies here as well:<br/>
<br/>
Joyce: <br/>
&quot;For someone who can swim a piece of wood with rusty nails wouldn&#39;t look<br/>
appealing as a floating aid. If they wanted to float, they&#39;d float on their<br/>
backs and grab a raft if it happened along. For someone who can&#39;t swim, the<br/>
piece of wood with rusty nails would look like a lifesaver.&quot;<br/>
