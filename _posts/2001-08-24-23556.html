<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140306392">Wow,<br/>
This digest has been great the past few days!! I wish I had time to get more<br/>
into the discussions...<br/>
Just to toss out my experience with &#39;back -to-school&#39;...Let&#39;s see....last<br/>
evening my youngsters and I played outside after dinner until dark (as we<br/>
love to do in the good &#39;ol summertime!) All the neighbors glumly had to go<br/>
in by 7:45 or 8 to get ready for the early rising.  I was sad for them and<br/>
their missing out on the nicest &#39;playing out&#39; weather.<br/>
  I have noticed,  like someone else,  the &#39;school kids&#39; hang out here more<br/>
just prior to school starting .... &#39;cause their parents are SO busy getting<br/>
things ready,  they don&#39;t have time for being with the kids.  I also have<br/>
noticed the school kids stress levels....during the 1st few weeks of school<br/>
as they adjust to that treacherous early schedule and during the last few<br/>
weeks of school,  when they&#39;re about bursting to get OUT of that cycle of<br/>
school!  These are the times when I find my patience with them being tried<br/>
immensely!!<br/>
   One amusing anecdote...a family on our street inevitably comes to the end<br/>
of school vacation and hasn&#39;t provided all the &#39;experiences&#39; they&#39;d promised<br/>
their kids at the beginning - so they try to cram it all in!  The day before<br/>
school started they a) went to the Children&#39; Museum with us for 2-1/2 hrs<br/>
(we stayed...they had to go), b)went to Fantasy Frontier to drive little<br/>
cars c) went to laser tag, d) went bowling and e) had a marshmallow roast as<br/>
a goodbye to summer  ROTFL!!  Of course,  they had to finish all this by<br/>
8p.m. so they could go bathe and get their school &#39;stuff&#39; ready!<br/>
    At dinner tonight my 6yog said Courtney wanted her to go to school with<br/>
her.  I asked if she meant to visit....my dd said she thought so....she said<br/>
Courtney wanted her to see the place they get to play every day.  DD thought<br/>
it was great that they got to play at school.  Older dd explained that they<br/>
do get to play at school...BUT it&#39;s only about 15 minutes after lunch ...not<br/>
much in a 7 hour day!  We discussed the other limitations...always the same<br/>
playground....always crowded, etc.  DD decided her life is much better the<br/>
way it is!!<br/>
