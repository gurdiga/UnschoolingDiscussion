<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923662583">Dear Sandra (and list),<br/>
<br/>
As owner of this list, I heartily applaud your letter!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on the road for much of this past week, and have been unable to<br/>
monitor the posts here, but I&#39;ve got a mailbox full of complaints and<br/>
requests for a change of subject matter on this list.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;ve done a fine job of outlining the situation, so I won&#39;t<br/>
repeat things here, but I wanted to let you and the list know that I am in<br/>
complete agreement with your request.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;I took the road less travelled by,<br/>
and that has made all the difference.&quot;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi, all!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was becoming uncomfortable with some of the postings on this list and I<br/>
&gt;thought it was just me, but there are a few others as well, so if I might<br/>
&gt;have your attention for a moment I would like to present some reminders and a<br/>
&gt;proposal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;www.unschooling.com is an incredible resource for the homeschooling<br/>
&gt;community.  There is a mountain of material on homeschooling in general, but<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s hard to find some clear, quality unschooling support.  Not only are<br/>
&gt;there essays and FAQs and message boards, there is a mail list!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If those message boards fill up with things which aren&#39;t unschooling related,<br/>
&gt;or if the mailing list goes off on structured-learning tangents and doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;come back, it will be harder for people to get the focussed support they<br/>
&gt;should be able to expect in an area called unschooling.com.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are lots of people on this list and I&#39;m glad of it, and I don&#39;t work<br/>
&gt;for the forum, I&#39;m just someone on the list.  But as others have inquired of<br/>
&gt;me as though they think I might be able to redirect the flow of these<br/>
&gt;mailings, I am bravely going to ask that conversations which encourage<br/>
&gt;structured learning over unschooling be minimized or eliminated and that<br/>
&gt;conversations which have nothing to do with either of those be taken to<br/>
&gt;private e-mail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now someone who actually works on the forum might come along and ask me to<br/>
&gt;quit asking anyone to change anything, but that&#39;s a risk I&#39;ll take for the<br/>
&gt;sake of helping keep this list fascinating and useful for the unschoolers who<br/>
&gt;might sign on just now as I&#39;m writing this, or next weekend when a bunch of<br/>
&gt;us are away, or next month.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d also ask that the most experienced homeschoolers among us go and post<br/>
&gt;something in the message boards at www.unschooling.com at least once a week,<br/>
&gt;if not more.   If we spend all our energy here we won&#39;t be building as<br/>
&gt;glorious a life-changing resource on the internet.   We can keep children in<br/>
&gt;distant states from suffering the indignity of being put through school at<br/>
&gt;home if we provide their parents with inspiring alternative information.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

Since joining this list to learn more about unschooling, I&#39;ve found myself <br/>
deleting almost all the messages that have the subject &quot;Unschooling or not?&quot; <br/>
