<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355547943">All our local schools are out for Spring Break......and it&#39;s driving me<br/>
crazy!!<br/>
<br/>
One neighbor Mom started a 10am-3pm job recently.  Her disabled Hubby is<br/>
home,  but he&#39;s like a non-entity.  I&#39;m feeling like the taken-for-granted<br/>
SAHM these days.  Her DD was here ALL day Monday.  Tuesday I planned a zoo<br/>
trip,  but Courtney AND her brother showed up on my doorstep at 10:03 am!!<br/>
We still went,  but it took almost an hour and a half to get ready because<br/>
those two were hanging around outside and my young ones were easily<br/>
distracted.<br/>
    Today I planned our (usual) weekly library trip padded with a few<br/>
errands.  Coutney showed up at 10:06am.  Jenna,  the 3yo,  especially didn&#39;t<br/>
want to got to the library and fought so much I gave up.  The toddler has a<br/>
cold....anyhow,  I gave up on the library trip &#39;til this evening.  Decided<br/>
to let Courtney play here until lunchtime.   Well,  the kid wouldn&#39;t go home<br/>
and wouldn&#39;t say why.  i asked my 7 yr old to talk to her about what&#39;s going<br/>
on that she doesn&#39;t want to be at her house.  She says maybe because her<br/>
dad&#39;s always yelling at her,  but I asked her to talk it over with her<br/>
anyway.<br/>
    So I need to confront this kid&#39;s mother before she assumes I&#39;m a free<br/>
sitter service for the summer.<br/>
    I wish I weren&#39;t so resentful and bothered by this.....but I am.<br/>
    The other &#39;problem&#39; I&#39;m having is that the old fogey types on the street<br/>
seem to come to balme me for all their kid issues.   This is probably<br/>
because I&#39;m the only parent who sits outside to &#39;be&#39; there,  to keep my<br/>
toddler and three yr old safe,  to remind the older ones about appropriate<br/>
parameters.  One lady asked me why the girls have to scream so much.  They<br/>
were all (about 10) doing gymnastics things,  rolling on the ground ad<br/>
having fun.  I didn&#39;t register any screaming,  so I&#39;m either deaf or<br/>
tolerant.  (I was in her yard to re-direct my toddler out of her yard.)  I<br/>
explained that I was getting him,  apologized if he and I had disturbed<br/>
her....and replied about the screaming that it&#39;s the first day of Spring<br/>
Break for those kids (all freed from the repression of the school schedule -<br/>
and uniform for some)  and that since it was a beautiful day to romp<br/>
outside,  that&#39;s just what they neede to do.   Then I walked away....and<br/>
thought   SHEEEEESH!,  lady,  you have two dds.  Do you not remember?  Did<br/>
yours never squeal with the joy of jumpimg around?  Do you forget when the<br/>
youngest turns 16?  WHy do you live in this neighborhood anyway?  Do you<br/>
think I&#39;m responsible for you being disturbed?  Have you considered getting<br/>
better windows?  How &#39;bout thanking me for being the ONE adult who is<br/>
actually there and available if trouble begins to brew or if there are<br/>
questions and things going on?<br/>
<br/>
Susan,    frustrated and venting......and planning to go out by myself while<br/>
dd is at soccer practice this evening in the hope of re-couping some peace<br/>
and serenity....And NOT due to stress from the children,  but FROM THE CRAZY<br/>
ADULTS!!<br/>
