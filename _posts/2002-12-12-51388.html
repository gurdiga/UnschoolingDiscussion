<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Very funny.  But the engineer forgot to calculate in that not all Christian<br/>
&gt; children believe in Santa.  Spanish-the magi bring gifts on Ephiphany<br/>
&gt; Sunday. Italian-An old woman (I forget her name) brings gifts.<br/>
&gt; Some Christians-parents or the Christ Child brings gifts.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This has been facinating to me in Germany.  Santa comes in the person of St.<br/>
Nikolaus on Dec. 6th.  He brings small toys and candy, and switches and<br/>
coal.  Children write their letters to the Kristkind (Christ Child), and the<br/>
Kristkind is the one who comes on Dec. 24.  To me, that totally unwinds the<br/>
Santa/Jesus confusion of the holiday that happens in American culture.<br/>
<br/>
(An interesting side note, totally unrelated to &quot;proper&quot; unschooling,<br/>
whatever the heck that is.)<br/>
