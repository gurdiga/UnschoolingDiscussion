<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570975689">My son got a Christmas present today from someone at church.  He&#39;s been<br/>
restless about the presents sitting under the tree, so he opened this one<br/>
tonight.  <br/>
<br/>
She bought him 10 rolls of adding machine tape.  He loves cash register<br/>
reciepts and is always trying to grab them ahead of me.  I never imagined<br/>
these would be so much fun!  He&#39;s been occupied for over an hour making<br/>
little paper rolls.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still laughing about the look on his face when he opened the bag!<br/>

using adding machine tape.  I might have been in What Do We Do Monday?<br/>
