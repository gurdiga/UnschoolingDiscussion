<div id="ygrps-yiv-729759416">I have two things that I am totally stumped on. Any suggestions would help.<br/>
<br/>
1. My son Joseph (7) has always had these habits that he has picked up that <br/>
aren&#39;t the best. First it was him picking his fingernails. He never bit <br/>
them, just picked until they bled. Then it was him picking his lips. That he <br/>
did until they bled also. Then he started to chew his tongue. He still does <br/>
that some when he&#39;s really involved in something like drawing or even <br/>
playing gameboy. We would use a code word to him that no one knew but him so <br/>
that we could remind him of what he was doing. He stopped doing each one and <br/>
now has moved on to something different. Now he touches his penis. Not like <br/>
a scratching, although he has said it itches. More like a playing twisting <br/>
kind of thing. He has no rash or anything. If I remind him of it then <br/>
sometimes he crosses his legs real tight like he has to pee. I&#39;m not sure <br/>
it&#39;s something he&#39;ll grow out of as it seems to be quite a habit. He also <br/>
does this in public.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. My daughter Sierra (6) is a crier. She&#39;s very funny and very easy to <br/>
laugh and just as easy to cry. She&#39;ll cry if something physical happens and <br/>
cries like she broke something. She&#39;ll also cry if she want&#39;s something that <br/>
just isn&#39;t happening. Like when the carnival shut down exactly at 11:00 and <br/>
she wanted to ride the dragons again. When this happens, she really cries. <br/>
If we try talking to her, it gets worse. I usually just hold her and wait it <br/>
out. It can go on quite awhile. If I try to talk to her after the fact, all <br/>
she says is I don&#39;t know when asked about how she felt or what we can do to <br/>
help. I get no answers at all. I feel bad that she gets so upset and feel <br/>
helpless.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas with either one of my dilemma&#39;s would be appreciated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I too would like some suggestions on this! Is it just a phase? Jack is 6 <br/>
also, and sometimes, something will upset my little guy so much he just <br/>
cries. It breaks my heart. The other evening, I was about to go out to a <br/>
meeting and was showing a new baby-sitter around and the dog had to go out. <br/>
Jack was playing playstation and no one else was around, so I went ahead and <br/>
asked him to please take Maggie out. He got up all happy and excited and took <br/>
her out. Meanwhile, I went to the kitchen to show the sitter how the phone <br/>
works, where snacks are... and Moly went to the living room, realized her <br/>
show was about to start and turned off the playstation. When Jack came back <br/>
in he just broke down. I was almost late because I was holding him. I talked <br/>
about how Moly should have found out if he was done before she turned it off <br/>
etc... He just cried harder. In the end, it turned out that all he wished <br/>
Moly would have done was save it before she turned it off. At Karate this <br/>
evening, he cried and cried when the class was over. Turned out he had so <br/>
much fun, he still thought there should be more time. <br/>
<br/>
I agree with you Mary, its heartbreaking to see them cry and cry like that. <br/>
And I always feel so powerless when it happens, and I never know what to say <br/>
and sometimes, no matter what I say he just cries harder. And these crying <br/>
jags aren&#39;t like temper tantrums, this is pure emotion just pouring out!<br/>

Gee when I saw the subject line I got all excited thinking I had a <br/>
suggestion already!!! It is heartbreaking isn&#39;t it Nancy? Has your son been <br/>
doing this or has it just come up? Sierra has always been like this. I think <br/>
it might be somewhat better now than when she was younger. Not really enough <br/>
for me to be sure though. I wonder if it&#39;s something she will be able to <br/>
better handle as she gets older, then again I think of someone I knew like <br/>
that well into adult life. I just hate not knowing if it&#39;s something to just <br/>
hug and leave alone or something I could/should be doing. Hopefully we&#39;ll <br/>
get some response on this one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-780556234">My son is very sensitive to things. Everyday things really bother him! So we<br/>
talk alot about why, what could he do to change it, and we/he figure<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What occurs to me is that when I&#39;m feeling sad enough about something to <br/>
cry, the only thing that helps me is empathy.  Someone with their arm <br/>
around my shoulders and a quiet, &quot;Yeah.&quot;  or &quot;You must be so sad <br/>
[frustrated, angry, whatever emotion seems to be right].&quot;  What I do NOT <br/>
want is someone trying to help me figure out ways to deal with it!  I just <br/>
want someone to understand and care that I&#39;m upset.  My husband used to try <br/>
to fix stuff for me by saying, &quot;Well, I think you need to...&quot; and then he&#39;d <br/>
tell me all the stuff I should be doing or thinking about.  It would just <br/>
piss me off.  Then, I summoned the courage to say, &quot;I don&#39;t want you to fix <br/>
this.  I can figure it out.  I&#39;m sad and what I need from you is <br/>
comfort.&quot;  So, that&#39;s what I do for Liam.  If he doesn&#39;t want my comfort, <br/>
he lets me know.  I respect that.  But, more often than not, he&#39;ll lay his <br/>
head on my lap and cry, maybe for quite a while.  Sometimes we&#39;ll talk, if <br/>
he initiates it.  We may be silent for a few moments, and then he&#39;ll be okay.<br/>
<br/>
As far as problem #1, I&#39;d be interested to see others&#39; responses.<br/>

Thanks Marji. And that&#39;s exactly what I do now with Sierra. The talking <br/>
during or even after doesn&#39;t work, so hugging is my only response now. I <br/>
just can&#39;t help feeling there is something else I could be doing for her.<br/>

<br/>
Mary, my guy does this, in fact I&#39;m amazed at how far that appendage can<br/>
be stretched with apparently no pain.  LOL  I haven&#39;t thought much about<br/>
it, although he does seem to leave it alone in public.  Obviously it&#39;s<br/>
not the same as playing with his elbow, since others can touch his elbow<br/>
and not be inappropriate but it&#39;s still just a part of his body.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I don&#39;t say anything to him, if that&#39;s what he wants to be<br/>
touching so be it, seems pretty normal.  If he did it in public and I was<br/>
concerned that someone would comment rudely I might mention that this<br/>
could happen so he could be aware.<br/>

keeping your mouth closed and your arms and heart open.  Aside from <br/>
allowing her to know that her feelings are okay and don&#39;t need to be fixed, <br/>
you&#39;re teaching her an appropriate compassionate response that she will be <br/>
able to call on for her friends and family in the future.  You&#39;re showing <br/>
her that it&#39;s okay to feel our feelings and that you love her and all her <br/>

I wonder if you could get him to intentionally move it to something fairly<br/>
harmless? (I&#39;m now trying to think of something fairly harmless that could<br/>
be done repeatedly -- I know people who are always running their hand<br/>
through their hair when concentrating, etc., there must be more than that<br/>
one, though). If you could help him to pick something along those lines,<br/>
maybe you could redirect to that and then if he outgrew it, great, and if<br/>
not, no actual harm done.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Six was hard on my oldest daughter, too. I think sympathizing with her<br/>
general pain in life will eventually move her past it to better coping. She<br/>
may NOT know why she&#39;s crying or what you can do about it. You could talk to<br/>
her after sometime and make a few suggestions of things you&#39;d be willing to<br/>
do, and ask her, &quot;Would you rather I pick you up and take you someplace<br/>
quiet, or sit with you there? Would you rather I talk to you while you&#39;re<br/>
crying, or just hush up and rock you? Does it help if I stroke your hair, or<br/>
is that just annoying?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
My son is just exactly like yours.  Zach is 9.  He is a twitchy kind of kid.<br/>
He is always biting the skin on his fingers, making odd noises, scratching,<br/>
adjusting his penis.  It is just the way he is.  We talk about how socially<br/>
acceptable or possibly injurious the behaviors are and try to leave it at<br/>
that.  Example:  Adriane (11)is mortified about Zach adjusting his penis<br/>
while talking with her friends.  We suggested that he might want to excuse<br/>
himself to do that.<br/>
<br/>
He does better with lots of physical activity and with time spent daily<br/>
getting a backrub.<br/>

anything. If I remind him of it then sometimes he crosses his legs real<br/>

I went through this with Tim, and it was worse in summer, since shorts make<br/>
all those parts more accessible.  Winter coming helped us, but since you&#39;re<br/>
in south Florida (right?), I don&#39;t know that the weather will solve this one<br/>
for you!<br/>
<br/>
Tim and I had a talk about private parts and they really can be fun to play<br/>
with, and that it&#39;s fine to play with them.  But there are better and worse<br/>
places to do this.  Just like bouncing big balls in the house is a bad idea,<br/>
but outside is great, playing with your private parts when other people are<br/>
around is not a good idea, because some people might not be comfortable with<br/>
you doing that.  <br/>
<br/>
He got the idea, but wanted endless details like, in your bed is always<br/>
fine, in your car seat is ok if it&#39;s just Mommy and Daddy in the car, in a<br/>
restaurant waiting for food is not good, etc.  Maybe this is too much like<br/>
rules, but it did work, with a few gentle reminders.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665565851">***My son Joseph (7) has always had these habits that he has picked up<br/>
that <br/>
aren&#39;t the best.***<br/>
<br/>
This won&#39;t help but it reminded me of a story.  My friend&#39;s son used to<br/>
pick his fingernails and his teacher at school called the counselor and<br/>
the counselor called them mom and said she absolutely must get him<br/>
counseling and maybe medication blah, blah, blah.   She was visiting her<br/>
sister (who is a naturopath) that weekend and her sister looked at him<br/>
and discovered he had a fungus.  <br/>
<br/>
I wonder how much counseling the poor itchy kid would have had to endure<br/>
at school for a fungus?<br/>
<br/>
Any way, might he just have to pee?  My son always waited until the very<br/>
last crucial second before going and wiggly gyrations and twisting of<br/>
body parts were all part of that ritual to help him hold it just a little<br/>
bit longer.  He just didn&#39;t want to miss one interesting thing by being<br/>
in the bathroom. <br/>
Briefs too tight?<br/>
<br/>
***My daughter Sierra (6) is a crier.***<br/>
<br/>
Could she just be reacting to excitement or stress?  The thing that makes<br/>
her cry is like the last straw?  Dylan was like that, if there was a lot<br/>
of excitement he could take it for a while but then if anything went<br/>
wrong he just melted.  A kind of sensory overload. <br/>
He has out grown this mostly, although he still avoids really busy places<br/>
and things. <br/>
Would it help to get her someplace quiet while she calms down?<br/>

Sorry Mary   = (    I hate for little people to be sad.<br/>

Why allow him even the thought of a heaven?<br/>
Hitler can&#39;t go to heaven if there is no hell.<br/>
He&#39;s just dead.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, people are wrong to suggest that fascism died with <br/>
Hitler. It is so easy to create monsters out of an individual. <br/>
Instead, we should consider that nazism is just one permutation of <br/>
all the prejudices and atrocities humans are are more than capable of <br/>
achieving.<br/>
<br/>
What I am more worried about are the little acts of fascism that <br/>
people commit everyday  --especially if they are just passive <br/>
observers.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Mary, my guy does this, in fact I&#39;m amazed at how far that appendage can<br/>
be stretched with apparently no pain.  LOL  I haven&#39;t thought much about<br/>
it, although he does seem to leave it alone in public.  Obviously it&#39;s<br/>
not the same as playing with his elbow, since others can touch his elbow<br/>
and not be inappropriate but it&#39;s still just a part of his body.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I don&#39;t say anything to him, if that&#39;s what he wants to be<br/>
touching so be it, seems pretty normal.  If he did it in public and I was <br/>
concerned that someone would comment rudely I might mention that this could <br/>
happen so he could be aware.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know I at first thought it was just a little boy thing and that he would <br/>
stop. But it&#39;s been like a year now and it hasn&#39;t gotten any better and I do <br/>
worry as he does do it just as much when in public or whoever is around. <br/>
I&#39;ve seen grown men walking around during the day doing the same thing and <br/>
it doesn&#39;t look nice. Don&#39;t want Joseph to be one of those guys.<br/>

keeping your mouth closed and your arms and heart open.  Aside from<br/>
allowing her to know that her feelings are okay and don&#39;t need to be fixed, <br/>
you&#39;re teaching her an appropriate compassionate response that she will be <br/>
able to call on for her friends and family in the future.  You&#39;re showing <br/>
her that it&#39;s okay to feel our feelings and that you love her and all her <br/>
wide range of good and bad feelings.<br/>

As far as Sierra goes, I&#39;m trying to be as comforting as possible. I guess <br/>
that will be enough for her and maybe she will handle her feelings better as <br/>
she gets older. If not, mom will still be here. I just have feelings <br/>

Hi Brenda, I actually had that little talk with him too. Just trying from <br/>
the beginning to even just keep it in the house or back yard instead of in <br/>
public. Didn&#39;t even suggest just his bedroom. The whole house would be fine <br/>
if he could just stop in public. I pick him up from his homeschooling sports <br/>
camp and here he comes walking with maybe 80 people around and he&#39;s still <br/>
playing! I&#39;ve mentioned to my husband maybe he needs a cup!! Okay, only <br/>
kidding on that one.<br/>
<br/>
And no, with us in FL I don&#39;t see where the weather will make a difference. <br/>
I&#39;ve even asked maybe if different underwear would help as he&#39;s actually <br/>
said it &quot;bothers&quot; him. He wears the boxer briefs and also has regular briefs <br/>
too. Not sure if boxers would make it better or worse. Maybe I should try <br/>
that. Believe me when I say he does it A LOT.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Probably by the time he was 3 or 4.  He was 2 at the time I remember.  He<br/>
used to run around naked.  He had a little friend who lived very close by in<br/>
our trailer park.  One day I came around the corner of our trailer and saw<br/>
him walking up the steps to her trailer . . . buck naked and tieing it in a<br/>
knot.   For some reason, she wasn&#39;t allowed out to play that day.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

remember because my mom nagged me about it.<br/>
<br/>
My boys finally stopped around 4 or 5.  It seems like it got worse or better <br/>
depending on the change of seasons and whether they were wearing diapers or <br/>
pull-ups or undies or jeans or shorts and sweats.  It&#39;s not as accessible in <br/>
blue jeans.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s perfectly normal and to be expected, but a little guidance on <br/>
when it&#39;s definitely *not* appropriate is okay.<br/>

Well I guess not having one, I&#39;m a little less familiar with what is the <br/>
norm!!! We have discussed that he just do it at home for starters. The thing <br/>
is it&#39;s become such a habit, it&#39;s hard for him to remember not to do it when <br/>
we are out. Someone suggested to try and change the compulsion to another <br/>
body part, like his earlobe. He just laughed at me when I suggested that. We <br/>
are still working on a solution together. By the way, he&#39;s almost 8.<br/>
