<div id="ygrps-yiv-893449300">ROTFL at the day I&#39;ve had.  I&#39;ve labored for well over a year now to get me<br/>
to relax.  It&#39;s been an uphill battle each step of the way.  Just as I<br/>
thought I&#39;d made major progress my 10 yog brought me the days<br/>
&#39;schedule&#39;!!!!!!  Ack!  I feel like I&#39;ve gone back 5 years!<br/>
<br/>
This was no joke - she made up one of those every 15 minute schedules for<br/>
us to follow for our day while we played school!  They set me up with a<br/>
teacher&#39;s desk and all.  Moan and groan.  :o(  So I played along and worse<br/>
yet they both liked it.  My only hope is that they get really tired of me<br/>
holding them to their schedules (tomorrow&#39;s has already been brought up to<br/>
me - it is to include question asking time between subjects).<br/>
<br/>
Someone tell me this is a phase, pleaseeeeeeez.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049973594">just a thought...  did either of your kids lose summertime playmates <br/>
back to school?  perhaps this is their way of dealing with it?  they <br/>
might be having a hard time with not having them around so it&#39;s easier<br/>
to pretend they are doing similiar activities only in different <br/>
places? or maybe they are just trying to deal with their differences <br/>
from their friends in that they are homeschooled while their <br/>
friends are like everyone else and going to school?    <br/>

Lori,<br/>
LOL!  my guys have never been to school, well, I lied, oldest ds went to pre <br/>
school when he was 4yrs old.  They have been home schooled all their life, <br/>
and you know what? Up until this year, they still want to do show and tell! <br/>
That is their favorite thing to do, show off their toys.  Oldest ds is <br/>
getting over it, but even he likes to do it occasionally!  Makes them feel <br/>
good to just get up in front of everyone, (big crowed of 2! ) and talk about <br/>
their favorite thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550256095">All the playmates went back to school! I feel they try to recreate what they <br/>
must see as the fun aspects of public school. (or something!!) They do say <br/>
often that they are so glad to be homeschooled when their friends have <br/>
homework to do! lol <br/>
