I thought you might be interested to know that there are many &quot;Waldorf<br/>
Unschoolers&quot; out here in the universe!! I belong to a Waldorf Homeschooling<br/>
List and quite a few of us are also very interested in unschooling and do<br/>
our best to blend the two together. Rahima Baldwin now offers the Waldor<br/>
Homeschooling conferences on the West Coast as well and I had the<br/>
opportunity to attend last year- I highly recommend it- no matter what kind<br/>
of homeschooling you are using they have wonderful ideas to share.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like more info on the Waldorf Homeschooling List, I&#39;d be happy to<br/>
pass it on.<br/>
