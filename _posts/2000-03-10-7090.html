my son grew really fast then just stopped at around 4 months.&nbsp; he
grew but didn&#39;t gain any weight so we started feeding him and he loved
it.&nbsp; we gave him oats, rice&nbsp; and bananas and later added veggies
etc. mixed it all with breastmilk.&nbsp; he was happy and has never had
alleges.&nbsp; he&#39;s been sick a few time ( pretty much isolated to when
we&#39;ve traveled) but never for very long and not bad enough to see a dr.&nbsp;
i wouldn&#39;t recommend feeding this early but i would if your baby is hungry.&nbsp;
maybe you can take something to increase your milk - i didn&#39;t try this
but if i had it to do over again i would try this first.
<p>susun weed (from <u>wise woman herbal for childbearing years</u>) recommends:
<br>1) comfrey, raspberry leaf, nettles, alfalfa, or red clover&nbsp; these
are rich in minerals and encourage&nbsp; and increase milk flow.&nbsp;&nbsp;
she says to rotate, using each one for one week.
<br>2) apricots, asparagus, green beans, carrots, sweet potatoes, peas,
pecans, and all leafy greens such as beet greens, parsley, watercress,
and dandelion leaves are helpful.
<br>3) blessed thistle leaves (cnicus benedictus) tincture 20 drops 2-4x/day
also helps mental state
<br>4) borage leaves (borago officinalis) 1/2 c. of infusion (for leaves:
2 handfuls of cut-up leaves in 1qt jar fill w/ boiling water and steep
cover for 4 hrs) at each feeding insures an abundant supply, also works
as a laxative and soothes jangled nerves
<br>5) fennel/barley water soak 1/2c barely in 3c water over night or boil
it for 25 mins.&nbsp; pour 1c over 1tsp fennel steep no longer than 30
mins.&nbsp; increases milk, settles digestion of both mother and babe.
<br>6) hops flower this is great for twins she say it doesn&#39;t taste very
good that drink beer is a taster way.&nbsp; she also recommends a good
chemical-free and alcohol frees variety.
<br>7) a brew of 1oz blessed thistle or borage leaves (increase flow),
1oz raspberry or nettle leaves (supply of minerals &amp; vits) with 1tsp
of any one of these seeds: anise, cumin, fennel, coriander, dill (increase
production &amp; tone digestive system) - put the leaves in 1/2gal jar
cover w/boiling water, cap it and let it steep over night. strain and ref.&nbsp;
when you&#39;re ready to nurse boil 1c and pour over the seed of choice drink
after 5min or more&nbsp;&nbsp; drink freely up to 2 qts/day if desired
<p>good luck with your decision

<div id="ygrps-yiv-73725220">Melanie,<br/>
            My suggestion is to do nothing. I know it can be frustrating<br/>
having an infant that&#39;s hungry all the time, but she&#39;s still sooooo young.<br/>
I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware that starting solids too soon can have many<br/>
undesirable  effects, including allergic reactions, tummy troubles, etc. The<br/>
fact that she&#39;s so big already suggests that she&#39;s getting all she needs<br/>
from breastmilk. Starting solids now could also hinder your nursing<br/>
relationship. Don&#39;t forget, the introduction to solids is the first step to<br/>
weaning. You could consult LLL&#39;s womanly art of Breastfeeding for more<br/>
suggestions. Also, just an FYI coconuts can be a highly allergic food, so<br/>
I&#39;d definatly forego the milk idea. Good Luck.<br/>

dwindled and she wouldn&#39;t eat food, becuase she wanted to nurse and <br/>
had not made the connection that food would satisfy her hunger.  Anyhow,<br/>

find small mouthing toys (not chokable of course) that come out only at <br/>

tried to also work his sleeps around family meals so we didn&#39;t have to<br/>
engage in as much slight of hand for a month or so.  At the same time, he<br/>
would gaze longinly and with much interest at *anything* people<br/>
had....bottles of beer, shards of glass, cigarettes held by strangers....I<br/>
never assumed he was indicating he wanted those things.  For personal<br/>
reasons, we held off on solids for 18 months.  AFter about month 8 or so,<br/>
he really no longer showed much interest in eating.  And after a very slow<br/>
start at 18mos, he eats well, heartily, and enthusiastically at 4.5.<br/>

and also some cute Fisher Price Activity Bowls, and he enjoys playing with <br/>
his little bowls and spoon while watching us eat.  My son would eat dirt or <br/>
rocks or dirty diapers if given the chance, so I don&#39;t worry about the fact <br/>
that he seems to &quot;want&quot; what we are eating.  I feel it is best to hold off <br/>
solids at least until 6 months.  We are waiting a bit longer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL! IKWYM. My dd does this too. Unfortunately, I think she *does* want<br/>
them! LOL! So I&#39;m a mean mommy, but no sweetie, you can&#39;t have a<br/>
cigarette. But just because a child looks at food (however longingly)<br/>
does not mean they are truely ready for it. <br/>
<br/>
Those were good points about readiness. The child should be able to sit<br/>
up, hold their head up, and should be reaching for the food and able to<br/>
feed themselves. That doesn&#39;t mean they need to be able to use utensils,<br/>
but if they have to be spoonfed every bite, then they are probably not<br/>
ready. And if you spoonfeed them and they spit it out and turn their<br/>
heads, this is not a good photo op. This is a sign to stop! Many, many<br/>
parents think they have to teach the child to eat and keep shoveling it<br/>
in. As with unschooling :-) if they are ready, they don&#39;t have to be<br/>
&quot;taught&quot;. I started dd on solids at 6 m/o. She did not spit out and<br/>
loved every bite. However, at 7 m/o she began reaching for food and<br/>
feeding herself. In hindsight, I think this is when she was truely ready<br/>
(I know better for next time :-)<br/>
<br/>
As for children who &quot;need&quot; solids? Well no, they cannot live on<br/>
breastmilk forever. But at this young an age (up to well into the second<br/>
year for some babies) they do not need solids. Breastmilk has everything<br/>
they need - including fat for growth. It is very unlikely that a very<br/>
young baby would &quot;need&quot; solids. Perhaps if the breastfeeding<br/>
relationship is not healthy. If they are not nursing enuf or if the mom<br/>
does not have a good supply (which is extremely rare but does happen).<br/>
But if the breastfeeding relationship is healthy, there is no need for a<br/>
four month old baby to have solids. I do not mean to offend anyone who<br/>
believes their young infant did need solids this early, but before<br/>
someone starts their 4 m/o on solids I believe they should look into why<br/>
and if it&#39;s necessary. Don&#39;t just listen to your MIL or your well<br/>
meaning ped (the one who had all of 1 hour of bf classes in med school)<br/>
:-) Do some research. <br/>
<br/>
Alot of babies go thru growth spurts and slow growth periods too. It&#39;s<br/>
most common to slow down on growth around 6 m/o, but different babies<br/>
are different and can slow down earlier or later. My dd has been a slow<br/>
grower since she was born. She grows steadily, but<br/>
s...l...o...w...l...y. I was very fortunate in that our ped was a good<br/>
one. I was never told to suplement with formula as some of my friends<br/>
were. She is healthy, active, and bright. She&#39;s just small. But often<br/>
people will take slow growth as a sign to supplement with formula or<br/>
solids. If the breastfeeding relationship is a healthy one and the baby<br/>
is thriving (healthy, active, meeting milestones, gaining, however<br/>
slowly) then this is not necessary. All babies are different! Some are<br/>
petite little things like my dd, some are big bruisers. We&#39;re not all<br/>
made from the same mold. <br/>
<br/>
Also, a lot of people erroneously believe they have a low supply or that<br/>
the child &quot;needs more than breastmilk&quot; because the baby nurses &quot;too<br/>
often&quot;. There is no such thing as nursing too often. In some &quot;less<br/>
civilized&quot; cultures babies are worn and have 24/7 access to the breast<br/>
and often nurse every 15 minutes or so! Of course, in these cultures<br/>
they do not have peds telling them that the child needs solids or needs<br/>
to be on a schedule. They recognize that it is normal for a baby to eat<br/>
this often. In our society, we don&#39;t have it as &quot;easy&quot;. We have more<br/>
belongings. More things to clean (and more emphasis on keeping our stuff<br/>
clean). We have jobs. We have television shows we just can&#39;t miss. We<br/>
have visitors who want to hold the baby. All of these things and more<br/>
conspire to make us want easier, more convenient babies. And nursing<br/>
every 15 minutes is not convenient. Basically, it&#39;s not the baby who has<br/>
the &quot;problem&quot;. It&#39;s us, the parents. Nature prepares a baby for one way<br/>
of life. Society demands another. <br/>
<br/>
Getting off my fanatical breastfeeding soapbox now. <br/>
<br/>
In the end, if your child does not have allergies or stomach problems,<br/>
then no, starting them on solids early is not going to cause problems<br/>
(after that whole thing, I bet you didn&#39;t expect me to say that, did<br/>
you? :-) It is the ideal to not start them on solids til they are ready,<br/>
but while stuffing solids in before they are ready *can* cause problems<br/>
(often allergies are discovered and exacerbated this way), it *usually*<br/>
does not. I would suggest holding off until the child is truely ready<br/>
tho. You are already breastfeeding instead of ff. Holding off on solids<br/>
will just add to the good start you are giving your child. Nurse as<br/>
often as the child wants. Increase your supply if you think it&#39;s<br/>
necessary. Anyway, good luck to whoever is wrestling with this decision. <br/>

It&#39;s a crap shoot, especially prior to 6 or so months, imo.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537263181">It sounds to me as if she&#39;s not really hungry but just imitating you.  Maybe you could give her a child sized plastic spoon (not the thin plastic) to &quot;practice&quot; with.  I don&#39;t think that she would need any food with it, just the opportunity to have a spoon and practice &quot;feeding&quot; herself.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Mook never seemed interested in solids until he was six months, and<br/>
wasn&#39;t eating them regularly until almost 12 months.  He weaned himself<br/>
at 2 and almost four months.  Rachel is not even four months old, and<br/>
seems interested in eating solids - I mean she watches every spoonful I<br/>
eat, and opens her mouth and &quot;chews&quot; whener I put anything in my mouth<br/>
(or she sees anyone else eating).  She is VERY big - 75 cm and almost 10<br/>
kg.  I&#39;m kind of thinking she may need something else.  So when she<br/>
seems so anxious to eat, we feed her spoonfuls (spoonsful?)of water.  DH<br/>
suggested giving her watered down coconut milk.  I don&#39;t want to feed<br/>
her prepared baby food - fruit juices, or tomato juice, with added sugar<br/>
and/or salt, and sometimes flavoring.  With Mook, it was so easy.  He<br/>
just ate the<br/>
salt-free, sugar-free version of what we were eating (I don&#39;t use much<br/>
salt, and almost never use sugar anyway).  Suggestions?<br/>

<div><font size="2">just to stick my oar in :-)&nbsp; dd1 was bottle-fed from 1 
month, and event hough she was premmie, I still had mum telling me to get the 
baby rice etc from about 3&amp;1/2 mo, I managed to hold off until 4&amp;1/2mo, 
then spent a couple of months blending and mixing from packets until she held 
her own spoon, and got on with it.&nbsp; we gave up on bibs pretty quick, the 
food never seemed to stay on the bib, so it was just an extra thing to 
wash!&nbsp; dd2 was copying eating stuff, staring at plates etc from about 
5&amp;1/2mo, also she woke whenever we sat down to eat, like she smelled the 
food, so she often nursed at the table while I ate one-handed.&nbsp; I held off 
until she was 6&amp;1/2mo because I knew we were going on holiday and didn&#39;t 
want the faff of babyfood while we were away!&nbsp; While we were off, with my 
in-laws, she started sitting in dd1&#39;s table-seat, and looking, as my sil put it, 
like &#39;has anyone seen my waitress?&#39;&nbsp; so she got things she could hold, 
since she wouldn&#39;t be spoonfed, and didn&#39;t look back.&nbsp; She&#39;s still nursing, 
and I eagerly await the day when she decides she&#39;s had enough, I&#39;d like some 
time off before I get pregnant again &lt;g&gt;</font></div>
