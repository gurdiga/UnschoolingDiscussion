<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Faith, I once sat next to a new mom, who was holding a crying 6 month old.<br/>
She was watching her watch.  That baby needed a drink and she wouldn&#39;t<br/>
*give in to his sinful nature* by nursing him 10 minutes early.  You have no<br/>
idea the self-control I learned on that day.  Not just in keeping my hands<br/>
off of that miserable baby, I wanted to take him and nurse him myself, but<br/>
in keeping my tone of voice and body language in check.<br/>
<br/>
Baby&#39;s do not *nurse on demand*, babies let you know something is wrong by<br/>
crying.  As mom you offer all kinds of things to help. Offering to nurse is<br/>
not always about food and hunger schedules.  Sometimes it is about comfort.<br/>
A baby feels safe and warm and loved while being nursed, so that if for<br/>
whatever reason they become scared, nursing is soothing.  If we were out and<br/>
about in the wind and weather, sometimes my babies just wanted a drink, not<br/>
a meal.<br/>
<br/>
I have worked in a midwifery practice.  We were trained to spot *Ezzo*<br/>
babies.  Every local emergency room in VA went through a training class on<br/>
how to spot *Ezzo* babies, you see they were seeing hundreds of dehydrated<br/>
babies in the ER  (this was in 90-92).<br/>
<br/>
Some days I&#39;m very hungry, the first day of fall finds me fixing something<br/>
filling like stew. Other days bring other needs. If a baby is moving into a<br/>
growth spurt they will nurse 2-3 times as much as normal so as to increase<br/>
the milk supply.  Factor in your own body chemistry and you have too many<br/>
variables to be able to nurse on someone else&#39;s schedule.<br/>
<br/>
Each nursing relationship is different.  All 4 of my children nursed for<br/>
different lengths of time and in different ways.  I had one child that<br/>
nursed for nutrition for his first 18 months.  That child nursed every hour<br/>
to an hour and half.   The second son would nurse every 4 hours and<br/>
sometimes I had to ask him to nurse, as I needed him to. Neither baby was<br/>
&quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;, they were just my sons with their different needs.<br/>
<br/>
I think you are doing the right thing, listening to all kinds of theories<br/>
then picking out what works for you.  The most important thing you have been<br/>
given is your *mommy voice*, that little internal voice that tells you this<br/>
fits this baby, this works for today---or conversely, this isn&#39;t quite<br/>
right.  You are the mom and you must trust yourself first, no matter what<br/>
any method, theory or interested friend says.  If and when you feel<br/>
conflicted about something and your mommy voice is unsure, always, always,<br/>
always, choose kindness at your course of action.</div>
