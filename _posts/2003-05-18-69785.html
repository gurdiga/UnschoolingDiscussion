 </span></blockquote>but meant <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; NEVER, that was NOT the case.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s the original quote:<br/>
&quot;When she asked me if she could smoke, I told her &quot;not today, maybe <br/>
tomorrow&quot;, <br/>
when she would ask the next day &quot;is it tomorrow yet? can I smoke <br/>
now?&quot; I <br/>
would just tell her it&#39;s today, we&#39;ll talk about your smoking <br/>
tomorrow. She <br/>
soon grew tired of that conversation and took to &quot;smoking&quot; crayons.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t say &quot;mabye tomorrow&quot; and mean it genuinely.  You <br/>
said &quot;mabye tomorrow&quot; and then fooled with your daugther&#39;s mind the <br/>
next day by saying &quot;it&#39;s today, we&#39;ll talk about your smoking <br/>
tomorrow.&quot;  If your definition of &quot;tomorrow&quot; is that it never <br/>
actually comes, then yes, you did mean NEVER.  You were just hiding <br/>
the &quot;never&quot; from your daughter by taking advantage of her not-yet-<br/>
firm grasp of time.  <br/>
And I don&#39;t think that the &quot;friggin&#39; idiot&quot; comment had anything to <br/>
do with your &quot;mabye tomorrow,&quot; I think it had to do with your <br/>
implication that unschoolers were sitting fat and sassy and not <br/>
helping anyone or something like that.<br/>

You are still arguing over the same sentence.  What I think is being <br/>
put across as I have understood the posts thus far is that this is <br/>
not the best way to handle that type of situation, and others trying <br/>
to follow a truely unschooling philosophy should not percieve that as <br/>
the a good approach and model it.  I beleive that is why certain <br/>
people are continuing to argue over that point.  It does not really <br/>
matter if it was MEANT one way over another.  Readers do not want <br/>
someone to percieve it as a logical solution and use that tactic with <br/>
their children.  Personally, I would never tell my child &quot;maybe <br/>
tomorrow&quot; at that age for smoking because I would simply not allow <br/>
it.  Would you have let your daughter at THAT age smoke a cigarette?  <br/>
If not, then your answer was not fair.  If so, then we have a whole <br/>
other set of issues &lt;g&gt;!<br/>
<br/>
The more you argue over that sentence, the more this issue cannot be <br/>
laid to rest and the SAME emails will continue.  If you are insistent <br/>
that you are correct on this then just agree in your heart to <br/>
disagree and move foward.<br/>
<br/>

I am slapping myself for continuing this whole thread.  Sorry!<br/>
