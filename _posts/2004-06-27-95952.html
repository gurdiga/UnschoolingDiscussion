<div id="ygrps-yiv-73008661">I was cleaning out my backyard ornamental fountain this afternoon and found a speckly salamander in it.  We also noticed some wiggley tadpole-ish things that I think (based on internet pictures) might be salamander babies (although something I read suggested that they only hatch in the fall). Anyway, we thought we&#39;d keep some in the water that we found them in and see if they turn into anything.  According to the sites, I looked at salamander young start to develop legs in about 20 days. <br/>
<br/>
 I am sort of assuming that if I keep them in the water that I found them in, they&#39;ll have whatever food they were going to eat -- but I couldn&#39;t find anything in my searches to date that really answered that question. Any pointers from anyone who&#39;s done this before?    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158897311">You didn&#39;t state what area you are in but my daughter has kept several salamanders.  She says the food they eat can be found in ponds near where they are found.  Some eat vegetation and some eat bugs<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps your salamander could be a newt.  I know that I have found information on salamanders and newts on the internet but you&#39;ll have to search by area.  Be careful too, some newts are poisonous (not sure about salamanders); not a serious threat but have kids wash their hands after handling them.<br/>
<br/>
The rough skinned newts in our area are deadly if swallowed, not that I am concerned that the kids will swallow them but I ask them to wash.<br/>
