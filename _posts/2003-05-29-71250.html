4. Educational Superstitions of our time - Shakespeare, Maths and Handwriting<br/>
<br/>
Professor S. Bengu, The Minister of Education for South Africa, gave a keynote speech at a conference on democratic education<br/>
last May. In it explained his country&#39;s intention to move away from a bureaucrat-driven imposed curriculum towards a<br/>
learner-driven curriculum by 2005.<br/>
<br/>
The enthusiasts for imposing a curriculum on the learners are often horrified at such heresy. &quot;What if the learners do not choose<br/>
to learn Shakespeare?&quot; I always thought that Bertrand Russell gave the cool answer here, when he said: &quot;Shakespeare did not<br/>
write with a view to boring school-children; he wrote to with a view to delighting his audiences. If he does not give you<br/>
delight, you had better ignore him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I always found comfort in this view, since I admit that, despite many visits to performances at Stratford-on-Avon, I can take or<br/>
leave the bard. This does not mean I want to stand in the way of those who want to encounter Shakespeare, and for this reason, I<br/>
find that the work of John and Leela Hort in making the language of his plays intelligible, is well worth both parents and children<br/>
investigating. With their love of the bard, Leela and John have spent their time and money producing the Inessential Shakespeare<br/>
series, &#39;shortened and simplified versions in modern English&#39;, a snip at Â£2-95 each. Five plays have been translated into modern<br/>
English so far, and the sixth, Hamlet, is in preparation ready.<br/>
<br/>
The enthusiasts for imposing a curriculum on the learners are also worried by Maths. &quot;What if the learners do not choose to<br/>
learn Mathematics?&quot; Bertrand Russell, who should have a valid opinion since he was one of the world&#39;s most renowned<br/>
mathematicians himself, had this to say on the matter: &quot;In universities, mathematics is taught mainly to men who are going to<br/>
teach mathematics to men who are going to teach mathematics to ... Sometimes, it is true, there is an escape from this<br/>
treadmill. Archimedes used mathematics to kill Romans, Galileo to improve the Grand Duke of Tuscany&#39;s artillery, modern<br/>
physicists (grown more ambitious) to exterminate the human race. It is usually on this account that the study of<br/>
mathematics is commended to the general public as worthy of State support.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maths is useful, however, if you are doing something like designing bridges, but the idea that we must all go through the Maths<br/>
experience to identify those who are good at it and need it later for specific tasks, is about as sound as saying we must all study<br/>
dentistry to enable some expert dentists to emerge. When I was learning Maths at school, then teaching it in school myself, and<br/>
then watching my son learn it, the same heretical thought kept occurring, that surely there are better things we could all be doing<br/>
than this.<br/>
<br/>
It is a common error to confuse mathematics with arithmetic, and so perhaps it is the latter that should be imposed? Again, Russell<br/>
is a dissenter: &quot;Arithmetic ... is overvalued; in British elementary schools and it takes up far more of the time than it should.<br/>
He goes on to propose that there are much more useful things to learn. Russell admitted that although he was a leading<br/>
mathematician and philosopher, he was never much good at arithmetic himself.<br/>
<br/>
It is another common error to think industry has &#39;needs&#39; that can be &#39;covered&#39;. A colleague who was a Maths tutor, conducted a<br/>
survey of the &#39;needs&#39; of hundreds of firms around Birmingham. When I asked him what he had found, he said, &quot;Total confusion.&quot;<br/>
He could not find any common requirements in mathematics, and the common ground as regards arithmetic amounted to<br/>
knowledge and confidence in the four basic rules. This squares with my own experience because when I left school at 16 and<br/>
went work in a bank, my &#39;O&#39; level Maths proved to be pretty useless and I had to learn the number games of the bank on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
One home-educating family, where the father was an engineer, asked me at a conference what to do about Maths. I ran through<br/>
the arguments. They decided it was a superstition, and to have the courage to ignore it unless it cropped-up in the course of other<br/>
investigations. Later they said how pleased they were with this policy and how well it had worked out in practice. But then, with<br/>
CD-ROM interactive discs now available that will teach you &#39;O&#39; level Maths in a quarter or less of the time of a taught course, you<br/>
can take the subject on board whenever you wish.<br/>
<br/>
If I believed in compelling people to learn things, which I no longer do since I advocate the learner-driven/catalogue curriculum<br/>
approach instead, I could make out a much better case for teaching Logic which is usually missing from the curriculum altogether.<br/>
But it was Paul Goodman, in a book that shocked people in 1962 entitled Compulsory Mis-education, who described mass<br/>
schooling, including its imposed mathematics, as a mass superstition.<br/>
<br/>
The enthusiasts for imposing a curriculum on the learners are also worried by joined-up handwriting. &quot;What if the learners do not<br/>
choose to learn joined-up handwriting?&quot; I must admit to being much more worried if they do not develop the skills of joined-up<br/>
thinking that learning logic encourages, but that is another issue. Perhaps more pain is inflicted on children in the joined-up<br/>
handwriting pursuit than any other. Yet printers print in script because it is clearer. Natural Parent would be hard work to read if<br/>
it were presented in handwriting<br/>
<br/>
Nobody shows much enthusiasm for joined-up figures in sums either, and would see anyone as a bit odd for suggesting it. John<br/>
Holt in his investigations could find no reasons on offer except a claim that joined-up handwriting was speedier. He showed that<br/>
this usually was a fallacy by conducting a number of classroom experiments and by experimenting on himself. Usually, script was<br/>
as quick or often quicker, more legible and looked better. Those who chose to learn Italic script produced very attractive results.<br/>
<br/>
In discussion recently, one handwriting enthusiast told me that the body movements used in the teaching of it were essential for the<br/>
composed development of children. This was her justification for teaching handwriting. If this is so, why not teach the body<br/>
movements on their own without the clutter?<br/>
<br/>
The enthusiasts for imposing learning on children in school do not have a good track record. There were earlier superstitions. For a<br/>
time they tried to make all left-handed children become right-handed, with a heavy punishment regime. Drill was imposed as a<br/>
subject on all children for many years. Children in Welsh-speaking areas of Wales were punished if they did not speak in English in<br/>
school. Later compulsory Welsh appeared in English-speaking parts of Wales and I have met adults who resented this being<br/>
enforced on them as children. And so on.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the task of &#39;parents as researchers&#39; that I advocated in a previous edition of Natural Parent, is to be on the look-out for<br/>
learning systems based on possible superstitions and get equipped to answer them and deal with them. In later editions I intend to<br/>
analyse two big superstitions - &#39;socialisation&#39;, and then &#39;subjects&#39;.<br/>

 A version of this piece was published in Natural Parent in April 1998, as the Roland Meighan column, entitled &#39;The three<br/>
                                             myths&#39;.<br/>

Great article!  Thanks!<br/>

I&#39;d like to be able to send it on to others.  Someone just got all crazy <br/>
defensive on the message board at unschooling.com about teaching cursive <br/>
handwriting, but I&#39;m not sure she would be patient enough to tranlate joined-up as <br/>
cursive and really THINK about it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never really understood this obsession with cursive. When Heather was in school they strated teaching it at 7 and her writing went from legible to illegible overnight. My boys, who spent much less<br/>
time in school have legible writing. Heather still hasn&#39;t thrown of school-thinking (even after 3 years at home) and I can barely read her writing.<br/>
As for *teaching* writing....arm soapbox...soapbox armed....that really bugs me. I&#39;ve watched people here, and in school, *making* their kids write and watched the tears and tantrums and the child&#39;s<br/>
love of exploring squiggles and writing evaporate. Yet the people doing it don&#39;t want to listen, they are following some external agenda of what kids *should* be doing at a certain age, always with a<br/>
competative eye on other people&#39;s kids and they fail to see what coercian is doing to their children. Grrrrrrrrrrrr<br/>
Anyone want to join me up here on the soapbox?<br/>
