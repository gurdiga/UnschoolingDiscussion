       I could really relate to your post.  My 11yo dd also had a very <br/>
traumatic 4th grade year in public school.  That is the year I took her out <br/>
and sent her to a very &quot;unschooling&quot; type school.  It was a really great <br/>
school, but just not right for her.  She is very similar to your middle child <br/>
in that she is such a homebody, has friends but is fine even if they are not <br/>
around, and she is extremely stubborn.  I am very happy to be hsing her <br/>
because I am also learning things that really interest me!  We both love <br/>
doing nature journals and we both hate doing workbooks!  Even though she is a <br/>
capable reader, she loves to be read to. I read all the Harry Potter books to <br/>
her and we had such fun together  trying to guess what was going to happen <br/>
next.  To me, the really wonderful thing about hsing, is I get to enjoy my dd <br/>
every day - I&#39;m not missing out on half her life due to school and homework.  <br/>
