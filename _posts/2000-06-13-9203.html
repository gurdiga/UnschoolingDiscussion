  How&#39;s the trip going?  Is she having a great time?<br/>

&lt; My 20-year-old dd, home/unschooled since the &quot;6th grade&quot;, is getting ready to take off on a travel adventure.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s not leaving until Wednesday morning. Gulp. She decided to take a bus all the way across country to save some money, then she&#39;ll start the Amtrak portion of the trip after staying with a friend in Eugene, OR, for a couple weeks.<br/>
<br/>
She got her hostel card today and bought a neat little bag to keep things in. Also dyed her hair red (really a dark auburn). She&#39;s alternately excited and kinda irritable--a little nervous, I suspect, but still gung ho.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I remembered who used to send out The Barrage--it was Inknote! I wonder if she&#39;s still around....<br/>
