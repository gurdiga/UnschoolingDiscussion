<br/>
&gt; But if I said, &quot;Well, the first thing you need to do is stop trying to<br/>
&gt; make them eat vanilla.&quot; that has an entirely different tone. I think it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; truth, but it doesn&#39;t allow the personal respect and freedom. And as the<br/>
&gt; counselors say, it&#39;s about using more *I* statements and less *you*<br/>
&gt; statements.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a fan of Dr. Phil McGraw, who is most famous for his appearances on<br/>
Oprah, but has done a lot of other really cool things.<br/>
<br/>
Oprah calls Phil&#39;s style &quot;Tell it like it is&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I remember one story of his of how he was REALLY bad as a marriage<br/>
counselor, because a couple would come in, each would talk for awhile, Dr.<br/>
Phil would say, &quot;Okay, here&#39;s what you can do&quot; and offer a reasonable<br/>
solution based on action.<br/>
<br/>
The couples didn&#39;t like this. They wanted to spend years with Phil couching<br/>
things nicely and talking about their feelings instead of their actions.<br/>
<br/>
I like it when people tell me like it is. If I disagree with them on that, I<br/>
am free to ignore their advice. NOBODY here is following anybody else home<br/>
and making sure they do as they&#39;re told.<br/>
<br/>
Take or leave what you read, here or anywhere. I find advice that is NOT<br/>
tell it like it is very annoying to me personally. Sweet and wimpy just<br/>
doesn&#39;t do it for me. So what? I need to deal with that irritant on my own<br/>
-- I am still free to take the advice or leave it, nor is it up to me to<br/>
tell someone they should be more direct.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really enjoy Doctor Phil, but my good friend feels aching empathy for the<br/>
people he is advising.  She thinks that they are (sometimes) humiliated by the<br/>
advice and she thinks it&#39;s rude and wrong for him to give advice that way.<br/>
(But it&#39;s true that they asked for advice and consented to receive it<br/>
publicly.)<br/>
<br/>
My theory about advice is that it&#39;s &quot;better&quot; to give people information and let<br/>
them draw their own conclusions.  People tend to prefer conclusions that they<br/>
have reached in their own minds and tend to reject conclusions that seem pushed<br/>
at them, by-passing the personal mental processing stage.  Now, admitedly,<br/>
people in my family are of the stubborn, nose-cutting-off-to-spite-face<br/>
persuasion.  (Which may come from insecurity and fear of being dominated.)  So<br/>
my sample may be non-representative of the population as a whole.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Nance --<br/>
<br/>
This is not personally aimed at you, but I got the idea when reading your<br/>
post.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been wondering if the difference in how people feel about<br/>
confrontation and blunt advice has to do with how much any person values<br/>
group harmony and feels pressure (or impulses) to accomodate others. <br/>
I&#39;m sure that people vary on this characteristic and am not sure if it<br/>
is cultural (as in Japan) or genetic (coming from brain chemistry).<br/>
<br/>
I know people vary in this quality.  I suspect there are both cultural<br/>
and genetic components in how accomodating and harmonious people are<br/>
inclined to be.  I&#39;m one of the &quot;to hell with harmony, I enjoy<br/>
disonnance and dissent because it stimulates my brain&quot; people.  (Well...<br/>
not at parties....)  But I know that humans evolved to be tribal and to<br/>
bond and cooperate with each other in profound ways.  So I know that<br/>
group harmony has a place, but it&#39;s just not something that I really<br/>
&quot;get&quot; on a gut level.  &quot;What would the neighbors think?&quot; is not<br/>
something that I spend any time on.<br/>
<br/>
(That last sentence does not mean that I think other people are wrong if<br/>
they consider what their neighbors think.  Just different from me.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think this is true for a lot of people -- why diets fail and people fall <br/>
off the wagon and girls marry the guy nobody approves of, etc.  Some of us <br/>
just have to go thru things and make mistakes and figure it out for ourselves <br/>
to learn.  You can lead a horse to water and all that.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is the rebellion factor -- just this AM I had a good example of <br/>
that in myself.  DH had a perfectly fine suggestion about trimming a tree I <br/>
am battling in the backyard.   &quot;If you put the ladder here, then cut the <br/>
branches, they will fall that way and not hit this and it will work better.&quot;  <br/>
I immediately balked!!  &quot;How dare he tell me how to trim a gosh darn tree??  <br/>
I&#39;m a grown woman.  I think I know how to trim a tree after all. Harumph!&quot;  <br/>
Then I realized he was right.  <br/>
<br/>
But there was that immediate reaction to resist being told how to do <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
Not always a bad thing but not always a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the tree is looking much smaller now -- about 1/2 done!<br/>

<br/>
I agree that there do seem to be these different types of personalities.  <br/>
Nature vs. nurture -- who the heck knows?<br/>
<br/>
Good question though!!<br/>

I&#39;d be perfectly happy to live as a hermit, do not give a dead or alive<br/>
rat&#39;s patooty what other folks think, don&#39;t care one way or another about<br/>
group harmony but, as the kidlets inform, I become instant momma grizzly if<br/>
I see someone berating or unnecessarily &quot;harming&quot; another person in any way,<br/>
shape or form.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, take Dr. Phil (please &lt;g&gt;) for example.  He spends a few minutes<br/>
behind the scenes interviewing folks.  Now, if you have ever been on<br/>
television or in front of a large group, particularly for the first time,<br/>
lots of folks suddenly find that it isn&#39;t quite what they expected.  But he<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to take this into consideration and back off or temper his<br/>
rampage to fit the individual.<br/>
<br/>
I watched one poor woman literally squirm and turn beat red and the more she<br/>
tried to explain her own individual situation, the more he &quot;attacked&quot; her.<br/>
She was embarassed and frequently when embarassed, folks aren&#39;t as<br/>
articulate as they would be if they didn&#39;t know a million people would be<br/>
watching them.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I just wanted to shake him and say, &quot;Hey, slow down and treat<br/>
this woman with a little respect and get off your high horse.&quot;  I mean, he<br/>
is supposedly a professional, so shouldn&#39;t he be able to discern the<br/>
difference between someone who can take his in your face style and someone<br/>
who can&#39;t and adjust accordingly???<br/>
<br/>
There is &quot;telling it like it is&quot; and there is verbal abuse.  he frequently<br/>
crosses the line, IMNSHO &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So, was I clear as mud again????<br/>
