My son has a computer that my husband built with great video and memory cards.  We don&#39;t have any of the game systems. I wouldn&#39;t be against getting one.  I just don&#39;t know much about them...and I haven&#39;t a clue which one would best suit his needs.  Which system has the most RPG games?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for your help,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994071481">Thanks to all who gave me ideas for on-line RPGs that my dh and ds could <br/>
try.  They are planning to try Runescape soon, but for now have all decided <br/>
to work together in RO.  Ds John figured it was good to have people he knows <br/>
helping him along, so the three of them are now all playing it.<br/>
