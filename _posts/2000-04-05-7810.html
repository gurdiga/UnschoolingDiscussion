<div><font size="2">Just to clarify, I&#39;m not a LLL Leader yet :-)&nbsp; I need to 
make this clear, as any counsellor-type will know, so that no-one thinks I talk 
about breastfeeding on&nbsp;LLL&#39;s behalf, yet.&nbsp; But I too groaned when I 
read this post, not only because of its inflamatorry nature, but because this is 
exactly the kind of superiority complex which puts some people off 
breastfeeding.&nbsp; Breastfeeding is natural.&nbsp; Breastmilk is what babies&#39; 
sytems are designed to deal with.&nbsp; That does not mean that bottlefeeding, 
&#39;with safety and love&#39; as Bill and Martha Sears&#39; Baby Book says, cannot meet the 
needs of babies who cannot be breastfed.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">I think Stephanie&#39;s husband would read this message and be 
more put off.&nbsp; It would be more helpful for him to talk to other fathers 
who support their partner&#39;s feeding choices.&nbsp; My dh said, when asked how 
many times dd2 woke in the night, &#39;I don&#39;t know,&#39; I don&#39;t wake up.&#39;&nbsp; A 
major benefit for the co-sleeping, breastfeeding father!!</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">Dogmatics and rants don&#39;t change people&#39;s minds, nor can they 
change the fact that some people physically can&#39;t breastfeed.&nbsp; There&#39;s 
enough aggro in the world without adding to it.</font></div>

  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sulan@...">sulan@...</a> <br>writes:<br><br>&lt;&lt; 
  It is absolutely the most superior wonder food in existence<br>on the planet 
  and no informed person could possibly deny that for their<br>child. 
  &gt;&gt;<br><br>OK - this is what I was talking about.&nbsp; Tracy (a LLL 
  leader, and a firm <br>believer in the benefits of breastfeeding) emailed me 
  off list and asked <br>about my reasons for feeding my children the way I 
  do.&nbsp; She presented her <br>question in a respectful, adult fashion.&nbsp; 
  Because of her attitude I was happy <br>to respond to her.&nbsp; This, on the 
  other hand, is nothing but inflammatory.&nbsp;&nbsp;
