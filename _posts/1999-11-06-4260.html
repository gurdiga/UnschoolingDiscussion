<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282826657">&lt;&lt;What I wanted to say, is that I want to teach my girls the formula for the<br/>
<br/>
five paragraph essay. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I could guess this one if I thought about it for awhile, but could <br/>
you tell us what the five paragraph essay is?  Where did the formula come <br/>
from?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
