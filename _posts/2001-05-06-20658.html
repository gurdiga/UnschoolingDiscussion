<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426597513">Gently guide toddler out of the street.  Find something more fun for the<br/>
toddler to do.<br/>
Pick a quiet, slow street, a cul-de-sac, maybe, and explore the street<br/>
together.  Talk a lot about road safety.<br/>
Buy a book about road safety that toddler might like.<br/>
Take an object out into the middle of the road, and hold toddler while<br/>
someone else drives over the object.  Show toddler what happens to an<br/>
object when it is smashed by a moving car.<br/>
Take toddler to the amusement park where he or she can ride in a pretend<br/>
car.<br/>
Buy some play cars and pretend people, set up a road, and act out road<br/>
scenarios.<br/>
Use a lot of genuine praise.<br/>
Make a promise to yourself to be honest about road safety (i.e. don&#39;t<br/>
tell toddler the road is too dangerous when there hasn&#39;t been a car in<br/>
an hour).  Use that quiet time to experiment with various ways to cross<br/>
the street.<br/>
When toddler is near a road, give your full attention to the toddler so<br/>
toddler is never in danger.<br/>
Just to get you started...<br/>
