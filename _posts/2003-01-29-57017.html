Some might want to check out an already well established (founded in <br/>
1948) travel network for individuals and families, Servas.  For only <br/>
$75 a year registration per adult member travelers stay in each <br/>
registered host home for a two night stay free.  In some cases hosts <br/>
invite travelers to stay longer.  Travelers rent lists of hosts for <br/>
travel all over the world, in more than 130 countries.  Domestic <br/>
travelers who also register as hosts pay only $20 per adult traveler <br/>
registration.  And low income families and individuals pay only $10 <br/>
per year.  <br/>
<br/>
We have been involved in this program for 20 years as both hosts and <br/>
travelers and absolutely love it.  We just spent 8 days in the <br/>
greater Washington, D. C., area staying with four different hosts.  A <br/>
great way to travel, meet neat people, make new friends, learn and <br/>
see more, too, because the hosts always tell you about neat stuff you <br/>
might never have known about otherwise.  Check it out at:  <br/>
