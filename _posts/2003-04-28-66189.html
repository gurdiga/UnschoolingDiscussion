<div id="ygrps-yiv-100516720">Here is an article about mold in Florida schools.  Although it <br/>
discusses southern Florida, I thought it generally showed the <br/>
bureaucracy of school distrcits and where children fit in their <br/>
agenda.  I tried to put in the link but it would not work so here is <br/>
the article, kind of long but hopefully worthwhile:<br/>

Toxic Schools<br/>
<br/>
By Trish Riley<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mold problems are widespread in humid South Florida -- affecting the <br/>
health of teachers and students, while school boards throughout the <br/>
region lag in solving the problem. <br/>
<br/>
One South Florida teacher spent a year working in a damp classroom, <br/>
well aware that mold was growing in the corners and ceiling and <br/>
clinging to the walls. She filed complaints and documented incidents <br/>
and responses. She developed a cold, a yeast infection, a virus, a <br/>
respiratory illness. She was treated for allergies. She became so <br/>
tired she couldn&#39;t do anything but sleep when she was off work. She <br/>
got what they call &quot;foggy brain syndrome&quot; -- she just couldn&#39;t <br/>
concentrate on things long enough to solve them. There were <br/>
indications of lupus. Finally her doctor told her she just couldn&#39;t <br/>
go back to that moldy room -- it was ruining her health. Afraid to <br/>
jeopardize her court-won pension and insurance settlement, she can&#39;t <br/>
reveal her identity, but she&#39;s now on permanent disability. Although <br/>
her health has improved since getting out of the moldy classroom, she <br/>
experiences recurrences whenever she encounters any molds, chemicals, <br/>
stress or even average physical exertion. <br/>
<br/>
Her reaction was severe, but it demonstrates what long-term exposure <br/>
to mold can do. Some people take longer to react to toxins in their <br/>
environment than others, but it is not uncommon for immune systems to <br/>
lose resistance to constant attacks. Children with immature systems <br/>
and those already disabled with asthma and allergies are at <br/>
particular risk. <br/>
<br/>
Assessing the risk <br/>
<br/>
If your child is in school, there&#39;s at least some possibility of <br/>
daily exposure to mold and mildew. Some studies estimate that half <br/>
the public schools in this country have unsatisfactory air quality <br/>
issues -- and in humid South Florida, the incidence of mold in <br/>
schools is potentially even higher. The exposure can cause serious <br/>
health problems. <br/>
<br/>
Jonathan Lawson, a sixth-grader at Western Pines Middle School in <br/>
Royal Palm Beach, had to leave his classroom 14 times over the first <br/>
20 days of school, calling home and telling his mother he couldn&#39;t <br/>
breathe. &quot;He tells me, &#39;It feels like someone&#39;s sitting on my chest --<br/>
 I can&#39;t take it anymore,&#39;&quot; says his mother, Cynthia Lawson. &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
very frustrated. He&#39;s having such a hard time with his grades. It was <br/>
the same last year at Golden Globe Elementary next door. The nurses <br/>
saved Jonathan on more than one occasion.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Problems like these are widespread in South Florida, and although <br/>
school officials seem now to be addressing the problem, progress is <br/>
slow. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Schools have mold for a variety of reasons,&quot; says Chris Skerlec, <br/>
environmental control officer for Palm Beach County Schools, whose <br/>
office investigates about 300 indoor air quality complaints a <br/>
year. &quot;Mold spores are everywhere. You cannot prevent them,&quot; he says. <br/>
However, &quot;you can keep the humidity low, keep the place dry and <br/>
clean. You can cure 95 percent of your air quality issues. It&#39;s not <br/>
rocket science.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Maybe not, but it is expensive science. For example, 24 Palm Beach <br/>
County schools were found to have a faulty air conditioning system <br/>
designed by W.R. Frizzell. The firm filed bankruptcy before the <br/>
school board could collect a judgment, so the school received only <br/>
$450,000 in restitution. The Palm Beach Post reported that repairs on <br/>
only ten of the affected schools were estimated to cost $20 million. <br/>
Those funds were set aside, according to school board members, but <br/>
only three of the 10 schools were fixed, with two more scheduled to <br/>
be fixed this year. <br/>
<br/>
A preliminary report to the Broward School Board suggests a potential <br/>
cost of $2.5 billion to renovate schools with a variety of <br/>
maintenance problems, including mold abatement. A capital improvement <br/>
plan from 1998 committed $44 million to clean up mold problems in 155 <br/>
schools over a five-year period, but an internal audit pointed up <br/>
problems with meeting the plans goals last year. <br/>
<br/>
Jeff Moquin, director of risk management for the Broward School <br/>
Board, says that he deals with mold and moisture issues in the <br/>
schools daily. &quot;We have water intrusion through leaks or humidity <br/>
issues with the HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) <br/>
systems. Some of these issues require design time, bidding the job <br/>
out to a contractor and time to complete the work, and some of the <br/>
money only became available this year. (Of those identified in the <br/>
1998 plan), we have 10 to 12 schools 100 percent complete, with 90 <br/>
schools three-quarters done. Some are in the design phase, others are <br/>
in construction.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
In Miami-Dade, &quot;We&#39;re looking at correcting mold situations at <br/>
approximately 15 schools,&quot; says John Schuster, spokesperson for Miami-<br/>
Dade Public Schools. &quot;It&#39;s a range of things that need to be <br/>
corrected. We find a lot of situations arise because we&#39;re dealing <br/>
with older buildings that may have older AC systems and/or water <br/>
intrusion. It may be something as simple as replacing ceiling tiles <br/>
to having to arrange a water seal for an entire roof.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
But involved Miami-Dade parents and teachers say the board is not <br/>
doing nearly enough to keep the school buildings maintained. &quot;The <br/>
Miami-Dade public school district has squandered hundreds of millions <br/>
of public dollars intended for school construction and maintenance. <br/>
Meanwhile, it has grossly neglected the condition of virtually all of <br/>
its school facilities,&quot; says Surfside Mayor Paul Novack, who has been <br/>
appointed to a state committee assigned to oversee Miami-Dade <br/>
schools. <br/>
<br/>
FIGHTING THE FIGHT <br/>
<br/>
The Florida weather -- damp, hot and humid -- doesn&#39;t help. Mold will <br/>
grow here, just as it has always grown here. There are at least 1,000 <br/>
types of fungus commonly found in North American buildings, and 200 <br/>
are known to be harmful to humans. While it&#39;s unlikely that the crud <br/>
in your shower is harmful, exposure to certain mold strains can cause <br/>
allergic reactions and illness in some people, including those who <br/>
develop sensitivity after long-term exposure, such as teachers. <br/>
<br/>
Dr. Herbert Moselle, an allergist in Plantation for the past 34 <br/>
years, says there have always been mold problems, no worse today than <br/>
they ever were. &quot;I always have teachers -- a minimum of 10 a week <br/>
come through this office,&quot; he says. Patients are first advised to <br/>
eliminate their exposure to the allergen. The next line of treatment <br/>
is with antihistamines and similar products, finally immunotherapy -- <br/>
shots administered weekly over a long period of time. But to treat <br/>
for molds, doctors must identify the cause. If parents aren&#39;t aware <br/>
there&#39;s a mold problem at school, it may take longer to determine <br/>
what&#39;s causing their child&#39;s allergic symptoms. <br/>
<br/>
Mary MacFie spent years taking her daughter Heather to specialists -- <br/>
even as far away as New York -- but none were able to diagnose her <br/>
vomiting, her migraines, her face so swollen she couldn&#39;t see. <br/>
Heather&#39;s teachers suggested that her parents come talk to them, but <br/>
MacFie thought there was no point: Doctors hadn&#39;t figured out what <br/>
was wrong with her daughter, what could they know? Finally a teacher <br/>
took her aside and told her that many of the teachers at the school, <br/>
the Western High Annex in Sunrise, were sick with the same symptoms. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mold, they told me. I said, &#39;What are you talking about? Spray it <br/>
with bleach, call the health department, call OSHA.&#39; &#39;We have,&#39; they <br/>
said. &#39;It doesn&#39;t do any good,&#39;&quot; MacFie says. <br/>
<br/>
Teachers can be confined to the same classroom all day long for years <br/>
on end. Even though their health is affected, many are reluctant to <br/>
speak up. <br/>
<br/>
One way to break through a bureaucratic wall is the American way, <br/>
with lawsuits. Fort Lauderdale attorney Bob McKee represents 32 <br/>
students and teachers across Palm Beach and Broward counties. &quot;I get <br/>
100 calls a month, but I can only take on a few more cases each <br/>
month. I think the way to represent is in a group suit,&quot; McKee says. <br/>
<br/>
John Countryman, assistant state attorney for Broward County, has <br/>
interviewed more than 100 teachers and parents affected by mold in <br/>
their schools in preparation of a report to be presented to a grand <br/>
jury for review this spring. A grand jury review of school <br/>
construction in 1997 revealed an unsavory picture of funds wasted on <br/>
inferior construction. <br/>
<br/>
Rapid overdevelopment throughout South Florida called for quick <br/>
schools. Tight budgets led to faulty design and shoddy work. In Palm <br/>
Beach County, several schools&#39; mildew problems have been linked to a <br/>
contractor that was fired from the job. In Broward, architect Donald <br/>
Singer was held to blame for poor design of nine schools, and <br/>
ultimately paid a settlement of $750,000. Architectural firm Miller, <br/>
Meier, Kenyon and Cooper was responsible for the faulty design of <br/>
another five Broward schools, but has gone out of business. In Miami-<br/>
Dade, the list of contractor failures is embarrassingly long. &quot;Over <br/>
the last 19 years we&#39;ve spent $6 billion on facilities alone,&quot; Novack <br/>
says, &quot;yet the public has very little to show for that investment.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Across all three counties, cleanup efforts have been piecemeal at <br/>
best. The ceiling at Western High looks like a checkerboard of tiles <br/>
of various ages, styles and colors because when mold got into the <br/>
ceiling, tiles were replaced one at a time. But since mold spores are <br/>
airborne and attach themselves to any organic material, including <br/>
wood, paper, fabric and carpets, this has proven an ineffective means <br/>
of eradicating the problem. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;We had mushrooms growing on the floors from the moisture seeping <br/>
up,&quot; says Dick Keen of his portable classroom at the Western <br/>
Annex. &quot;My throat swelled up, lymph glands were hurting and I was <br/>
missing a lot of school. I went to the allergist and he told me it <br/>
was mold, no doubt about it. Finally my floor got so weak a student <br/>
stepped right through it. When they pulled it up there was a half-<br/>
inch of this gelatinous slime. They replaced it in pieces, and with <br/>
the same wood. The worst thing is they&#39;re thinking about putting kids <br/>
back in those portables.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
SOLUTIONS <br/>
<br/>
Palm Beach County school officials say they&#39;re dealing with problems <br/>
as they find them, although they are reluctant to admit any real <br/>
problems exist. &quot;We did find mold present at Banyan Elementary School <br/>
three years ago and replaced the air conditioning system. Since then <br/>
we have looked at all of our other schools with similar air <br/>
conditioning systems, but have not found any other problems,&quot; says <br/>
spokesman Nat Harrington. Meanwhile, Cynthia Lawson is left to wonder <br/>
why her son can&#39;t breathe at the Royal Palm school he attends. <br/>
<br/>
The board has partnered with the American Lung Association in its <br/>
Asthma Free Schools project, providing air-quality training to staff <br/>
at 20 schools last year and 20 more this year. &quot;The schools are doing <br/>
what they can,&quot; says Cindy Vallo, with the American Lung Association <br/>
of Southeast Florida. &quot;The key is to prevent mold by keeping things <br/>
clean and dry. If you&#39;ve got a leak, fix it and make sure it&#39;s dried <br/>
within 24 hours.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The Broward School Board, under pressure from the state attorney&#39;s <br/>
office, is developing another maintenance, repair and construction <br/>
plan that includes mold and mildew remediation throughout the <br/>
district. A new bidding prequalification process helps to eliminate <br/>
incapable construction companies, and new schools have been designed <br/>
with mold and mildew prevention in mind. Open breezeways and <br/>
classroom windows provide better ventilation and most floors are <br/>
tiled rather than carpeted. Thermostats are monitored and teams work <br/>
full-time maintaining heating and air conditioning ventilation <br/>
systems. Broward Superintendent Frank Till recently announced a plan <br/>
to hire an administrator who will be responsible for addressing mold <br/>
issues. Some view the move with relief; others see it as another <br/>
stalling tactic that will delay progress. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Many existing schools are in need of substantial repairs, and the <br/>
longer it takes, the greater the cost,&quot; says Assistant State Attorney <br/>
Countryman. &quot;A huge percentage of our taxes goes toward our schools, <br/>
and I don&#39;t think most people begrudge that. The question is how it&#39;s <br/>
being spent.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Similarly, in Miami-Dade County, teachers and parents charge that an <br/>
unresponsive board has left schools to deteriorate year after <br/>
year. &quot;Many school districts just don&#39;t have the money, but here in <br/>
Miami-Dade County that&#39;s not the problem at all. There are billions <br/>
of dollars flowing every year. They just can&#39;t seem to produce <br/>
results with that money,&quot; Novack says. &quot;The only questions the policy <br/>
makers are considering are: Do they fix it or do they continue to <br/>
ignore it? That&#39;s not a choice. You must fix these buildings that are <br/>
occupied by thousands of students every day.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The Miami-Dade school safety department offers principals a checklist <br/>
to help them deal effectively with mold problems. Several principals -<br/>
- including Jeanne Friedman, principal at Miami Beach Senior High <br/>
where Novack&#39;s son attends school -- said the department responded <br/>
quickly to mold issues at their schools. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The school districts have become experts at shunning parents away <br/>
and discouraging their calls for improvement,&quot; says Novack, who has <br/>
collected a scrapbook of photos of mold problems in several <br/>
schools. &quot;The district has been operating in the dark for years, and <br/>
they&#39;ve been actively avoiding letting the public know what&#39;s going <br/>
on.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The only real solution, says Dr. Moselle, is to tear down infected <br/>
buildings and rebuild mold-resistant structures. &quot;We have to spend <br/>
the money up front and do preventive work, then we won&#39;t have to keep <br/>
tearing down schools and redoing them, and spending on medical care.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Mary MacFie has worked with School Board members and others in the <br/>
community to organize workshops to help inform parents about the <br/>
dangers of mold and symptoms to watch for. Her daughter Heather, now <br/>
15, has moved on to Cypress Bay High in Weston, a new school built <br/>
with mold prevention in mind. Her health is much improved now, but <br/>
MacFie doesn&#39;t rest. School administrators are on notice that her <br/>
daughter may not be placed in a portable classroom. A grove of them <br/>
stands next to the school ready to absorb the impending overflow. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;They&#39;re swearing to me that my daughter won&#39;t be put into a <br/>
portable, but what about everybody else? Should I shut up when other <br/>
people might be sick? I have people mad at me because I won&#39;t stop <br/>
talking about mold,&quot; she says. &quot;But I don&#39;t know how to make people <br/>
realize how serious this really is. The children&#39;s health is at risk, <br/>
and the teachers&#39; health is at risk.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
THE CALL TO ACTION <br/>
<br/>
It is clear that parents and other concerned citizens must join the <br/>
effort to clean up our schools. &quot;I wish we had parental involvement,&quot; <br/>
says West Kendall media specialist Karen Sick, &quot;because once the <br/>
parents start screaming, the district starts listening.&quot; Part of the <br/>
problem, she says, is that parents don&#39;t realize there are health <br/>
problems at the school. &quot;A parent walking into our school wouldn&#39;t <br/>
see the health problems that the teachers are having. Their kids <br/>
might come home with symptoms but they think it&#39;s the flu or <br/>
allergies.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Paul Novack agrees. &quot;Let the public know we don&#39;t have to accept the <br/>
status quo -- if they can&#39;t provide a safe and secure environment for <br/>
our children, we are not helpless to change things. What&#39;s most <br/>
important is the well-being and education of our community&#39;s <br/>
children.&quot; <br/>
