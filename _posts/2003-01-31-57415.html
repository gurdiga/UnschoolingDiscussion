depending on what state their mind is in when they sit down to watch any<br/>
given show. When a child (or adult for that matter) is watching<br/>
television to relax, I don&#39;t think their brain is registering all it sees<br/>
and hears, leaving them more susceptible to subliminal messages and mind<br/>
control. When the television is used as a resource, the brain is focused,<br/>
absorbing all it sees and hears, searching for the desired information or<br/>
effect. When my children watch TV throughout the day (usually videos)<br/>
they can interact, or learn or just plain enjoy a show. But if I sit them<br/>
down to watch a show while I&#39;m making dinner or something (the electronic<br/>
babysitter) they will get in a zombie like state where they can&#39;t even<br/>
hear you calling them. And when the show is over, they don&#39;t have a clue<br/>
as to what they even saw. Pretty scary, and needless to say, I don&#39;t<br/>
encourage this kind of TV viewing. I think it is the same with adults.<br/>
I&#39;ve watched movies when I was tired and relaxed, and then I have watched<br/>
the same movie intently when I was alert and interested. I came away with<br/>
two entirely different *feelings* after each time. I don&#39;t know exactly<br/>
scientifically why, but I don&#39;t think it is an accident. <br/>
