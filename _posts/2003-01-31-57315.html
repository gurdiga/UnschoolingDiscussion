 </span></blockquote>They have to be cut out. Theoretically in the first week you can get them out as they are just tangled hair, not proper matted dreads but because wax is used it has too be washed off with very hot water<br/>
and then the hair untangled its very hard and time consuming.<br/>
She wants short Sinead O&#39;Connor style at some point so if she goes off the dreads then no probs.<br/>
I had pangs about her beautiful long hair but its her hair, not mine.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I had pangs about her beautiful long hair but its her hair, not mine. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had to learn this the hard way. My dd asked for me to cut off her hair, I <br/>
put her off... &quot;wait until you&#39;re a bit older&quot; hoping she would change her <br/>
mind.<br/>
One night while I was at  work, she saw her opportunity. I came home to her <br/>
beautiful long hair in several differnent chunky lengths due to her very <br/>
unique cutting process!!<br/>
We had to get it cut up to her ear lobes to even it out.<br/>
Now she is sad it isn&#39;t longer. <br/>
But it was a good learning experience for us both!<br/>
I hadn&#39;t taken her seriously becuase she wasn&#39;t very persistent about the <br/>
hair cut.<br/>
But when she asks to get her hair cut next time, you can bet I will be <br/>
booking an appoinment. duh.<br/>
