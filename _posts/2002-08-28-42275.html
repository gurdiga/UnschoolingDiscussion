&gt; Can you tell us more about that book?<br/>

&gt; The book is about a girl who is a dwarf. She grows up in a small somewhat <br/>

discipline by example) and a close knit village. As she grows up, the <br/>
barbarity of the Third Reich encroaches and with that encroachment the <br/>
innocence of the village is slowly eroded away. The majority of the villagers <br/>
are devout Christians (Catholics I think---can&#39;t remember, they could be <br/>
Lutherans). They are by and large a very moral group. We see how the <br/>
individuals respond and are changed by the evil of the Nazi&#39;s. We also follow <br/>
the girl and her very personal struggles. It&#39;s a good example I think of <br/>
people who are in a time and place where popular opinion reigns supreme, and <br/>
those with true moral fiber ask of themselves, &quot;Should we?&quot;<br/>
