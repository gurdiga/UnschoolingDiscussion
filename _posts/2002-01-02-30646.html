 </span></blockquote>Hi Susan,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know where you live, which does determine a lot about the expense <br/>
and availability of organics.<br/>
<br/>
With a family of six it *can* get expensive, so don&#39;t opt to go to your <br/>
local health food store expecting to do the weekly shopping without <br/>
running up an astronomical food bill. <br/>
<br/>
There ARE ways to make it work. Don&#39;t despair.<br/>
<br/>
Most communities have some sort of &#39;food co-op&#39;. I find this great for <br/>
the organizationally impaired since many of them choose the fruits and <br/>
veggies for you. You just pick them up. Some of them drop them off.<br/>
<br/>
When I lived in the SF Bay area there were two great businesses that <br/>
offered a weekly box of organic fresh foods dropped at your door. And the <br/>
prices were great. I paid $25 for a box full of fruits and veggies. This <br/>
also pushed me into trying new kinds of foods since I cooked with <br/>
whatever I had. It was my first experience with purple potatos and they <br/>
were awesome. It also put more squashes and roots in my life since I used <br/>
to shop for the same ole&#39; things every week before that.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever we didn&#39;t finish was washed and put in the freezer for stews or <br/>
soups to be used at a later date. The freezer is your FRIEND in times <br/>
like this *smile*. An organic household utilizes all they have to reduce <br/>
expense and waste (we use the ends of broccoli for soups and stews)<br/>
<br/>
Food co-ops also are great for the organizational ones, since you can get <br/>
a list that you check off what you want for the upcoming month. I suppose <br/>
even if you aren&#39;t organized you can sit down ONCE a month and mark off <br/>
what you want (this works for things beside fresh stuff - such as juices, <br/>
dressings, etc).<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t drink our juices at *full* strength. It makes them last longer <br/>
and they aren&#39;t as heavy. We like them like that now!<br/>
<br/>
Does your community offer a farmers market? What a great time to take the <br/>
kids and buy directly from the farmers. What a sense of community and <br/>
support for sustainable living.<br/>
<br/>
If one had a choice between eating no meat or *conventional* meat, I <br/>
would choose no meat. The added female hormones, the pesticides, the <br/>
antibiotics, the deadly hormone that is secreted from fear in a <br/>
slaughterhouse setting is FAR worse than anything. I would then opt to <br/>
get my protein from whey. Making sure its the non-GMO kind.<br/>
<br/>
If you can find organic or at least *natural* meat, then by all means, <br/>
use it if you are meat-eaters by choice.<br/>
<br/>
As Bridget has mentioned, taking it slowly is good way to get started.. <br/>
so how does one decide?<br/>
<br/>
In my experience with additives, here are some choices:<br/>
<br/>
1) NO conventional meat or animal products (including eggs, dairy)<br/>
<br/>
2) Vegetables and fruits (although some are worse than others)<br/>
Carrots have 13 known cancer causing carcinogins, but because of <br/>
grandfather clauses, corpporate farming keeps using them.<br/>
The skin on grapes is so permeable, and they are so delicate to <br/>
environmental changes, they are severely soaked in pesticides, fungicides <br/>
etc.<br/>
Potatos, bananas *seem* to show the least amount of chemicals in many <br/>
tests done.<br/>
Strawberries show a lot of chemicals.<br/>
<br/>
3) Get rid of refined sugars<br/>
<br/>
Where does that leave you for starters? Well, your grains, pastas etc. <br/>
can still be bought at conventional stores until you&#39;ve adjusted in your <br/>
new lifestyle. <br/>
<br/>
good luck,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here (which happens to be the greater SF Bay area) many organic farms<br/>
offer this type of thing.  They call it CSA - community supported<br/>
agriculture.  It&#39;s a win/win since the farmer gets a reliable customer<br/>
base for his products and the customer gets some great food.  I hope<br/>
to get a CSA share with Camp Joy next year - if not there, I will try<br/>
another farm.  This might already be available in your area - or<br/>
perhaps some farmer would be interested in starting one!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430479236">Also, testing has shown that grains grown in European (NOT central and south<br/>
america DDT and various other carcinogens are still used in great<br/>
quantities) countries have less residual pesticides.  If you can&#39;t go the<br/>
organic route totally, then op for imported Italian pastas.  You can<br/>
frequently find them at discount food stores if you buy by the case.  I know<br/>
around here if you buy by the case the imports are $10/case (20 - 1#<br/>
packages).<br/>
<br/>
A good book to read, if you can find it, is Diet for a Poisoned Planet which<br/>
tells you which foods are safest to eat if you can&#39;t go completely organic.<br/>

months to find it for me a couple of years ago), read Fast Food Nation.<br/>
That book was published recently and makes me queasy to think about all<br/>
the fast food I&#39;ve eaten in the past.  It is serious and the chapter<br/>
about slaughter houses is really disturbing.  What is more disturbing<br/>
is what the whole fast food phenomena has done to our culture and to<br/>
our workers.  Many other industries (can you say Walmart?) are using the<br/>
same employment trends.  Also read David Albert&#39;s column in the Jan/Feb<br/>
issue of HEM - it isn&#39;t food related but employment/career related.<br/>
