<div id="ygrps-yiv-341687063">Spank Out Day!<br/>
<br/>
I was spanked/whiped with a belt when I was little for pooping my pants.  <br/>
Every time I pooped I was sent to my room and told to pull my pants down and <br/>
my Dad came in a hut me with his belt. When he was drinking he would <br/>
sometimes use the buckle end unknowingly.<br/>
<br/>
One night he made me sit on the potty for hours on end. He would keep coming <br/>
in and asking me if I went yet. Mom who at the time was working nights came <br/>
home at 2am to me still there dazed. She tells me I was out of it in her <br/>
words.<br/>
I eventually just stopped pooping. After a couple months I finally got sick <br/>
enough and they noticed I hadn&#39;t gone.  I was in Boston Children&#39;s Hospital <br/>
for two weeks at seven and once at ten. The second for dehydration I have no <br/>
idea why?<br/>
<br/>
My Parents got divorced and all was good until I was 12 and I ended up living <br/>
with him because my Mother remarried, had another child and we (my sister and <br/>
I) where old news. The last day my Father touched me was when I was running <br/>
out of his house after he had tried to strangle me, picked me up by my hair <br/>
and pulled a good clump out. My father and Step mother where both running <br/>
after me but I ran out the door to a neighbor.<br/>
I am now 32 with three of my own. My sister with four. We both broke the <br/>
cycle in our family by being there for each other.<br/>
My parents where good people otherwise. My dad knows now the damage he did. I <br/>
am fine now but I dont recall any of my child hood I blocked most of it out. <br/>
I can only recall pieces when I look at photo&#39;s or when I am in conversation <br/>
with them and they say you don&#39;t remember this and that? Ahh, no I dont. <br/>
We have friends that are religious (Their church advocates this) who spank <br/>
and for stupid things. Why do people hit their kids to get them to stop <br/>
hitting what&#39;s up with that!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the depressing story, someday I will find my way to help others to <br/>
stop damaging their children. <br/>

telling it could not have been easy. Thanks for doing it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  I heard someone say very recently (my foggy brain doesn&#39;t remember <br/>
who - sorry!) that we are all doing the best we can with the choices we <br/>
have available to us at the time; what we all need is to be able see that <br/>
there are, or at least may be, more choices. I don&#39;t believe that can <br/>
excuse people for heinous behavior, but sometimes I think it might be good <br/>
to know. <br/>

same with us.  Although I never had bruises, it didn&#39;t help my pride <br/>
any!  So I hear you!<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who attended a religious &quot;class&quot; on parenting.  Their <br/>
solution was to take the child out for a reminder, i.e. spanking.  <br/>
Apparently, she never spanks them for doing something wrong like <br/>
throwing something.  Instead, they are always told they get spanked <br/>
soley for disobeying mom.  Okay, am I the only one that sees a <br/>
probelm with this.  These children will certinaly not be independent <br/>
thinkers and how can they possibly make moral evaluations. How can <br/>
you have a discussion with your child about making better choices <br/>
when the only option is Mom. It is just a bit scary to me!<br/>

Thank you o very much. Telling this took much courage and much love. <br/>

I send you all the healing I can.<br/>

going to be awful from the first page but read it till the bitter end. Page<br/>
135, The Swat Chart<br/>
Causing Trouble = 1 swat, aggressive behaviour (hitting, biting etc) = 3<br/>
swats, name calling = 2 swats but bad language = 10 swats.<br/>
Moral of the story, hit your brother if you have to, but don&#39;t freakin<br/>
swear!!!<br/>
It&#39;s insane. How can kids trust their parents to help them make *good*<br/>
choices when their parents are stupid!<br/>

their obedience to God.  They don&#39;t need any independent thinking, because <br/>
God is going to tell them everything they need to do. <br/>

My mom put a number of swats to every offense.  Even tattling.<br/>
She pulled those numbers out of her butt.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Never hit in anger,&quot; and she was proud of that little principle, but if she <br/>
was angry when she passed sentence you got five instead of two, and come to <br/>
think of it she was usually angry (or at least agitated) if it was earlier in <br/>
the day than the time she had decided was okay to start drinking (which <br/>
backed up earlier in the day as years went by, naturally) or if she was out <br/>
of beer.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s stupid.  No amount of mental contortion or justification makes it smart.<br/>
