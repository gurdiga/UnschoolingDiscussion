My grandfather has played the banjo for over 30 years.  I called him for <br/>
advice on this situation.  Here goes:<br/>
<br/>
Yes, reversing the strings is what you need to do.  However, the fifth <br/>
string peg (the shortest string, with the peg on the side) will need a new <br/>
home. &lt;g&gt;  Easy as drilling a new hole on the opposite side for the fifth <br/>
peg.  It should make sense if you are looking at the actual banjo.  I think <br/>
you said this was a borrowed banjo, but if you could get your hands on a <br/>
used one, I think it would be easier than trying to find a lefty.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this makes sense and helps!<br/>

The whole fretboard is shaped toward that string.  It&#39;s wider from that <br/>
string down.  Maybe on some banjos it&#39;s not that way, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715901307">Hmmm...dunno then! :)  Sounds like He&#39;ll do well enough to get the feel of <br/>
it and then I guess the answer is hunting down a used one that is reasonably <br/>
priced.  I&#39;ll ask my grandfather if he knows of any good sources next time I <br/>
talk to him.  He may have something useful to pass along!<br/>
