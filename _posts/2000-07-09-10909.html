&lt;&lt; said that she knows a bunch of women who get<br/>
 together and have a cleaning co-op. Kinda like I&#39;ll<br/>
 help you clean  your house if you help me clean mine.<br/>
 She said that before she knew they were doing this she<br/>
 was embarrassed because their houses were so much<br/>
 cleaner than hers. Now that she knows she doesn&#39;t feel<br/>
 so bad.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not a bad idea, except that people like me wouldn&#39;t be able to do it-- I&#39;d <br/>
*have* to clean it before they came over to help clean!! lol!  :) ~Karen</div>
