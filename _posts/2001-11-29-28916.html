<br/>
Did you also point out that there&#39;s an excellent chance that at least half of <br/>
those doing the teasing don&#39;t have *their* times tables memorized either, but <br/>
were going along with the teasing out of fear of being discovered?<br/>
<br/>
If you can raise kids so they aren&#39;t afraid to say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; and then <br/>
able to decide if they want to know or not, you&#39;ll have done a good job. <br/>
That&#39;s the worst thing schools and parents do to kids, set the rules and the <br/>
stakes in such a way that we (societal we) say to them that learning is <br/>
important while at the same time making it emotionally risky to admit to not <br/>
knowing something, which is where learning starts. <br/>
<br/>
In all my schooling, almost every teacher said at the beginning of the class <br/>
&quot;There&#39;s no such thing as a stupid question.&quot; Almost every one of them failed <br/>
to support that philosophy in the classroom. Some actually ridiculed kids for <br/>
questions (&quot;You should know that by now!&quot;) but most &quot;merely&quot; allowed teasing, <br/>
sighed over the tenth question in a row from a particular child, and in many <br/>
other ways showed their frustration over questions. Kids learn pretty quickly <br/>
(most of them) that questions &quot;for show&quot; are safer than real honest &quot;I&#39;m so <br/>
confused&quot; questions, and it isn&#39;t long before in most classrooms the only <br/>
kids asking questions are the ones who are savvy enough to know what the <br/>
teacher wants asked, to be able to figure out the script the teacher is <br/>
working from.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029043890">Hello again!   <br/>
We have a situation here and I&#39;m wondering how other unschoolers <br/>
would handle it.<br/>
<br/>
Our home is located across from a Little League field.  We have tons <br/>
of mainstream, public schooled children around in the Spring and <br/>
Summer.  My children LOVE the energy and enjoy playing with <br/>
different children all the time.<br/>
<br/>
However ...   there have been a few girls who have teased Kaylie and <br/>
Sara ...  saying mean things about homeschoolers or <br/>
homeschooling ...  typical but still hard.  Those &quot;mean girls&quot; <br/>
usually hang out w/ a couple of sweet girls who are nice to my <br/>
children, so my girls don&#39;t want to leave and play at home ...  but <br/>
those &quot;mean girls&quot;  quiz my girls by asking &quot;What&#39;s 2 X 2?&quot;  and <br/>
then if/when my girls answer, the quizzing continues, getting more <br/>
difficult, until the time comes that my girls have no answer. It is <br/>
so ridiculous but of course, important to my girls.  One particular <br/>
girl is very competitive w/ my 7 yr old (who is taller/heavier than <br/>
girls her age)  and claims &quot;I can run faster than you&quot;  ...  etc.  I <br/>
have responded to that by informing Kaylie that she may run a little <br/>
slower but is likely much stronger than that little 7 yr old.   Not <br/>
sure if that is the right approach.  Sometimes I wanna run over <br/>
there and scream and throw sand in those little &quot;mean&quot;  faces.  <br/>
ROFL!  Pick on my babies will you... LOL~   Obviously I resist that <br/>
urge and try to handle it appropriately, but I&#39;m not sure what the <br/>
right thing is.  My girls would rather stay and play and risk hurt <br/>
feelings than not have any friends to play w/ at the field.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried giving my girls a confidence boost by telling them all of <br/>
the wonderful things about homeschooling, and asking their favorite <br/>
things about homeschooling ...  I&#39;ve told them about all of the <br/>
famous homeschoolers ...  etc.<br/>
<br/>
Those &quot;mean girls&quot;  are still at it and my girls are not sure how to <br/>
handle it.  (they are 5 and 7 yrs old)  ...  I&#39;ve told them they are <br/>
welcome to play at the field and if the teasing or insults become <br/>
too much, they are safe here at home.  I&#39;m not sure if I should <br/>
encourage them to defend themselves/homeschooling or just ignore <br/>
this teasing.  I&#39;ve even told the girls (and my older son when it <br/>
happened to him)  that those schooled children are probably <br/>
jealous!  <br/>
<br/>
How do other people and their children handle public school teasing, <br/>
etc?<br/>

<br/>
Maybe going over and asking the girls to be nicer to your girls wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
at all inappropriate.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem with school playgrounds is the teachers want SOME time, <br/>
and they tend to talk to each other instead of being right where the kids are.  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Kids too far from parents for too long might start to behave school-like, and <br/>
when some of them are already school-like, I&#39;d say don&#39;t leave them too long. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly had a math problem she would ask back of people who quizzed her.  It <br/>
was something she had memorized, and wasn&#39;t in the regular times tables, but she <br/>
had memorized the answer and it was something in the range of 23 times 7 or <br/>
something like that.  That&#39;s an idea. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My girls would rather stay and play and risk hurt <br/>
<br/>
feelings than not have any friends to play w/ at the field.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But isn&#39;t that how all of life is to some extent?  People risk hurt feelings <br/>
to have ANY friends, or to get married, or to have children. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

What are your kids into?  My guess is that they know things the other kids<br/>

My dd is into goats and would quiz back about breeds of goats, number of<br/>

&lt;&lt;How do other people and their children handle public school teasing,<br/>
etc?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This actually happened once with Joseph at the park. A boy a year older than<br/>
him started with asking where he went to school. Once he found out Joseph<br/>
didn&#39;t, he started with the teasing and asking questions. He asked Joseph<br/>
some history question and Joseph just said he didn&#39;t know. Then he turned<br/>
the tables around and started quizzing the kid about numbers, which Joseph<br/>
can do well in his head. Well that really pissed the kid off because he<br/>
didn&#39;t know and it turned physical that fast. As soon as I saw the kid<br/>
strike his &quot;bring it on&quot; pose, I was over there in a second. Joseph had no<br/>
clue this kid was ready to belt him. I asked the kid if there was a problem<br/>
and he told me Joseph was lonely!!! I had to actually laugh at that. He was<br/>
the one that approached Joseph. I wonder where the kid heard that from?<br/>
<br/>
It was over and Joseph had a really hard time understanding why this kid got<br/>
so mad and wanted to fight. He really had no clue he could get popped for<br/>
something like that.<br/>
<br/>
When teasing happened after, my kids just really shrug their shoulders and<br/>
say they don&#39;t care that the other can run faster, jump higher or answer<br/>
questions better. My kids really don&#39;t let that bother them and I can say it<br/>
doesn&#39;t happen often.<br/>
<br/>
The few times my kids have been bothered, I go over and talk to the<br/>
child/children like I would if they were mine. I ask what&#39;s wrong and ask<br/>
them to be nicer and let them know they can all play together without<br/>
teasing over differences. That actually takes care of things.<br/>
<br/>
If it gets bad, my kids just pretty much stay away.<br/>

Ignoring them will diffuse the situation. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depends when and how they ignore people.<br/>
It won&#39;t make them friends, and it will make some situations worse.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend against teaching kids ANY hard and fast &quot;always&quot; rules.  There&#39;s <br/>
very little information that will work in all situations.   Helping them have <br/>
a little &quot;toolbox&quot; of alternatives and ideas will be better than teaching them <br/>
to ignore, or teaching them to fight back, or teaching them to get an adult, <br/>
or any one single teaching.<br/>

about how great it can be for kids to play together without teasing and <br/>
how it is hard sometimes, but very worth it, to work on being good <br/>
friends and playmates. If you can do this without casting blame, but <br/>
sort of try to inspire them to &quot;see&quot; a higher level of what is possible <br/>
- how very NICE life can be if they work a bit on being kind - you <br/>
might just catch hold of some part of their better selves.  You can <br/>
talk about how people need other people to defend them and care about <br/>
them and how much nicer it is to play with people when everybody cares <br/>
about each other.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you don&#39;t change the particular problem kids, you influence the <br/>
kids who otherwise might just &quot;go along&quot; so that maybe they won&#39;t put <br/>
up with negative stuff as much.<br/>
<br/>
If you can be uplifting and inspiring and it helps, I really think it <br/>
is better than starting with orders, demands, or threats. When you&#39;re <br/>
talking to them, you want to create a sense of teamwork, not leave them <br/>
feeling like adversaries.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If it doesn&#39;t work - you can still go with the firm requests later.<br/>

I&#39;ve found there is a very fine line between causing more problems for my <br/>
children,  by &quot;talking&quot; to the group about politeness or friendliness.  It <br/>
definitely depends on the age group of the children.  Sometimes it&#39;s better to let <br/>
the children find their own way in the group of children.  Remembering that <br/>
you&#39;ve allowed your child to grow and be strong and secure in their own being and <br/>
they won&#39;t allow more behaviours towards them, than they are benefitting <br/>
from.  If it gets to hateful, they know they can come home to you.  They know they <br/>
can walk away at any time.  It&#39;s not like they are stuck in a classroom with <br/>
these children or even have to see them every day at school or on the bus.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand if violence is involved, definitely takes some <br/>
intervention, either by strongly suggesting my own children not go there to play or <br/>
somehow removing them from danger.<br/>
<br/>
Kids have a way of working things out though.  Almost always.  I think it&#39;s <br/>
harder for the mom to watch and hear from the outside than it is for the <br/>
children sometimes.  I know I&#39;ve had days I wanted to just snatch a child up and <br/>
make them listen to me as I tell them how NOT to be to my children.  I almost <br/>
always resisted! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m talking about inspiring them - talking about how GREAT things can <br/>
be. Some people can be inspiring to a group and some can&#39;t talk to them <br/>
without making the kids feel that they&#39;ve been chastised and THAT can <br/>
cause more problems.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   It<br/>
&gt; definitely depends on the age group of the children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I don&#39;t agree. Kids and adults of all ages can be inspired to <br/>
behave more kindly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes it&#39;s better to let<br/>
&gt; the children find their own way in the group of children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes people do that because they don&#39;t know how to intervene <br/>
without making things worse, this is especially true if the adults <br/>
can&#39;t talk about problems without making the kids feel they are being <br/>
blamed, but it IS possible to let all the kids know you&#39;re there to <br/>
help and that they are NOT just being left on their own to find their <br/>
own way all by themselves. And it is possible to inspire many of them <br/>
to feel more supportive of each other and less likely, as a group, to <br/>
tolerate hurtful behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Remembering that<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ve allowed your child to grow and be strong and secure in their <br/>
&gt; own being and<br/>
&gt; they won&#39;t allow more behaviours towards them, than they are <br/>
&gt; benefitting<br/>
&gt; from.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Group interactions outside the family are different. Several individual <br/>
children may be feeling hurt, but covering it up with bravado or <br/>
withdrawing or whatever - and other children may be feeling a bit of <br/>
discomfort but, not communicating that to each other, they don&#39;t stand <br/>
together and make it clear that the meanness is not okay with them. <br/>
Each thinks it is just them, sometimes. Other times they just don&#39;t <br/>
realize that their friends are really being hurt. When a caring and <br/>
kind adult steps in to encourage and support their best instincts, to <br/>
defend their friends from being hurt, for example, and to speak out if <br/>
they are not comfortable, that can definitely help the kids handle the <br/>
problems. An adult can remind the kids, &quot;If you think your friend&#39;s <br/>
feelings are being hurt, remember that they&#39;ll feel better if they know <br/>
you didn&#39;t like it and didn&#39;t agree.&quot; Kids might not think about this <br/>
on their own. An adult can say, &quot;If somebody is hurting your friend&#39;s <br/>
feelings, you might make things better if you say something like, &#39;Stop <br/>
it, that&#39;s hurting her feelings,&#39;&quot; Sometimes kids NEED adults to help <br/>
them - to help them recognize or articulate things. To help them feel <br/>
like they have ways to resolve problems, together, and that they have <br/>
your backing, too.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If it gets to hateful, they know they can come home to you.  They know <br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; can walk away at any time.  It&#39;s not like they are stuck in a <br/>
&gt; classroom with<br/>
&gt; these children or even have to see them every day at school or on the <br/>
&gt; bus.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These are situations where the kids want to be there, obviously. The <br/>
answer isn&#39;t to just abandon them to the group - if they want to be <br/>
there they have to put up with whatever since they have the option to <br/>
just leave. Adults or other kids, for that matter, can help the whole <br/>
group work better for everybody. Lots of times kids just need a little <br/>
help in recognizing what is happening.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; intervention, either by strongly suggesting my own children not go <br/>
&gt; there to play or<br/>
&gt; somehow removing them from danger.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Waiting until there is violence involved is far more hands-off than I <br/>
think we need to be - hurtful behavior, teasing and insulting, is <br/>
common among groups of kids, but we can help them be kinder to each <br/>
other and they can get the feeling of how NICE it is to play together <br/>
when the insulting and teasing is absent and when tolerance and <br/>
kindness is the norm.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kids have a way of working things out though.  Almost always.<br/>
<br/>

to their own devices is what happens on the school playgrounds.<br/>

<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And what i was saying was not at ALL about telling individual kids how <br/>
NOT to be. I think you didn&#39;t get the point. You sound afraid that <br/>
parents talking to kids will make the kids behave worse or something. <br/>
That is not my experience at all. My experience is that parents should <br/>
be THERE and that the kids need to know that parents are there and <br/>
ready and willing to help them out. I think lots of kids just want to <br/>
have a good time and don&#39;t feel good, themselves, when other kids are <br/>
getting their feelings hurt, but they don&#39;t do anything about it for <br/>
various reasons. We can help and inspire those kids who don&#39;t like <br/>
teasing, much less bullying, to feel strong enough to stand together <br/>
and defend each other and to create play groups that function the way <br/>
THEY want them. It does take a certain attitude on the parents&#39; parts <br/>
and stepping in with an attitude of blame and of defending only our own <br/>
children and telling kids what to do and what not to do is not at ALL <br/>
what I was talking about.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or - get a group of them together and talk, for just 2 or 3 minutes,<br/>
&gt; about how great it can be for kids to play together without teasing and<br/>
&gt; how it is hard sometimes, but very worth it, to work on being good<br/>
&gt; friends and playmates. If you can do this without casting blame, but<br/>
&gt; sort of try to inspire them to &quot;see&quot; a higher level of what is possible<br/>
&gt; - how very NICE life can be if they work a bit on being kind - you<br/>
&gt; might just catch hold of some part of their better selves<br/>

very well might work to encourage them to be kinder and give them a &quot;pep&quot; talk on <br/>
kindness and such.<br/>
<br/>
School age children, more often than not, in my experience take any effort of <br/>
that sort and feel it is interfering from a parent of a child, especially one <br/>
that have been picking on or teasing.  A parent to the rescue whether being <br/>
extremely nice or being condescending or even threatening, often has exactly <br/>
the same response from children, further causing problems for the very children <br/>
you&#39;d hope to make more comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if my children were playing at the ball fields (as they often have) I <br/>
might send them along with some cookies or even show up with some popsicles to <br/>
share with their new &quot;friends&quot;.  Maybe just showing a kindness might evoke a <br/>
kinder attitude.  MAYBE, I think a LOT of words sometimes just get tuned out by <br/>
kids from sitting and just hearing words all day in a classroom.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe explaining the virtues of kindness and how it might work to everyone in <br/>
the groups advantage would work on some groups but from my own personal <br/>
experiences it would probably have about the same affect as telling them not to <br/>
mess with YOUR KID.<br/>
<br/>
I live in a transient area, lots of military children, lots of FBI and <br/>
children of political party families that move with the administration change.  <br/>
Maybe in the part of the State that I grew up in, a talk on kindness would be the <br/>
thing, here it simply wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I wish it would, that would be wonderful if that&#39;s all it took to stop the <br/>
wicked teasing that some kids experience on a daily basis.<br/>

&gt; &quot;pep&quot; talk on<br/>
&gt; kindness and such.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not talking about younger than school-age children. I&#39;m talking  <br/>
about all ages including teenagers.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t say it would always work to stop the teasing child.  I said  <br/>
that it would help empower the OTHER children, those who are being  <br/>
teased and those who are letting it slide, feeling uncomfortable  <br/>
because their friend is being teased but not doing anything about it.  <br/>
It can help the &#39;rest&#39; of the group of kids recognize that they aren&#39;t  <br/>
the only ones feeling uncomfortable and it can support them in standing  <br/>
up for each other. THEY can change the tone and make it unacceptable  <br/>
for the teasing to go on. THEY often have that power, but they don&#39;t  <br/>
realize it, sometimes, or don&#39;t realize that everybody could work  <br/>
together to achieve it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A parent to the rescue<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not talking about &quot;a parent to the rescue&quot; - I&#39;m talking about  <br/>
something very different.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; whether being<br/>
&gt; extremely nice or being condescending or even threatening, often has  <br/>
&gt; exactly<br/>
&gt; the same response from children,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not talking about a parent just doing the same old thing, telling  <br/>
the kids to behave better, but doing it nicely.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  further causing problems for the very children<br/>
&gt; you&#39;d hope to make more comfortable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try to pretend for a minute I&#39;m talking about an adult doing something  <br/>
you haven&#39;t actually envisioned doing. We are talking about unschooling  <br/>
parents - not just anybody. First, remember, I said 2 or 3 minutes - so  <br/>
we&#39;re talking a very brief little interlude. Second, I said the parent  <br/>
isn&#39;t accusing or blaming or saying anybody is at fault, no matter HOW  <br/>
nicely they say it. Third, I&#39;m assuming the parents are the type to be  <br/>
involved and friendly and do things together with ALL the kids,  <br/>
because, in general, that is true of unschooling parents, they get to  <br/>
know the kids their friends play with, they are generally well-liked by  <br/>
the kids their friends play with because they are fun and generous and  <br/>
kind. They tend to have a certain amount of natural &quot;authority&quot; - not  <br/>
to make demands and give orders, but to be taken seriously and listened  <br/>
to carefully.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe if my children were playing at the ball fields (as they often  <br/>

&gt; evoke a<br/>
&gt; kinder attitude.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If there was an ongoing situation, I&#39;d be over there, sitting under a  <br/>
tree with a book, with goodies, with some games, with whatever I  <br/>
happened to have that might interest the kids. A puppy. Whatever! &lt;G&gt;  <br/>
If kids are having problems with other kids, they NEED their parents  <br/>
nearby. And, unschooling parents tend to be pretty nice to be around  <br/>
and other kids tend to like them a lot.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  MAYBE, I think a LOT of words sometimes just get tuned out by<br/>
&gt; kids from sitting and just hearing words all day in a classroom.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re making up something in your head that you think I&#39;m describing,  <br/>
but it isn&#39;t what I&#39;ve described. Try rereading it.  AND - the kids who  <br/>
we are talking about, at least a couple of them are unschoolers. You  <br/>
are persisting in thinking that I&#39;m just suggesting some sort of  <br/>
sweetened-lecture directed at the problem kids, but that is not what I  <br/>
had suggested.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; them not to<br/>
&gt; mess with YOUR KID.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s your experience. I think it is probably because you were  <br/>
still directing it at the problem kids and everybody knew it. My  <br/>
suggestion is not directed at them - in fact, they don&#39;t have to even  <br/>
BE there - it is all the OTHER kids that need the empowerment to resist  <br/>
falling into step with the belittling and insulting tone that a few  <br/>
might set.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I live in a transient area, lots of military children, lots of FBI and<br/>
&gt; children of political party families that move with the administration  <br/>
&gt; change.<br/>
&gt; Maybe in the part of the State that I grew up in, a talk on kindness  <br/>
&gt; would be the<br/>
&gt; thing, here it simply wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You thought I was offering a magic bullet - that I thought a parent  <br/>
could lecture some teasing kid about how much nicer the world would be  <br/>
if they&#39;d just be nice? And that would magically change their behavior?  <br/>
Nah. I&#39;m not stupid. I suggested something that might help to empower  <br/>
the children to feel strong enough to take some control over the tone  <br/>
of their own playtime under conditions in which they ARE having a good  <br/>
enough time to want to stay, but are repeatedly getting hurt feelings,  <br/>
too. I suggested that parents try this approach first, because it is  <br/>
more empowering to the kids, before they resort to going over and tell  <br/>
the problem-causing kid to knock it off.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I wish it would, that would be wonderful if that&#39;s all it took to stop  <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; wicked teasing that some kids experience on a daily basis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You generalized to a larger problem and what I offered is not  <br/>
generalizable. I&#39;m not talking about teasing that goes in in schools,  <br/>
for example. I&#39;m not talking about bullying or physical violence. I&#39;m  <br/>
talking about kids who are pretty much having a good time playing  <br/>
together in a group and want to continue, but could use some help in  <br/>
how to handle it when a kid or two is causing hurt feelings. My point  <br/>
is that if you can inspire those kids to feel like they&#39;re all in it  <br/>
together, that they care about each other and should defend each other,  <br/>
and let them know that it does take some effort to create the kind of  <br/>
atmosphere they want - accepting and kind, for example, then just that  <br/>
knowledge, that they have the right to expect it and that they can work  <br/>
together to achieve it, can change the dynamics a lot.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe I am missing your point.  I&#39;d willing to examine that.  What words <br/>
would you use in this few minutes of talking that would leave no one to feel like <br/>
they were being singled out for what had taken place (making others feel <br/>
badly) or that it was wrong or shaming them, but being positive.<br/>
<br/>
Since you pointed out that this could apply even to adults who were having a <br/>
great time but possibly one or more were made to feel badly about something, I <br/>
think it would be very useful to actually hear the words that could be used <br/>
to help turn this around to a positive for everyone involved.<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t really have that problem anymore but I&#39;ve seen it with younger <br/>
kids around where my older kids have games and oftened wondered if there was <br/>
any good way to help the situation, without seeming intrusive or rude.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I thinking of other words entirely than what you are, I&#39;d love to hear <br/>
what you might say in these circumstances.  I think  it would make it clearer <br/>
for me to understand what you are saying.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would speak very warmly and lovingly and truly from my heart, knowing <br/>
these were children who WANT to play together and have a good time <br/>
together. I&#39;d say that, first. &quot;I&#39;m so glad you&#39;ve found each other and <br/>
are playing together. It is so great to have friends and time to play, <br/>
don&#39;t you think?&quot;  I&#39;d maybe go on and say something like, &quot;Don&#39;t you <br/>
just love it when you&#39;re playing together and everything just falls <br/>
into place and everybody is having a great time? I remember, when I was <br/>
a kid, what it was like to completely get involved in what we were <br/>
playing and it was so cool!! I&#39;m pretty sure that every kid knows what <br/>
I&#39;m talking about, right?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I am a little concerned, though, because  there are things that can <br/>
mess up that really special kind of super fun playtime, so it is <br/>
important to be aware of those things and avoid them. I mean, that <br/>
magical wonderful kind of really GOOD playtime doesn&#39;t just happen, it <br/>
does take some work - kids have to be careful to be really accepting <br/>
and kind to each other, so everybody feels free to relax and really get <br/>
INTO their play, whatever it is they&#39;re doing. And kids need to know <br/>
that if they are being bugged or teased by something or by somebody, <br/>
that their friends will defend them and kind of take care of each <br/>
others&#39; feelings. That&#39;s what friends do and that&#39;s why they have such <br/>
a good time together.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just had this little thing I felt like saying, because I <br/>
think kids&#39; play is really special and important and I care about all <br/>
of you and hope you&#39;ll have the very BEST time playing together. You <br/>
can talk about it more together, if you feel like it, or just think <br/>
about it or whatever. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So - not probably my exact words, because it would be more <br/>
natural-sounding, this sounds sort of stilted. But that&#39;s the best I <br/>
can do in a generic way to get the idea across.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve found there is a very fine line between causing more problems for my <br/>
children,  by &quot;talking&quot; to the group about politeness or friendliness.  It <br/>
definitely depends on the age group of the children.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It can depend on the tact and social skills of the mom too.<br/>
<br/>
-=- If it gets to hateful, they know they can come home to you.  They know <br/>
they <br/>
can walk away at any time.  It&#39;s not like they are stuck in a classroom with <br/>
these children or even have to see them every day at school or on the bus.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s true.<br/>
But it would help if going to a mom is potentially worth more than just being <br/>
told &quot;you can walk away from them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-On the other hand if violence is involved, definitely takes some <br/>
intervention, either by strongly suggesting my own children not go there to <br/>
play or <br/>
somehow removing them from danger.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Neither of those options will hand a clue to the bullying kid that his <br/>
behavior isn&#39;t acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Kids have a way of working things out though.  Almost always.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, sometimes what seems worked out to parents (because the <br/>
complaining stopped) is one child just letting the other(s) roll over him and <br/>
keeping his feelings to himself because they weren&#39;t getting him the assistance <br/>
he wanted anyway.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I know I&#39;ve had days I wanted to just snatch a child up and <br/>
make them listen to me as I tell them how NOT to be to my children. -=-<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of degrees between saying nothing and snatching them up and <br/>
trying to make them listen.  <br/>

Depends one the words, the intent, the tone, the attitude of the speaker.<br/>

Throwing our kids in with kids who are used to abusive behavior among kids <br/>
and then not being there to help them out is like giving them school recess <br/>
without even the possibility of teachers on duty.<br/>

somehow removing them from danger.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Neither of those options will hand a clue to the bullying kid that his <br/>
behavior isn&#39;t acceptable.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Time to relate my &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; story from the park a couple of weeks<br/>
ago.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn and I were at one of the parks we go to a lot. Another group of<br/>
children were playing there - 6 kids of ages about 5 to I&#39;m guessing 9 or 10<br/>
with two possibly related mothers who were sitting together on the grass<br/>
periodically shouting out instructions (Don&#39;t do that...stop this...etc).<br/>
Another unrelated brother and sister came along shortly after. The boy<br/>
joined in the fluid running around games of the main group, while Jayn was<br/>
playing with the little girl for a while. There was some confusion over who<br/>
was going to use the slide for a while, but they sorted it out and all was<br/>
well for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Then the little girl went to the swings with her grandmother, and Jayn<br/>
joined in with the other group.<br/>
<br/>
About five minutes later the other mothers stood up and walked off to the<br/>
swings area, 50 feet away, behind where I was sitting on the grass.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a ripple of little heads turning as the now group of 7 noticed that<br/>
their caretakers were suddenly inattentive - it was like watching dominoes<br/>
fall. Then, whoosh, I felt the atmosphere change. In the four seconds it<br/>
took me to get to my feet and start walking towards the equipment, every one<br/>
of the 7 had attacked Jayn with fistfuls of sand - viciously and<br/>
deliberately. She ran, astonishingly fast, up the equipment to the very top<br/>
of the big twisting slide - at the bottom of which lay in wait the biggest<br/>
boy with his handfuls of sand. Jayn called out &quot;no don&#39;t&quot; a bit as they<br/>
approached, and then I just bellowed - &quot;Stop throwing sand at my daughter!&quot;<br/>
Didn&#39;t know I had that volume in me actually. They all stopped and stared,<br/>
looking almost dazed - it was as if they hadn&#39;t realized she had an adult<br/>
(protector) with her. I then loudly said something about sand being painful<br/>
to eyes, and went back to sit down.<br/>
<br/>
After a moment of general confusion, Jayn came down the slide - safely - and<br/>
ran to me. She asked about food, which we didn&#39;t have and then wanted to go<br/>
to eat. I noticed once we got home that she was not actually hungry, so I<br/>
think that was her way of leaving without losing face in her own mind. This<br/>
is the first time something scary like this has happened. It was weird and<br/>
disturbing - to me anyway; Jayn has not mentioned the event or wanted to<br/>
avoid that park. BTW the other parents evidently neither heard nor saw any<br/>
of it, being too busy enjoying a swing themselves. Jayn called out goodbye<br/>
to the little girl perfectly pleasantly, and it was not until later that she<br/>
was talking to me about throwing sand at people being wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what I should have done differently, if anything. It seemed to<br/>
me that Jayn was in actual danger from a mob of bullies. The biggest boy had<br/>
seemed quite nice in the way he was interacting with the younger kids, while<br/>
his mother was watching him. It was really flabbergasting to see this happen<br/>
right in front of me.<br/>
