<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103523239">I have become interested in reading some classics but find that many of the classics at the library are hard to find or are &quot;adapted&quot; and not the orginial.   So I went back to a website I used 5 years ago that had tons of links to ebooks.<br/>
<br/>
This site is a Charlotte Mason Amberside Online site that had free Curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
I decided for fun to read the classics online and now my dd is begging me to read them to her.   If she wanders away while I read, I just keep reading and let her go off if she wants.   She liked a story about Robin Hood from a ebook Fifty Famous Stories Retold by James Baldwin.<br/>
Heres the link to Baldwins book<br/>

<br/>
You can go back to the home page from this link and find a list of lots of book online.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are asking for reading aloud times.  They like me reading to them and I am enjoying some good reading time alone time too.</div>
