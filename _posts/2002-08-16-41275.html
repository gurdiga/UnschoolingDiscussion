All of my children (6) are traumatized from going to public school for a<br/>
multitude of reasons some worse than others. I am the one that is<br/>
&quot;reforming&quot; myself and them to unschool. It does seem like cheating, as<br/>
someone mentioned earlier. The old message is &quot;you have to do it because<br/>
everyone else is&quot; and the old one &quot;would you jump of a cliff if everyone<br/>
else was doing it?&quot; that my parents used to tell me.:) No contradiction<br/>
there... Yes, I think my 19 year old son needs time to recover from<br/>
public school - it seems sometimes it takes people an entire life time.<br/>
What he does best is write - deep, thoughtful, tear producing articles,<br/>
stories, songs, and so on. He sings beautifully. He has a following and<br/>
can&#39;t see that for himself right now. He works in a convenience store<br/>
that mostly sells liquor. He is tired of alcoholics talk about how<br/>
&quot;happy&quot; they will be when they are drunk. They tell him more than he<br/>
wants to hear and most of it is not good/healthy. He is learning on his<br/>
own about that. It has been a big lesson in life management skills, etc.<br/>
He&#39;s the kind of kid that everyone likes and talks to. I think that is a<br/>
strong point. No matter how much I tell him I think he is &quot;perfect&quot; he<br/>
has his own stuff to go through like the rest of us. It is hard to let<br/>
go. He thinks he has to go and learn something - he already knows so<br/>
much and voids a lot of it out. Programming. Right now I am hearing him<br/>
say I shouldn&#39;t homeschool and going ahead and doing it anyway. I think<br/>
we will all learn about unschooling little by little. Like everything<br/>
else it is a process. Blessings, Michele<br/>

<br/>
But the impression I got, re the &quot;working&quot; thread, was that he was <br/>
wasting away up in his room, working on his music, being depressed and <br/>
little else.<br/>
<br/>
I still think a full time job with benefits (factory or UPS or something <br/>
like that) could be a solution for the health insurance thing.  It would <br/>
still be his *choice* to be here, and once you focus on that, working is <br/>
so much less like school.<br/>
