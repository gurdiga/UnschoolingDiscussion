<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607080893">SSUDs (dads&#39; get-together), previously scheduled for Saturday morning at  <br/>
9:00am, has been changed to Friday evening from 6:30-8:00pm.  Since I know  the <br/>
conference coordinator so well and she is such a cool person,  we thought it <br/>
best to get this in earlier in the conference.  If there  are open questions <br/>
after our Friday evening meeting, we&#39;ll schedule  another, more informal <br/>
discussion before the meeting&#39;s end.  <br/>
 <br/>
Please note the change and let me know if you want something discussed  <br/>
during the meeting.  <br/>
