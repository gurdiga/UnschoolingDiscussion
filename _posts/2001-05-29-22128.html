  yard (not that I need the little fat quarter either!)  But I just like them and I<br/>
  can get fabric I really like at a fraction of the cost.  Just call me weird!  :o)<br/>

For starters, lemme say I am a wannabe quilter.  I have done some small ones by hand since I don&#39;t have clue one as to how a sewing machine works.<br/>
<br/>
There is a store here in Detroit called &quot;Arts and Scraps&quot; (Warren Ave, just west of Mack Ave.) where they take in industrial scraps and sell WHATEVER it is for $3 to fill a grocery sack.(a friend did a marble entry way for under $15)  I am in HOG HEAVEN at that store cause I pick up fabric sample books(from interior design places and the like) and get the &quot;chic chic poo-pooh&quot; stuff that should cost $65 bucks a yard(retail cause the price is marked at the back of the book) and I have the pre-cut 3 x 3 squares(or whatever it is) and I cut it down to my size ( I never measure) and then pin them together, and sew them into crazy quilts.  I go to Walmarts or fabric stores for the backing and buy the stuff that is on clearance or just make a 2 sided mismatched quilt.  I also use these fabrics to make those dumb fabric wreaths to give for holiday gifts (you know, the stuff that takes you 50+ hours to make and the family member hides them on a wall behind a door or something).<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, it gives me something to do, and I love working with damask, linen, silks - oh hell, anything tactile.  My sister in law is due in November, maybe I should check out the store and make a lovely silk &quot;woobie&quot; for this new darling on the way.<br/>
