First of all I don&#39;t know of anyone who was ever asked to see their high<br/>
school diploma when going for a job.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
The first and ONLY time I&#39;ve ever been asked for my diploma was this year by <br/>
an accountability association in SC (in order to unschool, you have to <br/>
register with an accountability association and the teaching parent has to have a <br/>
high school diploma or better.). And I actually got my high school transcript, <br/>
NOT my diploma. I have NO idea where that is (I didn&#39;t frame it! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
