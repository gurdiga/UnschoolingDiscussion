<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953858959">This week is the first week on unschooling. All my son wanted to do was to play video games & get on facebook. Well, he did go to the fitness center today & work out for an hour. Tuesdays he has voice lessons, which went well according to his instructor. We also went to Co-Op Thursday. The classes he takes are Guitar, Photography, & PE. The lessons go alright, but on the times he&#39;s home, he&#39;s basically doing nothing. We are enrolled in an umbrella school & I&#39;m having a hard time writing down what he does all day. Any suggestions?<br/>

either by you or by time constraints, before he can let go he needs  <br/>
to fill up on them and needs to feel like if he turns something off  <br/>
he can go back  to it as soon as he wants to.<br/>
<br/>
Also read Sandra&#39;s page and the links on deschooling:<br/>

There&#39;s also way more to videogames and Facebook than what you&#39;re  <br/>
assuming. Have you done either? That will make them easier to  <br/>
describe *and*, even better, give you a connection with your son.<br/>

<br/>
Are you providing too much to your co-op? Or are they requiring too  <br/>
much? Or are you expecting learning to look a certain way? All of  <br/>
those will get in the way of his learning. You may want to rethink  <br/>
and reinvestigate what you&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a good forum for details of a state&#39;s (or co-op&#39;s) rules  <br/>
since it&#39;s an international list. Try:<br/>

Also try typing your state into the search at:<br/>

to see if someone made a group.<br/>
<br/>
Schools are constrained to teaching methods which provide feedback  <br/>
that something is sticking long enough to be tested. The feedback is  <br/>
not part of learning. The feedback, in many cases, not only  <br/>
interferes with learning but prevents schools from using methods that  <br/>
are natural to the way humans learn. You might try reading:<br/>
