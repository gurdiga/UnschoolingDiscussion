Why do anything? Talking is enough. We don&#39;t necessarily need to react<br/>
to our emotions. If your son is angry wouldn&#39;t it serve him especially,<br/>
and his sister to talk with each other about their feelings and come to<br/>
some sort of compromise/solution and/or to just let each other know how<br/>
they are affecting each others lives? Then they could smile or hug and<br/>
get on with things. Michele<br/>
