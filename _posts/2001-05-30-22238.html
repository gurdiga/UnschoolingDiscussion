<br/>
What city or state is this in?  I have a friend that my many<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling friends have just been unable to convert to our<br/>
way of thinking.  Her mind is made up.  She is moving to Portland to put<br/>
her 6 year old daughter into the Waldorf school up there.  I hope it&#39;s a<br/>
good one and I hope this works out for her.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s my impression of at least one or two of the charters here too, <br/>
that they were started by homeschooling families and that mostly <br/>
previously homeschooled kids are going there. I think they can and do <br/>
work (at least in some instances) and will probably improve over time <br/>
as the idea gains momentum and more options are available. Also, when <br/>
you&#39;re talking about schools where mostly homeschoolers attend, I&#39;d <br/>
have to guess that those kids always have the option to *not* be <br/>
there and as some have pointed out, that is probably the biggest <br/>
determining factor of whether or not any educational option is useful.<br/>
<br/>
The big issue that is brought up about schools being compulsory is <br/>
probably a moot point for many children anyways. Schools are <br/>
basically subsidized daycare for many kids - both of their parents <br/>
work and so they need to be *somewhere*. If the quality of <br/>
the &quot;somewhere&quot; improves so that kids at least have choices about <br/>
what they want to learn and when, well that would be a big <br/>
improvement over what is happening for most kids right now where they <br/>
have no power at all. <br/>
