<div id="ygrps-yiv-840512440">First one: <br/>
  We were at a bar-b-q party and a 5 yr old friend dug into the cooler, pulled out a coke-a-cola and asked his Ma could he have it.  <br/>
 She said, &quot;Heavens no, especially with that chocolate cake on your plate.&quot;  <br/>
 She then looked at me asking, &quot;How do you do it?&quot;<br/>
 I told her, &quot;I don&#39;t restrict what my kids eat,&quot; and pointed to their plates.   XuMei had watermelon, strawberries, green beans and chocolate cake on her plate.  Xander had chosen salmon, corn on the cob, watermelon, strawberries and a root beer to drink. <br/>
 Later I was telling Chris (my spouse) the story and Xander, who I thought was asleep in the back of the van, perked up and said, &quot;The trick is, there is no trick.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Second one:<br/>
 At a second party the next day a Mom friend was having an upset tummy and she asked XuMei what she might do to feel better.  XuMei said whenever her tummy hurts it&#39;s one of two things: either she is hungry or she needs to poop. The Mom friend was impressed because she felt the cause of her upset tummy was having over eaten the desserts at the potluck.  She commented to me how great it was that XuMei had such a healthy relationship to food.  XuMei has no need to over eat. <br/>
