<div id="ygrps-yiv-341128733">Some moms or dads *need* to work in order to eat and provide shelter, most<br/>
*need* to work in order to pay their bills.  Bills that they have because<br/>
they *wanted* to have a bigger house, newer car, name brand clothes, and<br/>
gadgets that were bought on credit cards.  My point is that those purchases<br/>
are *choices*, choices they made knowing that two incomes would be needed in<br/>
order to keep up that lifestyle.  One can also choose to live below their<br/>
income level so that one parent could stay home with children when they<br/>
arrive.<br/>
<br/>
We have a very low standard of living, if you go by government levels, but<br/>
we never want for anything.  We choose not to eat out, go to movies, buy<br/>
expensive clothes, or give expensive gifts, among other things.  We *do*<br/>
have plenty of healthful food, clothes on our bodies, and lots of free<br/>
things to do.  There is nothing wrong with having a low standard of living,<br/>
so I really don&#39;t feel too sorry for the people you mentioned.  I know one<br/>
can live quite fine at poverty level!<br/>
<br/>
 In addition, with the increased computer industry, it is becoming easier<br/>
for parents to find a job that allows them to be at home most or all of the<br/>
time.  It might not be easy, but it is possible.<br/>
<br/>
I do not have a &quot;harsh, judgemental attitude&quot; towards working moms.  I am<br/>
calling a wrong a wrong.  It is wrong to leave babies and children in the<br/>
care of others in order to pursue ones own desires.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything you would call wrong?  Murder?  Thievery? Pollution?<br/>
Anything?  Are you being judgemental  when you call a behavior wrong?  Think<br/>
about that before you start throwing labels around.<br/>

working? <br/>
<br/>
Or can you think of another way to solve the problem? I can envision changes<br/>
in the workplace to allow families to be together. :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Better social security and removing the stigma atached to it may <br/>
help a little.   It will at least enable Mom&#39;s who would normally <br/>
HAVE to work to keep food on the table to stay home and raise <br/>
their children.<br/>
<br/>
In Australia there is what is called &quot;Supporting Parents Benefit&quot;, <br/>
any single parent male or female with the sole care of a <br/>
child/children under 16 years of age is entitled to it, along with free <br/>
health and dental care.  It is sometimes abused by girls wanting a <br/>
meal ticket, but it is mostly a good thing.   Also for low income <br/>
families with only one parent working there are other benefits which <br/>
enable the Mother [or Father] to stay home and parent their <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
There will always be money hungry people who put their children <br/>
last and often regard them as an inconvenience to be tolerated until <br/>
the can get rid of them, but at least if Moms who wanted to be <br/>
home were able to it would make a huge difference.<br/>
