<div id="ygrps-yiv-348255654">Hello to all,<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed my 4 year old daughter biting her nails a lot over the last few months. At first, when she started, I thought it was a phase that would pass- like her older sister went through. Now though, it seems to be getting more frequent and I&#39;m wondering what other unschooling families experiences have been with this habit.<br/>
<br/>
I have always associated nail-biting as a nervous habit. Not sure where that comes from. But it makes me think of close friends I had in grammar school and high school that wished they could stop, but couldn&#39;t. They weren&#39;t even aware that they were doing it, and did not like the physical appearance of their bitten down nails. My best friend today of 17 years has that nail-bitten look and I have NEVER seen her bite her nails. She says she doesn&#39;t even know when she does it, let alone can she figure out how to stop.<br/>
<br/>
When my 6 year old daughter starting biting her nails a few years ago, yep about the same age as my youngest who nail bites now, I was concerned that maybe I was missing something. I spoke with a very helpful counselor over the phone who suggested I try sleep-talking; talking to her while she&#39;s asleep to let her know that I am here for her if she has something stressful going on in her life that I don&#39;t know about. I did sleep-talk with her a few times and, low and behold, she stopped. Just like night and day.<br/>
<br/>
These days, with my youngest daughter starting up with nail biting, I question my motives. I think the sleep-talking thing might work, but that would be me assuming that she is biting her nails due to some unknown stress. And honestly, in the wee hours of the night when I should be doing it, I forget. I only remember her nail biting when I see it throughout the day.<br/>
<br/>
I am concerned for my daughter now, not so much because I think it is a bad habit (although I admit it is hard to shake that association), but because she is starting to hurt herself and often makes herself uncomfortable because she cannot seem to stop. A few months ago she used to also bite her toenails. I was concerned about that because we live rurally and keep chickens and other animals and sometimes the girls go outside barefoot, even though I ask them not to, explain the risks and always have a variety of shoes for them to wear, from flip flops to rubber boots. So the thought of her sticking her toe in her mouth at any moment really worried me.<br/>
<br/>
Not too long after she started she got a really bad infected in-grown toe nail. It was painful, woke her up at night, we had to drain it because the pressure was so bad. It took a long time to heal but she got over it. We talked about how clipping those annoying hang nails and snagged ends is a safer way to go then biting them off. She was cured of biting her toe nails after that.<br/>
<br/>
She continues to bite her finger nails. She often makes herself bleed and wants a bandaid because it hurts when she has bitten too far down the nail or has torn of a hang nail. I keep bandaids around the house and have bought more nail clippers to have handy when she finds an annoying nail. I have noticed that she will ask me every once in a while to clip an annoying nail, but most of the time she prefers to take care of it herself by biting it. I also offer to clip when I see her biting, sometimes she accepts sometimes she declines.<br/>
<br/>
There are times when it is inconvenient as well. We will be transitioning from one thing to another (like hopping out of a taxi - we don&#39;t own a car and this happens alot!) and she will insist that we wait until she&#39;s finished biting her nail. We settle down to read sometimes at night, or watch a movie and I can&#39;t help but be aware of the almost manic way she attacks those nails during our quiet, mellow time. Honestly, it stresses me out.<br/>
<br/>
We have been unschooling for a year now and I am interested in learning how I can better support my daughter during this time.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your responses.<br/>

It&#39;s one thing to have a little personal irritating habit, but to ask  <br/>
other people to wait while I finished picking a scab or picking my  <br/>
nose or something would be way, way rude.  And when it involves  <br/>
someone who&#39;s at work, either making or losing money while I was  <br/>
saying &quot;Wait, I&#39;m doing something disgusting&quot; that&#39;s not at all cool.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has bit her nails, bitten her toenails, and as she got older she  <br/>
figured out her own ways not to do it, because she didn&#39;t want to do it.<br/>
<br/>
If you create an adversarial relationship and make it about your  <br/>
motherly stress, you make a situation where you own her nails and her  <br/>
thoughts, and that&#39;s bad.  If it&#39;s set up so that you win if she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t bite nails, and she wins if she does bite them, then you both  <br/>
lose bigtime.<br/>

<br/>
How does that really matter, though, when it touches on people outside  <br/>
the family?  If she&#39;s at the counter at the bank and they say &quot;next&quot;  <br/>
and the daughter says &quot;Wait, I need to finish biting my nails,&quot; or it  <br/>
they&#39;re waiting in the line at a theatre or a ski lift or they&#39;re at  <br/>
church for communion?<br/>
<br/>
When the nail biting is in private, then it&#39;s about the child&#39;s  <br/>
feelings.  When it&#39;s in public and she&#39;s asking others to put their  <br/>
lives, courtesy and livelihoods on pause, it&#39;s a whole different issue.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids pick their noses a lot, or play with their genitalia.    <br/>
That&#39;s one question in private, and another entirely at a picnic.<br/>

<br/>
  the reason i asked is because if the child is fairly easily redirected  then great - that&#39;s easy.  but if there&#39;s an *intense* attachment and huge reaction to not having agreement to wait for her to finish, that might be a signal that there is something else going on with her that needs more sensitivity...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If it is a nervous habit, perhaps she would be able to do something else<br/>
with her hands.  It&#39;s possible you could find a little thing that she<br/>
could hold onto, roll between her fingers, a ring, or a bracelet, or<br/>
something to fidget with instead of biting.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, sometimes it isn&#39;t a nervous habit.  Margaux started<br/>
biting her nails as soon as she had 2 top and 2 bottom teeth, just<br/>
barely showing.  I was never able to clip her nails as a baby because of<br/>
that.  When she was really tiny, I&#39;d do it when she was sleeping, but as<br/>
soon as those teeth came in, she&#39;d get to them first.  She&#39;s been biting<br/>
her nails every since, fingers and toes.  I help her keep her feet<br/>
clean, even if it means washing them myself with a warm wash rag.  She&#39;s<br/>
almost 8, and I don&#39;t see this changing anytime soon.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of focusing on changing her habit, I help her to remember to<br/>
keep her hands and feet clean.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;She was cured of biting her toe nails after that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Being cured suggests that she was ill to begin with.  Don&#39;t make nail<br/>
biting a disease.  It&#39;s a habit, a grooming habit if you will.  There<br/>
are other ways to keep nails trimmed, but nail biting is one way in<br/>
which it&#39;s done.  I was a nail biter and thumb sucker as a child.  It<br/>
was physically uncomfortable to have any white parts of nail growing out<br/>
beyond where the nail was stuck down onto the skin.  I really couldn&#39;t<br/>
handle that sensation and clippers and nail scissors wouldn&#39;t get that<br/>
close, the way I needed it to be.  By the time I was about 14, I decided<br/>
on my own to stop biting my nails and let them grow.  I dealt with the<br/>
physical discomfort because it was my choice to do so, I pushed past it<br/>
and found a way to let my nails grow.  I keep my nails trimmed.  I don&#39;t<br/>
like them long, but I&#39;m also happy that I don&#39;t get hang nails anymore<br/>
like I did when I bit my nails.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, that is why I found such peace when I stopped mentioning it, and just concentrated on actions like having clippers available and helping her wash her hands (and feet, when she was biting toe nails). I don&#39;t want to shame her which is why I want to respond consciously and brought it up for discussion. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice to hear that there are people that have stopped when they have wanted to. But I do want to get to the place where it doesn&#39;t matter to me whether she stops or not. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Lyla,<br/>
<br/>
 Sabina can be extremely stubborn. So when I say &quot;okay, hop out now please&quot; and she resists, I know that reaching to pick her up against her will can make a difficult situation. Sometimes she is easy-going and will either finish up really quick or just drop it and move on. I need to read every situation because it depends on her reaction.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering, Sandra, what you think about spending an extra 30 seconds or one minute in the cab so she can &quot;do her thing&quot; (now, it&#39;s not really about her biting her nails, but more about not being forced into anything) and then happily hopping out then being worried about the cab driver losing money or becoming impatient and picking her up which could mean even more time in the stopped car because she&#39;s squirming or yelling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So do you think suggesting that this be done in private is helpful? My older daughter is seriously into picking her nose any time, any place. I feel like I&#39;ve been nagging her about. I try to just offer her a tissue or ask her to stop when we are with other people, but I wonder if suggesting that she take of it in private would be helpful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you for that. I will be more aware of the way that I think about her nail biting- as a habit and not a disease. <br/>
<br/>
I have a new habit. My forever-straight hair has just started to get a few waves and, dare I might say, a little curl. I LOVE to twirl it right at the spot where it is started to curl to get it a bit curlier. It&#39;s fun, it&#39;s relaxing and it makes me feel good because I like this new physical sensation of having hair with body! Now I see how my daughter might feel about her nail biting. It feels good (most of the time, anyway), fulfills a need, and I could go so far as to say it&#39;s fun for her. That helps me be more compassionate and understanding when she needs another bandaid or when I offer to help her wash her hands. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to this list for letting me think all of this &quot;outloud&quot;.<br/>

him an extra $2 for his time.  (That&#39;s assuming an extra minute or  <br/>
less was needed).<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards,  I might explain to my daughter why the cab driver&#39;s time  <br/>
is valuable to him and that I felt it was necessary to thank him for  <br/>
waiting.   The next time we were in a cab I&#39;d remind her as we neared  <br/>
our destination that we need to be ready to hop out.<br/>

unschooling that other people not at all involved directly in their  <br/>
unschooling decisions should be inconvenienced or see their kids being  <br/>
what might seem unreasonable or rude.  It&#39;s bad for other  <br/>
unschoolers.  It&#39;s bad for those kids.  It&#39;s not great for the family.<br/>
<br/>
When I took a young Holly to a carpet store and let her pick a carpet  <br/>
pattern, that impressed a guy and he made some money off it.  When we  <br/>
let our kids decide yes or no about restaurant desserts, that  <br/>
impressed people (though it rarely made them any money).<br/>
<br/>
-= Afterwards, I might explain to my daughter why the cab driver&#39;s time<br/>
is valuable to him and that I felt it was necessary to thank him for<br/>
waiting. The next time we were in a cab I&#39;d remind her as we neared<br/>
our destination that we need to be ready to hop out.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Would she need an explanation?  Shouldn&#39;t all kids old enough to say  <br/>
&quot;Wait a minute&quot; know that other people&#39;s time and preferences count,  <br/>
especially when they own the vehicle/building?  Should any child need  <br/>
an explanation for why a parent thanked someone else? Thanking people  <br/>
as a matter of course all the time is self-explanatory.   If I say  <br/>
&quot;Thanks for your patience&quot; to someone who was patient with my child&#39;s  <br/>
decision-making or money-counting or questions, the child will know  <br/>
why I said thanks just for having been there.<br/>

I was in a few cabs with Schuyler&#39;s family last month.  I needed to be  <br/>
told when we were near our destination because I was so busy looking  <br/>
around at buildings and cars and people and sculptures.  It&#39;s a common  <br/>
bit of information, when people are using cabs or busses or trains  <br/>
that the next block or the next stop is the one.<br/>
<br/>
Same for unschoolers as anyone, on that.<br/>

Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
But if someone brings us food and I say, in front of my daughter,  <br/>
&quot;Thanks for this!  This is great.  We were getting hungry,&quot; then if  <br/>
the person leaves and I explain to Holly that I felt it necessary to  <br/>
thank the person for bringing us food, and it was great, because we  <br/>
were hungry,&quot; she won&#39;t listen to me much in the times to come (if she  <br/>
listened that time) because I&#39;m repeating myself.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not understanding why people think unschoolers somehow should be  <br/>
treated differently by cab drivers, or feel that they have the right  <br/>
to treat cab drivers differently because of being unschoolers.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone needs to be treated differently because they are  <br/>
unschooling.   My kids do sometimes need a bit of interpretation or  <br/>
support though, depending on how old (or mature) they are.  My son  <br/>
used to miss social cues a lot.  He&#39;s quite a bit better at that stuff  <br/>
now but he needed, for example to be told not to stand too close when  <br/>
talking to people or not to dominate the conversation.  He just didn&#39;t  <br/>
read people&#39;s cues that they were uncomfortable or couldn&#39;t figure out  <br/>
why they were.  So we&#39;d try to point it out, matter of factly,  <br/>
sometimes privately so he wouldn&#39;t feel the extra stress of being  <br/>
embarrassed about it but sometimes right at the moment so he could fix  <br/>
it and go on with more success.  I know at age 9 he would have been  <br/>
oblivious for the need to hurry out of a cab (or off of a bus) , This  <br/>
is not because he unschools.  He definitely had these issues before we  <br/>
came to unschooling  but unschooling gave me the ability to be there  <br/>
when things were difficult for him and point things out that might  <br/>
help him.   Perhaps the nail biting child also has such a need.   <br/>
Perhaps not.<br/>

<br/>
Right, and that&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s a huge range between slap a kid and say &quot;MOVE,&quot; and tell  <br/>
the cab driver to wait a minute while he&#39;s through with something of  <br/>
questionable value even to himself (nail biting, or whatever).<br/>
<br/>
If a kid&#39;s playing a gameboy and the game can&#39;t be easily paused, the  <br/>
parent should give him enough notice to pause so he can exit the cab  <br/>
quickly.<br/>
