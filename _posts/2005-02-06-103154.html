I just  had a thought of starting a homeschooling program to where we<br/>
could bring  in a student from the country we&#39;re learning about that<br/>
year and really get  submerged in to the language. <br/>

I like your entrepeneur spirit!!! This is a great idea.  From what I  read, <br/>
you are actually doing an &quot;exchange student&quot; in reverse.  The student  would <br/>
come with the purpose of speaking his native language and absorbing  America <br/>
through home education families instead of ps.  Is your  organization already <br/>
formed?  If so, please email me the FAQ&#39;s.  If  you are still in the planning <br/>
stages, please keep me on your mailing list.<br/>
