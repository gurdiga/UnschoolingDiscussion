&lt;&lt; Are you saying that because it&#39;s compulsory, it&#39;s a good thing?<br/>
There are many states that make school attendance compulsory, but there are<br/>
about as many (such as CT, where we are) that do not make attendance<br/>
compulsory. What effect does either situation have? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
All the answers to your question were in the paragraph you quoted.<br/>
<br/>
Reading is much more than sounding out the words.<br/>
<br/>
I had written in response to some discussion about whether school is better <br/>
for some children than their homes are that it would have been better for me, <br/>
and (I quote me):<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&gt; If it weren&#39;t compulsory lots of those theoretical or real bad parents<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; wouldn&#39;t LET their kids go.  If the kids just wanted to go the parents would<br/>
&gt; say no.  Because lots of parents think saying no is being a good parent.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
