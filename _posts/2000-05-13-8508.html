<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We here in NE are supposed to give either the name 
of a major publisher if we are using the whole curriculum (i.e. Abeka), or else 
give an outline of every book for every subject.&nbsp; HA!&nbsp; There is no way 
I am going to tie myself to that nonsense, so I list things like &quot;self-directed 
research in various aspects of biological science&quot; (we dissect body organs after 
butchering) and &quot;student guided reading including biographies, local and 
American history&quot;.&nbsp; I guess they are impressed with my outline because in 
four years we have never even been questioned.</font></div>
