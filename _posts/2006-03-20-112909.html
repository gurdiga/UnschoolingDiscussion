<div id="ygrps-yiv-822944171">Hello,<br/>
Forgive me for this (and for the length) but my mind wants to organize<br/>
and make lists in order to understand.  So, I found myself this morning<br/>
doodling out a list of what I&#39;ve gleaned from unschooling lists, Joyce&#39;s<br/>
site, Sandra&#39;s site, etc, trying to make sense of it all.  What I would<br/>
love to do is present my list to y&#39;all and hope you&#39;ll tell me where<br/>
I&#39;ve gone astray and/or where there are holes.  So, here it is:<br/>
<br/>
Principles of Unschooling<br/>
<br/>
1- Let go and Trust<br/>
-Let go of learning, as a focus, a concern, an issue -trust that it<br/>
happens<br/>
-Let go of control of your child -trust they know what they need<br/>
-Some examples: no chores, no bedtimes, no eating controls, no limits on<br/>
media<br/>
<br/>
2- Joy and Connection as Primary Goals<br/>
-Parent&#39;s job (since it isn&#39;t the controller of the child) is something<br/>
like being the Provider of Joy.  When in doubt, go for the option that<br/>
offers the most joy<br/>
-Family Relationships.  Make deposits here, not withdrawals.<br/>
Relationships based on respecting needs and interests, empathy and fun<br/>
together. Being each others allies not adversaries.  <br/>
<br/>
3- Being a Better Person<br/>
-Principles over Rules - you must model principles (rather than enforce<br/>
rules) therefore you must LIVE them (which makes you a better person).  <br/>
Some examples: Freedom, Golden Rule, Kindness, Respect<br/>
-Staying in the Moment - mindfulness, play, connection, and joy all<br/>
happen in the present moment, not the future (worry) nor the past<br/>
(fears).  Kids are already the masters of this so learn from them.<br/>
Childhood is not a preparation for life, it IS life.<br/>
-Being someone they want to spend time with<br/>
<br/>
4- Tools for Daily Life<br/>
-Create a Rich Environment:  strew stuff they might like (but don&#39;t be<br/>
attached to them liking it)<br/>
-Ride the Waves:  of interests and passions (yours and theirs), as well<br/>
as the flow of the day<br/>
-Follow Your Heart: and encourage them to follow theirs.  <br/>
-Creative Brainstorming:  about any situation until everyone&#39;s needs can<br/>
be met as well as possible<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve got.  Where am I missing the boat?  So far this<br/>
learning has been so exciting and good for our family.  Can&#39;t wait to<br/>
keep going...<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

<br/>
* Have fun! I can&#39;t tell you how many times one of the neighbor kids <br/>
has asked us a &quot;Why?&quot; sort of question about our lives and received <br/>
the simple and profound answer: &quot;For fun!&quot; It&#39;s the best reason of all.<br/>
<br/>
* Examine critically all thoughts and statements that begin with &quot;I <br/>
should&quot;. They tend to signal society&#39;s voices in your head rather than <br/>
your own and can usually be discarded completely.<br/>

<br/>
When I make lists I lose them.  Maybe I&#39;ll lift yours to my newly-building page for new (and <br/>
considering) unschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
I hope at some point it becomes so much a part of the fabric of your lives and yourselves that <br/>
making lists would seem superfluous.  But some people are natural-born list makers, and <br/>
that&#39;s good. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

made, when I looked through these earlier today).   It&#39;s not good for  <br/>
a family that&#39;s had rules to drop them suddenly.  It confuses the  <br/>
kids, and robs the mom of a hundred chances to go &quot;Hmmm.... Sure!   <br/>
Why not?&quot; and keeps the kids from those hundred joyous moments.<br/>
<br/>
Better to move toward it somewhat gradually, humorously and merrily  <br/>
than to just say one day &quot;Eat anything and everything, and never go  <br/>
to sleep.&quot;  That&#39;s not comfortable.<br/>

dad, but a dad) said about something philosophical we were discussing  <br/>
by phone one day a couple of years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Lyle is doing well!  His family moved to a little mining town in  <br/>
Utah, and he&#39;s selling gel stoves here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ventless-gel-fireplace.com/">http://ventless-gel-fireplace.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
He had quit a job in beer marketting/advertising/something, to build  <br/>
decks a couple of years ago.   He stepped backwards off a deck and  <br/>
torqued his back pretty badly.  He lived on the couch for a while.   <br/>
But now he lives in Utah.<br/>
<br/>
He posted a couple of things at unschooling.info last week!  (maybe  <br/>
two weeks, but recently)<br/>
<br/>
For those wondering who the heck &quot;Lyle&quot; is,&quot; here are links to a few  <br/>
little things he wrote:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lyleperry">http://sandradodd.com/lyleperry</a><br/>

He&#39;s someone with two teenaged boys who&#39;s unschooled them for several  <br/>
years, and who wrote about unschooling in a unique, happy kind of way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852745865">Great list :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -Let go of control of your child -trust they know what they need<br/>
&gt; -Some examples: no chores, no bedtimes, no eating controls, no  <br/>
&gt; limits on<br/>
&gt; media<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it might be helpful to write them in terms of what they&#39;re  <br/>
replaced with and that the goal is to help them explore their world  <br/>
joyfully.<br/>
<br/>
- Assume responsibility for chores and ask for help as you might of a  <br/>
friend but knowing that no is an acceptable answer.<br/>
<br/>
- Replace *arbitrary* bedtimes with wind down time in the evening.  <br/>
Help the kids transition to bed when they&#39;re tired and help them  <br/>
become aware of what their bodies are saying. (But how to get in the  <br/>
idea that they may want to explore staying up all night but that  <br/>
staying up every night and being grumpy all day for more than a few  <br/>
days means helping them figure out a balance without imposing rules  <br/>
again?)<br/>
<br/>
- It&#39;s harder to summarize the eating controls since it takes so many  <br/>
forms: &quot;good&quot; vs &quot;bad&quot; food, nutrition, location, time! Focus on  <br/>
hunger being the body&#39;s signal that it needs food and be their  <br/>
partner in meeting that need :-) Drop controls on what, where and  <br/>
when and replace it with nutritious snacks that are as easy to grab  <br/>
as convenience snacks are. (But how to get in the idea of  <br/>
brainstorming problem solving: eg, there are more solutions to  <br/>
drinking grape juice in the living room besides living with stains  <br/>
and saying no. There are more solutions to dishes left everywhere  <br/>
besides living with it and saying no. And how to get in the idea that  <br/>
we need to explore what we think is necessary: everyone sitting down  <br/>
to dinner is a separate idea from eating when you&#39;re hungry.)<br/>
<br/>
- Help them find what they would like to see and avoid what they  <br/>
won&#39;t like. (But how to get in the idea of  being their partner in  <br/>
their explorations so that they are more powerful than the media?  <br/>
There are more options than letting them pop in a horror movie  <br/>
because the cover looked cool and saying no that&#39;s too scary.)<br/>

<br/>
My goodness, I haven&#39;t posted on this list in so long, I can&#39;t even <br/>
remember when the last time was!  A lot has happened which I won&#39;t <br/>
bore you with but, I read this post this morning and just had to say <br/>
something.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I&#39;m responding to this particular quote because food, <br/>
bedtime, and TV have always been my hot buttons and I wanted to <br/>
share with you some things I&#39;ve discovered with my daughter (who is <br/>
soon to be 5).  <br/>
<br/>
I suppose a lot of what I do with my own daughter is because I don&#39;t <br/>
want her to grow up with the same &quot;hang ups&quot; about food (&quot;you better <br/>
eat everything on your plate&quot; which I still struggle with), TV (and <br/>
how it rots your brain), and bedtimes (I used to lay awake for hours <br/>
because I wasn&#39;t tired).  My response to ensure my daughter didn&#39;t <br/>
grow up that way was extreme to most of the people I knew at the <br/>
time.  I let her tell me when she was hungry (and full), when she <br/>
was tired, ect from the day she was born.  At the time, I didn&#39;t <br/>
know that was called &quot;Unschooling&quot; I just knew that it worked for us.<br/>
<br/>
We (my husband, daughter, and I) very rarely eat all together.  I <br/>
don&#39;t like the traditional breakfast and usually eat a sandwhich or <br/>
something.  My daughter hates to eat when she first wakes up so I <br/>
usually end up making her something late morning, when she tells me <br/>
she is hungry.  Sometimes it eggs and bacon, sometimes it mac and <br/>
cheese and a hot dog. :) Since I ate earlier, I&#39;m hungry at <br/>
the &quot;normal&quot; lunch time.  While I&#39;m making myself something, she&#39;ll <br/>
usually say &quot;I&#39;m not hungry yet, mommy.&quot;  So I tell her to just let <br/>
me know when she is and we&#39;ll get her something.  I sometimes have <br/>
to ask because she&#39;s so busy playing and running around that she <br/>
doesn&#39;t always remember until she STARVING!!  When she does realize <br/>
she&#39;s hungry, she tells me what she wants, we fix it, she&#39;ll take it <br/>
to her room or the living room (where ever she happens to be <br/>
playing) and eat it on the go.  I hate forcing her to sit at the <br/>
table and eat everything until her plate is clean.  Dinner is <br/>
usually when I try to have us all sit down together.  However, a lot <br/>
of times, my daughter is not hungry so she sits next to her daddy <br/>
and shares her day with him.  Then she&#39;s off and running and will <br/>
come to be and tell me when she&#39;s ready to eat.  My family thinks I <br/>
am crazy but, I&#39;m not the one fighting with my kids every night <br/>
at &quot;dinner time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As for the TV, she is like me in that way.  I like to have noise on <br/>
in the background though a lot of times, I&#39;m paying no attention to <br/>
it at all.  She has a TV in her room and it&#39;s usually on all day.  <br/>
However, she is not sitting in front of it like a robot.  She <br/>
watches it when something interesting comes on and doesn&#39;t other <br/>
times.  Again, my family members can&#39;t believe I let her have a TV <br/>
in her room.  &quot;If I let (fill in the blank) have a TV in her room, <br/>
all she would do is watch TV all day and night.&quot;  When I tell them <br/>
that&#39;s not the case with us, they simply don&#39;t believe me.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never had a set bedtimes.  My daughter used to go to bed late <br/>
and get up late.  I like to go to bed early and wake up early.  When <br/>
I was ready for bed, I would say &quot;Ok, mommy is going to lay down.&quot; <br/>
and I would lay down on the couch while she was still playing.  She <br/>
would pat me on the head when she was ready for bed and we would go <br/>
up together.  However, that got old quick because she didn&#39;t have me <br/>
to play with.  She would ask me to play with her and I would <br/>
say &quot;No, mommy is tired so I&#39;m not going to play but, you can stay <br/>
up and play if you want.&quot;  These days, she&#39;s going to bed earlier at <br/>
about 9pm or so but, I suppose her bed times will change as she <br/>
does.  :)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s long winded enough for now.  :)  I hope this helps you in <br/>
your journey to Unschooling.<br/>

All my kids have TVs in their rooms.  No... Holly took hers out when  <br/>
the VHS player broke, and it&#39;s in a corner in the front room now,  <br/>
unused.  She has a computer.  So do the other two kids, just since  <br/>
last year for the younger two.<br/>
<br/>
Hours, whole days go by with those rooms quiet, with one of the kids  <br/>
in there drawing or listening to music at the most, or playing with  <br/>
lego while a familiar movie is on, and they&#39;ll look up at their  <br/>
favorite parts, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Our house is really very peaceful.  A house full of &quot;no&quot; can&#39;t begin  <br/>
to be this peaceful.<br/>

Just a funny note on the computer thing.  My daughter has started <br/>
really getting into playing games online.  She goes to the Disney <br/>
website and they have games the kids can play to match the TV shows as <br/>
well as coloring pages she can print out and color.  She told me the <br/>
other day that I needed to put Noggin (spelled correctly?) on favoites <br/>
so that she can find it easier (&quot;just like Nana does mommy&quot;)!  Oh my <br/>
goodness!!  Computers still took up whole rooms when I was her age and <br/>
I STILL don&#39;t use favorites for my websites!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336897478">Thanks you everyone who commented on my list!  I envisioned it as a kind<br/>
of cheat sheet for myself, something to put on the fridge to keep the<br/>
whole picture in mind as often as possible as I digest it all. As a<br/>
cheat sheet, I&#39;m leaving the tv/food/chores portion un-fleshed out,<br/>
though Joyce&#39;s comments on this section are fabulous and true.  If this<br/>
list were to be used for more general consumption then fleshing out<br/>
those points does seem important.  I added more FUN (good point!) and<br/>
remembered the &#39;turn have-tos into choose-tos&#39; tool, and also added<br/>
BREATHING DEEPLY.  I also tried to get a little more of what Joyce was<br/>
talking about creative brainstorming-that there are always more options<br/>
than the knee-jerk part of me thinks there are... so here is my current<br/>
shorthand Essence of Unschooling for the Fridge List...<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Principles of Unschooling<br/>
 <br/>
1- Let go and Trust<br/>
-Let go of learning, as a focus, a concern, an issue -trust that it<br/>
happens<br/>
-Let go of trying to control your child -trust they know what they need.<br/>
Especially look at The Big Five favorite parental control areas: Chores,<br/>
Sleep, Food, Media, & Personal Hygiene <br/>
 <br/>
2- Primary Goals: Joy, Connection, Fun <br/>
-Parent&#39;s job (since it isn&#39;t the controller of the child) is to be the<br/>
Provider of Joy.  When in doubt, go for the option that offers the most<br/>
joy.  Ask &quot;Is this Fun?&quot; and if the answer is no, question doing it.<br/>
-Turn &#39;I have to&#39; into &#39;I choose to&#39; wherever you notice you aren&#39;t<br/>
having fun or are sulking, blaming, or being grumpy to yourself or your<br/>
family<br/>
-Pursue excellent family relationships.  Make deposits here, not<br/>
withdrawals. Relationships based on respecting everyone&#39;s needs and<br/>
interests, empathy, and fun together. Be each other&#39;s allies not<br/>
adversaries.  <br/>
 <br/>
3- Become a Better Person<br/>
-Principles over Rules - you must model principles (rather than enforce<br/>
rules) therefore you must LIVE them (which makes you a better person).  <br/>
Some examples: Freedom, Golden Rule, Kindness, Respect<br/>
-Staying in the Moment - mindfulness, play, connection, and joy all<br/>
happen in the present moment, not the future (worry) nor the past<br/>
(fears).  Kids are already the masters of this so learn from them.<br/>
Childhood is not a preparation for life, it IS life.  BREATHE.<br/>
-Be someone they want to spend time with<br/>
 <br/>
4- Tools for Daily Life<br/>
-Create a Rich Environment:  strew stuff they might like (but don&#39;t be<br/>
attached to them liking it)<br/>
-Ride the Waves:  of interests and passions (yours and theirs), as well<br/>
as the flow of the day<br/>
-Follow Your Heart: and encourage them to follow theirs.  <br/>
-Creative Brainstorming:  about any situation until everyone&#39;s needs can<br/>
be met as well as possible.  There is always a third (and fourth and<br/>
fifth) option to disaster and saying NO to your child.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I want to dissect that one a little bit, still. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A three year old probably won&#39;t know he needs a toothbrush, or that  <br/>
there are other flavors of toothpaste, unless his mom helps him.  He  <br/>
might not realize he&#39;s hungry, and if it&#39;s been a few hours, you  <br/>
should probably offer something you know he likes, already prepared,  <br/>
visible and smelling good.  If he opts out, at least you&#39;ll know he  <br/>
really wasn&#39;t hungry.<br/>
<br/>
A kid who&#39;s watching cop dramas because that&#39;s all his dad watches  <br/>
might could use knowing there are lots of choices. &lt;g&gt;  He won&#39;t know  <br/>
what his options are, so parents should help them choose from a rich,  <br/>
broad range.  Somehow the wording of your item seems to leave that out.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could say &quot;Help them know what they need&quot; (no, that&#39;s not  <br/>
it...) or &quot;Assist instead of control.&quot;  That&#39;s better.</div>

Sometimes help is just encouragement or acknowledgment, but sometimes  <br/>
it might need to be transportation or procurement or something physical.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This thread reminded me of a little pretend game I&#39;ve tried in the <br/>
past to help me set aside my worries and live in the moment with my <br/>
children.  It also reminded me of how much my ego can get in the way <br/>
and prevent me from offering the best help.<br/>
<br/>
On occasion I have pretended that I&#39;m a visiting, somewhat eccentric <br/>
aunt who just adores her niece and nephew.   You know the type.  <br/>
She&#39;s the aunt that shows up on your doorstep unannounced, but you <br/>
are still thrilled to see her.  She doesn&#39;t have any children <br/>
herself and isn&#39;t particularly up-to-date on `best&#39; parenting <br/>
practices.  She doesn&#39;t care that the children have dirt under their <br/>
nails, know their manners, or are reading at `grade&#39; level.  For <br/>
that matter, she doesn&#39;t even notice.  She&#39;s too busy helping them <br/>
build Lego&#39;s on the floor.  When dinner is announced, she&#39;s the one <br/>
carrying the kids in on her back making elephant noises.  The day <br/>
ends and she kisses and hugs them goodbye until the next visit.<br/>
<br/>
This helps me separate myself from my own hang ups and helps me <br/>
_assist_ my children without tying my children&#39;s behavior/learning <br/>
to my own ego.  I think when my ego or fear gets wrapped up in it <br/>
all, that&#39;s when assisting turns into controlling or coercion.  An <br/>
aunt loves her children-relatives, but is less likely to tie her ego <br/>
to them.  She can freely bask in their presence and accept and <br/>
appreciate them for who they are in the moment.  She doesn&#39;t worry <br/>
about their futures, how they will get be &#39;successful&#39; adults or <br/>
what kind of reflection that will be on her &#39;aunt-ing&#39; skills. When <br/>
I separate myself, then I am freed up to think of all kinds of <br/>
things to `help them know what THEY need&#39;.  I think more creatively <br/>
with the many possibilities that might interest my children  no <br/>
strings attached (or ego, in this case). :)<br/>

Oh, I like this.  Very true that it is a hands on help, not just &quot;you<br/>
go, girl!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
a family that&#39;s had rules to drop them suddenly. It confuses the <br/>
<br/>
kids, and robs the mom of a hundred chances to go &quot;Hmmm.... Sure! <br/>
<br/>
Why not?&quot; and keeps the kids from those hundred joyous moments.<br/>
<br/>
Better to move toward it somewhat gradually, humorously and merrily than to<br/>
just say one day &quot;Eat anything and everything, and never go to sleep.&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s not comfortable.<br/>

=====================<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, somehow I missed this when I was new to unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
When I finally got to the point of trusting the learning (and my children) I<br/>
changed our lifestyle too suddenly to try and resemble the successful<br/>
unschoolers I know IRL and online.  <br/>
<br/>
I do feel we missed a lot of nice, happy moments that could have been part<br/>
of that process.  I also think my very wonderful and patient husband would<br/>
have been more comfortable with a more gradual transition.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH I still keep finding things about myself and my relationships w/ my<br/>
kids that need more tweaking.  I thought I&#39;d just jump in with both feet.<br/>
And I found we could swim, but it still took a long time for us to be<br/>
graceful in the water.<br/>
