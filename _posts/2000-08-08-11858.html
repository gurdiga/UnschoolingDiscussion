cute... and so true!!! :)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is off topic, but I need 
to ask-- a few months ago, there were some people interested in e-pen pals for 
their kids.&nbsp; I was recently contacted by a sweet young girl, named Kaitlin, 
who lives in Canada, and is 14.&nbsp; She expressed interest in writing to my 2 
nieces that are of similar age, and have many similar hobbies.&nbsp; I 
told&nbsp;Kaitlin I would let her know if my nieces were interested in writing 
the next time I heard from her.&nbsp; Well, since then I have changed my e-mail 
address, and she&nbsp; cannot reach me.&nbsp; So, if anyone on this list is a 
parent of Kaitlin, could you please let her know that my niece, Michelle, would 
love to write her?&nbsp; Also, please tell Kaitlin my new address:&nbsp; <a rel="nofollow"
