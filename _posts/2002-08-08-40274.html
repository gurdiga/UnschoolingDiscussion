One of the many sad results of government schooling is total gullibility.<br/>
<br/>
The forcible prevention of homeschooling is a good example of Fascism in<br/>
action. It is supremely ironic that anyone would give such an excuse for the<br/>
limitation or elimination of individual educational freedoms. It tells us<br/>
just how dishonest government is. The true motive, of course, is total<br/>
control of the population -- the very goal of Fascism -- never an<br/>
enlightened populace.<br/>
<br/>
Germany was once considered the epitome of an educated people. The US<br/>
government sent hundreds of &quot;scholars&quot; (under Horace Mann) over there in the<br/>
19th century to examine its schools and copy the system as the politicians<br/>
planned our universal schooling system.<br/>
<br/>
Prussia, which became Germany, had been badly defeated by Napoleon and the<br/>
reason was that Prussian soldiers were mercenaries (free thinking) while the<br/>
French had been indoctrinated in patriotism and trained to fight, not for<br/>
mere money, but for their fatherland. Germany wanted to emulate the French<br/>
system of turning out good soldiers, not educated citizens.<br/>
<br/>
The Prussian/German schools were designed to teach obedience and uniformity,<br/>
and their goal was to turn out soldiers and factory workers. The result was<br/>
a fine-tuned war machine and an incredibly disciplined, but &quot;inside the box&quot;<br/>
type of thinking and acting. The country was &quot;educated&quot; to become a nation<br/>
so obedient that its government could employ many millions of them in the<br/>
carefully planned murder of six million of mostly its own citizens -- their<br/>
very neighbors. <br/>
<br/>
To this day, no one dreams of jay walking in Germany, even on an empty<br/>
street. As I see it, Germans will need many more generations to overcome<br/>
their unspeakable shame at being such obedient, horrific sheep.<br/>
<br/>
Growing up, I knew a man from Austria who told of the &quot;old (Prussian) army.&quot;<br/>
There, the motto was, &quot;Let the horse think !&quot;  In other words, &quot;Do what<br/>
you&#39;re told -- don&#39;t think for yourself !&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 American politicians, arm in arm with industrial tycoons, wanted just such<br/>
a school system, by which they could fill the factories and military ranks<br/>
with dependable, predictable people. The school system was the government&#39;s<br/>
mechanism for turning a diverse population of independent farmers,<br/>
craftsmen, immigrants and freed slaves into a uniform mass of workers for<br/>
repetitive tasks. The process was the homogenization of America. It&#39;s still<br/>
going on, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Today, that part of the process has the name, &quot;School To Work,&quot; whereby the<br/>
schools act as employment agencies for the students, following orders and<br/>
filling quotas set by the US Dept of Labor, channeling students into certain<br/>
(mostly menial) jobs and giving &quot;Certificates of Mastery&quot; instead of<br/>
academic diplomas to the students who conform. The goal in this is to force<br/>
all children into the system, and re-capture all homeschoolers for the state<br/>
treadmills. Children are seen by the school system as economic &quot;resources&quot;<br/>
to be used for government purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Before about 1840, America&#39;s schools were locally controlled, run by and<br/>
for the benefit of the families and the larger community, and their purpose<br/>
was to make sure that the children learned the basic skills plus, in most<br/>
cases, especially in early New England, the gospel of the major christian<br/>
congregation in town. That was before the Constitution which separated<br/>
church and state.<br/>
<br/>
Gradually, government schooling became the norm. Since everyone was required<br/>
to pay for it, it became more and more accepted, but not without resistance.<br/>
The catholics didn&#39;t like the secular nature of the schools, and wanted<br/>
schools that taught their children according to their beliefs. The schism<br/>
caused the Catholic Riots in Philadelphia, and led to that church setting up<br/>
its own private school system.<br/>
<br/>
Today, the state-run schools are controlled from Washington. Local control<br/>
is now a myth kept alive by lying politicians.  &quot;The Blob&quot; (the name for the<br/>
interlocking education bureaucracy) is still trying to create a homogeneous,<br/>
predictable, obedient mass of workers/spenders/taxpayers who will support<br/>
the millions of unproductive activities that are promoted in the schools and<br/>
elsewhere.   Heck, we can&#39;t have actual educated people when there&#39;s so<br/>
little for them to do -- they&#39;ll go crazy. We need simple-minded people by<br/>
the millions who don&#39;t know what they&#39;re missing and who feel too dumb even<br/>
to teach their kids any more than elementary skills. (That was, in so many<br/>
words, announced by the first US commissioner of education at the turn of<br/>
the 20th century. See JT Gatto&#39;s, &quot;The Guerilla Curriculum)<br/>
<br/>
The states have joined with the teacher unions to produce an almost seamless<br/>
bureaucratic web that controls not just the children, but their families and<br/>
communities. The schools have also become centers for medical &quot;services&quot; and<br/>
psychological intrusions into the personal lives of all citizens. The<br/>
Prussian dream of total control is becoming a reality in America,<br/>
compliments of your local &quot;public&quot; school. And we even pay for it.<br/>

<br/>
Germany doesn&#39;t even fly its own national flag except where the president is. <br/>
 My German friend Wolfgang Marquardt said simply &quot;It makes the neighbors <br/>
nervous.&quot;  There is huge guilt among the German citizenry about the sins of <br/>
their parents.  People not even born until after WWII have spent their whole <br/>
lives feeling criminal.<br/>
<br/>
The culture (not the government) of Germany and Scandinavia is very involved <br/>
with scheduling and cleaning up and cooperation.  To overlay American <br/>
sensibilties on their motives is just ethnocentricism.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It tells us<br/>
just how dishonest government is. The true motive, of course, is total<br/>

<br/>
Is there *ANY* possibility you could take a break from insulting the <br/>
readership here with overblown summaries of the horrors of government and <br/>
schools?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve expanded your history of schools to before the industrial <br/>
revolution.  Now please get clear about how long the constitution had been in <br/>
efffect before 1840.  If, before the constitution, an English colony based on <br/>
a religion had schools which included the teachings of that religion, how are <br/>
you faulting them?    <br/>
<br/>
Maybe there&#39;s a libertarian list on which these rants would be more <br/>
appropriate.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t see it as very welcoming to those investigating homeschooling to<br/>
paint everyone who is not homeschooling as an evil government employee or as<br/>
a gullible soul duped by them. It sets up a wall. Walls are comforting to<br/>
those on the inside. They can provide a sense of comraderie that we&#39;ve<br/>
separated ourselves from the enemy. But walls also say those on the outside<br/>
are not good enough to be one of us.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all -- schoolers and homeschoolers -- just people doing the best we<br/>
can with the information we have. Unschoolers have information about how<br/>
children learn that the rest of the world doesn&#39;t. That doesn&#39;t make us<br/>
superior people. It just means we know something that others don&#39;t. And we<br/>
can use that to help others help their children or use that to bolster our<br/>
own egos for not being as gullible as everyone else.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We just recently moved to Mississippi. I have learned that <br/>
this &quot;school-to-work program&quot; is in force here. I don&#39;t know what <br/>
name they actually call it. One of our neighbors has a daughter that <br/>
was in it. She is not very strong academically so she was put in the <br/>
program that trains you for a job instead of preparing you for <br/>
college. They told her that when she graduates she will not get a <br/>
diploma, but a certificate instead. They also told her that she would <br/>
never be able to go to college. My son and she have become good <br/>
friends. He told her that he thinks that is illegal for them to make <br/>
her go to school for 4 years, let her graduate, but not give her a <br/>
diploma. I tried to talk her mom into homeschooling her, but she <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do it. She is one of those mom&#39;s who can&#39;t stand having her <br/>
kids around. She thinks I am crazy to want to homeschool. However, <br/>
after a few discussions with the daughter, the daughter decided that <br/>
she wanted out of that training program and wants a real diploma so <br/>
that she can go to college. So, she told her counselor at the school <br/>
to change her schedule this year so that she can take academic <br/>
classes instead. They did it. I told her that all sorts of people who <br/>
never even finished high school can go to college. But she believed <br/>
them when they told her that she would not be able to go to college <br/>
without an academic diploma.<br/>

is down at the bottom of every email.)<br/>

What is not fine is someone singling someone else out to tell them you don&#39;t<br/>
like their discussion or posting style. Publicly reprimanding someone for<br/>
how they express themselves *never* leads to anything other than bad<br/>
feelings.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone doesn&#39;t like how a discussion is going you can delete it or<br/>
contribute to it. Let&#39;s attack the ideas not the person or the way they<br/>
express themselves.<br/>

&gt; what he writes to be interesting and backed by his knowledge of history. I <br/>
&gt; do <br/>
&gt; not have to agree with someone entirely in order to recognize persuasive <br/>
&gt; argument presented in an eloquent and witty manner. What I do find <br/>
&gt; insulting <br/>
&gt; is the fact that Sandra feels compelled to pull apart every post he sends <br/>
&gt; (and the posts of many others) in order to find nitpicking faults. I think <br/>
&gt; her suggestion that he find another list to be obnoxious in the extreme. <br/>
&gt; Did <br/>
&gt; I miss the coronation where she became Queen of the List? Perhaps she <br/>
&gt; should <br/>
&gt; seek out the &quot;Get a sense of Humor&quot; or the &quot;Get a Life&quot; lists.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sherry<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have found (and I haven&#39;t even been *here* that long) that certain themes <br/>
seem to come around and around on this list. Here is how it goes.<br/>
1) someone starts posting very strong, argumentative statements and opinions.<br/>
2) the list divides into groups, and the he said, she said crap starts.<br/>
3) eventually someone, or a few someones say Enough!<br/>
4) a few people start crying foul, and eventually someone takes aim at one <br/>
particular person.<br/>
<br/>
When I first joined there was one person like this, she had an argument for <br/>
every topic, an opinion about every person. She never wanted to listen, and <br/>
anytime anyone ever suggested something she didn&#39;t want to hear she blamed it <br/>
all on Sandra. Now, I am not going to defend Sandra, she can do that herself, <br/>
but it amazes me to no end when someone tries this *Its all HER&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fault!* <br/>
argument when things, topics, get out of control like this. <br/>
While I enjoy the off topic debate as much as the next guy, what I come here <br/>
for is the information. Some have said they are leaving because they aren&#39;t <br/>
getting the information about unschooling they thought they were going to get <br/>
here. I wish they would stick around and see that (almost) all we discuss is <br/>
good information. Others get huffy when someone who has been unschooling <br/>
their children years, says *thats not unschooling.* While there are no hard, <br/>
fast rules for unschooling, there are some things that just aren&#39;t <br/>
unschooling, and we have or will find out what those things are. The problem <br/>
with this is that some have been to other lists, I know I have, where there <br/>
is lots of blanket statements made about unschooling. Lots of huggy, <br/>
pat-on-the-back posts. It seems that some (usually people who haven&#39;t done it <br/>
for long, or have read something out of context or generalized something to <br/>
the point of blandness) feel that unschooling is doing whatever works for <br/>
them. This includes unschooling everything but math, doing subjects in the <br/>
morning and unschooling in the afternoon, or what I call *Sunday <br/>
Unschoolers.* People who only unschool when it suits them. If you are doing <br/>
any of those things, that is not unschooling. <br/>
While Ned may very well be right about what problems exist in the public <br/>
education area, some of the information comes across as over sensationalized. <br/>
I have found that as the years go by, I think less and less on terms of <br/>
*school* If, suddenly homeschooling became illegal, I would do it anyway. I <br/>
think many here would as well. I don&#39;t even see us as homeschoolers much <br/>
anymore. (In the sense that homeschool is an adjective for what we do, <br/>
because it isn&#39;t what *we* do.) <br/>
So, if you came here to learn from those who have gone before you then by all <br/>
means, pull up a chair! But please, don&#39;t point fingers because the comfort <br/>
level of what is being offered is beyond what you can take. <br/>

But if you like the Libertarian viewpoint, there are Libertarian lists at<br/>
Yahoo Groups. Only one teeny Libertarian homeschooler list unfortunately :-/<br/>
(I would think Libertarian and homeschooling would be a natural fit! But I<br/>
guess the overlap of two small sets is bound to be a very small set.)**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have it bookmarked, but there is a separation of schools and<br/>
state website that has a pretty strong Libertarian flavor.  They<br/>
advocate eliminating public schooling.  I think I remember that they<br/>
have an email group.  (And I&#39;m probably not telling Ned anything he<br/>
doesn&#39;t already know.)<br/>
