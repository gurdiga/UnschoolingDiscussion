<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469351435">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I posted earlier about my ds (6, almost 7) wanting to read but not being ready yet.  The advice to liken it to learning to ride a bike was great - he happens to be exceptionally talented in sports, and has seen others struggle with sports and then succeed with much more effort/time than he has had to put forth.  Both him and I have become more patient and accepting of his learning to read at his own pace.<br/>
<br/>
He wants to learn how to play the piano, and he specifically wants me to help him.  I don&#39;t know what to do - I feel a big block as to how to help him - not because I don&#39;t know piano (I have my grade 8 conservatory and grade 2 theory), but I think because I&#39;m in the &quot;schooling&#39; mode from my own years and years of lessons. <br/>
<br/>
We have done piano in the past, in a schooly kind of way, where I&#39;ve set up fun exercises for them to do, and we&#39;ve tried to do something every day.  Although I always initiated the &quot;lessons&quot;, he was always keen about everything I did, where his sister disliked most of it.  Through the mixed responses I got, and my inner passion for unschooling (which obviously was not shining through with forcing her when she was losing interest) the &quot;lessons&#39; would drop off and we&#39;d stop doing them.  My ds doesn&#39;t complain, but if I ask him about it, he wants me to teach him and doesn&#39;t want another piano teacher.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so stuck in how I learned how to play piano (lesson once a week, practise every day, learn notes/scales/chords/read music.....) that I&#39;m not sure how to unschool through this.  I mean - how to help him if he wants to play and learn one day, and then leave it for a few days, then play for a few days, and then leave it for a few weeks.   What materials/suggestions/path can I take without turning it into lessons we&#39;ll both not enjoy?<br/>
<br/>
Arrghh - I&#39;m quite stuck, and looking forward to any suggestions!<br/>

Can you make up games, like call a note name and both of you play as many  of <br/>
those as you can?  &quot;B flat!&quot; and race for the Bflats you can  reach?  Maybe <br/>
add another one, so you&#39;re doing chords, like twister.  <br/>
 <br/>
What about just playing chords or basslines to something they play by ear?  <br/>
If they can do a melody, you could improvise another part.  If you&#39;re  <br/>
accustomed to playing always formally by sheetmusic and they see you  improvising, it <br/>
might make improvising and playing by ear seem  more legitimate.   I know I <br/>
suffered from that prejudice as  a kid.  I was really PLAYING piano because I <br/>
was reading music, but my  mom, who was &quot;just&quot; playing tunes and chords, was <br/>
just playing &quot;with&quot; the  piano (I thought) and not really playing it.    There&#39;s <br/>
a  schoolish prejudice.  <br/>
 <br/>
I started playing piano at five, and didn&#39;t start school until a year  later, <br/>
so I read music before I read English, and that has made it really hard  for <br/>
me to explain music reading now.  I don&#39;t really remember learning  it.  I <br/>
just see it and know, and when I try to break it down I  usually leave out <br/>
something important.  <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe you could play things like &quot;name that tune&quot; with them.  Holly  and I <br/>
were doing that the other night.  She was in a rocking chair and I  was at the <br/>
piano, so it wasn&#39;t Holly learning piano, but it was still fun.   I had a <br/>
Sesame Street songbook and would play two, then three, then four notes  until she <br/>
could guess the song.  Maybe they could copy each set of notes  you played, and <br/>
you add a note and they copy that and then soon they recognize  the song.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have done that with kids, just copying a bit they played, or singing  <br/>
something they sang,  and then we turn it around and they copy  me.   It helps them <br/>
know how the instrument (keyboard or voice) works,  to find intervals, even <br/>
without the names of those things being used.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-how to help him if he wants to play and learn one day, and then leave it  <br/>
for a few days, then play for a few days, and then leave it for a few  weeks.  <br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I think quitting for a while and then coming back is fine and  natural.   <br/>
Piano teachers traditionally want their students to advance  quickly so that the <br/>
parents are happy with the cost of the lessons, and so they  can show off how <br/>
much more advanced their students are than some other rival  teacher&#39;s.  <br/>
(Traditionally in the for-centuries-passed way.)<br/>

This came up in e-mail to a friend who&#39;s not involved in unschooling,  <br/>
because of a joke that was going around among friends of ours about finishing  <br/>
things you start:<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  &gt; Subject: inner peace<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am passing this on to you  because it definitely worked for me - and <br/>
&gt; we all could use more calm in  our lives. By following the simple <br/>
&gt; advice I heard on a<br/>
&gt; Dr. Phil  show, I have finally have found inner peace.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dr. Phil  proclaimed the way to achieve inner peace is to finish all <br/>
&gt; the things  you have started. So I looked around my house to see <br/>
&gt; things I started  and hadn&#39;t finished; and, before leaving the house <br/>
&gt; this morning I  finished off a<br/>
&gt; bottle of Merlot, a bottle of White Zinfandel, a bottle  of Baileys, a<br/>
&gt; bottle<br/>
&gt; of Kahlua, a package of Oreos, the  remainder of both Prozac and Valium<br/>
&gt; prescriptions, the rest of the  cheesecake, some Saltines and a box of<br/>
&gt; Chocolates.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You  have no idea how freakin&#39; good I feel.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please pass this on to  those you feel are in need of inner  peace.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>----------------<br/>
 <br/>
I think a lot of people hold in a lot of pain and regret about not  finishing <br/>
things.  I know my husband does.  Every unfinished project  since his <br/>
childhood is on a list of things he should feel bad about.  Poor  guy.  I told him if <br/>
he was having fun and learned something, it was fine  that he put it down <br/>
when he wanted to.  When he quit he WAS done, maybe.  &lt;g&gt;  But with piano, <br/>
quitting for a while isn&#39;t forever.   Picking up again isn&#39;t starting from scratch.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-966761958">Perhaps you could look into the Suzuki method- I know John Holt highly <br/>
recommended it.  Or let your son set himself a schedule for lessons and practice if <br/>
that&#39;s what he wants.  Then you&#39;re not enforcing the teaching, you&#39;d simply be <br/>
an expert he&#39;s choosing to study with.  If he is not resistant to your style <br/>
of teaching, go with it, I say.  But leave out the coercions, rewards, and <br/>
imposed schedules.  Ask him what he wants to get out of playing the piano, and <br/>
teach the tools he needs to reach that goal. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son (8) asked about 4 months ago for me to help him learn to play the piano. I got some index cards and wrote the scales on it. Then I got some colored stickers and put them on the keyboard. On my scales, I wrote the color of the note beneath each note on the scale. I had also bought, a while back, a Christmas song book that was aimed at beginning pianists. So on some later day, I sat down with my son and the book and went through one of the songs, showing him where the notes were on the scale that I had drawn and on the music. Then I left to go swimming. When I came back, he could read the treble clef in the music and was busy teaching himself songs in the book. As he went along over the next few days, he would ask me other questions - what is this 4/4 at the beginning? What is this funny symbol (a flat)? I explained about key signatures, time signatures, sharps and flats. One day I mentioned scales and showed him how to play the C scale and told him that many pianists warm up on scales and use them for finger dexterity and strength. For awhile, he practiced that scale every day until he could play it with both hands together. Then he asked me to teach him the D scale, and now he&#39;s working on E. He still isn&#39;t interested in learning the left hand, but he has learned some chords and sometimes plays those with a song. <br/>
<br/>
Basically, he&#39;s picking it up in fits and starts, he plays when he wants to and doesn&#39;t play when he doesn&#39;t want to - sometimes 2 hours a day, sometimes not at all for days. I bought some more books of music (we were all getting tired of the Christmas songs) and he has been going through some of the songs in those. This is the way he loves to learn things - totally self-directed and at his own pace.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is much more driven. She wanted to play the violin and asked for Suzuki lessons at age 3 (after meeting a homeschooling mom who is a Suzuki teacher). She has been taking Suzuki for 2 years, which is quite structured. I started taking lessons along with her. But she also likes to learn fiddle tunes on the side, so I&#39;ll help her pick out the notes to fiddle songs that I&#39;m playing. She practices every day and works on the songs in a very particular order. But this is the kind of thing she loves - she really wants to excel and to learn new stuff quickly and she has an exceptional ear and is very disappointed if something doesn&#39;t sound right to her. So the fits-and-starts approach really doesn&#39;t work for her and she has chosen something different.<br/>
<br/>
I think really, you just need to honor how the kid wants to learn and find ways to meet whatever their immediate need is. Give them lots of information about the different ways available to them, talk to them about their goals, and find ways to help them achieve them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828400837">Pam Sorooshian&#39;s middle daughter learned to read music on her own,  <br/>
gradually, over years.  I&#39;d thought she was taking lessons, because every  time I went <br/>
to their house (every year or two &lt;g&gt;) there was a slightly  harder book open <br/>
on the piano.  Pam said she was tired of hearing the same  stuff, so the next <br/>
time I visited her, I brought her a copy of Clementi  sonatinas.   She opened <br/>
it up and started sightreading them, both  hands together.  Maybe not a big <br/>
deal, but when I asked Pam quietly to tell  me how long she&#39;d been taking <br/>
lessons, Pam said she&#39;d never had a lesson.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809667065">What I did with my oldest girl was to make a poster board &quot;keyboard&quot; <br/>
with Middle C marked, so she could line up the keys. That was at the <br/>
bottom. Across the top, I drew music lines, with notes corresponding <br/>
to each key. IOW, the Middle C was labelled, and the note was also <br/>
directly over the Middle C &quot;key.&quot; My daughter taught herself how to <br/>
read notes with this, and that&#39;s all the further she went.<br/>
<br/>
She can read well enough to play simple pieces, but she isn&#39;t <br/>
interested enough in it to learn the bass clef, and usually only <br/>
learns the first few measures of any given piece.<br/>
<br/>
My other kids have expressed no interest in piano, but my 10 year old <br/>
wants to learn guitar, which we&#39;ll be pursuing this year.<br/>
<br/>
If your son really wants to learn, he&#39;ll sit himself down and <br/>
practice. And, hey, he could be like me: learning how to read music <br/>
now, and leaving it for a time, then picking it back up again in the <br/>
future. If it&#39;s really interesting to him, he&#39;ll spend time at it.<br/>

who is a Suzuki teacher). She has been taking Suzuki for 2 years, <br/>
which is quite structured. I started taking lessons along with her. <br/>
But she also likes to learn fiddle tunes on the side, so I&#39;ll help <br/>
her pick out the notes to fiddle songs that I&#39;m playing. She <br/>
practices every day and works on the songs in a very particular <br/>
order. But this is the kind of thing she loves - she really wants to <br/>
excel and to learn new stuff quickly and she has an exceptional ear <br/>
and is very disappointed if something doesn&#39;t sound right to her. So <br/>
the fits-and-starts approach really doesn&#39;t work for her and she has <br/>
chosen something different.<br/>

&gt; I think really, you just need to honor how the kid wants to learn <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and find ways to meet whatever their immediate need is. Give them <br/>
lots of information about the different ways available to them, talk <br/>
to them about their goals, and find ways to help them achieve them.<br/>
