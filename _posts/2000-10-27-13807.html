&lt;&lt; People who follow the Categorial Imperative do good for the right reasons;<br/>
 not because of a promised reward, or fear of punishment, but rather because<br/>
 doing good is it&#39;s own reward.  Admittedly, sometimes to reach that state of<br/>
 consciousness, we school ourselves with systems of reward and punishment.<br/>
 However, we mustn&#39;t forget that in human development, such systems are only<br/>
 scaffolding.  At some point, we must remove the scaffolding in order to<br/>
 reveal the true edifice: a mature human being whose actions stem from<br/>
 rational and pure motives. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Thank you John for this.  I recently had a discussion with some older women <br/>
(grandparents) about manipulating children&#39;s behaviours through offering <br/>
special treats to keep them quiet or as a reward for waiting.  They thought i <br/>
was going over board, and stated that  we all use behaviour modification to <br/>
get what we want, by talking nicely or smiling to others. I thought this was <br/>
definitely an over-simplification.<br/>
<br/>
My son has never been a big smiler on cue child, nor does he always say <br/>
hello, thank you and please in the way that makes adults beam. Thanks for the <br/>
reminder that it is the edifice underneath the scaffolding of rewards and <br/>
punishment that is what ought to concern us as parents.<br/>

doing good for personal gain, to doing good because it&#39;s the right thing to<br/>
do.<br/>
