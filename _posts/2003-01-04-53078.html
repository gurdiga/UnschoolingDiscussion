had surgery on it.  I could ask him or his mother any questions you have.<br/>

I really feel for you with the knee injury.  I tore my ACL about twenty<br/>
years ago, and have had oodles of trouble since.  I am now in the fifth<br/>
month of recovery from a total knee replacement though, so things are<br/>
looking up. (I have had eight surgeries on that knee since the ACL, all to<br/>
no avail.  I am not saying this to scare you, but to let you know that I<br/>
have lots of experience with knee surgery, lol.)<br/>
<br/>
My very best advice to you is this.  After you have had the surgery and you<br/>
are given exercises to do at Physical Therapy, or at home, do them!  I tore<br/>
my ACL as a college student and did not keep up with the therapy.  Your knee<br/>
will only be as strong as those quad muscles, so determine that you are<br/>
really going to work at it.  If the doctor&#39;s try to just give you an at home<br/>
program and don&#39;t send you to PT, keep fighting until they do send you.<br/>
Don&#39;t be afraid to lay around(and let m your family wait on you) and let the<br/>
knee heal at first, but as soon as you are ready for more strenuous stuff,<br/>
do the exercises and keep them up.<br/>
<br/>
You will be in my prayers.  Let me know how you are doing when you get home,<br/>
kay?<br/>
<br/>
many blessings,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-848429847">Thanks I will let you and everyone know how things go. I am petrified<br/>
at this point but am hopefull since the doc is doing this via<br/>
arthroscopy it will not be quite as excrutiating and will heal a bit<br/>

scares me too as far as pain goes. TTFN, Lynn F</div>

It will be difficult to start the PT the next day, but you can do it!<br/>
Though I do not have complete faith in doctors, I do know that things have<br/>
improved drastically since I had my first surgery, and starting PT right<br/>
away really does get the healing process going faster.  The fact the doctor<br/>
is starting out with arthroscopy is really good, and it will be great if he<br/>
does not have to make a big incision, heals much easier.<br/>
<br/>
As to the question on whether or not you should have the ACL done, that is<br/>
difficult to decide.  My general advice to anyone since all these knee<br/>
surgeries, would be to not ever have surgery until you have no other<br/>
options.(Before this last surgery, I basically said I would not have another<br/>
surgery until it got to the point I could no longer walk.  Well, that day<br/>
came, and rather than be wheel chair bound I took the surgery.  Since my<br/>
knee is now plastic and titanium it is doing great!)  But, if your ACL is no<br/>
longer connected, you will end up with a knee that is weak and gives out on<br/>
you, that isn&#39;t fun, I can tell you from personal experience.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, it has to be a personal decision, but my best advice would be to<br/>
proceed with caution if that is possible. (Though it sounds like the surgery<br/>
date is already set). And if you have the surgery, as I said before, be<br/>
really serious about the PT!<br/>
<br/>
many blessings,<br/>
