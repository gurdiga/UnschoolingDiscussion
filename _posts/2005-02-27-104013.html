&gt; She is  seven and three months old.  At what point, if ever, should I  <br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; concerned enough about her speech to seek professional help?  I&#39;ve  <br/>
&gt; talked to<br/>
&gt; her before about her R&#39;s.  She knows that she cannot speak  the true R <br/>
&gt; sound<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;ve had her focus on how I say a word with R in it so  that she<br/>
&gt; recognizes that the word is spelled with an R not a W.  I  certainly <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want to do anything to discourage her from writing and she  doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; care very<br/>
&gt; much that her invented spelling is difficult for some to  read.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My now 8.5 year old has had pronunciation problems,  mostly with R&#39;s.  <br/>
Other than my older daughter and other kids correcting her <br/>
occasionally, we left her alone.  I had wondered a couple of times <br/>
(while listening to other moms talk about the speech therapy they were <br/>
getting for their kid, or asking me if I had looked into &quot;fixing&quot; <br/>
Steffi&#39;s speech), if we should &quot;do something&quot; about it.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
when she stopped having trouble with R&#39;s, but she doesn&#39;t any more.  <br/>
It&#39;s certainly been in the last year, maybe in the last six months.<br/>
<br/>
She is a pre-reader/writer, so I don&#39;t have any experience with the <br/>
writing, but I&#39;m sure that your daughter will self correct the spelling <br/>
as she self corrects the speech - when she is ready!<br/>
