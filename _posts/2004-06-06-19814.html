<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546871606">I&#39;m inviting any unschoolers that wants to come.......<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers let&#39;s go relax, visit, play and camp! <br/>
<br/>
When? June 24th-27th (more or less it&#39;s up to you - you can even just come out for one day - My family is staying three nights Thurs-Sat and then packing it up on Sunday)<br/>
<br/>
Where? Lake Jacomo (between Lee&#39;s Summit and Blue Springs, MO) <br/>
<br/>
Why? To hang out with other unschooling families, visit, play and relax. <br/>
<br/>
What else can we do? You can fish, visit the bird watching center, hike, swim at the beach and/or take a paddle boat out. (not sure of the prices of the extras yet like beach and paddle boats yet). <br/>
<br/>
How much? $10 for a basic tent site, $15 for electricity, $22 for full hook ups a night. I was told there are no reservations and it&#39;s first come first serve. I was also told that the park is really only busy on holiday weekends. <br/>
<br/>
Any scheduled events? I would like to have a potluck dinner on Saturday night (26th) and anyone that wants to come out and join us can. I think I may rent a shelter for that night with a ball field. Maybe we can have a big kick ball or wiffle ball game? <br/>
<br/>
Directions? I haven&#39;t gotten that far yet. But will keep everyone posted. I need to drive out there and make my own map.  <br/>
<br/>
RSVP? Please let me know if you plan on coming ASAP even though there are no reservations if this gets too big I may need to look into a bigger camp ground. <br/>
<br/>
Questions or Suggestions? email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jane@...">jane@...</a> <br/>
<br/>
Updates? I will keep everyone updated about the extra cost of the beach, paddle boats and exactly how to get there ASAP. I will also send out updates about the RSVP list so you can see if your friends are planning on attending. <br/>
<br/>

I just found out this is going on that weekend and called about it. They couldn&#39;t tell me much other than most people don&#39;t camp and are there partying on their boats. We won&#39;t be camping right next to the lake we will be a few miles away but the fireworks might be cool. :) The person I spoke with thought it was free for anyone that does want to go. <br/>
