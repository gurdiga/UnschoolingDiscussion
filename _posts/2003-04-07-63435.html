<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334427216">This is from an interview with Russell Means.  I was actually looking <br/>
for a different unschooling quote from him but found this.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A school system -- a government school system -- is in place to turn <br/>
out dumb people;  they&#39;re more easily controllable by centralized <br/>
power than independent thinkers are.  They don&#39;t want you thinking <br/>
independently in this country.&quot;</div>
