something that was almost exactly like:<br/>
<br/>
  ~~~ Don&#39;t forget! If you change the topic, change the subject line! ~~~<br/>
<br/>
but she didn&#39;t realize I removed it a bit ago since I suspect that though<br/>
people may have seen it on occasion, it didn&#39;t really register.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also a every-2-week note that automatically posts about changing the<br/>
subject line. I chucked that a couple of days ago too because I personally<br/>
found it annoying intrusive to have it pop up with no context. It just had<br/>
an impersonal feel to it.<br/>
<br/>
Did either of them ever make someone remember to change the subject line?<br/>
Let me know and I&#39;ll put one or both back.<br/>
<br/>
I think the most effective way is for someone to reach their annoyance level<br/>
and just remind people. That at least works for a couple of days. ;-)<br/>
