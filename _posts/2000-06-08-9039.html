That is horrible.  I guess we just can never tell what kind of service we are <br/>
going to get by the nam.  I would have been furious! <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone ever had a nursing photo taken?  I am dying to do this but I am <br/>
afraid they are going to be really expensive.  I would love to hear your <br/>
thoughts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849573607">My aunt took a picture of me nursing dd#1 7 years ago .I think I&#39;ll ask her<br/>
for a copy of it. She has a liver melanoma and is slowly being taken away<br/>
from us. This is one precious belongings she has that I&#39;d like to get. Not<br/>
because I&#39;m selfish, but because to this day I vividly remember the moment<br/>
she took it and it means a lot to me.<br/>

Yes  I have had a portrait done at <br/>
a La Leche League conference. If you are in So Cal you can contact the lady<br/>
that does these.  They were wonderful and reasonable (I think $55 for 8 4x6 <br/>
prints).  A couple of the pics were just us posing together and one of naked <br/>
baby, no parts exposed LOL.  If you aren&#39;t in the area I would say contact<br/>
LLL International to find a local group or see if they have someone to refer<br/>
you too.  I would&#39;t feel comfortable with just anyone taking these pics thats<br/>
for sure, as I was half naked myself (underware and a denim shirt open, <br/>
baby naked...very nice, she covers you up so that you aren&#39;t hanging all out<br/>
or stretch marks exposed etc!)<br/>
