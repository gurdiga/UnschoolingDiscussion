<div id="ygrps-yiv-761394036">How about Gen 1:27-28?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So God created man in his own image, in the image of GOd He created <br/>
him; male and female He created them.  God blessed them and said to <br/>
them, &quot;Be fruitful and increase in number;  fill the earth and subdue <br/>
it.  Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over <br/>
every living creature that moves on the ground.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I won&#39;t say that means that we today have a <br/>
commandment to be fruitful and increase in number, otherwise every <br/>
infertile couple would be breaking a commandment.  I believe that <br/>
commandment was to Adam and Eve specifically.  I do, however, believe <br/>
that the general attitude of the Bible is that children are to be <br/>
treasured, that they&#39;re wonderful blessings from God, and that we <br/>
should enjoy them and desire to have them.  <br/>

Something I&#39;ve always wondered about but never asked. Hopefully this won&#39;t <br/>
cause trouble. For those who believe in the Bible, how does one explain Adam <br/>
and Eve having children and then where did the other children come from. All <br/>
of Adam and Eve&#39;s kids? Multiplying among brothers and sister?<br/>

Thank you for the answer and I&#39;m following so far. Now another question. How <br/>
do you know this about the explanation you gave me? Is it written in the <br/>
bible that this is the case or something someone taught you? And again, <br/>
thanks for the explanation. I&#39;ve been to private catholic schools all my <br/>
life and whenever my doubtful questions were asked, I never got any answer <br/>
that seemed logical to me other than because that&#39;s the way it was. Any <br/>
chance I can ask some other things that I&#39;ve wondered about in regard to the <br/>
bible without a war?<br/>

The Bible doesn&#39;t come right out and explain genetic mutations, but <br/>
it does say that Adam and Eve were created perfect.  We do know that <br/>
death and decay of the human body happened only as a result of Eve&#39;s <br/>
sin.  <br/>
